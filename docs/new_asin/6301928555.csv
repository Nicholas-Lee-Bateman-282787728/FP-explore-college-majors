378395,5,6301928555,"This is the one movie that has stuck with me from my childhood. I grew up in a time of some amazing and amazingly terrible horror films. We spent our summers haunting our local video rental store for every horror flick we could find and they were easy to find back then. We grabbed everything from The Exorcist, Halloween, Pumpkinhead, Puppetmaster, Pet Semetary, The Stuff, The Hitcher, to Last House on the Left and Bloodsucking Freaks (anyone remember that one?!). It was a beautiful time to be a horror fan and though we were possibly too young for most of it, we watched it anyway.

But then I found Near Dark and that was it. I had found my film. I was in love. This movie was a unique mix of brutality, familial ties, insane road trip and, of course, a story of sweet romantic love. My young, messed up heart could barely take it all in. Now, many moons later, its allure hasn't faded for me. This film is something special.

It starts when a farm boy named Caleb, played by a very young Adrian Pasdar, sets out for a night of fun with his buddies. They spy a sweet faced beauty just hanging out, licking an ice cream cone and Caleb is the only one brave enough to walk up to her and ask if he can have a lick of her cone and tells her how shes just about the prettiest girl he ever did see. Hes not exactly smooth with the words but hes cute and this awkward seduction surprisingly works. Before you know it, Mae is in his truck and talking about how enraptured she is by the night but hes more interested in her lips to really take in her words. He gets his steamy kiss and a little more in the form of a love nip that leaves him bloody and a little stunned. She then runs off into the night she so adores.

As Caleb is walking home (his truck has broken down), dawn arrives and he starts to feel extremely sick. His dad and little sister start heading towards him to help him out but a strange RV speeds by and swoops him up. This is how he meets Maes family which consists of Lance Henriksen and Jenette Goldstein as the leaders/parents/what-have-you, a wild-eyed and wicked Bill Paxton and a boy named Homer who is possibly the most chilling member of the group. Caleb soon learns that he must kill in order to become an official member of their little family.

All he wanted was a little kiss.

Caleb quickly realizes that they are not kidding about the killing bit when they visit a bar for some refreshments and all hell breaks loose. Intense violence and fright ensues as well as a few classic one-liners. I hate em when they aint been shaved. Make of that what you will . . . Anyway, the odds are upped when Calebs family, who has been trailing the RV, catches up with them.

This movie is violent, sexy, ruthless, sweet, gory, scary and romantic and it gets all of the beats right. Some people complain about the end but Im a romantic, I suppose, and it made me happy. The pace is steady, it has an emotional heart and the entire film feels grimy which perfectly fits a murderous life on the road.

378453,5,6301928555,"I'll admit that the vampire genre is not my cup of tea. Do I like several installments to this genre? Absolutely. However, most of it is ridiculously-fantastical crap that is getting worse and worse. The genre hit its ""feces zenith"" when it started combining the vamp genre with the ""oh you're such a special teeny who was born to accomplish special things"" genre. Ugh. What sh__.

Thusly, I encourage you to travel all the way back to 1987 for the underrated horror film ""Near Dark."" When they bite, they either drain you or turn you into a vampire. When the sun hits them, they burn to a cinder. When the sun goes down, they turn into the ravenous creatures they truly are. Don't you miss films like that?

""Near Dark"" isn't trying to build empires or tell a tale of a thousand year-old vamp. No, instead, it concentrates on a small town Oklahoma rancher Caleb (played by Adrian Pasdar) who lives at home with his dad and sister. When he sees the mysterious, gorgeous stranger Mae (played by Jenny Wright) in town, he is automatically intrigued and pursues her because -- let's be honest -- Wright was one of the most uniquely beautiful actresses back in that day. So, pursue her he does. Little does Caleb know, Mae is intending on feeding on him, which she hesitates to do because she starts falling for his innocence and kindness. But, being a creature of the night, she does bite him, but then runs away to avoid the urge to feed on him.

Caleb begins turning shortly thereafter and unfortunately, the sun is on the rise. He is abducted by a winnebago as he is burning under the rising sun and this is witnessed by Caleb's dad and sister. Upon being abducted, we find that this was facilitated by guilt-ridden Mae... and her entourage. The casting of this film (Karen Rea) was every bit as thoroughly-impressive and effective as the writing (Kathryn Bigelow) itself. I brought this up because at this point, we are introduced to Mae's traveling company consisting of:
Lance Henriksen as Jesse Hooker: a man turned into a vampire so long ago that he fought for The South. Hooker lends a rough, unforgiving and experienced side to the vampire. He kills not only because he needs to, but also because he seems to hold a genuine contempt for his food.
Jenette Goldstein as Diamondback: not sure which outweighs the other: her beautiful, mature, tough exterior, or her parallel to Jesse Hooker's uncompromising view of their food source.
Joshua John Miller as Homer: he's a kid. Somewhat interesting, but no biggie.
Bill Paxton as Severen: without a doubt, humorous ""wild man"" roles such as Severen and Hudson (from ""Aliens"") have cemented Paxton as a staple of the 80s. His Severen character in ""Near Dark"" is the instigator of the group... and when he instigates, he then becomes an enforcer. He is a merciless, cold-blooded killer who takes an outward enjoyment in making his victims squirm before lowering the boom.
The cast of this film was well-chosen and the rich characters are not only realistic images of what I can imagine, they're also genuinely interesting and make this film flow smoothly. I had let almost 25 years go by between viewings of this film and I have to point out that it doesn't feel as dated as I expected, nor have any flaws in its pacing become apparent. Simply, as the film progresses, we find Caleb has to prove his worth to the group. If he doesn't kill, he doesn't feed. If he doesn't feed, he dies.
Along the way, we're treated to bar brawling, a shootout and a particularly interesting scene involving the group and Caleb's sister and dad (played by the great Tim Thomerson) in which Caleb has to choose between his family and his unenviable condition. The film stays simple and honest-feeling as a roving group of vampires looks to feed, but have a little morbid fun too. So, why can't other films maintain such a level-headed feel? Why is it that today's film makers almost ALWAYS try to over-do it? Why do they take would could be a good film and they CGI it to doomsday while casting some the most talentless piles of crap in the world? If you have been inundated with high-budget, low-yield crap from today's film industry and you haven't seen ""Near Dark"" (but enjoy horror/vampire films), you'll find this to be a thoroughly entertaining film.",1463356800,,4286,4.6892430278884465

378653,5,6301928555,"In the 1980's, there came a loud roar from a director who knew what made horror fans tick. Her name is Kathryn Bigelow. She would go on to direct big name films. But to those of us who love real horror films, with excellent atmosphere and was not afraid to cross the line on downright crazy characters who pull you into the cult world of 'dark' escapism, she runs circles around you cgi, p.c. Twilight padded cell babies. Once upon a time to make a film like this work, you needed real composers, conductors, etc. She chose to go with Tangerine Dream  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangerine_Dream.

This choice brings the viewer into the vampire's lives as well as the victims involved. ""Near Dark"" is a Horror film first and foremost but also has elements of two lovers and the lives they lead that separates them. The driving force behind the cast: Adrian Pasdar, Lance Henriksen, Jenette Goldstein,  Bill Paxton, Jenny Wright, as well as ""Trancers"" Tim Thomerson"". I dare say this classy, gory film is very well made and we will not see the likes of again. Today, they make video games disguised as movies. All those who want the real thing, watch ""Near Dark"". All others, continue to watch the watered down Annabelles and other PG-13 garbage.

First off, there isn't really a plot.  It is kind of cool at first because you don't know where the story is going.  But then it really doesn't go anywhere.  And secondly, why are these vampires so stupid?  They party and look for victims every night for however many years.

378711,3,6301928555,"I just watched this movie yesterday for the first time. I was disappointed with it after seeing so much high praise. I liked the old school 80s vibe and music. I liked the cinematography. I liked the premise of nomadic vampires in the Midwest. I also thought the fact that the movie didn't use special effects to show any vampire transformations innovative and well done. However, I disliked the characterizations and clumsy storytelling.

The vampire characters just weren't fleshed out well enough. One vampire is more than 40 years old but became a vampire when he was still 10. Thus, he's a 40 year old in a 10 year old's body. The movie could have shown his personality complex that arises from being treated like a kid by vampires and humans alike despite his advanced age. He's given little screen time, however. He's never shown to be in love with any of the female vampires. So his revelation of love comes as a shock because he never shows a hint of jealousy for her love toward another vampire.

Nor are the other vampires given much characterization. Is Bill Paxton's character a psycho before he became a vampire? Or did it arrive after realizing his immortality. Why do the older couple love each other so desperately? How did they all feel when they became vampires? The movie could have given us so much about the vampires yet we never learn much about then aside from the occasional hint. Also, they seem to be pretty dumb vampires. Since they've been vampires for years, you'd think they would have established a better arrangement for avoiding the sunlight. They do things such as starting a bar massacre or kidnapping less than an hour before sunrise. They should have also taken precautions against blocking out the sunlight in their cars hours before sunrise. Why are they always caught off guard when the sunlight comes around?

Another important thing is the love between the two protagonists. The chemistry was lacking. I didn't understand why they seemed so desperately in love with each other despite knowing each other for less than a month (probably less than 3 weeks). Why was she so willing to go against her vampire clan for him? Why was he so willing to give up his family (until they found him) for her? The audience never learns about their goals, desires, hopes, dreams, and what exactly it is the two find so attractive in each other.

As far as the storytelling goes, it was clunky and clumsy. One character is new to being a vampire. He cannot come to terms with the idea of killing someone to feed his vampire diet. However, he watches other vampires ruthlessly kill innocent civilians and police officers by the score and doesn't bat an eye. He's revolted by the idea of killing other humans but then he'll high-five other vampires in a motel room after abetting their massacre of humans? Then he goes back to his family and completely forgets about the violence as if it were a traffic violation? It also doesn't make sense why he would leave the other vampires and be not realize they'd come after him.

Other clumsy things:
--In one scene, it's pitch black outside. Five minutes later daylight is shining outside the motel room.
--These vampires can take shotgun shots to the gut easily. But a 10 year old girl is able to knock out another vampire with a small pistol?
--At the beginning, the vampires split up in search of food. Why do through the trouble of trying to hitchhiking away from one another in order to get food?
--These vampires only seem to need less than half a pint of blood per night. So why don't they store a large amount so they don't have to go hunting every night?

I'll stop there. I would have been willing to like the movie despite its flaws like the Lost Boys. The Lost Boys was mainly trying to be an entertaining vampire movie, so I was able to overlook that movie's flaws. But Near Dark tries hard to be serious so I notice flaws in a serious movie more. This is especially the case when the characterizations are weak or underdeveloped.

Near Dark had a good premise but should have focused on the characters more and tightened the story.",1394755200,3,4113,4.641483516483516

378866,5,6301928555,"Thank you Anchor Bay another favorite of mine. I want to say this film get's way to much hate, now sure it is not let's say as good as Dracula 1931 or Nosferatu 1922 but it's still pretty darn good. Now to be honest I like this film but I feel that The Lost Boys is a little better.
I'll cover the good, the bad, and the ugly.

The Good: Decent acting, pretty good effects, pretty good characters, okay story, good gore and an awesome bar scene. The scenery is good and really adds to the film.

The Bad: The film at times is just a little slow and only a little bit off the acting is bad.

The Ugly: It get's hate that it does not deserve, if anything hate the new cover for the blu ray and hate that god awful Twilight series both the books and films.

The story: In the countryside of Texas a young man by the name of Caleb Colton is attraced to a young woman by the name of Mae who bites him just before dawn. Mae returns in the night with her gang of Vampire buddies. Now Caleb is apart of the bloodsucking group and they go across country sucking the blood of citizens but the police and Caleb's father are hot on their trail.

Back in 1987 Near Dark lost at the box office due to competing with the Lost Boys (another fav) but anyway to be honest if you want to see the greatest Vampire flick from the 1980s see Fright Night 1985. Here's a list of the best vampire films from the 80s besides Near Dark.

Fright Night 1985
The Lost Boys 1987
Fright Night part 2 1988 (very rare)
Vamp 1986
and
The Monster Squad 1987(also has The Wolf Man, Frankenstein's monster, The Gill-man, & The Mummy)

Near Dark stars Lance Henriksen from the awesomely great Pumpkinhead 1988 and Aliens 1986, Bill Paxton from Mortuary 1983 and the fantastic Brain Dead/Dead Alive 1990, and others.

Sadly I only own the one disc Anchor Bay release but you know what I could careless I'm just happy to own this film. The dvd comes with a chapter selections sheet which on the other side is a poster of the film.

The disc includes:
Main feature
scene selection
Audio Commentary

378980,5,6301928555,"Just as the vampire seemed to be losing its icy grip on the Horror film, the genre received the fresh new blood it needed from NEAR DARK in 1987. Caleb is overtaken by a beautiful stranger, Mae, whose kiss transforms him into a creature of the night. Just as dawn is about to break, Caleb and Mae are snatched up by the band of nomadic vampires that she calls 'family.' Caleb must now decide to either run with the pack or fight his deadly new disease on his own. NEAR DARK is more of a modernization than a reimagining of the classic vampire mythos. The standard rules still apply, and as we often see in the film, sunlight packs one hell of a punch against these gun-totting baddies. The Gothic trappings of the past have been dropped in place of an Action/Western hybrid with an emphasis on the Horror. NEAR DARK brings together the perfect cast of bloodsuckers, led by Lance Henriksen as the ruthless Jesse. ALIENS co-star Jenette Goldstein stars as his sadistic lover Diamondback, while Bill Paxton's wild antics as Severen turn out one of his most enjoyable performances ever. The carefully chosen title speaks to the characters of Caleb and Mae. Although they have been initiated into a world of darkness, they sit on the brink of good and evil, and still have hope for salvation. Of the many memorable scenes, the bloody bar fight between Jesse's vampire posse and the local s***kickers stands out the most, followed by the blazing gun battle with the police that nearly destroys the group as sunlight pours in from the bullet holes. NEAR DARK is a modern classic that, along with THE LOST BOYS from the same year, helped to usher in a new era of vampire films.

378981,3,6301928555,"Having liked ""The Hurt Locker"" and a lot of vampire movies, I was intrigued when I read about this movie. The premise is interesting and it's definitely not your run of the mill vampire movie plot. The main issue I had with the movie was that the storyline sort of meandered and there were characters that should have had more of a back story. The middle of the movie was really bogged down in a lot of unnecessary violence. The time could have been better spent in finding out more about how the individual vampires came to be. I watched it to the end, but all in all I didn't think it was that great. There are a lot better movies out there to spend an afternoon on.",1359158400,,668,4.2265625

To me, it failed in about every way possible.  I really didn't give a crap about the characters, it didn't hook me.  In fact, I stopped several times and worked on my college homework--because that was more entertaining!

I kept watching, praying that it would get better ... in the end, I finished watching because I'd already paid to rent it and I might as well get my monies worth.

Is it any good?

Long before Kathryn Bigelow won best director for `The Hurt Locker' she directed this cool, ultra stylish vampire flick. Near Dark is part Western part Vampire movie with romance and humour mixed with stunning visuals of the American mid-west. With half the cast of `Aliens' the acting is top-notch; Henriksen as charismatic leader Jesse, Paxton as sadistic southerner Severen and Goldstein as Diamondback what else do you need? The word vampire is never actually used throughout the movie which adds an element of isolation, they don't know why or how they came to be, they just know the need to kill and survive. `Near Dark' is one of the most underated horror movies of the 80's, you won't find any bent twilight vamps here just dirty, gritty ultra violent bloodsuckers; check it out.

379123,5,6301928555,"This is how beautiful this little horror movie is. It is very dark - which is only normal considering that the heroes have a tendency to burn if exposed to sunlight. It is also quite violent but also surprisingly touching. It shows the world from the vampire perspective and does it REALLY well. And this is not a nice vision. In fact the traveling ""family"" of vampires is living a hell in which the only consolation is the strong affectionate link uniting them (although in the same time they keep bickering and fighting). And still, even in this horrible existence of murder and suffering there are some moments of quite joy - and at that time damnation can also have a sweet taste.

All the actors do here a great job. Adrian Pasdar (Caleb Colton), who was going to succeed later in TV series, was here in the very beginning of his career but he already was showing great promise. Lance Henriksen, who plays the leader Jesse Hooker, a veteran of Confederate army and leader of the vampire pack, brings to this movie his unique appearance and no less exceptionnal talent. Bill Paxton (Severen) do not really need to be presented any more - here he plays a character really different from the annoying but ultimately harmless morons who were his specialty in ""Aliens"" and ""Predator 2"".

Young Jenny Wright (Mae), who later interrupted her career and disappeared from public view, gives here a very moving performance - greatly helped by her exceptionnal beauty. Finally, a particularly impressive performance is that of Jenette Goldstein (Diamondback). She has an almost supernatural ability to transform herself, according to the needs of scenario. I simply couldn't believe that this was the same actress who played Vasquez in ""Aliens"" barely a year before!

This is quite a movie. Well done, coherent, with smart dialogues, great acting (especially by Lance Henriksen and Bill Paxton) and master level camera work. And considering that it was her first, well, no wonder that Kathryn Bigelow ultimately went to win Oscars... I enjoyed ""Near Dark"" a lot and I recommend it warmly.",1333324800,,2082,4.8923512747875355

Aunque me gustan las peliculas de vampiros, esta no es para nada una que recomiende. Pobre actuacion, efectos especiales de television de los '70 y no de cine, de hecho ni tengo idea si alguna vez la extrenaron en el cine. Espero que no, mucha gente debe haber perdido su dinero. Tiene actores que son muy buenos hoy en dia, pero parece que en aquel entonces, solo estaban aprendiendo. Mi recomendacion es que no se dejen llevar por la retocada caratula para hacerla lucir interesante y moderna, ni por su bien escrita sinopsis Realmente, no vale la pena la perdida de tiempo y dinero por esta pelicula.

I'll tell you why--I don't think Amazon is a place to rate a movie..Heck, they own IMDB..If anything review the movie there..
What I do is rate the quality of transfer, the extras, ect..and if I purchased used I'll make a comment on the seller IF it isn't as described..

Okay..My review of the Blu-ray of ""Near Dark"" is it is an insult to the consumer..It is so bad that half the movie is unwatchable.

Now I also own the DVD and it is grainy and dark..but you can SEE the movie.. This is a crime to release this on Blu-ray like this..It's worse than the original DVD..

Sure some of the daylight scenes are amazingly sharp..But there are very few..maybe 10 minutes total of the entire film..

Now, if you say well that's the best they could do I submit ""The Interview with the Vampire"" as an example of a very dark film with difficult contrasting that on Blu-ray looks awesome..

379182,4,6301928555,"If you're a fan of films like twilight and other vampire films you should like this film I loved it, and its not centered on or around teens, I mean sure the actors are still young but there not so young that it becomes cookie cutter or too Kelcey, not that I'm knocking twilight because I liked that film as well but Near Dark was one of the first films of its kind, it will always be a fav of mine, the film takes a more realistic view of what a vampire could be or would be if they really existed, so if your expecting to see wolfs, bats, or smoke you might want to pick another film but if you have an open mind check it out.

The film starts off very mysterious and if your viewing it for the very first time you'll be a little surprised at how it ends, by the way I'm very happy with the ending it didn't leave me feeling disappointed or confused like so many films of today. the movie was made in the mid 80s and it has a certain air about it that you just don't see in films today in my opinion. I saw the film years ago as a teen, it was playing on one of the cable networks it aired commercial free, and anyway I liked it then and still like it now.

I loved all the actors performances in the film especially jenny Wright and Adrian Pasdar I thought he performed very well in the film, and he is also easy on the eyes too haha, and Jenny she played the character of Mea the mysterious drifter she is awesome in the movie and her group of co-stars rocks, of course I'd love to tell you more but I don't want to spoil it for first time viewers, this film has become one of my favorites through the years and the DVD is not bad it has some extras too such as audio commentary and a deleted scene so its a pretty good value check it out.",1291334400,2,1744,3.965811965811966

The acting was decent enough, and I'm sure that it was made for a fairly low budget, but the overall story wasn't very compelling or well-told.  For one thing, this group of vampires have got to be one of the dumbest groups of vampires ever portrayed in films. You'd think that after living for 150 years or longer, you'd learn a few things such as, I don't know, maybe if you're a vampire and the sun will kill you, then you should look for a dark place to sleep at least a few minutes before sunrise, without waiting to see the sun appear?  ""Oh no, there's that sun again!  How did that happen?""  The vampires were caught in the sunrise more times than I care to remember.

She was supposed to finish him off, but since she couldn't, her vampire family show up and capture Caleb. Since he was bit they give him a small amount of time to make his first kill.

  I actually never heard of this movie until recently and I don't know why it took so long for me to hear about it. The film is well made with a good cast. Bill Paxton is at his coolest as Severen, the wildest one of the vampire family. I also think Lance Henrikson was really good as Jesse, the father figure of the vampire group.

  I do think the movie had it's flaws though. I mean in the bar scene all the victims just stand there in awe watching until it's their turn to be food. While the cure for being a vampire is just lazily introduced to the plot. Vampires that don't move super quick and that carry guns might turn off some fans of the genre though. I don't think we ever even see their fangs.

Supporting actors include Lance Henriksen, a personal favorite of mine, who delivers a great performance as usual, as the leader of the vampire gang.  Bill Paxton is the really evil bad boy of the gang and plays his part well. Also, Jenette Goldstein is the other female vampire.

It is absurd to criticise a vampire western on grounds of logic but by its own terms the film becomes confused and incoherent. This is mostly due to the clumsy attempt to resolve it in a happy ending. Maybe the film wouldn't have got funded if it had pursued its darker impulses to the end. The problem with endings like this is that it undoes the entire film - realigning all its subversive moments  with a conservative, reactionary and frankly dull cause.

379278,2,6301928555,"Picked this up on Blu-Ray tonight.  I had seen it several years ago and it's one of my wife's favorites, so we bought it at Mart du Wal for cheap.  The original film story line and quality were very good for the budget and the actors turn in solid performances (Bill Paxton is a riot, and Lance Henriksen, Tim Thomerson, and Adrian Pasdar are personal faves).  What I particularly liked:  (1) This is a vampire movie where the term ""vampire"" isn't used once and (2) vampirism in this wee corner of the cinematic universe is reversible:  refreshing, if farfetched.  Scoring and effects could have been better but, you know...

Anyway, about the Blu-Ray:  The Lions Gate 'Near Dark' Blu-Ray has the distinction of being the first faulty Blu-Ray I've ever purchased - and I've purchased a few hundred at this point.  Transfer quality did not appear to be much better than a decent DVD (I'm watching this through an Oppo BDP-83 onto a Samsung 62-inch DLP) and the worst part:  there was an artifact line about 1/4 of the way down the screen that stayed on the screen for better than 90-percent of the picture.  It was most noticeable during dark scenes (hey, we're talking VAMPIRE movie here...).  The artifact was a series of sporadic dots, all on one horizontal line.  Not present in the preview, splash, special features, or menu screens, solely on the feature.  Not good.  Mine's going back to Walmart for exchange.  Hopefully the next one will be better.  If it repeats, it goes back for refund and we'll downgrade to DVD.  Lions Gate, your BD production contractors have dissed you.

It wants to be a love story but it isn't especially easy to believe since Caleb and Mae fall in love about two minutes after their first meeting.  Mae is played by the rodent faced Jenny Wright, whose acting range consists of pursing her lips, occasionally blinking her eyes and whispering all her lines.  Adrian Pasdar is Caleb who is rather more attractive than Wright and has more acting skills (including drooling, clutching his stomach and mumbling his dialog).  Lance Henrickson is on hand looking for all the world like an AIDS victim with a meth addiction and annoying Josh Miller is a 12 year old with a Cindy Brady lisp and a penchant for younger women.  They all ride around in stolen vans and cars, forever tapeing tin foil and cardboard to the windshield as they inevitably stay out past sun up. These vampires seem to have an allergy to water that is as severe as their aversion to sunlight, since none of them ever seem to bathe and they are all constantly covered in black soot for various reasons. Other nonsense includes Caleb's dad discovering the cure for vampirism is blood transfusion.

The film gets plenty of extras on this Bluray from LionsGate.  The transfer looks good enough but since the film itself is so unattractive looking, this disc is never going to be very impressive in terms of picture quality.  5.1 soundtrack is okay but nothing special.  The disc includes a mind blowingly insipid commentary track from bland director Kathryn Bigelow, mouthing platitudes and indicating to the unfortunate listener how inspired and creative she believes she is.  There is a forgetable deleted scene that can be watched with or without commentary.  There is a drab making-of documentary and theatrical trailers.

I am  though going to tell you if the blu-ray version is better than the standard def release. The visual and audio quality of the blu-ray version of Near Dark is definitely a major improvement over its standard def counterpart. Their is also a few problems for example the only special features are a audio commentary, the living in darkness documentary, one deleted scene with commentary, and two theatrical trailers aswell as two English subtitles and one Spanish. All of the bonus material is in standard definition.

 The problem I have with the collection is with the special features. Since I had the Anchor Bay two disc edition from back in 2002. So I had hoped they would have added additional content, especially considering on the back of the box it says ""deleted scenes"" which to me implies more than one or maybe a new commentary with Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, Jenette Goldstein and Adrian Pasdar since they all seem to have fond memories of the movie. At first when you watch the movie where the mosquito scene is at the movie looks a little like the dvd edition then after that it clears up noticeably. Skin tones are spot on  crimson reds almost pop off the screen, and all things considered this movie looks incredible for its age and the fact it had a small budget. On the audio side the film has an English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio which can rattle the floors and other things if you have a good audio set up, an English 2.0 PCM Audio which is ok but even if you don't have surround sound use the DTS audio it still sounds better, finally the last Audio is a commentary with just Katherine Bigelow.

 When it comes to the box art the individual who came up with the twilight cover should be smacked upside the head for creating such terrible art. I'll end this review by saying if you want the upgrade by all means buy it just don't expect alot of additional content because you will be disappointed, if you haven't seen it and have a blu-ray player this is the best version to get since this movie looks and sounds alot better than it ever has.

379367,4,6301928555,"I keep harping to friends about Near Dark, a film I remember seeing when I was a kid. It was one of the first DVDS I bought and a movie I consider one of the best vampire films ever. In truth watching it again it would easily make a good companion piece to last years Let the Right One In as the vampires in the movie are more predatory creatures instead of elegant killers. They're a coven, a messed up family if ever there was one who stick to their own and don't like intruders. With these facts in check theres a lot I like about the movie and its down and dirty nature. I like the tidbits the movie throws out like the fact that the clan only kills its prey instead of turning them. And despite admiting the silliness of a vampire cure I do like the tie in to the idea that vampirism is a disease being an ode to I Am Legend, one that can be cured. In the end its an interesting movie, well made.
I like the story itself as it is with a boy being taken into this world and being given a week to kill or be killed. The actors do alright with Bill Paxton of course being the standout as the over the top Severn. As a villain He's more wild card then menace. Most of the other actors are good with Henricksen of course being great though Joshua Miller is a bit grating as Homer, the adult in a childs body. Check it out if you haven't seen it.
Like I said it was one of the first DVDS I bought, the Anchor Bay Special Edition.

379369,5,6301928555,"Katherine Bigelow reportedly wanted to create an old-fashioned Western movie... mixed with a vampire romance. The result was something that could have been a disaster.

Instead ""Near Dark"" is a deeply underappreciated little cult movie, which demonstrates that talent and originality in vampire movies isn't quite gone. Bigelow smoothly intertwines eerie otherworldliness with a grimy, gritty Western flavour, and spreads the resulting atmosphere over a clever, tightly-written script and some solid acting from Adrian Pasdar and Jenny Wright.

Small-town boy Caleb (Pasdar) encounters an ethereal young woman named Mae (Wright) on the street one night. They seem to be shyly hitting it off... until she bites him and leaves.

Before Caleb knows it, the sun literally causes his skin to burn, and he's been yanked into the RV of a gang of vampire drifters -- Mae among them. They're a pretty mean bunch, and even their leader Jessie Hooker (Lance Henriksen) gives him only one week to prove himself. But Caleb refuses to give in to ""instinct"" by drinking blood and killing his victims, which causes some problems.

Meanwhile, Caleb's father (Tim Thomerson) and the local police are searching for the missing young man -- and when Caleb manages to save the vampires from the cops, they finally accept him. But then one of them develops a crush on Caleb's kid sister Sarah, and Caleb finds himself torn between his strange new life and his family's safety. Even if he can somehow be cured of his vampirism, can he hope to destroy an entire bloodsucker gang out to kill him?

""Near Dark"" is one of those cult movies that doesn't have a big enough cult -- it gets overshadowed by other 1980s vampire movies like ""Interview with the Vampire"" and ""The Lost Boys,"" despite having little in common with them. The vampires in it are dirty, amoral, trashy and casually cruel as only human beings freed from mortality and law can be (""Remember that fire we started in Chicago?"") -- which is an all-too-probable result if someone were to become a vampire.

And Bigelow gives the movie a unique atmosphere, setting it in the grimy, dusty small towns of Oklahoma and filling it with blood, guns and nighttime streets -- in fact if it didn't have vampires, you'd think it was a coming-of-age tale about falling in with a bad crowd. But there are also a number of sweet romantic scenes, which are all the more striking because they don't get over-the-top or cheesy.

And there's a quiet, understated visual power to Bigelow's directing style, whether it's Caleb tottering across a field with smoke pouring from his clothes, or an erotic blood-drink against a pumping oil rig on a lightning-filled night. And her script is a pretty solid one as well, with excellent dialogue ranging from the quietly beautiful (""... I'll still be here when the light from that star gets down here to earth..."") to macabrely funny (""It's finger-lickin' GOOD!"").

Pasdar is intense and gutsy as a nice young country boy who has the misfortune to get turned into a vampire against his will, and Wright is wispily endearing as the only vampire who sympathizes with him. Some of the supporting vampires get kind of 2-D and over-the-top at times, but Henriksen does an outstanding job as their weary, battle-scarred leader, and Joshua John Miller does a good job as a vampire trapped in a little boy's body.

As for the DVD, this is a frustrating one. Aside from the pander-to-the-Twilight-fans cover, they've apparently not bothered to add any extras to the DVD. It's a bare-bones release, aside from the polished-up resolution and sound of the movie itself.

Small-town boy Caleb (Pasdar) encounters an ethereal young woman named Mae (Wright) on the street one night. They seem to be shyly hitting it off... until she bites him and leaves.

But then one of them develops a crush on Caleb's kid sister Sarah, and Caleb finds himself torn between his strange new life and his family's safety. Even if he can somehow be cured of his vampirism, can he hope to destroy an entire bloodsucker gang out to kill him?

""Near Dark"" is one of those cult movies that doesn't have a big enough cult -- it gets overshadowed by other 1980s vampire movies like ""Interview with the Vampire"" and ""The Lost Boys,"" despite having little in common with them.

379410,5,6301928555,"""Near Dark"" is a modern masterpiece of vampirism from Kathryn Bigelow, director of ""Strange Days.""  It revolves around adorable country boy Caleb Colton (Adrian Pasdar of ""Heroes"") who falls in love with a pretty vampire, Mae (Jenny Wright of ""I, Madman"").  He will do anything to be with her, except kill.  Think ""Romeo and Juliet"" meets ""Interview With the Vampire.""

  Caleb has been turned into a vampire and is living with a group of nomads.  He must kill and feed upon a human or they will destroy him.  Like Louis of ""Interview With The Vampire,"" he enjoys the mystique of living forever in the night, but the price is too high for him to pay.  Eventually, he is forced to choose between his love of Mae and her ""family"" and his love for his human family.

  Provocative and engrossing, ""Near Dark"" is action packed from beginning to end.  The body count is high.  It is exciting to see how Mae and her ""family"" feed at night along the desert highways of the Southwest.  The special effects are awesome.  Most notable scenes are the beer joint massacre and the ensuing hotel shootout between the vampires and the local sheriff's department.  The ending is quite shocking and fiery.

  ""Near Dark"" is an extremely enjoyable horror film with a strong element of romance.  It is highly recommended viewing for anyone who has ever dreamed or fantasized about becoming a vampire.  Don't!!

  Anchor Bay has done an excellent job of releasing ""Near Dark.""  It is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  The picture and audio quality are pristine.  There is commentary from director Kathryn Bigelow.  Strangely enough, there is no trailer (and no movie poster replica inside my keep case).

the movie gives us nothing to work with.  caleb, the main character, is a complete moron from the first scene, and his vampire girlfriend mae is hopeless in a poorly-written role.  the group of vampire criminals commit idiotic violent acts and manage to outwit the police for years, but one dumb country boy can bring the entire gang down?  a blood tranfusion can cure vampirism?  caleb and his father, among all the thousands of motels strung across the midwest, manage to get rooms at the exact same one?  and best of all, when the sun comes up, it comes up in every direction?

i watched most of this movie in fast-forward because the dialogue and acting were so terrible, so forgive me if i get some minor details wrong.  but there are so many problems with timing and transitions between scenes that the movie is just impossible to watch.  One minute, its dark outside, and five minutes later its the middle of the day.  caleb, carrying his sister no less, manages to run miles and miles with the vampires driving after him?  after the shootout at the motel, the police just let them drive away and don't even follow them?  when bill paxton kills someone in a bar, the other bar patrons don't run away?  the bartender shoots caleb instead of bill paxton?  sometimes the vampires immediately burst into flames at the first ray of sunlight, and sometimes they can just run around in the sun while only burning slightly?  and did i mention the magical vampirism cure?  do the film makers even know how much blood is in the human body?  and do they expect us to believe that a transfusion could remove every drop of vampiric blood and replace it with clean blood?  there are so many logical inconsistencies that nothing in the movie makes any sense at all.  the evil vampire gang just seems incompetent at doing anything right, caleb is totally unlikable because he's so stupid, and the other people in the movie (the police, for example) don't do anything at all.

Do you remember when this classic was in theaters when it first came out, I bet most of you really do not. If you do remember you are one of the very few who do because this was in theaters around the same time as the mega popular ""The Lost Boys"". This like that film is all about a young man who is brought into something he didn't really want, and like that film has to protect his family from the family of vampires that are after them. This how ever though is more of a serious film were as the other was more of a over the top/fun type film. Don't get me wrong I love both of these films and consider both of them classics.

The story is all about a young man who is out drinking one night and comes across a young lady who just happens to be a vampire. I guess it is love at first sight because she does not kill him but turns him and convinces her family to take him in. Of course he has to prove him self and the film is all about that scenario, and time after time he tries but his human side keeps him from doing so. Of course there is a lot more to it then that and a lot of really negative stuff happens between him and them and things get great then. This film really doesn't feel like a vampire movie at all but more like a really good dramatic film that just happens to star a family of vampires. I think that the fact this film didn't do well really killed off this type of film from being made again which is a shame. This film did not really play to the usual rules of a vampire movie, I mean other then the day light thing and the blood sucking not much resembles other films in this genre. I even think that the curing thing that happens in this film is excellent, mainly because this is that type of flick.

Eric Red and director Kathryn Bigelow came up with a brilliant screenplay and created one of the most original films in not only vampire cinema history but in film history all together. Not only did this film have a wonderful people working behind the camera but it also had some great actors. The great Lance Henriksen is marvelous as the head of the vampire family, and his no nonsense take of the character really adds a lot to the film. Bill Paxton is brilliant as the wild crazy member of the vampire family who is all about killing people even if it isn't with his teeth. Adrian Pasdar who is the lead of the film and the unlucky guy who gets turned in the beginning does a really good job in this film and is very believable. Jenny Wright who is the love interest of Adrian and is also the one who turned him also turns in a good believable performance. Jenette Goldstein is the co head of the vampire family along side Lance and gives a wonderful performance, her truck scene is great. Tim Thomerson and Marcie Leeds are excellent as Adrian's father and little sister and really tie this film together. Everyone else in the film also deliver as there really aren't any bad performances in it.

The cast is really well put together and they work together marvelously, take the bar scene for instance. This scene in particular is one of the most fascinating scenes I have ever witnessed, me and my brother watched this again the other night and once again we were hooked. I think any body that has the chance should see this movie, especially if you have never seen it before. This set in particular is amazing as it comes with a great booklet, a wonderful audio commentary and a jam packed second disc with a great documentary and more.

379446,5,6301928555,"Near Dark is a very intersting horror movie in every sense of the word ""interesting"", and ""horror"". It's a vampire-western crossover film, combining the charm of Western movie characters with the violence and midnight adrenaline of vampire horror. Here's the skinny:
-Caleb, a likeable Southern guy falls for Mae, a newcomer to his town. While on a ""date"", a kiss turns to a bite that turns Caleb into a vampire. Now he's kidnapped by Mae's vampire clan, featuring the sinister leader, played by Lance Henriksen, alongside the hilarious, rough, vulgar-mouthed and pretty much all-around AWESOME Bill Paxton. And I'm not just worshipping his role because I share first names with him, Bill Paxton dominates in this movie.
-Now, one of the ""interesting"" facets of this movie is the twist. Horror movies are about what happens to people, and while the events in the plot of Near Dark are crucial, the character development is just as vital in this movie as in a comedy or drama movie. You step inside the world of the vampires, learn to love them, or hate them, your pick.
-General Info about the movie:
VIOLENCE AND TERROR: Well, there's no shortage of action in this movie. Just look at the whopping eight and a half minute roadhouse scene to get what I mean. As far as vampire horror goes, there isn't any, real horror to speak of, it's more like an exploitation sorta thing going on as opposed to something chasing you in the desert.
LANGUAGE: Oh man, is this where Bill Paxton comes in. I think there's a good 55 profanities dropped in this film. And it's often used towards the comedic side of everything. As far as comedy goes for slitting a guy's throat with your spurs (yes, the roadhouse scene)
SEX 'N' NUDITY: No nudity or sex to speak of, although those scenes where Caleb's drinking Mae's blood for food will make you go ""Hubba hubba!"", as they are presented rather erotically, shall I say.

THE BOTTOM LINE:
""Near Dark"" possesses a very strange atmosphere to it. There's a very surreal tone to the whole movie, and it's a lot more mystical than you'd expect from what sounds like a Dracula-John Wayne crossover, even though that's technically not what the film is. The ambient music from German band Tangerine Dream only adds to the dreamlike mood. The way the movie's presented in all its surreal glory, makes you feel like you're missing something, even if you've seen the movie several times.
Fortunately, the movie's ending satisfies, and though I won't give it away, made me feel good. Also, there's a bonus disc full of extra features, that offers even more bang for your buck.
Well, if you want a surreal, violent and fast-paced horror movie with odd, ""interesting"" characters that brings something new to the horror table, check this item off the menu. It's a horror movie that offers a main course you'll want to feast off for quite some time! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1216944000,,2895,4.744047619047619

379449,5,6301928555,"Existentialist in an original different twist of the vampire genre, Kathryn Bigelow's ""Near Dark"" is one of the moxt exciting and controversial achievements in horror cinema, a tour de force in action and suspense, a new style for the night creature aesthetics with a ground-breaking, poetical and human portrayal of the struggle of the undead.

The story is a renovated statement : The main character-victim Caleb (Adrian Pasdar) is infected by cute and innocent drifter Mae (jenny Wright), descents to the lowest levels of indignity and basic desires, desperatly fights the moral battle over the lost humanity, and finally rises from hell to protect his loved ones against his adoptive new ""gang"": Portrayed as dusty outlaws and renegades criminals reunited as a dysfunctional family drifting the southern deserts in a van , the badass evil creatures can't actually be more human, not only in looks but in  the most darkest and contradictory side of  sociopathy. They hide from the painful burning damage of sunlight during the day  with desperate ingenuity , and prey for human blood at night using both clever and brutal methods depending on each character. They despise society and only care for each other, as it shows in the disturbing and bloody ""Pub"" massacre.

So why such a deep, conflictive, disturbing and outstanding piece of work, a nightmarish soulless  story of hellish mayhem didn't succed with audiences like its inferior nemesis and paralel 1987 release, Joel Schumacher's ""Lost Boys""? The answer seems obvious: The almost total lack of vampire imagery on ""Near Dark"", with a new non-gothic asthetic that emphasizes in the devastating symptoms of the disease instead of abusing the usual graphic standard of wings and fangs. ""Lost Boys"" vampires are way cooler, haunting from the air with their incredibly creepy Salem's Lot morphing faces with colorful and atractive biker teenage style. That graphic impact trascended more on collective imagery than the more mutant humans running scared of the incinerating sun. Ask Buffy or Blade. The publicity, cast, and soundtrack did the trick too. Regardless, Lance Henriksen and Bill Paxton are creepier superior night creatures in other most shocking aspects, and the Tangerine Dream haunting score prevails over other FM hits.

This most shocking and provoking ultra-violent vision of K. Bigelow is way more stronger, but somehow less efective for the average fan. The diversity of character-creatures using weapons and dressing like western outlaws, vicious and evil but constantly and desperatly struggling against time and sunlight,  along  with ""food"" issues, was the greatest but at the same time most dissapointing theme. The dramatic quest for safety during day is the more original, astonishing and graphic factor, but the expected imagery is unavoidable. Besides that point,  this movie prevails as a  monumental force in the vampire genre, in wich darkness and  blood are the agonizing fountain of a condemned life.

In this movie, the price to pay for inmortality is way too overwhelming and cruel, transforming the human soul in an indifferent, alienated, and needy killing machine that has no alternative but to become in a self-aware  monster, in order to bear and endure the terrible curse of vampirism throught every excrutiating and ""deadly"" day. Night is coming, beware of this shocking, raw and sadistic nightmare, the finest epic portrayal of moral struggle and redemption, fear of the light and torture, a claustrophobic chapter in history of vampire cinema.",1207440000,4,3544,5.282918149466192

Co-written (with Eric Red) and directed by future Oscar winner Kathryn Bigelow, this film centers on a country boy, Caleb (Adrian Pasdar) who meets a sweet, sexy blonde, Mae (Jenny Wright) and finds that he has, if you'll pardon me using this expression, bitten off more than he can chew when an innocent game of ""I'll take you home if you'll kiss me"" turns into something else altogether.  Caleb finds himself ""turned"" and torn between his new craving and his aversion to killing (he relies on Mae to satisfy his new need, which does not sit well with the rest of her Wennebago-driving clan).

Set in the desert, filmed almost entirely at night, the atmosphere is stunning and one of a kind.  The performances by the leads (Bill Paxton, Lance Henrieksen, Jenette Goldstein and Joshua Miller as well) are second to none, particularly for what you normally expect in this genre.  It is utterly unique, eschewing all the traditional vampire ""rules"" except for the fact that they only go out at night and can be killed by sunlight or fire.  Also, the aforementioned v-word is never spoken in the actual movie.

In closing, let me repeat once more:  If you are a true vampire film fan, ADD. THIS. TO. YOUR. COLLECTION.

It had not stuck with me, which means it had not made an impression on me. It is really not a bad film at all; it concerns a small band of vampires who, either by choice or by compulsion, live as nomads in the American south. One of them, Mae (played by the beautiful Jenny Wright), takes a chance on love with an unsuspecting cowboy, Caleb (played by Dixie Chick Natalie Maines' husband, Adrian Pasdar). Caleb doesn't take to vampirism very well, but is compelled by physical necessity to join the merry band. Meanwhile, Caleb's father (Tim Thomerson) and younger sister (Marcie Leeds) scour the countryside in search of him. Will the reluctant vampire choose love eternal with Mae or return to his birth family? This film is more romance than horror film, which does not necessarily make it a bad film. Among horror legends, the vampire certainly lend itself better to romance than any other creature. Unlike the gothic ""Interview with the Vampire,"" however, ""Near Dark"" offers the bizarre combination of an American South setting (fortunately without much country music), a classic horror creature and New Age music by German electronic group Tangerine Dream. The result is a moderately successful film that would be more easily digestible if it offered some scary moments, which, unfortunately, it does not. There is some violence and some bloodshed, but really not enough to satisfy the average horror fan. If the romantic aspect of vampirism appeals to you, you would probably enjoy this film. The performances are all quite good (Bill Paxton is annoying as usual), and Kathryn Bigelow's direction is uniformly fine.

379494,4,6301928555,"This is the best modern (although now 20 years old) vampire story filmed to date. It has nothing to do with Dracula or gothic horror, but instead reimagines vampires in a modern setting as a group of outlaws living on the edge of society.

Essentially the film is a love story. A farm hand Caleb is snared by the lovely Mae and then becomes a reluctant member of the gang. However he has problems becoming one of them... One of the key scenes in the film is where the gang take Caleb to a bar so that he can kill for the first time. This scene is brilliantly shot and truly scary and funny at the same time.

Some of the rules of traditional vampire movies are thrown out of the window so although the vampires can't go out into direct sunlight, if they black out the windows in the house or van they are able to survive in daylight (a lovely touch is that if exposed to direct sunlight they catch fire). Theres no reference to crosses or holy water and essentially its not a good and evil story - these vampires are just trying to survive.

The cast are excellent, with perhaps Bill Paxton taking the honours as the very scary Severen. If you haven't seen this, you've missed one of the best modern horror films of all. Certainly you should see it before the remake which is coming out next year.",1191542400,,1297,4.307377049180328
379495,5,6301928555,"Love bites! Love bleeds!

Tell it to bored Okie farmboy Caleb (Adrian Pasdar): for him, it's the oldest story in the world & the one he's looking for on a Saturday night:

Boy meets Girl. Boy wins Girl. Boy takes Girl to tractor pull.

But he doesn't figure on the special sauce. Nobody does.

That little modification throws in some groovy new beats to the mix: Girl Bites Boy. Girl leaves godawful nasty hickey on Boy's neck.

And, about an hour later: Boy lurches over tobacco fields in the Lower 40 with a hankering for meat considerably rarer than ground round.

I think it was the old vampire fighter Professor Abraham Van Helsing who observed of his undead foes ""the Dead travel fast"".

That was 1897: he shoulda got a load of the white trash bloodsuckers in Kathryn Bigelow's riotous ""Near Dark"", where the Undead ditch their long-haired gypsy servants & wagons for some real horsepower, muscling up and sunlight-proofing a Winnebago and carrying out a rampage of cold-blooded (or warm-blooded, or blooded, anyway, which is the point) killing spree across the windswept badlands.

Director Kathryn Bigelow & screenwriter Eric Red beat Tarentino & Rodriguez to the pop culture punch by more than a decade in this blood-drenched fusion of Southwestern Vampires and the joys of the tri-state killing spree, done right & done hard: ""Near Dark"" is a nihilistic little cinematic IED of battery acid, Semtex charge, sweat, rage, sex & desperation, all wrapped up in spikes & roadworn leather.

Breaking up may be hard to do, but it's murder if your lovely young pallid drifter hottie-of-the-moment Mae (the ethereal Jenny Wright, who vies with the flick's Tangerine Dream soundtrack for most dreamy movie presence here) has a family with a real aversion to laying down stakes.

No, literally.

Anyway, Caleb flees from what he is becoming, the Family follows, & the Law hunts all of them.

""Near Dark"" is a child of the Night, no doubt, but even more it's a child of the eighties, a country-cousin (the one who mainlines white-lightning) to blood-soaked eighties stalwarts like ""The Hitcher"" and ""Lost Boys"": the snarling white-trash bloodsucker of the film's windswept Oklahoma hellscape has more in common with the mass murderering duo of ""Badlands"" than with the mincing machinations of Underworld's Eurotrash vamps or castrati courtliness of a Lestat.

That's what's cooking in ""Near Dark"": the vamps here are monsters. They're scary. They're a little feral. They stink of Death & the weary, endless blacktop. The tragically hip vamp of modern cinema is a fashion victim too hip to kill, too busy trying to Emo you to death to ever get around to killing you.

Not so with the nosferatu from ""Near Dark"", who offer up a different breed of bat: they're hungry, for one. They dispense with the Bau Haus & haute couture in favor of razor blades and sawed off shotguns; they worry more about running blood and less about running black mascara.

Bigelow raided James Cameron's casting wardrobe for her crack cast, & here it pays off: Paxton, Henriksen, & Vasquez form up the old Aliens trifecta and cook up a little downhome bloodletting attitude.

Bigelow's underworld is an unforgettable nightland of all-night diners and truckstops and endless blacktop lit up by neon and arc-sodium and flickering, hissing fluorescent, where you look half dead even if you're still trucking around your 5 quarts of red slosh, baby.

There's something breathtaking about the way Bigelow squares and stages and fixes her action: the steady waltz of doom and sadness and savagery in the bar-scene to the strains of ""the Cowboy Rides Away"", for one, possibly the first time in history sheer infinite boredom caused a barfight, which midwifes a slaughter.

Or the Siege: the riveting syncopation of the blackpowder ballet as M16 bullets tear holes in walls of seedy motel flop where the vamps have holed up and dug in after their latest killing spree, death borne not of the bullets but the rents of sunlight they unleash on the room-temperature desperados.

""Near Dark"" is as cool as the tailfin on a Shelby cobra, but it's not all empty style: there's an overarching sense of awe front and center, whether it's the stark & sere emptiness of its midwestern urban badlands, haunted by its own faded fallowness, or the hard-bitten ghoulishness of its monsters. It's the landscape, in fact, that becomes almost a central character here, spinning out its own calculus in crafting the food that drifts across this dusty backstage Night Land and the predators who hunt them.

There are vampires---& then there are vampires.

And the worst of them take more than your blood.

379496,4,6301928555,"Near Dark is a vampire film with a look and feel unlike your typical fang-fest: daylight is harsh and painful, while the quicksand-lull of shadows by night are at once sharp and surreal, altering the landscape and ensnaring the viewer unawares.

Co-written by Eric Red (writer of the original ""The Hitcher"") and Kathryn Bigelow (director of ""Strange Days""), this film is a taut, smart and surly Western Vampire flick that still stands up to - and surpasses - today's standards of chop and spray film-making (thank goodness). This was a film with a vision, evolving out of the mid-80s when film-makers were still taking chances and the genres of old were a-changing. These are no walking corpses in molding black capes, hiding in coffins and dodging wooden stakes. These vampires mean business and the landscape in which they travel is as cruel and as unrelenting and as personable as are they.

Charactor development, the look and feel of the piece, plot, and snappy dialogue are those things that matter in Near Dark. If you're going to make a horror film, by god, make the thing. And the cast/crew/creators of Near Dark did just that.

I was a pre-teen when I first saw Near Dark, back in the late 80s. No movie before or since has left me with such an eerie memory of intensity, pain, and ... strangely enough given the subject matter ... a giddy sort of hope. As a kid the infamous ""bar scene"" nearly did me in, and provided fodder for nightmares this fearless horror-film watcher didn't think were possible. For years, just remembering that scene, was enough to keep me passing it by in the rental aisles.

But, being the admirer I am of many of the central cast in Near Dark, I couldn't stay away for long, and so I rewatched it with adult eyes. It was even better than I'd remembered it. I'm not ashamed to say I had to buy my own copy, which I watch every couple of months.

There is the naive and flirtacious Caleb Colten, perfectly cast in Adrian Pasdar (who plays the polar opposite in the deliciously wicked ""Jim Profit"" in the tv show ""Profit"", also now available on dvd) who meets the at once simple",1182470400,3,2113,4.594164456233422

Anyway though this movie does go above so many other vampire films made today. It definitely gives its own unique view on vampires. I was a huge fan of Anne Rice's romantic, suffering vampires but watching this film where instead the vampires are dusty and completely cruel to their victims without any air of sophistication gave it a much more real and frightening view on such creatures.

The cast carry out their parts well, but its truly Paxton that steals the show. He is the most cruel of them all, and the loudest. Right away he just steals the show. The others kind of fade compared to him, but quiet Mae, the complete opposite of Severen, holds her own candle on the show. And yes, you do root for her and Caleb, who is roped into being a vampire thanks to her seduction.

A dark, harsh and powerful movie about vampires that matches to the maturity of Interview with the Vampire, yet with a complete new view on their lifestyle. I highly recommend it if you can find it.

But at its heart, I'd argue, there's nonetheless a disabling weakness, a weakness the screenwriter/director oddly enough identifies on Disc 2 as the film's particular glory. I refer to the mixing of the genres of western, horror and romance which leads here, not to a memorable original vision, but instead an indigestible mixture.
The western and horror elements together are not so much a problem as is the intrusion of romance into these realms. Pondering the outcome, one begins to question, for instance, the justice in the screenwriter's finally saving any of the actually murderous vampires. The rationale seems no deeper than the arbitrary decision that the conventions of romance be allowed to trump at this point those of the horror genre.

379501,4,6301928555,"I find that usually, vampire tales - whether filmed or written - have to have a large dose of grandeur and mystique to the vampires to make them work (the ""Underworld"" movies; ""Blood: The Last Vampire"", various successful incarnations of Dracula, etc.)  Even ""From Dusk Til Dawn"", which was anything but a traditional take on the vampire, had the creatures so monstrously impressive and in some cases so exotically alluring (ex. Salma Hayek), that Dusk sort of fit the bill too, in some weird way.

  The ploar opposite of the 'grand' depiction of the vampire is one that was very prevelant in the 90s and still turns up quite often today.  The 'lowlife' vampire, with many of the supernatural aspects played down, the charisma and the mystery often missing, very human in appearance at all times, riding around in beat-up old cars and vans, and spending the daylight hours in cheap motels or the basements of bars instead of in eerier, more impressive haunts.  Most of the movies in this vein I haven't really cared for (although ""The Forsaken"" - heavily influenced by the movie I'm now writing about, was a pretty good watch)  But one movie in this vein - and I believe it was the first of its kind - really stands out, and that's ""Near Dark"".

  Basically, a farm kid (played by Adrian Pasdar) of about - what, maybe 18 or so? - falls in love with a girl (Jenny Wright) of his own physical age, before learning she's a vampire.  Wanting to be free of the vampiric curse, the pair is aided by the boyfriend's father in an attempt to become human again, which leads them into conflict with her 'coven' - a clan of not particularly awe-inspiring, but scary, believable and highly dangerous vampires led by Lance Henrikson in one of his best roles.  Well-made, gory, and emotionally-driven (romantic, even) ""Near Dark"" flies right to the top of its class and carries a feeling of authenticity with it - the diner scene nails the 'injecting the horrific into the everyday' theme to perfection.

This is evident in that each actor and actress gave a top career performance.

At the break of dawn, the girl becomes increasingly worried, and the boy asks for a kiss. She obliges with a passionate, tonguey display, and then she bites him on the throat.

With this, the fantastic neo-vampire western Near Dark begins. The cast is an '80s/early '90s sci-fi fan's wet dream (well, almost), featuring Lance Henrikson, Bill Paxton, and Jenette Goldstein, who collectively appeared in Aliens, Alien3, The Terminator, and Terminator 2: Judgement Day.

Almost all your basic vampire elements are here: throat-biting, blood-sucking, fear of daylight, eternal life, etc. However, the bloodsuckers don't have fangs, capes, or pale white skin (which actually doesn't make much sense), and there's never any reference to not having reflections. Instead, the vampires are basically modern southern folk, but obviously with a dark side. It is made quite apparent throughout the film, however, that they have been around for quite some time, as it is mentioned that they started the great Chicago fire and that one of them fought for the South in the Civil War. The vampire clan includes Jessie (Henrikson), the oldest (on the outside) and the wise leader of the group; Diamondback (Goldstein), apparently Jessie's girlfriend (of many years); Severen (Paxton), the leather-clad bada*s of the group; Mae (Wright), the innocent young female of the group; and Homer (Miller), a young boy on the outside but the oldest of them all on the inside.

These characters offer plenty of fun interactions and one-liners, but this is no horror comedy. There is a considerable amount of very bloody violence, including a scene (probably the most memorable one in the film) where the clan visits a bar and subsequently murders all of its patrons. To give you an idea of just what kind of violence we're talking about here, I'll just say that Jessie orders a beer, and when the waitress brings it out, he says ""Just the glass."" The waitress' throat is then slit, and Jessie drains her blood into the glass like it's on tap during happy hour.

The acting is competent and the cinematography is gorgeous (and very similar to that of The Terminator and Aliens). Director Kathryn Bigelow creates a bleak landscape for the film, filling the sky with either blue/green night, purple/red sunset, teal/orange sunrise, or dessicated daylight.

Near Dark is a notable and very well-made horror film that stands the test of time. But guess what, a superflous remake is in the works! I bet it'll be absolutely fantastic!

However, I bit the bullet and went ahead because I appreciate Tim Thomerson, Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen (especially) and Jenette Goldstein.

I was pleasantly surprised. It captured a mood I dearly love, of that sparsely-populated midnight hour, with the ghostly blue glow of streetlamps and nothing else for as far as the eye can see, and a very ""80s"" vibe, as well, by which I do not mean an excess of poofy hair, clothing of 18,000 colours, jacket sleeves pushed past elbows, Madonna and Cyndi Lauper.

Not to criticize any of these things (as that would be irrelevant to this review)...but more of a sort of midpoint between the pretty raw 70s (...and there I'm disincluding the disco portion) and the much more slick 90s. A sort of high level of technology (rich colour in film) from later, and yet the lack of gloss (high  shutter speeds, a little-TOO-crystal clarity) of earlier. A personal favourite ""feel"" for films.

Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the performances of everyone involved in the film, and felt myself drawn strongly enough to Caleb, despite my prejudicial bias toward Lance, generally a good sign if someone can draw me from an actor I know to one I don't in terms of sympathy.

The ""non-vampire"" sort of vampire ideology is one I've seen before (the ""never say 'vampire'"" is similar to romero's ""(almost) never say 'zombie'"") but still maintains its interest. The scenes everyone seems to mention, the shootout (very reminisicent of westerns as Red and Bigelow originally desired to film) and the bar scene were quite impressive, as was the makeup and general costuming (but then I AM a sucker for dusters).

Truly a fascinating and different approach to a creature/monster/thing/entity/whatever that I tend to feel is fairly tired (granted; I do own The Lost Boys, Fright Night and a few others all the same).

PS:

Darkknight here references a ""loss of picture"" on this Widescreen DVD.

THERE IS NO PICTURE LOST.

Is there more picture on (full-frame) VHS releases? YES.

Why?

""Soft-matting.""

Soft-matting is when a film is recorded in fully exposed 1.33:1 framed film, taking up the entirety of each frame in the film.

The ""matting"" refers to the process of adding the black bars for the theatrical release--""soft"" because they are added to a pre-existing larger picture, as opposed to ""hard"" where they are added DURING filming by affixing an attachment to the lens that blocks off the top and bottom of it.

When they do full-frame releases of soft-matted movies, they do it the easy way, the way that doesn't take the work of pan and scan (finding the focus of the film's frames as it goes) and the way that does not result in picture loss. Thus the ""extra"" picture on the VHS release of Near Dark.

HOWEVER: this top and bottom film was generally NOT intended to be seen by the director. Most films were not and are not made with video releases in mind (mind you, there ARE exceptions, James Cameron apparently intentionally frames things so that both 1.33:1 AND 1.85:1 aspect ratios will work for his films) and so the final, matted, ""widescreen"" version is the INTENDED VERSION by the director.

Pee-Wee's Big Adventure is the most notorious example of this, wherein multiple gags/effects are ""ruined"" (in a surreal film like that, this is arguable, but they were NOT given away in the matted version of the film, so originally it was not INTENDED) by the removal of the black bars that matte the film.

Other instances result in the appearance of boom-mikes, cables, shadows and other objects which should not be seen and can result in a ruination of the suspension of disbelief.

So, be warned. More picture is not always more ""correct,"" anymore than widescreen is always more picture or is always the ""intended"" version.",1112918400,9,3875,4.860182370820668
379573,5,6301928555,"NEAR DARK is one of those rare films that somehow creeps forth, and escapes the sanitized glitter of hollywood. We are treated to a band of roaming nightmonsters, played to perfection by a dream-cast of nobodies (at least in 1987). Lance Henriksen (Aliens, Pumpkinhead) is Jesse, the leader and father figure of the group. Jenette Goldstein (Aliens, T2) plays Diamondback, the ""mother"" with a nack for slitting throats. Bill Paxton (Aliens, Titanic) is Severen, the leather-clad killer who is a demonic force with a true sense of glee. He enjoys killing and feasting on human prey! Josh Mitchell is Homer, a little kid on the outside, an old man within. He's pretty scary, especially since he kills without conscience! Jenny Wright is Mae, the young, beautiful girl who messes things up royally by falling for a human, and turning  him into an undead. Caleb (Adrian Pasdar) is that human, a texas cowpoke who now finds himself unable to eat human food or stay out in daylight without melting. He is captured by Jesse and company, runs away, and reluctantly rejoins them when he realizes that he can't make it in the world of mortals. Mae keeps him alive by allowing him to drink from her veins. Caleb is given a week to make his first kill, or face the consequences of being a drag on the group. NEAR DARK is bleak and sinister in it's portrayal of this drifting anti-family of blood-drinkers. Paxton is the most violent and ruthless, making sport out of murder. The bar scene is his show-stopper! Anyone who thinks of Bill Paxton as that goofy, but loveable guy from Twister or Titanic MUST see this! You'll never see him (or spurs) in the same light again! I believe this sequence was a direct influence on Cameron's T2 bar scene. I mean, the first guy to get knocked across the room (by Caleb) also played the biker in T2 who puts his cigar out on Arny's chest! This movie is a ghoulish, explosively violent tribute to low-budget horror done right. There's even a love story in there somewhere!

379574,5,6301928555,"In 1987, two vampire movies were released. The teen audience went to see ""The Lost Boys""; the older audience went to see ""Near Dark"". Perhaps unfortunately, more people went to see ""Lost Boys"" than ""Near Dark"", forcing the latter to drop off the face of the earth for years. Until 2002, actually. DVD wonder company Anchor Bay released a 2-disc special edition of the film, prompting a new generation of horror fans to investigate the film. One of them was me.

The biggest problem with ""Near Dark"" is that it is somewhat pointless until the end of the film; there is little or no story at all. The film begins with young Texan Caleb (Adrian Pasdar), who wants more than anything to leave Texas - until he meets beautiful yet mysterious Mae (Jenny Wright). Predictably, Mae is a vampire - and after Caleb attempts to score with her, she accidentally brings him across into the world of the undead. Now, while being hunted by his worried father and young sister, Caleb is forced to join a band of evil vampires, of which Mae travels with.

That's just about the whole story.

This film is another dated eighties film - but then again, most films of the decade were dated. Tangerine Dream, a popular 80's band, contributes the very fine, sometimes creepy score. The cast is very good - particularly Lance Henriksen, who is great as the leader of the vampires, and Bill Paxton, who is awesome as the ""fun""-loving vampire Severen.

Kathryn Bigelow, who most recently directed ""K-19: The Widowmaker"", directs and co-writes this film. Her direction is one of the highlights of the film, which is very dark but in some bizarre way, poetic. The script is something of a mix between violent horror and dramatic western - which works out well in creating an eerie vampire film.

The biggest question, other than how good the film is, is would I have gone to see ""Lost Boys"" or ""Near Dark""? I have to answer both. They are both excellent films, two of the very best featuring vampires, and it's hard to choose which is my favorite. ""Lost Boys"" had a mixture of teenage style and pre-teen humor, while ""Near Dark"" has a mixture of bloody violence and dark drama. Both are great, and I'll leave it to you to decide which is the better film.",1104364800,4,2227,4.613636363636363
379575,4,6301928555,"Caleb ( Adrain Passar) is a young and naive man living in Texas. One night he sees Mae ( Jenny Wright). She is everything that Caleb could want in a girl, except for the fact that she is a vampire. Caleb is soon seduced and then bitten by her. With the sun rising, and his skin beginning to burn, Caleb is thrust into a world that you can only see after dark. Mae belongs to a vampire clan who is led by a soldier from the civil war named Jesse ( Lance Henricksen), The rest of the pack contains an extremely sadistic ladies' man named Severn ( Bill Paxton), a beautiful and violent mother figure named Diamondback (Jenette Goldstien), and an old man trapped in the body of a 10 year old named Homer ( Joshua John Miller). This group of nightstalkers are not suceptable to the old legends of crosses, holy water, etc, and only see humans as food. Now Caleb has a week to make two choices. One is to make a kill and become one of them. The other is to do nothing and be killed himself.

The film's initial release suffered when it was brought out mere weeks after ""The Lost Boys"". Both have a similar story of a young man being brought into a clan of immortals against his will. "" Lost Boys"" had a popular and well known cast, as well as Richard Donner directing. ""The Lost Boys"" may have grossed more at the box-office, and the film may be more popular, but ""Near Dark"" is far superior to its archrival, and is perhaps the greatest vampire film ever made. The vampires in this film are extremely violent and sadistic. They rely on more than just their vampire powers, and use guns , knifes, etc. This adds more action and firepower to the film. When director Kathryn Bigelow decided to go ahead with the movie, she also wanted no mention of the actual word "" vampire"". The characters do not spend time analyzing the life that they have lived for years. There is no need to marvel at their powers or abilities, and the word ""vampire"" does just that. The film is extremely gory and has amazing special effects too. The infamous bar scene is by far the best scene in the film and it will amaze you. The script is amazing, and offers killer dialogue like ""finger lickin good"". This causes the film to be extremely funny at times.

The peformances are what set this film apart. The cast of ""Aliens"" shines here. Lance Henricksen, and Bill Paxton give the best roles of their careers. The violence and horror they display are surprisingly frightening and realistic. They bring the role of being a vampire more down to earth, and make it less supernatural. Adrian Passar is outstanding. I love his naive behavior towards what he is. The inner conflict that he must face between choosing his regular family, and his new family is emotional to watch. Jenny Wright, Joshua John MIller, and Jenetter Goldstien are also outstanding. While the characters are frightening, they also bring a sense of emotion to the film with how they live and act like one big family. Kind of like the "" blood sucking Brady Bunch.""

Overall Near Dark was almost a perfect film. The performances that were given in this movie, combined with the unique view it takes on the vampire genre made Near Dark an extremely enjoyable movie. However, there was one major flaw with this movie that got under my skin. The one consistency with the vampire genre, has been that once you are a vampire, there is no cure. Near Dark's main strength is that it offers an original take on the vampire genre. But it also happens to be the film's weakness in this case as well. In the film, a person who is a vampire, is able to return to being human with a simple blood transfusion. After watching the stuggle that Caleb went through, it was frustrating to see the problem go away so easily. The film should have stuck with the one rule of there being no cure for vampirism. The DVD is amazing, and definately worth the money. The 47 minute documentary "" Living In Darkness"" features Adrian Passar, Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen, Jenette Goldstien, and director Kathryn Bigelow. It is nice to watch the stars of the film comment on their characters, working with each other, and their overall difficulty of shooting. You also get deleted scenes, and much more.

First of all, its got a great cast, which ranges from ""Wild"" Bill Paxton and Lance Henrickson to the very creepy Joshua Miller. Some of the other actors are not as lively, but all give a good run. There is a prize for spotting the police officer who has a bit of a walk on (Warning: Prize may not actually exist.)

Overall, this movie delivers. At times its so dark that you can feel your skin moving, and in others its funny enough to make you spray popcorn into your drink. Some really good one-liners add zest to some excellent quality dialogue. For all the Interview with the vampires fans out there, check out the close similiarity between the ""old man"" and Claudia. One is much creepier than the other!

The only down side of the movie is the ending.  I will not spoil it for those who might be persuaded to enjoy this movie, but it is a little silly. Overall, it does not ruin the movie, just stopped it from getting more stars.  Certain things to look out for are, the fire scene, nightclub fun with spurs and the vampire method of car improvement.

This is a very original vampire movie, and is wonderfully filmed, but has a few shortcomings.

Caleb seemed like a pushy pervert in his first night out with Mae and their romance seemed to just form up out of the blue. Same thing with transfusions. It takes about 2 minutes of the whole movie and seemed overly rushed.

And little Homer, ugh what an annoying kid. No wonder i don't remember seeing him in other movies...

And the ending is a bit anti climatic considering how these hundred year old vampires die. I thought they would be a bit smarter and have more common sense being alive that long...

But where the movie really shines is with Bill Paxton. His character, Severn, steals the whole show. The S**t kicker slaughter is truly a memorable scene and shows Paxton at his finest.

379580,5,6301928555,"The year 1987 was kind to horror film lovers, producing a double-shot of vampire thrillers: The Lost Boys and Near Dark. The former's MTV-friendly soundtrack, coupled with then heartthrobs Jason Patric and Kiefer Sutherland, resulted in the latter's box office demise, sending this darker, gorier film into video rental purgatory for many years.

However, Kathryn Bigelow's vampire western struck a chord with the few who saw it and over the years, the movie developed a gradually intensifying cult following. This devotion has finally paid off - Anchor Bay, champions of resurrecting uncelebrated horror films, has produced a wonderful two-disc set that this film and its fans deserve.

For a 15 year old movie, Near Dark looks and sounds remarkable. The image is somewhat gritty (which actually lends itself to the film's atmosphere), but this is due to grainy film stock used as a result of budgetary constraints, not because of a substandard transfer. After watching it for years on a washed out panned and scanned VHS tape, this new transfer - restoring the film's original 1.85:1 aspect ratio - is a revelation. Anchor Bay has also included a crystal clear DTS audio track. Since the film's modest budget did not afford it surround sound, most of the audio is reserved to the front three speakers. Regardless, major points to the folks at Anchor Bay for the attempt.

The first disc features a lacklustre audio commentary by the film's director and co-screenwriter, Kathryn Bigelow. While she makes some nice observations and is rightly proud of the film, her comments are few and far between on the track.

The second disc contains the rest of the supplemental material, which includes two trailers for Near Dark, a deleted scene with commentary from Bigelow, storyboards for five sequences in the film, still galleries, and the most important extra for fans: a 47-minute documentary, entitled ""Living in Darkness,"" created especially for the DVD.

Bigelow and most of the cast participate in this documentary, and talk candidly and enthusiastically about the film's origins, how the cast came together, the process of making the movie and their thoughts on it now. Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen, in particular, share some fascinating (and often hilarious) anecdotes of their experiences making Near Dark. It is obvious that this project was a labour of love for everyone involved.

For longtime fans of Near Dark - your wait is over and you're bein richly rewarded. For others who are looking to take leave of the usual vampire fare - this movie is well worth more than a casual look.",1092614400,7,2594,5.049065420560748

Less lyrical and foppish than Anne Rice's offerings made to movies, Near Dark was a sleeper when it came out.  With amusing effects by today's standards, it never the less conveyed an excellent story of civil war era vampires traveling about in an RV through Texas unleashing their mayhem when thirsty.  When young dude ranch dude Caleb falls for Mae, he doesn't know what he's getting into as she baptizes him into the world of the night where he must feed or die for all time.  The love nest is upset by her running mates including a whacked out Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, the little kid from River's Edge, and the gal who's always in James Cameron movies as the `mom' figure.  An excellent soundtrack by Howard Shore who would later do the Rings trilogy drives and comments on the action.  There are haunting and beautiful moments expressed through the eyes of Caleb and Mae.  Her look of hunger-lust is frightening when she crawls over Caleb to bite him the first time. Overall a decent, underrated entry to the cinema vampire canon.",1091318400,,1111,4.637755102040816

This film is beautifully filmed and edited. The acting is strong, and the story holds you from the beginning to the end.
Certainly, the bar room scene is a classic; it, alone, makes the film worthwhile. But, don't get me wrong, the entire film is masterfully handled and should be applauded. If nothing else, it has some of the greatest one liners ever spoken in a horror film.
Near Dark deserves to be seen. I can't believe I never heard of it before. I just happened to see it in Wal Mart and picked it up. This film is definitely one of my best impulse buys ever.

Young Caleb (Adrian Pasdar) meets Mae ( a young, Jenny Wright from ""St. Elmos Fire"" and ""Garp""). Passion ensues and Mae ""nips"" Caleb.

Caleb tries to fit in but just can't seem to get the ""killin' part down"".
His father, Loy (Tim Thomerson) and little sister, Sarah (Marcie Leeds from ""Beaches"") are searching for Caleb.  Will they find him in time?  Watch for yourself and find out!
Another cool thing that I noticed is when Caleb staggers through town, before he goes to the bus stop to try and get home, the cinema behind him is showing ""Aliens"" which also featured Paxton, Henriksen and Goldstein.

Near Dark happens to look like a James Cameron horror movie, and saying this should not discredit Bigelow because here we see a female director on flying form. Near Dark not only has Bigelow at the helm, but Eric Red produced and wrote it. The cinematographer is Adam Greenberg who got the Terminator into the film can and we also have two other Cameron favorites in the mix - Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen. So if 1980s are early 1990s Cameron is your cup of blood then Near Dark is exactly what you want to see.
This movie is dirt cheap but done so well that it can only be described as a very beautiful motion picture film to look at even though it is set in the dusty mid-west. Basically it is an amalgamation of cowboys, vampires, rockers, bikers, vampire sickness and love. This could have been a really cheesy B-Movie if it wasn't for such a catchy script, set design, LIGHTING!, special effects, acting and direction. The music is the kind of early synthesizer stuff that John Carpenter would play until the wee hours of the dawn.
Basically the story revolves around a farm hand that gets bit, but not bleed, and ends up bonding with a small family gang of vampires until he can prove that he can make that first kill. In meantime his dad and younger sister are combing the state looking for him. The film is not so quickly moving but like Bigelow's ""Point Break"" there is enough substance and action here to keep you going with several extremely memorable scenes - namely the bar slaughter, a shoot out involving daylight penetrating bullet holes in the walls and the ending with a kid bursting into flames as the sun comes up. For 1987 this horror packs a punch and deserves its cult status. Bill Paxton's character is a riot and Lance Henriksen has never looked more disfigured. The film may falter at times into very weird love scenes and some strange exsanguinations finales, but for all intensive purposes this is really a superb horror movie that is certainly worthy of repeat viewings. It is also pretty bloody at times and not for the squeamish.
Near Dark gets a really big thumb up from this reviewer who has seen it plenty of times since the somewhat unnoticed cinema release.

379628,4,6301928555,"Let's get one thing straight, Near Dark is a vampire movie.  With that being said, it breaks almost all the rules when it comes to vampire movies....  There is almost no mention of religon (Except a hotel name and a hanging crucifix, both of which have to be pointed out in the extensive booklet that comes with this DVD to even be noticed), the vamps don't sleep in coffins or by hanging upside down, nobody tries to drive a stake through anybody's heart, and you can forget about garlic.  Basically the only way to kill these vamps is by sunlight.  Oh and boy does sunlight mess them up, unlike other vampire movies just seconds in the light horribly burns these vamps and then they catch fire and quickly explode... no drawn-out deaths as seen in other movies.
The story of the movie is as follows, Caleb (Adrian Pasdar) is a southwesterner who hits-on and convinces to take a ride with him, the beautiful Mae (Jenny Wright).  Mae you can tell is kinda different, although you get a real vibe that she is lonely (KEY to the story).  After attempting to kiss Mae, Mae insists Caleb take her home (To her RV camped out in a local trailer park).  Caleb manages to convince her otherwise and things get romantic, in the heat of the moment Mae bites Caleb and then disgusted by herself runs off into the night leaving Calen wondering what's going on...  Caleb's truck breaks down forcing him to walk home, yet he begins to feel ill and then gets caught in the sun and his skin starts to burn.  Just as Caleb is in sight of his house and his little sister/father (Now staggering/crawling his way home), an RV pulls up and someone pulls him in.  The RV drives off leaving Caleb's family wondering what just happened.
In the RV you meet the family of vamps... Jesse (Lance Henriksen of later Alien Fame and the father figure), Severen (Bill Paxton, the wild-child of the group, and easily the most entertaining character in the movie), Diamondback (Jenette Goldstein, the mother figure), Homer (Joshua Miller, plays the child role), and of course Mae.  What follows is Caleb trying to cope with his new life, the vamps assimilating (Sometimes against their own wishes) Caleb into the clan, Mae caring for/falling in love with Caleb, and Caleb's real family desperatly searching for him.
The action is intense, especially the Roadhouse Slaughterhouse... which will give you gore-hounds your fill.  Although the word ""Vampire"" is never mentioned and this movie hardly follows any of the vampire stereotypes it stands as one of the best vampire movies ever made.  A fan of vampire movies at all?  If so, BUY THIS MOVIE.

The film is shot in what seems the middle of nowhere; and those types of pictures are always attractive.  The acting is quite subtle (except from Bill Paxton, but he had just got done doing ALIENS, what do you expect?).  But this almost silent acting brings a new level to the idea behind vampires.  The Undead, as it were, are characters we enjoy watching and actually root for; despite us knowing too well how the film will inevitably end.  Jenny Wright sets the mood for this film right off the bat.  As innocent and sensual as blond-haired women go--you can't help but want to be bitten by this temptress.

379671,5,6301928555,"Near Dark (Kathryn Bigelow, 1987)
1987 saw the release of two defining modern vampire films. One got a whole lot of press, a huge marketing budget, and made over thirty million dollars in theatrical release (remember, this was 1987, when those were big numbers). The other was Near Dark.
Not to say The Lost Boys isn't a good movie. It's amusing, albeit looking somewhat dated these days. But the rapid-fire mix of horror and comedy that marks The Lost Boys had been done a million times in the previous decade, in pretty much every horror film since Halloween. It was safe ground. Near Dark was anything but. Kathryn Bigelow, in her second big-screen film (the first, a Willem Dafoe movie called The Loveless, has faded so far into obscurity even I haven't been able to track down a copy), wanted to make a good old-fashioned action flick with horror elements. She borrowed about half the cast her then-husband James Cameron had used the year before for Aliens, added in some folks whose stars looked like they were on the rise, took the script from Eric Red (who had penned the similarly chilling screenplay for The Hitcher the year before), and made movie magic.
Caleb (the highly underrated Adrian Pasdar, recently in Secondhand Lions) is a small town boy living a small town life, until he meets Mae (Jenny Wright, whose bit part in Pink Floyd: The Wall is unmistakable). Mae is something like he's never encountered before, but he doesn't find out just how much that's true until it's too late. She nips him while they're making out, and Caleb has no choice but to join Mae's family of vampires (the word ""vampire"" is never used in the film, by the way): Jesse (Lance Henriksen, recently in the TV series Millennium), Diamondback (Jennette Goldstein of Aliens and T2 fame), Severin (Bill Paxton, whose career skyrocketed soon after this), and Homer (the similarly underrated Joshua John Miller, such a treat to watch in both Class of 1999 and River's Edge). Caleb, however, isn't entirely happy with the idea of drinking blood for a living...
Aside from the plethora of names above you either know or should know, if you keep a sharp eye out, you will also notice James Le Gros, a year away from his big break in Drugstore Cowboy; Theresa Randle, an integral part of the Will Smith/Martin Lawrence Bad Boys franchise; Marcie Leeds, who later that decade would make the whole world cry in Beaches; Thomas Wagner, who's become a major character actor (Sea of Love, My Blue Heaven, True Believer, etc.), and many more. The influence of Near Dark has extended far, far beyond its box office gross (it took in about ten percent of the money The Lost Boys did).
Snappy, scary, and speedy, Near Dark is the finest modern vampire film in existence. It has been on my all-time 100-best list as long as that list has been around, and it's not going anywhere. **** ",1070236800,2,2860,4.72

379674,4,6301928555,"I thought I'd seen all I needed to see of vampire films but Bigelow's ""Near Dark"" surprised me.  She set it in the American Southwest, among cowboys, ranchers and vagabonds.  She also came up with some of most visually stunning images of vampires ever put on film, especially of them catching on fire.  Amazingly, she even comes up with a way to redeem the protagonist in the film who was unwillingly made into a vampire.

Writer-director Kathryn Bigelow was a very talented painter before she went to film school to become a movie director.  It shows in her work which is very artistic for someone primarily known to the action-adventure genre of filmmaking.  She is a breath of fresh air in this genre, investing it with literate scripts and haunting imagery.  Her most frequent producer is James Cameron (the action wonder king, ""Titanic,"" ""Terminator""), who is also her ex-husband.  You can see his influence on her work as well.

I know what your thinking, but in Near Dark the ""V"" word is never mentioned; not once.  In fact, most of the usual mythology that goes along with the vampire genre isn't featured here; instead the film is part horror, part western, and thanks to director Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break, K-19: The Widowmaker), the film works.

However, I can't see what seperates it from any other vampire movie.  I was enthralled after the first twenty minutes.  I had never seen a vampire movie where a female vampire could suffer from very human emotions.  And had the movie continued to explore those themes, within the context of Caleb's relationship to May, I would have given it 5 stars.  Instead it becomes like every other movie about vampires-->the neophyte vampire having to make his first kill, and inevitably falling out with his creators: see Interview With the Vampire and The Lost Boys.  Also, as far as edgy, hip, gritty vampire movies go, The Lost Boys was way more entertaining.  Near Dark is the first ""white trash"" vampire movie, but the issues of class are really never explored.  Is the next cult vampire movie going to be about down syndrome vampires, retirement age vampires?",1045094400,2,981,4.723529411764706
379680,5,6301928555,"In a small town ""smack dab"" in the middle of nowhere, what's there to do besides drink a little, drive around in your truck, keep odd hours while looking for love, and hang out with your friends while doing so? Well, when there's strangers in town, you can always try on a little vampirism for kick - provided they cooperate. Caleb Colton finds himself in just that position when he opts to give the beautiful out-of-towner Mae a ride home in the middle of the night, swooning her into hysterics and then, as the sun is about to rise, manages to get accidentally infected by the kiss of eternity. This automatically enrolls him in a surrogate family of four, where he finds out fairly quickly that becoming one of the clan means doing more than simply getting bitten.
Much of this movie feeds off the madness within the ""vampire"" group's antics as they travel from place to place, barely hiding themselves before the sun blazes down and threatens to rob them of their lives. That's what I liked about it, too, because the combined talents of Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen, Jenette Goldstein, and Joshua Miller made a dysfunctional little circle that was believably mad and unpredictably brutal. They aren't your run-of-the-mill group with the abilities to morph into animals, to fly, or to even think clearly most of the time, but what they lack in the realms of logic and gimmickry is made up for in strength, the ability to shed the inconveniences of bullets like so much water, and an utter lack of fear when confronted with most events that make mortals cringe. There are other portions mingled into it as well, such as the relationship that begins to form between Caleb and Mae as he struggles with this strange new life he's found himself thrust into, the need for a father and a sister to find the missing son/brother that they saw taken from beneath their very eyes, and the need for an elder beast trapped in a boy's body to have a companion, rounding it out as something with a little flavor for any of the movie-watching masses.
Lovingly restored on DVD and having one deleted scene that an audience could certainly do without, this widescreen presentation brings many a flavorable scene back into prospectives that had missed out on them because of years of graininess and subpar transfers. So, because you know you need the press of victimology 101 in your living, you should dive into this tasty full meal extravaganza.",1044835200,2,2432,4.724705882352941
379721,3,6301928555,"-SPOILERS-
I must have been one of the few people to have seen this movie in the theaters when it first came out- I read on IMDB that it only grossed 3 or 4 million dollars.  I rented it because I remember my friend and I were laughing just uncontrollably at the end when Homer goes up in flames.  I can see how this movie has a cult following, especially with Bill Paxton whooping it up and that indulgent, horrific bar scene (check out that waitress's hairdo!).  But there are some serious flaws that prevent me from enjoying it more.  The main one for me is how these vampires are supposed to have decades of experience with this kind of life and yet can't judge when the sun will rise or ever think to carry ski masks or gloves on such ocassions.  But then we would need to rework the plot, right?  I liked how convenient it was for them to run into Caleb's father and daughter, who happened to be staying in the same motel while they were trying to find Caleb all over the state.  How did Caleb's father manage to donate enough of his blood to him in that transfusion scene?  But the relationship between Caleb and Mae was interesting because both are innocent and well-intentioned.  I liked the scenes when Caleb drank her blood from her wrists on his knees- very sensuous.  The Tangerine Dream score seemed out of place for this Western vampire movie.",1043193600,2,1358,4.417670682730924

379726,5,6301928555,"If you're a horror fan looking for something unique or different, you'll definitely want to catch Kathryn Bigelow's NEAR DARK, the first truly modern American vampire story.  While retaining all the cool elements of traditional vampire lore--the blood-drinking, longevity, aversion to the sun, and animosity towards mankind--the film avoids those aspects, such as fear of the Crucifix and holy water, which are merely religious symbols and seem to have little effect on the all-too-real evils that we face in the 21st Century.  Gone, too, is the traditional European gothic setting.  Instead, writer/director Bigelow and co-writer Eric Red place their American bloodsuckers in the gritty surrounds of the rural Midwestern and Southwestern United States.  For the first time, horror fans are presented with the blue-collar undead, who sport cowboy hats, black-leather chaps, and spurs and who speak with southern drawls.
The basic story revolves around a naive southern farm boy who has been unwittingly lured into the crimson-colored nocturnal lifestyle by a blood-drinking cutie and thereby forced to leave his family and join the girl's troupe of undead ""kin.""  Adrian Pasdar does a fine job as the farm boy, and Jenny Wright turns in an intriguing performance as the introspective and seductive cutie.  But it is the other vamps who really steal the show.  Bill Paxton chews the scenery--as always--playing a blood-sucking, leather-clad good-ol'-boy.  Lance Henriksen is dead-on (excuse the pun) in his portrayal of the Johnny-Rebel patriarch of the ""family,"" and gorgeous Jenette Goldstein is both sexy and creepy as Henriksen's matriarchal mate.  In spite of their insatiable lust for human blood, this clan is so quirky and likable that you almost want to cheer for them to come out on top.
The film is technically beautiful, too.  The cinematography is breathtakingly rich in detail and color, a rarity in horror flicks; the special effects, though sparse, are well executed and avoid the cheesiness common to many vampire flicks; and Bigelow's directing--this film marks her professional debut--is top-notch.
Kudos should also go to Anchor Bay for their excellent two-disc DVD release of NEAR DARK. The first disc contains a beautiful widescreen digital transfer and optional commentary soundtrack (commentary by Bigelow and Eric Red, if I remember correctly), and the second disc has tons of extras, not the least of which is an outstanding 45-minute documentary that includes interviews with the director and most of the stars.",1035244800,,2537,5.383838383838384

379728,5,6301928555,"I'm always a bit cautious when one of my favorite movies from ye old days of video is re-released on DVD.  All too often I've been disappointed in cut-rate transfers that don't even offer the luxury of letterbox, let alone any of the other extras that the jaded DVD buyer has come to expect.  Needless to say I was damn suspicious when I heard that Near Dark was going to get the DVD treatment.  After all, Near Dark isn't really a horror classic to the rest of the world, is it?  With a wary eye I took the plunge because I was tired of trying to introduce unwitting visitors to the film with my over pixilated copy.

Secondly, the movie itself was a treat to watch because it was the first time I had ever seen it in letterbox.  Equally pleasantly was the way the film has held up over time, not becoming outdated the way so many horror films do.

Thirdly, let's talk about the extras.  Oh yes, there are extras.  A whole DVD of them; the original script, trailers, and the like.  However, the real prize is the documentary that gives you more insight into the characters themselves, as well as the actors who played them.

379770,4,6301928555,"Sometimes, there is a movie that just comes out at the wrong place, or the wrong time, or in the wrong setting.  It is often a very good movie, and, some-times, has an incredible cast.  However, due to something about the release, the movie is not re-ceived very well at all.  This was the case for the movie Near Dark.  Much to the loss of anyone who has never seen it.
The year is 1987.  On Halloween night, two competing vampire movies are released.  The first, an independent film about nomadic vampires, with minimal advertisement and only a simple poster, showing a young man named Billy Paxton on it with his head split open, the movie name, and the motto ""Pray For Daylight.""  The other, a Warner Bros. film about nomadic vampires, which was advertised to Hell and back, and starred Jason Patric and Kiefer Sutherland.  The first was Near Dark, and the second... a little flick called The Lost Boys.  Simply due to the fact that most people I know have never even heard of the former, while the latter is practically a household name, it is pretty easy to figure out what happened.  Near Dark was completely shadowed by the Warner Bros. film, and hardly even got a second look.
Well, here is that second look.
The setting is the small-town Midwest... Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, something along those lines.  One Saturday night, a young man by the name of Caleb spies himself the prettiest young woman he's seen in a long time, and makes the attempt for her.  The young woman, a young girl by the name of Mae, is willing to play along, and even accepts a ride home from this cowboy stranger.  She's not exactly accommodating, and the little bite she leaves on his neck before running off... an attempt to get home before the sun rises, and her ""family"" gets upset... leaves Caleb with more than just a bruised ego.
With his truck broken down, he has to make his way across a few miles of open country, and when the sun starts making his skin smoke, it's not hard to see where things are going to go for our young hero.  And when the Winnebago pulls up to pull Caleb out of danger, and reveals Mae's ""family"" was actually a nomadic group of vampires, the plot really begins to take some amazing twists and turns.
To tell much more would be giving it all away, and, believe me, seeing the movie is more than worth it.  But the least I can do is give you a quick introduction to the players of this macabre little play.
The first, of course, is Caleb Colton (played by Adrian Pasdar), a young man with a loving father and doting, if not a little temperamental, little sister.  He's your boy next door... at least until a bloody little hickey shows him the dark side of the world.
Next, we have Mae (played by Jenny Wright).  Beautiful young woman with a passion for life... or is it what's inside the living?  A vampire of only four years, she doesn't seem so bad, and still seems to enjoy kissing as much as any living woman, at least, with the right guy.  But above all, she is loyal to her pack.
Mae, however, is only but one member of this nomadic vampire pack.  The leader is an older man known by the name Jesse (played by Lance Hendrikson).  He's been around quite a long time, probably more than anyone else in the group.  ""Let's just put it this way: I fought for the South. - We lost.""  He's kind when he has to be, hard the rest of the time, and is the ""leader"" of the group.
Severen (played by Bill Paxton) is the next of our motley crew.  A gunfighter of the ""Old West,"" he was made by Jesse, and is easily the brute force of the group.  He's rough, violent, but can play the Don Juan when he has to.  Oh, and he ""hates them when they're not shaved.""
Another of Jesse's ""children"" is Diamondback (played by Jenette Goldstein), an out-of-luck Antebellum Southern Belle, with bleach-blonde hair and a spirit that outshines even her dark, vicious nature.  She could easily be called the mother of the group, though she doesn't coddle anyone, by any means.
Finally, we have Homer (played by Joshua John Miller).  He's a child of the 50's, and is still, for all physical purposes, a child of around 13 years old, at best.  Though most of the time he has a very mature outlook on life, there are still times when he slips into his child-like nature.  And don't mispronounce his name... it might be bad to upset someone with the spite of a child and the power of a vampire.
Whether traveling in semi-trucks, modified hearses, or even a van that looks like something out of ""The A-Team,"" this group manages to find trouble at every turn... all of it by their own making.  After all, when you drink the blood of other human beings, and live virtually forever, what is life but one big party?  About the only thing I didn't like about the movie was the ending; it was contrite, fluffy, and left the audience wanting something more as the credits rolled on.  But if you can handle a few little problems, I'd highly recommend getting this movie.  It's worth the rental fee, at least, and the DVD has some special features that make buying it very worth while.",1032739200,3,5075,4.433189655172414

The kiss produces more than Caleb expects and it brings violence and death to his presence.

A fuel-loaded semi blows up for no reason (other than it is required by the plot).  If vampires receive a pint of blood during a transfusion, they are cured.  And so on.  If you need things to make sense to you, even in a vampire movie, you will be disappointed.
The acting is also wretched.  Bill Paxton's performance could be his worst ever.  And the two child actors in this movie can only be described with whatever adjective conveys a meaning worse than ""wretched.""
Are you a special effects junkie?  Remember, this was a very low budget film.  This is the first vampire movie I have ever seen that never shows anything but normal teeth.  Whatever your level of expertise is with special effects--you could have created most of them yourself (""most"" consists of fake blood and bodies that emit smoke).
I predict that the used DVD stores will be glutted with this movie soon.  If you absolutely have to purchase it, do yourself a favor and purchase it used.  I guarantee that used copies of Near Dark will be Near You in the Near Future.",1032134400,9,1149,4.44976076555024
379773,4,6301928555,"Near Dark is one of those great movies that it seems no one has seen. I hope this deluxe DVD will change that.
  Near Dark suffered in it's initial theatrical release due to it's resemblance to The Lost Boys. They share a storyline (Hapless young man falls for a girl who turns him into a Vampire, and he's forced to deal with her crazy running buddies.), and even a release date; Lost Boys blew Near Dark right out of theaters, but Near Dark found an appreciative audience on video, and deservedly so. The cast is uniformly great, especially Lance Henrikson and Bill Paxton as the lead Vamps. The script, by Director Kathryn and Eric Red, is perfect- we learn little tidbits about the history of the Vampires, but we're always kept at arms length from them. We see them as alien and threatening, and they see us a food. Bigelow does a great job, especially considering it was her solo directorial debut. The only gripe I had is the Vampirism ""Cure"" which seems like a Deus Ex Machina, but that's a small quibble. The Tangerine Dream score also made some scenes seem really cheesy...FAR from their best work. I think an orchestral score would have been much better, but budget constraints....
  The 2-DVD set is beautifully packaged, with a die-cut inner package inside the box, and a great looking (and informative!) booklet. The film looks great; As usual, Anchor Bay does great work on their DVD transfers. It also has a commentary track from Director Bigelow, which is kinda dry and technical. Disc 2 has tons of storyboards, a weak deleted scene, a new 47-minute documentary, cast & crew bios (Very extensive!), still & ad galleries, and tons more.
  Near Dark is one of those films that has flown under the radar for FAR too long, and I can't recommend it highly enough!",1032134400,120,1776,4.65814696485623

This is how you treat a classic, the Living in Darkness documentary(47 minutes) is an absolute must see. Interviews with Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton and Katherine Bigelow are pure gold dust, their ancedotes told with relish and nostalgia and as expected, there is the obligatory back slapping, for once, it is all highly deserving. Picture quality is flawless, sound is as sound does but from the minute the warped animated menu contorts it's way onto the screen and that familiar haunting tune starts up, you realise it's been far too long since you watched this film and have presently forgotten how good this twisted little vampire tale was. Holding it's own against the powerhouse that is The Lost Boys, this title might as well stay seated atop of your DVD player as it's not gonna spend much time on your shelf.

379775,1,6301928555,"I have been waiting for Near Dark to come out on DVD ever since the format was introduced. Now it's out and I am going to stick with my VHS copy.  The picture looks as if it was shot behind a sun filter and the color is lacking. The so-called widescreen is non-existent, losing part of the top and bottom of the picture. When I buy a DVD title I always compare it to my VHS copy to insure that I am in fact getting not only a better quality picture but true widescreen. My VHS copy is in so much better shape, I will no doubt watch that version rather than the DVD. The part that really irritates me is that I bought the DVD from Best Buy, whose policy is that they don't give refunds on open DVD's, only exchanges for the same title, so I'm stuck with it.
On another note, I have noticed that there are a number of DVD's that claim to be in widescreen but in reality only throw in the black bars to give the illusion of widescreen (check out Ferris Bueller for example).  From my experience I think most of Paramount, Warner and Universal are the only companies that truly have widescreen formats on their DVD's, but even they have their failures. I don't know who does the screening of films when they are transferred to DVD but if I did my job that poorly, I wouldn't have it for long. I just wonder when these DVD industries will finally start living up to their expectations and release ALL movies in true widescreen?

 I wrote to Anchor Bay about the DVD quality and guess what they did- they sent me another one! I think that they miss the big picture here (no pun intended), I was complaining about the quality of the DVD and didn't need to get another one in its place that was just as bad!",1032134400,5,1699,4.2024539877300615

I have been looking forward to getting a look at this pick since Maxim ranked it above even the great Dawn of the Dead within one of their schlock movie articles a few years back. Better than even the great DOTD? That's quite a claim! I thought I had really been missing out by having never seen ""Near Dark""... Boy was I wrong!
It is not a total stinker... But to call this flick gorier than the legendary Dawn of the Dead or any of the Evil Dead flicks is pure fantasy and/or ignorance.... Then again I have to ponder how many peeps calling this flick so ""gory"" and ""great"" just happen to work at Anchor Bay who released this DVD? I mean is it possible anyone can talk outta thier ...that much? Anyways, the bottom line on gore in this flick... Don't expect anything more than some fake blood! There's a part where a character get's shot in the stomach, and all you see is fake blood on a torn shirt! What no entrails? How dare anyone comapre this to DOTD! Any TRUE schlock fan can name a thousand titles with more gore than this flick!
But gore is not everything... What about story?
I thought the premise was cool! These vampires cruising around mid-west americana in stolen vehicles... Blacking out the windows with aluminum foil and black spraypaint so they can cruise around in the day. But continuously I kept wondering when the movie was going to pick up! Then the totally rushed ending that basically smacks of writer's conveinence by rehashing part of the beginning like an inane instant replay! What? That's it? I guess so... And another title to collect dust on my collection shelf. No wonder it was a ""forgotten"" film! Well it will maintain that status in my collection. ;)
Pros? Bill Paxton I thought gave the only standout performance in the movie... He was really that damn good as Severen! The soundtrack by Tangerine Dream was pretty good... But not as great as their efforts for  ""The Keep""... But definitely an above average soundtrack for a low budget horror flick though. And the much touted ""Bar-Scene"" was by far the most interesting scene in this flick. Sort of reminded me of the opening scene in Natural Born Killers. But is this DVD worth the purchase for these few perks? Hell no! At least in my opinion! To sum it up... Does not live up to the hype by a longshot... And is rather a boring film. Not horrible... but none too great!
Please, by all means... If you are like me and haven't seen this flick, but are considering buying it based on the hype alone.... Do rent before buying! Call it ""coaster"" insurance!",1032048000,3,2678,4.498973305954825

 the whole idea of placing vampires in modern times and having them come on as cowboys and driving around in a rv was brillant as far as i'm concerned.
  the love interest between the hero and the girl is wonderfully played out. there is not real sex in this movie,which if not for all the violence and language whould probably rate this movie a pg13 or something.i'm sure the hero would have loved to get the girl into bed,unforunately for him the girl is a vampire and has other plans for him.
  there is humour laced throughtout this movie and if you listen carefully you'll pick up on it. it's really difficult to make any horror movie and try to play it straight all the way through.to have tried that with this movie with all the intensity and violence would not have worked i don't believe.

Watch Lance Henriksen give a bullet back to the guy who shot him, after coughing it up! This movie was disturbing and really really cool. The music by Tangerine Dream was so ethereal, it was perfect.

Paxton in particular really lets it rip; he's definitely the most interesting, but I love all three of these characters.

379817,3,6301928555,"Bigelow's revisionist vampire picture, cowritten with Eric Red, can be lumped in with all those other revisionist vampire pictures.
Adrian Pasdar is an aw shucks cowboy in Oklahoma who hooks up with weird girl Mae, played by Jenny Wright (what ever happened to her?). She brings him home to meet the family, who all happen to be vampires. A little love nip gets Pasdar hankering for some blood, and he reluctantly goes along with the band of psychotic human hunters. Pasdar's dad, Tim Thomerson, tracks down Pasdar and takes him back home. A blood transfusion fixes Pasdar right up, but the pack of vampires follows him, kidnapping his sister. A fiery climax ends this weird little film.
Lance Henriksen is the leader of the pack, and he is great. He has never received the recognition he deserved, and I wish ""Millennium"" was still on. Bill Paxton plays ""the crazy one,"" the vampire who enjoys killing. In short, is seems to be the same role Paxton plays every other film or so. Pasdar and Wright are okay as the bloodstruck couple, but there is no real body heat between them (so to speak).
My problem with this film is this vague lack of spark throughout the film. Everyone goes through the motions, but no one looks like they are really into this. Like Red's other notorious film, ""The Hitcher,"" this film opens badly. I felt like I sat down in the middle of the film, not the beginning. Pasdar and Wright are not given enough time to generate this Romeo and Juliet kind of love they are supposed to be experiencing. The vampire ""family"" are all nuts, and are not given enough time to show any care for each other, which means we eventually do not care either. Thomerson as the veterinarian dad is very good, but again, in an underwritten part.
The film certainly looks good. The special and makeup effects are great, especially the infamous scene of a little fifth grader-looking vampire running down a highway in sunlight and bursting into flame. Bigelow's direction is good, if a little sloppy. There are a couple of editing errors, but she does a good job of keeping things going.
When you think things are finally clicking, the film makers throw in a silly scene that makes you rethink your previous joy at the film. The blood transfusions and the second kidnapping of Pasdar's sister (really dumb) just provide grist for the mediocrity.
Throw in a completely inappropriate musical score by Tangerine Dream, and this film is a definite mixed bag. I recommend ""Near Dark,"" but with some huge reservations.
This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, strong gun violence, strong gore, strong profanity, some sexual references, and adult situations.",1021420800,2,2659,4.79520697167756

Gist - cowboy Caleb (Adrian Pasdar) goes home with trailer-trash vampire Mae (Jenny Wright) to meet the family. It's a bat out of hell from there.  With this cast, there was no way this film could lose. And the attention to detail alone will make vampirism seem credible. The barroom scene is on-the-edge-of-your-seat and in-your-face viewing.

379870,5,6301928555,"Kathryn Bigelow creates strange, note-worthy movies such as 'Strange Days' (1995), and
'Near Dark', a delicious slice of Southern Gothic... with a vampiric twist. 'Near Dark'
is one of the better examples of 1980's postmodernism - it knowingly plays with allusions
to popular culture and genre conventions in the same way 'The Lost Boys' or 'Vamp' does,
though in a decidedly darker vein. Bigelow has used tantalising slices of different genres
to create a dazzling montage of traditional horror, spaghetti westerns and biker movies.
Unlike other tongue-in-cheek vampire films of the era, 'Near Dark' is an intense cinematic
experience that raises genuine emotions - the audience feels for the plight of farm boy Caleb
(Adrian Pasdar), or for the victims the vampires taunt before killing.
Set in Southern farm country, almost entirely populated by rednecks wearing sweaty Stetsons
and varying colours of check shirt, it tells the story of Caleb. On the surface, it is a
'boy-meets'-girl' narrative - he sees the sweetly gamine Mae (Jenny Wright) standing in front
of a sweet shop, eating an ice cream, and things quickly progress. When Mae gives him a love
bite that smarts, the rising sun burns, and he is snatched into a Winnebago with blacked-out
windows, his nightmare is only just beginning. Led by Jesse (Lance Henrickson), who is quietly
spoken and charismatic, the brood travels across the USA, leaving carnage in their wake. Like
a bloodthirsty, dysfunctional, poor white trash family, they bicker, get sentimental over past
times and slaughter without compunction. Bill Paxton is especially good as Severen, who is more
than slightly crazy, as is Homer, the vampire child who is in fact the eldest.
The film is punctuated throughout with graphic violence, and does not shy away from portraying
the vampire as a monster. There are no Anne Rice Brat Princes here. The vampires do not have
fangs and few apparent supernatural powers - they kill with guns and knives. The feeding frenzy
designed to initiate Caleb and wean him off his reliance on Mae's blood is a masterful exercise
in tension and brutality. When cornered in a Mexican style stand-off with the local sheriffs,
gunfire punching holes through walls that allow in deadly sunlight, the vampires respond in
typical fashion. The imagery here is excellent, contrasting dank, fetid shadows with shafts of
pure, hard sunlight. Throughout the film, the relationship between Mae and Caleb is touching,
although Pasadar plays him a little too generic corn-fed farm boy for credibility. Their story
is about teenage love that lasts for forever - they will never age or die, but their love is
destructive, almost incestuous in its need. Caleb almost kills Mae by feeding only on her.
The climax of the tale is spectacular, satisfying the audience's need to see the evil punished
and the good redeemed. Although accomplished in cinematographic terms, the film has not stood
the test of time and will seem a bit cheesy to a contemporary audience. It is worth watching
for the 'cure' for vampirism and the wonderfully deranged characters in Jesse's 'family'. So
next time you see a strange, cute blonde girl eating ice cream in the dark... leave her be!

379871,5,6301928555,"A film like this only comes once. Yes, I might agree that it has similarities with other movies but it is a great ride.
Young modern cowboy Caleb meet young vampire girl Mae and is introduced into the fold. To stay he must kill.
From the first shot of a mosquito buzzing on Calebs arm towards the end showdown and the last freezeframe, Near Dark is a masterpiece on it's own. Kathryn Bigelow (the director of Point Break and Strange Days) cut her teeth on this vampire-something flick, together with screenwriter/director Eric Red (The Hitcher, Cohen & Tate). In the cast I am with delight able to watch such good and often underrated actors as Lance Henriksen (Millenium), Jeanette Goldstein (Aliens), Bill Paxton (Titanic) as three parts of the vampire family. But I do not forget the two stars, both Jenny Wright and Adrian Pasdar make characters that I really care about.
So, what is Near Dark? A beautiful dark love story.
One of the best things about Near Dark is showing the vampires (if that is what they are? we are not told but they drink blood and they get sunburned.) as pretty normal people (they don't fly around hissing with fanged teeth).
And then it's the music by Tangerine Dreams (Firestarter) which is just perfect.

That's why, when watching ""Near Dark"", I said to myself, ""this is the movie that they were TRYING to make with 'Lost Boys' and failed""  Staying true to dramatic form from start to finish, ""Near Dark"" never allows audience-pandering to drag it down to idiot level.  Like ""Lost Boys"", it is a tale of youthful alienation set against a modern vampire story, where a young man finds acceptance with a violent band of rag-tag misfits led by a true-to-form Lance Henrikson.  Moodily directed and set almost entirely at night, the film makes you feel the empty stretches of the American midwest and the elation and confusion of the protagonist's involvement with the vampire band.  Though quite bloody at times, it isn't the juvenile torture porn of some current films, nor is it yet another supposed ""horror/comedy"".  In fact, I can't think of a more perfect vampire movie than this one.  Note, I said ""perfect"", not ""great"";  this movie has a pretty low-key atmosphere throughout, and, though there is certainly action in it, that isn't where the emphasis lies, but, might almost be more of a character study without all the pretension that that label would imply.

I do have an issue with the cover art being changed to capitalize on the Twilight aesthetic. This movie should not even be in the same conversation.,1493164800,2,290,4.82
7816783,5,6301928555,"I hate the fact that this DVD is so highly priced, but, I will say, this is a FANTASTIC performance by Bill Pullman (RIP) - one of his absolute best. I have this on reg DVD and watch it when I need a grin. Bull Pullman - you are missed, and will continue to be. You are SO good in this film. Love it.",1489017600,,300,3.703125
