It begins underwater, two scuba divers explore the ocean bottom. They are attacked by barracuda, there is blood in the water. A man registers at a hotel. People take water samples to test for pollution. A man wants them arrested for trespassing, and to get their water samples. The owner of Jack Chemical talks to the diver before the Sheriff arrests him. The diver gets his breakfast then is released. Mike goes to the doctor for his cut leg; he is a marine biologist from the university. A scuba diver inspects lobster traps. There is another barracuda attack! A dog goes into the water to retrieve a stick, but balks. Then she finds a human head! Mike talks about ocean pollution and its effects on humans.

Dead fish are washing up on the shore, some partly eaten. Is the chemical plant responsible? Papa Jack tells the reporter this is temporary. The waitress in the restaurant is short tempered, so too the cook. A couple go into the water, the man disappears except for bloody water! Lester calls about another swimmer attack. Are the two tragedies related? What about the pollution? Their boat goes into the water at night. Mike dives into the ocean to get fish to examine. Could the chemical plant cause a problem? What are industrial chemicals doing in the plant? Could it have caused the fish attacks? Does low blood sugar cause violence? A man with a pistol enters the newspaper office and censors the editor and his assistants!

Mike reads a report on The Lucifer Project and the effects of blood sugar level. Mike talks to Dr. Snow about the dead people. Then Dr. Snow makes a telephone call. Mike explains hypoglycemias effect on the fish. The Sheriff gives Mike a pistol and tells him to contact Lester and call the State Police. Those chemicals were put in the towns water supply. Who are the ones responsible? Dr. Snow says its the government! The Sheriff gets into a shooting duel with the assassin. A column of police cars rolls into town. The Sheriff orders the two men to surrender. There is a surprising ending!

This is a low budget production but the movie fails because it does not have a good story. The ending didn't work for me. But it does ask a good question: is there a physical condition that produces violence? Can any effort be made to reduce violence? Generally speaking, poverty correlates with crime. To reduce crime and violence the government can start another WPA with good pay for the unemployed. There will be costs for this, but there are costs in doing nothing.",1510617600,,2528,4.686936936936937
7829370,4,6302676789,"A good B-movie which unfortunately gets dumped on because it was made during the post-Jaws ""another killer fish"" hype. Warning, spoiler ahead. But instead of churning out another flick about being eaten by fish, what we get is a sinister government plot with some very likeable characters that eschew typical stereotyping.

Granted, the basic plot is nothing new, it was done in many b&w monster movies of the 50's and 60's.

Ok, so the acting and dialogue aren't top notch but hey, it's fun, low budget, and an ending which would make an amateur Fox Mulder proud.",1130112000,,564,4.804123711340206
7829371,3,6302676789,"This film was released amid a spate of similar films that flooded the market shortly after ""Jaws"" became the highest grossing movie of all time.  ""Orca"", ""Piranha"", ""Tentacles"", ""Tintorera"", ""Blue Water, White Death"", and the deplorable ""Up From the Depths"", as well as three ""Jaws"" sequels, overloaded theaters with ""Don't go in the water"" movies in the late 70s.  Some of them were halfway decent, others were downright pitiful.  ""Barracuda"" falls in at about the middle of the scale; better than some, worse than others.  It concerns a town experiencing vicious attacks by these toothsome fishes, caused by the dumping of waste from a chemical factory.  But when an intrepid group of young people discover this, they learn that the chemical has been deliberately engineered to cause this hyper-aggression, and expose a plan to disperse it among the human population.  If you like killer-fish movies, then ""Barracuda"" is for you.  If not, then don't waste your time.",1092960000,2,968,5.127388535031847
