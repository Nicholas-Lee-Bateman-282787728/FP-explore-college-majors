8279627,4,B000GM149I,"Better than Porkys, better than Zapped, Screwballs is as fantastic now as it was when it debut in 1983. 25 years ago, and it is still going strong. The ending of the movie is absolutely incredible, as the protagonists visit a strip club and view the delights of a voluptuous and mammothly-endowed BTC! I highly reccomend this rare DVD for any connoisseur of beautiful females.

UPDATE
As of March 12, 2013 I can tell you that the DVD does not come with all that it is advertised to come with. There was no producer commentary on this DVD and no biographies of the cast members. I wanted to know who played what character. This was never adequately explained in the opening or closing credits. The movie itself was hilarious but the credits did not in any way support the cast of fantastic actors.
