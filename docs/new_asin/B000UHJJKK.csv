8377019,2,B000UHJJKK,"This video is a mixed bag.  To its credit, it is fast-paced and should keep students' attention.  To its detriment, it is dated (made in 1997) and unsure of what its goal is.  This 24 minute video briefly addresses the following:  fugue, imitation, music styles, pitch, sound waves, string orchestra, practicing, jazz, rhythm, how music can set a mood (movie scores), music in everyday life, Mozart, Beethoven, and composing.  Obviously, by trying to cover so much ground in such a brief video, nothing is really covered in depth.  The result is fast-moving, but disjointed.  This is useful only as a substitute music teacher resource in a pinch.  Teachers in sensitive school districts should note that the Beethoven character punches another character toward the end of the video.  It is not graphic and done as a joke, but some parents may be upset by cartoonish violence.  Grades 2-4.",1186099200,4,888,4.979591836734694
