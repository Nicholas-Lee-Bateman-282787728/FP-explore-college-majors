8612484,2,B00F5RFNPU,"I could have directed it better than this guy. The content is important, but the jumpy scene changes and general cheezy look to the movie would turn most people off. I cannot recommend it.",1391472000,,188,4.5588235294117645

8612486,5,B00F5RFNPU,"This movie explores the need for safe communities for people and pets. It exposes the numerous ramifications of breed discrimination in America on families and taxpayers. It follows activists trying to change arbitrary laws that violate property rights and ban pit bull terrier like dogs to comprehensive breed neutral dangerous dog/reckless owner laws. The film exposes city council members unwilling to examine new scientific studies that reveal breed discrimination doesn't enhance public safety and  are often enacted because of city council members racially profiling of the owners.

The movie is set in Ohio, the only state in America that in 1987 passed a law deeming a breed of dog as ""vicious"". It  inspires the viewer to take political action as it documents the struggle over the years to repeal Ohio's ineffective law. Activists were successful and Ohio finally repealed breed discrimination in favor of a comprehensive breed neutral dangerous dog/reckless owner law  in 2012.

The film shows that breed discriminatory laws  fail to enhance public safety, violate property rights, and are extremely expensive to enforce Indeed, 17 states now prohibit some form of breed discrimination and the White House came out against breed ""specific"" laws.

We learn from the film there is nothing ""specific"" about breed ""specific"" laws. Director Jeff Theman is to be commended for this thoughtful political film documenting grassroots action. Guilty Til Proven Innocent played to a packed house and rave reviews at the St. Louis International Film Festival.",1385164800,,1558,5.413223140495868
