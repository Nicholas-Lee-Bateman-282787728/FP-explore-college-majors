8044042,1,B0006ZIEGQ,Everything is shown too fast. No slowed down walk throughs or note by note instruction given. If you can keep up with it you're already too advanced in your skills to need it! Stay away from this one. Buy Todd Phillips' courses if you intend to learn anything!!!,1464825600,,262,4.479166666666667
