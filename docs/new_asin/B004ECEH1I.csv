4336349,5,B004ECEH1I,"I tried buying a copy of ""Counterpoint"" off the internet a couple years ago.  It was a crummy, fuzzy copy off a TV set. One of the best scenes was cut short by some network hack who had no clue what they were doing.  This movie has the whole scene.

The copy quality leaves something to be desired, but that was already pointed out in the product description.  It's a whole lot better than off the TV.

""Counterpoint"" itself features some awful acting, especially Hayes.  To counterbalance that, the music and the story and Schell are wonderful.",1358208000,8,545,4.56701030927835
4336350,5,B004ECEH1I,"""Counterpoint"" (1968) Charlton Heston; Maximillian Schell

Back in the mid 60's Universal was turning out a fairly large amount of product--a lot of it was quickie on the cheap filler films for double features and the like. I could name a dozen! Some examples would be ""Sgt. Ryker"", ""P.J."", ""The Shakiest Gun in the West"", ""Nobody's Perfect"", ""King's Pirate"", ""What's so Bad about Feeling Good?"", ""Don't Just Stand There!""
When I originally saw ""Counterpoint"" at the Palace Theatre in Hamburg, N.Y. it was the first half of a double feature with ""The Ballad of Josie"" starring Doris Day. I remember enjoying both.
""Counterpoint"" had a fairly interesting story. Charlton Heston is the head of a symphony orchestra touring Europe during World War II. When they are captured they are taken to a castle camp run by Maximillian Schell. While at the Camp they are commanded to perform a concert for the Nazis and while all this is taking place they have to plan a way to escape! This is a very small film but still a very good one with some wonderful music performed throughout. This film is definitely worth a look. I must say that Amazon seems to be back on the stick with releasing the Universal Vault Series. Some of these titles are not well known now or when originally released but still it's great they're finally seeing the light of day. ""Counterpoint"" is one film that has not been available in any format before this release. I am thoroughly delighted that this film has finally seen the light of day after all these years proving that you never know what you will find the deeper you look in a vault. Keep Looking!!!!!!!",1348704000,39,1626,4.705263157894737
4336351,5,B004ECEH1I,"I saw the movie Counterpoint decades ago, and I remember how enjoyable it was.  I would love to own a copy that I can see here in the States. Or am I going to have to buy a special DVD player for non-USA-format movies?  Are there any plans to release Counterpoint in a USA format? The sooner the better!",1341619200,6,303,4.11864406779661

4336357,4,B004ECEH1I,"I didn't like this for the first 30 - 45 minutes.  The whole concept seemed trite, as if the director and writers were trying to shoe-horn in a story line that included an orchestra during the war.  In addition, Heston seemed too quick to demonstrate his ego, and Schell's similar behavior appeared to me at that point to be contrived in order to fit in.  The story just wasn't working for me.

But as the film moved on, I came to like it and then near the end to really enjoy it.  In sum, this movie is a highly intellectual study.  The arguments of both men, not always said, are at an extremely high level intellectually.  This became crystalized for me when Heston asked the lead female actress who had rejected Schell's advances, ""Why did you turn him down?""  Thus pointing or perhaps finally making clear to the viewer the whole reason for his own rejection of Schell's requests to play music for him.

Now, I must watch the movie again and probably a third time to really see the nature of both men's behaviors.  I look forward to this continuing challenge.  I wouldn't rate this one at five stars (that rating deserves true greatness like ""Where Eagles Dare"" and ""Bridge on the River Kwai."" But I do give it four.  It isn't great, but it is good.  And the sign of any good movie is the feeling of satisfaction after watching it, which this one does, and also to want to watch it again.  This succeeds on both counts.  As for Heston an Schell's performances, they are both excellent.  Worth the money, I would definitely recommend this to buy.",1416182400,2,1550,4.482142857142857
4336358,5,B004ECEH1I,One of my favorite Charlton Heston film. A tense film set in World War II; that sets a Nazi commander (Maximillisn Schell) against philharmonic orchestra conductor (Charlton Heston) and his orchestra that he has captured as they fled fighting near the end of war. Schell  realizes that his time is coming and wants to hear symphonic music one more time; as the German Army falls back. The music in the film is wonderful; and good performances by Heston and Schell by this film one that needs to be seen by everyone.,1413244800,2,515,4.65934065934066

4336361,1,B004ECEH1I,"Disappointed in this movie. I really like Charlton Heston that's why I bought the movie. What bothers me about the movie is that the actress in the leading role seems to pass herself around to her husband, to Charlton Heston (a prior boyfriend), and seems to be happy to play a seducing scene with the German General, all why they have been taken as prisoners of war. What woman has time to do this in a two hour movie about world war II prisoners and playing in a symphony to boot!..I wasted my money on this.
A much better Charlton Heston movie is ""The Wreck of the Mary Dear"" get that one, its got some suspense, and intrigue, and is decent.",1410912000,3,644,4.330578512396694

4336363,5,B004ECEH1I,"This film isn't perhaps ""great cinema"", but it works as a wartime thriller.  Both protagonist (Heston) and antagonist (Schell) were arrogant, determined and intelligent, playing a living game of chess with ""checkmate"" being life or death.  I thought the character studies and development were interesting, and you could sense the fear of the orchestra members, knowing there was a good chance they would be massacred before it was all over.  Amusing and very satisfying scene when an American soldier who is hiding among the musicians is commanded to play his trombone by an officer (Anton Diffring, who plays a terrific ""bad guy"" in this and other films, and is even more arrogant than Schell's character.)  This film is also great for classical music fans.  Wonderful cast- interesting seeing Leslie Nielsen  playing a very serious role.  I originally saw this in the theater years ago and have been looking for it ever since.  I was not disappointed.  The disc also was packaged well, arrived in excellent condition.",1406160000,2,1019,5.090361445783133

I saw this movie on TV around 1975 and was going to tape it but it never played again. The original film was apparently hidden, lost or destroyed and film hasn't been available since mid-1970's.  Glad to see an original master was found and this DVD is available. I purchased a tape a few years ago which was probably a tape of the TV showing in 1975 and the quality was poor.",1405814400,,563,4.63

4336370,5,B004ECEH1I,"I've searched for this film for years. This WWII drama is the story of an American symphony orchestra captured and held prisoner by the Nazis. Heston does an admirable job as the arrogant conductor, Leslie Neilson is believable in a serious role as concertmaster, Anton Diffring is perfectly typecast as the Nazi who can't wait to execute them, and the late Max Schell is superb as the battle-weary German general who only wants a command performance of Wagner. Will he get his concert? And will he release or execute them?",1391472000,3,523,4.822222222222222
4336371,4,B004ECEH1I,"Ralph Nelson's 1967 film ""Counterpoint"" has long been only accessible for viewers via a very poor quality bootleg DVD only.  The Universal Vault DVD series has produced a nice transfer of this intriguing film.  Russell Metty, ASC, who was the Director of Photography for many of Charlton Heston's motion pictures, shot the film with minimal studio lighting so it is a film of great atmosphere.  Very nice acting job by Mr. Heston and Mr. Schell.

No extra features on this DVD are featured, the spoken soundtrack is in English (save some French and German as part of the film's script), nor can one skip from scene to scene.  That aside, it's nice to have a proper print of ""Counterpoint"" available for purchase.",1388448000,3,712,4.80327868852459

4336373,4,B004ECEH1I,"I saw this movie during the late 1960's.  I liked the music and excitement  very much  and have tried to order it several times since those days.  It became available on Amazon recently and I purchased a copy immediately.

The story concerns the tour of an American classical music orchestra in Belgium during the last part of World War II. The scenery is largely a castle and the forest surrounding it;  and the music is really fine with the works of Beethoven, Brahms, Wagner and Schubert interlaced during the story.  The main theme of this film is the competition between two strong personalities.  Lionel Evans (Charlton Heston) the American orchestra conductor, fears for the safety of his musicians;  and General Schiller (Maximilian Schell) is German commanding officer of troops pushing forward in the Battle of the Bulge.  Evans refuses to regard his orchestra as prisoners of war because they are all civilians.  Schiller only sees the inconvenience of having his forces be responsible for a musical group while he is bogged down in the battle.  He also wishes the orchestra to perform some of his favorite music.  Evans flatly refuses.  The question of what will happen to the orchestra once  German forces continue the offensive hangs over the whole story!

All types of individuals are intermingled  in this film and the constant sound of bombing in the distance supplies additional suspense.  I do not believe this movie ever received much acclaim or interest and it should have.  Both Heston and Schell gave really good performances.

4336374,3,B004ECEH1I,"An interesting, though slow paced and somewhat melodramatic take on the duel between two strong willed men.  Set against the backdrop of the waning days of WWII's European theater, the plot is a bit of a stretch, pitting German field officer Maxmillian Schell against authoritarian maestro Charlton Heston.  The two match wits over Schell's obsession to hear classical music played once more before his almost certain demise by the captured philharmonic orchestra being led by Heston.  What happens after the performance?  Will they be released by their captors or silenced?  For fans of Schell, a little know but good vehicle.",1379980800,5,627,5.23

4336376,3,B004ECEH1I,"It's not a great movie, but I saw it as a kid in 1968 and again on TV in the 1970s and liked it. My tastes were not so refined then, I guess! Apparently Universal Studios got the same vibes from the limited time the film was in release before going into the vaults to age. Now it's available as a special archives DVD issue, limited availability to a limited market...folks like me.
The story: An American orchestra touring for the USO in Belgium in December, 1944 finds itself captured by the advancing Waffen SS  unit spearheading the attack on Bastogne- the Battle of the Bulge. The SS orders are take no prisoners, but the German general is a fan of symphony music and Heston is ordered to prepare a special performance for the Jerries on the eve of the next big push. We viewers are privy to the fact that the musicians will then all be exterminated. Local resistance fighters arrange an escape for the group, and before its all over, conductor Heston is using a liberated German schmeiser machine pistol to conclude the concert...of course it's Wagner. Counterpoint in this sense is a musical term of two themes that oppose and attack each other as performed. Heston and Maximilian Schell ( the German SS General) perform their own counterpoint in a game of will against each other.  The cast is fleshed out with lots of faces from 1960s and 70s TV and movies you may recognize, especially Leslie Neilsen (Don't call me Shirley!) playing it straight as a dramatic actor as he was so often cast in that time period in Hollywood; and the usual crew of movie Germans as the ...Germans!
Like I said, I liked it then, and I liked it now too. Just don't take it too seriously as a WWII historical drama. Be entertained!",1370563200,7,1719,4.541935483870968
4336377,5,B004ECEH1I,During the Battle of the Bulge there were many tours entertaining the troops a la Bob Hope. I doubt that the Army would have allowed an entertainment unit to be close to the front however.,1370304000,,188,4.4

4336379,5,B004ECEH1I,"I've always loved this film:  the music is spectacular, the actors are intense and the plot unfolds in a timely manner.  Charlton Heston's performance was one of the finest I've seen and it was a real kick to see Leslie Nielson in a dramatic role.  Maximillian Schell's German General was believeable and surprisingly compassionate.  It is so wonderful that this film has FINALLY made it into DVD format (especially since it was never available even in VHS format).  It's a must see for any and all Heston fans!

4336381,4,B004ECEH1I,A little seen Charlton Heston film that I hadn't seen for several decades. A very nice widescreen presentation. A few nice surprises and a building tension make this a memorable film. And Schell as the German officer deciding the fate of an orchestra he admires makes for a very human bad guy.,1359504000,18,293,4.653846153846154
8426707,5,B004ECEH1I,"An American orchestra is doing a USO type tour during WWII in liberated Belgium when the Battle of the Bulge erupts. They are captured by the Germans who have a standing order to not take prisoners in order that they won't be slowed down with prisoners (btw, an order that was obeyed by the SS troops but not by many in the Wehrmacht). This particular German division has run out of petrol and is awaiting a supply, so the orchestra is taken to headquarters which happens to be a castle.

There, Charlton Heston, the maestro, is recognized by the commanding general (Maximillian Schell), who admired his pre-war performances. Heston recognizes that for Schell to become a general at such a young age he must be a military genius, so we are essentially informed that both men are geniuses. Heston refuses to perform for Schell, much less play Wagner, so the orchestra whiles the time away rehearsing. Meanwhile Schells subordinate, Anton Diffring (poor guy, forever typecast in endless movies as a Nazi), is itching to execute them all. A cat and mouse game between the two arrogant men ensues.

It is true, as some readers have pointed out, that the basic premise of this movie is contrived since the German troops would not have cared about noncombatants, but would have simply bypassed them. But if you accept the premise (which is not really that farfetched), the movie (and the music) can be enjoyed. Everyone's performance was excellent.",1515024000,,1442,4.857723577235772

An orchester performing for soldiers fighting in Europe, is taken prisoner by Nazis, what happens there, what they do, and how they escape is most exciting. But the music is the best.
