8086278,5,B000BFYKNM,"Concert is fantastic, Cliff always delivers top rate musical entertainment - DVD is great!
Minor problem, there errors and misspellings on back of packaging which was a little disappointing",1404604800,,189,5.551724137931035
8086279,4,B000BFYKNM,"I love this concert, and cliff sounds as good as ever!  There were times when the stage looked a little too ""busy"" .
Too many dancers!! I like it best when Cliff sings alone one stage.",1389052800,,184,4.111111111111111
8086280,5,B000BFYKNM,"Someone goofed!  Although the packaging says 13 songs, this DVD has 28 songs.  And so the run time is over 135 minutes long not 80 minutes as listed.  The rest of the songs are:  14)  Move It  15) Even If It Breaks My Heart  16) Can't Keep This Feeling In  17) Every Time We Say Goodbye  18) Hope Faith And You  19) We Don't Talk Anymore  20) She Makes Me Feel Like A Man  21) The Miracle  22) Butterfly Kisses  23) Nessun Norma  24) Vita Mia  25) Devil Woman  26) Ocean Deep  27) It'll Be Me  28) Peace In Our Time.

Excellent concert by Cliff.  He looks great for his age.  And he can still sing and dance around the stage like he is 20 years old.  Very lively performance.  Great orchestra band and back up singers backing him.  If you're a Cliff Richard fan, this is the one to see and keep as a collection.",1168819200,21,811,4.044871794871795
