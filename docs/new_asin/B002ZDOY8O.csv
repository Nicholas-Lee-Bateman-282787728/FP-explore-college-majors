4017273,5,B002ZDOY8O,Gale Harold is the best actor I have seen in a long time. It would be nice to see him on a TV show.,1271635200,,99,3.1666666666666665
4017274,5,B002ZDOY8O,"I had the pleasure of living in Chinatown for a summer and consider the best place in NYC.  When I saw this movie, I remembered visiting the places you see in the movie.  It brought back some wonderful memories for me.  I also love Gale Harold.  I have been a huge fan of his for a long time, and this movie just proves that he is leading man material.  I will make sure I tell everyone about this gem!",1270252800,10,402,4.037974683544304
4017275,5,B002ZDOY8O,"I don't mean to minimize Fay Ann Lee's accomplishment in making this film. She wrote, directed and stars in it and she's great. She did a great job of addressing the stereotypes that Asian Americans face, and the plight of poor people, too. As this style of mistaken identity plot goes, this is a really nice treatment.

My main recommendation, though, is that it's a must see for Gale Harold fans. Gale isn't exactly a household word, but he's got an avid and loyal fan base who go to rather extreme lengths to see his movies, up to and including tracking down the producers and lobbying for distribution. Until now, Gale's movies tended to be very dark, laden with violent deaths, emotionally tense story lines and exceedingly unhappy endings. I'm sure they were great parts for an actor who takes his craft seriously, but for a fan that just wants to revel in the work of their favorite actor, they weren't exactly films you could share with your family, watch with your uninitiated friends or just enjoy over and over. This goes at the top of my list of Chick Flicks I'll watch dozens of times, and yes, that's a very good thing. It's such a relief to see Gale using his considerable comedic skills for a change!

There are also interesting appearances by Stephanie March, her husband Bobby Flay, Margaret Cho, Christine Baranski, B.D. Wong and Lewis Black, all of whom are perfectly cast for their particular roles.

Highly recommended for lovers of romantic comedies. It's an instant hit.",1267142400,41,1494,4.7384615384615385

It was racist( am I wrong or did they bleach her skin on the cover) stereotypical and embarrassing to watch. Unless cheating, wealthy, white men and an Asian woman being ashamed of her family is what works for you.
Interracial couples do face stumbling blocks from both sides. Here was an opportunity to showcase their struggles and instead we get a liar and a cheater who live happily ever after?? The irony being, she is named after Cinderella...",1432339200,,605,4.611111111111111

4017358,2,B002ZDOY8O,"I admit, I'm coming to this movie a number of years after it was released, but I found it offensive in so many ways that I had to say something.  First, I'm Asian and I was married to a white man so I have personal experience with building bridges on both sides. I was really excited to see an interracial couple, particularly an Asian/White couple in a film.  Those pairings are rare.  Based on the director's website, I was expecting to see the depth of what it means to be in an interracial and intercultural relationship. Instead, it turned into one stereotype after another.  But let's start with chemistry - there isn't any between the two actors.  Gale Harold is a wonderful actor.  He can convey an entire dialogue in one facial expression.  Unfortunately, the two of them together just don't work.  The lines sound totally fake and delivered like they are reading the script word for word.  Fay Ann Lee should probably stay behind the camera.  Now for the stereotypes:  Most Chinese people do not work in sweatshops and most Asians speak English.  Then why oh why did Lee have to pick the most common image that an ignorant American public thinks of when they think of Chinese immigrants?  In one of the last scenes of the film, Andrew goes looking for Grace at her parents' house.  They talk on the street and he is shouting in English at them.  Just because people can't speak English, doesn't mean they're deaf.  Seriously???  Grace, although, she is supposed to be this strong, high powered business woman living her dream life in NYC, is played as someone who is weak - another stereotype of Asian women.  She is ASHAMED OF HER PARENTS.  I understand that the whole premise of the film was based on the initial misunderstanding about Grace's identity but to lie about her parents who do nothing but love her was hard for me to watch and frankly, not believable.  Andrew Barrington is the rich, white proverbial knight in shining armor, ready to rescue the poor Chinese people working in sweat shops. Hey, look, he can even speak a few words of Chinese here and there, magically bridging the cultural divide.  Can we say Colonialism?  Other reviewers have stated that they don't like the hypocrisy of his character: he is upset with Grace for lying about who she is, but he's been lying to his girlfriend since he met Grace.  Yes, it's true, but honestly, I think that's one of the few strengths of the film.  People aren't perfect and their actions are contradictory and often hypocritical.  We're all like that - perfectly flawed.  Another bright note in a film that was otherwise cringe worthy: who knew Gale Harold could be funny?  He has funny and lighthearted moments in this film and it's so surprising and refreshing.  He should do comedy more often. Other than that, everything was one big clich.",1405900800,3,2818,4.684317718940937

4017363,2,B002ZDOY8O,"The only thing new here was the Asian lead and unfortunately that doesn't make up for the script and some very wooden acting (on all parts).

The movie has a feel good ending.  There is some humor mixed into the story along the way.  Decent movie.",1403568000,,423,4.533333333333333
4017365,5,B002ZDOY8O,"What some reviewers don't seem to realise is that Andrew is not engaged - he is being pressurized to pop the question, but he is in doubt.  He finds that his life is empty but everything changes when he meets Grace.  This is very good movie and I highly recommend it as a happy, funny story.  There is also more meaning in it; seeing the things that matter in life and having the courage to stand up for what you believe is right.  I rented the movie but am now going to buy it.",1400803200,3,478,4.053191489361702
4017376,3,B002ZDOY8O,I had to watch this movie a second time to really appreciate it for what it was.  It had a good story to it about the caring of one's family.  The plot was a good one and her concern for her family very touching.  It could be a real life situation that many people could face.  The ending was a good one.,1389571200,,304,3.8548387096774195

4017385,1,B002ZDOY8O,"I had other family movies that had the preview for this movie on it and the previews made it look great.  However, I wouldn't consider it a good family movie to watch because it doesn't instill good family values.  Instead, it makes cheating acceptable (as long as it shows that your fiancee likes the prestige more than the relationship and family expectations) and what appears to be premarital sex.  Grace is condemned in the movie for lying to the guy that she loves (the one who is cheating on his fiancee) and the conflict in the movie is about her struggle with her mistaken identity and coming clean about it.  But nothing is said at all about her love interest cheating on his fiancee with Grace.  He buys jewelry for her and lies to his fiancee about having to work late, Grace knows that he's engaged but doesn't have a problem with becoming a second love interest in his life and the whole infidelity issue doesn't even seem to be a problem.  Other than the fact that in the end he chooses to be with Grace.  It was disappointing.",1340928000,19,1042,4.481481481481482

The images would not stay still. Just the video transfer was flawed. Amazon sent me a replacement. The same happened again. I asked for them to call the manufacture to do a make good on my purchase. To find me a decent dub of the movie.

Yes, Amazon refunded my money. But do you think the customer service department would even listen to me. I wanted to buy this movie. So why can't a manager from Amazon, call the distributor of the movie. Tell them the problem and I try to get me this movie.

I rate the movie as good. Amazon's customer service as very poor. Even trying to hear me out to make good my purchase. Yes, the refund is fine. But they could have tried harder to call the manufacture and make good my purchase.",1339545600,,899,4.160919540229885

4017388,4,B002ZDOY8O,"I got this movie as I adore GALE HAROLD.  His acting was again convincing.  The storyline is traditional - girl meets boy and falls in love etc. but I also loved the comedy situations that arose from time to time.  Made me laugh, especially when tricks were being played e.g.  language interpretations, Graces parents were just people she was helping out etc.  Liked in the end that the guy got the right girl and was prepared to follow her.  Would recommend people buy, especially if you like GALE HAROLD.",1316476800,,506,4.629213483146067
4017389,1,B002ZDOY8O,"This movie is about a cheater, but made to look like a love story. The main story is about a Chinese American woman, Grace, that lies about her identify to get into this high class committee. Then, she meets this white guy, Andrew, two times his white girlfriend for Grace. That's right. Grace doesn't know he already dating someone and what's worse is that the couple was about to get married too. (Otherwise, if Grace would had know this, you think really Grace would had gone out with him? No way. Unless, she wanted drama with him. But, what do you think?)

Eventually, the truth about Grace's identify comes out and Andrew leaves Grace. (And, Andrew wasn't being truthful to her either.) Then, Andrews gets back with original girlfriend. (It was that simple for him to do that. His girlfriend never knew that he cheater on her in the first place with Grace. WOW!) The whole story should had just ended there, but it didn't.

At this point, both women still don't know, Andrew playing two different women. (Amazing skills man. What a player.)

The Andrew, the cheater, should had stopped while he was ahead, but he doesn't stop. He wants to go the distance. (Okay. Why not? lol) He goes running back to Grace and supposedly dumps his original girlfriend for Grace. (But we don't actually know that. We never actual see that in the movie. He never actually dumps his girlfriend. It doesn't show it. I mean both women don't know about each other still. Nope. Never happened. Andrew could actually be keeping his girlfriend on the sidelines still for awhile longer. Nice!)

Then, it shows that he actually decides to marry Grace in a photo. (I don't expect the marriage to last. Once a cheater, always a cheater.)

The movie is called, Falling for Grace? lol

A better name: ""The Ultimate PlayBoy!""

Well, I got to give credit where credit is due. This guy, knows how to play the field. For all you out there that are in a relationships and are open to still looking around for dates (secretly). All you need to do is, watch Andrew and how he does it. You'll be surprised how easy it is. Don't forget to take good notes!",1312243200,6,2121,4.580474934036939

I wanted to see how he would be in a different genre, and he surpassed my expectations.  Not only was he charming in the movie, but can he get anymore beautiful?  The interaction between the two stars was believable, and Grace's Asian parents were a hoot!  If you wish to view a cool romantic flick, I highly recommend it.",1283644800,,488,4.25
4017394,4,B002ZDOY8O,"Hoenstly, I bought this movie because I love Gale Harold.  But I wound up really enjoying this movie.  It's a sweet little gem that has something for everyone. The family can watch it together, and no matter your ethnic background I know there are pieces of everyone's parents, grandparents, and other family members in Grace's family.  Gale looks great and he smiles which I don't think he has done a whole lot of in past projects. He looks like he is having fun and he gets to show a bit of goofiness that is adorable.

When I think ""NYC romantic comedy"" there are plenty of movies that come to mind, usually with a more famous cast and just a bigger budget and bigger scope. This movie, while it does have plenty of ""names"" in it, just seems like a smaller, and sweeter version of all the big movies I am thinking of.

Yes, there are some plot holes, some things that don't make sense even after repeated watchings, but I really don't care. Just enjoy it, enjoy the fantasy of that type of romance that only seems to happen in New York City.",1281052800,,1044,4.38860103626943
