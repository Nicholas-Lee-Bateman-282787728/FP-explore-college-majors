Most of the DVD was at a very advanced skill level but still helpfull for advanced beginners interested in learning how but not worried about being able.",1257724800,,251,4.7272727272727275
8098169,4,B000CEGXYG,"It's a treat to get a 75-minute lesson from one of bluegrass music's finest instrumentalists. Entitled ""classic bluegrass mandolin,"" this 75-minute lesson (originally recorded in 1989) would have been more aptly named ""crosspicking."" The most renowned purveyor of that style is of course Jesse McReynolds. With relaxed and personable manner, McReynolds starts by demonstrating his own composition, ""Ridge Runner."" Although in the key of A (Jesse's favorite for crosspicking), it may have been better to start the lesson with the second tune, ""Banks of the Ohio,"" as that standard is more familiar and can be played without ever breaking your roll. A conversation with Sam Bush covers how Jesse first got started ""playing backwards."" Jesse talks about his influences (Bill Monroe, Blue Sky Boys, Earl Scruggs, Hoke Jenkins), and mandolin set-up. It's interesting that Jesse's strings sit wider apart than normal on the very high elevated bridge on his Stiver rosewood mandolin. We even get a laugh when shown his double-jointed thumb and crooked little finger.

The DVD offers a menu to quickly access the songs or 37 individual chapter locations. Besides crosspicking, the Grand Ole Opry member (since 1964) also briefly covers chord formations, exercises, variations, endings, backward rolls and his unique method for splitting strings. The songs presented include ""Ridge Runner,"" ""Banks of the Ohio,"" ""Dill Pickle Rag,"" ""Farewell Blues,"" and ""Snowbird."" Views of both right and left hands are shown as McReynolds plays them up tempo, slowly, broken down by section, or with variations. Sam Bush admits, ""Crosspicking is absolutely the hardest thing for me to do on the mandolin."" This lesson is best for intermediate and advanced players who already have good technique and knowledge of their instrument. ""Classic Bluegrass Mandolin"" will help you enhance your playing with crosspicking and more. (Joe Ross, staff writer, Bluegrass Now)",1142640000,,1938,5.438538205980066
