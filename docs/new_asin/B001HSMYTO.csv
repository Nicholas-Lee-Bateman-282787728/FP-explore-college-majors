3643893,5,B001HSMYTO,"I just saw Mr. Asman's piece. You produce an absolute block-buster video and you release it on Nov 13, i.e. AFTER the elections? Why not in 2010? On whose payroll is Fox News? What pressures did you guys give in to? You MUST put this video IMMEDIATELY on the market not just on tape but in DVD format as well. Otherwise you are a worthless bunch of wimps. I certainly would buy it now for myself and for a few of my friends who did not see the show. But on Nov. 13....? I expect you to run this show many times between now and the elections: IN PRIME TIME. If not, by-by ratings! You can probably tell that I am ""a little"" upset. And yes, I am shouting at you.",1223683200,17,660,4.0458015267175576
3643894,5,B001HSMYTO,Every American needs to watch this before they vote.  A very revealing documentary on how we got into this financial mess and which people played a very big role in allowing this to happen.,1223683200,5,189,4.5588235294117645
3643895,5,B001HSMYTO,"Thorough and honest analysis of really cause the financial mess - Fannie Mae and the politicians who are now on TV blaming the ""Administration"" when in fact they took money from Fannie Mae.  Barack's financial advisor made $90 million while running Fannie Mae into the ground. Obama also received the 2nd highest campaign contribution in all time from them. The highest was Democrat Christopher Dodd who heads the Banking Subcommittee.  These corrupt politicians forced the banks to make bad loans so they could get votes and campaign contributions.  The truth is they, like Chuck Shummer, Christopher Dodd, Barnie Franks (mostly democrats) got big campaign contributions from Fannie Mae.  Christopher Dodd got a low priced loan to boot.  You have to see this!! It's eye opening and scary.

3643896,5,B001HSMYTO,Your special was really great. Very well done and very clear. To the point and specific.  It named names: The SOB's that need to be punished; Those who tried to prevent the meltdown that should be recognized and commended.  Thanks for your fairness and objectiveness.  PLEASE RERUN THIS SPECIAL OVER AND OVER UNTIL THE ELECTION.  AMERICA NEEDS TO HEAR THIS.  IT MAY TAKE A WHILE TO SOAK IN.,1223683200,2,390,4.676470588235294
3643897,5,B001HSMYTO,"I just watched this segment of Fox news and it hammers it down to the nitty gritty and addresses the issues and who and what group has initally caused the breakdown in the economy. I wish everyone could see this.  There would be a clear choice for president in the election Nov 4, 2008.

Thanks to all who worked so hard to develope this program. Extremely  insightful.",1223683200,2,369,4.477611940298507
3643898,5,B001HSMYTO,"This is perhaps the most important work of video journalism of the twenty-first century, not simply because it exposes so perfectly the kind of corruption that the Obama/Reins team has been involved in for years--and how that corruption has been pivotal in the destruction of our economy, but also because it raises powerful questions about the role of the New Deal in prolonging the Great Depression--based on new research. This is a must see for every citizen of these United States of America. A masterpiece of scholarship, eridition, and sound economic analysis which the averagee person can easily grasp and enjoy. Give yourself the pleasure of clarity on an issue which has been rendered unnecessarily difficult by the pundits. What a joy to finally understand what is happening in the financial markets!",1223683200,3,810,5.143939393939394
3643899,5,B001HSMYTO,Every American must see this to learn how we got into the present economic mess we are in. Extremely well researched and easily understood.,1223683200,2,139,4.833333333333333
3643900,5,B001HSMYTO,I find this very bipartisan explanation. This documentary is incredible. It lays blame at the feet of the people who simply make excuses for what they did/didn't do or see. Absolutely amazing!,1223683200,,192,5.03125
8309480,5,B001HSMYTO,"This is the largely untold story of the housing & subsequent market crash of 2008 (produced around Oct 2008).  This is a fact-filled hour long documentary.  Besides describing Mortgage Backed Securities and other investments, Fox News pointed the finger of blame at Congress which wanted home ownership rates to go up - no matter what the risk was.  Credit insurance ran out and organizations like AIG and Lehman Brothers ran out of money.  Then the stock market went down.",1423440000,,473,4.949367088607595
8309481,5,B001HSMYTO,Everyone really should watch this. Shows you just who is mostly to blame for the current economy.,1288656000,,97,4.764705882352941
8309482,5,B001HSMYTO,"As Americans and journalists it is imperative that you release this video immediately or AT LEAST MAKE IT AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADING AND RE-RUN IT DURING PRIME TIME on a frequent basis. Put it up on your website for viewing. This is so extremely important, you MUST share your detailed research right now.  We are in a crisis economically and ready to vote for a new leader.  The information in the piece MUST be provided to Americans so they can truly make an informed decision. After November 4th it WILL BE TOO LATE. You won't sell them then so make them available NOW, release it NOW.  It's your job to share the information, PLEASE, it's your civic duty.  This piece is so well thought out, researched and unbiased it would be a crime against the people not to share it in EVERY way possible BEFORE THE ELECTION.  It's not about money, it's about our Country. Please find a way to get this in front of the American people, please!",1223856000,2,934,4.535714285714286
8309483,5,B001HSMYTO,"I watched this program last night.  It helped me to understand what really happened to cause this financial meltdown and the government officials that allowed it to happen.  It is my opinion, like others, that it needs to aired as often as possible before the elections, so that people can make better decisions on who they want to run their government. I thought I could purchase this CD today, and was disappointed that it is not available to the public until after the elections. I wont't need it then, it needs to be shared now!",1223769600,,532,4.589473684210526
8309484,5,B001HSMYTO,I agree with the others who have urged you to rebroadcast this special before the election -- at a time when people will see it!  This is one of the most important issues we will face in our lifetime and many will vote without seeing how we got here.  I intended to order several copies for friends and relatives -- very disappointed it is not now available.,1223769600,,358,4.3283582089552235
8309485,5,B001HSMYTO,"This is indeed one of the best programs that I have seen in the entire two-year election process, but WHY release in November?  We need it out NOW BEORE VOTING!!!

8309486,5,B001HSMYTO,Please release this DVD now!  It is so important for all Americans to understand what caused the economic crisis we now face. Overridding sound business practices with social engineering legislation is dangerous.  People need to understand this now rather than after the election.  I would a dozen copies NOW in order to educate my friends.  But I'll be less inclined to due so in November after it may be too late to make a difference.,1223769600,3,436,4.773333333333333
8309487,5,B001HSMYTO,"Excellent, well documented analysis of the problem with government interference in business.  This document should receive as much airing as possible prior to the election.  It does absolutely no good to release this vital information after the election.  This is a tack government would take.  I expect better from Fox.  I had intended to order several copies to send to wavering Republicans and for my college age grandson, but with a November release date it is not worth the money.  It is like closing the door after the politicians have absconded with our money.",1223769600,,567,4.9787234042553195
8309488,5,B001HSMYTO,"This is an excellent description of the sequence of events leading to the current financial crisis. It gives times, dates, places, and names names, on both sides of the aisle. Many good video clips of the players giving their views, again on both sides. An account of what legislation promoted which actions, who supported it and who didn't, what the results of each was, who warned, who got warned, what the response was, etc.

If you have wanted to know how we got into this mess, this is a great reference.",1223683200,,509,4.593406593406593
8309489,5,B001HSMYTO,"Also show it as much as possible during PRIME TIME rather than late on the weekend.  Every American needs to put some thought into this election before casting their vote.  Electing more of the same people into positions of power who have betrayed us for their own extreme political views is not an option this time around.

Try to catch this special on Fox News if you care about making an intelligent decision this November!",1223683200,,426,4.653333333333333
