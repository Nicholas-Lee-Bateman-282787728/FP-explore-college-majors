8571916,3,B00BOLPENW,"This is a collection of 100 great AKB48 & 48 sister-groups songs performed live.

The show has ""Live"" labeled in the upper right corner of the screen, so I understand that this was a Televised event?

The good news: You get 100 songs, and the girls are super cute and wear a variety of great outfits.  They also talk to the audience and perform little ""skits"".  (There is one where they make fun of someone named ""A.M."" and have fun kidding the recently graduated Atsuko Maeda.)  Unless you understand Japanese these long talks to the audience, and the jokes -- will be lost on English speakers.  Many of my favorite songs are performed in this collection.

The bad news: The sound quality of the musical numbers is very muddled.  You can make up for it perhaps if you have a good sound system and turn it up loud.  One of my favorites is ""Sounds Good"" but you cannot really hear the music very well. It is unfortunate because the songs are great ... if you have the CDs or performance video DVDs.

If you are already an AKB48 fan, and are familiar with the songs you will like this.  However, if you are trying to introduce others to the wonderful AKB48 songs they will probably not be impressed.",1376870400,,1197,4.444954128440367
