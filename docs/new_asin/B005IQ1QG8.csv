He cant go home unless he recovers this money. Another man rides up. Link tells Miss Wright about his past. They leave in wagons drawn by two horses. Coley drops his guns to fight Link.

But Lasso is deserted! There is a conflict and shooting. Two gang members ride into town and find the body. They go after Link. They begin shooting. Link talks to Claude, both are wounded. Only one will survive. Link rides back to the wagons and finds Billie. Link tells Dock he will take him in; he has outlived his past. Dock shoots at Link, whose return fire is accurate. One wagon continues the journey. What will Billie do now? The wagon continues on the road.

Overall, this is a story like The Asphalt Jungle or The Maltese Falcon where the dreams of sudden wealth by robbery fail and lead to a bad end for the bad guys. It is about average, with a lot of stationary scenes like in a stage play, even though it takes place outdoors. The limited cast suggests a low budget.",1509840000,,2276,4.360849056603773
