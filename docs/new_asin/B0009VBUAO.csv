8311678,3,B0009VBUAO,"In ""El Vecindario (los Mexicanos calientes)"", one gets the usual dosage of the zany, vulgar, and low-brow humor that is to be expected from the subgenre that is the ""sex-comedy"".
And loosely translated means: ""The Neighborhood: Those Hot-Blooded Mexicans"" (from 1981 and directed by Gilberto Martinez Solares).
Comical-actor Alfonso Zayas, plays a chauffeur to a wealthy businessman; where both men seemingly get embroiled in various wild antics and situations, which in turn introduces the other characters that are brought into play. While the film itself was quite funny, the only real FFN was provided by platinum-blond beauty Anglica Chain (including a hot shower scene). The rest of the female cast included the voluptuous Rossy Mendoza and Ana Luisa Peluffo.

The rest of the cast: Alfonso Zayas, Rafael Incln, Freddy Fernandez, Gilberto Trujillo, etc. Overall not bad, but lacking in FFN (which is to be expected for this type of fare), and there was also some unredeemable elements to the storyline itself. The DVD picture and sound quality is very good, NTSC, Spanish (no English subtitles), NR 86 mins.

Love and Peace,
