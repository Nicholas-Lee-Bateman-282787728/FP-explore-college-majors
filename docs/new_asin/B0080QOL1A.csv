5116321,5,B0080QOL1A,The only movie on here that I hadn't seen was Brideshead.  It isn't one of my favorite movies now either. The version of Jane Eyre was very nice as was Becoming Jane.,1357084800,3,166,4.1875

5116324,5,B0080QOL1A,I really did and still do enjoy these movies they are almost as good as reading a book - books are (to me) much better than movies - I guess our imaginations are better than those who write/direct movies.,1355011200,4,204,4.256410256410256

5116358,3,B0080QOL1A,"I had Becoming Jane, and the other two were OK, but not my favorite.  I was disapointed in Brideshead Revisited.  I don't think I would order others that I had no idea of what they are about.",1402790400,,191,4.135135135135135
5116359,4,B0080QOL1A,"The movies are all done well, but the big problem is they are not captioned, and it was difficult to understand the rapid British speech.  I felt I missed a lot.  Most older people that would like this set of movies would appreciate captioning.",1402790400,,244,4.5227272727272725
5116360,5,B0080QOL1A,"These were all really well done. I wish that the actress playing Jayne Eyre had been a little prettier in this version....it makes it difficult to believe that a master of such a large estate and social position would so readily fall in love with someone so unsocial and plain....but then, perhaps her oddness is what attracted him and that is what made the story so interesting.  The acting was good in all three movies.",1400198400,,421,4.613333333333333
5116361,4,B0080QOL1A,"I purchased this set because of ""Becoming Jane"" and ""Jane Eyre."" I had never read Brideshead Revisited and I do wish that someone would have warned me about the repulsive homosexual nature of the movie. I won't be watching it ever again, yet because all three movies are on one disc (which I did not realise when purchasing :/ ) I can't get rid of the one movie I dislike. That said, Becoming Jane and Jane Eyre are entirely perfect, as expected.",1399248000,3,446,4.451219512195122
5116362,4,B0080QOL1A,"In 19th century romantic literature love and melancolia find a way of bonding and leaving impressions of lives mispent. While 21st century viewers hunger for simple clarity, these productions raise questions that go unansweres, leaving the viewer to insert her own personality into the story.  They are as pleaing as oes on character pleases.

5116364,3,B0080QOL1A,These are movies i have seen before i thought some was ok. The other movies on the same dvd was terrible that is a good reason to not buy them together..c.m.,1392249600,,157,4.096774193548387
5116365,5,B0080QOL1A,"I loved re-capturing the class in these older British flicks.  The great price added to the enjoyment. (Just remember that older film quality does not meet current day standards, even when enhanced.)",1392076800,,199,5.21875

5116367,5,B0080QOL1A,I love these kinds of videos.  The price is right for such a wealth of entertainment. You can't beat the classics.,1391904000,,114,4.428571428571429
5116388,3,B0080QOL1A,The films were OK but I think that it's inexcusable not to have captions.  I couldn't understand half of what was being said!,1391472000,,125,4.434782608695652
5116389,1,B0080QOL1A,"Brideshead revisited made me ill, and this particular version of  Jane Eyre was the worst yet to date. William Hurt is not a fit Edward Rochester, and Becoming Jane was just OK, nothing to get excited about. Really a bad selection, this one, in my humble opinion.",1391472000,,263,4.595744680851064

5116391,3,B0080QOL1A,Not closed captioned! Not sure how you can sell a movie (or set) and it not have this included. Good movies though.,1389571200,,115,4.2727272727272725
5116392,3,B0080QOL1A,"I loved Bridgehead Revisited.  Excellent film and the first of three on the DVD.  I was enraptured with Becoming Jane until the DVD quit working and simply stopped three quarters through the movie.  I bought this DVD in September 2012, then had some personal family problems so was not able to watch it until now.  The DVD is defective but I can't return it because it is past the deadline.  Unfortunate.  The price was excellent but I am disappointed that I can't watch anymore of the DVD.  Sort of like having to leave the theater when a movie that you love is half over.  Sad.",1389398400,,579,4.447619047619048
5116393,5,B0080QOL1A,Very nice interesting  movies- all three of them. Itis worth aquiring. If you like classics it is a good choice.,1389312000,,112,4.6
5116394,5,B0080QOL1A,Bought these as Christmas gifts for specific friends.  They're all favorites of mine.  I look forward to watching them again with the recipients.,1385337600,,145,5.260869565217392
5116395,3,B0080QOL1A,"I gave this three stars because the disc skipped a couple times, and I really only enjoyed one of the movies. I realize that's merely preference, but I gravitate toward period films because they tend to be clean and unobjectionable for children, etc. These films, not entirely so.
Subtitles were not an option on these films, which was also unfortunate.",1384387200,,353,4.9
5116396,5,B0080QOL1A,"This was a gift for a bedridden family member they wanted Jane Eyre I thought it would be nice for them to have two other movies. So their home health aide doesn't have to keep changing the DVD for another DVD. Well, the home health aide was happy and so was my family member.

Great Price

Great Sound

Great Picture",1383004800,,317,4.25

5116398,2,B0080QOL1A,Hmm so much for watching the classics. Not my thing. Anne Hathaway wtf? What did you just say for the last hour? I dunno. The other films weren't my cup of tea. On the plus note youll feel like you made an attempt to understand British drama...then your resort to American visually action oriented films. lol,1381190400,,308,4.517857142857143
5116399,2,B0080QOL1A,I sent this dvd back because two of the three movies started playing 1/2 way into the movie.  I tried to hit the back button and go back to the beginning and it was impossible to go back and get the movie to start at the beginning.  I did contact the seller and they allowed me to return it and refunded my money.  I was happy with my treatment by the seller.,1380844800,,359,3.9583333333333335
5116400,1,B0080QOL1A,"The picture quality is really bad.  The picture is grainy and not focused and crisp as dvds usually are (obviously DVD's are not anything like bluray but the quality should be the best for the dvd and this movie it is not). The sound is also affected.  It's hard to hear voices and it sounds a little muffled.
I went to target and got the original Becoming Jane to compare the picture quality/and sound to see if it was just me being picky, but no it wasn't. The QUALITY is poor and I would not buy it if I were you! Don't waste your money!",1379289600,4,540,4.133333333333334
5116401,3,B0080QOL1A,"This collection was ok.  Not every film can be a "" Pride and Prejudice""  Six more words are required now.",1378339200,,105,4.2
5116402,5,B0080QOL1A,"I absolutely adored ""Becoming Jane"" which made me feel like I was reliving being in Jane Austen's world. Beautiful setting, costumes and story. Highly recommended.
""Brideshead Revisited"" was also well done - did not enjoy the story as much, but the lavish setting made up for what it was lacking.
""Jane Eyre"" - one of my favorite novels of all time - and a very lovely rendition. Perfect performances and not disappointing in the least - keen attention to detail.
All in all a thoroughly enjoyable purchase !!",1377648000,3,509,4.795454545454546
5116403,4,B0080QOL1A,"Come on,  a heading???  Jane is far too plane or is it plain?  I think the second.  The expansion over 1939 keeps with the book, but I am notsure that shortening it was a better plot line.  Mack",1377561600,,194,4.0
5116404,5,B0080QOL1A,"Three in one rocks, these British movies cost a arm and a leg, it is just to wonderful to get three for the price one! Thanks for the rapid delivery too!",1376524800,,153,3.967741935483871
5116405,5,B0080QOL1A,We enjoy Miramax productions as a rule and this is a fun way to do so.  We highly recommend this collection.,1376179200,,108,4.142857142857143
5116406,4,B0080QOL1A,These are standard tried and true British fare.  Enjoyable every time.  And love the convenience of 3 movies on one disk.,1375747200,,121,4.714285714285714
5116407,3,B0080QOL1A,Would only play  black & white No control over format letterbox unsuitable for older TVs. good collection of stories but poor presentation,1374969600,,138,5.2727272727272725
5116418,5,B0080QOL1A,"I love each one of these movies!  Each one stands alone as great purchase, but together, they make a powerhouse DVD.  You can't go wrong with this purchase.",1374105600,,156,4.535714285714286
5116419,5,B0080QOL1A,"Becoming Jane is great with Anne Hathaway portraying Jane Austen well. Maggie Smith matches her in star appeal. Brideshead Revisited is a remade tale that is well told. Story of classes in British society between the two world wars. Jane Eyre is remade pretty well. I just love the story of the governess who makes good, after a torturous childhood.",1374019200,2,349,4.833333333333333

5116421,5,B0080QOL1A,"I thought all the movies in the collection were good.  I thought  Anne Hathaway was terrific as Jane Austen.  I also likes Brideshead Revisted.  I had not seen it and the story was very good.  Good cast, good story, makes you realize you shouldn't envy what you don't have.  Also Jane Eyre was nicely done.  I liked the version with Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine but this was well done.  The girl playing Jane did a good job.",1373155200,2,426,4.371794871794871

5116423,5,B0080QOL1A,What could be better for a lover of Jane Austen then this threesome. I am enjoying it over and over again.,1372982400,,106,4.095238095238095
5116424,4,B0080QOL1A,I enjoyed 'Becoming Jane' and 'Jane Eyre'. I have never seen the actress who played Jane Eyre. The third movie was strange to me.,1372550400,,129,4.416666666666667

5116426,5,B0080QOL1A,Great Collection for Jane Austen fans and fans of British Classic literature. Great Purchase for a girls night in with friends or a rainy weekend.,1370131200,,146,4.88
5116427,4,B0080QOL1A,I have to say I bought this because I love Becoming Jane! Brideshead Revisited and Jane Eyre were just bonuses. I still love the newest Jane Eyre though!,1369526400,,153,4.5
5116438,4,B0080QOL1A,Brideshead revisited is a haunting tale.  Becoming Jane is very interesting and entertaining.  Jayne Eyre is always a pleasure to read/watch!,1369440000,,141,5.666666666666667
5116439,4,B0080QOL1A,"Brideshead revisited are not as engaging as the other two of the collection, which are most definitively excellent productions, esp. Becoming Jane, a true classic.",1368403200,,163,5.56

5116442,5,B0080QOL1A,I have watched 2 of the 3 movies on here and loved them both. Great value if you are into the historical romany type of movies. I like beening able to get more then one movie on a DVD then I have something new to watch all weekend long.,1367452800,,236,3.836734693877551
5116443,5,B0080QOL1A,Each of these films are masterpieces not to be missed.  This is truly a must buy to be enjoyed with someone special.,1367452800,,116,4.2727272727272725
5116444,4,B0080QOL1A,"As some other reviewers have already said, there are occasonal problems with the picture and the audio, still for the price this is a good collection.

The lead actress in Becoming Jane is perhaps too comely to play Jane Austen, but that is hardly her fault.  The movie is still interesting, especially for an Austen enthusiast.

All three movies are well acted and scripted (I would be lynched by my friends if I criticized Jane Eyre), ahd they are well done.  Perhaps if I were willing to pay twice the amount for each movie by itself the  video and audio problems would not exist, but I doubt it.

I don't pretend to be a critic of the cinema, all I can say is I enjoyed these movies.  Try it, you'll like it.",1367193600,,712,4.348484848484849
5116445,5,B0080QOL1A,"I am giving it 5 stars because both Jane Eyre and Becoming Jane are really good, high quality movies. Brideshead Revisited did not belong in this mix. The acting was good but the subject matter was not family-friendly and would probably be very offensive to many folks.  If you order it be warned that it contains some heavy material on homosexuality.",1366502400,,351,4.754098360655738
5116446,5,B0080QOL1A,"Two movies for Austin that I really enjoyed, well done and great for anyone wanting to write.  Brideshead I didn't like personally, prefer the true stories and less immorality.",1366156800,,176,5.068965517241379

5116449,2,B0080QOL1A,"I did not care for ""Becoming Jane"" or ""Brideshead Revisited.""  This version of ""Jane Eyre"" was only marginal; it lacked the powerful performance seen by Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles ~ perhaps because the actors' perfomances were too subdued.",1365465600,5,243,5.230769230769231

5116451,5,B0080QOL1A,All three of these movies were worth watching more than one time.  It was a really good buy for thee movies at this price.  I am so glad I purchased this DVD,1364688000,,157,3.875

5116453,3,B0080QOL1A,"I bought this combo movies just to she the movie Return to Brideshead, which I have never seen.  I have the other two movies and I really enjoyed watching them,  I have to say the Brideshead movie was entirely BORING.  In fact I stopped watching it because it was just not entertaining, in fact I fell asleep during it and have not wanted to see the rest of the movie.  I gave it 3 stars just because of the other two movies. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ",1364428800,,442,4.289156626506024

5116458,5,B0080QOL1A,"Jane Austen's  novels always took readers by the heart. Now, the reason is revealed with Ann Hathaway's  compellingly portrayal of the real Jane.  Poor, but outspoken, Jane is an intelligent girl who prefers love above safety. Becoming Jane sets the stage, and the two stories that follow open more windows that expose the emotions that Austen must have felt in her personal search for love..",1362614400,10,392,5.0

5116472,5,B0080QOL1A,"Nice collection of films of this genre.  We like stories with classical backgrounds and period costumes and scenic locations and backdrops.  Good acting essential.  This version of Brideshead Revisited was surprisingly entertaining with the character of Sebastian so compelling, once he was out of the storyline, the viewer misses him!  For the price, this 3-in-1 is right!",1361145600,7,373,5.491228070175438
