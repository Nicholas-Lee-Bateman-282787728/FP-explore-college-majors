8538145,5,B0099PW0Q4,"This DVD has great audio/video quality of a little-seen western film.  While not exceptional, and a little slow in spots, it is very entertaining overall.  It looks great in B/W and widescreen and has an unexpected ending.  There are also some fun trailers and an excerpt from another film as extras.",1452211200,2,300,4.8431372549019605
8538146,5,B0099PW0Q4,"Generally a B script and production, fun for cult Western fans. Randy Rand's performance as ""Kid"" Ernie stands out as multi-dimensional. Rand captures the transformation from innocent teen to young adult with subtlety and finesse.",1425254400,3,230,5.6
