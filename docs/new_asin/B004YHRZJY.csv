4499432,5,B004YHRZJY,"This is a great movie for Halloween, worth watching over and over. I wanted it from the time I heard it was coming out. I was not dissapointed,I recommend everyone should check Spooky Buddies out at least once. Through in a classic 1960 Cadillac Hearse a cool version of Monster Mash during the Halloween Party and you have a great movie for any occasion.  This the best of the Buddies movies by far it has a great storyline to it! I actually wish they would make a second 1. Make some popcorn and enjoy!",1316908800,,504,4.361702127659575
4499433,1,B004YHRZJY,My husband and I reviewed this movie before allowing our children to watch it. I am glad I did. Dark magic? Ouija Boards? Demons? In a kids movie! My kids will not be watching this film.,1316908800,10,186,4.194444444444445
4499434,2,B004YHRZJY,We have all the movies in the series and this was the least favorite.  Our 4 year old was scared by several scenes.  We pre-ordered this months ago in Blu Ray.  I wish we had waited and just rented it.,1316822400,9,201,3.975
4499435,2,B004YHRZJY,"I though this movie would have more buddies in it and be funnier.  We were so happy we had it in time for my son's birthday. It's always hard to find things that are for halloween but are not too scary. We turned it off after the first 15 minutes and even that was too much. The scary looking, glowing eyed, evil dog sucking in the puppies souls as payment for a portal to the underworld in order to unleash all the underworld creatures on Fernfield?! Totally have to shelve this one for awhile.",1316822400,3,495,4.26595744680851
4499436,3,B004YHRZJY,"I am a 64-year-old ""child"" when it comes to the Buddies movies.  I own all of them and get my ""puppy fix"" every couple of weeks.  As an adult, Spooky Buddies wasn't scary as it is/could be to younger children.  My bit of disappointment is there was not enough of the Buddies.  It was more about the ""humans"".  I still enjoyed it and will watch it over and over as I do the others.  I'm looking forward to Treasure Buddies - I hope it is focused more on the Buddies than this one!  Those pups are amazing!",1316736000,4,504,4.134020618556701
4499437,5,B004YHRZJY,"Typical Buddies movie - if you've seen one, you've seen them all. Nothing of particular note about this one... but both my 9yo and 6yo LOVED it. The 9yo thinks it's the best of the Buddies movies.",1316736000,9,196,4.324324324324325
4499438,1,B004YHRZJY,"Out of all the Buddies Movies, this has been the most disappointing. We own the entire collection of Buddies Movies. We ordered this one before it was even released. My children anxiously counted down until its arrival. However, we were not even able to watch the entire movie. They were frightened by the evil ""dog spirit"" character. I think this movie could have still lived up to its ""Spooky"" title without such scary characters.",1316649600,10,432,4.851351351351352
4499439,4,B004YHRZJY,My girls age 7 and 4 did not move off the couch the whole time. Great family movie. Very cute and fun!,1316649600,7,102,3.6818181818181817
4499440,5,B004YHRZJY,"Hi. Just picked up this movie today. The cardboard sleeve has a 3-D overlay that has the dog in the middle at the top changing into a ""Spooky"" dog, really neat. There is also mention of the next movie ""Treasure Buddies"" coming out. A fun movie for the whole family.",1316476800,4,265,4.32
4499441,5,B004YHRZJY,"I can not wait to see Spooky Buddies!!! Budderball is my favorite buddy, and he looks so different! Why isn't Buddha wearing a costume? The puppies are getting so big! (especially Budderball) I really want to know when Treasure Buddies is coming out. I have been waiting and waiting for a trailer on TV. Please make a trailer on TV real soon! I would really appreciate that. Can't wait to see it!",1304467200,29,396,4.513888888888889

4499449,5,B004YHRZJY,"I'm an adult reviewing this I like this film it's great for when family  comes over for Halloween  and Grandma does not want to watch House of 1000 Corpses. It's not really scary but there  are a lot of jokes i'm not sure kids would really get, PG might be a better rating than G. And honestly  the Buddies are not in that much.",1475712000,,328,4.078125

4499466,1,B004YHRZJY,"Terrible. Too scary for the target age range and too focused on serious stuff like ""stealing souls"" and one of the main dog characters eating cute puppies. Strange and not fun.",1445904000,3,176,4.709677419354839

4499470,5,B004YHRZJY,"My son is 3 years old and the thoroughly enjoys all the ""Buddies"" movies.  Spooky Buddies is just enough ""spooky"" to thrill little ones, but NOT scare them!  It is a well thought out, well written story that will entertain and engage adults as well.  I think weens/weens would roll their eyes at the silliness, so it is much better suited to little ones.",1444176000,,354,4.5

I know it's a Halloween movie, but it still could have been a good movie without it.",1425513600,,248,4.3478260869565215

4499498,1,B004YHRZJY,"Wish I could give it zero stars. Horrible movie for kids that focuses on the spiritual and demonic; it speaks of ouija boards, spirits, zombies, contacting spirits to help you, etc. This is the first time I wish I would have previewed a movie before letting the kids sit down to watch it. It was completely inappropriate for kids. There is NO WAY this should be rated G.",1419552000,,370,4.455882352941177

4499500,1,B004YHRZJY,"Horrible movie for children.  My son loves all the other buddies movies and watches them over and over.  This one however missed the mark completely.  In the opening scene you have a sorcerer doing a spell that involves sacrificing the souls of 5 puppies in order to bring a dog back from hell.  I don't have an issue with magic or the socerer, I have an issue with the dark magic aspect of it.  Sacrificing souls to bring a demon back from hell is way too dark to me and my children will not be watching this movie.  I don't know what Disney was thinking with this one.",1417564800,,570,4.231481481481482

4499508,4,B004YHRZJY,My two year old LOVES this movie. She makes me watch it at least twice a day. I would of gave it 5 stars but I had to take one away because the movie is so much like Hocus Pocus. Starts off with a old legend than brings us back to the present where the puppies bring him back to life. There is one scene that is almost identical to Hocus Pocus my husband cam in and thought that is what I was watching.,1413072000,,402,3.7976190476190474

My son was 5 at the time and was pretty frightened - being rated G, I would have never in a million years thought it would be as creepy as it was.  If I'm being honest, I watched this movie over a year ago, and I don't really remember that much more about it - but maybe because I was too busy spending all my time trying to comfort my child to pay attention to the movie... but my vague recollection about the quality of the movie itself is that it was kind of stupid.",1406937600,,617,4.040983606557377

We didn't think anything was too frightening for our daughter, and she didn't seem to be scared by anything in the movie. Basically, I think if you're kids have not been sheltered from everything you grew up on they may not understand some of the things in the movie. I didn't see anything that was not common place in the old scooby doo episodes.",1392249600,,509,4.425531914893617

As an adult, I gave it 3 stars because it was targeted to kids, the humor was for kids and the ""scare level"" was for kids.

Once they meet Pip, a ghost of a puppy that was a victim of the Hound, the Buddies must help Pip and free his puppy siblings before Warwick and the Halloween Hound claim Fernfield as their nightmarish underworld.

I have read some of the reviews that has mentioned it's too scary for young children, but my young one loves it.  Since she liked this one so much, we have acquired the original Air Buddies and I just purchased Santa Buddies for Christmas.  It's a heart warming story with cute puppies, and really holds my 3 year old daughter's attention.  I will say, Halloween is my little girl's favorite holiday and she doesn't tend to spook easily.

4499599,3,B004YHRZJY,"The Buddies are back for another family film for 2011 titled ""Spooky Buddies"".

For those who have watched the previous ""Buddies"" films (Note: buddies are the children of Buddy the Golden Retriever, the star of the ""Air Bud"" films of the '90s), the good news for fans who enjoyed the more involving storyline with the  last year's film ""The Search for Santa Paws"", co-writer and director Robert Vince and co-writer Anna McRoberts continue with the same formula where the film is not all about the buddies but bringing back the ""Air Bud"" style of featuring the story around the human characters.

VIDEO:

""Spooky Buddies"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1) and I have to say that the film looks awesome on Blu-ray.  A lot of outdoor shots with sunlight and many costumes of various colors, it definitely lends to the vibrant colors of the film.  But also during Halloween night, the black levels are nice and deep but for the most part, detail of the costumes and the closeup of the dogs look great!

So, there is a good amount of detail this time around and I didn't detect any artifacts, combing, banding or any significant problems while watching the film. Another quality Disney presentation on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Spooky Buddies"" is a dialogue-driven film and the dialogue is crystal clear as its coming through the center and front channels.  But one will notice with this latest film is how much of the music plays a big part, especially as it is utilized in the surround channels.  A pretty solid soundtrack for this film courtesy of Brahm Wenger and also you get a pretty groovy cover of ""Monster Mash"" during the Halloween party segment of the film.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH, Spanish and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Spooky Buddies"" comes with the following special features:

  DIGS: Rosebud Edition - (4:01) Hosted by Leo Howard (of ""Kickin' It"", ""Leo Little's Big Show"", ""G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra""), canine Rosebud gives viewers a tour of where she lives, her garments and more.
  Monster Mash Music Video - (3:05) The guys of Disney show ""Shake It Up"" (Davis Cleveland, Adam Irigoyen and Kenton Duty) sing a new version of ""Monster Mash"".
  Treasure Buddies: Sneak Peek - (4:24) A sneak preview of the next Buddies film, ""Treasure Buddies"".

EXTRAS:

""Spooky Buddies: Blu-ray + DVD"" comes with a slip cover case and also comes with a DVD presented in Widescreen (1:78:1 - enhanced for 169 televisions), English, French and Spanish Dolby Digital and subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For those who love the adventures of B-Dawg, Budderball, Bhudda, Mudbud and Rosebud....the Buddies are back!  This time to save the world from an evil warlock who wants to open the portal and bringing in bad spirits to the real world.

Having reviewed the ""Air Bud"" films and also the ""Buddies"" films in the past, I like the fact that Robert Vince and Anna McRoberts are continuing on the focus on the human characters and not entirely on the Buddies.  While the previous earlier films had focused entirely on the ""Buddies"" and was targeted towards a more younger audience, with last year's ""The Search for Santa Paws"", there is more production value, a much more deeper screenplay that incorporates the characters much more, also including the Buddies as expected  and also including more music.

The same can be said about the latest film ""Spooky Buddies"". Like previous ""Buddies"" films that showcased the importance of friendship, courage and teamwork.  Those elements are still incorporated into this latest ""Buddies"" film but this time around, it's a Halloween-themed film and it's a bit darker than any of the previous ""Buddies"" films.

And it's important to note that although rated ""G"" for a general audience, for parents who are wondering if this is a film they can show to their young 3-6 year-olds, I don't know if it would be appropriate because there are some darker themes that may spook younger children.

For example, seeing a warlock sacrificing young puppies and turning them to stone, an evil warlock going after kids who are trying to runaway from him, or the warlock turning a adult friend into a zombie to the warlock scaring trick or treaters.  Especially the brooding Halloween Hound.  The dog with its green eyes and it's evil intention, that may spook some children.  For those who are used to the wholesomeness of the series, this latest film does have its darker moments that probably is more appropriate for children.

There is also a very short religious segment of the film that features the Bible and the children seeking safety in a church.  I know some people may be bothered by this.

But overall, because you expect a Halloween theme for ""Spooky Buddies"", it's what you get.  A slightly scary but fun story for the older kids, may not for the younger children.  My eight-year-old watched it with no problems.  And because he has grown up with the Buddies films, he knew it wasn't going too be scary, especially in the context of comparing it to other children's scary movies or shows like ""Goosebumps"". ""Spooky Buddies"" is rather tame.

""Spooky Buddies"" comes with a Blu-ray & DVD. Both picture quality and audio quality is well-done in HD and although there are not many special features included in this release, there is the ""Buddies"" tie-in with the kids of the hit Disney show ""Shake It Up"" and also the tie-in with Disney's ""Kickin' It"" star Leo Howard which fans may be interested in.

And similar to ""The Search for Santa Paws"", you have a few stars such as Harland Williams (""The Whole Nine Yards"", ""Dumb and Dumber""), Rance Howard (""Night Club, ""The Dilemma""), Jennifer Elise Cox (""Pretty the Series"", ""The Brady Bunch Movie""), Pat Finn (""I Love You, Beth Cooper"") and Elisa Donovan (""Clueless"").  Also, doing the voices for the film such as Diedrich Bader and Ryan Stiles (both from ""The Drew Carey Show""), Debra Jo Rupp (""That 70's Show""), Tom Conway (""SpongeBob SquarePants""), Frankie Jonas (""Jonas"") and more.

Also, enjoyed the CG for Pip the Dog and the visual effects for this Buddies film is definitely much better than the CG that was used in previous films, so I'm glad that the ""Buddies"" films have better production and continuing the character-driven storyline.

Overall, ""Spooky Buddies"" is another family fun ""Buddies"" film.  Darker and a little creepier that previous Buddies films but I did enjoy Robert Vince and Anna McRoberts experimenting with the film, especially a more darker themed film involving the Buddies but I think that (older) children who grew up with the Buddies may find this one to be a bit fun, silly, dark but enjoyable.  But for parents who have younger children, you may want to pass on this one as this film may be a bit too scary for them.",1323993600,2,6792,4.859252823631625

It was a Disney movie about puppies and I thought ""okay it's about Halloween puppies, sounds okay, it's Disney. it's gotta be cute"". Popped it in the DVD player of the car, it was on 5 minues and my 3 years old started crying and saying ""Oh, the puppies!"", then my 5 year old starts crying and saying that ""he turned the puppy into a black statue"". I quickly closed the DVD screen but the kids could still hear it, my 3 year old was screaming for me to turn it off...I felt horrible!

4499615,4,B004YHRZJY,"Okay, SPOOKY BUDDIES is not destined to be a classic family film but if you like cute dogs dressed in silly Halloween costumes, you'll find this movie enjoyable.
The plot follows an evil wizard planning to take over the world with the help of the Halloween Hound, a glowing green-eyed mastiff.  Of course, our titular heroes join forces with their human owners to stop the villains and save the world.  It's all predictably harmless hokum.  Harland Williams effectively chews up the scenery as the wacky wizard and the ubiquitous  Rance Howard (Ron & Clint's dad) brings grandpa-like charm as the gruff old man who helps our heroes.  It's also refreshing that the kids are generally polite and not smart-mouthed bratty demons.  The surf-dude Frankenstein is also pretty funny.

The very beginning of the movie when they ""trap"" the evil wizard and then again later on when he there is the final confrontation.  All of the characters are dressed up in different costumes throughout the movie and the girls did not find those moments frightening at all.  My 5 year old especially asks to watch it over and over.

The movie does little to redeem it self from there.  There is too little interaction with the Buddies, and it just seems like the writers created just enough material to make a trailer look interesting and didn't care about making a light, entertaining family movie.

4499638,3,B004YHRZJY,"Somehow I got lured into really wanting Spooky Buddies for myself (although I'm not a kid and I watched it with another adult).  Perhaps my love of dogs drew me in, but I ended up buying it.  I'm sorry to say that Spooky Buddies is basically as flat as a 2 liter of Coke left out on the table for days with no cap on.  First of all, the dialogue is just really awful.  It's as if no one knows what to say and the talking dogs in costume (that's scary enough)don't have much to bring to the table.  Worst of all is B-dog who goes around spouting tired slang throwing in a ""yo yo"" when he has nothing clever to say which is most of the movie.  The overuse of the word ""dude"" seems like a bunch of hungover people got together and wrote the script in about half an hour because they needed something to present to their bosses.  I guess the ""buddies"" are supposed to be stereotypes but they aren't funny and they don't work well - for instance you have the fat one, the brainy one, the resident girl, etc etc.  The kids don't really have that many lines and you soon forget them all together.  The basic idea of the whole movie is that in 1937, four puppies from the same bloodline have their souls taken from the Halloween Hound and a warlock bent on casting a spell to set demons upon the Earth.  They need five puppies, but Pip, the last one, gets away mid-ritual and is turned into a little, Casper-like ghost.  Modern day, the hound and the warlock are released on Halloween and seek five more puppy souls ala the buddies to complete the unfinished spell.  Most of the movie is a lacksidasical romp trying to find the buddies and take their little furry souls with Pip trying to help the buddies out when he can.  One thing I did find funny was that the warlock and the hound mistook trick-or-treaters for ""demons"" already unleashed on the Earth by some other force greater than them (as if someone had gotten to it first) - that made me chuckle.  I also enjoyed the band playing the Halloween Brew Ha Ha at the adults Halloween party.  There are some other funny little nuances such as one kid's Mom goes out and buys him a bunny costume for Halloween (is that a nod to A Christmas Story?) because she gets ""hip hop"" confused with ""hippity hoppity"".  Or the wizard who surfs on a staff rather than a witch who flies on a broom.  The Frankendude character is quite entertaining (although overplayed)but the fact that he's already kind of brainless like Frankenstein is really funny (I think the warlock? says he wish he'd turned someone smarter into his assistant).  And bascially one fart saves the day, which is cute (if you watch it you'll see what I mean).  There's a running joke that anyone born in 1937 is pretty ancient which is kind of funny (seeing that my Mom was born October of that year).  Anyway, there are some moments, but it's too bad that the script couldn't be a do over.  The talking dogs are lame and I think at some point kids might get kind of tired of this movie when the cute factor wears off.  There are definitely better kid-oriented Halloween movies that I'd watch a thousand times, but this is not one of them.  Sorry Buddies, the only thing spooky is the script.",1318377600,2,3195,4.368866328257191

Stealing puppies' souls to draw out the spirits of the netherworld??? That is just a little too dark. The other Buddies' movies had elements of peril and suspense, but they were much more age appropriate and lighthearted.

4499657,4,B004YHRZJY,"My 8 year old loved it!! It is quite similar to the Hocus Pocus movie - which is his favorite holiday movie, so he was not scared at all. I can see that little ones may get scared at first, so parents should preview if their children are skittish with ""Halloween"" type movies...but keep in mind this IS a Halloween movie! Would have liked to see more of the buddies, but overall good movie.",1316995200,,390,4.283783783783784
4499658,4,B004YHRZJY,"This is the first Buddies movie I have watched, so I can't compare it to the others. The first thing I have to say is that the puppies are adorable, the kids are charming, and the set is colorful.  The second thing is that (at the risk of sounding picky) this movie is basically a remake of the Disney movie Hocus Pocus with a few minor changes, different actors, and of course adding the puppies.  Hocus Pocus has always been one of my very favorite holiday movies, but I am genuinely shocked that Disney produced this Buddies movie with basically the EXACT same story line.  Were they short on writers or short on creativity?  If you have seen Hocus Pocus, you will be amazed at the similarities.

The story opens in a big old house in the past, just 75 years ago vs. 300 years, and sets up the whole story for present day Halloween in a small town.  Instead of three witches who are brought back to life by a candle, it's a warlock brought back to life by a mirror.  Instead of sucking the life out of children, the warlock needs the souls of 5 puppies (not as scary as it sounds).  People are turned into little talking animals, just like Hocus Pocus, and the warlock wanders the streets filled with trick-or-treaters searching for his stolen spell book (sound familiar).  All of the town's clueless parents are at the town Halloween dance and don't believe the children when they come looking for help.  Seriously, I think they must have used the same script and just replaced the teenaged children with this younger group (more akin to the Goonies clan) and the Buddies.  The children seem to be the main characters is this movie, with the Buddies as an aside.  I really expected this movie to be more centered around the puppies.

Okay, now that I have complained enough about the fact that Disney took a major shortcut by copying Hocus Pocus, I have to say I am at least glad that they copied a GOOD movie and that it was their OWN movie that they copied, not somebody elses.  I also have to wonder if it's possible that they did this intentionally because the story from Hocus Pocus was so successful and felt that it was worth redoing for a slightly younger set.  Guess I can't blame them for that.  Don't get me wrong, this movie can't compare to Hocus Pocus which had an all-star cast and was overflowing with humor.  Spooky Buddies is obviously intended to give us an opportunity to watch some adorable little puppies in cute costumes outwit the bad guys with the help of some equally adorable kids.  They were successful in doing just that.  The opening of the movie is the scariest if you are concerned about your little ones, but the rest of the story lightens up and of course has a happy ending.

So why did I buy this movie?  I have grandchildren who have several of the other movies and loved them and were eager to see this one as well.  I like to have movies for all the holidays on hand for sleepovers, so I bought this one for Halloween. They haven't seen it yet, but I'm pretty sure they will enjoy it for a number of reasons. First, the children in the movie are their age and that is always a big plus when it comes to whether or not they can connect with the characters. Second, the movie is just scary enough to make it fun (after all, it is Halloween) but not scary enough to give them nightmares.  It may be a little spooky for really small children.  And third, everyone loves adorable puppies. I will try to do a follow up with ""reviews"" from my grandchildren after they see it.",1316995200,25,3511,4.4077519379844965
4499659,4,B004YHRZJY,"I was wondering how long it would take for the Buddies to have a Halloween-themed movie. We thought it was cute, the kids liked it. There is a ""dark magic"" theme to it, but what do you expect with a Halloween movie? We own Snow Buddies, Space Buddies, and Santa Buddies; I do think we see less of the Buddies in Spooky Buddies, but it's still entertaining for the kids. If you like these kinds of not-so-scary movies for your kids with a Halloween theme, then Spooky Buddies is a good choice.",1316908800,,492,4.358695652173913
