That said, this is a solid group...a great group, focused on the music.  Tons of creativity from each and every member.  Piano, bass and drums so compliment each other to make one of the tightest rythem sections you'll ever see.

Sax and trumpet players are stunning.  Unison playing is composed as an integral part of the music not just an intro to improvisation. Beautiful. When is the last time you saw that?  Quality of horn's sound at all times is varied and very good.

A GREAT group.  Don't miss this one, now that you've tripped over it.",1318291200,3,688,4.573770491803279
