7903325,3,B000004BBB,"Julia Timmons (Lisa Welti) is a stunning redhead who is almost raped in the opening scene. Soon thereafter her lovers seem to die or disappear. Meanwhile the police are trying to put together the puzzle while a psychologist blocks them whenever he can. Oh, she also has daddy issues and for some reason they opted to put a strip club in the film, most likely because the acting, dialogue, and plot couldn't carry the film alone.

The film was weak on character, except for maybe the guy in the mask. As a mystery/thriller it was not entertaining. I kept waiting for the next scene where Julia would doff her clothes and when it became apparent it wasn't going to happen again, I really got bored. If you have a redhead fetish that would be the only reason to watch it.

F-bomb, sex, attempted rape, nudity (Lisa Welti, Joyce Westergaard, Bonnie Stauch)",1414886400,2,852,4.635761589403973
