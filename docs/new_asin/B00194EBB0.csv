8271847,3,B00194EBB0,"OK Mexican-Columbian co-production Spanish language (no dubbing or subtitles) Santo adventure from the early 70's.  Filmed on location in several countries, including Mexico, Columbia, Spain, Venezuela, Panama, and Puerto Rico.  They wasted all their efforts on travel that they had no more energy to make a good movie.  This time Santo is on the trail of jewel thieves that have stolen, surprise, jewels.  Not the greatest Santo film (he's better when he's fighting monsters), but an OK time passer.  The DVD is good quality.  Recommended for Santo fans.",1426982400,,555,5.25
