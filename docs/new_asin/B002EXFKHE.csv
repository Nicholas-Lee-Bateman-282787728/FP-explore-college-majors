3920551,4,B002EXFKHE,"First, make sure you are purchasing a DVD of this film that WILL play in the USA. The copy I saw was one of four films on a DVD called ""Spiritual Cinema."" While there is not much that screams ""spiritual"" about the movie, I suppose the packager used the term to reflect that the chief character, Lola Murphy, takes many risks to pursue her dream of becoming a famous dancer. Unable to snag a show job in New York, she ends up in Cairo, rather unbelievably, and even more far-fetched, she persuades a formerly famous belly dancer who had to retire in disgrace to take her on as a student. Of course, she succeeds eventually, and the teacher, whose heart is broken, comes back to life a little because Lola's enthusiasm is contagious. Would a lovely young blonde American dancer who has no burqua  actually survive walking the streets of Cairo these days? Well, just don't analyze this plot too closely. Rather, sit back and let the girl, and her friends, and her dilemmas slowly force you to root for their happiness. It's a feel-good film, but in ways that are not always expected.",1323388800,,1080,4.56701030927835
3920552,4,B002EXFKHE,"If you can suspend~ cultural realities, dedicated years to learn belly dancing, and know there isn't a fairy Godfather to make you famous, then you will truly enjoy this movie.  Cheeky and well scripted. I enjoyed it.",1303084800,,217,4.864864864864865
3920553,4,B002EXFKHE,"When I received the DVD in the post I wanted to watch it straight away but thought my husband would start moaning when he came into the room.  He actually watched the film with me, didn't complain and said it was enjoyable - for that reason alone it should get a 10!
There is a good story line, great music, good acting and the dancing was not to bad either.  I loved the part where Lola is dancing in the ""seedy"" Cairo night club, - very authentic.
This film is a must see for any Bellydance Enthusiast.

The struggle to be ourselves in a world full of judgment.  Well written and portraied.",1515110400,,248,4.767441860465116

8368437,4,B002EXFKHE,"I liked the Heroine, Lola, for the most part.  There were a couple eye rolling moments, but overall it was a great movie to watch on a night in.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in a little bellydancing.",1468713600,,213,4.3

8368441,4,B002EXFKHE,I love belly dance and Morocco which is why I rented this movie. It was better than I expected and the dance scenes were fabulous. I only gave it 4 stars because I would have preferred more dance and less fluff. The movie gets really good after Lola gets to Egypt. I'll most likely buy this movie.,1395360000,,297,4.228070175438597
8368442,4,B002EXFKHE,"I thought that the acting and the script were wonderful! I work as a musician in this industry and I can attest that the story line seems quite familiar. The belly dancing may not have been professional standards, but it's a movie, not a belly dance performance video. I was very touched by the genuine and accurate humanity in the movie. The movie makers and the actors made me ""feel it.""",1394064000,,389,4.492957746478873
8368443,3,B002EXFKHE,"It was the 4th of July and I was browsing Youtube for a jazz singer named Tierney Sutton.  After hearing the infectious beat in her take on the classic ""Whatever Lola Wants"", I listened to other versions of it and eventually found a link to a movie I was unfamiliar with of the same title.

The reviews I've read weren't particularly complimentary of the movie.  Complaints about the inaccuracies related to the depiction of Egyptian culture and her people, as well as the standards of dancing were a common theme in the comments about the film.  Despite that, I decided I was going to squander my morning with a meaningless flick about a young woman chasing her romantic interest and her dream - and then hate myself for doing something so idiotic afterwards.

So the movie starts like a terrible Hollywood romance from the 80s.  Aspiring, mediocre dancer works as a mail woman, delivers mail to a good looking Egyptian tenant and screws his brains out for weeks.  When she gives up an opportunity to go permanent with USPS, he gets upset and leaves the country.  She tracks him down in Egypt, meets his uppity affluent family and endures a second ditching after some sex of course (sorry it is pretty much PG when it came to fornication so use your imagination).

In her emotional stupor, she turns to dancing bars to pay the rent while seeking out a former disgraced dancing star, Ismahan, for guidance.  Through enough perseverance and luck, she befriends the manservant and Ismahan's daughter and eventually secures the precious lessons.  This is when the entire viewing experience takes on a completely different tenor.

I was drawn into a teacher/student drama that was endearing.  In short, the student who had come seeking a new life ended up changing the teacher's.  There is always something intimate and moving about taking another human being under your wing, guiding them, correcting them, fighting them, and then watching them shine.  When you impart a difficult skill to someone, you share with them a part of your life and that part of your life lives on through them.

If you can endure the cheesy beginning of the movie, the rest of the movie will reward you.  It has a Cinderella ending but hey, sometimes we do need to feel good about life and have hope in humanity.  Some of us are fortunate enough to have great teachers and others blessed to have students who teach.",1385424000,2,2390,4.745762711864407
