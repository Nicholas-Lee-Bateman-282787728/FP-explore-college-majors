8074039,3,B000A3ORJM,"The movie was a lot better after listening to a theatre critic review it. I definitely needed him to make sense of the ending.
I didn't realize that it had subtitles, my fault. Also the sound and quality of the movie left alot to be desired. It could haave been a bad copy.
I learned my lesson to play closer attention to the description, it was VHS. also :c",1265414400,,358,4.202898550724638
8074040,5,B000A3ORJM,"This is a very introspective movie that focuses on the lingering effects of the Holocaust, seen through lives or ordinary people. The movie tells three separate stories of people impacted by the Holocaust.  They are all some 50 years removed from the horrific events of WWII, yet the effect Holocaust had on their lives impacts them every day.  The movie is in French, Russian, Hebrew, Yiddish and Polish with English subtitles.

Rivka and her husband, a Jewish couple from France are on a group trip visiting Auschwitz to see where their loved ones perished.  Rivka cannot seem to stop thinking of her family who perished there and how lucky she was to escape that fate.  Her husband, though Jewish himself is not so thrilled to be there.  He perceived this visit as something that prolongs Rivka's agony.  She's been dwelling on the past which has been causing a rift in their marriage.

The second woman just arrived to Israel from the former Soviet Union with her neighbors. Her travails did not end with the end of WWII in 1945.  Living in the Soviet Union, her family experienced further trials.  She's been a lonely widow for over 20 years and anxiously awaited the opportunity to immigrate to Israel.  Finally, after the collapse of USSR in 1991 the doors have opened for her.  So she joined her neighbor's family and traveled with them to Israel.  Yet the long awaited arrival has a bitter-sweet taste.  While she's glad to be ""home"" in the holy land she can sense that she's being a burden to the neighbor's wife she arrived with.  But the husband is trying to find a job and make sure she has a place with them.  She in turns assures them that she'll find her relative and move in with her.  When she does find her relative and visits her in a hospice care she's very disappointed.  Her relative shows no interest in her except for saying hello, which only add to her already mounting disappointment.  Finally, she discovers to her surprise, that no one can speak Yiddish and since she can't speak Hebrew she's unable to communicate with anyone.  She proclaims ""it appears that there are no more Jews in the Holy Land, they are all Israelis...."" This further adds to her loneliness and frustration.  Her life-long hope of escaping the memories of the Holocaust and moving into the promised land did not quite turn out what she thought it might be.

The final story is of a woman living in Israel originally from France.  When she was a young child, she and her siblings were separated from their parents and shipped to Palestine.  She never saw her parents again not knowing what happened to them, whether they survived or perished in the Holocaust.  She's been searching for her family all her life.  One day she receives a phone call from a man living in France claiming to be her father.  They have the same last name, he had a daughter of the same name as her, and both came from the same part of Paris.  The man is in his 80's and comes to Israel to visit her.  After getting acquainted, she finds out that they are not related.  However she invites him to stay if he'd like, knowing too well the pain of losing someone and being alone.

All three stories tell the tale of suffering, not so much of physical suffering such as torture, but the emotional impact the Holocaust had on them.  This is a tale of a generation that lived through many challenges and happy times were few and far between.  Even when times got better, they were unable to truly enjoy themselves being too scarred by the memories, emotional trauma and other marks left by the Holocaust.",1261612800,6,3574,4.595576619273301
8074041,5,B000A3ORJM,"In my opinion, one of the most thoughtful and interesting depictions of the holocaust to come out in the last 20 years. I've thought about this film since I saw it at a Jewish film festival in Minneapolis and decided I needed to own a copy so I could see it again and again. Set in Paris, Poland and Israel, the film evokes both the intellect and strong emotions. A wonderful film.",1253577600,,381,4.305555555555555
