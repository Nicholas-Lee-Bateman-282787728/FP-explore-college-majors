8126053,4,B000FS9OKE,"`Through Hell and High Water' is the documentary following Ben Fogle and James Cracknell as they row the Atlantic ocean in the Woodvale Atlantic Race. The first half of the documentary looks at their preparations (or lack of!), race planning and training and the second half focuses on the race itself. You see how they are slowly broken down by the conditions and extreme nature of the race and live the highs and lows with them as they battle their way to Antigua. This has everything, from bureaucratic wrangling to get everything ready in time, extreme physical, mental and emotional fatigue, equipment failure and even a capsize and by the end of the documentary to have a clearer idea of the magnitude of the challenge. Having just read the book I was aware of the details of the journey, but seeing it on screen made it al the more powerful and impressive. The extras are rather basic on this DVD, but you do get some of the diary camera footage which makes for a `warts an' all' take on the race. The scene where James reads a letter from his wife is especially heart breaking, particularly after seeing him so driven and ruthlessly focused throughout the race. This is an inspiring documentary of an incredible achievement and it truly left me in awe and it's great if you like adventure/survival themes.
