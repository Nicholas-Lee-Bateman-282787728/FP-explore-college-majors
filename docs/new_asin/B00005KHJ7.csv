 The second part introduces us to the mysterious young man seen in part one 'sleeping' in that glass container which Getter 3 was guarding as well as a hot head american pilot who operates a transforming jet fighter robot.

 After defeating the wounded pilot and returning Kei's 'father' to the floating base, so he can recover from his wounds. The mysterious young man choses Kei and a green recruit to pilot the new and improved Getter Robot ships.
 The new Getter Team goes thru several transformations of all three getter robo forms in battling the alien invaders, while defending the floating base and guarding the mutated Getter Dragon.
 During a lull in the battle we learn the origin of Kei and see the return of the Professer who was killed in part one.

 If you like action and a little humor mixed into the story then part 2 of Getter Robo: Armageddon it will make a good addition to your collection.",1017964800,,1070,4.6

Well, if you can recall, Nagai soon put all these tamed titles on the hot-seat by redoing it in a more realistic, but still synically humorous, setting. And now it's Getter Robo's turn. Look out Big O and Evangelion. This is one mecha series that kicks metal bot and takes names.
Nagai's plan for this series was simple. Take average early-days super robots (you know, the kind that you would see on Voltron) and turn it into a show that actually makes sense of the giant robots. Go's past projects were easy shows. For Cutey Honey he added nudity and for Devilman he added realistic devils. Even when Nagai's beefs up Getter Robo it really doesn't seem that different from the original television series. However, there are some parts that stray away from common mecha shows. You wouldn't see a guy drooling from his mouth weilding a gun out for revenge now would you?
The story takes off when the underground Japanese government spies (Go, Kei, Benkei, Yoshida, Dairoku, Gai) ends up helping the old Getter pilot Hayato, who is now the commander of the robot army in the Tower, fight against the newly awakened Shin Dragon. But the new Getter team now composed of Go, Kei and Gai, are not respected for their efforts. The other members of the robot army start getting racial and actually getting into a fight with the Getter team. But later on they realize how vital Shin Getter Robo is to defeating Shin Dragon. While Benkei recovers from an Invader wound he got earlier, Doctor Saotome makes his new entrance onto the scenes. And he announces that Kei, or Genki, is Saotome's daughter. This causes a flood of secrets to be released about Saotome and people who were involved with him. Even though Ryoma is the main star, trust me he isn't dead, Go becomes the main hero for this volume by actually being sucked into Shin Dragon with Kei and having a sweet moment of reflection.
Then theres the action. Sweet sweet sweet action! If you crave mecha action that your mind cant possibly conceive, you must see Getter Robo. The action, since there isn't a whole lot of detail on the robots, moves so fast and furious, you'll have to put it in slow motion just to figure out what just happened. I love this new concept that Go Nagai has developed with Getter Robo. There are still some points in here that refer back to old-school mecha. One of the most obvious points is the fact that Shin Getter Robo can transform into two different Getters. While they do show how Getter Two is transformed, his arms are just appear out of nowhere leaving you to figure out how this works. Once more, the whole Invader concept is very old-school, but it gives a good excuse for the action.
The DVD extras here are pretty nice. The four interviews with English voice actors were pretty fun and Im looking forward to more of them. The production sketches are very pleasent to look at, but people who haven't seen the first volume of Getter Robo, very crucial I might add, will be looking at the picture of Getter Three and say ""what the heck is that thing?"". The textless opening and closings are a bit repeditive, but worth watching just to see the original Kanji title.
Overall, Go Nagai has taught me that anything is possible from animation. I support Nagai for his never ending struggle to make animation that is a feat for anime fans and non-anime fan's eyes to feast upon. Highly recommended.",1008892800,4,3474,4.604838709677419
7943362,4,B00005KHJ7,"A little late on this one but since nobody else isn't commenting I sure will. People this anime is what I invision anime as straight up hardcore sci-fi action with a good story. The series continues seemlessly where episode 4 ended and if you think the action is going to reach a slowdown you are sorely mistaken my friend. This anime kicks butt in everyway in the action department and as far as a story, though a bit confusing at times, this one is not a ""leave your brain at the door"" kind of series. To this point it is a fine example that hardcore action can blend well with a complex story. Again like my other post stated from Vol. 1 if your an old school robot fan and want to see them in maximum carnage do not hesitate to check this series out. It is in my opinion more entertaining than most of the other so called great anime series out right now. Definitely not for kids (which I love) due to alot of the content and something us ""older"" anime fans will appreciate since almost everything currently coming out is getting more and more ""kiddiefied"". Do check this series out PLEASE!!! This series to me screams the words CULT CLASSIC all the way!!! Now I just have to be patient enough to wait for Vol. 3! Get the word out to every anime fan on this one they'll thank you for it!!",1003104000,,1292,4.277551020408163
