  I now have the complete series of ""Watching"" and if you like Good English comedy, I suggest the complete series, I just think it's So great to watch and there is many laughs in them, if you feel down in the dumps, he he, regards Jack.
P-S  There is 7 Series (Watching)  I wish there was more, because I could watch these forever and enjoy them every time I watch them. (Most DVD Players will play them, provided you have Multi Zone Players) The reason I got this one (again) because I loaned it to someone, and never had it returned. Whoever it was, I'm sure will get the rest of the series.",1297555200,,622,4.245762711864407
