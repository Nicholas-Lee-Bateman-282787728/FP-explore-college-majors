6123045,5,B00GX00CVS,"Finding quality entertainment on television for children that doesn't contain rude or inappropriate behavior is difficult in today's society. We try to limit our children's exposure to unwholesome media, but the world is so saturated with it that it can be frustrating. That's why when we find something that they enjoy, that isn't full of drivel, and that is edifying to boot, we are elated.

We recently became acquainted with a wise dove named Iesodo (""yay-sa-doe"") through a Christian family cartoon series with the same name.  Iesodo lives on the shores of the Sea of Galilee and he is the voice of reason and faith amongst the birds who live there with him.

Why such an unusual name for a bird?  The name means, ""The way of Jesus.""  You see, this little dove is a representation of the Lord.  In this second episode of the series, LOVE, you will see two Scripture based stories that teach biblical principles.

In the first story, ""Birds of a Feather, Fish Together,"" you will meet two pelican brothers, Jack and Jacob(based on the disciples James and John), who are arguing over who is the best fisherman.  This disagreement will effect more than their relationship because it is preventing them from catching the fish needed to feed the guests at a the wedding of Fiona and Freddy Finch. Finally Iesodo comes and teaches them the benefit of working together.

In the next tale, ""Love Your Enemies,"" you'll meet Zack the tax collector who is considered to be like ""the dirty tail feathers of the bird world"" because he taxes double or triple what he is entitled to take out of greed. He has no friends and his world revolves around money.  One day, Iesodo visits him and informs him that he and his friends will have dinner in his sycamore tree. After the kindness, Zack shares all of his food and realizes that friendship is a wonderful thing and sharing is richer than taking.

Aside from great Bible based stories, the DVD contains beautiful and vibrant animations, fun characters, and songs that will get caught in your head for days.  My children greatly enjoyed the movie and have asked to watch it again repeatedly. I love that they are being taught about how Jesus wants Christians to lead their lives.

Special features are also included and have explanations of how bible stories about Jesus relate to the episodes, a peek into the making of the songs, the Scripture verse references that the stories are based upon, and more.

To extend your Iesodo themed fun, the website has fun activities, family discussion guides, music videos, coloring pages, and more for you to use with your children.  My children adored the printable masks that were available.  They've been wearing them around the house, flapping their arms like wings, and quoting lines from the movie.

If you are looking for fun and wholesome entertainment for your children, then you should definitely check out Iesodo!",1393372800,,2903,4.820564516129032
6123046,5,B00GX00CVS,"Having grandkids we like to give them a good Bible base teaching and this DVD is one of the best method for kids to learn, is fun and they love it. I recommend this DVD to any parent or Grandparents with interest on the kids Christian development.",1407110400,,247,4.276595744680851
6123047,5,B00GX00CVS,Excellent!! Kids learn in a variety of ways- Iesodo teaches in the truths of the Gospel of Christ.  Proud to support!,1407110400,,117,4.571428571428571
6123048,1,B00GX00CVS,"This series is very misleading. In this particular episode it tells everyone to ""follow their own heart"". This is a contradiction to what the Bible teaches, and should be dually noted.",1401753600,4,184,4.967741935483871
6123049,5,B00GX00CVS,Wonderful way for children to hear the gospel in an age appropriate story also fun to watch the video with them,1399248000,,111,4.333333333333333
6123050,5,B00GX00CVS,"My kids were impressed with Iesodo altogether.  This disc was great too.  The messages are good Bible messages/stories that my kids (10 and 7 year olds) are able to relate to easily.  I was impressed with the music.  The songs made a quick impact on my kids, they were singing along with the songs quickly.  Loved it.",1399248000,2,317,4.491228070175438
6123051,3,B00GX00CVS,"There are 2 episodes on each dvd. Both are short enough for young children to be able to pay attention and brightly colored birds who portray the characters are fun to watch. Music also is a vital role in keeping most kids entertained, and they are sure to enjoy the lively tunes included in the episodes and the theme song.

Birds of a Feather, Fish Together  The wedding celebration of Freddie and Fiona Finch is headed for disaster! Iesodo steps in to calm everyones ruffled feathers and make the event a success.
Scripture used - Luke 5:1-11, John 2:1-11, John 21:1-11

My review: Although it is weaving 3 different stories together, they do all tie in to the theme of working together and provision. There are several ways to get a lesson to the kids and the songs and images will help them remember. The sibling rivalry between the Pelican Brothers was my favorite part. Good job of tying in both a lesson you want the kids to learn, plus Biblical stories that can be expanded upon to share your faith.

Love Your Enemies  Zack, the tax collector, doesnt play by the rules. Iesodo shows the flock that treating those who are mean to us with kindness really does make a big difference.
Scripture used - Luke 19:1-10, John 8:1-11

My review: This time there are 2 stories within the episode that deals with treating others with kindness and forgiveness. Zach the tax collector is taking unfair advantage through his position and his portion is even greater than the government requires. Through Iesedo, he learns that this is wrong and he repays all he is stolen. The flock learns about forgiveness.

The sub-story is the story of the adulterous woman (and it is presented in a kid-friendly method). At first I thought I would like the way this lesson was going to be turned into one of forgiveness, but then..........
STOP!! Major Problem!!

 Iesodo: ""Are you sorry for what you did?""

Angelina Blackbird: ""Mmm-hmm. I was wrong and I deserve to be punished. But I am so very, very, very sorry.""

Iesodo: ""Honestly saying you are sorry means a lot. Go back to your flock and follow your heart to do what is right from now on.""

""Follow your heart to do what is right""??!!?? Maybe it's just the people I know, but when I questioned several, they all said the first thing that had also popped into my mind: ""The human heart is the most deceitful of all things, and desperately wicked. Who really knows how bad it is?"" - Jeremiah 17:9 (FYI: We all did not use the same translation, but we all said the same verse.) There are also numerous Scriptures about man doing what is right in his own eyes---and none of those are an encouragement to do so.

I know this series is meant for younger children, but most pre-schoolers I know do not automatically do what is right when they follow their heart. I would be okay with ""...and do not take what is not yours from now on"" or a variation, but I would not want the current message to be one a child hears. They are going to have a large enough struggle with others telling them the distorted message as they grow older.

So, great for animation, music for kids, and a great website. I also like the Special Features section that gives additional info on Bible verses, the stories, the lessons, and the music. The first story is good, but I would proceed with caution on the second. I realize it is just the wording and not the message that is intended...but it still bothers me. So, except for one line, this is a video I would recommend. However, that one line is a stumbling block for me. On the other hand, I could use it to teach a lesson or two also.

Disclosure: I received this dvd compliments of Word Films and Edify Media for my honest review. All opinions are my own.",1397692800,4,3722,4.501483679525222
6123052,5,B00GX00CVS,It is exciting to see how they tell stories of the Bible using birds.  The biblical accounts were depicted well enough that you understand what Scripture they are referring to.  This is a good way to get your children interested in the Holy Scriptures.  You can read the accounts in the Bible with your children after you watch the episodes.,1397606400,,341,4.65
6123053,5,B00GX00CVS,"IESODO or 'The Way Of Jesus' in Japanese is the latest video series based on the most influential figure of our times: Jesus and as you guessed, the most enduring best seller of the last 2000 years: The Bible.

IESODO is a kind and wise white Dove who lives in the Holy Land in a beautiful Cypress tree located on the shores of a vast lake (known to us as the Sea of Galilee).

As leader of his flock, he spreads a message of love and kindness wherever he goes. His lovable bird friends are very different from one another but there is a common point amongst them: Since they have met the Teacher, their lives have changed forever.

Folks, this is a splendid opportunity for any family to teach positive values to little ones of course and you will not want to miss it!

Director Jared Hankins stated:

""People of faith will be reminded and appreciate the reflection of Jesus. People who are not of Faith will appreciate the values, good teaching and entertainment. There truly is something for everyone and for all ages.""

Each episode is based on well known parables, as noted in the special features and displays a keen understanding on how to witness in His name even for the littlest one amongst us!

Included with bibles references, are sing a longs certain to have everyone singing and clapping in tune and fun and games to involve the whole family!

6123054,5,B00GX00CVS,"I received two DVDs in the Iesodo series {Yay-So-Doe}. Iesodo means the way of Jesus. It is mainly for children and it is a teaching DVD about different things in the Bible. The two DVDs I received are called Love and Faith.
  Iesodo is a wise dove and he has many bird followers. In these DVDs Iesodo represents Jesus and the other birds the disciples. there are also birds to represent the evil rulers and even the devil. This format is very entertaining and easy to understand even for the very young.
Each DVD has two excellent stories from the Bible that will teach your child while they are really enjoying them.
  The DVDs are high quality and the birds and scenes are very colorful and fun. Each story has songs included that are very catchy and full of meaning.
  I love them all, but my favorite is The Wind and the Rain in the Faith DVD.
  This is a 5-star DVD and I highly recommend them. Collect all for your children/grandchildren/friends or church.

6123055,5,B00GX00CVS,"Not since Veggie Tales has there been a great series for parents to provide visual entertainment for their children with great lessons to encourage further communication with your kids. Now there is, with Iesodo, pronounced Yay-Sa-Doe, meaning The Way of Jesus, which is a white dove in the bird world that represent the persona of Jesus. As this series begins, we are introduced to the family of birds that reside in a place called Cypress World on the Sea of Gailee that share two episode in each DVD filled with amazing and beautiful animation and music geared just for your kids.

I was invited to review Iesodo: Love where you introduced to Birds of a Feather, Fish Together. Jacob and Jack, pelican brothers, seem to have nothing in common besides their ability to argue. It seems that the fish they have been tasked to gather for the Finches wedding will go unfulfilled unless they can find a way to work together instead of constantly remaining competitive. But it will take the wisdom of Iesodo to teach them that they can be more successful if they can put their differences aside and help the Finches by providing an abundant source of fish for their wedding.

In the next episode, Love Your Enemies, teaches your children what it is like when people are treated with kindness over being treated with greed. When the birds have to provide taxes to Zacheus, the Tax Collector, they find that no matter how much they provide, he still wants more. It shows what happens when selfishness takes over someone's life and of course, Iesodo comes along to show him how far a little kindness goes instead.

I received Iesodo: Love DVD compliments of Zaya Toonz, Rollman Entertainment, Capital Christian Distribution and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. This is such a brilliant series that you will want to make sure you collect all three, Love, Faith and Believe in the series. Directors for the series include Brian E. Ray whose credits consist of Muppet Babies, My Little Pony Tales and Ed, Ed, and Eddy, as well as Colin Brady, whose credits include Toy Story, Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life. Brady also served as the former animation supervisor for Pixar Animation Studios. Producer Eric S. Rollman, President/CEO of Rollman Entertainment, formerly served as President of Production for Fox Kids and Marvel, and writer/producer Rob Loos is an Emmy Nominee and writer/producer for McGee and Me! Christmas Lamb, Kids 10 Commandments and Touched by an Angel. The Iesodo series also features the voice of Erin Bethea (Fireproof, Amazing Love) as Maggie. So as you can see this is a collaborative effort utilizing some of the best talents to bring you something wonderful for teaching your child biblical concepts that they will LOVE. I easily give this series a 5 out of 5 stars. My only complaint is that I wish this was available when I was growing up! Run time is about 55 minutes and contains some great bonus features like Bible verses, music videos and much more.",1394928000,2,2974,4.7933723196881095
