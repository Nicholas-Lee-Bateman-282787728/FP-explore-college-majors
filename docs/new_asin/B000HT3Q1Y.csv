2643154,5,B000HT3Q1Y,"Great, the last two seasons of Columbo finally featured in one
pack,after this Columbo took a break and came back in the late
80's with that guillotine episode I think. Well, the highlights
from these two seasons are ""Try and catch me"" with the great
actress Ruth Gordon, ""Murder under glass"" with Louis Jordan,
this is one of my favorite episodes that involves Italian
Restaurants,exotic fish and a attempt to poison Lt Columbo. ""How
to dial murder"" features a very young Kim Cattrall in an episode
where a couple of trained dogs kill a family friend of a Doctor
that discover a past affair with his wife and the victim.""The
Conspirators"" is a classic and closes the seventh season, this
one features an Irish caracter that is involved in suppling guns
to the Irish war. I still feel that there are some good extras
that might have been included, I also dream with a documentary
on Peter Falk talking progresively on the episodes, the unsusal
things that he perceived, working with Spielberg in the
beggining and with so many great actors and actresses, who knows
if this personal wish will see the light of day.",1156809600,42,1113,4.712820512820513
2643155,5,B000HT3Q1Y,"This is a bittersweet DVD.  I am so happy that I will have all of these wonderful shows, but sad because there won't be any more to look forward to.

The brilliant Ruth Gordon is the guest star on Try And Catch Me, notice how she takes Columbo's line of ""just one more thing.""

To sum up, just get this, sit back and enjoy!",1156377600,20,323,4.015625

2643169,5,B000HT3Q1Y,"I've so enjoyed going back through this entire series. Columbo stood head and shoulders above all the other piddling detective shows in the 1970s. He was self-effacing to a fault, and in his rumpled, klutzy way, be a person we could all identify with, yet he was also wickedly smart! And the guest-star murderers he was charged with unraveling...Leonard Nimoy, Robert Culp, Dick Van Dyke, Jackie Cooper...  There's even a bit part filled by Jamie Lee Curtis when she was what...13? Weird to think that so many of Peter Falk's foils are no longer with us.

So here's the thing. If you only have time to sample a couple of Columbo's, consider none other than these--the best of the best... ""Any Old Port in a Storm"" and ""By Dawn's Early Light."" You'll love them! Just one more thing...  Craig Bennett Hallenstein, Author of ""The Dolphin""",1457568000,,835,4.744827586206896

2643176,5,B000HT3Q1Y,"Who doesn't love Columbo? That said what I DON""tT love about Columbo is the frequency he brough his questionably talented wife SHERA DANESE with a voice worse than the most brittle sandpaper on to star as one of the females in far too many of the shows...one would ahve been enough. Unfortunately there were a lot more than that. If we could DELETE her and CGI someone else in her place this would eb the pERFECT series.",1433721600,,420,4.467532467532467

We bought the DVD so that we could retire the Betamax copy we had for all these decades in an attempt to add to the longevity of the Sony SuperBetaMax player/recorder which is still functioning. Our favorites on this DVD are the ""Murder under Glass"" episode with Louis Jordan and ""Try to Catch Me"" with Ruth Gordon.",1428796800,,360,4.46969696969697

Each cast mate the tone of these spectacle seasons are truly a work of art. Mr. Falk,thanks for making your trench rain coat and your charsmia something all columbo fans can enjoy for a lifetime!

2643249,5,B000HT3Q1Y,"Columbo is a great series that lives on to this day!  I've seen some episodes upwards of two dozen times since the 1970's, others 10-20 times.  I just love it.  Unfortunately for us fans, Peter Falk didn't want to do as many episodes as we or the Network would have liked!  Season six consists of only three episodes, and season seven has five, for a total of only eight.  I do appreciate the original series for many reasons.  The guest stars for one, is top notch.  The directing is always good.  The writing, sometime missed the mark a bit, but the episodes were always entertaining as we observed Columbo slowly undoing the criminals alibi!  The subsequent movies weren't always as good, with some exceptions, as far as the writing and story lines went, which I why I much favor the original series over them.  If you love Columbo, you must complete your set with the final two great seasons, with episodes such as ""Fade into Murder"", ""The Bye-Bye Sky High IQ Murder Case"", ""Murder Under Glass"", and probably one of the best, ""Try and Catch Me"" starring the late great actress Ruth Gordon as probably one of the most sympathetic murderers in the history of TV!",1398729600,,1164,4.606796116504855
2643250,5,B000HT3Q1Y,"I do enjoy a great suspense/mystery with a bit of sarcasm via Columbo, and this set of DVDs hits the mark. I do wish they had creative series like this on free TV these days, but I will have to satisfy my present interests with classics from the past.",1397952000,,251,4.142857142857143
2643251,5,B000HT3Q1Y,"The convenience of AMAZON is that it allows one to place items on a ""wish list"" and order them at a later time.  I simply ""wished"" the entire Columbo series (and other DVD's) then did the ""One-Click"" to order them when I was ready. And, the sub-vendors will usually have items that are temporarily out-of-stock (or same quality with a slightly lower price.)  I get all my DVDs through AMAZON. There's no hassle and everything arrives when it's supposed to.",1397779200,,456,4.6875
2643252,5,B000HT3Q1Y,"These eight episodes have some good, and not so good plots, but they all have Peter Falk at what I consider the top of his game and that's better than 99% of the programming on TV today. And that's a run on sentence!",1397433600,,216,4.046511627906977

2643263,5,B000HT3Q1Y,"It's funny. I liked a few of these shows on TV, but since I bought these DVDs, I've fallen in love with Columbo. I have watched some of them over and over.

One thing I didn't care for, however, is that some of these series were duplicated during other seasons. I prefer new and exciting. If I want to watch it over again, I really don't expect to do so via a new series. In a new series,I'm expecting to see something different.

I think it would be best if the customer were advised where there's a duplicate series so they can decide whether or not they still want to purchase it. I know if I had known ""before"" the purchase, I would simply have chosen another series. Knowing this information in advance, is ""not"" going to prohibit me from purchasing other series in this collection.",1390348800,,787,4.383561643835616

I like that we know who did it from the very start. And Columbo always gets his man. I like that people misjudge Columbo, and take him for an idiot.

For those of you who are not familiar with Columbo, he is a great detective with unusual mannerisms--the forerunner of Monk.  The episodes have great guest stars such as William Shatner, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kim Cattrall, and Ed Begley, Jr.",1337040000,,575,7.098591549295775
2643285,5,B000HT3Q1Y,"I have been getting reacquainted with Columbo in the last few months and this DVD collection was a big part of that. In this series we see Columbo catch an Irish terrorist, a would-be TV executive, an elderly mystery writer and a host of other characters who try to get away with murder. These episodes are well worth getting.",1336867200,,326,4.5423728813559325
2643286,4,B000HT3Q1Y,"At first glance ""Columbo -- The Complete Sixth & Seventh Seasons"" seems like a Columbophile's delight -- 2 seasons of the best TV detective show ever for the price of one! But as Columbo watchers know, the true nature of clues often show themselves beyond the first impressions.

Which is not to say ""Columbo Seasons 6 & 7"" is a rip-off. There is technical truth in the packaging, in that it contains ""Complete Season 6"" -- the catch is that Season 6 only consisted of 3 episodes. Going into the 1976-77 TV season NBC, in its infinite wisdom, decided to end ""Sunday Mystery Movie"" as weekly series, replacing it with ""The Big Event."" (Seriously. That's what they called it. You can look it up.) Now,  new episodes of ""Columbo"" McCloud,"" & the now widower McMillan would appear with the frequency of Haley's Comet, in between broadcasts of ""Gone With the Wind"" & Charlton Heston disaster movies.

It would have been great if the lower quantity equaled  greater quality, but even the most loyal Columbo fans, I suspect, would call the Season 6 episodes ""fair"" (which is Columboese for ""not very good""). The first episode, ""Fade In To Murder"" is the best, if only by the quality of the competition, with that canned ham William Shatner perfectly cast as the arrogant, temperamental star of America's Number One detective show, but the first-generation VHS recorder Shatner uses to create his alibi steals the show, yes, children of the microchip age, we once used such primitive equipment in our log cabins to entertain ourselves. The other 2 episodes, ""Old Fashion Murder"" (the title is the tip-off to how dynamic this episode is) which is set in a small, family-owned museum,  & ""Bye-Bye Sky High I.Q. Murder Case,"" in which an accountant knocks off his partner at a Mensa meeting, probably rank near the bottom of Columbo episodes. Which is not to say they are unwatchable, even a sub-par Columbo outing is better than most TV shows. Still, we seem to have come a long way from watching a sneering Jack Cassidy or haughty John Cassavetes playing cat & mouse with Columbo to protect their 1% status.

Fortunately, the series rebounded smartly with Season 7, with several outings that could stand among the episodes from the first 3 seasons. In ""Try And Catch Me"" a spry Ruth Gordon offs the man who killed her niece by locking him in a vault (even the murders grew more imaginative this season), watching Columbo figuring out the victim's ""dying clue"" is great fun. ""Murder Under Glass"" features Louis Jourdan as a corrupt food critic, is driven by the personal dislike between Jourdan & Columbo, which grows throughout the episode, culminating in Jourdan trying to poison Columbo, but a running gag about Columbo receiving free meals grows old. ""How To Dial a Murder"" stars Nicol Williamson, who always performs like he's carrying a grenade he is about to pull the pin out of.  Here he is memorable as a pop psych guru, of which there were many in the naval-gazing America of the 1970s, avatars of self-improvement through bullying, promising to raise your self-esteem while they told you how worthless you were & vacuumed out your wallet. His murder weapon of choice is 2 trained-to-kill Doberman pinschers, which he turns on Columbo during their final confrontation. As far as I know it was only in this episode, ""Murder Under Glass,"" and ""Lady In Waiting"" from Season 1 in which the killer actually placesColumbo in jeopardy.

""Make Me A Perfect Murder"" stars Trish Van Devere as a ruthless, amoral TV executive, a cousin of the manipulative corporate samurai Faye Dunaway portrayed in ""Network,"" children of the damned who learned about life from Bugs Bunny, land sharks who will only die if their ambition is checked. This episode is maddeningly uneven, like all episodes from Season 7, it had to fill two hours and the padding & filler is especially obnoxious, bringing the suspenseful, at times poignant, story to a dead halt at times. Still, the episode does include a subplot about a childish female star that has a certain lesbian undertone, somewhat daring for network TV in 1978, and the climax is brilliantly performed & edited. The season (and series, as it turned out) ends on a high note with ""The Conspirators,"" with Clive Revill hitting every note perfectly as an exiled Northern Ireland writer involved in a gun-running scheme, switching from pacifist poet to cold-eyed militant in the blink of an eye, entirely credible the whole time. This episode  is one of the few Columbos to use material from the headlines (probably one reason the series has not become dated) & even takes on aspects of a political thriller as Columbo scrambles to not only catch a killer but stop a terrorist scheme. The final line, ""This far and no further,"" was an appropriate line as any for the series to go out on.

And this was the end of the line for Columbo. In an exercise in show business karma, Falk, who during much of the run of the series  kept threatening to bolt the show, indicated he was willing to come back for more, but NBC & Universal, tired of the show's cost over-runs, and no longer concerned about keeping a weekly ""Mystery Movie"" franchise going, decided to pull the plug. Why bother with Falk & ""Columbo"" when they could go with the far more cheaper and tractable  ""Mrs. Columbo""? (Which tells you everything you need to know about the Fred Silverman era at NBC). TV's most favorite detective was now gone, but, as history has proven, not forgotten, and would make a come-back in George Bush I's  America.

As with virtually all Universal DVD releases of TV shows, ""Columbo - The Complete Sixth And Seventh Seasons"" features the original episodes only, with no bonuses or special features. (And unlike some of the earlier Columbo DVDs does not even offer scene selection).  If you're interested in knowing what went on behind the scenes, I totally  recommend ""The Columbo Phile,"" by Mark Dawidziak, which came out in 1988 and which contains a season-by-season, episode-by-episode break down of the show, including plenty of quotes from cast and crew.

If you're new to Columbo, a fan of highly intelligent, basically  non-violent detective shows I would recommend starting out with one of the earlier seasons, especially seasons 1 & 2, when the format was still fresh to everyone & the original creators, Richard Levinson & William Link, were still involved in the show and it was at its prime.  I would recommend ""Columbo -- Complete Sixth and Seventh Seasons"" primarily for Columbo completists.",1335571200,,6518,4.840071877807727
2643287,4,B000HT3Q1Y,"I've always been a huge fan of good, old-fashioned detective stories.  Not the modern tales of high-tech crime scene investigation or routine shoe leather police work, but the classic tales of brilliant, solitary sleuths who pit their unique genius against the world's cleverest murderers and most dastardly criminal masterminds.  There are few things I love more than a good whodunit, and few fictional heroes I admire more than the great detectives of literature, film, and television.  Because I am such a huge fan of the entire genre, it's hard for me to pick just one fictional sleuth as my all-time favorite:  Hercule Poirot?  Sherlock Holmes?  Adrian Monk?  I love them all.  But there will always be a special place in my heart for a certain LAPD homicide detective, best known for his iconic rumpled raincoat, ever-present cheap cigar, and beat-up old Peugeot convertible, as well as for his overly polite, awkwardly self-conscious, and comically absentminded demeanor, which often put suspects at ease, and for his dogged persistence -- always having ""just one more thing"" to ask -- which had the opposite effect.  I'm talking, of course, about Lieutenant Columbo.  It was always amazing to watch this unlikely genius slowly weave a web in which to ensnare an overconfident killer who was foolish enough to underestimate his brilliance.  The way he would often trick suspects into incriminating themselves was simply a delight to behold.  Among the great detectives, Columbo stands out because he never flaunted his intellect or his crime-solving skills.  He was a humble genius; and his appearance and demeanor worked like a disguise to conceal his brilliance from the criminals he was trying to outsmart.  So, in many ways, Columbo occupies a special place among the pantheon of great fictional sleuths.

Columbo is also special to me personally because I grew up watching him.  My father loved him almost as much as I did; and we would watch the show together.  So, Columbo is a reminder of my happy childhood.  My love for detective stories is due, in large part, to watching this show as a kid.  But Columbo is not a typical detective show.  For one thing, it isn't really a ""whodunit"", since the audience is made aware of who the killer is at the beginning of each episode.  Instead, it's a ""howcatchem"" -- i.e. a story about how a detective outwits a criminal (who is known to the audience from the outset).  There are other detective shows -- most notably Monk -- that use the ""howcatchem"" format; but Columbo is the most famous example of this trope.  Another thing that makes Columbo unique among crime dramas is that it actually gives us likeable criminals who are often driven to kill by motives that the audience can sympathize with.  You almost want to root for the killer to get away with it; and this allows the show to build up suspense as you watch this sympathetic character becoming more and more desperate as Columbo gets closer and closer to springing his trap.  (You still cheer for Columbo in the end, of course; but you often feel sorry for the killer who got caught.)  One final thing that separates Columbo from other detective shows on TV is that it was not simply an hour-long drama that aired week after week.  Instead, each episode was presented as a ""movie-of-the-week"", filling a 90-minute or two hour time slot; and only a few episodes aired each year, often months apart.  So, whenever Columbo was on, it was a special occasion.

I truly love Columbo, and would normally give it a five-star rating without hesitation.  But, as you can see, I've given this DVD set only four stars.  Why?  Believe me when I say that it is not meant in any way as a criticism of Columbo itself.  Rather, I felt that I had to deduct a star due to the poor audio quality on these discs.  Even when turned to the maximum setting, the volume never seemed quite loud enough for comfortable listening; and there were places where the sound just seemed to suddenly drop out so that it was next to impossible to hear the dialogue.  There was also a bad spot on one of the discs that messed up the video in the middle of one episode; but the audio problems were persistent throughout all three discs.  I love this show; but you can't enjoy what you can't hear.  So, as much as I hate to, I have to deduct one star.",1332547200,2,4331,4.711436170212766

The Bye-Bye Sky-High IQ Murder Case - as a CPA, I love it when the accountant did it.

Try and Catch Me - a very understandable murderer.  You know she's telling the truth when she tells Columbo she wishes he had been on her niece's case.

Murder under Glass -  Unusual in that Columbo says outright that he doesn't like the killer.  I can't think of another Columbo in which this happens.

The Conspirators - a very fun episode.  I disagree with the murderer's goals, but you can understand it and I wish he got away with it.

2643304,5,B000HT3Q1Y,"Peter Falk really broke the mold for the tv detective with this series.  He was the first to create a character more interesting, eccentric and funny than the murder itself.  Falk/Columbo needed a good foil to show this character off to his best advantage.  In this series he is pursuing Louis Jourdan, Ruth Gordon, Theodore Bikel, William Shatner, Trish VanDevere and other stellar actors. There is some first rate talent behind the camera too, such as directors Jonathan Demme and Leo Penn (Sean Penn's father). With these actors as the murderers, Falk/Columbo is at the top of his game. It has been years since I have seen these and I am seeing them all again now and enjoying the experience.

One thing I realize this time through that I didn't when I originally saw these is how attractive to women Falk/Columbo is.  Of course, I was in my twenties when I originally saw these and so saw him as a older man.  Now that I am older, I can really see and feel the considerable charm and magnetism he could turn on around and toward women. There is something very alluring about his rumpled, shaggy appearance. He too is often like an adorable Bassett hound when he turns on the allure, especially around the eyes.

Another thing you notice is that there are no computers, no fancy forensics, no DNA.  Watch this side by side with a CSI Episode and you will see the difference between someone who can really act (Falk/Columbo) and develop a character and actors with lesser talents who rely on flashy equipment to make or break the show. There is NO COMPARISON.

I didn't realize how well known Falk/Columbo was internationally until I saw him appear in a German movie as himself in the 1980s.  Everywhere he went in Germany, he was hailed as ""Lieutenant.""  Every single German on the street knew exactly who he was.

The premise of each of these is the same. There is an elaborate murder executed by the guest star. Columbo then wanders into the scene with his tattered raincoat, his battered car and (often) his sad basset hound. He introduces himself to the murderer and then proceeds to stalk the murderer while also driving him crazy with endless questions, seemingly stupid questions which only too late reveal themselves as all too acute.  So there is no guessing about who did it.  The sole question is, in this duel of wits between the two, how will Columbo trip up the murderer this time?

I think MONK owes a great deal to the COLUMBO show. MONK is also funny and the detective is someone no one wants to take seriously either.

I'd especially recommend this to anyone deeply stressed who needs to get away from it all.  It is almost like a vacation taken with an old friend watching these.

2643314,4,B000HT3Q1Y,"Part of the fun of watching a ""Columbo"" episode is the banter between the wily detective and the witty murderer. The episodes on this compilation provide a showcase, not just for star Peter Falk, but for the guest ""killers"" that run a very eclectic blend. The best of these are: (1) ""Old-Fashioned Murder"" with Joyce Van Patten perfect as a spinster museum curator that commits double homicide; (2) ""Try and Catch Me"" with Oscar-winner Ruth Gordon as a mystery writer that commits a murder of revenge; (3) ""How to Dial a Murder"" with Nicol Williamson and two killer canines; (4) ""Murder Under Glass"" with Louis Jourdan as a food critic with a deadly ""recipe""; and (5) ""Make Me a Perfect Murder"" featuring Trish Van DeVere as a television producer that goes to extremes to ""cancel"" a business rival and current lover. Broadway veteran Theodore Bikel is a genius with homicide on the brain in the amusing ""The Bye-Bye Sky High I.Q. Murder Case,"" which features a young Jamie Lee Curtis as a haggard waitress.

The remaining two installments have some merit but aren't quite as engaging, thus making them, in my opinion, lesser entries in the series. William Shatner seems to not stray from his usual hamminess as a television detective in ""Fade in to Murder.""  Shatner would do better as a Columbo villain in the 90's ""Butterfly in Shades of Gray.""

Though ""The Conspirators"" ranks high as a fan and critical favorite, I could never get into the storyline, due to the fact that I just don't understand the conflict in Northern Ireland, finding it to be senseless. Thus, I can't appreciate the antagonist, played by Clive Revill.

Another engaging quality in the series is to take note of the number of actors that frequently appear in the show, either as a victim, a murderer, or a featured performer. Mariette Hartley, Jeanette Nolan, Shera Danese (MRS. Peter Falk), Patrick O'Neal, James McEachin, and Tim O'Conner are just six actors that appear in this set that find themselves in past and/or future episodes.

Also, Patrick Williams is a one composer that contributes some of the best and most memorable scores for the long-running series.

One can also get a kick out of hearing the unofficial ""Columbo"" theme: ""This Old Man."" In fact, Falk sings it in one of the shows found on the set.

2643325,3,B000HT3Q1Y,"First, Columbo is wonderful to watch.  Am a huge fan of Peter Falk and his character, Columbo.  The series was well written, packed with beautiful sets, peppered with famous actors from the 70s, and had story lines that were addictive.

One huge complaint:

Where's the beef?

There are only ten hours of Columbo in this set.  TEN HOURS.  That is supposed to represent two full seasons?  TEN HOURS?  I feel like I was short-changed on this ""two season"" DVD set.  By comparison, most TV series on today run 16-26 episodes per season.",1177632000,20,532,4.684782608695652

As a diehard Columbo fan, I will probably buy the 80s and 90s stuff too -- but if you are fan of the early Columbo, this is still a must have.",1173398400,2,278,3.9464285714285716
2643328,5,B000HT3Q1Y,"Universal has wisely condensed Columbo's sixth and seventh seasons six into one collection.  We still have Columbo, one of the best characters conceived on television, but there are distinctive features in his finale seasons.  There's still the murders of the rich and famous, but their methods are often different.  This collection also lacks the star-studded line-up of past collections.  While Ruth Gordon gives one of the best and most genuine performances, and William Shatner is as likable as ever, the big names aren't as prevalent.  In some ways this is a plus, for the murderers are often as mysterious as their crimes.

`Columbo' goes out in style, but they still find new ways to kill their victims.  Innovatively, in `Try and Catch Me' the victim is locked in a safe, so his death is meant to look like an accident.  For `Murder in a Glass,' a restaurant critic uses fish poison in a bottle opener to kill a restaurant owner who will blow the whistle on his blackmail.  Perhaps the most unusual scenario is when a psychologist trains his dogs to kill a colleague in `How to Dial a Murder`.  But one of the most overlooked episodes is also one of the most rewarding:  `The Bye-Bye Sky-High I.Q. Murder Case,' involves ingenious timing.  It hardly plays in syndication to the best of my knowledge.  `The Conspirators' offers a murder that has international import where an Irish terrorist is double-crossed by an arms dealer.  In this case the motives are harder to pin-point.  And the series goes out with `Make Me a Perfect Murder'.  While the latter may not entirely live up to its title, it comes close enough to work as a final episode.

Columbo, the series and the character, went out as it came in:  fascinating, and a likable presentation of human nature with clever methods by murderer and detective alike.",1173312000,7,1825,4.794871794871795

Rumor is that the sixth and seventh season will be the last.  What about all the Columbo movies made in the 90's?  They were just as good and worthy of being brought to DVD?

The format is unique in that you see the crime happen and then watch Columbo solve it - the fun is trying to find the piece of information Columbo will use to catch the killer at the last minute.  It is surprising how many times (even though you watched the crime be committed) he solves it in a way you never saw coming.

But, I do agree with other reviewers who have complained about the lack of extras on these DVDs. I can deal with that, as long as I have a nice, crisp, unedited, digital transfer. HOWEVER, I do object when someone cuts out a magnificent music track. I refer to the WONDERFUL music score, by Patrick Williams, created for my favorite episode: ""The Conspirators."" The missing score is the rousing, Irish/Gaelic/Celtic section leading up to Columbo looking through the viewfinder at the departing ship and tugboat; as a musician, I was particularly impressed by the contrapuntal elements of this score. However, in the DVD transfer, this wonderful score is ELIMINATED! Someone on the IMDB noticed that the music score was almost identical to John Williams' score for the late Robert Altman's movie ""Images."" Could this be the reason it was removed? Whatever the reason, the loss of this great music track certainly depreciates the value of the best ""Columbo"" episode ever!",1168300800,3,1067,5.0

2643359,5,B000HT3Q1Y,"Another outstanding collection featuring our favorite detective and a set worth adding to your collection....several winners include ""Fade in to Murder""--(was it live or on Betamax?)--featuring Bill Shatner as a popular TV detective, Lt. Lucerne, who murders his agent; ""The Bye-Bye Sky High I.Q. Murder Case"" with veteran actor Theodore Bikel, a genius accountant who believes he has pulled off the perfect crime; ""Murder Under Glass""--was it the wine that was poisoned or the stopper?  Columbo takes on Louis Jourdan, a vain world-reknown restaurant critic and TV cooking host, in a case involving blackmail, murder and world-class cuisine; ""Try and Catch Me""--veteran actress (and real-life screenwriter) Ruth Gordon (""Harold & Maude"") plays a masterful mystery writer whose weapon of choice is a iron clad safe and an air tight alibi.

As a sidenote, fans of Ruth Gordon's work would be interested to know that the talented stage and screen actress co-wrote the screenplay to the Academy Award winning 1948 drama ""A Double Life"" featuring Ronald Colman (see my review).

But by far, the best episode and my personal favorite is the two hour feature, ""The Conspirators,"" directed by Leo Penn (yes, that is Sean Penn's father) featuring actor/comedian Clive Reville, as a celebrated Irish poet with ties to the IRA who eliminates the middleman to an international arms deal.

As typical of this series, the transfers and markedly clean and the sound quality, in Dolby 5.1 stereo surround, is excellent. As usual, however, Universal has provided no extras (surprisingly, since Peter Falk just published his autobiography, ""Just One More Thing: Stories From My Life"" this year), interviews, features, or even a banal installment of ""Mrs. Columbo""--then again, maybe that is a blessing!

I think they consider this on the same level as my other vices; the Brady's, and other era shows of the ilk. Sadly, they do not know the beauty that is Columbo, sadder still, if I showed them I doubt they would get it.

Columbo is just a cut above everything else. Ignited by dialogue and then fast cooled by innuendo and suspicion. Rarely will you see a show that every time out is a swing into the bleachers of history and Columbo almost accomplishes that. There does seem to be ONE episode each season I feel falls short, and this set is no different; Murder Under Glass is not palatable to me. But when you factor in the AMAZING Lt. Lucerne and the wit and charm of the marvelous Ruth Gordon; who cares!!

Someday I may let my friends in on this near perfect series, but for now when they enter a room I will be armed with Rosebud.",1164758400,11,1060,4.321608040201005

Suddenly we have nearly blank audio stretching out with Columbo driving over the Long Beach bridge and chugging along to the binoculars on the docks, etc.  Ludicrous.  Everytime I saw this on TV and video previous to this release there was a cranking bagpipe incidental soundtrack.  Can Universal turn out ONE tv series without some kind of jacked up mistake??

2643372,5,B000HT3Q1Y,"Series 6 and 7 of Columbo contain some great episodes.

Series 6 only had three episodes, but they are all terrific.  In 'Fade In To Murder' Columbo is on the trail of a TV detective (William Shatner)who murdered his blackmailing producer. In 'Old-Fashioned Murder' a museum curator is willing to kill in order to prevent her brother from selling off her beloved collection of antiquities.  And in 'The Bye-Bye Sky-High IQ Club Murder' it won't surprise anyone to find that Columbo is smarter than the average genius.  In all three of these episodes Columbo establishes a close rapport with his murder suspect, the exchanges between him and William Shatner are particularly enjoyable.

My favourite episode in series 7 is 'Try and Catch Me' in which Ruth Gordon gives a superb performance as an crime writer who murders her niece's widower, who she believs was responsible for her niece's death.  Another great episode is 'Murder Under Glass', in which Louise Jordan plays a ruthless restaurant critic who murders the chef he has been blackmailing when his victim threatens to expose him.  I would advise you not to watch this particular episode if you happen to be hungry,or on a diet, because Columbo is tempted with delicious food in almost every scene, and it may prove too much for you.

However, whether you are hungry or not, this set should satisfy your appetite for watching Columbo solve another batch of cases in his unique and charming way.",1164326400,16,1452,4.8979591836734695

She then slams the vault door shut where he suffocates. However, she is out witted by her victim. He ingeniuosly leaves a clue leading to his murderer. It's brilliant.

2643375,5,B000HT3Q1Y,"Here's a list of the eight episodes featured on this 6th and 7th season collection:

Episode 38: FADE IN TO MURDER (Airdate: Oct/10/76). This is the segment with the one and only William Shatner as an actor who plays a popular TV detective that murders his blackmailing agent. The episode also features Walter Koenig who played Chekov on Star Trek. This one doesn't touch Leonard Nimoy's fabulous Columbo installment ""A Stich in Crime,"" but works simply because of Shatner's undeniable star power.

Episode 39: AN OLD FASHIONED MURDER (Airdate: Nov/28/76). A bland female museum curator (Joyce Van Patten) hires a questionable guard to kill her brother so she can collect the insurance money; she then kills the guard and makes it look like a break-in gone awry. It's okay but definitely one of the lesser Columbo outings.

Episode 40: THE BYE-BYE SKY HIGH I.Q. MURDER CASE (Airdate: May/22/77). Two former college friends, now partners in an accounting firm, are members of an elite intellectual club. One is murdered after he threatens to squeal about the other's embezzling from the firm. Theodore Bikel and Samantha Eggar are on hand. This episode features the longest and most peculiar story title of any ""Columbo"" outing.

Episode 41: TRY AND CATCH ME (Airdate: Nov/21/77). Ruth Gordon plays a mystery writer who kills her nephew-in-law as revenge for murdering her niece. The beauteous Mariette Hartley is also on hand. I can't remember how this popular segment ends, but this is definitely one time where Columbo should have let the person go like Dirty Harry in ""Sudden Impact.""

Episode 42: MURDER UNDER GLASS (Airdate: Jan/30/78). A popular television food critic murders a restaurant owner via blowfish poison. This one features Peter Falk's new wife, the incredibly beautiful Shera Danese, whom he married Dec. 7, 1977 (and remains married to!). Shera also played 'Molly' in ""Fade in to Murder"" (Episode 38, above) and starred in four 'second generation' episodes as well. The lovely France Nuyen, who played the haughty Elaan in the Star Trek episode ""Elaan of Troyius,"" is also on hand as Mary Choy.

Episode 43: MAKE ME A PERFECT MURDER (Airdate: Feb/28/78). Laurence Luckinbill plays a network executive who gets a promotion and is about to move to New York; his attractive, ambitious lover, played by Trish Van Devere, expects to get his old position but Luckinbill declines, thinking the job is out of her league. Feeling betrayed, Trish murders him and takes the position. Laurance would go on to play the renegade Sybok in ""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.""

Episode 44: HOW TO DIAL A MURDER (Airdate: Apr/15/78). A famous psychiatrist utilizes a conditioning reflex technique on his dogs to kill his dead wife's lover; this technique also involves a phone call and the key word ""Rosebud."" A youthful Kim Cattrall is on hand; Kim of course starred on ""Sex in the City,"" but is also known for roles in ""Porky's"" and ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"" (How does ""Columbo"" attract so many Star Trek alumni?).

Episode 45: THE CONSPIRATORS (Airdate May/13/78). A charismatic Irish poet, who runs a peace organization while running guns as a covert revolutionary, murders an arms dealer who tries to swindle him. Clive Revill and Bernard Behrens are featured.

This would mark the end of the ""First Generation"" of Columbo episodes. The ""Second Generation"" would run from 1989-2003. I personally find something to like in every ""Columbo"" outing, after all, with Peter Falk as Columbo, how can you go wrong?

2643379,4,B000HT3Q1Y,"This is the finale of the great Columbo series and I heartily

recommend it. However, the episodes in this DVD set are a mixed bag as compared to the earlier seasons.  Whereas at first, Columbo's persona is ""modest and mildly eccentric"", for some reason, it was decided to experiment with another version of him (starting with the poor ""Last Salute to the Commodore"" episode which ended season 5) and they made him ""arrogant and goofy"" in some of the episodes.  When the series was revived in the 1980's, Peter Falk continued with the ""arrogant and goofy"" Columbo, so as far as I am concerned, the revival series is not ""really Columbo"".  In spite of this, there are some fine episodes in seasons 6 and 7 where we see the old Columbo such as

""Fade Into Murder"", where William Shatner (an uneven actor at best) puts in a fine performance as the TV star/murderer Lt. Lucerne/Ward Fowler. However, the best was saved for last, the final episode ""The Conspirators"" (this is where I got the title for my review) in which Clive Reville puts in a BRILLIANT performance as Joe Devlin who plays Irish terrorist who escaped to America where he became a celebrity writer and poet but where he also quietly raised money for IRA terrorist activities in Northern Ireland.  The ""Joe Devlin"" character is based on a real-life alcoholic Irish writer name Brendan Beehan who as a youngster was involved with IRA activities.  I am glad that the writers were not afraid to shy away from a controversial subject and they turned out a gem of an episode (watch out for the hilarious ""duel of the limericks"" in this episode).
