8324753,3,B00007JMD7,"My three year old loves this video, as the Chinese Dragon is one of his favorite trains to play with.  However, they do use the words ""Shut up!"" a time or two, which I could live without.  Obviously, this isn't a phrase I want my child using, so we may hide this video away until he's older.",1118361600,,291,4.087719298245614
8324754,5,B00007JMD7,This is a really good tape. The dragon though scary was pretty funny. Donald & Douglas are 2 of my favorite characters. BoCo is also one of them. In the later tapes Donald & Douglas aren't in it as much as Bill & Ben but they are better. BoCo is really deprived of a good episode. But it was great to see Edward do something good for a change. Percy really isn't in it much either and he's one of the best characters. Percy's Ghostly Trick is a must buy if you like this one,1066003200,6,474,4.0
