5893964,3,B00E8A0POE,"Pastor Dan (James Tupper) and his family move to the small town of Stahl(?). It is a quaint town but seems slightly odd. Rebecca (Rebekah Brandes) the token eye candy daughter has nightmares and develops a liking for Noah (Ethan Peck) the son of the out going preacher (Clancy Brown). You know the town has a secret and at some point it has a nice eerie Thomas Tryon feel to it.

The ending was fairly decent, but the film didn't come together. The events in the film didn't tie into anything, it just happened because that was the way things should happen. The acting was decent. The film took time to develop character, perhaps a bit too much at the expense of a decent horror scene. There are ways to build character quickly and effectively. The scenes were good, but collectively the story fell.

Will make for an acceptable rental. I believe this will be part of a multi-pack in a year or so.

5893965,4,B00E8A0POE,"I had no idea Slash from Guns `N Roses had started a production company until I received his first release in the mail last week.  This film, NOTHING LEFT TO FEAR, intrigued me from the start, especially when it mentioned Stull, Kansas.  The urban legends around Stull have fascinated me for a long time, and this newest addition to the canon is a welcome one.  The film itself is a great debut, and any horror fan should be proud to have it in their collection.

I love the simplicity of the story in this film.  I think that's part of what makes the movie so creepy to me; granted, it's a somewhat familiar storyline, but there are enough unique elements here to garner your attention.

NOTHING LEFT TO FEAR is shot well and has a truly creepy feel to it.  This feeling conveys well onscreen and transfers quickly to the audience.  I particularly like the locale in which the film is shot; it is not Stull, but rather a small town in Louisiana.  The any-town USA vibe that it gives off, however, cannot be ignored.

The acting is good and the special effects are nice, although there were way too many CG effects and not enough practical.  Still, the CG looks good and is effective to an extent.  My sole complaint is that the film could have been so much more gorier.  In the Behind the Scenes feature, Slash admits that he went for more psychological terror over gore...but I think some more carnage would have been fun.

NOTHING LEFT TO FEAR is a hell of a debut movie and I recommend giving it a shot.  The film hits store shelves today, so make a note to check it out.",1381190400,5,1575,4.382758620689655

Wendy (Heche) and her family have just moved into a new town where her husband is set to be the new minister in the church. What starts off as a nice new life in a town with great people soon turns horrific when the true intentions of the outgoing minister (Brown) are revealed. This is a hard movie to review. It started off pretty slow but did have decent character development then it started to get bizarre. It went from slow to a movie that was Mama like to another gory possession movie. I have said that just because a movie turns gross doesn't automatically mean that it's scary. If they would have stuck with the slow-burn type horror where you are waiting for something to happen, to me that is scarier then what happened. That is just my opinion though.

5893969,4,B00E8A0POE,"Guitar icon SLASH, who made a name for himself with GUNS N' ROSES, VELVET REVOLVER, and then as a solo artist, has launched his own horror movie production company, Slasher Films, and Nothing Left To Fear is their first endeavour. To be clear, Slash does not star in the movie; he co-produced the 100-minute feature, and co-wrote the musical score. Directed by Anthony Leonardi III, Nothing Left To Fear was inspired by the legend of Stull, Kansas - one of the Seven Gates of Hell. The story centers on a pastor relocating his family from the big city to a small town, where unbeknownst to them, the locals are not what they seem. After moving into their new house, his eldest teenage daughter experiences gruesome nightmares, but a fate far worse befalls her sister - demonic possession. Whilst paying tribute to traditional elements of the genre, Nothing Left To Fear also employs a few new twists, resulting in a truly gripping ride. Despite a lengthy beginning which serves to establish the characters, the spook-you moments are genuine and not forced. Then when the carnage is unleashed, it's done incredibly well. While blood is spilled, it's not graphic or gory, making the viewer realize this ""fictional story"" could actually be fact. Filmed on location in Louisiana, Nothing Left To Fear combines superb casting, an excellent script, and terrific cinematography. Ultimately this is a killer piece, and simultaneously comes to a conclusive ending, while presenting the opportunity for a sequel. Finally, don't leave the theater, or press stop at home, before the credits roll. Cause if you do, you'll miss the brand new song, titled `Nothing Left To Fear', from Slash and Myles Kennedy.",1380240000,5,1694,5.01063829787234

5893994,2,B00E8A0POE,"LOADS OF SPOILERS (and a lot of ranting LOL)

This is a mediocre religious horror story about a small town with a dark secret.

The film starts out in a rather familiar but promising way.  A wholesome and outwardly religious family stops to ask for directions to their new home in Stull, Kansas.  The father of the family is relocating to serve as the new pastor of the quaint, God-fearing hamlet.  Reminiscent of The Last Exorcism (2010) and Children of the Corn (1984), the vast openness of the countryside hints at a socially remote and geographically isolated Bible Belt society living under a patriarchal theocracy in lieu of modern government.  And thats exactly what we get.

Of course, everyone in town is hospitable to their new pastor, despite being a bit on the weird side.  And, also of course, things start to get weirderand slow!  After a brisk start, the pace becomes sluggish after we are introduced to our protagonist family and the residents of Stull.

The introduction is acceptably tropey and features good acting, but sadly the scares fail to follow suit.  The delivery behind a nightmare sequence featuring creepy townspeople and decaying ectoplasm-spewing ghosts failed to provoke even a flinch out of me.  They may not have used loud noises to get the job done, but the scares never really connected; feeling ill-staged and randomly inserted.  And, not that I expect or demand much in the way of monster originality, but the evil entities smack a little too hard of Grave Encounters (2011), The Apparition (2012) and Pulse (2006), featuring wispy black ectoplasm that creeps like a supernatural infection afflicting flesh and inanimate objects alike with an abyssal decay.  Once our evil antagonist assumes a more consistent form, it resembles a mix of Bughuul and a J-Horror stringy-air-in-the-face poltergeist with its victims appearing much as those drained corpses in Lifeforce (1985) or Hellbound: Hellraiser II (1988).  Sure, this film borrows a lot and, sure, Im okay with borrowing horror elements.  Its just that this film failed to pack any punch.

Further failing to elicit any interest was the misplaced plot device of an inhuman tooth serving as some sort of unexplained (and completely unnecessary) unholy artefact.  This wasn't subtle.  This tooth was discussed a lot by characters and we see it change hands multiple times.  This is the first sign that the film is falling apart before our eyes because, when were introduced to the tooth, it is evidently used as a form of Gods hand to choose a victim for a dark ritualand that choice is made when someone eats a piece of welcome to town cake with the tooth in it!  There are better, creepier and still easier ways to have accomplished that task in a horror movie.

In an attempt to create a dire atmosphere, we encounter lines like Have you made the choice?  There can be no mistakesWere doing His will.  Clearly the locals have plans for their new pastor and his family.  A sacrificea possessionan infernal impregnation (i.e., devil baby), perhaps?  Suggesting that some impending evil is somehow the work of God, nightmare sequences now shift to undead demonic sheep afflicted with some manner of evil plague.  Like the previous nightmare, it doesnt seem to make any sense.  Sure, there are some Biblical plague references in the imagery, but they are sorely misapplied.

So, I have now twice mentioned nightmare sequences.  These are the dreams of the new pastors quite attractive older daughter (Rebekah Brandes) and, it turns out, that there is no reason for her to be having these dreams!  Nothing is explained, implied, metaphorically paralleledI couldn't even invent a reason for her to be having these foreboding dreams indicating that something bad was going to happen to her familyespecially because she is not the chosen one.  Screwing up the already scrambled synthesis of this messy story even more is that her nightmares imply that specific townspeople will do her (or her family) harmbut that doesnt actually happen except for one indirect case.  Some townspeople do poison the other daughter and, again, there seems to be no reason behind it at all given the events that follow.

Many things are introduced that warrant explanation, aspects of the ritual being a lot of them

Why is a sacrifice required?  What happens if they don't do the ritual?  How often must the ritual be performed?  How do you know when its time to do the ritual?  Do you always use the tooth to choose the victim?  What if the new victims are gluten-intolerant and don't eat the cake?  Where the Hell did this tooth come from?  A demon?  What demon? Why is the victim later poisoned?  Why does the victims sister receive warnings in the form of nightmares?  How do they know when to end the ritualbecause, YES, that happens!  The ritual and the awful things that come with it has an off switch.  Heres a good one.  If this happens every 10-20 years, how is the occasional death of an entire family (save one survivor who keeps her mouth shut for some reason) explained?  Does no one (e.g., police/FBI/PIs) ever look for them and connect the dots that a new-to-town family (except one locally adopted survivoras if thats how adoption worked) is wiped out within days of moving once every decade?  Heres another winner.  What happens if the surviving family members flee the town?  It turned out that a surviving family member was used to end the ritual.  What if they died or got awaydemon apocalypse?  End of Days for Stullthe world?

There are movies that get away with leaving things mysterious.  The Shrine (2010) is an excellent example.  However, The Shrine doesnt keep dealing out things that merit explanationso it actually works!  Children of the Corn also leaves a lot to the imagination, but it does so flawlessly and doesnt pelt us with seemingly important things that go unexplained.

The effects are fine, even sort of good.  Theyre just not effective in delivery.  The same can be said for the story and other components of this film.  Despite some capable performances by Clancy Brown (as the retiring pastor) and Anne Heche, this was a largely unsatisfying movie experience.  While the idea behind the ending was okay, the execution was a bit weakbut maybe a bit satisfying as well.

The only thing that really worked in this movie was our introduction to the characters, the opening atmosphere and the notion that something was weird about this townall in the first 20-30 minutes.  After that it all failed to find any form of synthesis, urgency, thrills or concern on my part.  The characters didn't do things that made sense, they didn't react appropriately to situations (yes, even for a horror movie), and I left annoyed by the things that weren't explained.  A better movie would have left me curious, not annoyed.

As if it made any difference, Guns r Roses Slash was a producer on this film.

There's one particularly heart-haunting scene that stays with me, involving one of the characters trying to escape their pursuers.

5894002,4,B00E8A0POE,"It's disappointing to see most people hated Nothing Left to Fear based on the many negative reviews on this page, but I actually found it surprisingly good.  It's true that it's lacking for the first half but the film has this way of teasing viewers in a way that make me uncertain what's going to happen and when the horror's arriving, while being above average in the writing.  The final 30 minutes, I kid you not, is flat out *awesome*.  Terrifying to the extreme, and the Silent Hill lover in me totally loves the final 30 minutes of Nothing Left to Fear.  I'll get to that later.

Anyway the movie's about a family (two teenage daughters, a young son, and mother and father) who travel to the Midwest because the father wants to become a preacher in a small town.  At first they're not exactly welcomed with open arms until the father reveals his purpose for being there.  Then they treat him with kindness.  Well, fake kindness, lol.  For the longest time the story focuses on Rebekah Brandes (the older teenage daughter) quietly roaming around town with a boy she likes (Ethan Peck's character) and the tone and writing here feels like something from an episode of Supernatural but without the weirdness factor.  However given the easy to follow storyline and the fact I like movies that take place in the Midwest, I admire this part more than others would perhaps.  I admit the setting's a weakness of mine.  Farmlands rock!  Anyway every so often Ethan would have to go his separate ways and cut the date with Rebekah short for reasons that seemed suspicious.  We find out later what's going on.

Now Rebekah reminds me of um, a certain famous naughty girl amazon wouldn't approve of me mentioning (who's also from the Midwest, hehe, perfect choice!) but what really surprises me is the story suddenly focuses on her sister (Jennifer Stone's) character.  At first Jennifer's very talkative and boisterous always in search of fun and hot guys, so I'm really surprised she had a bigger role later.  When the ex-pastor of the church (Clancy Brown) decides to spike Jennifer's drink and kidnap her during a carnival night of fun, the poor helpless girl wakes up tied to a pole and while this part was never clearly stated, an evil presence comes out of the water, takes over Jennifer's body, and when she returns home to her family she's now a possessed, eerily quiet and completely different person.

What I find especially frightening are the special effects.  True the film overall has a low budget feel to it in the quiet atmosphere, acting and story writing, but I feel the story building slowly throughout the movie was decent enough, and when the final 30 minutes rolls around, look out!  REALLY entertaining stuff!  Now the adrenaline pumping suspense REALLY kicks in.  Jennifer Stone's possessed boy performs this disturbing move where she literally sucks the souls out of people and turns their faces black and hollow before our very eyes which is definitely uncomfortable to say the least, so after turning her mother into a fragile clump of dust and the father comes home and sees what's going on, the chase is on.  Everyone in the family has to run/drive away from Jennifer's possessed soul-sucking ability (or whatever it's really called).

I mean the final 30 minutes is pure awesomeness.  The atmosphere changes significantly.  Now whenever street lights would flicker it would indicate Jennifer's getting closer.  I loved all of this.  The younger brother plays a bigger role too- after being unable to reason with his older sister and Ethan who are arguing over what to do about Jennifer (whether to return home or run away), he decides to walk inside the homes nearby as a way to escape his possessed sister getting ever closer.  All the homes have a red-blooded X painted on their front door as a way to ward off evil I'm guessing.  However when he's finally able to make it inside (using a doggie door) he's not exactly welcomed with open arms by this frightened family apparently waiting around for the evil to pass, so out he goes.  I was really surprised that... well I won't spoil it.  Let's just say what happens to the little boy I did not see coming!

I won't mention anything more.  Just that the ending wasn't clear to me what really happened.  It has to do with Rebekah as one would suspect given she's the main character, but whatever happened isn't really clear to me.  Oh well, still a good movie.  Otherwise the scene where Jennifer accidentally bites into an abnormally oversized seashell-like tooth while eating a slice of blue birthday cake was highly unusual based on the amount of blood that came from the roof of her mouth (and the fact she didn't notice the tooth based on the small slither of cake she cut).  It was almost sickening that neither Rebekah or Ethan would say ""Hey, you have blood dripping off your chin- you better wipe it off"", lol.

Yes this film isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it's certainly mine.  Midwestern setting reminding me of Children of the Corn perhaps, curiosity wondering where the story's going, and a spectacular and terrifying 30 minutes at the end makes this movie 4 stars for me.  With more content in the first half and stronger writing, the movie might've even been 5 stars.",1438819200,,5260,4.729967069154775

It turns out they are invited to the town to fulfill some sort of obligatory sacrifice. It's not clear what the town is sacrificing to, what happens if they don't complete the sacrifice or what the heck is going on with the teenage boy interested in the pastor's oldest daughter.

5894016,4,B00E8A0POE,"A Seventh Heaven style family of a young pastor move to a rural small town to further his career.  It is pretty apparent there is something not quite right with the townsfolk of this town as none really want to make eye contact with the kids when they journey out to the town itself. This is a pretty formulaic sacrifice/possession type horror film, there is nothing in this that reinvents or adds a must see scene to the genre, but it amicably passes the time.  Perhaps the movie would have been better (or scary) as a thriller horror rather than special effects one if the threat was maybe just a mental disorder or cult like teachings in the minds of some townsfolk, of a perceived evil that's needs sacrifices for rather than trying to make the entity a reality.

We never really find out any background on the whole scenario and like all these sorts of horror films you wonder why everyone in town doesn't just move to somewhere normal and far away.  The plot relies on certain behaviour of individuals to work (spoilers follows) such as a daughter just hoeing into a cake rather than eat it like a normal person where they are likely to see something large that shouldn't be there.

5894027,1,B00E8A0POE,"I normally avoid spoilers in my reviews, but I've decided to include a handful in this one because I'd like to be very clear about why I think you shouldn't watch this movie. I'll list the spoilers in the order they occur in the film, so if you don't want to read any major plot points, you can get about halfway down the list and still be fine. Otherwise, if you also hate spoilers, go read another review.

The plot concerns a young pastor and his perfect family as they move to a new town in rural Kansas where he will be taking over as the town preacher as the current, older man of God finally retires. Unfortunately, this very spiritual town harbors an evil secret that will threaten the lives of our fresh-faced newcomers.

PROBLEM #1 -- CHARACTERS: The characters in this film are little more than mannequins. Only the exiting pastor has anything approaching a personality. The new family is so flawless and cutesy and filled with aw-shucks playfulness that they don't seem real. They're about as bland as they could get without being called Characters 1 through 5. The oldest daughter, Rebecca, begins to get hints that something is off about the town when she befriends local heartthrob, Noah, who's main character trait is that he occasionally stares off into space with a sullenly weird expression on his face. Noah's definitely a looker (you can tell -- especially by his voice -- that actor Ethan is related to Gregory Peck), but he's a one-note character as well.

PROBLEM #2 -- PACING: For a movie where you have some idea of what to expect, the movie takes its sweet time, relying on cheesy dream segments and misleading musical cues to make it seem like scary things are happening for the first hour of the film. Aside from this, nothing really goes on other than a bad piece of cake and a wayward tooth.

PROBLEM #3 -- ONE SCARY IDEA: The movie is about a gate that exists in the town that must be closed. But first, it must be opened. Huh? The youngest daughter, Mary, is ""chosen"" by a pastry to be the one who is possessed, and so she is drugged, abducted, and tied to a post while the pastor opens the gate and allows the girl to be possessed. This includes the same scary effect that you've seen in nearly every cheesy horror movie or fake-out scream clip on YouTube where you think you're watching kittens or something and then a ghoul jumps out at you. Dark eyes, overlong jaw, dark mouth. This is the movie's only scary card, and it plays it over and over and over.

PROBLEM #4 -- LAZY WRITING: Nothing about this ritual is explained. Why it exists, how it started, what it means ... people keep saying ""the gate must be closed!"" but it seems a whole lot like they were the ones who opened it. Any specific details about the back story are dismissed by the old Pastor Kingsman who simply says, ""This is the way things have always been."" This is what I call lazy screenwriting. I don't think films always need to provide answers, but when the crux of your film's plot and basic source of scares is vague, confusing, and filled with complex and unexplained rules, then it becomes more annoying than spooky.

PROBLEM #5 -- MAJOR PLOT HOLES CAUSED BY MANIPULATIVE STORYTELLING: When things finally start to get going at around the sixty minute mark, Mary -- possessed by the demon or whatever -- goes around sucking the lifeforce out of her family members while making a sound like a car's slightly-wonky transmission. Rebecca and her little brother, Chris, watch as their dad is turned into ashes before their eyes. Terrified, Noah drives them hastily away as Mary begins to come after them. Then, about a block and a half away, Rebecca demands that Noah stop the car so that she can get out and scream about everything. With a hellspawn approaching her a block and a half away. Everything about this scene was so awkwardly contrived to make things tense, that it was just another nuisance. I could picture the writer thinking, ""I don't want them to get away from the demon so easily. Should the car stall? Should the demon have super speed? No. Those are cheesy and lame. I've got an idea! I'll have the blonde spaz out and demand to yell on the street instead of while they escape! For no reason!""

This is followed by one of the weirdest plot holes, wherein the demon catches up to them, Chris runs out of the car to find refuge in a house, and Rebecca and Noah run BACK to the car, and drive off, leaving Chris stranded even though they all had plenty of time to escape together. I don't know about you, but when characters abandon an eight year old boy to a demon for no reason, it tends to cast them in a negative light. This, of course, was done solely to make things creepier and to show how the whole town is callously in on the murder of this one family, but it's shoehorned stupidly into the script. So stupidly that, a minute after Noah nearly escapes the demon, Noah and Rebecca are shown driving back to where they left Chris. Yeah. They abandoned him and then decided, ""Wait. What are we, monsters? Let's go back. Oops. He's cornered by that demon thing.""

PROBLEM #6 -- PREDICTABILITY: The script doesn't try to do anything new or unique with its story, which is never fully fleshed out anyway. But the so-called ""twist"" that the movie tries to employ at the ending is so dumb and obvious (and actually a little full of itself), that it's the last in a long line of painful eye rollers.

if you watch it the first time through, its pretty good. But if you watch it a second time, then you can see where certain things link the whole story together. At times, the film takes a surreal feel to it.

There are a large number of symbols throughout. This is a story told not only through the actor's dialogue, but through the visuals, if you're sharp enough to pick up on them.

The music is haunting, and even chilling in places. Sadly, it is not on cd but can be bought for download elsewhere.

***SPOILER ALERT***

The one bad thing I can say about this film is the ending scene. It is similar to the beginning scene. In my opinion, I think it would have made more sense to show an aftermath of the surviving characters. Where did they go from there? did they leave the town? did they move to a different house?  Instead, a surviving lead character is shown in a ""groundhog"" day type replay scene.",1390780800,,1010,4.2894736842105265
5894036,3,B00E8A0POE,"I don't have much to add to these already great reviews except to say the movie is a complete knock off mostly of the HALLOWEEN franchise (in addition to the others you guys mentioned).

1. Remember in Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers; and the other movies, it was explained that Michael was to kill all of his family as a sort of sacrifice to ward off a greater evil or destruction to the world? Same thing with her. He had the curse of the ""thorn"" or something like that; she had a big tooth that looked like a thorn in a cake. She also had the lemonade curse and others.

2. Also, that Michael kind of quietly stalks his victims, but is always tricked somehow and near-killed allowing the others to get away? The demon in this movie was tricked into the church to ""close the door."" Notice Michael always comes back to try to complete his mission of getting the family member.

It's the same basic story. Basically, when Michael misses his victim, he starts killing others around. I swear to you on this movie on the part where her little brother got inside the house, I thought the demon was going to ""break the norm"" somehow and go inside the blood-marked X house to get its prey.

Basically the same as Halloween series.

If I had never seen other horror movies, I'd have liked this movie a lot as everything would not have been so familiar.

A decent, morality in the grey area type of horror movie. Pretty good considering since the end of the Cold War, there is less of a polarized world. Less of a ""Good and Evil"" world of black and white. It's a grey area. Watch movies from the 1950s through the early 1970s especially, and in general from the 1950s to 1990 and you see that simple conception of evil and good. In this movie, it's hard to call anyone evil at the end except the demon itself. I'd still wish to find some other way than sacrificing other families.",1389312000,3,1874,4.3861671469740635

There are spoilers in this review.

The first 15 minutes or so will give you a hint of what's to come...one of the characters has a nightmare in which a woman appears and in a ""surprise shock"" effect, the woman's eyes turn to sunken black and her mouth gapes open, also black. Oh, really, give me a break... This effect has been recycled and recycled in horror movies now for almost a decade, and it's really time some new ideas surfaced. Anyway, the family start to realise something is wrong, but they take their sweet time about it, and it's unsurprising to see that they are soon at the mercy of the entire town and their terrible secret rite that has been planned all along. The secret rite itself really doesn't make a lot of sense, and what made me laugh at first is that the rite is done twice, once to unleash a horrible evil, and then repeated at some arbitrary point later in the film, this time to seal the evil back up again. Umm...wouldn't it have saved time just not to do the secret rite at all? Like, ever? Ok, I assume that without the secret rites being done at all, something far worse would go on, but there's no sense of what this might be, the script just makes the townsfolk in to cheerless bystanders and the main ""bad guys"" into characterless goons.

The lame script doesn't really help. Dozens of horror movie standard scenes are poured into the mix. Chase scenes where characters don't do anything logical that would actually result in them getting away, like driving out of town. Lots and LOTS of shots of blackened eyes and gaping black mouths. Waaay too many of these. And the dialogue doesn't help either. Girl: ""Something's going on here, what is it? "" Boy: ""Not now. I have to go"". Great stuff. Boy: ""There's something I have to tell you."" Girl: "" What is it?"" Girls kid brother, barging in: ""Hey sis, come quick, something's up!"" Damned kid brothers and their bad timing!

The acting is only passable, but what I did like is the fact that the possession takes a hold of what seemed to be an almost throwaway supporting character at the start of the movie. There are some good sceens when this character is just starting to become ill, and these are more creepy than the full scale goof-out that happens in the last 30 minutes of the film, which is all CGI and really shows that this is not the medium of choice for quick horror effects, and you can spot every bit of CGI every time.

Although it's competently filmed and looks n ice and professional, it doesn't show any originality at all, it just screams ""Bandwagon"". There are loads of 'small town secret"" horror films out there, like ""The Shrine"", which this movie shares many elements with, but ""The Shrine"" is far superior, better made and with a better plot.

His older sibling, traveling with him, screeches away in the truck (driven by a local townsperson) instead of running back on foot to grab the younger sibling (who was about thirty feet away) and get him back in the truck.

Easy to figure out since filmmakers/writers were going for the disappointing/hopeless scenario.  The only thing good about this movie was the music.",1383004800,2,416,5.0144927536231885

Also, the effects of the black smoke swirls inky strands aren't that great.  Looks like the demon dabbed on a bit too much black eye shadow. The movie also leaves the viewer to assume the rituals haven one right after another.  The town knows they happen and all look unhappy about it but no one tries to do anything about it.  The demon lives in a well and must be appeased and that is all we really know about that.  Why they have a tooth and where they got it much less who got it is never revealed.  Why the red X on the door is never revealed.  I'm guessing it is similar to The Village as to why the X is there.  The whole town was afraid yet no one tried to leave.  Even the remaining family member stayed to see it done over and over and over.  Why would one stay in a town that destroyed their family?  Just not very cohesive.",1382313600,3,939,4.0710382513661205

5894065,2,B00E8A0POE,"It's not often that a movie outright pisses me off.  I see a lot of bottom-of-the-barrel movies for some odd reason, but very few of them make me outright angry for watching them.

Nothing Left To Fear made me angry.  I think the biggest reason why is the movie actually starts off well, has likable characters (at first), establishes a good Christian community (at first), looks good and has decent actors.  If the film actually made better use of the people in the main family and continued with being a Christian horror film, it probably could have been good.

The problems start when Rebecca (one of the two not-so-teenage daughters) starts having weird dreams.  There turns out to be no reason for her to have these dreams except for perhaps plot convenience and cheap foreshadowing.

Second, the story centers around a ritual the town has to perform every once in a while (annually?  bi-annually?  whenever Clancy Brown gets bad vibes?  who knows).  This wouldn't be a bad thing if it ever became clear what the details of the ritual were.  In a good horror story like the video game Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly, the details are very clear: One twin sister has to kill the other twin to appease the god of the village and to keep it from coming out and killing everyone.  Simple, scary and to the point, right?

Here, there never seems to be any clear reasoning behind the ritual, except that it's ""God's will.""  Moreover, the ritual is centered around which family member eats a piece of cake with a demon tooth in it.  I wish I were making that up.  Anyway, so the person who eats the tooth-cake (Rebecca's sister Mary) is the chosen one for the ritual, and is subjected to being impregnated by a demon residing in a well.  After a bit of time, the possessed family member then has to go around killing all the non cake-eating members of the family, except for one remaining member, whose blood is then used in the same well to draw the demon back into it for another period of time.  I'm not sure if it matters which family member lives or not, but if it did, the movie never addresses it. Actually, what would have happened if one of the family members turned out to be adopted?  Would the ritual have failed miserably then?

As soon as the hell starts breaking loose in the film, the two most likable characters in the family are immediately killed off in unspectacular fashion.  Soon after, the audience is treated to Rebecca abandoning her kid brother Christopher to her demon sister, basically leaving him to die.  In the next scene, she is not seen as distraught, or even concerned, about her brother being in danger.  This scene is particularly horrible because Christopher was the smart one begging Rebecca and her boyfriend to not stand and argue outside the car while a homicidal demon is approaching, and instead do the smart thing and drive far, far away from the demon.

So yes, after this scene Rebecca becomes incredibly hateable, and that's bad news because of course she's the main character.  So when it gets to that, what's the point of even caring anymore?  The ending of the movie plays in predictable fashion and the final scene shows the cycle of the ritual will continue; in fact, it's basically a repeat of a similar scene shown earlier in the film.  So there's no good payoff, no lessons learned, and no point to watching Nothing Left to Fear.",1382140800,7,3383,4.6214405360134005
5894066,4,B00E8A0POE,"When I first saw this movie on the shelf at Best Buy I said to myself ""Great. Another possession film."" but out of curiosity, I picked it up and read the plot of the film on the back and it actually didn't sound that bad. So I decided to check out Amazon reviews before buying it and seeing how many mixed reviews there were, I decided the only way to truly know for myself is to buy it. It came in the mail today and I was actually impressed with it.

Pastor Dan has is relocating from big city to small town with his wife, Wendy and 3 kids Mary, Rebecca, and Christopher to the town of Stull, Kansas where Dan is scheduled to replace retiring pastor Kingsman at the local church. Rebecca ends up be-friending one of a very strange local, whom she becomes very close with, very quickly. Before long, Rebecca is haunted by vivid, paranormal visions and Mary comes down with a strange sickness that gets worse over time. The family soon realizes that they were ""selected"" by the town of Stull to be sacrificed to ""close the gate"" that will prevent Satan from taking over the world. One night at the town's Summer Festival, Mary has her drink drugged and is kidnapped by a townsman and taken to be sacrificed, which is where it all starts.

The effects for Mary's possession were so-so but because this is not the highest budgeted of movies, I didn't expect it. From the time Mary's body is possessed, only her family can save her from the evil that awaits them but even they may not be enough to stop the inevitable from happening.

Right off the bat, I want to say that this is not your typical possession film. Yes it does revolve around a female who has been possessed by a demon, but the overall story of the movie is what makes it different from the 80 other possession films you could find. Unlike other possession films, Nothing Left To Fear gives off a ""You're on your own"" vibe, leaving the family to fight their own battle whereas all the others commonly involve a priest, bibles, crucifixes, holy water, etc. You'll find none of that here. Just a good plot with semi-decent effects that overall make for a pretty decent movie.

The film also features the song Nothing Left To Fear by Slash and Myles Kennedy in the credits, which is a very addicting song that can take anyone in with its mellow yet spine tingling vibe",1382054400,4,2328,4.432242990654205

The original cemetery church is torn down, but a nice new one is across the street.  The town is maybe 5 buildings total. The town in this movie is huge compared to Stull.
