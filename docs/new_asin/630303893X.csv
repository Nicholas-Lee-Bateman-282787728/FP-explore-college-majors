7835168,5,630303893X,"A black voodoo priestess comes out of the Louisiana swamps to take revenge on the white plantation owner she believes killed her husband.

This was produced by some small independent company called Pinnacle. It's a production company that distributed a handful of these plantation movies in the 20s and 30s. Some other reviewer here who obviously has an ax to grind, claims the black actors are played by white people.

He probably thinks the Amos & Andy TV show featured white actors in blackface too. To be fair, there are two characters who are supposed to be black but are white.

The title character, Chloe is supposed to be of mixed race and she is played by a famous silent film star. This is her last picture. Her star had dimmed and she wound up first joining the army (WACS) after this film and years later was found scrubbing floors for a living. In 1947, at the age of 40, she died of a ""stomach ailment"" at the Sunshine Mission - a home for destitute women on Los Angeles' Skid Row.

One of her two love interests is white too, playing a black man.

If you really examine the film, the white characters are all stereotypes -- rich, sauntering around in white suits drinking frilly drinks talking about their deals. While a few others are working class with hillbilly accents. The black characters are largely silent and working plantation. Except for the voodoo priestess who has a fair amount of dialog. This women was up for the role of Mammy in Gone with the Wind.

What I'm saying is this: the film is far more complicated than just a knee jerk response of saying all the blacks are stereotypes. Everybody in this movie is a stereo type of some sort.

And casting a white actress (probably because she was a real star at one time, hence an audience draw) would make it hard back then to cast a true black man as a romantic interest. Conversely, how could they cast a black actress with a white love interest in 1934?

To a degree you can almost make the case that this movie is an allegory for the unfairness of race relations. In today's world of political correctness I suppose few are willing to look beyond a kool-aide drinking response to the content of the movie.

Chloe and white Reed fall in love because of what's inside, not because of race or wealth or anything else.

So is it a good movie? To be honest, the available prints are bad. The focus is off and the sound is poor, so it's a wee bit difficult to follow the story. At some point we find out that Chloe is actually the colonel's lost daughter who disappeared at birth. But the Colonel welcomes her with open arms, and that's likely not to happen if she was half black in those times.

The women in the film are the ones to question whether or not Chloe is really the colonel's daughter, saying ""she's so dark."" Again a comment on racist mindsets and small minded people.

I found the movie to be very watchable despite to poor print quality. I think it deserves a new look, perhaps with a complete print.

Some reviewers have said it's typical that the white man comes out on top in this movie, but the real moral of the movie is that love comes out on top.

If you have an open mind and are sick of people with an agenda, take a look at this movie. It's not a great film, but it's an interesting curio piece that probably deserves to be restored.",1524787200,,3334,4.408794788273616
7835169,4,630303893X,"Olive Borden was one of the most beautiful and successful actresses of the 1920s. Unfortunately by 1934 her career was ruined by salary demands and a bad reputation. Chloe, Love is Calling would be Olive's final film. It's a low-budget movie set in the Southern swamps. Olive plays Chloe, the light skinned daughter of a voodoo priestess. Unfortunately the plot has a lot of racist elements and most people give this movie bad reviews. I thought it was an interesting story and I enjoyed seeing Olive (although this is certainly not her best performance). An interesting piece of trivia is that Olive was dating the director of this film Marshall Neilan. If you're a fan of Olive Borden it's definitely worth your time to watch Chloe. Also you don't have to buy it here - it's a public domain film and can be seen for free on You Tube or the Internet Archive. Sadly Olive died penniless in 1947 at the young age of 41.",1409356800,2,918,4.569696969696969
7835170,2,630303893X,"Unfortunately for fans of the silent films HALLELUJAH and 3 BAD MEN, this isn't more but much less. There's little to say that isn't already said by the previous reviewers: poor photography, poor sound, mediocre-to-OK acting besides the principals.

Everyone involved deserved better -- but better costs a lot more money. Therefore the main value is historicity, plus the chance to see Nina Mae McKinney and Olive Borden once more. Then go back to HALLELUJAH and 3 BAD MEN and think, ""Well, at least they got to make these *good* films before they ended up in CHLOE and THE DEVIL'S DAUGHTER""",1331596800,,591,4.851485148514851
7835171,2,630303893X,The story line is simplistic as most were in this era.  The significance of this tape is the study of early Black cinema and a look at the pioneering Black actors.,1199664000,,163,4.258064516129032
7835172,3,630303893X,"This was a independent film production as you can see and you will see when you watch the film the filming isn't really good and its not glorius black and white like in Hollywood, but that was the disadvantage of of independent films, they wasn't as good as Hollywood, but you can still understand the story. They showed these and made these movies around the Chitlin Circuit where they made black films, and showed these black films around in Europe or around different black cities, but these black films still exist, but a lot of them are lost. This is an all black cast with a white male as a love interest. Nina Mae McKinney stars in this film and her acting is always great you can see a little bit of Chick(the starring role she played in the classic black musical Hallelujah.) in her in this film. Nina Mae deserve better then this, but as you can see she carries the movie, and she kind of overacts in this film, she's too good for this picture, they should of gotten a unknown. But its worth a watch if your a Nina Mae McKinney fan.",1021248000,2,1042,4.348717948717948
