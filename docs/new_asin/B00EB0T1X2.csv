8603395,2,B00EB0T1X2,The subtitles were wayyyyy off.,1414627200,3,31,5.4
8603396,2,B00EB0T1X2,"A sad decline from Season 1 (which rates 5 stars):

1. The approach has changed - from a seriously noir atmosphere to a style hovering somewhere between farce and not particularly intelligent thriller
2. The female lead has, sadly, been replaced. Instead of a sombre, thoughtful officer we now have a shrill, superficial, essentially unsympathetic character.
3. Professor Yukawa's idiosyncrasies(especially that furious scribbling on whatever surface comes to hand - but nether pen on paper) have by now become even more tiresome, as they overemphasis the farcical approach so prevalent in this series.

Stick with Season 1.",1411430400,3,624,5.422680412371134
8603397,5,B00EB0T1X2,"I love the combination of police detective work, scientific insight, clash of genders and, last but not least, the fascinating backgrounds of Japanese cities and cultures. I find this much more interesting than NCIS.
cons: the subtitles are in a broken English that, on some occasions, require creativity to understand.",1401062400,3,319,5.4
