8147464,1,B000IU32N4,I bought this dvd because the info said that it had in it the coverage of Charter Hospital leading you to believe that it is the story they aired on tv.  Not at all.  I watched the entire dvd and they showed a 5 second segment on the hospital and not the 20-30 minute segment they aired on tv.  That is why I gave it 1-star.  The info is very misleading!  A waste of money!,1167955200,,373,3.92
