8253739,4,B000A2WPQA,An energized and passionate performance by one of rock's greatest voices in the latter half of his professional career.,1470182400,,119,5.315789473684211
8253740,5,B000A2WPQA,"If you are looking for the Lazy Sunday,Itchycoo Park pop sound of the Small Faces then this dvd is not for you. You should check out the British Invasion series  Small Faces All Or Nothing dvd. But if you are into blues sung & performed at a very high standard then buy this dvd. Steve Marriott sings his heart out & plays guitar like never before. I have everything available on dvd by the Small Faces & Steve Marriott Live in London is by far the superior performance. Steve is doing what he loves & it shows. For someone who claims not to be a very strong guitarist he blows me away. Steve was very modest(but rarely)so give this dvd a go,you won't be sorry.",1323734400,2,661,4.288
