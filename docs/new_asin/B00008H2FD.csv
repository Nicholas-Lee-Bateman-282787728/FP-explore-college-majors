7984048,3,B00008H2FD,"""Las poquianchis"" from 1976 and directed by Felipe Cazals (""Canoa"" 1976, ""El apando"" 1976, ""Las siete cucas"" 1981), was a gritty portrayal of real-life crimes that took place in the state of Guanajuato: between 1951 and 1964 (but they did not end there). This was the story of Delfina and Maria de Jesus Gonzalez, better known as ""las poquianchis"", two sisters, that ran a sadistic child-prostitution ring. The story was told in flashbacks (sometimes using B & W cinematography to good effect), and had a subplot involving dispossessed peasants (some of these peasants sold their daughters to ""las poquianchis""). The film had a solid cast: Diana Bracho, Malena Doria, Leonor Llausas, Jorge Martinez de Hoyos, Pilar Pellicer, Maria Rojo, Tina Romero, etc. There was a pervasively vicious and violent mood/atmosphere throughout the film that, did not let-up (Mexican society was the one really being depicted and put on trial in this film). The Mexican State, the Mexican Church (these sisters were supposedly good pious Catholics---because they donated time and money to the local Church-owned charities), and the intolerable social-conditions of the peasants were factors contributing to the complicity and responsibility in these heinous crimes, and still is today (think of the hundreds of murdered women along the Mexico/U.S. border). My only issue with the film: it wasn't objective in offering a clear and thorough explanation as to whom/what should bear the blame for these crimes (it can still be deduced). However, the seriousness and implications of these crimes, deserved more honesty and less subjectivity (I've seen this throughout Felipe Cazals work: i.e.---""Canoa""). For a film based on women who were sold into prostitution; there was a fair amount of violence committed by women against other women (without nudity), that was depicted in a detached matter-of-fact kind of way. I think nudity would have given the film a greater realistic-edge, especially in a film about exploited women. Did Mr. Cazals think that nudity in this case, would have lowered the film to the level of exploitation? He did feature female-nudity in ""El apando"" and ""Las siete cucas"". In any event, this is still an important and timely film from the 70's, that was ironically co-produced by the Mexican State film co. Conacine. The DVD quality by Brentwood was very good. NTSC, Spanish (no English subtitles), NR 110 mins.

Love and Peace,
