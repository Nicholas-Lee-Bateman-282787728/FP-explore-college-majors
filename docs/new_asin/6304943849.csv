It is simple and easy to follow. I recommend it to whoever is brushing up on the dances or beginning to learn the basic steps.",1007596800,23,302,3.6615384615384614
7879623,5,6304943849,"Executive summary:  A excellent basic ballroom dancing instruction tape.
Let's face it guys.  Girls like to dance.  Especially on cruises. Ok fine.  What's the best price/value for husbands to re-learn how to dance?  For me it's checking out cheap introductory ballroom dance classes at local dance schools, community colleges, park districts AND playing this video.  After each local newbie lesson my wife and I go back over the video lessons and practice our steps along with the tape.  Greg Gale carefully teaches all of the basic ballroom steps for gentlemen and ladies along with demonstrating proper arm positions.  The difference between the local lessions and the tape is that you can play the tape any number of times without the expense of a dance instructor.  For a little icing on the cake Greg and Nancy briefly demonstrate some jazzy moves just to wet your appetite, perhaps, for more advanced lessons.  All of the basic ballroom steps and turns on the video matched exactly what we have learned locally.  We did find that the swing music on the video was too fast for us.  No matter.  We can now cut a rug with a wicked foxtrot.
Greg and Nancy are very attractive.  The video setting is in, perhaps, an expensive older home, where you might expect to find a wedding reception.",975283200,20,1291,4.8090909090909095
