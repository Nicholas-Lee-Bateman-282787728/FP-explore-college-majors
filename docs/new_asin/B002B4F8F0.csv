8360660,5,B002B4F8F0,"I was in Rio de Janeiro for my Holydays and saw a billboard anouncing the Edguy show. I had never seen a video or show of this band but had heard about them and the Avantasia Project from Tobias Sammet.

As I`ve enjoyed Hard Rock and Heavy Metal for all my life, I called a friend and went to see the show.

The next day I boght ALL Edguy`s CDs.

The show is tha same recorded in So Paulo. Amazing. Astonishing. Great Hard'n'Heavy Thing.

I trully recommend. A must have if you are into strong music.",1362614400,,500,4.177083333333333
8360661,5,B002B4F8F0,"I have not personally seen edguy live and I haven't seen any other live material of theirs so I don't have anything to compare it too, but I was very happy with the performance they gave on this dvd and the quality is good too. Excellent set list and some nice extras all round this is a good dvd and a very good buy. Can't go wrong in my opinion.",1259452800,,347,3.9714285714285715
8360662,4,B002B4F8F0,"As a fan of these guys for most of the 00's it was with great pleasure that I heard there was going to be a live DVD of them in action. After all the double live album from a couple of years ago was pretty handy and I'd seen them level the place on two occasions in Australia at club dates and was really wanting to see what they might do on a bigger stage.

And the news isn't all good I'm afraid. Firstly the band don't have a lot of stage presence on this DVD. Perhaps it was a case of stagefright but there isn't a lot of X factor happening here. Toby seems to be suffering the effects of a long tour and actually looks strangely frail at times and his voice isn't projecting here as much as I've heard him do live in person. The stage show is fairly minimal and Tobys' between song banter isn't that flash. I know English is his second language but the fact is that the interviews in the special features section show he knows his banter is off key - so why keep on doing it?

The strength of the material saves this fourteen track live DVD because in ...Mandrake and Hellfire Club the band had put forth two absolute barnstorming albums and Rocket Ride wasn't exactly a slouch either. So a quick glimpse down the track list should be getting all their fans salivating. For me standouts were Tears of A Mandrake, Mysteria and King of Fools/Avantasia at the end are a pretty handy one/two punch. I've never really understood the thrill regarding Land of the Miracle and the title track of this release seems a bit of a lame duck despite the aura of naughtiness it has due to its title. But by and large the music sounds tight.

The special features of this disc are fairly handy. Video clips for King of Fools (weird), Lavatory Love Machine (way cool), Superheroes (how did they get away with that) and Ministry of Saints (not bad) really add to the value of the product as do the interviews which are all in German but thankfully subtitled for those of us not born in the land of the Brandenberg Gate. And really it's these two aspects of the release that seals the deal for me to take this to a four star release.

So if you are an Edguy fan get this but don't hock your soul for it. And before you pillory my review with negative votes of disagreement take this challenge. Watch the Angra gig that was done at the same venue. Then watch this. Nuff said.",1257897600,,2360,4.272930648769575
8360663,3,B002B4F8F0,"This should have been a better release. I enjoy it and I don't intend to resell it, but I got to call Edguy out on this. First, about half the songs on here (as well as on the CD version) appear on their 1st live CD 'Burning down the opera'. Having that CD, it almost makes this one not an essential purchase (That's why I opted only for the DVD). Second, too many songs are taken from Rocket Ride - not a bad thing if they would've picked the stronger songs, but that didn't happen. There are a few good moments, but based on what I've said before, there are better DVDs to get: Kamelot(Cold Winter), Nightwish (End, From here), Royal Hunt(2006). Sorry guys, hopefully there'll be another chance to do it right. Unfortunately as long as we had to wait for their first DVD, I'm afraid it won't happen any faster than Manowar will STOP releasing DVDs",1250985600,2,849,4.379746835443038
