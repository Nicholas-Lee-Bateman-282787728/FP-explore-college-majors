8025923,5,B0002CH8JM,"No, it is not five stars as compared to the best of Verdi, Mozart, et al.  It is an indication that someone who is not an expert in opera but likes the sound of the period enjoyed listening to it. There is no way that I can sit through a nearly three hour opera (even with taking an occasional break) so that I saw it over two nights. Since there is no great tension created as to how it will turn out or the fate of the various characters, doing so did not seek to detract, in any way, from my enjoyment.
Among the virtues was the fact that only a handful of performers were on-stage at any given time. This meant that there was no necessity for the TV camera to recede, diminishing thereby their size. Nearly all action is 'up front and personal'. For similar reasons, most of the time one is listening to one or two voices, with occasional trios, etc. The individual voices thus retain their distinctive flavor. (Not that chorus work is at all detrimental, but it is nice, occasionally, to hear each voice all the time without its having to compete with an overloud orchestra.) Those voices all sounded fine....no real occasion for them to engage in the pyrotechnics which (rightfully) elicits ohs and aas from the audience...but what we do get is a steady series of ear catching sounds in quite individualized manner.
Subtitles there were (else I would not have purchased the disc) but, as is often the case, the producer of the disc would not pay for them to be done where repetition was present. It is much better when we know that we are getting all the necessary words. Typically, I lost track of who was in love with whom, who was whose preferred lover, etc. etc...but in this kind of opera , I didn't much mind.
As I have said, all the singers were quite good, and had a chance to show it. The humor was opera humor but not at all bad, with the comic characters ( the men) handling their roles as dupes, fools, and sad sacks, very nicely. The women were suitably costumed to make the most of their male-eye-catching display. Not a bad idea at any time.
Yes, there was a key character male part played by a female. I have read about castrati and their availability for these parts until a surprisingly late date, but by know one would think that the parts would have been rewritten for an appropriate male voice. Of course, live, sitting up among the angels in the highest balcony of the New York City Opera house (renamed a few years ago, for a current donor), the difference was not particularly noticeable...but with a television camera filming, its time we added just that bit of reality to the dream world of opera.
As I have indicated, of course,  simply to hear music of this period, with its swinging melody, is always a joy for me...another reason for one to watch this piece, if you share this predilection.
So, for those who can still enjoy the ancient 'bedroom farce' scenario, have a taste for the style and can enjoy simple staging and limited scenery when it is the setting for a comedy in which you are almost there among the cast, this is a good buy, I imagine for opera fanciers and almost certainly to amateur viewers like me. Oh, yes, to repeat, the singers are well worth listening to as well.",1448668800,,3223,4.451776649746193
8025924,5,B0002CH8JM,"Lo Frate 'Nnamorato is Pergolesi's first comic opera. The music is fresh and enchanting throughout and the use of Neapolitan dialect adds pleasure. In particular, the aria with flute obbligato that opens the third act is stunning beautiful.

The musical performance is superb. The orchestra conducted by Fabio Biondi, plays with energy and enthusiasm. All the singers are wonderful.

The opera's plot was transferred to the 20th century, but it was done in a very graceful and effective way and looks completely natural.

Highly recommended !",1374192000,,542,5.27906976744186

8025926,4,B0002CH8JM,"Up until only a couple of years ago, Pergolesi reputation as an opera composer rested mainly on a few comedies and Intermezzi, most notably La Serva Padrona and Lo frate 'nnamorato.  Historically, these are important works that took opera away from the rigid formalism of traditional classical subjects, but they don't stand up as well now as some of the other works revived by Pergolesi-Spontini Foundation (most notably the composer's incomparable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-Olimpiade/dp/B00B5UBFK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L'Olimpiade</a>).  Lo frate 'nnamorato, one of Pergolesi's earliest works, now seems quite typical of the genre that he helped create.

There's a complicated web of romantic entanglements in the opera where everyone is in love with someone who doesn't love them, only for the situation to be resolved by late revelations about lost relatives, secret identities and unexplained mysterious backgrounds.  The difference here is of course is the humour and the social context.  Very little of the humour comes from the main characters, although Don Pietro is certainly a bit of a joker who likes to flirt with the maids and tries certain unconventional methods of romantic persuasion while the others just seem to prefer bemoaning the lot that fate has drawn for them.  It's actually the maids Vanella and Cardella however who are the real heart of the work, two ""serva padronas"" irreverently making fun of the self-indulgence, false hopes, illusions and self-deceptions of their masters.

Without the seemingly minor contributions of Vanella and Cardella, Lo frate 'nnamorato would indeed be a rather conventional account of characters in the throes of despair over the trials of unrequited love, but the work also gains from Pergolesi's musical arrangements, his inventive comic writing and the earthy character of the libretto's Neapolitan dialect.  That's given a fine account here in the 2011 production at Jesi by Fabio Biondi leading his Europa Galante ensemble on violin.  It's a small ensemble of about 12 musicians, but as such the precision playing is all the more evident, as is the inherent warmth and lyricism within the score itself.  It's a beautiful performance of the work.  Willy Landin's sets also provide an attractive setting, updating of the period to what looks like a provincial Italian village in the 1950s, beautifully lit and coloured with warm sepias, oranges and browns.  The stage directions however, although they try to keep the singers involved in some occupation, don't really succeed in making it come to life.

The singing on all the Pergolesi performances from Jesi so far has been of an exceptional standard, but their Lo frate 'nnamorato isn't the strongest.  The young cast however are all good, the voices fresh, lyrical and distinctive, particularly in the roles where it counts, but not all of them can handle the lyrical coloratura.  Patrizia Biccir's Nena is one of the best performers here and Elena Belfiore - the mezzo-soprano used for the Ascanio countertenor/castrato role - is also excellent.  The Act II trio between Ascanio, Nena and Nina ('Se 'l foco mio t' infiamma') is accordingly one of the highlights.  Fortunately, the maids Vanella and Cardella played by Laura Cherici and Rosa Bove are also both excellent, keeping the work vital and entertaining to such an extent that it drags a little when they are not on the stage.

Arthaus provide another quality BD release for Lo frate 'nnamorato.  The image quality is superb, clear with warm colouration, and the audio tracks capture all the detail of the musical arrangements and the singing.  The disc is a BD50, compatible for all regions.  Subtitles are in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish and Korean.  There are no extra features other than Trailers for the other Arthaus Pergolesi titles and a booklet with an essay on the work.  There is no synopsis, but the plot is covered briefly in the essay and there is a full track listing that helps initially identify all the characters.",1369612800,3,4075,5.293478260869565
8025927,3,B0002CH8JM,"Too late did I realize that this opera was baroque...which I really don't care for.  I find the music monotonous!  And, I would not normally review a baroque opera for that reason.  Let those who enjoy and appreciate it influence the rest.

BUT, I have to comment on the wonderful performance of Alessandro Corbelli as Marcaniello.  I love this guy!!!  He deserves an academy award for his singing and acting.  He was made to look like an old man with an artificial hooked nose, a ridiculous wig and a bad case of gout.  He was hilarious!  He's the only reason I watched the whole thing, which otherwise dragged on and on and on...every song sung four times at least.  (I kept thinking, ""Make it stop!"")

In all fairness, everything about this pastel production was first rate. The set, the costumes, the cast's singing and acting, and the music were good.  It was the opera itself that couldn't be saved.",1205884800,2,905,4.622641509433962
8025928,4,B0002CH8JM,"Charming music, and a work of theater that spawned a new genre: commedia musicale (not actually opera buffa). We are winding the clock back to 1732 here -- and we are in Italy, not the contrapuntal North of Hndel and Bach -- so expect thinner, softer textures and carefree melodic invention.

Bargain note: this Opus Arte issue is available in some areas as part of an 11-opera DVD collection, mostly from La Scala, Milan, at a price so low it may be a packaging error. Investigate.",1178409600,2,482,4.604651162790698
8025929,2,B0002CH8JM,"I first saw this production broadcast on television a few years ago, and thought that I was in for a treat. After all, a baroque opera of supposedly delicious comic frotheries... conducted by Riccardo Muti... I was sure that watching this opera would be a delight. Admittedly, I'd not heard the opera previously, so had no idea about whether the work itself was great, but as I'm a baroque opera lover, I expected to be enthralled and pleased.

The sets were fine. The costumes were fine. I supposed the look of everyone was fine. But... oh dear, it's the work itself that is the big let-down.

This is truly one of the few operas I can call ""tedious"". (I have three thousand operatic CD recordings, and countless opera DVDs, so I'm not speaking out of a dislike for the genre.) The camera work is a little odd - we see the camera swing away to Riccardo Muti far too often for the viewer to become immersed in the production - but this camera work does have the advantage that one can see the expression on Sr Muti's face.

How can I describe it? He looks as though he is being forced to eat rubbery fish, badly overcooked and without any disguising garnish. In a word... bored.

And it's evident in his conducting, too. The man is bored, and he conducts as though he's bored, as though the music bores him, the production bores him, and the entire evening bores him. I'm afraid I have to concur - the music was simply not up to the high standard of which Pergelosi was capable. It was filled with not-very-interesting melodies as the staple of each aria, each of which followed similar patterns. Not only was there this internal sense of repetition in the patterns, but the arias themselves were performed da capo without any saving grace by way of embellishments to make the repeat of the already over-familiar sound interesting, different, or exciting.

The cast did their best with this uninspiring material. None of the singers stood out as magnificent, but they were certainly better than the constraints under which they performed. I suspect it was Riccardo Muti who determined the limits of the da capo repeats, as he's notorious for not wishing the singers to add anything to the score as notated, but in baroque music, such embellishment is REQUIRED, not optional. Yet even had he permitted the singers to decorate their da capos, would it have enlivened this production?

I am forced to conclude: no. The work is simply not interesting...

For truly exciting baroque opera performances, there are many excellent Handel productions on DVD worth having (the Agrippina with Gens; the Lully operas now available (in spite of some peculiar staging at times); several of the Monteverdi operas; the really charming Vivaldi opera Orlando Furioso; and so on).

Not recommended except for diehard Pergolesi fans. I just couldn't bear to watch it again, I'm afraid.",1148428800,7,2865,4.762096774193548
8025930,5,B0002CH8JM,"Giovanni Battista Pergolesi (1710-1736) suffered both in life and in death. He died at the tender age of 26, and after his death the popularity of his second opera buffa (a form many believe he invented) led to wholesale publication of spurious works under his name which he, of course, could do nothing about. Then for almost two centuries these false works kept coming to light and it was said at one point that only one of his 'true' operatic works survived him, the one that made him famous, 'La Serva Padrona.' However, recent scholarship has assigned a number of other works to him, including this one, his first comic opera 'Lo Frate 'Nnamorato.' That title is in Neapolitan dialect and means 'The Brother in Love.' It has been incorrectly translated through the years as 'The Friar in Love.' There is no friar anywhere to be seen in the opera, but there is a 'brother' named Ascanio (sung, as it happens, originally by a castrato and here sung marvelously by soprano Nuccia Focile). It develops (in the last act, of course) that he is the long-lost brother of two sisters, Nina and Nena, whom he loves (as well as loving another woman named Luggrezia [Neapolitan for 'Lucrezia']; talk about a confused young man!) and thus to the relief of all concerned, him not least, his 'love' for Nina and Nena turns out to be only 'brotherly' not, ahem, romantic. Whew! And thereon turns the whole comedy of this delightful opera. Well, there's also the aged rou&eacute; in love with a young girl, and a silly and pretentious fellow who is also in love with a young girl, servants who are smarter than their masters and ... you get the idea. This is not 'Hamlet,' folks, nor even 'Cos&iacute; fan tutte.' But it is all good fun and the music is terrific.

The opera was premi&egrave;red in 1732 and enjoyed a brief popularity. Then it was 'lost' until found again thirty years or so ago. Riccardo Muti, the conductor of this performance, was instrumental in bringing it to the stage and this 1989 La Scala production was its first in more than 200 years. Muti brings brio and tenderness to the score and it is hard to imagine a more effective musical presentation. The singers, most of them unknown to me, are simply wonderful. The opera has a large cast and every single one of them has at least one aria. And with the exception of a bit of disappointment in Amelia Felle's performance of Nena's bravura aria with flute obbligato that opens Act III, 'Va solcando il mar d'amore,' there are no disappointments. This is an early work by Pergolesi--well, considering he died so young, I guess they're all early works, but his style did develop considerably over the eight years or so that he was writing--and most of the arias have a folk-song quality to them. This also means that the hummable quality we know from Italian folk music is present here in quantity. Some of you, even if you've never heard the opera before, will be surprised and pleased to recognize the first aria, 'Pupillette, fiammette d'amore,' sung by one of the suitors, Don Pietro, because it was used prominently in Stravinsky's ballet based on (mostly) Pergolesi tunes, 'Pulcinella.'

This is, of course, a late baroque opera and as such features ritornello arias, and I will admit that sometimes I groaned when a long aria seemingly started all over again with the first section repeat. There is no chorus and the recitatives are brief, so the opera comes across as a string of arias. There are a few duets, one trio and the finales of the second and third acts are quintets.

The mise en sc&egrave;ne is a single set, a stylized pair of palazzos, side by side, on a turntable. Sets and costumes tend to be pastel--tans, soft yellows, greens, pinks all lit softly but clearly. Quite attractive, I thought.

I was very happy to make the acquaintance of this opera, not only because it documents an important phase in development of opera as an art form (and clearly a forerunner of Mozart and Rossini) but because it was so darned enjoyable.

8025931,5,B0002CH8JM,"This 3 hour opera purports to be 100% Pergolesi.  I wouldn't want to have to swear to that, but certainly the music is quite nice and is baroque with a few classical touches.  R. Muti conducts a portion of the La Scala orchestra along with arch lutes, theorbos, and harpsichord.  The playing is very good, though the string sound is more what I expect of a more modern period.  I won't list all the singers, none of whom I recognize except for the Marcaniello (Alessandro Corbelli).  There are 6 almost equally important soprano roles and each is sung extremely well.  Several of the sopranos are so good that you can only wish the opera were longer so that you could here more.  The male roles are well sung and the Marcaniello is excellent for the comic old codger role.  While the plot is inconsequential, the comedy is very well done.",998438400,18,838,4.54
