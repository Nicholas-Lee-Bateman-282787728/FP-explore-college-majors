6667197,3,B00NLZA7MW,"They aren't the men that you would expect to fly through the air or give you a what would be considered a ""mat wrestling classic"" but these are men who were attractions based off their freakish size in regards to either their height or weight that they got your attention the moment you saw them & often performed offense that you just knew was powerful & such impact that it made a lasting impression...these are the true giants of professional wrestling/sports entertainment. This documentary is the format where you get mini profiles on each individual with one specific person talking about the profiled individual weather it's the superstar himself (Big Show, One Man Gang, Kevin Nash, Ernie Ladd, Mark Henry, Sid Vicious, Vader) or other personalities speaking on an individual (Pat Patterson, Bill Apter, Harvey Whippleman, Ken Patera, Hillbilly Jim, The Usos, Ranjin Singh, Tim White).

Here are some highlights from the profiles on this DVD:

""MSG"" Mar. '76

Gorilla Monsoon vs. WWE Champion Billy Graham - Billy Graham usually has the power & strength to his advantage going into a match but that wasn't the case here as Gorilla dominated early on with the giant swing & a big splash all in the opening minute while continuing to overpower & catch Graham in holds like a bearhug causing him to take away the power advantage by pounding Monsoon down & working over the back with a bearhug various times including one that he didn't let go of despite falling out of the ring to the outside in a solid ""power vs. power"" match.
""MSG"" May '77

Haystacks Calhoun vs. Nikolai Volkoff - This was a very short match with Volkoff repeatedly trying to pound on Haystacks only for Haystacks to use his superior weight advantage to squash him on more than one occasion.
Mar. '78

American Heavyweight Champion Ernie Ladd vs. Kerry Von Erich - Kerry was able to keep getting the advantage on Ladd early on grounding him working over the legs & delivering offense such as a dropkick from a sitting position & coming off the top rope on more than one occasion causing Ladd to keep using his size to his advantage easily reaching the ropes to keep breaking Kerry's offense while resorting to such dirty tactics whenever possible like reaching into the tights for an object along with choking with his hands & the ropes causing Kerry to fight fire with fire using Ladd's own tactics & even body against him.
""WCCW Star Wars"" June '81

Andre The Giant, Dusty Rhodes, Junkyard Dog vs. Wild Samoans & Ernie Ladd - This was a dream match voted on by the fans that turned out to be a very fun match that saw the babyfaces take control, heels to work the strategy of attempting to isolate & triple team one member, and eventually all six men brawling at the same time.
""Mid-South Wrestling"" Jan. '82
[Legends Of Mid-South Wrestling; Mid South Wrestling: Giants, Midgets, Heroes & Villians]

King Kong Bundy vs. Dusty Rhodes - This was a very short match that saw Bundy rely on his big power strikes to keep taking Dusty down & strength to ware him down like a bearhug while Dusty had some power strikes of his own such as delievering the elbow to the head so many times that Bundy started to bleed.
""Mid-South Wrestling"" Sept. '83

Big John Studd vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - It was during this time that Studd & his manager Bobby Heenan had an open challenge where they would pay money to whoever would be able to bodyslam Big John Studd. Hogan was in control early in the match with forearm strikes in the corner only for Studd to take advantage of Hogan being unable to slam him heavily working over the back with various strikes, back breaker, bearhug, and a hard forearm that sent Hogan to the outside where he was eventually busted open which Hogan into a complete rage at the sight of it. This was your typical Hogan performance against ""giants"" where he was on the defense more than offense building to the big comeback but have to give credit to both men in telling the story of working over the back.
""MSG"" Sept. '84
[Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology]

Steel Cage Match: Kamala vs. Andre The Giant - The only way to win this match was to escape the cage while it should be noted that Andre was as tall of the cage to the point where he had to bend over just to get through the door as he started attacking right away with headbutts while Kamala kept chopping Andre down as the cage did come into play as a weapon to eventually cause someone's head to bleed with both men using their weight advantage more than once to splash the other men including one moment that was so memorable that it was seen in the beginning of Coliseum Video presentations for years afterwords.
""Maple Leaf Gardens"" Oct. '84

One Man Gang vs. Shawn Michaels - One of Shawn's early matches but nothing more than him playing the ""jobber"" as One Man Gang squashed him.
""World Class Championship Wrestling"" Jan. '85
[Shawn Michaels: My Journey]

King Kong Bundy & Big John Studd vs. British Bulldogs - Studd & Bundy used their superior size advantage on each individual causing the Bulldogs to resort to their double team maneuvers & superior speed in order to regain the advantage taking their opponents down causing Studd & Bundy to isolate one member of the team from their partner using their superior power with strong blows & power moves to retain their advantage in what was a ""power vs. speed"" match.
""Championship Wrestling"" May '86

UWF Champion One Man Gang vs. Ted DiBiase - Dibiase came out aggressive with hard whips in the corner & strikes including chopping Gang off his feet only for Gang to return the big strikes himself along with using power moves & having no issues when it came to using illegal tactics as they traded momentum with Gang attempting to big impactful offensive moves such as the 747 splash & Avalanche in the corner while Dibiase kept avoiding them as it came down to another presence at ringside being the deciding factor in this match.
""UWF Power Pro Wrestling"" Nov. '86

Andre The Giant vs. WWE Champion Randy Savage - The referee made a decision early on to ensure Savage didn't have an additional distraction from the outside which only angered Andre was the heavily worked Savage over the corner & on the ropes with big blows & chokes only for Savage to return the favor when he was able to get Andre in a compromising position both in & outside of the ring only for the action to get out of control with one man turning his focus on more than one innocent person.
""MSG"" Sept. '88
[Legends Of Wrestling: Andre The Giant & Iron Sheik]

El Gigante vs. One Man Gang - Kevin Sullivan was in Gang's corner while Gigante came to the ring with midgets as Gang kept attempting to go head on against him to no effect only for Gang to use illegal tactics to get the advantage working over Gigante's legs while Gigante was able to use his size & power advantage along with one of Gang's tactics against him.
WCW Great American Bash '91

Sid Justice & Ric Flair vs. Hulk Hogan & Roddy Piper - Flair attempted to play mind games only to get slapped off his feet as both men exchanged chops & strikes against each other with even Hogan getting in shots as well before Sid was able to take control for his team with his superior power heavily working over Hogan's back while using illegal objects on both opponents as Flair & Sid used the strategy of divide & conquer while distracting the referee whenever possible before things eventually got out of control with all four men.
Feb. '92

Yokozuna vs. Earthquake - This started out in as the ""the unstoppable force vs. the immovable object"" as both men had stalemates when colliding with each other only for Quake to be able to knock Yokozuna down to one knee before Yokozuna was able to knock Quake down & use his weight amongst other things to keep him down in a quick encounter.
Jan. '93

Yokozuna vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - After that ending to WrestleMania IX, this was the rematch. If this wasn't Hogan's last WWF match for almost a decade, it wouldn't have been very memorable as the match never seemed to move out of first gear & was the stereotypical Hogan performance of being dominated before ""Hulking Up"" & making his comeback in the end but I'll give Hogan credit in the fact that he heavily sold for Yokozuna just based on his facial expressions throughout the match & the fact that he didn't slam Yokozuna. The ending was crap but in the end, Yokozuna regained the WWF Title & Hulk Hogan left the WWF to not be seen again until 2002.
King Of The Ring '93
[Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 90's; Best Of King Of The Ring]

Rest In Peace Match: Giant Gonzales vs. Undertaker - This was a glorified ""No Disqualification"" match as it should be noted that Harvey Whippleman had the urn with him at ringside as Gonzales used his superior size with headbutts & strikes in the ring along with whatever weapon around ringside while Taker attempted to go head up against the Gonzales to keep knocking him down either from the ground or over the top with the bigger story of who decided to return & make the biggest impact of the match.
SummerSlam '93

Diesel vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon - This match happened a little while after the classic ladder match between Shawn Michaels & Razor Ramon at WrestleMania as it was time for Shawn's bodyguard, Diesel, to attempt to gain the Intercontinental Championship. Razor came out very aggressive while Diesel used his power & size to his advantage. There were times where Razor was able to counteract Diesel's size like a top rope bulldog but in the end, numbers amongst other things caught up to Razor as Diesel would go on to win his first championship. This was more of a teaser for their upcoming SummerSlam match than anything else but a very good match for the ""Superstars"" show at that time.
""Superstars"" Apr. '94
[Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 90's]

Vader vs. Ric Flair & Arn Anderson - Vader showcased his superior power advantage early sending Anderson over the top rope & punching him down only for Anderson to hit a big offensive move allowing Flair to tag in attempting to pick the bones only for Vader to keep using his power to regain the advantage causing both men to resort to various types of double teaming to take Vader off his feet in what was a short match that was more about the story between Flair & Anderson in weather they were a team or just one man hiding behind the other.
""WCW Clash of the Champions"" Aug. '95

Diesel vs. Isaac Yankem, D.D.S. - Diesel came out working over Yankem in the corner & with his power moves like a side slam before Yankem was able to take control punching Diesel down & keeping him there while attempting high risk moves like a top rope legdrop along with Jerry Lawler got involved whenever the referee wasn't looking on the outside with Diesel attempting to fight back in what was an average big man match but nothing special past the irony of what would happened between both men & the ""Diesel"" character almost a year later.
""Superstars"" Jan. '96

Sycho Sid vs. WWE Champion Bret Hart - This was the third attempt to have this match during the show as both men had the same strategy in mind as they were working each other over in the corner & heavily focusing on the back area with strong strikes such as headbutts & backbreakers before Bret focused on the legs including stretching the limits of a disqualification while Sid used his superior power & showing some agility of his own with various legdrops as they traded momentum with one man who had been a thorn in both of their sides throughout the night made his present felt once again.
""RAW"" Feb. '97

Big Show vs. Hardcore Champion Rhyno - Both men started fighting on the floor right away with Show using his superior size to his advantage around ringside & on the ramp only for Rhino to take advantage of a mistiming heavily focusing on a part of his body using the ringside environment & any weapon he could get his hands on as this match literally came down to one man delivering one impactful shot & move after another using the weapons to their advantage.
""RAW"" May '01
[WWF Hardcore]

Big Show vs. WWE United States Champion Eddie Guerrero - Eddie came into this match more serious than he usually is to the point where he didn't even drive a low rider into the area as his back was bandaged & scarred from an attack Big Show delivered to him on SmackDown earlier in the week as Eddie attempted to ""hit & move"" only for Show to be able to catch Eddie & heavily focusing on the back by pounding on it & putting all his weight on the back even throwing Eddie into different parts of the ring more than once while Eddie started resorting to his ""lie, cheat, steal"" tactics along with going aerial to try to take Show down in a match that followed the ""David vs. Goliath"" formula but played out well.
No Mercy '03
[Big Show: A Giant's World]

Mark Henry vs. Rey Mysterio - This was to determine who would have Kurt Angle for the World Championship at the upcoming Royal Rumble as Rey used the ""hit & move"" strategy taking advantage of his speed with moves like a suicide dive & multiple 619's to different areas of the body focusing on the legs while Henry had the superior strength to stop Mysterio dead in his tracks various times slowing the pace down & just easily overpowering Rey throughout the contest in another solid ""David vs. Goliath"" encounter.
""SmackDown"" Jan. '06

No Disqualification Match: Great Khali vs. Shawn Michaels - This was to determine who would face WWE Champion John Cena at the upcoming Judgment Day PPV as Shawn attempted to take down Khali with physical force to avail causing him to take advantage of the stipulation using whatever he could get his hands on & using tactics that would normally cause a disqualification while trying to use leverage & body weight to his advantage only for Khali to keep chopping HBK down & tossing his body around before one man was on the receiving end of one huge move that he couldn't recover from.
""RAW"" May '07

Monster Mash Battle Royal: Mark Henry vs. Big Daddy V vs. Kane vs. Great Khali - This match was held under battle royal rules with four of the biggest men in WWE competing against each other on a special Halloween episode that featured such highlights as the one man who was singled out in the opening seconds, Mark Henry's showcase of strength, Big Daddy V's weight advantage, and the unlikely alliances formed in what was a quick encounter and quite the visual with all four men next in the ring together.
""ECW On Sci-Fi"" Oct. '07

Body Slam Challenge: Mark Henry vs. Big Show - Both men were scheduled to face each other with their partners at the upcoming Breaking Point PPV for the Unified Tag Team Championship but met here with the winner being the first man to bodyslam his opponent as each man's early attempts didn't work as they came close taking the other off balance & one foot with one man being able to mount an offense against a part of the body that would effect the ability to slam in a match that was good for what it was.
""RAW"" Sept. '09
[Best Of RAW 2009]

(Blu-Ray) Kamala vs. AWA Champion Rick Martel - Larry Zbyszko was in Kamala's corner as Martel used his speed advantage to get the advantage avoiding Kamala's attacks & executing offense of his own focusing on a specific body part to take out his size advantage while Kamala continued to attack the chest area of Martel in a match that went back & forth that eventually couldn't be contained between just these two men.
""AWA ESPN Championship Wrestling"" Oct. '85

(Blu-Ray) Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Big Boss Man - Two of WWE's two biggest competitors faced off here as Bigelow attacked from behind & heavily pounded on the back area while Boss Man focused on the head area with repeated punches as they traded momentum with Boss Man's back continuing to be targeted with strikes & power such as a bearhug to the point where it hurt Boss Man to execute his own offense resulting in a good back & forth match between two big men telling a story about focusing on a specific body part.
Royal Rumble '93

(Blu-Ray) Earthquake vs. Hulk Hogan - Earthquake jumped Hogan when he entered the ring to attempt to get the quick advantage only for Hogan to come right back with with his trademark punches & big boot only for Quake to take advantage when Hogan made an irrational move to heavily work over his back from big blows to submissions to the point where you saw it effect Hogan when he attempted various offense in what was one of their better encounters.
""MSG"" Nov. '90

Additional Blu-Ray matches include Abdullah The Butcher vs. Skip Young (""WCCW"" June '86) & the Natural Disasters WWE Tag Team Championship win vs. Money Inc. (July '92) while other Blu-Ray extras include bonus profiles on Earthquake, Abdullah The Butcher, Kamala, and Bam Bam Bigelow along with looking a paintings done by Rob Schamberger.

This is one of those presentations where you had to know what you were expecting going in so if your expecting the type of action you would get from smaller & more diverse athletes then your watching the wrong DVD set but knowing that, I would have liked a better match selection for some of the selected superstars while other ""big men"" were left off that I felt were better to pick but I'm glad that people like Vader & Sid got their respect that's been lacking in previous DVD sets. In the end, this was a presentation that you got what you expected so it's something I would get if your a fan of the bigger giant men of wrestling.",1421280000,7,19984,4.592706872370266
6667198,5,B00NLZA7MW,One of my new favorite wrestling DVDs. Love seeing the big guys finally get their own DVD and credit. Hope they do more of these colossal classics.,1419552000,,147,4.481481481481482
6667199,4,B00NLZA7MW,"Look...if you're expecting five-star matches and that sort of thing, it's not on this DVD set.  What you're getting with TRUE GIANTS is a look at the wrestlers who were seen as ""attractions"" to inspire awe, fear, and wonderment into the crowd and the show.  If you go into it with that mindset, then it is a good trip down the proverbial Memory Lane.

I like how each of the guys gets a spotlight vignette.  The format is similar to the Top Stars of the '80s and Top Stars of the '90s sets where a guy who might not have been a big enough star to have a DVD set dedicated to himself was featured.  If you are not an old guy (like yours truly) or a long-time fan, these featurettes are perfect introductions.

Regarding the match selection, well, what can you expect.  I would have loved to see one of those classic Vader-kicking-ass matches from the early to mid-90s but as you know, we can't always have nice things.  If I was in charge of this, there'd be a couple of those matches on there.  Maybe one jobber demolition match from WCW Sat Night and one of those classic Sting bouts.

I was happy to see Kamala and the One Man Gang get their just due.  Both were great gimmick performers who were deceptively agile for their sizes and in the case of the Gang, a personal favorite from the UWF, World Class, and WCW.",1419206400,,1317,4.313008130081301

They all have way better matches than what was shown. But to be fair, I wasn't really expecting much from the giants. If I want great wrestling, I'll watch Hart, Hennig, or Michaels.

In a world already populated by larger than life stars, the giants of professional wrestling stagger the minds of wrestling fans everywhere. Now, WWE Home Video looks back at some of the greatest big men in the sport in its new video release True Giants. The nearly two hour documentary features fifteen of the business big men including the Big Show, Gorilla Monsoon, One Man Gang, Haystacks Calhoun, Giant Gonzales, Big John Studd, Kevin Nash, Ernie Ladd, Mark Henry, King Kong Bundy, Psycho Sid, Vader, Yokozuna, the Great Khali, and of course Andre the Giant. The Blu-Ray includes four more profiles, this time covering Earthquake, Abdullah the Butcher, Kamala, and Bam Bam Bigelow. Conspicuous by their absence are big men Bruiser Brody (who is seen in a clip fighting Abdullah the Butcher) and Don Leo Jonathan (who had epic matches against a young Andre the Giant at the Quebecs legendary Montreal Forum back when Andre was still billed as Jean Ferre). In addition to the documentary, the video features many matches featuring the aforementioned stars.
True Giants has a short feature on each the wrestlers, similar to products like Greatest Wrestling Stars of the 80s and Greatest Wrestling Stars of the 90s. Each feature typically shows how each wrestler broke into the business, what the wrestlers were best known for, and some of the highlights of their careers. Even though the features are short, they are entertaining and I even discovered a few things about the wrestlers that I hadnt known before. For example, I didn't know that Vaders run in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) short-circuited because his agent said he was clear to work before hed healed fully from a shoulder surgery. Another interesting tidbit was how wrestler Steve Lombardi played Kamalas masked handler Kim Chee and how Kamala insisted that Lombardi drive him around with his Kim Chee mask on in order to maintain kayfabe.
After watching the documentary, I remembered how important all of these stars were in the industry and what important contributions they made to the business. Every wrestler left their mark on the business with currently active ones still impacting the industry. The fact that each of these men could find work wherever they wanted to during the territory days represents how in demand they were. The impact subsequent stars made by their many appearances at Wrestlemania (including headlining several Wrestlemanias) highlights the drawing power of big men.
One of the most interesting things about the video is how good many of these stars were in the ring. While one would think that stars of this size might be clods who relied on size and strength to get themselves over, many of them were talented wrestlers and/or developed a style that worked to their advantage. Some, like Bam Bam Bigelow are simply amazing when you see them doing moonsaults as effortlessly as a light heavyweight. Others, like Ernie Ladd oozed charisma and could have got by on mic skills alone.
Each feature is narrated by the wrestlers themselves or by someone close to them. Its really interesting to hear some of the wrestling personalities discuss their relationships with the wrestler being profiled. Manager Jimmy Mouth of the South covers the life and career of John Earthquake Tenta, recalling how he formed a close friendship with the Earthquake, traveling with him throughout the country and even staying at Earthquakes home when they were in Canada. It adds a personal touch to the wrestlers story. Another poignant story is that of Andre the Giant as told by WWF referee Tim White, a close friend who served as Andres assistant outside of the ring. White recalls the short but full life that Andre lived. He talks of some of the stories weve heard before about Andre such as his difficulty in getting around due to his size. Even more interesting is when he dispels some of the myths that weve heard about Andre. This particular piece really only scrapes the surface of Andres career which makes me wonder why the WWE hasn't released a video on the life of Andre the Giant. I don't think any theatrical film could do justice to Andres incredible life but a WWE documentary could be a fantastic product and have mainstream appeal whether it was released on home video or in the theatres.
While the video was well done, it did suffer from the lack of input from other WWE Superstars on how the giants influenced their careers. Most WWE videos feature a host of WWE Superstars commenting on angles and what wrestlers from yesteryear meant to their career. Sadly, this video lacks this for the most part.
One topic that wasn't really discussed was what makes a giant? While wrestlers like Andre, Ernie Ladd (who in reality was nearly as tall as Andre), Giant Gonzales, and the Big Show are easy to distinguish as giants, what makes Mark Henry, One Man Gang, and Kamala worthy of being included as a giant? Even more questionable is the selection of Abdullah the Butcher (who stands at 6, hardly giant-size unless you happen to be Hornswaggle) as a giant. It seems as if the video would have been better named Giants and Monsters or Giants and Big Men. Even then, why aren't big men such as Kane and the Undertaker mentioned?
Regardless of this oversight, the video is pretty good. You get to learn about a lot of different wrestlers and see them in action during their heyday. Keeping with company policy, the video is available in DVD or Blu-Ray with the Blu-Ray featuring four additional profiles and additional matches. Theres really no reason why the four additional profiles shouldnt have been included with the DVD but apparently the powers that be felt it might be enough incentive to get the Blu-Ray. Given the small difference in price, I don't know why anyone buys DVDs over Blu-Rays when a video is first released.",1436140800,3,5927,4.875123885034688
