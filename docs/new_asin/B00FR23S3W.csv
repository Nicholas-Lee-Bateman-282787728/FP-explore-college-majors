6023811,5,B00FR23S3W,"Scandal delivers exactly what its title promises. The story of Olivia Pope, madly in love with the married President Fitzgerald, is captivating from week to week as she navigates through deadly personal issues. The things going on between not only her and the president, but her and her father and the president are things of legend. Everything seems to connect back to everything else. Not only is the story rich with romance with erotic undertones to it, but also mixes in the suspense of political intrigue that shapes our country's leaders (USA). An edge of your seat watch, Scandal leaves you begging for more and more each time. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys espionage, romance, politics and legal dramas, as well as anyone who enjoys looking into the sometimes chaotic lives of the rich and powerful.",1387411200,43,821,4.913669064748201
6023812,5,B00FR23S3W,"The way this series is going, you'll need to invest in a defibrillator.  Scandal will have you on your feet screaming ""WHAT?!"" at your TV at the end of every episode.  The plot twists and turns are so ingenious that just when you think Shonda Rhimes can't possibly take it any further, she pulls out another trick that stops you dead in your tracks.  The acting continues to be excellent, with special mention to Kate Burton as the Jesus-freak Vice President Sally Langston and Joe Morton as the diabolical Rowan/Eli Pope.  I can't begin to imagine the direction in which Shonda Rhimes is taking this show, and I don't want to know.  All I'm looking forward to is being blown out of my shoes every Thursday night, and Shonda hasn't disappointed yet.

6023862,2,B00FR23S3W,"I know that this series is highly popular in the U.S. But I couldn't finish it. Too predictable and the acting was not nuanced or subtle, but more like being hit with a sledge hammer.

6023873,4,B00FR23S3W,"I love this show,but honestly...the sex scenes and on and off ""i love you's and I miss you's"" between Olivia and Fitz are getting boring as hell and so predictable. I like the twists and turns of the plot,but again,for me...each season rehashes the same storyline,just different costumes. I will continue to watch because it is entertaining...but I am no longer turned on or excited by the lame love scenes,and the eroticism of the sex scenes have lost their power to entice.(in my opinion only)",1449014400,,495,4.8352941176470585

6023882,1,B00FR23S3W,"If it's free, it's a great way to waste an evening. Sadly, the two leading characters are the least inspired and believable characters in the show--with many of the supporting cast members doing a much better job.

Kudos to ABC for intentionally including African-Americans in lead roles, but Kerry Washington as Olivia Pope (and her hideously collagen over-stuffed lips) is almost cartoonish in the two basic states she presents: either misty-eyed pouty little Daddiy's Girl on the verge of tears or shouting about things that really shouldn't be quite so alarming. Except for her fashion show runway strut, and the ability to make her over-processed hair bounce with every step, I have no idea why she is in the role. She could be the poster child for the current crop of narcissistic and demanding hipster and thug-wannabe types.

Season Three and Four have become gratuitous in their use of contrived sex scenes--the show qualifies in every regard as soft-core porn, and I suspect the writers have simply ran out of ideas and surrendered their craft to the masturbatory fantasies of post-pubescent teenage boys. It really is crude and contrived.",1442188800,,1149,5.074074074074074

6023976,1,B00FR23S3W,"Season One started with such great promise, Olivia pope was a strong outgoing character and just got things done, the relationship with Fitz did not seem that real, but could be overlooked as the storylines were leading the charge. Season Two became a little luke warm and the relationship between the 2 main characters became less believable every time they were on screen together, but the individual storylines kept the season going. Season Three needed to pull something out of the bag to get it back on track and sadly it did not deliver in any aspects. There are now numerous relationships going on between the regular cast members, some you can see that it might be possible, but the Olivia and Fitz has become SO ridiculous that I actually cringe when it's just those 2 characters on screen, these scenes are meant to be tense and they have absolutely NO emotion tied to them. The writers needs to pull their socks up and dispense with full focus on relationships across all characters and get back to where is started when Olivia led a team of gladiators and they jut got things done. I am truly disappointed with how this TV show has gone and I may even just skip season four.",1423180800,,1186,4.599056603773585

6024063,2,B00FR23S3W,"A huge fan of Scandal but  this season for me was hugely  dissapointing.

EVERYONE is having an affair  and why the presidant who runs the free world  cant make up his mind about Olivia  is ridiculous , its like a series of Dallas . The B613 plot , I lost it sorry  found in totally disinteresting . The programme should return to its roots about Olivias  work, the cases. The  love affair  between Fitz and Olivia  as just now plain tedious, worked in series 1 and 2  but in my opinion it is being dragged on and on and on and drags the programme down , thats unless the script writers s come up with some interesting story line to make us go wow , I never thought on that : > )",1415923200,,679,4.022556390977444

6024147,1,B00FR23S3W,"I will buy this DVD when it drops down to 9.99 or cheaper. Season 3 was a horrible. Storylines were all over the place. Nothing the characters said or did were consistent and B613 storyline can go straight to he'll in a homemade hand basket. What made it somewhat decent were the actors w/ the exception of Scott Foley. BY is a fine actress but I was not in no way shape or form here for the season of Mellie and lead being placed to side. If s4 is better, maybe I'll purchase that one.",1411430400,2,486,4.126315789473685

6024161,3,B00FR23S3W,"I am of two minds when it comes this season. From an entertainment perspective, it delivered with the plot twists and turns and there were some enjoyable moments. Some might say there were one too many.

And that is what leads to my issue with Season Three. A clear consistent and discernible plot with human characters was sorely missing. You no longer have a real attachment to any of the 'people' (they are all pretty horrible) and seem merely used as devices to deliver the OMG/hashtag moments. When I look at it as a continuum from Season One until the finale, the arc does not hold up. And for all the stuff going on, it feels like we ended up not really moving forward.

And the B613 storyline which dominated much of the season really did steal a lot of airtime from some other potentially exciting and interesting aspects of the show. And a lot is to be desired RE: the execution as well.

But as a form of disposable entertainment that fuels internet chatter and watercooler talk, it is perfectly fine. Which makes me a little sad, because I really wanted it a little more from the show when I got hooked in Season One.

I should also add that in spite of my reservations about the whole season, kudos go to most of the cast for trying through the force of their talent to bring a level of humanity to the characters.",1402272000,14,1327,4.426229508196721
