2159410,2,B00062IVMG,"Only let your young daughter watch this movie if it is ok to sneak out of the house at 14  years old, get in a friends car, play tricks on a rent a cop, set up a date on the internet, sneak into a night club, have drinks with her teacher, sneak into a boys house, watch him undres and then lie to her parents about the whole thing.

oh yes, the premise was shallow...

But... I did laugh.  The line ""for the love of carbs"" was priceless.",1098403200,8,437,3.9318181818181817

2159413,4,B00062IVMG,""" The Sleepover"" could be dismissed as a cut-rate version of ""Mean Girls"" except for several factors: the sparkling performances of Alexa Vega, Mika Boorem and Sean Faris and the introduction (at least for me) of the breaded and deep-fried Twinkie, which is served at the aforementioned sleepover. Yum.
Another positive factor of ""The Sleepover"" is that the writer was smart enough to steal the first lines of Elizabeth Berg's ""Never Change,"" even though Vega (as Julie) uses these words on an average looking girl who is guarding the door at a high school dance. And to quote Berg:
""You know people like me. I'm the one who sat on a folding chair out in the hall with a cigar box on my lap, selling tickets to the prom, but never going...I didn't get asked. I never once got asked, not to dances, not to movies not to parties...""
""The Sleepover"" is mild entertainment meant for the young and the young-at-heart, the junk food junkie and the Elizabeth Berg fan.",1089590400,7,961,4.658823529411765

2159443,5,B00062IVMG,"Watched this with our teenage daughter.  Great movie for her and us.  Deals with peer pressure, body image, bullying, and true friendships.  Good clean humor.  Wish more movies like this were made.  This movie doesn't have drug or alcohol use or girls dressed too revealing.  Love the scenes were the girls are at the sleepover just being girls:  dressing up their hair and makeup , dancing, and laughing.  I think this shows that young girls don't have to have boyfriends to be happy or feel complete.  Of course some of the characters do find boyfriends and those were just some of the ""awww"" moments of the movie.  Loved this movie for our daughter.",1478390400,3,652,4.6902654867256635

2159526,4,B00062IVMG,"Typical Highschool teen girl movie from the early 2,000s.
It's memory cannot die just like ""mean girls.""
But unlike mean girls... It's a bit more funny, perhaps it's because it shows the teen mentality real well for a 14(I think) year old girl and her friends that are just about to go into Highschool. 9th grade. Social pinicle of their lives ... :p",1470787200,,350,4.571428571428571

2159797,5,B00062IVMG,"I absolutely love this movie! I've been watching this movie off and on since high school I think. This movie tells of middle schoolers about to transition to high school who worry about who they are and who they will be in high school, so they compete with the stuck up popular girl group in a scavenger hunt. It is funny, clever, adventurous, romantic, cute, and will snag your attention for the entire time. The main character is a very relatable insecure high schooler who finds her confidence given the support of her friends. I highly recommend watching this movie for any occasion.

2159912,5,B00062IVMG,"I first saw this movie when I was a kid. It's a good movie. Personally I think it's a little better than most teen flicks. This for me is a something I watch at home because I played this movie with one of my new respite providers and at scenes with thongs, a drink called Sex on the Beach, and Steve getting undressed made her ask me if my mom lets me see this. (I skipped the getting undressed part.) I thought that if I want to show this, I can edit on I-movie, take out the 3-4 scenes the kids don't want to see or hear and that way, I wouldn't feel worried. You don't see the girls wearing thongs but you see them holding a pair. It feels like a kids movie and that's why I planned to get it in French & Italian. It's the same thing for the movie Big. They both feel like kid's movies.",1426636800,2,790,3.94375

I thought it was a little bit predictable / hokey but it was okay from a grown-ups perspective.  The girls were a little too ""boy crazy' at such a young age IMO.  Some one else described this movie as ""mean girls"" for the tween set, which is a great description. As an adult I thought ""Mean Girls"" was a lot funnier but of course, more adult humor in it compared to this movie.",1397433600,,465,4.043478260869565

You have a group of four girls having a sleepover, but are challenged by another group of snobbish girls to a scavenger hunt. Julie and Hannah leads up our group of pretty nice kids. They take the challenge. There is some action and adventure and risk. But being out done is out of the  And of course a little bit of teenage love.

2160143,5,B00062IVMG,"Sleepover is a nice and refreshing reprieve from the typical teenage flick that is often seen today. The movie may be a little dated as it was created in 2004, but it is still well worth the 90 minutes it takes it watch this movie. The story focuses on what everybody can relate to... the perils of entering high school. Even older generations can relate as throughout life we face many similar new experiences. It is so nice to see that a great movie can be made without the use of the usual sex and violence that plagues today's theaters. All in all, this is truly a feel good story about what really matters in life and that is friendship. You can see throughout the film that the bond between the girls as well as with the family get stronger as the movie progresses. With comedic elements throughout the movie, you will definitely end up smiling to yourself and laughing for much of the film. Some of the themes may be a little mature for the youngest viewers, but all in all this is a movie that the whole family can watch together and strengthen their bonds through. It's a shame there aren't more movies like this made in today's film industry.",1383264000,,1152,4.438679245283019

I usually lose interest in the first 20 minutes but this movie is unforgettable. True, it is a comedy but it had the ability to bring tears to the eyes more than once. Lively and funny, it brings back all the memories for us now beyond adolescence and gives the present day teenagers a chance to see that many are facing the same problems they are. Having a friend move away, crushes and unrequited love, being unaccepted, confused, invisible, chubby, feeling unattractive and yes, finding love in spite of it all. It even gives you a look into the lives of those who everyone thinks of as ""perfect"". Well life isn't perfect for anyone and sometimes, even the underdogs can get the prize!

It's a fun film with fun girls. The scavenger hunt is enjoyable and the girls car is cute. I didn't know that steve carell was the cop who was after the girls. He was really funny. It's an all age film with an obvious happy ending. Their are very good moments, especially the night club scene and the ending scene. Now that was funny. It's amamzing how now Alexa Vega was in ""Repo, the genetic opera"" and Sara Paxton was in ""the last house on the left"" remake. They both come a long way. yay.",1282262400,,670,4.083333333333333
2160511,2,B00062IVMG,"I admit, I enjoy my fair share of pre-teen or teen movie fluff, and some of them turn out to be far better than I could have hoped for.  To say that `Sleepover' isn't entertaining would be a lie, of sorts, but to say that it deserves the right to entertain you is another thing.  In fact, looking over `Sleepover' and trying to find reasons to applaud this movie was one of the most difficult tasks of my weekend.

I think I found ONE.

I'll start with that `reason'.  Kallie Flynn Childress.  As the overweight yet big-hearted Yancy, Childress proves to be the only actress here actually delivering a believably acted character.  You understand and relate to and simply adore her.  Her sub-plot is sweet (even if it is overloaded with clichs and improbabilities) and she is basically the only thing you will want to remember about this movie.

Sadly, that is about all in the `positive' department.

The concept behind this film is ridiculously thrown together.  The whole `girl gets dumped by guy so decides to humiliate her ex-friends by throwing together a scavenger hunt' is so unbelievable it made me roll my eyes.  The writers here didn't even TRY to make this work.  They probably just figured that a bunch of pre-teen girls wouldn't care if the film made any sense whatsoever, they'd watch it anyways.  The acting by everyone outside of Childress is also an issue.  I think that Sara Paxton is one of the worst young actresses TRYING to make it out there, and this is no exception.  Mika Boorem (who looks far too much like someone else) has spunk, but she doesn't no how to make it work for her.  She comes off manufactured.  Alexa Vega is rather boring, Steve Carell is generic slapstick and Sam Huntington looks like he desperately wants to be Nicolas Cage, and that is NOT a good thing.  Then you have Evan Peters who is just down right obnoxious to the point where it is nearly painful to watch him act.

Another issue that I have with this movie is that it makes appear fun things that I would NEVER want my daughter to ever find herself involved in, and it makes it seem `okay'.  The fact that one of the things on their `list' is to get a date from a website to buy them a drink at a nightclub is awful, and the fact that the mother finds out they were there and doesn't take any action (showing that she condones it) is ridiculous.  YOUR DAUGHTER IS FOURTEEN!  Stealing a boy's underwear (and the way that she does it) is all stuff that is not harmless fun, it is bordering on dangerous.  In fact, this is a major issue with me.  It would be different if the film gave some sort of consequence for their actions, but everything is presented as a `good time'.

I'm not sure why I'm giving this a D.  Maybe it's because I was slightly amused with the film.  Like I said, it's entertaining (what film of this nature isn't at least slightly entertaining), but it doesn't deserve to be seen.  It lacks a lot of everything needed to be considered a good film.",1276473600,7,2971,4.45
2160512,5,B00062IVMG,"This movie reminded me of a good old fashioned John Hughes film.  Kids acting like kids having good clean fun.  Family fun, how often can you say that?  Rent it!  Buy it!  Anyway, see it.",1249776000,,187,4.228571428571429

2160539,3,B00062IVMG,"""Sleepover"" is a four star flick--if you're thirteen.  I'm not saying that it's a bad film, it's just very, very demographically targeted at a specific audience.  The producers knew exactly what they were doing when they green-lighted this project.  It stars ""Spy Kids"" alum Alexa Vega, and ""Darcy's Wild Life"" and ""Aquamarine"" star Sara Paxton.  It also features Sam Huntington (""Jungle 2 Jungle,"" ""Superman Returns""), and pre-teen starlets Kallie Flynn Childress, Mika Boorem, and Scout Taylor-Compton.  The adult cast features a pre-""40 Year Old Virgin"" Steve Carell, fellow ""Virgin"" star Jane Lynch and ""Daddy Day Care"" star Jeff Garlin.

The plot revolves around a, you guessed it, sleepover, in which a jilted Paxton decides to gang up with her friends to challenge Vega and her brood to a scavenger hunt.  The prize in the balance is to either sit at the fountain during lunch or near the trash bins.  Sophomoric, I know, but it works perfectly in this little comedy.  The tasks in the hunt range from swiping a tag off of a rent-a-cop car to ""borrowing"" a pair of underwear from the apple of Vega's eye.

From there, the story becomes pretty formulaic.  The girls go from one task to another and achieve them with pre-teen humor in full force.  Carell fails horribly in his attempt to catch the girls in the act.  It all plays out like an expanded episode of ""Full House"" where D.J. and her pal Kimmy get into typical pre-teen sitcom trouble.  In the end it works as a pre-teen story, but most people older than fifteen will probably not care to watch it more than once.

Although it's a pretty good flick, I'd only consider buying it when my daughter hits the age of ten or eleven.  Even then, however, this movie would probably only warrant a four year shelf life before my daughter grew tired with it.  It's perfect for sleepovers, and coupled with Paxton's ""Aquamarine"" (which is actually pretty good), it's a guaranteed good time for young girls.",1161648000,36,1959,4.782738095238095
2160580,2,B00062IVMG,"There are movies that grow on you, and then there are movies that sort of...die.

Sleepover falls into the latter category. I must say that the first time I watched it I didn't think it was too bad. But then, I was about twelve years old, which means that I was immature, so naturally I would have enjoyed a movie as foolish as this one. A year later I re-watched it and realized that it's absolutely terrible.

As stated in other reviews, it's unrealistic, and the ""lessons"" it teaches are terrible. If you break into a hot guy's house, steal his boxers, and lock a police officer in a clothing display case, you'll magically become popular. That's exactly what the youth of today has to learn.

The acting is less than passable, too. Alexa Vega's character is less believable than Hilary Duff in Lizzie MaGuire, and Duff was pretty bad. The ""serious"" scenes they tried to slip into this movie almost made me break out laughter at how unbelievably ridiculous and contrived they were.

So if you absolutely have nothing to do, no friends, no hobbies, no computer, no other DVDs, and no money to go to Blockbuster, maybe you can waste a good chunk of your life watching this movie. Otherwise, don't bother.",1156550400,2,1205,4.616822429906542
2160581,2,B00062IVMG,"I was surprised that so many people childishly attacked the person who gave this movie one-star. Someone even accused them of not being young at heart. Well, I don't like this film, and I'm young at heart; I'm just not immature, so try not to confuse the two. Some of you need to check your spelling before accusing someone else of bad writing. Having said that, on to the film:

Julie and friends are simply DYING to be included in the in-crowd their first year of high school, so on the night Julie has a sleepover, they make a deal with some rival girls to go on a ""scavenger"" hunt, which is basically one huge dare game. The group that fulfills the dares first gets to be popular by... (drumroll, please) sitting at The Popular Lunch Spot. That is, a picnic bench by the school fountain. That's right; popularity is not guaranteed by WHO you sit with, but WHERE you sit. Pick the right spot, and you may just magically become Queen Bee for the rest of the year. In case you couldn't tell by my sarcasm, the shallow impracticality of this film truly bugs me at times. We all know the whole popularity thing is practically a tradition for teen chick-flicks, but this film tended to go over the top with a lot of it. Granted, a lot of the exaggerated silliness worked for the film; in fact, the movie's beginning surprised me with many clever and well-written clips. However, there is such a thing as going too far.

The movie becomes absolutely dedicated to making teen girls look like sassy but fashionably ingenuis bimbos and making teen boys look like...well, the dumbest, scruffiest beings that ever stumbled on the planet. Not that all the boys are like this, mind you; there are a few of the god-like types that the girls practically kill themselves for. It got worse, however, when the film attempted to fit in a few serious scenes. If the movie had stuck to pure sarcastic silliness the whole time, it might've worked. Instead,the few attempts to be serious usually fell flat on their faces because the seriousness went in the wrong direction. For example, there was the nauseating scene where poor beaten Julie nearly gives up her scavenger hunt and one of her friends says, ""Julie, I KNOW you can do this; I believe in you"" in a tone which implies that they're talking about a major life crisis instead of a juvenile daredevil game.

The worst ""serious"" scene, however, is when Julie attempts to get into a dance (therefore fulfilling the final dare) and the ticket seller won't let her in because she doesn't have a ticket. Suddenly inspired, Julie gives the ticket seller a sickening ""I know who you are"" speech, telling her that she knows she was a nerd her whole high school life and that now, because of her former nerdiness, she's become a poor ticket seller. Julie ends her speech by wailing, ""I can see myself being you in four years if I don't go to this dance!""  The ticket seller leaps to her feet but, instead of punching Julie, suddenly breaks into a smile and says, ""Go ahead and go in!"" Um, WHAT?? Whatever happened to the girls finding out that popularity isn't everything after all and actually getting lives and acting like humans? (Not to mention that nice sock in the mouth I was hoping Julie would get). Is this what we want to teach our kids, that being dedicated to work makes them nerds and that partying all the time will get them somewhere in life? I personally think the ""nerds"" are far better off than the girls who lose their virginity on the first date and party all year rather than learn anything. It was this scene and this message that seriously lowered the film in my opinion. I'm not sure why the filmmakers decided to end the film with this childish message. Maybe they did it on a dare because the popular filmmakers finally offered them a cool lunch spot in exchange. I recommend ""Never been Kissed"" and ""Mean Girls"" far more than this film; they have good moral lessons as well as intelligent humor.

Oh, before I finish, here's one more valuable lesson from this film: Girls, if you want to win a guy who's never noticed you, all you have to do is strike a cool pose, hop on a skateboard, and ride it directly in front of his car. (Don't forget to wear an expensive dress and look flawless while you're at it). Do this, and he will be so in love with you that he won't even care if you tell him that you did something freakish like stealing his underwear. The things we learn from movies, huh?",1149638400,8,4446,4.504337050805452
2160582,4,B00062IVMG,"One reviewer gave this movie 1 star and complained about continuity. This person is obviously not young at heart. For those of us who are, or those who are still young, you'll appreciate this rites of passage movie. The reviewer who complained about continuity must not have been paying attention while watching. I say this because he or she complains there is no mention of Julie's best friend leaving until the end, which is not true. Hannah (Julie's best friend) speaks of this at the beginning of the movie. There were other things that reviewer said that led me to believe this person simply did not pay attention while viewing this film that I can't remember. All that aside, Sleepover is an adorable movie that even I can still relate to and I'm almost 30. It reminds me of when I was that age. Sleepover does a great job at capturing that time of transition between middle school and high school, as well as the bond between the 4 girls.

I could watch it over and over. This is coming from a 21 year old (straight) guy and I typically do not like movies like this but, I was over at a friend's house who has a nine year old daughter and she begged me to watch it with her and I did. I was extremely surprised. I laughed so hard at the mannequin scene (you'll know why when you see it). Also, there was a reviewer on here that commented on several points of the movie. One of them was talking about Julie's friend Hannah moving to Vancouver and said the following:

Quote:

""...at the end, we find out that Julie's best friend is moving. No prior mention of this, just a ""I have to go home and pack"" ""So you're really moving"" exchange.""

Just to let you know (since you obviously weren't paying that much attention, the very first line of the movie is from Julie saying: ""I can't believe you're moving. Where is Vancouver anyway?"" Plus, Hannah moving is mentioned about 8 other times in the movie as well. In the first 5 minutes, it's mentioned three times.

Just wanted to clear that up.

Anyways, this will be one of those ""Breakfast Club"" type movies. Not extremely popular when released but, over time it will become a High School Reunion classic along with ""She's All That"" and ""10 Things I Hate About You"" (awesome movie).

This is a great movie and I would recommend it to anybody. Very funny!

(Like when Steve sees Julie skateboarding in the red dress and suddenly decides that he likes her.) But movies like this are not meant to show real life. Funny, cheesy, unrealistic, happily-ever-after stories never hurt anyone.",1122422400,,459,4.822784810126582
2160617,1,B00062IVMG,"At first I thought this movie may seem like a very cute movie to watch, but then as we got further into it, I found that the movie asked me to suspend my disbelief too much.

To start off, when Stacy goes to exit the girls room she climbs over the trelis, if the viewer notices the trelis doesn't move when Stacy steps on it, but when the girls step on it, it becomes the most unstable force in the entire world.  It shakes it breaks, and then lies in shambles throughout the rest of the movie with no clear indication on why it happened.

Then while on the scavenger hunt, the director failed to show Stacy and her pose getting the sticker from the PatrolTech car but then suddenly when they meet back at the high school, oh look, Stacy's group has a PatrolTech sticker.

Then at the very end as the girls try to sneak back into the house, a tree fort comes crashing into the house.  The thing is, that later on, Julie's crush shows up in the same fort.  Julie couldn't climb in through the fort when it feel but somehow her crush did.  How did that happen?

Then as if that isn't enough to top the movie off, at the end, we find out that Julie's best friend is moving.  No prior mention of this, just a ""I have to go home and pack"" ""So you're really moving"" exchange.

The movie is just confusing to older viewers and asks the reader to suspend their disbelief too much.",1118448000,11,1372,4.202290076335878

2160621,5,B00062IVMG,"Last week I watched this movie because my friend's twelve-year-old daughter who I was watching wanted to see it. I thought I would ""suffer"" through. I LOVED IT!!!! I convinced my 42-year old husband to watch it and he thoroughly enjoyed it although I had to drive him crazy to get him to watch it. Then, last night, before I had to return it to the video store, I watched it with another 12-year old whose parents are close friends.

Why I liked the movie:

First of all, it's cute and it moves at a great pace. It pokes fun at the adults enough to be genuinely funny and not overdone. And the portrayal of the oblivious dad, the overprotective mother, and the big brother who comes through in the end is soooo accurate in my experience.

Second, while the snot girls are mean, they aren't heartless and they get their coming-tos in the end. Also, the main one, Stacey, has enough character development...finding out what older guys CAN be about and being disappointed, etc. that she is not a completely unsympathetic character.

My favorite two characters are Julie and Yancy. Julie because she's got spunk and Yancy because she is such an honest character. I also loved that Yancy's character is bolstered, let down and bolstered again. My favorite subplot has to be the celery vs. brownies theory...what a great point to be made for girls who are bigger or struggle with other physical self-esteem issues...find someone who is interested in you as you are, not as they might want you to be!

Also, I loved the fact that the closest it came to swearing of any sort was ""For the love of carbs!""...there wasn't even any euphemistic stuff like ""freaking,"" etc. Now, I am not a prude, believe me...I am a recovering alcoholic and have been in therapy for seven years. I started ""going around the block"" at about Julie's age and so, yes, I have ISSUES :). However, it is sooooo refreshing to watch a movie that isn't violence, sex, and swearing and just makes you feel good for everyone in the end! (even the snotty girls...at least they still have each other...Hannah moves away).

Another thing I was impressed with is the scene where Steve figures out from the yearbook who Julie is and says she grew up ""nice""...instead of focusing on T & A...he lists her school activities...debate, basketball, and her hobbies...skate boarding, etc. In other words, it's not all about shallow stuff...he's attracted to her physically sure, but his real interest is piqued when he finds out a little about WHO she is not WHAT she is. His character does this again by the fountain when he compliments her not on her looks but on her laugh. These are great messages for both adolescent boys and girls!!!!

Of course, Ren, the Patrol-Tec guy, and ""Sponge-Bob"" give the movie lots of extra hoots and interplay.

This is just a great movie, period. I am probably going to buy it...for myself :). It goes on my list with 10 Things I Hate About You, Never Been Kissed, and Miss Congeniality as a keeper for cute movies that give you warm fuzzies and move at a pace that keeps it interesting!

Compliments to the writer of this script, the actors who made it real and the director and producer who pulled it together seamlessly. Yes, I would give it an Oscar if they would make a category for well done youth films...books have awards for Children and Adolescent literature...maybe movies should too and we'd see some better quality in PG and PG-13 movies!! Just my humble opinion.

OK, I am done now :).

2160699,4,B00062IVMG,"Sleepover is a great movie for young teen girls, especially if they are having a sleepover! I have 5 & 6 year old girls and they found it entertaining as well - tho they didn't understand a lot of it.

This is a movie about Julie (Alex Vega), a Junior High student entering the summer before her Freshman year of High School.  Julie is dealing with the reality that her best friend is moving away and she will face High School without her.  A sleepover is planned at Julie's house for Julie, Hannah (Mika Boorem), Gabby (Jane Lynch) and Stacie (Sara Paxton), however Stacie is now part of the ""in"" crowd and cannot make it to the sleepover due to a dance she will be attending with her older boyfriend.  As Stacie disses Yancy (Kalie Flynn Childress) in front of the rest of the girls, Julie hands Stacie's invitation to the slumber party to Yancy.

Stacie ends up not attending the dance and decides it would be fun to plan a scavenger hunt. Stacie teams with a group of ""popular"" girls (and a driving permit) against Julie & the gang. Winner takes all! (The best seats for lunch next year at school! - the seats NOT next to the garbage dumpsters!)  Without a permit or a vehicle it seems a cinch that Stacie and her friends will win, but wait! Yancy has a plan!

This is a cute movie full of exciting twists & turns during the scavenger hunt - especially since the girls were not to leave the house! There is also a ""first crush"" love story here.

Cute movie! I recommend it!",1104364800,3,1477,4.364963503649635
2160700,4,B00062IVMG,"Directed by Joe Nussbaum, Sleepover revolves around one of the hallmarks of female friendship: the all-important slumber party. In hopes of shedding their not-so-cool reputations during the summer before their freshman year, best friends Julie (Alexa Vega), Hannah (Mika Boorem), Yancy (Kalli Flynn Childress), and Farrah (Scout Taylor-Compton) decide to host the sleepover of their lives. Far from a mere pillow-fight-laden girl talk-fest, this sleepover includes an intense scavenger hunt against the most simultaneously loathed and envied young women they know: the infamous ""popular"" clique. Along the way, the girls manage to hijack a car, sneak into clubs, engage in a first kiss, and learn more than a little bit about themselves and their capabilities - all while evading the watchful eyes of Julie's mother

2160701,4,B00062IVMG,"When I watched ""Mean Girls"" I could not help but think juniors in high school have nothing on girls in junior high. Surviving eighth grade is the hard part for teenage girls, but at that age you still have to be driven by somebody to the movie theater, so Hollywood continues to aim for older adolescents. ""Sleepover"" is about junior high girls, although on the final day of junior high, as they are about to become freshmen. But while we once again have the clash between the girls who rule the school and those who aspire to such lofty positions, this is a film that emphasizes ""cute"" over ""cruel.""

Julie (Alexa Vega) is having a sleepover not only because it is the last day of school but also because her best friend Hannah (Mika Boorem) is moving away. Farrah (Scout Taylor-Compton) is coming as well, but Julie's former best friend Stacie (Sara Paxton), has moved on to be Queen Bee of the snooty girls and will not be attending. When Stacie and her pack of brats insult Yancy (Kallie Flynn Childress), Julie invites her to be the fourth. Stacie has a date to go to the high school dance with the second string quarterback in his sports car, but he is more interested in parking than in dancing, so Stacie decides it would be more worthwhile to crash Julie's sleepover and challenge the girls to a scavenger hunt. This will require Julie and her friends to break the rules laid down by her mom, Gabby (Jane Lynch), because they will have to leave the house. But at stake is the prime seating place for eating lunch in high school, and there is also a good-looking boy.

Now, if the most high and mighty junior high girls on the face of the Earth think they are going to get to sit in the best place at lunch in high school, then they have a rude awakening in store for them. But the idea of a privileged place is certainly going to resonate with young viewers (although an outdoor lunchroom is not really a part of our culture) and ""Sleepover"" is clearly intended as an adolescent fantasy. How else do you explain the interest of high school boys in under-aged girls (who manage to get into dance clubs) or why there are kings and queens named at end of the school year dances (or why anyone other than a senior would get the crown).

Ultimately, ""Sleepover"" is above Julie and her friends getting a boost of adolescent self-confidence that will allow them to survive the horrors of high school. Julie has an advantage in that Hannah is there to give her a push. Hannah has her act together in a way that Stacie and the others never will; you get the feeling Hannah could be Queen Bee but that the role never goes to anyone who would be a benevolent leader. Your tolerance for this film will have to do entirely with your ability to enjoy all the cuteness. But subtlety is often lost in such adolescent fare (and there is an unexpected ""nude"" scene), and if other films directed at the 'tween audience could follow in the wake of this one that would be a good thing. The problem of course is by the time a film like this gets made and ends up on DVD a leading girl like Vega is already beyond the 'tween stage and in danger of becoming another yet Lindsay Lohan or Hillary Duff and the vicious circle continues in terms of teenage movies. But hopefully the success of this film will engender more to follow, even if a new crop of young stars will need to be found for each one.

My biggest complaint with ""Sleepover"" is actually about the end credits. This is where we get to see photographs of the cast with their names. We get Alex Vega (Julie), Mika Boorem (Hannah), Jane Lynch (Gabby), Sam Huntington (Ron), the trio of Sara Paxton (Staci), Brie Larson (Liz), and Scout Taylor-Compton (Farrah), the duo of Douglas Smith (Gregg) and Katija Pevec (Molly), with Steve (Sherman) and Jeff Garlin (Jay). Left out are Kalie Flynn Childress as Yancy, who had more to do than the Stacie or Liz characters, Russell (Evan Peters) who had way more to do that Gregg, and Sean Faris as Steve, the boy toy in the bottom of the box is even further down. Here is this above average juvenile cast in a nice ensemble effort and suddenly at the end what becomes important are what their agents negotiated for their clients rather than what actually happens in the film. At least on the DVD you have a commentary track with director Joe Nussbaum and Vega, Boorem, Taylor-Compton and Childress giggling their way through the film to get you back to thinking happy thoughts about the movie.",1101859200,13,4478,4.484068627450981
