8596012,3,B00DPJEWE8,"This presentation runs the spectrum for me from bad to wonderful; and I ended up trying to be positive and gave it three stars. The video was absolutely tremendous in presenting information and thumbnail views of some of the producers of the Cannubi area, which is a very specific and historic vineyard for Barolo wines; and I very much enjoyed the details about the various adjacent wine growing areas and the other information nuances of the vineyard itself. However, the pacing and staging of the film were weak and the visual effects used to introduce each grower were beyond irritating to being down right obnoxious. For the J Suckling and J Orr, both gentlemen of incredible ability in their respective fields, to have released this as it was is a disappointing, perhaps ""first effort"" together. I hope that if they turn their attentions to some other legendary vineyard areas for video production they will leave the ""effects"" behind and concentrate on the grapes, history, producers, and wines.",1486944000,,1002,5.005988023952096
