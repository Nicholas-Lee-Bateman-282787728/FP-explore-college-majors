8329100,2,B001O2SHQW,"Good amateurish effort. Does not claim to be more. It's about the characters of this movie blasting various homemade cannons, not HST's life or works.",1461196800,,150,5.04
8329101,1,B001O2SHQW,DO NOT WATCH. This movie sucks. There is nothing more to say. So upset I spent money on renting it. This sucked!!!!!!,1381017600,3,117,4.363636363636363
8329102,1,B001O2SHQW,"I thought I would see Hunters actual ashes shot out of a cannon on his property at some point, instead I saw a bunch of people shooting off their own cannons.  Apparently a local radio station had an essay contest to be the one to do it, and these where some of the people. Not at all what I'd hopes for and a waste of money.",1371859200,3,325,3.9242424242424243
8329103,5,B001O2SHQW,"Blasted is not only a great tribute to the late Hunter S. Thompson, but it's a truly unique view into an American subculture that is both hilarious and poignant. These eccentric cannon blasters, inspired by the free thinking philosophy of HST, create their own explosive salute to the famed writer. The director has made a pilgrimage to the heartland of Gonzo country and single handedly created a beautifully shot and edited portrait of our strange times.",1247097600,,456,5.0131578947368425
8329104,1,B001O2SHQW,"as an avowed HST fan, not sure what this was going to add to my collection of his books, Ralph Steadman art, and other videos/movies, but thought it might be entertaining, and would at least pertain to HST.  it does not.  fans of HST - don't bother.  if you like to see low budget recreations of what HST blew up at Woody Creek and wrote about, go ahead.",1237161600,,354,4.176470588235294
