5068367,5,B0079K4XS4,"The Story:
 world where deceased people turn into stone-like books and are stored in the Bantorra Library, anyone who reads a book can learn its past. Bantorra Library is maintained by the Armed Librarians, who wield supernatural abilities, and their enemy is a psychotic cult known as Shindeki Church. As the story progresses it presents a world of sorrow and pain, and the unfairness and frugality of life, as well as personal desires. However, in each arc there is also a small underlying hope, and more of the reasons, conspiracies, and secrets are revealed behind everything. It is about a specific overall history in time of Bantorra Library and its people. Each character dies a sorrowful yet meaningful death, and each death will open paths to a small ray of hope in the world, which also reveals a part of a secret to the reader.

 The show has one of the most original stories I have ever encountered. The music is pretty good, though I'm not going out to buy a soundtrack anytime soon. The animation was well done and clean. loved the depth of the character development: all of the characters were original and not at all clich (as it seems like most series nowadays are). The characters changed and struggled and grew. This show carries a bit of a serious mood, so it isn't one of the laugh-with-the-good-guys shows. Don't start out expecting your normal anime laughs and cheerful misunderstandings. To me is Great Series, cant wait for it to come.",1332460800,13,1460,4.762845849802371
5068368,3,B0079K4XS4,"This series might be a total waste. But before you flame about this, it is not a terrible series in every factor. Just, a jumbled mess of confusion half the time mixed with some decent characters and a sadistic female lead. Well, you think she is a lead. But mostly only because her character is the most prominent.

That is the one big issue with Bantorra is there is not exactly any protagonist in the series. It will jump around a bit following different characters. During this time, a lot of people get killed too. It is hard when watching it to really get to like any one character. If you do, they are either taken out of the story by  events or just plain killed. This is not a cheery anime even though it has a few cheery characters. Get used to people dying, get used to some real nasty villains. If you watch it for that and pay no attention to figuring out the story, you'll find something here. The villains alone I would rate as one of Bantorra's high points.

Aside from the weakness in the storytelling, the rest of the series has some high marks. Art is quite good and the opening theme for the first half of the show is very memorable. Ali Project does the theme and it is one of their best works in years. Very iconic with the show. It is strange why it gets changed halfway through. The theme that replaces it doesn't hold a candle to it.

If you like these kinds of shows and dark anime, then you'll probably love Bantorra for it's dark factors. This is just a fair warning to others that you will be confused going into this one. The story starts to make a little more sense around the midpoint, then as it is coming to a close. But when those final credits roll...well, you'll see. I can't give it more than a 3/5. This is one of the few I would recommend to rental only, not purchase. See if you'll like it first. Perhaps if I read the manga and got a little more depth with this series, I might be able to find it more appealing. But I don't see myself wanting to visit this series again.",1332374400,20,2013,4.234375
8512927,2,B0079K4XS4,"When people die, their life story and essence remains in the form of a stone book, which anyone can read. Great start. There are librarians who keep and defend these books. There is also the evil Church of Drowning in God's Grace that seeks to misuse this archive for their own egomaniacal needs. Sounds awesome. The show starts by introducing this premise, and also introducing a unique subclass of mindless humans called Meats. They don't explain them very well, but that's okay.

The show, however, soon suffers from a detached narrative, severely degraded animation, and a habit of removing likable characters without decent reason. The fights, animation, premise, and characters are all golden in the first five episodes. Then the animation takes a nose dive: two-frame movements, pathetic attempts at cheap fight choreography, and poorly integrated CG effects as a crutch for even poorer visuals.

The characters that are likable fade into the background or disappear from the narrative. A misunderstood, white-haired villain joins the team (taking three episodes to achieve that tired clich). In addition, a spunky, too good to be true, blameless, clueless vixen takes center stage and is completely bland and flat--except for the chest region, which is spilling out in all its bronze, balloon-mocking glory, accented with oiled highlights that shine even when she's in a dark cave. Normally I'd say the hell with it, it's anime. But she replaced a credible female character (Meseta) who was calculating, mysterious, and still well-endowed.

This show started off with all the promise of a solid anime series and then threw it away, quickly, to embody the average export. If someone can convince me that part two turned this trend around and pulled together a cohesive idea, then I'll gladly give it a shot. When the creators of this show stopped caring, so did I.

I'm an animator and writer, so I frequently pour through stacks of anime. If this was helpful or our tastes seem to align, follow along. I'll try to steer you straight.",1380153600,2,2041,5.0474777448071215

8512929,4,B0079K4XS4,"If you like weird but interesting this anime will be for you. Animation style, voice actors and music, remind me of black butler! My main problem with shows like these is it's really expensive for 13 episodes... and that's just part one.",1365206400,,237,4.666666666666667
8512930,5,B0079K4XS4,"I would recommend this anime it's a very interesting anime. It's trippy also it makes you think. When I saw the first episode, I got hooked up. Plus Hamyuts Meseta is a attention grabber. It's that good that I forgot how many times I've watched it. I have to admit it changes characters alot. The plot leaves you thinking.",1362182400,,322,4.47457627118644
8512931,5,B0079K4XS4,This first collection was nicely done and the animation was great. A great new series of anime. Well worth the watch.,1361059200,,117,4.619047619047619
8512932,3,B0079K4XS4,"The Armed Librarians are Psychic protectors of the Bantorra Library. When people die, their inner most thoughts are turned into stone tablets called books. There are many secrets in these books that could cause trouble in the wrong hands. The books are stored in the Bantorra Library. The Armed Librarians guard humanity from the power within them, and the ones that would use it for evil.

This series has some really good points, and some bad ones as well. In the end, I think that they balance each other out and create a mediocre series. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are well done. It's obvious that the production crew took their time to make a high quality product. I also like the premise that the story is based on. It's different, and a pretty interesting concept. Most anime nowadays is light hearted and lacks seriousness. The Book of Bantorra isn't like that. It has a very somber and serious mood. Which can be a good and bad thing.

Now for the bad points. The Book of Bantorra, as I said earlier, is about a group of psychic protectors of information (books). I believe for a series to really shine, it needs to be dramatic. It is hard to achieve that if there is no protagonist. This anime jumps around all over the place from character to character and not really achieving any kind of focus. Hamyuts Mesetah, the director of the Armed Librarians, is the main character. The problem is, she is hardly likable and doesn't make that much of an impact. Her sadist attitude is her only distinguishing trait. There are no characters to get attached to, or feel for. That's why the story isn't dramatic, or entertaining if I'm being honest.

Overall, I'm not impressed. I didn't enjoy watching this anime, but to be objective I'll give it 3 stars. It was obvious that this anime was an attempt at something good. You can see that from the quality of the production. The story was just extremely flawed, and lacked the basic elements that make a series memorable and great. I recommend renting it or watching it online if you are curious. I can't see this anime having all that many fans. I didn't enjoy it at all. I'll probably sell this DVD, and definitely not buy part 2.",1358467200,2,2199,4.604591836734694
8512933,5,B0079K4XS4,"I just had to purchase this after reading previous customer reviews. Too much dissagreement amongst
the opinions to pass it up. I was not dissapointed. In fact after watching Collection 1 I had to get Collection
2. Which I'm still watching as of this writing. To address the negative comments frankly I don't agree. I
have to admit that I'm a student of screen writing for animation and film so non linear story telling is no
major concern for me. Now if you're someone who needs to be spoon fed a narrative to understand
what's going on then I can see where you'll be confused regardless. Also there is a war going on in this
story. For those not familiar with the concept people dissappear and people die. Nuff said. My advice
read all the reviews and then decide if this is for you. But if you're an Anime junky like me Bantorra
Collection 1 and 2 are must haves for any hard core fan.",1356393600,6,888,4.387878787878788
8512934,2,B0079K4XS4,"When you read the synopsis of the story it sounds good but when it comes to the storytelling and introduction of characters they kind of just jump into it leaving you with no idea of who the characters are and why you should care about them. Which drags the story, another problem is not only do they not put enough into a character but they introduce another when many are left incomplete.(spoiler alert- they also kill a character off before giving us a complete sense of who he is and expects the audience to care). So yeah I'm giving it two stars, if you want to watch it just go online don't waste your money.",1343692800,3,614,4.3478260869565215
8512935,4,B0079K4XS4,"One of the things I like about anime is that so many of anime series come up with some odd twist on reality that allows an unusual story to be told.  Book of Bantorra is one of those anime.  It's basically the real world, but when people die, there's a sort of spiritual being that can withdraw ""books"" from people when they die.  The book is a stone tablet that when touched reveals the life story of the person whose book it is.  And there's a library that stores people's books.  And that library is protected by people called ""armed librarians"" who have magic/powers that are beyond normal people.  I haven't quite figured out why powerful fighters need to protect a library, but that's the way it is.  They tell you it's to protect against a particular religious organization, but despite their attacks, I can't quite figure out why they're attacking.  There's something you learn later that sort of explains it, but taking another step back, there's no reason for that explanation either.  Anyway, it's a little odd, but...

It's interesting.  There are characters you start to like, and you hope that they succeed, so the writers did something well.  If you enjoy odd alternate-reality stories that make you try to figure out what's going on... this series might be for you.

This product is only the first half of the story though.  This is not a complete story without the second half.",1342915200,,1394,4.683127572016461
8512936,4,B0079K4XS4,"First off you're probably just wonder if this product is worth the price.  The answer is no.  Being split across two volumes and only being a DVD, so no HD for you, at almost a hundred bucks total is an insane price.

Now is the show worth watching?  The first half of the show is definitely worth watching.  The show at its core is an action anime lots of fights, people get killed some of them are even 2nd tier characters.  Like a good action movie most of the time it is a struggle for them and then ends with some small glimmer of victory or hope.  As others have pointed out there is no main protagonist though there is a core cast of 3 or 4 characters who show up in a majority of all the episodes and most of the plot either revolves around them or is influenced by them.  The show is more mature in that for the first half at least there are no sappy victories where the character wins the day by talking down the villain with their high minded ideals.  In fact the primary woman of the show usually calls them idiots and kills them outright.  Unfortunately in the 2nd half of the series the show takes a big and convoluted turn for the worse.  The plot gets very ridicules and the stereotypical high minded speeches that don't make any sense but are prevalent in anime start popping up.  Characters who in the past get called out for doing this suddenly aren't scolded about it even though their choice gets thousands of people killed for no reason, but who cares they were the cherry happy character who can do no wrong.  It ends with the sudden introduction of two entirely new characters who had zero introduction before their intro but are revealed to be the core element of the series that everything has been revolving around and building up to.  They end bit is also very sappy and completely at odds with the tone of the rest of the show.

I understand that the anime is based off a series of novels in Japan, possibly still on going, so I suspect the sudden shift and deterioration of the series in the 2nd half is due to the creators rushing things to try and match the novels.  Like so many book to movie translations, they screwed it up.

So if you're looking for something other than the bright and constantly cheery anime this one is probably for you though you'll probably end up being disappointed by the ending.  I can't really think of a good comparison anime the best I can reference is Ghost in the Shell at least in tone, but this show no where near as good as it.",1341878400,,2495,4.317596566523605
