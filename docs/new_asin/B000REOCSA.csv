2864694,5,B000REOCSA,"If your an old Charles Bronson fan and like the Death Wish series, this is the collection to get. Watching the DVDs definatly takes you back in time.",1226793600,,149,4.357142857142857
2864695,3,B000REOCSA,"It's arguable whether the DEATH WISH films are great films, but they're cathartic enough to compensate for any perceived lack of depth.  The first one was horrifically brutal, but certainly thoughtful and artfully done, and it resonated with a huge swath of the American public - myself included.  Of the sequels, I've always particularly enjoyed number 4, wherein Bronson's character, Paul Kersey, succeeds in convincing each of two rival drug organizations that the other is violating their truce.  DW3, with its virtual WWIII breaking out in the project may be the most surreal and insane, guilty-pleasure joyride of a movie I've ever seen.  And although parts of numbers 2 and 5 are pretty disturbing, I still like them overall.

So, this collection would really hit the spot except for the unfortunate fact that numbers 2-5 are all pan & scan ""full-frame"" croppings.  The first is the only one presented in the original widescreen.  (The separate, individual releases are the same.)  Honestly, I despise pan & scan and think it should be illegal to disfigure films in this way.  What's the point, anyway?  These days, no one has a 13"" screen.  Someone should return to the original film stock and do a proper transfer.  So, four stars for these cool films, but only two for the presentation.  Average 3 up to 3.5.",1208476800,26,1318,4.909502262443439
