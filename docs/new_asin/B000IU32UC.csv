8147452,5,B000IU32UC,"This  was a Great Inteview with  Tom Petty and Charlie Rose.  With the
Release at the  time--""Echo"".  w/the Heartbreakers.  **This would be
the last Cd/album  with  Howie Epstein.  The  Inteview is only just  10/12
Because of other guest.  But  still Great if your  a  Big  Petty Fan.
Plus they showed a clip of  ""Walls""--from  the  ""She's the One""-Soundtrack.
This Cd is Better than the Movie.  ---Maybe that's why I never had seen  a Clip from
That Cd.  Anyway--Again--if your a Petty Fan--this is a pretty cool item to seek out.
You will Enjoy it.  Got  this in the Mail  pretty quick.  Everyone else--Enjoy.
Happy  Hunting.  Troy",1301270400,,633,4.716981132075472
