7071270,2,B00UUBFSV0,I wish they would make it last a lot longer and have a choice of everyday soft music or only the sound of a crackling fire. Wasn't worth the money.,1455580800,,147,3.933333333333333
7071271,5,B00UUBFSV0,Perfect fireplace 'effect' - snaps and crackles and the slight roaring sound one would expect from a real fire.  So real it almost makes you feel warm.  Great to have as a background (without the television blaring) for when friends come to visit.  Love it!,1448409600,,257,4.666666666666667
7071272,5,B00UUBFSV0,"With this DVD you can have an almost realistic fire in your house, even if you have no fireplace. You can choose between three different log fires that create a very cozy atmosphere. Either you watch them with the sounds of fire or with relaxing piano music. The DVD is a very good way to quickly bring a cozy atmosphere in the cold winter months in his home. I like the DVD best with the natural sounds of the fire, you can hear the crackling of the logs and the blaze of fire.",1444780800,,478,4.150537634408602
7071273,5,B00UUBFSV0,"Very nice DVD.  HD high quality 4K, excellent clarity and brilliant color full fireplace fires.  This colorful HD DVD features a choice of three clear and vibrant fires or all can be played together and will loop continuously for a relaxing evening. My favorite part of this DVD is the fact that the whole fire shows clearly and burns down as an actual fire does. I prefer the natural sounds of the fire as it crackles and burns. However, you can add lovely piano music if you prefer.

 There is an hour worth of footage on this DVD and as I mentioned it does loop continuous for uninterrupted enjoyment.

7071275,5,B00UUBFSV0,This dvd is great for a relaxing evening at home or a romantic dinner. It loops over & over & it's just like having a fireplace at home with all of the sounds of a crackling fire.,1429488000,,179,3.864864864864865
7071276,5,B00UUBFSV0,"This DVD has several different scenes of fireplaces.  It's cool because it's positioned exactly like you would be looking at a fireplace and each scene starts with the fire roaring and slowly dissipates to low embers.  The fire sounds are very authentic and if you don't want that, you can switch to soft, soothing piano music.  I highly recommend this DVD if you are looking for a fireplace to sit by but don't have an actual fireplace.",1428796800,2,437,4.64935064935065
7071277,5,B00UUBFSV0,"I just finished watching this DVD on my 1080P TV and like his other fireplace DVDs I have, I love it!  The photography is exceptionally clear on all 3 tracks and it's filmed back from the fire far enough that you get to see the whole fire, not just logs. It wouldn't feel like a fireplace to me if you couldn't see the whole fire. While I still prefer to listen to the actual fire sounds crackling, etc., I played part of it with the piano music to see how it sounded. I'm not a huge fan of piano music, but the music chosen for this DVD was extremely pleasing to me. That's a definite plus as now I know I can listen to either while playing the DVD and enjoy it either way. I definitely find this DVD relaxing and will be playing it often until the weather gets hot. It's April now and it snowed again yesterday!",1428364800,,813,4.113207547169812
7071278,3,B00UUBFSV0,"I own Fireplace XXL DVD by Helsloot and Helsloot's Fire 4K downloaded in 1080P. This filmed in 4K DVD can also be downloaded from Vimeo as MP4's in 1080P, but quite frankly, they do not look as good as the 4 larger fireplaces seen in Fireplace XXL DVD.

There are only 3 total fireplaces in 4K (despite the description above claiming 5) and two of them are rather small ones in which the logs only fill about half the screen width. So too, remember this DVD (as are all other DVD's) is produced/converted down in 480P which will never show the detail of HD, much less 4K, despite being filmed in 4K.

I recommended buying Fireplace XXL DVD over this 4K one.",1427760000,4,657,4.377049180327869

8708317,5,B00UUBFSV0,"An early Christmas gift for myself: Three fireplace videos of real fires in real fireplaces!
And now that Ive seen the Fireplace videos I will also buy one as a Christmas gift for mom. Especially since it has a gift of its own:
FREE 4K Downloads. On the cover of the DVD you get a code allowing you to download FREE 4K fireplace videos on their website [...] It works really easy, just type in the code, click the download button and there it is! The quality of these downloads is amazing. It's 4K, UHD and looks great on any screen. Like CHRISTMAS TIME! Now I can watch a realistic 4K Fireplace Video whenever and wherever I want to. For example on my iPad in a hotel room.

I often wondered whether I should install a real fireplace in my living room, because I love those special, romantic and cozy evenings, but I hate the hassle and having installed a fireplace is pretty expensive. The fireplace videos of The Ambient Collection took away my doubts. The flickering flames of the log fires are so intense and realistic that the fireplace videos create the same romantic atmosphere as a real fireplace does. I can almost feel the warmth through my TV screen. The fire sounds and the relaxing sounds of crackling wood complete this realistic fireplace experience. I use the fire sound option during dinner parties and will use it during the Christmas Holidays while unwrapping gifts with my family.
When I want to create the ultimate romantic and relaxing evening with my boyfriend I choose the soothing piano music. I love that this Fireplace DVD has an automatic loop function, so I can endlessly enjoy the fireplace videos (a favorite one or Play All continuously)
And I Iove that it has three different fireplaces. One with roaring fire from the start that ends with soft glowing embers, a gentle fire that completely burns down and a fire with big logs in close up, also with a complete burn down.
Looking for a unique gift for yourself or a loved one? I truly recommend this DVD (with FREE Download)",1476057600,5,2008,4.608938547486034
