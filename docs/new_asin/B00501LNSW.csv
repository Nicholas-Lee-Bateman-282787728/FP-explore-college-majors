8450576,5,B00501LNSW,"Good workout, fun routines and music.  Kari and her backups are easy to watch over and over.  Some of the routines take a few times to master, but well worth it. A total of 55 minutes workout, but you can pick and choose to customize what you want to do.",1482278400,,254,4.06
8450577,4,B00501LNSW,"I have the first Sweat Express and was excited to get this one. Although I like this one, it is nothing like the first one, If you are expecting  a kick your trash workout like the first one, you will be disappointed. It really doesn't start to get your heart pumping faster until the last two chapters. You are getting a workout but it's more of the low impact until the last two songs. The workout is divided into chapters where you learn new moves but once the chapter is over you do not combine the moves with any other chapters. So you learn a lot of moves but the moves from each chapter are never combined to get your heart going like most of her other videos such as Dance works, Cardio with Jay etc. The music is nice and the moves are fun but it really shouldn't have been called Sweat Express 2. It's good for variety and a good change to add to my workout DVDS. I like it because the 60 minutes go fast and moves are challenging. It keeps you busy trying to learn and not boring you like a treadmill. I have loved Kari Anderson and how it keeps you striving to get more in fit. It's a challenge but this is low impact. I still recommend it to add variety to your collection.",1404950400,,1186,4.156521739130435
8450578,5,B00501LNSW,"Crazy fun workout.  Kari is the best.  She cues so well that you don't even have to think!  I wish some of the newest instructors would take a cue from some of the best veterans (Kari, Karen Voight, Petra Kolber, etc) about how to cue in ways that may exercise so easy that you focus on the FUN.

I love this workout and I would recommend this to anyone who likes dance style workouts.",1372550400,,385,4.162162162162162
8450579,4,B00501LNSW,"This workout is really dance based fitness, the music is very good (pop and latin) and you feel you are dancing from the beginning. The exercise routines perfectly match the music! The choreographies are somewhat difficult at the beginning but with some practise you will get into them (maybe 1-2 weeks). I also strongly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bootcamp-Boogie/dp/B002W9IPJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bootcamp Boogie</a>, which has also good music and is a bit easier if you have difficulties with or do not like more elaborate choreographed routines. Petra's DVD is more ""workout"" type exercises in very simple combinations, or you could also try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Funktional-Fitness/dp/B000B69TE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Funktional Fitness</a>&nbsp;which is also very choreographed, but with excellent music and the toning is maybe a bit more intense.

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Medium to high TONING: Very good CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Beginner to intermediate INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Excellent MUSIC: Very good FUN FACTOR: Very good

CONTENTS:
1) 12 different songs divided in 4 chapters, each with its own dance routine(s) or choreographed segment(s) that do not repeat themselves. The first and the last songs are slower, so that they serve as your warm-up and cool-down, but you dance from the start till the end. To get your cardio level continuosly up, Kari does not break down the moves slowly. She starts with the very basic step and then adds some extras, like some ball change, arm movements, etc., but everything to the same song you are dancing to, so you are continuosly moving. Considering that there is no tutorial (which would have been a good bonus), it might get you some time to get the moves; but you'll get them, just stick to it.
2) Stretch - Excellent standing stretches.

MUSIC:
Very good music selection and the volume of the music compared to the instructor's voice is perfect to let you enjoy the music and exercise to it while still hearing the cueing.

EMPHASIS:
It is mainly cardio, but it has some toning too (mainly lower body - calfs and thighs - and a bit of glutes and abs). It also includes several balance exercises, which I always find very good. In fact you think you are not exercising enough, but you will feel it the day after.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD'S:
+ Music selection
+ FUN: This DVD is one of my favorites, it is fun to exercise this way. Once you get the moves it's a non-stop routine and you do not need to do a lot of ""from the tops"" over and over.

I would recommend this DVD as an excellent introduction to working out (this one will motivate you to start exercising and then you can move on to tougher ones), as an alternative for your regular workouts (to get out of the boredom or to get a bit of cardio into your toning routines). If you like dancing you will probably like this DVD.",1342742400,7,2966,5.181628392484343
8450580,5,B00501LNSW,"SX used to be part of my weekly workout. Alas, I no longer live in Seattle and can't get to class -- this DVD is almost as good as being there. The only thing missing is feeling virtuous having done a HARD workout first thing Sunday morning!",1334620800,,241,4.148936170212766
8450581,5,B00501LNSW,"I love, love, love this workout! I first got in shape in my teens with the 80's/early 90's dance aerobic craze (Charlene Prickett was a favorite). I've been looking for routines that go back to that feeling, and this fits the bill! I also danced through college, and had the original Sweat Express back in high school. I remember it was one of my most challenging pure aerobic workouts, both for being very high impact and for stamina to keep it going for a full 60 minutes. However I found the music and some of the steps for the original cheesy/annoying. This workout is even better, in my opinion! The music has a latin/hip hop flavor that I enjoyed listening to and dancing with. It is lower impact than her first Sweat Express, but my post-baby, mid-30's knees and hips are thankful for that. I thought the first 20 minutes or so were pretty tame, then she revs up the pace and actually saves her higher impact for the second half of the video. I'm getting back into shape, and had to keep it lower impact for now, but I am so excited to do this video again. She's also great with cueing, and I found the choreography challenging but not so frustrating that I just stared at the TV. It will be a lot of fun working out with this video and getting better each time!",1326067200,2,1269,4.358649789029536
8450582,5,B00501LNSW,"I love Kari Anderson's workouts - I've been doing her videos/DVDs since she started.  The original Sweat Express is still in my workout rotation, although I might retire it now I have Sweat Express 2.  If you like Kari's choreography, you'll love this.  It's more ""dance"" than the original Sweat Express, great music, a really good workout.  The choreography is interesting enough that you probably won't get it all the first time through, but you'll still get a workout.  I prefer the ones that are a little more challenging to master.

Kari's friendly personality shines through, she looks amazing, and the special treat is seeing her beautiful 25-year-old daughter dancing with her.

This will definitely become one of the regulars in my workout rotation.",1320710400,,758,5.064516129032258
8450583,3,B00501LNSW,"I found this to be extremely complex and difficult to really get much benefit out of - so far. I am sure when I learn the steps more, it will be a good workout. Halfway through the workout and I'm not even cracking a sweat because I keep stumbling.  This is only my second time trying it and I am no better the second time than the first. I will give this a few tries before this gets consigned to the give away pile.  I've been doing videos for years.. I have about 35 of them and this is the first one I've ever felt this frustrated with",1316304000,3,539,3.9814814814814814
8450584,5,B00501LNSW,"I love this workout! Kari is a real class act! Her instructions are spot-on and the moves flow perfectly from one to the next. The music is awesome, the moves are fun and the set and the outfits they wear are very nice. It flys by. Each song is it's own routine, then you move on never to return to the previous routine-which is great for those of you that hate TIFTT-ing! Wonderful offering from Kari.",1312070400,3,402,4.302631578947368
