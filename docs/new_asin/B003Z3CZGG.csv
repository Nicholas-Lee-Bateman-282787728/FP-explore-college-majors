4232111,5,B003Z3CZGG,"An excellent film by Curtis Bowers. Outlines the agenda of communists and their profoundly effective work in the United States, yet offers hope. Buy it now.",1288483200,23,156,5.038461538461538
4232112,5,B003Z3CZGG,"In the past few years I have entertained a variety of opinions and analysis as to the cause of America's ills. America grew lax and complacent with its standing in the world, which now we are paying a price. We have allowed those who have devised the greatest of political machinations to infiltrate every avenue of our infrastructure. We have lost sight of what America really is, a land of promise. However, that promise, through the past several decades, has dwindled due to our lack of faith and diligence in keeping the commandments of Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.

This documentary nails the main cause of America's troubles, the degeneration of a moral society. Very adept people, pertaining to the black art of political machinations, have calculated and orchestrated the social ills of this nation. These entities never tire or waver in their cause, but we have faltered in our greatest duty as a citizen. We have betrayed the sacred trust of our Founders and the liberating document they constructed for us. We have allowed ourselves to be fooled and manipulated by scheming entities that care nothing of freedom. Instead, these organizations meet in the cover of dark to devise plans only to subvert and destroy all we hold dear. However, it must be noted that the right/left paradigm is the bane of our country. Therefore, deduce the truth within the film, instead of playing partisan politics and point fingers at the left. Both sides are involved in this grotesque web of malice. This political propaganda techniques of the communists have been strategically calculated for some time. A good book to pick up to understand their odious plot is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Lies-for-Old/dp/0945001134/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Lies for Old</a>. Written by an KGB defector, this book provides ample analysis and solid conclusions as to why noncommunist countries eventually succumb to scheming design of international communism.

We, as a society, must make restitution for the generations to come. We must make reparation for our neglect and idleness. We must build our families up to combat the enemy that lurks in our very communities. First and foremost, we need to put the Lord at the head of our lives and allow Him to guide our paths down the dark roads that are ahead. The lesson of this documentary is simple, protect your family and teach your children the values your children need to overcome the world. The only hope we have is the God of this land, who is Jesus The Christ. This is a must see film.",1288310400,27,2592,5.110849056603773

4232115,5,B003Z3CZGG,"I agree totally with Mitchell Lynch's review.  The only thing I would add is their first objective is to take GOD out of our lives and the movie clearly shows how it has been done.

This is a movie every American needs to see.

The country is clearly at a fork in the road.  Do we continue down the 1960's road or go back to what the Founding Fathers were trying to do.

It is very clear Marxism/Socialism/Fascism/Communism (they are have the same objective) or maximum Freedom with limited government.

4232116,5,B003Z3CZGG,"Deathly creepy-this film shows how the left has worked to undermine traditional American values and our culture by taking control of our education system and dumbing down our children. They're taught a false history of our country and combined with a sewer culture and a lying, left dominated media, when they reach voting age, they're primed for a malignant narcissist like Obama to step into their lives.

IMO, we are heading for a second civil war if we don't regain control of this government-it can be no other way, true Americans are not western Europeans, we do want someone telling us what kind of light bulb we can use.

4232118,5,B003Z3CZGG,"Incredibly Informative and Bold in the presentation of the historical roots of the plague of evil in the world and it's current deceptive trend of penetrating the deepest levels of American Society. Precisely and Accurately aware of the cosmic battle of Truth vs. Lies, and their consequences... This really is a battle of Good vs. Evil, and prayer is and will be an important contribution toward the outcome of this evil on mankind.  More than just moving in one's inner soul, but riveting to the intellect and motivating to the Patriot heart as well.  The existence of the clear and openly visible Communist Agenda from as far back as 1958, resurfacing in 1992, and now in a phase of recognizing much of it's fulfillment in today's culture and society in the U.S. and elsewhere, makes the danger real and the enemy present but also the age old solution impressively attractive, relevant for yet another reason, and galvanizing for those on the side Jesus' original purpose at the cross.  The solution is salvation over the power of death and sin through the finished work of Jesus Christ on that Roman torture medium.  He bled and died there so that we might be covered by that blood, coming through the cleansing to be restored to intimate knowledge of The Heavenly Father, and Jesus whom He sent.  The regular attack on this Truth is gaining traction and resonating with the hatefulness inherent in the heart of mankind (apart from God) and is resulting in the land of the free falling to the self-inflicted wounds of the amoral and unethical opponents of the savior of the world. My family will definitely be enjoying the screening of this film and most likely the sequel as well, after Dad first screens the content of course!  But if part 2 of the Agenda series is half as informative and motivating toward the highest of standards as this film was, it will also be added to the most regularly watched video library of this family and every person of value and coherence inside of our network of loved ones and sphere of influence.  Thank you very much for compiling this data and for organizing the facts and for featuring the voices and images of the individuals used as subject matter experts on this picture.",1522713600,3,2219,4.733160621761658

4232126,4,B003Z3CZGG,"interesting documentary, what all of this sounds like is communism is just a philosophy used by people who want wealth and power, they aim to rule, and if they have to destroy a country to do so they will, all governments have risen under the same premise, destroy those who oppose your reach for power. satan started the whole ball rolling, no man is righteous no man is just in ruling over his fellow man not even the usa government. hence while God has allowed it he does in no way sanction it or approve of it, so what I see here is the appeal to selfishness, to get something for nothing, this left stuff seems to appeal to the downtrodden, the stupid (willful stupid as in selfishness)those who have no inclination to use their brains over their emotions. the republicans the libertarians all support the same basic principles, man can rule over man if we only unite in this principle or that principle or if you vote for this guy or that guy in power, the reality is no matter who is voted in the end result is the same. some are more tolerable then others but all rulers and leaders eventually surcumb to the corruption that power brings.",1522108800,,1146,4.461904761904762

If you like liver, you love it, if you don't, you hate it.  Politics are the same.  Get the picture.  I'm not trying to change your mind one way or the other.

I'm 60 years old and I can attest that history has been slowly changing from when I was a child to how it is taught today to our young children and it has dramatically changed in the last two decades. Also, other things are being taught differently today than they were when I was young.  Like or dislike this doc, you have to, or have not to agree/disagree that ""history is taught by the victors"".  In other words, conquer and then you can rewrite/pseudo change history.

All I am saying is to ""think"" and not just be told how to think for the ""whole"" rather than for yourself.  If you can, than your eyes will open and you will see the world for what it really is.

It's interesting they call him an ""atheist"", but fits the pattern since for some reason all the International Atheist Organizations only seem to teach people to bash Christians when Atheist just means you don't believe in God.  Guess what, the first part of the bible that Atheists quote when bashing Christians is the Jewish Holy Book the Torah.  Also interesting that like the porn industry, 98% Hollywood, 96% MSM, SPLC, NAACP and ADL; that International Atheist Organizations are founded and/or run by Zionist AshkeNazi Jews.  Facts..  Then add that every board member of the Federal Reserve and IMF (western money & interest rates) are the same small tribe 1.8% of USA Population and far less world population...

4232147,1,B003Z3CZGG,"Clearly the worst piece of propaganda I've ever watched. It appears this film has been put out by the real powers that control this country, the Fascists that control the banks and all the other major industries like energy, big Pharma, big Agriculture, the corporate media, and the military industrial complex. It's extremely important to know that the plan is to divide us and pit us against each other. It's easier to keep us in slavery if we are not united in our fight to defend our country. Fear is another aspect of their plan. Making us afraid of the red menace of communism and each other is a powerful means of control. State sponsored corporate fascism is not located on the left side of the political scale, it is on the extreme right. If you are thinking about right or left is to miss the point, that's how they turn us against each other. Politics in the U.S. is just show business created to keep you distracted and fighting against each other. While it is true that the United States of America has been slowly stolen away from the constitutional republic it originally was. It's not the Commies or the Socialists who have done it. A little investigating, some critical thinking, and a lot of common sense would clearly show you this. Let's just take a brief look at the surface. Joseph McCarthy ran all the communists out of the U.S. back in the early 1950's. Anyone who was even liberal leaning was black balled and couldn't get work. If you register to vote today, you will not see any option to register as a communist or socialist, there are no communist or socialist political parties in this country any longer. There used to be several and they played a big role in digging us out of the great depression by putting political pressure on FDR. Most Americans think Communism and Socialism are the same thing, they use the terms interchangeably. They are not the same! In fact there are many different kinds of socialism(at least 4) and they are very different. For example national socialism (think Nazi) is the opposite of communism. The film maker clearly doesn't know what he's talking about. And don't even try to claim the democratic party is communist or socialist. With the exception of Bernie Sanders who is an independent that ran as a democrat because the system is so corrupt that a 3rd party candidate can't even get into the debates. The Dems are a bunch of wishy washy moderates who are owned by the same fascists who control the republican party.
It was Wall Street and other corporations like Bayer, Ford, IBM, Standard oil, and IG Farbin, to name just a few who were behind the rise of Adolf Hitler. They even continued to finance him during WW2. Americans were dying, fighting the war in Europe, and these fascists were still supporting Hitler.
All the political figures who have been assassinated in the last 60 years were JFK, RFK, MLK, Malcom X, Paul Wellstone, and all the leaders of the Black Panther Party. Where do they land on the political spectrum? Is the left killing themselves? Is that their grand plan? Once they get into power then they assassinate themselves?
Let's look at all the republican presidents over the last 50 years. Nixon/Ford, Reagan, Bush1, Bush2, Trump. All have committed Federal crimes while in office. All of them have violated the constitution they swore to uphold. All of them have eroded our civil rights and created policies that destroy our freedoms. All of them have waged wars. Nixon had Vietnam where he extended the war into Cambodia and Laos illegally. Then of course there was watergate, Ford covered up the Kennedy assassination as a member of the Warren commission and he pardoned Nixon before he was even tried, preventing the American people from ever finding out what really happened, essentially covering up Watergate. Reagan ran a secret illegal war in Nicaragua and smuggled crack cocaine into the U.S. to fund the illegal black ops war he was waging. Regan was convicted in the world court at the Haig for war crimes. Reagan also waged an all out war on the environment, unions, and working men and women of the U.S. His FCC destroyed the fair and balanced rules for the news media. He also did away with the monopoly laws for the media allowing for the fascists to take over that industry as well. As a gift he literally gave Rupert Murdoch an American citizenship so he could buy FOX. Talk about an illegal alien, he never went through the legal steps to become an American, he got a free pass to create the greatest propaganda machine in history. It was Bush Senior as vice president who was the real ring leader of Iran/Contra. He was supplying Iran and the Contras with weapons and then on the return flights home there was heroin from the middle east and cocaine from central America coming back to fund this former head of the CIA's reign of terror. Bush invaded Panama and then he invaded Iraq after baiting Saddam into invading Kuwait. Under baby Bush we have 9/11 and multiple endless wars in the middle east. He created the Patriot Act and then the National Defense Authorization Act (which most people have never heard of). It's only important because it strips the American people of all there legal rights granted to them by the constitution of the United States. Of course Bush 2 was never elected, both of his elections were rigged by the republican party and there is a mountain of evidence to prove it. His brother Jeb fixed the Florida election for him in 2000. It worked so well they did it again when the republican party controlled the voting and the voting machines in Ohio in 2004. The same is true for trump, the Russians may be involved but it was the republicans using a nation wide crosscheck plan that prevented millions of people from voting and threw away hundreds of thousands of minority votes in the contested swing states. He actually lost both the popular vote and the electoral college. He may just be a clown/puppet or he may be the biggest criminal of them all, we just don't know the extent of it yet. While Presidents Clinton and Obama did there part in the erosion of the American republic it was not at the same level of damage or criminality as the others. Once they got into office they quickly found out they were not in charge and they maintained the status quo and followed orders to continue the take over plan while being threatened of winding up like the Kennedys.
This just scratches the surface of this hostile takeover of America. But it sure doesn't look like the left are the ones doing it. Unless of course you are a drooling gork sitting in front of the TV all day watching fox news or listening to Limbaugh all day on the radio. Having them sh*t on your brain every day is bound rot it away. This propaganda film is just more of that sh*t!

4232149,4,B003Z3CZGG,"Before you dismiss Agenda: Grinding America Down as a far-right crackpot screed, examine the details.

Antonio Gramsci, the Italian communist philosopher cited in Agenda: Grinding America Down, did indeed examine how a socialist culture could slowly co opt a capitalist country. Gramscis philosophy does indeed show up in many current social debates. _The Naked Communist, a 1948 book, does indeed describe the social progressive goals that have since become todays political controversies. Useful idiots, as Lenin called the idealist activists who support communist causes, do indeed dominate academia. (The ratio of far-Left professors to moderate professors nationwide was 12 to 1 last time I checked. Not a diverse group to be sure.)

Agenda: Grinding America Down proposes too many moral binaries that undermine its effectiveness. And while the film seems to over-promote family values, Christianity, and restriction of LGBT rights, intelligent viewers can think for themselves and imagine moderate positions where it can be taken seriously.

It doest matter if there is an agenda"" or not. Bad ideas can spread by themselves. Extreme Leftist identity politics""--such as shown by third-wave feminism, antifa, SJWs, extreme globalism, moral relativism, and extreme political correctness--do constitute a grave danger to US culture, especially given the number of totalitarian enemies we face. These dogmatic views spread by useful idiots also stifle debate, an essential part of our government.

Fortunately the election of Donald Trump signals a shift away from social disintegration and institutional anti-Americanism. Whether it can be sustained, regardless of political party in charge, is another matter.

The alternative? Its not good.

The legacy of Marxism in Europe is the death of more people in peacetime than have died in all twentieth century wars. Socialism destroys creativity, general welfare, and ultimately leads to dictatorship. After all, if the impossible goal of socialism is the creation of a perfectly fair world, socialists believe, any amount of human sacrifice, loss of freedoms, repression of dissent, is justified.

Agenda: Grinding America Down, despite its flaws, deserves four stars. It lays out whats at stake in culture wars, and warns of consequences.",1519776000,3,2289,5.636627906976744

I give it 5 stars because it does get the information out there.  I felt the religious opinions of some of the people on here were a little heavy-handed, and this can turn people off.

However, almost all of the persons interviewed are far Right types, many being conservative Christians, that aren't any more tolerant than their perceived enemies. I caught a distortion here and there, as well as several hyperbolic assertions that lack meaningful evidence to back them up.

I consider myself right of center, but not as far right as many of the presenters. There are some decent speakers that seem to genuinely care about the US not becoming a liberal socialist utopia in which certain freedoms are lost (it's been 8 years, and some of that has happened already, namely free speech being labeled 'hate speech'). The parts on Obama are frighteningly accurate, especially now that we see how he behaves in his post-presidency (chumming it up with Farrakhan, for example). However, some of them act like the sky is falling and seem to have a concern that borders on paranoia (ex: the woman squawking about homeschooling your children and that they ""consistently test higher"" than other). After they started in with the Jesus talk I started to lose interest. American is not a Christian nation. I can't find the name of Jesus in any federal documents.

If you're inquisitive and strive to understand the views, beliefs, and actions of all people then I do recommend watching this documentary and its sequel. Let me make it very clear that by ""understand"" I mean listen to opposing views as if to have a debate or discussion but by no means do i share the delusional and conceited beliefs expressed in the doc. The premise Curtis Bowers tries unsuccessfully to sell is actually very effective at contradicting his argument and revealing his hooved and horned true self. Its he and those who share hie ideology that are Communists. I use the word Communist because in Mr Bowers vernacular its the worst this in the entire world next to Environmentalist. Call me ""old fashioned"" but wasn't that the boogie man of the 40's and 50's? Perhaps that's why Mr Bowers (aka Ronald Reagan's Dingalberry"" is trying to rebrand environmentalism.

The author fails to mention who set up this big plan and what the purpose is of it. Oh, he goes into detail chronicling this but the question that kept coming back is, where is the leader in this facade? The blame that the ""left"" is doing it hardly describes who is the pivot man, the purpose other than to scream ""communism"" replacing the red scare of the 50's and two what end. We've had 5 GOP Presidents and a GOP controlled House and Senate for some time but the ""left"" is doing the harm and making it us fail. He is riding Occam's razor...
This really scares me, not because some of what is said is true, it's that people (especially some of the smart cameo's he has in this video) buy into the lie that one side has done it instead of demanding honesty from both sides.
Both sides tend to crap on the constitution to play to their base and instead of really standing up for the constitution they demand morality via legislation which seems far too justify as means to get their views placed.",1517097600,12,1154,4.25

Instead it offers simple sound-bites of earnest, self-educated radio hosts, religious television luminaries, and even people who have published blogs.  Rather than having to drudge through hours of fact-finding, the narration clearly explains it all for you while you watch lovely footage of the narrator's children hanging their heads in prayer or historical footage of Hitler's Marxist rallies and his Obama-like government rule.  Flowcharts are often used to clearly illustrate how Marx created the politics of feminism, homosexuality, and diversity - sicknesses which viciously attempt to undermine the universal tolerance of our national Christian beliefs.  Luckily this film is also unsullied by the obviously biased opinions of blacks or jews or anyone from the ""diversity"" movement, favoring instead strong Biblical perspectives of caucasian men and the very late Phyllis Schlafly.

Why political correctness is the new virtue that everyone today must possess. Why anything can be said about Christianity but not ""that"" other religion. And the list can go on.

4232308,5,B003Z3CZGG,"""AGENDA"" Confirmed something I learned in 1961 in a Navy boot camp. An instructor there predicted where this country would be ""directed"" from then right up to the present - almost in the order that it has happened. America's downfall began with a simple experiment, to see how Americans would respond to an attack on a subject considered ""normal"" to our educational system. ""Prayer in our public schools."" Enter one ""Madlyn Murray O'Hare"" an avowed Communist, with a son in the Baltimore, Md. public school system. She did not want her son exposed to morning prayers at the start of the normal school day. And she voiced her opinion, loudly, and eventually to excess. She became a thorn in the side of the local school board, PTA, politicians, and eventually the lower court system. She became relentless in her pursuit, eventually taking her issue to the Supreme Court. Her press preceded her, the court listened, and caved in. She won and Americans lost, prayer would be removed from public school, not just in Baltimore - but nationwide. It became the first round fired in the assault on our freedoms, it continues today.
NOTE: Americans need to know about this movement and how to combat it. I wrote Amazon a note asking for a price on all the videos there are on topics of this kind. I have plans to show these DVD's to church groups at what I call: ""Pot luck and a movie"", dinners. America is under attack and the other side is getting bolder and more confident daily.

Even doing this as they support a centrist ideology that essentially all American legislators support. At its worst this film is outright speculation on faulty or weak pretenses. These people are trying to make you submit to a fear that almost certainly has no evidence. We live in a world the founders simply could not have not imagined any better. The fact that I can walk down the street of a major city, safe in the knowledge that there are laws to protect my property, my ideas, and even my person. Any who would refute that fact are simply wrong. This modem world we live in is so great and free that I believe either Thomas Jefferson or John Adams themselves would collapse and weep at the things they saw. Poor and rich, white and black, Christian and Muslim all working together in general harmony for the better good of themselves and everyone around them. Our differences make us stronger. You tell me their experiment has not succeeded and that it continues to improve everyday. The president is merely a small, and even weak, part of our great system that seeks to keep our rights protected. Not some head of a cabal to destroy them, which our nearly 250 years of laws and precedence would venture to say they would fail at every turn to destroy them. Think before you speak people, use your your natural human reason to look at what you are saying. Don't let these warmongers and oppressors put thoughts in your head, what do YOU think is right?

The DVD title is self-explanatory, and the hammer and sickle are a big clue.

Accordingly, those who believe in the ideas of America's founding fathers should buy this DVD to be better informed/prepared citizens.  However, those who follow the European Marxist/socialist/communist/liberal/progressive (MSCLP) agenda will hate it, so they should not waste their money buying it.  Although the DVD is well researched and documented, the MSCLP followers most likely will attack it as a twisted fabrication of lies.  You can be the judge of truthfulness yourself by reading some of the key reference books given in the DVD, such as ""Naked Communist"" and ""Black Listed by History"" both by credible authors who did a lot of hard work preparing their books.

However, it's great to see films released that are from conservatives and hit the movie theatres in an attempt to inform the general public.  What I absolutely loved about the movie is that it's not based on opinion or conjecture, but irrefutable facts. All you have to do is Google the names: Stalin; Lenin; Marx; and the rest of the socialist clowns that have unfortunately, existed, in the past, and that it's so easy to draw parallels from them to our current retard-in-chief.  America is forever lost.  I know in the movie they say there's still hope to turn around our present trajectory headed for the toilet, but we're already there... and there's too many brainwashed weak-minded FOOLS in America who buy into leftist junk-science and pseudo-science, and leftist propaganda in regards to economic and social issues.  We *might* have one more chance (but I'm not holding my breath) of pulling America out of the toilet it's been in since the 60's.  The way to do that is to elect a conservative for president in 2016, appointing two more truly conservative supreme court justices, and replacing retiring leftist senators and congressmen with conservatives.

4232436,1,B003Z3CZGG,"The premise:  key people on the left are deliberately destroying America.  That's a very inflammatory premise.  First, what do you call ""destroying"" America?  Deliberately weakening the institution of the family so that you can have people government-dependent?  Second, how do you know their motives?  Besides that it starts out with a premise about the motivation of the political left, there are three other major weaknesses in Agenda:  Grinding America Down:  1) A family tree of communist radicals and their effects on America.  2) An oversimplified view of Obama.  3) An unsubstantiated connection between the Communist Party in the first half of the 1900s and the current thinking of the political left.  The presenter, Curtis Bowers, memorably says ""They're either ignorant, or evil"" and also makes points out of Saul Alinsky's written praise of Lucifer and Karl Marx's stated goal of ""dethrone God and destroy capitalism"", connecting them to the leftist agenda today.

As for #1, the documentary makes no effort to expound on how a certain communist such as Antonio Gramsci directly caused so-and-so a leftist tactic that's still in use today.  I read online that it was Glenn Beck who first presented a ""family tree"" of how Saul Alinsky supposedly directly influenced Obama, which is another thing Bowers makes a big deal of.  I did some research about Alinsky and discovered that he was not a ""communist"", but his own unique kind of leftist.  He died when Obama was 10, and his legacy and Obama's community organizing in Chicago had overlaps, but not a direct lineage.  Beyond that, Alinsky's intentions are wildly misconstrued.  The conservative media focuses on only two things about Alinsky, which are his honorable mention of Lucifer as the first rebel who won his own kingdom, and his aggressive tactics of belittling the opposing side to win sociopolitical battles.  Alinsky didn't believe in God or the Devil, and mentioned Lucifer to make a populist point about the people taking aggressive action against the establishment.  He didn't like Soviet communism and didn't like the counterculture, and he had a very pragmatic view of how to promote justice for the people against a crooked establishment, who he said will never give up their power on their own initiative.  He was leftist, but not a devil out to destroy America who passed on his tools to Obama.  He is hardly the first to invent the hardhitting strategy which Hillary Clinton and Obama have employed, and the most I can say that is common between them all is a sense of moral relativism, that ethics are secondary to the goal.

About #2:  I have followed the divide in America closely, and sadly, the American people are as divided in 2014 as they were in 2008 on how they view Obama.  Some leftists think conservatives are suspicious because of Obama's black skin, and some conservatives think Obama is a communist who is deliberately trying to destroy America.  I have concluded, after all my research, which included this documentary and much more, that Obama is best described as a far-left secular humanist.  He considers himself a Christian in that he likes the social justice of the Bible, but he makes no secret of his disdain about taking the Bible literally on things like homosexuality.  He learned far-left Alinsky-type community organizing tactics in Chicago, though his ideology is far more complex than trying to make government run all of society.  His attitude toward the Republican Party is filled with as much disdain as they have for him.  He is like FDR in his association with far-left radicals and his populist, direct-democracy view of how government should work.  He would rather use executive action than go through a slow legal process, and also focuses heavily on developing his cult of personality (again like FDR).  He adopts all the far-left views about abortion, homosexuality, transgender ""rights"", having porous borders, spending money to prevent climate change, etc.  Why complicate it on this documentary by saying Obama is a communist plant who hates America?  He has very unbiblical values and, to win votes, resorted to dishonesty, accusing Romney (in the 3rd and final debate of 2012, I recall) of wanting the rich to play by a different set of rules (Obama is skilled in class warfare).  He frequently lies about things such as whether you can keep your health care plan, and there's evidence he won reelection by a narrow margin through voter fraud in some key states, but he sincerely believes in his agenda.

Instead of focusing on the facts, the documentary focuses on making judgments about Obama's motivation.  I grant that this was released in 2010, but even then there were enough stats or other kinds of facts to make a more substantive documentary.  The documentary believes Obama is deliberately trying to make the government take over all the country, based on a circumstantial connection of the Cloward-Piven strategy being taught at Columbia University while he was there.  Obama wants the government to have more involvement, but that doesn't mean it's all or nothing or that he's deliberately escalating the economic crisis so the government can institute martial law.  You would have to conclude every speech he gives about America's democracy and about the importance of creating new jobs is a lie, and I eventually concluded that's overcomplicating Obama.  I think it's a shame that people can't stick to the simple facts, which alone are enough to show that his administration isn't transparent, his leftist ideology is biased against Biblically minded Christians (such as on ObamaCare with regard to abortion, or the Defense of Marriage Act), and he's not a man of his word (such as ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep it"", which Charles Krauthammer explained was a deliberate untruth because Obama had the facts before he started making that claim).  Compare Obama to FDR, not to Marx.  It's much more accurate, and would make this less likely to be misunderstood as a right-wing hack job.

About #3:  The documentary makes liberalism, Marxism, socialism, communism, leftism, and progressivism all descriptors of Alinsky, Obama, and others it indicts.  It took me a long time, but I finally understood that those terms only add confusion.  Marx's economic theory wasn't even applied precisely by Lenin, nor by any other political leader.  Marx has been so popular among revolutionaries because he was so opposed to the religious and political establishment keeping the people oppressed.  (However, the 60s counterculture was more based on the sexual revolution than Marxism, though there were some overlaps.)  Marx's own thinking was a product of the Industrial Revolution.

""Radical"" is a better word to describe far-left people than ""Marxist"", because since the French Revolution, which was of course before Marx, there have been western revolutionaries who have proposed extreme social changes involving force and government control to create the perfect society.  The terminology makes this documentary somewhat of an intellectual mess because it makes all leftist thinking sound monolithic, like it's a lineage passed down from the French Revolution to Marx to Alinsky to Obama.

It'd be easy to conclude from the documentary that the secular public school system in the United States is deliberately trying to destroy morality as part of a secret communist goal.  I totally agree that secular education is a huge problem for morality in our society, but the reason is because people are left looking for their own truth when they don't have God.  Public schools' secularization was primarily due to evolution being taught, not to a communist blueprint.  A communist blueprint can't explain how schools became so anti-God prior to the establishment of the Department of Education, which began in 1980.  Is every state supposed to have followed John Dewey's leftist educational ideas because of threats by communists, prior to 1980 when education began to be dictated from Washington, D.C.?  The theory doesn't make sense.

I have respect for the people who are interviewed on this, but I feel very unsatisfied with how the documentary approached the whole subject matter.",1405382400,31,8235,5.12125748502994

4232441,2,B003Z3CZGG,"and neither can the Christian God.

There's plenty of intellectual crudities in this film, the worst being the claim by the author that Marx was a follower of Nietzsche. Karl Marx died in 1883 and Nietzsche had only his first major work published in 1882. So needless to say, Marx never knew of Nietzsche's existence, so there's no way the man could have been either inspired or repulsed by him. He would have certainly been repulsed, as Nietzsche categorically despised liberalism and conventional socialism as codified by Karl Marx. Nietzsche understood they were merely secular avatars of Christianity, the Jewish destruction of life force, and that thus they would lead to the exact nihilism this film bemoans.

The author is right about the 'leftist' agenda, but the ignores the central element, which is race, in favor of Christianism, and therefore homosexuality and feminism. They are all evil, yes, but Christianity, with its internalization of authority in the individual, and thus ironic sanctification of individual choice, leads inevitably to the leftism the author abhors. Everything then becomes about emancipation for the sake of individual expression, 'tolerance', and now we arrive at nihilism, at the bizarre situation of the tolerant intolerance of intolerance. With no point of reference beyond the formally modern individual, no once can decide on tolerance or intolerance, except that which impedes 'expression' and 'opinion', which is to say the isolated, alienated, empty individual of modern English philosophy, which underlines everything in the America constitution and its founders. The seeds of chaos are already within the text of this country's origin and everyone fails to see that, which only speaks of how utterly 'education' has failed.

So no, Reagan, Christianism, and especially the American constitution will not save you. All of that exists for the individual to say whatever they want, meaning that we can only say things that don't hurt other people's feelings. Everything else inevitably becomes hate-crime.

Obama is indeed the culmination of the Agenda. As I said, the author grossly underestimates the racial element in this conflict. Obama is a race warrior in the mold of Louis Farrakhan, Malcom X, Franz Fanon, make no mistake about that. All of his peripheral policy is contingent on the racial dynamics of the struggle between blacks and whites. If the GOP is the white party then the Democratic party is, as everyone knows,  the black party, and increasingly a general anti-white coalition of non-whites. So policies that naturally progress the status of the party, which of course occurs at the expense of its opposition, will be supported unconditionally, regardless of whether or not the black community is privy to them, gay marriage being the prime example.

And today the Agenda indeed controls all. Government is majority liberal and will only become more so. Media and entertainment of all types are exclusively liberal. NPR is state propaganda, serving show-trials for Obama daily. Education, primary and secondary are exclusively liberal, indeed existing for state reconstruction, not for religion but for whites. Because the state has criminalized white men organizing as white men for decades now, it is no longer possible for white men like our author to think of the possibility of doing so, but their instincts remain white. So when they are attacked by the Agenda, they think they can retreat to Christianity, the Tea-Party or the constitution for solace. There is no going back to that. The only way remaining is to go straight into the exact racial and sexual spoils-systems the enemy has brought to your doorstep. There is no where else for white-flight to retreat.

Any reconstitution of the country will require a transformed understanding of politics. Not further retreat into worn out Americanisms, the fraud of the constitution, Christianism or Reaganite economism.",1404345600,4,3942,5.287539936102236

4232486,3,B003Z3CZGG,"I gave it 3 stars which indicates, it's ""Okay"". However, the Okay part of this is that most people in America are oblivious to who is 'really' running the show and so any film that makes an attempt to expose how manipulated and programmed the masses are and who is partially responsible for that, is a step in a positive direction. But what bothered me was the Christian bias, as always seems to be the case, the ""holier than thou, you are either with me or against me"" attitude, so prevalent with most religions in general. That's a ""program"" in and of itself, but not for this review.

The reality is, why aren't those who run the show, from behind the curtain, those who have the financial power, addressed by the film makers? Surely they know who the real villains are. It's like the massive elephant standing in the living room.

Who runs the US Media, i.e. owns 96% of it?
Who runs the US Politicians?
Who runs the Administration?
Who has the biggest load of Lobbyists in DC?
Who runs Hollywood?
Who runs Pornography?
Who runs the US Military?
Whose job is it to keep you in debt?
Who runs Big Pharma and the AMA?
Who runs The Banking Cartel, i.e. THE CENTRAL BANKS?
WHO RUNS THE COMMUNIST PARTY?

Grinding America Down only brings up ""Bolsheviks"" two times, and mysteriously doesn't expound on them. WHY?

The Answer to ALL the above questions?

Why it's the...

ZIONIST (Bolshevik) JEWS*. (I guess the absence of this Satanic Tribe in the film indicates just how programmed the mind of the Christian is.)

Note: Why are Christians so subservient to a TRIBE that thinks of them (Goyim) as lower than donkeys?",1384387200,4,1615,4.586805555555555
4232487,5,B003Z3CZGG,"I gave this 5 stars because it has generated a tremendous amount of debate via the posted reviews on this movie and represents the obvious:

United We Stand

&

Divided We Fall

Movies that can elicit excitement, ire, fascination or repulsion are successful.  What's the definition of success in this context?  Simply put, they sell...and you bought one! lol :)

What is astounding is that the folks who vehemently disagree with this video's content are using the same, exact ""rationale"" for this video's ""ignorance"" as is witnessed by the actions of our current leader:

-Lies
-Deception
-Divisiveness
-Blame-orientation
-Non-accountability

Essentially, if one-half of the country's populous is wrong and the other half is wrong,too, then it would be prudent to conclude that no one is right and no one has the answer.  By design, this is exactly what makes Communism succeed - create divisionism and chaos amongst the masses.  I'd say we're there as the proof is in the reviews on this particular movie.  When you're waiting in line for soap, bread and butter (5 years from now) provided by the government that you will be ""taught to love,"" you'll get the wonderful opportunity of recalling this post...

Our country's lack of reckless leadership over the past 5 years has been most pronounced more-so than any other period in U.S. history.

The accuracy of this movie's correlation to our country's current problems isn't the issue - the issue at hand is that this country is falling apart at the seams and if you don't believe that then why are you paying double what you paid for groceries 5 years ago?  Hint:  doubling the federal debt decreases the purchasing power of that grubby little dollar in your hands...

Is placing blame going to help things?  Of course not, but Obama will make you believe that notion and you are simply falling into his trap & his ultimate plan - take care of himself and pretend to ""care"" about the middle class for vote retention.

Three areas of misinformation in this movie include religious principles, political party philosophies (Capitalism, Socialism, and Communism), and Culture - but that is not all. Beginning with religion; if Christianity carries the notion that judgment of others is acceptable, and that deeming others who don't share their religious or political perspectives as ""evil"" is justifiable, many Christians may consider quickly the need to convert to Hinduism or Islam; both, being religions that share the values of the golden rule - seemingly forgotten in this movie. The second area of misinformation, or delusion, involves the ideas and very definitions of political parties and the philosophies behind it. Agenda claims that Socialism is a first step toward Communism which is horrendously false. Marx, who died in 1883, indeed foresaw that Capitalist governments would later be overthrown by Socialist revolutions. However, many scholars suggest that Marx would have been pleased to see the effect of engaged democratic revolutions that can occur within a capitalist economy of a government, such as that of the United States. Those who actually know anything about Gramsci, other than his name and where he was born, realize that Agenda's sound bite collage leaves out the fact that he was an anti-communist Communist, jailed for writing against the government who he felt was corrupting true ideals of his interpretation of Communism. Revealing this intellectual depth of this piece of reality might not have been appropriate for the cognitive tipping point of the intended audience of this film. The third basic slur on social reality Agenda presents is related to the claims made regarding the nature of cultural change. The movie states that since the sixties there has been an intended political agenda, aiming to destroy the fundamental culture of this country, by a select group of people; furthermore, claiming this country as the best nation of the world. This last claim is not being addressed in this review but needs to be considered as part of the radical, Christian crusader perspective as the view this film wants to deliver - or shape. Culture, by nature, continually evolves; not only in America but everywhere. A critical thinking viewer only needs to look at the cultural shifts that have occurred in the United States alone before the sixties, due to the Industrial Revolution or the American Revolution itself, to see Agenda's claim of intended change of culture as fallacy. Culture, since the sixties through today; in this age of increased flow of economy, mobility, information, and ideology has indeed changed - everywhere! Agenda is a necessary film to see the effects propaganda can play on a population somewhat comparable to Michael Moore films but with less explicit data made available to back up claims made in his films.

From my perspective, government no longer governs the United States National and Multi-National Corporations do. This movie could be reframed placing the label of ""Communists"" on the multinational corporations and its enslaved unaware consumers.",1381622400,2,3215,5.31630648330059

A critical thinking viewer only needs to look at the cultural shifts that have occurred in the United States alone before the sixties, due to the Industrial Revolution or the American Revolution itself, to see Agenda's claim of intended change of culture as fallacy. Culture, since the sixties through today; in this age of increased flow of economy, mobility, information, and ideology has indeed changed - everywhere! Agenda is a necessary film to see the effects propaganda can play on a population somewhat comparable to Michael Moore films but with less explicit data made available to back up claims made in his films.",1381536000,3,2968,5.2505263157894735

The US Republic has the only government that allowed everyone the opportunity to reach as high as they could.  Yes, we have the same number of poor but they are not the same people.  Many poor people rose to become the wealthy in our society.  Anyone who believes any other government would allow this to happen is kidding himself.  And you can never have equal sharing of all things because some people work hard and others make no effort at all.  When you take from the ones working hard and give to the lazy, the hard workers eventually realize they are working to support the lazy and they just start working less.  The analogies of a class where some students studied hard and got A's and others didn't study and failel where the professor attempts to equalize them by giving everyone a 'C' perfectly demonstrates the point.

This film takes a hard line stance that if you aren't a conservative Republican Christian, then you are a communist or communist sympathizer.  So there's that.  And that's about it, it takes 45 bullet points from the book the Naked Communist, and tells you that they have come true or are coming true.  That book was written by Cleon Skousen and he was exactly the kind of person this movie is playing to, a white conservative, ""faith-based"" political theorist that was also a member of the John Birch Society.  The John Birch Society used to like to paint with the same broad, red brush of communist labeling as this film does.  Did you know the civil rights movement was created by communists? The JBS knew that, I don't think MLK did though.  I know, crazy huh it's almost like labeling today's President as a communist...
And this is why this movie is nothing but a lazy sudo-documentry about villainizing everyone from the Jewish to blacks to Muslims, to gasp, liberal Christians. If that scene with the push board full of articles, math formulas, and strings from A Beautiful Mind were turned into a movie, this might be it, without the math.  It's like a Glen Beck wet dream put to film, the left has torn apart the fabric of America, the black family, all families, and allowed feminism to rise. I guess ending segregation, providing for the poor, and asking for equal pay for both genders is bad.
This is what happens when someones community revolves around a church and everyone thinks the same. Everyone else is an outsider, no matter what ideas you might share, if it's not everything you're a pariah.  Now that's Un-American.",1379635200,9,1848,4.612804878048781

The very survival of Western Civilization is at stake. The evil is Marxism and their kindred spirits in the Democrat party, which has been usurped by Socialists and hard-core Communists. The Republican Party too has crossed from slightly right of center to half-way between the Marxists and the Center. They will continue their move leftward unless we put a stop to it now.

Every Christian in America should watch this dvd to see just how far the socialist, Marxist, and communist agendas have permeated our churches--many times unwittingly.  This film helps the viewer understand how the diabolical agenda and schemes used by the Obama administration, along with crony communists, are helping the United States to stumble into moral and spiritual depravity, state sponsored education filled with ""state"" propaganda, and economic destruction due to massive amounts of ""big government"" regulation that discourages business.  It also shows how the ""uneducated"" masses who have become dependent upon ""big government"" handouts (welfare) are unknowingly helping to destroy our nation.  This film is definitely a ""wake up call"" to anyone who loves the United States and wants our country to remain safe and strong.  Highly recommended!",1377475200,5,1153,5.377777777777778
4232518,5,B003Z3CZGG,"This is a must-see movie for everyone who values their freedom and who wonders what has brought on the steep decline of Christian morality in the United States and the resulting societal breakdown.  Although this documentary mainly addresses goings on in the United States, I believe the information is relevant to all of us in the western world.

Some of the claims will seem sensational, such as that there has been a conspiracy in the last few decades to change America from the inside into a communist country.  It is even claimed that Obama himself is one of these conspirators.  This may seem hard to believe and I wasn't sure what to think of it at first, but the people making these claims do not seem to be kooks.  They appear to be rational people who have done a lot of research on the issue.

Curtis Bowers claims to have attended a communist meeting back in 1992, in which he witnessed members of that organization mapping out how they were going to ""use public policy to subvert America from the inside"".  These strategies included promoting ""cohabitation instead of marriage"", putting young children into government programs as early as possible, and promoting the feminist movement as a way of destroying the family.  The organization also planned to use environmentalism in order to destroy business.  Finally, they decided that the best way to remove religion was to destroy the Christian view of morality by getting homosexuality to be generally accepted as normal.

Now let me ask you, what have we seen happen in the last twenty years or so?  All these things have come to pass and have been eroding away our culture little by little.  Is it so hard to believe that this was done on purpose?  For me, there is little question that it was.  These radicals have infiltrated Hollywood, the news media, public schools, and government, and little by little, they have been successful at implementing their devious agenda.

This is an important film and I had hoped to purchase it from this site since it is not available on amazon.ca.  Unfortunately amazon.com says they are ""not able"" to ship it to me here in Canada.  Not sure why that is the case because I think those who live outside the United States should be able to see the film as it applies to them too.  Fortunately, it is available online ""free to watch for a limited time"" and so I feel fortunate to have been able to see it.",1377216000,10,2405,4.672209026128266

4232527,1,B003Z3CZGG,"The creator of this confusing video has to be both admired and derided; Admired, because his patriotism is apparent, but derided because his theories are cockamamie and his solutions are risible and impotent.

His operating hypothesis seems to be that almost all of the goals of Communism have now been implemented in the United States, i.e. moral anarchy, de-Christianization, federal supremacy, socialism, etc., which is entirely true. He enlists an impressive cast of Old Right activists, officials and thinkers to confirm and elucidate this idea. What is not true is his not-so-subtle implication that it is all the result of an intentional Communist (not just Communist-inspired or influenced) plot to subvert and conquer this country.

Ok, so we can respectfully disagree about the cause of this historically unprecedented moral, political and economic revolution, but why don't we table that discussion and talk about what we have to do to stop the people who are harming us. What should we_do_to remove the people who have deceitfully taken over a nation and are in the process of literally destroying it and enslaving us? What is the answer of the filmmaker? He does have an answer, and it is this: to buy this film and show it to all your friends!

I exaggerate a bit; he also wants you to write your Congressman.

Such a naive and impotent ""solution"" speaks volumes about the incredible political stupidity of the Right, whose sacred nostrum from of old has been to ""wake people up."" If that solution ever had a prayer, it expired sometime in the 60s. Even when the attitudes of the majority reflected conservative values, it could not be parlayed into real electoral change, both because the corrupt populace still wanted their federal goodies and because the corrupt politicians did what they wanted without fear of an ignorant electorate (e.g. open borders). Now, after decades of Leftist domination in academia, the media, the bureaucracy, and the culture as a whole, our overlords have produced a people literally crying out for the yoke, if not the guillotine. To seal the deal, our masters have deliberately imported untold millions of reliable Third World helots into America to numerically overawe the natives and make their violent and parasitic contribution to the general decline. And still these Right Wing fools seriously posit that our magic solution to a brutal dictatorship is to get 51% of the vote in some election??-- as if that were still even possible! The conserva-clowns still think this is America!

Let us not be simpletons- electoral change is simply not possible anymore. It's simple math. Add up all the people who are somehow financially dependent on the System or who ideologically believe in it and you are left with a_very_small percentage of the population who would even be willing to vote for Right Wing candidates. With the Democratic victory in reducing Americans to minority status through unlimited Third World immigration, it is game, set and match. But as we know, it is motivated minorities who change history, not 51% of the vote. So shall we meekly bend our necks to what the filmmaker rightly regards as a Satanic dictatorship and go gently to the re-education camps and gas chambers? Or, shall we- like Thomas Jefferson advised- utilize the one argument that tyrants understand, the one tactic from which all power flows- force. Shall the Right Wing finally use that Second Amendment that it purports to love, but never exercises?

""And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand? After all, you knew ahead of time that those bluecaps were out at night for no good purpose. And you could be sure ahead of time that you'd be cracking the skull of a cutthroat. Or what about the Black Maria sitting out there on the street with one lonely chauffeur -- what if it had been driven off or its tires spiked. The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt"" Alexander Solzhenitsyn",1375315200,20,4693,4.896855345911949

`Jewish heritage is American heritage,' says Biden
Aaron Kalman - Times of Israel
May 22, 2013, 9:15 am

US vice president delivers gushing speech at Democratic Party's Jewish heritage month event, credits Jews with social change on gay rights

""Speaking at the Jewish Heritage Month reception of the Democratic National Committee, Joe Biden credited Jewish people in Hollywood for changing the culture of America. He said Jews are responsible for 85% of America's changing attitude on homosexual marriage. ""Think -- behind of all that, I bet you 85 percent of those changes, whether it's in Hollywood or social media, are a consequence of Jewish leaders in the industry.""

""Jewish heritage has shaped who we are - all of us, us, me - as much or more than any other factor in the last 223 years. And that's a fact,"" said Biden.

Joe Biden also credited Jews with playing a major role in the feminist movement and changing America's immigration policies to allow for massive third world immigration.""",1370822400,2,1073,5.0

One May Day, despite our Post Commanders orders that everyone was restricted to post, I was one of many that managed to sneak off post to watch a Communist rally to listen to their rantings. Afterward I talked to one of their speakers (one on one) who told me that Americans ""were stupid"". He explaind this as to the fact that Americans have semi-ridgid ""time lines"" for anything and everything we do. He said that Communist have only one time line and that was to win with their political philosophy.

4232561,2,B003Z3CZGG,"""Agenda: Grinding Down America"" is not without merit. There are some good points made by Bowers in his film - things that I wish many Obama supporters were aware of:

  -President Obama has connections to communist/socialist groups, who greatly influenced his ideology
  -Big government has a history of abusing its power
  -A majority of the 45 goals found in ""The Naked Communist"" (from 1963, not 1958 as Bowers claims) have been achieved

However, the documentary is filled with big claims supported by shoddy research. It scares me that there are so many 5-star ratings here on Amazon.

Ultimately, Curtis Bowers has produced a propaganda piece that caters strictly to his worldview. Under normal circumstances I would say that he is just a man with a good heart who unfortunately made some mistakes - however, I feel a point can be made by holding him up to his own standard of judgement. Bowers is either ignorant, or he is evil.

The documentary operates under the following assumptions:

  -Fundamentalist Christianity is 100% true
  -Most people are stupid
  -The political spectrum is one-dimensional
  -America's founding fathers were moral, religious people, who had consensus
  -The free world rides on America's military power
  -There are no redeeming qualities to socialism

It tells the following blatant lies:

  -Government schools are not teaching basic reasoning processes (logic, data from history, science, mathematics)
  -Those who believe in the Bible always stand up for the preciousness of every life
  -Fear of nuclear energy is irrational
  -A socialist America cannot return to capitalism
  -The whole global warming idea was a farce

An effective critique of the film was put out by Gary North (a bit of a nut himself, but his points are valid). He basically addresses Bowers' misinformation on communist history and literature.

4232598,5,B003Z3CZGG,"Those who destroy America, are they ignorant or evil? Well, here is where this movie truly shines, because the explanation is between the two types of people who are in the process of fundamentally changing our nation. Useful idiots that Lenin spoke off or socialists, those who pretend to create grand new ideas of failed society of the past and then you have those who actually aim to destroy America, they know what they are preaching to the rest who just follow blindly.

The movie goes into details and explanation on the socialist take over. The agenda that was introduced in multiple publications by the radical left and then followed through by social changes and actions. One of the books that is mentioned in the film is ""The naked communist"" and the goals from 1958. Take a look at the listed goals and how successful they have been, the communists, by changing the talking points and some of the 'values' that are nothing more than the change in the way most people perceive 'better' America, but in reality are voting and following to repeat the same failed historical disasters of socialism through tyranny.

""The goal of socialism is communism"" - Vladimir Lenin. Socialism creates ground work for someone like Stalin or Hitler to come in and take over, and that is what the movie make comparison to with very solid, very factual data and examples. The movie mentions names of people who are outspoken members of the communist and socialist parties of America. They are the people who strive to destroy capitalism and bring on Marxism. They are the same people who are patiently plotting what Stalin said ""America is a healthy body. We will never destroy it from the outside, but we will have to destroy it from within"". Those radical left wing ideology and agenda driven people are doing just that. Their goal is to destroy God, so that the people believe only in government. Their object is to destroy the traditional family, demonize the parents and create belief that government knows best. They are the same people who preach to our kids through school and college via brainwashing, rather than teaching. They are the same people who follow the words of Karl Marx, that we need to start to educate the children from birth and as per my background, in Soviet Union they did just that. The people who are out to create a socialist nation are taking over education, media and social environment, so that they are able to push emotional social justice, since it sounds better, but in reality socialism.

Our nation has been strong due to morality, without which we are vulnerable to be taken over by our enemies. Morality is our nation's biggest strengths. It always has been. Our freedoms of religion or non religion is what made us great. Our founders believed in God, but they provided groundwork for those who choose not to, those same people who in most cases demonize religion, because it makes people stand for other aspect in life than the government provided belief system. ""My object in life is to dethrone God and destroy capitalism"" - Karl Marx, father of modern communism. Socialists and communists know that where there is family and God, there is no place for government created equality and there is no place for tyranny. Marx, Lenin, Stalin and other tyrants used one of their strategies to create Government dependency through desperation of the people by devaluing God and elevating man. Our values and rights come from god, but socialists, by destroying that value system, create collective thinking that it comes from men, from government.

Now the pledge is not to our nation, but to the world. Celebrating the world than our own nation. We see it in schools, in other places of learning that instead of praising our great nation, the last beacon of freedom and hope, the left makes kids praise the world and give up on our sovereignty. Socialists through their ongoing name changing, create  a generation of people who do not just want a big government, but need a big government to take care of them. People with no character, are being created through the system, not to be able to take care of themselves. If you have a major part of people in that mindset, it is the tipping point of out nation.

Even some environmentalists, such as Patrick Moore one of the founders of Green Peace, left his organization when he realized that the radicals use environment to destroy capitalism. The socialists listed points and slowly making sure that every point is being followed through with. Environmentalists like Patrick Moore realized that, but most like Al Gore use it as a tool. Use it to create tyranny and dependency. Every socialist, communist and anti American organization and its core members point to Obama and his administration. Their point and their vision was always to put one of their own into the White House and they have succeeded.

Organizing for America is one of the points made in the movie that needs to be understood. The socialists will use all kind of patriotic words to pretend that they are doing something for America. Communists will feed of socialists and uninformed, then they will step in and take over, wipe out the useless if they have to or as Lenin called them ""Useful Idiots"", those who mirror and echo what the others are feeding them through emotional theoretical thinking. Communists know that if those people betrayed their own country, those useful idiots will betray them as well, so socialists and uninformed are expendable. Stalin did it and those closest to him were the first to be exiled, imprisoned or executed.

The radical left are the enemy. They are not all the misunderstood uninformed Americans, but those who do know what they are doing, they are the enemy. The very informed socialists and communists are not just some Americans with different ideas than ours, they are aiming to do only one thing, they want to overthrow this country and make it a socialist nation that enslaves vast majority.

Is it too late? No, not yet. It is never over until it is over. We still have a chance, but we have to take it, otherwise we will end up like Germany in the 30s. The left doesn't care who is in the office, democrat or republican, because the socialists push their agenda and it is time to push back.

What can we do? Get educated. Read. Understand their philosophy. Pay attention. Believe and stand up for our true American values. Be ready to be criticized. MLK Jr said that if you are being criticized, then there is a cause. Abe Lincoln said ""silence makes cowards out of best of man"", so we need to be speaking out. We have an obligation to speak the truth.

Lenin said ""the organized minority will beat disorganized majority every time."" We are right now are disorganized majority and we are losing the fight. Organizing is the main key. Within your community or where people have the interest and willing to fight back. Use media, blog, social media to raise awareness and drive your message. Graciously, but consistently make contact. Don't waste time on those who would not stand up for their country. Our own children and our own family need to be taught and protected with facts and information. Parents need to have positive influence on their kids, otherwise the youth will get that influence somewhere else.

Never ever lose sight of one individual American. They can have an impact of magnifying effect. Bowers states that conspiracy is an evil plan by a few, where the agenda is a list of things to get done by a group. The left have an agenda, a list of things to be done. Their agenda is causing us to be called evil for calling the actual evil as evil. Their agenda and their plan is working and it has to stop. If America falls, who will stand up to the evils in the world. Free will is no longer going to be available anywhere. If we go down economically, then we go down militarily and then who will stand up for freedom and then the world losses free will for a very long time.

This film opens your eyes and your mind. If you knew some of it, you are on the right path and if you didn't know any of the facts that are presented by this movie, then perhaps you need to start getting educated and watch this movie closely. This is a very important film and I highly recommend it.",1362441600,2,8288,4.6879725085910655

He explains very well how Socialism is spread by the KGB by infiltrating education, media, and politics, quite identically to the way our domestic Communists execute their brianwashing as indicated in ""Agenda: Grinding Amerca Down"".",1361923200,2,1220,5.009852216748769

To the 162 people so far who have given this documentary a 5-star rating, I welcome you to read my review on my blog[...]. In a nutshell, as a small child I was taught never to lie. Growing up, I learned the hard way when lying about others. Whether you're a Christian or of some other faith, I think it's safe to say that if you believe in morals and values then you believe in the power of lies and the damage they cause. What Curtis Bowers presents is not a documentary based on good research. It's a propaganda piece based on imaginary lines and full of lies. It's irresponsible and, frankly, un-Christian. Rather than lying about other human beings, we need to realize that change is inevitable, agree on the reality of the world we live in, and start having a dialogue that is based on ""real"" truth and not lies.",1360972800,26,892,4.439024390243903

What this film does is show you exactly what Obama meant by ""fundamental transformation"", why he feels the hatred toward traditional America that he so obviously feels, and how he intends to punish us for what he thinks we have done to the world.

4232619,5,B003Z3CZGG,"We are in trouble unless parents and grandparents start teaching their kids what Communism really is. I suggest a book called ""MIG Pilot."" It's a biography of a Russian MIG pilot who found life unbearable in the Soviet Union, even though his was ""rich"" and elite by most standards because he had an apartment and did not have to share it with anyone but his wife and child.

The book starts out with an exciting escape as he takes flight and heads straight for Japan. Today he lives in the U.S. with a new identity. Yes, they would kill him if his cover was blown. This man had no shoes as a child. No one cared if he starved. As an adult, his co-workers and superiors were alcoholics. No one that he knew was allowed to make even the simplest decision to repair equipment, hold a meeting or even dig a ditch without approval from Moscow, which could take months or years. Complain, and you would find yourself in jail. Argue with a teacher and she makes a permanent mark in the record that follows you all your life. Everyone is an informer.

Under Communism, you can't even trust your own family members. No one is able to speak frankly in the privacy of their own home. No one has enough of anything. When people do manage to get in a position of power, they use it for selfish reasons. No one thinks of the good of their fellow man. The system treats people like animals and beats them down. God is forbidden.

Communism is always the same. A small group of selfish people run everything from the capital city. Millions of people die. Food is scarce. Everyone lives in fear.

I recommend you give this video to every school teacher you know. They are unwittingly conditioning kids to accept Communism. This is through no fault of their own. They are being constantly spoon fed communist ideas in the guise of ""scientific"" news related to their jobs. Teachers need to find some alternative to the Communist inspired workshops they attend several times a year.

Not only are teachers taught to condition their kids to socialism, they are also taught outright lies about how children learn. Communists put forward faulty teaching methods because they WANT American children to fail academically.",1358899200,3,2196,4.634961439588689

Our country is at a crossroads, and sadly, the country our fathers and grandfathers fought and died for is heading down the slippery slope into socialism. We are perilously close to losing the right to be called Land of the Free...Is it too late? Are we past the point of no return? When this video was made some in this video believe so.

I have spent many years researching and linking things together to try and find out why the direction of our country is in such a bad state. This ties much of it together in a way that most movies never do. It has the common denominator if you will. There are some brilliant minds in this movie. You will need to be proactive at writing down things mentioned in this movie and researching them more, especially the Congressional Progressive Caucus or CPC and the CPUSA. You will see the that the end result of true Communism is widespread death brought about by what Lenin calls ""useful idiots"". There are many people that don't even know they are helping such a terrible cause. With all of America's faults we are still the greatest nation ever in the history of the world. Protect her by being informed and not ignoring the truth that is right in front of your eyes and then pass it along to a friend. We can save America by educating one another and then taking action.

I did not see anywhere in the movie that we were to attack or hate our fellow brothers but to be on guard.  I believe we Christians are the Eve in the Garden of Eden, Satan will use love for his agenda, just like a drug pusher.  Once you are his then you find it wasn't love but a lie to push his agenda (I believe men are accused of using that line on women).  After viewing this movie I have drawn closer to Christ and prayed hard on what I'm suppose to do with this information.  I pray that all who view this movie use it to reflect on who comes first in their life, God or your political party.  I will be up front with you, I'm a conservative and I see this movie in both parties, that's why I pray that you reflect on your relationship with God, not attacking your brother.  Can anybody tell me that after reading the Bible that man has become anymore enlightened after 2000 years, also aren't we still dealing with the same issues that Paul was dealing with in the church.

I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ, but I am completely ashamed of this film and its total oversight of core Christian values such as loving your neighbor, for example, something that might actually help this country.

I always laugh at people who think there is a conspiracy..  no one could plan and execute it I thought but I am starting to have my doubts. Maybe all the things that have happened in the last 50 years, The things that we would all be embarassed to tell our founding fathers or even our great grand parents, were part of a plan to weaken us as a society?

I am doing my own research but so far I cannot object to anything in the film.

This would explain why today nothing useful is taught in schools. No one knows how to do anything in the real world after graduation.

Not in the movie but something I couldn't help think- can anyone in America raise their own food 100% if needed or are we all to far removed from the basics to know what to do without a store full of supplies? Could todays farmers even raise their own food if they needd to and they couldn't buy seed or fertalizer?

I made my whole family watch it together and discuss it; then I passed the DVD to neighbors.  I frankly wanted to hold a townhall meeting to watch it as a community but that may be a copyright infringement so I didn't do it.

However, although the film talks about an evil totalitarian regime infiltrating the US and the rest of the world, I believe the author/producer is using the word 'communism' wrongly and out of context.  The word Bowers should have used is 'Fascism', fascism is slowly taking over the world, not communism.  He is wrong to suggest that this evil fascist agenda is communism, when in fact both fascism and communism are actually opposite each other in the political scale, not bunched together, as he would make us believe.  This clearly is a misunderstanding on his part of the true definitions of these idealogies.  Fascism supports capitalism, not communism.  You only need to actually read 'The Communist Manifesto' to realise that fundamental communism is quite possibly an unworkable utopian ideal, totally grounded in humanitarinism, not a dictatorship or totalitarian ruling government.  However, fascism does steal ideas from other idealogies and therefore this could be where the confusion arises.  Matthew Lyons defines the difference between fascism and communism well.  It appears that we are being taken over by fascism, which is very scary, which is far worse than the old feudal system and what the media would like you to believe communism to be.  But we also need to ask ourselves, why is Bowers not using the word 'fascism', why is he telling the public that this evil spreading over the world is communism and is the opposite of capitalism and the so called free world/market.",1337558400,9,1540,5.14859437751004

The effort has been underway in our schools and aimed at our children and their children and is also an on-going attack on Jewish and Christian beliefs, institutions,  and places of worship.

Though I felt that Curtis bowers relied mostly on the religious aspect there were some startling sources and facts. The fact that there is a communist party in America that has meetings is a bit unnerving. Again how he lays out the communist hunny do list and how many of them have been checked of or are in the near future of being checked off has me startled but I also think that some of these events are just part of progression. the whole idea that making gay marriage legal as part of a communist threat is silly to me because I thought in our very Constitution it says all men are created equal and I don't see a problem with loved ones being able to have the same rights as others, that's all it is about not the idea of desecrating marriage, just rights as people to sit in the hospital room as someone dies. I have gay friends and they are the nicest most unjudgemental people and to think that they are communist is just silly.

(In the 1990s) ... ""secular humanists became the new enemies menacing America for the far right wing.

___________________________________________

In Curtis Bowers' ""Agenda""  he claims that ""cultural Marxism"" is an element in ""grinding America down."" As you will see in my following review, this is a conspiracy theory originating from the extremist fringe. It is not a an attribute of the disparate American left. Nevertheless, ""cultural Marxism"" fueled the rage Norwegian nationalist Anders Brevik, who studied US white far right wing websites. ""Cultural Marxism"" became a motivator for his violent terrorism. He acquired a gun and stalked and murdered 70 Norwegian children at a youth camp, stunning Norway and the world. This Scandinavian equivalent of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh drank from the same poisoned wells as Curtis Bowers. I dedicate my review to the memory of those murdered children.

Idaho's Curtis Bowers, the maker of ""Agenda,"" came of age in a far right wing, fervently anti-communist milieu. A ""culture war conservative"" Republican in 2007, he was appointed by Gov. Butch Otter to fill a vacant legislative seat. During his term, Rep. Bowers penned op-ed columns in the Idaho Statesman. In Jan., 2008, he strangely chronicled his ""infiltration"" of a Communist Party USA convention at UC Berkeley in 1992 --  two years AFTER the collapse of the USSR and East Bloc. 16 years latter Rep. Bowers told his readers that the CPUSA decided to promote 3 issues, ""feminism, environmentalism and gay rights,"" and now in 2008, communists and a cluster of progressives were near success in these goals. His editorial was titled, ""Communist agenda makes its way to our mainstream.""

Those who know communism's history will recognize that these 3 issues were never part of official communist ideology. Feminism, environmentalism and gay rights each arose separately at different times, under different historical circumstances - APART from communism.

Even in conservative Idaho, Rep. Bowers' editorial was over the top, and the non-elected legislator was lambasted & mocked. Constituents demanded he focus on his job and cease conspiratorial editorializing. Rep. Bowers fired back: ""Any .... individual that tries to label a difference in opinion .... as 'hateful' should kindly remember this isn't the Soviet Union YET.""

Up for re-election later that year, Rep. Bowers was defeated by another Republican. Undeterred by this repudiation, he felt called to warn of a vast communist conspiracy imperiling America. God told him to do it, Mr. Bowers has said, and he chose film as his vehicle. In preparation, Mr. Bowers attended a 20-hour weekend workshop sponsored by the fundamentalist nationalist christianist San Antonio International Christian Film Festival. (SAICFF is a subsidiary of Vision Forum Ministries, a neo-Calvinist church that promotes Biblical patriarchy, creationism, home schooling, and the Quiverfull movement. Quiverfull advocates  ""raising up God's warriors"" to defeat ""progressives"" via white conservative families rejecting contraceptives to produce large families. Mr. & Mrs. Bowers have 6 children.) The workshop inspired Mr. Bowers to research, write, act, direct, produce, and serve as cameraman, even enlisting his family to work on and appear in ""Agenda."" Marcus Hackler, Bryce James and Dustin La Mont are also credited.

Mr. Bowers submitted his film to the 2010 SAICFF, winning ""1st prize,"" $101,000, and a standing ovation from the virtually all-white audience.  He attributed the award to his 6 kids fasting and praying on Fridays. ""Agenda"" soon appeared on the internet and gained interest because the film coincided with the white far right wing backlash against Pres. Barack Obama. To date nearly 90,000 copies of ""Agenda"" are in circulation, mainly within white far right wing circles (conveniently, WFRW). Not all on the far right were favorable. The self-styled economist and historian Gary North (Ludwig von Mises Institute) said ""Agenda's"" insistence that communism posed an imminent threat was not an accurate assessment of US society and politics.

Running 93 minutes ""Agenda's"" complex conspiratorial narrative is supplemented by 22 pseudo-experts. The film indicts Pres. Obama, and Democrats in general, along with a welter of ""progressive"" organizations, as agents of a vast communist conspiracy against ""our"" families, business and culture. And ""they"" are doing this in plain sight, but undetected .... except by godly conservatives who have found ""them"" out.

Endorsing ""Agenda,"" the FNC  website, ""Christian Worldview,"" said the film ""details how a man-based and Bible-rejecting worldview based on socialistic and communistic ideas is permeating American society and affecting everything: morality, economics, education, government, family, and even religion."" It was also praised on the conservative Movieguide: ""AGENDA is absolutely brilliant for its well-researched understanding of the issues. It is must viewing. .... a great documentary."" Neither CW or Movieguide, however, addressed or challenged any of the specifics of the film.

Mr. Bowers' success within the confines of the FNC WFRW notwithstanding, the film is highly misleading, error-filled and fear-fueled throughout. In addition, ""Agenda"" is a case study in the paranoid style of US politics, as defined by historian Richard Hofstadter, and is especially objectionable in its misuse and misrepresentation of history. Instead of citing accomplished professional historians, economists, and political scientists, and weighing their positions, Mr. Bowers turned to discredited extremist texts like Cleon Skousen's 1958 ""The Naked Communist,"" an amateur Cold War history of communism infused with Red Scare era conspiracies. He also relies on American communist William Z. Foster's ""Toward Soviet America"" from 1932. Published during the Depression it made outlandish claims for a communist triumph in the US. During the 1960s, TSA was rescued from the trash heap of history and re-printed - not by the CPUSA, but the WFRW. It has surfaced again as ""evidence"" for a current communist conspiracy  - an 80-year career for a book that was wrong when first published. ""Agenda"" shows throughout no original research or analysis; Bowers simply daisy-chains old WFRW fables and recent falsehoods and conspiracies to construct his film.

""Agenda"" gets its momentum from bursts of historical footage, interspersed with back-to-back WFRW interviewees -- pseudo-experts from the lunatic fringe. (The `agendadocumentary' website lists them.) The historical footage, however, is a mash-up, mostly unidentified, and often does not match the script. Moreover, the interviewees have been very tightly edited, one rapidly succeeding the other. This pace drives Mr. Bowers' assertion that a vast conspiracy is near success, BUT leaves more objective viewers suspecting that the talking heads have been selectively edited, de- and re-contextualized. I give ""Agenda"" ONE STAR, because it fails to document its communist conspiracy, and is wrong on numerous other points. One thing it documents very well, however, is the state of WFRW paranoia in ""the age of Obama.""

In the remainder of my review, I will critique select elements from ""Agenda."" These are representative examples of the film's misleading and false narrative. Limited space bars a detailed critique; its abundant falsehoods are too numerous for a point by point rebuttal.

INTRODUCTION: The film opens with a quote attributed to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin that America ""will collapse from within."" I found no historically verifiable sources for this quote; it is false, and, typically, only repeated on other WFRW conspiracy web sites. It is deployed to create the impression Stalin ""foresaw"" the outcome the WFRW and Mr. Bowers warn against.

This is followed by a 50 year-old segment of Ronald Reagan from a black & white TV program. Reagan, then a Westinghouse spokesman, is re-contextualized by Mr. Bowers a half century later to be his ""spokesman"" for ""Agenda."" Next come the WFRW pseudo-experts, conspiratorially warning of ""America's enemy"" as an unidentified ""they"" - a suspense generator.

This leads to Mr. Bowers' recollection of the CPUSA convention, where the ""3 goals"" he claimed hearing weren't believed by him to be reachable back in 1992. He also says ""the environmental movement"" was then not powerful. Untrue in 1992. First, there has never been a monolithic environmental ""movement,"" but rather, since the 1960s, a growing social concern to balance US economic life with care for the natural world & its resources. Second, by 1992 a large number of business, government and citizen organizations WERE ALREADY addressing environmental issues on many fronts & for different purposes. Third, bi-partisan national environmental legislation dates to the 1950s; the growing awareness of industrial pollution prompted the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency by Pres. Richard Nixon in 1970. By 1992 it had been developing policies for more than 20 years.

Mr. Bowers next introduces Cleon Skousen's ""The Naked Communist,"" which he consulted as a legislator. (See my 1-star review of TNC - ""Zombie Text."") Upon reading Mr. Skousen's alleged agenda of ""45 goals needed for a communist takeover of America,"" he became convinced that TNC's warnings from the 1950s were prophetic for a communist takeover more than 50 years later. TNC helped Mr. Bowers connect his 1992 Berkeley visit to his belief in a present-day conspiracy. Mr. Skousen, however, made up the 45 goals. They are not found in CPUSA or Marxist-Leninist sources (see my TNC review). Because  ""Agenda"" is structured on Skousen's ""45 goals,"" the film is wrongly premised.

The film then becomes a ""quest for answers."" Mr. Bowers & his family are filmed in stages traveling to Washington DC, interviewing various WFRW pseudo-experts along the way.

Helping our fellow man is one thing, enabling or promoting the thought that the government owes us - needs to take care of us , does the opposite as it demeans our life's worth - we CAN'T take care of ourselves?  Look at the ghettos.  Does it look like the people have pride in where they live or as it came cheap, it was worth less and not taken care of?

4232730,5,B003Z3CZGG,"Communist Movement in America
  In Curtis Bowers Agenda: Grinding America Down, the policies and government of America are explored in a highly educated way.  A great deal of intelligence and critical thinking is demonstrated by Bowers (and those that he interviews), who takes the time to actually look at the current situation in America and to ask why and also to try and figure out why things are as bad as they are.  It is becoming more and more apparent that many if not most Americans are ignorant as to the way the nation is shifting into a socialist/communist nation.  The Left has been warping the minds of Americans and instilling an idealistic utopia of equality under the guise of democratic ideals. I believe they are using the very name of the Democratic Party, as it close sounding to democracy, to their advantage.  Bowers is not so fooled by the left.  He recognizes this `utopia' for what it truly is, the very same failed communistic governing system used in China and that the United States fought against in Russia.
  In communist governments the free market, that has proven the greatest system for any willing to work who is smart enough and driven enough to succeed, is destroyed. The very same free market that made the United States the greatest nation is being currently being torn apart and the evidence is in the economic condition the nation currently suffering under a Democratic president and Senate.  Those who are with the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement currently taking place, most notably in Washington, are some of the ignorant masses that are helping the Left to destroy this nation.  What is it that the occupiers want?  They want entitlement.  They believe that it is not fair for others to have great amounts of wealth and not them.  They believe they are entitled to some of that money as well.  Any person who is equipped with a self thinking brain can see that this mindset is exactly that encouraged by communism.  Communist thinking is to take from those who have more and give to others who don't. Therefore it's the producers that produce for the non-producers.  Many view this in a Robin Hood hero kind of way.  However Robin Hood was giving back to the people what was rightfully theirs and had been taken from them.  Communist take from those who have earned and give to those who have not earned and do not deserve to have what somebody else has worked hard for.  The people who are part of OWS would rather spend their time demanding to be given the wealth of others who have worked hard and succeeded as apposed to going out and doing the same for themselves.  This logic is textbook communist ideals.  I propose this however, to any who agree with the OWS mindset, if you were told that half of your paycheck was to be given to somebody else because they don't feel like working but it is not fair that they should have less than you would you be so inclined to oblige.
  Bowers video also touches on many of the things written down by communist as part of their plan to shift the nation into a communist one. As many of the steps are described a sort of chill creeps up ones spine because it is going unnoticed by most how many of those steps have already taken place since the 1950s.  One must watch the documentary in order to get the full effect of it.
  I believe Bowers does an incredible job of noting every little thing that shows how much the United States is being turned into a communist nation.  Everyone should watch Agenda: Grinding America Down as it is extremely informative and impacting. If  more people are made aware of all Bowers and the scholars in his interviews are aware of then, the United States of America may be able to be saved and brought back to its former glory as the greatest nation.

This documentary takes a look at different communist supporters and organizations throughout history and in detail describes how they, in many ways, have secretly imposed their beliefs on the rest of the world, in particular the United States.
 In this documentary Curtis Bowers, a legislator from Idaho, reflects on a communist meeting he had attended in 1992 at the request of a friend. Bowers describes how at this meeting communist supporters reveal their plan to ""subvert America from the inside."" It wasn't until fifteen years later he had realized how successful they had been in the goals they had outlined at the meeting. He goes on to connect the dots in a possibly gigantic conspiracy involving a communist takeover in the United States.
Agenda begins with a quote from the founder of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, ""America is like a healthy body and its resistance is threefold: its patriotism, its morality, and its spiritual life. If we can undermine these three areas, America will collapse from within.""

of the Commie world-view that they will use our schools, legal
system, CHURCHES, etc...against US.

A lot of people who call themselves Christians are gutless wonders and
letting this wonderful country go down the drain.

Instead this is a review of the reviews here and I'll be brief, and some of you will say this is a troll, and others will scratch your heads at what i just said.  Here goes.

Looking at the group-think among these articles, I can think of nothing more Socialist as having a completely black-and-white thinking, polarized, unanimous head-nod to this film.  That is ironic, because that is what you people fear the most.

And regarding communism, ie: public ownership of assets, if opinion is an asset and you all share it, well that's communism for you.

Last I checked, liberals were your fellow countrymen, who go to work and buy things and vote in the best interests of themselves and their neighbors.  Just. Like. You. Do.  They are participating in your society, trying to get along and do the right thing by their families and yours.  So why are they so vilified by conservatives?  Why is Mr. Obama constantly Mr. Oh-blame-uh?  You know, from the left, we could speak volumes on blaming Bush for many things-which are still happening now, constant war, the economy, but I recommend we get past the blame and just try to move forward without name-calling, blame-throwing and trying to shout louder than the next person because guess what?  That's not very neighborly, and being a good neighbor and kind citizen is a Christian value, a somewhat universal human value that is shared even by so-called communists (they tuck their kids in bed just like we do... and give money to their struggling store owner friend just like we do).

I think the real issue is Thailand and the Philippines.  Their different-from-us ideals are such a big threat to this country, they threaten to undermine everything we believe in God and morality.  They have been undermining this country for years now and soon will take over the earth.  I hope I am making my point very clear here.",1316736000,25,1971,4.719298245614035

4232749,1,B003Z3CZGG,"The basic thesis of Curtis Bowers and his documentary film Agenda: Grinding America Down is as follows:  All liberal political thought and policy and all secularizing social change in America is not driven by people's good intentions or wisdom (however foolish that ""wisdom"" may be) but by deliberate manipulation by actual Communist agents. Therefore, everyone who doesn't want the U.S. and the rest of the world to end up under a totalitarian Communist government should promote (1) traditional morality and (2) ultraconservative politics, in order to save America.

In this DVD Communist agents are said to have quite literal direct or indirect control of the following:
1. President Obama
2. Public teacher training colleges/universities and teacher unions, and through them, all public schools. No exceptions are mentioned--no Christian or conservative teachers or school administrators, and no majority-Christian school boards.
3. The environmental movement, which according to this DVD exists not to protect the environment, but entirely for the purpose of destroying free markets and all capitalist economies.
4. Any person or idea thought of as ""progressive"".
5. Any initiative to take from the wealthier and give to the poorer.
6. Any promotion of ""social justice"".
7. The feminist movement, and any lessening of male hierarchical leadership of families.
8. The Civil Rights Movement.

Note: some comments on this review have complained about its length. If you don't want detailed information about what's in Agenda: Grinding America Down (and you won't find those details in any of the favorable reviews, which I find very interesting), YOU MAY WISH TO SKIP DOWN TO MY CONCLUSIONS AT THE END OF THE REVIEW.

Mr. Bowers' evidence for his thesis [with my comments evaluating his evidence in brackets like these]:
* A meeting of Communists at Berkeley in 1992 that Mr. Bowers attended advocated an agenda of social/cultural change and the promotion of environmentalism. Based on the advance of social change and environmentalism since that time, Bowers concluded that it must have been the Communists who were driving those trends rather than other forces. [Actually, both of those trends--social/cultural change and environmentalism--were already pretty advanced even before 1992. There may have been Communists delighted by the trends, and who desired for them to continue, but it's a long stretch from what Bowers claims to have witnessed in 1992 to his  conclusion that Communists CAUSED the trends.]
* A 1958 book titled The Naked Communist, written not by a Communist but by an anti-Communist FBI agent, listed 40 alleged goals of the Communist movement including eliminating prayer in schools; discrediting the family; encouraging promiscuity and easy divorce; getting control of the schools, curriculum, and teacher associations; eliminating obscenity laws; promoting pornography; presenting homosexuality and other perversions as ""normal, natural, and healthy""; controlling the press and other media; and infiltrating churches and replacing Biblical religion with ""social religion"". [There have in fact been very disturbing (to me) changes in many of these areas since 1958. However, even at that time there was great concern among many conservatives and Christians for all of these same issues, and it did not take any secret knowledge of the Communist agenda in 1950s society to make predictions about the future trends that would develop between that time and this. Those trends likely resulted not from Communism but from people's natural desire to turn away from God and His truth. Blaming the Communists for those trends did little, and does little, to counteract the trends.]
* Both the Republican and Democratic parties have shifted leftward in recent years from their formerly centrist positions on the political continuum. [HAS this shift really occurred? I believe that it has definitely happened in the area of social issues (for example, openness to gay marriage), but I question how much of a shift there has been in Democrat/Republican positions on economics or government programs. Bowers didn't give any evidence of the shift, just declared without evidence that the shift happened.]
* A case is made that worldwide Communism is alive and well, since 1.8 billion people worldwide live under it, and since some additional nations have moved towards Communism. in Africa (Zimbabwe and South Africa) and Latin America (Venezuela, El Salvador, and Bolivia). [Though Bowers' details are correct (examples of Communist-influenced governments are Zimbabwe, South Africa, Venezuela, El Salvador, and Bolivia), his generalization is faulty. There is nothing like an effective cohesive worldwide Communist movement anymore, as there was in the days of the USSR-dominated Comintern. A great variety of mutually opposed forms of Communism exist such as capitalistic but oppressive China, strongly anti-American regimes in Latin America, and the openly anti-equality personality cult in North Korea. Any coordinated Communist influence is not significantly due to the power of those governments, but would have to have a non-governmental source, presumably vastly well-funded. Bowers didn't present ANY non-circumstantial evidence of the existence of any such present-day organization.]
* The Fabian Socialist Society founded in the 1800s is a group that has been dedicated since its inception to achieving a Socialist World by evolution rather than by Communist revolution, and is obviously succeeding. [No one disputes that this group existed and was influential in its day, but Bowers can only presume that similar-minded groups exist today and are functioning secretly and with incredible effectiveness, since he has no direct non-inferential evidence of their doing so.]
* Barack Obama [Bowers asserts] is friends with some radical figures, including Bill Ayers (co-founder and key figure in the violent radical group of the 60s and 70s known as the Weather Underground). [It remains unclear to what extent Obama's relationship with Ayers has ever been more than casual, as Bowers presents no evidence of anything more than that.] Frank Marshall Davis, a multi-faceted and Communist-influenced black radical and porn author who died in 1987, is characterized by Bowers as a key Obama mentor. [The evidence for this seems sketchy, though they were undoubtedly acquaintances--Davis WAS a good friend of Obama's grandfather.] Jim Wallis, an Obama spiritual adviser and consultant to the Obama administration, was an activist and leader in the anti-Vietnam War group Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) before founding the leftist-evangelical magazine and group, Sojourners. [Wallis IS a significant influence on the President, apparently mostly in spiritual matters. Wallis's having had a history with the SDS falls short of establishing that he is currently a Communist agent. Wallis has explicitly identified with Biblical evangelicalism, though his political views continue to be leftist, arguing from Biblical texts about justice towards the poor (we should not forget that there ARE many such texts). I personally would wish and pray for MORE, not less, spiritual influence by Jim Wallis on the President.]
* Antonio Gramsci, an influential Italian Communist who died in 1937 and never visited the U. S., was a key advocate of working for Communism through cultural transformation. He is quoted in the DVD saying, ""Destroy the West by destroying their culture."" Gramsci especially advocated using liberalized churches as tools of Communism. American 60s radical Saul Alinsky (died in 1972), author of the influential book Rules for Radicals, was particularly influenced by Gramsci and did his best to spread Gramsci's influence hugely throughout the American left. [Alinsky is said by sources other than Agenda to be an influence on Barack Obama because Obama received training in community activism through the Industrial Areas Foundation that Alinsky founded, but Bowers never connected those dots in this video. In the U.S. we DO have morally decaying culture and we DO have liberal churches preaching anti-Biblical teachings. It's good to be aware of these trends and not be taken in by them, but no real evidence is given in Agenda that the Communists have caused the trends.]
* The ""Cloward-Piven strategy"" advocated by Richard Cloward and Frances Fox Piven in an article in The Nation in 1966 advocated intentionally overloading the U. S. welfare system in order to precipitate a crisis that would lead to the replacement of the existing welfare system with a more radical system guaranteeing a certain level of annual income to all Americans [that's a true historical fact--Cloward and Piven DID advocate that strategy in The Nation]. Bowers concludes that this actually is the real reason why government social programs are being advanced, to intentionally cause the collapse of our government as we know it. [Bowers here repeats an argument more strongly associated with Glenn Beck, who does not appear and is not mentioned in Agenda. It's unclear to me that overloading to the point of governmental COLLAPSE (as opposed to merely weakening our economy) is happening, let alone that it's being done intentionally.]
* Bowers asserts that Wade Rathke of ACORN is a recent practitioner of the Cloward-Piven strategy. [Bowers didn't make a case for a strong Obama connection with ACORN, as other commentators have done, since Obama did provide them with legal aid in two cases in the 1990s. Certainly Rathke has never admitted to being a Cloward-Piven strategy practitioner, but claims to be a sincere straightforward advocate for the poor. Most conservatives would reasonably say that Rathke is misguided, but few would agree that his primary goal is attempting to intentionally collapse the social welfare system. No EVIDENCE is given by Bowers of Rathke's having a Cloward-Piven intention, such as a Rathke quote where he stated such an intention.]
* The book Towards Soviet America, written by American Communist leader William Z. Foster around 1930, and now re-printed by conservative publishers, has some correspondence with historical events which have transpired since that time. The assertions of this book are not treated in detail by Bowers except for Foster's chapter on influencing education. Bowers then shows how John Dewey, starting about the time of William Z. Foster's book, and allegedly influenced by European socialism/Communism, had a tremendous impact on American education. [John Dewey really did have a pervasive and sad influence on American education up to the present day. However, Dewey, also known as the Father of American Humanism, had been developing his atheistic relativistic man-is-the-best-god-we've-got ideas in great detail since long before Foster's book and since well before the Russian revolution. I abhor Dewey's ideas and the trends he stimulated, but I strongly doubt that his work can be explained as essentially a manipulation by the then-united Communist movement. In fact he vehemently criticized the rule of Josef Stalin, who was the dominant leader during that era of what was then a very united Communist movement, so different than the diverse, leaderless Communism of today.]
* Bowers claims that the change in the American electorate from Ronald Reagan's 1980 landslide election to Obama's victory in 2008 is due to liberal (Communist) influence through education in the intervening years. [I think the causes for this  change are probably more complex than that, though as a former public school teacher I don't deny that public education has been a significant contributor to liberalization especially in social-cultural issues, though once again I doubt that it's because of the Communists. Besides education, other liberalizing factors not mentioned by Bowers are the increasingly pervasive effects of electronic media and by the leftist-dominated entertainment industry.]

Here are some other things I was struck by in watching Agenda:
* Early in the film, a brief sequence with little comment is shown of the anti-Communist crusade of the 1950s and the U. S. Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations chaired by Joseph McCarthy. Is Bowers suggesting a renewal of the McCarthy hearings that have been criticized by many liberal historians but vigorously defended by M. Stanton Evans and some others? If not, why did he include this sequence but not explicitly advocate a revival of McCarthy's crusade? He just showed the sequence, without explicitly praising McCarthy or justifying him against his discreditors. [The truth is that Joe McCarthy was a notoriously flawed person, a severe alcoholic and promiscuous womanizer with an insufficient regard for the truth. He was also right on target, quite a few times, with his accusations. There actually were many penetrations into the U.S. government by REAL Communist agents spying for Russia and, worse yet, influencing government policy during the WWII period of military alliance with Russia and for awhile afterwards (recommended reading: Stalin's Secret Agents, the Subversion of Roosevelt's Government). Some of these penetrations were trivial, but others were appallingly effective, like the way real Communist agent Alger Hiss influenced the Yalta conference, strengthening world Communism after WWII. There was serious naivete by many American leaders during the eras of Roosevelt (shockingly) - Truman (a little better) - Eisenhower (getting back on track) about the insidiousness of Communist goals and about the brutality of Communist governments. McCarthy, Richard Nixon, and others, to their credit, helped prevent additional Communist successes. The key error of McCarthy and others down the present day such as Bowers, is that they overreached reality and made some assertions beyond what they had real evidence for. But listen to this, Bowers fans: not even McCarthy, in an era of greater Communist cohesiveness, expansion, influence, and actual documented (quite a few even confessed) AGENTS, went as far as Bowers in warning of an impending literal takeover of the U.S. by a Communist government! In reality, such a Communist takeover of the U.S. has NEVER been a serious threat, not even during the heyday of Eugene Victor Debs (Google him) or during the alliance years of WWII, let alone during the Eisenhower 50's or the present era.]
* Bowers equates two different meanings for ""socialism"", (1) totalitarian governmental control of the economy claiming to eliminate poverty, and (2) any government program to help the poor. These two meanings are then interchanged  and condemned as one and the same thing, for example by then displaying Lenin's quote, ""The goal of socialism is communism."" Likewise, ""big government"" per se and the Democratic party are equated with Nazism and Communism. Bowers frequently shows photos or videos of Obama and Franklin Roosevelt together with photos or videos of Hitler, Lenin, and Stalin, and then all of the above are all characterized together as ""the Left."" [This sort of unjustified lumping-together is a standard technique of manipulative propaganda. FDR and Obama have espoused terrible ideas and policies, but it is beyond reasonable (to put it mildly) to equate them with murderers-of-millions like Hitler, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao. The one exception to the previous sentence, and I believe this was ignored by Bowers, is the terrible holocaust of abortion, which under the Obama presidency has continued to snuff out over a million American lives every year, just as it has done for decades. If you want a political cause to be reasonably passionate about, in my opinion you should crusade against abortion, not against Communism.]

MY CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE AGENDA DOCUMENTARY:
1. Bowers doesn't present nearly enough conclusive evidence for a thesis as immense as his. There are way too many arguments from innuendo, faulty reasoning, and flimsy circumstantial/inferential evidence. It's somewhat analogous to evaluating Harold Camping's nutty 2011 rapture thesis based on the evidence Camping gave at the time and which he now admits to have been faulty. Another example of inadequate evidence was the case made by the Bush administration that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction before launching Desert Storm. To believe a thesis with such profound implications, a reasonable person would demand really conclusive, hard evidence like the evidence we had against Al-Qaeda and Bin Laden being responsible for 9-11. To justify war, or to justify a crusade against liberalism that would potentially include a renewal of something like the 1950s McCarthy hearings, reasonable people need better evidence than Bowers has given us. Positive reviewers of Agenda give Bowers WAY too much credit for his allegedly incontrovertible evidence. On the amount and quality of hard, legally admissible evidence provided by Bowers in this DVD, it would be difficult to get a court conviction of a criminal for even a minor crime.
2. I think it's unlikely that many liberal minds will be changed by the film. Some (hopefully not very many) who already hold conservative opinions and who already believe in the evil nature of American secular-humanist liberalism (I actually count myself among this group) will end up joining the extremists who share the Communist-conspiracy belief (I am NOT in that group). To put it another way, almost no Democrats will be convinced, but a few already-conservative Republicans may move toward the extreme right. Mostly, the effect will be to give more fuel to the zeal of those who already hold views similar to Bowers.
3. Some Bowers-skeptical conservatives and Christians will find themselves alienated from the Bowers-convinced, sadly weakening some conservative efforts, tragically dividing some churches (hopefully not very many). Those churches who en masse embrace the Bowers mission will be discredited, and rightly so, in the eyes of their communities.
4. People will rightly think, there goes another crackpot Christian idea like Harold Camping's prediction that the rapture would occur in 2011, and be further hardened against the true gospel of Jesus Christ. We need less of this nonsense and more winsome, eminently reasonable witness like that in Tim Keller's The Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism. Keller's book would be a wiser purchase for most people considering the purchase of this DVD.
5. People and our society ARE turning away from God and many truths about reality and morality, and this is a colossal tragedy, but it's not because of the Communists. It's because of people's rebellious hearts, that they have believed a lie ABOUT GOD, that He doesn't exist or doesn't care or doesn't matter. Don't devote your life to a misguided crusade to try and rescue America from Communism but to discovering and vigorously living out God's real love and truth. THAT is your best real hope for saving America.",1316217600,271,18977,5.399797570850202

4232756,5,B003Z3CZGG,"In the 50s and 60s while attending school I was taught the differences between kings that ruled by divine right, emperors, totalitarianism, liberalism (original and the current meaning) socialism, Fabian Socialism, Fascism, Communism as well as the difference between a Democracy and a Republic. Volunteered for military service and Vietnam. As I fought I watched riots on TV that helped our enemy. For years I wondered what was happening to my country. In the early 80s my children (6 & 7 years old) came home from school telling me that if I spanked them they could tell the teacher and I would go to jail. I wonder who told them that? I was working 10 - 12 hours a day to support my family. Didn't have time to investigate, just figured child nonsense. Wow, was I wrong. Now disabled because of my military service. But proud I served and fought Communism on battle field. But ashamed I didn't wake up till recently it was taking over the world and my country.

Been a recluse for 6 years, spend most of my time reading. Have read dozens of books on history from the left and right. I could relate and discuss much of what is on this DVD before I saw it. They could make a 200 hour series on the subjects on the DVD. Many hours just on ACORN's hundreds of sub organizations. The one thing I could not do was connect all the dots because it was so massive. If I could it would take hours and days to explain to someone. I have had conservatives tell me that I was a little out there or ""Why would they do that, it doesn't make sense?"" I have had liberals call me a right wing fanatic. I wonder if some of them maybe the ""useful idiots"" helping the Communists.

Let me say... based on what I have read this DVD is ""right on"". Because of that I purchased several copies and sent them to friends and told them if they like, please purchase three and forward to their friends.

Frankly, I am sad to say... I suspect that most who dispute this DVD have not studied history. Of course true history is no longer required in our schools. Interesting, don't you think?

Everyone in this country needs to watch this DVD. They may not agree but it will give them insight to the future whether they like it or not. It may make them think when they hear something, or maybe even wake them up. And when the Communists gain total control, it will be a crime to own it.

Perhaps I'm getting a bit tired of watching/hearing/reading what I already ""get"" or I would have given in higher marks. It was very good, make no mistake. Bowers does a good job of putting together succinctly the things that are wrong and connecting the dots and tracing the root causes. It is highly informative in that aspect. Many, many people who believe as I believe need to see this. Because it is succinct and powerful, it will seem heavy handed to the regular mall shopper, movie goer, facebook addict or Lady Gaga listener. Then again, it would probably go right over their heads. It doesn't reverse the training they've recieved from their environment because the film is made for ""us"" ...the chior. I don't think it will convert a true ""liberal"".

I am looking for something that focuses like a lazer beam to deconstruct ""liberal"" ideology in an entertaining format; more stuff like Ben Stein's film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed. Agenda aludes to the foundational fallacies but doesn't go deep into why (I will grant that that may not have been Bowers' aim). So maybe I'm not the target audience for this film although it served me as a reminder, again of what we face. I could have enjoyed it for that alone.

The music was great. I always cringe for a moment when watching these types of ""yippie for our side"" docs. Though I love the spirit of Lee Greenwood's song it's overplayed and a tad cheezy. Thankfully, none of that was here.  Bowers has a touch for the non-cheezy, which is a blessing rarely found on the conservative christian side of the fence.

One of the things that would lose the Jon Stewart devotee (i.e. the average college student) right off the top is the immediate (though accurate) comparisons between modern liberalism and communism. The slightly informed college kid is immune to that criticism and sees it as narrow mnded name calling. I could hear the clicking-off noises all across college campuses of America. I thought he started off way too strong with that and perhaps shouldn't have revealed the place he went to or the organization, saving it for a WHAMMO moment later. Although I completely agree with him. I was hoping for a little more nuance, some set up, so that the hardcore ""liberal"" would tune in for a little longer and not start rolling eyes and groaning right away. That is why I knocked of a whole star.

It is very good. I have a person in mind I want to share it with. It is a solid doc--for us--that every conservative should have (or at least know about) and should be given to a ""liberal"" but only when they ask for it because this is strong medicine. ;-)",1310601600,23,2770,4.621951219512195

Have you wondered why your children come home from school with ideas that are so contrary to what you have tried to teach them about our country being great, and about personal responsibility and morality?  This DVD documents how students and the American public have been deceived into thinking that Communism is dead, when in reality there is a concerted effort to undermine and even destroy the moral values and freedom in this country.

Do you wonder why the economy is such a mess?  Do you wonder why your house is worth so much less than it was five years ago?  There is a reason.  This DVD is an eye-opener as to why.

4232765,5,B003Z3CZGG,I grew up in the 50's and 60's and i've seen the changes for the worst in our country and Agenda is right on.  This is a well researched documentry on what is happening in our country and how it got that way. This opened up my eyes to what was going on when I was growing up.  It is too bad I could not see it then,1309737600,11,314,3.6029411764705883
4232766,5,B003Z3CZGG,This documentary should be viewed by every American.  It is scary how quickly evil forces have undermined our Nation's moral beliefs and values.  I can only pray it is not too late to turn around.,1308700800,9,196,4.571428571428571
4232767,5,B003Z3CZGG,"If you're a Christian living in America and have been looking around the country, wondering, ""What in the world has happened to us?"", this is the movie for you. And if you haven't been wondering that - well, this is still the movie for you, because everybody deserves to know what is happening to us, to our country, to our churches, to our culture.

Agenda: Grinding America Down is a very well-done, well-made movie. It speaks the truth in a very understandable, honest way. It doesn't shy away from the facts. And believe me, the truth is quite harrowing.

This movie shows us what we once were. We were a country built by Christians, with a Constitution built to protect our rights and our freedoms. We were fundamentally a Christian nation, and our people were hard-working and moral. But the America we see today is so much different. When you look around, you see how much our country has decayed on so many different levels. And we wonder how this happened, how we could've strayed so far. This documentary shows you clearly what has been happening. America is being destroyed from the inside by people who don't share our traditional ideals - by people who want to eliminate the morals and the patriotism of our great nation and transform it into something new, something different - and something very bad.

This movie may sound like nothing but conspiracy-theory garbage. Trust me, it's not. Even if you don't agree with all its conclusions, you have to admit that SOMEthing is happening in this nation - and this movie shows you what that exactly that ""something"" is. It's a documentary I think everyone should watch. It doesn't shy from facts; it tells the real story. It tells the story of this country - a story that's still being told, a story that YOU can participate in. And it shows you that the situation in the United States will not improve unless, as a people, we embrace God's ways above our own and return to the scriptural principles upon which our country and culture were originally based.

This movie is for ANY concerned American, regardless of age. I am only a 14 year old, but I understood the deep, thought-provoking message of this movie...and was impacted by it. It's so important that we stay informed, and this movie is, in my opinion, a great way to start. Buy it, see it, invite friends over to watch it. It's a life-changing movie.

This is what you can make people believe if you destroy education. But most people don't think, they believe - and it's far easier to believe someone that tells you what you want to hear.

Although it could come across as democrat bashing to the ""left"", it does no favors to the Republican Party. This film is not criticizing well-meaning democrats so much as it reveals the ideology that has taken America by storm in the last ~20 years or so. The premise of the film is that America is on a fast track to communism. It documents how this has happened, defined from the ideas found in historical works of Marxist thinkers (primary sources). It also explains why communism is bad. The film claims that communism is the end result of socialism.

This is a very well researched documentary. Because of its assumptions it is offensive to liberals by nature.

4232794,5,B003Z3CZGG,"I didn't know what to expect when I came upon this documentary, but it looked very interesting.  I'd been looking for something that would help put the pieces of the puzzle together and would be easy to either communicate and/or loan out to others who were unaware.  This started that process, but in my opinion it suffered from some short-comings.  First, and this is personal preference, so take this for what it's worth.  I could have done without the very nasally voice of the creator/narrator.  This kind of thing can be an unnecessary distraction, but I'm willing to let this kind of thing pass because of the obvious effort that was put into this project overall.

The second short-coming is that there really wasn't quite enough explanation.  It was very surface or superficial, and in order for people to really get it, they are going to need to know more about Marxism/Neo-Marxism and why specifically these ideas persist and hang together in a world where Communism and big government are increasinly discredited in reality.  So it suffers from a lack of depth and therefore, cannot provide the understanding necessary for the uninitiated.

Third, it relies far too heavily on well known evangelical Christians and people simply labeled things like researcher/blogger.  I don't mean that I didn't like many of their choices, like M. Stanton Evans, Joshua Muavchik, David Noebel, and others.  I simply mean that the base needs to be broadened, and you need to call on people with genuine titles and credentials that can be used to help bolster the veracity of the case being made.

You may be asking yourself, if I thought it had so many problems, why would you give it 5 stars?  Well, I think it's deserving of 5 stars, and I want the reviews on Amazon.com to reflect positively on a good, though imperfect piece of work.  I'm hopeful that many more people will get a hold of this DVD and loan it out to whoever they can.  The simple fact is that Christians, conservatives, and people of conscience in the Unite States and around the world are really decades behind in responding to the threat of international Marxism/Neo-Marxism/Cultural Marxism.  The few things that have come out, like some material from Coral Ridge Ministries suffers from some of these same shortcomings in a far more profound way.  To be honest, this presentation was an substantial improvement over the Coral Ridge Ministries material, and I'm just glad to see Christians taking it upon themselves to leap into the fray and do what they can do defend our country and its historic Judeo-Christian moral ethic.

But this should not be the end.  If we value our nation, the freedom that we enjoy, and the moral values that we try to uphold, Christians must come together and take this kind of project further.  The only way to do that is to become informed.  Begin reading the books discussed in this video.  Start doing your own research.  Books by the late Dr. Ronald H. Nash are a good place to start.  The point I'm trying to make is that this DVD is a beginning, not an end.  We have to start winning the war of ideas.  We have to start obviously and effectively winning the debate on substance, and stop allowing ourselves to be marginalized merely on style.  In short, we must fight for what we say we believe.  The consequences for those who come after us are too terrible to think about, but if you want a taste, just read through Revelation.

Let's be entirely truthful here shall we?
The Bible was a rule book invented by 17th century monks as a control mechanism.
Rule of law was not even a twinkle in the eye of society as of yet when it was ""translated"" from a language which had been dead for over 2000 years.
They burned some of the scrolls for heat for crying out loud.

So what do you do?
You write a rule book, with rules that say, if you do x, y, and z you will be eternally tormented,
because you are now being watched even when no one can see you.
You're speaking of a time when people were having holes drilled in their skulls for headaches. Public masturbating was only considered mildly rude.

Communism is NOT to blame here in the U.S. for our problems.
Corruption fueled by unmitigated greed is now, and has always been, the problem in every culture on this planet.
Belief in a wish granting entity in the sky who loves us so much that if we don't love him back he will have is burned and tormented for eternity will not save this culture.
Consumerism will not do it either.
You want to know the secret to fixing society as a whole?
It's not the Robin hood principle that's for sure.
It's called self reliance and tolerance.
You don't like my review?
Thumb it down. It's okay, you know why?
It's your right to.
You pay for your prime subscription the same as I do.
I don't care what you believe, those are a big pile of your problems.
Rely on your own beliefs, rely on you.
That is what has made everything good on this planet, its each human doing the best they can for themselves.
When has pushing an agenda on others ever brought dividends?
Slavery, that's it...
America and England were built on the backs of those who were given the choice of work, or die or work until you die.
That money piled up and you see what it has wrought.
A cesspool of me me me me.
Do your me me me for yourself.
No one owes you a damn thing  but you.
Get it for yourself.
I grew up in foster care since the age of 5 and am eternally grateful for the kindness of others who made me who I am.
Those kind people owe me nothing.
It is I who owe them.
I repay their gifts by not throwing them away for the first easy thing that comes my way by way of entitlement.

You want to crush communism?
Crush lies and greed and all will right itself.
Right now everyone seems enthralled with ""big brother"" watching. Why?
We have the world's knowledge in the palm of our hands every day and you know what we do with it?
Post selfies, brag, condicend to others, Lie, cheat, steal, and most of all watch women and men being degraded for a pittance.
What data have you created that is of such value that you care that some NSA monitoring station grabs it?
You bought the gateway to this and keep it in your pocket or purse. This was your choice. Don't like it? Throw your phone in the landfill that contains every piece of plastic you have ever touched since birth.
If you fear scrutiny then there's most likely a reason.
Let Zuckerberg sell your every thought. Again your choice.
Having our cake and eating too was never an option.
Make your choices and be quiet.
No one wants to hear you screaming about how bad you made your life.
""I chose to buy something that allows a window into my every action!"" ""Make it stop doing what it was fully intended to do, because (freedom)!""
Bull... Your freedom was excersized with your original choice to buy said device or not!
You make you choices and
no wish granting entity is coming.
Make your own wishs come true or die trying.

8409900,5,B003Z3CZGG,"Spot on documentary - having studied this same material for over 30 years now, I was surprised to see a a film that actually talked about the truth of communism  racism / socialism, etc.. None of this information is hard to find - never was, one only has to look beyond the feed trough of mainstream media, TV, etc.. entire congressional hearings can be read and or watched, thousands of books and other publications from the sources themselves can be found and read - the information is not new, even Frederick Bastiat wrote about some of this in 1850 in his book ""The Law"".",1524700800,,575,4.528846153846154
8409901,1,B003Z3CZGG,"The main argument of the movie appears to be that communism = fascism, but it is based purely on opinion of a few people. No logical argument for this reasoning was delivered. A very ignorant and disingenuous film that is essentially propaganda.",1524700800,,245,4.857142857142857

Those who rate it higher apparently believe peoples belief system and moral center can magically be changed and that only those who believe in Christianity are the only ones capable of goodness. Frankly the film is more akong the lines of the kind of propaganda Goebbels churned out for the Nazis right up to the very end with the announcement Hitler died fighting the Soviets, right before he and his wife murdered tgeir six children and committed suicide.
The film of course scapegoats the same people fascism went after. If you want to learn what is grinding America down look somewhere else if what you really ssek is truth not a bunch of bs lies and hypicrisy.",1524009600,2,699,4.6
