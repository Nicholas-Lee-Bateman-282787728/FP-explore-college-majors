7976273,5,B00007G1YI,I work at a dental office so the episode where Caillou has to go to the dentist would be great for children to watch!,1394323200,,117,3.9166666666666665
7976274,4,B00007G1YI,"This is one of our newer Caillou's I like his friend Leo.
The stories are good and I believe it has the puppets
in between the stories which can be irritating and boring
to kids. If your kids like Caillou though it's more
of the same .",1270512000,,235,4.0212765957446805
7976275,5,B00007G1YI,"My 2 year old daughter loves, loves, loves Caillou and this dvd is no exception!  So far she hasn't found a Caillou dvd she doesn't like!  The stories are interspersed with the puppetry of Gilbert, Dino and Teddy.  I can hear my daughter laughing at the dvd right now!",1182988800,,268,4.428571428571429
7976276,5,B00007G1YI,My six year old son absolutely adores Caillou.  I would have thought he would have out grown it by now but it seems he's just as interested in it now as he was when he was two.  He loves to play doctor so that was why he was so interested it this dvd.  But I have never known Caillou to whiny or bratty.  I think that he acts like any normal four year old who doesn't understand why he can't do certain things.  I think people who thinks he is whiny must not have any experience with four year olds at all because four year olds I know are MUCH whinier than Caillou.  I think Caillou teaches them not to whine when you don't get your way there's always something else to do that is just as much fun.  I noticed a significant difference in my son when he started watching Caillou he stopped pitching fits and whining.  This is a wonderful show for children of all ages.  Much better than Sponge Bob which just teaches nasty behavior to our children.,1166572800,5,948,4.193370165745856
