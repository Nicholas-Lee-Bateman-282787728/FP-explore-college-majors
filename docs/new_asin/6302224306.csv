440572,1,6302224306,"Why is there being marketed this series of very good films (some not) at these sky rocket prices, with no significant art work, no inserts, no trailers, no special features, and no chapters with any logic..every ten minutes there is a chapter break, and are they awful.

These are DVDS from tapes, sold to customers for close to $30.00 each.

Further, the restrictions on playing them are absurd, showing the nature of the copying. They are way over-priced knock offs, of the very bad over seas variety.

Hard to understand, but beware, and if you have B. Junction, Private Lives, Sins of Rachel Cade etc., on  VHS, hold on to those copies, they are much better.

At this price..a disgrace.",1248220800,64,690,4.716666666666667
440573,5,6302224306,"While this movie may not be historically accurate, it stands out for two reasons. The acting of Ava Gardner as she portrays a half Indian, half Welsh young woman during one of the most turbulent times in the history of the Indian sub-continent. She was ably supported by a distinguished cast. The second reason is the portrayal of those times. The British had little to be proud about over their management of the sub-continent, but they did leave behind a fully functioning civil service, including the management of the railways. This movie shows the situation perfectly. All in all, this movie is an event not to be missed. The reader who thinks that all the characters ever did was winge and whine obviously knows nothing about the conditions in which the half-casts lived. I recommend this without hesitation.",1161648000,13,814,4.905797101449275
440574,1,6302224306,"I read this book 30 years ago & I just read it again, its a fine story by a good English author, so I thought I would watch the video.

Sadly Hollywood has taken this fine story and just about changed it all around & not for the good - it must be to satisfy the film Moguls.

440575,4,6302224306,"This is an interesting flick which shows the choas that created India and Pakistan as two inperfect nations. To view this movie today can give you an insight into what has become modern India. Ava Gardener does a great job showing the plight of the Anglo-Indians. While not Indian herself she looks the part well. Some have complained that having British actors play Indians detracts from the movie. Perhaps this is not politically correct by today's standards, but this viewer found nothing wrong with it. Indian actors might have been harder to understand with their accents than British actors! The real strength of this movie is the political background of India's Independence. The atmosphere of confusion bordering on bloody conflict is captured well. One can see what a thankless job the British had trying to dis-engage from India without leaving a civil war behind. The way Colonel Savage deals with the high caste Brahamins protesting at the railway station is masterful. Even in their decline, the British could always out-smart their Indian opponets! The agitators like Ghandi, Nehru and others who are portrayed by their followers in the movie show how in their eagerness to ride themselves of the British they were careless in regards to possible Moslem /Hindu violence. On the sidelines, but hoping to cause trouble were the Communists, as always. The movie shows all of these forces in play, while allowing us to see India's confusion in the form of Ava Gardner's identity crisis, which mirrors what the impact of Independence was on many.
The Pakistani battalion that is used to portray a Pathan unit provides an interesting snapshot of what the old Indian army was like. The use of bagpipes was popular in their regiments because of the influence of Scottish units and their music on India.  Many Indian and Paksistani army pipe bands today owe their musical heritage to the Scottish regiments of the British army who imparted their knowledge of the great Highland Warpipe to these peoples. While Perhaps slightly dated, this movie is still worthwhile, and gives one an appreciation of the history and confusion of the formation of India and Paksistan. Ava Gardener fans will certainly enjoy it as well.",1037145600,37,2221,5.0353260869565215
440576,2,6302224306,"Ava Gardner once described this as the most difficult film of her career. I tend to assume that she meant the physical grind of location filming in Pakistan,rather than the dramatic demands of her role. She gives a performance of such stultifying dullness that she suggests she ignored them and was primarily concerned to get the whole thing over and done with.and then to get back on the next plane to Hollywood She plays Victoria,an Anglo-Indian woman whose parents are fanatically pro-British and view the impending independence of India with some trepidation. She haerself is more open-minded and seeks a positivee role for mixed race people in the new state
Her fiancee is of the same mind as her parents .She breaks off the engagement and takes up with a young Indian nationalist,en route to a dalliance with the dashing British officer-played with no great flair by Stewart Granger
In the background to this tale is the political dimension of a nation about to become an independent state and facing internal conflict between the non-violence of Ghandi and the more vigorous efforts of the Communists
The acting is poor and the casting of white actors as Indians is embarrassing in this day and age. Only Lionel Jeffries in a rare unsympathetic role as a brutal British officer makes a positive impact
The crowd scenes are well handled but so woeful is the scripting and acting this quickly becomes an ordeal
Still its better than Ghandi -but so too is self-amputation of both legs!",1008720000,7,1489,4.8893280632411065
440577,5,6302224306,"Ava Gardner once more shows how good she can be in a dramatic part with this role as an Anglo Indian trying to exist in a world where she is respected by neither the British nor the Indians. Her performance captures the plight of a character on the verge of losing her identity and deciding to become totally Indian, while sensing that she belongs to the colonial world that has created this dichotomy of racial selfhood she lives in.
Ava is spectatcular in portraying the two sides of this tricky coin, and her acting is enhanced by her remarkable beauty, her brunette hair and beautiful eyes and luminous face, and her gestures which suggest so much of these two worlds that torment her.
Stewart Granger, always underestimated, is very good as a man who pursues Ava with negative ideas about her Anglo-Indian role, and who, through this negativity, hopes that she will seee him as the savior, again the colonial solution.
Bill Travers is excellent as an Anglo, chasing Ava to the point of madness, insisting on his sexual power and his sense of the real India she must live in.
There are racial issues struggling to get out in this script, and George Cukor, who directed this and many Hepburn /Tracey films, keeps the politically correct posture that he does in every film he ever made. A hack of the first order, but Ava keeps way ahead of this guy and makes Bhowani Junction a great film. (Note her rape scene, and how modern her approach to it is.)
This film was cut drastically by Metro Goldwyn Mayer, and Cukor approved of all the cuts, as he did with Judy Garland's A Star Is Born, claiming he suffered over all the cuts. Nonsense.  The cuts do not hurt the performances here, as they stand in this film version of the novel; but the film shows what a lousy studio Metro was and what a great star Ava was. The director Cukor would go on to try and direct the great Marilyn Monroe in two films, one she saves and the other he falls apart making. So, there are these big odds in Bhowani Junction( a terrible studio and a ghastly director)but the viewer should enjoy watching Ava and the rest of this very good cast beat the odds.
Buy it and cherish it..but, wait for DVD and cinemascope, lbx versions/.",1004572800,32,2208,4.506234413965087

440635,5,6302224306,"Despite being shot in Pakistan, George Cukor's epic of turmoil in India has a convincing feel and no shortage of atmosphere. Ava Gardner is so ripely sensual that one quickly chooses to accept her as a half-caste British officer in post-colonial India. The subject matter is sometimes surprisingly edgy for the era (and Cukor's original cut was supposedly much racier still), with Gardner's attempt rape -- and killing of Lionel Jeffries' oily Brit -- starkly dramatic. The chemistry between Gardner and Stewart Granger as her superior officer is sufficiently volatile that one roots for them to wind up together, despite their prickly relationship for most of the film. Bill Travers shines in the thankless role of Gardner's intended and the Pakistani settings are a treat for the eyes. Warner Archive has tamed the volatile Eastmancolor visual tones and the final result can be recommended without reservation.",1469404800,,912,5.2534246575342465

quite good in the central role and Stewart Granger is stalwart and earnest as the romantic lead.  Bill travers is highly effective as the angry

It didn't quite live up to  expectations at the time of release - despite having Cukor as director and a capable cast.

Ava Gardner is absolutely fantastic in this movie. Not only does she look gorgeous ,and the camera obviously loves her ,but she does an incredible job and in many respects steals the entire movie.

440752,5,6302224306,"I like this movie tremendously, particularly as a fan of the glamorous Ava Gardner. I had never seen this particular movie before until I bought it recently from Amazon. Ms. Gardner eloquently played her role as the charming Eurasian Victoria Jones with realism and passion, exemplifying her excellent acting skill. On the other hand, Stewart Granger though stiff at times does a fine job as the evolving British Officer, complementing Gardner very well. The plot is somewhat predictable especially under the backdrop during the waning days of the British occupation of India. However, the overall acting, directing, script writing and the quality of the DVD picture are more than enough to compensate for any shortcoming.
Since getting this DVD, I have viewed it twice and I still continue to enjoy it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate good movie from the golden era of the past.

the congress party and the much revered Gandhi as the british were leaving.
That's the basis of the story,but it doesnt really detail Gandhi's vision,or really concentrate on him,but a train he's on passing through...there was a very good more recent film on Gandhi. The film with Gardner as its star.plays a half indian half british person amidst these troubling times in an affair with the Granger character,and tries to tell us what her true allegiance is? She plays a very complex character,and she decides to stay in India,is that really her answer. There is a sikh episode,and a train strike,and the story ends on an ambiguous note on the reality,the granger's reality or hers,and they separate?
This time of period piece,which only briefly goes into the history,with a few military clashes,is also the story of the Gardner person being her own person,
discovering her own identity,and the granger character muses if only God made us the same on the inside and out,so that he could love her and return to
england,a comment on what separates them,..their dialogue is intelligent and

To see the obvious expense and care lavished on this ambitious Cinemascope project by director George Cukor, DP Freddie Young, actors Ava Gardner, Stewart Granger, etc.--including 6 months spent on location in Pakistan--it is distressing to see what became of it after the director's cut.  Those involved at the time still remember what a milestone of
sweeping political and intimate material it contained, including probably Ava Gardner's best performance.  Shortly thereafter it was cut nearly in half by the studio, the story was turned
into an awkward flashback, and much excised material was covered by narration... always a sign of trouble and tampering in a feature film.  The remaining shards suggest the regrettable loss of what might have been a truly memorable film experience.  This damage was apparently done because the studio and producers were fearful of the interracial romantic overtones of the material, which were faithful to the original best selling novel from which it came.  Great crowd scenes, thousands of extras, big train wreak, lots of mayhem, but in the end unfortunately flat to watch in it's final incarnation.",1325376000,10,1160,5.282608695652174
