2791180,1,B000O76TJ0,"[....]  I watch this and imagine a teenager putting it together on his PC in four hours using an award winning 8th grade English script.

Cheesy, simple, dull, predictable, blah, <spit>, curse.",1241222400,,193,5.0
2791181,1,B000O76TJ0,"I won't waste much energy on this, but I will say a couple of things. First, this movie is AWFUL.  Second, it is only 45 minutes long and the graphics look like something made in 1992.  The production budget on this must have been a few hundred dollars.  Did I mention this was AWFUL?

It appears to be a ""Cars"" knock-off, but it doesn't even qualify as a knock-off.

Thankfully, I only rented this movie.... and even then, I still feel ripped off.",1236470400,3,448,4.349397590361446
2791182,1,B000O76TJ0,i was extremely disappointed with this product...it skipped in many places and froze in others.  I was very disappointed as this was a gift for my grandson.,1234915200,2,156,4.777777777777778

8183265,1,B000O76TJ0,"My 2 year old picked this but it was absolutely awful and inappropriate... I pulled it from the DVD player and trashed it.  The graphics are awful, and the content beyond terrible",1426896000,,179,4.59375
8183266,5,B000O76TJ0,good movie,1408665600,,10,4.5
8183267,1,B000O76TJ0,"The worst animation, VO and story telling I have ever seen. Horrible. I can't believe I paid for it. Even my 2 years old hates it",1364515200,,129,4.0
8183268,1,B000O76TJ0,"Our son received this as a gift since he loves Cars the Disney/Pixar movie.  We played it and wow where we surprised at how terrible this dvd is.  It looks like a high school kid's computer project.  The animation (if you can call it that) is nothing but recycled pictures with different dialogue.  The race track is static screen...that's right, the way they made the race track is by putting static on the TV, unbelievable garbage.",1262736000,10,433,4.657894736842105
8183269,1,B000O76TJ0,"This program is HORRIBLE.  We Netflixed this beast instead of buying, thank goodness.  It is so darn bad!  From the blatant attempt to rip off ""Cars"" to the terrible things they say to each other, it is just awful.  I kept thinking it would get better, but it felt more like a powerpoint presentation of how to be smarmy jerks.",1251676800,4,327,4.4
8183270,1,B000O76TJ0,It was kind of strange to see a pentagram on the front of the purple van. I wondering if it a mistake or a sneaky little symbol plug.,1250985600,2,133,3.7857142857142856
8183271,1,B000O76TJ0,"If you loved Cars, you'll loathe this! It's terrible. A waste of time and money, and it also has inappropriate themes and language for young children. My three-year-old was so excited to watch it and the moment I turned it on, I realized that this was a poorly done production. Horrid. You're better off waiting for Cars 2 in the theatre!",1243900800,2,338,4.557377049180328
8183272,1,B000O76TJ0,"Not only is this movie absolutely poorly made, but it uses language that is not suitable for young children. Insulting language and all of the previously mentioned review items makes this one of the poorest movies imaginable. It's like getting scammed by deceiving spam.",1243296000,,270,5.159090909090909
8183273,1,B000O76TJ0,"My two year old daughter won't even watch this.
Don't waste your time!!

The graphics are so bad.
First semester animation students make stuff better than this!
And the voice acting is horrible.
Completely boring/dumb story.
Thank God it was so short.",1243209600,6,251,4.976190476190476
