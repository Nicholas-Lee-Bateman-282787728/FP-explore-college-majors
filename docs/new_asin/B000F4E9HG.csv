8117256,4,B000F4E9HG,I really liked the lessons during the warm-ups - it's easier to remember what I'm supposed to be doing with a little reminder - and it didn't interrupt the workout.  It was easy to follow and it had good music :),1280102400,,212,4.170731707317073
8117257,1,B000F4E9HG,"This DVD is of very poor quality.  There are three workouts on the DVD, but they are all the same workout just different lengths.  The commentary is interesting and help but is very uninspiring to help you through the work out.  The group riders provide no help in getting through the ride.  They are very nervous with the camera on them and there is no interaction with them.",1261958400,,376,4.485294117647059
8117258,2,B000F4E9HG,"I bought this in anticipation of improving my cycling technique this winter and was extremely disappointed.  The first workout consisted of 4 one minute spin ups and 2 x 2minutes of one leg drills for each side. That was it and it was a 45 minute workout.  Besides that you just pedaled.  The commentary which which was sparse and unrehearsed was like listening to a Sunday pastor on prozac.  If you want better, look into Spinervals recovery and technique.",1226707200,8,457,4.746835443037975
