2629979,5,B000H6SY1O,"The show's first three seasons had a real energy and brilliance.  There is so much great material in them that needs to be seen, particularly the first and third seasons.

They did a pretty sensible job picking out many of the better episodes here for this collection.  Unfortunately, to put a whole season out is a relatively expensive proposition as the music rights have not been cleared before and they used a lot of music, much of it popular.  This results in a high list price, and in relatively low sales.  It's a Catch-22.  People hesitate to drop top dollar on something they haven't seen before.  The reason they haven't seen it before?  Because the music rights issue haunted this great series for decades.

So, this set has much of SCTV's great, idiosynchratic comedy, at a low list price?  How can you lose, as Dwayne Millage once asked during NBC Cycle 4.  Highly recommended.",1164412800,5,890,4.714285714285714

2629981,5,B000H6SY1O,"Okay, it's great to have more SCTV even though, yes, it's a shame that Shout Factory didn't simply release these shows as complete season box sets.  And, yes, it's also too bad that no Harold Ramis-centric season one shows were included.  But, fear not, these shows are every bit as strong as the NBC years.  As has been stated previously, most of these episodes come from the John Candy and Catherine O'Hara-less third season.  To replace them, the show added three new cast members: Robin Duke, Rick Moranis, and Tony Rosato.  A lot of people rip on Duke and Rosato as being poor substitutes for Candy and O'Hara but I disagree.  They are both very funny, strong performers with completely different styles from Candy & O'Hara.  Are they as good?  Well, considering Candy was overflowing with charm and O'Hara was a BRILLIANT mimic, no.  But this does not mean they are not very funny in their own right... remember, they were good enough to be poached by ""Saturday Night Live"" the following year (it's no fault of theirs that they joined the ""SNL"" cast when it was essentially ""The Eddie Murphy Show"" and, therfore, were not allowed to make their mark on the show).  I especially find Rosato a boon to the ""SCTV"" cast with his killer Lou Costello impersonation and Italian stereotype charcater, Marcello Sebastiano.  I could've done with more of Duke's daffy Molly Earl character, too (the charcater only gets one skit on this set).  Other plusses to the third season: with John & Catherine absent, Joe Flaherty (always my favorite) really gets a chance to shine more and Rick Moranis' arrival brings the birth of the McKenzie Brothers.  All these shows are strong and the extras as nifty as usual with these sets.  And, if you REALLY do want to see more of the 1st-3rd seasons of ""SCTV,"" you'd better buy this collection.  If sales aren't strong, this may very well be the last set we'll see.",1163116800,6,1896,4.703030303030303
2629982,4,B000H6SY1O,"My guess why earlier episodes weren't included is because the creators of the show freely lifted copyrighted materials.  This was admitted in the commentaries on the earlier DVDs.  In fact, on some of the DVD sets they had to remaster sound tracks or edit out certain skits because they couldn't obtain permission retroactively.

Remember, SCTV started as a modest syndicated TV show in a Canadian market.  They figured no one would notice or care.  Times are different now.

Personally, I'd love to see the episode which was a lift of a ""Cisco Kid"" episode redubbed.  No doubt they didn't get permission from the copyright holders to do that, so there's no way we'll see that on DVD.",1162684800,6,684,4.794871794871795
2629983,3,B000H6SY1O,"I agree it's great to see all of these early episodes, however releasing a ""best of"" set left me a bit disappointed. FIrst off there are *NO* season one episodes, leaving all of the post Harold Ramis episodes. Also many of the 2 and 3 season episodes were recycled into the NBC 90 minute series, so if you bought those you'll see lots of repeats. I would rather see some of the earlier stuff when the group were finding their footing. Some stuff was fantastic, some stuff didn't work but would be still great to see. After hearing this was going to be a complete set, and then being trimmed down and the sheer fact I couldn't find this set in ANY retail outlet here in town, I have a feeling this will be the last of the SCTV releases from Shout Factory. Too bad sales weren't better.",1162598400,10,784,4.304054054054054
2629984,1,B000H6SY1O,"I am not basing my 1-star review on the content of the DVD; in actual fact, I can do nothing but bestow praise on those involved in its release.

HOWEVER...

Unleashing a 'best-of' the 30-minute episodes instead of the actual chronological order they began with is tantamount to sacrilige.  I think most fans out there would prefer to wait a year, even two years or however long it takes to release a proper package including the Harold Ramis years, which are on par with any other comedy show's peak years.

That being said, I don't think this package would be all that bad had they actually released the original series first.  That's all, folks.",1161129600,25,648,4.649122807017544
2629994,3,B000H6SY1O,"Good audio commentary, good episodes, but Shout! Factory should put out all original 78 episodes from the first three seasons. They probably never will because of financial issues. All of their SCTV DVDS have been a flop and I think they can't even get the rights to them all! The best episodes were from the first three seasons from 1976-1981,before NBC!",1410393600,2,355,4.836065573770492
2629995,5,B000H6SY1O,"I have been waiting for these to come to DVD for forever.  LOVE these and they still stand up to the sands of time.  Hilarious writing, performances and shows.  To quote Lola Heatherton - ""I wanna' bear your children!""",1405382400,,218,4.538461538461538
2629996,1,B000H6SY1O,"I don't know how ""The Best"" were selected for this set. Perhaps my memory of SCTV has faded over the years but I do remember a good deal of SCTV early years episodes that were most amusing, especially those with Catherine O'Hara whose appearance is sadly sparse in this collection. The 90 minute shows which came out later though very good were quite commercialized and lacking the ""edge"" of the early 30 minute shows. It is a disservice to SCTV fans not to have ""SCTV - The Complete Early Years"" available. I and countless others would certainly buy them...",1358812800,8,558,4.646464646464646
2629997,5,B000H6SY1O,"This is a neat compilation of some of the best SCTV material.  I'm still waiting for the very first season to appear on DVD, but until then, this set will do nicely, especially since it recycles a few of those earlier sketches into these later-produced shows.",1348099200,,259,4.630434782608695
2629998,5,B000H6SY1O,These DVDs's exceeded my expectations.  The DVDs' was full of great SCTV moments and was a real treat.,1264809600,,102,4.666666666666667
2629999,1,B000H6SY1O,"Let me explain this one star review right out of the gate. These shows are GREAT, this boxed set is NOT. SCTV was a classic in studio (and dare I say better performed and a more creative) alternative than the charter cast edition of SNL. The celebrity impersonations are all classic, the skits were ground breaking and when familiar characters reappeared, the new sketches were refreshingly different. That being said, the desire to see all of the earliest 30 minute length shows should have resulted in a stronger demand than just this one set.
  SCTV's 30 minute shows ran from 1976 to 1981 with Candy and O'Hara (all but omitted from this set's content but featured on the cover) involved with the show until '79, Ramis (also missing) from '76 to '78 and Thomas, Levy, Flaherty Martin, Rosato, Duke. The majority of these short shows clearly come from the last two years (1980-1981) because Candy, O'Hara, and Ramis are all but missing completely from ever show included in the box. The sad reality of this set is that it is now three years old.
  There are two possible reasons why Shout failed to release ALL of the 30 minute shows. The first reason is that Shout just might not be in a position (be it copyright issues or show availability) to release all of the shows. The second possibility is that Shout decided it was against their interest to release all of the earliest shows because of lackluster sales of the previous four 90 minute DVD sets.
  I am willing to believe that Shout only has the right to the 1980's shows but that does not make this set ""The Best of the Early Shows."" I recommend purchasing the 90 minute sets and waiting for Shout to release all of the earliest shows in sequential order from 1976 to 1981. The likelihood of this happening in the near future is not likely because the barrage of Shout Factory SCTV releases now 3 years old.",1254787200,13,1869,4.580838323353293
2630000,1,B000H6SY1O,"Why was this program so damned funny when I was a teenager?  Probably because it was on late and I was high.

If, like me, you're thinking of buying these discs to recapture some of the magic of your youth, I'd suggest you reconsider.  A person's sense of humour evolves as the years go by.  Most of us get smarter as we get older, a process that reveals stupid humour to be just that.  These SCTV shows were far better remembered than relived.",1230681600,3,444,4.301204819277109
2630001,3,B000H6SY1O,"A best-of set? In whose opinion? They short-changed us here, folks. Why not do it right and issue ALL of the 30-minute episodes?; that's what the hardcore SCTV fans really wanted. Instead, we got a sampling, an hors devours tray. Bad job, Shout Factory!

2630002,1,B000H6SY1O,"The people that released this DVD make me want to throw my DVD player out my window (my big screen TV is too heavy to lift) and land it on their heads.  WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

Any true fan of SCTV is willing to wait as long as it takes to get all of the original series INCLUDING Harold Ramis in chronological order the way they SHOULD be released.

I bought all of the previous 90-minute volumes, but until you people release this fabulous series the right way, you WILL NOT get any more of my money, you HOSERS!",1199318400,72,514,4.171717171717172
2630003,3,B000H6SY1O,"I was disappointed in the selection of skits. I'm not an SCTV historian, with perfect knowlege of what was season 1, 2, 3, etc. I also don't remember exactly what shows were on what network. Still, I thought I remembered the intro introducing ""Dave Thomas as the beaver""? Correct? Was that intro only in the earliest of episodes? That intro wasn't here. I suspect what were labeled ""the early years"" for this dvd were actually more like the middle years. I'm 50, and saw this when it was new, but I didn't even remember Robin and Tony; evidently they didn't impress me much then. I enjoyed earlier episodes with J.C. and Catherine O. far more. A nice touch in this one were a few appearances of the not-so-scary Count Floyd, and Bob and Doug- who took our country by storm, eh? Overall, I think the title is misleading, and can only consider this a very average compilation.",1199145600,9,874,4.573248407643312

2630015,3,B000H6SY1O,"It must be very difficult, putting together a ""Best of"" collection, given the fact that everybody has an iron-clad opinion on what is considered the ""best.""  That being said, it was nice to see the ""genesis"" of some of the great characters developed over the years by this stellar group of performers:  Count Floyd, Bobby Bittman, Johnny Larue, Edith Prickley...the list goes on and on.

If I had any complaints:

1.  I would have liked one more disk of shows.

2.  I would have liked a better quality of commentary; quite often, the commentary seemed off the topic, and although I think Robin Duke is a wonderful performer, I would have preferred to have Moranis, or Thomas, or even Levy do some.  I add as a caveat:  I thought the sections with Andrea Thomas and the news footage of the ""McKenzie Phenomenon"" was a fine addition.",1180483200,4,831,4.636986301369863
2630016,3,B000H6SY1O,"I've been waiting for years for the half-hour SCTV shows to be released on DVD as I always felt that their best material was in the half-hour syndicated format. Then, when they finally do release some of the half-hour shows on DVD I discover that the publisher leaves out some of the best material?! I can't believe it. This show was not the same with Duke, Rosato, or even Short. The crew of D. Thomas, J. Candy, H. Ramis, J. Flaherty, E. Levy, C. O'Hara, R. Moranis and A. Martin is what this show was all about. Until I can get ALL the material featuring those specific cast members, I'm going to have to consider very carefully whether or not I'll be buying this or any other set. I'm giving this 3-stars for the good material that is here, I only wish that what was here was all 5 stars worth of material that I wanted.",1177977600,27,824,4.288461538461538
2630017,4,B000H6SY1O,"This set has my all time favorite SCTV skit, with Rosato and Levy doing a fabulously funny Abbott and Costello in ""The Midnight Express Special"". It's one of the only skits (that and of course Candy's Johnny LaRue, ""I'm not gay!"") I remember from first viewing originally on US TV, it's just so hilariously funny. The whole set here is awesome, from ""The Silly Bastard"" to the ""Cavett-Bittman"" interview, I give all the material here a solid five of five (I blew through all 3 discs in two days it was sooo good); but because its only 15 episodes, and not the complete seasons, I have to give it a 4. It's this kind of video distribution that drives the ""collector's"" market. Get with it, whoever is distributing this show! We want each season put out in total! The early episodes are holding up great for a baby boomer like me that caught this show on late night after Saturday Night Live in the 70's to early 80's!",1175990400,3,916,4.458333333333333
2630018,4,B000H6SY1O,"The episodes on this latest SCTV DVD set are definitely worth watching, but I must protest one new feature, the labeling as episode commentaries material that isn't in fact actual commentaries.  At least two of the episodes have what is labeled as a ""commentary"" but what are really just a member of the SCTV production staff responding to general questions about the show.  While these comments are interesting, they have nothing to do with the specific show they are linked to and the pairing of the two is pointless.  They should have run the comments as a separate added feature, perhaps along with a montage of still photos from the show, but I imagine it was simply cheaper to do it this way so they could claim to have more commentaries on the individual episodes when, as I say, these particular verbal recordings are nothing of the sort.",1171843200,15,846,4.702702702702703
2630019,4,B000H6SY1O,"Nothing from SCTV deserves less than 5 stars, as far as I'm concerned.

2630021,5,B000H6SY1O,"I remember when the only way I could see these Canadian broadcasts was on PBS from 10-10:30 Central Time back in the late 70s. It seem much more cutting edge than Saturday Night Live at the time. I remember how disappointed I was when they made their big move to Network TV (NBC) in the early 80s and moved to a 90 minute format on Friday Nights. It didn't see as fresh, young, cutting edge or funny as these early years. This is the best SCTV IMO.",1165449600,8,448,4.160919540229885
2630022,4,B000H6SY1O,"First of all, the cover of this set is misleading because it lists John Candy and Catherine O'Hara as though they were on equal footing with the rest of the cast.  But if you're a big fan of either, you'll be disappointed because there's hardly ANY of their material on these disks.  Tony Rosato and Robin Duke are funny.  So was Shemp Howard.  But we all know how we feel about those Shemp episodes!  Not quite what we paid the admission price for.

Secondly, as others have pointed out, this is a random selection of the early half-hour shows, with some overlap of later ""best of"" shows which are already out on DVD.  And not one bit of Harold Ramis.  (Some ads for this set even mention Martin Short, who was nowhere near this project!)

But thirdly, this still is a very, very funny set.  If you love SCTV, you will laugh your way through these discs, with lots of Bob & Doug, Count Floyd, and movie parodies such as Taxi Driver as done by Dick Cavett, etc.  This may be all we ever get of the early years, so if you're a fan, grab them while you can.
