Also fun to sing along with real kids you can see! My children went through both DVDs and CD, then moved on to other Chris Beatty CDs. I was glad they got to see Chris and Carol on the DVD before doing CDs; it makes the lessons more personal. The DVD also has graphics and upbeat, fun visuals to go with the lessons.",1393545600,3,468,4.211111111111111
