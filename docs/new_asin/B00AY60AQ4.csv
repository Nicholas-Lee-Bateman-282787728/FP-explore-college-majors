The end seemed somewhat out of place after the mesmerizing journeys through Lake Urmia in northwestern Iran. The director and others were jailed for making it.  This film warrants multiple viewings.",1516924800,,328,5.3076923076923075
8559042,4,B00AY60AQ4,"As I watched the scenes of the film, fairy tales and myths of my youth came to mind.  Why did I think of Cinderella's coach that turned back to a pumpkin and the horses to mice?  The magic beans and bag of gold of Jack and the Bean Stalk.  Would the angry fairy in the well respond to the messages in the jars and turn the salt water to fresh water?  Would the salt sea be happy with the  virgin wife and turn the salt sea to fresh water?  Will the tears turn to pearls?

Or, is there an allegorical message that medical care in Iran is no more benefit that the tears illness causes?
And the eyes must see only what is mandated?

8559043,5,B00AY60AQ4,Thought-provoking.  A visual treat.  The allegorical encounters of the collector of tears may well shed light on how life is sensed in contemporary Iran.,1387411200,,153,5.333333333333333
8559044,5,B00AY60AQ4,"This film is an ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE, every scene can be framed as a great piece of art. It is shot breathtakingly beautiful. And the metaphors, the meaning is deep and broad leaving you with thoughts and discussions for a life time.......I saw it few years ago and been looking for a DVD to be able to watch it again, and finally Amazon got it. The second viewing was as strong, as beautiful as the first. This is a film to be watched over and over again, to be watched in groups, in class rooms, to be discussed for it's depth, meaning and it's value as an art with it's breathtakingly beautiful and masterful cinematography.",1374883200,3,627,4.508771929824562
