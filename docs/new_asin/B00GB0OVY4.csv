6069677,3,B00GB0OVY4,"20 Ft Below is similar to Brick Mansions in plot.  Poor people and ruthless gangs used and controlled by government.  Brick Mansions depiction of Detroit is nothing but a shallow, self-righteous attempt to rewrite history and to fool the audience on why people are who they are.  20 Ft Belows message was more internal and focused on the intestinal fortitude of characters overcoming their plight.  Both have lead characters who have lost a wife.  However, Brick Mansions has a single protagonist who leads the story, while 20 Ft Below is more an ensemble. Ensemble pieces are difficult to write; the writer did not bring out the best in the story.  But the story is there.  The Skeeter character was fun to watch.  Sound and lighting were very nice for an ultra low budget film.  Low budget films can jump start careers.  I hope to see some of these actors in bigger budget films.",1405036800,,881,4.699346405228758
6069678,3,B00GB0OVY4,"Not much of a story line here.  Danny Trejo has done much better movies.  Unless you just like strange, this movie is not worth the time to watch.",1401148800,,146,4.178571428571429
6069679,3,B00GB0OVY4,"same old rough tough danny doing his thing,it has some good action in it and you wonder whos next or what next.worth watching.",1400803200,,126,4.521739130434782
6069680,2,B00GB0OVY4,I have over 1500 dvds and this is clearly one of the worse. There is a moral component to this movie but it moves very slowly and the acting is poor.,1399939200,,149,3.838709677419355
6069681,4,B00GB0OVY4,"Loved this movie.  It was pretty well done considering it was a low budget film. It starts out with a young female photojournalist, investigating a rumor of numerous people living underground in abandoned subway tunnels.(from the number of shows based on that premise, there must be a lot of abandoned subway tunnels.)  She is particularly interested in tracking down the leader of the cult, named ""Angel"" (Mr. Trejo).  She first connects with a young man who lives down there who appears to be somewhat delusional and perhaps schizophrenic and plays the part very well, but soon connects with an ex-policeman who went to the tunnels to deal with the grief of losing his wife leaving the world behind.  He and a few other underground characters become her guardians and guides as they explore the tunnels. Soon they encounter ""Angel"" (the majestic Mr Trejo) who plays the cult leader, poised to emerge from the tunnels to stage a revolution.  The acting is very good, with the Majestic Mr. Trejo being delightful evil and dressed in his sleeveless top displaying his impressive upper arms.  This one is a keeper for my Trejo collection!",1398902400,2,1136,4.9214659685863875
6069682,5,B00GB0OVY4,"Great movie, cutting edge editing. Tell your friends to check this out. Destined to be a cult classic. Excellent flick!",1397779200,2,119,5.0
6069683,3,B00GB0OVY4,"I agree with other reviews; a good move, but not great.  Role of Angel not up to expectations from Danny Trejo.  This was probably a low-budget film; the writer, the executive producer, and all the other producers [except one -- and they directed it] were actors in the film.

Overall, it's not a classic [yet], but one never knows. . .",1397260800,3,336,4.475409836065574
6069684,3,B00GB0OVY4,It would have  helped if there had been a bit more character development. Flesh them out a bit more so to speak.,1396224000,3,112,4.090909090909091
6069685,3,B00GB0OVY4,"Angel (Danny Trejo) is a tough intellectual anarchist who rules the deep underground of NYC. In the opening scene he kidnaps and kills the wealthy Jason Wells (Peter Dobson) which leads to an unsuccessful police sweep.  Jake (Frank Krueger) is an ex-cop who lost his wife, rules the area between the streets and Angel's world. Chelsea (Kinga Philipps) is a reporter who successfully gets an interview with Angel and then takes her time leaving the tunnels.

Jake's speeches on his lost love were as badly written and delivered as Angel's anarchy fluff. In fact the whole film had a nausea that reminded me of ""Billy Jack.""

The film is supposed to be a metaphor about living in the dark and alone with Jake representing the microcosm and the underworld the macrocosm. It was done rather sloppily with unrealistic characters.

For Trejo fans it is far better than ""Voodoo Possession"" but not as good as ""Bullet.""  Can't wait for ""Volcano Zombies.""

No sex or nudity. I don't recall any F-bombs.",1395273600,5,993,4.846153846153846
8621887,1,B00GB0OVY4,"If you liked Machete, Bad Ass, or even Dead in Tuscon... you will HATE this. The story is trite, the sets are crummy, and the dialog is inane, or illogical, or both. Do not waste your money on it. I have watched some bad direct to DVD movies but this one is the worst. I turned it off after 25 minutes of torture.
I guess I'll put it in my next yard sale and hope that the buyer doesn't ask any questions. (I'd hate to lie to them, but if I tell the truth, they won't buy it.)",1522627200,,476,3.86734693877551
8621888,4,B00GB0OVY4,"Interesting story line about people who have hit rock bottom, or have just mentally checked out.  If you like Danny Trejo when he's bad, you'll probably like the movie.",1488672000,,168,4.793103448275862
