5674907,4,B00BUELAEU,"I have searched many times for this movie and was delighted to find it. It is not earth shattering but a good way to spend a couple hours on a rainy afternoon, to make you smile, just to look at one of the actors! Fun. Fun.",1393459200,,223,3.869565217391304
5674908,3,B00BUELAEU,"When her three daughters threaten to challenge the conditions of their father's will, a wealthy woman (Thelma Ritter) hires an attorney (Kirk Douglas) to arrange marriages for her three daughters. Two of the daughters, a health nut (Julie Newmar) and a patroness of the arts (Leslie Parrish, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE) prove easy but it's the third daughter (Mitzi Gaynor) who proves to be the stumbling block. This romantic comedy gets the full on Ross Hunter, even though he had nothing to do with the film, glamour treatment (sets, costumes, jewels and furs etc.) and director Michael Gordon who had a big hit with PILLOW TALK is the director. One can see what the picture was supposed to be and everyone tries hard but ... no soap. The screenplay might (and that's a very iffy might) have worked with, say, Tony Curtis and Debbie Reynolds in the leads. But Kirk Douglas doesn't have the light touch required for material like this and Gaynor, who's cute and a terrific dancer, has an artificiality about her acting that often renders her charmless. It's slack when it should be fizzy. With Gig Young giving his patented ""best friend who loses the girl"" performance, William Bendix, William Windom, Elizabeth MacRae, Dick Sargent and Edy Williams.

The Universal Vault MOD DVDr is a decent anamorphic wide screen (1.85) transfer.",1383955200,3,1331,4.968609865470852
5674909,5,B00BUELAEU,"I want this in the USA!!
This is such a cute movie and is full of stars. A wealthy mother takes it upon herself to match up her daughters with their future husbands.  She is very clever and sure to get her way. It is a romantic comedy that will have you smiling all the way through the movie.",1380585600,8,292,3.9491525423728815

5674917,5,B00BUELAEU,"Mitzi Gaynor in technicolor is all I need to say! Add Kirk Douglas, a mostly drunk Gig Young and a light story  and you're in for treat. A must for fans of Mitzi . . .",1412294400,4,167,3.638888888888889
5674918,5,B00BUELAEU,"If you like adult screwball comedies of the 1960s then you will probably be amused with this film from Universal Studios made in 1963. Kirk Douglas displays a natural talent for the funny stuff as he portrays a lawyer made to play match-maker by a rich client. The great cast of '60s heads includes Mitzi Gaynor, Julie Newmar, Gig Young, Thelma Ritter and many more of those ""oh, I know THAT guy"" types that you often see in these films. It's always good to be reminded of the cool cars, haircuts, clothes and beatniks from the early 1960s and the story moves along at a nice pace.

Nice anamorphic color print too. Beware the Region 2 pan & scan version.. THIS is the copy to get. Picture is bright and clear and looks fine on a large HD screen. Yeah, I'm glad I bought it.",1412035200,14,774,4.337931034482758

5674922,5,B00BUELAEU,I LOVE this movie.  I've been waiting over two decades for it to come out on VHS/DVD (DVD won).  It is a light hearted G-rated romantic comedy with stars popular in the 1950s and 1960s,1406160000,5,184,4.228571428571429

8573995,5,B00BUELAEU,"Mitzi Gaynor shines while Kirk Douglas is manic in this great, timeless movie.

Although Kirk Douglas is billed as the star Mitzi Gaynor steals every scene she is in. She is beautiful and amazingly funny as a professional, stiff, marketing research expert.

Sadly this was her last film before she went on to be a huge stage and TV star. She even holds the record for the longest standing ovation at an academy awards show. She also stared in 10 very successful variety tv specials.

Thelma Ritter is also excellent as the wise talking Mother of three rich, spoiled women.  Julie Newman also gives a great performance as daughter 2 as does Leslie Parish as daughter 3.

Gig Young plays Gig Young as he normally did in films and thats pretty funny.

The basic story is about a mother who wants to marry her daughters off that hires a lawyer to play matchmaker.

Very funny scene on a sailboat.",1529452800,,892,4.572327044025157

8573999,5,B00BUELAEU,"Great Kirk Douglas comedy film in which he is tasked with finding husbands for three beautiful wealthy young women whose mother wants them all settled before she gets any older and their choices in men any worse.  Thelma Ritter is well cast as the very wealthy widow who thinks nothing of offering her attractive single attorney (Dougles) $100,000.00 to get her girls mates, or of betting on the outcome.  Throw in gig Young as Douglas's zanny friend and a sail boat that's been tampered with and it's comedy at it's best.  The soon to be brides are played by natural beauty -  Julie Newmar, Leslie Parrish and Mitzi Gaynor.  I saw this movie as a kid in the 60's and it still hasn't lost it's appeal as a hilarious comedy.",1453852800,3,723,4.530769230769231
