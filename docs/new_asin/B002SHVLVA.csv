8379400,5,B002SHVLVA,"I bought this DVD to use at home with my children who are home-schooled. I use to do Gilad videos back in the 80s! It is hard to find exercise DVDs for kids that are not overly complicated and that are interesting and appealing to kids. At first my daughter laughed at this DVD and thought it looked silly, but she ended up liking it so much we bought another Gilad title, ""Fun in the Sun."" My kids are 4 and 10 and we all enjoy this DVD for some fun fitness!",1413849600,,459,4.0

I like this video. 2 different workouts, manageable length, even the 4yo (now 5) can do most of it. 8yo says he'd only give it a 2.5 star rating because of a couple aerobic moves that are tricky (I have trouble with them, too), but I think on the whole he enjoys it as well. Pleasant scenery, everyone's mostly covered (I do wish his female co-leads wore shorts instead of leotards, but at least they're covered.) Gilad has a sense of humor that's a little different, but my boys seem to enjoy it.

All in all, I like it well enough that I will be purchasing another (there are 3 separate DVDs available).

We also recommend Billy Blanks Tae Bo for kids - it's longer/harder but high energy and good workout. We alternate between Gilad and Billy.  ;)",1331251200,2,896,4.412121212121212
