7287998,3,B00ZQ2YNXM,"I'm a late-comer to ""The Deadliest Catch"" so I ordered Season 1-9 and watched them. Some seasons were very low ($8-11) and all were 4 -5 discs.
So when Season 10 was available but at $35, I hesitated. That's a LOT of money even for 6 discs!  Finally, I broke down and ordered Season 10.
Season 10 ended on Disc 4, episode 2.  After that, came 11 episodes of ""The Bait"".  The latter is fun for maybe 3 episodes at the most and all were talking about standing by for the 2 hour Season Premiere..... of nothing.  I could have easily given this 2 stars but I moved up 1 because that's considered ""OK"".

If you love The Bait, you will love this DVD set.  I have Season 11 on my DVR and that's how it's going to stay from now on.",1438128000,5,723,4.056338028169014

7288041,5,B00ZQ2YNXM,"Great show as usual! My husband and I own Seasons 1 thru 10 now. Some customers complain about 'The Bait' (which is where captains sit around talking about their fishing) being separate from each seasons show.

My take on it? I like having 'The Bait' separate! That way I can enjoy the crabbing show! Without having to watch the summation/Q&A of the shows with the captains...because they are at the end of the DVD.  yaay!

Each DVD has been well packaged and no issues with the DVD's.",1486771200,,485,4.551724137931035

7288045,3,B00ZQ2YNXM,"The show is great, as always, including  The Bait. The disk setup however is the worst they could have come up with. Each The Bait episode is a prelude to a specific episode of The Deadliest Catch but they are on separate disks. This means you have to put The Bat disk in watch 1 episode then put The Deadliest Catch disk in watch 1 episode, and so on, and so on, and so on. But the worst part of the entire thing is there is no information as to which The Bait episode goes with which The Deadliest Catch episode and NO there is not the same number of episodes of each show. This means that episode 4 of The Bait may go with episode 6 of The Deadliest Catch. The only way to get this info is to go online, to a non-related site, and see which episode aired on what date and create your own episode list.",1474588800,,804,4.025

7288068,5,B00ZQ2YNXM,Love this show -- another GREAT season.  I wish they had placed The Bate episodes before the episodes of the show on the DVD though.  It would have been more fun to watch The Bate first as they were a good intro to the episodes.,1439769600,,228,4.044444444444444
