3438178,5,B0019L21H4,"The Godfather Part III suffers from the marvels of the first two films. Brando, De Niro, Caan, Duvall, and many other stars are absent. The Mafia is no longer the central part of this story. And it's actually hard to understand this film without watching the first two films. But does that mean it fails to be a movie overall? Of course, not.

Despite being the weakest in the trilogy, The Godfather Part III makes for a powerful conclusion to this epic saga. It's now 1979, and Michael Corleone is diagnosed with diabetes. He's separated from his wife, and his children are estranged. For years, Michael has felt guilt from not only isolating himself from his own family, but also having his brother Fredo killed. Now, he wants to go perfectly legitimate with his risky business. As you can see, this has now become a tale of redemption and forgiveness.

Francis Ford Coppola does what he does best here. He moves the story along, with some interesting and powerful elements that have not been found in the first two films. The script is still brilliant the third time around; I don't think you can improve anything here. The music sounds reused, but they still become an important aspect in every scene that requires it.

Of course, we cannot forget the cast (whether good or bad). Al Pacino is as amazing as ever. He's still superior in the first two films, but here, we get to see more emotion and more skill. The last two scenes are especially powerful; it still gets me a bit teary-eyed. Diane Keaton is still spectacular as Kay; same goes for Talia Shire as Connie. Andy Garcia becomes a welcome addition in the cast. He's perfect as the late Sonny's son, Vincent. It's very amusing to see Joe Mantegna as Joey Zasa . . . especially if you try hard not to envision him as Fat Tony. Donal Donnelly as the Archbishop can be best described as extraordinary: he's believable alright. B.J. Harrison as the Corleones' new adviser isn't really as great as Robert Duvall in the first two films, but he can still manage to make us appreciate his performance. Finally, we come to Sofia Coppola as Mary. Countless people find her dull and wooden, easily the worst performance in the entire trilogy. While I do find her wooden, she really makes it more authentic. She is oblivious to what's going on in her father's business; she's more of a simpleton rather than an expert in the Mafia business. And I think Sofia pretty much fits that personality here.

It's true that The Godfather Part III is not in the same league as the first two classic installments, but this is still a fitting conclusion, and it is an extraordinary movie. Just make sure you've seen Godfather I and II before you see this one.

""There's no sugarcoating the magnitude of the cinematic disaster that ""Part III"" represents.""

""Let's all hope that there will be no Part IV.""

I think a bandwagon of bashing gathered momentum, and for those who like to look for chinks in the armor, this film seemed the opportunity to throw stones.  I say wait and see: in years to come history will mark part III as a fitting conclusion to the Corleone saga.  No, it is not a masterpiece of the stature of the first two Coppola classics, but dear friends, I'd argue neither were ""Casino"" or ""Goodfellas"" or ""Once Upon a Time in America"", and although those mafia-themed films are all highly acclaimed, none of them reach the heights of the first two Godfather films, and that shouldn't be held against them.  Neither should it be held against GF III.

Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo returned to the characters they know better than anyone, and fashioned a tale that dovetails believably into the Corleone history of the first two films.

Al Pacino returns as Don Michael Corleone.  Michael has the strength and cunning of his father, Vito, and an almost superhuman ability to foresee future events.  But where the great Vito Corleone also had a keen devotion to family and compassion for his fellow man, Michael has a cold ruthlessness that allows him to order the murder of family members.

Michael is a tragic character.  In the opening of the first film (and we are told in Puzo's original novel) Michael is something of a disappointment to his father and family exactly because he does not want to join the family business.  He enlists in the Marines after Pearl Harbor, even though his father has pulled strings to keep him out of the military.  He's planning a career as a teacher, married to his college sweetheart, but even the enemies of the family know that Michael is an outsider in the family business.

The attempted murder of his father pulls Michael quickly into the inner circle.  Circumstances outside his control compel him to become exactly the person he does not want to be.

In an early scene in part II wife Kay (wonderfully played by Diane Keaton in all the films) reminds Michael that seven years earlier he had promised her that the family would be ""completely legitimate"" within five years.

Part III opens with Michael receiving a high Catholic honor, bestowed on behalf of the Pope himself.  The Church is in trouble. (Based on the real-life papal banking scandal of the early `80s.) Michael is willing to give Archbishop Gilday, the Vatican banker, 600 million in exchange for control of Immobiliare, the largest real estate and construction company in Italy.  When the Archbishop tells Michael that it will be difficult to get the Vatican to approve this deal, Michael says that the family has completely given up all illegitimate businesses. This storyline drives the rest of the film.

The Corleones have sold their Vegas hotels and casinos and the other families, used to wetting their beaks in the Corleone fountain, feel left behind as Michael tries to move his family completely away from organized crime.

Talia Shire returns again as Michael's sister, Connie, and her role is amplified as counselor as well.  Women are marginalized and completely outside the family business in the earlier films.  Connie is also a mentor and proponent for the next up-and-coming Corleone, Sonny's illegitimate son Vincent, played with intelligence and menace by Andy Garcia in perhaps his first major screen role.  (Coppola seems to have a particular genius for finding and using acting giants before they are well known.  Pacino, Keaton, Robert Deniro, Robert Duvall and John Cazale were all relatively unknown before appearing in the first films.)

Much has been made of daughter Sofia Coppola playing Michael's daughter Mary.  The truth is, she has the look, but the romance between Mary and Vincent seems more awkward than passionate, and since Vincent is smart and ambitious, it doesn't make much sense that he would pursue Mary for any reason other than passion since Michael discourages their pairing.  Naysayers can't help but mention that Winona Ryder dropped out of this part at the last minute. (To make Edward Scissorhands.) I can't help but be reminded of the critical thrashing Angelica Huston took for playing the lead in an early film of her famous father, prior to an acting career that resulted in an Academy Award.  Hopefully Ms. Coppola takes some satisfaction that her career progressed to Oscar nominations as a director herself.  In short - she is not so bad that she ruins this film.

Robert Duvall is missed as Tom Hagen, and George Harrison is bland as new family attorney B.J. Harrison.

The business subplot runs parallel with the plot of the torment of Michael.  As he grows older, and makes more attempts to get out of crime, he nonetheless sees death and tragedy in his wake.  He wants to make amends.  He wants to leave a legacy for his children and to reconcile with Kay, and some of the strongest scenes in the film are when he seems to be succeeding, if only a little.  At one point he consults a priest he thinks will have insight into the Immobiliare deal.  This wise priest feels that Michael has a need for confession.  Startled, Michael admits he hasn't confessed in thirty years.  The priest coaxes Michael because ""it's never too late"", and the work of the two actors in this scene is exceptional.

There is a format to the three films: all begin with a large ensemble celebratory scene which includes a few private moments to set the story in motion.  All end with a montage of murder as Corleone enemies are eliminated.  There is a style and elegance and richness in The Godfather films that exists in this one as well.

The first two movies won ""Best Picture"".  The last of ""The Lord of the Rings"" films did the same, but I don't recall vitriol being spread on the LOTR films that did not.  The Godfather part III should be enjoyed not for what it is not, but for what it is.",1240185600,3,6038,4.779170684667309

I was reading some of the reviews and some didn't feel this lived up to I and II. What helps me like this movie is the fact that I watched them one after the other and didn't wait almost 2 decades to watch this third installment. So, no expectations, I watched it and loved it.

I do understand about the Sophia Coppola's character though, not meeting expectations. If her character was more likeable, more sympathetic (she seemed like a rich, spoiled kid who enjoyed seducing relatives and having sex with her cousin in her parent's house while her father's only a few doors down the hallway!) the ending could have been more powerful.",1237939200,,1106,6.836879432624113
3438182,4,B0019L21H4,"What works for me in this film...

1. Pacino's convincing characterization of an aging Michael Corleone, his self evaluations/realizations/rebukes, the emotional confession in Rome, his reactions to the continuing violence. The change in his personality and demeanor towards Kaye, less righteous, a little more reflective and doubting...his is the strongest delivery in this film, most convincing and Pacino is always good to watch on film.

2. The presence of time. One of the things I think a lot of people overlook is how well this film looked. It was not cheapened, glossed over.
If it was to have come out in 1977 or 1990 you really couldn't tell.
They did a good job of blending age, history, lighting and time
so the films transition nicely together.
Excellent job on costume, makeup, production. I would say Garcia and the other hoods were the only one's that seemed out of place visually and it messes with that over all look and feel. Italy was beautiful again, cinemaphotography was accurate, warm, inviting, just as in the first film.

3. Sophia Coppola...all right, in my opinion because I am a guy, she looks amazing in this film. Her hair, her lips, her eyes and face,
she's beautiful..about the acting? As real as it gets for the part she played. Is she any different than any other bad actor of a ignorant, clueless, innocent, teenage gal, sister/cousin/relative you had in your family? No. She fits because her own glass house inside that of the biggest crime family in the world seems so much on the brink of colapse and you can see it in her face...that my friends is something you can't teach an actor..I believed she didn't fit the Corleone mantra, believed she didn't know what was going on as she was coming of age..she was like bambi in a forest of wolves, and she represents that sort of ignorant/bliss that Michael Corleone could never get to and in the end she perishes, you never saw it coming...it was brilliant to cast her
cause she didn't fit. And having been around some wealthy families, there are sometimes those children who seem to not characterize the ambitions of the mother and father..hapless but lovely creatures inside these houses of greed, ambition, power.

4. The best part of the film and not talked about all that much; That opera piece to finish out the story was amazing.
As all the rest of the story develops behind the scenes,
as Michael's life is threatened by a sniper, as Connie watches her uncle perish from eating canoli she doped, as priests are shot, a european syndicate boss murdered, a pope dies, you are on the edge of your seat
watching a visual so complex on stage that it almost prepares you for the conclusion of the film, as Michael Corleone watches his daughter die before his very own eyes. How could you not be moved?
I am sorry for those who consider this film to be weak, but that
15+ minutes or so fits into probably some of the best moments of film ever I've seen.

Problems:
1. Wish Kay had more prominent role in the film. Her lines were weak.

2. Andy Garcia as the last Don. He's a good actor, but there is nothing more wrong with this film than to see him as the Don at the end. For some reason, it just did not work. However, it did complete that image of a dying family and Michael's continuing inept decision making, which may be why it was done in this way. The bastard child of the Don's brother Sonny comes to claim the power willingly, but there just is no depth to that character and he just comes off as a punk..even Sonny wrestled with his temper, and it's that internal struggle that gives the impression of strength...not attitude without recourse...Garcia's character seems more fitting into the modern day idea of a gang more than this ""family"" we've been watching for decades. For Michael, wanting to go legit all this time, it might have been a more compelling story to have had Garcia killed in the same way he killed his brother to stop this ""Sicillian thing"" Kaye spoke of. To give the power over to his nephew did not seem natural, based on watching him struggle with it through Godfather II and almost all of Godfather III, and in godfather I where Brando's Don showed every sign of a breaking heart when he heard Michael had got involved in the family business...
I rate the choice here for Coppola/Puzo to do this as worth a chip of one complete star out of 5.
Michael's absolution would have best been played out by him turning against that which he'd created finally. Realizing that there is no real way out unless you turn it off completely..While maybe this character of Michael wasn't able to, like so many other mortal men of power, what a grand Shakespearean conclusion it would have been, after seeing his daughter killed on the steps for him to reclaim power of the Don, clean house by ending any blood line (sacrificing his own nephew) give all his money and personal ambitions up and away and spend his last days in Italy with Kay at his side and with maybe less guilty feelings. Of course, then the murder of Michael Corleone by vengeful souls at the end of my version of the film would have had him finally dying in absolution, and for having finally gotten it right this time. I think then you can leave off Godfather III having had enough.

3. Like to have seen more info about what happened to Tom, or flashbacks
to Godfather I....nothing emphasizes the death of a family more than rememberances of the family when it was strong and together..

It is worth watching and hopefully this helps you...",1237766400,,5516,4.598577235772358
3438183,3,B0019L21H4,"The Bottom Line:

Convoluted and overlong, The Godfather Part III should be commended for trying to tell a different story (I and II were essentially two parts of the same tale) and for its several powerful scenes, but it's too messy a film to be worth recommending, and that's not mentioning the unimpressive turn by Sofia Coppola.",1233446400,,332,4.824561403508772
3438184,5,B0019L21H4,"Sixteen long years after the release of ""The Godfather Part 2"", Paramount Pictures along with writer and director Francis Ford Coppola, and co-writer Mario Puzo, delivered to audiences the final chapter in one of the greatest cinematic sagas ever committed to film.

""The Godfather Part 3"" finds Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) closer than ever to realizing his dream of transitioning his family into strictly legitimate business dealings. As a part of improving the public's image of both he and his family, Michael is reaching out to the Catholic Church through the charitable donation of millions of his own dollars. Just as Michael has finally found a viable way out of the life of crime that he's known for so many years, a rival gangster seeks to move in on the impending power vacuum Michael's departure will undoubtedly leave behind. Yet this obvious power play may not come without its fair share of bloodshed. Enter Michael's nephew Vincent (Andy Garcia), an up-and-coming mafia hood who wants nothing more than to protect his beloved uncle and preserve the legacy of the Corleone family for years to come.

For some reason, that I cannot wrap my head around, ""The Godfather Part 3"" is almost universally panned as being the weakest entry in the trilogy. Personally, I can't figure out what the problem is with this movie that causes so many people to essentially loathe watching it. For me, no matter how many times I watch the film, and do my best to find some fault in it, I still walk away enjoying it as much as I did its two predecessors. Plus, I can't seem to find any glaring problems with the film. Perhaps audiences just don't respond well to the redemptive message inherent within the story, maybe there are just not enough darker elements, such as murder, betrayal, sadness, and despair to satisfy their typical mafia fix. Whatever the case may be, I doubt I will ever understand why this installment is so maligned by most viewers, but I digress.

Now, let's talk about what I feel is the main focus of this final chapter in ""The Godfather saga"". I believe the purpose of this third film is two-fold; first, it is an appropriate vehicle with which Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo nicely tie up any loose ends still left over from the initial two installments, while introducing us to a fascinating final act for the Corleone family. Second, ""The Godfather Part 3"" can almost be viewed as a thank you to the fans on behalf of the entire cast and crew of the series. What I mean by that is, after ""The Godfather Part 2"" there was a 16 year gap between films, hinting that perhaps the Corleone family's story was finished, but by returning to the series for one more film the cast and crew reward the audience for their loyalty (and patience) to the franchise. Not to mention the film brings the entire story of Michael Corleone full circle in a very powerful, yet bittersweet sort of way.

Speaking of Michael's character arc within this grand trilogy, there is a definite metamorphosis that Michael goes through over the course of his journey. In ""The Godfather"", Michael is an idealistic young man, untainted by the dark world that his father and brothers belong to; however, over the course of that film certain events lead to Michael's eventual baptism by fire into the underworld. Then we come to ""The Godfather Part 2"", where the darkness that had once consumed his father and brothers has now consumed Michael completely, and the results of his decisions do not come without a cost. Finally, we arrive at ""The Godfather Part 3"" and the path he has chosen has resulted in so much death, despair, and loneliness that Michael finally is beginning to realize that perhaps the only way to find some measure of peace is to seek redemption for the sins of his past.

On a side note, as a fan of the entire series, I appreciate that this film's story includes numerous nods and/or mentions to events that occurred in the previous films in the trilogy. When a film franchise references events within its own history, I find that to be an added bonus, and shows that those involved in the films take great pride in their work, and strive to further enrich the audience's experience while watching them.

From an acting standpoint, this series continues to be one of the greatest examples of brilliant acting one could ever hope to witness. For Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, I'm surprised that they were still able to find new ground to cover with their respective characters. Al's performance as Michael is more reserved and at times weary, yet still as emotionally charged as ever. Diane Keaton brings to Kay a quiet strength and an indomitable will power that at times rivals even that of Michael's, a trait no doubt developed over the course of many years of dealing in his world. Also returning for a third go-round is actress Talia Shire (""Rocky"" franchise) as Michael's older sister, Connie. Finally, Talia is given a character arc that has much more substance to it than what she previously had been given, no doubt a rewarding turn of events for her as an actress. Talia's arc was much different from that of the previous two films; no longer a victim of any kind, Connie is much more in charge, and accepting of the world that had consumed her entire family for the last two generations.

Newcomers to the franchise include the considerable talents of Andy Garcia, Bridget Fonda, Eli Wallach, and Joe Mantegna. Each of the new cast members brought a sense of newness to the film, something that each of these three films has surprisingly managed to do with every release. Andy Garcia was the standout performance for me out of the new members of the cast. His energetic performance harkened back to James Caan's volatile character of Sonny from the original film, a character void that had never truly been filled by any other member of the cast within the series.

One thing is for certain after watching not only ""The Godfather Part 3"", but the entire trilogy, is that no matter how glamorized the life of the mafia may appear to be (as shown by most movies dealing with the subject), this kind of lifestyle is not worth all the heartache, sadness, and death that surrounds everyone involved. It's true that even ""The Godfather"" trilogy glamorized this life to an extent, but at the same time, each of the films took some time within their respective stories to reveal the consequences of the dark choices of life and death that these people make throughout their lives.

""The Godfather Part 3"" is yet another triumphant piece of American cinema, expertly crafted by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, serving as the perfect final chapter in one of the most beloved film sagas of all time.

""The Godfather Part 3"" is rated R for violence and language.",1232150400,4,6781,4.729272419627749
3438185,2,B0019L21H4,"The first time I saw it, I felt disappointed. Several viewings later, I thought it wasn't so bad -not as good as the first two, but not bad. Last night I saw the trilogy non-stop, and yes, it is THAT bad. Here's what's wrong with it:

1.- Tom Hagen. He's crucial and he's missing. There's no Godfather III without him. And if Paramount didn't want to pay Robert Duvall whatever he wanted to reprise his role, they should quit show business altogether. Instead we get George Hamilton! What were they thinking, the penny-pincher idiots!

2.- Michael Corleone. Not the same guy. Sure, Al Pacino plays him, but unfortunately, he forgot everything about the character. Michael Corelone doesn't ""love public speech""; he's a soft spoken, cold blooded, silent maniac who feels a fish out of water at weddings, first communions, baptisms, New Year's Eve, anything except funerals. A guy that seldom talks and never reveals his emotions. Here, he's a gregarious and bombastic party guy who yells all the time, talks all the time, curses, dances, mingles, counsels all the time. He's more Tony Montana than Michael Corleone. Not the same guy, I tell you. The hairdo doesn't help, either.

3.- Mary Corleone. Too ugly. Sorry; no offense, but that's it. Her character is a princess; it deserved a knockout beauty. Or... the part should have been changed to an ugly duckling in love with her handsome relative, a S.O.B. who uses her to climb to the top while fooling around on the side. But such as it is, both the part and the actress are simply not believable. And Ms Coppola can't act, by the way. I'm glad she turned out to be a magnificent filmmaker.

4.- Vincent Corleone. Too remote. Sonny's bastard boy. Mmmmmm, I dunno...too many heirs in front of him in line of succession. What happened to them? Coppola doesn't mention. Andy Garcia makes a terrific Corleone, but his part seems implausible. The obvious role was for him to play Connie's boy, Carlo Rizzi Jr, who happened to be Michael's first godson! Then everything falls into place: Carlo hates his godfather for having wacked his dad; Michael has a weak spot for him for the same reason, Mary has a fatal crush on her weasel cousin, he gets far too ambitious... see what I mean?

5.-Don Altobello. Altowho? Where was him in the previous films? If he was Connie's Godfather, why wasn't he at the wedding? And how come he knows Don Luchese? And who is Don Luchese? As for the actor, Eli Wallach plays the part with gusto; a coniving Sicillian Tuco. I loved it!

6.- The Vatican plot. Too murky, too preposterous. Coppola wanted to exploit the Banco Ambrosiano affair? Fine with me. Pope John Paul I strange and sudden death? Fine with me. Wanted to say that the Church is a bigger, meaner mafia than the mob itself? No problemo. But the Immobiliare thing gets far too confused, and one senses Coppola doesn't know where he's going or wants to. For such grand statements, he should have refined his story to perfection. By the way, both Pope Paul VI and John Paul I died in 1978, not 1979. Holy Blooper!

So there you have it. A movie made merely for the money, by people who have grown to hate the previous two. Not a good start by any standard. I heard Coppola was so fed up with the Corleones, he wanted to make ""Abbott & Costello meet the Godfather"". Well, if his heart was really into it ...Harvey Korman was around, Buddy Hackett was around, Marlon Brando was around ...he should have made it instead!",1229212800,41,3455,4.644844517184943

It doesn't appear that Puzo contributed much to the screenplay. Neither our love of the characters nor the amazing acting talent can overcome the lack of a consistent story line, the painful near reconciliation of Michael and Kay or the retread feel of the movie. Sophie Coppola is no actress, but Talia Shire as Connie was terrible. It was not really Shire's fault: Coppola takes the flighty, feminine Connie from Godfather I and turns her into an unconvincing, interfering ""Godmother"" -- ordering killings, etc. Al Pacino, as has been the case in the latter part of his career, overacted the part of Michael and essentially changed Michael from a serious, unsmiling, calculating, cold-blooded gangster/killer to an outgoing, expressive, gregarious, repentant philanthropist. The transformation, although years in the making, is not believable.

3438215,3,B0019L21H4,"1972's The Godfather as we all know is perhaps the greatest movie of the 20th century! Part II soon followed in 1974 and was just as great as the first. Many years go by without any mention of a new Godfather movie thus sealing The Godfather as a two part masterpiece in cinema history. Fast forward to 1990 when Part III appears. Many people were left scratching their heads wondering ""why another sequel after all this time?"" Perhaps the only true answer is MONEY!

Part III jumps in time to 1979 when Don Michael Corleone, now an aging gray haired man, tries to make the Corleone family legit after many years by purchasing the Vatican's share in Immobiliare: a European real estate company. The purchase however turns out to be a swindle set up by chairman Licio Lucchesi.  He steals money from the Vatican Bank with the help of bank head Archbishop Gilday and accountant Frederick Keinszig, and intends to use Michael's ""investment"" to cover his tracks. He furthermore proceeds to have Michael assassinated with the hall of Don Altobello, a trusted friend of the Corleone family. Meanwhile, Michael takes Vincent Mancini (Santino's son with a mistress of his) under his wing and eventually makes him the new don of the Corleone family.

This is a pretty neat story with subplots such as Vincent falling in love with Michael's daughter and Michael trying to rekindle his relationship with Kay. The biggest upset about this movie is that is came about 16 years too late! Recurring characters like Michael, Kay, Al Neri, Connie, are all old and Michael even suffers from diabetes and has a stroke at one point. And what ever happened to Tom Hagen?!

brilliant acting from Al Pacino as the world-weary and heartsick Michael. The garden confession was heart-rending.
Sofia Coppola was not bad, it's just that her languid monotone and diction detracted from what could have been an adequate performance. Still, I wonder how Mary could have been in the hands of a more experienced actress...
guess we'll never know, will we?
Andy Garcia's Vincent is cocky and charming, but his reaction to Mary's death in the end was laughable (Mary! no!). What, no grief? I think he had more chemistry with sultry Bridget Fonda who had too little screen time.
Another plus was the haunting love theme sung by Harry Connick, Jr. Too bad it did not have more airplay!

-Pacino is no longer Michael Corleone, he's just Pacino.
-Its not a period piece so it lacks the detached romanticism of the previous two films.
-The story in this installment just doesn't click.  Consequently this is the only film in the series that seems to be twice as long as it should be.
-Robert Duvall is not in the film.  I'm not sure who's fault this really was  but the issue needed to be resolved at all costs before filming began.
-Winona Ryder bowed out for health reasons and was replaced by Coppola's novice of an actor daughter.
-Joe Mantegna and Andy Garcia's characters seem like they belong in a second rate Godfather knockoff not an actual Godfather film.
-They waited too long to make this film.  A lot had changed in the 15 years between Part III and Part II and there just isn't enough visual continuity between the films.
-The film needed some more great actors turning in Oscar worthy performances.  The first two films had Brando, Caan, Cazale, Duvall, Strasberg and DeNiro turning in career defining roles.  This one just does not have anyone of that caliber.",1437350400,,1292,4.567099567099567

3438315,2,B0019L21H4,"Not very interesting or meaningful. Coppola's vision never comes into focus, which is a shame, because there is a lot to resolve from the first two movies.

Its like it tries to be a brand new movie on its own, rather than the culmination of the events and relationships in I and II. Only the characters and some history of the previous films seems applicable.

Likely, Coppola was trapped by trying to do too much - trying to conclude the Godfather narrative; having Michael redeem himself while still protecting his family; trying to produce a unique film on its own, etc. The power of movies I and II is their clear and rich narratives. The story-telling is like a Greek classic; everything resolving itself so finally and tellingly: ""the son can do nothing except what he sees the father doing.""

Film II was the interesting beginning of Vito, (who seemingly never made a mistake,) and the unraveling of Michael, (who, in trying to legitimize the family's ""business,"" involves himself to a much more final degree; a place where Vito would never have gone.) In that, Michael, who responded to the violent threat against his father by using violence, is a greater villain than his father, who appeared very comfortable with violence; handling everything like the Sicilian he was.

Coppola was narrating the course of this country through these movies, and to a certain extent, he succeeded. However, as this country has historically become more fragmented and less focused over the last 100 years, perhaps this is why III fares so badly. There is definitely no clear resolution with the Corleone family at the end of this movie.

Pacino is very ""un-Michael"" in this movie, in that he emotes too much, and is far more expressive and physical than he was in the first two movies. Historically, Michael's character is detached, brooding, and very intense. These are his hallmarks, and is why he is so believable in the first two movies. Where did this Michael go? Answer: there is simply too much time passed between the first two movies and this one to believably extend this man.

Where was Bobby Duval? Didn't anyone think he was a vital part of the ""family?"" They had to write him off? Ah, there was a salary dispute and Duval refused to reprise Hagen. (Accordingly to the wiki, the plot line was supposed to revolve around him taking over the family business: a much more interesting story than the one we got.)

Without Hagen, the ""family"" is a very small fraction of what it was. In fact, we see precious little interaction between Michael and his two children; the ""family"" he sold his soul to protect. (Didn't we see more warmth and involvement from Vito?) So who cares about what happens to Sophia? Michael certainly didn't.

Coppola's daughter is not strong in this role. There is very little interesting about her, and she serves only as a plot device. Vintage Coppola would have done this better. As it was, he got to cast his fully grown daughter as a principle in this movie. Great for him.

Talia Shire is the only one whose character development made any sense. At least she had some through-line from the previous two, and has become a thoroughly ""family"" woman in every sense. She is corrupt and an advocate of violence; a complete turn-around from her original. It made sense - otherwise, she would have over-dosed on pills years ago.

Diane Keaton served no purpose in this movie except to simply be there. Her words to Michael mean nothing. She is there at the end, (why?) to see him get his comeuppance. Aside from that, she served her purpose by the end of II. They couldn't get Duval, so they bring back Keaton. Another wasted character.

Michael has this big scene at the coffin of Don Tommasino, (WHO? Exactly.) Apparently this guy was Vito Corleone the second, because the words Michael tells to him are exactly what he would be telling his father, had he lived 20 more years, (which conceivably, could have happened, as Vito is in his late 50's when he dies in part I.) Michael has this long heart-to-heart with a stiff that we know, (and care,) nothing about. Not very scintillating plot progression, here.

Seems to me Puzo let Coppola form most of this story himself, which is not a good thing for him to do, simply because he is too creative and unstructured. His best work comes from adapting a story-line that already exists; like I and II, and Apocalypse Now. When he's given full tiller, he isn't able to restrict his highly creative faculties. (Plus, the lack of the Hagen resolution left them with a fraction of the story-line this should/could have had. Blame Paramount for this, folks. It was their budgetary call.)

Andy Garcia - nice guy, good actor. Tried to make him an amalgamation of Sonny, Fredo, and Michael.  Failed miserably. At least at the end of film I, we understand the accension of Michael to his father's throne. With Garcia, we neither know nor care. His is the resolving plot device to make this the transfer and continuation of the Corleone dynasty. Very predictable and very ho-hum.

Honestly, the lack of the Hagen/Michael resolution has made this entire story one of mediocrity and graphic violence. We simply do not know or care enough about these people to bring the franchise to a close. Okay. Michael is devastated that his daughter is killed. He screams and screams and screams and screams. Is that really Michael from I and II? Is THIS truly Michael's inner soul? (The one we didn't see in I and II?) I don't think so. Michael, if true to form, should have simply died on the spot from catharsis, (such is his love and devotion to his family!) As it closes, he actually does this years later as an old man sitting on a chair, companioned by a dog. With no ""family"" around to care.

Conclusion: your entire life was a waste, Michael Corleone. You get zero redemption at any point because. . .  because. . . (because Paramount didn't want to pay Bobby Duval what they were paying Al Pacino!) That's about it. After the end of I, we were amazed by the reversal of fortune for Michael. After II, we were in wonderment about the toll taken by the surrounding events. After III? We simply don't care.

A very poor resolution to a monumental film franchise. One hardly recognizes the power and majesty ensconced in the earlier films. Almost like a boffo take-off on the original. Something HBO would do as a ""project.""

3438330,4,B0019L21H4,"This is the only Godfather film that I haven't seen over a hundred times, which is telling.  In many respects, it fits very well with the series.  Most of the acting and casting is spot-on, the acting strong, and the overall tone, continuing with the melancholic nature of 2.  And there is a strong continuity with the music, which has been such a major part of the trilogy.  I particularly like Andy Garcia -- if anything, he should have played a more major part.  He is believable as Sonny Corleone's illegimate son.  And it's nice to see many of the original players, acting as strong as ever -- some with a much more prominent role (esp. Shire).

The movie unfortunately suffers from weaknesses that were not present in either 1 or 2.  I won't get into the miscasting of Sofia Coppola -- the critics have said enough.  I can just say that I cringe whenever she's on the screen.  Also, the story is often disjointed -- and while some have said the same about 2 (switching between the story of Michael and the young Vito), the story is occasionally hard to follow here, and continuity is not as smooth.

I suppose my biggest problem with the movie is with Michael.  This has nothing really to do with Pacino, whose acting is flawless and intense.  It has more to do wtih the character of Michael.  He seems completely different from either 1 or 2.  Previously, he was cold, calculating, full of reason and lacking in emotion; here, he is completely the opposite -- compassionate, regretful, full of sadness, pitiful, even weak in spirit.  Even his tone of voice is different -- often calm but with a playful nature.

I understand that Coppola wanted to manifest a change in the character, but what I think is missing is what happened between 2 and 3 to cause this growth/change/evolution.  Yes, at the end of part 2, Michael had committed the ultimate despicable act, and we can guess from the parting shots of his face that he was troubled, full of regret, wondering where he went wrong.  Here, he has made the transition almost completely from righteous Don to regretful old man.  I wish there had been more back story here.

In any case, there are some very memorable scenes here, mostly involving Garcia and Pacino, and there was so much potential here to end the trilogy on a very strong, powerful note.  As it is, I too, like Michael, am left feeling a sadness -- that greatness was lost here somewhere.  Not that it is a bad movie -- but it should have been better.",1296172800,2,2474,4.547511312217194

3438333,3,B0019L21H4,"OK we've all read the reviews and we've all got an opinion on this one. The Godfather III is so close to good and bad that it can go either way. Coppola should be commended for putting together a film with all the original characters and the same look as the first two flawless films. Coppola should have paid Duvall whatever he wanted to be in the film as he is sorely missed here. Coppola's daughter while not great in this film isn't the actor who bothered me the most. I found Pacino to run hot and cold here, in some scenes he is very good(his confession for his past sins)and in others I found him to be a completely different character(giving the fatherly advise to Vincent and yelling a lot). I also found Andy Garcia to be a bit fake although he did add life to a very slow and boring film. This was probably due to Coppola not giving him enough to do.

Some good points are the wedding with it's watered down version of the original's wedding scene, which sadly is the case in real life. I am Italian American and I remember those weddings with the old timers singing and entertaining everyone. It was a grand time with Nana and Pop Pop at the microphone and in this film when we see Connie trying to revive the old time fun again, it reminded me of a sad reality of these events nowadays. I also liked that Michael couldn't bare what he had done to his brother Fredo, but Pacino is like a raving madman in this film, what happened to cold and quite Michael? It just doesn't add up for me and I found his performance distracting at times.

Connie(Shire)is at her best here, I think she could have been a scarier Don than Pacino in the film! I also thought Diane Keaton was very good and true to her character. The plot is interesting, but it seems to take a long time getting where it wants to go and that is something I never felt about the first two films. In the first two films I wanted them to go on and on and with this one I just couldn't wait for it to end! ....Too bad, it's not a total loss, but it sure ain't what it ""shoulda""  ""woulda"" ""coulda ""been.

The new Blu Ray looks very good and looks obviously cleaner than the first two films. Coppola kept the tinting the same for this film, so they all look very much alike and I hope some day(soon)they will release the director's cut with all three films woven together as one. It's the best version IMHO and it deserves a DVD and Blu Ray release.",1276041600,,2417,4.236442516268981
3438334,5,B0019L21H4,"All three parts of The Godfather series are excellent (and long!) classics, each with its own distinctive feel, and I think Part III is a worthy and fitting closure to the series.  This movie has the emotional intensity of an Italian opera from start to finish, and the ending delivers heartbreak on par with a Greek tragedy.  As one would expect, the composition and execution of the movie are excellent, and others have already commented on the relevant details, so let me instead focus on some of the messages of the movie:

1. You can become very wealthy as a criminal if you're smart, motivated, disciplined, have the support of an organization, and are reasonably lucky.

2. By getting involved in crime, you endanger your loved ones, not just yourself, and you may wind up paying the ultimate price.

3. Money and power have limited value if they come at the expense of relationships with loved ones.

4. When a lot of money is at stake, beware of corruption, including in religious organizations.

5. Once someone gets deeply involved in crime, it's very difficult to escape from that world, since ties with other criminals will tend to pull one back in.

6. There's no honor among theives.

7. If you've reached the point where your situation is good, quit while you're ahead, rather than being tempted to risk what you have for the sake of insatiable greed and/or ambition.

I certainly highly recommend this movie, but be sure to watch the three parts in sequence.",1272067200,,1475,4.749019607843137

AL Pacino Is back as Michael Corleone,and is great once again,but Andy Garcia is outstanding as Vincent,as is Sofia Coppola as Mary Corleone.it was made sixteen years after part two,so it probably wasn't originally intended as part of the series,(which is probably why many purists don't like it)but i'm glad it was made .i think it's a fitting end to the saga.for the purists that won't watch on principle,it's their loss.for me,The Godfather: Part III is a 5/5",1271030400,2,719,4.853658536585366
3438336,1,B0019L21H4,"I am sorry, but I just have to say it:  Sophia Coppola cast as Michael's daughter Mary ruined this movie for myself and many others.  This was a nice juicy role that should have gone to someone who could act.  I cringed every time she opened her mouth to say her monotone, emotionless lines.  I feel so sorry for the actors that had to play opposite her.  She looked so uncomfortable on screen, that it distracted myself and everyone I know who has watched it.  -  If however you can ingore her, you may be able to enjoy the rest of the film, seeing actors from the first and second Godfather movies taking up their old familiar roles.  -  The casting of Sophia Coppola in this role makes me wish so much that this movie could be re-made with someone else in the role of Mary Corleone.  Had Sophia not been cast in this role, I really feel that the movie would have been a great success.  I waited for years with baited breath, just as the rest of the world did, for this movie to come out and how disappointed we were.  What a shame!",1268092800,4,1034,4.219387755102041

Giving it three stars causes me no heartburn because it was just okay, and then it doesn't get much better. It was a four-or five-star movie like the other two, but it held my interest and Pacino's acting was superb next to the embarrassingly bad performance put in by his daughter, who was the worst actor in Hollywood up until Ben Affleck! But when he told her she'd never work in Hollywood again, he meant it. People kept on hiring Affleck, so I hope they enjoy his movies. I'm not, because after DAREDEVIL, I won't watch any more. (Wait, I take that back. I saw the one where he played that CIA guy who got those people back from Iran. Not a great movie, but not bad. Would have been better with someone else.)

The thing I liked most about GODFATHER III is the music and the murder of the Pope, which I believed happened with John Paul I. And they didn't use a fake name to beat around the bush. After seeing this film, I'm doing the music from it for days...everywhere--in the shower, on the computer. Fortunately, I'm as good a singer as Ben Affleck is an actor, so I haven't been asked to do a CD...don't ask.

Getting back to Coppola's daughter, to see her choking to get her lines out make me feel bad for her. Then to see that gut-wrenching scene at the end in what must have been Pacino's most heartfelt effort must have been a bit embarrassing following Sophie's lackluster, ""Dad?"" (I know what people look like and what they don't when they've been shot point blank with a Browning Hi-Power, and they don't look down as blood slowly spreads across their chest and say, ""Dad?"") ""Ummm, yes dear."" ""I don't know, but think I may have been...what's the word?"" ""Shot?"" ""Yes, that. Shot."" ""Flesh wound?"" ""Afraid not. It looks rather more serious."" ""Really?"" ""Yes. Somewhat"" ""Frightful luck, that."" ""I suppose."" ""Band-Aid?"" ""No, coroner, I think.""

Then Pacino gives his mournful and blood curtling performance...like DeNiro when they told him Trump won. It just proved that you should have left well enough alone. Forget the helicopter hit scene at the beginning of the film. When the old guy goes after Joey I know two things. Something's going to go down and 2, the old guy's a part of it. But I loved the old guy. They just abused the Sicilian adage, ""I gotta stone in my-a shoe,"" It was cool when Joey used it, but after that it's not so-a great!

Will look forward to GODFATHER IV. But Hollywood ought to adopt a rule. After two great movies, trade off with another director who has two great movies. Like Coppola does two GODFATHER movies and then George Lucas does the third. And then the third STAR WARS movie can be done by Coppola. It would work. And what do they have to lose?",1518825600,,2732,4.488933601609658
8274339,4,B0019L21H4,"RELEASED IN 1990 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, ""The Godfather: Part III"" stars Al Pacino as aging Mafia don Michael Corleone in 1979, who seeks to legitimize his work in New York and Italy and avow for his sins. He mentors his bastard nephew, Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), while trying to steer his teenage daughter, Mary, away from him (Sofia Coppola).

MAIN CAST: Diane Keaton returns as Michaels ex-wife, Kay, while Talia Shire reprises the role of sister, Connie. Franc D'Ambrosio is on hand as Michaels son, Antonio, who wants to leave law school and become an opera singer. George Hamilton co-stars as B.J. Harrison, essentially taking the place of Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) as Michael's chief financial advisor and attorney. Eli Wallach plays an aged don and Joe Mantegna the gangster Michael put in charge of Little Italy after semi-retiring. Raf Vallone plays a dubious Cardinal and Bridget Fonda a fornicating reporter in a small role.

Part III is on par with Part II in tone and quality, but I give this one the edge in overall entertainment value. Michael (Pacino) has much more human dimension here as opposed to his one-note grim depiction in Part II. His scenes confessing his sins to a priest in a Vatican City garden and, later, with Kay in Sicily are good examples.  There are several other highlights amidst the drama, like the break-in scene at Vincents abode, the Atlantic City massacre, the street festival hit, the entire closing opera sequence that juxtaposes the performances of the play with various violent attacks and the aftermath.

Andy Garcia brings fresh blood and vitality to the trilogy in a pretty significant role, as does Sofia in a relatively small part. Winona Ryder was originally cast for the part, but she was too sick to perform and so Francis chose his daughter at the last minute and shes fine in the role. Does anyone seriously think Winona Ryder would have taken this peripheral part and done it any better? I heard all the ridiculous criticism over Sofias performance before viewing the film and therefore kept waiting for a serious train wreck, but it never happened. She did a fine job for a side character who's an unseasoned, slightly self-conscious (i.e. wooden), flirty teen. To those sheeple who have joined the idiotic critical feeding frenzy: Shut the fudge up and get a life!

The moral of the story rings loud and clear: Choosing the life of organized crime will result in a grim life of constant heartache and premature death all around you. Needless to say, Lifes hard enough without taking that foolish route.

Bottom line: This is a worthwhile crime drama with several highlights, but it doesnt rank up there with the first movie, which stands alone. If you're a fan of the first two films its almost mandatory that you watch this one. It lacks the thrilling greatness of the first film, but its about equal to the second, although I favor this one a little.

THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 42 minutes (or 2 hours 50 minutes, the longer version) and was shot in Sicily and numerous places on mainland Italy, including Vatican City; the New York City area; Atlantic City, NJ; and Lake Tahoe, California. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo.
