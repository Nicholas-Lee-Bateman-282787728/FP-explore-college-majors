3916634,4,B002EAYDLG,"Tracey is great as always. Ruth Gordon wrote the screenplay, and it's obviously and interestingly autobiographical. I recommend the picture. Enjoy!",1394582400,2,147,6.0476190476190474
3916635,3,B002EAYDLG,"Let me preface what I'm about to write by declaring that I consider 'The Philadelphia Story' (Warner Bros., 1940; 5 stars) to be one of the finest American films ever made in any genre.  It also stands as the high-water mark in iconic director George Cukor's long and celebrated career.  With legendary titles like 'Dinner at Eight,' 'Little Women,' 'David Copperfield,' 'Holiday,' 'Gaslight,' 'Born Yesterday,' 'A Star Is Born' and 'My Fair Lady' to his credit, you would think the man was infallibly brilliant, but for every substantive work he produced, there were one or two Hollywood confections, and increasingly so post-1950 (take as evidence 'Her Cardboard Lover,' 'Pat and Mike,' 'The Marrying Kind,' 'Heller in Pink Tights,' 'Let's Make Love,' etc.).  Now to 1953's 'The Actress,' a glossy, sing-songy Warner comedy based on the semiautobiographical Ruth Gordon play about a teenager aspiring to the Great White Way sometime after the turn of the 20th century: while I could spend 90 minutes watching Spencer Tracy darn a sock, being asked to spend equal time watching 24-year-old Jean Simmons preen and pout around-- dressed something like a 5-year-old Shirley Temple-- as a severely shrill, immature 17-year-old is something else.  My nerves simply couldn't take it, and in the end I have to designate 'The Actress' one of Cukor's lesser efforts.  Even as such, I'm giving it 3-plus stars, primarily for Tracy's soothing presence.  Warner Archives' bare-bones DVD-R offers a very clean b&w print and a theatrical trailer.",1388016000,6,1533,5.211382113821138
3916636,4,B002EAYDLG,"I just love Spencer Tracy.  He was certainly one of the best actors of his generation (possibly the best) and his career is no joke; he was fantastic in nearly everything.  `The Actress' is no exception.  In fact, this may be one of his finest moments.  He is heartfelt and paternal, with an obvious lean towards controlling and authoritative, but he is surprisingly light and funny.  All of those assets culminate in a charming and completely mesmerizing star turn that etches yet another notch on his glorious belt of big screen accomplishments.  Tracy aside, `The Actress' is certainly admirable.  It isn't as profound or as outstanding as a whole as it is in parts, but it is engaging and entertaining and contains a few stellar performances outside of Tracy's; in particular Jean Simmons.  She really captures the spunk and tenacity needed to sell her character; a young a vivacious `child' who is endeared to the stage and consumed with a lust for the limelight.  Simmons really pulls this off without a hitch.  The film stumbles a little in its inclusion of the clich&eacute;d love story, but Perkins' screen debut is worth it (I really wish that his career were regarded as more than a single performance, because he really was a true talent).  At the end of the day, this film lives and breathes with two stunning lead turns, but it is more than that.  It is a nicely constructed tale of ones love for their craft (written by Ruth Gordon as a semi-autobiographical account of her own beginnings) but it is also a beautifully rendered account of one man's love for his daughter and the steps he must make in order to show that said love.",1313452800,2,1645,4.693379790940766
3916637,5,B002EAYDLG,"The movie based on Ruth Gordon's girlhood and yearning to become an actress is exquisitely realized by Jean Simmons' beautiful performance. The great Spencer Tracy plays her crusty father and the underrated Teresa Wright, her mother. Anthony Perkins in a very early role, provides the handsome but lanky love interest. The semi comic-tragic determination to realize her dream, is the core of the movie with father Tracy, an ex-seaman vehemently opposing daughter Simmons at every turn.

This is not a movie that will raise the roof through action or suspense, but rather a very fine character study. Audiences enraptured by the recently deceased Ms. Simmons were mainly enthralled with her stunning beauty, overlooking her remarkable talent as one of our finest actresses. No matter how poor the material she worked with, she managed to rise above the most trite scripts and inadequate characterizations with ease, turning a poor movie into a personal triumph.

First time on DVD, this beautifully scripted/directed black and white flick is a must see for classic movie goers and lovers of fine acting. It's all here complete with crackling chemistry between the two leads. The young Simmons was in real life, married to much older fellow actor, Stewart Granger the first of her two husbands. Granger had a daughter close to Miss Simmons' age.

""The Actress"" is part of Warner's fabulous ""Archives"" collection featuring many great movies on DVD for the first time. The majority of our greatest actors have sadly parted, and movie lovers will never find equals that will fit the bill. An original can never be replaced, only mimicked. The disc is a bit pricey, but film aficionados will will find this a most welcome addition to their movie collection. Hollywood does not make great movies like ""The Actress' anymore nor produce tremendous talents like Tracy and Simmons, which is all the more reason for purchasing this DVD.",1276646400,14,1924,5.101587301587301

8367355,1,B002EAYDLG,"Boring as hell. All the positive reviews in here are for some Spencer Tracy movie. My review is for the film, Actress, which drained my soul of all life. If you're into slow docs about following someone around with a camera as they literally do nothing, this is for you.",1516752000,,270,4.42
8367356,4,B002EAYDLG,"Anthony Perkins gives a good performance. This movie was his first movie. In 1913 Boston, teenager Ruth Gordon Jones (Jean Simmons) wants nothing more than to be a famous actress. Her father, Clinton (Spencer Tracy), who recently lost his job as a sailor and became a factory worker, however expresses his desire that Ruth train to be a teacher. Between managing a blossoming romance with a Harvard student (Anthony Perkins) and trying to get a foothold in the theatrical world, Ruth must convince her family to support her dreams.",1514332800,,531,4.977528089887641

8367359,5,B002EAYDLG,"Everyone who has reviewed this film so far has completely missed the point. This film is about the blurry line between ""performance"" and ""authenticity,"" and also a contemporary update of the domestic melodrama of the unfulfilled woman (see Douglas Sirk, etc.). It's a fascinating documentary/melodrama hybrid. If you're interested in either of these two genres, you should definitely watch this movie.",1444694400,5,401,5.590163934426229

8367361,2,B002EAYDLG,"Affirming the other reviews here of Robert Greene's subject-challenged documentary 'Actress' (2014), a cringingly voyeuristic snapshot of out-of-work actress Brandy Burre's inability to handle the simplest challenges constituent to a normal life: view only if you're the type of person who would attend voluntarily what was guaranteed to be a dull cocktail party, seek out the most self-pitying person in the room and plunk yourself down on a nearby ottoman (for she would need the entire settee she was occupying to act out the particulars of her artistic/existential malaise) to listen to her rattle on about herself in painful detail... for an hour and a half... while more or less sober.  The main service this little slice of 'reality' provides is to confirm the stereotype that actors of our time are indeed the superficial, morally blank twits we've always assumed them to be, at least when they think the cameras are rolling (which I suspect is all the time).  In the words of one of Ms. Burre's colleagues/enablers when discussing one of the many impediments to her professional (I won't be mean and add 'personal') fulfillment-- her children-- 'It's okay to be selfish' ...she's an actress!  Two stars for the film's unintended* instructional value.

* While it's possible that it was Mr. Greene's intention to facilitate Ms. Burre exploiting of herself and her family as a sort of sociological cautionary tale, I still would give the thing 2 stars for its insipidness.",1431388800,6,1479,5.099173553719008
8367362,2,B002EAYDLG,"I agree with the former reviewer. Perhaps there are unexplored depths that the filmmaker chose to ignore, but Barre came across as an unworthy subject. When she wasn't insufferable and self- involved, she was merely dull. It was a banal portrait.  Motherhood is indeed fraught with all sorts of existential, fraught terrain that would potentially have been really interesting stuff, especially juxtaposed with a working actress and her particular tensions surrounding pausing her career. I was poised to love the film but ended up irritated.",1429228800,4,541,5.364705882352941
8367363,4,B002EAYDLG,"The actress is a very strong film which looks at the early adulthood of an aspiring actress...Simmons is very good as usual and Tracy is Tracy...set in Boston, is based on bio of Ruth Gordon...Tracy as the father is a retired sea captain and things life the telephone and electric light are new...light and delightful in the watching...overlooked Tracy and Simmons film...highly recommend!",1408579200,2,389,5.190476190476191
