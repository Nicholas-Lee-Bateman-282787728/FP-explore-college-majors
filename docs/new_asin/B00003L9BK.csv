7919058,2,B00003L9BK,"I am looking for an overview series to introduce high school students to the century, decade-by-decade, as the text book does.  This video could serve the purpose although I would prefer a bit less time spent on Bonnie and Clyde or Neville Chamberlain and some of the other longer footages as noted in the first reveiw and a bit more on living conditions, cause and effect.  Not that Mr Chamberlain or the gunners of the 30's whern't important aspects of life in that time - the footage, and time, was wasted to some degree by less-than succinct monologue.
I am especially concerned with the Bismark error.  Selection of material always reflects a bias of some sort but gross historical errors in a finished documentary are inexcusable.  Since this is part of a series and this is the only one of the series I have access to before I spend school money on the series, this error forces me to keep searching.",1079568000,4,907,4.614906832298137
7919059,1,B00003L9BK,"This video on the 1930s, part of a 10 part series, has got to be the most outrageously inaccurate and biased film I have ever viewed, with the possible exception of Leni Reifenstahl's Nazi propaganda masterpiece, Triumph Of The Will.

For it too is not history but propaganda of the worst sort.

For example, it makes the nonsensical claim that at the time Adolf Hitler became Chancellor in January of 1933, the ""President"" of the German Republic was Otto von Bismarck (who died in 1898), and NOT the aging WWI military figure Paul von Hindenburg. It even shows an old still of Bismarck while this narration precedes.

The primary focus however, is upon the Great Depression and the New Deal of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It is here the video is at its worst, presenting as fact the most blatant partisan account of FDR's administration, his Republican predecessors, and the various New Deal agencies.

This section of the video, highlighted by ""commentary"" by Howard Zinn, goes beyond the most remote objective scholarship of the period, into sheer agit-prop of the Stalinist ""Popular Front,"" lauding the social consciousness of the CPUSA, celebrating domestic Communist heroes John Steinbeck, Paul Robeson, Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and the Scottsboro Boys, and the Party's efforts to organize the American proletariat under labor's C.I.O.

The balance of the video concentrates on the rise of European fascism, focusing upon Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco.

Stalin is mentioned only in passing, as a confused victim of Hitler's duplicity and manipulation, and as a supporter of the Republican Loyalists in Spain against the above mentioned fascist trio.

No Soviet Gulag, no extermination of Kulaks, no millions systematically starved to death in engineered famines, or murdered as class or political enemies. No Hitler-Stalin Pact, the final culmination of a decade of deadly covert machinations of the Nazis and the Soviets.
