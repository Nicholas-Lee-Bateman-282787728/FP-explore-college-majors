7916168,5,B00002NDSV,"I'd been wanting to see this for some time, and now thanks to certain internet cinematic ""storage facilities"" I got the chance. I can't really sum up my thoughts about the film past this; Godard has made more than a handful of brilliant films but I don't think he's ever made one as beautiful as this one. Bravo, you old Frenchie.",1261440000,,330,4.426229508196721
7916169,5,B00002NDSV,"Godard is a kind of philosopher. Instead of using arguments he composes nonlinear narratives; thus he is a kind of structuralist philosopher whose main concerns are signs and its effects. But he does not choose treatise or aphorism in order to convey his views. He is a filmmaker, and one of the most intelligent directors alive. Images (faces, books, paintings, snow, woods and ocean) overlapped by words and music is his art, his ""exception against the rule"". (For instance, check how he blends Parts or Darling music with texts or book's title written by Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and Cioran).
  JLG/JLG is a self-portray. But is there a subject Godard? What is the relation between identity and language? The whole film is a patchwork of those rhetorical and vital obsessions; and it is a very good one.",1004054400,6,806,4.962962962962963
