2154447,5,B000305ZW0,"Well-done film. It brought out some of the realities regarding same-sex relationships in the Muslim world. It also displayed cultural habits between men who are friends, some of which would be considered gay in western societies (such as hand-holding) but mainstream in the Muslim societies. Very informative and entertaining!",1466640000,,326,5.673469387755102
2154448,5,B000305ZW0,"This movie deserves to be watched in conjunction with the autobiographical movie ""Salvation Army.""  Both movies deal with a very difficult topic; homosexuality within the Muslim community. Underlying the center of the movie is the same sex relationships that exist within many Muslim communities before heterosexual marriage. While many men make the transition with ease, there are some who find the transition difficult. The demands of predominately Muslim countries that men get married and p procreate is  one that is similar to the expectations of western society up until the middle of the last century. This movie is much like a documentary, but it pulls you in because of the true sense of being a witness to the transition from movie viewer to friends with the characters.",1464393600,,780,5.133858267716535
2154449,5,B000305ZW0,This film was done incredibly well. Its a story of a young middle-eastern man facing the difficulty of coming out in Paris within his community. The story is tastefully told with great care and respect. It is a beautiful love story.,1464134400,,232,4.682926829268292

2154457,5,B000305ZW0,"it is a nice entertaining film.  Touching... It seems as low budget or simply  artistic to illustrate the works of a student in search of gay Arabs.

Well acted. I believed that the characters were real, as in a reality show. The photography gives a retro looks. It illustrates the topic, showing a little of the life of mid 20's Arab gays. The story line develops nicely; nothing is obvious. It keeps one engaged. Well done independent (?) film.

Male nudity is minimal. Home-erotism is well managed.

Recommended.",1446940800,,515,4.806818181818182
2154458,4,B000305ZW0,"Courageous movie because male homosexuality in Africa and Arab-Muslim countries (case for Morocco where this movie was shot by a Moroccan team) this is a highly controversial subject and in some of these countries, even dangerous with a serious risk of legal sanctions while confronted by State and Church promoted homophobia.
So this movie is important because the team is Moroccan and the script confronts the issue straight out.  I know movie goers don't like being bothered by social issues. But this movie could trigger some interest to know more about it (Internet remains excellent for that).",1446768000,,599,5.175257731958763

2154460,4,B000305ZW0,"The story was quite nice and sensual, but the acting was sometimes good and sometimes not so good.  Overall, it was interesting to see the difficulties of Muslim gay lives, but also the difficulties of merging hetero life styles into gay life styles.  One Muslim young man has a Muslim girlfriend, but he has a school project that is to film the history and difficulties of Muslim gay life.  In his project, he comes across a Muslim guy who flirts with him during filming.  At first it was a simple friendship in order to gain access to more members of the Muslim gay community as it is not an easy task with homosexuality hidden away in the Muslim community.  However, this friendship flourished into trust and other feelings that the film producer doesn't quite know what it all means, especially being that he has always lived a heterosexual life style with his girlfriend.  Can he be gay for enjoying his time with a gay friend?  Or is it just a phase for the moment?  Is he in love with this man?  Can he see himself with this man for the long term?  Is this man interested in him only for the moment because what would he be giving up for this person such as his girlfriend.  Is his girlfriend worth giving up only to be with this man who knows for how long?  Many questions to ask and much difficulties to answer.  See what he decides in The Road To Love.",1445472000,,1362,4.378486055776892
2154461,2,B000305ZW0,The protagonist is handsome in a feminine way (especially when he dances). It might have worked better for me to have a more masculine actor playing someone who really is just realizing he likes guys as he goes through his research (his topic is presumed to be a subliminal choice).,1444867200,,282,4.66

2154471,3,B000305ZW0,"Interesting film about a supposedly straight student making a film about the experiences of gay men in the Muslim communities of North Africa.  Along the way he develops a close relationship with one of his subjects.  The interesting thing about ""The Road to Love"" is that it is not the resulting documentary, but rather a documentary about the student making the documentary.

Shot directly to video, the production values are very low. The photography is grainy, the sound is muddy, the editing choppy.  The acting is often amateurish.  There are two possible explanations for these flaws.  (1) This could be the result of a shoestring budget, or (2) it could be a deliberate attempt at cinema verite, or quite possibly both.  I prefer to give the director the benefit of the doubt and view it as cinema verite.  Cinema verite can be quite annoying at times, as this picture sometimes is.

There are some funny moments as the student tries to find suitable subjects for his project and encounters some oddballs who have ideas of their own.

Although only 70 minutes long, the movie drags in spots and is at times repetitious.  As a short film it would have been much more effective.",1315008000,,1184,4.783251231527093
2154472,5,B000305ZW0,"I don't think there are any more explanation as to why other countries abhor homosexuality to the core. While both men, Farid and Karim are obviously handsome and innocent, they share the story of daily battle with being not only muslims but gay as well in country like Algeria. I love the film, gave it 5 star and recommend it to anyone that is into foreign films like this one.",1284163200,,379,4.428571428571429
2154473,3,B000305ZW0,Worthwhile but nothng much new to see here. Conflicted young men coming of age. A nice rainy afternoon of viewing perhaps. But don't cancel a date for this one.,1279584000,,160,4.551724137931035
2154474,4,B000305ZW0,"Director Remi Lange's ""The Road to Love"" offers a rare glimpse for Westerners into the world of same sex relations for Arab men. Karim (Karim Tarek), is ostensibly a straight French-Algerian student living in Paris-- his girl frield is Sihem (Sihem Benamoune)-- who decides to do a study on gay Muslims for a sociology class. He meets Farid (Farid Tali), an out flight attendant who agrees to be filmed by Karim for his class project. Along the way to love, Karim has to face his own feelings for the handsome Farid.

Although the film was obviously made on a shoe-string, it has its moments and is far better than so many of the gay films coming out of Europe. The nudity and eroticism feel natural. Several deleted scenes ae included on the DVD as well as a scary interview with a young man on the subject of gay life in Algeria.",1211500800,,831,4.503311258278146
2154475,5,B000305ZW0,"The previous reviewer who found the movie not worth the time & money, etc., must have a short attention span. The movie is only an hour and 10 minutes! I regularly wait an airports longer than that, and this movie has a lot more subtle punch to it than most hour-long TV shows do. I watched all of the additional features, which were obviously segments of the movie that had to be cut for some reason (financial?)--it certainly couldn't have been that the finished movie was too long for a theater audience!",1171756800,,507,4.521739130434782

2154477,4,B000305ZW0,"ROAD TO LOVE is an obviously very low budget independent French film that introduces the audience to the theme of homosexuality as it is manifested among Islamic/Arab men. Writers R&eacute;mi Lange and Antoine Parlebas have created a script so natural, so sensitively real that at moments the film feels like a documentary (each of the young actors in the story bear their own names, the technique of storytelling is basically video interviews), but the impact of the move is quietly profound, without a trace of the saccharine or the gush of Hollywood films dealing with gay subject matter.

French Algerian Karim (Karim Tarek) is a student in Paris and spends his time with his girlfriend Sihem (Sihem Benamoune).  He happens to view a television program about the gay life in Egypt in the 20th century, a life that allowed gay relationships and even marriages so along as the men gave up the lifestyle when they eventually married women. His interest in the subject results in a sociology project of interviewing gay Arab men to explore contemporary gay lifestyles.  After a few aborted attempts (Karim is not sufficiently comfortable with the subject matter to gain the trust of his interviewees) Karim encounters Farid (Riyad Echahi), a gay, well-adjusted, quietly seductive handsome Algerian lad who not only agrees to be interviewed, but also finds ways to assist Karim with his project.  Chemistry develops and the two depart Paris to visit Marseilles and Morocco and Karim discovers why the subject of choice fascinates him so!

The beauty of this film lies in the honesty in which it is written, directed, acted, and edited. Not only are we allowed to explore a subject matter few of us knew (Islamic homosexuality history and social mores), we are also presented with one of the more tender love stories on film - tender because it is not overt but rather because it is so naturally evolved.  The actors are excellent and though they feel as though they are first time, off the street recruits, they find the core of the script and make the story beautiful.  In French and Arabic with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, March 06",1143504000,,2136,4.913888888888889
2154478,4,B000305ZW0,"2001's ""Tarik El Hob"" (The Road To Love) is billed as a ""Drama"" but views more like a documentary, with the subject being homosexuality among French-Algerians.  Karin is a student living with his girlfriend in Paris, who decides to tackle a sociology video project on that topic, and seeks out those open enough to be interviewed on camera.  One of the early interviewees is Farid, a gay flight attendant, and the chemistry between the two is evident in their first meeting.  Karim rebuffs Farid's good-natured flirtations, but it is clear he is flattered by the attention and somewhat intrigued by the possibility, though he repeatedly states that he is heterosexual and in love with his girlfriend.  Farid's travels allow him to collect additional footage and research for Karim's project, and they get better acquainted in future meetings to review the information he obtained.  Farid comes up with some tough questions for Karim, including why he doesn't see himself ever marrying his girlfriend, and why he chose this particular topic for his project. In time, the two make a journey to Morocco together, supposedly to do more research for the project, but both know it is a ""honeymoon"" of sorts for Karin to think about and reconcile his desires.

Beyond the story above, the film (actually, shot on video, in Paris, Marseille, Amsterdam and Morocco) is an informative and intriguing study of homosexuality among some Islamic cultures, where it was seen as an acceptable activity for young men before they married a woman, and where same-sex marriages actually took place until the mid 20th century.  The story is told well, with attractive, non-stereotypical ""actors"" (Though obviously scripted, one wonders if part of this may be somewhat autobiographical, with the characters having the same names as those who play them.) and commendable techncial quality given the tiny budget.  In French with English subtitles, some male nudity but no explicit sexual activity.  DVD features deleted scenes and expanded versions of some of Karim's interviews.",1100995200,,2055,5.18429003021148

8035546,4,B000305ZW0,This movie is enjoyable to watch and pretty well put together. It plays like a documentary. I think it gives a good sense of the struggle to be a gay man in the Maghreb region of North Africa. The men are delightful to look at and the tension in the one's struggle to come to terms with his own sexual orientation is palpable at times.,1489276800,,335,4.1692307692307695

Unfortunately it seemed the creator lost interest after a certain point because it devolved into a bunch of scenes loosely strung together.  Maybe no one could figure out how to properly write the character's evolution in order to get to the ending.
