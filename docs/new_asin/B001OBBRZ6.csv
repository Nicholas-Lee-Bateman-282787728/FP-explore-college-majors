8330191,4,B001OBBRZ6,"Although the video editing is a bit ""jumpy,"" and the video itself is somewhat grainy, this is nonetheless a great opportunity to see one of Africa's finest musicians (and arguably Zimbabwe's finest musician) perform a live show via DVD.  In contrast to the video quality, the audio quality is not bad at all.  So yes, it does get a one-star demerit for not-so-great video editing, but is still well worth viewing and listening to.  Sure, if there were numerous other Oliver Mtukudzi live-show DVDs out there, others might be worth considering first.  But Oliver Mtukudzi DVDs are few and far between, so if you are at all interested in his truly fine music, this DVD is well worth watching.",1356739200,2,690,4.773109243697479
8330192,1,B001OBBRZ6,"It's difficult to feel mean spirited and snide after listening to Oliver Mtukudizi's music, but I was so frustrated with the editing of this dvd I want to warn others so they do not end up with the same feelings.  Though there seemed to be many cameras on stage to film the show, and at times, they had some great shots of Tuku and his band members, the editing was terrible. Terrible as in either the editor was on speed, impatient, or owed the keyboard player and the drummer some kind of special attention.  During the times when you might have a chance to see Tuku and Eric Kasamba play together, which is always a highlight of the show, you instead get cuts back and forth from over the drummers shoulder to tight shots of the keyboard players hands. Not just one or two, but over and over again.  There are more close up shots of key board playing hands then there are of Tuku.  I counted up to 22 times in one song where close ups of the keyboard players hands occurred when Tuku and his singers were dancing together. Which would you rather see?  If you answered, ""I don't want to purchase this dvd to see Oliver Mtukudzi,"" then this is the dvd for you.  Aside from being a lot more action through editing than a film needs, it was kind of like being at a show and right when you are about to get inspired by what's on stage, the tall guy in front stands up and you can't see a thing.  Too bad.  Oliver Mtukudzi and the Black Spirits are some of the best on the planet and I wanted to have just a little chance to see them in my living room since they aren't touring all that much these days.  And, I got just a little chance, but not worth the money.",1258156800,9,1659,4.1918238993710695
