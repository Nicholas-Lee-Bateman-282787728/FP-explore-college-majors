2770136,5,B000NJMJKM,if your fan of the new turtles thise set is for you it has all the episodes 1-12 one thing that confuses me is 4kids made this set how come it only has 12 episodes in the set and fast forward season 1 set has all 13 episodes maybe theyll be more episodes add to teh future versions of these sets when they get released i was a little dissapointed in that fact fastfaorward has one extra episode and this set only has 12 episodes all togeather. all i can think of is that there is only 22 episodes in season one and more than 22 episoed in season 2 which is why 4kids made it with only 12 episodes for this set i would have perferd more which i know they could have fit a couple more episodes in this set but ill take it anyway. its a must buy if you want to start out your collection in this series and its a great price.,1180224000,,821,3.9221556886227544
2770137,4,B000NJMJKM,"I saw the original series back in the 80s, and like everyone did back then--loved it. I watched the cartoons regularly, and each movie as it came out. The franchise had a good run, but I didn't expect to see it come back. Much to my surprise, in 2003 a brand new cartoon appeared--and the turtles were more serious, the Shredder was actually intimidating, rather than the bumbling villain from the 80s--it didn't take long before I was sucked in. But the DVD releases were lackluster. When everyone else was releasing season sets for $40-$50, you could only buy TMNT episodes 3 to a disc at $15! So I held off on buying them, hoping the company would come to their senses. And now that I was just getting to the point of thinking I would have to go hunt down all the older 3-episode DVDs, they finally wised up! I feel bad for those who already bought the older DVDs, but I'm very glad they are finally being released in this format. It's better for collectors, and more friendly to those who might not have wanted to pay so much for the single discs (like me).

The 2003 cartoon has had great art/animation, and a more serious, exciting tone that has made it alot of fun to watch. If you were a fan of the old show but have never seen this, give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

Since no one else has posted it, here's a list of the episodes that should be on this disc (from an online episode guide-may vary a little):

1- 1 Things Change

1- 2 A Better Mousetrap (1)

1- 3 Attack of the Mousers (2)

1- 4 Meet Casey Jones

1- 5 Nano

1- 6 Darkness on the Edge of Town

1- 7 The Way of Invisibility

1- 8 Fallen Angel

1- 9 Garbageman

1-10 The Shredder Strikes (1)

1-11 The Shredder Strikes (2)

1-12 The Unconvincing Turtle Titan

Overall this should be a great set of solid episodes. I'm definitely pre-ordering this one.",1174694400,50,1832,4.284883720930233
2770138,5,B000NJMJKM,"I at one time collected the volumes, but when the episodes became out of order, I stopped.

This is for anyone who doesn't want 6-8 volumes per season.  This is something Funimation and 4kids should have been doing Since day one.  This is an obvious beginning showing they are releasing all 4 seasons in 2 volumes sets with 2 discs in each volume.  By the time they get to Season 4, it is my hope they will have Season 5 (dubbed ""The Lost Season"" in many respects) Ready to release as a final addition to this collection.

This series outstands the original 1989 series for various reasons.  delving back into the original black and white mirage comics for reference, This series expands in plot, character development and consistency where the 10-year running series merely entertained the idea the turtles were Ninja and barely gave it true form or reference.

While I collect and admire the old series for its longevity and childhood memories, TMNT2003 is one series I watch over and over again.

If you have been Reluctant to collect this series thus far because of the amount of volumes and the price each volume costs, I recommend to buy this and start the Turtles story all over again.",1174262400,12,1192,4.669856459330144
2770139,3,B000NJMJKM,"I have to agree with A. Brown, as I've been collecting the new series ever since it hit DVD several years ago.  NOW, they decide to bring them out the RIGHT way?  Although, I must admit, this will solve the problem of the ""out of order"" episodes , since some were released on ""theme"" DVDs (i.e. ""Mutants & Monsters"").  Assuming, that is, that ALL the seasons are brought out on DVD, one after another. So, I'm torn; while it would be NICE having the episodes all in ORDER (and taking up less space in my collection), it's rather unfair to make me purchase them ALL OVER again because it wasn't done right the FIRST time.",1172966400,5,620,4.373913043478261
2770140,5,B000NJMJKM,"This series is, by far, the best thing that has been done with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles since the original comic book. It easily surpasses the original cartoon and the first three movies in terms of visuals, action, characterization, plot and continuity. Everyone who's ever loved the turtles should own this series. That said, there are probably a good many people who already do, as this has been released before. However, the previous releases for these twelve episodes were three episodes to a DVD for more per DVD than the cost of this set. Not exactly ideal. This set is good for anyone who is just getting into the series and doesn't want to spend very much or for the DVD addict who is running out of room on their shelves. And it's a good way to send a message to the people in charge of such things that customers are still interested in season sets for this cartoon. After all, if they don't see any interest in what came before, they're hardly likely to release anything new.",1172620800,18,991,4.573033707865169

2770173,5,B000NJMJKM,"I've watched every TMNT series and I have to say that this is my favorite. While the newer series on nick is good the darker story lines and characterization of the 03 series is what makes it better. Sadly it started dropping off in later seasons but they still explored awesome ideas and fully introduced the idea of the Turtleverse. The Shredder in this series is the best, bringing a stronger feeling of menace than any other that's been portrayed in animated media.",1461196800,,469,4.662650602409639

2770183,5,B000NJMJKM,"This series was the logical evolution of the turtles for the 2000s. It was darker, edgy, funny but with such better storytelling and deeper story lines. It succeeded on every level and in every way. Great animation that didn't look sloppy after the first season but instead remained strong, clean and sharp and the stories..they are just so well told and by that I mean that they are engaging and interesting and will, most likely, keep you coming back to see how each story line ends with no cheesey or goofy antics to make one feel silly for watching it through. No batman Donatello or Captain Leonardo kirk here. Great story arcs and good character development all along the way. This is a more grown up version to the 80s turtles and I have been hoping they would release it for digital purchase and they finally have. This was a series cut short and should have run a few seasons longer imo.  Worth a watch if you're a fan or not.",1432425600,4,935,4.4678362573099415

2770187,5,B000NJMJKM,"A great series that got a bad treatment by 2 companies. They need to either release the remaining seasons in sets where the episodes are in order, or upload the rest of it to be purchased on digital. There's no point starting on a series you can't finish. It's nice tho that Nickelodeon showed some initiative with the series that wasn't their own by first releasing the Turtles Forever movie, and then trying with this. But there are still 5 more seasons (some very good, some so so, but all worth watching) to be put out there. Seasons 1-3 were all released on multi-volume sets with episodes in random orders, then 1 and 2 were re-released in 2 pt dvd sets. 3 was not. Half of season 4 was released on a set titled ""Season 4."" Seasons 5 and 6 got season sets, 5 being 1 pt, 6 being 2 pts. And last but not least, season 7 did not see a release in the US at all. I for one am glad to have gotten the dvd season sets when sellers didn't jack up the prices. Even tho they aren't complete series-wise, They still cover a lot of ground. Please nick, release the rest of the series in some form or another. This show deserves to get out there so old fans and new of those lovable turtles can enjoy it.",1428105600,7,1198,4.168103448275862

I accidentally bought this DVD thinking it was the 80s turtles, as I wasn't even aware of the 2003 cartoon at the time. I think I paid under ten dollars for it in 2007. Yes, I understand why some old fans don't like the new series, but after awhile it grew on me.",1345680000,,687,4.456
2770203,4,B000NJMJKM,"After the first show that made the Ninja Turtles what they are today, they now get a new show of the new century, but this time it's different from that of the old show.  This time around the show is more story oriented and the action is probably better than that of the original show that started in the late `80s.  While this show borrowed elements of the first movie while at the same time stayed true to the comics, though there's one thing that didn't change and that's the Shredder is still a part of the Turtle universe.  While this set only contains like the first half of the first season, but it's better than trying to do what was done with the other show releasing in volumes for the first three seasons then not releasing Season sets.  This set helps brings the turtles to how they could've been originally, but at the same time helps brings fans in a younger generation.  I give this set a 4 stars out of 5.",1279756800,,921,4.300578034682081
2770204,5,B000NJMJKM,"When TMNT was introduced, I had my doubts but after putting my pride aside and lighten up in places... I gave the series a go.  Very dramatic for an animated series and does serve as a tribute to the original graphic novel by the team of Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird.  The Turtles are about 15 years of age, each one unique in personality and fighting technique. the first meeting of Raphael and Casey Jones is classic, Baxter Stockman... very nasty (not the geek of the first animated series) and Shredder (no shame).  Plenty of action, comedy and great storyline... I give Season 1, Part 1 a 10 (10 fingers).",1243555200,,611,4.536363636363636
2770205,5,B000NJMJKM,"Its about time they released these DVD's the right way! However, its not a good thing for those who spend probablly $40-50 on an entire season or 2.  But anyways when they did release these DVD's they left out the closed captioning/subtitles & they really have no bonus features.  I guess they're tryin to do this the cheap way & sooner or later these dvds won't last for the sheer fact they will release others in its place.

I enjoyed watching the original 1987 series as a kid & i loved it! They had plenty of different episodes to keep everyone entertained & to be honest its a classic!  I saw the movies & they were not bad but they were not the best made movies ever.  I noticed it was pretty unrealistic but for a 90's movie who would expect it to be that way.  Not to mention most of the dialog is pretty embarrassing. I think the original tv cartoon definatly surpasses the movies.

But when i heard they were redoing the series & following it closer to the comics i was pretty shocked of how it came out. I never realized the original series was nothing like the comics.  Many people may not like the new series but i honestly, think its a great improvement.  I still hear that this new series is still not really as close to the comics as it should be, really i wonder if the TMNT comics are really for kids. They did make this new series try to be more kids like & they even have the Fast Foward more for kids then the first 5 seasons.  I wonder if they will put the actual comics onto a dvd set like they did with the Xmen comics.  I would recommend this series for those who are into Xmen or into comics themselves.",1214265600,,1629,4.205787781350482

2770207,5,B000NJMJKM,"This is amazing, how far things have come.  The very first dvd of this show only included 3 episodes.  Now six fit on one disc!

This show won me back to comics in general and TMNT in particular.  From the first episode I saw (which is NOT on this disc, btw) I was hooked, and as soon as I could watch all of the past episodes I did-- and was more and more amazed!  It has the feel of the comics (even adapting some of the old comics stories as well), plus a feel that is more ""grown up"" than the fun-loving toon of the 80s/90s.  All of the voice actors are fantastic, especially- forgive my spelling-- Michael Sinternnclaus as Leo, Sam Regal as Don, John Campbell as Raph, Wayne Grayson as Mikey, and Darren Dunstan as Splinter-- and they play off of each other smoothly.  The family bond is really apparent in all of the episodes, and as I look at my other DVDs from the following seasons, I can see growth and development in the characters.  The action sequences in some of the episodes is awesome!  The fight with Shredder in ""The Shredder Strikes"" parts one and two are wicked (and only surpassed in ""The Shredder Strikes Back"" parts one and two, not on this disc), the humor is not over the top, and you get the feel that these could be real characters-- indeed, a real family.

Like Nano in the one episode, and Leatherhead in later ones, that is the most important thing:  Family.  And I'm glad that this family has come into my life.",1184198400,2,1442,4.319702602230484
2770208,3,B000NJMJKM,"This dvd set collects the first twelve episodes of the current Ninja Turtles animated series, which began back in 2003. The episodes on this set were previously released as individual 3-episode discs by Funi and 4Kids.

While it's not perfect, this is a quality series, and is probably the best thing with 4Kids' name attached to it. The show has a more mature look compared to the 80s series, much more in line with Justice League and today's action shows. Some characters like Baxter and April are closer to the original comics, while others like the Shredder have their origins retooled for a few new surprises. The best part about this new series is the strong continuity from episode to episode. Things that happen in one episode affect the next one, and elements introduced here affect seasons down the line. It's quite enjoyable.

With the first twelve episodes we're introduced to all the main players, filled in on the Turtles' history, and led up to the first major battle with the Shredder. It's all solid, but it's small change compared to what later episodes will pull off. The second volume of season 1 will be much more exciting. Fans who've seen this before or bought the old volumes will find nothing new. No bonus features either, a disappointment. But if you've never seen this series at all, add another star to the rating.

It took Funi long enough to put out these affordable volume sets, but they're worth it. I hope future volumes come at a decent pace.",1183075200,2,1477,4.717054263565892
