1994467,4,B0001EQIBU,"This story of the making of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brady-Bunch/dp/B000MGBSEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brady Bunch</a>&nbsp;is great fun for fans.  It starts with the auditions, then the famous wedding/pilot show (""Tiger!!""), and goes through all five seasons with the kids growing up and becoming stars.

Barry Williams' memoir inspired this 2000 TV-movie, so it's no surprise that his alter-ego is the heartthrob and star of the show; his amorous longings for screen-sister Maureen McCormick play heavily in the script as does Robert Reed's distaste for the low comedy.

Young Barry is played by pre-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/O-C/dp/B000GYI32M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">O.C.</a>&nbsp;Adam Brody who is utterly charming and the only one of the actors who even remotely resembles their famous counterpart.  Williams narrates the story and he and producer Sherwood Schwartz appear briefly.  The movie is all sugar and spice, a sweet and innocent rememberance of a much-loved TV series.  Fans of the show will love it.",1253232000,3,1122,6.598639455782313
1994468,1,B0001EQIBU,"This is a terrible insult to Brady fans everywhere. This just shows what was going on behind the cameras, literally, while they were filming, the kids would be goofing off behind the camera, the little petty fights they had and Barry trying to get laid as often as possibe, just because he was bored.
Then, it just kinds of cuts off and ends with the real Sherwood Schwartz appearing and staggering on screen for a few minutes to tell Barry how great he was a how messed up everyone else was....
Don't waste your time like I did, just enjoy the Brady shows....",1236816000,4,560,4.446601941747573
1994469,5,B0001EQIBU,"I RECENTLY BOUGHT ""GROWING UP BRADY."" I READ THE BOOK YEARS AGO AND IT WAS GREAT. I WAS DISAPPOINTED, THOUGH, BECAUSE THERE WERE NO ""EXTRAS"" ON THE DVD. SINCE I BOUGHT A ""COLLECTION"" THAT IS WHAT I EXPECTED. I WAS SATISFIED WITH THE MOVIE, BUT NOT WITH WHAT I GOT FOR MY MONEY. WHAT DID I EXPECT TO GET: AN INSIGHT INTERVIEW WITH BARRY WILLIAMS, SOME BEHIND THE SCENES FOOTAGE, MAYBE SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF THE OTHER ORIGINAL CAST MEMBERS, WHAT'S BARRY WILLIAMS DOING NOW, WILL THERE EVENTUALLY BE A DVD RELEASE OF ""A VERY BRADY CHRISTMAS"", WILL ""THE BRADYS"", THE SHORT LIVED TV SERIES BE RELEASED ON DVD, HOPEFULLY WITH UNSEEN EPISODES, WILL THERE BE ANY FURTHER ""BRADY BUNCH"" PROJECTS, ETC. ETC. ETC. THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WOULD QUALIFY AS A COLLECTION ITEM. ONCE AGAIN I AM DISAPPOINTED BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND THE FILM.

STILL A DEVOTED FAN,

1994470,5,B0001EQIBU,"I came across this on accident or did I? People who bought this movie also bought....! Anyway I was more a Partridge then a Brady but gave it a whirl. This movie is much better then the TV Show. After watching this I think Sherwood had the camera pointed in the wrong direction! Thanks to Greg Brady for telling the story! I couldn't find it at my local library so I was forced to buy it on Amazon but it was worth it, then was able to resell. Worth the trip!",1210204800,3,459,4.054945054945055

This followed with a new tv series, The Brady Brides (1981).  In 1988, another reunion tv-movie was made,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Very-Brady-Christmas-VHS/dp/6302593093/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Very Brady Christmas [VHS</a>]  It was a success.  They returned in a new tv-movie, The Bradys (1990) which was more dramatic.  This spawned another new tv series, ""The Bradys"" (1990). This series was with the Brady kids as grown adults with children of their own dealt with more important issues including ""Marcia"" becoming an alcoholic.
  Robert Reed was ill with intestinal cancer and had AIDS.  He passed away May 12, 1992.  To pay homage to Robert Reed, the cast returned in 1995 for<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brady-Home-Movies/dp/B00004YA6Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brady Home Movies</a>.
  That same year, someone had the gumption to make&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brady-Bunch-Movie/dp/B00008Z44R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brady Bunch Movie</a>&nbsp;(1995) with a whole new cast.  It was created to spoof the antics of the original Brady Bunch tv series (1969-1973).  Although, some original cast members made cameo appearances, the die hard fans didn't quite take to it.  It didn't stop there.  With another fake cast, they then made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Very-Brady-Sequel/dp/B00008Z459/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Very Brady Sequel</a>&nbsp;(1996) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brady-Bunch-in-the-White-House/dp/B0001EQICE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brady Bunch in the White House</a>&nbsp;These two movies were terrible.  But if any good came out of this, it brought back interest of the original ""Brady Bunch"" cast.
  In February 1993, Barry Williams wrote with Chris Kreski,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Growing-Up-Brady-I-Was-a-Teenage-Greg-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/0967378508/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Growing Up Brady: I Was a Teenage Greg, Special Collector's Edition</a>&nbsp;This book told us of his memories, juicy tidbits, behind-the-scenes battles and many you-never-knew secrets the way only Barry Williams can tell it about the casts time as ""The Brady Bunch"".  Before his death, Robert Reed wrote a Foreword for the book.
  In 2000, the bestselling book became a tv-movie, ""Growing Up Brady.  Barry Williams, Mike Lookinland and Sherwood Schwartz makes appearances.  Mike Lookinland's son, Scott, plays ""Bobby"".
  The original ""Brady Bunch"" cast still pop-up on television once in a while with a new reunion special.  They were last seen together in a reunion special on the TV Land Network in 2004 and on the Travel Channel, ""The Brady Bunch Cast Back in Hawaii (2005).
  It is always nice to see ""The Brady Bunch"" again whenever they return with Florence Henderson and Ann B. Davis too.",1113609600,10,3667,7.5825471698113205
1994474,5,B0001EQIBU,"What a GREAT movie this is.  I read the book (which was good), but didn't come across the movie (which was great), until recently.  It moves along, covers all the important moments, and is extremely well-acted-- particularly by Barry Williams in the opening/closing segments.  He's terrific.  Why isn't he a popular character actor in features??  There's also a clever cameo by Maureen McCormick here-- although I hope they find her hair stylist, who probably skipped town after botching her 'do.  Yecch.  I grew up with this show, and am very happy that Growing Up Brady delivers the goods for all us Brady fans.  Highly recommended.",1089504000,18,634,4.9714285714285715

The cast is great and it captures the feel of the TV show very well. This is a fun TV movie worth a viewing for fans of the show. Need I say more?",1089158400,9,351,4.176470588235294

1994505,5,B0001EQIBU,I watched this on tv when it was first on and loved it. So I was thrilled to find it on DVD. It's the real story of the Bradys and the people who played them as told by Barry Williams (Greg). Alot more was going on behind the scenes than most at the time would think. It's a good movie and for Brady fans it's cool to see what it was like for the kids growing up Brady. I wish the similar movie about the partridge family was on DVD.,1311206400,,433,3.8222222222222224
1994506,1,B0001EQIBU,"I wasn't impressed by this biopic.  It just seemed really clumsy and pointless.  I'm guessing it was a pretty low-budget project and most of it just seems like a half-step above something done by a film school student.  I *love* Barry Williams' book, which has a great narrative and gives some nice blow-by-blow accounts of some tumultuous things that went on behind the camera for five years.  The highlight of Williams' book is the details of the feuding between Sherwood Schwartz and Robert Reed - the film just barely touches on this.  In the lead as Barry, Adam Brody does as well as can be expected.  But there is absolutely zero chemistry between him and the actress who played Maureen McCormick, as opposed to the real-life magnetism between Barry and Maureen that lasted for a while.  Incidentally, the actress who played Maureen was a dog - whereas Maureen (and Christine Taylor, a dead-ringer for her in the BB Movie) was and still is a sizzling hot babe...  A good portion of the film focuses on how the kids got moved into a musical career with their BB stage act, and getting an agent to represent them.  The beginning and ending are extremely corny - with Williams entering the Paramount Studios lot while having conversations with a cabbie and a network exec on the lot about ""if Greg and Marcia ever...did anything"".  If you want the real thing, just read Barry's book instead, it tells the whole story very well - and so vividly that you can almost feel like you were there.  This DVD....don't waste your time or money.",1268611200,5,1537,4.676579925650557
