2518064,5,B000EGDN68,"This is one of my favourite workouts. Kari Anderson manages to be fun, upbeat and encouraging without being annoying and I will definitely look out for more workouts from her.

The workout is intermediate/advanced but she gives modifications where needed and always encourages you to go at your own pace. This 60 workout really goes by really fast. I especially like that she has packed a lot of exercises in with low repetitions so you don't get bored whilst still getting a total body workout. There is a very good 10 minute stretch at the end that I often do at the end of my other workouts. This one's definitely a keeper!",1185753600,12,626,4.589285714285714
2518065,4,B000EGDN68,This dvd is one hour... but you can divide it into three different workouts.  The first workout is one of the best core workouts I have ever done.,1168473600,14,146,4.214285714285714
2518066,5,B000EGDN68,"This is set a a very spacious stage w/modern/minimal simple background. She has 5 women behind her, one an older woman all in average to very good shape. The music is good & fast, usual aerobics synthezier, but doess't bother me at all & I'm picky about music.
The workout is killer, said to be for intermediate to advanced. She doesn't let you cool down between exercises in this entire 60 min session. You need some good muscles for leg lifts, deep squats or holding your body on 1 hand & leg or so.
I don't normally like plain aerobics, but since each of all the exercises have an obvious benefit like stretching, toning/strengthening, balance & most do more then 2 of these or more at once & all done fast-paced with many different movements, you can't not like it. She is also great about body awareness... she knows what feels good, what the body needs next to balance out.

Collagevideo com has a trailer for this & good description:

These routines have the grace of ballet and the intensity of ""hard core"" body sculpting. After a flowing, rhythmic warm-up, you'll move into the dance-inspired standing toning. Examples: a squat becomes a relev&eacute;. Or a pli&eacute; becomes an extended-leg pli&eacute;, which then rotates (so the entire sequence almost seems ""choreographed""). The floor section is also unique - a blend of yoga, Pilates and traditional toning (e.g. a downward dog transitions into a plank; that plank turns into a ""side plank"" and it all evolves into a push-up).",1156118400,35,1492,4.801556420233463
2518077,5,B000EGDN68,"I'm completely biased on my purchase since I purchased this DVD after I moved away from Seattle and missed Kari's classes.  However, the workout is still great and really works the core.  Of course, her actual classes are better.  I did find this as acceptable alternative.",1316476800,,273,4.891304347826087
2518078,5,B000EGDN68,"I love this workout. Lots of different moves, toning that will have your legs burning, fantastic stretching, great abs. Kari is an excellent instructor. I would highly recommend this dvd as a compliment to your other cardio/strength routines. Not great for someone with bad knees. Would be challenging for someone with poor flexibility. I don't think you need to be a trained dancer to do this workout at all, but Prior Pilates knowledge would be an advantage.",1313712000,3,460,4.987012987012987
2518079,4,B000EGDN68,"This is the results I want from Winsor Pilates.  Before pregnancy I litteraly weighed 100 pounds and was tight and toned everywhere so Winsor Pilates seemed to work.  After pregnancy I can't get away from the 140 lb mark.  What I have realized is that Winsor Pilates was helping me maintain my cute girly figure but now that I want to loose weight it isn't helping.  REACH is helping with actual weightloss and reshaping my body.

My exercise type ( as far as videos go) is pilates, ballet, power yoga, etc.  I don't like jumping all over the place, boot camps, kick boxing, etc.  I like to stretch and feel my body reshaping.  I have tried lots of dancing videos like Dancing with the stars, belly dancing, and more but I just don't like them.  I don't feel like I get a great workout because I can't get the moves down.  With REACH, I feel the stretching AND I actually work up a sweat.  I like the instructor.  She looks like her body comes from what she is trying to teach you to do.  I like that the video can be done in 3 different segments.  I can't do the first 2 together. By the time I finish the first one I am ready to stop.  If someone was holding a gun to my head or offering me tons of money to do the entire thing at once I could manage, but without those senerios I don't want to do it.  I am ready to stop after the first half of an hour.

I do have the same complaints though as other reviewers.  There are some exercises that you need to see what she is doing, but you can't look at the tv and her at the same time.  I guess once you really learn it that won't be an issue.  I don't consider this workout fun, but it isn't boring either.  It is motivating for me because I can see how you really can reshape the body and loose weight.  I think it is something that you will really want to rotate into your regime, but I don't think you will really want to do it everyday or you may get bored.  You do feel really good afterwards.  I have even noticed that my posture has improved and that I hold in my abs more.

Great product, will work but only if you really use it, and it won't break your wallet.",1313193600,8,2120,4.075060532687651
2518080,3,B000EGDN68,"Wanted something low impact(not into yoga)to burn a few calories in the morning before work. You have to study the dvd first over and over so you can do some of the moves without having to watch at the same time, i.e. (""with your forhead on the floor..""). How can I see what she is doing if my face is planted in the floor!?  Also, with mostly one camera angle, from the side, when she is lying down, you cannot see if her legs are apart or together and sometimes which leg she is working because she is wearing black leggings.  Furthermore, you have to be at least moderately, not mildly, flexible to follow her.  A little experience in ballet would have helped me too. I'm going to keep trying, maybe I will get better at it.",1311811200,5,727,4.291970802919708
2518081,5,B000EGDN68,"I love this Dvd!!! It's low impact but still challenging and will even make you sweat.  I really enjoyed the combination of ballet, yoga and pilates.  Kari has a great personality and is easy to follow.  I will definitely buy more of her dvds.",1303516800,5,243,4.4772727272727275
2518082,5,B000EGDN68,"I have been dancing for over 20 years, dancing 15+ hours per week when in my prime, and typically find most workout videos (especially those that are dance based) boring. They're either too simple physically, not giving me the amount of stretch or strengthening work I desire, or they're too easy mentally (no challenge in picking up the choreography). Kari Anderson is PERFECT for trained dancers. And she's the only instructor I've found so far that I can say that about. I picked up this dvd after remembering being impressed by her VHS DanceWorks with the Pacific Northwest Ballet company. While this particular dvd doesn't focus as much on cardio or choreography it has great strengthening and stretching exercises and I definitely work up a sweat. They're much more dance based than other instructors' dvds, making the exercises easy to recognize for a dancer. It feels like a good warmup before your typical dance class. So long as you push yourself to your fullest potential I would find it very difficult to believe that even the most experienced dancers do not get something out of this.

In all of my talk about it being a great workout for dancers I hope I do not discourage non-dancers! It is definitely something that advanced beginners or those looking for a challenge could pick up and do. I focused more on dancers here because I know that when I'm searching for new exercise dvds I'm always looking (usually in vain) for reviews from dancers to get their take on it. But one of the best things about Kari Anderson's exercises is that they really are for (pretty much) all levels. The difference is in how far you push yourself (how high your leg goes, how long you hold it up there, how much you resist on the way down, etc.). She is encouraging throughout and I can not recommend this dvd enough for a great, full body workout.",1298851200,18,1846,4.68
2518083,5,B000EGDN68,"I really like this video. I bought it because I was looking for a good conditioner for dancers. This is perfect as it shapes & tones the legs, arms, & stomach in such a non-intrusive way. The instructor is very pleasant, informative and just an all around good teacher. And the ab section is phenomenal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is the reason I gave this dvd 5 stars- She goes through a variety of ab exercises that don't lean to heavy on pilates (so you don't have to have a ton of unnatural neck strength!!!!.

The only thing I didn't like were the planks. I felt they were quite advanced and I wish she had shown some modifications for those who want to build upper arm strength gradually.

Other than that if you're a dancer and you need a good conditioner, this is a really good buy.",1291680000,5,785,4.444444444444445
2518084,3,B000EGDN68,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

Pros: Worked up a moderate sweat.  Some of the moves were pretty tough.  Much better than the other Angles workout from same instructor.  Instructor non-annoying.

Cons: Explanations were good but I would have gladly traded half of them for more of a steady transition-cue and a count (or louder music with beat to follow) since a lot of moves you face down or away from the tv.  Overall, not as tough as I hoped --- could use more repetition of medium-tough moves in place of easier, pretty-filler-balance moves.

I am thinking this would be good for beginners starting to work on their toning and flexibility or intermediate where you don't need to push too hard (a workout, not a challenging workout.)",1289347200,8,760,4.8
2518085,5,B000EGDN68,"this DVD has been my best friend for several years now. I take it with me if I go out of town. It shapes my body into a Barby doll figure, literally. But it took me a while till i was able to finish the whole workout.",1282262400,5,217,3.6382978723404253
2518086,5,B000EGDN68,This is my favorite exercise video.  I love the leader and she really eases you through the workouts.  It's one of those workouts that you don't realize until the next day how many muscle groups you actually used!  I would for sure recommend this video for all levels of intensity!,1276732800,2,281,4.58
2518097,5,B000EGDN68,"This is a really well-organized and well-cued ""fusion"" routine that incorporates elements of dance, yoga, and Pilates into the format. It is indeed true that time flies while doing the exercises because of the great variety of movement involved. I didn't find it as stressful on my low back as power yoga, as the positions are less extreme and the movements flow from one to the next without excessive repetition of any one pose or movement. Kari's degree in communication science definitely shows, as her diction and cuing are spot-on, and she very intelligently conveys the exercises she has put together in a way that is assuring and confident. I agree that this dvd is very ""do-able"", fun, and effective. The sections on standing, floor, and stretching are all well-coordinated. This is definitely one of my favorite dvds with which to work out, from day one. I still mix things up with other dvds (especially those involving dance conditioning), but this one is a perfect blend of calisthenics, light aerobic work, strengthening, balance, sculpting, and core work. I would highly recommend this workout to anyone seeking a comprehensive fusion format in their daily workouts.",1275004800,6,1180,5.087628865979381
2518098,5,B000EGDN68,"Update after a year!  Now Sept 2011.
I'm so proud, I've been sticking with it for a year, still my favorite workout video by far!  (I didn't actually start a regular regimen until last summer 2010.)  Took me about 9 months to be able to basically do most of the video (I still wuss on the pushups ;)

Most impressive because the really challenging parts are still challenging after a year, I used to do it 3x/week, now about twice, so I'm slacking a bit.

Best because its very challenging, but never put me in cramps or felt like a grind, but not eye-candy fluff either, real training, these women are so strong!  (And so am I now! :)  This level is perfect and was hard to find!
..................
After a few weeks doing this, sometimes I just pop it in when I'm in a bad mood.  She's so likeable, her voice so pleasant, and all the work gets your mind off your troubles :)

Still very challenging, I wish I could hear about results if you follow this a few months...

Funny, most of it isn't terribly hard, so you get used to an even pace, then the really hard stuff seems a little easier to do, just part of the routine.

I switch with Elise Gulan's ballet conditioning, and that one is harder, but less enjoyable, because Kari has more variety and movement overall.",1258848000,2,1271,4.343220338983051
2518099,5,B000EGDN68,"Kari Anderson's ""Reach"" is one of my very favorite exercise DVDs. Fitness professionals who are planning to record and market their own routines should take a look at this one, because she gets right what many other instructors don't often pull off. For example: Kari gives consistently clear instructions, provides modifications, and times her moves to the beat of the music. She has a gentle, yet firm, demeanor that is not annoying or overly peppy. Her workout demands practice, but she makes you feel graceful and strong--especially during the standing portion of the DVD (my favorite part). In terms of indoor exercise, I love yoga and tolerate Pilates, but I really love how she's fused the two with ballet. I will be purchasing Angles, Lines, and Curves (another Kari Anderson DVD) soon, and I am also looking forward to trying more ballet-inspired workouts. You can't beat what this routine does for the legs and abs! Definitely a must-have for your collection.",1250985600,5,969,5.024844720496894
2518100,5,B000EGDN68,"This is a wonderful workout. Just recieved it and I am totally happy with my purchase. The exercise is wonderful, as well as the instructor and the entire production of the DVD. Not too choppy with the editing, has a smooth flow and has moderations for beginners, intermediates and advanced. I suggest watching this video once through first before attempting this to get a feel of the flow and the cueing (which is fantastic). Will do wonders for me, i'm sure. Enjoy...",1250899200,3,469,4.7317073170731705
2518101,5,B000EGDN68,"Excellent workout for all over toning, flexibility and balance. This might test the flexibility for some people, but Kari Anderson reminds viewers not to push their bodies beyond limits. There is a segment at the beginning where she clarifies the principles of the workout. This is useful so we know what to bear in mind as we workout with her.
The moves are relatively simple and we can concentrate on getting the moves right. The choreography is interesting, and looks nice. She really knows how to put together an effective and beautiful workout. Many of the moves look easier than  they are, but however are doable, and Kari Anderson explains modifications for different levels for some of the exercises.
There's something very elegant and pleasant about Kari Anderson.
People who like exercises which need to be done with thought and control will like this. I think this would be a pretty good workout for beginners (or near-beginners) to intermediate level. For advanced levels, it might be beneficial to do this workout and test out areas which the regular workouts might have missed - eg runners/ joggers may like to try this to improve balance and control strength.

I tried this out and saw physical changes in less than 3 weeks - slimmer waist, hips, thighs, higher abs definition: -
Three times of REACH (this workout by Kari Anderson)
One time of Athletes Intense Stretch (Miranda Esmonde White)
Two times of Full Body Workout (Miranda Esmonde White)
One time of Sante Fe Stretch
Two times of Total Body Cardio - Slim Sculpt Stretch (GAIAM)

Of the lot, REACH is the most challenging - though not MUCH more challenging, all the workouts are great - and I bought Kari Anderson's Angles Lines and Curves II recently.",1249603200,5,1727,4.86734693877551
2518102,5,B000EGDN68,"Reach is an amazing workout. I am getting addicted to it. It does shape your entire body, it's inspiring, u just feel like a dancer. Despite being tough, Kari is so so pleasant and encouraging! Great, great great! thank you Kari!",1243209600,2,229,4.609756097560975
2518103,4,B000EGDN68,This is a great lower body and ab workout.  Very enjoyable if you have a dance background or if you just like dancing.  It is very challenging.  The only drawback is that it is not a very good upper body workout.  However I Do highly recommend it.,1233964800,4,247,4.191489361702128
2518104,5,B000EGDN68,This is a fantastic workout for balance and strectching. The routine is by no means easy and though there is no cardio I was left sweating at the end of it. The exercises are different from what I am used to so it is fun to do and break the monotony of a exercise regimen. I love Kari's style - her cueing is fantastic and the fact that she is a little out of breath adds to te fun.,1227398400,2,382,3.848101265822785
2518105,5,B000EGDN68,"My title says it all.  To sum it up: this is the workout I reach for if I am totally stressed. I have only done the floorwork once though and mainly bought it for the standing work which is what I am reviewing here. The floorwork is tough, but when I have more time i plan to do it again. i believe it would provide excellent results, I just am not really into floor type exercises of that kind.",1227312000,4,395,4.0
2518106,5,B000EGDN68,"I thought this was a great flexiblity and toning dvd.  I was looking for something low impact, but hard to do and I thought this was great.  I challenged my strenth and it was nice to get away from the weights for a workout.  HIghly recommended if you want something different and a little challenging yet and get a break from a hardcore workout.",1216252800,2,346,4.375

8109360,3,B000EGDN68,"One of my favorite workout DVDs is Kari Anderson's Center Floor.  It is excellent except it has almost no arm work.  Because it is so good, I purchased Reach and the Angles, Line & Curve DVDs.  None of them is even close to as good as Center Floor is.  Reach is ok but kind of boring, too much ""hold"" positions and a lot of moves that are no fun and I can't see the reason for them - they don't appear to be as effective as many other exercises.  You have to stop and watch a lot of the moves because your head is down toward the floor on a lot of them.  Would not recommend.  Moderate sweat - did not feel fully worked out or satisfied after it.",1404086400,3,646,3.9612403100775193

8109362,5,B000EGDN68,This is one of three videos I bought recently to add to my collection to use weekly.  What a great program.  It's stretching but it's also a great core workout.  There are also various options for each move for fitness levels.,1381190400,2,226,4.463414634146342

I have been looking for something that will tone up damaged muscles without causing pain for several months now when I came across Kari. I bought 2 of her DVD's not expecting to be able to cope with them, how wrong was I. They are gentle and difficult all at the same time but without putting any stress on my injuries. I have only tried them a couple of times but will continue and will post results as I see them, which I know I will",1370649600,3,543,4.132075471698113

8109365,5,B000EGDN68,I bought it because I needed some stretching but was disappointed since the stretching part is only 10 min at the end. I give it all the five stars though since I use it when I am not in a mood to do something really strenuous (e.g. KB) It is good for toning and does improve the posture. A bonus: Kari Anderson is flawless in her instructions. I would be buying her videos again. She is very easy and effortless to follow.,1362355200,4,423,4.170731707317073

8109367,5,B000EGDN68,"I already loved Kari's ""Center Floor"", and this workout is becoming another favorite.  Don't think you'll have to do the whole thing; even just the first 30 minutes (the standing segment) is a great workout.  And hard-- in a good way! The moves are so graceful and beautiful that It may not look like you are working hard, but that's an illusion!

If you love ballet/pilates/yoga type workouts, this is one to try.

Kari Anderson's voice is pleasant and peaceful and she knows just when to encourage without being phony. Her professionalism and skill comes through in this video.

The production quality of this video is not as top notch as Center Floor (which came out after this one). Don't let that deter you; this is just personal preference.",1348444800,8,746,4.751937984496124
