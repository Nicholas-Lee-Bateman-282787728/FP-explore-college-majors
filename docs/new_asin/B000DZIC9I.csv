These videos are very advanced and attempt to simplify, as much as possible, complex topics. Of course, my son doesn't grasp these concepts yet and he would prefer to watch his Leap Frog videos, but I play the Squibs videos while he is playing in the room with his toys. Every now and again he will watch the shows for a bit and by things that he has said I know the Squibs videos are a great choice for background noise.... much better than Dora or Little Einsteins anyway.",1204502400,4,628,4.1138211382113825
8103017,2,B000DZIC9I,"I bought this tape for my child as i expected it to focus more on health and nutrition. Nutrition is so important for our kids today that I thought it would have represented a big part of the tape. Unfortunately it barely touched upon the subject.

Apart from that, it was very difficult to grasp for kids; even for adults it isn't easy.

It is informative and expalins the workings of the body in great detail. As far as I am concerned, too detailed and complicated for young viewers.

Lets have one that really explains the effect of nutrition on our physical and mental health please.",1175299200,2,587,4.518867924528302
