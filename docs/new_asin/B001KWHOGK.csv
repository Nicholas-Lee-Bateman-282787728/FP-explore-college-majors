8316357,5,B001KWHOGK,"I grew up watching ""Where Vultures fly"" and ""West of Zanzibar"" over and over on German TV, so I'm delighted to find out that it's finally available on DVD.
BUT where is the prequel ""West of Zanzibar""??? Will it be on DVD soon?

None of the previous reviewers seems to be aware that there was a prequel from 1951, ""West of Zanzibar"" (not to be confused with the 1928 silent movie) also with Anthony Steel playing ranger Bob Payton.",1339632000,,430,4.443037974683544
8316358,5,B001KWHOGK,"When the master of docudrama, Harry Watt of ""Night Mail"" and ""Target for Tonight"" fame, was directing ""Where No Vultures Fly"" (aka ""Ivory Hunters"") in Africa, he had some trouble with the script. Watt knew what to do. He enlisted his old mate, Ralph Smart, the English-born Australian filmmaker, to give him a hand. Ralph, a brilliant storyteller, helped Harry to convert ""The Overlanders"" from a docudrama into a feature film narrative to better appeal to wider general audiences. The fundamental change paid off and ""The Overlanders"" was a hit in Australia and Britain. Ralph similarly helped out Watt with another Ealing production in Australia, ""Eureka Stockade"", even directing some scenes.

So it was that Ralph helped his friend expand ""Where No Vultures Fly"", another Ealing production, into a dramatic film for wider audience appeal, though Watt's distinctive docudrama style remains evident. Two other great English filmmakers contributed to the script, Leslie Norman (who made several films in Australia)and W.P. Lipscomb, who did some Hollywood work and co-wrote another of Ralph Smart's Australian Ealing films, ""Bitter Springs"". In fact, ""Where No Vultures Fly"", while about the setting up of national parks, covers race issues that make it a companion piece to ""Bitter Springs"" which was about the culture clashes during the settlement of Australia's frontier. They make for a good double bill. In fact, the Bowen Writers' Group screened them as a double bill at the Summergarden Theatre (Bowen, North Queensland) as part of a retrospective of Ralph Smart's films in 1995). Ralph Smart attended the screening as did actor Michael Pate who had starred in ""Bitter Springs"" (1950) before his succcessful career in Hollywood.

Harry Watt and Ralph Smart were progressive filmmakers who tackled social issues well ahead of their time and created greater awareness internationally. May more of their films be rediscovered and released on DVD",1330473600,2,1950,5.327922077922078
