8166549,1,B000M5KBLQ,"The dvd I received was defective.  it froze, locked up and flickered.  Poor quality control - will never buy again.  I bought this item to view not to be required to contact the seller, arrange for RMA, repackage and ship and wait for the new item hoping it will be a good copy.  My guess is that another copy will also be defective so I elected to throw it in the trash and not waste anymore time.",1255651200,,398,4.12987012987013
8166550,5,B000M5KBLQ,An informative dvd on the sutka dive bomber..Full of facts and insights on the plane and the men who flew them..,1187827200,,112,4.380952380952381
8166551,4,B000M5KBLQ,Provides a skirting overview to the impact of the Ju87 on the morale of the enemy and the accuracy of the dive bomber vs. the conventional high altitude bomber. Also a refreshing change from other documentaries that are almost propaganda - like for the western allies.,1183680000,,268,4.8478260869565215
8166552,5,B000M5KBLQ,"Omitting the pre-war development of the aircraft carrier and its doctrines, thiw documentary goes straight to the World War II story starting with the Pearl Harbor attack and continuing with the battles of Coral Sea and Midway. There is a selection of the most dramatic scenes of carrier warfare in the Pacific, especially those of the kamikaze attacks against the US fleet and the film ends with 2-3 minutes about the carriers' role in the Korean War. A nice addition to the film collection of every WW II fan.",1171238400,,511,4.752808988764045
