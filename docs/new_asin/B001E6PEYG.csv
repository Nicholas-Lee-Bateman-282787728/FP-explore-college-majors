I do think producer Colby has a very heavy hand in abruptly cutting at 19:26 one of the coolest songs (not just on this dvd but I mean all songs) I've ever heard. I could have done without the cock fight scene. (A fairly blatent copy of the Les Blanc Chenier Video scene where they shoot a hog). But with that said, the band is totally tight and for my money Chenier is on  equal blues footing with Muddy Waters. Personally I prefer him but he holds the trump card because of his brother Cleveland on the rubboard. He had the coolest groove on an instrument he pioneered. Many have played it since but I've never heard anyone that had his style. The combination of those two drove people nuts. This DVD shows Cleveland some but I wish they had focused more. Still the rest of the band is excellent and deserved attention too with Blind John Davis great sax, Buckwheat Zydeco on Keys. Solid drummer, bass and guitar. Fired up crowd was partying with a band that was as good as any I ever saw.",1433721600,2,1124,4.37799043062201
