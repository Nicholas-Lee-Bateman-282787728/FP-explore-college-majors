5743496,4,B00CWHWV7O,"These are two adult films from the 70's that include some bad dubbing and a sound track before the whack-a-da music became popular. In the first feature a woman is shot and raped in that order, although gun shot wounds are costly special effects that needs to be avoided. She is rescued by a group of women who teach our victim kung fu, meditation, and to blow smoke out of her virginia. Unfortunately the film never accomplishes the revenge factor.

The same basic crew is used in the second feature as woman are abducted and/or recruited for the WBA, World Bordello Association. Madam Blue is paid for the women. At this point the film is mostly a continuous stream of sex scenes with little plot.

The only special feature is the scene select called ""reels.""

Sexploitation and sleaze. You've been warned.",1380844800,11,808,4.716312056737588
5743497,3,B00CWHWV7O,"Honestly, I had no idea this was X-Rated when I purchased this. It does not say so anywhere on the packaging or materials on Vinegar Syndrome's website. Yes it does say ""70s Times Square Sleaze"" but I am not old enough to know what that was, I thought it would be a bait and switch type deal.

The Vixens of Kung-Fu is quite avant-garde in the shooting of the ""kung fu"" scenes although you could hardly call them that. The ladies win the bout by sitting on the man's face. I did used to have ""Kung Fu Girls 2"" on DVD and this is much more strange. Rapists bringing their own picnic rug? A Kung Fu master working behind the counter in a greasy spoon?

Oriental Blue is much more sleazy and has the old ""white slave trade"" storyline. I can't really say I found it that erotic, but it is an interesting historical document and a excellent transfer. These films are quite lush in their production and Oriental Blue has a large amount of copyright indeterminate music on the soundtrack.

Fans of the bush will be quite at home here being as it is from the 1970s. Both men and women are quite luxuriant in the downstairs area.

2K scans of film might be a bit unflattering to some of the actors in the nude scenes, but it sure looks bright and clear. Better than you would have gotten from a VHS copy of the same film.

Fans of 70s sex films and exploitation would enjoy this one, not really sure about everyone else unless you have a ""sexy party"" you want a movie to put on in the background.",1377648000,16,1487,4.277580071174377
5743498,4,B00CWHWV7O,"Thanks to the folks at Vinegar Syndrome DVD authoring for dredging up a bunch of old exploitational weirdness and foisting it upon an unsuspecting public. They have released a series of 'double feature' DVDs in their ""Drive-In Collection""- presenting 2 films on a single disk.  This, Asian inspired, offering of ""Vixens of Kung Fu"" and ""Oriental Blue"" is actually the only one of their 2-fer packages that I've watched so far - but if it is any indication of their other products I may well be going back for more!

I was initially intrigued by the write-up for these two flix - speaking as it did of vengeful kung-fu maidens and white slavery in Chinatown - it sounded like a formula for some good bent drama and a little skin to be on display.  What the film synopsis did NOT mention, however, is that both of these movies are fully hard core XXX '70's porn! A closer look at the cast should have given a clue - with the likes of porn legends C.J. Laing & Jamie Gillis prominently featured in both flix - this is more like 42nd Street fare than any drive-in features I was ever privileged to see - back in the day!

""Vixens of Kung Fu"" doubtless was 'inspired' by the martial arts craze that Bruce Lee's films ignited in the 70's and it is un-abashedly satirical in its' premise and execution.  Somewhat in the vein of those 'naked yoga' features that display all the stuff guys wish they could see underneath the Lu Lu Lemon gear - this film's 'vixens' show you what naked kung fu could look like with all that high kicking & such - minus clothing.  The 'plot' is simplistic  and doesn't get in the way of plenty of sex action of various configurations. Some beautiful fall scenery & artful photography (on occasion) provide the minimal outdoor production values throughout. There is really not much actual martial arts action - most of the 'thrusting' is of the carnal variety. A favorite, typically surrealistic, scene featured all the kung fu gurlz doing yoga in the lotus position - channeling their energies downward until smoke starts pouring out of their 'nether regions'!  Generally, this one is brainless, goofy fun!

""Oriental Blue"" is reminiscent of the old B&W 60's 'roughie' ""Olga's - White Slaves of Chinatown"" - with the addition of color and full of XXX scenery (but not as much S/M!). The Chinese Madame (Blue) in its' plot procures girls for wealthy clients by utilizing a mysterious herbal aphrodisiac beverage and the help of a series of pimp-ish studs to seduce and indoctrinate unwitting young women into a life of prostitution.  Once again, itz 'no holes barred' as the viewer is 'treated' to a series of vignettes picturing the aforementioned theme. The tone of this film is generally more 'serious' but there are some clever bits of satire and some pretty decent performances to be appreciated amidst the smut. The music tracks (on both) are eclectically bizarre - SciFi buffs, of a certain age, may note the use of Bernard Herrman's outstanding score for ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" as a, somewhat incongruous, choice for background music in parts of 'Oriental Blue'! In 'Vixens..."" the 'opening' rape sequence  becomes a strange parody of 'Deliverance' with the use of rousing Bluegrass 'dueling banjos' behind the boffing. Even the 'Beatles' get some play time - that I doubt they ever saw any royalties on!

I really enjoyed both of these films for their quirky qualities and unexpected X-factor. You definitely don't want to put this one on the shelf next to the 'Kung Fu Kid' or you might have some 'explaining' to do if your 'kid' pops it in the player by mistake!  Recommended for mindless (adult) viewing pleasure.  Both of these films enjoy exceptionally clear transfers of their wide-screen images! No extras for either film.",1376956800,29,3768,4.768049155145929
5743499,5,B00CWHWV7O,I thought this was some sort of soft porn but it turned out to be more that what I expected. The story lines are bad but the actions are great. So for those who loves those 70's era b movies ... well you will not be disappointing after all.,1413504000,,240,3.9183673469387754

It's only on their perceived merits as a 21st century viewer that I judge... Vixens of Kung Fu is lame on all counts. Yes the women are beautiful and the guy featured is in surprisingly good shape for a porn actor of the day. The action ""action"" is beyond laughable and the sexual ""action"" is short and not sweet. Oriental Blue is racier and the better of the 2 films, but still only justifies a one-time view. A time capsule, yes. A keeper, no.",1396051200,2,564,4.380952380952381

5743506,4,B00CWHWV7O,"These two videos are hardcore films.  Kung Fu is a cult movie.  It started with a gang of 3 men kidnapping a woman.  Two guys raped her on the spot of a deserted grassland.  She was left to die.  However, she was rescued and told to take a revenge on men.  That women gang of cult worshippers caught a passing-by monk.  He was raped by these women this time.  This monk turned to learn
Chinese Kung Fu mastering control of his sexual drive and giving satisfaction to multiple women at a time.  So he later returned to these women.  Group sex and lesbian scenes are here and there.
Oriental Blue is a Chinese Madam movie.  It involves picking up run-away girls as sex slaves.  In this direction, sex scenes are of inter-racial nature.  The weak plot spends no time to show explicit scenes.  Let's go back to this madam.  She was dead in the end.
Watch this movie all the way then.
Finally, these two are vintage movies.  Pictures and lighting effect going through reprint, are not as perfect.  Pricing too high?",1389571200,5,1010,4.461538461538462

8586948,2,B00CWHWV7O,"Vixens of Kung-Fu was the porn industry's earlier attempts at parodying Hollywood movies, in this case 70's era martial arts films. A prostitute living in New York was gang-raped by three men and then turns to a kung-fu master to teach her how to defend herself and get revenge on her assailants. The opening scene of the gang rape was hokey. One of the men (Bobby Astyr) shoots the prostitute (Bree Anthony) in the back as she's running away from them. Then the three men take a picnic blanket, lay it out, and gently put Anthony onto the blanket to make sure she doesn't get any grass stains or dirt as they're violating her. If only more rapists were more respectful of their victims like the three men were in this movie then this world would be a much better place. There wasn't a connection between the background music and the scene itself, as the music was this country banjo music. Her unconscious body was later discovered along the sands of a beach by a female kung-fu master (C.J. Laing) who proceeds to take her into her inner circle of women warriors.

""I will teach you kung-fu,"" Laing tells the prostitute. ""If any man attacks you, you will be able to resist him or even kill him."" While porn parodies are fine, an adult film has to contain a lot of hot sex action and there wasn't anything in Vixens which was hot.

In Oriental Blue, Peonies Jong plays a madam who supplies women to a middle-man Max of the World Bordello Association who, in turn, uses the women as prostitutes in an international sex trade. Madam Blue eventually has to deal with an insubordinate employee Brock (Jamie Gillis) who is holding out on her when he doesn't hand over an attractive, innocent girl (Bree Anthony) to her. While Jong played the role of the Oriental Madam well, as did Anthony who was a natural as the hapless damsel in distress, there isn't that many good sex scenes in Blue. The only decent scene is the girl-girl action between Jong and Cedar Houston.

There are adult movies from this era which are much better than this Bill Milling double feature.",1420934400,2,2062,4.5675675675675675
