How two great friends can endure through seemingly insurmountable differences. in the end their love and  respect for each other, helps heal all the wounds.",943315200,4,269,4.723404255319149
683589,5,6303536859,I thought as far as sequels went it was one of the best I've ever seen.  The only complaint I have is I can't find the third movie in the series that aired on tv..Heaven and Hell.  It seems rather incomplete without it  available.,935020800,3,230,4.181818181818182
683620,5,6303536859,"I have to say I loved the whole story, I saw Book 1 and Book 2 again recently. The story between the Hazards and the Mains was wonderful. From the friendship of George Hazard and Orrey Main to the oddness and excentricities of Virgilia Hazard as well and the scheming and lack of scruples of Ashton Main)Hontoon.
I think it is a wonderful story to be enjoyed by all, keep in mind there are some passionate scenes, of course by today's standards that may be a stretch.",1079395200,3,467,4.379310344827586
683621,5,6303536859,"Excellent piece of work! I've seen it on tv and on video many times and it never failed to amaze me. The story is about enduring love, friendship, courage, loyalty, dignity, respect, and strength of character. It shows the goodness in a human being and how it always triumphs over what is bad. It is a masterpiece indeed! I regret that I haven't recorded it for my collection. I'd love to have it on DVD.",1071619200,2,404,4.4
683622,5,6303536859,"I haven't purchased the videos/dvds, but I just had to write a review!!  I was living in Charleston, SC when they were making the miniseries!!  It was funny because in Historic Charleston (2 Meeting Street Inn) is where most of it was filmed-they had to dump dirt in the streets to make it authentic looking and the Historic Society went nuts!!  I loved living in Charleston and my greatest memory is of the charm and grace of that area! This VHS/DVD set is definitely on my Santa List!! (I also have the Novel!)  Happy Holidays, All!

683623,5,6303536859,"The North and South series is my favorite miniseries - it's head and shoulders above any other one I've seen.  It's got so many engaging storylines and just the right balance of characters you can really root for (or love to hate) and soap opera cheeziness.
I gave North and South Book One a 5-star rating too, but if I were pressed to decide, I think I would pick Book Two as the better overall miniseries.  Book Two is more consistently entertaining than Book One, and Orry (Patrick Swayze) just gets more endearing as he ""ages""!",1020816000,6,531,4.520833333333333
683624,5,6303536859,"NORTH AND SOUTH: BOOK 2 is superior in every way to the original. It takes us into the middle of the bloodiest war ever fought on American soil! Another one for the history buffs as well as for those who love romance and action. Witness very realistic re-enactments of the battles of First Manassass, Antietam, Gettysburg, and the final assault on Petersburg, as well as a heart-wrenching recreation of the surrender at Appomattox. Great historical drama! Grade: A+
*Miss the abysmal final chapter of the sereis: HEAVEN AND HELL: NORTH AND SOUTH, BOOK 3.",1016841600,16,554,4.904255319148936
683625,5,6303536859,"I start to feel old when I think, ""Why don't they make them like this anymore?."" Ah well, at any rate, this is the best of the best, and I say that not only coming from a person who has a great love for history, but just general viewing. The casting in this is almost uniformly excellent, and while it is, of course, fictionalized history, it does an excellent job of telling both sides of this great divisive war. It's got the expected 80s camp (at times you feel like you're watching an historical episode of Dynasty), but it is wonderfully engrossing and never fails to please. I do have one complaint and that is that this is not out on DVD yet. They could make a fortune! I'm glad to pick it up though as I've been watching my old taped version (complete with election returns from the mid 80s) forever. I see others below have written that the books must be read as well and some even say they're better. I have to disagree with that. I've always felt Jakes generally only writes two-dimensional female characters - women are either saints or, well, the other kind. This is not coming from someone who is hypersensitive, but the female characters were much more rounded out in the miniseries. Anyone who gets this won't be disappointed.",1007164800,6,1242,4.5
683626,5,6303536859,"To say that if one has read the book the movie doesn't compare is comparing apples to nails.  I've read the Bible, and to date, no movie compares.  Enjoy ""North and South"" for what it is, a story of two families.  The acting is superb, the scenery devine.  It's history, without the history.  I highly recommend both sets to those who may be civil war buffs.  It tells a story, and makes us all proud of our heritage, beit North or South.",991785600,6,438,4.280487804878049

7850533,4,6303536859,"Pretty much a good continuation of the Book One series. Good scenery. Good costuming. Good acting and believable characters but really more of a soap opera set in the civil war than a civil war saga. Battle scenes in peticular are quite stale.

One thing I did like was the conference of Jefferson Davis's cabinate which pretty much shows the audience why the South lost. Lack of unity in purpose as well as its inferior resources as compared to the North's. Confronted by the Northern strategy to blockade and strangle the south into submission while Northern armies move to take the Mississipi and occupy the northern parts of the Confederacy to divide it the main responce is for some to call Winfield Scott (who was born in Virginia) a  traitor. When reasonable minds bring up the only means for the South with its much inferior resources to win indipendance by invading the North, the responce is to refuse since some Southern states won't go along and many would see it as a defeat of their 'Moral position'.

Overall this is not a war movie it is a soap opera set during the Civil war.",1150588800,,1092,4.618556701030927

I want to add it to my collection.",1106438400,2,271,3.8035714285714284
