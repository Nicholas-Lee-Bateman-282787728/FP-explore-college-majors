7958180,3,B0000633S7,"Well, Goku says goodbye in this volume, as due to fighting Majinn Buu in his SSJ3 form during the previous one, his time on Earth has been spent.  Although these episodes feel a bit slow-pace after ""Defiance,"" they're still worth checking out, since the scene with Goku's goodbye is done pretty well.  Also, the previous volume features Buu encountering a blind kid(voiced by Hayashibara Megumi!) and winds up helping the kid up when his attempt to make the kid fear him backfires.  A little WAFFy, but nice, although I would like it to get on with the main story as soon as possible.  Although this one isn't must-buy like some of the other DVDs in the Buu saga, fans should check it out if they have the time.",1067904000,,711,4.53125
