4444234,1,B004P9MRQW,"While this product says playable in all regions, it does NOT play on my new Sony Blu ray player in region 1.  I purchased my new Blu ray player specifically because of this DVD series.  I'm so tired of false info & JUNK.",1326585600,5,220,4.093023255813954
4444235,5,B004P9MRQW,"I accidentally found this series and love it. It is funny, quirky, and completely addicting.  I hope they plan on making another season. Each character (albeit played by only a handful of actors) some how charm one while watching, especially David, Mr. Lomax and Tea Tree. I just love this series.",1319068800,8,297,4.823529411764706

4444246,5,B004P9MRQW,"is the message written with quill pen on parchment from the unknown antagonist -- a message that somehow connects the 5 completely different, yet creepy, protagonists of this series.

Twisted premise, twisted characters, ridiculously over the top nonsense, dwarf porn, this show has it all! Highly entertaining, very dark, comedy.

This show is a series of interrelated skits of disparate characters several of whom are played by Reece Sheersmith and Steve Pemberton who also brought us The League Of Gentlemen. Cross-dressing in the best traditions of British comedy, many cheap prosthetics, great accents, horrible haircuts.

Regarding the issues people have with playback ... from discussions with other people, it seems that there are one or two major brands of Blu-Ray players that have lots of trouble playing these ""region free"" disks produced in the UK. From what I've heard, Sony brand Blu-Ray players in particular simply won't play these disks. I have both an LG and a Samsung BD player, both are Region 1 only players and not 'all region' players, and they each play these disks without any problems. Odds are that most 'Region 1' players will play these disks just fine. Just not Sony.",1396137600,2,1198,5.1020408163265305
4444247,5,B004P9MRQW,"This is one of my favorite shows, and I am so glad to finally own it. Most of my friends think jokes about serial killers and whatnot are off putting, but I don't care. Maureen and David Sowerbutts are the absolute best, and Mr. Lomax and Tea-Leaf never fail to put a smile on my face. If you liked League of Gentlemen, you'll probably love this.

However, despite the specifications under ""Product Details,"" which state the discs can be played in all regions, they will not play on most Region 1 blu-ray players, like mine. Luckily for me, I also have a region-free blu-ray player, which plays the discs fine, or I might have been quite upset upon my first attempt to play them. In other words, before you buy this, either have a region-free blu-ray player or try to read and understand the technical gobbledygook in the ""editorial reviews"" section.",1395878400,,850,4.629139072847682
4444248,4,B004P9MRQW,Whilst it's not (nor does it make a claim to be) League of Gentlemen this is an entertaining series.  It's not as fast paced as LoG but the characters and writing is of the usual high standard - and fans will want to take a look.,1385078400,,229,3.9782608695652173
4444249,5,B004P9MRQW,Will not work on PS3! I use the blu ray player in my pc to watch this title. Great series full of weird characters and a constant WTF feeling that you can only get from across the pond!,1384300800,,185,3.8947368421052633
4444250,5,B004P9MRQW,"These sitcoms are pretty sarcastic and will spoil you for most serious horror flics(if there is such a thing)-Audition for most american horror flics-""how do you look in a short low cut dress and how loud can you scream unexpectedly before anyone can hit the mute button?"" In American flics everybody gets off work for the weekend and then gets murdered in these Brit-sitcoms everybody is already permanently off work on disability anyway and then get ignored but imagine they've been murdered or something like that.",1378080000,,517,5.023255813953488
4444251,5,B004P9MRQW,"If you are a fan of The League of Gentlemen then you will love Psychoville! Great character development, incredibly funny and creepy as hell.",1369526400,,141,4.916666666666667
4444252,5,B004P9MRQW,"If you love dark comedy, strange British humor and overall just bizarre shows - this is perfect.

Being in the USA and seeing some other reviewers having issues playing discs (due to region issues), I was a bit hesitant to make this purchase and pushed it off several times out of concern that I wouldn't be able to play it.  I was surprised to find that my player did just fine.",1365552000,5,379,4.323943661971831
4444253,5,B004P9MRQW,If your from England and like spoof comedy this is the ultimate show. Yes you need a multi region DVD player to watch this but if your a fan of the English world of wacky fun its worth buying a multi player for this show.,1359936000,5,221,3.933333333333333
4444254,1,B004P9MRQW,"It is not an American copy and does not work on American equipment.  I was extremely embarrassed as I gave as a gift, they couldn't return it and I spent a good deal on this.",1331683200,3,174,3.9714285714285715
8437599,1,B004P9MRQW,I love the show. Just wanted to be able to watch it. This seems to be a European disc. Unplayable. Tried several different players and won't work on any of them.,1525478400,,161,4.225806451612903
8437600,5,B004P9MRQW,Great quality.  It IS region 2 so you will need a UK or European Blueray player to watch.,1521158400,,89,3.9444444444444446
8437601,1,B004P9MRQW,This is not compatible with my tv. Too late to return by the time we tried to watch it.,1513814400,2,87,3.6315789473684212
8437602,1,B004P9MRQW,Sold as All Region but does not play on my 2 USA players.,1462492800,2,57,3.4615384615384617
8437603,5,B004P9MRQW,"We never got to see this on TV in the USA.  Well I didn't 't anyway.  We didn't even get the complete 3rd series of The League of Gentlemen; there is something about Steve and Reece's dark humour that just does not sit well with the US networks, not even BBC America.  Which is a shame, because these 12 programmes are just splendid.  We binge watched both series over 2 consecutive nights, and would recommend everyone else to do likewise.  I have never been a fan of Dawn French, but even she is magnificent here.  If nothing else, you should watch the Tina Turner scene - how could anyone not laugh at that?  We will be binge watching Inside Number 9 next - another show that didn't quite cross the Atlantic.  Any fans of The League of Gentlemen should appreciate the writing and acting in Psychoville.  There is even a mini TLOG reunion, which takes place right next door to the pub in New Tricks no less.",1453248000,,909,4.395209580838324

8437606,3,B004P9MRQW,They probably should have stopped at the end of season one...,1438992000,,61,4.636363636363637
8437607,5,B004P9MRQW,I love this show.  This set includes the Halloween special and commentary tracks.  LoG fans rejoice.,1436659200,,100,5.1875
8437608,5,B004P9MRQW,"You need a region free DVD player to view in the U.S. but if you have one, you should get this DVD set. It is wildly funny! Reece Sheersmith and Steve Pemberton are amazing. This is ""dark"" humor at it's best. Not for kids under 15.",1427760000,,231,4.043478260869565
