8048079,5,B0007LFPQG,"This is a wonderful movie!  The plot, setting, cast, and the food! What a delightful vehicle for telling a story. What I don't understand is WHY it has not been digitally remastered and then offered for sale at an affordable price.",1518134400,,231,4.634146341463414
8048080,5,B0007LFPQG,"I've been looking for this movie at an affordable price for quite some time. Although this wasn't a new copy it was in excellent condition. I'm very happy with this!
Also, I managed to get my husband to watch it. And even if it is *very* slow paced at the beginning it warms up and is a wonderful tale of English boy's school life. Honestly, I'd watch it just for Christopher Lee alone but it's good regardless.",1401321600,,411,4.35064935064935
8048081,5,B0007LFPQG,"I have seen this movie and its such a good film. I had it sitting on my wishlist forever hoping it would become available. Please if someone wants to sell it, Contact me. Id really like to own a feast at middnight.",1376870400,,214,4.119047619047619
8048082,5,B0007LFPQG,"OK, there's a whole genre of flicks about kids at the UK ""public"" (US ""private"") schools. Bullies, cliques, brutal headmasters (""How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?""), and all that coming-of-age stuff. An ordinary movie will constrain itself to the tropes of the genre.

But an extraordinary movie can take that same setting and use it as the launch pad for something truly exceptional, as this one does. Oh, it has all the usual, including the nasty little kid ratting out our adventurers. And the heroes are the outcast kids who boldly go where no young man has gone before, And they get just about everyone on their side, toward the end.

What really charmed me, though, was the crystallizing force behind the transformative moment: food. The ""scoffers"" gravitate towards one small boy's disgust with the school's ""healthy"" (i.e., inedible) menu, and his unshakeable devotion to doing something about it. He leads the midnight forays into the forbidden kitchen, he launches the sorties into town for disallowed ingredients, he charms the Keeper of the Kitchen with his advanced art, he gets the girl (kind of, the way a nine year old boy might), he creates a growing body of expertise in the cohort that accretes around him. And, in the end, he is expelled - that is, he is freed from the oppressive environment to go on to greater things.

Maybe it's a tweenage power fantasy - if you're a kid, you'll read it that way. But, as an adult, you'll see a boy with a skill, and with no power to suppress it. It must come out, it shall come out, and he will devote himself to it with the laser-like focus of mind that only small boys, or maybe teens with no girlfriend, can ever achieve. And, when a young man is consumed by such a skill, it can only possibly draw in the young men around him. That skill pulls those others up to his level, if they let themselves be elevated.

It's a fun kid-power flick, at skin level. But, if you listen closely enough, you'll hear something much stronger and truer deep in its heart.

8048083,4,B0007LFPQG,"It really is a good movie but when the online price hit $100,000.00 I figure they really don't want to sell any.  Not sure what happened there but the original price at $30.00 was more than I was willing to pay.  When the price went through the roof I dumped it off my wish list.",1352678400,,279,4.054545454545455
8048084,3,B0007LFPQG,"I found this not too long ago & when I saw it was a kid's movie that had Christopher Lee in it, I thought it too strange to just pass up.  It puts me in mind of a 60's style British boy's school movie, with lots of typical things that schoolboys get up to, etc.  Kind of fun, but really not my thing.

I have to wonder about the people complaining about the quality of the DVD on this though...looked fine to me...it's from the Televista/Substance/Jef Video gang, and I do own many of those,but as their quality goes, it's not bad at all.  They can be pretty hit or miss with quality, but this seems to be one of the better ones...maybe I'm just not [...] enough.  3 out of 5 stars.",1247702400,,682,4.097744360902255
8048085,5,B0007LFPQG,"This movie is the cream of the crop,it is what I had expected and should not be Americanize. It's just a truly brilliant movie and the children are cute too.",1244160000,,157,4.266666666666667
8048086,3,B0007LFPQG,"The combination of bad video and poor audio dissapointed me. I'd seen the movie before and enjoyed it, but this DVD could've been made from a webcam in the balcony for as bad as it was.",1127520000,5,185,4.166666666666667
8048087,1,B0007LFPQG,the move itself is great but the cd looked like it had been copied from a bad vhs tape. whole sections were missing and the movie contrast was terrible.,1124582400,7,152,4.275862068965517
