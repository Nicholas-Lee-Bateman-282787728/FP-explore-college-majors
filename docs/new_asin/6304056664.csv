769505,3,6304056664,"This is a good movie that contains everything we expect to see in a Yuen Woo-Ping movie. Some humor, a simple story and well-choregraphed fight scenes. Nothing spectacular, but nothing very bad. Donnie Yen (Iron Monkey) does less impressive stunts than in his other movies, but Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) is great in that one. I quite liked the fight sequence with tofu between her character and Master Wong.
As for the DVD... The picture, while a little bit yellow, is better than I expected. The sound isn't really good though. The worst is tha navigation through the different menus. They are really slow.
It's worth buying for that price, but it could have been better.",983318400,3,693,4.88135593220339
769506,4,6304056664,"First of all let me say that i judge this film from the fight choreography  / cinematography aspect alone.
In all other aspects the film is very good  ( again , i've seen better , but it has nothing to be ashamed of ).
If  you're interested mainly in the techniqe and  fighting choreography , and  complexity , it is a totaly average film.  I didn't percive any advanced  wing chun. Really , nothing special.
Ofcourse , i was surprized , for i  knew it's a woo-ping film , but that's the way it is.
The film lacked a  strong villain , and i'm afraid that although Michelle Yeoh is supposedly  an excellent martial artist and acrobat , she's not really a martial  artist! ( read her bio ).
She's not strong enough for the lead role , oh  , she's good , but as i said , this is not a top-grade film , as far as  choreography , complexity , speed , and perfection of techniqe go.
I  think very highly of her but she doesn't have enough carizma. She's the  perfect side-kick for people like Jackie Chan ( supercop ) , or Jet Li (  The Tai-Chi Master ).
Again , in all other aspects it is very good ,  good plot , acting , and the magical hand of Yuen woo-ping is felt. I was a  bit disappointed. For those who claim this to be the best wing chun film  ever made , get ""Prodigal son"" and put a sock in it.",965952000,2,1300,4.0078125
769507,4,6304056664,"This is a great Kung-Fu flick with some pretty impressive fights throughout the movie Yuen Woo-Ping style,While it can't touch some of his action masterpieces like TAI-CHI MASTER or FIRE DRAGON,this movie contains  a healthy nouurishment of well choregraphed fight scenes. While it is a  rather silly movie(especially if you own the english dub) it does have good  cinematography,be warned though this is a sort a women's rights movement  type of movie being that the women fight superior to the men,which isn't a  problem in some movies,but with Donnie Yen co-starring it kind of  dissapointed me (althogh Donnie has some great scenes as well).In all not a  must buy,but definitley should be checked out by any Yuen Woo-Ping fan.",958176000,,730,5.084033613445378

769659,5,6304056664,"This is a wonderful light hearted movie with Michelle Yeoh and Donnie Yen. This movie plays off the legend that Wing Chun was taught a type of Kung Fu which was later named after her.
The legend has it that she was being forced to marry a man she didn't want to so she ran away and learnt Kung fu from a Shaolin nun. The movie has a lot of comedy and some nice fight action. In the movie no one actually uses the Wing Chun style of fighting though. It also makes fun of the roles of women and men. This Donnie Yen in this movie is nothing like his current films and it's a huge change if all you have seen are his current movies!.
The plot is kept interesting with the little twist and turns and constant misunderstandings. I won't give away much of the movie as you should just see it unbiased. I will say if you are used to a fast paced, action packed Kung fu movie this is not for you! This is a cute movie which is basically a love story (or two!)  with some fun action thrown in.

Wing Chun is the name of Michelle Yeoh's character, and yes, she has a Wing Chun training tree (it looks a lot like an irregular coat rack, but that's what they use).

This is probably Donnie Yen's funniest appearance.

It is a Wuxia romantic comedy, the structure of which isn't far off from the All's Well, Ends Well franchise.  At any rate, everyone gets married in the end and the bad guys aren't just thwarted, they happily call Wing Chun their mommy at the end.

The movie is from 1994, before Michelle Yeoh and Donnie Yen were big name stars.  I bought it thinking the movie would have something to do with Wing Chun.  This is just the female characters name.  The movie actually is one of those ""comical half the cast gets beaten up"" kung fu movies.  Very little to keep your attention or desire to watch it all the way through.  I was wondering why Michelle Yeoh would even make such a movie, but this preceeds all of her more modern films, which are great.  So if you want the 80's and 90's Kung Fu theater type movie with little story line, go for it.  If you want something about Wing Chun and something with a plot, pass on this movie.",1361145600,4,852,4.382165605095541

769922,3,6304056664,"""Wing Chun"" is the movie which bests demonstrates and shows the martial arts skills of Michelle Yeoh.  Although not as much in the limelight as the female lead, an up and coming Donnie Yen makes his presence felt as Michelle Yeoh's ally in battle and long-time friend.  The action sequences from start to finish are truly excellent.  The again the great Woo-Ping Yuen, best known to American film goers for his action choreography in the ""Matrix"" and ""Kill Bill"" is directing this piece and he is the best in the world when it comes to martial arts movies.  In addition, the movie has comedic scenes intelligently to keep the mood light, particularly the device of mistaken identity.

The picture quality is average at best on this dvd - and that is the reason I gave 3 stars instead of 4, but that results from the quality of film used in Hong Kong at the time.  There are some subtitling errors scattered throughout the film as well, but they are easily overlooked during the well-done fight scenes.  The specific edition I bought does not come with any special features.  Perhaps this will be changed if Dragon Dynasty elects to remaster the movie for a future release.

A veteran of many movies, both from Hong Kong and western cinema, Michelle Yeoh has a wide range of movies to have in one's collection.  Where ""Supercop"" demonstrates her stunt capabilities and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" shows her dramatic acting ability, this film, ""Wing Chun"", solidly establishes another facet of Michelle Yeoh on the silver screen, her martial arts skills.",1316390400,,1557,4.841509433962264

769926,4,6304056664,"Back in the day - because this is a martial arts period piece - in a Chinese village, the tomboyish girl Yim Wing Chun was the mightiest and most fearless of fighters (she's also a soya bean cook), and this didn't at all sit well with the menfolk (the fighting, that is; the guys were fine with the soya bean stuff). But it was Yim Wing Chun who drove away the bandits whenever they went pillaging in the village (and these bandits pillaged like clockwork). And then things came to a head when a lovely damsel-in-distress named Charmy arrived, seeking help for her ill husband (who soon dies anyway). Charmy became instantly coveted by the bandits, and Wing Chun was again forced to intervene. The bandits ranted and raved and vowed revenge. Except, when all was said and done, the girl Yim Wing Chun was still the mightiest fighter. Even if, ten years before, she was the reigning ""Miss Soya Bean."" Apparently, back in the day, soya bean was a delicacy. Huh.

If you're jonesing for the lyricism and majesty of, say, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, then stroll away from this one, friend. This one has low brow comedy and high flying kung fu jostling elbows in this entertaining Michelle Yeoh actioner, WING CHUN, and let me mention that it's entertaining despite the low brow comedy. If you can get past the lame stabs at a sex farce and that the luminous Michelle Yeoh is continuously mistaken for a dude (and so what if she dresses like a man?) and the baffling concept of soya bean as the Jamba Juice of its day, then you may survive to the film's highlights, which predictably are the tremendously staged fight scenes. Acclaimed director Yuen Wo Ping architects his patented wire-work, and Yeoh and the underused Donnie Yen (who plays her fiance Leung Pok To) do the rest. Michelle Yeoh when in motion is grace and precision personified. Heck, even when she's still, she's engrossing. Michelle Yeoh walks into a room and owns it.

WING CHUN's script more or less flows off the popular ancient legend surrounding the founding of wing chun. Released in 1994, the fights in this film still stand the test of time, are so wildly entertaining. Donnie Yen's character takes on the bandit Flying Monkey in a great matchup, and then Michelle Yeoh has the rest of the fight highlights. The best two showcases for her skills (and I'm not even counting the time she employs fire to castrate a dude) are her final showdown with the Flying Chimpanzee (and his sucking cotton belly), and there's a segment there which pits her twin blades against his mighty champion spear, and then even more memorably, in an earlier scene, her dazzling fending off of her challenger, the ""magnificent pugilist"" Master Wong, from her tray of soya bean cube. I really do get a kick out of whenever Yeoh exhibits that quiet swagger of hers, and, brother, does she ever teach this chump a lesson. And as a bonus for longtime viewers of wuxia cinema, the great Pei-Pei Cheng has a cameo as Wing Chun's sifu.

But, aargh! I really had no use for one particular relative of Yim Wing Chun's, namely that shrill and aggravating Aunty Abacus Fong, who isn't at all a funny character... even though you have to give her credit.

One might call this a slyly-humorous, feminist, *tofu*, kung-fu flick, probably the only member of that category in existence.

It certainly offers some good fight scenes, including a fight standing on horses running through  flaming trees, and other on a spear thrust into a wall.

But, truly unique is the amazing battle in which Michelle defends a big block of tofu from attack by the local tough guy.  This scene must be seen to be disbelieved.

In China, the subtitles used ""Miss soya bean curd"", which has changed in the DVD to the less evocative ""Tofu princess"". Some other strange translations disappeared as well, alas, but still, highly-recommended.",1241913600,2,876,4.958904109589041

Bandits then appear and Wing Chun drives them off after the local male fighters fail miserably, and she also rescues Charmy.  Charmy's husband dies and so she tries to sell herself to pay for the cost of the funeral.  Wing Chun (with the help of her relative) gives Charmy enough money to bury her husband and in exchange Charmy agrees to become an employee of the Soya Bean shop.  Charmy dresses in clothes formally worn by Wing Chun, as Wing Chun used to work for the Soya Bean shop.  Sometime later, another skilled warrior, Leung Pok To (Donnie Yen), has come to seek Wing Chun, since they were going to get married.  He finds the Soya Bean shop and mistakes Charmy for Wing Chun, because it has been a long time since he has actually seen Wing Chun.  In the evening, one of the bandit leaders, Flying Monkey, returns to the village to attack Wing Chun (Charmy), and Leung Pok To saves her, and Charmy is greatful.  However, the next day, when Charmy is alone with Leung Pok To attempting to express gratitude, he is feels something is not quite correct.  Sometime later, the real Wing Chun goes to meet Flying Monkey outside the village and defeats him easily using a non-traditional method.  Flying Monkey's master, Flying Chimpanzee, learns of the defeat, then seeks Wing Chun and challenges her.  After a consultation with Wing Chun's master, Wing Chun and Leung Pok To fully reconcile their differences and travel to the bandits' hideout together with the intent to get married after the conflict.  After a long battle, Flying Chimpanzee is subdued, and Leung Pok To and Wing Chun get married.

Despite these cosmetic flaws, this is a well made ""wire fu"" movie directed by Yuen Woo Ping in 1994.  There is a fighting style called ""Wing Chun"", but this film has NOTHING to do with that.",1168041600,8,2161,4.707446808510638
769973,4,6304056664,"As a pure Kung Fu movie, if you enjoy the more comedic, wire-fu style, Yuen Woo-Ping (choreographer of the Matrix) delivers. Both Donnie Yen (a trained film fighter who plays Leung Bok-Cho) and Michelle Yeoh (not a trained fighter but a dancer who's consistently given great action on screen, who plays Yim Wing-Chun) personify their legendary characters with charm, grace, and ferocious martial intent.

If you're looking for a Wing Chun movie that showcases the actual Wing Chun style, however, you're better served by Sammo Hung's Prodigal Sons and Warriors Two. This movie uses the characters and style mostly in name only, with a story drawn, but far removed from, any of the traditional versions, and a style far more high flying and stunt based.

Still, I can think of no fan or exponent who wouldn't thrill just a little to see the beautiful landscapes and settings, and see the characters brought to life, and imagine what it might have been like in the days of legend.",1136764800,19,978,4.850299401197605
769974,5,6304056664,The movie is great.  The best Chinese film I've seen.  It's a lot of fun to watch.  The choregrophy is mesmirising.  And I love it when Michelle Yeoh teaches her enemies to call her mama.  It is a great action-comedy film with a touch of romance.,1127347200,,246,4.260869565217392
769975,4,6304056664,"Yuen Woo Ping does it again!  This movie teams up two of the best there is, Michelle Yeoh and Donnie Yen.  Throw in masterful fight choreography and good kung fu humor and you have another great addition to your movie collection.  Wing Chun(Yeoh) is both powerful and graceful, not to mention gorgeous!  She is a master of kung fu and respected by all, except the bad guys.  They never learn.  I am always astounded by Yeoh's skill and this movie showcases it beautifully!

Donnie Yen lives up to his reputation as usual.  Incredibly fast and always showing his style and flare that nobody seems to match, he is just awesome to watch!  He plays Wing Chun's love interest, that is as soon as he figures out which one she is!  It is pretty comical how this all comes about.  I must say that this movie is one of the funnier kung fu films that I have seen.  Being both funny, loaded with great fights, and having a fairly well told story(although nothing too original) you should enjoy this one!

The only flaws in this movie are the lower quality film that was used(not the worst ever though) and the subtitles fly by in most parts of the film.  Be ready to speed read!  These are the reasons I did not give it five stars.  This should not discourage you from seeing this though.  With great action from start to finish this is one film not to be missed.  Be sure to check it out!",1091059200,9,1378,4.358267716535433
769976,1,6304056664,"Main gripe, NOT wing chun in the least. The real martial art isn't practiced at all in the movie that is supposed to show it's formation. Pathetic. even the cover is misleading, in a system where no kicks are delivered above the waist. Also, there are far more entertaining movies starring female martial artists.",1083456000,7,313,4.814814814814815
769977,5,6304056664,"Michelle Yoeh and Yuen Wo Ping, thank you. Wo Ping is definately the brilliant man of the hour and a half... This is a thrill-ride to say the least.  A blast to watch over and over. One of the best kung fu flicks.
  Yuen Wo Ping.... This guy would cut out, go to a corner or off the set, light up a smoke, and sit there and stare at the set in sort of a trance. The immagination and brilliance was being put to use. After his smoke, or ten minutes later or so, he'd come back knowing immediately and exactly what he wanted to do. He did this with all of his films.  This is his art, and every action fan should marvel in it. BUY it with NO hesitations (if you can find it).",1073433600,2,673,3.926470588235294
769978,4,6304056664,"A great martial arts movie.  The story line is funny and entertaining, and the fight scenes are well-executed.  There's a bit too much wire-fu for my taste, but there's plenty of non-wire stuff that kept me happy.  Michelle Yeoh (sigh) is wonderful, and Donnie Yen has great comedic sense, and both have super kung-fu skills.
The only annoyance was the appallingly bad subtitles, though they're sometimes bad enough to be fun in themselves.  They're not up to the standard of the rest of the DVD, though, by a long shot.  I have the HK version by Modern Audio Ltd., and I suppose that this issue may be specific to their release.  That aside, I heartily recommend the movie.",1061078400,2,674,4.669491525423729

Tarintino please work your magic like you did with Iron Monkey.
And get more Sonny Chiba flicks on DVD production while you are
at it! (*hint* Rolling Thunder *hint*)
4 stars due to lame ending. Should have been Donnie Yen and
Michelle Yeoh together fighting as a team against the guy that
carried a big spear because they were then married. This would
have been the transforming breaking ground for Yeoh's charecter.
Anyway this is Yeoh's best film!",1029456000,,571,4.72

770062,4,6304056664,"Hilarious story and dialogue, good acting, good martial arts.  The Shannon Gee review says Michelle Yeoh doesn't ""really"" use the Wing Chun style, but that's not entirely true.  She does use quite a few moves outside the system, and there's no excuse for having a supposed WC practitioner fly up into the air, but at least half her moves are pure Wing Chun.  This is obviously not the best example of WC on film, but there is enough to make a WC student say, ""Oh yeah, I know that move!""
My previous comment notwithstanding, the high-flying, impossible stunts are mostly kept to a minimum - although there are a few groaners, such as a tofu cake flying around Yeoh in a full circle, with a cartoonish slide-whistle sound effect.  And of course, the inevitable 20-foot high jump.
I also disagree with another reviewer about the subtitles.  I found them quite adequate and funny, and the choice of words doesn't pull any punches.",1005868800,,927,4.697530864197531
770063,4,6304056664,"I think I prefer this to supercop. If you want to see more of Michelle, this is a classic. The fight scenes are really cool (even a couple ""announce-your-moves-before-you-do-them"" moments). There is a lot of humor on this disc also, so get ready for a more off-beat jackie chan type adventure than a serious ang lee fest. The basic story is: Chun and her sister run a failing tofu stand, they adopt a pretty widow, and have to defend the stand from a group of bandits. A comedy of errors ensues when 2 men show up and confuse the 3 women. But who cares about plot. there are some strong fights. There is a particularly memorable fight involving the defense of a large tofu. Add this with a couple chan and li movies and you have the start of a great kung fu collection. The subtitles are great.",996710400,2,794,4.371621621621622

770066,5,6304056664,"I actually first watched this film late-night on TNT... I was blown away! Even watching such great theatrical artists like Jackie Chan and Jet Li... I was still amazed! The fight scenes are way over the top (if you are used to Hong Kong cinema, you'll feel right at home), but Yeoh's sheer flexibility and grace is awesome to watch as she fights with swords, sticks, and anything else handy.
Admittingly the English dubbing wasn't great (The voices don't seem to match the actors too well in some places and they sound a little strange at times), but the action more than makes up for it!
The story is almost comical, as Wing Chun's aunt constantly goads her father into stress-attacks, Badgers Wing Chun about her fighting ways and brings haggling to new levels in her business. Also, over half the town (including Wing Chun's childhood friend who returns from his travels) think Wing Chun is a man.

7860323,5,6304056664,"Very good early KungFu movie with now, superstars Donnie Yen, and Michelle Yoeh.  Like all the old-time KungFu movies there is a massive amount of wire-work and fantastical stunt work, which I generally don't like. But here, I am very OK with it. The most redeeming thing for me, is that there is a whole lot of sexy, flirty, cheeky-ness that is very well done. On some level, it sort of pretends to be a little historical, but the overall core of the movie does track loosely with one of the 'official' versions of the earliest origin of Wing-Chun.
{BTW, an even better, and probably more historically accurate movie about the origin of Wing-Chun is the movie ""Kung Fu Wing Chun"" which is incredibly entertaining with an amazingly attractive female star who was killed by her super-rich husband in a bizzare 3-way romance-based murder/suicide just a few years after it came out}",1464048000,2,879,4.782894736842105
