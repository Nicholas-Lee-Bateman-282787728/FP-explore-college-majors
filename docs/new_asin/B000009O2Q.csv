7905572,1,B000009O2Q,"I ordered this movie because amazon said that it was the one that stars leslie anne warren and Rip Torn, but it's NOT!  It's a different movie which happens to also be called Betrayal.  I got ripped off!  Don't buy this movie!",1332288000,,226,4.333333333333333
7905573,1,B000009O2Q,"The cover photo shows Jeremy Irons and Patricia Hodge in a clip from the filmed Harold Pinter play of the same name. This is totally dishonest as this garbage has nothing to do with the Pinter play.
Amazon should not be involved in scams of this nature.",1185062400,3,253,4.404255319148936
7905574,2,B000009O2Q,"Do not be misled by this item. It seems to be Harold Pinter's great ""Betrayal"" with Jeremy Irons and Patricia Hodge, shown on the cover. The cover photo has nothing to do with film. It is a poorly transferred made for tv movie, which I didn't even bother to watch. I have been waiting for Pinter's
Betrayal which has yet to be put onto dvd and was hoping this would be it. Don't bother with this dud.",1182297600,6,400,4.207792207792208
7905575,5,B000009O2Q,"This film is extremely important about our vision of women in our world, how women can become instruments or tools for the pleasure of some men who have authority. Here it is the situation of a woman who goes to a psychiatrist for help. This man uses the tremendous power he gets over her, due to the transference she experiences and that is part of the treatment and the guarantee that she may be cured, to force her into sex. This woman is utterly destroyed, or could be utterly destroyed if she did not find a couple of lawyers who are going to help her fight back, and she will win, even if the doctor in his appeal will manage to be exonerated from his crime. That is the second harsh lesson of this film : justice is not always fair and the poweful of this world always manage to get the upper hand. But the battle is enough for this woman to regain her own balance, her own sanity, her own hope that life is after all livable, in spite of that cruelty that can assail us so often.
