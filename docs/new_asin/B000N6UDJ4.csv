8175367,2,B000N6UDJ4,"This was the most boring food dvd I have seen, not only is it ancient, but most of the recipes are old, I read the reviews but I did not realise this was from the 80s, at least they showed some landmarks and history.",1434844800,2,216,3.9318181818181817

8175369,3,B000N6UDJ4,"The program is interesting, though its restaurant food, and largely ""haute cuisine"" at that.  Watching the cooking parts is pretty null; you get basic English narration with the Chefs just cooking. I think it would have been much, MUCH better if the Chefs had described what the dish is striving for, what they are doing, tips, etc.  I appreciate this would have been in French, but that would have been better, assuming English subtitles could be provided.  I hope the producers will try again  - perhaps with a more bourgeois cooking style focus.",1421625600,,548,4.860215053763441
8175370,3,B000N6UDJ4,I have already seen this series on TV a long time ago. It was like a nostalgia section to see them again. I only imagine how the presenters must have aged by now.,1395273600,,162,3.9393939393939394
8175371,4,B000N6UDJ4,"The quality of the recording and production is very good.  The show has a tour-like quality and shows important sites and monuments in France and briefly mentions the history behind them.  The chefs are obviously quite skilled.  The main complaint I had was the number of errors the narrator makes.  This woman clearly is not a cook.  She frequently identifies ingredients incorrectly.  If you are watching the film you see her repeatedly confuse chives and shallots, call ""slicing"" ""chopping"", etc.  In one case,  she points out the chef is adding onions and ginger to the pan, then next says he's adding garlic when it is clearly lemongrass that is being added.  Major steps are missing in the baking recipes.  It is rather annoying.  You can not learn much about cooking from this film.  It is much better as a tourist show.
Still, it's fun to watch if that is what you are looking for.",1191110400,29,889,4.701298701298701
