3414290,2,B0018BA72Q,"Silly story of a kidnapped Euro-babe and a wandering, bug-eyed mutant cannibal. As with most Franco films, there is little or no tension, poor f/x and a lot of female skin. Not one of those ""video nasties"" like Cannibal Ferox or Cannibal Holocaust: just tame and meandering. Being a Jess Franco film, it looks like it was shot in a day and a half; he's Europe's William ""One Shot"" Beaudine. So if you're hungry for a ""good"" cannibal film, look elsewhere; this one can wait.",1217635200,4,473,4.576470588235294
3414291,3,B0018BA72Q,"The film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging, bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb.  The problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking (through the jungle, up a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to pad out the running time.  Eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad English dubbing, gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras.

I thought this would be a jungle cannibal flick, but it turned out to be something else altogether. It takes about a half hour of boredom to really get going, but once it does it's okay. It's certainly plenty gross in parts, especially the close-ups of the creature's blood-smeared mouth.

The helicopter crashing scene and the scene where the hero is ""climbing up a cliff"" are particularly hilarious.  For a zombie/cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then I probably didn't see an uncut version.

This film seemed way too long even at only 78 minutes.",1216512000,5,1101,4.738219895287958

3414296,5,B0018BA72Q,"This movie explores a new dimension of human sexuality: the call of the jungle. It is a combination of Tarzan and the call of the wild with full nudity and erotic adventure. There is some gore in the movie, virgin sacrifice and a mild cannibal scene but mostly is about showing the beauty of Ursula Buchfellner. The nude scenes with Ursula are quite creative and she is one of the most beautiful actresses I have seen. At the end things work for the good guys. I strongly recommend this movie for somebody who is exploring a different kind of cinema one that takes you out of the common and boring movies scenes we see now of urban sex and violence. I give this movie 5 stars for its creativity, originality and for Ursula.",1385683200,5,723,4.443609022556391
3414297,5,B0018BA72Q,"I know my 5 star review isn't going to go well with a lot of people, but I keep watching this piece of trash and I'm still not bored of it.  It's loaded with nudity, and the entire thing could be described as pure garbage.  I like the cheap gore and jungle setting as well as the sleazy grindhouse feel.  The music is also pretty awful, but it gives the film a fun crappy type feel to it.  It should be noted that the film begins fast with gore and nudity, but then the pace slows up and there's some stuff that some people may find really boring, like people venturing around in the jungle.  However, the pace picks up again later on, and then it really starts to dish out the exploitation stuff with lots of full frontal nudity and some cheap but fun gore FX.  Sure, the gore FX are cheap and fake but that's the way a lot of fun grindhouse films are.  The blonde girl, Ursula Buchfellner, is also really great looking.  This is classic trash cinema, and I thought the DVD looks excellent considering it's so low budget; the color is a little faded and the contrast isn't fantastic, but this is a cheap and obscure film.  Depending on your taste, you'll probably either love it or hate it.",1323216000,7,1191,4.28125
3414298,3,B0018BA72Q,"Cult exploitation favorite Jes Franco directs this sordid tale about Laura, a sexy model who's kidnapped and whisked away into the jungle, and Peter, the bold Vietnam vet who sets out to find her.

Soon, Laura discovers it's not just her captors she has to fear; not only do the locals crave human flesh, but their bloodthirsty earthbound god wants Laura for himself.",1308355200,,367,4.825396825396825
3414299,1,B0018BA72Q,"How this film got to be a ""video nasty"" in the UK I will never know...it's one of the most dire and dreary excuses for ""entertainment"" I have ever seen. The plot centres around the kidnapping of a glamorous actress, who is hauled off to some remote island while her captors send off their ransom demands. The actress's father (or whoever) dispatches two mercenaries to collect the girl. Arriving on the island they try to outwit the kidnappers and save the girl. This is all very boring, so to liven things up, the film gives us a tribe of natives who are minding their own business and sacrificing young maidens regularly to a hideous mutant person who like to attack his victims and eat their skin off. I'm sure you can guess the rest.

Even if that was an interesting plot, the film manages to bungle absolutely everything. If you've ever seen any European cannibal shockers from the 1980's before, you might be hoping for some gory thrills, but there's nothing like that here. Because this is a Jess Franco film, all the nudity is upped, and everything else is botched. All we have are cheap shoddy effects, dreadful acting and terrible dubbing. Here's a quick checklist of the crud you're going to have to put up with if you choose to sit through this:

1. A tribe of natives who look like a rounded up bunch of staff from the local bars, kitted out with with loincloths and pointy sticks. There isn't even a token nod to trying to assemble people with a similar ethnic background to make up this so called ""lost tribe"".
2. A prowling monster who turns out to be a tall black guy with two crusty ping bong balls stuck over his eyes. He also ""eats"" skin in a way you would only do while being filmed in close-up for shock effect...i.e with his mouth wide open so that everything falls out of it all the time...can't be that hungry, then?
3. A lead villain with an atrocious plummy British accent and who also has no idea how to make an exchange of hostage for cash - he messes it up every time!
4. Fake blood that looks like glue - it actually hangs down in rubbery strings!
5. Typical cheap sensationalism by having the women naked or topless almost all the time (ok I know some people are not going to complain about that). But I'd like to know how men can rape through a skirt and with their trousers still on.
6. Editing so bad that you won't know what's going on most of the time - check out the climactic fight. I had to watch it twice to work out what happened (How did that stick get there? What's he standing on? How did he fall over that cliff?).
7. A ""bail out"" from a flying helicopter that clearly shows that the helicopter is actually on the ground.
8. Truly excruciating dialogue:

Reporter: ""Could you give me an opinion of the men in our country?""
Actress (while pulling ridiculous Jan Brady-esque modelling poses): ""I have no opinion of men - I just love them!""

Mercenary (after being asked to hand over the cash): ""There's no deal unless you bring the girl with you and come un-armed"".
Kidnapper: ""Ok, as you wish!"" (Erm, never done this before, pal?)

Naked girl at the mercy of two mercenaries with guns: ""When the tribe catches a young girl, they sacrifice her to their god, who eats her heart!""
Mercenary: ""Rest now and don't worry about it"".
Naked girl: ""Thank you!"" (she then immediately falls asleep).

7. Plus a hundred other things.

It's all absolute trash. Be glad someone else has sat through this so you don't have to.",1235952000,13,3455,4.457278481012659
3414300,2,B0018BA72Q,"What can I say about this Franco movie.  It's a Franco movie.  Don't expect much out of it except close up shots of pubic hair, not much, but enough.  A very hot blond girl who is  pretty much naked throughout the whole movie (only thing I realy liked about it) other than the final battle with bugged eyed cannibal man.  That was fun.  I realy hated and was annoyed with the sounds that came out of the cannibal.  It was so bad everytime, very frequent, it happened I had to turn down the volume.  Very bad use of fake blood.  Looked like paint.  Did I say the only thing good about this is the hot blond, there is another naked girl who you are introduced to later on in the movie that is very cute as well and looks great naked, and the final battle is entertaining.  The bugged eyed cannibal sucks.  Don't these people realize that if you want to fight off this cannibal dude, poke him in the eye.  It's not like his bug eyes are small, they are big targets.  Stupid acting, stupid gore, stupid use of sound effects. Stupid movie, but the girls are hot and naked alot.",1227398400,18,1072,4.242574257425742
3414301,1,B0018BA72Q,"As far as I'm concerned, most of Jesus Franco's films are pretty stinky, but DEVIL HUNTER is a low point even for him. If you're expecting a film along the lines of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, you're going to be disappointed. Lots and lots of scenes showing characters running through the jungle, plus some cheesy gore effects and a naked ""monster man"" with inept makeup are about all you get here. DEVIL HUNTER is for completists only, and even most of them will feel cheated. Bottom line: don't waste your money on this ridiculous junk, even if it is remastered and uncut...some films are rare for the best of reasons.",1218672000,4,612,4.675925925925926

8269060,4,B0018BA72Q,"Fans of ""serious"" cannibal movies may not find much value in this double feature blu-ray release, as it offers what are probably the two most absurd entries of the genre. Yes, there's plenty of guts on display, at least in Cannibal Terror, but then again, it takes more than a trip to the butcher shop to make a cinematic spectacle.

What this release offers instead is a double-dose of low budget, seat-of-the-pants early '80s film-making that can be roughly described as cannibal slapstick. Devil Hunter is the better of the two and has more exploitative content. It gets off to a roaring start, with its first 20 minutes including a nude sacrifice to a cannibal god of sorts, a kidnapping/rape and lots of ritualistic dancing to a funky bongo-driven soundtrack.

The flick then transitions into a more conventional action-oriented phase, as a couple of mercenaries square off against a motley band of kidnappers while the movie's lone cannibal -- a tall, dark-skinned freak with protruding blood-streaked eyes -- roves the jungle in search of female flesh.

Directed by stoner cinema favorite Jess Franco, Devil Hunter is unevenly paced but delivers the goods (mainly involving female nudity) and features enough of the usual Franco attributes (an exotic locale, interesting sound design and music, and inventive camera work) to entertain his fans. At 100 minutes long, it would have benefited from some trimming of the dull parts but one can always accomplish that manually with the fast-forward button.

Cannibal Terror, meanwhile, has apparently earned something of a distinction for being the worst cannibal movie ever made. And Franco can share part of the credit for that, as some of the ridiculous cannibal scenes were lifted from his other genre foray, Cannibals, which was produced by the same studio.

Actually, Cannibal Terror has a breezy pace, dishy actresses, an interesting soundtrack and as much bottom-scraping charm as any Something Weird Video release. What really makes this one a bit of a dud is its lack of exploitation assets. Nudity is minimal, though at one point there is a spirited (but fully-clothed) rape scene. Gore is limited to a brief knife-entering-flesh shot, some corpse remnants and overlong scenes of goofy-looking cannibals chowing on the aforementioned butcher shop cast-offs.

Both of these flicks succeed in being entertaining up to a point, and that point is about half-way through the running time in each case. After that, whatever off-kilter comedic appeal that's been mustered progressively wears thin, though Devil Hunter benefits from revisiting the naked dancer/cannibal sect drumming meme in its latter phase. Ultimately, the disc commands something near its asking price as the cheap thrills of the two movies together add up to a solid couple of hours of fun.

It helps that the blu-ray image quality is stellar in both movies, with Cannibal Terror looking particularly clear and color-rich. Devil Hunter boasts astonishing image clarity (especially for a Franco flick) but its color scheme is somewhat muted, with many scenes almost looking as if they were filmed through a sunglasses lens. It's still an eye-pleasing rendition, however, and otherwise flawless.

The upshot: These two flicks are far from ideal, even by low budget exploitation standards, but taken together they drum up enough of a cannibal-themed groove to put, if not a smile, then a grin on the face of the intrepid explorer of the celluloid jungle's lower reaches.",1448496000,,3492,5.179078014184397

8269063,5,B0018BA72Q,"Super-dooper-model, Laura Crawford (Ursula Fellner), is busily smiling and posing her way through South America. Nudity ensues. Poor Laura is abducted by masked goons, while taking a refreshing bath. Yep, DEVIL HUNTER (EL CANIBAL) is another Jess Franco film. This time, along w/ the ubiquitous nekkidness, a supernatural entity lurks! Man, is this thing ug-lee! It's got the world's worst case of pinkeye, as well as being a lover of human flesh. It gnaws on a naked lady, while the men look on. Native dancing commences, inter-cut w/ closeups of the creature's bloody teeth. Meanwhile, the kidnapping masterminds relax in their jungle lair. Of course, their favorite mode of relaxation includes torturing poor Laura. All this, while tribal drums play on... and on. And on. Thankfully, Laura's rescuers are on their way, in the form of a man sporting Nick Nolte's hair and Catfish Hunter's mustache, along w/ the fifth member of THE MONKEES. Oh no! The bloodshot, pop-eyed devil-god has seen their helicopter! Many deaths occur. DEVIL HUNTER is a very clunky, yet quite enjoyable hunk of Limburger. Franco's use of absurdity is on full display. The idiot dialogue, spoken in alternating spurts of hillbilly / Brooklyn English, only adds to the utter brain-hammering effects of this classic. The unnecessary nudity only adds to the overall crackpot atmosphere. A must for the Franco fanatic!...",1433721600,3,1394,5.2

8269065,4,B0018BA72Q,Classic Franco Schlock! .. a film that at times seems to make no sense but thats what makes it cool and basically funny all the way through at just how ridiculous and silly film is at times. basically completely inept and hilarious kidnappers take avery attractive Blonde to a completely remote island inhabited by cannibal worshipping natives. the bad guys are hopeless as crooks and the Hero of the movie so to speak is a brash ex war vet and his bumbling offsider. there is a large muscular black guy who is the island cannibal type god ..but his makeup and special effects used are so hilarious that he is just funny every time on screen. Bit of a slow burner for a Franco Film in terms of nudity etc. takes until mid film for any real decent footage of either violence .. funny as it is ..or ladies getting naked to happen ...very attractive Black girl in several scenes and main Blonde is very attractive ..usual Franco stuff ..good fun,1429401600,3,942,4.514619883040936
