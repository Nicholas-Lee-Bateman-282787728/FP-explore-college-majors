7872631,4,6304449461,"This movie consists of parts of 14 B-Movies put together to make one movie with no plot whatsoever. While this sounds like it would be boring, BMB actually succeeds in creating an amusing experience for all who watch it.  Don't try to figure out a plot, just go with it. Make sure you watch it  with friends, because it will be much funnier that way. A great movie to  show at parties.",959990400,4,385,4.319444444444445
7872632,1,6304449461,"""Poorly selected clips from great B-movies, tied together by a 'half-hearted' effort.""  That would sum up my disappointment after renting this movie.  It even seemed to suffer from a dire lack of copious,  quality, gratuitous bimbos.  My advice would be to pass on it and rent/buy  some of the featured movies.",951782400,,310,5.0
7872633,2,6304449461,"Based off of the CD ROM that you can get under the same name, this movie is a compilation of various other b movies.  Basically from the 'Bimbo' movie series from Surrender Cinema.
I loved some of the movies that  have scenes in it, Cannibal Women In The Avacado Jungle Of Death, and Slave  Girls From Beyond Infinity to name a couple.  But this tape is really some  silly attempt to throw in a bunch of the funniest scenes from these movies  to try and get some new storyline.  It fails miserably.  But it is funny in  some parts.  I haven't got the CD ROM yet, but it is on order.  It will be  interesting to see how different it is.  A good piece to collect if not  just for interests sake.",912384000,4,693,4.151515151515151
