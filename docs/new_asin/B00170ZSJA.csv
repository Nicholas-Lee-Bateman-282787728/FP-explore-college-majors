8264519,5,B00170ZSJA,"This video is an introduction to Henry Shaw, an English businessman who was drawn to frontier Saint Louis, who sold hardware (ironworks) to westbound settlers, who made a fortune early in life, and who decided he had sufficient wealth to spend the rest of his life indulging his passion for botany and formal gardens. The video concentrates on Henry Shaw's legacy: the scientific but beautiful Missouri Botanical Garden; the adjacent Tower Grove Park; and the adjacent residentially-affordable Shaw Neighborhood. Saint Louisians consider these institutions just another part of Saint Louis Missouri's landscape, but Saint Louisians forget that elsewhere people pay premium prices (e.g., around NYC's Central Park) to live within a green environment. The video highlights Henry Shaw's 21st Century legacy: a scientifically-significant botanical research institution bundled within a beautiful green environment.
