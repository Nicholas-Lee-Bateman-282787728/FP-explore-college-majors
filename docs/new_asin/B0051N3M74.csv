8452927,3,B0051N3M74,"With Manhattan Melodrama, MGM set out to show that anything Warner Bros. could do, they could do better - or at least bigger. It's that favorite old chestnut the two boyhood friends, one who follows the law, the other a life of crime, with twice-orphaned (in the space of only the opening reel!) Mickey Rooney and Jimmy Butler growing into Clark Gable's illegal gambling den proprietor and William Powell's District attorney, with Myrna Loy transferring her affections from one to the other until the inevitable moment when Powell finds himself prosecuting Gable for murder and demanding the death penalty... Even in 1934 the plot was hokey, but MGM throw everything they have at it in a lavish production that kicks off with a convincingly chaotic recreation of the catastrophic 1904 fire on the pleasure boat General Slocum and just keeps on throwing money at the screen, for the most part pretty effectively. While it's not on the level of Warners' later Angels with Dirty Faces, with which it shares two protagonists whose friendship endures all the way to Death Row, it is an entertaining enough hour-and-a-half even if it's not worth getting yourself shot to death by the FBI on the way out of the movie theater, as famously happened to John Dillinger, giving the MGM publicity department decades of free publicity in the process. On a happier note, after the film came out Lorenz Hart had the idea of writing new lyrics for the song heard in the Cotton Club sequence, The Bad in Every Man, giving us the classic Blue Moon, so it wasn't all bad news.

The Spanish PAL DVD release is pretty perfunctory, so you're better off getting this as part of the US Myrna Loy & William Powell Collection from Warner Home Video, which offers a good transfer with the original trailer, a Pete Smith short and a funnier than the norm Harman-Ising cartoon The Old Pioneer (look out for the NRA symbol on a tepee). And, of course, that collection comes with an additional four of William Powell and Myrna Loy's non-Thin Man pairings.",1454630400,,2023,4.78
