My favourite scenes are with Eagle and Eric, they remind me of Benny Hill's old sketch of a really badly made film. Eric's voiceover is terrible but ""Bill Brown"" the Asian steals the biscuit, he sounds like a mash up between Beavis and Butthead.
At the start of the film it says were in Hong Kong but you can see a sign saying ""Bangkok"". The Ninja girl seems to moonlight as a model or something and she strips off a bit but the whole film reminded me a lot of the aforementioned Benny Hill. Toward the end the Ninja girl was looking like Wonderwoman.
The fight scenes are cr*p and Richard Harrison is only in the opening credits, he would have brought some class to the rest of it.
As I have said before Godfrey Ho's Ninja rubbish is better than anything Hollywood has produced in the last 20 years so I would highly recommend this and really any other of Ho's films. Sure I'm getting 7 in the post during the week so I have hours of entertainment ahead of me!
Another bad goodie!!!",1400976000,,1118,4.354066985645933

the best part about this movie is how a good chunk of it is sped up so it looks like a terrible benny hill sketch.  and you already know the voice work will be hilarious.

oh, i almost forgot.  be prepared for rape.  lots and lots of rape.  and full female nudity.  i have ZERO idea who their intended audience was, it seems to be incredibly childish at times... geared towards 11 year old boys... and then the rape starts... and then fighting... and then sex... and then fighting... and then more sex... and then sex... and back to fighting... and then the movie ends.

it's kind of hard to swallow.  if this was rated by the MPAA i'd guess it'd get an NC-17 rating.",1319068800,,818,4.472972972972973
