3133938,5,B0014NGNJO,"Join Us is superb documentary examining the slow, inch-by-inch indoctrination process of religious leaders obtaining total control over followers' emotional, intellectual and economic sovereignty.

Religion may preach love, but when members feel petrified, worthless and helpless, that's not love but destruction of one's humanity.  The classic sign of totalitarianism, regardless if via religion or politics, is authoritarian shaming and crushing of intellectual, emotional and moral examination.

Most striking is the impact of fundamentalist belief and behavior on the children, filling them with explosive and/or stuffed rage, disassociation with love and unending sorrow.

Absolute must-see film.",1394150400,5,701,6.347368421052631
3133939,3,B0014NGNJO,"I don't trust this movie.  I think it's contrived.  I'm anti-religious and want to learn about cults, but I just didn't believe most of the exagerations in this movie.  Yes, maybe some of the kids were spanked--but I think this becomes wildly exagerated.  I believe that the cult leader put the kids' hands on the hot stove to show them what hell feels like--but just how hot was it?, and if it really did burn their hands, where are the burn marks?  The kids all seem totally happy and un-abused to me.  Also, why is there no background about the cult leader (his earlier life in upstate NY, etc.)?  All we see or hear from are these few people in this little compound of a church and a few nearby houses.  Also, is that the extent of his cult (just these few people)?  How many people fill up his church?  Also, the part at the end where the one family moves to Montana ""to get as far away as possible"" from cults but end up right next door to a big cult compound is unbelievable (the Montana cult members even come around knocking, trying to be friends with the new neighbors).  I think much of this movie is made up to be entertaining or to fit into a nice story.  I also wondered about the cult leader's wife.  The cult leader is from Austria and has an accent.  I kept trying to figure out where the wife is from.  She seemed to have a very slight accent, and I kept wondering if that was just from being around her husband (his accent was captivating).  This husband-wife were smart and charming, and I felt at the end that maybe they really cared about and helped these people.  The funniest thing was the spontaneous little boy who kept blurting out the funniest things.  I also liked the sub-plot of no lawyer or prosecutor wanting to touch this thing.",1290902400,2,1762,4.352760736196319

8256094,4,B0014NGNJO,"A very interesting documentary about a small cult. Lots of interesting information such as the fact that the U.S. has the most cults anywhere, cults are usually small and people do not all live together like a commune. My advice after watching this and documentaries about scientology is this: raise your children to be critical thinkers and not so trusting. Raise them to believe in facts and science.",1483315200,3,402,4.926470588235294
8256095,5,B0014NGNJO,"Join Us is a sad but true portrayal of life inside a fundamentalist, religious cult. As a cult survivor, I could identify with the struggles and confusion faced by the families in this documentary. I thought the filmmaker did an awesome job trying to show exactly why people can follow someone who is delusional and the fear they face regarding eternal punishment for daring to question and think for themselves. l highly recommend this documentary to anyone wishing to learn more regarding authoritarian environments, and to cult survivors, who will find much with which to identify.",1477872000,,584,5.09375
8256096,4,B0014NGNJO,"Having survived a small, abusive, ""bible-based"" church, this documentary was fascinating to me, a bit triggering, and responsibly created.  Highly recommended for survivors of abuse churches and their families and friends. The cover of the DVD makes the pastor look particularly creepy (old school jacket and tie, black and white photo, large image, etc.), and he kind of is that...but it isn't a ""scary movie,"" but a great account of a group of families negotiating the rough waters of leaving an abusive Christian church.",1476403200,,523,5.226190476190476

8256099,5,B0014NGNJO,"Over the years I've seen a number of documentaries critical of religion, but never one that delved so deeply, so intimately, into the lives of those who have suffered mightily at the hands of a spiritual leader who is nothing more than a charlatan.  Either by design, or deluded certainty, this leader crushes the life and spirit of those who accept his every word.

One's heart goes out to the victims; sick with the idea they may lose the love of their God  mentally tortured by the fear that falling away from their spiritual leader means they are possessed by demons or the devil.  Their fear is palpable in almost every scene.

This is a powerful film about fragile people, overwhelmed with a desire to be good, and desperately seeking redemption for their supposed sins.  Slowly (grudgingly for some) they come to realize it was their credulity that led them into this nightmare situation.  Highly recommended.",1432080000,2,916,4.833333333333333

8256101,5,B0014NGNJO,"This was a very informative movie - I watched this because of the recent release of ""Going Clear"".  We don't have cable so I was watching a lot of You Tube videos on Scientology.  I ran across this movie and it was good.  It's not about Scientology but it is about how people can get sucked into religion and the difficulties trying to get out of it and trying to get the thoughts out of your head.  I wanted to watch this just for the simple fact I can't wrap my head around how this happens.  Overall, a good movie!",1430438400,,517,4.13
8256102,5,B0014NGNJO,"This is an important documentary and very well done in terms of the objectivity and honesty of the producer/director. What is interesting is that it is a small group of people, rather than the usual gigantic groups often profiled, that are duped by a cult/religion and therefore the viewer is privy to the personal lives and conversations between the church members. The movie does an excellent job in showing the difficulty of individuals when separating from an a preacher in whom they had put all of their trust and the awful moment when the lightbulb goes off and an individual realizes he or she has been conned. The film  holds steady in objectivity even when showing that it was the parents themselves who allowed the horrific physical abuse of their children to occur even if they do claim they were under the preacher's ""spell'. It is an honest film, one that leaves you with questions as to what constitutes brain washing and mind control, especially when one of the mothers who has escaped the mad man's grip says she still hits her kids - just not as hard.",1429574400,,1068,4.680851063829787
