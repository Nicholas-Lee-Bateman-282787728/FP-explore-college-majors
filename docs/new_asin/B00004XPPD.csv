1370437,3,B00004XPPD,"I like this film, fell in love with their camaraderie, their celebration for ballet, and being young, talented, beautiful, and in New York City.  They are elite; they should have passion, and though they have qualified American Ballet Academy, not all of them love ballet.

You get Jodi Sawyer/Amanda Schull, who only wants to dance.  Her passion is extreme though she isn't great.  She has bad feet, an absolute failure in class, requires extra instruction and attention, and the other instructors openly wonder how she was she let in.  She was the best in her class, but she was never technically on par, but her passion is beyond extreme.  She practices extra, until her feet bleed.

Then there is her roommate, a very young Zoe Saldana/Eva Rodriguez, who is a rebel from the start.  She scorns her admittance, shuns her love, and she is only too willing to talk back.  She is an extremely good, talented dancer, who puts the other students to shame.  But she is protective of Jodi, and does all to hide her love of ballet.

The final character is Maureen Cummings/Susan May Pratt, whose mother works as a secretary for the company, and she is passionate about ballet.  Only her daughter is not.  Maureen is technically perfect, but she has no love for ballet.  She suffers along, because of her mother, and discovering a different life was a highlight for me.  As she told her mother, ""You didn't have the feet.  I didn't have the heart.""

There is love, but I felt bad, because though Sascha Radetsky/Charlie Sims is extremely talented, he was relegated to a love interest though his actual talent is extreme.

I actually confused the gorgeous Anna/Megan Pepin with Jodi  Sayers.  Anna was a technically better dancer, who had all the love of the company, and though her blondness caused for some confusion, she was relegated to a secondary role.

I love the film.  Though I knew that Amanda Schull/Jodi Sawyer was a mediocre dancer.  She didn't stun me.  She was supposed to be professional but she required clever edits to make her look competent in this film.  The pirouettes at the end of her dance were expertly done, but there was her face, but I am not sure it was her feet.  I am  not saying she could not be fashionable and precise, but I had no doubt that every other dancer featured was better than her.  I did like her.  She had an earnestness and charisma, and I understood why Ethan Stiefel/Cooper Nielson loved her.  But NONE of her dancing impressed me.  Especially at the end.  Which was cheesy and corny, and almost unbearable to watch.

I did like this film.  All the villains and characters came to the right decision.  There was some good dancing featured.  But it was only Zoe Saldana/Eva Rodriguez, who showed some complexity and skill.  And I write this though I liked Amanda Schull.

There is energy in this film.  There is immense entertainment.  I didn't know Julie Kent/Donahue was a professional dancer even, but her scenes were immaculate.  Love the Swan Lake scenes, and even the depreciated scenes.",1439251200,,3035,4.726577437858508

I own it and I also have it on my DVR so I can watch it at any time without running my DVD player into the ground or ruining my copy of the movie.  My husband hates when I watch it because he can hear the music in the living room when I watch it in the bedroom....which is very often recently.  It was my first movie seeing Zoe Saldana and Susan May Pratt.  While Zoe Saldana seems to be everywhere right now, how simple was her start and now no one really knows how well she can dance (ballet).  Now its all action movies.  Columbiana is the only one close to showing how graceful she really is physically.",1432944000,,678,4.052631578947368

I have watched Center Stage several time and love the movie. Lots of thought was given to the scripting, the choreography and the talent. Too bad the extended version had this problem.

1370510,5,B00004XPPD,"you will love this one.

let's face it, you watch a movie like this because you love to watch beautiful people moving in beautiful ways.  Also you might be like me and have misplaced dreams of wishing you were a dancer.  I never stuck with it, my parents didn't make me practice and they let me off the hook too easily when I didn't want to keep pushing to do it.  You never get to the reward if you don't push through that phase.  Oh well....

the story in this movie is excellently done and it's never stupid or unbelievable.  I've got enough dance background to know that they did their research when filming it.  Also one of the male leads, Ethan Steifel, is a professional ballet dancer and you can really tell.  His dancing is phenomenal.

Character tensions are developed nicely without making you hate the bad girl.... issues like eating disorders, bloody toes from pointe shoes, frustration and sexual chemistry are present but not made into a soapbox.  You'll really be rooting for them all at the end....

My favorite part is the jazz class the ingenue character takes midway through the movie.  The class is shown doing a warmup routine and then a dance routine that is actually very stimulating to watch and makes you feel really good.  I have to admit I actually put this DVD in every morning and skip to that scene so I can use the warmup to help stretch myself out before I begin my day.  I have a better day emotionally as well as physically when I do this.  =)

I can't believe how old this movie is, or that I only just discovered it.  It's great though..... you'll love it if you love dance!",1397347200,,1611,4.421768707482993

1370531,5,B00004XPPD,"In some ways, this is a ""grade B"" movie, with a predictable story and, for the most part, blandly attractive actors.  However, for anyone who likes ballet,a Center Stage is a real treat, as there is wonderful dance in this movie from beginning to end.  In some regards, the entire story is told through dancing.
The plot follows a group of mostly 18-year-olds newly admitted to a ballet school that's clearly modeled on the School of American Ballet, the institution created by George Balanchine, and which is affiliated with the New York City Ballet.  The characters are mainly stock characters, so you have the pretty one, the ambitious one, the gay, the straight, the rebellious one, and so on.  But from the very beginning, you are plunged into the world of the dancer.  The movie opens with auditions for new students, and many of its scenes portray ballet class, including barre work, stretches, and floor work, as well as teaching of parts and creation of new choreography.  There is a lot of drama here, but Center Stage avoids the superheated fantasy of Black Swan, and also avoids the trivial personal stuff in Turning Point.  The entire and genuine focus of the film is on the dancing, and it presents a real and realistic look at the sorts of pressure that dancers and dance students face every day in service to their art.  Many of the actors and extras in the movie are actually ballet dancers, and their presence contributes greatly to Center Stage.  Among the lead actors, Donna Murphy, who had a long career as a dancer in Broadway shows, is outstanding as the very demanding ballet mistress.  Ethan Stiefel, one of the male leads, is a well-known dancer of the first rank.  Aside from the many scenes of class, practice, and workout, the film contains some significant choreography.  These include the Four Cygnets dance from Swan Lake, the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet, and an excerpt from Balanchine's Stars and Stripes.  The film includes a complete, original ballet choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon.  Interestingly enough, the director is so sensitive to dance that he presents the entire Wheeldon work, over ten minutes, straight through, with almost no reaction shots or quick cuts.
Although you can watch Center Stage via streaming video services, I would like to recommend purchase of the ""special edition"" DVD (or Blu-ray) for its special features.  These include a director's commentary, wherein the director (Nicholas Hytner) explains why he chose to film ballet and how he did so; extended movements from the Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev and Sousa ballets, and a couple of extra scenes, including one with a rehearsal of Stars and Stripes.
In short, a fine movie for anyone who loves ballet.",1364860800,,2727,4.949561403508772

The acting is not Oscar worthy, the premise and storyline have been done over and over in different settings, but that is okay, I still enjoyed this movie.  I found it on Amazon Prime and have watched it several times (some dropouts and pixelation, but then my DSL is not the fastest) and then looked to see if there was a Blu-ray version of it.  Apparently not.  May have to buy the DVD version of it.  Amanda Schull's, Donna Murphy's, and Zoe Saldana's parts were good and I enjoyed them.  The dance scenes were quite enjoyable also.  I especially enjoyed Amanda's and Zoe's dance routines.  Basically, this movie is just a bit of fluff.  It has some talented dancers, who are not necessarily actors, acting the parts of dancers, but their parts are passable.

1370537,3,B00004XPPD,"Center Stage is about a young woman named Jodi who has lofty goals of becoming a big time ballerina.  When she's accepted into a prestigious ballet school, she's well on her way to making it.  She's not about to let her clumsy feet get in the way of her high aspirations.

  The powers that be aren't all too impressed at first.  But then she meets danseur extraordinaire Cooper who teaches her about dancing and love and, eventually, heartbreak.  Will it be enough to turn this awkward duckling into a brilliant swan?

  I know that Center Stage may not be an example of cinematic genius.  But darn it all, it does have a plot.  And the plot is coherent.  And the actors are at least somewhat good looking.  And there's hot music and great dancing.  And really, what more can you ask for from a movie of its kind.  What more, I say?!!!?",1325548800,,837,4.407894736842105

1370539,4,B00004XPPD,"I love this movie, really, basic formula plotline and all.  The stories of the 3 main girls are typical of what you see in movies and TV shows aimed at younger audiences, but so what?  The dancing is so phenominally good that you just don't mind some of the less-than-brilliant acting by a cast that's mostly all professional dancers.  With the exceptions of Zoe Saldana who plays Eve, by far and away the most interesting character in the film, Susan May Pratt who unfortunately  got the worst and most intolerable role as the anorexic dancer who was badgered constantly by a worse character in her mother, and Peter Gallagher, the acting was so-so for the rest with the exception of former New York City Ballet's Ethan Stiefel who actually shows potential.

As for Stiefel--cocky dancing/coreographing stud muffin Cooper Nielsen--you can't take your eyes off him for a moment in any dancing sequences, because he is truly one amazing and gifted dancer.  Wow, talk about self-discipline and outstanding physical form!  Also of note are Amanda Schull, who plays pretty girl-next-door Jodi Sawyer in a grow-up-fast role as she is torn between Cooper and sweet Charlie--Sasha Radetsky, who is also among the best of the main casted dancers.  Where this movie falls flat in plotline is made up for in spades by the dancing sequences and the depicted reality of the cut-throat world of ballet.  There is also salsa dancing fueled by the music of Elvis Crespo, some high energy rock-jazz, and a sizzlingly hot finale which combines all the above elements into Cooper's program that is based obviously on his rivalry with Johnathan (Gallagher) over his former girlfriend.

What spoiled this movie for me somewhat was listening to Nicholas Hytner's drab, largely removed commentary of his own project.  It went something like this:  ""I'm from the theater, know nothing about ballet, but love it so I made this movie...Um...er...(big looooong pause)We had to stretch the truth here a bit, because that probably wouldn't really happen in real life, but this is only a movie...I'm from the theater...er...um...That's not really Zoe and Ilia dancing Swan Lake...um...This is just a film.""  Yeah, that's exactly it.  He seldom discusses the plot...er...um, well, maybe once.  It's pretty obvious he just wanted to work with ballet dancers, and kept referring to them as ""natural"" actors:  in literal translation, he had to work with what he had.  It's sad to see this man think so little of his own work, and it was disappointing to hear him say so indirectly and with such transparency.  My advice is to skip the audio commentary and just enjoy the movie itself.  The other extras, the featurette in particular, are not so hot outside of the Stars and Stripes extended dance scene.  Hytner didn't totally spoil things for me, so I am warning you ahead of time; if you buy this version, just ignore the commentary lest YOUR bubble be burst.  This is a good dance movie and great fun, so take it in that aspect.",1317513600,,2998,4.897029702970297

1370541,5,B00004XPPD,"Having lived in Honolulu at the time of Amanda Schull's birth there in 1978, I can recall what I was doing at that particular time and even specifically on the day she was born: I was saying ""Goodbye"" to my grandmother and three aunts at the Honolulu International Airport that Saturday, after they had come for a visit that lasted a few weeks. They had been unable to stay for my 9th birthday, which was the following day.
 Given my penchant for paying attention to babies, I realize the possibility that I may have even encountered her as an infant, when I recall a sleeping little one I saw in shopping cart in a store with her mother close at hand.
 Well, whether I did encounter her or not, it was a pleasure to witness the onscreen debut of this ""Honolulu Baby"" as Jody Sawyer in this film about ballet dancers competing for places in New York's fictional American Ballet Association.
 Her parents(Stephen Stout, Maryann Plunkett) help her settle in, and she meets her new roomates, the salty-tounged and streetwise rougue, Eva Rodriguez(Zoe Saldana), and the pale, staid, and very focused Maureen Cummings(Susan May Pratt),the star pupil, whose overbearing stage mother, Nancy(Debra Monk), has an executive position with the company.
  The most influential instructors there are Jonathan(Peter Gallagher), and Juliette Simone( Donna Murphy). From her classmates, who also include Anna(Megan Pepin), and Victoria Born's Emily(whose healthy appetite will ultimately be to her detriment as a dancer), Jody learns about the love triangle between Jonathan, his new wife, Kathleen Donahue(Julie Kent) and the Ballet's young choregrapher, Cooper Nielsen (Ethan Stiefel), of whose affections Jody will have to try to stay wary.
 On a gala night after Cooper and Kathleen dance the lead roles in ""Romeo and Juliet"". The students hawk expensive memorabilia carried in baskets at the after party. A few of them, including, Anna, Emily, Jody, Charlie(Sasha Radetsky), and Erik Jones(Shakiem Evans)and Sergei(1998 Olympic Figure Skating Gold Medalist Ilia Kulik), overhear a quarrel between Cooper and Kathleen in the seating area of the otherwise empty auditorium as the former lovers walked in while the students were scouting out the stage on which they will perform.
 --A glimpse of the drama of which they will soon become a part.
  That night, Maureen has an encounter with a medical student named Jim Gordon(Elon Bailey), who works as a caterer at the event, which will also change her life for the better.
  We observe the students' routines and rehearsals, and those familiar with classical music will recognize the works of Albeniz, Delibes, Tchaikovsky, and Adam.
 But there are livlier moments when Jody and the gang spend a night on the town dancing Salsa, having too much to drink, and paying for it the next day. Even as they pay the penalties for being out of bounds, they have fun, and Maureen becomes painfully aware of how her rarified circumstances exclude her from the mainstream as she sneaks a peak at them.
  The rigors of dance make Jody concerned about her ""turn-out""-- the positioning of her feet, as well as her body type. This film does not shrink from the issue of eating disorders among the dancers,which are visible among Maureen, Kathleen, as well as Eva.
  The ballet gains a new patron named Joan Miller(Elizabeth Hubbard), who will witness the love triangle that develops between Jody and two other dancers.
 In the meantime, when Cooper and Jody attend a class at the Broadway Dance School(Jody doing so against ABA policy), we enjoy a rousing performance to Stevie Wonder's ""Higher Ground"" under the guidance of Cooper's friend Jazz Teacher, Priscilla Lopez.
  Invited to star in Cooper's new company, Jody thrives amid personal problems with Cooper himself.
  In the finale, the students perform in the workshop in which classical music gives way to pop music, led by Michael Jackson's ""The Way You Make Me Feel"", which puts the audience more at ease, and tells a great story which those involved have already lived, amid some spectacular dance moves.
  The dynamics among the students shift, ambitions change,some dreams are fulfilled, some hearts are broken, and well, that's showbiz, kids!
  In the meantime, I've had the satisfaction of watching a very talented ""Saturday's Child"" work hard for a living, and do a great job!",1304640000,,4361,5.057262569832402
1370542,5,B00004XPPD,"I don't know if anyone will actually read this considering how old the film is, but this was such a great movie that I wanted to encourage anyone else who happens to come upon it.

I'm not really a fan of ballet... the only reason I found this movie in the first place is because I was looking up Mandy Moore videos and saw her 'I Wanna Be With You' song was featured for Center Stage, and after reading some other reviews, I thought I'd give it a shot.  I'm always up for inspirational movies with a good ending (which, without spoiling anything, this movie has a great ending).  If you're not into ballet, if you're totally disgusted by it, think it's a sissy's activity, then you probably won't like this movie at all.  But if you don't really mind it and you're open to it, and you want a good story with a happy ending, then I recommend this.

Center Stage is a pretty standard story - children enrolling in a school geared toward a specific talent, and only a handful will actually be able to succeed in the end.  While the story is mostly about the three main girls, I was interested in the stories and contributions of everyone as it went on.  I expected in a school mixed with new and veteran, intermediate and pro dancers competing for spots that there would be cliques, bullying, petty fights - lots of annoying, spiteful drama - but thankfully there was really none of that in the film.

I think what I loved most about Center Stage was the way the characters change or the way you see them differently as it goes on.  Within the first half hour, you'll probably think you know exactly what each one of them will do, and if you're like me, you might end up disliking most of them.  But you'll be very surprised by the end when you actually wind up liking and cheering for all of them.

The acting was pretty good and enjoyable.  Most of it was realistic, nothing quite too over the top or unbelievable.  A character might take a totally different shift, but it's actually nice to see them growing up.  There's some romance in the story, not too much that it overshadows everything else, but enough.

So the ballet... like I said, I'm not a ballet fan, I was not particularly interested in a couple of the scenes, but you have to give credit where it's due.  Watching the dancers, as someone who does not do ballet, was  awe inspiring for me at times.  The dedication and grace of ballet itself, and not knowing if the scene was going to be end up being about a success or a flop for one of the characters (obviously it's not a real live performance, but you still never really know where the scene/story is going until it's over) made it very interesting to watch.

My only comment about the packaging itself is that the current picture on Amazon shows it in a box with a pink border.  Mine does not have that, just the same picture of the characters without any border, with a silver trim on top that says Special Edition, and a black case.  Just putting that out there for anyone who didn't want a pink case on their shelves (although I can't guarantee there isn't another version that does have a pink case).

In terms of extras, there were a couple of deleted scenes, a couple of extended dance scenes, some commentaries, and couple of other extras I didn't really care about, and the 'I Wanna Be With You' music video.

Like I said before, if you want an inspirational movie of kids trying to find their place in the world, who grow up and make their own decisions and find out they can enjoy life, and you don't hate ballet, I would definitely recommend Center Stage.",1294272000,,3585,4.398484848484848
1370543,5,B00004XPPD,"I was moved to purchase this DVD after having seen the film on cable t.v.  The dancers are excellent, as is the storyline (particularly where we see a dancer struggling to keep her weight down in order to be ballet perfect...even to the point of forcing herself to throw up).  Not everyone has a happy ending in this film, but then again, life isn't always tied up into one neat little package for everyone.  Some of the dance movies I've seen before have been great, but all too often, the ending is the same:  the hero(ine) of the story dances his or her way into the judges' hearts and gets the girl (or guy), to say nothing of that coveted role.  ""Center Stage"" showed us that sometimes, life DOESN'T happen that way for us, no matter how good we are.",1278892800,,755,4.364285714285714

1370545,3,B00004XPPD,"Really...I'm the first review?

Dance movies were kind of all over the place the place this decade.  Some were bad, some were good, some were awful, some were great and then some were cheesy fun with no real redeeming value.  `Center Stage' is probably in that category.  It is fun, albeit pointless, but when all is said and done you won't be kicking yourself for having watched it.

`Center Stage' pretty much regurgitates the same formula we see in many films within this genre.  This time we are spending time in at a ballet school (The American Ballet Company) where students attempt to achieve greatness.  The main student we are focusing our attention on is Jody Sawyer.  She is the typical girl next door who wants to be a ballet dancer but possesses a funky edge that is better suited for jazz.  Still, she has drive and potential.

Clich&eacute;s abound.

The films dance sequences (especially towards the finale) are what save this film from being a total failure.  Some of the acting is spirited (and this did help spawn the career of Zoe Saldana, so I'm grateful for that) but overall this is not an `actors' film.  This is a dancers film, and those dancers (most of the cast had training or were dancers before actors) shine brightly in the numbers they are given to perform.  The final dance numbers are provocative and engaging.

The film, outside of the dancing, is a clich&eacute; ridden mess, but at least it has some spunk.  You are engaged, even if you have seen it all before and know exactly what is going to happen (why do most teenage dramas follow such a `paint-by-numbers' formula?).  You have the overbearing stage mom, the girl who doesn't really want to be there, the one who doesn't quite stack up, the questionable love interest, the arrogant showoff, the demanding instructor...the list goes on and on.

Still, it is fun while it lasts.",1270080000,,1869,4.6984615384615385

If you are like me, you will enjoy this movie too, however it will leave you wondering if it really delivers on the fancy footwork, or is it just camera tricks?

1370551,5,B00004XPPD,"I remember when this movie came out no one would go to see it with me, and I spent hours begging all my friends to come.  The problem was that none of them wanted to see a movie with Peter Gallagher.  I even advertised on line for a date, and got not one reply.

Well, I went to see it at the bargain matinee at the SONY Metreon here in San Francisco, and even on a small screen I was captivated.  The story is filled with cliches, but they're my cliches!  They're actually the cliches of every 20th Century Fox movie from the 1920s onward that focuses on three girls in the big city, from How to Marry a Millionaire through The Best of Everything and even Valley of the Dolls.  Often, in this formula, there's a fourth girl who doesn't exactly fit in with the others in some way--really it's a three and a half girl movie formula.  Like in Valley of the Dolls you have Helen Lawson.  Often the fourth girl is more tragic than the others, attempts suicide or something.  This happens in Where the Boys Are for example.  Well, in CENTER STAGE the three girls are Jody, the blonde heroine; Eva, the black middle class girl who's always smoking a cigarette (my wife says that Zoe Saldana relies entirely on cigarettes to perform her idea of characterization) and Maureen, the perfect dancer who is the victim of an emotionally abusive stage mother (Debra Monk).  The fourth girl, Emily, is too small a part really to count, but she's the chubby one.

The men are a mixed bag but Ethan Stiefel dances beautifully.  He is no Baryshnikov in looks however, and that hairdo is a mistake gone wild!  (Even Baryshnikov couldn't have carried off that haircut.)  He's a good actor and has lots of sparks with Amanda Schull.

The whole movie belongs really to Donna Murphy, the Broadway diva who is playing the former ballerina Juliet here, the woman who develops a bond of quality assurance with Eva.  They despise each other, admire each other, and finally, they come to love each other as surrogate mother and daughter.  She gives CENTER STAGE whatever class it has, and you needed that one bit of seasoning to make the whole soup palatable.",1250035200,,2131,4.51958224543081

Most dance movies these days have some ridiculous plot about some person who ""broke all the rules"" with his/her love of dance and brought the people together.  These plots are a bit clich, but Center Stage has a real plot, about a group of new students at a highly selective ballet school.
These students then encounter average problems, like drinking and pushing back against authority.  Their problem are believable, even when it comes to Maureen's bulimia.  I always felt like this story could have actually happened in real life, and I like that.  I always enjoy a dance movie, but many try to push an agenda and are a bit overdramatic.
In addition, the dancing is entertaining and very good.  The actors are actually ballet dancers.

1370575,4,B00004XPPD,"Center Stage is one of the more pure dance movies of the 1990s with almost no known stars and real-life ballet performances.  The only recognizable star is Peter Gallagher (the snoozer in While You Were Sleeping) as instructor Jonathan Reeves.

In fact, the casting director went more for the ""teach dancers how to act"" rather than ""teach actors how to dance"" which has both positive and negative outcomes.  On the positive side, the ballet dancing is authentic and real while some scenes requiring the actors to express anger and frustration are lacking in depth and honesty.

The lead female, Jody Sawyer (played by Amanda Schull), is probably the actress with the best blend of dancing and acting in the film besides some of the ballet instructors as well.  Actor Peter Gallagher, mentioned earlier, has the ""jerk in disguise"" thing down and Donna Murphy (playing ballet instructor ""Juliette"") is probably the most believable in her role and fun to watch.

The formulaic plot involves a group of about a dozen teenagers from all walks of life (yes, much like the movie ""Fame"") who enroll at the American Ballet Academy in New York to try and eventually become professional ballet dancers.  Of course each dancer must deal with the rigorous training and competition in the intense ballet world.  Of course, the dance world includes the audition ups and downs, as well as a love triangle that's kinda fun.

One credit I do give the fimmakers is the fact that a realistic and competitive ballet environment was created.  Ballet dancer movie-goers will be able to identify their own experiences, friends, and enemies in this film.  The soundtrack is excellent with many songs from Mandy Moore as she began reaching her early peak as a new pop aritst (songs include, ""I Wanna Be With You,"" & ""Candy"").  There is even a Mandy Moore music video bonus in the special features version.

If you can stand some ""rotten tomato acting"" (Susan May Pratt as ""Maureen""...she was also featured in ""10 Things I Hate About You"" and didn't do much better) with some great ballet dancing you'll like this movie.  Keep in mind, there are more dance forms than just ballet...some scenes include jazz/pop and salsa.  The two lead males (Ethan Stiefel as cocky professional ""Cooper"" & Sascha Radetsky as humble confidante ""Charlie"") are a lot of fun to watch together portraying both sides of the romantic triangle with ""Jody.""  Sascha Radetsky is also featured as the dancing hottie in the Mandy Moore bonus music video.

There is some strong language and references to sexuality (gay and straight), but it isn't in too poor of taste.  Late in the movie, there is a dance love-making scene which will probably land this movie in the ""Dance Movie Hall of Fame.""  (Just a warning for those with kids under 13)  The closing scene involving the ""where they ended up"" notes is fun because it has a surprising and realistic ending.

Grab some popcorn....and enjoy this pretty good dance movie.",1167868800,,2966,4.880239520958084
1370576,3,B00004XPPD,"`Center Stage' is above all else generic.  It's very much like every other teen comedy / dance movie but it does have a few things going for it.  The script is decent and actually has some pretty good sub-plots that draw you into the characters.  The dancing sequences are a nice touch too and are orchestrated in such a way that it is above all else captivating.  And, while the majority of the cast are unknowns (which in itself serves as a con) they all seem talented and deliver their lines with confidence and maturity (especially Zoe Saldana and Susan May Pratt, both of which are common in these teen films as the sidekick or best friend to the star).  The story of a Jody (Schull) trying to make it as a ballerina but is failing miserably but after becoming the muse of the arrogant ex-student turned professional dancer (Stiefel) she finds hope to be a professional herself.  The school is full of other talented dancer with problems of their own.  There's the bulimic (Pratt) who is dancing solely for her mother, and there's the gifted yet misunderstood student (Saldana) who's just looking for a fair shot.

We have many issues, such as watching our weight (mainly women), the attitude from the teachers toward the students. There're the constant love triangles between dancers, and ironically, Ethan portrayed a dancer perfectly because many dancers sleep around.

The dancing? BEAUTIFUL. Absolutely, beautiful. Musicality, technical movement (did anyone else see that gorgeous double tour into a double pirouette into two double tours?), with a simple yet true plot.

I myself, haven't seen anyone act like Eva. Perhaps, it's because I've only been dancing for 2 years now -- but, after dancing in the Joffrey Ballet School, I'm still kind of confused why she has an attitude like that?

1370591,4,B00004XPPD,"If you are thinking about watching ""Center Stage"", you should first read the plot summary and view the trailer. If neither impresses, you would be wise to give ""Center Stage"" a wide berth because they are very accurate representations of the film. The story is fairly simple, the focus is on three girls who aspire to a position with the fictional American Ballet Center in New York City. Well, they sort of aspire. The bulimic one (Maureen) is only doing it because her mother is pushing her, the girl next door one (Jody) is wondering if the company is too restrictive, and the angry one (Eva) is considering getting work as a Hooters waitress instead. Eva's seemingly bad attitude disguises the fact that she actually has the best attitude, she is there because she loves to dance.

There is a love triangle between Jody and two guys, she sleeps with the one she loves (Cooper), he does not love her but he gives her the female lead in a ballet he has choreographed. He gives the male lead to the guy who loves her. Coincidentally Cooper's ballet is about a similar love triangle.

This is not exactly new territory, think ""Flashdance"", ""Fame"", and ""Brave New Girl"". Don't expect Fellini's ""Variety Lights"". The plot is painfully contrived but the saving grace is the wonderful dancing and the realistic portrayal of the grind of dance school. The DVD has a ton of nice special features including extended dance sequences.

The acting is nonprofessional but the director knows the limitations of his ensemble and does not ask them to do anything very difficult, at least acting-wise. The movie is full of mild melodrama, but stays nicely real life and doesn't amp the conflicts and love stories into an overwrought mess.

The theme is the standard one about going after your dream through hard work and dedication, but they also focus on the necessity of first making sure that it is actually your dream. Bottom line: ""Center Stage"" is a joyful celebration of dance and the talented folks who make it their profession.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1133136000,,2068,4.749303621169917
1370592,5,B00004XPPD,"by Macey Rogers.

The plot of Center Stage is that a girl named Jody Sawyer, who lives in a small town, tries out for the American Ballet Company. After Jody gets hired, she moves in with two roommates, named Eva and Maureen. They all become really good friends with three other guys that stay in the same building: Eric, Sergei, and Charlie. During all this Maureen finds herself in a position where she decides the rest of her life and stops dancing.

The main reason why I picked this movie is because I related to them learning dances and for the most part dancing. One of the scenes during the movie shows them in class choreographing a part and they repeat it over and over to make sure it's correct. This movie is truly about people who love to dance and what they go through on a day-to-day basis. When I first watched this movie I felt a connection when they performed certain choreographs. During one scene we see dancers fixing their shoes and warming

up before class. This shows how much effort dancers really put into each particular step.

Another major thing I can relate to in Center Stage is how these six people moved to New York to dance. When I was seven I went to New York with my dance company and went through many things they did. We all came to dance, danced hard, went site-seeing, and enjoyed our stay. Center Stage teaches you how important life is and live it to the fullest.",1130025600,,1405,4.434108527131783

I fell in love with the dancing, the music and Sascha Ridetski.  It's about a group of up and comming dancers who want to make it into the best ballet school and their struggles with their performances, weight and love lives.  It's not necessarily only a chick flick, but obviously has that as it's main fan base.  A lot of the main characters are actuall ballet dancers in real life and therefore their acting isn't as strong as it could have been, but even so, it's done well overall.  It even stars Ilya Koulik who is an Olympic Gold medalist in ice-skating.  Mandy Moore's song I Wanna Be With You is featured in the movie, and it's such a beautiful song even on it's own, that it made the movie more of a solid hit with me.  The full video of that song is feautred in the bonus' on the dvd.  Peter Gallagher will be recognised with so many people (While You Were Sleeping and The O.C), but it's definately a must see movie and I'm sure it will change your mind about ballet, and it will grab you.

But... the dance sequences are beautiful (probably because most of the characters are played by dancers, rather than actors). The dialogue -- which, the first time I watched this movie, I thought was clunky, is actually honest (again, maybe because nobody is ""acting"" so much as living the story). I love the moment after Jodie runs out of rehearsal and is crying in the hallway. Charlie runs after her and convinces her to come back in, but she blurts out: ""I can't, I'm all splotchy.""

1370605,5,B00004XPPD,"This DVD is one of the most lovely but real stories about ballet dancers .
The lovely is because when you see the reviews for this film , you expect just to see ballet trainings or classes , but what you receive is 2 great love stories and some ballet performances at the end .
The real is all the preparations and the suffer that a ballet dancer could have .
In my case , as a former ballet dancer , this is the true story of all of us , maybe shown as a fairy tale more than the reality , but the good part is that the director showed the problems like anorexia and competition plus all the frustrations but at the same time the beauty and the dreamworld of the Ballet .",1076198400,,672,3.9851851851851854
1370606,5,B00004XPPD,"I'm not going to tell you that the acting is Oscar-caliber or that the plot is daring and original.  The ""actors"" are mostly dancers and the plot lines tend toward the stereotypical.  I am going to tell you, however, that this movie is simply great fun.  Whenever I want to put I smile on my face, I pop in this DVD.
The dancing in this movie is spectacular - especially Ethan Stiefel(Cooper)who is amazing.  Too often dance movies are made with actors who can't dance so that the ""dancing"" is shot in a way to disguise the fact that no dancing by the actor is actually occurring.  The fact that Cooper, Jody and Charlie are all played by dancers, and in Ethan Stiefel's case one of the best dancers in the world, allows the film to end with a bang up dance sequence that you'll want to watch again and again.  Other reviewers have said that the DVD extras aren't worth it, but the extras are worth it just for the extended dance sequences of ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Stars and Stripes"".
And yes, the plots are contrived, but they are engaging.  Not every movie has to be edgy or deep or meaningful.  It's often quite enough for a movie to make you feel good which this movie does in spades.  If you love dance, you won't regret buying this DVD.",1075161600,,1244,4.35064935064935
1370608,4,B00004XPPD,"Ballet was my first passion, and, consequently, I find it fascinating, and I know the work involved with it.
This movie does a very good job of showing the struggle that a ballet student goes through -- the rigor of study and exercise, the attitude of both students and teachers in a professional studio or school...even the stereotypes.  A lot of previous reviewers have complained about all the stereotypes in the movie, but the fact of the matter is, those stereotypes EXIST.  In mass quantities, I might add!  MOST dancers fall into one of those categories; if they had not been in there, quite frankly, it wouldn't have been very true to reality.  So I was glad they put them in.
I do agree that some of the acting isn't exactly earth-shattering.  On the other hand, this is a movie about DANCE, and I would rather see them employ DANCERS than actors.  There is nothing more annoying than watching an actor who can't dance try and pull it off, it just doesn't work.  So I was glad they went with that particular choice.  The actors they had that didn't dance didn't actually HAVE to.  For example, Peter Gallagher.  Peter Gallagher wouldn't have been my first choice to cast as the director of a major company, but when he first came onto the screen, I laughed out loud!  He played the role PERFECTLY!  I watched him and thought, ""Oh, my gosh, it's all the directors and teachers that I had when I was a ballet dancer!""  He couldn't have done it any better if he actually WAS a ballet director.
The story, though predictable, was still sweet, and the characters ended up being pretty likable.
But, of course, the dancing is why you watch this movie.  The dancing is wonderful.  The only thing that bothered me AT ALL was the fact that some of the final dance number is blatantly IMPOSSIBLE to do onstage, but oh well, it was incredibly fun to watch anyway!  I love classical ballet, but when you can successfully mix the classical and the funk, that's fabulous too!
All in all, a very good movie, one of the best dance movies out there!  If you want to see a good dance show, if you want to be entertained on more than one level, this is a movie I would recommend!",1071792000,,2169,4.478371501272265

Still, the dancing is excellent in this movie, you can't deny that the actors are awesome dancers. I really enjoyed their performances. I was relieved to see that they casted actual dancers for this movie, as opposed to actors who go through crash-course dance training to put on mediocre performances (i.e., Save the Last Dance). The dancing makes up for the not-so-creative storyline.",1071187200,,530,4.966292134831461

The commentary consisted mostly of ""...errr...umm...err...yes...good dancers...errr...yes....see that...um....""  And there were only two deleted scenes, when I know there has to be more.  And the featurette was pure crap.  I was expecting (that's what I get for expecting!) interviews and footage of rehearsals, etc.  What you get is an extended version of the trailer.  So, if you're thinking of upgrading to the DVD simply for the special features, don't bother.  The only special feature on this DVD is the movie itself.",1067990400,,835,5.125925925925926

The acting is good for the most part, although Ethan Stiefel as Cooper Nielson is overly dramatic at times.  By the end of the movie, you want Charlie to get his girl, you want all the dancers to be chosen for the professional ballet and you're ecstatic that everyone's dreams come true.

1370616,3,B00004XPPD,"I watched this movie while procrastinating my studies, and I have to say that I found this VERY chick-flicky but very inspirational.  The plot is contrived as anything...the naive new ballerina Jody Sawyer (played by real life ballet dancer Amanda Schull) gets accepted to the premier ballet school in New York, feels inadequate compared to her technique-saavy classmates, ends up sleeping with a cocky choreographer, gets screwed over by him, and ends up stealing the show in the end...AND getting the nice guy to boot.
Other cast members are as equally contrived...""Maureen"", the prima donna bulemic who ends up finally getting a real life and realizing she hasn't been dancing for the right reasons.  ""Eve"" the girl with the attitude and a heart of gold who ends up with as equally contrite a happy ending as Jody.  All in all, the typical recipe for your standard chick flick.
What sets this apart...the dancing!  It is great that they cast actual ballet dancers in this movie.  It lends both credibility and a breath of fresh air to the film (I can't imagine if they tried making the entire cast actors;  it would have been totally fake and ridiculous to watch).  Featuring both a principal (the callous ""Cooper Nielson"") and a corps dancer (the TOTALLY hunky ""Charlie"") from the actual American Ballet Theater, you get a real glimpse of what ballet really is up close.  Just watching it will make you want to work harder at whatever you do....these dancers work their tails off!
The DVD also features Mandy Moore's video for the theme (""I Wanna Be With You"") as well as bios for some of the cast and a very brief and uninformative featurette on the movie.  All in all, not Oscar material but a good break from reality.",1046217600,,1724,4.758389261744966

1370619,4,B00004XPPD,"Jody Sawyer has made it into the most prestigious dance school, and she goes through what every young lady goes through while maintaining friendships, a mistaken relationship, and her dance career.
 Center Stage tells this story, and many other side stories in an easy flowing, interesting way. Not only has Center Stage appealed to those who dance, but it has appealed to those who do not. Although it's main focus is the ballet world, there is  more to Center Stage. What makes the film really good is almost all of the characters are well developed by time the first hour rolls around, and you feel for everyone's outcome. A lot of that goes to the performances by the actors. They were all mostly unknowns, and all came out swell. Amanda Schull as the lead, Jody, was wonderful. She's quite a beauty, and her dancing is wonderful. The remaining cast are all great and talented in acting and exceptionally talented in dancing. The last two dance scenes are excellently choreographed.
 The DVD release is a great special editions featuring deleted scenes, extended dance sequences (Fun stuff), an in-depth featurette with interviews with cast and crew, the isolated film score, trailer, and Mandy Moore's I Wanna Be With You video (Which actually enticed me to see the film).

 ""Life doesn't hold tryouts"" states the tagline of Center Stage, and that's exactly what the film's moral is. Great movie.",1037577600,,1401,4.919491525423729

1370624,4,B00004XPPD,"After seeing this movie twice on television, I bought the DVD solely for the dancing, which is by far the highlight of this movie.
Storywise, ""Center Stage"" has much that I'd seen before in movies with a dance theme:  jealousies and affairs among directors, choreographers, principals and/or students; ballerinas with eating disorders, lack of desire, lack of talent, attitude problems or pushy parents; two guys exercising their egos in a ""dance duel"" . . . you know how it goes.  Stereotypes abound, but the characters are engaging enough so that a predictable plot can still render a movie that is watchable.
Now, for the REALLY good part.  There is excellent dancing in this movie:  Ethan Stiefel, Julie Kent and Sascha Radetsky each provide eye-catching performances.  Zo Saldana, Amanda Schull and many of the others are also worth a look.  I thought the portrayal of the trials and tribulations that accompany dance academies were both interesting and entertaining.  A pleasant surprise under the ""Special Features"" menu is Radetsky's fantastic solo dance scene which wound up being deleted from the final cut (why?).  Stiefel and Kent show us why they're stars in the excellent ""extended dance sequences"" (although the video quality of these bonuses is way below that of the feature presentation, big disappointment).  There's also a cool music video by Mandy Moore, featuring the dancing of Radetsky in a more upscale setting.  For cinemaphiles, the commentary by director Nicholas Hytner is pretty interesting, though not eloquently delivered.
Overall this is an enjoyable movie that will appeal especially to dance fans.",1018051200,,1631,5.262548262548263

The dancing is great, and if you want to get some vicarious dancing thrills, check it out.  Highly recommended for Saturday afternoons.",1014854400,,436,4.623376623376624
1370626,5,B00004XPPD,"First of all, as a dancer, I fell head over heels in love with this movie. Secondly, I think it brings ballet down from the upper class snobbery that most people assume go hand-in-hand with it to real-life issues of success, failure, and struggle to survive. The three main girls: Jody (Amanda Schull), Eva (Zoe Saldana) and Maureen (Susan May), represent three types of personalities in any ballet class. Jody is struggling with the ""wrong body type"" (though I personally see nothing wrong with her body) and ""bad feet."" Eva is a natural dancer with an unfortunate chip on her shoulder and an attitude problem. And Maureen is the ""perfect"" dancer who secretly struggles with Bolemia. These three struggle and survive while, amazingly, staying friends. This may be unlikely in an art that is, basically, murder in competition between females.
More unlikely than the friendship of the girls is the fact that three out of the four young male leads (not counting Peter Gallagher) are straight. These strapping and talented dancers are certainly more than just easy on the eyes. My mouth-watering favorite is Charlie (Sasha Redetsky), who looks like a young Peter Gallagher without the imposing eyebrows.
Anyway, the dancing is top-notch. Combined with the storyline, this is a gem of a movie which succeeds in bringing ballet to popular audiences. I consider it a must in my collection, and you will too.",1010707200,,1401,4.9914529914529915

No, it was not all about the dance,a lthough you would see each person's character best revealed in his/her step.  It was more eprsonal than that.  For Maureen, it was knowing you excel in what you do but you don't find ahppiness in your heart.  For Eva, it ws knowing you're just as good but you are too proud.  For Jodie, it's knowing you' ll never be as good but just wouldn't give up.

That's why CENTER STAGE is such a pleasant surprise - the dancing scenes are very well staged and except for onesequence in the beginning, they move briskly and never feel ""classical"" or ""stagy.""
You know what you're getting with a movie where people are auditioning for a performing arts school and the story is oftheir first year there - so while it's notfilled with great surprises and some of the characters first appear to be ""stock"" (the taskmaster teacher, the overbearing parent, etc ...) they actually become full-fledged characters. All the cliches are there but not unexpected - but it's handled expertly with a good script, fine performances and well-rounded characters you care about.
As long as you like dance, you'll appreciate the work dancers put in and you even learn a little about a ballet company. If you hate dance of any kind, this movie is obviously not for you but you'd be missing out on great acting performances by most of the cast - never mind they're all great dancers - a solid script and a story that moves crisply and precisely.

I've danced ballet for years and I don't care about the little discrepancies in the film; it's still great.  I particularly enjoyed the portrayals of the daily drudge of class.

The plot is very Hollywood and predictable, but it's a predictability that is enjoyable to watch. Yes, you have your stereotypical characters, but there's still a ring of truth to them. As a former ballet student, I can tell you I've met all of these characters and then some. Unfortunately the movie exaggerates a few of the characters to the point of absurdity, such as the ballet mother. When her daughter Maureen admits her eating disorder, the ballet mother justifies the bulimia by saying her daughter is simply watching her weight. I find it hard to believe that any mother would approve of her daughter's bulimia, no matter how ambitious. Eating disorders are apparent in this film--one only has to look at the cast members to see that. Julie Kent is painfully thin and an all too-realistic reminder of ballet's stringent body requirements for female ballet dancers which drives them to anorexia and bulimia. I absolutely adored Zoe Saldana's scene-stealing character of the sassy Eva, and I think many dancers secretly wish they had her moxie. I don't feel Eva exists in the ballet world. She would have been thrown out of such a prestigious ballet school a long time ago-only choreographers and premier danseurs/prima ballerinas can get by with such behavior. Indeed, Eva's sudden substitution for Maureen in the student ballet is pure Hollywood fantasy--no way would Eva go undetected behind the scenes in an actual performance. But it's things like that which makes the movie so likeable. My only disappointment was discovering from the Director's Commentary that Saldana had a dance double for that dance sequence (except for closeup shots). Amanda Schull (a former Hawaii girl) is softly radiant as Jody Sawyer and does do her own dancing. Julie Kent dances exquisitely and Ethan Stiefel is simply amazing.",992736000,,1983,5.048780487804878
1370653,3,B00004XPPD,"The story is old but the energies are new in ''Center Stage,'' and that's all this film needs to carry it past its familiar backstage elements. A spirited ensemble of appealing young newcomers essentially takes us through a year at a thinly disguised American Ballet Theatre school that will end with advancement for a very few and heartbreak for most. This is made bluntly clear at the outset by the company's kingpin, played by Peter Gallagher with a certain arrogance, but also in a way that convinces us he's not wrong to be as demanding as he is. In one of the film's many echoes of past backstage sagas, he reminds us of the godlike choreographer in ''A Chorus Line.''
Before long, we're also sensing the ghosts of ''The Turning Point,'' ''Stage Door,'' ''Flashdance,'' ''Gypsy,'' and ''Saturday Night Fever.'' But ''Center Stage'' is kept from seeming old and hackneyed by the explosions of freshness from its young performers. One, Ethan Stiefel, is a bona fide ABT star. In the film, he plays a prominent soloist who's feeling confined by the strict parameters of the company's repertoire and wants to push off into a looser, freer kind of choreography. He's also coming off the short end of a romantic triangle involving Gallagher's top dog and the prima ballerina for whose affections both competed.
Not surprisingly, the big climactic dance he devises for the academy graduation recital at a Lincoln Center benefit mixes a romantic triangle with a devolution from classical ballet into something more street-flavored. You expect as much, given that his way of relaxing is to ride his motorcycle from Lincoln Center to a Broadway dance studio and exchange Kenneth MacMillan for Bob Fosse as a change of pace. When he meets Amanda Schull's young ballet maverick, Jody, there, it isn't long before they're doing their own variations on ''Romeo and Juliet.''
''Center Stage'' is filled with mavericks. Schull (in real life a San Francisco Ballet corps member) keeps dancing on pure determination, having been told from day one that her body type is not the balletic ideal. But she works hard, and projects charisma and glow. These mavericks also are uninhibited about mouthing off to their teachers, especially Zoe Saldana's Eva. But one of the quietest young dancers (from the ABT corps), Sascha Radetsky's Charlie, has his eye on Jody, too, and is remarkable for his airy elevations besides. Not all of the characters are portrayed by dancers. Ilia Kulik, who plays the resident Russian in the troupe, is Russian, but is an ice-skating champ.
The ''Stage Door'' echo comes in the competitive roommating of Jody, Eva, and Susan May Pratt's unhappy, bulimic prize pupil, Maureen, being shoved toward stardom by her unfulfilled mother (Debra Monk), the film's ''Gypsy'' connection. As the most prominent of the teachers, Donna Murphy contributes emotional depth to a film that doesn't get enough from its simplistically pitched battle between aspiring youth and manipulative fogeys. Oddly enough, although the film does a good job capturing the backstage world of dance, the dance sequences themselves often seem pedestrian. Still, the producers were right to cast dancers who could act rather than try the reverse. They're easy to watch, easy to like, and they vault over the speed bumps placed in their way by the script. Anybody who's ever laced on toe shoes, or wanted to, will find something to take away from ''Center Stage.''",991958400,,3439,5.045694200351494

1370656,4,B00004XPPD,"The dance is fantastic, especially the big production number put on by Ethan Stiefel near the end which is very jazzy, involves a love triangle, and even has a motorcycle roaring onstage to join the ensemble.  Stiefel is an incredible dancer.  I'd not seen him before and it is worth watching the movie alone for his dancing. He plays a principal dancer for American Ballet Theater.  His character has been involved in a real life love triangle with his female dance partner, who was stolen from him by the leader of the troup, played by Peter Gallagher.

Gallagher has become an expert on playing men you will instantly dislike ever since his rat-like turn in ""sex, lies and videotape."" The rest of the plot involves a first year class of dancers at ABT and their struggling to make it in the ballet world.  Their various romances, one intersecting with Stiefel's character, take up a good amount of plot time as well.  It's a ""good fun"" type of film and reminds me of an earlier film, ""Fame,"" which had similar ingredients, about the High School of Performing Arts in New York City.  If you enjoyed ""Fame,"" which I did, you will enjoy this film as well.

1370657,4,B00004XPPD,"Reminiscent of the 1980s backstage movie, FAME, CENTER STAGE offers a pretty accurate view of the New York dance world/community. The movie also provides it's audience with interesting and innovative choreography while exposing to them classical dance. Sure, the plotline is a bit on the schmaltzy side, but how many of us can say that we don't appreciate a good chick flick now and then? We thrill when the naive ingenue finally gets things together in the end, we struggle in sympathy with the bulemic girl, we enjoy the cynical ballerina's sarcasm, and our hearts go out to Charlie, the great guy who's unrequited love will finally (and predictably) be dispelled by our ingenue. Hey, there's even a love triangle.
However, most of us who watched this movie watched it for the great choreography and I can tell you that I was not dissappointed. The choreography was only enhanced by Hytner's liberal use of rhythmic cuts and the searching camera lense. Very modern MTV directorial techniques. By the end of the movie, you will believe that many of these dancers can fly.
As for eye-candy, Sascha Radetsky and Eion Bailey provide mad amounts of it. Truth be told, the whole movie is worth watching just to see the oh-so cute Sascha Radetsky dance. So, go out and buy the movie... what're you still doing sitting here and reading... go... watch the movie.",986601600,,1355,4.844827586206897

And for all you girls who can't sit through a movie if it doesn't have a cute guy in it. check out Charlie he's very very cute. I wish the movie woulda cleaned up some things they left unfinishe.

I love watching the extra dance footage and am looking forward to the director's commentary.  Yes, the characters are predictable, but they're sweet.

1370661,5,B00004XPPD,"I saw Center Stage once in the theatre and bought it recently on DVD. It hasn't left my DVD player, and I've probably watched it upwards of seven or eight times since. The cast is energetic and amazingly talented, the soundtrack is an excellent match to the various types of dance numbers, and the dancing itself is sublime.
I loved the extra features on this DVD, most notably the isolated soundtrack, director's commentary, deleted scenes and the extended dance sequences. The video by Mandy Moore was also a nice touch seeing as it uses footage of the cast of Center Stage and is an excellent song on its own.
The isolated soundtrack works well with the workshop numbers as well as the club scene. The commentary by Nicholas Hytner was interesting as well--for example, the NY skyline in the dance studio was simply a very large transparency. He also addresses technical aspects of shooting dancers and the infamous dance studio mirrors. There are only two deleted scenes: one of Cooper at a rehearsal for ""Stars and Stripes"" as he chats with Joan Miller, and one where Charlie performs a solo number in rehearsal, featuring stunning footwork and a playful mood.
The extended dance sequences flow much more smoothly without the constant cuts to the rather bored-looking audience, allowing the footwork and energy to shine through uninterrupted.
Although quips have been made regarding the acting abilities of the mostly dance-oriented cast, I thought that everyone involved did an outstanding job. This has to be my favourite movie of the last five years or so.",981676800,,1564,4.9505703422053235
1370662,5,B00004XPPD,"Center Stage is greater, better than the sum of its parts.  It's easy to quibble about the acting being a bit amateurish, or plot elements being inane, or some of the characters being clichs.  But that misses the point, which is that Center Stage is perfectly wonderful entertainment of the sort we don't often see on film these days.
Young Amanda Schull, who plays Jody, would be a drop-dead gorgeous American beauty even if she couldn't dance a step.  But she's a fine ballerina, and in the modern dance number  that she performs with her two rival suitors, Cooper and Jonathan, she's so sexy you'll forget all about Flashdance (where I believe a double did the dancing for the star).
Zoe Saldana (who plays Eva) is just as beautiful, ten times as saucy, and perhaps even more talented than Schull.  She's the only one of the young ""actors"" who seems totally comfortable and credible in her acting.  Her performance of the dance from Swan Lake will bring tears to some eyes.
And if you're into guys, step right up:  Center Stage has guys! -- and they're just as numerous, handsome, and talented as the girls.

  Indeed it is, and it isn't even that good, but it sure was a lot of fun to watch.  You've seen this story before, with just slight variations--girl pursues her dreams of stardom, meets some guys along the way, discovers her true self in unexpected places. All the elements are there, the stereotypes abound, you find yourself saying ""Oh, come ON now!"" yet you stay glued.
  Part of the appeal comes from second guessing all these familiar devices, but part of it comes from watching these characters say what you wish they'd say in other movies.  How many times have you wished the prima donna pushed by her stage mother would just tell mom off this once?  The actors, mostly unknowns, do their best with these roles, and I especially enjoyed the actress playing Eva, the outsider who flaunts the rules.

1370667,4,B00004XPPD,"Ballet films since The Red Shoes stress the commitment of the dancer's life to an extremely short and arduous professional career.  The Turning Point, Dancer's, and to some extent All That Jazz are the most recent dance stories which pit women against the expectations of perfection that dance requires.  Center Stage however, takes an unexpected stance against the mindset that ballet is the end all and be all.  Instead, a young woman, Jody, makes the decision to pursue her dream to become a dancer with a national company only to discover that her technique and training is wrong for her to succeed.  A little late in this realization to ring true, nevertheless, a plot twist that allows for electric scenes of Broadway hoofers in class routines that make Bob Fosse's choreography look stiff and dated. Other dance students are equally not suited for the ballet are a bulimic dance princess whose problem is her mother not her nutritional penchant for sticking a finger down her throat.  The talented African-American dancer of the group is doomed because her confrontational attitude to all forms of authority is a stereotype all to easily laid on Black characters in films today.  Do Anglo dancers ever defy fading prima ballerina teachers?  The Olympic ice skating cutie Illya Kulik appears as a Russian dance student.  And, phenomen ABT principal Ethan Stiefel, the new Misha B-type, is so hot in tights as a motorcycle-riding, arrogant choreographer that the film's joyful ending is worth the price of purchase just to view his dance sequences.  This is a familiar dance story retold but worth viewing just to have a visual record of the newest crop of American dancers captured in all their beauty and youthful best on film.",978220800,,1734,4.972318339100346

1370669,4,B00004XPPD,"Most of the reviews that I've read in Amazon were from people with some type of dance background. I, on the other hand, do not possess these skills. Prior to watching Center Stage, I thought it would be purely a dancing moving. To my surprise, it had a good story line and character development in it. The movie hosted real actual dancers as the actors, rather than actors portraying dancers. So the acting in the movie was sub-par, but it gave a FEEL to the movie as well. You can relate to the characters as everyday individuals, instead of the TOO Hollywoodish movies that we're used to.
The main character is Jody Sawyer (a Jenny Garth look-alike), a young, beautiful and nieve girl who's ambition is to be part of the ABC (American Ballet Company). It seems like she would do ANYTHING to achieve this dream! She is one of the few that are selected to attend the ABA (American Ballet Company). There, she meets her dorm friends Maureen (a bolimic), Eve (outgoing/energetic) and a few others. The main goal of the students... to be one of the three male or three females to make the cut for the ABC.
The one thing I did notice was the strong stereotyping in the movie. They had the African-American team up with each other during a dance sequence, they happened to have a Russian couple named Sergey and Gallina, and they made an African-American the bad/rebellious person in the movie. Over all though, the movie was fun and energetic with a variety of music from ballet to jazz to latin to modern pop. It even had a love triangle in it!",977788800,,1541,4.526881720430108

1370673,4,B00004XPPD,"Here's a movie about hopes and dreams and what it takes to accomplish those dreams, about doing want YOU want vs what your parents or parent wants you to do. It's about learning to follow your HEART instead of your HEAD. At times it can be a heartfelt, poignant, and even amusing. When this movie first came out, I had no interest to go see it, maybe it's because I'm a guy, I don't know. As I sat down and watched it, I was hooked. I went along with all the characters, I was even smiling while I was watching it. It turned out to be a true ""sleeper"" in my opinion. It's because of all of this, I would even go as far as to say, it's one of the best films of the year! The story concerns three different and unique girls (Amanda Schull, Susan May Pratt, and Zoe Saldana) simply following their hearts. Jody Sawyer get accepted to the American Ballet Theater, a place she has waited ten years to get into. It's been her life long goal to make it as a ballerina. Schull is a new face to me, and quite a talent, not to mention a looker  lol. She's a wonderful jazz and ballet dancer. In time, I think, she will really hit it big, her talent will not go unseen. Then we have Maureen (Susan May Pratt). She's been at the A.B.Theater for 9 years, mostly thanks to her mother. She is considered the best dancer in the entire school. And also one of the most stuck up. Then we have Eva (Zoe Saldana), who to me, doesn't really seem to care where she is. It's mostly all fun and games with her. She'll say what she wants when she wants and to who she wants, in other words, she's never at a lost for words. These three girls have their own struggles to overcome before they can make it to their dreams. Jody(Amanda Schull), has fallen for Cooper Nielson (Ethan Stiefel). The problem is, as she later puts it in the movie, ""(He) sucks as a boyfriend."" He plays with her emotions when she the most vulnerable, after being told ""(she) has bad feet."" I know it sounds funny to some. She now must work harder to reach her dream. Maureen (Pratt) is suffering from bulimia and if that wasn't enough she's having doubts about her future as a dancer. She's come to the conclusion, that she just doesn't have the ""heart"" for it. It's not what she really wants out of life. And as for Eva (Saldana), she tries to forget about all the hard work dancing can be, and the pressure put on her by the A.B. Theater, and remembers why she first wanted to dance, because she loves it. This is a movie filled with enjoyable characters that are fun to watch and you even begin to care about them. It easy to follow, and has great dance scenes in it, the one at the end is amazing! This is a movie everyone should hurry up and buy, you won't be disappointed.  p.s- a little something for the guys.

Better, yes... good, even... but not as great as the previews make it seem like she is going to get. The plot, to me, seemed hackneyed and weak... a young girl going after something she wants, another young girl going after it just because it was her mother's dream, a rivalry between two guys for one girl, a guy treating a girl badly, eating disorders in young successful girls... these simple and overdone themes were not even treated in a deep or different way.  Some parts of the plot were good, yes, but there was something missing in certain parts and I got bored.  I seem to be the only one who has this opinion, so watch the movie for yourself and see what you think.

Anyhow this movie ROCKED!",971049600,,373,4.567164179104478
1370681,5,B00004XPPD,"I don't know if it's because I've been a ballet dancer since the age of three or if it's because this movie was so amazing. You never hear what goes on behind the scenes, the bloody toes, eating disorders,etc. It's not all the glitz and glam it's cracked up to be. This movie portrays the struggle of a young women trying to make it as a professional ballet dancer and along the way encounters a few romantic, and family struggles. Out of the many things that make this movie so great, knowing that the actors are actually the ones dancing is extremley impressive. I highly recomend viewing and purchasing this movie, if not purchasing, at least add it to your ""wish-list"" !",969753600,,674,4.532786885245901

I always dance in my room in front of the mirror.  This movie  inspiried me even more!  It is not only about daning but its about  relationships and teen age girls life.  I really REALLY enjoyed this movie  and I know if you are like me you would absolutly love it as well.  So, if  you haven't seen this movie, get up and go see it, I'm telling you, you're  missing out!",968025600,,525,3.923076923076923

There is something about this movie  that all females (perhaps males) seem to relate to.  Whether or not they  enjoy ballet,  this movie somehow manages to bring us together.  I love  this movie and cannot wait until it comes out on video.",967248000,,351,4.119402985074627
1370685,5,B00004XPPD,I absolutely loved this film.  I'm not a dancer but always wanted to be one.  This film seems to portray a realistic sense of what the ballet dance  world is like.  The story was sweet and sentimental.  I think everyone  should see this movie!,966902400,,243,4.409090909090909
1370686,5,B00004XPPD,"My friend and I have seen ""Center Stage"" 6 times in the movie theatre.  It never gets old!  I loved the actors and actresses... all  wonderful dancers!  I recommend this movie highly (and the soundtrack  too! )!",966816000,,211,4.594594594594595
1370687,1,B00004XPPD,"Saw this dog on a plane where several people commented that it was the worst film ever seen in flight.  It might not have stunk to high heaven,  but it did stink to high altitude.  Dull and lifeless are the first words  that come to mind.  I like a good film with dance as the backdrop (The  Turning Point, All That Jazz, White Nights), but this dog could barely  walk, let alone dance.  The dramatic storyline didn't keep my interest in  the least. While a few of the dance sequences (not all!) were fine, the  story has to work first.  A total bomb! If you insist, rent it for a cure  to insomnia!  I seldom find movies of this kind this bad!  Need a good  dance film in the DVD collection?  Wait until All That Jazz is  released(hopefully soon! )",966384000,,749,4.235714285714286
1370688,5,B00004XPPD,"I really liked Center Stage.  I saw it in the theatre the first day it came out.  My sister went with me and she wants to be a professional dancer  so it was neat for her to see what dance school is really like.  There is a  lot more dancing than you would think because some of the actors are really  professional ballerinas.  It was also neat to see the behind the scenes  kind of view too.  There is the mom who really wants her daughter to be a  ballerina more than the daughter does herself.  There is the new ballerina  who falls for the guy who is already a big star.  There is the pressure and  competition to its extent.  There is the great friendships that can arise  from any group of people getting to know eachother doing something they  love.  I really think everyone will enjoy this movie.  It is a true  masterpiece not necessarily just a ""chick flick"".",966384000,,869,4.279503105590062
