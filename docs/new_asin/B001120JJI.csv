3058254,4,B001120JJI,"One chance to win takes you back to the truly golden era of American motocross and stands as a great snapshot of the moment that America began to dominate motocross globally.  Still, to see these ""factory stars"" truly sweating it out between motos and the most luxurious riders pitting out of box vans, takes one back to simpler times.  To see Jimmy Weinert pouring water over himself out of an oil pan just shows you how far the sport has come in the 30+ years since this film was shot.  The race footage is good, but it is the behind the scenes footage that really gives the movie it's soul... and should be required viewing for any up and coming motocrosser in this day and age.",1217808000,2,681,4.388888888888889

8239842,4,B001120JJI,"Overall and OK movie. Be sue to watch the extras, as that tells the story ""behind the story"" better than the movie itself.",1448755200,,122,4.3478260869565215

8239844,4,B001120JJI,"I gave the movie 4 stars because I am a motocross rider and fan from that era that still raced up until a racing accident ended all that (and walking) in 2007. This movie by no means is on the par with On Any Sunday et al but it is interesting listening to the guys talk about their memories of that season.

There are many more rivalries that are much better to watch since in this case, other than everyone disliking Karsmakers and some 'conspiring' to keep him from winning the title at the last race, there really weren't any.

I probably should have given it a 3 because the actual racing action was the typical stock footage type stitched together from multiple races/motos instead of anyone battling for the wins, like Hannah/Howerton or Johnson/Bailey, to name a couple..

I enjoyed it and will tell my motocross buddies about it too.",1402272000,,842,4.562913907284768

8239847,2,B001120JJI,"Buying and getting the DVD was easy and fast from the Seller. The One Chance To Win DVD in it's self was ""Lame""!  I was expecting a lot more serious racing action, rather than interviews about a bunch of riders. At best I would give this movie a ""2"" for some information I didn't know about. Other than that, it was a total and complete waste of money! ! ! !",1323561600,2,358,4.042253521126761
8239848,4,B001120JJI,"Loved this movie as I use to race and spectate at the Waggaman track near New Orleans back in the 70's.  It was awesome to see the old track again, and the bikes and riders from the 70's.  The racing coverage was good and watching this was a trip back in time.",1303084800,,260,3.980769230769231
8239849,5,B001120JJI,"Really enjoyed this trip down memory lane. Picture and sound quality was very good considering when it was filmed. Great behind the scenes footage and a good insight into motocross in an age of motorcycling innocence. If you were into dirt bikes in the seventies, you must see this!",1266192000,,282,4.775510204081633
8239850,5,B001120JJI,"I wrote the narration script for the movie ' One Chance to Win"" which follows the 6-way rider battle for the 1975 AMA 500cc National Motocross Championship. During that period I was the feature editor for Cycle News covering all the motocross Nationals Trans-Am and Supercross motocross races across America on a weekly basis, often traveling in the team box vans with the riders and their mechanics.

If you are a motocross fan you will definetly want to see this movie. It is without a doubt the best movie ever made about the sport. And now 30 years later director Todd Huffman has rediscovered it, having never been release and then lost in the closet of original producer Charles Bush.  Huffman is the producer of ""The Motocross Files"" as seen on Speed TV and has added in additional lost footage and current interviews with all the principal riders. Where it now comes to light that Brad Lackey was involved in fixing the outcome of the final race at ""The Battle of New Orleans"" to help his favorite rider win the Championship.

You will find a lot of pictures or the riders, and factory works bikes from this era in my book ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Design-and-Tuning-for-Motocross-Revised-Edition/dp/1578650992/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Design and Tuning for Motocross: Revised Edition</a>"" here on Amazon.com.
