I couldn't find this movie in any rental stores.....so was so happy to be able to purchase it on Amazon.com. I first saw this movie on TV as a special presentation about a year ago.....hadn't seen it since anywhere.
Again, thanks to Amazon.com!
Sincerely,
Sharon:)",1303257600,2,389,4.720588235294118

8229895,3,B000XUOLOS,"Hi I rated this movie as 3 because it was filled with a bunch of talented actors and well written. But I purchased this as a family movie. There was just too much questionable content. Such as a married police officer hitting on a widow, a man in a coffee shop grabbing the widow and telling her he needed to make love to her, as well as other situations of infidelity and big time violence. It's not my type of movie but, I can see other adults enjoying it. I previewed this Thank God first because there would be now way it would work as a family time movie in our home. My main question is How on Earth did it get a Dove Rating?",1237334400,3,631,4.056
8229896,5,B000XUOLOS,"This is a really inspirational movie.  It held my attention the whole time.  The ""ghost"" and the children where very likeable and endearing.  I think everyone in the family will enjoy watching it.",1209686400,3,196,4.878787878787879
8229897,5,B000XUOLOS,"So many so-called family movies slip in decidedly unwholesome elements that one is often not sure that it is truly family fare.  This, with one minor exception, is one movie that even the most conscious of morality will not only find safe but will find to be exciting and satisfying.  The one minor exception is that the kids resort to lying about the 'ghost' with whom they've made friends.  Parents can easily discuss this with their young children.  I think in this case the children rightly sensed that this kindly 'ghost' was seeking redemption for his crime as much as the children were seeking a father figure after the death of their police officer father.  This, I believe, would move the ethics of protecting Whit (the 'ghost') into a grey area.

It wouldn't be fair to parents to tell them the end of the story; however, it does need to be mentioned that Whit is wantonly beaten and then shot in the back by the sleazy police officer who is hot on his tail.  This, just after Whit had saved seven-year-old Cassy's life.  Her cries, after having also recently losing her father, is one few will easily forget.  I would add that if an aunt living in our house who, under the same circumstances, secretly 'ratted out' Whit 'for the reward money' would have been given 72 hours to move out of our house.  However, this family is more forgiving.  In the end, however, this is an uplifting movie that will leave everyone feeling happy they viewed as a family.

 In general, 'Redemption of the Ghost' proves that Hollywood can make exciting, emotional movies without including aspects that are contrary to traditional values families.  [That is, in such a way that to the children the less than moral behavior seem to be 'okay.']  And they can make them so parents can enjoy them just as much as their young children!  Indeed, it is a great movie for grandparents to see with their grandchildren as well.  This movie should be bought by all families with grade school children so the movie-makers see that they can be profitable as well.",1206835200,6,2041,4.656424581005586
