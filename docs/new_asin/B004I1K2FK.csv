4381689,5,B004I1K2FK,I am so happy I found this .  Wish they had kept it going longer.  Its like a modern twist of Indiana jones.,1378684800,,108,3.652173913043478
4381690,5,B004I1K2FK,"These DVDs were in great shape, enjoyed the action adventure series. I had never heard of this before I bought it so it was a nice surprise.",1377129600,4,140,4.222222222222222
4381691,5,B004I1K2FK,I was hoping this series would come out on DVD because I enjoyed it when it was on television. There's enough action to keep things interesting and the scenery is great. Not as high-octane as Hawaii Five-0 but the treasure hunters premise is fun.,1347926400,,246,4.613636363636363
4381692,5,B004I1K2FK,"I am extremely pleased with this purchase. I loved the show as a young man, and it is still great. A little campy, but it had a wonderful premise and an extremely short lifespan. If you like Indiana Jones, you will probably like this.",1346803200,,234,4.340909090909091
4381693,3,B004I1K2FK,"Well, I liked the show when it was on the air and it was very entertaining, now if only I could have it on DVD but there IS, but there's just one little problem.....There's no Closed Captions or English subtitles !!!! Kind of hard to enjoy it if you don't know what the characters are saying.",1315699200,4,292,4.232142857142857
4381694,5,B004I1K2FK,"This show is great.  It reminds me of another great show ""Relic Hunter"" where the cast travels all around the world in pursuit of artifacts.  This show would have lasted for quite awhile had a cast member not tragically died.",1313539200,9,225,4.6
4381695,3,B004I1K2FK,"Adventure Inc - its a sort of microcosm of Raiders of the Lost Ark meets James Bond, just without [for the most part] the really nice toys.

The storylines were predictable, there was no stunning surprise in any episode, however even in spite of that its far from a total loss, most individual episodes were thoroughly enjoyable.

The series focuses around salvage expeditions which take place in interesting destinations varying from the Caribbean to the Med, even rural England, all of which are worth watching even if it's simply for the scenery.

The series would probably keep young teens far more entertained than maturer adults, for me it was almost like the ""A Team"" doing archeological salvage, I just didn't see how that many bullets could consistently miss the ""good guys"".

In the end three stars because although it was fairly predictable it was far from completely boring, the sets were not B quality, the locations were often excellent. In fact the locations got a solid 5 stars. Many of the scenes presented highlighted natural beauty that was quite breathtaking.

It fell down in several of the episode storylines, some of the acting quality, and the obscurity of some of the so very obviously invented ""artifacts"" they were chasing.

From a very personal perspective a much better value, and in the same vein, was the series starring Tia Carrere produced in Canada, where she played the role of Sydney Fox in Relic Hunter.",1311292800,5,1440,4.905349794238683
4381696,4,B004I1K2FK,I loved this show when it was on the air and was terribly disappointed when it didn't come back. Was happy when it came out but hesitated to buy it from Canada because I knew the shipping would be expensive. Then Amazon us got it and I was happy to buy it. It a great bit of just fun.,1305590400,7,284,3.830508474576271

4381698,5,B004I1K2FK,I searched online for this for five years and was delighted to find it on Amazon.  Loved this show and didn't get to see every episode when it was on TV.  Key word is Adventure.,1469145600,,177,4.0285714285714285

4381704,5,B004I1K2FK,"I remember watching this tv series, but only got to watch a few shows. Liked the idea of a treasure hunting, adventure series. So when I saw the complete tv series at such a good price, I bought it. The picture and sound on these 6 DVD's is very good.",1385078400,4,251,4.04
4381705,5,B004I1K2FK,REMEMBER WATCHING THIS ON TV. I WAS SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS BEING OFFERED.  CAN NOT WAIT TO WATCH THIS.,1383264000,,102,4.1
4381706,2,B004I1K2FK,"Now, originally, I had written a review that raked this program across hot coals.

Having taken time to screen the premiere episode - to say it was a disappointment would've been a serious understatement. Ripped everything and everyone associated with the show, including an actor whom I respect and generally enjoy - Michael Biehn. Ultimately giving it a single star.

But the weird part was, in an effort to be fair, I decided to watch several more of the 22 episodes that make up the single season of its existence.

Well, surprisingly, this sort of - very slightly - grew on me.

Okay, I'm not saying this was a sleeper hit that fell to the mercurial and usually moronic axe of the typical Ivy-League schooled icehole. No, it's abundantly clear that this was never going to become a mainstay in the television landscape. But that's not to say that it didn't have a certain spoof-ish comedic charm.

And it's from that perspective that I began to view 'Adventure Inc' in the same vein as watching The Simpsons - an accepted unreality; a skewed lampoon of the real world. Essentially a comic book with living characters.

Unfortunately, miscasts abound.

What didn't change - Biehns' two exceptionally mediocre sidekicks.

The gun-toting babe of the team played by, and this is not a typo, Karen Cliche. An actress who couldn't have had a more appropriate surname. Just about everything about her was just that - clichd. Besides the obvious plastic enhancements, even her sweat looked fake. Despite being some decent eye-candy, she was a marginal performer whose uneven talent hindered the program.

And computer geek, Jesse Nilsson, wasn't nearly geeky enough; nor funny enough to carry his simple one-dimensional role. You're a geek - be a flipping geek. Throw out some complex math, input some programming lingo, hack a computer, do something - anything - but stand around tossing out half-assed smarmy lines.

The stories were shamelessly derivative to the point of unintended satire; the writing wooden and shallow; the direction unexceptionally linear.

Yet, it did grow on me. Slightly. And only if you're in the right mood.

Call it two-and-a-half stars. But since Amazon doesn't have half stars...dos estrellas it is.

Program Note:

I do appreciate that Roger Corman was the unseen hand guiding executive producer, Gale Anne Hurd, through the world of doing things on the cheap. But he wasn't involved enough. Without his clean editing and sharp direction, the show bogged down and bungled itself.

Interestingly, Ms. Hurd would eventually find small screen success. It took nearly a full decade getting the right combination of actors, story and budget.

8429888,3,B004I1K2FK,Honestly? There is a reason it only lasted 1 season. You'll find yourself staring at the walls wishing each episode would hurry up and end. At least it's in Anamorphic 1.78.1 Widescreen.,1512345600,,186,4.84375

8429893,4,B004I1K2FK,"As cheesy as you would expect, but I love shows with great characters and great interaction and while the villains can certainly be two dimensional the main three are fun to watch.  They are each stereotypes- Young hot tech guy, hot super- spy chick, wise older boss- but they also move beyond them.

Good fun, and if you don't expect much of anything else you'll enjoy this.",1475280000,,375,4.582089552238806
8429894,5,B004I1K2FK,Amazing to see some of these short-lived series on DVD while others never make it. Adventure Inc. is a fun series. Adventure Inc. premiered at time when syndicated television was still in bloom. The quality of Adventure Inc's 22 episode series on DVD has amazing quality and decent sound being a 2002 series. It's a series I have been waiting to pick up for a while now. Glad to have it as part of my collection.,1473984000,4,412,4.434210526315789
