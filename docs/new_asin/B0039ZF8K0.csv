4099642,4,B0039ZF8K0,"I own several Hemalayaa fitness dvds. They are all great and this one is no exception. The dvd is divided into three 15 minute segments and you can play them all at once or pick and choose your workout. The first workout is Hemalaaya leading you through Bollywood moves that she considers more feminine. This segment is gentle and fun, more of a warm up than anything else. The second segment is fast paced and she is joined by a male dancer. The footwork is playful and fast, but it kept me from giving the dvd 5 stars because it is difficult to master and can be difficult to do in your living room with a modest amount of furniture. Segment three involves Hemalaaya and her male partner doing more upbeat cardio, something of a culmination of all the moves learned previously in the dvd. I always get a serious workout with Hemalaaya but feel as if I'm just having fun. I really enjoyed this dvd because she stresses ridding yourself of negativity and daily cares during the dancing. Also, I'm finding her floor work to be pleasant new additions to her more recent dvds. I look forward to doing this again!",1294790400,7,1109,4.4950495049504955
4099643,5,B0039ZF8K0,"This DVD has three 15 minute workouts. The first one is gentle, fluid movements. The next two, Hemalayaa is joined by a guy, and the dances work the heart rate up more. Some of the movements you will recognize from her other Bollywood dance DVDs, but with variation. At first I hesitated on buying it, as I wasn't sure if it would be repetitive from her other DVDs, but I'm so glad I bought it, because it has enough variations and fun new moves. I highly recommend it.",1292630400,11,469,4.340909090909091
4099644,5,B0039ZF8K0,As usual this Hemalaya DVD is par excellent. You cannot get better for an indian orientated dance like short fun workout,1285200000,,120,4.761904761904762
4099645,5,B0039ZF8K0,Having this is 15 min workouts is great. Anyone can do these and it is fun. I think the three generations on the house male and female have all tried this and had positive reactions.,1392854400,3,182,4.228571428571429
4099646,2,B0039ZF8K0,"Yes, there are three workouts, but they're all hardly workouts - and hardly fun.

The first 15-minute workout is literally a warm up. It's very slow. I kept waiting for it to move to the next level, but it never did.

The second 15-minute workout is a slight notch above the first workout. The most difficult is the floor work because it's a little bit pilates inspired. You lean back and bring your feet up and then shift them from side to side (this can be done either with your arms supporting you or in front of you). Since I don't have the strongest abs and am a little bottom heavy, this was slightly challenging. The rest is just ridiculously repetitive and a snooze.

The third 15-minute workout is a notch above the second workout as far as intensity goes. It utilizes many of the same moves from the second workout. This workout could be a lot of fun, if, again, it wasn't so repetitive. I was so exhausted (mentally, not physically) from moving side to side that I was just bored during this routine. Perhaps if this one was done without the other two, it wouldn't be so bad, however, you wouldn't find yourself getting that much of a workout.

I originally got this because SparkPeople has a 14-minute routine from the Bollywood Burn DVD and I found that to be fairly challenging. I was able to get this one used for pretty cheap off Amazon and assumed it would be on par with the segment found on the SP website. This was a disappointment in comparison. I think one of the bigger issues is that there's a huge disconnect between you and the people in the DVD. As you can see from the preview, Hemalayaa doesn't speak as she's doing the routines, she does a voice over while working out. It's a little odd. The cuing is also a little off as well. If you've done workout videos, you can pick up the sequence (four counts, eight counts, 16 counts, etc), but if you're new, you might get a little confused when the people switch to something else, but the voice over tells you to switch after they've already started (if that makes sense). I'll probably keep it because I got it so cheap, but I doubt I'll be using it very often.",1388793600,3,2138,4.405063291139241
4099647,3,B0039ZF8K0,"I love Hemalayaa, I have four of her DVDs. That being said, this one made me dizzy with all the rotating involved. It got to the point where my hips and knees, which are bad to begin with, began to hurt. These exercises are great, if you cut out all the turning involved.",1388620800,2,271,4.132075471698113
4099648,5,B0039ZF8K0,"This workout is a blast! It is so much fun and  also carries a positive message. I am NOT A WORKOUT PERSON and I absolutely love doing these workouts. They are fun, flirty and enjoyable and I always feel so great afterwards. Thanks for getting me up and going, Hemalayaa!!",1371427200,2,272,4.44
4099649,3,B0039ZF8K0,I liked this video for just a recovery day kind of day.  It was pretty slow moving for me and kind of boring.  Would not choose this one again.  I ll try other Bollywood workouts instead.,1368835200,,187,4.138888888888889
4099650,3,B0039ZF8K0,"I liked Hemalayaa's energy, and throughout the first part of the workout I was pretty stoked and was enjoying myself... but the longer I did the video, the more I realized she was going to be using the same exact moves she teaches you in the beginning, which honestly doesn't have much variation in it. There must be more to Bollywood than alternating hoping on your feet and wazy your arms around!",1353110400,2,398,4.541666666666667
4099651,5,B0039ZF8K0,"I searched high and low to locate this video since I saw Hemalayaa's 10 minute workout on a hotel exercise channel.  I finally bought a Kindle Fire and it was my very first Amazon instant download.

Hemalayaa has such an appealing, warm approach to movement (no barking instructor on this video) that entices me to join her and her male partner in Bollywood inspired music and gorgeous set. The production and direction are very well done. The movements are guided via voice over that is very effective with Hemalayaa's honeyed voice. The key feeling of this exercise video is acceptance, not judgement.

Other reviewers have detailed the video content, so I won't go into that here.

This video is a valued tool to me that I can take with me on my very frequent travel.  I can just exercise in the privacy of my hotel room and let loose! It has three separate workouts that I can do as one long set or not, if time does not permit.  I absolutely love this video, especially with the reference to the cleansing energy of water.",1325462400,6,1027,4.554347826086956
4099652,5,B0039ZF8K0,"If your one who likes a less structured workout and loves to move, this is an awesome workout.  Get rid of negativity and just move every limb of your body.  It is a playful routine if you want to call it a routine which i do not.  I have several of Hemalayaa's workouts and this one is completely enjoyable.  Have fun!!",1315267200,5,320,4.19672131147541
4099653,3,B0039ZF8K0,"I LOVE Hemalayaa's first Bollywood DVD.  And since I loved it so much, I have tried two of her other Bollywood DVD's, Bollywood Boogie and Bollywood Belly .. unfortunately both of those left me disappointed.  I was bored after the first 10 minutes with both of them and actually stopped the workout because of it.  If you are looking to buy a Bollywood workout DVD go for Hemalayaa's original one.  It is by far the best one, in my opinion.  I honestly wouldn't waste my time with the others.",1311120000,5,492,4.48314606741573
4099654,5,B0039ZF8K0,"It takes a real effort for me to get up in the morning and work out, and I never have time later in the day.  This video, however, is a lot of fun, and puts me in a great mood.  I'm more of a couch potato than a fitness buff, so I love Hemalayaa's ""smile and have fun"" approach.  I'm always amazed afterwards how even the tamest 15 minute work-out can make my muscles burn.  This is a great and motivating way to get moving in the morning and do something good for yourself.  I also love the extra mobility of getting free access to the video through Amazon's ""on demand"" service.  I hope that initiative gets expanded.",1297036800,3,619,4.203389830508475
