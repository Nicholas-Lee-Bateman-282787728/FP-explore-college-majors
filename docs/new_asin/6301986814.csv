7819486,5,6301986814,"This intriguing short miniseries was released on Region 2 DVD in its full-length 208-minute form in 2010 by Network DVD -- available on Amazon UK, the internet, or eBay. Highly recommended.

Ian Charleson is a sympathetic but savvy Russian spy, sent to London at his own peril in order to smoke out a traitor within the KGB ranks. Edward Woodward (famous as ""The Equalizer"") is the British cat who most wants to catch this mouse. But Kyril is in peril from his own countrymen, too -- from people like Povin (Denholm Elliot), an unassuming but nervous KGB operative who doesn't know exactly what Kyril may be up to.

The cast is absolutely all-star, with faces of the greats you've seen do other fine stuff in British film and television.

Recommended for anyone interested in intriguing spy stories, and well-made films. The plot will keep you guessing and figuring things out right up till the very end.",1301443200,,904,4.782051282051282
7819487,5,6301986814,"You are very lucky. We can't get this in the uk on dvd..wish we could. You have great music ,  great actors: Ian Charlston - Kyril, Edward Woodward -Royston, Peter Vaughan -Stanov and Joss Akland - C, also Richard E Grant as Sculby.

Brilliant cars ..great story..Russin agent being brought in to find mole in british secret service. The finale is not what is expected. It even had Sven Beril Taube from ""where 8 bells toll"" film.

All I need is...... please put it on dvd and I'll pay you!

7819488,5,6301986814,"A hard-to-find film, and even in VHS it's worth it.  The late, great Ian Charleson is a sympathetic spy, and Edward Woodward surprises fans of The Equalizer with his complex characterization.  These two actors never made enough films.  And the plot is worthy of the greatest spy thrillers out there.  Trust and betrayal, love and hatred, with enough irony to satisfy the most demanding viewer.",1224460800,3,393,5.0
7819489,5,6301986814,"As soon as I saw a trailer for Bourne Identity I remembered this movie, and when I finally saw the new version I was quite a bit disappointed. It left the impression of rip-off. ""Codename: Kyril"" was much better movie. Without tons of special effects they created a masterpiece of suspence. Let's say I would not mind paying ... to see this movie second time. The only way I would agree to watch Bourne Identity second time if I would be paid twice of what I paid to see it first time. Why? Because as I am concerned I saw it two times, the first and the last.",1026000000,2,560,4.194444444444445
