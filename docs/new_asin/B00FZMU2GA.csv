8619774,2,B00FZMU2GA,"Mr Otis spent a long time in Scotland doing interviews and research. The content of this disc is quite compelling, but there's only 12 minutes on the whole disc.  I felt cheated.  We have bought many videos from his ministry.  Generally they last for one or two hours. Wonder how much footage was left on the cutting room floor. Can't in good conscience reccomend this.  Very very disappointed.  Had high expectations.",1412553600,2,418,4.830985915492958
