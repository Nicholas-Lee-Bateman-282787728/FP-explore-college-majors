8613608,1,B00FA2DE4W,"First off, when I received the first DVD I opened the sealed case to find no disc. It was replaced promptly, no questions. The replace arrived, do I settled in to watch The Devil's Wedding Night. This was horrible quality. Looked like a 16mm film dragged down a gravel road and then projected on a dirty wall while someone video taped it with a cheap video camera. Them the mess was transferred to DVD. Ill taje a pass on future Alpha Home Entertainment releases.",1519603200,2,463,4.523809523809524

8613610,5,B00FA2DE4W,"I personally really enjoyed  this movie, I wish they would make a remake of it because it is kind of an old style movie, there seems to be a little scratching on quality of film but the movie is so interesting that it does not detract too much.  The actors are all very good.  Witches mountain I personally didn't care for at all.",1497657600,,330,4.2063492063492065
8613611,2,B00FA2DE4W,"Not a bad film, allegedly uncut (it's 83 minutes), but the print is absolutely diabolical, dark, full of scratches and tears and with color so poor it may as well be black and white.  Not bad for $6, provided you know that this DVD-R presents a film in such bad shape that a no-audience UHF station in 1982 would have sent it back to its distributor rather than risk the quality complaints of airing it.",1492992000,6,403,4.373333333333333
8613612,1,B00FA2DE4W,THIS COPY OF DEVIL'S WEDDING NIGHT IS SO POORLY COPIED IT IS UNWATCHABLE.,1474329600,3,73,4.6923076923076925

8613614,4,B00FA2DE4W,"The main attraction on this budget DVD release, The Devil's Wedding Night (1973), is a well-crafted, and overtly exploitative, period tale of satanic rituals and vampirism, obliquely alluding to Elizabeth de Bathory. The image of Rosalba Neri rising naked and blood-soaked from a coffin, shrouded in mist, is the stuff of Euro horror legend, and the film itself is presented well enough and uncut on this DVD transfer.
The second feature is fascinating but too abstract for today's audiences, Raul Artigot's Witches Mountain benefits mightily from incredible location shooting in the Pynrenees mountains in northern Spain. This lends the film an authenticity that, if you ignore some of the early 1970s anachronisms like the hero's caterpillar moustache, makes the goings-on seem a but too authentic. Save for a brief witches dance sequence, the settings and rituals satisfy the title's promise fully. Add the bizarre, distorted choral music, and the stunning presence of Paty Shepard, and you have a memorable early 1970s Euro horror classic with a chilling twist ending. Of course, you have to really WATCH the film to understand the framing of the narrative. Unfortunately, this DVD uses a cropped and slightly censored 16mm print, very similar to the one released by Unicorn Video on VHS in the 1980s, with some of the scenes so dark it's becomes a chore to watch. This begs for a widescreen, uncut transfer, at least for Euro horror fans of this period (all 12 of us).",1387670400,28,1473,5.065843621399177
