488971,4,6302645352,This is an older movie but it's still funny to me.  It's cheaper to order it through amazon versus renting it from the video store.  It's brand new and delivered within a few days.,1256428800,,180,4.264705882352941
488972,2,6302645352,"This movie truly sucked and it is one those movie that will not live through the times. I always had a crush on Stacey Dash and all but i actually got this movie because I heard Bernie Mac was in the movie and surprisingly, he was, but for literally 2 seconds. Overall a terrible plot!",1239148800,,285,4.2
488973,5,6302645352,"This movie won't win any awards, get a fresh tomato on Rottentomatoes.com or be in the top 250 of IMDB(as if anybody cares what these stupid sheep think!) but it was still a funny movie and brought to you at a time when the Wayans Brothers were at the top of their game.

Story: Johnny Stewart(Damon Wayans) is a hustler that plans on going legit after meeting an attractive woman named Amber(Stacey Dash). So he gets a job as a mail room clerk and ends up stealing a credit card and goes on a shopping spree with his brother Seymour(Marlon Wayans). A roguish executive finds out and extorts Johnny to do his bidding.

The funniest scenes: every scene involving the beauty-challenged Charlotte is a riot. The scenes involving the lawyer that looks like a cross between Khujo Goodie of Goodie Mob and Rodney King is a hoot also.
Damon and Marlon work well together on screen and generate the most laughs. Stacey Dash is great also as Amber. If you like to see the Wayans Brothers before they started making rubbish like Little Man and Scary Movie 2 than this movie is for you. Also recommended is the soundtrack to this movie.",1229299200,,1125,4.564356435643564
488974,3,6302645352,"I saw this movie in the theaters when it first came out, this was a great comedy.",1213833600,,81,3.823529411764706
488975,3,6302645352,"I thought this movie started out cool, bad script and all.  The ending was not believable at all and was rushed.  Wanna do a real comedy-action film, not so heavy on the comedy and let the action just happen.  The people involved with this one had slight ideas where they wanted to go with it, but didn't know how to end it.  So, instead of taking a little more time with it... need I say more?  On top of everything, the release of the home and cable edition, there's extra edits not in the original film (BAD edits!)  I guess somebody at the film company decided there's was too much cussing at the end (i.e. Damon standing in the middle of the street at the end of the chase sequence yelling, ""DAMN!"" - but in the theatrical release he says a different cussword)  Don't believe me?  When it comes to dirty words, I can read lips, especially after seeing this at the movies (and I was working at a theater when I saw this and it was free so I enjoyed it more...)  There's the infamous sex scene blured out, but that wasn't different from the movie in theaters at all.  Hold up, why did they blur out the sex scene?  Mo' Money is R-Rated!!  I wanna see Stacey Dash, but it wasn't about her.  It was more less Damon making that decision.  They made their point, I guess.  Well, this could have been a way better comedy than an action flick.  The comedy was Wayans flavor, but the action was cut and dry.  This DVD won't do it justice because it didn't even do well at the movies.  This is one of those movies you catch on regular TV when nothing else is on (which explains ""Damn"" substituting ""S---"")  While editing for TV, this edit wound up making it to the ""R-Rated"" VHS and DVD.  WOW, incompetence is great!  Gone",1203379200,,1717,4.286604361370716

488977,3,6302645352,"It really isn't so bad. As far as Wayans brothers come and go, Damon is one of the funniest. Believe it or not, there is actually a plot, and the film manages to blend convincing moments of tension and drama amidst occasional moments of hilarity.

Much to the chagrin of his partner in crime, Johnny (played by Damon) decides to try and go legit after falling for Amber, who he meets mid-scam. He lucks his way through an interview, lands a low paying job in the same building as her, and proceeds to pursue her. His old criminal instincts eventually get the best of him and he gets caught by the devious company head of security, who then proceeds to exploit him for his own self-serving purposes.

Realistic? Not really, but it's one of the more genuinely amusing films to come out of the ""new jack swing"" era, and way funnier than anything in the Scary Movie franchise. That's fo sho.",1137888000,,887,4.503105590062112
488978,4,6302645352,"Hello. This is my review of the motion picture film 'More Money'. This film is about stealing credit cards.

I thought that 'More Money' handled the subject matter of credit card theft quite well, and there were many good action scenes involving credit cards, and the theft thereof. The director provided several good closeups of the credit cards, so that it was clear to the audience what the focus of the film was.

Overall, 'More Money' is quite a good credit card theft movie, although some of the scenes involving the romantic subplot between Johnny Stewart and Lt. Raymond Walsh detracted slightly from the credit card theft theme, and seemed 'tacked on'. A solid 4 stars.",1130630400,,678,4.836206896551724

489047,4,6302645352,"Mo' Money was written by Damon Wayans, and capitalized off of the popularity of the ""Homeboyz"" skit from in Living Color that he previously starred in.

Damon and Marlon Wayans have great on-screen chemistry as brothers Johnny and Seymour, and a number of scenes in the movie follow the In Living Color formula.  Plus we're treated to gorgeous Stacey Dash as Amber Evans, Johnny's love interest.  Plus there are solid performances by Joe Santos (The Sopranos), John Diehl (The Shield) and Harry Lennix (Five Heartbeats).

This isn't the best comedy to come out of the early 90's, but it's still a funny movie.  There's also a good bit of physical humor that was obviously improvised by Marlon Wayans.  The only downside is that the plot itself isn't anything special, so it's not quite a blockbuster romantic comedy.

This is a good movie to add to your DVD collection if you're a fan of 90's comedy, or In Living Color.",1270166400,,920,4.748427672955975
