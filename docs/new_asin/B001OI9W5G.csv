3730383,4,B001OI9W5G,"This is an excellent amateur production ($80,000 budget, I think) with much in it that is VERY professional.

Story line is GREAT.

Strong Christian message.  Good for men and young men especially, but I'm a lady and I really liked it.

Very inspirational, and not only for Christians, I think.

Of course, the Arthur story is a plus, but the main character could be any young man, but anyone can identify with him.

Last half hour is tops.

Cast of thousands.  Well, not really, but it does have a large cast of extras.

Excellent score!  Stirring and beautiful!  Hauntingly beautiful, actually. (Haunting in the good sense.)

I thought the props were great, and I loved the ""Don't break the basket!"" in the special features.

CG scenes were very good.  They could use some polish, I think,for them to look really real, to blend into the photography, and to look really professional, but still, they were very good.

Most of the acting ranges from very good to excellent. There are some spots and some actors that could use significant polish, but again, I could overlook those and get into the spirit of things and really enjoy the movie and plot.  I have heard comments from other people that much of the acting needs significant polish.

When weaker elements appeared, the plot and score carries the whole thing along very well, and there is so much about the movie that is excellent and professional-looking.

I'd like to see this family production group (with the help of extended family and friends and their cast of ""thousands"") do more movies!!!  That would probably be after the director gets out of school.

If they can do this well with their first movie, imagine what they can do with all they've learned from that dread School of Hard Knocks!",1238112000,32,1756,4.732673267326732
3730384,3,B001OI9W5G,"That's what our three boys said after seeing it.  They thought the action scenes were very cool,appreciated the dialogue about God's calling in one's life, but thought the main girl was strange-looking.  (I know that sounds cruel, and I don't mean it as an insult to the appearance of the actress, but she doesn't get to show many emotions, or else they all kind of melded into one ""look"".)  Some of the acting needs a bit more polish to truly be considered professional but the movie on the whole does seem well done as far as cinematography, costumes, etc. While none of our sons asked to see it again, I think they will later on.  From a parent's perspective, I liked the fact that the storyline involves Christianity.  When the characters encourage each other or remind each other of God's calling in their lives, the dialogue is realistic.  I wanted to provide them with an action-filled movie but with an eternal perspective and this fit the bill.  I gave it three stars instead of four but if the acting improves on this family's next project, I'm sure I'd rate it higher.",1235865600,10,1079,4.617801047120419

3730390,2,B001OI9W5G,"I expected much more, something along the lines of the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit series.  I was hugely disappointed, to
say the least.  The story plot was weak.  The acting and action sequences extremely poor.  It was promoted as a top notch
Christian production.  As you can see, I gave it a Two Star ""I Don't Like It"" rating.  I could easily have chosen One Star ""I Hate It""!

Sorry.  It just doesn't meet expectations.

3730391,4,B001OI9W5G,"A Christian action movie is a rarity, but these folks did a good job on a low budget.  The acting is not the best, but if you're like me and you're looking for something that retains godly values while showing how that is lived out in an action-movie-type situation, this movie is one of the first of its kind and worth the watch. Similarly, but with better acting and higher-quality cinematography, check out the Christian action movie Courageous (but that's modern-day police-movie action).",1356048000,3,492,4.927710843373494

I think, that for their budget, they did excellent. The music was great and the fight scenes were amazing (Coming from someone who fights with swords and writes music).

I do think they could have made Winnevaria's character a little better, though.

This movie is Awsome, and it is one of my absolute favorite movies. :)",1338508800,3,593,4.5233644859813085

I give this 5 stars for good messages communicated throughout the movie.
A father communicating godly vision to his son. There is also the doing of good when it is in ones power to do it and loving an enemy enough to show compassion and forgiveness.  There is a time to fight for right.  Fight and protect your families.  Truth, sacrifice, nobility.  Good vs. Evil.  Good always wins.  Love it!

I also appreciate that there is no over doing the bloodshed in the fighting scenes. I know that bloodshed is part of war and such, but I am glad that there was nothing too scary for my children to watch in this.

It was not meant to compete with Hollywood.  That being said, if a couple of my friends and their kids decided to make a ""homemovie"" about 10 minutes on youtube would be about all we could aspire to produce.  Considering this alone makes it an EXCELLENT movie.  I sit watching in amazement (and watching like a hawk to find our friend, also a homeschooler, that was an extra -yes, we found him several times) that a bunch of homeschoolers could put this together.

I ordered a used copy just in case it was as bad as some said it was.  I watched the movie before letting my 10 year old watch it and I loved it.  No, the actors are not as good as the big picture movies we are acustomed to, but they weren't as bad as some reviews led me to believe.

Considering the film's budget and producers, Pendragon was wonderfully done and it is obvious that a ton of work was put into it. The plot is not too complicated for children to follow, but is interesting enough to keep adults' attention as well. You can tell that some of the actors are not experienced, but in a way, this rather adds to the innocence of the film.

3730399,3,B001OI9W5G,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did.

The cinematography, costuming, and sets are amazing for the budget this film had. I have absolutely no complaints there. It's beautiful.

The acting was... acceptable. Very often, though, it felt like there were no acting coaches on staff and they only did a few read throughs before shooting. It lost a star in my estimation due to that. But, sadly, I've seen worse.

The second star off came from the fact that I am a lover of Arthurian Lore. Except for the foreign invaders there is nothing movie has in common with true Arthuriana other than names.",1308268800,,596,4.60377358490566

It  had  a  great  script  and  it  had  a  great  Christian  message.  The  photography  is  good  although  there  were  some  places  where  it  could  have  been  done  better,  and  it  could  have  been  edited  better  in  a  few  spots.

3730401,5,B001OI9W5G,I enjoyed the movie and it came quickly in the mail.  It was a good movie about a young man following in his father's footsteps.  His father was a soldier with a deep love for God and he taught his son to love God.  The young man became a soldier and fought to free his country from the enemy. It was a wonderful movie and I enjoyed watching it.,1281052800,,345,3.971014492753623
3730402,3,B001OI9W5G,"I gotta say, this movie could have been the best action movie (Hollywood, Independent, whatever) since the days of Ben Hur, Spartacus, etc, and their thousands of extras.  As it is, the movie is mostly too painful for the average viewer to watch. There are a few reasons for this, and I will try to explain these below.

ACTING:
Well,I will say that most of the characters really looked the part.  The female lead isn't quite your typical drop dead gorgeous actress, and the male lead is a bit too innocent and confused looking.  However, the rest of the characters looked great, and the villain looked PERFECT! The attention to detail and historical accuracy in terms of hair style and costumes was spot on perfect.  However, the actual acting was pretty painful. It was like watching a big powerful guy stand up and start singing like a girl.  The voices just didn't fit.  The emotional tones were there, but that was it. This movie fell victim to the classic blunder of independent film-making.  That is, of course, that of casting your friends and family as the leads. In rare cases it works (see Facing The Giants), but more often than not it doesn't.  With some script changes (see below), there is some real potential for good acting in this movie. There are thousands of good actors out there who are unemployed and in most cases undiscovered. A local casting call(and advertised online) would probably have yielded a hundred or more people. If they had had a casting call with online submissions, they would have gotten thousands of people. This would have allowed the makers of the movie to choose the very best available.

COSTUMES:
As I said above, they were spot on perfect. Unlike a lot of big budget films, these costumes were 100% historically accurate, and the armor and weapons were incredible for such a low budget. In fact, I think they said on their website that most of the spears and axes were made with broom handles, and cardboard covered with foil and spray painted.  Seriously though, you would never be able to tell by looking at them.  They look like real metal.

SETS:
Again, spot on perfect.  The settings were pretty and fit their respective scenes very well. These people even built a hill fort all by themselves on a friend's property! You also see a castle, viking style great hall complete with feast, and a military encampment completely on fire!

MUSIC:
Mostly very good. I think it deserves to be compared to Hollywood level scores.

ACTION/FIGHT SCENES:
These rank from outstanding to absolutely terrible.  You have a horse chase through the woods, and some riding through the snow that are pretty well done, with all the riding done by the actual actors (no stunt riders here). The pyrotechnics were also amazing. There is a fortress attack complete with catapult that is quite believable. The shots of the burning walls and such were great. However, most of the action suffers from a lack of epic scale and bad choreography. You have armies of 50 or so people on each side. While this is ok sometimes, it makes an epic battle seem very limp and weak. This is also missing the usual helicopter-style fly-by shots of each army or the battle in progress.  Close up hand-held camera shots also limit the action, and don't allow you to really get into it. These close shots only work if you have great fight choreography, and these guys sadly don't. Don't get me wrong the fighting is good, just not good enough to be the driving force of the whole battle.  The final battle sequence is pretty good, and the shots of the two leads battling it out through the flaming encampment had a lot of potential. Again though, the voices of the actors and slightly lacking choreography don't allow it to blossom. This scene could have been the best fight scene in recent film history, but instead it is merely very well done.

SCRIPT:
As has been said, the script had a lot of potential, but kinda fell on it's face. With raw actors and a lack of trained fighters, this film needed perfect dialogue, more depth, and more time early on to firmly ground the characters.  As it is, the dialogue is passable, but at times very cheesy and the quoting of bible verses is just cringe-worthy. Don't get me wrong, I'm a Christian myself, but the way they did this just didn't work. If they were going to quote verses, they needed to do it in Latin or something. This is a very disappointing oversight. The rest of the film is so accurate historically that this mistake just screams at you. Back then, no one except churches and the very richest people had access to bibles. Bibles were painstakingly copied out by hand by monks and were very precious. Only priests were able to read them, especially as they were in another language (I'm pretty sure it was Latin).  So there is NO WAY the main character would have been able to quote scripture, especially not word for word, and ESPECIALLY not in English!! For a film that tried to have the Vikings grunt in some other language, this is is just all wrong.

USE OF BUDGET:
Incredible!! I put this category in here a for a reason. I think what this film does is to prove once and for all that you can make an epic action film on a shoestring budget. All the things involving money (sets, props, costumes, animals, etc) were jaw dropping amazing!  In fact, these were the best parts of the whole movie.  The only bad parts of it were the parts that could have used a bit more patience, experience, and strategy. With some good actors, more extras, a better script, and better choreography, this movie could have put a lot of Hollywood guys out of business.  In fact, I'd love to see these guys do another such film. I bet they could get a professional actor or two to do it for free, more extras, and some professionals on the crew (producer, camera men, etc).  If they were to do that and release it in theaters it would probably top the box office for a couple solid weeks.

So to recap:

Acting: 1 Star
(Yes they looked the part, but the voices and acting were NOT as good as the script required, even in a worst case scenario.)

Costumes: 5 Stars
(Rivaled the best of Hollywood productions)

Sets: 5 Stars
(Again, as good as Hollywood)

Music: 4 Stars
(Compares to most Hollywood scores, but like a lot of those scores it could still be better)

Action/Fight Scenes: 3 Stars
(It was lacking, but it looked worse than it was because of camera shots and lack of extras)

Script: 3.5 Stars
(Again, it was lacking but it could have been made up for by better acting and fighting)

Use of Budget: 10 Stars
(Sure, there aren't 10 stars on a scale of 1 to 5. However, these people have revolutionized budgeting, and thus deserve revolutionizing on the scale)

OVERALL: 3 Stars
(Had unlimited potential, but ultimately it is really too painful for most people to watch all the way through. It will appeal to film-makers though, just to show what really is possible and what NOT to do! Imagine what these people could do when teamed with professionals and operating on an Avatar budget!)",1275868800,44,7046,4.5998402555910545
3730403,4,B001OI9W5G,"I bought this movie not really knowing what to expect.  I figured good message probably bad effects.  I was partially correct.  The message in this movie about a warrior who relies on God for his strength is really bold.  The main character in the film is constantly quoting verses which give him strength in time of trouble.  As far as the bad effects and cinematography, it was not as bad as I expected.  I mean most Christian films are really low budget.  This one had some decent fight scenes or maybe you just get used to not seeing the blood and gore the farther you go along in the movie.  I believe the movie still made its point with the fight scenes, but we are just so used to seeing the gore as a society that it was kind of weird without it.  However, this also makes it more watchable for younger kids.  The story had quite a few twist in it that I did not expect; however if this is based on a true story, these twist would show the ultimate faithfulness of God to his followers.  I highly recommend the movie.  I love historical type films, and this entertained me.  God bless.",1274572800,5,1093,4.299019607843137
3730404,2,B001OI9W5G,"I'm in charge of family movie nights at my church, and was recently looking for some good movies to show.  This is one of five that I purchased.  I'm aware that many Christian films are cheesy in the extreme,and I refuse to show anything that isn't well-done.  When I saw the cover to this dvd, I was impressed by the list of awards it had won. So I picked it up with high hopes.

After watching the movie, I have to suppose the people who gave this film its awards must be related to the film-makers.

I wanted this to be a great movie, but it is awful in so many ways.  I do concede that at times the cinematograghy is beautiful and professional-looking.  On the other hand, the way the battle-scenes are shot is very bad- full of close-ups that leave you wondering what just happened.

Another serious problem is the sound-mixing.  The sound-effects are just way too loud, and at times completely drown out the dialogue (although that might be considered a blessing).  There is one scene when the villain turns to say something, and there is a loud sound that seems to be his spine cracking in two.  This actually had me and my son laughing out loud- especially since the actor immediately mispronouced the word ""personally"" as ""pershonally"".

The acting is just terrible. Worst I've seen in a film of this kind. The less said about it the better.

However, I could probably overlook most of these flaws if the film had been in any way engaging or if the characters were in any way realistic or likable.  The script is extremely banal.  There is no humor in the film to lighten the bludgeoning seriousness of it all. (I admit I didn't make it to the end of the movie).  There is no witty diaogue.  The characters don't talk to each other.  They make lofty speeches to each other.  Everything the characters say is treated as if it's the Gettysburg address.

In essense, there is no sublety, no excitement, no magic to this movie.  I hope the film-makers do much better next time. The first step is to hire a decent script-writer.

I give it two stars because of the sometimes well-done photography, and the good intentions of the film-makers.  That's the best I can do.",1266192000,6,2172,4.512820512820513
3730405,2,B001OI9W5G,"The Pendragon: Sward of His Father made for an interesting interpretation of Celtic Britain's history that might appeal to child audiences. That said, Chad Burns should've waited until he'd gained more experience with smaller projects before tackling a big one like this. The directing, cinematography, special effects, music, and costuming made for the stronger elements of the film. However, these couldn't rescue it from a poor script (rendering the main female character completely unconvincing), poor acting, and oversight regarding customs and manner of the time period. But probably the worst element was casting, which was obviously not conducted by an independent agency. A brother and sister playing opposite each other is kids' stuff in a home movie and highly improper for a feature film made for a Christian audience.",1264550400,4,830,5.441860465116279
3730406,5,B001OI9W5G,"First of all I'd like to say don't listen to those derogatory and one star reviews saying how awful it is. Unless of course, you're expecting a video with CGI and special effects happening right and left every second or so, OR lots of blood and gore. This is an independent film made by two families and over 400 extras on a low budget. It is AMAZING. Especially for a low budget film with a strong (but not overly religious or sickening)message.

My best friend who loves this movie and kept saying how wonderful it was. When I visited her, she could not /wait/ to show it to me. I, having never seen the movie before was skeptical, but this movie really surprised me. I, not wanting to upset her, prepared myself for what I thought was to be two hours of pure torment. I was EXPECTING poor acting, sad costumes, and awful filming, and an overly religious script. What I got was one superb story, with music and acting that blended together like a beautiful tapestry.

There are a few tiny things to be desired, and on occasion the lead girl seems a tiny bit more distressful than I usually like damsels to be. But I must say, to not to look beyond these small imperfections, would be to miss a gem of great value and price. I hope, just as I did, you will find the treasure at the heart of this story.

3730407,1,B001OI9W5G,"except maybe the sincere Christian message which I still felt was secondary to the story.  My last sentence comes across very sad to even me as there really isn't a story to speak of, only a threadbare plot. If you were wondering whether this was Christian reclaiming of the Arthur legend, it kind of is, but holds no resemblance to it other than the names.  There isn't significant writing in this and it shows in how the characters seem separated from each other throughtout.  There are no genuine connections in the movie whatsoever even the critical relationship from father to son.  The closest they get is a tangental connection between Pendragon and his kidnapped sister, which is barely there. The reason it's so sad is because the movie is close to 2 hours long, features diverse elements of light and dark, beauty and ugliness, peace and violence...and love. The film never develops any of these elements into something substantial, or entertaining.  Just because you don't have a budget doesn't mean you don't have good writing, or other good elements.  Many wildly entertaining movies are of low budget, but high quality, here we have use of digital technology that only serves to distance the film from any emotional depth.  It doesn't have to be that way as I've seen numerous digital films that worked wonderfully, but this one seemed particularly anemic.  The additional dialoue recording done for this film was both extensive and weak.  A number of scenes are barely audible as they are hushed and whispered. This movie is the quintessential argument against the Godard method of not shooting with a script. It seems rushed, poorly made, and having no genuine anchor for the audience to attach itself to.  If they had a script, well, I hope that next time (if there is one) they come with a better one in hand.  If they do it will be an expensive lesson learned.  May Christian film live on, get better, and forget this failure that shows faint hope.",1263081600,5,1967,4.804154302670623

I also appreciate that tweens (approximately age 10 or 11) and up can watch it (no younger children due to the fighting sequences) without the worry of inappropriate content.

I found the short clips shown of the relationship between the king and his daughter and the star of the movie and his sister a bit akward in that it made you question if they were more of a romantic love than a father/daughter, sister/brother love.  The movie wasn't explicit on it and the clips were short though.  A kid probably would bot pick up on it.

When you bear in mind what the film is, it is amazing what they have done. It is not a multi-million dollar epic, but it is a great movie with a good story.
We are English and the historical setting is realistic to the locations and time period - they did their research well. It is every bit as good as period reconstructions you can see in England.
Knowing just a little historical background of the Roman and Saxon invasions of Britain helped us understand the story line - otherwise it might be confusing to keep track of who is doing what and why.
I was a little concerned about the battles at the start of the movie. But the fight scenes were carefully done and even my younger boys were fine - although they shut their eyes a couple of times.
Definately a movie we will watch again and that I will lend to others.
An inspiration to families and young people, I hope this company does more like this.",1257638400,21,1248,4.406926406926407

3730414,1,B001OI9W5G,"I've been impressed by the props, for the most part, though the clothing does leave something to be desired. And the Christian message is sincere. But the acting is absolutely the worst I've seen in just about any movie over the past twenty or so years; especially in this genre. Clive Owen in 'King Arthur' also has a Christian message, but he can act, and so can EVERYONE else in that movie. In this one, I can't find a single genuine actor. And the casting for the young woman was poorly thought out. Doesn't look the part, and can't act worth beans.",1245110400,11,553,4.431372549019608
