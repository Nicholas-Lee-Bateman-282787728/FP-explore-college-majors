However, when connected to my smart TV, Amazon video cut in and out of connection a lot: froze, delayed, ""loading"" etc, even though nothing else connected to my internet service was working just fine.

Shaking the case would have resulted in ditching the product into the trash.  The inside plastic spine was in pieces, but the DVDs were still in place and by inspection, were scratch-free.

This season falls flat for me, compared to the first two.  I find that to be true of most series that go like gangbusters at first.  There is always a plateau and lull.  I'll see if I want to continue.  At first, I had a hard time getting into this as I couldn't help but compare it to ER.  Once I stopped comparing, I enjoyed the actors and writing.  Except for Pompeo; I just can't understand how in the world she was cast.  Overall, I am enjoying the show as time allows.",1421798400,,639,4.056

Every season is excellent. You'll find the most well rounded, lovable, and interesting characters on television. And you'll laugh out-loud as much as you'll cry. This series has been made so superbly, and it's one of the only shows that my husband and I both agree on, and that we both look forward to. There's not a person alive who cannot identify with at least one of these characters, and I love that the writers aren't afraid to encroach on an interesting array of subject matter.

I was hoping that they would move on from each other. Addison is the only real character worth liking and for Derek to choose bimbo Meredith put the end of me watching this. Done. And Cristina is so hard to look at, how can such an unattractive woman being on a popular show. I think Izzy is a good actress...but her relationship with the patient and stealing an organ...and the hospital and friends understanding her behavior...bad, bad bad.

2813499,4,B000P6YNSO,"I have been re-watching 'Grey's Anatomy' from the beginning and while I enjoyed many parts of Season Three, while re-watching the series I have discovered there are many things about Season Three I cannot stand.  First of all, this was TR Knight's most annoying season.  All of George's back-and-forth whining is annoying and makes me wish they had killed him off instead of writing Isaiah Washington off the series.

George begins the season pretty affably, even likeable.  I enjoyed his courtship with Callie.  Then he became annoying when the family mess started and his dad died.  From uncharacteristically mouthiness with everyone around him, including Bailey, Burke, and even the Chief, to marrying Callie and cheating on her with Izzie.  My favorite storylines this season involved Meredith and her family (the death of her mother, the touch-and-go relationship with her father and step-mother), Christina's struggles with her relationship with Burke, and the random interactions between Bailey, Callie, Addison and Mark, Addison's almost triangle with Mark and Alex.

After watching the early seasons of this series, I'm actually happy it's progressed the way it has.  This is one series that, as it has aged, has benefited from rotating cast changes.",1313884800,,1259,5.318181818181818

2813537,5,B000P6YNSO,"-SPOILERS IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN SEASON 3-

I've seen so many reviews stating Grey's third season was the worst season, but it was one of my favorites. I think the plot twist were realistic and that people thought the characters dealing with their own inner demons were just being dramatic. Many people thought Meredith was just trying to be dramatic but in reality she just isn't a person who is going to be suddenly 'fixed' because she has Derek. She seemed to be getting better, yes, but once her mother came back into the picture it's understandable she would relapse into a more darker Meredith. George was seen unpredictable and out of character this season but his dad died, a fact I don't think Grey's played on enough. Most people just forget his dad died and couldn't seem to find a reason why he's acting so strangely. There were a little out-there things, but most of the stuff that happened in the first and second season were out there too.

It makes you laugh, cry and most importantly..think! Whether it's a medical problem that you didn't see coming or a relationship twist, greys anatomy gets thumbs up for that.

The medical dramas and situations were no longer original and it was like they kept going in the same over and over, same with all the relationships.... I was a real fan of the show ( I even found myself wishing the summer (2006) to finish so they release season three) I just got so deceived, I never ever watch it again...",1231372800,2,595,4.467889908256881
2813569,5,B000P6YNSO,"I have seriously become addicted to Grey's Anatomy. I had Season 3 for only 4 days and managed to watch the whole thing during the work week, which took some planning.

Season 3 picks up where it left off with Izzy still in shock over loosing Denny and her friends rallying around her in support. Each episode had at least one moment where I was either laughing, crying or nodding in agreement.

**** Spoiler Alert****

Meredith has a lot of happy and sad moments in this season. Her mom dies, she almost dies, her relationship with Derek gets better and then worse after her near death experience. We see a cute love triangle between her, Derek and Finn(the vet) played by Chris O'Donnell.

Izzy, George and Callie have there own little love triangle. I found it hard to believe that Izzy would be in love with George that quickly after loosing Denny, unless her feelings for him were unrealized. The chemistry between Izzy and George is very good and I found the scenes between them after they remembered that they'd been together very well acted out. But, I don't like Izzy and George as a couple. I actually like Callie and her quirky-ness. I get her sense of humor and it's fun to see how into George she is.

Lastly Christina and Burke's wedding drama ending with him leaving her at the altar was awful. I was crying with them in the season finale where emotionless Christina is being cut out of her dress by Meredith and the show ends with her sobbing.

The cliffhangers were amazing...George didn't pass his intern exam, Ava left the hospital with her husband and baby making Alex wonder if he made a mistake. And Bailey didn't get chief resident, Callie did.

2813585,5,B000P6YNSO,"By the time season three of Grey's Anatomy started, I was already hooked onto it because of the phenominal writing and acting, but the soapy drama has also kept me watching. Season one showed that soap operas can be sophisticated and mature due to its strong stories. Season two did the same but cranked up the drama to a slightly higher level. It has remained the same now throughout the seasons. Season three ranks among the best television I have ever seen. The recurring plot lines included the battle for position of Chief Resident among Callie, Burke, Derek, etc., Izzie's depression after Denny's death, Addison trying to regain a relationship with Mark and her secret affair with Alex, Alex's secret obsession with a female patient who goes by the name Jane Doe, a Izzie/George/Callie love triangle, Meredith's constant struggle with her family, Christina and Burke's constant fighting. George's father becomes at risk of death while being admitted for surgery, which also reintroduces the bitter Dr. Erica Hahn as a rival to Burke. Derek and Meredith also continue to have a bumpy on-off relationship, while Chief Webber is possibly leaving as Chief of Surgery. Season three set the bar high enough to give the writers and producers stress about future seasons. Hopefully they will provide what I'm hoping for, but I'll have to see.",1219017600,,1341,5.017937219730942
2813586,5,B000P6YNSO,"The Third season of Grey's is so complex in its twisted story goodness! I loved the first two seasons, and I loved this one as well. There are many new conflicts as well as ones continuing from the previous story line. You know its a good tv show when you like the characters so much that even when they start going down a path you don't approve of, you keep watching, and not only that, you start talking to the tv screen to try to make them change.(Talking to the screen doesn't actually work...just for the heads up!!)

2813587,5,B000P6YNSO,"Let's face it, ER has died.  Grey's is the best medical drama out there today.  And while I was never a huge fan of medical drama, after catching a few early episodes, I was addicted.  Season 2 was only better.  FANTASTIC ending.  Season 3 was another solid season under the belt for Grey's.  I can't believe it's been 4 seasons already!

Yes, season 3 did have it's moments where you were annoyed at what a certain character was doing.  And for me it also took some time for some of the newer characters like Callie and McSteamy to grow on me.  But, they did due to the fact that all of these characters were given another season of great material and storylines.  It wasn't as exciting or Emmy worthy as Season 2, but it was still a great season.

If you haven't caught Grey's yet- it's really something you need to do.  You may be the last person on earth who hasn't seen the show yet!",1215561600,,888,4.283132530120482

Technique n. 2 - Surgery and Death! Everyone has highly improbable medical conditions, that somehow involve surgery, and it's not a simple surgery, it always involves the patient's heart stopping in the middle. Is it just me thinking that it's plain stupid that out of 5 surgery interns, one looses his father, the other her mother and stepmother and another one her fiancee, all in one year?!

Story arcs seem to drag on forever, like someone realized they needed nine episodes and decided to pad out three.  Also, it always seems that with a large cast, you're always wanting the focus to be on certain characters and all that happens is that the focus is on the other ones.  Sometimes Christina's mind games with Burke could get to be a little too much and all the time I'm wondering ""What about everyone else?""

Sandra Oh steals practically every scene she's in. And Ellen Pompeo plays ""Meredith"" right on. Katherine Heigl also is great (I don't think she is as outstanding as other cast members; she seems to get the awards though).

2813634,5,B000P6YNSO,"Complicated and unstable relationships, emotional conflicts, hard-to-believe cases, very indisciplined patients and competition - a lot of competition: that's the world of Seattle Grace Hospital shown in Grey's Anatomy. In television, sophisticated production and renowed actors may count, but no...that's not what makes a show unbeatable. The script, the story and the characters is what makes a winning show, and fortunately, Grey's Anatomy has this all in a very attractive way - the content, not the package, is what matters.

Running through all episodes of this third season, no one of them are to be disregarded. With no exception, they all are worth our time, as surprises and new astounding happenings unfold in each one, but there is a trio which makes this third season very distinguishable: ""Walk On Water"" (15), ""Drowning on Dry Land"" (16) and ""Some Kind of Miracle"" (17), all of three focused on Meredith's attempt of suicide (which in fact was initially caused by an accident) and that makes, for the time being, the most powerful set of episodes of the series history. All three together could make a movie! For more spoilers, don't forget to visit the abc.com website for the complete episode description. It's incredible how they manage to tell us ALMOST EVERYTHING that happens on each episode...but, seriously (huh?), watching it all on your DVD player will make a more pleasant experience.

We get to see a little more of the hilarious Dr Sydney Heron - brilliantly played by Kali Rocha, and we most definitely do not see nearly enough of the ""smouldering"" sex bomb that is Dr Alex Karev (Justin Chambers).  Some excellent episode cliff hangers and some quite spine chilling sequences when a character has a ""near death"" experience.  The on/off pairing of Meredith & McDreamy may eventually become a little tedious, but otherwise, roll on series 4!",1194652800,2,628,4.90566037735849

2813644,5,B000P6YNSO,Season three of Grey's Anatomy is best viewed in one go.  The story lines are brilliant but watching them a week apart would have driven me insane.  The relationships disected in this season were far more real than in the previous seasons.  Christina is finally looking at who she really is and what she really wants.  Izzie gets closure and maybe also learns about what makes her function.  Meredith and Derek have evolved into a regular couple with real issues to deal with rather than her holding him out as the impossible dream and him thinking that he is all there is for her.  I don't think that this was really the place to promote the spin off show for Addison and too much time was devoted to preparing us for that show.  This was an awesome season but buy the box set and set aside a long weekend to watch the entire season in one go or you will get bored.,1193788800,,866,4.308641975308642

2813648,2,B000P6YNSO,"New viewers during this season must be thinking ""what's all the fuss""? Season 3 is definitely not as good as season 1 and 2 were. We saw some glimpses of melodrama toward the end of season 2 but season 3 gets worse. Lack of acting ability starts to appear especially on behalf of Izzy (while mourning Denny) and George (while mouring his loss). And if I see Meredith sigh and frown one more time I will scream! I'm sticking with it because I heard it gets better. Let's hope so. Meredith's 'drowning' is ridiculous.

The season ends on a strange note, unfortunately due to Isian Washington's departure from the show. The good episodes are when McDreamy finally makes a decision about his relationships with Addison and Meridith, and McSteamy joining the cast permanantly. Eric Dane is a great addition to the show, and definitely nice eye candy. The show has great writing, and we'll see what Season Four has in store for us.",1192579200,,538,4.673684210526316

2813683,3,B000P6YNSO,"Yes, it's true that the third season of this medical drama didn't come close to achieving the highs of its second season. In fact, there are a few episodes in the third season I could have lived without. That said, Grey's Anatomy is still one of the best, most entertaining shows on tv.

The season starts off well with our beloved characters trapped in their usual situations; the Meredith/McDreamy love triangle, Addison's troubles at finding love, George's troubles dealing with his newfound love interest (Kali) and with his father's illness, Christina's problems with her romance with Burke. The season starts off well and offers incredible moments(the episodes where George deals with his father's death are incredible). And of course you can expect great strange medical cases that will baffle our doctors. But am I the only one who is constantly annoyed with Izzie? Her character is winy, selfish and way to emotional. Her storyline never interested me in the least. Sure she was affected by her fiance's death. But after watching her mope and moan for nearly 5 episodes, I just wanted to slap some sense into her.

Unfortunately, the show veers in the wrong direction halfway through the season. Meredith's near-death experience is laughable and unnecessary. She almost dies, then goes back to work the very next week? And what about the episode that also served as the pilot for Addison's new show? Her short stay in LA put a stop to things and stalled the show.

It's a good thing the show redeems itself in its last three episodes. Christina's upcoming wedding and Meredith's dealing with her mother's death and troubled relationship with her father are what makes this show worth seeing. Yes its overtly dramatic at times, but I'm not watching Grey's Anatomy fo find realism.

I'm anticipating the new seaon with the hopes that the producers will have learned from their mistakes to bring this show back to its prior greatness.",1191801600,,1940,4.96

2813693,4,B000P6YNSO,"the bad (and there are many):

1.  the private practice part...yes, i understand it's a part of the introduction spinoff but it was SOOOO badly placed.  too much development in a plot.  in the end, addison doesn't even say she's actually going to leave to LA.  we're just randomly told that she leaves, no goodbye to the audience and cast.  i LOVE addison so it felt very incomplete without a goodbye.

2.  the completely out of place episode of meredith in the afterlife.  it was nice to see the past memorable characters but c'mon, WAY out of place.  this is a doctor's show, not some weird third dimensional thing - very unrealistic.  and i HATED how meredith and her mother did not have closure.  t.v. is supposed to get u away from real life drama. to see that everything will worked out properly gives us hope that in our own ""dark and twisty"" lives it will also.  though i am glad to see ellis grey go, she was too annoying of a character, even if she added depth to the plot.

3.  uh, hello, didn't izzy's ""beloved"" fiance, the guy that leaves her 8.7 MILLION DOLLARS, JUST die a few months before she sleeps with married george?  this twist really made me hate izzy and how she treats callie.  she constantly declares her love for george - annoying.

4.  to add to the out of place plot even more, george and callie get married.  WHY WHY WHY?????? would they do that?  doesn't make any damn sense!  at least burke and christina getting married makes sense.  they were together for a couple years.  but for burke to push christina to marry him and randomly leave is disgusting.  it did make me feel for christina but we all know the only reason he was rushed off like that is because of that comment he made about homosexuals.  burke's character will be truly missed.

5.  meredith and mcdreamy need to just stay together.  it's getting old, the bouncing back and forth thing.

6.  everyone needs to stop sleeping with each other so much.  didn't they all just get syphilis in the last season???

the good (there are some):

1.  loved the slap from meredith's father.  my mouth dropped at that point!

2.  the show is still 100% addictive (except the private practice part - i started to stare more at the ceiling than the screen).  i def. tuned into season 4 on thurs.

3.  it still has heart and comedy (albeit, not as much laughing as 1 & 2).  like i said, burke leaving christina made me wanna cry for her.  glad the cheif isn't leaving.

4.  the actors are still wonderful, convincing AND gorgeous (eye candy!)

season 4:  i can't stand meredith's sister.  why would u pick the moment that people are dying to announce that you are her sister?  her character seems stupid as all hell.  let's see how that works out. but it does seem it has turned back into quirky and hilarious-ness.  loved when izzy asks bailey about a deer's anatomy and bailey responds with ""not my interns anymore, not my business"" and rushes off.  hope season 4 is going to be great!",1191283200,2,2968,4.462546816479401

The second season was just as good.  But this third season, what did they do to us viewers?  I had a hard time watching it.  The writers, in my opinion were ruining the show.  However, when I bought this DVD collection that opinion changed a bit.  If you watch the DVDs they are as advertised, seriously extended and this was what I needed.  Also it helps to not see any commercials.  So this is a must for any Grey's Anatomy fan.  I still believe the show ""jumped the shark"" this past third season.  With Addison moving to a spin-off, Burke off the show and how the writers ""messed up"" George's character (would he really be with 2 women, much less cheat on his wife---that's not him) who could argue with me?

2813697,4,B000P6YNSO,"*Possible spoilers within.*

Oh, how the mighty have fallen.  Last week, the season premiere of ""C.S.I."" trumped the premiere of ""Grey's Anatomy""'s fourth season by a significant margin.  That's because ""Grey's Anatomy,"" a series which once shined so vibrantly, has been reduced to a dull glimmer.  Throughout the series' first two seasons, it seemed incredible that a show could maintain such a level of greatness and be so addictive without going off the tracks every once in a while.

But come Season Three, the show did crash.  Big time.

Truth be told, Season Three wasn't as bad as some will lead you to believe.  The first half of the season was uniformly great.  It wasn't until the midpoint, during an arc involving a ferry boat crash, that, ironically, the show crashed as well.  In a painfully obvious attempt to garner higher ratings, the writers decided to have Meredith ""die.""  Creator Shonda Rhimes is a big fan of Joss Whedon's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""; one can only surmise that Ms. Rhimes thought she could handle character deaths as gracefully as Whedon.  (She couldn't, but in her defense, not many can.)  Instead, Meredith's near-death experience - complete with visions of the afterlife, highlighted by the reappearance of Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the irresistible Denny Duquette - seems entirely unnecessary.  The actors' straight-faced performances during that storyline just makes the whole thing more hilarious.  Re-watching the episodes, it's apparent that the writers realized their mistakes after having made them, but were left with no choice but to make the best of them.  One would expect them to deal with whatever problems they've created and then keep moving on.  Instead, they took one enormous mis-step after another.  The biggest of these, perhaps even surpassing the idea to ""kill"" Meredith, was the decision to make Izzie (Katherine Heigl) sleep with George (T.R. Knight).  The result was the most unbearably grotesque ""romance"" of the year, an inconceivable concept made all the more nonsensical by the fact that, only a few episodes before, George had suddenly married Callie (Sara Ramirez).

On top of the seemingly ceaseless crimes being committed by the writers, the second part of the season was overshadowed by the infamous conflict between leads Isaiah Washington and Patrick Dempsey, in which Washington heatedly called T.R. Knight a homosexual slur.  The incident was blown way out of proportion by a bloodthirsty media, bringing Washington's slur to the forefront and trying to bury his repeated subsequent apologies, which they did quite well.  Unfortunately, Rhimes decided that this was worth dismissing Washington from the series, and so, in the uncharacteristically disappointing season finale, Burke just ups and leaves, during the middle of his wedding to Christina (Sandra Oh).  It was a terrible, terrible, incredibly foolish waste of one of the series' most interesting characters and most charismatic actors, and a perfectly wretched finish (hopefully) to a number of wretched mistakes.

The season wasn't all bad, though.  The pre-ferry half was actually excellent.  The writers came up with typically fascinating developments and very amusing scenarios.  One could sense, however, that they were feeling the pressure of being the most-watched show on television after two phenomenal seasons.  There was noticeably more drama and less comedy.  Before deciding to pseudo-kill Meredith, the writers concocted a number of interesting twists, the majority revolving around Mark Sloan (the inimitable Eric Dane), who joined the regular cast at the start of the season.  That was an obvious and very smart move on the producers' part, because Dane added just the extra spark the season needed.  Sloan's presence resulted in some major (and delicious) character development for Alex Karev (Justin Chambers).  Karev had previously been the show's ""bad boy,"" but with Dane filling his shoes (and needing an even bigger pair), Karev gradually evolved into not just a decent guy, but a caring, honorable, and very likable one, though he held on to enough of his hard edge to remain Alex Karev.  Karev was also given two of the season's most interesting storylines: a brief and lighthearted romance with Addison (Kate Walsh), as well as the ""Jane Doe"" storyline, in which Karev discovers a pregnant woman deformed and amnesiac from the ferry crash.

At the season's end, one is left exasperated, exhausted, frustrated, and bewildered, but not entirely unsatisfied.  As a whole, the season is evenly great and bad, but even when it's bad, ""Grey's Anatomy"" is better than most series.  The writers made a lot of mistakes toward the end of the season, and they'll have a hard time clearing them up during Season Four.  It's uncertain whether the series will ever be as stunning as it was during Seasons One and Two, but if one can look past the misguided writing in Season Three, it's clear that the show still has what it needs to be great.  Here's hoping the good doctors at Seattle Grace can put the show back together again.",1191110400,15,5076,5.152625152625153
2813698,4,B000P6YNSO,"I agree with most here that this season was not as great as the 2nd season, however, I still did enjoy it... and I do love the show. I love the all characters, especially George and Izzie (favorites from the start in season 1)... and love that this show can make you feel so many different things all within one episode. If you are a big fan of the show then I would definitely buy this season too.. The one thing I did not like about this season was Meredith at the end. Pulling away from Derrek just to me seems so silly, after all they went through to be together. That to me was very disappointing.. Other than that, maybe a few things here and there, but still a wonderful show and incredible cast.",1190592000,,703,4.214814814814815
2813699,3,B000P6YNSO,"Still a great show, but not nearly as good as the first two seasons. Way too many strange plot twists, and a lot of story lines that just seem to drag out. The Derek/Merideth thing has bounced back and forth so much its starting to get annoying. Also, it seems to me like the writers felt they had to make every episode into a ""season finale""...there's never a slow moment throughout the season...almost literally. I understand this appeal, but it became a little to much for me. Addison's side trip to LA irked me, along with quite a few other people as well it seems...it felt like two waaay out of place episodes (though I understand it was a pseudo-pilot for Addison's new show, Private Practice; can't say that I'll watch it). The everyone sleeping with everyone thing got a little out of hand too...so many people have been involved with each other that there isn't much more room to expand realistically, which has caused quite a few shows to end in the past. All that's left is for Alex, Burke and George to start a love triangle. All in all, a good season, but not up to par with the previous. One last thing...I've seen at least one person post a question about this...Grey's Anatomy is a spinoff of Gray's Anatomy, by Henry Gray...considered the basic anatomy textbook for Doctors.

However, I quickly completed the 3rd season on DVD, and I can honestly say the ability to watch one after the other (without commercial breaks) is a vastly rewarding experience. What might have seemed intolerable on TV (such as Izzie's moping at the beginning of the season) doesn't seem as drawn out when watched in succession.

2813706,5,B000P6YNSO,"Okay, so I, like many other people, believe that Grey's Anatomy Season 3 had some problems, or rather...strange plot twists. For example, George's sudden Vegas marriage, the Gizzie-gate, and the Ferry arc.

After rewatching almost all of this season (I've watched up to ""The Other Side Of This Life"" I realized that taken once a week with brief hiatuses between four and five episode blocks just doesn't work. It's erratic and everything seems to move a lot slower, not to mention a lot seems out of nowhere. Yet, watching these episodes one after another reawakened my original love at its basest form for Season 3.

In my eyes, Season 3 has 3 arcs: One that goes from ""Time Has Come Today""  to ""Six Days"". This deals with Meredith/Derek/Finn and then Meredith/Derek/Mark and Addison/Mark and Callie/George and Izzie dealing with the loss of Denny. The second arc seems to be ""Great Expectations"" up to ""Some Kind of Miracle"" which, as many know, is the last episode of the ferry arc. A lot of people saw this as the beginning of a whole separate arc but story-wise this just concludes a hell of a lot that had been boiling (including Meredith's mother). The third arc, consisting of ""Scars and Souvenirs"" up to ""Didn't We Almost Have It All?"" starts off drastically different. It has a different feel then almost everything we've seen all season. It mentions what happened with the ferry and the water but other then that we move on. That is, onto a whole new storyline dealing with infidelity and relationship doubts all around as well as Jane Doe.

I appreciated this season so much more without commercials and mostly without interruptions. I, somehow, even saw George and Izzie coming (even from back in the Season 2 episode, ""The Name of the Game"") but that means that Shonda didn't completely pull the rug out from under us. And on this rewatch I find myself pulling for George and Izzie...weird, right?

Seeing it all in one block is like putting a jig-saw puzzle together, quickly, instead of taking the time to find the missing pieces all over your house, to use that metaphor. And yes, Grey's Anatomy has a much more clear direction, style, just...everything.

So, on the television, Grey's Anatomy Season 3 was very static and bi-polar at times. On DVD it's level-headed and checking out of that psych ward.

5 stars, seriously.",1189900800,9,2341,4.794044665012407
2813707,5,B000P6YNSO,"""Grey's Anatomy"" is the best show on television.  It is the perfect mix of drama and comedy.  Every single episode draws you in and it gives the best season finales of any show I've ever seen.  The characters are all rich and in some way completely screwed up, except for the thread that holds it all together, Dr. Bailey.  The no nonsense, tough but kind Dr. Bailey is definitely at the center of the show.  With so many in the cast it would normally be impossible to make every storyline interesting but somehow they manage to do it week after week.  You're never thinking ""I wish they would just get back to the star.""  Every character draws you in. Greatest show since ""Friends""!",1189728000,2,683,4.504065040650406

Season 3 goes from bad to worse. Ellen Pompeo is probably the most annoying, lifeless person they could've picked to do the show. She just irritates me beyond belief. She can't act, and she always looks weird. Izzie used to be my favorite character but she started acting stupid and immature in season 3. George became more whiney. He married Callie (I do like her character but that was totally on a whim and seemed like a terrible idea). I still love Christina. I'm really over McDreamy, he's not that dreamy and he thinks he's all that when really he's just kind of blah.

I've seen the commercials for season 4 and it just seems that they're going to re do the meredith-derek story with meredith's half sister. And without Dr. Burke in the story I really don't know if I'm going to watch the show.

All in all season 3 just show cases the worst in the characters personalities, they all act more whiney, more immature, more catty. The story line is overly dramatic.

And that really happens to everyone. Would Grey's Anatomy be the same if the charactors would be happy all the tim? Without stress, problems and mistakes? I don't think that we'd rather see two dimensional characters. I am not sure why many people do write those bad reviews, but just watch those episodes, because they speak for themselves.

I believe this season, the theme was that fairytales don't always have a happy-ending.  That life isn't going to be perfect and things aren't going to work out just because you hope it does.  There was a lot of miscommunication or not at all.  Perhaps Season 4 will change things up a bit.

I do not think ""Kate Walsh"" would have been given a spin off this soon had the producers forseen the baffling homophobic remark ""Isaih Washington"" made, not once but twice, helped sever his job (thus the end of an intiguing character, ""Dr. Bruke"".) How will the upcoming season look without ""the she shepard"" or ""Dr. Burke"" and possibly ""T.R Knight.""

I love Grey's Anatomy, I am completely addicted. I think Shonda Rhimes has created an amazing and enthralling show. But, this season I was not as drawn in as in the other two. I no longer raced to get home after class to watch the episodes; they just stayed on my Tivo for days.

All the characters were on a downward spiral. Relationships were stretched to what could be a point of no return. Characters became needier, more damaged. Some characters shined. I loved Addison's character even more. We all hated Addison at the beginning of the second season. But, we grew to love her for her fighting spirit and for being so honest. I also love Callie. She is such a feisty Latina. She is strong, willful and so damn vulnerable in the area of love. (George, how dare you!) As a Hispanic, I appreciate that she was not typecast as a poor struggling Hispanic trying to make it through school to prove she has ""made it in America"". Instead, she is, as we recently learned, she grew up wealthy and George's part of the hotel ""rent"" was the tip she gave the hotel staff. That scene was very funny. I admire that Shonda Rhimes has refused to typecast minorities, or for that matter, the majority. As she so vividly portrays, race, religion or cultural background should have no place in love or career advancement. Burke and Christina made a phenomenal interracial couple and yet their race was never an impediment in their relationship. Rather, their lively competition and variety of quirks played an important role in how they carried their relationship.

Some couples were formed and some were broken this season. I think that Addison and Alex were never given a real chance. They could have been a great and interesting couple. Izzie and George were pathetic (again, poor Callie). I do not like this pairing as a couple, they were great friends. I would like to see them end as a romantic relationship and try to move back to the friendship they used to have. I like Callie and I love the job Sara Ramrez has done with the character of Callie. Callie is one of the few characters that have not become completely pathetic.

Meredith entered an even more self destructive collision course with life. She does not feel that she is worthy of love. In her own words, she considers herself as ""damaged"". I feel for her. Her character has taken quite a beating. McDreamy leaves her in Season 2 for Addison, she feels her mom never loved her and her father was never a presence in her life. The only person who has truly tried to create a relationship with Meredith, that was not a total fiasco, was her step-mother. Meredith was finally able to start trusting and maybe even relying on someone. Yet, when she dies, her father blames and hits her. Meredith's spirit is just broken, no wonder she did not want to fight her way out of the freezing water. Can we blame her? Derek has not been as supportive as he should be; after all, he is at least partly responsible for the state she is in. The strong, slightly vulnerable but just as playful McDreamy was nowhere to be found. Thank God for McSteamy, just watching him was enough to make my day.

George doesn't even know what he wants. He married Callie and then sleeps with Izzie. I hate this pairing. Burke? He just couldn't deal with being number 1 in Christina's life, with not being in her every thought.

I hated the episode in which Addison went to CA, it was not good at all. I am a fan of Judging Amy, and I was looking forward to watching Amy Brenneman. Yet, this episode seems a little goofy, crazy and as if the writers had been reading Nietzsche while high on LSD. The characters were not engaging, their problems were not captivating and neither were their crazy personnas. Addison was acting in a way I had never seen her before. She seemed a little crazy, more out of control. Where was the assertive, yet vulnerable, Addison?

The plots of several episodes seemed forced and overly dramaticized (they were grasping for a plot in the storyline after Meredith's drowning). The plots also seem hurried and were not allowed to develop. I suggest that they should spend a little more time writing and editing these episodes. The writers may say that the characters have a life of their own but the writers are holding the pen! So pull them in and give them something worth fighting and living for.",1187913600,60,4370,4.580562659846548

I didn't become a fan until after watching both the first and second seasons on dvd and by then, the show was about a month or so into the third season.  I watched faithfully almost every week (even the repeats), but this season was much different from the last two.

Part of the reason that I loved Grey's Anatomy so much was that it was able to make me laugh, cry, and think, especially about the relationships in my own life.  Unfortunately there isn't a lot to laugh about in season three.  I don't recall any particularly inspiring moments either.  The show has become a soap opera.  A very well written and acted out soap, but it is what it is.  In addition to that, the fact that some of our most beloved characters either won't be (or appear to not be) returning, and the whole Isaiah Washington business that no one would just let blow over have soured me towards the show even more.

I disliked season three so much that I am sadly tempted to get rid of my seasons one and two DVDs, even though I loved those seasons.  People were childish and annoying.  There were times that I wanted to shake Izzie and tell her to get over herself, and although I did like Denny and was sad at his death, she needed to stop moping and move on.  Then, of course, she slept with George, who had make the possible mistake of marrying Callie on a whim.  Plus, Addison moved to San Diego or wherever, and everyone there was acting like annoying and idiotic high schoolers--not much different from Seattle Grace.

Overall, it was an extremely dissatisfying season for a number of different reasons.  I have stopped keeping up with the show for the most part.

I don't know that I can ever watch this show again.",1185148800,70,1119,4.315789473684211
2813741,5,B000P6YNSO,"I too am a fan of Grey's Anatomy and felt that season 3 was well done in some ways while it lacked in others.  I will definitely be buying the DVD set as soon as it is out.  Yes, it is an emotional show at times but I think that adds depth-- and all of the instances in the show are parallels to true life (the medical cases)!  That's the best part.  As for my own thoughts (read at your own discretion)...

For one, I think the producers have done an interesting (and admirable) job of character development.  Most notably with Alex.  I was just watching Season 1 yesterday and he has done a real 180-- he seems to have developed (relatively) a sense of poise, self-respect, and direction.  I was disappointed that he and Addison didn't work out-- but then again, she wasn't really in a position for a relationship.  I'm still waiting for Alex to have a meaningful relationship with someone so we find out more about his troubled past!  Comon!  And then Alex's heart needs to be broken so that he is forced to depend on someone for support so we can see him as an even better person.

I do not agree with the love triangle of George-Callie-Izzie.  Yes because of the fidelity thing but more than that, the whole Callie and George wedding was totally out of nowhere. NEITHER character as the producers have developed them would have wed under the conditions.  And I don't think they were suddenly breaking out of their shells to be spontaneous and change their lives in a previously unknown direction-- Callie post-wedding is still herself and George is a wimping puppy worse than ever.  This whole story line is a weird mess.  George has lost his halo, and Izzie remains confused and STILL with her heart on her sleeve. And then there is Callie... ??  Here's what needs to happen: Callie-George marriage needs to be over.  The relationship is doomed with the Izzie-George-cheating plot.  George needs to NOT leave Seattle Grace, instead he should re-do his intern year where perhaps a romance will develop between him and Meredith's half-sister.  Izzie can do better than George-- let's hope she does in Season 4.

The whole Cristina/Burke wedding came out of nowhere-- but that kind of follows their relationship-- ie. Season 2: suddenly out of nowhere Burke and Cristina are moving in together? Hello? Did I miss something?  They have only known one another a few months!  Realistic? No. (Yea I know it's just a TV show)... more importantly: realistic to Cristina/Burke characters? Not in my opinion.  ALSO, Burke needs to be re-hired to continue with the show.  Although I don't agree with what went on with Mr. Washington-- he truly is an integral character to the show.  He was one of my favorite characters-- but I know I'm not the producers.  Predictions: Hopefully Burke will return.  Cristina needs to gain some rank as a resident... skip the relationship stuff (but add in a little here and there because her awkwardness is seriously entertaining)-- she would be awesome if developed as Bailey's protege, in my opinion.  Driven, intelligent-- but she's lacking Bailey's family/bedside manner side.  We know her soft side is there-- remember Season 2 when she goes to Idaho with Bailey and can't stop staring at her pregnant tummy?  Yup that spark is there!

The center of it all-- Meredith and Derek I think are... continually in turmoil.  They are both heart broken... but again, I think this plot will continue the way it has from the beginning.  One pinches the other and then the other pinches the other back like two children... blah blah.  Derek should give up the whole ""I'm disappointed in you because you wanted to drown and therefore we aren't meant to be together"" thing and either be a man and be supportive OR make a clean break and move on (We know that won't happen).  Something interesting needs to happen between the two that is interesting and puts some sort of solidity in either one of their lives.  They did have the dog, but that was short lived.  Prediction for Season 4: Derek is going to be going out to the bars and meeting more women (as he told Meredith during Season 3)-- either going to start a relationship WHILE he is still with Meredith OR ... well who knows.

Addison?  Wrong character it pick to start a new series... To the credit of the producers, the idea works.  But it is blatantly for more viewers, siphoning off Grey's audience. Tsk, tsk.  Predictions: It will do well initially but fall off quickly-- I didn't think it was that interesting when it was incorporated into Grey's.  I found myself wanting the plot to get back to Seattle Grace instead of on Addison's escape-joy-ride-vacation-turn-job elsewhere.

Nonetheless, it can't always turn out the way you want it, that's what makes the show (and life) entertaining-- can't wait for Season 4!",1184803200,5,4800,4.717548076923077

I am a huge fan, but I was tempted to stop watching this season.  First of all, after season 2's Denny and Lizzie's ordeal, it was really hard going through another tragedy with George's dad.

I absolutely do not agree with this Izzie-George-Callie triangle.  It's just not credible.  Izzie is just too heartbroken to even think of George in this way.  I would advise the  writers to pull back on this one.

I absolutely hate the Burke/Christina storyline.  I know they fired Washington (Burke), but they are losing a major character and an important element of the show.  From the stories that have come out, the guy was probably a jerk, and has anger problems, but with all the money ABC makes they could have paid for counseling, and should have kept him on for the sake of the show and the fans.  I  don't know how they are going to make up for his absence.  ABC, YOU SHOULD HAVE WORKED IT OUT.

I hate that Montgomery-Shepard (McDreamy's ex) is leaving the show for a spinoff series.  I love her character and would love to see it develop more on Grey.  ABC, STOP BEING SO GREEDY.

I am totally against the direction they are taking with Meredith and Derek.  After all he went through when she was ""dead""....come on.  They belong together.
