8198878,5,B000R52QVY,"It's too bad this series hasn't been officially released with English language subtitles because it is a wonderful drama. Running 10 episodes, it's about a young woman gourmet chef, daughter of a recently deceased gourmet chef who worked at a 4-star French restaurant in Japan. Though not a trained chef herself, the daughter has a superior knack for extraordinary cooking, and together with several friends, opens a bistro-style upscale restaurant. As a result of her superb skills, the restaurant changes to a custom cuisine restaurant, wherein reservations for only one customer are taken, the woman interviews the guest to learn something significant in his or her life, and prepares an extraordinary haute cuisine meal reflecting those emotional significances in the guests life. As such, the drama becomes a series of mini-dramas revolving around the lives of the various guests. An absolutely wonderful show. The characters are more than likeable, the tone of the show is inspiring. Perhaps someday, this will be made available with English subtitles. For those who can understand the native Japanese or the Chinese subtitles, and can find a copy of this somewhere, I more than heartily recommend it as the likeable, comfortable television programming rarely seen coming from Hollywood. You may want to search video import sites, or cdjapan.co.jp for availablity of this or an alternate edition.",1262908800,2,1402,5.34841628959276
