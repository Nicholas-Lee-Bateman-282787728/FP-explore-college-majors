3937530,5,B002IW8V0O,"How can two struggling brothers save their family farm?  By calling in an ""accountant"".  Enter an almost cartoonish-looking Ray McKinnon (who also wrote and directed the film).  What follows is a moving, hilarious and sometimes sad look at how drastically life has changed in the South and wonders whether we are better off for the change.  Watch this movie.  Seriously good short film.",1275955200,3,386,5.063492063492063
3937531,5,B002IW8V0O,"This dark comedy gives a unique glimpse into a rural mindset that holds onto traditional values. I first saw it at a seminar put on by an accountant...I kid you not.

It's a real gem of a short movie. McKinnon rocks. You might remember him as the football coach on The Blind Side or the preacher in Deadwood.",1270944000,,308,4.310344827586207
3937532,5,B002IW8V0O,"A co-worker introduced this farm comedy to me and I loved every minute of it.  A very clever farm comedy that won an Oscar in 2002!  The film was intended to be an extended preview to be followed by a full-length movie.  Since the film won an Oscar in 2002 for Best Short Film, a full-length movie was not created.  Great film for anyone!",1260316800,,338,4.234375

3937536,5,B002IW8V0O,"Really don't review movies much because I believe people's taste in entertainment is too diversified for me to judge what they may or may not like. In the case of this production, an satirical statement of what life has become for small farmers in America. I voice an affirmative opinion. It's a well acted and makes a point. I recommend watching it as an awaking to how far America has fallen.",1516492800,,394,4.563380281690141

3937545,5,B002IW8V0O,A very good short film that makes very important points about the world. Pay attention to what the accountant says. He is a lot wiser than he seems. His ideas about the world are unfortunately true. That is part of the way this world works. The rest is in the Bible since there is another world or realm out there. It is the Spiritual world and it corresponds to God's plan.,1511308800,,374,4.28169014084507

3937549,5,B002IW8V0O,"Excellent movie!... couldn't believe that it is only 37 minutes long.  Completely absorbing plot will have you focused on every detail.  I guess that's one of the benefits of a short film... no time for the fluff.  The plot twist at the end comes unexpectedly.  Great plot, excellent story telling, and the characters are all extremely rich.

3937552,1,B002IW8V0O,"Depressing as hell, really. Plight of the rural farmer and gives insight into how they can do the unthinkable  because they've been backed into a corner. Did not find it funny at all. Could be the political climate, but it just made me despair. Ugh. Plus, why did the accountant have weird whiteface makeup? And the drinking was supposed to be funny, but made me want to tell him to go to AA.",1503100800,,392,4.36986301369863
3937553,5,B002IW8V0O,"My wife and I were coming off a weird mood from having just watching an upsetting, artsy foreign film called ""The Untamed"" and were looking to for a pick-me-up when we discovered this little gem. It was perfect! I kept thinking to myself how great this would be to read as a short story as well. There are just three characters, no fancy camera work, and its set against a simple backdrop that could be nearly any farm in the south. However, this made me feel both pride as a southerner and simple joy in the conviction of the characters. It is a thinking man's comedy. It is a southern story. It is awesome.",1501804800,,608,4.342105263157895
3937554,5,B002IW8V0O,Very well made and pretty great movie. It plants the seeds of thinking beyond the superficial appearances and ultimately the end justifies the means.,1501286400,,149,5.25
3937555,5,B002IW8V0O,"I really enjoyed this movie but I wasn't expecting what I watched or how short it was.  Still I recommend it to anyone that doesn't mind watching something a bit different.  It's only about 30 minutes long, take the time and enjoy yourself!",1498003200,,240,4.558139534883721

3937558,5,B002IW8V0O,"Ray McKinnon is superb in this funny, dark story of two brothers trying to save the family farm. McKinnon plays the accountant who suggests a crime as a financial way out. His performance is supported by Walton Goggins and Edie King, both of whom are fine, but the movie ultimately belongs to McKinnon who also wrote and directed the film. This wry, perfect movie contains some sharp political commentary but does not preach. So glad I took a chance and purchased this little known gem.
 McKinnon and Goggins made another movie together, ""Randy and the Mob"", which is also very entertaining and off beat. I hope their partnership continues for a long time.",1460505600,3,656,4.8053097345132745

3937570,5,B002IW8V0O,"This.  Is.  Amazing.  It's laugh out loud funny.  Writer, director, star McKinnon is fantastic. Goggins and King are fantastic.  It's quirky as hell and McKinnon's performance as The Accountant is one you'll not forget.  Take 40 minutes out of your life and watch this.  At under ten bucks this a no-brainer blind buy for anyone who is a big fan of McKinnon or Goggins.  And the dialogue...Hilarious!!!

The music is great.  The songs that bookend the film (Jimmie Dale Gilmore with ""Mack the Knife"" at the beginning and Michael Hurley's ""I Paint a Design"" at the end) are perfect.  What's even wilder than everything else is the film has a message and it's beautifully delivered.  I'm thoroughly impressed.  As a Southerner, it's comforting to find something this good and honest that deals with being a Southerner.  Films that try are usually filled with stereotypes with bad accents.  These three men nailed it in such a way I've never seen before and it's refreshing.

My only complaint about this DVD is that it does not have a single extra.  It's just the film with chapter stops.  A commentary track would have been a nice bonus.  Still, the film is highly entertaining on its own and is worth the few bucks I paid for it.  Fans of any of these three guys should not be disappointed in this.",1402617600,15,1298,4.65929203539823
3937571,5,B002IW8V0O,"After hearing how great this short film was, I decided to pick this up. Glad I did. Ray McKinnon gives a heck of a performance. On the 2nd & 3rd times watching, I picked up details I didn't catch before... great writing.",1399766400,,220,4.261904761904762
3937572,5,B002IW8V0O,"There's no denying the quirky charm that recommends this little picture.  'The Accountant' is crafted with love and a smile.  And the affection for the land that fuels its wobbly but sincere rant against multinational corporations can get us cheering.  But don't just think this movie succeeds because it's whimsical or populist or inspired silliness.  It is much, much more clever than that.

Tommy and David are the Brothers O'Dell, watching the family farm unravel into debt and drag down with it their sense of identity.  Helpful Tommy has found a professional, a man who can twist fate, a mysterious accountant who will steer the land and their books back into balance.

But the brothers may be out of their depth as the man armed with the pencil is revealed as a sort of mathematical mercenary.  As the bleak tightness of their corner becomes apparent, as the pressure grinds down and the brothers begin to buckle, their professional figure fighter bares his philosophy and lays out his true mission: a guerrilla war against the machinery of corporate world domination.  And there will be a tremendous price paid to put things right.

Call it ""farm noir"".  This movie would already be terrific if the dark horribleness underlying what we've thought we've been watching weren't tossed in front of us in the final act.  It's a rare film whose every shot could be framed and hung as art, as Blake Britton Jackson's cinematography can be, here.  There's a care given to the sound and pacing, a slow, firm hand to the movie that is professional to the point of elegance; it's that well made.  But that same steady hand of jolly Director Ray McKinnon is squeezing us all the while, unnoticed, while we're suckered in by the fun and games.  We're so caught in the well-crafted goofiness of the picture, so amused by the questionable sanity of the accountant and warmed by the film's eager sincerity, it's easy for McKinnon to pull off his virtuoso deception:  We dismiss the imbalance, the whiff of erotic tension, the scheming and hidden motives that utterly invert the identity of this film.  The revelation, what's really been going on, is so subtle we want to keep chuckling and step right over it, even when it's finally dropped in front of us, plain as day.  Sure, the final scenes make only a silly,  minimal sense.  Isn't that in keeping with the absurdity of the entire film?  Or do they?  Which of these men knows the real deal?  Whose agenda is playing out, here?  Did somebody just get away with something?  Or just get played?  In forty short minutes this film rises easily to the ranks of 'L.A. Confidential' or 'The Usual Suspects' or even 'Chinatown'.  We think it's an understated picture and a very good little film.  In fact, it's also been lying to our faces and it is brilliant.  This is one of the better movies I've seen in many years.

Is there really something going on, something dark, just behind what we think we're seeing?  Or are we being hoodwinked?  Is this a conspiracy?  Or is it all part of life's uncertainty, four-point-five percent, either way?

Maybe it's ""Just a coincidence"".",1396656000,,3115,4.75
3937577,5,B002IW8V0O,"Easy to see why it was an Oscar winner.  Very glad that I bought it.  I'm a huge Walton Goggins fan, which was why I got it, and he wasn't really a big part of the movie.  Still loved it!  I'm surprised that you don't hear much about Eddie King.  He was terrific as was Ray McKinnon.",1393977600,2,283,3.8947368421052633

3937583,5,B002IW8V0O,"What is almost an extended comedy skit is surprisingly prescient in it vision and analysis of the economic disaster being unleashed upon the American people.  While the trappings presented are those of rural farmers and a backwoods accountant, the explores the core issues cancerous corporatism, self-determination, and the media created nightmare of the American Dream.

I saw this after the housing bubble burst in 2008 and the American economy started swirling down the toilet.  It is at once both satiric and sobering, and should shame anyone with a credit card or a home mortgage with an unpaid balance.  And yet for as much moral instruction as the movie provides, I can most heartily recommend it for its humor and compassion.",1299542400,,733,5.083333333333333

8371267,4,B002IW8V0O,"From what I can see, this film was released in 2017 by Sony. It is now having a re-release under Lightyear.

I generally review musicals or mysteries or PBS series here on Amazon but since Im also a CPA (Certified Public Accountant), it peaked my interest just from the title.

Itd a black comedy that is not unlike Coen Brothers films (O Brother Where Art Thou comes to mind.) Its a caricature of southern farmers who are trying to keep their farm. The film  which won an Oscar for best short fiction film  is just 38 minutes so I won't tell you much. The accountant in the title is more of a financial advisor who arrives to help two brothers who are losing their farm to the large mortgage companies and might have to do SERIOUS things to keep them from losing it. Actor Ray McKinnon (who was in O Brother) wrote, directed and stars in this film. His wife is actress Lisa Blount (who Executive Directed it and designed the costumes!).

It took a while to get into it but then I started laughing. It is funny and quirky.
Be aware that there are no bonus features. There are chapter stops but not a chapter menu.

The DVD does have a trailer for another McKinnon film, but I found that one just stupid. The Accountant is worth seeing.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
