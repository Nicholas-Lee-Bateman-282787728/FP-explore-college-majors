6756335,5,B00OMCLNEE,"This is probably the most important film that has been released in the last decade.  Listen to the Mama's, they know what you are experiencing in life, and they know the way for our society to progress to a higher level of awareness and intelligence.  It is not that we must ask them for advice about the nitty gritty, just listen to their message and apply to ourselves.",1416700800,7,371,4.4411764705882355

6756337,5,B00OMCLNEE,"ALUNA

thank you so much for this wonderful and important work, giving a chance to let the KOGI speak to the world in their own original way to address to us, the younger brother.

we can and we should learn a lot from our elder brother and we really should take their warnings serious.

living angels, spirits, messangers from another time, another world, another connection with our planet, mankind, living beings...

whom are we going to listen to, if not them?!",1414022400,9,465,4.703703703703703
6756338,5,B00OMCLNEE,"This is not only a truly remarkable film, but it carries an extraordinarily powerful and critical message that is necessary for humanity at this time. We are being asked, deeply, from the heart, what are we really here to do? And what are we prepared to bring forth in ourselves in such a way that we recover and maintain the integrity--in the way that they do--of what we are capable of? This tribe, these messengers, are wisdom carriers that most of us have forgotten could possibly even exist because we've gone so far from the natural ways of functioning. But they are here to remind us of what we've missed, and how we all have a crucial role to play in the revival of our world. They do this through showing us clearly how they see it, how the energetic organization of nature must be cohesive and coordinated, and that humans play an important role in sustaining that. But they do not merely show us that so we can idolize them or talk about how great it is that there are people like them doing good things; no, I believe they have put out this message so that we each can engage in the process of looking at ourselves and discern whether or not we are doing the best we can and if we are prepared to face the things in ourselves which have led to the current situation. They want us to awaken and focus with intent on what is real, what is so obvious that we have avoided seeing, and what is so extraordinary about this immense creation that we must cherish and commit to serving.",1413849600,28,1489,4.359712230215828
6756349,5,B00OMCLNEE,"Marvelous storytelling. Instructive and necessary. This film brings the viewer to a place where man's technological advances may acknowledge proven ancient wisdom rather than contesting or disparaging it. Absolutely wonderful. The Kogi Mamas are implacable and stately; and in spite of their apparent political powerlessness, what comes across is this undeniable authority that they seem to exhibit with regard to the environment and ""civilized"" man's irresponsible tenure on the planet.",1472515200,,487,5.9714285714285715

6756354,5,B00OMCLNEE,Very insightful and humbling. A MUST WATCH FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO HEAR IT FROM THOSE WHO ARE TRULY IN TUNE WITH MOTHER NATURE. This warning from them is a warning for ALL ! Whether one wishes to believe in what they are saying or not. Gives one a slightly different perspective in how one views MOTHER NATURE/EARTH. Very beautiful and encouraging for those who seek to end this suffering that we humans have imposed on MOTHER EARTH and LEARN to respect our LAND all around us and all living things who depend on this LIFE GIVING LAND. THUMBS UP to all involved with this film and especially to the 'MAMA' Kogie TRIBE who came out to send this message to all.,1463184000,,657,4.39344262295082

6756356,5,B00OMCLNEE,"Well made film with an incredibly important message. The narrator/host seems to play dumb at times, which is annoying. The Kogi are impressive in their knowledge and it's exciting to see the connections to modern, western science.

What can you and I do to help marginalized people like the Kogi, and our Mother Earth?",1459209600,,318,4.888888888888889

6756371,4,B00OMCLNEE,"kogi are good to spend time with , their message is the message deeply hidden inside all of us and their message is worthy of lifting .

documentarian alan is awful to spend an hour and a half with , acting like egotistical spirit-doubter earth-doubter the whole time , refusing to understand that what affects a running river downstream will evaporate , fall as rain , and affect upstream in the mountain ? refusing to understand easy scientific concepts because they are *too abstract* or because they are presented spiritually . it seems he poses as ignorant white dude for the sake of his movie , but why not just make a movie about the mama and lift up their voices alone , why interject white man ignorance into it ? alan is very annoying , i wanted to flick his head

thank u kogi",1454716800,2,787,4.4206896551724135
6756372,5,B00OMCLNEE,"The Kogi are an amazing people and I agree with them completely except for the fact that it is already too late.  The weather patterns have become too distorted at this point with the result that our ability to feed 7+ billion and growing is not going to work much longer.  We will continue to cause irreparable (on a human time scale) harm to The Mother as we try to sustain the unsustainable. Once we're gone the world will be fine. After a few hundred millennia the radioactivity will subside, nature will recover and it'll be like we were never here.  It's a shame for the Kogi and all the other life on the planet that didn't deserve it.  Contemporary man needs a long time out and I believe its almost nap time.",1453766400,,717,4.368421052631579

That the mother can feel pain, and we are so ignorant and caught up in our own BS (belief systems) that we have forgotten how to treat our mother. The earth, our mother, is a living organism, and humans are a parasite, a pathogen if you will. Just like our body attempts to rid its self of disease and parasites, the earth will do the same with us, and wipe us out like a bad cold. The Mamas are trying to save us all, and lo and behold, we are too stuck in our own BS to listen...please listen, it may be the last chance we get....",1423612800,,672,4.06015037593985

They try to explain to the dense ""younger and disobedient brother"" how everything is connected in the spiritual- and therefore also in the material world.  A very difficult task that I feel was well conveyed and simply put.  Now it is time to protect them, their land and do our part to keep the whole functioning.

8684233,5,B00OMCLNEE,"This is one of the best and most important documentaries I have ever seen. I am currently watching it for the third time with great benefit. I also watched The Heart of the World: Elder Brother's Warning, which is readily accessible online and is the first documentary about the Kogi made by Alan Ereira a dozen or so years earlier. I believe the Kogi are basically right-the further we remove ourselves from the natural world, the less we know and the dumber we become. We have become so disconnected from our mother-the earth-that we wantonly kill and destroy our very means of survival. Our disconnection from the source of life mirrors our disconnection from each other. This disconnection has to be repaired in all areas. Our lack of sensitivity to the earth and all of it's inhabitants leads to a profound lack of connection to each other, our families, children, etc. Probably the most important current disconnect, which I see every day, is between men and women. These people and other indigenous tribes like them are repositories of enormous wisdom about the planet and the right way for human beings to live. We ignore them at our peril.",1501891200,3,1148,4.803030303030303
8684234,5,B00OMCLNEE,"We've so long failed to take head to what nature has spoken to us that sometimes it takes those who walk with the Mother to truly translate it for in a way one might understand.  At first it's difficult to grasp the connections and importance in the message the Mamas are trying to define.  Be patient in watching as ultimately the full comprehension will present its self.  There is a certain beauty in the documentary and a certain since of sadness.  I found their message remarkable that it parallels both the Hopi message presented to the United Nations and additionally Eastern philosophies found in Buddhism and Taoism.  The Kogi way of life is simple, quiet, and responsible.  A stark difference to ours, the 'Younger Brother'.",1487548800,,734,4.832
