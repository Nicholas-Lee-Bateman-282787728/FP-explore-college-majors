8142019,5,B000HX5HQW,"I bought this single video especially to see how Helen structured the copper pot.  Even though I had watched some of Helen's teaching videos,  I had somehow forgotten what a wonderful teacher she was.  I have played it several times,  and always seem to get more depth of what she conveys.  This tape inspired me to buy some of her series,  and it started with this video.  I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to see how a painting such as this is done from start to finish.  One of the things I love about Helen's instruction is that she doesn't just demonstrate what she is painting,  but tells you WHY she did it that way.",1353801600,,635,4.358974358974359
