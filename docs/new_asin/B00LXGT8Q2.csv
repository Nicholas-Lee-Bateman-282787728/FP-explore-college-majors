6509855,5,B00LXGT8Q2,"Not crazy about the filler arc overall, but the ending of it all made up for some of the lackluster story telling of it. Not only that, but we're finally getting into the Grand Magic Games which is pretty exciting! You will get a short glimpse at the new dragon slayers and their exceeds, but it is brief. Overall really enjoyed this DVD immensely more than the last one, especially the ending fights against the oracion seis and especially the revaluation  in Cobra's story!",1417219200,,475,4.654761904761905

6509864,5,B00LXGT8Q2,"This is the set I personally have been waiting for; as the 'Key of the Starry Skies' arc draws closer to its tragic, cataclysmic conclusion, it's time for the finest arc in all of Fairy Tail to make it's debut on western home video.
While I personally found the Starry Skies arc to be somewhat tiresome -as it was indeed a filler arc with rehashed villains- I couldn't help but find myself on the edge of my seat during some of the fight scenes, especially Mirajane! However what is more important is what follows the arc's gripping finale - the 'Grand Magic Games' arc.
Have you ever watched Fairy Tail wondering ""I wonder what ____ vs ____ would be like!"" or ""How would Fairy Tail cope in THIS situation!"" Well worry no more! Because the new arc is nothing but pure fighting between all of Fiore's strongest Guilds; Fairy Tail, Cuatro Cerberus, Mermaid Heel, Lamia Scale...and the Guild that dethroned Fairy Tail after the timeskip - Sabertooth.
But when Natsu and the gang uncover the true intentions of the tournament, they realise that the entire country is on the brink of being wiped out.

I hope you weren't planning on sitting comfortably because Part 13 is going to have you and your dog hanging off the edge of your seat desperate for more as the most brilliant arc in all of Fairy Tail to date sets up to take your mind by storm!",1406246400,9,1341,4.518518518518518
6509885,5,B00LXGT8Q2,I enjoyed the entire series and I am glad to have added this one to my collection.,1456876800,,82,3.8823529411764706

6509893,4,B00LXGT8Q2,I thought since sting and rouge where on the cover they would appear in this season. I was wrong. Cover lies. lol Not that its a reason to not buy it. Just pointing that out for people who'd want to know. They appear in the next box set though. Also lucy wearing the grand magic games gear on the side is also misleading. Just like sting and rouge you don't even hear about the grand magic games till the next box set.,1446595200,,418,4.109756097560975

6509938,3,B00LXGT8Q2,"The series itself is fine, but this review is about the packaging.  I received this set (as I have all of my other discs) from the provider, except that the sleeve was slightly damaged (scuffed and crumpled a bit at the bottom corners) and one of the blu ray discs (disc 2) was free within the packaging.  Fortunately it still plays.  It's never enjoyable to receive a new item already somewhat damaged.  If it's going to be damaged, I'd rather know that it was my own fault!",1420934400,,475,4.425287356321839

6509940,5,B00LXGT8Q2,"This is on my ""to get"" list. I'll probably have it right after New Years. And I read up to point on the manga and I've watched the show in Japanese. It leads to my favorite arc. The Grand Magic Games. My two favorite characters are on the front of the case. Therefore I know that it's going to be good. Even if they're only in the last couple of episodes. Why? Because Fairy Tail is AMAZING. No one can compete. :)",1419638400,,414,4.060975609756097

6509942,2,B00LXGT8Q2,The writing in this show is getting exponentially worse. It's just lazy. It is the same formula over and over which is expected at this point only now the dialogue and story is so bad it's almost unwatchable.,1417824000,,208,4.5
