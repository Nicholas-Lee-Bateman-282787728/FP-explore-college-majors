Hope this gets wide distribution so non-soap people can enjoy it and see the amazing range of talent on daytiime TV.  More, Corbin, more, please!",1131321600,6,318,4.833333333333333
2414929,5,B000BDJEZ8,"I thought that Carpool Guy was a great ""feel-good"" movie.  The entire cast did an outstanding job.  A perfect example of the range of talent that some soap opera stars have.  In particular, Rick Hearst was fabulous as Joel Goodman.  He was cute, funny, dramatic and brave all at the same time.  He was so natural in this role.  In fact, I hope to see more of him on the big screen.  He so belongs there!!!

Corbin Bernsen did a great job with this comedy.  Definitely a movie that I would pay to see in theaters.  He should continue to make many more movies.  If you like a good story, that is light-hearted and funny, you'll enjoy Carpool Guy!  And Carpool Guy is one way to experience the acting chops of one Rick Hearst - - he is beyond talented!

See the movie and buy the DVD; you won't be sorry!",1131235200,6,801,4.225165562913907
2414930,5,B000BDJEZ8,"This movie was excellent from start to finish! I'm not saying that just because I'm biased because my favorite soap stars are in it, it is just really that good! This is a movie that if Hollywood would just realize that soap stars can do so much more... this movie should be a box office hit!

I saw it in St Louis at the premiere and also purchased the DVD. I recommend this to anyone who loves soaps and comedy!

Corbin did a wonderful job on this film!",1130716800,3,455,4.159090909090909
2414931,5,B000BDJEZ8,Carpool guy gave me a chance to see some of my favorite daytime actors in another role.  I was surprised when I actually realised that I was enjoying the movie without once thinking of Rick as Ric but really seeing him as Joel and the same for Tony not beeing Luke etc.  This was a better movie then I expected and better then some things out in theaters right now. I recommend it for anyone who need a couple of hours of escape and laughter.,1130630400,3,442,4.188235294117647
2414932,4,B000BDJEZ8,"Carpool Guy takes everyday frustrations of commuting and trying to move up at work, and turns them into a fun and entertaining movie that most people can identify with.  With the killer traffic in the LA area, Rick Hearst's character, ""Joel"" needs to find a way to get to work earlier without sacrificing his family life.  Solution - hire a homeless man (Anthony Geary) to ride with him to and from work so that he can use the carpool lane.  The twists and turns that come from this agreement result in more laughs than most of today's blockbuster films.",1130544000,3,554,4.575757575757576
2414933,4,B000BDJEZ8,"It was great to see soap opera stars on the big screen in a really good movie. The movie puts Rick Hearst in traffic frustrated each day about getting to work, but he discovers a unique way to overcome this adversity. With twists and turns and humor Jeanne Cooper and Tony Geary add to the very funny story line that some of us do live. Other soap stars add their best efforts to make us all glad we saw this very funny movie!",1128902400,12,426,4.144578313253012
2414944,5,B000BDJEZ8,This was a really funny movie.  Very entertaining!  Never know what's going to happen next.  The actor's were marvelous.  I suggest this movie to everyone that enjoys a good laugh.,1371772800,,180,4.9
2414945,4,B000BDJEZ8,"It loses steam along the way. But I really do love to see Jeanne Cooper even if all she does is scream! She is the best. The whole movie is a great idea but just goes downhill. Sometimes the voices are out of sync with the lips which can be quite a distraction. Anthony Geary as the ""Carpool Guy"" wins my heart!",1371340800,,311,4.032258064516129
2414946,5,B000BDJEZ8,A really good funny movie.  Cast was incredible. So much talent from daytime TV in one movie. Loved it!!  Highly recommends it,1363564800,,126,4.681818181818182
2414947,4,B000BDJEZ8,"Well made movie about learning about life. This movie features a bunch of soap stars. It is about a guy who is always late to work, so he lets a homeless guy ride with him so he can use the carpool lane on the highway to speed things up a bit. The bum turns out not to be who he seems to be. The main character is an advertising executive, and the bum has a few tricks up his sleeve. See it for the daytime stars, the story, and the DVD extras.",1359936000,,444,3.8369565217391304
2414948,1,B000BDJEZ8,This was a stupid movie that wasted some great talent!!  I cannot believe that they chose to do this so called movie?,1356307200,,117,4.318181818181818
2414949,4,B000BDJEZ8,I am a huge soap fan. I love watching Gh everyday. This has all the good soaps stars in it. It was a funny story. A soap fan must have.,1355529600,,135,3.533333333333333
2414950,5,B000BDJEZ8,"I'm a soap fan, but even my husband loved it.  We then had friends over and insisted on watching it again for us, and for them to see...did this with several friends.  And they all loved it and laughed!  After having worked in the television advertising business for 18 years, I could really relate..Also with the driving in Los Angeles.  That dummy sure looked inviting, and even the bum!  Clever Clever Clever!  A must see.",1142899200,3,425,4.6
2414951,1,B000BDJEZ8,"While I am a great fan of many of the talented people in this movie, Carpool Guy was a great disappointment.  I've seen the quality work all these people do and I feel this was not really the actors fault, but the lame writing.  It is supposed to be a comedy and that did not come thru at all.  It had a good premise, and could have been so much more.  Applause to Corbin Bernson for using his Mom in the film, but her speech is difficult to understand.",1142726400,3,453,4.056179775280899
2414952,5,B000BDJEZ8,My daughter and I enjoyed the movie.  It was fun seeing so many familar faces in the movie.  I hope they make another.,1133913600,3,118,4.086956521739131
2414953,5,B000BDJEZ8,"Soap operas and those who star in them are often unfairly stereotyped. Yet, well known entertainers from primetime and film like Carol Burnett, Elizabeth Taylor and Julia Roberts are admitted soap fans. There must be more to daytime than meets the eye, right?  Carpool Guy answers that question with a resounding, ""Yes!"" It's a highly entertaining and hysterically funny movie. Everyone can identify with the plot (especially if you are at all familiar with the advertising industry) and there's something here for everyone to enjoy.

The cast of characters perfectly compliments the lead, Joel (Rick Hearst), as he searches for the coveted balance between a successful career and family life. When a ladder-climbing opportunity inspires him to take some creative but drastic measures in order to compete, the movie takes you along for the ride with some surprising twists and a few life lessons along the way.

If you're not familiar with the stars from daytime, I urge you to haul out the popcorn, sit back, relax and check out some outstanding performances. Rick Hearst is well cast and on the money as Joel Goodman, a character everyone can embrace and relate to!  There are hysterical performances by Tony Geary, Kristoff St. John and Jeannie Cooper, just to name a few. Additionally, the DVD contains some fascinating and funny extra sections about the making of the movie. I hope that Carpool Guy is the first of many Corbin Bernsen's projects showcasing daytime talent. If so, there's a lot to look forward to!",1132099200,6,1518,5.011904761904762

8085694,2,B000BDJEZ8,"I ordered this movie because I liked the actors producing, directing and acting in  Carpooled  . I also saw a blurb in Soap Opera Digest. Carpool starts off  very slow. I tried to hang in there for the movie to gain momentum and live up to the talented cast. For me that did not happen.  And yet should this samemail cast appear in another movie together I'd watch the movie.",1456012800,,375,4.314285714285714
8085695,3,B000BDJEZ8,The video and audio quality were not great. The movie was very cheesy. Loved seeing Rick & Tony in something totally different from their GH characters even it was low budget. The menus on the DVD were pretty entertaining.,1455667200,,222,4.717948717948718
8085696,5,B000BDJEZ8,"If you want to see a direct to DVD release of a comedy film starring your favorite soap opera stars from the likes of ""The Young & The Restless"", ""General Hospital"", and others, I highly recommend this rare film from 2009 that most likely will never air on TV and cable for that matter. Seeing these soap stars doing comedy roles was worth getting including Sharon Case who plays Sharon and ""Y&R"" who was briefly in this film.",1416182400,,426,4.4743589743589745

8085698,1,B000BDJEZ8,"I choose only one star due to profanity in the movie. Corbin wrote about in his blog and it sounded like a good family movie. due to the profanity I would not let my grandkids watch it. The movie was hard to follow but part of that might have been cause I had a hard time watching it once I knew there was profanity. This could have been a good movie - they did not need to use profanity (this applies to any movie). I was going to buy Corbin's newest movie about a boys inner search for God, but may hold off now.",1383350400,,514,3.951923076923077
8085699,5,B000BDJEZ8,"This was a great movie. Fun, entertaining and as someone else said, 'feel good' movie!
Great acting!  I loved seeing familiar soap stars in a movie.",1380585600,,148,4.6923076923076925
8085700,5,B000BDJEZ8,Haven't watched but if quality is anything like packaging this will be A++++.  Must have for Jeanne Cooper fans to own one of her movies now that she has left us.  So many soap stars.,1379289600,,183,4.2
8085701,5,B000BDJEZ8,A funny movie. Jeanne Cooper one of the stars had recently died. and I have been wanting to see this  movie for a long time.,1377820800,,124,3.96
8085702,5,B000BDJEZ8,I purchased this DVD because I am a huge Young and the Restless fan and my fav Jeanne Cooper had passed away.  This movie consists of all soap opera actors and it was great and fun!  I now have Jeanne Cooper imortalized!,1375747200,,220,4.214285714285714
