8135510,5,B00000JRVV,"I have to say I truly enjoy all the Batman movies, even the barely watchable ones.  There is one however that is responsible for a complete modernization of the character, and thereby returned him to his historic roots.  That movie was Tim Burtons Batman.  Thousands of accolades have already been offered on this landmark film made in 1989, and I can do little else but echo previous complements.  It was and still is a great movie.  I remember seeing it in the theater for the first time.  Likewise I still remember the thrill of seeing the shadowy form of Batman descend behind the two crooks on the roof.  The scuffle, the gun shot, the bat creature getting back up after being shot.  One crook is kicked through a wooden door, and the other is dangled out over the ledge of a building several floors up.  What are you?  Im Batman!  Yes, Michael Keaton was and always will be Batman, and this movie will always be the film that returned to us the original vision of creator Bob Kane.  The 1989 Batman film brought back The Dark Knight, and altered the look of the character.  All future movies drew from the Burton/Keaton Batman by altering the cowl, body armor, etc.  Every subsequent film however retained some portion of Burtons original vision, of this new and Dark Knight.",1476662400,,1281,4.610619469026549

8135513,4,B00000JRVV,"Batman as he was ment to be seen .These three videos are a collection of how Batman has progressed in animation technique since the first airing of Batman the animated series in 1992. The three videos consist of one, Batman mask of the Phantasm which was made for theatre release and is the same animation but on a larger scale as the television series but a feature length movie. The second Sub Zero (Batman and Mr Freeze) is also a full length feature which was ment to go on general release but went sraight on to video. The animation is quite outstanding and was used for the first time with comptor generated images. The third Batman Beyond the movie is a straight from television to video, with four episodes from the T.V series .The animation is a little more simpler and suttler than from the first two Batman outings and more in line with the third Batman television series which has only one video release to date Batman and Superman the movie. All three video's have good story lines and are the way Batman was ment to be, dalk and cool. When are Warners and Fox going to release the entire first series onto DVD ,like the X-files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer ?.",995673600,2,1173,4.485981308411215
8135514,4,B00000JRVV,"The ultimate video collection for TRUE batman fans--this is the dark  knight as he was meant to be viewed--in dark colors and and in top notch  animation.  People of all ages can jump into the adventures of the dark  knight as he faces the villains he's famous for and watch in awe as he  conquers them again and again.  Batman is the ultimate hero, and his  adventures are easily accesible to everyone.  This video is a fine example  of how animation can work so well, and be adult, but tame enough for  children(aka children safe).  These video's are up to standards set by  Batman: Mask of the Phantasm and Sub-zero, along with the new Batman Beyond  series.  Check these video's out!",960768000,7,687,4.570247933884297
