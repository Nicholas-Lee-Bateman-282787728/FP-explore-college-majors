8577400,3,B00C5GOL52,"This 28 minute documentary with a number of Franciscan priests, simply put, is the Stations of the Cross*, on film taken on the famous Via Dolorosa (The road/ way of Sorrows), which was the final path Our Lord traveled to Calvary (Golgotha).

I was quite disappointed with this presentation, for I thought that it would be a documentary explaining the various Stations and the history behind the chapels that earmark these same stations. It was nothing like that.
Instead we follow the Franciscan priests with a group of pilgrims as they journey on the Via Dolorosa, accompanied by a scriptural meditations (which were very good, by the way) on the Stations with the recitation of prayers like the Our Father and Hail Mary and the Singing of the Our Father in Latin. Along the way we see the hustle and bustle of the narrow street lanes and the number of stores that line it, which has a rather chaotic charm and adds good touch of realism.

Though we see what these chapels look like from inside, it is merely a fleeting glance. This program concludes in the Church of the Sepulcher and that in itself is interesting as we see certain sites, such as the Stone of the anointing (where Our Lord's body was anointed) or the place where the crucifix stood.
For those who would like and wish to make the Stations of the Cross att this holy site but are limited in any way, this would definitely help in satiating that spiritual appetite to some degree and it could potentially whet one's appetite if he/she is planning a trip.
Otherwise it would serve as a visual aid in helping one pray the Stations at home, either in Lent or anytime of the year.

There is a Spanish version too on this disc as well as a station selection option.

I was expecting a documentary AND prayer aid. I have to be satisfied only with the latter. Good but not great.

* The Stations of the Cross is an ancient Catholic devotion that was initiated by the Virgin Mary herself (as tradition states, after the death and resurrection of Jesus) and is a meditation of the final journey of Our Lord Jesus Christ to Calvary and his death and burial. It is traditionally said during the Lenten season and on Friday's of the year.",1395792000,8,2194,4.544303797468355
8577401,5,B00C5GOL52,"For Christians who always wanted to go to Israel and walk (experience) Jesus Christ's way of the cross ""Via Dolorosa"", but were reluctant because of the turmoil
in the Middle East,this DVD is the next best thing!

In the safety of your home,you'll walk the final steps that Christ walked in the final stages of his passion. The artwork in the dvd is unique and beautiful. The singing along the way is too. Many stations now have churches built over the actual
site to give it an added majesty!(Such as the Holy Sepulcher church at the end)
This is NOT the boring 'way of the cross' I went to as a kid in church at Easter time.

For Christians who want to relive the most important event of their faith-The Death
and Resurrection - of our Lord Jesus Christ, this is as close as you'll probably ever come!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1374192000,9,824,4.48
