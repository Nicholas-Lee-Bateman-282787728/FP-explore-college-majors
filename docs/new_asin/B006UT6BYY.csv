8504696,5,B006UT6BYY,"Seller delivered timely.  If the seller obtains any other volumes I will be purchasing.  (Another label, RetroFlix, sold individual episodes with each one being a ""Volume.""  More than 30 color episodes) about 10 years ago.  I believe, however, they have gone out of business, so this would be a great find for an aftermarket seller.",1483056000,2,332,4.9818181818181815
8504697,5,B006UT6BYY,"""The Hollywood Palace"" was a great variety show from the 1960s. Watched one show the same afternoon that the product arrived in the mail. Yes, these shows from 1964 and 1965 are in Black and White but who cares? I am old enough to remember when television was ONLY in Black and White! The best surprise on these discs are that there are lots more celebrities on the shows than those listed on the back of the box. Just to see some of these celebrities (like Arthur Godfrey on Disc #8) again is a treat since many of them have passed away. If you are a fan of old TV shows or remember ""The Hollywood Palace"" specifically, this set is for you.",1327449600,6,641,4.262295081967213
