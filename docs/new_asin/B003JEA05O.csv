8398061,5,B003JEA05O,"This is a DVD about doing what is best for your horse.  It is all about keeping your horse sound, healthy and happy all through its life.  And the side benefit of correctly lunging your horse to these ends?  A horse that is balanced, strong, supple, and relaxed when you ride.  I have the sad feeling that this would be a very new and strange experience to many, many riders all over the world, including those competing at the international level.  Spread the word:  A happy, healthy, pain-free horse is the best ride you will ever have, and Jane Armour can show you how to achieve that.  It's so simple, it's almost criminal!  :)",1280966400,,631,4.473684210526316
