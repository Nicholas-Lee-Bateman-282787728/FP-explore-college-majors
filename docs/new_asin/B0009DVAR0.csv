8059169,4,B0009DVAR0,"Nero's loving mother wants her son to be emperor so she kills her husband with poisoned mushrooms and Nero is crowned emperor. He's cool for awhile, doing his mother's bidding and engaging in unprotected sex, but soon he gets bored with normal sex and starts exploring the depths of freakiness and madness.

I wish somebody would put this film out on a quality DVD with a better picture than my grainy ol' videotape cause this film has it all: wall-to-wall nudity, orgies, incest, castration, gladiators, a gladiator revolt, lots of lesbian action, full frontal male nudity, rape, weird dancing, whippings, suicide, a muscled-up midget, gay 2nd base, Christians fed to the lions, cheap sets, tear collecting, decapitation and a lot of insane raving!  One act of depraved lunacy right after another. Bam! Bam! Bam!  This film is way better than that boring Penthouse produced snoozer CALIGULA starring Malcolm McDowell.

Also for those of you that are curious: from what I can tell this film has nothing to do with the more mean-spirited CALIGULA REINCARNATED AS HITLER.",1141603200,5,1069,5.056818181818182
