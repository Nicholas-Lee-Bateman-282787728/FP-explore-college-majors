8335253,4,B001Q8RVKW,"The VHS of Utilities is ok but can only get this on vhs format. Sound and video quality is great, well above exellence if you are able to get a newer or kept care off vhs from a seller. The movie is wacky and funny and hard to see if its in low lightening but thats the 80's-90's for viewing vhs tapes. Hoping someday, Harvey Hart's Utilities gets on a DVD eventually. Still worth the buy.",1396051200,,389,4.131578947368421
