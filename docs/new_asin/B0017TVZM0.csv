After seeing this particular volume one actually finds that even in the new millenium,while the collage system has of course changed over the decades how many of people's motivations for achedemic life haven't changed a whole lot. Here,we learn about how the children of the 50's were encouraged to continue their education after high school,both black and white. However as each pursued further achedemia,they met up with different degrees of repression. In the case of white students,it was a educational system that excerised excessive control over students and,as they're parents had,encouraged a strong sense of conformity. As black students didn't conform because of matters of race their cause was for acceptance period. In the climate of outright racial discord it was only obvious that the repressed white students of the north would would come together to assist the very repressed black students of the south. After all of this we have huge black voter registration,training session in non violence as well as the huge cultural impact of JFK led to a whole multi racial group of young freedom fighters,now no longer content to accept the status quo either. This really showcases a generation with a sense of community and respect for the world and people around them then the one I belong to. And it's kind of a pity because for at least a decade before this people questioning life as it was would've been very important in changing things for the better. And here we see a young generation who risked and sacrificed much to do so.",1235001600,4,1774,4.996621621621622
