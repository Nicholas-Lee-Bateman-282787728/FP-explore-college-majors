3918850,3,B002EP8FDS,"I tried this workout for the first time last weekend (which I broke up over the two days).  I was psyched because I LOVED the first 3 that I did on Saturday and that had me looking forward to Sunday's workout.  After doing the rest on Sunday, I can't say I felt the same.

As another reviewer commented, a lot of it is a retread of her past workouts.  That's okay, though, as they were good exercises.  However, there are new exercises as well.  BUT the one with the exercise ball, I find horrific.  The moves she uses with the ball don't really work.  Even the other fitness models seem to struggle.  It's very awkward.  Plus a couple of the other routines are exercises that you've already done.  I will just use four of the seven and leave it at that.

While I too think that sometimes Denise can be a little over the top verbally, it's nice that she (or someone in her camp) recognized this and recommended that the option to view the tape with or without commentary might appeal to some.  I really don't mind her chatter, but I know a lot who do.",1284595200,27,1051,4.274111675126903
3918851,4,B002EP8FDS,"I really enjoy this video to use in addition to another routine.  Of course, for a total transformation of your legs and butt, you will need a decent amount of cardio in addition to the exercises on this DVD.  However, I found these exercises to build muscle.  In addition, there are a few exercises that I've never seen before, so I appreciated that.

  I have never used a Denise Austin video before.  Although her voice is ridiculously creepy throughout each segment, she does give good instruction.  Plus, if you get sick of her chipper ""Oooh Kay!""s, you can always do the video with just the picture and music.",1271548800,5,615,4.62962962962963

3918858,5,B002EP8FDS,"I love Denise Austin! Been only doing this one for about a week but i love it. Love that i can mix and match the workouts. I add it to my workout routine. I like denise incessant chatter, brightens my morning!",1457222400,2,209,4.121951219512195
3918859,4,B002EP8FDS,"I have been an athlete my whole life. I even went on scholarship to a DI college in polevauling and high jump as well as became a dance minor and made it into the company, which means I basically was working out most of my day. Post college I still want to keep up on my working out but of course not as much, so I try to find fun and really, really affordable things to do that didn't hurt my already trashed knees. I got this DVD as a good extra add on to my exercises when I do lower body days but of course not as a complete workout. That would be silly. It's good for beginners as well as former athletes like myself.
How I utilized the DVD might be different from people who would typically go along with the video. I use the remote to pause the video so I can go harder and faster with a whole lot more reps than lotted in the video. This makes the exercise worth it for where I am at. Now if you are a newbie to exercise or a beginner which most of America is unless you have had professional coaching. Going along with the video at the beginning is great then use that pause button to add a little more as you go along in your journey to help yourself become better. This is not P90X or Insanity so it will not get you to that kind of burn, which all people need to be at in exercise but it is something good to have to add on to your regimen or even when you need to do a light day. Also if you can't stand hearing someone repeat the same thing over and over again, exercise dvd's are not for you. Although, I have suggested to my friends before to use the volume button and then put on your own music as you follow along once you have the moves memorized, which makes things a bit more enjoyable. The DVD is just a guide of what you can do. You are the indicator of how much harder, and longer you need to go.",1456012800,4,1820,3.9618528610354224

3918862,3,B002EP8FDS,"This program is ok. I haven't been doing it long enough to see results but I imagine it could produce good ones. This video is made up of several different clips of workout videos by Denise, which can be annoying when the segment switches to something you don't like (pilates in my case) and you end up getting out of your zone because you have to fast forward thru to the next segment. Not a big deal to some but irritating to me. I bought the ""instant video"" option though so perhaps the actual dvd allows you to pick segments from the main menu and/or ""skip"" segments easily without having to fast forward. Hope that makes sense. I do enjoy a good number of the segments though. Just wish it was one instead of being more like a compliation of lower body workouts.",1436400000,3,767,4.370629370629371

3918874,3,B002EP8FDS,"I like denise as an instructor; I've heard some find her annoying but I personally enjoy her videos.  I had an old VHS tape which I loved for lower body, so i thought I'd give this one a try.  The moves are still really good, but it is a series of 10 minute workouts.  For the vast majority of the exercises, you do not have enough repetitions to make it hard.  In order to get a decent workout in, I had to pause after almost every move to continue with the exercise before moving on---annoying as you can imagine.  I also bought this is an amazon instant video and did not see a menu/scene selection anywhere; therefore I could not tell which segments were on the video, which were coming up, couldn't skip segments, etc.  Maybe I somehow missed it?

3918879,4,B002EP8FDS,"I was under the impression that this would be a full lower body workout separated into segments, but it's actually a bunch of different Denise Austin lower body workouts. This means that as soon as one segment is over, you're taken back to the menu selection to choose another workout. It'd be great if you could just play all of them straight through. The format also means that there is no warm-up or cool down.

All the workouts are fantastic! They're made to lift your booty and burn unwanted fat off your thighs, and they do that very well without being too challenging. It's worked fabulously for me!

If you want to do all the segments, you will need:

- an exercise mat
- light weights
- a stability ball",1389052800,,712,4.461538461538462

Wow is she energetic!!!

My first mistake was attempting to do this right after Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30. I have been on a bit of a hiatus from working out so I am (or was at the time) out of shape. I really had to push through the first workout.

Her workouts do remind me a lot of Jillian. I've only been doing this for a week but my fiance says he can already notice a difference.

Although it is convenient to have these on one video I would have rather saved my money and bought a different DVD.

If you don't really have any Denise Austins videos this is a great DVD as it has some great workouts on it. Denise Austin is great instructor, very personable and friendly. She is always smiling and makes the workouts fun.",1353974400,2,648,4.311475409836065
3918905,3,B002EP8FDS,"I'm an intermediate exerciser but I've only recently gotten into fine-tuning my lower body and, based on the reviews, I thought I'd try this DVD. This was my first time doing a Denise Austin DVD and I was very underwhelmed. It's filled with a bunch of 5-10 minute clips of Denise's leg, butt, thigh, and hip exercises - most of them pilates-based.

So here are some of the really bad things about this DVD:

First, some of the clips are fairly old (my guess is from the early 90's) so the exercises are a bit archaic and the outfits are so bad it's distracting (and I'm not a person who cares about exercise outfits AT ALL).

Second, many of the clips have exercises that are EXACTLY THE SAME as in the other clips, so this DVD is very limited on exercise variety.

Third, the quality of the exercises is pretty low. Denise doesn't do anything challenging and the reps are so low that it's time to change positions before you can actually get into the current move. I did the entire DVD and only worked up the lightest of sweats - and I should mention that I live in an area that's >80 degrees F year-round and I don't have air conditioning. My light sweat was probably more attributed to the high temps than to the exercises.

Fourth, Denise's queuing sucks. She doesn't often tell you what exercise you're going to be doing next and instead just jumps right into it.

Fifth, and probably my biggest qualm, Denise is SUPER ANNOYING. Good Lord. I don't need to be told every other minute that I'm doing to look great in my shorts - and please, please, please stop telling me to face forward by saying ""Come on now, let me see your smiling face!""

Overall, if you're beginning, this DVD might be okay for you - but for others with more experience, definitely skip this one. It's not worth the time or the money.",1346284800,20,1810,4.4174174174174174

3918915,5,B002EP8FDS,This is a great video to isolate the buns and legs.  I use it in conjunction with a cardio workout or as a quick workout when I am short on time.  I also have Denise Austin's 'best abs' video that I often combine with this video.  Both provide a quick toning workout when needed.,1294012800,2,279,4.12962962962963

8368047,5,B002EP8FDS,So this video has some options! Depending on time you can do one or a few! The longest is 15 minutes.  They may be short but they pack a punch... rather squat !!  Easy yet challenging and you definitely feel the bur during and after. For the price and variety it's a steal and I have never had a bad experience with her videos! Definitely recommend!,1488844800,2,349,4.2727272727272725
