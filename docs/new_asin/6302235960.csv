438631,4,6302235960,"Officer is held responsible for turret explosion and allowed to resign.  He's in love with the sister/nurse of the CPO whose testimony helped to bring his career down.

World War 2 comes and the CPO finds his former officer re-enlisted as a seaman as they go aboard a merchantman as the Navy gun crew.

As they head out on convoy, the sister/nurse, now part of the Navy Reserve, is also in the same convoy, and later comes aboard with a surgeon to tend to a wounded seaman after an aerial attack by Ju-88s.

An enemy signal is intercepted and they catch a U-boat supply ship.  Instead of taking the war prize to Belfast, the former officer comes up with a scheme to resupply the wolf pack with booby trapped torpedos and take out some of the enemy.  When the jig is up, they engage two submarines on the surface before the final triumph.

Enjoyable action film mixed with romantic melodrama, though somewhat exaggerated as wartime morale boosters could become in the story line.",1410739200,,978,4.618497109826589
438632,3,6302235960,"""The Navy Comes Through"" [VHS] is a classic early WWII adventure, but not a high-budget production. It features a very young Dezi Arnaz in a supporting role. The story line concerns the placing of naval gun crews aboard the merchant marine during the Atlantic conflict against the U-boat. The gunnery crew is commanded by Pat O'Brien's character, a gruff Navy chief, somewhat similar to his character in ""Here Comes the Navy"" (with James Cagney). As far as O'Brien's films go, this is not one of the better ones, but under the old-time studio system, actors did not have quite as much choice in roles and scripts as today, and this would have been graded (under the old ""A - B"" movie system) as a ""B"" movie.",1366675200,7,707,4.619047619047619

7822605,4,6302235960,"This film is not a big budget blockbuster movie and I love it. Llike most war movies during that period, it is a flag waiving All American film.

With actor Pat OBrien you cant go wrong. It is also fun to see a young up and coming Desi Arnaz. Also seen is Max Baer Sr, a famous heavy weight boxing champion of his time working on his second career in the movies; his son Jr. played Jethro on The Beverlee Hillbillies.

 These are the types of movies I love. Like minded individuals will agree.",1510876800,,493,4.223404255319149
