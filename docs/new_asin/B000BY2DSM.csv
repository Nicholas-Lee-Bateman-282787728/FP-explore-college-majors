8093882,5,B000BY2DSM,"One of the greatest pro wrestling events of all time. Warriors, Fantastics, RocknRollers, Midnights, Horsemen, and many more tag teams compete for world domination not just for belts but rather for the official world cup. Better than anything the McMuffins in the WWE ever produced. If you like action and not storylines, this is the best thing for you.",1291766400,,353,5.0
8093883,3,B000BY2DSM,"Thanks again to WWE Classics On Demand, I got to watch a classic event in the '87 Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament.  For those that don't know, this event wasn't your usual 3-4 hour one day event but a two day tag team tournament featuring 25 teams (24 regular teams & one alternate team) with a non-tournament match each night with usually the NWA Championship being defended on the second night & a special attraction match the first night.  Now since this was a two day event & not just one show, WWE showed the VHS presentation of this show that contains select matches & highlights of the event along with a special set of extra matches surrounding another special event that happened here.

Now it should be noted that all of the first & second round matches shown here only featured the closing moments but not enough to really make a note of anything...these matches include: Mike Rotundo & Tim Horney vs. Barbarian & Bill Dundee, Jimmy Valant & LazerTron (Hector Guerrero) vs. Shaska Watley & Teijho Khan, Ivan Koloff & Vladimir Petrov vs. Bob & Brad Armstrong, and Midnight Express vs. Ron & Jimmy Garvin which also showed the opening moments along with the humorous interaction between Jim Cornette & Precious.

Matches Include:
Steel Cage Match: Ole Anderson vs. Big Bubba Rogerts - This was the special attraction match on the first night of the tournament as Ole Anderson had recently turned babyface against the Horsemen & James J. Dillion hired the services of Jim Cornette to have Big Bubba take care of Ole for them leading to this match.  This was under what we now know as ""Last Man Standing"" rules where you went until you couldn't answer the 10 count.  The match was nothing special but as good as you expect from both men in their careers (Ole towards the end & Bubba towards the beginning) at that time.

Quarterfinal Match: Road Warriors vs. Midnight Express - This was joined in progress & should be noted that this version of the Midnight Express was the Lane/Eaton version as Stan Lane debuted & replaced Dennis Condrey the previous week while the Warriors were the defending Cup champions.  M.E. heavily relied on double teaming & cheating behind the referee's back while working over Hawk including using Cornette's tennis racket.  Things for really out of control with Cornette getting involved & throwing fire behind the referee before Paul Ellering came in & cleaned out infront of the referee which cost the Warriors their shot at becoming back to back winners of the tournament.

Quarterfinal Match: SuperPowers vs. Rick Rude & Manny Fernandez - This was joined in progress & for those who didn't already know, the team of the SuperPowers is Dusty Rhodes & Nikita Koloff while Rude & Fernandez were the NWA Tag Team Champions.  This was nothing special past Fernandez heavily working over & wearing down Dusty before Rhodes was able to recover & score the quick win.

Quarterfinal Match: Bob & Brad Armstrong vs. Lex Luger & Tully Blanchard - This was joined in progress & nothing really special past seeing how J.J. Dillion played a real important part in helping the team advance but lookout for Brad's missle dropkick onto Blanchard.

Semifinal Match: SuperPowers vs. Midnight Express - This was joined in progress.  It should be noted that Nikita Koloff was wrestling throughout the tournament with a bad neck due to an attack by Dick Murdock weeks earlier & that was heavily focused on by the Express as they were twisted his neck with various headlocks & sleeperholds before the SuperPowers were able to capitalise on one mistake made by the Midnight Express to advance to the finals.

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Barry Windham - What can a say about this match that hasn't been said about any other Windham/Flair match during this period in that it was a very athletic contest that was constant motion from both men & never a dull moment before Barry found out that you can't ""outcheat"" the dirtiest player in the game.

Tournament Finals: SuperPowers vs. Lex Luger & Tully Blanchard - Before the match stars, you get an emotional moment as Magnum T.A. made his first appearence since his career ending accident 6 months earlier along with a mini-reunion of with both Dusty Rhodes & Nikita Koloff. This match was good action that you would expect from the NWA at this time with the highlight of the Horsemen being the classic heels they were known to be at that time throughout the match before Dusty pulled off a move that you wouldn't expect from a fat plumbers son from Austin, TX.
(""Allied Powers: World's Greatest Tag Teams"")

During the middle of the presentation, they had a special tribute to Magnum T.A. since this was his first public appearence since his career ending accident.  In this tribute, they had a few quick words from Magnum backstage before showing three matches from his career.

Steel Cage Match vs. United States Champion Wahoo McDaniels - This was a back when Wahoo was a heel.  A real competitive & physical match between both men that went back & forth match between both men who used the cage as a weapon at times before Magnum went on to win his first United States Championship.
March '85

vs. Kamala - Anyone who remembers Kamala at this time knows that he was an athletic man for his size in the ring while also using an usual attack of chops & applying various nerve holds to areas like the chest & neck.  Magnum did the best he could to adapt to Kamala's style in an average contest.

Steel Cage/I Quit Match vs. United States Champion Tully Blanchard - For those fans who are old enough to remember or just heard by reputation, when asked what was one of the most violent matches of all time...this is mentioned. For it's time, this was hardcore before hardcore was defined as a match that needed a heavy amount of weapons/props & dangerous high spots. This was just two men aggressively beating the living ""crap"" (and I'm putting that nicely) out of each other until one man said ""I Quit""...if your a fan of the later Flair/Funk ""I Quit"" or Hart/Austin Submission match then you'll love this encounter.
(""Bloodbath: Wrestling's Most Dangerous Steel Cage Matches"" & ""Starrcade: The Essential Collection"")

In the end, you have to take into concideration a bunch of things such as how limited VHS was back then to how DVD is today along with the fact that this was a two day event so you can't squeeze everything into this tape.  However the negative thing I have to say here is that eventhough this is suppost to be a tape of the Crockett Cup event, it came off more as a tribute to Magnum T.A. featuring the Crockett Cup because the only complete match on this tape from the tournament was the finals while the three Magnum matches were shown in full...hense taking away time from the matches from the actual event.  I have nothing against Magnum T.A. & it's always a treat to see his Starrcade match against Tully Blanchard but I just felt like 3 matches from him really took away from what the presentation was suppost to be about & that's the Crockett Cup event.  Bottom line, the only complete match on here from the event along with the best Magnum T.A. match shown in the tribute are both available on DVD while Flair & Windham also have a match that was just as good in quality available on DVD as well so unless your a heavy fan of the NWA during this period, this is one event you can skip.",1268870400,,7395,4.659754224270353
