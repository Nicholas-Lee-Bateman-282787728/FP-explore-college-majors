Shot between January and June 1945, Roberto Rossellini's Rome, Open City, chronicles the effect of Nazi occupation on the people of Rome a year earlier. Unlike other films of the time, many scenes were shot on location in a documentary style. The lack of funds and good film stock forced Rossellinni to cut corners so the quality of some of the scenes do not appear to have been lit properlynonetheless, the sometimes grainy images add to the overall verisimilitude of the narrative.

After Italy faithfully followed the fascist dictator Mussolini for twenty years and he was finally deposed two years earlier, Rossellini's main intent was to rehabilitate the Italian people in the eyes of the world. No matter how noxious Mussolini was, his machinations could never equal the sheer terror machine which was Nazi Germany, and the Italians, under the yoke of Nazi oppression, became victims soon after Hitler's troops marched into Rome and began terrorizing the populace.

Rossellini's main protagonist is Giorgio Manfedi (Marcello Pagliero), an engineer and Communist resistance leader, who we later learn did 12 years hard time as an anti-Fascist agitator. After escaping the Nazis by fleeing from a rooming house and climbing over rooftops, Giorgio makes his way to the apartment of fellow Resistance fighter, Francesco. Not home yet, he ends up speaking with his next-door neighbor, Pina, Francesco's pregnant fiance (played by the iconic Anna Magnani, whose performance as Pina made her a star).

We're next introduced to Don Pietro, a Catholic priest sympathetic to the Resistance, who is scheduled to officiate at Pina and Francesco's wedding the next day. In Rossellini's world view, Don Pietro and Giorgio are not incompatible despite past conflicts between Communists and a right-leaning Catholic church. The Nazi terror bonds them together and indeed Don Pietro is more than willing to help Giorgio by taking money and information to Resistance leaders outside the city. As a priest, he is permitted to roam about during the curfew.

The collaborators are represented by two women: Pina's sister, Laura, and Marina, Giorgio former girlfriend, who both work at the same cabaret, and receive financial support by prostituting themselves to German officers. The fact that Giorgio never suspects that Marina is a collaborator is perhaps one of the most glaring weaknesses of the script.

Rossellini did a wonderful job casting a dance hall entertainer, Harry Fiest, to play the SS commander in the City, Major Bergmann. Some have complained that Bergmann appears effeminate and it's been argued that homosexuality was often linked to the perverse evil of the Nazis in films of the time. In reality, Hitler and many of his minions, may have actually been homosexuals (see the book ""The Hidden Hitler"" by Lothar Machtan) but the association of Nazism and homosexuality should not cause those in our own time to conclude there is an underlying pathology to being gay (in fact, the Nazis of course persecuted homosexuals but of those Nazis who were homosexual, it's been posited that they didn't see themselves as ""gay""their wrath was reserved for homosexuals of a more liberal or left-wing persuasion).

Bergmann is aided by another collaborator, the Italian Fascist police chief, and with his help, a raid is ordered at Francesco's apartment. Giorgio escapes but Francesco is rounded up and in a shocking, brilliant scene, Pina is gunned down as she runs toward Francesco, who is being taken away in a truck full of prisoners. Francesco fortunately escapes after resistance fighters ambush the truck and free its captives.

Not all the Germans are seen as evilan Austrian defector comes to Don Pietro seeking help but he's eventually arrested by the Gestapo along with Giorgio and Don Pietro after Marina betrays them for drugs and a fur coat (Bergmann's assistant is Ingrid, an apparent lesbian, who is involved with Marina, and convinces her to give up Giorgio.) Francesco manages to avoid arrest when he tarries for a minute longer saying goodbye to Pina's young son, Marcello.

Rossellini creates an odd set where Bergmann's headquarters is in a room sandwiched in between a torture chamber and bar for the officers. Bergmann is more than a one-dimensional characterhe's nuanced enough to recognize that if he fails to gets his prisoners to talk, they'll be considered on the same level of his fellow Nazis, who he presumes will never break under torturethus negating the theory of the master race.

Another great touch is when Captain Hartmann, Bergmann's underling, blurts out that all the Nazis know is ""killing, killing, killing,"" while he's intoxicatedbut the next day, while sober, ends up executing Don Pietro with glee!

Giorgio is the first to undergo torture, and Rossellini makes it even more horrifying when Bergmann opens the door to the torture chamber and allows the audience glimpses of what's going on. He brings Don Pietro in (since he can't see clearly after breaking his glasses earlier on) and gazes at a Christ-like Giorgio, then realizing his fellow resistance leader is dead. In a brilliant scene, the often self-sacrificing priest suddenly loses his cool and curses out Bergmann and his group including Marina, who faints at the sight of her deceased former boyfriend. Don Pietro is of course only human and we come to realize that sometimes religion is a mask for repressed rage.

The denouement involves the execution of Don Pietro up on a hillsidewitnessed by boys from his parish. Notably, the Italian soldiers intentionally fire and miss at the doomed priest, tied up to a chairand the aforementioned Captain Hartmann delivers the coup de grace.

The brilliance of Rossellini's vision lies in his lack of sentimentthe tragedy of lives lost at the hands of monsters is never soft-pedaled. Rome, Open City is a classic due to its powerful script and indelible images.",1478822400,2,5945,5.141821946169772

It is sentimentalizing at its worse, I particularly found the portrayal of the German commander weak, as he looked like a gerbil, and did not seem very apt or capable. There is very little in the way of story and the expected brutality of the Germans is what takes up the greater part of the screen time, how predictable. . . . .

Rome, Open City, is one of the very first important films to come out of Europe after the war, and was filmed in a way that suggested a documentary. The impact of this film is overwhelming, as are the performances. If you've never seen this movie before, you are missing out on a great experience.",1377216000,5,561,4.666666666666667
8383523,5,B002X9CIZG,"""Rome: Open City,"" (1945), black and white, 100 minutes long, presents us with a classic of Italian cinema. In it, we can see Robert  Rossellini, long since admitted to the pantheon of great Italian directors,  invent Italian neo-realism on the screen; he had to, as, at the time he was working, Italy  was nearly destroyed by World War II bombing, there was very little infrastructure left, and it was hard to get  film, filmmaking equipment, food, clothing - and everything else.  Thus, in his most important, most influential film, the director worked with natural light and sound.

This unsettling war drama packs a lot into its brief running time. It is set in Rome, 1944, the waning days of World War II. The Germans are on the run, but still occupy the war-battered city that has been declared ""Open"" by parties to the war. It's anybody's for the taking. Its residents, largely old men, women and children endure a harrowing struggle with curfews, food shortages, joblessness, poverty, hunger and allied bombing raids. Meanwhile, they are trying to shield resistance forces from their de facto Nazi occupiers, and to maintain their self-respect. Rossellini's astonishing landmark film, which made its sensational debut at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Oscar for best screenplay, shows the Italian people's heartsick, weary despair and collective resolve to survive.

Giorgio Manfredi, AKA Luigi Ferraris, a Communist and an engineer, who's one of the Italian resistance leaders, is tracked down by the Nazis. He flees to his friend Francesco's place, where Francesco's pregnant fiance Pina, unforgettably played by Anna Magnani (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-of-Santa-Vittoria/dp/B0014BJ1D6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret of Santa Vittoria</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rose-Tattoo/dp/B005DNPK7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rose Tattoo</a>) finds him, and carries a message for him to the local priest, Don Pietro Pellegrini, who's to marry the lovers in a day or two. But the Nazis are hard on Manfredi's heels.

Rossellini. (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/STROMBOLI/dp/7885881512/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">STROMBOLI </a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Europa-51/dp/B001IKVWZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Europa '51</a>), actually co-wrote the screenplay - with possibly the greatest Italian star director of them all, Federico Fellini, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/8-1-2/dp/B000RFPORM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">8 1/2</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Dolce-Vita/dp/B004FPJ87W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Dolce Vita</a>), while the Germans still occupied Rome. Rossellini also started filming it while the Germans were still there. He had no film, and so had to piece together little bits and pieces he'd begged from the city's photographers. He was determined to have the film ready to release as soon as the Germans left Rome/were defeated in Italy. Therefore, he built no sets, and, for the first time in Italian cinema, filmed his story entirely on the actual streets and in the actual buildings of Rome. (He thereby established the Italian cinema protocol of realism, or neo-realism, as they preferred to call it, which held sway in Italian film for several decades.) He also didn't take much time - how could he--in composing the composition, the lighting - he used natural light--or the shadows of his film. He used actual German prisoners of war to portray his film's Germans - no Roman would have played a German at that time.  As the dialog is entirely in Italian, this film has English subtitles, thank goodness.

There is a scalding scene of the pregnant Pina's murder by the Germans, as she is dressed for her wedding, in her best, but still laddered stockings. She is killed in front of her son, an altar boy in a blinding white cassock, made even brighter by the Italian sun. Upon release of the picture, which was an enormous hit, Magnani was widely anointed ""the Mother of Rome.""

Ironically enough, Rossellini, Fellini, and Michelangelo Antonioni,(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-Avventura/dp/B002RA767Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L'Avventura</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-Eclisse-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0007989Y8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L'Eclisse (The Criterion Collection)</a>&nbsp;), another great and famous Italian director, all got their starts making propaganda films, depicting a happy Italy, under the aegis of Vittorio Mussolini, son of the Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. These were called white telephone films, as they depicted pretty young women lounging next to their white telephones, waiting for their lovers to call. There's another pretty young woman lounging near her white telephone in ROME OPEN CITY, waiting for her lover's call; Marina Mari, Manfredi's mistress, and the relationship does not ultimately serve him well.  Well, the picture can be quite a downer, but Rossellini does manage finally to leave viewers with some hope for Italy's future.  You may not enjoy this movie, but if you are into movies, I think you've got to see it.",1362960000,6,5400,6.340599455040872
