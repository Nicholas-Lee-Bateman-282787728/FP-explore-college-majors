1687869,5,B0000638SV,I actually watched Landspeed back in the day and it's hillarious. I have all three on VHS but I want to get it for DVD now. Big brother videos with PJ (Johnny Knoxville) are funny tapes to. So if you like CKY buy Big Brother videos also. ... Just some info to help all you CKY lovers. Brandon is so funny.

1687870,5,B0000638SV,"The two bad boys from the hit MTV show Jackass, Bam Magera and Brandon Dicamillo are outrageously funny!  They take their bathroom humor to the max with funny skits and pranks.  (Don't forget the awsome skate tricks.)  CKY is also the name of Bam's brothers band Camp Kill Yourself.  You hear some of there music throughout all of the videos.  Its guranteed you could watch these videos over and over, you'll be laughing so hard you'll miss the next sketch.  Wild stunts, crazy antics, and things you wouldn't see anywhere else, these videos are definitely entertaining.  You'll be quoting Brandon for the rest of your life!  Two enthusiastic thumbs up!!",1025049600,7,654,4.881818181818182
1687871,5,B0000638SV,"The CKY videos are simply incredible...Where else can you see some of this stuff?  Not on MTV's JACKASS, thats for sure.  Bam & Brandon are geniuses, no matter how many trees they jump into

1687872,5,B0000638SV,"sure, i watched jackass, i love the show, but it just seemed to watered down. so i got this cky dvd 4pack. i had heard of cky and that bam margera , brandon dicamillo and ryan dunn were the main stars in it, i had to see it. some of the less intense parts weer shown on jackass. but jackass is no comparison to this, these videos are what started the show. these are the funniest video ive ever seen. if you liked jackass, but are looking for something a little bit more, get this. the dd has more footage than the vhs does. youll be hooked on watching it for weeks.",1019433600,6,566,4.0625
1687873,5,B0000638SV,"I've seen the VHS not DVDs of 3 of the 4 videos, and they are definetly a must own.  If you enjoy the sadistic humor of MTV's Jackass then you're in heaven, cuz this is Jackass /wo the censoring.  And for all those that don't know, the CKY crew is Jackass btw, except no Johnny Knoxville.",1017273600,3,288,4.125
1687874,5,B0000638SV,"this is a review of CKY 2K dvd
 I live in england and have to admit I'm not really into the skateboarding scene, although I'm getting there now, I loved MTV's Jackass when it first appeared I got hooked, and when I tried to buy a dvd or video of it, I couldn't beleive it had not been released, and to this day it still hasn't, when I looked into it I found  CKY ( camp kill yourself ) and big brother, both available on vhs/dvd, these are like jackass but an earlier version, I have yet to see the big brother videos, but CKY are great, this features half the Jackass cast, and big brother features the other half, and I beleive they came together to create Jackass,
CKY features Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Brandon Dicamillo, etc and they film themselves getting up to all their usual antics, skating, being daft and doing outragous things it really is compelling I have seen it over a dozen times and still find it great when I watch, there is one scene in a hotel in Iceland which you have to see to believe, I cannot buy these in england and only have this one dvd I Long for the release of an uncut jackass, but ths more than fills the gap.",1016323200,9,1142,4.1863636363636365

1687893,5,B0000638SV,"Bam Margera and Brandin Dicamillo are laughter if I have ever seen it. These videos are the guys from Viva La Bam doing funny stunts. Since this is an uncensored DVD, they don't have to bleep out anything which really is cool cause you don't have to hear BEEP evey other word.",1110844800,,276,4.326923076923077

1687895,5,B0000638SV,"I've seen the first three CKY movies so I chose to review under this product title even though I do not own the CKY documentary.
The CKY films are known for their sick skateboarding, hilarious skits, and jaw-dropping stunts. CKY: Landspeed defined some of the most infamous bits ever performed by the East Coast Crew. This includes Shopping Carts, which introduced the idea of sitting in shopping carts while your friend pushes you as fast as he can and rams you directly into a curb, thus propelling your body into the pavement at full speed. CKY videos are usually only found in select stores or skate shops so this idea didn't go mainstream until Jackass premiered in October of 2000, and impressionable kids really started to be affected by the impulse of doing dumb stunts. Unfortunately, this resulted in lawsuits and the inevitable fall of Jackass, but they truly showed that they weren't going to be censored when Jackass The Movie came out in 2002. I guess that gross-out humor and dangerous antics are meant to be left in their rawest form. And if you're sick of the Jackass reruns or just can't seem to find any good homegrowns on the internet to satisfy your need for hardcore stunts on camera that lack in bleeps, then check out the CKY series.
Landspeed is mostly known for introducing Shopping Carts, drive-thru pranks, and public spills. Videos like CKY2K are where people would probably recommend you for skating, when in fact CKY: Landspeed has pretty unbelievable shredding on rails and vert ramps. Unfortunately, all we see in the beginning is Kerry ""Hockey Temper"" Getz throwing his skateboard around and getting angry as hell. Thankfully, the 96 Quite Bitter Beings, Shippensburg, and Knee Deep skate videos seen throughout the duration of Landspeed start showing us some awesome skating. So I guess Landspeed has everything you need. CKY2K and CKY3 only perfect it.
CKY2K features some nasty toilet humor where Brandon wipes poo on Ryan's face, and Ryan urinates on Brandon's face as revenge. This also includes their strangely funny trip to Iceland, even more skateboarding that just keeps getting better, and the birth of Brandon's Chinese freestyle. DiCamillo is really beginning to define his reputation in CKY2K as a ruthless prankster.
CKY3 is a step-up in video quality with better special effects that are comparable to Viva La Bam. This video is all mostly random acts of inexplainable idiocy with an all new Shopping Carts video that's the best yet and Chris Raab defecating while running at full speed. We also get to see Bam relieve himself on Phil's face while laughing with his pro skater buddies, Ville Valo from HIM, and the members of the band CKY. Amongst this, we get some more skating thrown in here and there with Bam in most of the clips. But what would a CKY movie be without skateboarding?
I'd say that my favorite out of the three would have to be CKY3 because of how well it was put together and the variety of crazy stuff in it. You make your decision for yourself.",1070928000,15,3015,4.8111753371868975
1687896,5,B0000638SV,"This is the best collection of movies I've ever seen. It features:
CKY - The original and possibly one of the best.
CKY2K - Hilarious and more great skating.
CKY3 - More nudity, stunts and skating to keep you entertained and laughing your ass off.
CKY Documentary - This is the best Documentary I've ever seen. Not only does this show old footage of Bam and friends, but also footage of CKY (theband)! I never stop laughing.
If you like Jackass, then get the collection of movies that started it all. Get it on DVD for better quality and funny bonus footage. Don't get the CKY Trilogy though, cause they're just re-edited versions of these videos. And the Trilogy cuts out a lot of scenes and half the movies cause Bam had a lot of law suits. Get the box set while you can from ckystore.com",1066780800,12,790,4.417808219178082
1687897,5,B0000638SV,"this should get 6 stars.there is not words to describe how good these dvds are. these are the best movies u will ever see. i swear u will watch them over and over. if u like jackass buy these, if u like skateboarding buy these, if u like comedy buy these. its not just the stunts and skateboarding that are amazing, the prank calls and drive thrus in mcdonalds make me laugh every time i watch them. don't forget to pick up cky4 and jackass the movie.",1053820800,4,451,4.195402298850575
1687898,4,B0000638SV,"If your into the whole tasteless, mindless, ""why when I do that I always get arrested by the cops!"", type of pranks and funnies on other unsuspecting people than this is a 4 disc collection that you should take a look at. I think that these guys had the embilical chord wrapped around their neck too tight before they were born!",1050364800,2,328,4.39344262295082
1687949,5,B0000638SV,"The CKY box set is absolutley excellent. You really have to like this kinda stuff coz some of it is quite nasty. If you don't like jackass and the like you will hate this. This stuff is great for watching with your friends believe me you will be in tears laughing. The skits and stunts are excellant, the skateboarding stuff is alright but if your like me ,not a fan of skating, you'll find these parts of the videos boring. The soundtrack is mostly done by the band Camp Kill Yourself aka CKY..Video four ,the documentary, isn't as good as the other videos. But all in all I would really really recomend these videos to you die hard jackass fans out there!",1050278400,4,657,4.39344262295082

1687951,4,B0000638SV,"This box set contains CKY 1, 2, 3 and a documentary that I think is exclusive to the set (and contains the infamous ""how to rob a house""). A lot of people like to compare CKY to Jackass, I don't like that comparison but it's a good reference to anyone who hasn't seen any CKY video. It's full of skateboarding (I give Bam his props here), pranks, and skits most of which are very humorous but to be honest some can be boring or too stupid. All 4 DVDs are good to watch with a group of friends for some insane laughs or just for the shock value of some of the content. They all have extras that weren't on the VHS releases and to be honest a lot of the material here is funnier than some of the stuff that made the edit. I don't think you'll be disappointed in buying this set as long as you aren't easily disgusted or aggravated by stupid/rude behavior.",1044403200,33,853,4.144578313253012
1687952,5,B0000638SV,"Like jackass and tom green?
Heard of CKY from Jackass.
LOVED JACKASS?
Then get this! all the DVD's are great CKY:Landspeed(1999) Puts and amazing start on the 4 CKY's with such skit's as ""Hill Billy bowling"" and many hilrious prank calls and mc donalds drive thru incidents.
CKY2K In my opion is the best out of all 4 DVD's your get in the box set, the baseball skit is amazingly funny and aswell is the amercian football kicks onto passer's by cars this one is packed full of entertainment and i never stopped laughing.
CKY3 in my opion was the experiment for bam's special effects skill's don't get me wrong the shopping cart bit which i waayy over 10mins of just shopping carts :D but there was a hefty amount of effects in this the stuff that was orignal in here was very funny! this is the wind down to the CKY's.
By now after watching all 3 you should be curious on how this group of people formed and why they do what they do! well CKY The Documentry tells you everything! how they got there name and were it came from, how each of them met, they show there oldest skits dating back to 1991!, how rab become obsessed with poo and how to rob a house!
Overall these DVD's are amazing! if you put them down for more than a week and watch them again they appear brand new....this is a must be for all!",1043539200,10,1304,4.262096774193548

1687954,5,B0000638SV,"Ok, first off I loved Jackass.  I thought the world of Johnny Knoville and his crew.  I always thought Johnny was the brains behind the operation.  I bought the CKY box set on impulse,  knowing that Bam was in it.  I started watching it and all of a sudden my thinking goes from Jackass to CKY being the brains behind it all.  Yeah Steve-O and Johnny have their moments,  but Bam, Raab, Dunn, Bran, are the true geniuses behind Jackass, Knoxville simply throws his name around,  but these guys are the real talent.  The best skits on Jackass were taped years ago while making the cKy videos.  Anyways,  cKy has a lot going for it,  a kickass band which they can exploit for their soundtrack and the craziest people around (skateboarders).  Bam is the man...",1041120000,7,757,4.518518518518518

7958632,5,B0000638SV,"Great to have the whole collection in one cool looking sleeve! You'll have to get CKY 4 in addition because it contains a documentary that is fantastic and has some of the old great stuff before they were taking off. THERE'S NO SKELETOR and BEASTMAN on my version of CKY 3!!!! This sucks big time and it might be missing other parts too but I'm not sure. These videos are so great and I'm really glad to have this collection, it'd be hard to ever have to give this away! Get this if you can but maybe just getting each DVD is a cheaper or better option at this place in time and maybe it won't be missing skeletor and beastman!",1507075200,,627,4.190082644628099
