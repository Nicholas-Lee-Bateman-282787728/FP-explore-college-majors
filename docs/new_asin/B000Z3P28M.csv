8234752,1,B000Z3P28M,"I was shocked when I read the product description for this DVD, which seems so far from what the actual trial revealed about the case. The evidence against this lethal ex-nurse was so compelling, that 12 jurors found her guilty of shooting and chopping her husband up. First degree premeditated murder pure and simple.

No apparent motive, ABC says? I think her wealthy long-term lover might disagree. Anyone who studied this case in any detail knows that much of what came out of Melanie's mouth turned out not to be true. She even denied owning the 3 matching suitcases her husband's remains were found in, until she realized other people knew she had recently purchased those suitcases.

TV shows seem to take a few facts and spin it into what will net the best ratings. I think they spun this tragic story into an over-used dryer-sheet yarn!

I'll wait for investigative journalist John Glatt's book on the subject, due out this December. Because in my opinion, the real truth deserves much better treatment than what ABC provided.",1214956800,,1035,4.836158192090395
8234753,2,B000Z3P28M,All I have to say and there has been a lot shown of this case which was aired on Court TV. ABC Primtime thinks they can make a little money by selling DVD products which was aired exactly on television. There are no special extras here about the case. I thought the 48 Hours: McGuire Diaries were more revealing and better in an hour. Cynthia McFadden appeared uncomfortable at times interviewing Melanie McGuire during the weekend before she was found guilty of killing her husband. The show only exploits the tragedy even further for both families.,1205452800,,550,4.739583333333333
