8134671,3,B000GUJYGU,"Cute idea, nice character design, well-executed stop animation.

Can be a little annoying in a number of aspects:
The theme song sounds like it might have been written by one of the animators; this'd be more forgivable if you didn't end up hearing it 4 times each time you play the DVD. The other music in the show is pretty dismal as well.
The story lines are pretty standard-fare and mostly unrelated to the characters being robots.
Although it would mean hearing the theme song even more times, for the price you'd think you'd get all 8 episodes on one DVD.

Enough with what I think. My robot-obsessed son likes it.",1472083200,,619,4.5675675675675675

8134673,5,B000GUJYGU,My 4 year old grandson loved this DVD. Kept him occupied for an hour or so and he wanted to re watch it so I know he really enjoyed it.,1377043200,,135,3.533333333333333
8134674,5,B000GUJYGU,"My 2 year old son is interested in robots so we got him this DVD. He really likes it! I like that it's several short episodes instead of one long movie. This way we can stop it before the end without upsetting him. He can also follow the shorter plots better. Very cute animation! Shows kids about day and night, fixing things, the value of having fun vs being too competitive, and more.",1268352000,,387,4.315068493150685
8134675,5,B000GUJYGU,"I had never heard of the ""Little Robots,"" but since my three year old son is obesessed with robots I decided to give it a try.  It's a great video featuring several shorter cartoons.  My son LOVES watching it and we have watched it over and over...",1191110400,5,248,4.25531914893617
8134676,5,B000GUJYGU,"At last on DVD, the sensational British kids' TV show from Cosgrove- Hall, producers of Danger Mouse and Count Duckula. This DVD is copyrighted 2006 Fox, and a Little Robots movie made the rounds of a few theaters in early 2007. Based on the book by Mike Brownlow, the show centers around the antics of about ten robots, animated with the care we've come to associate with Nick Parks' Wallace and Gromit. Each episode is about ten minutes long. You only get four episodes on this DVD, which makes the DVD about 40 minutes long. That seems pricey, but this is one kids will watch over and over and adults will likely find themselves watching along. My DVD included an activity book(let), but I don't know if this is an introductory offer or will be in all copies of the DVD. A standout in the recent glut of animation, Little Robots raises the bar for both quality and creativity with adventures even the youngest can enjoy.

The DVD starts off with ads for other cartoons and animated shows, which is interesting to watch once, so you have to hit the menu button on the remote to get to the shows. I'd rather these ads were put in the special features section, as with movie trailers on films and Coming Attractions and New Releases on TV DVDs, so you could watch them if and when you liked. I promise I'd watch them-- once. Episodes include: Robot Race Day, The Hiccalots, The Sound of Music, and One Hundred.",1172102400,8,1410,4.5078125
