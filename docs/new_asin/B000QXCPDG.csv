8542270,5,B000QXCPDG,"Very well done, non-judgemental documentary on the dangers of smoking, especially for women.  I've never smoked, but was so impressed I bought a copy to share with friends who do.  Highly recommend for anyone (male or female) who is seriously looking for a believable reason to quit.",1281657600,,283,5.0
