8581702,4,B00CHADYCW,"This moving documentary needs to be shown in as many schools and homes as possible so that people never ride the elephants in Thailand or elsewhere in Asia. I'm sure that if people knew the cruelty and suffering inflicted upon the elephants, all for the sake of humans enjoying a ride on them, they would be horrified and would refuse to support such cruelty. If you had a ride already but didn't know about what went on 'behind the scenes', you're not guilty. When you do become aware of how the elephants are beaten into submission, you have a moral duty to act and tell others to not ride an elephant should they visit Thailand and/or other parts of Asia.",1414281600,,658,4.491666666666666
8581703,5,B00CHADYCW,"This documentary opened my eyes to the abuses of elephants in Thailand, and also in American circuses. It is well made and engaging and makes me want to go to Thailand to help the Elephant Nature Center that is at the heart of the story.",1408492800,,237,4.288888888888889
8581704,5,B00CHADYCW,"I love elephants, and have been a fan of elephant paintings for a long time. I had no idea that these poor creatures are horribly abused in order to be made to perform.

While the truth is presented, it's not so graphic that most children couldn't watch it. My young teen son saw the documentary and he wasn't traumatized - but he was rightfully angry and wanting to do something about it.

We need more people in the world like Lek Chailert and Juliette West. Directors Tim Gorski and Synthian Sharp did a great job with this one.",1367193600,7,531,4.408163265306122
8581705,5,B00CHADYCW,"This is a masterful, gut wrenching documentary about a magnificent species that is brutalized beyond human comprehension.  Aldous Huxley said ""Most ignorance is vincible ignorance.  We do not know because we do not want to know.""  We owe it to the elephants to watch this film and help end the trade in ivory, stop the exploitation of these wonderful creatures for our own entertainment and prevent their extinction.  Juliette West is an extraordinary young woman that saw an injustice and did something about it.  I am ever in awe that a fourteen year old girl could go so far and do so much.  Lek Chailert is an amazing, inspirational woman that broke cultural boundaries, fought to receive an education so that she could help not only the elephants, but her own people and her accomplishments are miraculous.  This is a very thought provoking documentary filled with heartache and heartbreak, and it offers hope not only for the elephants, but for mankind as well.  For anyone that loves elephants, this is a must see!",1366848000,7,1021,4.861271676300578
