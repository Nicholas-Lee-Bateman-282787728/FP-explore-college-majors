8095050,5,B000C1VAJM,"I have taken 10-week class from Helene Roy and find her teaching style to be gentle and easy to follow.  In person, she makes sure all students have the proper form and offers many suggestions for alternate positions if individuals aren't able to get into the full, ""proper"" position.  She follows the same engaging, easily understood format in this DVD, plus we are able to see her demonstrate the positions, which is extremely helpful.",1359244800,,437,4.891891891891892
8095051,3,B000C1VAJM,the dvd is good quality and the instructor certainly knows her stuff. these are basic pilates mat moves for a beginner so form is key here. moves a bit too slow for me and is very repetitive. overall ok.,1356134400,,203,4.230769230769231

I love it and since I travel all over the world, finding a pilates studio nearby that you can trust is  challenge. Thanks Helene, your classes ad DVD rock and so does the studio in Vancouver.",1305244800,,336,4.333333333333333
8095053,5,B000C1VAJM,"I found this video in the library and really liked it.  Some of the videos I got before were too difficult for beginners and/or people with physical issues, even with adjustments.  This teaches and gives you time to figure out what to do, with moves that are doable.  So I was really happy to find it for sale.  Beats library late fees.",1269388800,,336,4.370967741935484
