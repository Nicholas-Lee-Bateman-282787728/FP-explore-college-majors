505238,5,630272256X,"My husband and I had seen this movie several time on our TV but our children missed it.  We wanted to purchase a copy as a Christmas gift.  Finding one in the used sections of various stores was impossible, so I went online and learned it was available from [...].  I ordered it and within three days in was in my hands!  Not only was it a swift delivery but the item was new, still in its sealed package.  I would use this method of ordering again.",1168300800,,449,4.114942528735632
505239,3,630272256X,"I am a political junky AND an Eddie Murphy fan and I had great expectations for this movie.  And for the most part the first half has pretty interesting and entertaining.  But the script bogged down and just flattened out towards the end.  EM still makes it fun to watch.  This is a rental, not a purchase.
Boy, politicians should have been great fodder for a comedy but this movie missed its potential",1056585600,5,402,4.465753424657534
505240,4,630272256X,"It is tempting to compare this movie to other political satires of previous years.  However, it is at heart an Eddie Murphy movie, and you know that Eddie Murphy is always over the top.
The plot is relatively simple.  Eddie Murphy is a small-time con artist.  Having recently overheard a conversation between several lobbyists and a congressman, Eddie realizes that (in his opinion) being a congressman is the biggest con of all.  One day he happens to be in the right place at the right time when a congressman with virtually the same name as his dies.  Eddie runs for election to replace the dead congressman with his only platform being that ""you know the name"".  You must know that Eddie wins in a landslide.
Eddie's initial goal is to figure out how he can get as much money as possible.  However, as is the case with all con artists, their undoing is when they begin to care.  In Eddie's case, his undoing is a beautiful woman and a little girl diagnosed with cancer.  The combination of the two makes Eddie care about someone other than himself, and you see Eddie change from that point.
Lane Smith plays Dick Dodge, a senior congressman on the powerful Power and Industry committee.  Dick Dodge is a wheeler and dealer who knows all the ins and outs of Washington, and the best way to wield power and profit from his position.  Initially Eddie looks to Dick as a mentor.  While Eddie initially identified with Dick Dodge, as Eddie discovers that there is a harmful side-effect on ordinary people by the actions of people such as Dodge, Eddie eventually uses his abilities to remove Dodge from power.
This movie is a bit more cerebral than Eddie's typical movies.  ""Trading Places"" was generally slapstick and situational comedy.  ""Beverly Hills Cop"" was one-liners and irony.  The humor in this movie is often more subtle, and in some cases may be lost on some viewers.  There are places in the movie where the humor is slapstick and one-liners, however, much of the humor is satirical and often harder to discern.
While this movie is certainly not Eddie's best, neither is it among his worst.  There are places in the movie that are inspired.  However, for every inspired part of the movie there are tired jokes and typical Washington political satire.  Worth watching once, and collecting for the avid Eddie Murphy fan, this movie rates a low 4 stars.",1051142400,13,2361,4.700729927007299
505241,4,630272256X,"To really appreciate this film, you have to consider that it was released in 1992 when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate and graft and corruption were the rules of Congress. The film centers around Murphy as a con man who gets himself elected to Congress and his attempts to put as much money in his pocket as possible.
In order to maximize his influence with lobbyists, Murphy gets himself appointed to the most powerful committee in Congress, which in real-life is the Ways & Means Committee and when this film was made, was run by Dan Rostenkowski, but in the film is run by the equally corrupt Dick Dodge, played by Lane Smith.
In 1994, Rostenkowski was indicted on corruption charges and stepped down as Ways and Means chairman; he lost his House seat in the Congressional elections later that year. He pleaded guilty to mail fraud in 1996, and was fined and served (1996-97) a 17-month sentence.
One of the great things about this film is how it parallels the real-life Congress and how sleazy things were run under the Democrats when they controlled it. This film is a must for anyone interested in politics and for anyone that would like to see Murphy play a different role than his usual fare.",1038873600,4,1218,4.643518518518518
505242,5,630272256X,"In his long career, we've seen Eddie Murphy in many roles, from cop to crook to royality. In the Distinguished Gentleman, however, we see him in a different role: politician. In the Distinguished Gentleman, Murphy is Thomas Jefferson Johnson, a small-time con man who wants big money...
This movie is a great example of just how... Washington politics is. Murphy comes out well in his preformance. A much better con man preformance than Trading Places. If you're looking to know just how...our system is, give this movie a rent, then you be the judge.",1023753600,,551,4.872340425531915
505243,4,630272256X,"Eddie Murphy is not well known for his bite at the US Government, so upon seeing ""Distinguished Gentleman"", you may either be shocked or impressed.  Regardless, Eddie Murphy is dressed to impress in the politcal satire that takes bite out of politcs and crime.  Kevin Kline put America at edge in his film ""Dave,"" Tim Robbins made a couple great jabs with his movie, ""Bob Roberts.""  ""Distinguished Gentleman"" has some extraordinary funny moments.  Compared to other Eddie Murphy movies, you may get lost in the wickedness.  ""Distinguished Gentleman"" wasn't made for the ""Nutty Professor"" or ""Dr Dolittle"" crowd.  Murphy is at his sharp, witty best in ""Distinguished Gentleman.""  Murphy proves not only is he gifted comic gem in movies today, but with good writing, we don't need to dwell into his blue mouth, in order to score laughs.  Check out ""Distinguished Gentleman,"" and fill out your politcal humor card for a superb satire.",1014681600,14,931,5.03921568627451
505244,4,630272256X,"I believe The Distinguished Gentleman to be underrated beyond belief.  Eddie Murphy delivers his lines brilliantly in what is really a witty script.  While the story is a reach, it's also a hilarious mockery of America's political system and the type of things that really go on in Washington.
The movie is a bit outdated, it has an 80's type of style (although I believe this movie was released in the early 90's), but honestly that's not a bad thing either.  It takes an edge off things, and for the most part Eddie Murphy's crudeness is kept to a minimum.
If you like any of Murphy's work, at least give this one a shot...it's personally my favorite of the movies he's made.",1002585600,17,677,4.532786885245901

At the same time, the movie gives a scary insight as to how and why the U.S. political system is sooooo corrupt.

In this movie Eddie Murphy plays a con man who becomes a congressman.  I will paraphrase one of my favorite lines in the movie:

In a nut shell he happens to overhear a conversation taking place about a representative who is soon to depart the political world.  Murphy's character runs for office, wins, gets a taste of political give and take (mostly take), but soon realizes at some point that maybe he needs to rethink his destiny in life.

A movie about a con-man who decides to run for Congress and wins. Little does he know he is in over his head, but soon leans the tricks of the trade. He not only find out what it's like to be in Congress, but he also learns there are no rules in this dream job. This is a great movie, it's funny, it tugs at ur heart; and it gets back at those crooked members of Congress. They finally get a taste of their own medicine; and realize what it's like when you S###W the people who elected you. I recommend this great early 90's hit to anyone who loves comedy.

505514,2,630272256X,"This is a movie with a good intention of exposing corruption, built on a fake premise - that scammers are opportunistic people with hearts of gold. It highlights the avarice of politicians, but expects us to believe in the fundamental goodness of criminals. There are some funny scenes and lines, but the whole thing is hollow.

The company that made it also struggles with morality. The critic quote on the front of the DVD is, '""Hilarious!"" - The New York Times'. But it's false. Vincent Canby actually said, ""There is something contagious as well as hilarious about Thomas's [Eddie Murphy] delight when, once he's in the Washington swing, he becomes the recipient of so many perks.""

505534,5,630272256X,"Eddie Murphy shines in this very poignant movie that is especially appropriate for the current state of this country.  This movie is classic Eddie Murphy: brash, a little bit vulgar and altogether hilarious.  Eddie Murphy's portrayal of a con-man turned politician is excellent and the supporting cast is perfectly suited to the subject matter.

Eddie's chararacter is a conartist who determines that the big time is in DC instead of Florida.  He and his friends figure out a way, totally american, on how to obtain the promise land. It ends with a romantic transformation of his character to change Washington and put Dick Dodge in jail, where he belongs.

We have watched this movie again and again, and especially enjoyed it in the election year.  You will recognize the politicians who are being parodied in this movie, which makes it even funnier.  If you don't watch this movie again and again, at least watch it every four years.

505561,4,630272256X,"Eddie Murphy is a talent to be reckoned with; he delivers his usual excellence in this top-notch film.  There are other things he did I like better, but this was good.  I learned some things in it - like creatively dealing with corrupt people, organizations and companies -- get your pen out and take notes!  Could you apply everything literally from this fantasy script?  Probably not!  But the object lessons are there.  1.) Don't fume and get angry and do nothing.  2.) If you're angry, don't show it.  3.) Take creative action.  4.) Enjoy the results.  The lessons are there for those who can perceive.  Watch this when you're feeling oppressed by an out-of-control behemoth.  Know that there's generally something you can do, even when you don't think so.  Even if you don't come to this flick looking for valuable life lessons and coping tools for an oppressive regime, it's a good watch for its own sake.",1354147200,,911,4.726114649681529

Do I just need to let them go because I've seen them enough?

The Distinguished Gentleman is another of those ""Golden Age of Murphy"" films that hold up again and again - each viewing bringing laughs.

Although this particular film leans a bit too hard on the redemption and punishment side of things, what makes it all work is Eddie: good-looking, ridiculously charming and smarter than should be allowed.

His supporting cast is pretty impressive as well: James Garner, Charles Dutton, Joe Don Baker and wasn't that Della Reese playing the congressional elevator operator?  Fast-paced, clever dialog and again, Eddie Murphy - in the golden Murphy age.

When you're planning an evening ""Trading Places,"" ""Coming to America,"" ""48 Hours,"" etc, be sure to include ""The Distinguished Gentleman"" too.",1332288000,3,1124,4.77319587628866

505564,4,630272256X,"In director Jonathan Lynn's political comedy THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN, con-man Thomas Jefferson Johnson (Murphy) gets elected to Congress on a scam: he successfully runs on having the same name as a recently deceased congressman (Garner). In D.C. he fits right in, accepts fistsful of PAC and special interest money.

When the new representative from Florida falls for an altruistic lobbyist, he sees first-hand, thanks to her influence, the harm that unregulated industry causes to innocent families. The result is, Rep. T.J. Johnson grows a conscience. He reverses a ""what's in it for me?"" course and sets out to expose insider corruption and the intimidation tactics used by his Power & Industry committee chairman.

Despite some preachiness, this is an underappreciated film that's aged well, with Murphy in top-form. Definitely recommended.

505592,5,630272256X,"Want to be a legal scammer or con-man, go join politics!

This comedy sheds light on the going-ons in political circles. If you've ever wondered why nothing changes in the world, it's because the bozos in politics won't allow concrete change to happen. They wallow their time in games, photo-shoots, and siphoning taxpayers money to their tricks and buddies.

In this movie, comedian Eddie Murphy plays a small-time con-man who saw that the fastest way to make money is to be in the place where money is printed and played - Washington. All you need are big smiles, a great-looking personality, heaps of charisma, and a bag of tricks up your sleeves and a few sleeping partners in crime. When he finally gets to Washington, his first change of heart comes when he meets with a cancer-stricken girl and her mom, and a potential love of his life. A rolling adventure begins as the con-man, Jr. exposes the cons in his superiors in major scandals.

The con games sound like reality to me! If only politicians have a heart and soul these day! They don't want to know that real people are suffering when all they do is to bask in the wealth of taxpayers' money. Now, you know the reality of  politicians is to find ways to steal our hard-earned money with all their games!",1256774400,2,1267,4.592920353982301

the Republican Bob Wilson who had been congressman from California for many years.
This movie turns that idea into farce where con-man brings his gang
to Washington and starts reaping the benefits.
What changes things is his new girl friend, his conscience and a little girl with cancer.
What results is an exposure of a corrupt chairman of an important
committee. I kind of liked the movie and how it points out the flaws

505595,4,630272256X,"The Distinguished Gentleman is one of those movies that was a little too smart for its audience. Because of this, it came and went in theaters. I think its one of Eddie Murphy's better movies.

The story: Eddie Murphy plays Thomas Jefferson Johnson, a small-time crook that runs for Congress and wins. He ran with intentions of getting rich and left with intentions of helping the little people that get ran over by those corporate fat cats in the oval office. This being after he meets up a cancer-stricken girl that is a victim of the power lines over her school.

Eddie Murphy is great as the slick con man and he looks like he wants to be in this movie not like these later flicks where he phones in his performance. Lane Smith is perfect as the corrupted chairman Dick Dodge and so is Joe Don Baker as Olaf Anderson. Victoria Rowell(who plays Celia Kirby) and Charles S. Dutton(who plays Elijah Hawkins) turn in some good performances too. I like how this movie targets the dont-give-a-damn mentality of all of these politicians in the White House. It was good in its satire even when the humor misses(rarely). The Distinguished Gentleman is underrated but is definitely recommended to the crowd that can see past their nose.",1230681600,11,1230,4.689814814814815

Murphy,over the years,starred in many films produced by Paramount,but this one is a property of Hollywood Pictures,a subsidiary of Buena Vista and a sister of Touchstone. Murphy plays a congressman who goes out of his way to frame a colleague of his who's a devious criminal. Murphy is either mildly vulgar or not vulgar at all unlike when he's on stage. Around the time of this 1992 theatrical release,Murphy began to clean his image,in the aspect of film roles.

505597,5,630272256X,"Strategically ""The Roots of Shallow Thinking"" can be traced to the tragedy-of-the-commons, which the late Garrett Hardin ranted so elegantly about.  Envy makes the world go round, so e.g. each individual male citizen is mainly concerned with buying a big house so as to win the girl, relative to his near neighbors.  WHY SHOULD e.g. a male invest heavily in considering policies which benefit the-pork-barrel-as-a-whole, when those resources might have gone into getting the girl ?
OF COURSE you won't find this deep analysis in the film, yet as a thought experiment everyone involved in the making of the film might have read these words each day before filming, this message seems ""baked into"" the film, so much better than being explicitly spelled out.  The ""baked in"" message is so important - pure democracy being as they say ""two wolves and a sheep deciding about lunch"".",1191801600,,877,4.993150684931507
