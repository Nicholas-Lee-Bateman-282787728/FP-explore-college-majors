8325975,4,B001065O72,"A compendium of four lengthy slide shows, with a soundtrack of an interview. Most of the photos in the slideshows have been around in the internet, but the stories John Samsen tells are interesting peeks behind the scenes of automotive design studios. The time span cover years from the early '50's to mid '70's. Samsen tells about his personal life, too.

I felt the DVD would have benefitted if it had had at least a few short videos, too. The slide shows of 18, 32, 60, and 74 minutes contain valuable history, but as an output it's a bit bleak.
