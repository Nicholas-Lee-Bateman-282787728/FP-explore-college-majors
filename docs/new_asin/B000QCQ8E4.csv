2835135,5,B000QCQ8E4,"I've purchased more than a few tapes and DVDs over the years but this one is a pleasure to watch and follow. It gives you an instant flavor for the art in a clear, precise format. Each move is explained and done slow, medium and fast. I also love the feature where you can watch an isolated move all by itself just in case you can't pick it up while following the enitre form. Another important point is that you learn exactly why you are performing the move and shown how to break it down for practical fighting applications. Looking forward to purchasing the other DVDs in this series.",1374537600,,587,4.394495412844036
2835136,4,B000QCQ8E4,"This training tape was nicely done by Master Tak Wah Eng. However, it only last 11 minutes. The tapes has no vocal instruction(s). Thus, paying visual attention if highly recommended. The instructor provides 3 to 4 views which is then repeated breaking down the form which can be easily followed. After the form is completed about 5 stances are presented in a picture clip form my Sifu Koh that last est. 14 seconds.

I gave this tape 4 stars because of the quality and way it was presented. The form is correct and easy to follow.",1344297600,,531,4.53125
2835137,5,B000QCQ8E4,"Very nice job on the Bung Bu DVD!  The DVDs are a very high quality production.  The best I have ever seen.
Sifu Wes Hardy's explanations were very clear and Sean Daily's performance of the form was excellent!
I will definitely be recommending this video to all my students.

2835138,5,B000QCQ8E4,"Excellent format for demonstrating both theory and practice of Bong Bo form and Sevenstar style thus far.  A novice to martial arts would be well served to find an instructor to learn the fundamentals of breathing, chi, posture/stance, delivery, character (etc)--but if you're coming from a background with some martial arts, the martialskill products are particularly good at communicating the forms and the applications.  Some of the supplemental two-person exercises are very useful for developing timing and delivery of strikes.  Over-all, I'd recommend it both for the content of the form which is a library of most of the techniques within the mantis system, and the way the form is taught.  I appreciated greatly the emphasis on waist-power.  A common error is to teach a form/style much more linear, much more ""hard""; another common error seems to be teaching a form as demonstrating movements devoid of application.  Waist-power taught early more quickly translates into application-power for delivery of strikes--especially important to develop this type of power for close-in fighting characteristic of mantis.  This particular form of Bong Bo is close enough to most lineages with some variations that learning it well will not have to be unlearned under another lineage.  Foot-work is explicated, if not always emphasized; the principles are there to be extracted--and this is an important point for sevenstar mantis in particular.  Also appreciate the note that each form should be practiced hundreds of times before achieving moderate proficiency.  The over-all presentation should be a model for others wishing to preserve their branch/style of martial arts.  Nothing replaces a good instructor in person, and nothing replaces multiple partners of different heights, size, strengths, weaknesses, levels-of-knowledge to work with to refine and learn about effectiveness of various applications under different conditions.  But I will agree that most of the tools necessary to learn sevenstar mantis are already present in the form itself and the way it is presented gives a pretty well-rounded understanding.  I was satisfied with the demonstrations of the forms that Wes Hardy, Sean Daily, Carlos Lopez are proficient, show clean form, executed power, poise, timing, and expertise.  Look forward to the complete library of sevenstar forms being released.",1275868800,6,2370,5.511049723756906
2835139,5,B000QCQ8E4,"This seven-star kung fu DVD, like all the other presented in the series offered by Sean Daily and Wes Hardy, is excellent. After purchasing this DVD, noticing that it was very well done, I kept purchasing the other seven-star kung fu DVDs offered by those martial artists.
The Bung Bo Quan or Crushing Step Boxing form is presented in a very competent, neat, and easy too understand way. Images, moves and explanations are optimal and easy to understand, even for beginner kung fu students. Especially noticeable is the fact that about half of the DVD is focused on presenting in a distinguished way the form applications for a real fight contest.
In my personal opinion, as an experienced martial artist, this all DVDs series is the best I have ever seen. I have been through a lot of bad, mediocare, and just ok kung fu Dvds during the past years....but I can say that finally I found what I was looking for.
I would strongly recommend this DVD and the all series to whoever is interested in learning or perfecting the seven-star northern mantis kung fu style.",1266710400,3,1062,4.684491978609626
2835140,5,B000QCQ8E4,"I wish all martial art dvds were made this good.  No skipping, no freezing, it just plays smooth.  The dvd is easy to navigate and there is plenty of information.  The form is shown at full speed, then broken down and applications are taught.  As a long time martial artist with 42 years of practice, I have seen a lot of folks and a lot of videos, few would compare to Sean and his work here.  Oh, and most importantly, this is authentic Mantis Kung Fu.  Besides my training in Tang Soo Do and Hapkido, I have also studied numerous Mantis systems, 7 Star, Tai Mantis, Southern and Korean Mantis and I can assure anyone thinking about buying this dvd or any other dvds by Sean, that this is the real deal.  One last thing, after being in the martial arts for over 4 decades, it is my honest and educated opinion that Mantis kung fu is one of the best systems for overall practicality, thus, if you are new to the idea of Asian self-defense methods and not sure which one to study, then my advice to you is this; you cannot go wrong if you pick Mantis kung fu.",1266710400,7,1059,4.2388059701492535
2835141,4,B000QCQ8E4,"Overall, I was pretty impressed with this DVD. The footage is of Master Tak Wah Eng doing a mantis form: Bong Bo Kuen. This DVD offers the form done once through from three angles, then the form again broken into sections from those same angles. Very good demonstration of Praying Mantis kung fu, although unless you already know the style I'm pretty sure you won't learn to much from it. They don't offer any explaination of what he's doing at all, just the form from the three angles.",1226620800,5,486,4.534090909090909
8195426,1,B000QCQ8E4,"dvd is only 13 minutes long. its a demo of the form, you could just get this on youtube. this is a ripoff",1526428800,,105,3.608695652173913
8195427,5,B000QCQ8E4,"I have practice martial arts for more then 15 years or so.  Unfortunately, due to a set of illnesses that required the need for major surgery, I was unable to continue to practice.  The recovery of both surgery took out a lot of me to the point that I did not practice or returned to martial arts for close to 6 years.  My former teacher is now inducted into the Martial Artis Black Belt Hall Of Fame, Mr. Wesley Ruiz.  As always he inspired me to slowly get back into shape and into form one day at a time.  If you are new to martial arts, if you are new to Kung fu, or if you are a practitioner of the arts but want to enhance your arsenal of defenses, this DVD is not only the best I have seen done thus far, but in the matter in which it has been produced, it is like having the teacher right in your living room.  All forms are explained so that you can understand the philosophy behind the movement, and the movement is shown in three different speeds so you can clearly see both the hand and feet coordination to do the movement correctly.  It also brings a section where you practice drills using the techniques by yourself or a partner, by the numbers also at different speeds.  This allows you not to only perfect your form, and understand the movement and why it is used, you build up speed.  For those who are kung fu practitioners like in other martial arts forms, speed can be the defining factor in protecting yourself.  By doing the steps by the numbers and at different speeds with the instructor in the video, your speed, endurance, and form can only get as good as you decided the time you will put in to the DVD.  This is a DVD I would recommend to anyone and everyone especially those who want to learn one of the oldest forms of Chinese.  I just received the DVD, I sat down and reviewed the DVD to see what it brings and how best to use it.  I truly believe that If I make this my workout routine with an addition of exercises, not only will I be in excellent shape, I will be back to my form.  I will be taking my 2nd degree Black Belt examination in late February.  This is my goal, as I plan to stay with Bong Bo Kuen, one of the oldest forms of Chinese Kung Fu.  I know this DVD will get me ready for my examination, and I will get my 2nd degree by late February or early March.  This is a very good, professionally produce DVD, if you are serious, buy it.  You will learn, you will get in shape and kick a little butt if need be.",1479945600,2,2457,4.115303983228512
8195428,1,B000QCQ8E4,Don't waste your money. This is not an instructional DVD. One kata only.,1477526400,,72,4.615384615384615
8195429,5,B000QCQ8E4,I bought this DVD for my friend who has a black sash in Kung fu and Wing Chun. He advised that the portrayal of the professionals illustrating the moves were second to none with differing speeds for the learner. This DVD is more suitable for those that have a background in martial arts as opposed to a total beginner. Would recommend this 2 DVD set to any martial artist that wants to expand or consolidate their martial arts skill set.,1456963200,,437,4.475
8195430,5,B000QCQ8E4,Clear instructions and practical applications make this a great addition to your martial arts training. There was a small section of slow motion movements missing. But after contacting the company they were extremely helpful and offered excellent customer service. I would recommend this video for sure if you're interested in learning this mantis form.,1433462400,,353,5.555555555555555
8195431,4,B000QCQ8E4,Good program..like the different views and how it was broken down,1431216000,,65,5.0

8195433,2,B000QCQ8E4,"Tak Wah Eng's videos are among the worst of any martial arts videos I've ever seen. These are not by any means instructional. Although his kung fu is good and the form is solid, the production leaves a lot to be desired. This only shows a demonstration of the form from a few different angles with no walkthrough, no instruction, no application, nothing. Some of the moves are intricate enough to make this worthless to attempt to learn from. The only reason I give this 2 stars is because the kung fu is good. As an instructional video, it's worthless.",1406764800,,553,4.54
8195434,5,B000QCQ8E4,"This is an awesome presentation of the form and when I had some technical difficulties they bent over backward to help me. If you are interested in learning the 7 Star Mantis system at home, this would be a great way to start.",1404604800,,226,4.27906976744186
8195435,1,B000QCQ8E4,"I give this stars because it was mostly a documentary and no step-by-step instructions and terrible quality of dvd. in short, very very bad.",1400112000,,140,4.875
