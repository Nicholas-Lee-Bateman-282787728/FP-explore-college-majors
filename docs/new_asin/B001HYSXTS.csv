8310147,5,B001HYSXTS,This movie rocks. Asian Americans gang movie done right. Some of the violence was more fun than expected. Fun watch.,1389139200,,116,4.85
8310148,5,B001HYSXTS,"This movie is awesome. It has everything.  Guns, violence, romance, and little kids kicking the crap out of each other in juvie.  But seriously, David Huynh is a brilliant actor, and did not get nearly enough credit for this movie.  I won't go in to detail about it, but if you like a good action/drama movie, I'd recommend this.",1316044800,,329,4.5423728813559325
8310149,2,B001HYSXTS,"This was a theme that has been well explored in the past, just not in this particular ethnic sub-context.  It mixes ""Asian"" groups to create an Asian community that only exists in the United States, blends in many of the ""old world"" bits and behaviors on the part of elders and the newly arrived, but misfires in focusing on what they do, why they do it, and limits itself to only part of the story, not necessarily the best part.

Not great, but at least somewhat interesting.",1272758400,,477,4.471264367816092
8310150,3,B001HYSXTS,"There are some cool gun fights, but for the most part this movie is boring. It's cheesy and over dramatic, poorly edited and the dialog scales from mediocre to bad, trying to use Cantonese in a gangster movie (especially some of the actors obviously don't speak the language) doesn't work well for a gangster flick.

I like how the protagonist ""Baby"" is Filipino as a child, and grows up to be Chinese. As an indy film I'm sure resources were limited, however it's low budget really showed. Other indys such as ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" were financed through Justin Lin's credit card debt and opting for cold oatmeal for dinner every night, yet it looked like a glitsy studio film. Good attempt, but a miss in my book. A decent movie on a rainy day with nothing else to do.",1250726400,2,770,4.539568345323741
8310151,3,B001HYSXTS,"This movie, although at times interesting, can be contrived and predictable. The dialogue was at times horrible. More of a rental movie...watch it, and forget about it...there are better asian gangster movies out there.",1239148800,,219,5.470588235294118
8310152,5,B001HYSXTS,"Baby doesn't disappoint if you're just looking for violent gangster action, and adds quality film making and intricate storytelling for those requiring a little depth, the complication coming from the fact that the story takes place in three time periods and uses flashbacks.

It's also interesting to see another ethnic group participate in the gangster genre. With Slumdog Millionare out already, all we need are Eskimo Gs.

Kenneth Leung who plays medium Miles Straume on the hit show Lost does a great job as the villain Benny in Baby.",1236211200,2,539,5.044943820224719
