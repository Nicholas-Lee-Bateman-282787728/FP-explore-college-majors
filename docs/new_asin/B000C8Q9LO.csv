8096271,5,B000C8Q9LO,"THIS MOVIE WAS FULL OF LIES,AND DECEIT. TORI SPELLING WAS AWESOME! NOT A LIKELY ROLL FOR HER. THIS IS A STORY ABOUT A YOUNG COLLEGE GUY WHO COMES HOME FROM SCHOOL AND FINDS HIS MOTHER, AND SISTER DEAD, AND HIS FATHER PRESUMEABLY DEAD. NOW HE GOES A WILD GOOSE CHASE TO FIND HIM BECAUSE INFORMATION IS BROUGHT TO HIS ATTENTION THAT HE IS ALIVE AND HIDING. ANYWAY TORI COMES INTO THE PICTURE AS SOMEWHAT OF A CON, MEETS HIM AND HELPS HIM FIND HIS DAD. THE MOVIE IS STRAIGHT FORWARD, IT'S NOT A WHO DID IT BECAUSE YOU FIND OUT FAIRLY SOON. THE GUY IS WAY OVER HIS HEAD.",1388102400,2,566,4.201834862385321
