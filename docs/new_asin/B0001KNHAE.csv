2009536,4,B0001KNHAE,"YOSSI & JAGGER
[Yossi VeJager]

(Israel - 2002)

Aspect ratio: 1.37:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Stereo

Two soldiers in the Israeli army (Ohad Knoller and Yehuda Levi) conduct an illicit romance whilst patrolling the Israeli-Lebanese border, though they are ultimately divided by their need for secrecy and the dangerous nature of their work.

Originally produced for Israeli television, Eytan Fox's engaging drama was screened theatrically in Tel Aviv to great success before opening nationally to even greater commercial and critical acclaim, and has been hailed in some quarters as one of the best gay movies ever made. Running a mere 65 minutes, the film divides its time equally between a platoon of soldiers operating on the Israeli-Lebanese border, and the two men at the center of a clandestine relationship.

Yossi (Knoller) is a brooding commander who feels constrained by his role as a macho authority figure to conceal his sexuality from the conscripts under his command, while Jagger (Levi, a popular Israeli heartthrob whose career was kickstarted by an appearance in the TV soap opera ""Cheers for Love"" in 2001) is one of his subordinates, a carefree guy who wants them to declare their love openly by retiring from the Army and setting up house together. There's a now-famous scene, early in the movie, when Yossi and Jagger make love in the snow (don't get excited - all you see are some lingering kisses and the aftermath, in which the two characters are entirely at ease with one another, free from the restraints imposed by Army discipline), but their romance takes up a surprisingly small part of the movie, which appears to have been curtailed for reasons of length (there's a number of images doing the rounds - one of which appears on the back of this DVD - from scenes which were apparently shot but didn't make it to the final print).

Based on a true story, the film is warm-hearted but inconsequential, with some annoyingly jerky hand-held camera movements, and the climactic scenes are a little too restrained to be entirely successful (though Knoller, in particular, gives a truly remarkbale performance in the aftermath of a major plot development). There's still much to admire, and any reservations are dispelled by the central romance, depicted with disarming frankness and performed with relish by Knoller and Levi. Highly recommended.",1084147200,21,2367,5.103359173126615
2009537,5,B0001KNHAE,"I kept waiting for this movie to make it to our local art theater but it never came.  Luckily it has arrived on dvd and I have finally had the chance to see it.  Barely over an hour long, this small love story delivers a punch and good performances from the lead actors.  A bonus in the film is a lot of Israeli culture and insight into the life of young Israeli soldiers.
The story centers around two soldiers, Yossi, a respected leader and Lior (or Jagger, as his friends call him, because of his rock star good looks and charisma).  Because they are gay, their love is kept secret---a position Yossi is fine with and Jagger is tired of and wants changed.  The two lovers sneak away when time permits and the love they share is warm and genuine.  The chemistry between the two actors if believable and you find yourself hoping for the two to live ""happily ever after"".
There is not much in the way of extra features on the dvd (there is a video of the song Jagger sings to Yossi after their bout in the snow) and a few previews of other Strand Releasing videos and dvds.  But it is the film that is important and this one is well worth adding to your dvd library.  I highly recommend this touching love story to anyone!",1083369600,4,1221,4.278260869565218
2009538,5,B0001KNHAE,"Being an Israeli, I absolutely hate Israeli movies. I can't say why exactly, but it might be due to the undeveloped movie-industry here that usually produces bad movies. That said, I didn't expect this movie to be much of anything and certainly wasn't expecting to be met with one of the most beautiful and true movies I have ever seen.
""Yossi and Jagger"" is sad, sweet, romantic and oh - so Israeli. It's dripping with Israeli culture, humor and problems, so much so that I would expect anyone who is not an Israeli might not understand the movie fully. It is also completely Kitsch-free and very short. It holds no Hollywood qualities and will probably do rather badly with mainstream cinema audience. On the other hand, the ""Anti-War"" statement that this movie supposedly raises will be much better understood out of Israel. The military aspect of the film, unlike the gay aspect, seems completely natural to the Israeli audience and therefore doesn't shock them.
The movie portraits the Israeli military experience perfectly. So perfectly that it feels as if you're listening to you're friends, talking about what they did this week over at ""their base"".
The personal and painful drama of Israel that this creation brings fourth has made this movie stay with me long after I have watched it and depressed me for days. I am not sure if the emotional response will be as strong for someone who doesn't deal with that reality on a daily basis, but without even seeing the DVD itself, my recommendation is without doubt to give it a try.",1083024000,10,1537,4.7819548872180455
2009539,4,B0001KNHAE,"YOSSI AND JAGGER is an important film on many levels: it deals with gay relationships in the military in a country known for its lack of support for gender issues, it manages to make a small independent film seem like a major studio production, and it introduces to the rest of the world the gifts of Director Eytan Fox and actors of the caliber of Ohad Knoller (Yossi - a lifetime military type who is in love with his subordinate officer), Yehuda Levi (Jagger - called that because of his resemblance to the rock star and who returns the love of his commanding officer Yossi), Assi Cohen (Ofir - the soldier who is caught in a triangle with a female soldier (Yaeli - the luminous Aya Steinovitz) who happens to be in love with Jagger),and Sharon Raginiano(the Colonel who demands 'military behavior' while abusing his own authority with the female recruits). The story is brief, the love between the two main characters is palpably real, and the tragic ending is made more tragic because of the response of all concerned in maintaining the agony of closeted gays. This film is understated, deals with its issues, and then leaves the audience to fill in the blanks as far as what happens because of the ending. A film beautifully created with subtle impact. In Hebrew with English subtitles.",1082419200,11,1292,4.721238938053097
2009540,5,B0001KNHAE,"This movie is a true story about a gay love in a military environment.  Great actors, simple approach.  It must be seen.",1081814400,,120,4.409090909090909
2009541,4,B0001KNHAE,"This Israeli film clocks in at just a little over 1 hour but it manages to establish more character development than most films twice that length as well as displaying a complex array of human emotions.
The story takes place in an army camp on a remote snowy mountaintop near the Lebanon border. Yossi, a commander, is in love with the cute and free spirited soldier Jagger. Yossi has a ""don't ask, don't tell"" view on their relationship while Jagger is much more open and wants to be able to rent a hotel room ""with one bed, not two."" The film deftly handles the intricies of their relationship but this is much more than a gay romance film. The dullness and claustrophobic conditions of army life is skillfully depicted with the help of a shaky camera that gives the film a documentary look.
Secondary characters sustain interest also and include two female soldiers - one is having an affair with a married officer and the other has a crush on Jagger, despite the fact that almost everyone has told her that ""you're not really his type.""
This film could probably have been more affecting with a little more time (the ending seems a little abrupt) but it still delivers quite a punch for such a small film.
The only dvd extras are a music video which is a shame. It would have been nice to learn more about the filmmaker and the wonderful actors who appear in the film.",1081382400,10,1371,4.51004016064257
2009542,5,B0001KNHAE,"I, like many reviewers of this film, was very pleasantly surprised when I viewed it.  It was simply fantastic!  I can not sing the praises of this movie enough.  The emotion, and superb acting more than transcended the language barrier.  The cast was attractive too, if that helps any of you out there decide to see it.  It's a touching loves story, between two Israeli soldiers, and it plays well on the heart strings.  The plot is simple, and yet one of the most effective plots I have encountered in a great long while.  It could be considered sad, but it is so uplifting at the same moment, and show that love is universal regardless of the genders of the ones in love.  This is a must have for the movie lover, and also those who collect gay cineman.  It is a moving story regardless of the sexual persuasion of the viewer, and there is something for everyone.  Hope this review has proved useful.",1080691200,6,902,4.445121951219512
2009543,4,B0001KNHAE,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this Israeli film about the love between two male soldiers, and I was pleasantly surprised by the humor and surprisingly moved by the clandestine love between uptight Yossi and the more free-spirited Jagger (called that because he looks and acts like a rock star).

The main two characters share a short but tragic love that the song of the movie "" your song"" capters be  perfectly. Thou short you cannot watch it without crying at the end.

It never really lets you get to know the characters in a way that make you care about them.  It feels like they devote more time to one of the female soldiers, who likes Jagger, than to the relationship between him and Yossi.

2009587,5,B0001KNHAE,"This movie is about a gay couple in the Israeli military. It is not, however, a ""gay"" movie. It has antagonistic elements that arise because of the setting and social constructions. It is exceptionally well acted and has a lot of heart. The production value is lower because of a number of factors that have nothing to do with the care that would put into it (mainly budget). Great movie. The DVD is simple with a single music video as the special features. This movie is about the characters, not about the special features.",1426982400,,525,4.595744680851064

For we who have had gay affairs while in the military a touch of nostalgia was added to the dangerous situations recreated in the film.  The entire film is chopped into little vignettes like Gestalts packages of thought.  I watched it several times just to study the sets, lighting, cinematography, and body language so effectively used to frame each vignette.  Well worth watching several times.  Enjoy!

In the interrelationships among those in the encampent close to the battle zone is really interesting - including two women who are really interesting and fun people to see!  Would that there had such attitudes in our own armed forces as here - totally open and uncomplicated, and accepted - although Yossi does try to keep his love hidden - but not from the women who figure it all out.  A really sad ending, Yossi realizing too late how mistaken he was not to be more forthcoming about the romance.

2009654,5,B0001KNHAE,"I first saw this film about 10 years ago, when it was released, and thought was very moved by it, particularly in its documentary-style filming and the various characters besides the main two whom we get to connect with.  I watched it again last night and then it's follow-up/sequel, ""Yossi"" also by Eytan Fox.  Yossi & Jagger (latter nicknamed after the lead from the Rolling Stones, due to his rock-star style and clownish affability).  An excellent, bittersweet story of two young Israeli soldiers on the Lebanon front.  Jagger is honest and open about his love for Yossi, and he also has a female soldier who has a crush on him.  Jagger also wants Yossi to leave the service at the same time he does so that they can be together - Jagger telling Yossi he intends on telling his parents about his sexuality at this time, too. Yossi is very much in love with Jagger, but struggling with his more conservative upbringing and the reserve he feels necessary to his role as a squad commander, he is unwilling to be as open about his love for Jagger.
For a very short film - only 71 minutes - this film packs a lot of romance, tenderness, reality and drama, comedy and Jewish/Israeli culture.  There is a lovely video included on the disc of the 'love song' - though no subtitling of the lyrics, sadly.  All in all, I highly recommend seeing - and owning - this excellent film.",1374019200,,1374,4.538461538461538

The characters are well developed to show the challenges they have as individuals and as a couple. The other supporting characters build some strength as well to help round out this world at the edge of Israeli security in Lebanon.  Strong cast delivers good performances individually and as a group. I liked the production values, too, which gave a sense of life in cramped quarters for the conscription army.

2009674,5,B0001KNHAE,"It has been almost 10 years since its release, and when I first saw the film. I wanted to revisit it after recently seeing Fox's new film, YOSSI. I am pleased that I did, because it put much into perspective that I had, honestly, forgotten. The film is tender, sensitive, and presents a window into not only the socio-politics within Israel, but how its men seem to be comfortable with male sexuality, perhaps more comfortable than many in the US are. Well worth viewing.",1367020800,,471,4.619047619047619
2009675,5,B0001KNHAE,"Yossi and Jagger is both an obviously niche, low budget film, and at the same time, a pioneering breakthrough.  It's plot is simple and given the times in which its main characters live, all too real.  Two gay guys are pretty much on what is nowadays in USA called, the Down Low.  That is, each gay man is hidden, invisible, having learned how to blend in with majority straight society of the era which for the most part does not know that (A) sexual minority people exist, and (B) SMP exist right among us.  Also true to fashion - how many late night drinks have I bought for heart-broken friends whose paramours have just broken up with them, because one was kinda Out and the other was not? - one man in this couple is not very Out, and is really afraid of being Out.  The other man's reaction to feeling loved is that he is outgrowing his former closeted, invisible life, so he wants to be Out as a gay man.  These are simple plot elements, but the quality of the acting and film making raises cliche to reality.  I won't spoil the plot twists or turns by describing them, but suffice it to say that this film is all too true to LGBTQ live in that era, as well as being an essentially sweet, good-hearted take on what happens so differently two two guys in love.

This one is so very refreshingly different.

This one was a gripping movie. I've never been in an Israeli soldier outpost but to me it seem very realistic. Meaning I pretty quickly forgot that these were actors on a set.

It had a lot going on.

Yes, the two lead characters are in a gay relationship.

But it would have been a gripping movie without that.

It all seemed so plausible. The two men are soldiers, but there wasn't some sort of ridiculous overbuilt machismo about them.

There were several well thought out subplots as well.

Wars create a mixture of people whose personalities would not normally mix, and an opportunity for men to find out who they really are.

Problem is he's the cutest guy in the base (his nickname - Jagger - refers to his spunky youthfulness and beauty).

It is set in a remote and beautiful location and despite the shortness of the film it delivers a satisfying if poignant message of youth, life and the specter of death that is always in the background for these soldiers.

Yossi is the units commander and is very aware of his position and his responsibilities. Lior, also known as Jagger because he's charismatic like a rock star (and hot like one!), is one of the other officers and is well liked by all. The one person Jagger truly loves is Yossi. Jagger is soon to be released from his service in the IDF and wants further commitment from Yossi. Unfortunately Yossi has his own plans of furthering his military career. The dynamics of the troop and the little cameos from each character and how they deal with their isolation, youth and emerging love are engaging.

The romance between Yossi and Jagger is sweet and moving. I loved the scene of the boys running round and goofing off in the snow. And the pervy bunny! My favorite moment is near the end with Yossi's reference to the song by Rita and its importance to Lior.

The script was based on a true story but I could not find any reference to the original author. The screenplay was written by Avner Bernheimer and directed by Eytan Fox.",1223251200,3,1339,4.570833333333334

'Yossi' itself is a scant 71 minutes, but Fox makes every minute count.  What strikes me is the relevance of Fox's work.  If you look at 2006's Second Lebanon War (a.k.a., The July War), it was set off by border skirmishes and kidnappings of Israeli soldiers on the northern front.  Fighting put northern Israeli cities into peril from Hezbollah rockets.  Those are the themes that fuel and run through ""Yossi and Jagger"" and ""The Bubble.""  Fox and co-writer (and partner) Gal Uchovsky get my respect for the way they've crafted these realistic dramatic arcs.

The other treat here is Aya Koren (here credited as 'Aya Steinovitz' - pre-marriage I suppose) as 'Yaeli'.  This is the most beautiful woman in film, but IMDB lists her last on-screen appearance in 2004.  Seriously, what is up with that?

Yossi and Jagger are two soldiers in an Israeli army, monitoring the Lebanese border.  Unknown to their comrades, they are lovers.  They go off in little missions together only to spend intimate moments with each other.  Jagger wants Yossi to leave the army but Yossi loves the military life.

Pros:
1) Many themes: love, lust, sex, infidelity, promiscuity, homosexuality, heterosexuality, war, death

Cons:

1) NOT IN ENGLISH
2) Too much focus on minor characters.
3) Too short
4) Only one, brief ""love scene""
5) Characters are too underdeveloped, we know to little about them

Longer version:

Yossi & Jagger certainly isn't the best film I've ever seen. However, its somewhat watchable but certainly not worth watching a second time.

I felt that story didn't focus enough on the main characters.

The film is already too short in my opinion, only 74 minutes. It is impossible to fully develop characters in that time. It is like writing your life's story in only 50 words. Impossible.

I personally I felt I didn't know Jagger and Yossi very well, especially Jagger. So many questions are left open.

The film just stats at them being in the army and are in love. Ok . .  that fine but who are Jagger and Yossi? How, where and when did they meet? Where they always in the in the army? Were they both aware of their sexuality when they met? How long have they been together? Why do they love each other?

Instead of answering these questions the film wastes a lot of time on minor characters and themes that no one really cares about.

2009723,5,B0001KNHAE,"This is without a doubt, the sweetest yet most poignant love story I have ever seen on film, which is astounding given its totally atypical setting. Yossi and Jagger are Israeli military conscripts, part of a platoon guarding an icy, isolated outpost. Unknown to everyone around them, they are also lovers. Jagger (played by Yehuda Levi) is the free-spirited one, more comfortable with his sexuality, who wants the world to know about his love. He's about to finish his service with the army and has dreams of eventually living openly with the love of his life.

Yossi on the other hand (played by Ohad Knoller) - who just happens to also be Jagger's commanding officer - is more restrained and intent on keeping his sexual orientation and his relationship private. All the while, Ya'eli, a beautiful female soldier (played by Aya Steinovitz) pines for Jagger but he's patently oblivious to her love for him. Thus the scene is set for an engrossing story. Some interesting issues about homosexuality are raised, some stereotypes are challenged and myths destroyed. I was blown away. The movie reminded me of the 2005 movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jarhead-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000DZIGDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jarhead (Widescreen Edition)</a>, in that the largest proportion of it is spent watching soldiers waiting for something to happen. It finally does though, and there are tragic consequences.

What I love most of all about this movie is the way it neatly (and wisely) sidesteps the political realities of the region by refraining from introducing us to the enemy the Israeli army are fighting. They are never even mentioned by name. We can guess whom they might be fighting but we'll never know for sure. We are thus able to focus on the real story here without any distractions. At just over an hour long, the movie is notably short but director Eytan Fox ensures that it manages to tell its story with no compromise. ""Unusually subtle and convincing,"" said the New York Times, ""A searing, tense and beautifully told film,"" said the Philadelphia Inquirer. I say believe them both. It's apparently based on a true story and has brilliantly drawn supporting characters, most notable of all (from a personal standpoint) being Ophir, played by Assi Cohen. I will be watching one this again and again.

DVD extras include a song from the movie (Jagger loved it), a stills gallery featuring some of the movie's stars and trailers of other TLA releases. The movie is in Hebrew with optional English subtitles.

First time screenwriter Avner Bernheimer's script doesn't take the story and make either a profound point or an unforgettable experience.

He's a rough & tumble masculine fighting man who worries about the physical condition of his soldiers.

Levi won a Best Actor Award from the Israeli TV Academy for the film.  Some of the soldiers appear aware and unfazed by the relationship, while most are oblivious to it.  Obviously, the guys are operating from a ""don't ask, don't tell"" model within the military structure.  Levi is so good looking that the other soldiers refer to him as ""Jagger,"" based on the Rolling Stones' lead singer Mick Jagger.  The complication in the movie comes in the form of an unrealized love triangle (or maybe quadrangle).  Assi Cohen, who played a newlywed man in the film ""Munich,"" plays Ophir who has a crush on female soldier Yaeli played by Aya Koren.  She is a dark-haired beauty who loves Jagger.  She is not aware that Jagger prefers the company of men & pursues him with increasing frustration.  Her friend Goldie is played by Hani Furstenberg in what I believe was her first film.  Goldie satisfies the general's battlefield needs without romantic illusions.  Ophir becomes angry with Jagger because Yaeli will not respond to Ophir's advances.  Jagger becomes angry with Yossi because he won't commit to him and plan a post-military life together.  War events then intervene and shatter everyone's expectations.  The setting of the film reminded me of a wartime Israeli version of the M.A.S.H. TV show with its barren landscape and primitive battlefield accommodations.

Their story is simple and straight-forward. They are lovers in time of war and have to keep their love secret in very close quarters.

While I do not want to spoil the ending for those who haven't seen this film, there is a particularly bittersweet scene near the end of the movie when Jagger's mother remembers that there were so many things about him that she never knew. There is the obligatory romance that a young woman soldier fabricates with Jagger and her. She does everything she can think of while in combat to bed him, even supposedly losing a contact lens when her nose is inches from his. She never gets it; it is amazing that even in 2004 that straight women still act this way around gay men.

Set in the background of the Israeli armed forces during the war in Lebanon, the movie follows a company of soldiers, both male and female, and their interactions as typical young people while stationed in an outpost. The movie is made in a snapshot-like manner rather than in developing a full plot, which allows the contrast between the intimacy and exuberance of the young soldiers on the one hand and the constant tension of war on the other hand to be shown to full effect. The downside of this is that the movie is rather confusing at the beginning (as none of the characters are clearly introduced) and that it is very short, just over one hour.

The men and women of the movie are astonishingly good-looking, usually a clue that what you're about to see holds no substance beyond that (see ""Latter Days"" or better yet, DON'T see Latter Days, a movie so bad it made me want to beat puppies), but there is real depth to the characters.  Yossi, the commander of the squadron, and in love with his second in command (Jagger), cares about his mission and those he commands, and Jagger is no less conscientious but definitely more romantically minded and ponders the future beyond their time in the Army.  The characters complement and foil each other well, as good protagonists should.  The writing is fairly taut, so taut in fact that even with some obvious padding the movie clocks in at around 63 minutes.  It's the kind of straight-forward honest story telling that is frankly missing from a lot of Gay  themed movies (well, a lot of movies, period, to be honest).",1139529600,6,1219,4.831730769230769

Jagger is a popular soldier, renowned for his good looks and likeable personality. The tension  in their relationship reaches its climax during one of the military missions.

Personally I found this to be one of the most interesting and beautiful films about gay men. While it is very short (65 mins)the relationship is quickly established and we the audience are treated to a ""day in the life of..."" styled film. One moment the film reveals the physical aspects of the two men's relationship while next there are other scenes where people are just goofing off or eating. Working on the Israeli/ Lebanon ambush could happen at any minute events related to the film help move the plot forward. The film is neither preachy nor political or some grand statement about life. Its just two guys in love and what happens to them.

The actors did a fantastic job and I was truly touched even if I was a little sad by the films conclusion.

The first is Lior Amichai, affectionately called ""Jagger"" for his love of the noted singer. The other is his companion and secret lover Yossi who despite command responsibilities, yearns for a time when he and Jagger can openly express their love. Arrayed against this union are the tragedies of life. There is Aya who also loves Jagger and in turn is sought after by others in the tiny force. The squad like most common soldiers, long to return home and dream of peace. It is rare that a film elevates gay love to such a poignant level, but this story does just that. It captures the true sentiments of both characters and tugs at the heart of any who have ever been in love amid the turmoil of conflict.

2009783,1,B0001KNHAE,"Yosso & Jagger is Like a shockingly ugly baby,... only its mother could claim to love it, and she'd by lying too.

Better you should watch ""Come Undone"" or ""Nico and Dani"" or ""Making Love"" or ""His Secret Life"" or ""Latter Days"" all in the same genre, only they are all GOOD movies. I've reviewed each of them on Amazon.

As for ""Y&J"": Moviemaking is about the art of good storytelling. An artful hand can make a poor story idea seem like entertainment for ninety minutes. Yossi & Jagger is proof that the contrary is also true. Here, an adequate story idea was ruined by people who have no idea how to tell a story in an artful, compelling, entertaining method.

Always the optimist, in my searching for something about this movie to recommend, I find only one suggestion: Watch some other movie instead. Based on what this film claims to be, I recommend LATTER DAYS, a very enjoyable movie I didn't want to like, but did anyway, happily the opposite of Yossi & Jagger, a sadly inept production I very much wanted to like, but couldn't.

Several things came together to keep this flick from being a competent attempt at entertainment: The script, the acting, the directing, the production, and other fundamental elements. While the premise, though cliche, was good enough, the execution of that idea was mind-numbingly sophmoric. As much as I wanted to enjoy Yossi & Jagger, the truth is that the Editorial Review, penned by Tom Keogh, is far better than the movie itself.

Perhaps the only thing worse than a director who doesn't know how to tell a story is the one who knows not when to quit. This one is both. The one moment that came close to living up to Keogh's promise for the film came too late to make any difference to those who'd managed to suffer through to that point so late in the movie. That was when Yossi finally tells Jagger, ""I love you"", only it's too late, as Jagger had just died. You'd think they'd have cut their losses and ended the movie right then and there, a logical point for an ending. Alas, that was not to be, and much like the earlier parts of the movie, they lumbered on, without adding anything of substance. They must have had extra film, because they kept going, to no useful purpose.

Having not chosen to attend the 2003 Tribeca Film Festival, I must assume that the most likely explanation for the Best Actor award for Ohad Knoller reflects a woeful lack of worthy nominees. Either that, or blatantly defective judges.",1130025600,7,2459,4.577272727272727

2009788,4,B0001KNHAE,"Yossi & Jagger - A review

Yossi & Jagger, an Israeli gay film by Eyten Fox is poignant tale about two Israeli Army officers stationed in a cold far-away area of Israel. While the Israeli Army and Military allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in their services, does not necessarily mean that people are still out and open about their sexuality. We see this in the movie. I was blown away at the depth of the movie. The movie just shows one day in the life of this military unit stationed in the cold hills of Israel. They are warned of an impending ambush attack that night and they spend the day preparing for it. The commander is Yossi. He seems like the typical clean-cut hard-nosed military officer. His second in command is Liom (Jagger), who has the handsomely rock star looks and personality hence his nickname. They explore their love together and struggle with coming to terms of what it really means to be in love and want to share that excitement with the world. Jagger is all for finally getting a queen size bed when they vacation, but Yossi is still stuck in the ""I don't know.. maybe pushing together two bed's is still better"" attitude. It is only when their love seems doomed does Yossi come around. But is it too late? Will Jagger accept his terms and be happy? I guess you will just have to get the movie like I did and see for yourself.

I rate this movie 4 triangles (out of 5). The movie is slow at times, and its filming is sometimes reminiscent of home video, but that is what makes this tale more touching. Its like a look into the private lives of two men who are falling in love with each other and struggling with a ""Don't ask, Don't tell"" situation and mentality.

A definite pick to watch!

I usually have something to say about character development, which seemed to be lacking in this film, however the character development is just not needed here.

I can't help but feeling that one particular character lost just about everything. They had a secret relationship, and in the end, it was like it never existed.

happens to be now, and in Israel.

With great mastery, Mr. Fox has put together a stunning ensemble of
characters that are diverse, real, funny, and human. Outstanding are
Ohad Knoller as Yossi, commander of the unit, and Yehuda Levi as his
lover. They prove that opposites attract: Yossi is a career man who has
stepped out of character to love Jagger, is afraid of discovery, and
reluctant to declare his love; Jagger, so nick-named because of his
seductive 'rock star' looks (Mick was sexy, too, but never this sweet
and seraphically beautiful), is a free spirit who longs to live in the
open with his partner. The two fight over this just before a disastrous
foray into dangerous territory. Their parting will break your heart

The affection and intimacy shown between Yossi and Jagger (and especially at the beginning) just made me smile... why is violence more acceptable than tenderness?

On some level, I do feel sorry for Yaeli, mainly because loves Jagger and she's unwitting of the fact that Jagger is gay... but I don't like her; I know that she's unwitting of Jagger's secret, but I still see her as this Jezebel, trying to take Jagger away from Yossi.

It felt like I'd been kicked in the gut when Yossi kept their romance secret the whole time... as though it was forbidden to be known... but looking at the photographs of Jagger at the end... and that beautiful song, ""Your Soul""... how can one not cry? And why are we so blind to the gritty reality of war after it has been proven time and again of how brutal it is? Nobody should have to suffer like that... nobody should have to lose somebody that they love...

It's also heartbreaking beacuse this is almost the same thing that's happening to all of those poor soldiers out there in the world... their poor families... nobody should have to waste their lives in the trenches.

Despite the sad ending, I do feel some joy, in that Yossi will carry those memories of Jagger... and perhaps be reunited with him... someday...

2009823,5,B0001KNHAE,"On, first viewing of this film, I too wanted more.  I, at first, thought that it (the film) was too short, that there was not enough story; that there was not enough affection shown between the two lovers and, most of all that the ending was not satisfying (I wanted, somehow for all to end-though impossible-happily).  After subsequent viewings, I began to realize that what was being portrayed was closer to ""real life"" than fiction.

The story is about an illicit (or at least, very frowned upon) wartime romance between two male soldiers in Israel-a romance between a soldier that is very comfortable with himself and his gayness and a soldier that is actually in the closet (very concerned with being a ""good"" soldier.) One gets the strong feeling that they really do love each other; however, the closeted soldier was forever looking over his shoulder not able to overtly express his feelings until much TOO LATE.  I'm sure any gay romance in a military situation, especially on the front lines, is fraught with many dangers making for a very uncomfortable situation for those involved.  When viewed with some understanding I do feel the film gives the viewer a sample of what it must be like to be involved in a gay romance in the aforesaid circumstance. Also captured in this film are the dangers, the suffocating atmosphere, the sexual tensions along with the unrequited loves and infatuations that can occur in war.

Only when Jagger is dying can Yossi tell him that he really loves him and wants to be with him not caring that another soldier can hear him.  But, of course, it's too late.  However, Yossi is left with wonderful and beautiful memories of his lover that will last him a lifetime.  I got the feeling that Yossi would ""carry a torch"" for Jagger the rest of his life.

2009825,5,B0001KNHAE,"After a brief stint in Hollywood, director Eytan Fox returned to Israel and made this beautiful and passionate film which speaks through its simplicity. Though 65 minutes long, Yossi and Jagger captures the spirited elan and tensions of Israeli youths in the armed forces and presents certainly one of the most resonant film romances I have been fortunate enough to watch.

The film makes good use by perverting its own clichs with its characterisations and a predictable, sentimental story. The surprise is a truly touching portrait of youth on the front lines. In war some lose their limbs, some their minds and others their loves, only to be reborn. Yossi and Jagger doesn't wallow in it: it's fast moving; there's no time for preaching. Not until the film is over will you really start to consider its realities.

Yossi and Jagger makes no plea for any cause. That makes it immensely watchable. Here are two people in love, and other (unrequited) love interests, each with distinct personalities, frame that image, each character pushing its own personal objectives, whims, desires and dreams.

Ohad Knoller(stage credits) and popular Israeli tv star Yehuda Levi give excelling performances.

Yet the film succeeds for two reasons: Fox's ability to convey the claustrophia of life in a military bunker--the obvious low budget is turned to advantage here--and the efforts of an Israeli cast that is not only attractive but talented, with particularly excellent work from the two male leads and the beautiful Aya Steinovitz as a wistful female soldier. Though the course of the plot is ultimately predictable and there are some uncertainties of tone, lurching between harsh realism and gauzy romance (a slow-motion snowball fight, of all things, is interpolated at one point), overall, the film takes a potentially explosive issue and makes it work through its low-key naturalism and refusal to overdramatize.",1088294400,8,962,5.253246753246753

But , the two movies had nothing in common except they were made in Isreal. Yossi and Jagger is a bittersweet love affair between two Isreali soldiers, very well played by Yehuda Levi , and Ohad Knoller, you could feel the love they had for each other and the hurt Jagger was going thru because they had to be so careful as they were officers. Its hard to get a real grip on the characters as its only 67 min long and leaves you grasping for more. But Eytan Fox did a splendid job with the time he had. The song that Jagger sings is haunting in the extra video on the disc.

2009831,5,B0001KNHAE,"""Yossi and Jagger"" is a touching and realistic film based on a true story about two Israeli Soldiers who love each other. At a mere 67 minutes, this movie packs in substantial messages. In one of the movie's trailers, there is a statement that pretty much sums up the movie, ""Love Should Never be a Secret."" How sad that being gay and in love has to be an exception.
An outpost of the Israeli-Lebanese border is the setting of the film where the two army commanders maintain secrecy about their relationship-similar to America's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy. Even if the other soldiers suspect, they do not make an issue out of the fact that their leaders are gay but you get the distinct feeling they would rather not know.
The viewers get a sense of what it must be like to live in a constant state of war, fear, and fighting, while defending one's country. While many young people are partying, going to school, falling in love, and enjoying their youth, Israeli youth are drafted into the Army and ordered to risk their lives every day. What kinds of hopes and dreams can these people have when they are fighting for survival? It is inspiring to see how they allow themselves simple pleasures in life to remember what they are fighting for and to maintain their sanity. They seek love, companionship, and fun to get them through this difficult time of uncertainty in their lives.
Yossi (Ohad Knoller) and Jagger's (Yehuda Levi) poignant love story is all too real. Yossi, first commander, wants to keep their affair a secret and Jagger, second commander, wants to tell the world. Jagger is growing tired of hiding his love and being ashamed of it. He is close to the end of his tour and he asks Yossi to retire from the army when he does. He longs for an open and honest relationship with the love of his life. Yossi feels he can never change and is unable or unwilling to declare his love for Jagger publicly or privately. Even though Jagger knows Yossi loves him, he wants to hear him say it.
 I recommend this movie for its depth and realism. It is real without being too gory in its depiction of war but its powerful message is all too loud and clear. War is senseless and a severe weakness of the human condition. It reminds us of our failings to get along with our neighbors, which often meets with a tragic end.",1085961600,27,2324,4.507109004739337
