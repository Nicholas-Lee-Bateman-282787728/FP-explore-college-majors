8636902,4,B00HWGKMC6,"Overall I liked this French drama, here are the pros and cons as I see it.
Pros:
1. Daniel Auteuil once again does not disappoint with his fantastic acting skills.
2. The ended was actually a surprise, which wass great as I usually have them figured out way before hand.
3. Nice cinematography.
4. Some interesting family and interpersonal communication difficulties to examine.
Cons:
1. A little slow in parts and some parts do not tie in very well with each other.
2. Not a super upbeat film if that is what you are looking for.",1522972800,,530,4.53125

8636904,3,B00HWGKMC6,"Good acting in a tepid film. I borrowed the film from a library, and just saw it.
Not worth the high price of the DVD for sale. The ending is a bit of a surprise. Some reviewers liked the ending, some didn't.  On the Rotten Tomatoes website, there are two negative reviews and there's an interesting negative review from the ""Telegraph"" newspaper that I agree with.  Worth seeing for the good acting, but I wouldn't want to buy it and own it.",1460160000,,442,4.378048780487805

8636906,4,B00HWGKMC6,"""Avant L'Hiver"" (2013 release from France; 105 min.; US title"" ""Before the Winter Chill"") brings the story of a married couple, Paul and Lucie (played by Daniel Auteuil and Kristen Scott Thomas, respectively). As the movie opens, we get to know Paul as a successful neurosurgeon who spends too much time focusing on his job and not enough time on his wife. Then one day Paul runs into Lou, a bartender whom he had treated once when she was a young child. It is not long before it becomes clear that Lou (played by Lela Bekhti) has a strong interest in Paul. Will Paul reciprocate? Meanwhile Lucie needs to deal with her unstable sister Mathilde, and Paul's business partner in his private practice, Gerard, seems to have an unusual interest in Paul's wife Lucie. Will Lucie reciprocate? To tell you more of this plot-heavy movie would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is written and directed by Philippe Claudel, who a couple of years ago brought us that nice movie ""Touts Les Soleils"". As it turns out, ""Avant l'Hiver"" is a fairly straight-forward relationship drama, focusing on whether the marriage of Paul and Lucie can survive all of the commotions they find themselves in. Beware: this movie is neither a ""thriller"", slow-burning or not, nor a ""Fatal Attraction""-type movie, as has been buzzed about in certain corners of the internet. I absolutely enjoyed the acting performance of Daniel Auteuil from start to finish. He has a natural ability for these types of roles. Kristen Scott Thomas on the other hand seems to play this kind of a role quite a bit in French movies, and I'm sure she could could do this in her sleep without even trying. Finally, Lela Bekhti, in the role of the younger woman, is not only stunningly beautiful but she brings a certain stage presence onto the screen that is hard to define but immediately noticeable. We surely have not seen the last of her.

I saw this movie during a family visit to Belgium last Fall in November '13, where it had just opened. The screening I saw this at, a weekday matin&eacute;e, was reasonably well attended. Given we are now 6 months later, I doubt this movie will ever get a theater release in the US, but if you enjoy French ""talk movies"" and have a chance to see this, I would readily recommend you check out this movie, whatever the viewing option (DVD/Blu-ray, On Demand Video, etc.).",1400198400,4,2453,4.689095127610209
