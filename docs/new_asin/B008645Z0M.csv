5134842,3,B008645Z0M,"I purchased the international version which is over 4 and a half hours long. I probably would have been happier with the shorter 2 and a half hour version. The lead actor in the movie was excellent and the supporting cast did a good job. The cinematography was excellent, sub-titled in English. You'll not be able to sit thru the entire thing because it does drag a bit. All-in-all though a pretty good production, however I was a little turned off by the aerobatics that soldiers went thru when killed, or when falling from a height. The propeller type antics with their arms and legs were a bit over the top and overdone. Seemed a bit too Hollywood in this regard.",1345161600,2,666,4.512396694214876
5134843,2,B008645Z0M,"Warriors of the Rainbow"" is a John Woo-produced movie inspired by the Seediq rebellion of 1930 in Taiwan against Japanese imperialism.  It earned much acclaim in the international film circuit and has drawn comparison to such movies as Mel Gibson's `Braveheart' and Michael Mann's `The Last of the Mohicans.'

The story is told through a warrior named Mona Rudao of the village Mahebu.  As a young warrior who had proven himself in battle against rival tribes over disputed hunting ground, Rudao's only concerns in the world were hunting enough food with the other young braves from his village.  That is, before the Japanese encroachment thanks to the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to the Japanese.  Despite their martial prowess and killing many Japanese soldiers, Rudao et al. were ultimately futile against Japanese arms and forced into an uneasy peace.  Flash forward 30 years into the future.  In strict accordance with the `British Manual of Colonial Rule,' if such a thing ever existed, administrative apparatuses and schools were established throughout the region in order to civilize and educate the `barbarians.'  While Rudao (now the chief of his village) knew that defying the Japanese would mean suicide, he seethed within at his powerlessness to restore their traditions and way of life.  A fight between his eldest son and a local Japanese police official during the drunken revelry of a wedding, however, provided the spark for open mutiny.  Rudao, perhaps somewhat inebriated himself, saw an apparition of his deceased father by the river, who sang the songs of his youth with him and `convinced' him to unite the disparate tribes in open revolt and mercilessly attack the Japanese during a local celebration.  An orgy of violence ensued which resulted in the slaughter of many Japanese, including women and children.

Having embarked upon his fateful act, Rudao scattered his warriors in anticipation of the reprisal that was to come.  Women and young children from the revolting tribes evacuated the villages and committed suicide so as to deny the Japanese targets for retaliation (Well I did say `fateful act' didn't I?).  With just some 300 braves including teenage boys, Rudao's only option was to wage hit-and-run guerilla warfare to bleed the Japanese as much as possible before the inevitable end.  And of course, in typical colonial fashion, the Japanese underestimated the 'savages' and paid for it dearly with their lives.  Eventually, they were humbled and became `wiser,' employing a divide-and-conquer strategy by exploiting the longstanding blood feuds between the tribes against each other.

As much as I tried to, I couldn't find much to like in this movie because I simply did not care for its key players.  Rudao lacked the depth and charisma of Mel Gibson's William Wallace or Daniel Day-Lewis's `Hawkeye,' and I was put off by the macho ethos of the tribes, which demanded their young men to kill each other (often by decapitation) over hunting grounds and various other petty disputes of 'honor' in order to prove themselves as warriors.  At two-and-a-half hours long, the movie dragged due to its sluggish and uneven pace, and there is a limit to the decapitations that even I can take in one sitting before succumbing to tedium (imagine my horror when I learned that there is an even longer, two-part version of this movie lasting 4 hours!).  And without the presence of the `fairer sex' to humanize its key characters, like Braveheart's Sophie Marceau or The Last of the Mohicans's Madeline Stowe, it's exceedingly difficult to sympathize with its main protagonist.",1344384000,5,3621,5.125850340136054
5134844,3,B008645Z0M,"There are two versions of ""Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale"" coming to DVD and Blu-ray; the four and a half hour original version and the cut two and a half hour US version. This is a review of the two and a half hour version, which certainly seems as though it received the wrong end of the stick. It feels like much of the story was dumped for the massive amount of action sequences.

The historical drama is absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray. The never ending supply of lush forests and trees just always adds a splash of color to whatever is transpiring. The nonstop bloodshed never ceases to add a little red to the fray, as well. Nature, sunsets, waterfalls, and wildlife; the Taiwan scenery is just stunning. Unfortunately, it's usually sacrificed for cluttered CGI and awkward camera movements.

The CGI is used for a rock slide, some of the more difficult to film wildlife shots, animals, mist, steam, and even explosions. If there was a middle class for special effects, these would fall under that category. The shadowing of the CGI seems to clash with the lighting of the surrounding forests as well and makes the effects stand out even more than they probably should. Then there are times when the camera probably should have just stayed still instead of roaming the countryside to capture what would have been a great shot.

The Taiwanese epic has been compared to the likes of ""Braveheart"" and ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" but there are some similarities to ""300"" in there as well. The film is edited really awkwardly at times. Some battle sequences are noticeably sped up while other somewhat random scenes seem to be done in slow motion. The argument could be made that the slow-motion was added to give that specific scene more significance, but it just doesn't seem necessary when it's seemingly done just to see Mona Rudao's hair blow in the wind or to watch water splash around in slow motion just because it looks cool as somebody runs through it.

Mona Rudao (Lin Ching-Tai) also assembles 300 men from the 12 Seediq Bale tribes to battle the 3000 Japanese police. You've got unnecessary slow motion, you've got 300 warriors, and you have those warriors going up against impossible odds. The comparisons to ""300"" are kind of a no-brainer.

Calmer moments to appreciate in this version of ""Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale"" are slim to none, but the one or two that stay with you after it's over are pretty incredible. Mona Rudao's conversation with Ichiro Hanaoka aka Dakis Nomin (Yi-Fan Hsu) by the waterfall may be the scene that has the biggest impact in the entire film. It just feels like the most fleshed out sequence in the film and Mona Rudao singing with his deceased father afterward only adds a bit more weight to it. Most of General Kamada's (Sabu Kawahara) scenes are pretty intriguing, as well. Mostly because he's so enraged with how Mona Rudao keeps getting the best of so many men with so little of his own.

Just reading the Wikipedia entry on the story of the uncut film gives you a completely different impression than what the two and a half hour version leaves you with. One minute, Mona Rudao is giving his word that he won't start a war and the next he's leading an uprising. The battle sequences are spectacular, especially the final one. There are so many beheadings, hangings, and deaths of children that you lose count. ""Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale"" doesn't shy away from anything even though the message is pretty hopeless. But all of the film's depth seems to have been stripped away. The film throws you into two battles right at the start and you don't really know or care why they're going on.

If you're interested in seeing ""Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale,"" tackle the four and a half hour version. While it may seem extremely tiresome, at least you'll be getting the entire story. The two and a half hour version only gives you a glimpse of that rainbow bridge the Seediq Bale always talk about meeting their ancestors on, but it's so brief that you don't actually get to see it. Hopefully the original version lets you see that bridge in a better light.

Extras include a Making of, Behind the Scenes, and Make-up and Visual Effects featurettes that total nearly thirty minutes in special features. Also included are the theatrical and international trailers.

""Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale"" is now available on DVD and Blu-ray and available as two different versions: US and international. The Blu-ray of the US version is presented with a 16:9 widescreen presentation with 5.1 HD Surround Sound (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Dolby Digital Stereo), is Multilingual, and available with English and Chinese subtitles. The film is not rated by the MPAA and is 150 minutes in length (international version is 276 minutes).",1344297600,40,4805,4.758703481392557

5134846,5,B008645Z0M,"This is an extraordinary offering. Some understanding of the background is helpful for those not familiar with the complex history of Taiwan: The original inhabitants of this island were not Chinese at all but a race akin to many of the tribes in the Philippines and DNA work suggests that most Polynesians can trace their origins back to movements south out of Taiwan. Some 500 years ago Chinese immigration from Fu Jian and later other provinces increased rapidly and these original clans were pushed into the hills where they can still be found in small numbers today. The story begins in 1895 when the aggressive Japanese Empire was ceded Taiwan by the decaying Qing Dynasty and the Japanese sent in their powerful military and civil forces to develop the resources for an expanding economy.

The coastal Han (Chinese) were pretty quickly brought to heel and indeed the Chinese in Taiwan have enjoyed a good relationship with Japan ever since. Most elderly Taiwanese speak Japanese, having learned it at school and the island has many customs and practices that are Japanese rather than those of the mainland Chinese. This did not prove to be the case with the clans in the mountains where considerable resistence and resentment built up as their natural resources were taken from them by the Japanese. This led to a great uprising in the south in the 30s that was eventually crushed with overwhelming force. This long film is the story of this tragic event.

Conceiving and bringing such a story to the screen was no easy task. Language and racial type are huge issues. The mountain clan languages are not at all related to Chinese and are no longer widely spoken. Many have intermarried and Taiwanese today are an interesting mixture of many racial types. Although the country folk in Taiwan are a hardy lot, finding enough cast to run at great speed through Taiwan's beautiful high mountain lands BAREFOOT must have been a challenging task indeed. The story is fast moving and not easy to follow even with some background. The clans were not united and fought amongst themselves over hunting rights as much as they squabbled with the Han and then the Japanese. In the beginning things go badly for them and many learn Japanese and take up roles as local policemen etc but their status rankles and the Japanese were never up to bringing non-Japanese into the fold - even today! The subtitles in English are good but you need to read pretty fast. Chinese visually scan their text and assume we do the same so English subtitles on a Chinese film don't hang about on the screen. This a film to see at least twice.

The sound is outstanding and the camera work remarkable when one considers the astonishing speed of the action. Bodies are all over the place but none of it very explicit. No sex and no real roles for women although the kids do rather well. This is a great set and strongly recommended. The extras are very interesting but in Mandarin and not subtitled.",1342396800,97,2971,4.753875968992248

5134860,5,B008645Z0M,"Japan took possession of Taiwan from China when it was ceded to them after Chinas Qing Dynasty lost the first Sino Japanese war of 1884  1885 and we first pick the story up there. The Japanese were a more controlling Colonial force and did not tolerate aboriginals such as the Seediq and called them Seiban or barbarians and treated them as inferiors. They ruled harshly and built up resentments that led to a number of insurrections that led to The Wushe Incident of 1930 that is the central point of this film.

The indigenous tribes had also fought one another over hunting grounds and other causes for centuries and the divisions that this caused are exemplified here and indeed how the Japanese exploited such to turn tribes against each other. The chief of the Seediq was Mouna Rudau and he ha tried appeasement but one slight too many pushed him to seek to join the tribes together and make a stand against the vastly better equipped Japanese. Once the die was cast they had all foreseen where it would end.

Now this film sticks to the documented facts extremely well, the acting is all excellent and there is a ton of action. It was made in 2011 but some of the CGI is a bit obvious. Despite that this will bring you along for a great roller coaster ride of action. The fight scenes are all done extremely well and when people get hurt they really are hurt. This is a great tribute to the culture of the Seediq and their allies and to a part of history that we have not heard much about. It is also the sort of film you could easily watch again. In aboriginal, Japanese and Hokkien with pretty good subtitles and a run time of just over two and a half hours  every second of which is put to good use  completely recommended.",1454803200,,1733,4.420062695924765
5134861,5,B008645Z0M,"This fascinating, sometimes brutal, rendition of events that occurred on Taiwan during the period of Japanese occupation is eerily relevant to current activities in the Middle East and elsewhere. The struggle by the people of the Seediq tribe to preserve their traditional values, customs, and belief systems in the face of arrogant, ill-considered, and frequently violent, efforts by the Japanese militarists to forcefully impose their own interpretation of modernism upon a resistive populace has many contemporary parallels. Just as the viewer of this film may find themselves sympathetic to the Seediq struggle, despite the necessitous violence involved, so we may consider the with efforts of the followers of Sunni Islam to defy the ""civilizing"" urges of external powers. Just as the Seediq are willing to sacrifice themselves, and their own, in an ultimately futile ""last stand"" against a well armed, technologically superior military force, we might reflect that we in the West may well be seen by the indigenous populace of the nations over which we hold sway, in a light similar to the relationship of the Japanese and the Seediq.
""Warriors of the Rainbow"", despite being  ""a true story based on actual events"" can be seen as an allegory for the struggles by many diverse peoples and cultures to maintain their own unique identities against efforts enforce the values of self-proclaimed progressive cultures upon them.
It is a remarkable, heroic, piece of film making and should be watched by all who seek to have some understanding of the confrontational conflicts between traditionalism and self defined modernism, both historically (the Indians of the Americas, Australian Aborigines, etc.) and contemporaneously (Tibetan Buddhism, Middle Eastern Islam, etc.

By way of background, two percent of the people living in Taiwan are aborigines (yuanzhumin).  Divided into 14 tribes, they are not Han Chinese but one of the Austronesian peoples that inhabited the island before the major Chinese immigration that began in the Ming dynasty.  The film portrays a rising by some of the tribes against Japanese colonial rule in 1930.

Here are some impressions:  (1)  The scenes of Taiwan mountains, valleys, clouds, rivers, and defiles in different weathers are stunning.  (2)  Theres a lush richness to the forest scenes which reminded me of Avatar and Apocalypto.  (3)  Theres an enchanting scene when the protagonist and the spirit of his dead father sing together by a waterfall.  (4)  Gosh, the director included a lot of bloody beheadings by the tribal warriors  more than needed to make the point.

Beyond the plot, the action, and the scenery, the film provides a fresh example of a native people who came in contact with expanding imperial powers.  That large film genre includes films like Black Robe (the French and the Algonquins and Hurons), The Mission (the Spanish and Portuguese in the reductions of Paraguay), The Bounty (the British and Tahiti) to Zulu Dawn (the British and the Bantu) and many others.  These films of cultural contact often contrast authenticity (and sometimes harmony with nature) vs. European rapaciousness.  Theres a related science fiction genre when the conflicts take place in the future (e.g. Avatar and many Star Trek episodes).

Warriors of the Rainbow is not a simple tale.  There are moments in the film when the viewer is drawn into the lifestyle and culture of the Seediq Bale people, and its easy to understand how Japanese arrogance and an intimidating array of adverse social changes eroded the tribes culture and drove the members to resistance.  At other moments, the film challenges the worldview of the tribe.  In one scene, the mother of a warrior challenges the traditional focus on taking the heads of enemies.  In another, agonizing scene a member of the tribe who received a Japanese education and worked in the colonial service must choose between a tribal or Japanese identity.  On the whole, my sense is that the film identified more with the Seediq Bale, but the portrayal was not one-sided.  Indeed, the film seems open to many interpretations.

Is there a balance, or is it a zero-sum game?
