It's predictable in spots, but John Candy's performance is hilarious and some of the other characterizations also really make the film.  The laughs aren't a mile a minute, but they are frequent.  You can enjoy this film more than once.  The humor might not be some peoples' cup of tea.  If you don't like slapstick or sexual innuendo, you might want to pass on this one ...",977875200,4,492,4.304347826086956

This movie shows glimpses into the way governments are run and the people that make it happen. How the Peace Corps makes a difference in the lives of the natives and the people in the Corps. Bridging the gap among factions (why build a bridge and its eventual use). Some are manipulators and some are sincere. The best are gung-ho (John Candy).

381146,4,6301932838,"I like this one where my ex wife hated it. This movie stars a young Tom Hanks and John Candy.

Toms character starts out as a spoiled college student. Though poor decisions he finds himself on a plane going to a fictional place in Asia with the John as part of a peace corps operation.

Other stars are the Asian guy from 16 candles as well as Tom Hanks wife. Her character name is Beth Wexler.

Their mission is to build a bridge w the locals. I don't tell complete synopsis of movies as I feel the viewer needs to be surprised. There are many moments of comedy of course considering the cast. I would call it a romcom though.

Believe this is the only movie Tom Hanks appeared on w his wife. Can't ever forget that Candys character is Tom Tuttle from Tacoma Washington. He is the engineer and a big patriot an over the top performance by him as a lover of the USA.

Reasonably priced check it out. I recommend it!!",1483660800,2,916,4.241379310344827

381299,3,6301932838,"Tom Hanks and John Candy lead us on this shallow, silly tour of an unusually volatile Peace Corp mission to Thailand. Both play wacky charicatures - Hanks as a snooty Connecticut socialite in the wrong place, Candy a naive simpleton with two left feet - and that extra dash of color ultimately saves the picture from sliding into the deepest dregs. Though the plot revolves around the construction of a massive wooden bridge to benefit the natives, we spend most of the picture watching Hanks's Kennedy wannabe struggle to emerge from his loathsome, self-absorbed shell, largely inspired by the unrequited affections of fellow missionary Rita Wilson. The pair would actually spark a lifelong romance during filming (they're still together today, bucking the Hollywood norm) but the on-set chemistry doesn't translate to anything special on the screen. Lightly humorous in the spirit of an only-okay SNL sketch, it's inoffensive and flashy but not all that memorable.",1403481600,,966,5.2387096774193544

He is paired with Rita Wilson and John Candy on his journey.  John Candy is fantastic as always, playing overly outgoing goofball.  A role he plays perfectly.  Also, Gedde Wantanabe is hilarious.

381414,3,6301932838,"""Volunteers"" was a comedy that has some laughs but should have had more considering the talent involved. Tom Hanks, John Candy, Rita Wilson, and Tim Thomerson star and do their best with the material. Hanks plays a rich Yale graduate who is in trouble with gambling debts. When his father refuses to pay, he escapes by getting on a Peace Corp plane. Wilson and Candy play people who actually volunteered for the Peace Corp and Thomerson is the government representative in Thailand. The movie's biggest problem is too many plotlines and not enough time to work them all out properly. But John Candy is funny as he always is as ""Tom Tuttle from Tacoma"" and Thomerson turns out to be CIA and nuts (his knife is named Mike and he holds conversations with it). The volunteers build a bridge that it turns out is wanted by the US government, the communists and a local drug lord. John Candy gets brainwashed by the commies, Rita and Tom fall in love and eventually the bridge gets blown up.

The first time I saw it, in fact, was while in Peace Corps at a training session with fellow volunteers.  We couldn't stop laughing the entire time!  It's just ridiculously overdone - and wonderful because of it :)

Sure, it's campy and the jokes are predictable, but it was never meant to be a high-brow film.  The jokes are often over the top and half the plot is totally unrealistic, but it's funny nonetheless - perhaps moreso if only because of these things.

I highly recommend this movie - John Candy and Tom Hanks always shine as a comedic pair and this movie is no exception.  Hanks' cluelessly priveleged character coupled with Candy's overzealous patriotic naivety is a perfect comedic match-up.",1135123200,8,782,4.834586466165414
381416,4,6301932838,"Comedians Tom Hanks and John Candy deliver a hilarious performance as two entirely different people that come to the same spot seeking two entirely different outcomes.

Nicholas Meyer directs this 1989 Video Tr/Anchor Bay release that follows Lawrence Bourne, played by Hanks, who is a lush. He gambles, drinks constantly, and is a womanizer. Tom Tuttle from Tacoma, Washington, played by Candy, is a Peace Corp volunteer who goes to Thailand to build a bridge so that the indigenous people that live their can finally cross to the other side of the river.

The movie opens with Bourne, who is a master manipulator, is escaping from his debt that he owes a bookie. He hops onto a plane carrying a load of Peace Corp Volunteers.

When they reach Thailand, he is desperate to get back to the United States until he meets Beth Wexler, played by Rita Wilson,

and is instantly smitten with her. The trio depart for the small village where they Tom will try to engineer a bridge suitable for the area.

As Lawrence's feelings grow for Beth so does his ability to adapt to any situation that he wants to be in.

His charm gets him a visit with the local mafia but his charm  also has him actually helping to build the bridge.

Meanwhile, Tom Tuttle from Tacoma, Washington is busy with the Red Scourge. He is brainwashed and sent back to destroy the one thing that he was qualified to do.

  The basic plot is Hanks is a rich prick in serious debt and joins the peace corps to get away from it all. While in Thailand, Tom Hanks has to learn to become a better person. Simple premise, but, like I said earlier, you'll love it.

381421,3,6301932838,"Like I wrote in my review of 'Splash' it is a shame that Candy and Hanks can not team up to do any more films.  Hanks, even early in his career is good, but it is obvious that at this point he still can't pick up the best scripts available, Candy was funny in just about everything he did and his role in this movie is very funny.
This is one of those old movies that isn't by any means great, hardly a 5 star movie, but if you enjoy Hanks, it is worth seeing everything he did and as for Candy, his part in his movie is short, but you will laugh at what he does.  A mild recommendation.",1005436800,3,587,3.8833333333333333
381422,4,6301932838,Glad to see only one bad review for this movie. I loved it. It really just depends what you like in a movie. I loved 1941 but hated American Pie. If your an Adam Sandler fan then I bet you hate it too. If your a Hanks or Candy fan then you must see it. Alan5973 has most of the high points covered. Great lines. The Tom Tuttle from Tacoma brainwash is classic. I also think it is cool seeing Hanks and Wilson together.,996710400,10,418,3.988095238095238
381423,4,6301932838,"Back in 1984, Tom Hanks was on a roll.  After making it big on the small screen in the popular comedy, Bosom Buddies, and making an even bigger ""Splash"" in the 1983 film directed by Ron Howard, Hanks started gaining prominance as an actor.  His next film, 1984s Bachelor Party, brought his persona to a much different audience which did not stop the film from becoming a success.  1985s Volunteers, however, would be a different story.  Although this film is about Ivy Leager, Lawrence Bourne III (Hanks) who joins the Peace Corp to get out of a gambling dept, it is not for a huge audience.  However, there are a couple of important reasons to own it.
1.  This was the 2nd and final teaming of Hanks with fellow ""Splash"" costar, John Candy, who's performance in this film as the goodnatured Tom Tuttle can be hard not to laugh at (the brainwashing scene is a killer).
2.  Volunteers is the movie where Hanks met his wife, Rita Wilson, who costars with him as Beth Wexler.  It's just a lot of fun to watch the chemestry between these two and also quite touching since they are still together today.  One of my favorite scenes is when Beth is unsuccessfully trying to get the natives to move a log, so Lawrence tells her to repeat something he says in their language, and after she does, the natives scurry the log away.  ""What did I just say?"", she asks him.  He replies, ""Move this log and I'll sleep with each one of you"".  A silly but intimate exchange between the two of them.
This DVD is not bad as far as price is concerned and it's even shown in the Widescreen Format (1.85:1), but you may not know that since the back of the case is a bit unclear (the only indication is ""Aspect 16:9"", which some people may not understand).  Even the original theatrical trailer is here in Widescreen.  Plus you even get some nice Cast & Crew Bios.
So if you really enjoy Tom Hanks and/or John Candy, check this film out.
