2926026,5,B000UX6TOI,This gave me a new and appreciative view of Johnny Cash.  It was well written and I will watch it more than once.,1230422400,,113,3.9130434782608696
2926027,5,B000UX6TOI,"I bought this DVD after watching the program on PBS.  I've grown up with Johnny Cash, I'm 78, and this DVD is a good summary of all the things I think you would like to know about him.  The story and the music are both good.",1229817600,,224,3.847826086956522
2926028,5,B000UX6TOI,"Although Johnny Cash was never my favorite singer, I have always liked the spirit and sincerity of his music, especially since I was able to meet him briefly in 1990, when he was still healthy and in very good voice. This video brings to life Johnny's spiritual side, from his earliest years, through his many struggles that persisted throughout his career, and to his last days that brought a resurgence of his popularity. His knowledge of the Bible and his certainty of God's constant love and forgiveness continually brought him back to his roots. This video contains documentary footage that is touching, inspiring, and encouraging. In fact, when my wife and I first viewed it, we determined to buy extra copies as gifts for family members. I highly recommend it as one to enjoy viewing many times over.",1229731200,5,807,4.855072463768116
2926029,4,B000UX6TOI,"This is a very good documentary of Johnny Cash's life, including his struggles between good and evil, stuggles with his personal life, struggles with his family life, his career, health problems, and etc. This shows how his strong faith in GOD got him throught these struggles.
The documentary is narrated by Dan Rather. This Dvd also highlights the Gospel Music of Johnny Cash.

It starts by describing his humble beginnings as a child being raised on a farm in the rural Arkansas delta. It progresses into his service to the country in the military. While he was stationed in Germany, he bought a guitar and learned to play and sing. He had met his first wife by this time and when he was honorably discharged, the two married and moved to Memphis. He auditioned for Sam Phillips at Sun Records by playing gospel songs, but Sam said he would not record any gospel songs. So, Johnny began recording early rollabilly songs and became a star. The early touring took a toll on Johnny and he resorted to drugs to cope. This took a toll on his first marriage and it ended.

Johnny hit bottom and was disfunctional for about a year, then he got involved with June Carter and mother Maybelle Carter. June was a true helpmate and helped him get his life back together. They married and his career became sucessful again. Sam Phillips lets him record some gospel songs and he performs ""I Was there when it happened"".

The Dvd shows some footage of Johnny, June and his band performing some gospel songs at San Quinton.  Some of these include: ""He turned the water into Wine"", ""Daddy sang bass"", and ""Man in Black"" (he wrote this song for all the down-trodden people in the world).

The dvd documents John and Junes trips to the ""Holy Land"", and their filming of a movie about the life of Christ,in the ""Holy Land"". Some more great gospel song performances from Johnny include: ""Over the Next Hill We'll be Home"", ""Peace in the Valley"", ""Why me Lord"", ""The Old Rugged Cross"", and ""I'm Just an old Chunk of Coal"". These are performed at a Billy Graham Crusade. Johnny gives great testimony of his faith and devotion to Jesus Christ.

Tragedy strikes Johnnny again,as he is attacked by a large male Ostrich, at his farm in Tennesee. Some of his ribs are broken, and his stomach is torn open. He recovers but gets addicted to pain pills. He goes into the Betty Ford clinic and recovers. He rejoins Billy Graham at a Crusade, and gives great testimony again. He also performs some more great gospel songs including ""One of these days I'm gonna sit down and talk to Paul""(this is and outstanding song written and performed by Johnny,).

Johnny and June go back to the ""Holy Land"", and he performs ""I won't have to cross Jordan alone"". They reappear back on a Billy Graham Crusade where they perform ""What on earth will you do for Heaven's sake"", and ""the old account was settled long ago"". Again, Johnny gives great testimony of his Christian Faith.

The documentary draws to a close and discusses Johnny's last few years alive, the death of his wife of 35 years June Carter Cash, and Johnny's worsening health problems. He is interviewed by Larry King and is asked if he is bitter, because of his bad health, and Johnny replys ""No, I don't have any reason to be bitter"", ""I've had a great life"". It ends by covering Johnny's last recordings and his death. This dvd is a great ""Story of Faith and Redemption"".",1222128000,22,3395,4.6
2926030,5,B000UX6TOI,"I am very impressed with the product. I thought I knew about Johnny Cash,but this is great because it goes into depth a little and helps you get to know the good,and bad of Johnny's life. And the music--it's pure Johnny--what else can you say? I'd highly recommend this to anyone.",1220140800,,280,4.509803921568627

  It is a wonderful look back at Johnny's career.  Surprising preformances from young country stars that would later pan out to be country legends themselves.  You get a complete biography of Johnny Cash told by the people who were there.

  The relationship between Johnny & June is just darling.  Love can truly last forever and beyond.  The music is wonderful you will not be disappointed.  From the heights of his strength to the last days of his life it is touching to follow his path down all those winding sometimes crooked roads.",1207526400,2,709,5.99

2926034,5,B000UX6TOI,"Johnny Cash's soul is truly beautiful, and it shines throughout this DVD of Gospel songs and the documentary by Dan Rather. I own MANY Cash DVD's and I love many of them; however, this DVD has touched me beyond words.",1192838400,28,217,4.45
2926035,5,B000UX6TOI,"This documentary hosted by Dan Rather looks into John's reason for singing in the first place and how he was able to use his music to spread God's word.  There are interviews to be sure, Marshal Grant, John Carter Cash, and more, but most importantly they let John's music play a big part of this DVD.  Far too many of these retrospective, documenteries, interrupt the musical performances with interviews, not this one.  The performances stand on their own, with few exceptions.  The perfomances start with an old black and white performance that can be found on other DVD's, but that's it, later perfomances have him and with June performing several songs from the Billy Graham crusades.  Jewels, everyone of them.  It also has photos of John at June's funeral and ends with a still photo from John's own funeral.  This is THE BEST documentary I've seen on John (it doesn't cover all aspects of his life, just concentrates on his gospel music and his relationship with God).  Don't let the use of the term ""documentary"" scare you from this DVD, the concert performances are great and the songs (for the most part) are uninterrupted.  You may never see these performances anywhere else, this is worth owning.",1191456000,66,1209,4.830097087378641
