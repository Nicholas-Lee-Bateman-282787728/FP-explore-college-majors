8569494,5,B00BJC8WNU,"In order to get Stanley and Iris cheaper than the listed $65.00 and up. I bought it packaged with Full Moon in Blue Water for $9.99. Stanley and Iris is a very well put together movie about every day people dealing with their own personal struggles. Well worth the time and investment. A great movie for the family to enjoy. Full Moon in Blue Water was good, but not for family viewing. Amazon delivery service was excellent as usual.",1514851200,,434,4.506329113924051
