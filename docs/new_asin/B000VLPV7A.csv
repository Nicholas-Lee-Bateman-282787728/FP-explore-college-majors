8219419,2,B000VLPV7A,"I got this DVD from the library to help my 2 year old daughter start preparing for potty training. I am very glad that I didn't spend any actual money on it.

The production quality is about as low as it gets. The drawings are crude and the lips don't even move in sync with the speaking at times. They repeat the same clips throughout the movie, plus it is also blurry and out of focus at times. And, honestly, the main character is supposed to be a toddler but she has the voice of a 30 year old (at least) woman! Was it really that hard to hire a child to do a child's voice? Or at least an adult that actually sounds like a child? Again, poor production values. The reading is stiff and wooden, too. It sounds fake and forced, like she's reading straight out of the script with no real emotion.

However, all this being said, the movie still has value in that: 1) It's less than half an hour so it's good at keeping the attention span of a toddler, 2) It actually SHOWS the character using the potty. And yes, it even goes a step further by showing you exactly what the pee and poop look like! This is something that I haven't seen in other potty training books or videos, and although it's gross it's still reality and it's refreshing that they're not afraid to show the kids the products of their elimination. 3) They have a special segment where they show real toddlers sitting on potties and singing along to the ridiculous but surprisingly catch potty theme song. This is good for capturing a child's attention as well, since they can relate to and enjoy watching other kids playing and singing.

Overall, despite the poor production values with the crude animation, at times blurry quality, and annoying voice, I would STILL recommend this over Elmo's Potty Time (the other potty training DVD we've seen) because instead of just a lot of singing and dancing about the potty and about growing up, it actually SHOWS kids how to sit on a potty and how to use it, and that's gotta be worth something! Plus, my daughter actually sat down to watch this and even asked to see it AGAIN, whereas with Elmo's DVD she got bored after the first 20 minutes and wanted something else.",1211068800,4,2180,4.417910447761194
