7512547,1,B017RH4WZW,This movie is barely any better then the third Open Season.  This is a five year old's horror movie and not anything good in it for an adult to enjoy watching it with kids.  That Is why I give this flick a 2.5/ 5 stars.,1457654400,5,219,3.8444444444444446

7512552,1,B017RH4WZW,"Quite possibly the worst kids movie I've ever watched. And with a 4 and 8 year old, I've seen a lot. The plot is almost indecipherable. Neither my kids not I have laughed yet (and we're about 80% of the way through). The 4 year old list interest a while ago. The 8 year old is still watching, but isn't overly thrilled.

This was a great choice and I would recommend this for anyone. There is plenty of humor. I saw my little brother crying from laughter, which happened for the first time.

7512593,5,B017RH4WZW,"I very much enjoyed this new edition to the Open Season movies. I loved the other three as well.

I liked that this particular movie had to deal with a scary legend of the werewolf. It was so much fun. We had to deal with Shawn getting Open Season ""open"" again so he would hunt the alleged werewolf. The movie is filled with hijinks as usual and some real gross parts dealing with poo!!!!

There were a few things I didn't care for but that happens in a movie. I think if you loved the other movies you will love this one too :-)

The only other thing is they didn't have Elliots kids in it. I might have missed something but that was a little strange. Either way, I enjoyed it!",1467417600,3,678,4.121212121212121

7512595,2,B017RH4WZW,After about 10 minutes even my children were talking about how annoying the constant barrage  of gab from the characters became. It had some funny one liners but overall the machine gun speed of jokes became less and less funny.,1466899200,3,228,4.7
