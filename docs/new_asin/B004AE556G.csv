8420123,4,B004AE556G,"After this workout, you know all parts of your body have been used.  It's not difficult, but if you want to you can work hard.  I also find he is not annoying like many of the instructors in other videos-but this is clearly just personal preference.  It's fun, so I actually look forward to this little workout.",1433030400,,311,4.421052631578948
8420124,5,B004AE556G,Every Tuesday part of our Discover Tai Chi Club gets together at 8:00 a.m. to dance with Scott Cole.  It's so much fun!!!  We love it and get a lot out of exercising in this fashion.  All of us are senior citizens and think Scott is great!,1428883200,2,239,4.042553191489362
8420125,5,B004AE556G,"This is such a low-key, but fun & worthwhile workout! I love Scott's relaxed personality, but the choreography is enjoyable and easy to follow. It's not advanced, but you will break a sweat and get a good workout. I also like how it's chaptered so you can do shorter sections if you need. He also has a nice mix of martial arts, simple dance and some tai chi. It's a keeper!",1428883200,3,374,4.28169014084507
8420126,2,B004AE556G,"I like disco workouts, but this was boring. There were no lyrics in the songs and lots of nonstop talking/instruction. Moves were very simple, not much of a workout Richard Simmons and Cheryl Burke both have numerous disco DVDs that are much more fun.",1425600000,4,251,4.7272727272727275
8420127,4,B004AE556G,"Strange to see Scott in a dancy workout instead of Tai Chi, but he has very good rhythm and this workout is a lot of fun.  It's more ""disco"" than ""dojo"", although there are a few punches and kicks in there.  There is a lot of variety and the choreography is easy without any complex combos.  It is a good, mainly low impact, workout for beginners or the active adult, like myself.  I wish the music would have been more like the original disco songs instead of the typical instrumental stuff used in workouts, but all in all it is an enjoyable workout.",1407024000,3,552,4.330097087378641
8420128,5,B004AE556G,"Perfect workout for a ""baby boomer"" who isn't anywhere near ready for the ole' rocking chair! Joint friendly, lively, fun moves -- and a sense of humor too. I enjoyed it very much and will use it often.",1396396800,3,202,4.342105263157895
8420129,5,B004AE556G,"We live in a retirement community and enjoy Scott Cole's Tai Chi video's.  We purchased Dojo for Tai Chi class but found out it was way to aerobic. We use it instead in out Zumba class. It gives us a great change up as we were getting tired of the Zumba video's.  An excellent quality video, hope you like it as much as we do.",1374364800,6,326,4.0
8420130,5,B004AE556G,Scott Cole brings in good energy and makes exercising fun and beneficial. I tried it and have decided to keep it and work out with it often.,1359158400,5,140,4.222222222222222
8420131,5,B004AE556G,"Scott Cole is a great instructor, I have many of his DVDs and enjoy all of them, but this one is my favor.  So relaxing and will make you feel so happy doing it.  It's a medium/light aerobic and combine with some Tai-Chi movements, I enjoy very much!",1333929600,7,250,4.1875
