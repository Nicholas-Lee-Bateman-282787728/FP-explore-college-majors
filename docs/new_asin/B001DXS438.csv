8295363,4,B001DXS438,"The story of Caligula, as told in this BIOGRAPHY episode, is made vivid by the inclusion of ancient statuary and wall art, also dozens of classic paintings. We are spared details of the worst of this bizarre ruler's excesses, but learn enough to see why his own bodyguards turned aganst Caligula and stabbed him thirty times leaving the dead emperor in the dust of a passageway from the arena he'd been attending.

Hypothetical reasons for his insane behavior are offered, but of course it's impossible to know anything of this doomed ruler beyond the little that has come down to us from the historian Suetonius. A man who was born decades after Caligula's assassination, Suetonius may only be passing onto us  whatever ""urban myths"" were still popular about the crossdressing royal who thought himself a deity.

Interesting speculation nonetheless, all in a tightly presented 43 minute video  capsule.",1466985600,,903,5.081081081081081
