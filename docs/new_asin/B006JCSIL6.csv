4992954,5,B006JCSIL6,"This is probably the best ultra-low-budget indie film I have seen.  It's heart-warming, funny, and entertaining.  There are no low moments in the film.  If you ever kicked yourself for not asking out your school crush, you will appreciate this film.  If you like to laugh, you'll appreciate this film.  Definitely worth a $2 rental!",1329955200,2,332,4.963636363636364

8499328,4,B006JCSIL6,"kinda comedy time travel movie. interesting, but choppy if you try too hard to use time travel logic since each time they come back would've been different which would've altered what they tried the next couple of times.",1443916800,,220,4.815789473684211

8499330,5,B006JCSIL6,"When the wife of Jukos lifelong friend Jed gets fed up with Juko living in their garage, Jed comes up with his best plan yet: to build a time machine so Juko can go back in time and win the heart of the girl whom he's waited twenty years for, even if Juko isn cool like her finance is.",1420070400,,285,3.847457627118644
8499331,3,B006JCSIL6,"As another reviewer said, it is reminiscent of Groundhog Day, with certain things repeating over and over until the main character gets it just right, so we can have our happy ending.
The characters are likeable (and I do like Zibby Allen) and there are some genuinely funny moments, but I don't think I'd watch it more than once every 10-20 years or so.
This is a dvd-r though, so it's not a factory original.",1386892800,,410,4.48
8499332,4,B006JCSIL6,"This fit the bill- it was as good or better (in some ways).  We found it on Jinni(dot)com, and Amazon Instant was the only place we could find it available.",1375228800,,156,4.2
8499333,2,B006JCSIL6,"I love time travel themes, but this one was disappointing and silly, like a student film project. Two friends work together to send one back in time to win his childhood crush before she marries someone else. The young man in love is very Aspie like and keeps ruining the trip with his shyness. Multiples of the two friends cause interference. This repetious part was slapstickish and felt like Groundhog Day. The movie idea had potential but fell short in its development of characters and plot. If you decide to watch it, make sure you watch the bit while the credits run- that was the funniest part of the movie.",1371772800,2,615,4.6
8499334,5,B006JCSIL6,"Original, refreshing, hilarious - kudos to the cast and crew. highly recommend it! five stars all the way. They should charge more than $1.99 for this.",1354665600,,151,4.846153846153846
8499335,1,B006JCSIL6,"My opinion is very poor. Sadly, this is not my super movie. I do not rec. A big nr. What is my reason. Plot is weeeeeek, but wait there is more. People who want a comedy will not find one. Also, it is not an action movie. However, this movie is a great vehicle to destroy your cinema career.",1345766400,,291,3.9491525423728815
