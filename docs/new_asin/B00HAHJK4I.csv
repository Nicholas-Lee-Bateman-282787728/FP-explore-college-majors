It's great that these cartoons are finally being remastered, but no restoration whatsoever and no bonus features......But this time there was no slipcase (unlike the last two sets). The slipcase for the last two volumes was nice and added a little more value to the purchase, and when put together they would have given us Betty's face (see the product image picture that I uploaded). These sets where already overpriced and now they got cheaper on the production. (Sarcasm) Thanks a lot Olive Films!",1399334400,11,600,4.669811320754717
6152815,4,B00HAHJK4I,"Content is wonderful, as mentioned in other reviews. As with the first two volumes, I have never seen these cartoons in such beautiful quality.
My one problem is that this one did not come with the outer cardboard sleeve the first two had. This wouldn't be an issue, but the first two put side by side make part of Betty's face on the spines. Now I have half only half of her face on my shelf next to this DVD! The item was new and sealed from a very reputable seller, so I must assume that this volume just comes without it.
If anyone can correct me, I will change this review.

UPDATE

Yeah, apparently they aren't doing the cardboard sleeves with her face on it anymore. This is going to really bug me, but I still plan on buying volume four. This content is just too good to pass up, in any packaging.",1399334400,4,805,4.220779220779221
6152816,5,B00HAHJK4I,"I just received this on the day of release.  The quality of the video and audio is on par with the other titles in the collection. The audio is better than any release I've seen.

As mentioned, there are some minor works, on the disk, but it's well worth obtaining for ""Minnie the Moocher"", ""I'll Be Glad When You're Dead"" and ""The Old Man of the Mountain"".  ""Minnie the Moocher is the Fleischers at their surrealistic best.  It's not very coherent, but it's great to hear the song and see the truly weird images they dreamed up.  I told my wife I'm glad I've never had the D.T.'s, which must have been the origin of some of the stranger things going on here.",1398729600,3,659,4.32520325203252
6152817,5,B00HAHJK4I,"With this release there are still 6 pre-code classic Betty Boop series cartoons and 16 Talkartoons that feature Betty Boop not available on Blu-ray or DVD, so it is quite disappointing to see 6 post Hayes Office Production Code (July 1934) cartoons included here. Even worse, the last cartoon is a ""Pudgy"" cartoon. With only one more Blu-ray volume release planned, it may be too much to hope for to see all of those missing 18 classics.  After the great Volume 2 selection, I was hopeful about this.  My guess: We will not get to see those Talkartoons.  Paramount doesn't know they have Betty Boop and they will not consult any of us experts.  For the record, there are also 11 post-Hayes Office cartoons not yet released.

On the PLUS side, we do finally get to hear Louis Armstrong (I'll Be Glad When You're Dead, You Rascal You), CAB CALLOWAY (Minnie The Moocher & Old Man of the Mountain) and Don Redman (I Heard).
And some of the post Hayes Office cartoons presented here are creative and enjoyable.

The transfers themselves are crisp & sharp, from 35mm fine grains.  But no DNR or digital restoration was done, this is a plus and a minus.  No animation lines will be lost, but you will see the minor defects in the nitrate masters.  I am fine with that, I would rather not lose any animation lines and see the film as it is.  But gee, I wish the original Paramount logos existed.  Strangely many of the live action sequences seem to have Nitrate deterioration but it cleans up when the cartoon sequences start.

The Cartoons:
The PRE-CODE fun cartoons:
MINNIE THE MOOCHER w/ Bimbo (1932),  a wonderful halloween cartoon with CAB CALLOWAY (Talkartoon)
I'LL BE GLAD WHEN YOU'RE DEAD YOU RASCAL YOU w/ Bimbo & Koko (1932),  somewhat racist cartoon with Louis Armstrong and his band depicted as African head-hunters.  But the music is great.
MOTHER GOOSE LAND (1933), Betty's wonderful take on the nursery tales.
THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN (1933), Cab Calloway returns as the Old Man of the Mountain ads scats his way through the entire cartoon!
I HEARD w/ Bimbo & Koko (1933), Don Redman is not as well known as the others in this disc, but he performs ""I knew a gal named Betty Boop"" in this fun cartoon about miners. At one point Betty's dress ends up on Bimbo, leaving her in her underwear, definitely pre-code!
HA! HA! HA! w/ Koko (1934), Max Fleischer's live action hand draws Betty to life and Koko sneaks out of the inkwell, just like in the old silent days. But Koko gets a toothache and Betty draws a dentist office. VERY CLASSIC!

Now the Hayes Office steps in....
STOP THAT NOISE (1935),  Betty tries to take a nap in a noisy world.
SERVICE WITH A SMILE w/ Grampy (1937),  Gadget loving Grampy helps bring these post Hayes Office cartoons to life as the run they ""Hi-De-Ho-Hotel"". Sorry, no Cab Calloway here.
THE NEW DEAL SHOW (1937),  Betty puts on a Pet Talent Show.
BE UP TO DATE (1938), 3-D back-grounts add punch to this story of Betty Boop trying to bring modern gadgets to some hillbillies.
OUT OF THE INKWELL (1938) A live action Janitor practices magic and encounters a stop-motion magic pen that brings Betty Boop to life. The janitor then practices hypnotism on Betty.  You can tell this is post-Hayes office, Betty is under his control and her clothes stay on (but the garter belt does appear).  The black Janitor does a ""step-n-fetchin"" impression.  One of the more creative later cartoons.
PUDGY IN THRILLS AND CHILLS (1938), A rotoscoped Betty Boop goes ice skating with Pudgy the Pup.  The best thing about this cartoon is that it is very short, running 5:30.  It is more like a study in rotoscoping animation than telling any story.",1390348800,27,3667,4.6234567901234565

6152819,3,B00HAHJK4I,"Something bad has happened to this series from Olive Films. First, it took forever before we got the first set, and Olive Films refused to answer any questions. It left me feeling that I would never have anything to do with this company if it wasn't for their Betty Boop releases. The first set, scant with only 12 cartoons, was not impressive from a standpoint of the look of the films. This seems to have been improved somewhat by the 2nd release (there are supposed to be 4 overall). However, this eagerly anticipated 3rd volume is indeed a step back. I only watched a few of the toons last night and I was soon scratching my head. 'Minnie The Moocher' started out with some cheesy music that had nothing to do with the original film. Fortunately it ended by the time the titles came up.

I bought this on Blu-Ray, as I did the 1st two releases. But there is no reason to. They did absolutely no restoration, or anything within their power to make 'Minnie The Moocher' look better. In fact I think my Republic VHS boxset from almost 20 years ago is higher quality. I watched the later made 'The New Deal Show' and it was overly grainy and lifeless. It was bad enough they discontinued the slip cover from the 3rd edition that would have tied all the releases together, but it seems like they are desperate to save money. They must have gotten paltry sales results from the first two releases and cut back on any improvement in picture quality. They probably didn't want to release this one, and who knows if they'll put out the final, Volume 4.

Everybody who is a classic animation fan wanted this. They wanted Betty released in a quality, complete format, at least as good as the Republic VHS set. This has been a huge letdown as far as being complete (which we knew it wouldn't be), but we at least expected the master films these sets purport to be struck from, to be improved so they would look good in the digital format. We know it can be done because Warner Brothers did a beautiful job on their Fleischer Popeye sets just a few years ago. I guess Olive Films got in over their head.

I'm going to watch the rest of his this set and if there is any improvement in quality I'll amend this review.",1408233600,,2206,4.401960784313726

6152823,1,B00HAHJK4I,"I had to return this bluray because Olive films didn't release in slip cover as they did for 1&2 ,so it doesn't really ""fit""with the other two releases. First let me say that ALL OLIVE FILMS ARE OVERPRICED.They release the ""B"" Paramount movies that Paramount won't release.
The movies NEVER have ANY special features and no title is worth over $20. The quality is good but they are all bare bones releases. Many collectors are upset about this Betty Boop # 3 -Bluray release and are refusing to buy it. If Olives Films doesn't believe ""Betty Boop vol #3""
isn't worth a third slip cover,then I too,have lost interest in Olive films for lack of confidence in ""Betty Boop"".I say wait and DON'T BUY this bluray as many have been returned by customers like me. Olive will have trouble unloading these clunkers and in six months or so,you'll get them cheap from resellers that got the disks at close out prices. Betty Boop deserves better treatment than Olive films will give her. I sent a e-mail on this subject to Olive films several weeks ago BUT GOT NO REPLY.They really need to clean house at Olive films!",1404777600,4,1104,4.6091370558375635
6152824,5,B00HAHJK4I,"On this DVD there are the cartoons: MINNIE THE MOOCHER, I'LL BE GLAD WHEN YOU'RE DEAD YOU RASCAL YOU, MOTHER GOOSE LAND, THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN, I HEARD, HA HA HA, STOP THAT NOISE, SERVICE WITH A SMILE, THE NEW DEAL SHOW, BE UP TO DATE, OUT OF THE INKWELL, PUDGY IN THRILLS AND CHILLS.

Here is some basic Boop history: The dog Bimbo (who appears in some Betty Boop Cartoons) was a semi-star long before Ms. Boop was created. However, over time Bimbo's career slowly died, and Ms. Boop's career (her first appearance was as a dog like character in DIZZY DISHES) took off. Ms. Boop was a star for about a decade, and in the beginning of her career (early 30's) she was known to be a little risqu. However, over time the sensor's office won, by taking more and more of her risqu qualities away from her (This can be seen in cartoon shorts such as SERVICE WITH A SMILE, STOP THAT NOISE, etc.). By the end of Ms. Boop's career she was dressed/ personified more as an innocent house wife/working girl (though she wasn't married). Betty had started her career as a sexy character, and she had replaced Bimbo (the dog) in the beginning, but towards the end of her own career Betty's dog (Pudgy) took over her films. Gradually Betty was seen less and less, as the cartoons began to evolve more around Pudgy.  Often people wonder why Betty appeared in her first few shorts as a dog like woman. The answer is that she was originally not intended to have her own cartoons. She was a side character created for Bimbo (a semi-star at the time). Audiences seemed to love her the first time they saw her in DIZZY DISHES, and afterwards Fleischer made a point to have her appear in some Bimbo shorts. However, she became so popular that she eventually got her own cartoon shorts, and became a women (and not a female dog for Bimbo). Most people wonder why in several Betty cartoons she has a love interest with Bimbo...because Bimbo was not originally designed for Betty, but instead Betty was designed for him. Eventually audiences felt that a love interest between Betty and Bimbo was too strange (once Betty became human/ had her own cartoon shorts), and Bimbo was dropped from later Boop cartoons.

Now, about this DVD. Personally, I have seen certain shorts (like STOP THAT NOISE) on other DVD/ VHS formats, and most of the time the images are grainy, sound quality poor, and scenes cut out/edited. However, from what I am use to seeing of the Betty Boop transfers, this is by far the best quality/ un-edited versions of her cartoon shorts. Yes, there are flaws throughout each episode (fuzzy, lines, ect.), but it's not pronounced enough to take away from the Betty Boop Cartoon stories. These are 80 year old shorts that ( have not been as cleaned up as some Fleischer Popeye cartoons), but have been restored very nicely indeed. At times you'll get great restoration on both film and sound (on this DVD). Other times you might just get better picture then sound, and visa-versa. What I really loved about this DVD is that there were cartoon shorts that I had not seen on any other Betty Boop DVDs. Also, I loved how almost all the shorts revolved around Betty, and not Pudgy!!!!! In the past I have bought, so called, ""Betty Boop"" DVDS, only to find that a good portion of those cartoons revolved around Pudgy (Betty as a side character)...On this DVD it's 99%  Betty Boop. Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As for children watching These cartoons???? I, personally, would allow my children to watch this DVD. Yes there are times where her dress might flip up and you see her bloomers/ bra, but by todays views it looks like a bathing suit/short skirt???? I don't know, you need, as the parent, to watch/ gage whether these cartoons are right for your children OR not. However, because this DVD contains more of the first Boop cartoons, they are a little more risqu compared to her later cartoons. Also, it depends on your child's personality! Some children could careless about old black and white cartoon shorts, especially when My Little Pony is on TV. However, there are other children who would enjoy these Betty Boop cartoons. Personally, I never cared for Ms. Boop as a child. I thought her cartoon shorts were just silly, and some times confusing.  However, as a teenager, and now as an adult, I have grown an appreciation towards these old classic shorts, and now I love Ms. Boop. Please keep in mind about your child's personality when purchasing this product. No, I don't think that moments of Betty's skirt lifting up, is to kinky (especially by todays cartoon standard). Initially, these quick scenes might surprise an adult (due to this ridiculous current cultural notion that animation/ Hollywood was so innocent back in the 1920's/30's). I know that when I first saw Betty (years ago) I wasn't expecting to see her bloomers, and yes, it made my eyes widen for a second, then I was over it...no great shock. Also, there are occasional references to ""possible"" alcohol, and other adult activities (a bird might pick up a mug of frosty beer/what looks like a beer-not actually labeled as beer and drink it.).you decide. I've seen more offensive scenes in modern day kid's films then Betty Boop cartoons, but that does not mean that you'll feel the same way, and I am aware of that. Also, there are adult moments, which parents will get the meaning/reference of, but I doubt that a child would???????? I know that in THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN  cartoon there is a scene where a hippo comes down the mountain, pushing a stroller, and crying. Betty asks what's the matter? The hippo replies ""the old man of the mountain."" Suddenly, three bearded babies appear out of the stroller (the old man's off spring). Personally, this is one scene I never cared for...I never understood it. Was the hippo and the old man having an affair, and he dumped her (why she was crying/had his children)? Or was it that he had ra-ed her...I never liked the crying part. Don't get me wrong, I really like this Boop cartoon, I just didn't like that particular scene. However, this scene goes by so fast, that very few people remember it. You figure it out.
If you are an adult buying this DVD for yourself, and are not familiar with Ms. Boop please keep the followings in mind (1) There are the occasional kinky moments. However, it is NOTHING like what you see on modern shows like Family Guy, Simpsons, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, etc. Don't buy this with the expectation of being shocked/ for shock value (un-less you have a thing for bloomers). (2) Yes, there are certain episodes where there is adult material suggested. For example in CHESS NUTS (this cartoon is on another DVD set) the king takes Betty into his bedroom, and the bed comes out (reference to the bed not wanting an inappropriate sexual act happening on it). However, if a child was watching this same scene chances are that he/she would not get the meaning/references. In my opinion modern day films, like the Shrek Movies suggest sexuality WAY more then the old Betty Boop Cartoons. After all, you won't see in a Betty Cartoon (unlike Shrek 2) a cat licking his privates, and then coming onto a women. I am not bashing Shrek, I am just making a point. (3) The average Betty Cartoon revolves around a basic story plot, lots of singing, and often filled with abstract scenes. Some of the scenes will not make sense to modern day viewers. The Fleischer company was well known for creating images/ scenes that were strange and abstract. The early Fleisher cartoons, by some, are considered to be the inspiration for modern day music videos. One example of an abstract scene (in Betty's cartoons) revolves around a baby who is singing, and his face gradually morphs into a hairy man/ wolf like face. (4) You should watch these shorts with more of an nostalgic flavor in mind (like, ""wow! This is what was cool 80 years ago.""), not necessarily seeing it through todays eyes. However, if you are an artist you may appreciate it more with your current perspective. Give it a chance, watch at least five shorts to help you in developing a flavor (if you don't have it developed already) for Ms. Boop and her classic cartoons. Chances are that after you watch this DVD you will end up singing one of her songs.
These are also very old cartoons with different standards/ views compared to todays standards/views. Some people might find some Betty Boop cartoons (a little) offensive?...even at times sexist? Please keep in mind that Betty Boop was seen as a sort of ""trail blazer"" of her era. She was a working girl (never married-not an acceptable choice for women at that time), she took care of her own life (didn't rely on a man to survive financially). In one short (on another DVD set) she even tried to become the first woman president. On the other hand she could at times be dependent on a male to save her, and or occasionally use her sexuality to get out of predicaments. One cartoon, BETTY ON TRIAL (NOT on this DVD) started out strong (concerning women's rights/lib.). At first she refused to cave into the advances of a handsome cop (she stood up to an authority figure). She ended up in court, and was against a sexist, all male, courtroom (it was even implied that she was not taken seriously because the judge took notes on her legs/figure). However, though it starts off strong (concerning women standing up against a sexist 1930's world), she quickly caves in, and takes off with the cop (at end). By today's standards, this can be viewed as an insult to women. However, in the 1930's it was seen as a type of revolutionary movement (being against a sexiest, male society). However, in the 1930's it was an absolute male run world, the Fleischer Company wanted to be revolutionary, but at the same time they did not want to completely anger the culture norms/way of thinking of the time (that is why Betty ended up with the cop). Just the idea of a woman standing up against a male dominated world (in the 1930's) was a break through in movies/culture...just a reminder this particular cartoon was not on this DVD (I used it to make a point).
Overall, what I am saying is, ""respect Betty and her cartoons for what they are/were"".
p.s. the original Betty cartoons were designed mostly for children, but also for adults, however, when watching these shorts don't expect a Family Guy (more modern) sort of adult cartoon. 95% of Betty's cartoons are silly/ meant for children, but it is the other 5% that can become/ get a little adult (but not a PG13 rating).
Basically my final thought is, ""at least watch Betty to see what all the interest/ cultural hype is about"".
""Well, so long everybody!""",1403222400,,10648,4.6461538461538465

6152826,4,B00HAHJK4I,"Would like to have seen this set contain more of the earlier cartoons, before the Production Code forced the Fleischers to tone things down a bit.  (Especially since several of the post-Code shorts have already turned up on numerous animation compilations over the years, even if not in such pristine shape as those used here.)  There are still some jewels on hand in Volume 3 (MINNIE THE MOOCHER, I'LL BE GLAD WHEN YOU'RE DEAD YOU RASCAL YOU), although the quality of the source material varies from short to short.  And it's surprising to see the U.M. & M. TV logo in place of the original Paramount card on some of these, to create a more complete restoration.  With only one more volume to go, I hope the next one includes Betty's 1933 version of SNOW WHITE, with Cab Calloway belting out ""St. James Infirmary Blues.""  (Olive's four volumes will only total 48 shorts...less than half of the 115 shorts found in Republic's old VHS and laser disc release from 1998.)  It's disappointing that both the Blu-ray and DVD dropped the cardboard case the first two sets had, since the original idea was the the spines of all four boxes would form a portrait of Betty Boop.
