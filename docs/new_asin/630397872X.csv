749208,5,630397872X,"Clint Howard was destined to play creepy characters like in this film. He's plays as this character named Gregory and has a dark past. He spent his whole life in a mental institution. I don't know how he got the job in the first place. His dad was a killed in front of him by a drive by shooting when he was on his ice cream route. So when Gregory goes back to his old neighborhood he becomes the ice cream man just like his father. That's when the killing starts..he's getting revenge of some sorts in the name of his father.

The film is highly entertaining because of the overall tackiness like bad jokes and unbelievable moments. Not really scary..it's in the line of the Leprechaun films, a great watch for laughs.",1383868800,,719,4.406015037593985

749210,3,630397872X,"...that pretty much sums up 1995's ""Ice Cream Man."" Clint Howard stars as the titular character who kills people & animals and adds them to his 31 flavors as he roams the suburbs of Southern California.

If you like 90's horror-comedies, like the ""Leprechaun"" films, you might want to check this one out. It is often entertaining despite the low-budget feel and questionable acting by the kids (but they're alright); and Clint Howard is perfect for the title role. He looks just like Jack Kirby's rendition of the Puppet Master from The Fantastic Four comics (seriously).

The story is basically the ice cream man vs. a group of kids who are about 12-13 years-old. The gore can't be taken seriously, so the movie's hardly horrifying. But it is consistently amusing and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, although at times amateurishly put-together, which is likely due to lack of funds.

The best part of the film is the women, particularly Stephanie Champlin (aka Stephanie Sumers) as the blond, Janet. She has a few quality scenes (fully clothed) and she's just jaw-dropping. The magnificent Sandahl Bergman, who played Valeria in the 1982 version of ""Conan the Barbarian,"" also has a small role as one of the kid's mother. She looks great, but she's dressed in a pant suit the whole time (not that there's anything wrong with that; just don't expect her in a costume like Valeria in ""Conan"", lol). Lastly, there's the voluptuous cutie Andrea Evans. All three of their roles are too brief, but Stephanie as Janet has just enough screen time and is worth the price of admission.

Jan-Michael Vincent and David Warner have fairly significant roles, the former as a detective and the latter as a pastor. It's nice seeing Vincent again after his 70s & 80's heyday. Olivia Hussey is also on hand as a dubious asylum nurse.

The score by Richard Lyons is standard fare with one moving piano-oriented piece that's surprising for a flick of this sort, and yet it somehow fits. It's repeated several times throughout the movie and is exceptional, an unexpected highlight.

The film was shot in Pasadena & San Gabriel, California, and runs 84 minutes.

749213,3,630397872X,"""Ice Cream Man"" is a tongue in cheek horror flick from director Paul Norman about frozen dairy products gone horribly awry. Starring the genuinely talented Clint Howard as Gregory Tudor, the film is not especially chilling. (No pun intended.) It is, however, peculiar and unique, scoring points for B-movie aficionados. Howard's performance here is totally over the top (which is interesting contrast given that a contemporary work of his was as an understated NASA flight controller in ""Apollo 13."") The film works because of Howard's hammy interpretation of the character.

The plot is fairly generic: traumatized kid grows up to be a messed up adult, who goes on a major crime spree complete with gratuitous (if totally unconvincing) violence and gore. As a child Gregory witnessed a mob hit on the local ""Ice Cream King,"" and has to be placed in the Wishing Well Hospital to help him recover from his emotional scarring. The expository dialogue ranges from the utterly contrived to hilarious puns and inside jokes. My favorite recurrent theme is from Gregory's doctor who keeps repeating the mantra ""There are no bad days Gregory, only happy days."" Obviously most of the young audience that this is intended for have no clue who Clint's brother is, or have ever heard of ""Happy Days."" Along the way there is plenty of padding and some ludicrous action: see Clint Howard dance (maybe it's better not to think too much about that,) see Clint knock over a huge display of paper towels in a dramatic flourish in a grocery store, see Clint perform an ice cream ritual in a cemetery, and much more. You get the idea. Numerous tried and true plot conventions are present and accounted for (parents don't listen to kids, etc.) while inept cops cannot solve this extremely obvious case. The real entertainment factor here relates to the hilarious and gratuitous casting decisions that never failed to amuse: while Clint is the clear star, the movie features luminaries such as Olivia Hussey (as a loopy nurse,) Doug Llewelyn (in an entertaining and brilliantly conceived cameo as a store manager,) and perfectly cast as the incompetent and irritating police detectives Lee Majors II and Jan-Michael Vincent (!) are always the last ones to understand what's going on. Before it's over even Steve Garvey shows up!

Ultimately, the collection of neighborhood children has to solve the case and take matters into their own hands with utterly predictable results. Not only is the conclusion perfectly obvious, so is the sequel bait. ""Ice Cream Man"" is a cookbook horror movie that's askew from the norm in its bizarre darkly comic details and references (the Pied Piper and very interesting puppetry chief among the eccentric directorial choices,) which makes it more enjoyable than a formulaic slasher flick. It's true that much of the acting is amateurish (except from Clint Howard, who is clearly having a ball chewing the scenery) and much of the script is uninspired, but what do you expect? It's a movie about an evil ice cream man made with a cast of children and Clint Howard. If you watch it for what it is, it's an amusing diversion and guilty pleasure for the B-movie fan in everyone.",1332028800,2,3185,4.940298507462686

749215,1,630397872X,"I rented this movie two years ago cause as always i am interested in updating my dvd collection. So I rented the Ice Cream Man  to see if it was worth a buy and i could not stand it at all. I found the plot, acting setting, and scares to be really lame. So basically this ice cream man is a deranged lunatic that abducts kids from there neiborhoods and brings them to his ice cream place. I don't remember much from this film cause it was so bad but what i do remember didn't impress me at all there was only one good actor in this film the guy that plays the ice cream man and one plus to a movie

doesn't save it. i think that this movie Ice cream man is too big of a let down and you won't get your'e time back if you see this film like me so i dont

Recommend this film to anybody other then fans of lets just say unique films.",1323302400,,831,3.847953216374269
749216,5,630397872X,"The movie starts out with a black and white episode out of the 50's. An ice cream man gets shot. A child come to get ice cream is disturbed by it, and I don't know how the kid got blood on his head. Converse supplied shoes to all the kids in the film, hence all the ridiculous shoe close-ups.

We then flash to modern times. Clint Howard plays the creepy ice cream man, one that has a great nervous eye tic. His sanitation within his truck leaves much to be desired as he scoops out ice cream which include human body parts. He is clearly deranged. What makes this movie interesting are the characters who are caricatures of themselves, playing roles stereotyped by dialouge. With names like Tuna Cassera, how can you not love them. Jeanine Anderson sits in a chair and comically squawks while her Reverend husband believes she is speaking in tongues to the archangel Gabriel and doesn't understand why his daughter Heather (Anndi McAfee who does cartoon voices) runs to her room.

The movie boils down to the kids vs.the ice cream man. It is a fun movie, but not scary for adults.

749258,5,630397872X,"Any time Clint Howard is the star of the show, you know Sid is in all the way. He's a first ballot B Hall of Famer. It was Clint's magnitism that drew young Sid to this film all the way back in 1995 when we saw the trailer on a rented VHS of some sweet 90's B horror. We loved it then and it held up incredibly over time. How could it not really? It's from the golden age of horror B and you have Clint Howard running things and being the perrenial B all-star we've all come to love.

Clint's character is called Gregory Trudor. He went mental as a young kid after he witnessed his idol, an ice cream man, being murdered. So Gregory is sent off to a mental institution. Upon his release, he becomes an ice cream man and starts kidnapping people, killing them and incorporating their body parts in his delicious ice cream concoctions. Is that not the B-est plot you've ever heard of? So we're moving along and we have Clint and just a wonderful plot and BAM! We get hit by the Jan-Michael Vincent train. We're up to 4 stars at this point.

As you may be able to tell, this flick didn't have too much going on as far as plot, but when you take everything mentioned above and couple it with horrible fake body parts well, Sid couldn't have been happier. A couple of highlights included an eyeball instead of a cherry on top of a sundae and a head at the top of a cone. So yeah we loved this flick 14 years ago and still do today.",1251763200,,1426,4.125899280575539

749262,3,630397872X,"Anytime you don't forget a movie, you know it can't be that bad.

Applying the above principle has led me to give ""Ice Cream Man"" 3 stars.

I'll never forget how well Clint Howard distorted my memories of long-forgotten ice cream men I encountered growing up.  Most of them (I think) were pretty cool guys working a part-time summer job.  But after seeing this movie, I can DEFINITELY imagine that some of them could have been hiding lots of secrets (like dead people and stuff).

Anyways, I kept hoping that they would make a joke out of the popsicle commonly known as the ""Firecracker"".  If I had written the movie, I would have given someone a Firecracker that REALLY WAS a firecracker!  Get it?  Just think:  one lick and KABOOM!  Ha!  I don't recall if the ""Ice Cream Man"" killed people or anything, but it appears to be a horror film.

Or a sulfuric ""Chaco Taco"" (that's an ice cream treat)!  Talk about hot sauce!

This movie definitely gets the creative juices flowing.  Inspiring and nostalgic - a DEADLY combination (get it?).

Please gift this movie to me.",1171929600,,1067,4.595744680851064
749263,5,630397872X,"The 90s started giving us horror villains that were more on the campy and silly side.  It must have started with Leprechaun, then quickly the whole subgenre went direct to video and remains there to this day.  Even now when you go to your local video store you're likely to see titles like Santa's Slay and The Gingerdead Man on the wall along with Nanny Mcphee and Fun With Dick and Jane.  These films may have the horror film structure, but basically they're comedies made for horror film fans.  Ice Cream Man came out in the mid 90s and didn't seem to find much of a cult audience though it's got cult film written all over it.  I'm not sure why it didn't make a bigger splash.  I mean, there is an audience for this stuff, they didn't make five sequels to Leprechaun because no one was watching.  Ice Cream Man is a real gem.  It has the immortal Clint Howard as a psychotic ice cream man driving a truck full of corpses, body parts and bugs.  He's obsessed with the idea of an ice cream man bringing happiness to children, yet he wants to kill the children.  Of course it's the kids who stumble onto his real intentions, and naturally the adults don't believe them.  An interesting cast is assembled for this film.  Alot of actors that will be recongnized by horror fans.  Their roles are actually quite throwaway(like David Warner's), and usually below the talent of the actor playing it, but it's still cool to see them in it anyway.  Clint Howard is the real star of the film however.  His mannerisms, his gravelly voice and his cornball lines are enough to have you rolling.  I mean, no one would ever buy ice cream from a guy who acted this way.  If a closeup of a cop chewing an eyeball(that's been cleverly inserted into his cone) doesn't have you giggling, then you may as well shut the damn movie off, but lemme tell ya, this is some funny stuff and should have been a bigger hit.  The picture quality on this dvd is for crap, but since no one will be in a rush to put out an Ice Cream Man Special Edition, this is what we'll have to deal with.",1151280000,8,2058,4.328981723237598

Its not very scary, its more like a comedy than a real horror, nothing like Jacobs ladder or hard core horror by Stephen King, but nevertheless i liked it. I loved the idea, of an ice cream man, with his truck, it reminds me of this movie, the ambulance..

I would recomend this movie, its not as low budget as i thought, but hell yes, it has a loooooot of shots of shoes, since its been sponsored by Converse.

One of my favourite scenes is the asylum scenes, its sick and has this sad and yet gruesome atmosphere, no wonder the ice cream turned the way he did after being in this asylum as a kid.. Shame

I hope this film doesn't whisp away like so many low-buget films seem to. This is a film with a very orginal idea and i bet if it was made today it would be an independent cult classic.

749317,3,630397872X,"I first saw Ice Cream Man (1995) about ten years ago at the Vic Theater in Chicago.  The theater often hosts musical groups, but they also do what's called a `Brew and View', showing films and serving alcohol.  This particular night was a special one, as the Vic was hosting a mini Clint Howard film festival, showing three of his films including Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979), Evilspeak (1981), and closed the night out with the world premiere of Ice Cream Man.  It was a blast as Clint was there to present each of the films, and the audience was comprised of only fans (soon to be drunken fans).  And to top it off, we all got little, plastic promotional ice cream scoopers.

Directed by Paul Norman aka Norman Apstein, better known for `adult' features such as Edward Penishands, The Erotic Adventures of the Three Musketeers, and Intercourse with the Vampire, the film, which contains no nekkidness, stars that lovable mutant Clint Howard, younger brother to famous director Ron Howard, better known to most of us as Lil' Opie Cunningham.  It's not unusual to see Clint appear in his older brothers films, like Splash, Cocoon, and Apollo 13, but don't think he relies on nepotism to get work as the bulk of his credits, films like Infested, Carnosaur, The Waterboy, to name a meager few, had little or no involvement from the elder Howard.  Also appearing from the `where are they now' files (better known as the `what the hell happened to my career' files) is Sandahl Bergman (Conan the Barbarian), Olivia Hussey (Romeo and Juliet, Black Christmas), David Naughton (An American Werewolf in London), Jan-Michael Vincent (Damnation Alley), David Warner (Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country), ex-baseball great Steve Garvey, Doug Llewelyn (from the 80's TV show The People's Court...' When you get mad, don't take the law into your own hands ... take 'em to court!') and appearing from the `I never had a film career, but I'm related to someone famous' file is Lee Majors II, son of the Six Million Dollar Man himself.

The story begins with the brutal drive-by slaying of an ice cream man, witnessed by a young boy, who is subsequently admitted to an asylum.  After many years the boy, named Gregory, grows into a man (played by Howard), and returns to his neighborhood, taking up the mantle of ice cream man.  He serves the regular treats, push-ups, bomb pops, etc., but his specialty is hard packed ice cream served on cones.  What makes his ice cream so special?  I'm not sure, but cleanliness isn't a factor as his truck (which bares the message on the back `watch out for children' with the `for' painted over) is littered with roaches, mice, worms, and parts of corpses...yep, the ice cream man is a bit on the psychotic side (the marshmallows in the rocky road are actually the whites of eyeballs...ewww).  After the disappearance of a few locals, the neighborhood children begin to suspect, but it's the age old story of the adults not believing, being wrapped up in their own, sordid affairs.  Will the children be able to convince everyone the ice cream man is a little `off'?  Or will they end up hard pack `specialties'?

As I said, I saw this at a Brew and View, and it was the third film in a triple feature, so we were all pretty soused by the time it came on, and after watching it last night, I discovered a heaping dose of alcohol made it whole lot better (take film with a six pack and call me in the morning).  The story, acting, and dialog are all lousy, but the feel is that it is intentional, especially with Clint hamming it up terribly.  The plot is pretty loosey goosey and predictable, which I wouldn't mind with a film like this, but it was just so darn slow at times.  The script was exceptionally lame, but it did contain a number of in-jokes (watch for Doug Llewelyn's appearance as a grocery store manager...he ends his final scene with one of better lines)  It was fun to see all the recognizable actors, but at the same time I felt a little sorry for a few of them.  Olivia Hussey is still as hot as ever, and she seemed to have a promising career in the late 70's, but took a wrong turn somewhere.  The same could be said of Jan-Michael Vincent (except maybe for the `hotness' part, but here he seemed like a real @ss, and from what I heard he is a real @ss, so maybe this is his comeuppance.  The direction and editing veer slightly towards the shoddy, but that's no surprise.  The film is listed as a horror, but that's only partly true.  Horror is defined as `An intense, painful feeling of repugnance and fear'...the repugnance part is appropriate, as the movie is litter with gross out gags like the ice cream man manipulating two severed heads, mounted on ice cream scoops, using the lever to move their mouths and having them have conversations.  There are no scary elements, just stupid, sometimes funny scenarios (funny if you have a slightly skewed, sick sense of humor).  By the way, if it seems like there's a lot of gratuitous shots of Chuck Taylor's All Star sneakers, that's because Converse, the company that makes said shoes, provided some of the dough.

The picture, presented in full screen format (I'm unsure of the original aspect ratio), looks quite good except, as another mentioned, there seems to have been a problem in the transfer in that every once in awhile a line does appear, sort of like a tracking glitch on a VHS tape...slightly annoying, indicating a possible loss in signal, but each occurrence is very short, less than a second, but still noticeable.  The audio is acceptable in Dolby Digital 2.0.  Not much in terms of special features except for some lame Ardustry trailers.

No, not when the ice cream man dies! I loved it and I reccomend it. Thank you for reading! Bye!",1015545600,,606,4.100840336134453

749351,5,630397872X,Rated R for Gore thats it. It is tottally bloody. Such as the Ice cream man putting a head on a cone. His origanal name is Greogry and he trys to follow the footsteps of the old icecream man and hes not about to give up. He's funny and he is also seen in my Dog Skip.,1004832000,2,267,3.7017543859649122
749352,1,630397872X,"this video is so boreing to even watch[...] First of all I never heard of this movie.. so I thought it looked cool and then I bought it.  Boy was I wrong.... The PICTURE of this movie was horribal.  I had to stand by the TRACKING button to keep the picture ok, the sound of it was very bad also.  The 85 minutes of this movie drags on.  It seems like its a 3 hour movie that has NO interesting parts at all.  My tip is if you bought this movie... then SMASH it with a axe, burn it, then dump the ashes into a fish tank and let the fish eat it!! Dont make a mistake of buying this movie or even renting it.  Its not worth the time and the money.",999561600,,644,3.8045112781954886
749353,5,630397872X,"This movie is probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. Me and my friend went to the video store to rent stupid horror movies for a sleepover and well we were looking found Ice Cream Man. When we saw the cover we fell on the floor laughing because it was so stupid. When we watched it it was so stupid we were cracking up. Like one part where the Ice cream man is chasing a kid through the supermarket and the kid hits the paper towel rack and it falls on him. Thats only one funny part, theres probably 40 different parts that are hilarious. I've rented this movie about 6 times and a couple of days ago I bought it. You will love this movie if you laugh at stupid horror movies. It is my favorite movie of all time and if your like me it will be your favorite.",999302400,4,764,4.066225165562914
749354,5,630397872X,"This is one of THE best cheap horror movies of all time. Does anyone really expect a super put together movie when you rent cheap horror? Nah. Well maybe Evil Dead. But this movie has all the cheap shock parts like these movies should. It has to do with a crazy ice cream man who witnessed the ""Ice Cream King"" get murdered as a kid and throughout his life he was in a messed up mental ward, and somehow managed to get the icecream man job. A group of kids called the ""rocketters"" know something is up and try to take him down. A big plus is Clint Howard who is great in this. The ice cream truck jingle is the perfect creepy jingle. The eyeball in the ice cream  is classic and Clint Howard has some awesome one-liners in it too. People critisize the acting but I see nothing wrong. This movie won't scare you, but for cheap horror lovers like myself, this is great.",978739200,2,867,4.22289156626506
749355,1,630397872X,"After reading the other reviews I was shocked to discover that these actors have an acting carrer outside of this movie, since this is the vehicle that crash-drives your carrer smack into the side of a 400-ft.  mountain and leaves you there. While there were some good scenes, there  were not many of them, and it's just not worth buying unless you are a  die-hard fan of B movies.

The worst shame was seeing Olivia DeHussey of  Romeo and Juliet fame sink to an all-time low as the Nurse. She was way too  overtalented for this movie.",954547200,,327,4.433333333333334

These celebs reached an all time low signing on for this garbage.  Clint Howard,  poor, poor Clint, Ron if you are reading this....get him a real acting  gig!  The acting, story, script, and sountrack are so horrible that it  comparison made ""Showgirls"" look  pretty darn good!  How sad to  see such people as Olivia Hussey and Jan Micheal Vincent reduced to such  garbage!  The special effects I must admit were fairly good, but totally  twisted.

7857925,1,630397872X,"It's like watching a ABC After School Special trying its best to be horror. It's goreless, boring and so bad it's not even good variety. What's more scary then the movie is the people who gave this film 5 stars. 48% of 50 some reviews gave it 5 stars?!? How is that even possible that at least 25 people on this planet, and I know there are more, think this is as good as such horror films that generally get 5 stars from fans and critics like Halloween, A Nightmare On Elm St, The Exorcist ect... Obviously there is a second edit of this movie floating around that I'm not privy to. A edit that incorporates everything that makes a 5 star horror film. Gore, suspense, good acting ect.....
