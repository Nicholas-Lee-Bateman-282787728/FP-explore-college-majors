7067148,4,B00UPL8510,"Now and then along comes a new film by a young director who co-wrote a story and brings it to life with a degree of freshness that makes us look forward to further works from his hands. Such is the case for Rick Lancaster whose little film THE ABDUCTION OF ZACK BUTTERFIELD deserves attention. Rick comes to this project well prepared: he attended Harvard, Yale, NYU (Drama) and Cornell University where he graduated with honors with two Bachelors Degrees, and went on to earn a Masters Degree. Rick then attended Film Editors school in New York City, learned the craft and became a member of the Film Editors Union. Catching the bug for directing he found a friendly mentor (and producer) in Stephen Ryder, the CEO of Metropolis Films, whose skills in writing are well known (the highly honored and populate L.I.E.) and together these two men wrote the screenplay and gathered a young cast of very fine talent and out came THE ABDUCTION OF ZACK BUTTERFIELD.

The story takes chances and that is why it works so well. A polished high school 14-year-old athlete (martial arts) and fine student - Zach (beautifully underplayed by TJ Plunkett) is not one to go along with his in-crowd macho classmates but has a fine and healthy relationship with his parents (Lisa Gunn and Aaron Letrick) and girlfriend Emily (Celine du Tertre). Out on a jog Zack is abducted by the beautiful April (Brett Helsham) who happens to be an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran with a creepy dysfunctional family history. April cuffs Zack, tacks him to a hidden cottage in the back country, and places a necklace loaded with malleable explosive beads, and begins what appears to be a BDSM relationship. Gradually both April and Zack find aspects of their own needs fulfilled by the other and have a deepening if bizarre relationship. At home Zack's parents continue to watch for Zack's return and the local sheriff (played with unusual skill by Stephen Ryder) and FBI agents try to find him. An incident changes the plot after three months have passed  - a young lad finds the cabin when seeking for assistance with his stalled car, sees Zack through the window, April notices and ends the lad's interference. Zack now realizes the full extent of April's war and childhood damaged psyche and the film ends with a surprise.

The story is told with restraint, due no doubt to Rick Lancaster's sensitive direction, and there are many subtle inferences about the manner in which we are living at present that give the story significant substance. This is a strong film from a committed company and crew top to bottom and deserves a wider theatrical release. Grady Harp, March 15",1426982400,11,2646,4.798245614035087

7067162,1,B00UPL8510,"I was forced to sit through this movie over the holidays.  This was one of those holiday movies that nobody would turn off because they thought somebody else might be enjoying it.  It was so bad that it just became a joke.  It wouldn't shock me if this turns into a, it's so bad it's good, cult classic.  This movie strangely tries to appear as if it's not politically correct while being over the top politically correct.  I'm surprised that some people actually thought this movie was a work of art.  Then again some people think monkeys throwing crap on a wall is art.  Even one of Amazon's super reviewers thinks this is a good movie.  They were greased with a free copy of another movie.  I would say this movie is a huge waste of time and money, unless you like really bad movies or you have the hots for one or both of the main characters or you smoke a lot of weed.  It would probably take about twenty pages to explain everything that's wrong, illogical or downright stupid with this movie.  I will just give a basic run through of what happens but I won't spoil the ending.  Sadly the movie doesn't end with a nuclear bomb dropping on everyone.

Basically, this movie it about 26 year old April, a young, wonder woman gone politely psycho, and 14 year old Zack, a teenage boy that is so super sensitive that it makes him a modern day ""real man"".  Zack is a perfect little guy, he doesn't drink or smoke, treats his body as a temple and believes in a strong education.  Oh and let's throw in that he's a karate expert who is really into using proper grammar.  The beautifully deranged April decides to abduct Zack because she hates men and wants ""to be like the teachers on TV"" and groom Zach into the man she wants.  Zack thinks it would be easier for April to just be a lesbian.  The police and Zack's parents are completely baffled by Zack's disappearance.  The police give up after three days and officially close the case. Ok.  Even though the case is closed the FBI comes in and two agents rumble around and we are shown intermittent scenes of them walking in the grass following hunches.  At one point one of the FBI agents states ""what are we doing here"".  I had the same feeling.

April had a hard life and would love to re-live her teenage years.  She was never taught anything by her mother and spent ten years taking care of her dying father.  During those ten years April also had time to join the war in Iraq, where she learned how to kill people and lost her virginity on top of a Humvee in an olive grove.  April also knows karate and is an electronics expert.  She rigged up a system to keep Zack locked up.  Zack was forced to wear a wood bead necklace around his neck.  This necklace was apparently made out of plastic explosives and would blow up Zack's head if he wondered too far away.  I was on the edge of my seat hoping his head would blow up.  The rough and tumble April was also ""drop dead gorgeous"" and would parade around her den of horror, scantily clothed.  Zack would also spend most of the movie half naked even though he amazingly came up with a complete new wardrobe after being kidnapped.  April struggled with her feelings.  She didn't know whether she wanted to rape or kill Zack or maybe both at the same time.  Zack was forced to watch April walk around almost naked and was even forced to eat her wonderful meals.  Even breakfast in bed.  I had to look away.  Yes, April was an expert cook who even made her own cheese.  April was also a great musician.  Zack and April would have impromptu jam sessions of singing and playing guitar.  Poor little Zack became so desperate to escape that he, in an attempt to gain her confidence, even has sex with April.  April wasn't fooled and she forced Zack to clean the bathrooms and scrub the floors in super tight fitting clothes.  Yes it's true,  Zack was forced to wear Spandex.  One day a stranger from Boston, with a broken down car and no cell signal arrives.  April is perturbed and breaks his neck.  He picked the wrong house.  Zack witnesses the murder and re-thinks his interest in women.  April then takes her bicycle to the dead stranger's car.  The car is now somehow fixed and she uses it to dispose of the body in a lake with no fish.  While she's gone Zack steals a pipe wrench that April used to fix his bathroom .  She also used the same pipe wrench to put together ""every single pipe in the house"".  Yes, April also builds houses.  When April returns on her bicycle Zack is waiting to make his move.  After 103 days of sex, great food and jam sessions he has finally had enough.  He seduces April into playing Cowboys and Indians.  Zack goes into the bathroom to put on his Indian outfit and paint his face while April changes into a Cowboy/Cowgirl.  Zack returns from the bathroom with a surprise.  He clubs April over the head with the huge pipe wrench.  April crumbles to the floor and Zack begins a very slow escape.  Suddenly, April magically jumps up and a strange karate fight ensues and then ...................................  I can't spoil the ending but I will tell you that at the end of the movie it informs us that no criminal charges were filed against Zack.",1453939200,9,5183,4.397260273972603
7067163,2,B00UPL8510,"This is such an amateurish attempt at approaching a controversial topic that it makes me wonder why the producers/writers/directors released this absolute mess.  The one nude scene in the movie was deleted.  The acting, that's not the right word for it, the script-reading is laughable.  It was shot in three weeks, I guess the phrase ""take 2"" was never heard on the set.  Not one of the worst movies I have ever seen but it is in the ball park.",1445904000,26,445,4.525

7067165,5,B00UPL8510,"Beautifully filmed; both lead characters played their roles well, though the abductor sometimes changed moods too fast.  The biggest problem with this movie is that the director missed getting visual details perfectly aligned from scene to scene--example, the sock that got stuck in the door.  Maybe some people don't mind that kind of thing, but because I thought the movie was really worthwhile and I did not want it to be criticized for such details, I wish the editors had done a better job.  But, by no means should you miss viewing this movie.  The story line is believable, though many people might not want to admit it.",1439683200,3,627,4.777777777777778

7067167,4,B00UPL8510,"In ""The Abduction of Zack Butterfield"" actors Brett Helsham & TJ Plunkett hold this delicate, and at times tender, story together about a boy held captive by a beautiful (and dangerous) Iraq Vet. I enjoyed this movie very much. It seems screenwriter Stephen Ryder & Director Rick Lancaster pulled this story from todays headlines. Bored with the Hollywood hits? You won't find anything like it on the DVD market.",1430956800,,412,4.9855072463768115
7067168,5,B00UPL8510,"The Abduction of Zack Butterfield is an incredible story written and directed with elegant dexterity and award-caliber standards. Everything about this film is excellent and I'm certainly not surprised coming from the writer of my favorite screenplay of all time ""L.I.E."", Stephen Ryder, and the extraordinarily talented director, Rick Lancaster. This film is a rare commodity in an industry filled with sequels, prequels, and remakes that lack originality, creativity, and talent. I salute the people that had the courage to bring such an amazing story to life in light of the fact that many contentious critics lacking intelligence and human connection would be bound to weather a storm of controversy. I highly recommend this film to my family, friends, and acquaintances and I look forward to more films in the near future from the dynamic team associated with this film.",1426982400,5,875,5.257142857142857

8707848,4,B00UPL8510,"Intriguing movie based on a true story. A little difficult to comprehend, why Zack stayed so long with his (mentally unstable) abducter, without trying to overpower her?  He excelled in martial arts, didn't he?  Perhaps he developed a case of Stokholm Syndrome?  Who used who?

8707850,5,B00UPL8510,"I take serious exceptions to the critics with their negative tirades against the contents and acting in this DVD.  T.J. Plunkett superbly portrayed a 14 year old New York boy stalked and abducted by a young woman who was an American military mercenary in Iraq as her PTSD-type aggravated past troubled youth erupted.  T.J. Plunkett acted the role of 14 year-old Zack Butterfield who was kidnapped at gunpoint, handcuffed, and taken to an isolated country home reconfigured for his prison.  The boy had started the ""awakening"" in puberty, and the female mercenary projected the disappointments of her own youth on him with bizarre sexual exploitations.  Certainly, the boy feared for his life every moment he was at her mercy.  The house was surrounded by mines and Zach had a explosive necklace put around his neck.  Of course, Zack was not able to deny his sex to her until the opportunity arrived for his escape.  There are news reports in the public about incidents of abuse by returning military personnel; whether is DVD is fact or fiction, it gives the awareness of proper re-entry into the public with appropriate professional attention.  The example of Zack Butterfield as a 14 year old boy and how he endures is instructive, and worthy of 5-stars-plus without a lot of ""Hollywood"" and everyday realism.",1486339200,9,1311,4.954337899543379

The Abduction of Zack Butterfield is worth more than what I paid for it. It's everything a movie should be. I hope Thunder Hill Pictures makes more movies. I would love to see Brett Helsham who played April and T.J. Plunkett who played Zack in more movies together. Thanks Thunder Hill For releasing The Abduction Of Zack Butterfield. I will always watch it and love it.",1484870400,,528,4.627659574468085
