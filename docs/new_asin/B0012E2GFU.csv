8245370,3,B0012E2GFU,"Christie's Revenge is one of those low budget made for TV movies you find on a budget DVD.  It originally aired on TV in 2007.  Like most of these DVDs, the cover image isn't representative of anything from the film.  I'm pretty sure she never wore a hoodie or even a red jacket.  The blurb mentions ""she wants nothing from them but their lives"" well she's only after revenge on one person. I think you pretty much would have gathered from the title this is about a woman named Christie who plans on taking revenge.  Basically she wants Revenge on her uncle, for reasons divulged as the movie goes on.  She enlisted an online friend to help her with her plans which will be kicked off by the woman visiting her uncle in his doctor's surgery.  She's also turned on the fake charm and has manipulated her way into being invited to live with her uncle, his wife and daughter.

There's no big name actors in this one, there's some regular actors from if you've watched a few of these, made for TV movies. Such as Cynthia Gibb (the uncle's wife), Annie Bovaird (the daughter).  John Wesley Shipp (the uncle) was apparently in most episodes of Dawson's Creek, I never watched that, but if you did you might recognise him.  Dani Kind plays the title character, I'd never heard of her before, she does the normal TV movie calm polite female psychopath, who looses it mentally and becomes ridiculously out of control crazy by the end of the film.

That ending of the film was just really weakly written.  It made little sense when the character after revenge learns all the facts and was as if the writers couldn't come up with an ending so just went with the same way a lot of these TV movies do.",1496793600,,1688,4.444805194805195
8245371,5,B0012E2GFU,"I've watched this movie on the LMN channel a few times, not the DVD.

The story contains what I feel is a very important lesson. People should not act based on an incomplete understanding of a situation.

Although in the case of this movie the action which is taken is murder. Murder is never an option even with a complete understanding.

Also by the time Christie takes those actions her mind has snapped anyway.

Dani Kind who plays Christie looks great in this movie.

This is a good movie by LMN standards.",1455580800,,511,4.510869565217392

8245373,5,B0012E2GFU,"I like suspense movies. I would definitely tell others to watch this movie. I movies where the female is the ""bad"" person instead of a man.",1355443200,,139,4.384615384615385
8245374,5,B0012E2GFU,"This movie was shipped to me in a very timely manner and it was in perfect condition.  The movie itself was a little ""strange"" to my feelings...?? But it was good and I enjoyed watching it. I have since passed it along to one of my daughters who enjoys these types of movies also.  I would certainly recommend this seller again.",1302480000,4,328,4.360655737704918
8245375,1,B0012E2GFU,"are u kidding me ??? the ending completely ruins an otherwise decent film . i'm not sure if the writer and /or the director thought we'd only be interested in knowing that he's survived or what ..... but are we just supposed to guess what happens to the main character in the film ? the audience wants to know what happens with christie for god's sake . the viewers hate her , and want to understand , for sure , that she's either dead , or going to prison for the rest of her life . we need to know this just as much as knowing he survived . it's amazing how a film can be entirely ruined with either a bad , or ambiguous ending . there's nothing more infuriating than watching a movie for 2 hours and then having to guess how it ended . cmon that's amateur guys .",1280016000,7,765,4.0394736842105265
