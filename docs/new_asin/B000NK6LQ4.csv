2772143,4,B000NK6LQ4,"A somewhat sad movie with a strange plot that leaves you a bit on
edge, even at the end of the movie. You can fill in a lot of the scenes with thoughts of your own, with the unspoken words that seem to capture this film.  Emotions run high, with tissue in hand, be prepared for a typical Hallmark style.",1215561600,3,303,4.05
2772144,5,B000NK6LQ4,What a heartwarming movie!  I disagree with the previous comment that the soldier remains a bit lost in the end--It's obvious that he realizes he is finally home. This movie leaves you with a smile on your face and a great feeling inside.,1212796800,15,238,4.534883720930233

2772153,5,B000NK6LQ4,"What a story! -- wise, and well told.  Romance and tragedy, with a blending of fantasy and a dash of comedy.  Plenty of beauty for eye, ear, and mind.

There are ""signs"" and broken hearts.  I felt again the limits of what we can do for people we love.  Perhaps I understand those limits better.  How many movies this entertaining are also good medicine for the heart?

Matthew (Zach Mills) and Grannie (Angela Paton) are simply charming.

2772154,5,B000NK6LQ4,"Clean, hopeful and very homey feel good movie. Makes you realize how hard things were for people in the past and how they stuck to their values and persevered. Shows the tragedy, heartache and rewards of ordinary lives.",1370476800,,219,4.7894736842105265

2772157,5,B000NK6LQ4,"Like every other Hallmark movie I have ever seen, The Valley of Light is a rich, emotional and beautiful movie. I loved the whole feel of the movie: Rural USA right after WWII, living a simple life, with good and decent, God-fearing people. This is such a refreshing change of pace from the usual ""entertainment"" that makes us have to put up with all the cursing, violence and routine degeneracy. I applaud Hallmark for producing and airing the quality entertainment that bears their name. I love the atmosphere, the writing, the musical score, and the cast in all their movies. And this one shines as a beautiful example of what real entertainment is all about.",1302739200,2,662,4.765217391304348
2772158,5,B000NK6LQ4,I first saw this on the Hallmark Channel and had to find it. I was so happy that it was available on CD. It is a touching story one to watch over and over.,1293580800,3,155,3.588235294117647

2772160,5,B000NK6LQ4,The Valley of Light-Hallmark Gold Crown. I had watched this movie on T.V. and decided to order it for the family. It was very sentimental and rewarding as the whole family sat down and enjoyed watching the entire movie. It was compassionate enough that my family is eager to watch it again.  The actors had affectional characteristics and played their roles well.,1274486400,4,363,4.854838709677419
2772161,5,B000NK6LQ4,"Very meaningful movie. This is an entertaining film with great acting, nice scenery, and one that contains valuable lessons worth knowing about. Glad to have had the opportunity to see this movie.",1271980800,,196,5.15625
2772162,5,B000NK6LQ4,"Great DVD Hallmark movie.  Enjoyable.  A movie I can watch over and over and still get teary eyed, even when I know what's going to happen.",1271203200,2,139,4.3076923076923075
2772163,5,B000NK6LQ4,"This is the story of a young soldier trying to find his place after the war when his only family left is a younger brother in jail. His skill is fishing, so he follows the rivers and eats a lot of fish. At one fishing spot he encounters an old fisherman who tells him about a lake in the neighboring valley where there is a huge fish that no one can catch. He also tells him of a fishing contest they hold every year where people come from miles around to prove themselves as the best fisherman.

He travels to that valley and finds the people welcoming and accepting of him and his skills as a fisherman. He makes particular friends with the sheriff's young mute grandson and they spend many hours together at the lake and the general store. A young widow, who provides the love interest,  offers him the use of her family's fishing cabin and he gets a job painting the local general store.

**Spoiler Alert**
While generally ""family friendly"" in the sense of the language and moral tone, there are some themes and footage that may be troubling to young children. The young widow tells Noah, the main character, that her husband killed himself at the fishing cabin after he came home from the war. And there are a couple of instances where the cabin is referred to as being haunted by ghosts, to which Noah simply replies that he doesn't believe in ghosts. But more disturbing may be the part where the sheriff's grandson is missing. After a lengthy search of the area, Noah finds his body in the lake and there is an emotional scene where he pulls him out and cradles him in his arms. This is followed by a scene of the boy's funeral on a dark, rainy day.

There are conflicting reviews as to the ""resolution"" of the story ending. I think it is quite obvious that the soldier has found his place in life, especially when you consider that he writes his brother directions and tells him how to find his way ""home"". But I must admit that after viewing so much that was sad and unsettled, I would have liked to  ""see"" the happy ending and not just had it implied.

I think the movie is very well done, but  it isn't something I would watch with little ones around and it isn't something I would reach for on a day when I needed a happy movie, even though it ends on an upbeat note.",1270771200,4,2280,4.338028169014085
2772164,5,B000NK6LQ4,This is a must have DVD for every family library - a totally wonderful movie,1267660800,,76,4.133333333333334
2772165,5,B000NK6LQ4,"An excellent film that the family can watch, with no swearing, nudity, violence or blasphemy. it is the story of a soldier who comes home from the war to find his parents dead and brother in prison. He wanders from place to place until he meets a mystical figure who directs him to the valley of light. He finds himself here and helps to change other eople in the process. well worth a view, it will brighten your day.",1259971200,19,418,4.30379746835443
