It features prominently in my Art History course.",1510012800,,282,4.549019607843137

7833250,5,6302994381,This was a great movie to watch and hear Georgia explain the ideas and thoughts about her own artwork in her own words.  It was interesting to see her interviewed out in her own element and seeing where she probably enjoyed living the best.,1369008000,,240,4.454545454545454
7833251,5,6302994381,listen as the famous artist speaks of land she loved as soon as she saw it.  half your work is done she said.,1363737600,,109,3.739130434782609
7833252,5,6302994381,"Love this vhs.  To hear Okeeffe talk, I felt like I was sitting with my wise Grandmother.  Definitely a woman ahead of her time.  I enjoyed that we heard HER personal opinions on her life and her art, and not the assumption of a critic.",1351209600,,236,4.2
7833253,4,6302994381,"I thoroughly enjoyed this VHS video program about O'Keeffe's art and life, because it featured snippets of a rare interview with her when she was in her mid 80s or so (early 1970s I think). It also featured some video interviews of Juan Hamilton, a potter, who was her personal assistant in her later years and showed them working on a retrospective catalogue and exhibit of her work.

There were also sections of art curators/historians and other experts talking about O'Keeffe's art and events in her life.

Overall, it is a bit of a valentine to her - everyting is presented in a positive way, editorially.

I was especially fascinated by the part of the program that dealt with O'Keeffe's relationship with Alfred Steiglitz, the photographer and her husband. In reading many biographies about her, I know they had a very difficult relationship, and in this video she alludes to that a little, with a twinkle in her eye.

The video arrived in very good condition and on time.",1302048000,4,978,4.769230769230769
7833254,5,6302994381,Oh my gosh! Make this into a DVD! What's to figure out? This is the definitive visual biography of the visionary modern Georgia O'keeffe- whose sprit and images have become essence and image of the 20th Century American mythos of the West meeting the inner necessity of the artist. A beautiful rendering that is scored magically. Moving and poetic. Unforgettable. DVD! DVD! DVD!,1273276800,6,378,5.015873015873016
7833255,5,6302994381,"There are now a few Georgia O'Keefe biographical films on the market -- but don't be fooled. This is the original one done for PBS by Perry Miller Adato, who specializes in making films about artists. This was made when O'Keefe was 90 years old and her large-format retrospective monograph (now a collector's item in its original edition) was first released. It's a visit with O'Keefe in which she more than speaks for herself. It discusses how her life and work was influenced by her relationship with Stieglitz and her love of the landscape. If you want to see not only her work, biographical information, and some artistic analysis (by very compelling art historians, not stuffy at all) and if you want to see this great artist at work and in discussion, this is the film to see -- IF ONLY someone would release it on DVD. No matter, hunt down the VHS if you can.",1230249600,9,866,4.5576923076923075
7833256,5,6302994381,"Being an elementary art teacher, this video was more than superlative for the classes I have been teaching.  This is the first version I've seen where Georgia is actually expressing the feelings and purpose of her own work.  It was a treat for myself and the students to see Georgia in the video.  The candid shots of her in her studio ahd homes was heartfelt and personal.  I wish it had been longer too!!",1205625600,,406,4.445945945945946
7833257,5,6302994381,"An eloquent view of one of the great 20th century artists who painted for her own amusement.  Despite some critics who did not get her or her subject matter, Georgia remained true to her Muse and painted the view of her minds  eye. This personal tour of her life and place gives us a sense of her  vision.",945475200,19,305,4.224137931034483
