7926527,5,B00004Y578,"When i saw the pokemon episode, ""The water flowers of cerulean city,"" I was amazed by Misty's sisters' synchronized swimming performance that Ash and Pikachu saw. Of course, i thought that performance has a playful Keldeo in it. What do you think of the girls' water ballet show?",1424476800,,279,4.833333333333333
7926528,5,B00004Y578,All the episodes are a big hit for our little ones and Meowth once again steals the show with his story. Five stars all the way.,1270771200,,128,3.9615384615384617
7926529,4,B00004Y578,"Yep, our ""hero"" Ash finally reaches Cerulean City, where he'll fight the local master for his badge. And this time, he's all alone. Misty left for no reason, and Brock had some ""stuff"" *cough* to do. Turns out the local master is 3 girls named Rose, Lily and Violet. And another shock. They're Misty's sisters. Gary has already been here and won a badge, and the pokemon are all exhausted, so they decided to just give Ash the badge. Misty doesn't want any of that, though, and challenges Ash herself. After a while, the battle is interrupted by Jessie and James, who have come to steal all the pokemon in the gym. Pikachu stops them by jumping into their soaked machine and shocking it till it explodes. And, since Ash wuld've easily won if he had used Pikachu, Misty's sisters give him the badge. Misty doesn't really agree, though.
So, following the game, they're on their way to Bill's cabin, eh? Or maybe they just go directly to the next town?  Nope, the writers didn't want the show to end taht fast, so we get some feared filler episodes. Don't worry, this is good filler. Enjoy it while it lasts, cause in a few seasons, you'll hate filler with a passion. First off, Ash is informed about an unofficial gym nearby, where the savage pokemon master AJ lives. AJ doesn't want to start his pokemon journey until he's won 100 matches in a row, and is now up to 98. AJ is also one of the best trainers out there, and his Sandshrew easily defeat all of Ash's pokemon. Ash is a bad loser, and claims AJ was cheating. And later, he critizeses his training methods. Look, Ash, this guy's a lot better than you, so just shut up, okay? Jessie and James show up again and try to steal Pikachu, but accidentally steal Sandshrew instead. Sandshrew beat them up, and runs back. So, they go back to get Pikachu. AJ defeat their pokemon without any problem, and get his 100th win. Then he leaves for his journey.
Later, Ash still can't mind his own business, and critizeses Gizelle, the leader of a student program on Pokemon Tech, a school where you can study pokemon. Pass the exam, and you can enter the pokemon league without badges. And training, obviously, so I doubt you'd get very far. Anyway, Gizelle has a pretty special training system, and to prove her greatness, she challenges Ash. And loses. That makes her realize that her system isn't really that good, and that the school doesn't really teach you much useful stuff. J&J show up, and get defeated when the entire school gang up on them, and Ash continues his journey.
So, my opinion, eh? 3 pretty solid episodes. As much as I hate filler, I have to say that these were actually good. I didn't expect AJ to defeat Ash, but I'm glad he did. He was better, and whatever stupid plot device the riters would've come up with, I'm sure I wouldnt've liked it. Add in a couple've good battles, a gym leader episode, and some good plot, and you got a pretty decent pack. Not worth a 5 star, but still good.",1058313600,,2954,4.470370370370371
7926530,5,B00004Y578,"These are some of my favorite episodes of Pokemon! They're cute, funny, and exciting! I love this video!",1041120000,2,104,4.833333333333333
7926531,4,B00004Y578,"If you've ever bought a Pokemon video, you know what's in store here, three episodes from the TV series. These episodes were pretty good, but weren't as action filled as other eps. In the first episode, ""Lights, Camera, Quacktion"", the gang runs into movie producer Sven Spigelburg who needs a Pokemon for a co-starring role along side his star, Wigglytuff, in the movie, ""Pokemon In Love"". However, the only Pokemon that Wigglytuff gets along with is Psyduck! Next comes ""Go West, Young Meowth"". This is one of the rare episodes that focus almost entirely on Team Rocket! They follow Ash and company to Hollywood to the premier of Pokemon In Love. Along the way, Meowth tells the story of how he learned to talk like a human! Finally, in ""To Expect The Onix-Pected!"", our heroes run into a rampaging Onix as well as Elite Member Bruno, who teaches Ash that the real secret to understanding Pokemon lies within. All and all, this is a good buy, especially if you're looking for Pokemon episodes that don't have a battle every five minutes! ;)",985132800,,1042,4.730769230769231
