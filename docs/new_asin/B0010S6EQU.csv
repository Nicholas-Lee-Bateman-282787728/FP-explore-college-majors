8238237,2,B0010S6EQU,"I purchased jennifer nichole lee's Fabulously fit moms, and i loved it.  i thought it was easy to follow and not too complicated but at the same time, it gave you real good workout.  I was disappointed when i tried doing this workout.  Really not my style.  For those of you that like working upper body You might like it. I enjoy mostly cardiac aerobics and lower body workouts.",1267660800,,379,4.449275362318841
8238238,4,B0010S6EQU,"I am not trying to lose weight, only tone. I do both portions of the video (basic plus the special floor combo) to get real results.
This video didn't seem difficult the first time I did it and I immediately thought I would need to find a video with ""more of a workout"" but after trying it a second time and getting the moves right, I am really feeling the burn. I have been doing it everyday for 4 days and then one day off. It is really a good total workout for overall toning and balance. I will probably get other videos in about a week or so, but I will continue to work this one into my routine occasionally.",1207353600,5,614,4.082644628099174
