7918084,2,B00003CXST,"My husband and I just watched ""3000 miles to Graceland"".  I turned to my husband and said ""What a great movie"".  He said to me ""The critic thought it [was bad]"".  I was shocked; ""That can't be"", I said.  He pulled up the review, and I read in disbelief.
I don't know what movie he watched but it couldn't have been this one. I have watched many movies with higher ratings than this that I didn't enjoy nearly as much.  The movie was what it was.  I don't think they were trying to make a moral statement, or win an Oscar for Drama.  It was fun, active, unpredictable, and outlandish.  In short, ENTERTAINING.  What most movies have gotten away from.  I watch movies for a little fantasy.  If I wanted true-to-life I'd watch the news.  I agree with most of the other movie-watchers and give this movie ""two thumbs up"".  I would recommend this movie to friends.  It was a breath of fresh air watching Kevin Costner get dirty.  Again, I'm glad I saw the movie and then read the review.",1014422400,3,982,4.348066298342541
7918085,5,B00003CXST,"Start the countdown and get ready for the trip of your life! ""3000 Miles to Graceland"" is one far-up, far-out, no-holds-barred movie. Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner are two diametrically in tandem partners. Gun battles, car chases, doubles crosses, twists and turns abound in this high-octane pursuit to the closet thing to utopia these characters can possibly conceive.  Trust no one and believe only half of what you see is the best way to survive this cross-country quest for El Dorado. This is the 21st century's version of the  `Auteur theory' at work here.  However, as usual I can see the handwriting on the wall. This is another great Kurt Russell movie that nobody is going to go to take serious.",989884800,,705,4.809917355371901
7918086,4,B00003CXST,Great movie with lots of action. Will keep you on the edge of your seat. Gives an interesting perspective of Vegas casino security and how they react.,989452800,,150,4.592592592592593
7918087,1,B00003CXST,"There is just nothing redeeming about this flick. I was so excited for it, too-- I haven't seen Kurt Russell in anything for a while. It started out good, and could have been a whole lot better, if only the director and screenwriter hadn't decided to flush it down the toilet. From the unnecessarily bloody slaying in Vegas to Ice-T flying through the air hanging by his feet, ""Graceland"" is a series of images that pop into a 14-year disturbed boy's head during an algebra test.
Unless you're into drivel, skip it.",989280000,,515,4.608695652173913
7918088,5,B00003CXST,"I don't mean to badmouth Costner, but he has had a bad run of appearing in less than great films.  Plus, he can sometimes turn in some pretty poor excuses for acting. Well, He is amazing as the real bad guy in this film!  I was so shocked and amazed at his performance.  This is undoubtedly the best role to date for him.  He is very evil in his role of Thomas Murphy, killer, robber, and he thinks Elvis is his father. Kurt Russell does a sort of reprise of his Elvis performance.  I always thought that the Elvis movie he did was the best one, and he was the best Elvis.(next to the real KING). The movie is full of fast-paced action and comedy, and there is also a love story thrown in.  5 criminals, a few fresh out of prison, decide to rob a casino because no one else robs casinos - It's original - The hotel they decide to rob happens to be in the midst of the INTERNATIONAL ELVIS CONVENTION. They all don their Elvis attire.  Christian Slater and David Arquette are also part of the crew.  They hit the casino up for over $3 million.  The money seems to switch hands alot in the film after they all split up and go their own way. Courtney Cox plays the love interest for Kurt Russell.  I am not a big fan of hers, but she is actually very good as the sleazy/waitressy type who is a single mother raising a budding Criminal.  I was really entertained by this film.  I have to agree with the other person here who reviewed the movie!  So, in closing, for those contemplating whether or not to spend money on this film - I would say it is most definitely worth the price you pay.  If you are in the mood for a good action/comedy caper, it is an excellent choice.",983145600,9,1667,4.16875
7918089,1,B00003CXST,"This film is so bad, it can't even live down to its apparent ambition of being the worst movie ever made.  There are worse, but not many.  For those who never got the Elvis craze, this film will make no sense at all.  For Elivs fans, this film will make no sense at all either.  I have no idea why the whole Elvis theme was even in the movie.  In fact, I have no idea why the movie itself was made.
There are a lot of recognizable and talented actors in the story, but their performances are pathetically weak, and their characters are all despicable.  The plot is ridiculous: a gang of robbers dressing up in Elvis costumes to rob money from a Las Vegas casino.  The rest of the movie is nothing but blood and guns, as they all turn against each other. You end up wishing all the characters would just kill each other off at the first opportunity to get it over with, but it drags on forever before they finally do.
The whole movie is filmed with the attention span of a never-ending music video, which gets really annoying after the first 30 seconds.  Jumpy edits throughout, loud music that has nothing to do with Elvis or anything else, you get the picture: don't see the picture.",982972800,5,1184,4.32579185520362
7918090,5,B00003CXST,"I know that some people will say that this is a rip off of Ocean's Eleven, or Reservoir Dogs, or whatever pseudoflick they've watched lately, and there are some things alike, but this movie IS certainly cool entertainment at its best. Costner plays a psycho (who says he is Elvis's love son), and Russell a misfit, in the wrong place at the wrong time, who try to pull a heist, but it goes awry. People have said that it is too violent, that the shootings look made up, but, hey, that's the point: it looks crazy because it is supposed to be crazy; Courtney Cox leaves her child with Kurt because she was nuts, they fall in love because this IS a movie, it isn't supposed to be a real life story. Of course, everybody is entitled to have an opinion, but before you express yours: WATCH this film. Even if I'm not the biggest Kevin Costner fan, I mus admit that he is the best part and the best actor here. This movie IS the coolest new release",982886400,16,943,4.273743016759776
7918091,5,B00003CXST,"I had the good luck of being invited to a preview of 3KMTG (while on a trip), and what some people had said would be another Tarantino-like movie (nihilistic movie-making full of childish dialogues that mean nothing and don't even entertain) turned out to be a very good and entertaining film. By now everybody knows the story: a bunch of goons (commanded by Costner) go to Las Vegas to rob a casino, which happens to go so bad that soon after the shooting and death of security guards and some pretty cool action sequences, all of them turn against each other. Kevin Costner (grrreat as a cold-blooded, mean badass) shows that despite the ill fashion of hating him (his only sin has been to overestimate the intelligence and sensibility of moviegoers) can portray other characters as well -or even better- than the next door middle-age man he's done a couple of times before. This IS great fun, open your minds, enjoy this movie for what it is: cool, hip road noir.",982281600,13,966,4.654970760233918
