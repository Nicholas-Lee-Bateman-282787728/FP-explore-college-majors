1885968,5,B00009NH9R,"Great old movie. But to love these you do need to be someone  who enjoys old black and white movies.
Great old cars.
And the wardrobes.
Enjoyable",1459209600,,145,4.37037037037037
1885969,4,B00009NH9R,Typical storyline. Recognized a few actors from other movies of this era. Fun to watch!,1458950400,,87,4.866666666666666

1885971,3,B00009NH9R,"Alpha Videos produce PUBLIC DOMAIN films, and sell them for about $5.
Often, these videos are a little rough because they're usually from 16mm film stock.
An occasional jump-splice or substandard audio is the price you pay for the PRICE you pay.
This IS available for two and three times the price of THIS one. It served its purpose on a
rainy day... certainly no worse than a modern-day movie of the week on The SyFy Channel...
It's not that much, and it MIGHT just surprise you.",1439683200,,480,4.528735632183908
1885972,2,B00009NH9R,"Less a mystery than a confusion of misdirection.  The story frustrates at every turn.  A man (Leslie Fenton as Barry Wilding) rescues and ungrateful woman on a ship crossing the English Channel.  She's cold, rude, and indifferent to his advances.  She refuses to give him her name.  He vows to track her down because he's a nitwit who mistakes her rebuff for an invitation.  Once in London, Wilding learns he is heir to his uncle's estate, The Hawk's Nest.  He's forced to sign a declaration that under no circumstance will he ever sell the estate.  Then he tries to take possession of the property only to be met by barking dogs, a thug with a gun, and ordered to get out or else.  By sheer unbelievable coincidence, his mystery woman (Muriel Evans as Julie Kenmore) happens to live there with her gun toting dad.  The dope then tries to get help from his lawyer, the police, a detective friend only to be thwarted at every turn.  No one will help him gain what is rightfully his and no one will tell him what is going on except to say it's none of his business, don't ask, won't say, sell and get lost.

The plot, built entirely on evasiveness, is more that a little exasperating.  The story advances only because three gangsters get involved because they think the house holds a treasure they want.  Otherwise, it's an endless repetition of dopey Wilding declaring his love to a woman who keeps telling him to get lost, leave her alone, don't mettle, while everyone else conspires to relieve him of his property, one way or the other.  Even Scotland Yard gets involved in depriving him of due process (apparently, in 1936, England wasn't concerned with civil liberties).  When the reason is finally revealed as to why they were more than happy to cheat the dope of his inheritance it is so ludicrous and preposterous one wonders why they bothered.",1435795200,2,1850,4.628834355828221
1885973,2,B00009NH9R,"Print not the best... certainly not remastered. The rendered audio by Alpha Video is absurdly bad - throughout the film there's another audio-source parallel to the soundtrack.... a sort of TV game-show or auction: ""Buy one, get one absolutely free!"" and ""$70... go! $170... go!""... etc., were a few choice words I picked up. Needless to say it rather spoils the movie.",1386633600,,369,4.967741935483871
1885974,4,B00009NH9R,"""By ye blood that cometh from my heart, I swear to keep ye, Hawk's Nest, 'til death do us part."" If I heard it in the movie right, that was the poetic vow made by Barry Wilding's ancestor some 300 years ago, and something which Barry himself takes to heart. Barry Wilding is an American tourist in the UK who learns that he's the sole inheritor of a previously unidentified uncle's entire estate and fortune, the jewel of which is this old dark manor known as the Hawk's Nest. But when Barry goes to check out his new property, he's abruptly chased off by a hostile groundsman and an older gent with a pistol.

When confronted with something like this, one can normally turn to the law to enforce one's own legal rights. But what if you're getting the bum's rush from your lawyer, from the local constabulary, from Scotland Yard and even from the British government? Barry faces obfuscation from all corners, and even his American police detective pal (who's in the UK hunting down a murderer) ends up giving him the runaround. Barry then finds himself embroiled in even more dubious shenanigans, what with a shady scientist, a trio of American gangsters getting into the mix and a conundrum concerning a parchment cryptogram which may or may not lead to pirate swag. And, importantly to Barry, the girl he's fallen for is mysteriously residing in Hawk's Nest and she keeps telling him to keep out... of his own damn house. But our lead character has a resolute streak, and I couldn't help but chuckle when, at Barry's umpteenth attempt to get to the bottom of things at Hawk's Nest, the girl's stern father barks out: ""What's he doing here again?"" For a 68 minute long flick, it's a lot of stuff to take in.

Coming out in 1936, HOUSE OF SECRETS is a very modest, no-frills mystery flick straight out of Poverty Row, meaning that it's briskly paced, low budgeted, and peppered with lesser lights for its actors. I had never heard of Leslie Fenton, Muriel Evans, Noel Madison, etc. Nevertheless, this turns out to be pretty watchable stuff. First of all, I love old black & white movies and I say to Alpha Video and its like, man, keep on churning out these old suckers for posterity. HOUSE OF SECRETS moves briskly and does have its share of suspense and snappy dialogue. There's a wink of the eye, also, regarding the Brits muddling thru the American characters' use of slang.

Just to let you know, there's probably a SPOILER or two in the last few sentences of this paragraph. HOUSE OF SECRETS is not what's considered a straight up Old Dark House movie because it doesn't have enough of the requisite elements. The house is old and dark and creaky and beriddled with strange characters, secret passageways, and the occasional bloodcurling scream. The local rumor even touts the place as haunted. But the characters aren't zany enough, the butler isn't creepy enough, and there's a general lack of spookiness. And not enough time is spent exploring the Hawk's Nest. I think it's kind of funny that the new owner so frequently finds himself confounded when he tries to get into his own manor. After the first few tries, I frankly would've given up and followed everyone's advice to sell the dang property. But Barry Wilding, persevering in classic movie hero fashion, manages to grab the crooks, stage a last minute rescue, unearth the treasure, get the girl, and solve the puzzle - or at least has the puzzle explained to him. For a minor thrill, catch HOUSE OF SECRETS, if you get the chance. In my opinion, it rates 3.5 stars out of 5.",1243123200,10,3541,4.644338118022328
7992063,3,B00009NH9R,"Barry Wilding (Leslie Fenton) arrives in London, England, after meeting a mysterious woman on board the ship he traveled on. Once in his hotel, Barry is visited by his friend from the States, a Chicago detective named Tom Starr (Sydney Blackmer), who tells him he's trying to find a murderer. If that's not enough, Barry also discovers that his rich uncle has died, and left him a fortune, and a huge mansion! Upon entering the grounds of his new property, Barry is turned away. It is revealed that something unsavory could be taking place in THE HOUSE OF SECRETS (1936). Barry soon finds out that the woman from the ship lives there too! Why is everyone, including her, trying to keep him from his own estate? While making another attempt to gain entry, Barry is attacked, and hears screams and bizarre cackling from the house! When he finally does get inside, the puzzle only grows more confusing. The police refuse to help. Even his uncle's attorney encourages Barry to sell his inheritance, known locally as HAWK'S NEST. Only Tom is willing to assist Barry in his search for answers. Will he ever get to the bottom of this perplexing business? In fact, this movie keeps its secret all the way to the finale, supplying very little in the way of clues until that time! Decide for yourself if the payoff is worth the wait. I enjoyed the movie, but did think the immense buildup was a bit much, considering the end result...",1511740800,,1424,4.654761904761905
7992064,5,B00009NH9R,"On an ocean voyage from the U.S. to the U.K. Barry Wilding (Leslie Fenton), rescues a mysterious woman (Muriel Evans) that is apparently being molested. He immediately falls in love. However she will not tell him who she is.

Barry decides to stay in London, find the girl, and marry her. While waiting there he is contacted by his lawyer (not a barrister or solicitor.) You guest it he has inherited an old mansion from a rich recently deceased uncle. Upon trying to poses the mansion he is mugged and ran off at gun point. The local police won't help Scotland Yard won't help; even his best friend (a detective here on a case) won't help. Everyone says sell and get out.

To make matters worse the girl shows up and says ""You don't understand"". She is living at the mansion and says sell and get out.

That leaves only three possibilities, hidden treasure, nefarious gang activities (shielded by the government), or ghosts.

As Barry approaches the mansion again he heard a blood curtailing shriek and a hideous insane laugh.

The whole film and story is executed quite well and you will climb the walls if they do not quit saying ""You don't understand""",1505692800,23,1155,4.642156862745098
7992065,4,B00009NH9R,"Not the best mystery I've ever seen but very enjoyable, acting okay to good, the print's a bit dark in places but then, I don't have the greatest eyesight.  The only true flaw in the movie is right at the beginning when Barry inherits the place.  His lawyer (solicitor) has him sign the papers and gives them to him.  Then next, turns around and does his best to get the hero to flake off and never go back to the place he's supposedly inherited.

Excuse me?  Why in bloody hell did he contact the hero to give him his inheritance in the first place, if he (the solicitor) is part of the plot?

Otherwise -- good fun.",1504051200,,617,4.230769230769231
7992066,3,B00009NH9R,"I think the synopsis of the movie on the back of the DVD of an American man inheriting his uncle's estate (""Hawk's Nest"") in England and ensuing strange events is a little more interesting than the actual film.  The character of Julie is constantly saying ""I can't explain"" or ""You must go away"" and other phrases to that effect which gets pretty old after awhile.  The plot was a little convoluted and somewhat slow to get going and then you have an ""kitchen sink"" kind of ending. However, the audio and visual are just fine which can sometimes be a little dicey with these B&W mystery transfers from the 1930's to DVD.  It's okay, but not much better than that compared to other B-movie mysteries of this era.",1487203200,,711,4.5390625
