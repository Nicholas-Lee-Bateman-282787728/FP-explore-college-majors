2682375,1,B000K4X5XK,"I bought this because I love Superman II. It was one of my favorite movies growing up and I figured ""How different could this version be?"" Well it's a lot different. From what I understand we (the audience) are supposed to view this film as a ""What could have been if Donner had directed it"" and forgive the fact that it makes the movie choppy and loses the heart that I thought was what was so great about it. If I were going to release this to DVD or especially to Blu-ray, I would have made it an extra disc released in a boxed set like they did with Blade Runner. Why is it so hard to believe that people would want the original version on Blu-ray? If I knew when I bought it what I know about this version now I would have just kept on shopping.",1202860800,9,750,4.074324324324325

2682377,2,B000K4X5XK,"A lot of rabid fans of the Superman movies have this idea that Richard Donner's original plans for SUPERMAN II were better than the version that was originally relased in 1980 (as finished and credited to director Richard Lester, who is credited with directing the truly awful SUPERMAN III). Sorry, but I really liked the version of the film as we have known it for over 25 years and I wish that version were offered in Hi-definition as well. I really found this Richard Donner cut to be slow and containing way to much of the corny and bad comedy that poked its head briefly in the 1978 SUPERMAN film (for example, anything with the Ned Beatty/Otis character is really embarrassing). Now on prominent display in this version, Gene Hackman's really bad bald-cap for Lex Luthor shows up even with the soft-focused/diffused photography. And, with all due respect to Christopher Reeve's excellent Superman, I have never liked his Clark Kent, which seems weaker here than the original version of this film -- The excessively slicked-backed hair and Mr. Goofy secret identity pales to George Reeves smart and controlled reporter from the old 50's TV show.

2682378,1,B000K4X5XK,"I am so glad I purchased the regular DVD version of the Donner cut before I knew the Blu ray version was out. If you are a fan of 1 and 2 as I am, this is a rip-off and a waste of time and money. Case in point, there is a scene between Superman and Lois Lane that was imported in from  ""screen test"" footage. They didn't even look the same. Don't spend a dime of your valuable Blu Ray money on the Donner cut. You'll be sorry you did. Be forewarned.",1197244800,4,449,3.827956989247312

Anyway, superman II Richard Donner cut is very good most of the way through, but as SupermanFan rightly said, it literally loses the plot at the end.  Suddenly none of the film makes sense and it's hard to believe that an entire production crew didn't see the fault.  However, adopt your suspension of disbelief and ignore the last silly 5-10 mins and it is well worth adding to your library.  Would love to see the other original Superman II brought to Blu-Ray too though.",1180656000,3,641,4.547826086956522

2682382,3,B000K4X5XK,"The potential was certainly there for Superman II to be as exceptional as the first film and this re-cut proves that Donner's original approach was stronger then the released film. Unfortunately re-cutting a film with missing and sub par pieces doesn't make it a better film, but simply an exercise in the filmmaking process. It is an interesting view and if you like Superman II as it is, then skip this. This cut is too little, too late.",1165276800,3,439,4.641025641025641

(1979) Superman: The Movie - 3 Hour TV version

(2006) Superman: The Movie

(1981) Superman Two

(2006) Superman Two: The Richard Donner Cut

*

The 2000 version of Superman 2 has about 8 minutes of additional footage, but the general plot stayed about the same between the theatrical version and the special edition. But there are major differences between either of the earlier versions and thee Richard Donner Cut of the film. I only saw it for the first time in the last few weeks, and now I love it more than the other versions. Now, if we could just convince the owners of the TV version to allow it to be released on DVD. I had it on VHS tape, but my sister threw it out. Darn it.

I highly recommend this movie to you, along with all the other SUPERMAN versions you can find.

This Blu ray is actually 116 mins and NOT 127 minutes as specified. It actually says so on the back of this Donner Cut Cover. Before Blu ray I bought a DVD of Superman II and this is 127 minutes.

Much preferred the Lester (cinema-released) version of Clark's reveal to Lois. Donner's ending was mondo-weirdo.  Movie is dated now, but still fun to watch, and interesting to compare the two versions. Christopher Reeve will always be Superman...'nuff said.

2682412,2,B000K4X5XK,"Sorry, but this is the reason why there is editing in movies.  I found the Richard Donner version to be dramatically worse than the theatrical version.  I found it absolutely awful at times -- dialogue that should have been left on the cutting floor, especially those moments between Reeve and Brando.  The fabulous John Williams score was muted in key scenes.  Lois Lane even shoots Clark Kent in order to prove he is Superman.  The editing of this crap was the right choice in most of these decisions.

They even left out my favorite scene: when Zod and his cronies are in the Daily Planet, and Superman swoops up with the WIlliams score blaring in the background, and says ""General, care to step outside?""  Why would you take that out of the movie?  My son was watching this for the first time, and I felt bad that he missed out on that part.",1395273600,5,845,4.477124183006536
2682413,5,B000K4X5XK,Did you ever wish you could see one of your favorite movies in a slightly different version? Well now you can! & with Marlon Brando reprising his role as Jor-El which gives it a little bit more of an impact! A great buy. Really enjoyed it.,1394928000,2,239,4.217391304347826
2682414,4,B000K4X5XK,"The Salkinds made a huge mistake not allowing Richard Donner to film both of his Superman movies. This film has the ending they tacked onto the first film (cheapening it in my opinion), where Superman turns the world backwards in time to erase Lois memory of his identity (and it works better here). The Kryptonian villains don't have any stupid non-Kryptonian powers, and to be honest, Donner does a far better job than Fleischer (who it seem did everything he could to make a bad movie) since he understood the character better. This is the definitive Superman II.",1394409600,2,566,4.785714285714286
2682415,3,B000K4X5XK,"It is unfinished but the movie was better than the original one that came out.  We know that Donner wasn't part of the movie through to the end but there are bits of this that just are bad:

1)
The intro with the missiles flying into space.  The effects look pretty bad.... and yes, I know looking back now that was probably the best that could've been done.

2)
The ending to this cut was basically the same as the first one.  If Donner was able to do both movies, I imagine that they would've changed that but if the ending to the first one were used in the second one instead, that would've been epic..... and of course, if the phantom zone were destroyed some other way (like collision with the moon or some other space body), I could respect that more.

Well, it's a nice version to have but it could've had a better ending and I think that if they put the ending from the original released version here, it might have worked instead of what they did.  It had a George Lucas Star Wars redux ending that took you out of the film and really made no sense especially since that's how the first one ended.  But then Richard Donner admitted that he would've still been working and would've changed that if he weren't fired from the film.

Buy it for curiousity and for some good scenes here and there.",1394236800,2,1301,4.299180327868853

2682424,5,B000K4X5XK,Have watched the original release of SuperMan 2 and enjoyed the bigger budget special effects etc.  The Richard Donner cut I enjoyed better because it had more of a romantic storyline between Clark and Lois.

2682425,3,B000K4X5XK,"Really?! Lets turn back time again? Is everyone supposed to just forget that's already been done? Not to mention that it renders the entire movie pointless, puts the evil trio back in space as a possible future threat all over again. Lex is STILL going to plan his escape, find the fortress and exploit Superman's secrets. And since Clark has never been to the diner, now he's just a thug that shows up and beats up a complete stranger for no reason.

Shame on Richard Donner. Face it: He had an axe to grind after being fired from the film. Now years later, both he and the studios capitalized on fan obsession to cash in. At the expense of continuity and making sense? An important rule in film making: respect your audience. You can't expect them to pretend the events of the first film didn't already happen!

I prefer the original theatrical release hands down. Now instead, my kids say to me ""Daddy, why is he doing that again? That's just dumb.""

My wish for the re-edit? Just take out some of the silly slapstick of the original and let Lois remember. Oh, and lose the celephane 'S'. That WAS pretty cheesy.",1372204800,,1115,4.50990099009901

The audio is amazing and the new angles and special effects are much appreciated by a Superman fan. However, watching it made me mad, I feel robbed from the previous version, I just can't understand why the perfect dialogue of Lois & Clark was taken off and replaced in the first place, it was perfect! Also, the Jor-El & Kal-El footage is just beautiful and adds so much to the movie! I felt like a five-year-old again when watching it. Absolutely recommended for any fan.

As one reviewer pointed out, there are a few plot holes in the Donner version. Nevertheless, just from the point of watching Superman as an action movie for some fun, I wouldn't mind the film's lapses in logic. I think khe revenge scene in the diner towards the end is necessary. It is illogical to include it after the turning back of time to save Metropolis, but all along the film, I was looking forward to the revenge scene while I like Superman's flying round Earth's surface to eliminate the damages done. I also prefer cutting out Lester's funny moment when a guy was still on the phone when being blown with hurricane forces.

There are, of course, some issues with some of the content, but this is simply due to the fact that Donner couldn't really go back and re-film things for his version.

This is the only movie where the primary villain is actually a match for Superman and not Lex Luthor or some stupid yuppie businessman. It is like a breath of fresh air to actually have Superman using his powers and fighting villains who are as strong as him.

I always liked the original Superman II, but this Richard Donner Cut shows the promise and greatness that this young director at the time had. As far as I'm concerened Richard Donner is Superman's father because he gave birth to 2 perfect movies that his fellow directors were unable to re-create in the following awful sequals. The Marlon Brando appearances were far more affective than the ""mommy"" substitute. Great version. Great movie. Greatly recommended.",1343520000,3,573,5.172043010752688
2682434,2,B000K4X5XK,"Why so invested in these stupid director feuds.  It is far more understandable the feud between Burton fans and Schumacher fans (the difference in style was overly obvious in the Batman franchise) than this feud between Donner and Lester and yet I would think it would be stupid for Burton to go back all these years and wipe out Schumacher's work in Batman Forever (in terms of Batman and Robin, lets just forget about that movie ever existed.)  What we have here with Superman 2 was a culmination of two directors and it was a box office and critical success.  Donner got paid for Superman II and what more is had a long career with Warner Bros.  So it not like he is owed anything.  So why would Warner Bros. even make this ""cut and paste,"" rough cut called the ""Donner Cut,"" the only Superman II available for Blu-Ray?

I have no problem presenting the alternate version.  It certainly is interesting but as someone who grew up with the theatrical version it feels in many ways wrong.  Too many sequences are out of place or missing; and swapping the triumphant opening with Superman saving Lois Lane in the Eiffel tower for Superman not saving Lois Lane jumping out the window seems like a bad move (especially considering Lester does a better job with the same scheme at Niagra Falls).  Superman II should be a bigger and bolder film than the original but what we get with the Donner cut is a film that is a rehash of Superman I.

No offense to the Donner fans out there...By all means have your Donner cut, but I'm plenty sure the rest of us probably would prefer the re-mastered theatrical version when they are buying it on blu-ray.

Oh but wait here is a novel ideal that has been done with other movies on Blu-Ray...Provide both the theatrical and alternate versions on one disc.  Its not like either version of the film have ever been packed with special features that would rob the massive Blu-Ray of disc space.

Donner's ego or legacy or whatever you call it here is the winner and Lester loses after 30 years.  I'm sure its sweet revenge for Donner but the truth of the matter is the fans of the movie who loses out.  If WB doesn't release the theatrical version its the fans who ultimately loose.  WB may be fine with that. Its just a shame how they treat films from the past.",1341619200,2,2293,4.475961538461538
2682435,1,B000K4X5XK,"Anyone who wants to argue over different cuts of ""Superman 2"" is wasting their time, in my opinion.

I do wish the ""Superman 2"" theatrical version was available in Blu-ray, since I liked it far better than ""Superman"", later purchasing the DVD theatrical edition of ""Superman 2"".  We have an improved sequel, quite rare.

But I cannot watch this alleged Blu-ray, the Richard Donner cut, since it's obviously not in high definition.  And only that defect currently matters to me.  (Had to trade the first one in for a second Blu-ray with the identical defect, only way of satisfying ""Amazon's Rule of Two"").  But Amazon still refuses to ever watch a defective DVD/Blu-ray, denying me any proper remedy, even under ""The Rule of Two"".  This fraudulent Blu-ray was briefly ""Under Review"", just another Amazon hoax.  It's up for sale once again, almost certainly still not in high definition.

But Amazon, once again, is really at fault.  Amazon has no excuse for its failure to separate Blu-ray reviews from reviews of standard definition DVDs.  I do keep stressing this starting point, one simple reform Amazon could make, if it cared about helping Blu-ray customers.  But Amazon never cares, my conclusion after months of futility.

Such an obvious manufacturer fraud, in standard definition at best, is the last of a fraudulent/defective quartet that first caused me to learn about Amazon's inability to deal with such horrible Blu-rays and an awful DVD.  I earlier wrote highly negative reviews about the other three: ""Total Recall"" [Blu-ray] (Wrong screen aspect ratio and not in high definition); ""West Side Story (50th Anniversary Edition)"" [Blu-ray]( Audio and video out of synchronization); and ""Judy Collins - Pop Legends Live"" a DVD I received four of, all with the identical manufacturer defect, a stall/skip in the same two songs, ""Both Sides Now"" and ""Turn, Turn, Turn"".

That's why my satisfying the ""Amazon Rule of Two"" MADE NO DIFFERENCE!

All four, despite being placed ""Under Review"", were never reviewed, far as I can tell, still being sold with the exact same manufacturer defects I identified long ago.  Since I don't give up, the worst one, ""Total Recall"", is under review again, thanks to countless hostile reviews of a totally fraudulent Blu-ray.  Makes no difference, so long as ""The Amazon Rule Against Watching Any DVD/Blu-ray"" trumps both logic and any consideration for Amazon customers.

Whatever we customers write in our reviews is intentionally ignored by Amazon, a matter of policy, since such reviews are only intended for customers, according to Amazon.  Yes, I agree this unwritten Amazon policy is highly insulting to customers, but Amazon doesn't care.

Even when I managed on the phone to guide Amazon customer service people to over 5 years of blistering reviews declaring the alleged ""Total Recall"" Blu-ray to be a manufacturer scam, it still continued to be sold.  I expect no change, despite this fraud being ""Under Review"" for a second time.  So long as ""The Amazon Rule Against Watching Any DVD/Blu-ray"" remains controlling, Amazon is incapable of protecting its customers from the ""Total Recall"" Blu-ray manufacturer fraud; also any similar manufacturer frauds.

I'm a pessimist by nature, and thus better able to truthfully evaluate Amazon's countless failures to serve its customers.

And I refuse to give up, unlike all those people whose reviews of the phony ""Total Recall"" Blu-ray were disregarded.

My hope remains that somewhere out there, at least one Amazon person in authority, will revoke all of Amazon's anti-consumer rules.  I can always be wrong.  Amazon's ""Rule Against Direct Contact With Customers"" is designed to prevent me from ever communicating with the same person twice.  That obnoxious rule must first be overcome before all the others can possibly fall.",1336348800,4,3821,5.1474878444084275

Almost 30 years later Major Studio corrects its mistake. I liked Superman 2 when it first came out except for certain scenes. As it turns out the scenes I didn't like were the scenes that are NOT included in this version. This is a better film. More Father/Son character development, less inane humor, no plastic S-logo weapon (WTF) no Forget-the-Past kiss (WTF) and no Eiffel tower opening bang. Both Superman 1 and 2 were filmed simultaneously as a two-part epic with a Turn-Back-the-World ending. They rushed the first movie and used the ending intended for the second film. Richard Donner's version uses the same Turn-back-the-World ending. This is the only problem I see with this version. Personally I don't think it needed it. It made sense in the first film since no one wanted to see Lois dead. But it would have been an even better and more emotionally resonant film had they left Lois heart-broken. It would have been in keeping with the emotional tone of the Father/Son relationship, that of emotional ties lost. But they opted for a rehashed Happy ending instead.

In this version, the missile that Superman sent to space in the end of the first movie exploded and freed Zod and his friends. Ok, but if Superman made the time go back in the end of that movie, in fact, that missile was never shoot, so the villains were never set free. In this second movie, again, Superman uses the same trick to make the time go back to make Lois forget that he is Superman (among other things). And then in the end of the movie, he goes back to the restaurant where Clark was beaten by a tough guy and everyone remembers him and the fight! How can this be if the fight hadn't happen?

2682458,5,B000K4X5XK,"I fell in love with the first two Superman movies in the late 70's early 80's when they first came out--I guess I was attracted to the gentle goodness of Superman and the father/son God/Christ analogy.

Those were the good old days when they weren't afraid to say, ""truth, justice, and the American way"" in a Superman movie.

I remember reading once that there was a completely different film version of Superman II out there, shot with Marlon Brando and including many other differences before Superman II (for various reasons) came under the directorship of Richard Lester.

So: here it is, the ""original"" version, and the question for a fan of the original is: is this worth buying/seeing? The answer is yes. Simply on a curiosity perspective, seeing the two different versions is fascinating (what one writing/directing team added/deleted, the special affects ""extra's"" thrown in by director Richard Lester vs. Richard Donner, etc).

Which is better? Well, the Donner version flows more seamlessly from the first movie and is missing some of the grating things from the Lester version like Lois's desire for ""freshly squeezed orange juice"". The father/son dynamics are also (of course) much stronger. In the scene where Superman argues with his father about becoming human so he can live with Lois, he comes across as much more selfish in the Donner version. But the Donner version is missing the high-octane Eiffel Tower beginning, and is duplicative of the first movie with Superman turning back the planet again.

This Blu Ray Disk version is fantastic quality, and the surround sound played well on my system, literally shaking the room at various times.

If you liked the original Superman II, you will enjoy this version.",1282262400,13,1731,5.034965034965035

In a bad economy you don't like to buy 5 versions of the same film! I am 34 years old, when I was a kid the theatrical version of Superman 2 got four stars and blew me away! I though it was more fun campy and I love campy also action packed! It didn't drag and wasn't as boring as Superman 1. I thought so as a kid. Richard Donner is a wonderful director but I don't understand where these reviews are coming from! This is for die-hards only, terrible ending makes no sense and Donner may be a bit jealous of Lester because many as myself believe this to be the best Superman movie. I heard Donner did alot of work on this film and that I did not know. This is another movie and I loved the original. Anyway, Brando Rules and buy this because of him! I'm think I saw Brando's parts in a mixed version of Donner and Lester's film with more acting from Reeves but If I didn't that's the only reason this movie could be better. Mixing the Brando parts in is the only improvement, save the dark edge stuff for horror flicks this is an action fun movie with thrills. I love horror movies. I might pick this up for Brando. Just saw the movie, rented it and I suggest you do the same. Show the kids the better Lester version, more Zod, more action, more fun. Please! Donner did a good job but it's high time he made another hit movie! All the fun is taken out of this movie some cool parts, like the fortress of solitude being destroyed, also more Brando is cool.

Silly slapstick and this weird preoccupation of dubbing every character in a scene(no matter how minor) detract from the more dramatic elements of the film. Although I have to admit that Donner's use of test footage and repeating the reversal of time gag, also detract from his version, it is more in keeping with the first film and therefore the preferrable version for me from here on in. I suspect a hybrid of the two versions excising the worst excesses of Lester(as in the Donner cut) and using Lester's Superman reveal and ""the magic kiss""(which I think with the use of some visual trickery, perhaps flashbacks from Lois Lane's perspective gradually fading and maybe a little, I don't know, electric charge as they kiss to suggest Superman is using some power to delete those memories, would work better) may make it a more satisfying film as a whole.

Although that footage was interesting, the movie for me, just didn't work. Chris Reeve, and Margot Kidder did a fine job in their respective roles, but the movie was campy at best and I thought the whole point of making a superhero movie back in the day was to show ""what if Superman was real"" in a real life situation. Turning back time twice was downright retarded and then at the very end of Donner's version on Supes II where he goes back to the diner, made no sense whatsoever. Turning it back once was bad, but twice?!?

Even to this day I have a hard time watching that because Superman is such a good ""person"", who would make him that angry to let that kind of a cry out? Obviously Luthor.

Iyla Salkind was quoted saying that Lester's version was better. He was right. Donner is a great director and he tried to keep it light, and more geared towards the 1980's family.

This review is specifically for Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut.

God bless Richard Donner for undergoing all the painstaking effect to restore Superman II to how it was originally intended to be seen. This edition is the only version of Superman II you will want to watch. It is restored in all its glory as Donner initially conceived for audiences to see.

Superman II is at his best under the wonderful direction of Richard Donner. Donner's work on Superman is immaculate and so caring. It only makes sense that when Donner released his cut of Superman II it is nearly as good as the first film. Donner's Cut is also vastly superior to the theatrical release of Superman II. This is the version you will want to watch. Donner cuts out the campy elements of Superman II's theatrical cut and adds in his own more serious scenes. It is as beautifully shot, well written, visually charming, competently acted, with creative practical effects like the original movie. You must understand that Donner was not allowed to finish all of the special effects so some of them look incomplete, but you still believe you are watching these events happen. You should ignore their incompleteness because Donner's version is so much more compelling and complex than the childish theatrical release.

Christopher Reeve again is Superman incarnate as he shows goodwill towards men in his heroic actions to save lives. You will love him as the iconic hero all over again like the first movie. He strives to live in love with Lois Lane, but he must take up the challenge of the villainous General Zod. It's a brilliant tale of self sacrifice and demonstrates why we must do what is right. Reeve's acting is so sincere and endearing as Superman, you are always rooting for him.

The supporting cast is as delightful as the star. Margot Kidder is even more lovable and fun as Lois Lane. Her clever reaction and intuition in finding out Clark Kent is Superman is a blast to witness. Gene Hackman returns as the greedy Lex Luthor in all his vanity and deception. His joyous revelry in being conniving is a pleasure to see. Terence Stamp is magnificent as General Zod with his booming deep voice and commanding presence. Director Richard Donner even managed to get new footage from the legendary Marlon Brando to reprise his role as Superman's loving father Jor-El. Superman II boasts an excellent ensemble.

John Williams' score for Superman II is as superb as Superman: The Movie's musical accompaniment. When the main theme swells, so does your heart. It is as captivating as when you first heard these notes reverberate into your memory.

In conclusion, Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut is a must see superhero film just like Donner's debut Superman movie. He improves the terrible theatrical release in every way. I will always love this film. Thank you for the experience Richard Donner.",1525219200,,2917,4.857142857142857
8154306,4,B000K4X5XK,I really liked this movie when it was released in the theaters so I decided to buy a blu-ray copy of it.  That was 9 years ago and I finally just decided to open it up the other night and watch it.  Guess what?  The disc did not work for there was no information encoded on it!  I guess after nine years it's too late to return it.  I probably should start watching the films I buy as soon as I receive them.,1499817600,,408,3.8674698795180724

It's not like the original cut was horrible, but this is the way Richard Donner wanted it edited before he was yanked from the project. The movie is not perfect, but it still holds up after all these years. It is an enjoyable movie and one that looks especially good on Blu-Ray.",1473292800,4,331,4.1875
