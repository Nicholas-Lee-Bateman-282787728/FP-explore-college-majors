8604981,1,B00EF44BQ6,I would give it zero stars if I could. It really should mention that the DVD won't play in the US. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!,1473984000,,126,3.8846153846153846
8604982,1,B00EF44BQ6,"Don't be tricked into buying this DVD set because of the affordable price...what they don't emphasize is that you will be unable to view if your DVD/Blu-ray Player is Standard (Standard is ""Region 1"" -USA) versus another less popular or ""Region 2"" (UK) DVD/Blu-ray player.

Don't be surprising screwed like I was. SUPER DISAPPOINTED to be misled just so one would be forced to spend more money to either return product (S&H Charges are more than the bloody DVD set), OR buy yet another hard to find Regional DVD Player that is being phased out. Pathetic.",1473724800,5,554,4.770833333333333
