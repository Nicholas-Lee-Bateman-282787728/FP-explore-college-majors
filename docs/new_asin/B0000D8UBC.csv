8000235,4,B0000D8UBC,"I had a young talented friend who taught her neighbor all the steps to a complicated dance from her class. This neighbor, was then able to step right into an upper level tap class, and so saving her mother much money! You could use these videos in the same way.  I had told my daughter that if she would learn these steps, I would enroll her in class. She was not motivated enough to do that. So I saved myself a lot of money. No need to spend money on something people are not really motivated to practice. The video itself really does teach you the steps I remember learning while growing up. Some of them seem to be taught in a different order than what I learned, but there is nothing wrong with that. She has several levels, and tells which steps she covers at each level - so pick the one that is right for you.",1362355200,,817,4.170886075949367
8000236,5,B0000D8UBC,"Ginger de Paris' ""Learn to Tap Dance Beginner"" program is an easy step-by-step format with 15 steps covered in the video. Every step is broken down into 3 parts and each step is introduced and demonstrated with music. Next, each step is filmed up close and repeated four times, making it easy to follow. Finally, it's your turn to practice the step.

As a former tap, ballet and jazz dancer (back in my youth) I thought I would return to dance in order to get in shape. I was thrilled to discover Ginger's Beginner Level. She breaks everything down, making it easy to follow and definitely more fun than working out! In no time at all I was remembering the steps, tapping right along with her. Even though I had years of formal dance training as a child, I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated Ginger's simple teaching method. I would recommend this tape to anyone who is interested in getting started in tap, or who, like me, needs a refresher to get the old legs working again.",1248998400,,977,4.551136363636363
8000237,5,B0000D8UBC,"Having only had a few months of tap dancing lessons, I felt I needed "" extra tutelage"" and found  that Tap with Ginger.  Beginner Vol. 1 a fun and easy way to learn to tap. With Ginger as your personal instructor you can just practice with her without constantly rewinding.  Steps are very easy to follow and understand. With this video tape you don't need any other beginner tap videos. I can't wait to get Tap with Ginger Intermediate Vol. 2.",1044489600,15,444,4.45679012345679
8000238,5,B0000D8UBC,"If exercise isn't fun, you won't do it  This video makes you forget that you are exercising because you are so busy enjoying the process.  Highly recommended!",1033689600,10,158,4.814814814814815
8000239,2,B0000D8UBC,"The video is a little confusing. While the tap steps can be both heard and seen the demonstrations are a bit unclear. To a beginner it might be even misleading. To a little advanced students there are some help to clarify a tap mystery (terms and steps). However, cannot be recommended to an absolute beginner because the video might be misleading and even teach bad habits to tap. To others, please be careful and ask a demo watch from your dealer before buying. Also be ready to compare different kind of tap tapes if possible. Sure good points are a Tap Glossary and printed Tap Steps in the end of the tape.",1027555200,,611,4.464285714285714
8000240,5,B0000D8UBC,"Great tape, I recommend it to anyone, I am a beginner and had no problem grasping the different steps and the instructions. The way the steps are reviewed make it easy to memorize. I've always wanted to tap and this tape got me motivated even more. I will definitely order tape 2 and 3.",1026172800,9,286,4.314814814814815
8000241,5,B0000D8UBC,"This video is great. It's easy to follow for beginners, and contains 15 different steps. 4 of the steps on this video put together make the popular shim sham routine. Each step is broken down into 3 parts. First the step is demonstrated, then it's slowly repeated 4 times filmed up close, and then you practice the step 3 times with music. This makes it easy to learn without a lot of rewinding. Ginger doesn't talk or explain when she's doing the steps, you just have to look and follow. I don't think this is a problem; it's easy to see how to do the steps when they're filmed up close. And at the end of the video there are written instructions on how to do each step.",1006473600,13,671,4.25
