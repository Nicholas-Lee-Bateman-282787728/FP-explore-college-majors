Michael Moore had all the fireworks and media blitz but this little gem had all the details.  This is truely a movie to celebrate the free speech and to gain an understanding of others.

2136679,5,B0002X8U4I,"My wife and I saw this movie and were blown away by it. In many ways it is low-key but that just makes its impact greater. Compared to the part of ""Farenheight 9/11"" that dealt with the Iraq war this is much better - better made, better at giving the viewer a feel for the reality of it all, better at seeing into the hearts of real people. Unfortunately ""Control Room"" won't have the impact that it should have, because it isn't distributed by a ""major"" and thus will mostly be in repertory, experimental, art & dinner theatres. I understand that the ""majors"" have also declined to distribute a video, and that the very human US Marine officer featured prominantly in the movie has been disciplined and will resign his commission. It makes one wonder about the freedoms we are supposedly defending against terrorists by invading Iraq, and are determined to impose on the Iraqis whether they like it or not. I hope that many people buy this movie and see it that way.",1094688000,22,967,4.563218390804598
2136680,4,B0002X8U4I,"This movie is absolutely essential if you want to get a glimpse on how the arab world felt during the war in Iraq. This is a great documentary: no voice over, no questions or interviews, no one-on-one sessions: mostly bits of life captured while following journalists of Al-Jazeera. Some may find this a bit too one-sided, but hey: this is about Al-Jazeera, not about the press coverage of the war. Although for contrast, I'd really like to see the same documentary filmed inside CNN or Fox News.

I have to say that I was amazed by the knowledge, the culture, the humor and the sharp analysis that is displayed by all the protagonists. It makes this documentary truly enjoyable. I felt a lot of empathy with the journalists, watching them struggle, endure the insults and the hatred of the rest of the media and the US administration: they were showing what noone else wanted to show, they questionned the army spin and brought the arab point of view, and a lot of people despised them for that.

This is a very intersting movie, if you want to get both sides of the story. This is also a great documentary.",1094342400,25,1108,4.562814070351759

Some will say that they slant the news toward an Arab point of view, but as the editor states at the beginning of the film; ""Some Arab governments did not like their reporting of corruption etc. and we were banned from satellite service in those countries.""

2136695,2,B0002X8U4I,"I don't use the word ""propaganda"" lightly. But as someone who was in Iraq at the time, I can see that the film makes an awful lot of incredible assumptions. Probably its most outrageous accusation is that the US military deliberately assassinated an Al-Jazeera journalist. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. This documentary doesn't provide any evidence whatsoever.

The documentary also claims that the toppling of the Saddam statue was a fake or ""staged"" event. They said that the Iraqis there were not actually Iraqis, and must have been brought in by the Americans. As if a combat unit is going to bring in a dozen non-Iraqi Arabs all the hundreds of miles from Kuwait, though combat operations???? (Especially when they are traveling through a country full of Arabs already!). They asked why there wasn't more of a mob if people didn't like Saddam. Well the truth is, there was still a war going on, and there were still sniper shots going on in the square. They asked where did the Iraqi flag come from, that it must have been brought in by the Americans. But actually one lieutenant brought the flag with him with the hope of using it - I don't see how that makes the event ""staged"".

The only ""other side"" of the argument is given by an inexperienced LT Josh Rushing, who is obviously over his head and the documentary takes advantage of this. Heaven forbid they might actually interview someone with more experience or more knowledge about the war itself (like even me). Incidentally, I should also point out that later Rushing left the Marines very soon after the documentary was made and was offered a job at Al-Jazeera. How convenient. A quid pro quo? Hmmmm...

Anyway, the documentary is well-made from a technical standpoint, but take the whole thing with a big grain of salt.",1299974400,4,1808,4.825806451612904

The film lets the interviewees do all the talking which is more effective and believable than listening to a narrator. The best part I think is a 5 minute long extra video on the DVD called ""Deema in control"", which is an interview with a TV producer about the Arab world not being in charge of its own history as much as it should be.",1295395200,,507,4.347368421052631

2136700,5,B0002X8U4I,"As someone who was taken in by the original sell job of the Iraq war, this was difficult to watch and to come to grips with. This engrossing documentary is done in a surprisingly low drama style for such a deep and important subject. The US' media has been woefully inept at doing its job of reporting what has really been going down and instead has become mostly a bunch of talking heads looking out for their careers and ratings. Truth and perspective have been deeply lost. Instead we have newscasters reporting (or ignoring!) the major events of our day with less background, perception and thoroughness than a good sports reported puts into their job. The difference is that sports are all just games for amusement while warfare is deadly serious. We should be paying more attention to the really important things and less to the trivial.

2136704,4,B0002X8U4I,"The US State department has declared it the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden and claims it has direct links to Al Qeada operatives. Since September 11th, Aljazeera TV has became a worldwide presense in the international news market. ""Control Room"" goes behind the scenes of the operations of Al Jazeera and the key people that have made Al Jazeera the phenomenon it is today. Headquartered in Doha, Qtar Aljazeera is the only news network in the middle east and is known for it's provocative programing.  US, Jewish and Arab policies are discussed on various news and discussion panel programs.

""Control Room"" takes place during the beginning stages of the US invasion of Iraq and depicts how news information is reported differently in US and Middle Eastern Media.  The most fascinating part of ""Control Room"" is understanding the lives of Western educated, intelligent Arabs who strive for democracy.  This depicts Arabs in ways that our news media never reports.

This film really portrays the complexity of the struggles within Iraq and the other Eastern territories.  ""Control Room"" also forces you to realize that Al Jazeera isn't the only one censoring it's media and feeding propaganda from all angels.  All we have to do is turn on Fox News or CNN and receive the same treatment. It makes one wonder If the news portrayed Arabs striving for democracy would the people of our country be as quick to approve of war.",1242604800,,1420,4.916317991631799
2136705,4,B0002X8U4I,"The Control Room is a documentary filmed in the CENTCOM media center in Qatar on the eve of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The film attempts to study how the Arab network Aljazeera covers the impending invasion and how the network interacts with the US military media advisors. The filmmakers appear to be very unobtrusive, and allow the images and commentators to speak for themselves without the use of manipulative music or narration.

As the title suggests, most of the action takes place in the Aljazeera control room where producers and anchors conduct what is broadcast across the largest Arab network in the world. Senior producers conduct the screens like a chaotic orchestra that somehow ends up perfectly constructed to their liking: essentially, a very one-sided, anti-Invasion propaganda machine.

However, one is hesitant to simply label Aljazeera as a biased, anti-American, propaganda media outlet. For one, they are not propagating for any single government or religious ideology. In fact, the documentary points out that since its inception in 1996, Aljazeera has been banned in several Arab states because of their critical allegations against certain Arab regimes. Also, the core of their staff appears to be made up of a multinational Arab force: some seemingly very traditional in their manner and appearance, and others very Western and liberal. None of the woman on TV or behind the scenes were garbed in a burqa or hijabof any kind. On the contrary, the women were dressed very fashionably and could have been comfortable in any western society. Almost everyone spoke English, and were obviously well educated and intelligent. So, if Aljazeera is known to be openly critical of many Arab dictatorships, and if judging by their women's roles as producers and anchors (and not dressed in typical Muslim garb), we cannot say that they are propagating for any particular type of government, nor any particular religious faith. What the film shows, and what the Aljazeera staff say themselves, is that they are firmly on the side of the Arab people as a whole. Being from many different backgrounds and levels of faith, they all have one thing in common: protecting and standing up for their own people. The problem arises when pro-Arabism transforms into anti-Westernism...in the case of the impending war on Iraq, anti-Americanism.

The one major failing of the Aljazeera network is that it does not conform to what we in the West would consider ""journalistic integrity."" Whether Western news is biased one way or the other, the journalists at least attempt to perform the basic journalistic tasks: gathering information from all sides, then reporting it as factually as possible without attempting to be overly manipulative or biased. Aljazeera, on the other hand, feels that their job is not to simply promote the news, but to serve their core audience; the Arab peoples. This means ignoring anything that could be seen as pro-Western or pro-American. The network staff insists that they are not trying to be anti-American out of stubbornness, or some preconceived bias against America, but that they are simply doing their duty by reporting the war from the Arab perspective; a perspective that views all American intervention in Iraq as having negative consequences. Aljazeera regularly depicts images of women and children who have been mutilated by American forces in the course of battle. They showed American POW's being interrogated by their captors (the documentary points out how this is against the Geneva convention. An Aljazeera reporter retaliates by pointing out that holding the prisoners in Guantanamo and the Iraqi war itself are violations of the Geneva convention). They play dark music as American tanks roll through the city. Not once (at least not in the film) did they attempt to portray Saddam's villainy, only the US villainy.

The Aljazeera reporters, while unabashedly biased against the invasion, make it a point that they are not simply trying to be anti-American, but are standing up for the Arab perspective of the war. While they never seemed to tell a lie, or bend the truth (on the film at least), Aljazeera never attempted to justify the war in Iraq. But why should they? Or why should the US expect them to? They are providing an alternate perspective to the war; a perspective that is definitely one-sided, but one that is not necessarily told by dominant Western media. So does this justify Aljazeera's lack of journalistic integrity? As one Aljazeera reporter puts it, ""is any media unbiased?"" While barely owning up to their own lack of journalistic bias, they do point out a few flaws in the US military's propaganda: one concerning the US military positions during the initial invasion. The US announced they were in Baghdad when the Aljazeera network proved they had not yet reached or taken the city (the US, it seems, was trying to frighten the Republican Guard into believing they had already taken the city, thus putting them off guard when the tanks actually rolled in). This is not so much propaganda, I suppose, as it is legitimate disinformation to throw off the enemy. The other incident was more obvious: as the tanks finally rolled into Baghdad, the streets were clear of Iraqi citizens, all except for a strange group of young men waving an Iraqi flag and wholly supporting the US invaders. According to Aljazeera, this particular group of 20 or more young men (all around the same age) were brought in by the US as a media propaganda tool. Aljazeera reporters claimed that these young men were not Iraqi citizens because their accents were not Iraqi, and neither was their demeanor or attire. Aljazeera also claimed that the men were waving a pre-1991 Iraqi flag (why not a current flag? Because Iraqi outsiders could only get their hands on a pre-1991 flag). And when the US media cut to the so-called citizen's as they approached and tore down the infamous statue of Saddam, Aljazeera points out that it was not throngs of Iraqi citizens, but this same 20 or so young men. Where were all of the other citizens, asked Aljazeera? Where were the women and children, or at least men of varying ages? As the camera pulls back, it is plain to see that the streets that were supposed to be full of swarming Iraqi citizens was only occupied by a few tanks and this small group of men. Again, a small propaganda tool used by the US forces, but to an Arab audience, US deception.

The other major event depicted in the film was the so-called targeting and killing of a few Arab news reporters. At the beginning of the film (and prior to the US invasion), the Aljazeera producers made it clear that they had notified the US military as to where exactly they would be located (where their news building was, where their satellite facilities are, etc), as not to be accidentally targeted by the US military. Later in the film, and thus after Baghdad had been taken, a US military aircraft missile hits and kills an Aljazeera reporter right on the roof of their own building. Apparently a precision hit. Simultaneously, 2 other Arab television targets were ""accidentally"" hit with aircraft weapons. Since previously the US military had been growing tiresome with Aljazeera's biased (and what the US military considered enemy propaganda) reporting, and since the Aljazeera building was well known by the military, Aljazeera felt without a doubt that they had been sent a ""warning"" from the military to ease up. The military later stated that it was an accident and that Aljazeera was warned that "" Baghdad is a dangerous place."" Whether or not this kind of targeting is a legitimate tool is left to the viewer (or reader). Regardless, Aljazeera was obviously in a class unto its own in the world of broadcast news.

Overall, I believe this documentary achieved what it set out to accomplish: to show the true colors of Aljazeera, but to also show that depending on one's perspective, there is a fine line between propaganda and news. There is a fine line between pro-Arabism and anti-Americanism. Who is right and who is wrong? I suppose that depends on what side of world you are on. Regardless, according to this documentary, Aljazeera is far from an objective news organization. While I believe that what they broadcast is true only in the sense that it is not a lie, their material is highly selective and guided in a highly activist manner. But the question remains, is any broadcast news entirely objective? And as the film also showed, that some of the military media-manipulating techniques (more than I've outlined here) were just as guilty as Aljazeera. However, if one is to judge the US disinformation as a legitimate tool during war, then I would suspect Aljazeera might view their tactics as a legitimate tool in their fight to protect Arab interests. Due to the very balanced nature of this documentary, it is left up to the viewer to decide.",1238889600,,8920,4.939373750832778

Important interviews with the head honchos were sincere and heart-felt, often earthy about the necessity to inform. That this film is so highly regarded, I can only believe that it tells the truth. There's a lot of propaganda fed to us Americans, and because of our own network coverage, much isn't reported as it truly is.

2136709,5,B0002X8U4I,"This is a documentary about the 'controversial' (according to the US government and the western media) Arab news channel Al Jazeera.

It consists of filming a number of the senior Al Jazeera news team and following them around. The filming occurred in the lead up and the beginning of the American lead invasion of Iraq (initially described as it's liberation [forgetting that Saddaam Hussein was put into power in a CIA backed coup] by western governments and the western media).

Of particular interest is the 'sparring' that occurs between one of the more 'rotund' members of the Al Jazeera team and the American army propaganda spokesperson. The Al Jazeera person is able to rebutt most of his arguments with authoratative ease.

We are now in the internet age and control of information is becoming more and more difficult. It is all out there, all one has to do is to find it. This film exposes how uncritical the orthodox western media is about 'government authorized material' during war time. The western media is not as objective as it would like to pretend and is complicit in the lies/ommisions that have/have not been circulated about Iraq.

One interesting fact put to bed by the film :

Remember the day when the American troops entered Baghdad? Remember when the statue of Saddam Hussein was pulled down by the US army witnessed by a few hundred jubilant Iraqis? Remember how the orthodox media spent hours showing us this footage live (and on their highlight reels) and mostly ignoring the demonstrations by tens of thousands of Iraqis. The orthodox media reported this as a factual event, whilst on the internet news media this was reported as a fiction - a staged event done to placate the western voters. This film shows how the orthodox media was wrong and the unorthodox internet media correct.

And their reward for all of this? Being 'accidentally' bombed by the US army.

2136710,5,B0002X8U4I,"While there are documentaries about the Iraq War, this may be the most significant one today.

""Control Room"", the documentary covering Al Jazeera, focuses on the station's unbiased and uncensored reporting of the Iraq War. While Al Jazeera shows the brutality taken from American forces, some U.S. stations hear rumors from Central Command that Al Jazeera is showing propaganda. However, as an Al Jazeera reporter points out, there is no objectivity in war. There are two opposing sides, and the American reporters have only interviewed officials from the U.S. military's information bureau, the Central Command. And Central Command has its own agenda.

This is a shocking documentary on a different level. ""Control Room"" shows that there is no mercy in war. Both American and Arab news stations sense something fishy when the U.S. Central Command shows a deck of cards of 52 Iraq officers who are most wanted, but refuses to disclose the deck to the news stations. Censorship is easily imposed in wars, as well as fear. The film forces viewers to question all reporting on the American side, from the color-coded terror levels in newscasts to the ""propaganda"" from Al Jazeera.

The way the documentary was made was very political from the onset, with the montage in the intro paving the way for creating politically motivated spectacles. For instance, the shot of the birds flying in the intro montage was a politically motivated scene, meant to imply anticipation and anxiety over the coming US liberation / invasion. The documentary almost seemed to mimic the political quality if Al-Jazeera, in that shots are judged on their appearance rather than substance.

 Yes, there may be a myth of objectivity, however it is the job of the journalist to attempt to be as objective as possible. Al-Jazeera does have motivations, just as Fox News does, but that does not mean that Al-Jazeera gets a pass on the question of objectivity. The head of Al-Jazeera starts of by saying a military commander should put the media at the top of his priorities; he says that propaganda is a very important weapon in the arsenal. So it is only natural to expect that Al-Jazeera is more of an agenda setter and a propagator, rather than a straight news organization.

 What was evident from the film is that Al-Jazeera does not think of itself as a participant in a war, just an observer. This is not the reality. By broadcasting enemy propaganda, the parade of POW's, Al-Jazeera sets itself up for conflict with coalition forces. Airing pictures of POW's gives ammunition to enemy ambitions, and endangers troops. Al-Jazeera didn't seem to get it, that they are not just a news organization, but also an active participant in the conflict. This is the threat that journalists face when entering a war zone; the threat of being a participant in the war.

 `Control Room' illustrates these points in specific scenes. One of the reports says: ""We lost Baghdad."" I was left asking, who is we? ""We lost Baghdad,"" is the ""we"" some Baathist sympathy, some pan-Arab nationalism, or just plain old anti-Americanism. That reporter is obviously rooting for `our' defeat. Not to say that journalist cant be people with thoughts and feeling, because we certainly have biased reporting here at home, but rather that personal opinions really should be displayed or communicated when reporting events. Even the Al-Jazeera correspondents couldn't manage to muster up a hint of objectivity throughout the film.

 In the age of terrorism the role of the media has come to play a significant role in the outcome of conflicts. In fact, modern terror tactics specifically play to the media. When a bomb goes off in a civilian area, the objective is not tactical but strategic. That is to say that terror bombings are often designed to attract media attention rather than say engage a specific target. The so-called ""propaganda of the deed."" It seems that Al-Jazeera was manipulated back in 2003, used by the enemy to broadcast tactical war propaganda.

 The film also was informative to the editorial decisions that are made at the media outlet. There was one instance that stands out in particular. At one point during the film we see a young boy screaming into the camera. He is screaming about someone being a Baathist, and screaming something akin to death to America if memory serves me. What kind of editorial decision was this? Number one: a screaming emotional kid is not news (he might not realize the consequences of his speech in a wartime), number two: it is very dangerous for that child to be on television making accusations and threats (what if some insurgent recognized this kid), thirdly: its just plain exploitation (going for sensationalism and ignoring the consequences). I fault Al-Jazeera for putting sensationalistic news above the safety of the source.

 Another particular scene stands out as a mimic of the Al-Jazeera style of reporting. When Baghdad is first being bombed the film give the impression that the control room was being shelled. The camera was shaky and the audience is given the impression of panic and being under attack. It was an interesting device that speaks to the creation of spectacles. The control room was obviously not being bombed; Al-Jazeera is in Dubai, not Baghdad. This is subliminal deception on the part of the filmmakers which all too appropriate for a film about Al-Jazeera.

 Conclusively, `Control Room' was a interesting film that needed to made for western audiences. The film gives us a look of the world for a new perspective and makes theses `enemy propagandists' a human quality that is hard to ignore. We see Al-Jazeera as not terrorist sympathizers, but rather frustrated voices coming from a bleak world of strife. Personally, I like have the Arab perspective from Al-Jazzera, it compounds the notion that world is not so black and white and that journalist are not `outside of the event,' but rather active participants in the story.",1178150400,2,5033,4.947867298578199
2136730,5,B0002X8U4I,"This was really eye-opening to me to see beyond the myths that many of us Americans raised on the polemic Fox News have about Al Jazeera.  This documentary shows some of the complexity that Al Jazeera embodies and tries to portray in its newscasts.  You don't see a wholly positive view of the station, but you do appreciate their admirable intent and performance in enlightening people in the Mid-East and around the world.  Despite having some questions as to their judgment about what to put on the news in isolated cases (e.g., certain photos), I felt that in surprising ways it is their commitment to what used to be more in-depth and elucidating Western-style journalism that was so cool.

You see in the documentary the responses of some American journalists to the station as well and learn about the climate of the press in general. I felt as if I got a deeper understanding of the Mid-East climate than I'd get from American news.

Interesting fact: if I heard right recently (2007) in the news, one of the American military journalists interviewed in the film who was originally so skeptical about Al Jazeera's integrity was won over by the facts over time and is now working for them in their American broadcasts.

I think if more people really understood what Al Jazeera does and stands for they might be surprised and would be enlightened by their more substantive coverage of a wider range of international issues than we often see here in the States.",1177632000,,1466,4.751968503937008

I don't have any problem with anti-Americanism, if the objections are based on factual material. There is not a lot of that here. I mean, of course, factual material and not the objections to American military actions.

There was a humorous highlight in this presentation where the young, sort of attractive Arab anchorwoman, or whatever she was, screwed up her face in disbelief and said, "" Where was the Republican Guard?"" That was a good laugh. She said this when the American tanks and troops had entered Baghdad. They also claimed the rejoicing seen in the streets just after the ""liberation"" was staged by the Americans. Their idea is: No one was ever tortured or murdered by Saddam. After an 8 year war with Iran, the Shia brohers are again dancing cheek to cheek. But not to digress.

There were some serious Arab objections worthy to note. There is no question we have wandered off and screwed up yet another war, albeit with the best stated intentions. Sine qua non of all wars, n'est ce pas? [Yawn] We spend more money doing this sort of thing than anyone else.

One of the dramatis personnae is an oily fat, Arab, who seems to think he is the smartest fellow that ever appeared on the planet. He is set against this rather young American Lieutenant. The lieutenant thinks spin in the opposite direction is the way to confront the far out Arab position, and thus balance it. The American lieutenant, representing the army propaganda position, is just young and still a bit naive. He's a decent fellow and you can tell that. The fat Arab is simply an arrogant liar and no more. By the way, the Arab is married to this dumpy Brit person, who listens to his garbage, as if it were holy grail truth. It sort of reminds one of Himmler's wife.

There are other Arabs featured, all with the same warped mindset. Can we spell myopia? To think that is the threat we will have to face in the upcoming years. Ah well, this is just the same old historical tyranny.

There is one more wondrous thing about all this Al Jazeera propaganda in this presentation. They actually believe Bush is the murderer and Saddam is a martyr! I mean tres mervellieux, monsieur all this. I have just one question here for these Arabs and the producers of this thing. Was Hitler a martyr too? Excuse me, rhetorical question. They've already answered that quite clearly and that with supreme confidence. Now that is the truly remarkable thing to ponder here.

One of the other striking moments are when one of the principal cast of this documentary states that despite his hatred for what America has done to his Arab world, he would like his children to take up any opportunity to migrate to America.

2136747,5,B0002X8U4I,"What an absolutely brilliant documentary about the war in Iraq.  I never realized how skewed and one sided journalism can be.  I have much respect for Al-Jazeera and was excited to know that a documentary was being made about them and their take on the War with Iraq.

The film travels back and forth between the stations headquarters in Qatar and CentCom which is the main press briefing room set up by the US military in Iraq. It's a breath of fresh air to see an entire network of people who are smart and committed to the idea of debate and communication. I don't think you could find that at any of the major news networks in the States. Their operations, anecdotes and analysis are worthy of a documentary alone.

But there are specific moments in the film that are especially profound and upsetting.  First and foremost, there is the death of an Al-Jazeera journalist. Before the troops entered Baghdad, the US committed air strikes on civilian targets including the building housing Al-Jazeera. In the attack, one of their correspondents is killed along with three other journalists. There is footage of the journalist facing him head-on right up until seconds before the attack. That along with a plea for justice from the journalist's wife and a completely absurd justification for the attack from the US is both infuriating and literally sickening.

Finally there is the case of Lt. Josh Rushing. Throughout the film, he is the American representative that has debates and discussions with the many Arab journalists. Despite having to take the absurd position of defending US aggression, he is intelligent and empathetic. At one point he becomes self-analytical and candid talking about how he had seen images of dead Iraqi casualties one day and it didn't affect him. The next day, he was footage of American casualties and it made him sick. At that point he really had to face himself and while still in the process at least recognize how much he hates war. That story doesn't end there. With the release of the film, the Pentagon ordered Rushing not to comment on the film. Offended by this gesture, he is now seeking to leave the Marines.

""Control Room"" is a movie about the War with Iraq. But that's not the half of it. It's a movie that will hopefully widen the debate about television and what is objective journalism in this country. It's also another stone catapulted through the wall of Arab stereotypes. It's also an intelligent and engaging film that is as challenging as it is satisfying.",1149379200,6,2513,4.8032407407407405

2136749,3,B0002X8U4I,"While this is not by any means a prize-winning documentary it is still worth seeing because of the perspective gained.  To see the war through Arab/Muslim eyes is what is gained.  It is a bit chilling.  Most of us watched the war through the eyes of CNN or Fox or PBS or one or more of the networks, and we saw a biased view.  The real carnage was withheld from us because it was believed that to show the bleeding and mangled bodies was to (1) inflame opinion (2) give assistance to the enemy.

It was almost impossible for an American news source to present the war as it really was.  No American network executive could do that.  But for Al Jazeera, no such reluctance existed.  And that is the value of this documentary: it allows us to see what our own news media dared not show, although that too was only part of the story.

Filmmaker Jehane Noujaim uses interviews and footage from inside Al Jazeera's ""control room"" and footage from the communications center of the coalition forces to show how the reporters worked.  Reports from the US authorities, Rumsfeld and the generals, the media officers in the field and at the communications center, are contrasted with actual footage and reports from Iraq.  It is clear that the news was managed by both Western services and by Al Jazeera to conform to the expectations and interests of their differing audiences.

Frankly I was surprised that the bias wasn't greater (on both sides).  I came away feeling that, given that modern wars are won or lost to some extent by how well the combatants manage the news, this war within a war was a toss up.  And indeed despite Bush's declaration of victory aboard the aircraft carrier, the war on the ground as it exists today is still very much a toss up.  Coalition forces roared into Iraq and found very little resistance.  And then began the insurgency.  What does it mean to win?  How does one side lose?  As in Vietnam, victory or defeat is to some extent in the eyes of those watching.  In the field there was and is no victory.  There is only carnage.  And so the combatants try to spin the war to their advantage, because it is in the spin that one may find victory regardless of what happens in the field of battle.  In this case, Saddam Hussein and the insurgents had no media.  But the Muslim/Arab world needed such a media, and thereby arose Al Jazeera to spin the other side.  This documentary affords us a quick look at that network.

However I don't think this documentary was very effective.  It lacked focus and continuity.  It seemed hastily thrown together.  We are shone some interviews, some on-camera reportorial and editorial activities, some footage from the field, from Baghdad, from Mosul.  An Al Jazeera reporter is killed by an American missile.  The people at Al Jazeera are deeply saddened and outraged.  They think it was on purpose, to ""punish"" them for reporting what Rumsfeld doesn't want reported, and they may be right; but somehow the loss seems almost trivial compared to the rest of it: the tens of thousands of people dead, the uncounted maimed and wounded, the hundreds of billions of dollars spent like buckets of water poured upon a vast and seething desert.  Somehow the ""news"" of the news reporters themselves seems somewhat irrelevant, almost, I thought, a vanity show.  We have the power to report what happens, they are telling us.  Therefore we have the power to create what happens.

So when I read reviews of this documentary and they lambaste it for being ""one-sided"", I have to shrug and say, ""Yeah, so what news media do you watch?""

Looking at the Ba'athists and other political affiliations within the country was interesting and, again, a bit skewed.

Jordan charged that journalists were deliberately being killed by the U.S. military in Iraq.

During a panel discussion, Jordan said that he believed several of journalists who had been killed during the fighting in Iraq were victims of coalition forces that included American troops who had targeted them. That did it! Soon Jordan was made to recant. Then he was made to resign!
_______________________________________________________

Alas, as ""CONTROL ROOM"" shows, Egyptian-American filmmaker Jehane Noujaim (Startup.com) catches the frantic action at Al-Jazeera headquarters -- as an American fighter jet targets them in their Baghdad hotel room . The deliberate killing of an Al-Jazeera reporter by a targeted air strike is pretty horrifying as captured on film. That filmed sequence alone makes it worthwhile to see CONTROL ROOM.

There's no doubt, someone gave the American fighter jet pilot orders to ""take out"" Al-Jazeera in their Baghdad hotel headquarters. The plane is seen circling the city, and it briefly changes course in a shallow dive, attack mode. Three flashes of light and puffs of smoke signal the pilot had released rockets. As the jet veers off screen, the rockets hit Al-Jazeera's hotel room -- killing one of the reporters who couldn't get out of the way fast enough.

This is, of course, filtered through a very American lens.  It is difficult to say what the reality of the network is without actually being a part of that world or even that network, but ""Control Room"" attempts to bring us that perspective.  We are invited into the world of Al Jazeera where the network producer tells the viewer that it is his job, his passion to have an entirely fair news broadcast that presents different viewpoints and gives voice to those who are willing to speak.  The network has criticized Arab governments and has been officially banned in several nations.  It sounds so democratic.

At the same time the people at the network are talking up Al Jazeera there are clips from speeches and press conferences held by Donald Rumsfeld and President Bush saying that what Al Jazeera is doing is wrong and it isn't balanced and that the network is trying to undermine the war in Iraq (this film was shot in the early days of the US invasion) by showing the violence and aftershocks of the violence and that the network is distorting the truth.  Al Jazeera counters with saying that they are only showing reality and that United States can't have it both ways, to have a war and also to be shown as entirely peaceful.  This is as much of a clash of ideology as it is about the truth in Broadcasting.

The Army's press liaison asks an Al Jazeera newsman if the people at the network can be entirely unbiased and report only the truth with no shadings of interpretation.  The newsman counters by asking if the Americans can do this.  Of course, we know the answer is no.  Fox News and CNN and all of the other channels shade the reports, especially in the early stages, with Pro-American slants.  It is expected, though not truly ""fair"".  I think that the issue the United States officials and military has with Al Jazeera is that it doesn't blindly support the United States and that it does offer differing perspectives and that it does give voice to those the US finds offensive.  Perhaps even the network is Anti-American, though the film does not truly give that opinion.  The perspective the film is showing us is that Al Jazeera is a truly free network and possibly the only truly fair network.  But even that is spin.

This documentary takes a more in-depth and critical view of the american military, government and media than it does of anyone on the other side of the fence. Most of the content is loosely cobbled together from variations on footage you would have already seen enough of on the news, what meager behind-the-scenes footage they were able to get at Al Jazeera since the station never officially granted them co-operation in making the documentary, and a few interesting interview fragments with civilians, reporters, and other officials. The interviews really were by far the most interesting part, and I get the feeling that the filmmakers could have produced a more interesting doco if they just filmed a 90 minute roundtable discussion about the issues with all the main interviewees.

It offers an alternative view of Al Jazeera, one at odds with the ""Mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden"" characterization perpetuated by the Bush administration. Blah blah blah.

The real story here is the transcendent hottietude of Al Jazeera producer Deema Khartib. Her big brown eyes - sparkling pools of liquid intelligence framed by shiny jet-black hair - taunt the viewer from behind sexy-librarian glasses while painfully full lips enounce informed and erudite political opinions through sparklingly white and perfect teeth. And one scene (perhaps overlooked by many but scrutinized repeatedly by your faithful reporter) gives brief but undeniable confirmation of the shapeliness of her posterior flesh pillow as she leaps from her chair and hurries out of a room.

Sure, this is an informative and entertaining documentary. Sure, it's a unsettling look at how our government uses and abuses the media in its war effort. But most importantly, this is a tantalizing, throw-your-pants-around glimpse at a top-shelf twenty-first century Arab hottie, one that underscores the importance of stabilizing Arab world and integrating it into the global community - so that we can have access to their women.",1125792000,,1363,5.276497695852535
2136779,4,B0002X8U4I,"I've got to be honest, I'm a fan of Michael Moore's films. They may be liberal propaganda, but they never fail to stir emotion. Let us, however get one thing straight. This is a far cry from Moore. Where Moore would've shown image after bloody image to coerce you to his POV, this film provides sound analysis of international social issues. In the wake of Fahrenheit 9/11, it's refreshing to see a documentary about the Iraqi War without a political agenda.

Some critics contend that this film is nothing more than another mouthpiece for Muslim radicals, merely a showcase for the more controversial footage from Al-Jazeera. They completely missed the main narrative of the film, which is not stock footage, but documentary exploration of international psyches.

This is a film about two completely different cultures, so different they might as well be from different planets, suddenly thrown together in the loop, by war no less, and expected to get along. The western media defends the Western actions, and Al-Jazeera condemns them.

I liked watching the various people trying to find a middle ground to stand on together, despite their personal biases. After conducting an interview with an American ""political analyst"" who turns out to be some ultraliberal nut, Samir Khader tracks down the man who set the interview up and scolds him. Hasan Ibraham, who mocks American policy every chance he gets, expresses his undying faith in our Constitution: ""The Americans will defeat the Americans."" Lt. Joshua Rushing absolutely loathes the war yet defends its necessity.

The film is bookended by debates between Ibraham and Rushing. Near the film's opening, Ibraham grills the lieutenant about the occupancy of Iraq. Rushing dismisses the interview because Ibraham is a belligerent radical who carries a bias. Over the course of the film he grows to realize that no news is truly objective, that all mews is biased because all people are biased in some way. Fox displays the triumph of victory because Fox feels the victory, just as Al-Jazeera feels the tragedy of Iraq's destruction, a tragedy made that much more real when American planes attacked Al-Jazeera's offices.

Toward the end of the film, Rushing and Ibraham speak again. Watching their discussion, I realized to what extent they were talking about two completely different subjects. Over the course of the conversation, they realize it too and each gains a greater appreciation for the other. The find a common ground in that they are both unable to think from the other side, and they bond, agreeing to share dinner later.

The film's only drawback is that it might be too sober to keep your attention, but this is an extremely concise and accurate look at what's been going on in the world.

And the anchor CRITICIZES the guy who lined up the interview since it was a ridiculous waste of airtime.

I recommend this dvd. But for the humanizing of the Al Jazeera employees and the Centcom spokesman. NOT for the experience of seeing the programming of Al Jazeera.

I've shown this documentary in entry-level classes to mostly college freshman and most seem to come away with a greater understanding of what type of media they consume.  I've received comments that suggests to me this film can have a profound impact on those who watch it.  For that, this film is very valuable.  Most people, I think would benefit from watching it.

The most optimistic part of the film includes the portions with a young U.S. soldier that appeared to be working behind the lines in some administrative function.  You get to listen to his conversations with Arab journalists and hear how the two sides interact.  It's a vastly positive exchange.  It makes me feel more hopeful that things will eventually be ok in Iraq.  Watch this film and try be more like the young soldier.",1121904000,2,1113,4.75
2136782,4,B0002X8U4I,"Al Jazeera is a communication network that broadcasts its messages to the Arab world from its home base in Saudi Arabia. Since the U.S. invasion of Iraq, this network has enjoyed greater publicity and has increased its following largely because of its outspoken opposition to the war. This documentary takes the viewer on a trip inside this controversial communications operation and lets you see what goes on behind the scenes.

Many people operate this network operation and the vast majority f them have a decidedly anti- American bias. This isn't because of any inherent disliking of Americans, it's because of the U.S. led invasion in Iraq. The different members of this business come forward on the documentary and openly express their opposition to this U.S. led war, stating their opinions on the unethical foundation of the war, the hypocrisy, and the false pretenses that led an arrogant nation to forcibly change the leadership of a foreign country.

What I like best about this documentary is the bluntness of the people on the screen. They hold back nothing when they express their collective outrage and while some of them make statements that seem a little nave, others make comments that are intelligent and thought- provoking. They vow to continue to tell people the other side of the story so that the world will know exactly what takes place each day as the U.S. and allied forces battle for political control in Iraq.

Some of the scenes in this documentary are gruesome, with bloodied bodies lying dead in plain view; open wounds on the bodies of young children; and other nasty stuff. Of course, the Al Jazeera network intends it this way. They want the world to see the brutality of war, up close and personal.

Al Jazeera is an anti- war operation and its members are quite vocal in their opposition to Bush, the United States, and other countries who have chosen to fight in the Iraqi conflict. The documentary is very biased, which is ironic when you consider that the mission of Al Jazeera is to expose the propaganda of the U.S. and other countries. But ""Control Room"" is still a good documentary to watch. It's nice to see and hear some information from the other side rather than be blasted day after day with pro- war sentiments from the U.S. media and pro- war propaganda from the U.S. military.",1119830400,6,2327,4.81

The movie spent quite some time on the interaction between U.S. Marine press spokesman, Lt. Josh Rushing, and an Al Jazeera producer named Hassan Ibrahim, which I believe are the most interesting part of the movie. It represented two educated people, with vastly different views on the war, trying to reach out to the other party in the very hope that someday we might shake hands instead of exchanging bullets. They represented our best hope for a better tomorrow, even if we can't avoid wars altogether.

2136785,5,B0002X8U4I,"Control Room displays Al Jazeera's Satellite Channel importance in the Middle East as forty million Arab viewers watch this new station, which also makes it one of the most important news stations in the Middle East.  It has been pushing controversial topics to its viewers.  In fact, many of these news shows have been so progressive that they critiqued some regimes, which have lead them to become banned in some Arab countries.  Nonetheless, they continue to air both sides of the news, as many of their employees hope for a better future in the Middle East.

In March 2003, President George W. Bush declared war on Iraq on the basis that his administration suspected that they had weapons of mass destruction that could potentially be used against the United States.  Before the war began the United State set up a military headquarters called Central Command in the Middle East, which is located outside Doha, Qatar.  At this Central Command most news networks could get the United States' version of how things progressed in the war, which naturally provided an American biased view.  Nonetheless, Al Jazeera was present and tried to get the information in the American light.

Simultaneously with the news from the Command Center, Al Jazeera had people located in Baghdad, Mosul, and Basra in order to get the Iraqi view on the war.  Through the war they received shots of civilians being killed to which Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld disputed as propaganda and deceitful lies.  When Al Jazeera aired shots of captured American POW's many Americans were heated with hatred towards Al Jazeera and the Muslim world, yet no other news station displayed the opposite side of the war.  Despite what was right or wrong, Al Jazeera aired this, which fueled the rage on both sides.  The press officer Lieutenant Josh Rushing offers the best two sided explanation to the violence in Iraq.  He comments to how he reacted with revulsion to the killed American soldiers that were filmed by Al Jazeera and how nonchalant he felt after having seen Al Jazeera's film of the mayhem after one of the American bombings that accidentally harmed and killed civilians.  To this Lt. Rushing stated, ""It makes me hate war.""

This documentary displays the good and bad while telling the truth of both sides, and how it affects people on both sides.  It is truly a tragic story, yet, it offers a profound insight into how it could be to be on the other side.  One should also consider the fact that United States has had freedom of speech for over 200 years while in the Middle East this is still a new concept that they are trying to grasp.  To expect change overnight is to close the eyes to the 200 years of history in the United States that has been full of injustice and trespasses in regards to these freedoms through prejudice and hatred.  The Middle East might have to go through their own 200 years before true freedom for all is to be expected.",1117497600,8,2943,4.7578740157480315

2136787,4,B0002X8U4I,"In ""Living Room Wars,"" author David D. Perlmutter, a senior fellow of the Reilly Center for Media and Public affairs, claims that the ""pretense that we are better informed than ever in history about wars in distant lands is the big lie in the television age.""  We live in the most powerful country in the world with the most powerful military.  However, we have no true understanding of what war really is because we have the benefit of not having to experience it.  Our relationship to war is completely mediated by the major media corporations in the United States.  What makes ""Control Room"" worth seeing is that it allows Americans to see another point of view in the Iraq War.

 ""Control Room"" helps us to see the Iraq War from the perspective of the Al Jazeera Satellite Network, a controversial, popular Arab news network.  The main point of the documentary is not to convince viewers that American intervention in Iraq is right or wrong, but instead to get people thinking about the role of the media in shaping our perception and understanding of the Iraq War and whether our opinion is justified based on correct evidence or not.  It is no hidden secret that the media, if manipulated correctly, can be a powerful weapon in war.  The beginning of the documentary opens with a candid shot of an Al Jazeera Network executive saying that war cannot be waged without the media and that the media should be on the top of the military agenda.  Perlmutter also agrees that because of the prevalence of the television, ""the military could no longer completely ignore or completely censor the press, yet they would wage war under the assumption that the battle to control the content and captioning of TV pictures was decisive as campaigns in the air, sea, and land.""

One of the most shocking examples of the power of the media in the documentary was when the US bombed the headquarters of Al Jazeera and another Iraqi television news networks which resulted in the death of one of an Al Jazeera reporter.  After the Al Jazeera headquarters was bombed the reporters who worked for them were forced to leave wherever they were because the Iraqi people thought they were ""targeted"" by the US military and did not want to be put in danger by aiding an American enemy.  Obviously, the US military viewed Al Jazeera as a threat or it wouldn't have bombed them in the middle of the city.  A US military official said the US spends massive amounts of money to buy precision bombs so they don't make mistakes on what they're bombing.  The day after the bombing took place, there were native villagers who gathered to celebrate the liberation of Baghdad.  However, interviews with Al Jazeera correspondents suggest that the whole celebration was staged by the US military in order to spur American nationalism.  Only the foreign press was there to cover the event because Al Jazeera was forced to leave.  This is a powerful example showing how the management of the media can be used fight wars.

The images that we tend to see on TV in America are, as Perlmutter says, ""limited, homogenous, and leave out much of the panorama of war.""  ""Control Room"" reinforces that idea.  Seeing clips from Al Jazeera television stations left me feeling more informed about the war.  In the American media, the most we see of war tend to be images of liberation or of tanks rolling across empty land.  On Al Jazeera, American troops are seeing busting through people's doors, cussing, and threatening them with guns.  That probably happens on a regular basis.  War is brutal, but the American media censors those images out and accuses the networks who don't of showing enemy propaganda.

However, this is not to say that Al Jazeera is without bias.  Each channel caters to their own demographics nationalism.  However, as an American, I find myself at a loss trying to understand how we can pride ourselves on spreading democracy and freedoms that come along with that (including freedom of speech), yet exercise such control not only over our own media but the media of the countries we are trying to spread that democracy to as well.

The most refreshing (when I say refreshing, I don't necessarily mean pleasant) about ""Control Room"" is its subtly.  ""Control Room"" engages audiences instead of repulsing them with an over the top opinionated documentary.  Perlmutter says one of the dangers about the visual media is that the ""words can say one thing, but the pictures could be almost anything.""  Part of the beauty of ""Control Room"" is that there is no narration and there are no fancy visual effects.  The simple way the documentary was filmed made me feel as if I were right there watching all of the interviews take place.  The interviews felt real instead of staged and rehearsed.  The director leaves a lot of room for viewer interpretation and opinion.  I didn't walk away from the film feeling like I had just been told what's right and what's wrong.  Whether you are pro-war or anti-war, you can find something to appreciate in the film.",1116028800,5,5029,4.7589388696655135

Jehane Noujaim directed the fantastic documentary Startup.com and in Control room Noujaim continues to enlighten and inform. Many other reviewers have laid out the plot and the specific elements so I won't go into them here. I will say that films like this which show how the American media is tightly linked to governmental agendas should be required viewing on all college campuses. In fact, they should be made available to all US citizens. The media in many other countries is state controlled; a dangerous state of affairs, however, America prides itself on its freedom of speech. This is a fiction that lulls us into a sense of superiority. Control Room shows how powerful governments such as ours seek to control the images and content not only of its own media but also the media of other countries.

2136789,5,B0002X8U4I,"During the second Gulf War the Arab news network Al Jazeera managed to be denounced by both American Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Iraqi Information Minister Muhammed Saeed al-Sahaf.  In some quarters this would be taken as evidence they must have been doing something right, but seeing Al Jazeera as being anything other than right or wrong has been difficult enough that the 2004 documentary ""Control Room"" is worth seeing.  Before this you have probably heard about what the American government and television networks have had to say about Al Jazeera, so letting its producers and reporters talk for themselves is pretty interesting especially if all you really know about Al Jazeera is that they run tapes by Al Queda and showed film of hostages, wounded children, and corpses during the war with Irqai.

""Control Room"" was made by Jehane Noujaim, an Arab-American documentarian who previously made ""Startup.com.""  The director's presence in this film consists of title cards and editing instead of over narration or commentary (the film is in English and Arabic with Arabic subtitles).  The focus is on how the Arab satellite news channel about other networks covered the early days of the war in Iraq and the style is certainly much more that of the spectator than the involved advocate (to wit, this ain't Michael Moore).  The result is that there is ample evidence Al Jazeera is more of a news network where they speak Arabic than an instrument of propaganda.

If, for the sake of argument, the Watergate scandal represents the high point of journalism, then things have certainly slipped.  When ABC's ""Primetime Live"" did an hour-long expose on FOX's ""American Idol"" and the claims of Corey Clark that he had an inappropriate relationship with Paula Abdul, one of the show's judges was this a quest for the truth or a chance to take down another network's highest rated show a peg or too in the Nielsen ratings?  Those who have seen the documentary ""Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism"" will have an interesting choice as to where to start throwing stones first when it comes to issues of journalistic standard and integrity (and there is no end to the list of where to throw those stones).  The simple reality might be that it is no longer possible to tell who is standing on your side of the looking glass, the politicians or the reporters.

That being said, what emerges here are a group of individuals, most of who are producers for Al Jazeera.  Hassan Ibrahim is an articulate man who continually makes points about how what is being shown on television plays to the Arab audience.  Deema Khatib is even more articulate Arab Woman who embodies the Arab perspective of the network.  Yes, there is a scene where she expresses disbelief that ""we"" lost Baghdad, but if you get to the deleted scenes she talks about how she wants to see the Arabs get rid of the Sadaam Husseins of the region, but she wants to see it done without outsiders accomplishing it (there are dozens of deleted scenes, consisting mostly of interview clips with these individuals).  Samir Kahder, a senior producer, is the one who responds to Rumsfeld's attacks by explaining that the network showed images of Iraqi civilians killed by U.S. bombs because they wanted to show the human cost of war.  If there is one strength to this documentary it is that you will understand Al Jazeera's perspective, even if you disagree or even detest it.  Yes, there are elements here that are critical of specific actions of the American military during the war, but we do not need Al Jazeera to tell us that was the case.

Ironically, the key figure to emerge from the documentary is Lt. Josh Rushing, a Marine office assigned at Central Command to talk to reporters.  Rushing become important not because he is an American in a documentary largely about Arab television journalists, but because he has the most important epiphany.  Outraged by film on Al Jazeera of the corpses of American soldiers, Rushing notes that similar footage of dead Iraqis did not keep him from going off to dinner.  Rushing comes to the conclusion that Arabs watching these images on television would probably feel the same way about the latter as he did about the former.  This does not change Rushing's views about the war, but it underscores what is the most important lesson of ""Control Room,"" which is to simply understand a different point of view.  Even if you reject it, at least understand it first.  Fortunately, ""Control Room"" helps us do that.",1115251200,4,4526,4.848051948051948
2136790,4,B0002X8U4I,"I was introduced to The Control Room Saturday evening on April 16th, 2005. My first impression of it was stereotypical, ""oh lord, another war movie."" I had seen it all: 9/11, CNN and NBC news. However, I realized that I had never seen it from an Iraqi civilian's point of view. In this film you will encounter the dead bodies of American troops that have never been exposed. You will be surprised to know how badly America took advantage of the Geneva Convention. The Control Room guides you towards the truth. The American media did their job, they gave us information on what we wanted to hear. But what about the details we did not want to hear, but should have?

I learned the most on this subject when American troops were giving interviews with the news reporters in Iraq. On March 23rd, 2003 Australia's ABS news covered evidence of America's anger with the Iraqi media. ""The Bush Administration has expressed its anger over the release of pictures of slain US soldiers and prisoners of war being questioned by their Iraqi captors. The troops were part of a US maintenance unit and were surprised by Iraqi forces north of Nasiriyah. US networks have bowed to a Pentagon request not to broadcast the images which are now being played throughout the Arab world."" Iraq's reporters addressed the troops with questions such as, ""why are you here in Iraq? What is your purpose?"" the troops replied in confusion with, ""I'm just following orders.""

Go on a limb and see where the fruit is. The Control Room will impact your views on the American media. Some highlights of the film were those of Iraqi's beliefs on where we receive our money from. According to them, we receive our money from their country, Kuwait and other businesses that they are in control of. I saw many good along with bad points in this particular film.

I certainly recommend this movie to you if you appreciate diversity in truth. The results of my beliefs based on Iraq and the American people have changed yet again. I now know that The Control Room was completely one sided from an American point of view. This was about a propaganda war.",1114646400,2,2115,4.664879356568365
2136791,5,B0002X8U4I,"""Control Room"" is a documentary about the Arab news channel, Al Jazeera, and its reporting during the 2003 war with Iraq. Al Jazeera is often considered anti-US, anti-Israel and a mouthpiece for the likes of Osama Bin Laden.  A contrary view is that Al Jazeera is the first independent, unfettered, professional news channel of the Arab world.

""Control Room"" looks at the Iraq war through the eyes of several Al Jazeera journalists.  That they are distressed by the easy US conquest of Iraq and the failings of the Arab world is obvious, but they are also human, cynical, and occasionally amusing.  By contrast the U.S. military and political figures in the movie appear robotic, with the exception of the young Marine, Lt. Josh Rushing, who at least grasps for reality.  ""Control Room"" tilts toward the Al Jazeera anti-war view, but all in all it's probably more fair and balanced than the coverage of the war by the US networks, which was uninformed, jingoistic, and stage-managed.  Truth - or at least information - was more likely to be found on Al Jazeera.  (That's an opinion based on being in the region before, during, and after the Iraq War.  If you wanted news you turned to Al Jazeera; if you wanted the US official line or a rehash and reinterpretation of what Al Jazeera had already told and showed you, you turned to the US networks or BBC.)

The most powerful part of the film is the story of the alleged targeting of Al Jazeera's Baghdad headquarters by US warplanes and the killing of an Al Jazeera journalist.  Also, powerful are the pictures of Iraqi and American casualties of the war - rarely shown on U.S. news programs and Lt. Rushing's tortured, but honest, explanation of his reaction to Al Jazeera's broadcast of pictures of American casualties.  (Rushing apparently lost his job in the Marines as a result of his statements in this film, some of which are, heaven-forbid, introspective.)

See this movie.  Like it or not, all Americans should be exposed to contrary opinions.  It's called democracy, isn't it?

2136792,4,B0002X8U4I,"This is a documentary on the Al Jazeerah reportage of the American invasion of Iraq it covers about 20 days of that conflict. The gulf war was a tightly managed media event with the Americans placing journalists with combat units and managing the news by supplying them with selective positive images to feed to the world. Al Jazeerah appears to have adopted a more questioning line by releasing material showing some interviews with captured American troops and also civilian casualties.

The film consists of a number of interviews, shots of the war and filmed interchanges between American army media liaison units and employees of the network. The film has a certain amount of poignancy as one of the journalists who worked for the station and appears in the early scenes was killed.  The death of this journalist attracted a lot of attention as it was speculated that the fire that killed him was due to American concern about the activities of the network. This was denied by the Americans who said that the incident was related to returning fire from the building in which the network office was located.

In general the feel of the film is not so much one of direct anti Americanism but cynicism. Most of the staff of the network are not supporters of Saddam but are motivated by a general cynicism about the American media managing of the war and the underlying motivation. In one exchange a journalist suggests that no one particularly mourns Saddam but there is a feeling of unease about the fact that Bagdad is occupied by American tanks. One of the better parts of the film is the revelation that the famous pulling down of one of Saddam's statues was a contrived media stunt rather than a genuine outpouring of popular feeling. The camera angles shown by Al Jazeerah show that there was no crowd just a few people in civilian clothes heavily guarded by American tanks. One of the commentators makes the comments that the "" Iraquis"" appear not to be speaking with correct accents and comments in the absence of women and children from the event.

The film is reasonably polemical and its main device is to have a number of reporters from the network discuss and debate matters with an American lieutenant who works as a media officer. The lieutenant is clearly intelligent and articulate but is unbelievably insular and has little understanding or knowledge of any culture that is not his own. The impression that one comes away with from the film is not so much that the war was the product of a malevolent impulse but rather it arose out of and was conducted a blinkered vision.",1111363200,4,2593,4.74279379157428
2136793,5,B0002X8U4I,"The documentary ""Control Room"" is a behind-the-scenes look at al-Jazeera, the largest all-news Arabic television station. Al-Jazeera was formed in 1996, and its office is located in Qatar. Since the beginning of the Iraqi war, the number of al-Jazeera's viewers has doubled. In other words, if you are an Arab, and you are watching footage of the war, there's an excellent chance that you are watching al-Jazeera's coverage. The film's main focus is al-Jazeera's coverage of the Iraqi war, and the film begins in 3/03 with Bush's televised announcement that Saddam Hussein and his sons need to leave Iraq--or else.

Curiously enough, Qatar is also the base of operations for the U.S. Central-Command (Cen-Com), and right next door is the Coalition Media Centre. Qatar is located about 700 miles from Baghdad, and all of the major news stations have offices inside the Coalition Media Centre. Some of the film's footage shows reporters from various stations summoned for press releases that are delivered by a military officer. The film illustrates the frustrations felt by the reporters who gather in one room to get the low-down on the news that is taking place hundreds of miles away. For example--one of the announcements concerns a pack of cards--featuring America's 'most wanted' Iraqis. The reporters are eager to look at the pack and identify the villains, but there's a catch. There's only one pack of cards in Cen-Com, and although the general offered to let the journalists take a look at them when he flashed them at the news conference, bottom line--the general won't part with his pack of cards--even though a horde of journalists crowd around his office and demand a look.

Spokesperson, Marine Lt. Josh Rushing presents an earnest, human face to the al-Jazeera reporters and to the world. He confesses that he found the footage of the American military dead aired by al-Jazeera very distressing, but at the same time, he realizes that his reactions to the footage of the Iraqi dead failed to cause such an emotional reaction. From this observation, Lt. Rushing comprehends that Arabs observing footage of their dead are just as distressed as he is when he sees dead Americans.

As for al-Jazeera, ""the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden"" (according to the Bush administration), they are not content to show the war through a system of press releases. They air footage of bodies--some severely wounded children, flattened buildings, and Iraqis screaming their grief at the camera. These scenes are the reality of war. People die. But in America, an entirely different picture is painted. The American media's presentation is, as Deema Khatib, an al-Jazeera producer comments ""like an American movie."" Rumsfeld accuses al-Jazeera of faking photos of the wounded. According to Rumsfeld, when they know a bomb is about to hit ""they grab some children and some women and pretend the bomb hit the women and children."" Al-Jazeera responds to charges that they incite the Arab world with photos of the dead and wounded by saying:
""war has a human cost."" Just what are the ethics of showing the footage of the casualties of war? Should the media sanitize the war and serve it up in a series of carefully orchestrated photo-op moments (like the majority of the American Press)? Is al-Jazeera inciting the Arab world by showing the footage of the dead and wounded, or is al-Jazeera morally obligated to show these gruesome images to the world?

This eye-opening documentary includes moment of shames when an al-Jazeera reporter is killed in what appears to be a deliberate targeting by an American bomber. Another shocking element of the documentary is the way in which the al-Jazeera reporters catch things that the Americans reporters don't. Scenes of the invasion of Baghdad, the toppling of Sadaam's statue, the Kurds destroying money, and children chanting hate messages to Bush are all subject to vitally different interpretations. In other words--what we see here in America is not what the Arab world sees, and furthermore we so often interpret things incorrectly simply because we do not understand. Similarly, just as Lt. Rushing insists that Palestine and Iraq are two different things, al-Jazeera reporter, Hassan Ibrahim tries to explain the two conflicts are tied in the Arab world. Can we ever understand the Arab point of view, or are we simply not interested in understanding it?

""Control Room"" is a fascinating glimpse at a world that we rarely see. Al-Jazeera is full of dedicated journalists--some in traditional clothing, and some very Westernized (I noticed that none of those in traditional dress spoke to the cameras). If you are interested in the role of the media in this war, or the ethics of journalism, I recommend watching the excellent documentary ""Control Room""--displacedhuman",1107561600,9,4809,5.097715736040609
2136804,5,B0002X8U4I,"Having spent a bit of time in the Middle East myself I found the representation of the channel quite adequate. Indeed, nothing is taboo for Al Jazeerah and often it is a thorn in the eye of the Arab leaders. Al Jazeerah is not afraid to shine a critical light on everything from American Imperialism to the corrupt house of Saud to Syrian oppression.

I am not sure about the count of viewers that the channel reaches but there was not one home in the Middle East that I visited that did not have access to it. Albeit a satellite channel one needs to keep in mind that literally all Arab households use satellite reception.

Watching Al Jazeerah is fascinating. For a U.S. citizen who is used to sanitized hypocritical abstract talking-head news blurbs carefully avoiding upsetting the corporate sponsorship, Al Jazeerah is raw. If CNN is Barry Manilow then Al Jazeerah is Motorhead.

Besides relating the rush of real news coverage (as opposed to the regurgitation of military propaganda exercized by the U.S. corporate media) the DVD was fair if you took the time and watched the extras which featured specific individuals appearing in the movie. It made an attempt to tell all sides of the story.

It is saddening that Lt. Josh Rushing, the express sympathetic U.S. military press liason (who appeared to sincerely believe in what he spoke no matter how one would judge its truthfulness) lost his job over the film (He appeared later on Pacifica Station Democracy Now! to tell his story).

Al Jazeerah broadcasts very few commercials and is primarily financed by one of the leading elite in Qatar (not quite sure how  and why). The film failed to explore this matter.

Still, by some it is considered as too moderate. Recently it has received competition by a new mega news channel called Al Arabiya.

The film is sure to be an eye-opener for an American audience that associates the Arab world with Ben Hur or gun-toting hooded Hamas. Al Jazeerah employs some of the sharpest, most intellectual minds I have run across.

2136809,3,B0002X8U4I,"I liked seeing the human faces and life stories behind the personalities at Al-Jazeera, but I saw a such a homogenous Arab interpretation of world events in that studio that it's unlikely they'll ever report a story the same way we would in the West.  They believe passionately in the news business, and they've done some compelling reports on several topics--including corruption within Arab regimes-- but their disproportionate coverage of Israeli ""massacres""  and America's ""zionist-inspired occupation of the region"" gets old after a while.  I don't agree that they're a mouthpiece for Al-Qaida, but they have an unwavering point of view which colors their reporting of the news.  You could say the same about Fox News, too, but understand there are a dozen networks and cable news channels in the United States, providing a healthy diversity of opinion and reporting.  In the mideast, Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya are pretty much it, and Al-Jazeera dominates.  Therefore, to the majority of Arab viewers, what they see on Al-Jazeera must be true.

Kudos to Jehane Noujaim for not narrating--and thus editorializing--the film.  She took a careful neutral stance, gave sufficient air time to the US military press officer, and let Al-Jazeera's people speak for themselves.  In the end, though, I was left wanting more.  I won't comment on the right or wrong of the US invasion of Iraq, but I've seen enough of Al-Jazeera in this documentary to know that they'll look the other way when Arab citizens commit atrocities.  CBS didn't when it broke the story of America's abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib.

Bottom line, Al-Jazeera is an ambitious, hard-working news outlet, but they fail to provide that news with any meaningful context or opposing viewpoints.  This documentary only reinforces that opinion.",1104537600,11,1804,5.179310344827586

Obviously tilted away from the American cause, Al jazeera treads dangerously close to, if not beyond, the fine line of responsible journalism as they actually try to influence the outcome of the conflict as opposed to just covering it. Most memorable is the absolute state of dis-belief and defeat in the Al Jazerra network control room as they watch the Americans roll into Baghdad and famously topple the statue of Sadam Hussein.

2136811,4,B0002X8U4I,"Since September 11th, we have heard a lot about al-Jazeera. To some, they are a radical and admirable group of journalists who is bringing the concept of a free press to a geographic region that has never known it. To others, they are a hate filled, propoganda spewing, anti-American network that doesn't practice news so much as skewed drivel. Who is right? The answer, as Control Room demonstrates, might not be cut and dry.

This is a film with no narrator and no commentary. It is billed as not having a partisan agenda, and while it spends much of its time covering al-Jazeera in action, I found that it was truly a fair film. What the film is 'about' is covering al-Jazeera covering the Iraq war. Of course, al-Jazeera gets a radically different picture of the war than we do (as the war is being fought in their, not our, backyard). And like any good journalists, the pictures they see dictate the story they tell.

Interspersed with this, we are also able to see the struggle that media officials at cent-com (which one journalis in the film suggests sounds too much like 'sitcom') to get the American point of view across to the Arab population in an attempt to provide counterpoint to al-Jazeera.

In showing all of this, this film does a great job at showing exactly how much the Middle-Eastern and U.S. perspectives differ and also how modern wars must play the PR battle as much as the field battle. In quite a few scenes, it becomes evident that the media battle is not over 'truth vs. falsehood.' Both US and Arab media are reporting facts. Rather the question is WHICH facts each reports, HOW each network reports these facts, and WHAT they exclude.

For those used to documentaries like 'Farenheit 9/11' that not only offer the 'answers' to you but entertain you while it does, this film might not be for you. It is not really that entertaining, and makes no pretense at giving any answers. Even the last scene ends abruptly without warning or explanation.

2136812,5,B0002X8U4I,"This movie is an excellent analysis of the war in Iraq. After watching the Charlie Rose show in which he interviewed Jehane Noujaim I was very interested in watching this movie. This movie shows the war in Iraq from a different perspective, from the Arab perspective and the Al-Jazeera television perspective.

This movie is a documentary which tells you the truth about the war in Iraq. It challenges you to open up your mind to what is really going on and to ignore for a second all the propaganda you've been watching on American TV and from the administration. There are many interesting interviews in this movie.

Control Room shows how Al-Jazeera broadcasts the war in Iraq to over 40 million people in the Middle East. It's ironic that people like Rumsfeld say that Al-Jazeera spread lies because Rumsfeld and his gang are hypocrites who claim that they are bringing ""freedom"" to the Iraqis. There are many unique characters in this movie, my favorite being an African man who often has humorous yet true comments about the war. The Americans claim that the Arabs are showing the war in a negative light, when they are really just showing what is actually happening-civilians being slaughtered and violence being perpetrated.

2136834,5,B0002X8U4I,"This award winning 2003 documentary tells the story of the war in Iraq from the point of view of Al Jazeera, the television network that brings the news to 40 million people in the Arab-speaking world. Many of the challenges it faces are shared by journalists everywhere.  They risk their lives to bring a story to the people.  And they are all under pressure to spin the story to their employers' wishes.

The viewer meets the people who produce this news network.  There's the director Samir Khader, the chain smoking and cynical head of the organization.  He freely admits he'd be willing to work for Fox News if offered the job and wants to send his children to America for their educations.  There's Hassan Ibrahim, a former BBC correspondent.  He's a well-spoken pudgy man with a clear mind, who sees the world through a slightly different filter that I do.  And a lot of what he says makes sense challenging my perceptions on a very human level.  There's Deema Khatib, one of the Al Jazeera staff members, whose playful expressive large brown eyes sparkle with a great sense of humor, She's unveiled and modern and obviously well educated.  Then there is Lieutenant Josh Rushing, who clearly is doing his best to explain U.S. policy.  He's blue eyed and personable and very American and has a calm demeanor and a high intellect.  His interchanges with Al Jazeera personnel show a depth of understanding for all sides of the question.  And yet he is steadfast in his support of America.

The film begins in March 2003 as American troops invade Iraq. Al Jazeera shows pictures of the casualties.  The American news media does not.  Al Jazeera is fast to point out some troubling realities of American foreign policy.  And, in this documentary at least, it attempts show that its news coverage is fair and balanced.  But then, again, isn't that what they all say?

This film made me think.

And what made me think even more were the special features included on the DVD which show more interviews with the subjects of the film and adds a bit of humanity to them all, including the American Lieutenant who has the hard job of trying to placate all sides.

The situation in the world today is complex.  I came away with more insight into its depths.  There are no real answers.  Only serious questions.

Washington D.C. has been attacked by an invading army.  After intense bombing and thousands of civilian deaths, our nation's Capital is occupied and our government overthrown.  Now, I wonder how unbiased the western press would be in this situation. What is unbiased in this situation?

After watching Control Room, I find Al Jazeera's coverage of this invasion to be far superior to that of any western network.  Why?  Because they are actually covering it.  What the hell happened to the media in this country?  They have lost their backbone.  They have been completely emasculated by corporate interests.  Thirty years ago, the U.S. media helped to stop the unjust war in Vietnam, not with propoganda, but with ACTUAL reporting, primarily with their cameras.  If the American media showed the real human cost of this war, as Al Jazeera does, then the American people would not stand for the criminal actions of the Bush administration.  Some Americans may think it ironic that some Arab press is more free than their own.

The FACT that the U.S. military purposely targeted foreign journalists is absolutely disgusting.  What is more disgusting is the American public's complete indifference.  This kind of intimidation is inexcusable - reprehensible!  Whomever was responsible for this should be severely punished.

The right-wingers will say that this movie is propaganda, as they did with Michael Moore's film.  Don't believe a word.

These non-religious Arabs paradoxically enjoy the benefits of Western Civilization while holding it in utter contempt.  Islamic fundamentalism doesn't even slightly interest them.  The vast majority attended school in the despised occidental countries.  They are the intellectual disciples of ultra-leftists Noam Chomsky and Edward Said. Truth does not exist and everything is relative.  The very concept of objectivity is a supposed fiction employed to deceive the dispossessed of the earth.  Saddam Hussein may have been a monster who enslaved and tortured his people---but he is still an Arab leader.  The reporters of Al-Jazeera have a difficult time cheering on the coalition soldiers who are about to liberate Iraq.  One woman even blurts out that she doesn't know who to favor in the conflict.  Bitterness and envy best explains their attitude.  The Arab world is today a third rate power.  Little remains of its dominance of some five hundred years ago.  Existential anguish and self pity underpins the mindset of Al-Jazeera's editorial policy and news reporting.

Control Room is a must see documentary.  It is necessary to view our enemies up close and personal.  And yes, Al-Jazeera is a foe of all that is good and decent.  This news organization will continue to do much harm until its employees overcome their inferiority complex.  Ataturk warned the Arab world that there is little sense in competing against the West.

They apparently do not feel a responsibility to 'spin' the news or filter what they show in order to support any viewpoint, even if the content is disturbing.  With them all information is news, regardless of viewpoint or origin.  They have invited American commanders to speak on the air, as well as Iraqi defense ministers.  Madmen as well as the reasonable. To them it's all news.

In so doing, they have angered both the US administration and their own Arabic audience because they refuse to bow to pressure from either side to draw conclusions or make value judgments.  They simply present the available facts and let the audience make up their own minds.

I've seen the movie twice in theatres and purchased the DVD so I could share it with others who missed it.  I was surprised to see the level of extras in the DVD, outstanding job!

The DVD contains the movie shown in the theatre, plus has three additional commentary audio tracks: 1) normal movie audio, 2) commentary by the producer and cinematographer, 3) commentary by Marine Captain Josh Rushing (recorded after the movie was made), and 4) commentary by two Al Jazeera news producers.

There is also a large amount of additional interviews/footage that didn't make it into the original movie.  Subtitles are available in English, Arabic, French, Spanish. Wow

One of the things I really, really liked about this documentary is that it isn't out from the get go to demonize anyone.  The vast majority of the people portrayed in the film (US military press core, western news media, arab news media, etc.) come across as basically well intentioned people with very different perspectives of what is going on and what needs to be done, different cultural understandings, etc.

The different audio commentary tracks also promote more food for thought from the sometimes very different perspectives of the various commentators.  When was the last time you saw a movie with audio commentary from a U.S. Marine Captain and another audio commentary with Al Jazeera producers?

The best documentary DVD I've ever seen.  One of the best overall movies I've seen in the last few years, documentary or otherwise.

This important movie will be viewed many times in the future, long after the war and political disputes have moved on...

However, the words and actions taken against al Jazeera by Donald Rumsfeld and the military brass will leave you with a very bitter taste.  Once again it shows how American leaders utterly fail to understand the complexity of the Arab world and resort to the same tired propaganda in presenting their case.  Al Jazeera tried to cut through it, and this documentary gives you a rare glimpse into the independent mind of this Arab news network that has put the Western media to shame in the coverage of the war in Iraq.

Al Jazeera has shown what the military didn't want US audiences to see, ranging from the civilian dead to 5 American POW's.  The documentary focuses mostly on media perception and the spin room that the Central Command of military operations became during the invasion of Iraq.

2136842,5,B0002X8U4I,"Unfortunately, it's prelude to a war and all its atrocities that gives us an in depth and informative look at the Al-Jazeera television network and the attitudes towards America from the Arab world.

There are a number of characters and events in this documentary that will invoke a variety of feelings including sadness, affection, pity, and rage. Although the context of the documentary is the media coverage of a war, there are still some moments of humor. I chuckled during some segments and came close to crying on others. The emotional intensity is high.

The allegation of the 'staging' of the crowd toppling over the statue of Saddam Hussein should make you think about just how far perceptions can be swayed by those in power manipulating news broadcasts and visual images. It also makes one more critical of believing something to be a ""truth"", just because we saw it on a television news program.

The killing of an Al-Jazeera reporter in one of the first ""shock and awe"" blasts rightfully creates great sadness and tension among those interviewed from the Al Jazeera station. You can also understand how hard 'objective' reporting from the remaining staff at Al-Jazeera must be after that incident.

The much larger question always remains if ""objective"" reporting is possible at all. Chances are, if both sides of a controversial issue are irritated with the media coverage, the reporting is being done as objectively and effectively as possible. The truth is often very hard to swallow from both sides.

The notion of banning certain graphic war images on American news broadcasts also makes one wonder what purpose censorship serves.

If we are to truly learn from history, Control Room proposes the truth must be told without censorship and without the candy coating.  I hope Control Room finds its way into our high school history curriculum.",1099353600,10,1859,5.016233766233766

2136844,5,B0002X8U4I,"Wow, this was really good! Al Jazeera is said to be too pro-American by the Arab world and has too much propaganda according to Mr. Bush and Donald Rumsfield.

But in reality, Al Jazeera is about as unbiased as you can get. They report everything, I mean literally everything as it happens, uncensored and people blame for trying to show things their way. An example is, our U.S. government thought that Al Jazeera was taking a supposedly ""pro-Saddam"" view by showing the dead civilians in Iraq.  Then on the same note, our government got mad that Al Jazeera showed the POWs and dead American soldiers when all Al Jazeera is trying to do is show that there is a human cost to war by showing the very unfortunate deaths on both sides.

In Control Room, American soldiers, the U.S. government, Iraqis, and people who work at Al Jazeera talk uncensored about their opinions and feelings.

The part that I thought was the most powerful is when a Al Jazeera worker is upset about the way U.S. government is handling it's foreign policies but admires the U.S. public and our constitution - he says that he believes in our constitution and Americans have enough sense and power to do what is right and they will.

2136845,5,B0002X8U4I,"Pretty amusing to read comments here about this film being ""poorly made"".  I'd be very curious to hear what the authors of such criticism of CONTROL ROOM consider a ""well-made"" documentary.

This film can be summed up quite perfectly by a quote featured prominently in it, spoken by one of the al-Jazeera technicians interviewed: ""this word, 'objectivity', is a mirage"".  Using this quote as a jumping off point to look at the film as whole, one immediately sees that it is a brilliant work, as ""balanced"" as a documentary can be on such a subject as the war against Iraq and the entire spectrum of media's coverage of same (not just al-Jazeera's).  One of the strengths of this terrific film is that it its editing is, in large part, invisible.  Which isn't to say that it isn't crafted, because it is, but it is not strict manipulation (a large part of FAHRENHEIT 911, as with much of Michael Moore's work).

It's a rare non-fiction film these days which goes to great lengths to allow the complexities of discussions to emerge, and CONTROL ROOM does.  Sometimes it comes right out of the mouths of those you'd least expect to hear it from, such as (now-former) Captain Josh Rushing, Air Force spokesperson at CENTCOM, who presents a human, conflicted view of the war (a view which is reflective of a massive number of soldiers; so says Rushing in post-film interviews, but you are hardly likely to hear that outside of a film like CONTROL ROOM).

This is not a film of short answers to big questions.  It's a nuanced, non-hysterical, non-judgmental work which deserves to be seen by as wide an audience as FAHRENHEIT 911 has had.  It ranks up there with the finest verit documentaries of the past decades by the Maysles team, Leacock et al.  And it is actually beautifully photographed and edited, even within its modest DV means.",1099180800,10,1833,4.714733542319749

2136847,5,B0002X8U4I,"I rate this movie much higher than Fahrenheit 9/11. This is a balanced view of the war with its tragedies, loss, suffering and pain. Jehane Noujaim has done an amazing job of portraying the picture of the other side without getting biased. This movie is not about any propaganda but about journalism and the choices journalists get (specially in middle east) and the options open (or close to them).

In the western world we typically jump about democracy in middle east - the prime savior of a democracy is the free press. But then again we like the free press in Arab as long as they praise the western civilization. So when in the Arab world when Al-Jazeera tries to work towards free press and free speech Bush and his cronies are so angry. This is the essence of democracy and the way to live with it is to accept it as an aspect of life. Instead we see that US military destroys the Al-Jazeera bases.

When you compare these journalists to Bill O'Rielly then they look like saints. Somehow we as American's have to get out from this idea of ""you are in our side or their side"" - the world is all too grey and there is too little black and white.

I loved the documentary and after a long time saw something completely unbiased. I promise you will like it too. It dispels some of the picture that Fox draws of the Arab world - we should not forget that it was the Arab world which created the Persian civilization and at a time when the western world was still up in the trees",1099094400,8,1481,4.3393501805054155
2136848,5,B0002X8U4I,"""Control Room"" is a revealing look behind the scenes of Al-Jazeera Satellite Channels' coverage of the war in Iraq, from the American buildup to invasion in March 2003 until shortly after Baghdad was captured. Al-Jazeera was founded in 1996 as the first independent television news network in the Arab world. It's Western style coverage quickly made the Al-Jazeera persona non grata is several Arab nations for covering viewpoints critical of government policies. Al-Jazeera takes the view that objectivity is impossible to achieve in news coverage, and it is dangerously naive to think otherwise. At least in theory, the network attempts to give voice to all sides of the issue, encompassing all biases. If everybody hates them, Al-Jazeera believes it's doing it's job. If only one side hates them, their coverage must be inexcusably biased. I should mention that this is a typical Arab perspective on the news media. And it's certainly how things worked out with the United States. President Bush has accused Al-Jazeera of being ""the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden"", while Iraq banned Al-Jazeera for  broadcasting ""American propaganda"".

""Control Room""'s director Jehane Noujaim, whose last documentary was ""Startup.com"", is half American and half Egyptian. The film's producer and cinematographer, Hani Safama, is half Bosnian and half Egyptian. ""Control Room"" not only shows the other side of coin, the what and why of Iraq war coverage by an Arab network, but the film  contemplates the role of the media in modern warfare. Jehane Noujaim obtained daily access to two Al-Jazeera employees, whom we get to know well over the course of the film. Samir Khader is a world-weary, stressed-out Senior Producer at the network. Hassan Ibrahim is a Sudanese-born journalist, formerly of the BBC, who grew up in Saudi Arabia, attended college in the United States, and has covered 10 wars in the course of his career. Both of these men are perceptive and articulate in their views of the machinations of the press and politicians alike. (They speak English.) Ibrahim is an affable idealist who adores the US Constitution and hates this nation's politics. Khader is more pragmatic by nature, and his astute observations give the film weight. Khader's attitudes are very typical of educated Arabs, whom we don't often hear from in the American press. Other Al-Jazeera staff whom we meet include Producer Deema Khatib, Manager Joanne Tucker, and one of the network's simultaneous translators. These people are all very idealistic about the power for positive change that an independent network such as Al-Jazeera can bring to the Arab world by bringing uncensored political and social discourse into the homes of 40 million Arabs.

""Control Room""'s crew spent 5 weeks at the US Central Command, called CentCom, that had been moved from Tampa, Florida to Doha, Qatar for the invasion of Iraq. It is here that the world press gathered to broadcast announcements and ask questions of the US military. Press Officer Lt. Josh Rushing, of the Marine Corps, also gave the filmmaker's a lot of his time. It was his job to represent the American military operation to the world press. He assisted journalists however he could, all the time trying to make the US look good. The US Military couldn't have chosen a better representative. Lt. Rushing is generous with his time, friendly, fair, idealistic, remarkably patient, and always eager to understand all points of view. We also meet CNN correspondent Tom Mintier and MSNBC correspondent David Shuster at CentCom. CentCom, itself, is an interesting phenomenon. The war is being conducted from this isolated place in the middle of nowhere in Qatar. Journalists and military Press Officers alike are cut off from direct contact with the war and rely entirely on long distance communication in and out of CentCom.

""Control Room"" is truly a fascinating film about the media's role in modern warfare. Seeing what Arabs saw and why is ironically revealing of what Americans saw and why. Populated with interesting characters and pointed insights, ""Control Room"" is a must-see. In English and Arabic with English subtitles.

The DVD: Bonus features include 31 deleted scenes, 3 audio commentaries, and a theatrical trailer. I didn't watch all of the deleted scenes, but I found they contain a few interesting tidbits, but nothing essential. The scenes are mostly interviews with Hassan Ibrahim, Samir Khader, David Shuster, Deema Khatib, Tom Mintier, Lt. Josh Rushing,  and Moafak Tawfik. There are also some Al-Jazeera promo spots and 2 additional pieces about the day that 3 journalists were killed by American fire. The deleted scenes are organized according to whom they feature, so it's easy to find what you may be interested in.

The first audio commentary is by director Jehane Noujaim and producer/cinematographer Hani Safama. They talk about the history of Al-Jazeera that compelled them to understand the people behind the network and how they convinced Hassan Ibrahim, with whom they lived during filming, among others, to give them access. The commentary includes some interesting observations about the Al-Jazeera journalists and the American Press Officers. The second audio commentary is by Capt. Josh Rushing (Lieutenant in the film). He talks about his experiences at CentCom, the characters featured in the film, and the role of media in warfare. The third audio commentary is by Hassan Ibrahim and Samir Khader. They talk about each other, how they became involved with the film, their feelings about events depicted in the film, and decisions that they made in covering the war in Iraq. Samir is more pointedly critical of the Bush Administration in the commentary than in the film, as he gives his analysis of the aftermath of the war in Iraq. All three of the commentaries are worthwhile. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Arabic, French, and Spanish.",1099008000,22,5917,5.16910229645094

2136852,4,B0002X8U4I,"Having just seen Robert Greenwald's ""Outfoxed"" about the media manipulation we are subjected to by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, specifically the Fox Network, this eye-opening documentary is a fascinating counterpoint from the perspective of the famous and sometimes infamous Middle East news agency, Al-Jazeera. I cannot think of two more diametrically opposite news agencies reporting on the events in Iraq, but the key difference between them is that Al-Jazeera appears to admit to their biases rather than claim to be ""fair and balanced"". What is more startling is how much more similar they are in operation than they are different in their presentation of political opinion disguised as facts. Obviously filmmaker Jehane Noujaim takes a more sympathetic portrait of Al-Jazeera and does supply clear evidence where Al-Jazeera is right and the American government is wrong on certain Iraqi events. As an overview of the first independent and now most popular news channel in the Middle East, the film takes a hard look at the key milestones from Bush's threat of invasion through the toppling of Saddam Hussein.

One would think Michael Moore funded this documentary from the damning evidence presented, but Noujaim is nothing but thorough in illustrating the Bush administration's changing rationales for invading Iraq, the use of fear in the media to manipulate public opinion, the martyrdom of Jessica Lynch, the card deck identifying the most wanted men in Hussein's regime, and the suspiciously coincidental bombing deaths of three different Arab journalists on the same day by American planes. Al-Jazeera's perspective is unsurprisingly countered by Secretary of State Donald Rumsfeld, who accuses the news agency of faking pictures of civilian deaths. But Noujaim cuts to indisputable pictures of real victims from the American bombing. One of the most revealing moments in the film is the Al-Jazeera team's shocked disbelief witnessing the fall of Hussein's Iraq as they try to make their emotional response correspond to what they must rationally have expected all along. Noujaim spotlights several of Al-Jazeera's personalities, and each provides a unique opinion on both their news coverage as well as that of their American counterparts. Their begrudging respect for the Fox Network, for example, is an intriguing revelation among many presented here. Ultimately though, their disgust over American imperialism is clear, as reporter Hassan Ibrahim, as bitter an idealist as you'll ever see, decries, ""Eventually you'll have to find a solution that doesn't involve bombing someone into submission... democratize or I will shoot you."" Another eye-opener is how Al-Jazeera does not hesitate to invite Americans to give their point-of-view on the network, which is something the Fox Network purports to do but does so miserably due to the bullying tactics of their own personalities, Sean Hannity and of course, Bill O'Reilly. Those who have grown tired of the spin coming from the Bush administration will find this documentary valuable viewing. Highly recommended.",1098489600,29,3076,5.448637316561845
2136853,4,B0002X8U4I,"Rabid Muslims spouting anti-American rhetoric! Pro-terror loyalists in charge of a world-wide media outlet! Saddam sycophants singing a siren song, leading our children into godless Communism or godfull Islam!

So sorry. ""Control Room"" is none of these.

The film, a documentary about the Al-Jazeera network by Jehane Noujaim, does make a few very simple points. First, non-Americans have a different perspective than we do. Second, not many of them carry bombs. Third, they are often calm, rational and even nice.

In any other time, ""Control Room"" might be a rather bland Frontline-style documentary piece about a journalistic source in the Arab world. In today's polarized world of us-versus-them, however, it has become subversive to declare, ever so gently, that human beings with different points of view have anything worthwhile to say to Americans. This simple point is brought home by the sight of a roomful of Al-Jazeera technicians watching the fall of Bagdad in 2003. Where Americans might have reacted with glee or some form of relief or satisfaction, the Al Jazeera techs are dumbstruck and crestfallen. They can't believe that a proud and seemingly powerful Arab country like Iraq could be conquered so quickly. The sense of disappointment, humiliation and dismay are palpable. How much more so for the uneducated masses who are susceptible to manipulation by radicals?

""Control Room"" does not proselytize about the rightness of Al Jazeera's viewpoint. It merely presents us with the sight of rather ordinary journalists trying to do their jobs in the context of a clash of eastern and western cultures. Its depictions of Lieutenant Joshua Rushing, US press liaison in Baghdad is telling. Rushing tries mightily to convey American motivations and strategies to his Al Jazeera contacts. He seems perplexed and uncertain when they challenge his assumptions. Rushing tries hard to understand them, but it seems that he has two choices: to believe his own government's line, or to switch to the other man's. Clearly questioning his own logic, he cannot bring himself (for cultural and professional reasons) to accept the opposing viewpoint. ""Control Room"" expertly uses such poignant scenes to depict the struggle of well-intentioned people and the disparate ""truths"" they represent. What gave this film its immediacy was the context of the recent conflict in Iraq. Without that, it would not have been all that interesting.

You might leave the film without changing your opinions. You might, however, pause a moment before assuming that your side of the issue, whatever it might be, is the only one worth talking about.

8034207,4,B0002X8U4I,"The Control Room is a documentary that looks into Al-Jazeeras coverage of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. The documentary lacks commentary and therefore does not directly criticize or justify the invasion. However, the documentary does urge its viewers to consider the invasion from the perspective of the Arab world. The central characters from Al-Jazeera are Samir Khader (senior producer), Hassan Ibrahim (journalist), Abdallah Schleifer (media analyst), and Mohammed Jasem (general manager). The film also centers on Lieutenant Josh Rushing who was Central Commands Press Officer. The film took place at the headquarters of Al-Jazeera in Doha Qatar as well as at CENTCOM, located outside of Doha Qatar. The films timeline begins with the buildup to the invasion and ends when Baghdad was toppled.
  The documentary is important because it forces one to consider the Arab perspective of the invasion. In the very beginning of the documentary, while the U.S. prepares for the invasion, the words the Arab world watches and waits, are displayed on the screen. This is the cue to the viewer to switch roles in the us versus them mentality. The documentary shows Hassan Ibrahim, on multiple occasions, stressing and emphasizing that the U.S. needs to view the events from a typical Arab. Towards the end of the documentary, even LT Rushing sees the need that both sides need to see each others perspective.
  In the beginning of the film you see Ibrahim sitting in a lounge talking with some Arab men. In regards to the invasion, one Arab comments do I have the right to kick you out of your house and move in? After the toppling of Baghdad, Ibrahim states that it is degrading to the Arab world to watch another Arab capital ransacked.the Arab world sees the technologically advanced Israeli Army crushing Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank and they associate them with the American Army destroying Iraq. The message is the Arabs tie the fall of Baghdad to the Israeli-Palestine conflict or as Ibrahim puts it those two images fuse and become one.
  Ibrahim was able to separate the administration from the rest of the American population or not associate every American as supporting the invasion. In response to the question who is going to stop the U.S., Ibrahim stated that he believes in American Democracy, and that the U.S. people are going to stop the U.S. Empire. This sets Ibrahim apart from Samir Khader, the senior producer. In the beginning of the documentary, Khader states that Al-Jazeera is there to educate the Arabs in democracy using openness, other opinions, no taboos, respect of the other opinion, and free debate. Yet Khader contradicted his statement when he chastised an Al-Jazeera worker for interviewing Jeffery Steinberg from Washington D.C. who was critical of the war. Khader called Steinberg a crazy activist and had no logic or balance, that he was hallucinating. This contradiction seemed to suggest that Khader was biased. Rushing points out that Al-Jazeera plays to Arab nationalism. To interview someone within the U.S. who was critical of the war would have threatened the role that Khader wants Al-Jazeera to play.
  It may be easy to claim that Al-Jazeera plays to Arab nationalism. But it is also easy to see that American news networks, especially Fox, play to American patriotism. In the beginning of the documentary and at the end of the film, Khader remarks that you cannot wage war without the media.the [U.S.] media is there to defend the values of Rumsfeld, Cheney, and Bush. In simpler terms, Al-Jazeera believed that the administration hijacked the media. From the American perspective, Al-Jazeera was viewed as being biased especially when they would show pictures of dead Iraqis from U.S. bombings. The network was also criticized for showing footage of American hostages and dead U.S. soldiers. Rushing agrees that the U.S. media plays to American Patriotism and Al-Jazeera as supporting Arab nationalism, but that Al-Jazeera is a bit different as they exude anti-Americanism. The opposing views and perspectives on one-another make the viewer wonder if the news can ever be neutral. This is significant since the media can play a big role in shaping public opinion.
  One part in the film showed that tensions often existed between the media outlets and the U.S. military. The media wanted more information on military operations, and blamed the military for burying the lead. In one section of the film, the U.S. military briefly showed, at a press conference, a deck of Iraqs Most Wanted playing cards. The media wanted to see the deck of cards, but the military never gave the press the cards to examine. From the militarys perspective, they were not burying the lead, they were trying to avoid giving the press an intelligence report. Once again, the documentary was showing both sides to the story.
  Near the end of the movie, the film devotes time to the U.S. bombing of the Al-Jazeera office in Baghdad. Al-Jazeera believed that the U.S purposefully targeted the office, especially since the U.S. knew the coordinates of the building. The U.S. stated that they targeted the building because they received reports of gunshots from the location. Khader remarks that the U.S. was sending a message, and that Al-Jazeera was powerless to do anything about the bombing. What this section of the film does, or what Khader seems to promulgate, is the victim narrativethat the Middle East is the victim of Western imperialism.
  In conclusion the documentary is informative. It challenges viewers to view the 2003 Iraq invasion from the Arab perspective. At the same time, it also urges viewers to consider if all medias are inherently biased and that where you stand is where you sit. As the film progresses, it is noticeable that LT Rushing begins to view the war differently and questions his own bias. This is what happened to me when I was in Iraq. Regardless of what one may think about this documentary, it is important to remember as Hassam Ibrahim points out The Arab world is watching.",1475884800,,6051,5.019940179461615
