8263389,5,B0016MJ6K6,DVD arrived in fine shape n plays fine but I rate the movie 2 stars.,1466726400,,68,3.6

8263391,3,B0016MJ6K6,"The film is divided into a plot and subplot. In the present, Sid (Corey Large) is a bar tender at a gentleman's club. His main interest is in helping Michelle (Susan Ward). He is also haunted by images of Lucille (Charity Shea).

Lucille we get to know from the ""one year earlier"" subplot. She escapes from a mental institution and her crime boss dad (Tom Sizemore) wants her gone, but not necessarily killed, just gone. She is ""cursed"" as she says, ""When people try to help me, they die."" He tells his hitman Sid and goon Antoine (Danny Trejo) to go find her by ""following the trails of dead bodies."" When it starts ""raining white people"" they know they are near.

That is the easy part to figure out. The film is very confusing until the end when things tie together if you were taking notes. At that time I thought I would have enjoyed the film more if I knew what was going on instead waiting for the ending. I don't normally need to think too deep in a Trejo grindhouse, but it seems there are exceptions.

Parental guide: F-bomb, sex, brief nudity- much less one would expect. More of a cult film.",1394928000,2,1103,4.397058823529412
8263392,4,B0016MJ6K6,"I ordered this movie, and was pleased. It is a good independent film, and it is nice to see many character actors in bigger roles. The action looked A-List, very Ridley Scott in style. See it if you like independent films!",1331251200,,222,4.439024390243903
8263393,4,B0016MJ6K6,"I have to watch this film again to better understand what i just watched. It's one of those films, like 21 Grams and Suicide Club. I loved the twist at the end. It's about a girl who escapes from a mental ward and her dad wants her found dead. Everyone she meest somehow ends up dead which is truth it seems. The dad's hitmen just have to follow the trail of dead bodies. Toxic is the club that everything is based around.",1299715200,,422,4.158536585365853
8263394,2,B0016MJ6K6,"This movie is really hard to follow. The plot is so twisted that at the end I still had no idea who all was still alive and who was dead. I got this because I am a Costas Mandylor fan, but this is not one of his better movies.",1232064000,,226,3.63265306122449
8263395,4,B0016MJ6K6,"this movie was very weird, at times it was action, and then horror, the acting was really good, and the movie was very fast paced. I just think that the story could have been a little better, but all in all a solid move. So if you like weird, confusing fast paced horror / action this is deff the movie, I warned you though the movie is very confusing, with that said I still give it 4 stars , cause I definately did not see that endong comming.",1215648000,,445,4.068181818181818
