5880985,4,B00E00GBIQ,"What it HAS: Great production quality, superb voice acting, giant monsters vs giant robots. Unfortunately it also gets lost in it's own plot, forgets it's roots, is downright stupid at times.

What it's missing: The magic and innocence of the original series. The mystery and beauty of the original series. A coherent plot line. Come on! Monsters are friends. No, wait, coral is the friend. No wait, both are enemies. Scratch that, pick either one as a friend and the other as an enemy. Wait forget all that, now we need Doctor Who to figure things out.

This is not really a sequel. We see a couple of the characters for a few minutes. Is that Eureka's giant bot? Renton's? A different one? The same, but different?  Too many ""facts"" change throughout the series. Watch episode 1 then watch episode 9.  Or 3 and 10 or 5 and 10. You'll be wondering what happened to the protagonists, antagonists, and overall plot.

All that out of the way, this is a decent anime set in (sort of) the world of Eureka 7. It's missing the kids catching Trapar waves - but has vehicles that uses them. It's not not great.",1386460800,,1102,4.517587939698492
5880986,5,B00E00GBIQ,amazing my boyfriend is so happy he got this!!!! he loves this anime and very happy about the price! :) came before schedules date!,1386460800,,131,4.5
5880987,5,B00E00GBIQ,"This was just beautiful I am a huge fan of the original series, and to see it come back was just the greatest thing. This is just like it says on the box, ""a worthy successor to Eureka Seven!"" It brings back the fresh feeling and the good times that the original had plus more. The story is laid out nicely, the characters are memorable and fleshed out nicely, the animation is just gorgeous and combined with its beautiful soundtrack it makes for a crazy piece of eye candy.

If you have seen Eureka Seven, this is a must watch! Just make sure to pay close attention, it likes to throw you for loops and spins with its story. But if you keep track it all adds up, and you'll get dashed easter eggs. If you haven't seen the first series this might be a pass until you start Eureka Seven!!",1385856000,,788,4.218543046357616
5880988,4,B00E00GBIQ,I'm huge fan of Eureka 7 first watched it on adult swim cartoon networks last night programing. Soon as I started watched it I was hooked. When I heard a sequel was being made I squiel with joy. Most people will say AO is not up to it predisor (please exuse horriable spelling.) I say however it does in its own special way. It follows the adventures of Renton and Eurekas son AO. Its a very interesting story you'll need to watch it atleast twice to get it but over all a must have E7 fans not really for those who haven't watch orginal series. But enjoy and fly away with the sky fish.,1385424000,,587,4.157894736842105
5880989,3,B00E00GBIQ,"As the sequel to a serious anime, I didn't appreciate the constant references to other anime. Also some questions go unanswered while others deserved to be such. You would be hard pressed to find someone who loves E7 more than me and I caution any other fan going into this show.",1385251200,,279,4.490196078431373
5880990,4,B00E00GBIQ,Not as good as the original and I'm not judging this just as a prequel. As an anime it's plot was a little to convoluted and tedious for me. To all those expected more of the same or a grand follow up to the original story you may be disappointed because this jumps in a completely different direction and the story itself was written by a completely different author so that is to be expected. On it's own it is interesting and the characters do pull you in but the sci fi elements do go out of control with elements of time travel combined with the creation of different universes. It's slightly overly complex and a hindrance to the story and puts a strain on the plot as a whole. Beyond that it is a good anime though not a sequel you may be wanting.,1385078400,,754,4.206896551724138
5880991,5,B00E00GBIQ,"Firstly, the item came quite promptly and in great condition.  Second, I hope they make a movie based on this one as well or a continuation of what happens after the final episode, the characters went through so much only to get shafted in the end.  I understand sacrifice and what Ao's parents went through put some of the bravest people I know to shame.  I know they are fictional but you can't help but feel so sad at the end and hope that the makers can give their characters a happy ending, they all totally deserve it.",1381968000,,524,4.326530612244898
5880992,4,B00E00GBIQ,"Honestly, there are only 2 major sins this anime commits:

1) It doesn't even attempt to properly honor the message or style of original series despite being advertised as a sequel.  This would've served better as a spin-off with brand new characters, only borrowing elements like surfing robots, trapars and surfing robots.

2) The first half tries to be a classic ""monster of the week"" show, but forgets the important fact that your monsters need to be memorable in order to succeed. Astral Ocean's monsters are faceless, colorless shapes that are all killed in a forgettable manner(with the exception of the first one).

People complain about lack of story direction, cardboard characters, and political nonsense but I've been a fan of the mecha genre for a long time and this is hardly the worst offender.  I've grown to enjoy political mumbo-jumbo as its own form of storytelling. To be honest I even grew to like the characters in this anime despite their lack of development. It's all about the subtlety. I'm not saying you've got to be a genius or something to appreciate it. A lot of it is just implied, and that clicks for some people and doesn't for most. The story left lots of people bitter and unsatisfied, but this also something I've strangely come to enjoy in anime, as it really makes you realize how invested into the series you truly were.

If you're on the fence about the series, here's my advice:

Don't watch it as a fan of Eureka Seven, but as a fan of the mecha genre in general. I watched Eureka Seven back in middle-school so it wasn't a difficult feat for me to pull off. AO's got a fantastic soundtrack and above-average production values that will make it watchable at the very least. Personally, I found it pretty enjoyable.

Also, get into it through the dub, not the sub. Like I mentioned earlier, subtlety is key and the majority of character depth shines through their tone, word choice, and body language. Reading the dialogue on the bottom of the screen's not gonna cut it for most, and will likely dumb down the experience. That, and trying to read through the politics will just lull you to sleep.

Truth, arguably the worst character, also sounds 100000x better in English and actually ended up becoming one of my favorites in this lineup.

Buy it for the surfing robot(s), not 'cus you want something like Eureka x Renton

**If you do buy the entire series, be sure to watch the OVA episode located in Part 2 after watching episode 8. Watching it at the very end will likely incite rage.",1381276800,17,2529,4.6606741573033705
5880996,1,B00E00GBIQ,Notting like Eureka Seven at all and tho that normally would not be a bad thing if the anime was good but this is not the case since its a very bad made anime. I am a big fan of Eureka Seven and this anime was a very big disappointment.,1411776000,,236,3.74
5880997,5,B00E00GBIQ,"I'm no ""mecha"" fan but AO is engaging and quite fun. One or two fairly annoying characters but in the grand scheme of things it matters not. A very appealing, scenic island environment, cool futuristic technology, and it's an automatic winner in my book. Characters are pretty fleshed out, the English dub is fantastic. The animation, attention to detail and blu-ray video quality is simply -superb-",1410566400,,399,5.0606060606060606

5880999,5,B00E00GBIQ,It was good but didn't meet my expectations but that being said still worth the purchase hope this helps .,1399507200,,106,4.35
5881000,5,B00E00GBIQ,Ordered Part one for Christmas and my grandson enjoyed it so much I got him the second series for his birthday.  He was an avid pokeman watcher now he's a little older and still enjoying these anime series.,1399075200,,206,4.421052631578948
5881001,4,B00E00GBIQ,"Excellent anime, spin off of Eureka 7. Done much better than the first show. AO takes place after the events in Eureka 7. Although it helps to have seen the original it isn't necessary as everything does get explained. Part 2 can get a little confusing at times. The timeline in AO gets tampered with and is easily made the plot. The only disadvantage is the lack of bonus features.",1398297600,,382,4.4714285714285715

8599626,4,B00E00GBIQ,"I personally had my own reasons of liking and barely even any reason for disliking this sequel to Eureka 7. So if you're a fan of the previous 50 episodes, you're in for a slight change.

Pros:
1. The soundtrack to this series is behind phenomenal! It surpassed even the soundtrack to Eureka 7 and every time the music began for a scene you could feel the energy and emotional impact behind it.

2. This isn't going to be the same story of the star-crossed lovers who fell in love the first time around and struggled to kindle their budding relationship, it's more action packed filled with giant IFO's (LFO's basically, no difference) vs. Secrets battle sequences and friendships among a colorful set of new characters Ao meets. Ao at times may seem confused in situations as much as we are, but he is never afraid and fights with no fear to the very end.

3. The storyline itself was a bit confusing at first, seeing as it dives into a lot of political mumbo-jumbo, certain dark topics diving into wars of the past and slight racism towards Ao for being an outsider with blue hair, and many different confusing questions you have through out the whole time: Where are Eureka and Renton now? What are these things called 'Secrets' and what do they REALLY want? Who is the man named Truth, what are his motives, how can he do the things he does, why is he after Eureka? Why does everyone want these 'Quartz' cubes that come from the Scub Coral? Many questions come into play in this series and it takes a good eye and ear to fully grasp everything going on around Ao and his journey to find his mother Eureka. But in the end, everything comes into perspective following the last 4 episodes of this 24 episode series. Then, you fully grasp the whole meaning behind everything that's happened previously and can really appreciate such a beautiful story!

Cons:
1. Like previously stated; you'll need to pay attention closely. Through out all the political views, shenanigans among the Generation Blue members with Ao, and conversations among the characters on this show, you might accidentally miss some information and later on not know what they're talking about.

2. I can't fully speak for everyone, but personally the ending for the original Eureka 7 left me longing for more. Primarily saddening me beyond any show or movie in my entire life ever did because I wanted Eureka and Renton to live happily ever after WITH the others from Gekko State back on their world after ALL that they went through to fall in love, but they were at least together on Earth which made up for it. Where I'm getting to point-wise is that this ending has that precise exact feeling: saddening. Ao has to make a very difficult choice that will affect everyone and everything the entire story even builds up to and it just leaves you sitting there wishing for more, like closure is in need.

Overall, I give this show a 4.5 only docking a .5 from my rating because of the ending. Besides that factor, this show was just the right thing to watch and had me wanting more every episode!",1419984000,,3065,4.594149908592322
8599627,3,B00E00GBIQ,"*spoilers* Watching the whole series at first can be confusing with the time jumping of eureka, but it wasn't a terrible sequel. It just needed to be longer like the first series. One of the things that will bug me about the last episode is why didn't eureka and renton just stay in the past when ao was 2 years old and raise him then so they'd be a real family for once? Hopefully they'll be another series to correct the mistakes of this one.",1418774400,,444,4.235294117647059
