5552267,5,B00B1LKXZY,"If you remember the last Stu Show from December of 2012 when Jerry Beck said that the Sylvester & Friends and the second Daffy Duck Super Stars DVDs were canceled. Well guess what, he lied to us again that looney joker (like what he did in March when he said that the Super Stars DVDs ended but didn't since they've brung out the Porky Pig DVD in November last year). I guess they changed the title of the DVD and renamed it ""Sylvester & Hippety Hopper: Marsupial Mayhem"" and will contain all 13 Hippety Hopper cartoons and 5 of Sylvester Jr.'s stand alone cartoons (there are 12 in total with the ones featuring Hippety Hopper). Here are the list of shorts it will contain:

Original Opening Titles Remastered - ^
Original Opening Rings Remastered - ^^

*Hop, Look an Listen (1948)^
*Hippety Hopper (1949, previously released on LTGC Vol. 6 as a bonus carton but not remastered)^^
*Pop `im Pop! (1950)^^
*Who's Kitten Who? (1952)
*Hoppy-Go-Lucky (1952)
*Cats Aweigh! (1953)
*Bell Hoppy (1954)^^
*Lighthouse Mouse (1955)
*Too Hop to Handle (1956)
*Slap-Hoppy Mouse (1956)
*Mouse-Taken Identity (1957, previously released on Mouse Chronicles as a bonus carton but not remastered)
*Hoppy Daze (1961)
*Freudy Cat (1964)
*Cat's Paw (1959)
*Fish and Slips (1962)
*Birds of a Father (1961)
*Claws in the Lease (1963)
*Goldimouse and the Three Cats (1960, previously released on LTGC Vol. 5)

Hopefully it will contain more lost original opening and closing titles/rings to these shorts (like Hop, Look an Listen) and remastered improvements on both Hippety Hopper and Mouse-Taken Identity. I hope the second Daffy Duck DVD will be chanced to maybe Bugs & Daffy instead along with some more Super Stars DVDs they should make featuring Speedy Gonzales, the post-1935/pre-1943 black & white Looney Tunes and maybe Yosemite Sam & Elmer Fudd (both in one since they have some more cartoons that are not on DVD yet). And since this doesn't contain any Warner Bros.-Seven Arts. Looney Tunes (unlike the Porky Pig DVD) along with some bad Looney Tunes (unlike the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote DVD), I give this 5 stars.",1358467200,25,2107,4.896358543417367
5552268,4,B00B1LKXZY,"There is no question that when it has came down to seeing the Looney Tunes cartoons on DVD, they really have been a short-changed mixed bag of collections, that honestly haven't actually delivered their money in each one. Since the Looney Tunes Super Stars collection was released in 2010, there have been some volumes that needed tweaking that weren't worth their money, and others that have hit the nail on the head well. For Sylvester, he has been on one volume before, where he goes after Tweety seeking just desserts. Sadly, that volume featured all cartoons that were on previous volumes of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection 1-6, and most of them were released on a DVD that didn't include anything new a few years ago. But there honestly haven't been many collections that haven't featured Sylvester going after another foe like Speedy Gonzales, or the big jumping mouse that he has thought of as, which actually is a baby kangaroo. Well, now Sylvester finally is featured on a DVD of his own, trying to prove his own honor to himself, or to his son Sylvester Jr. Get 'Em Sylvester, and it delivers well.

Looney Tunes Super Stars: Sylvester & Hippety Hopper is definitely a Looney Tunes DVD collection, that makes up for some of the lackluster ones that Warner Brothers were not able to deliver upon in the past several years. The collection shows the other side of Sylvester that was honestly missing on video, and to appeal to die hard fans for years that Warner Brothers wasn't really able to show (considering Sylvesters' cartoons won the most Academy awards for Warner Brothers for Friz Freleng's lifetime. 4 of them for Friz out of 5.) The collection shows Sylvester seeking food for himself that is more than just everyday cat meat on the table, whether it is the baby kangaroo, or fish from a local aquarium in Fish & Slips, in cartoons like Mouse-Taken Identity, where Sylvester takes his son to his job, trying to catch mice at a museum (Mouse-Taken Identity), or Cat's Paw where Sylvester takes his son birdwatching high in the deep in the mountains, where he encounters a dangerous baby dwarf eagle that tries to make a meal out of Sylvester. There is only few cartoons that have been released on the Looney Tunes Golden Collections before (Goldi-Mouse & The Three Cats is the only one released on DVD earlier.)

1) Hop, Look & Listen 2) Hippety Hopper 3) Pop ""Em Pop 4) Who's Kitten Who? 5) Cat's Aweigh! 6) Hoppy-Go Lucky 7) Bell Hoppy 8) Lighthouse Mouse 9) Too Hop To Handle 10) The Slap Happy Mouse 11) Mouse-Taken Identity 12) Hoppy Daze 13) Freudy Cat 14) Cat's Paw 15) Fish & Slips 16) Birds Of A Father 17) Claws For Lease 18) Goldi-Mouse & The Three Cats

Overall, based on the track listing, this honestly is one of the better Looney Tunes releases that is definitely worth the effort. The cartoons that Robert McKimson and Friz Freleng directed that are here, definitely show why this one is definitely one of the better DVD releases. Looney Tunes Super Stars: Sylvester & Hippety Hopper is definitely worth its money, and is a real treat that has been waiting for years for anyone that has wanted to see the other sides of Sylvester that hasn't been delivered yet. I definitely recommend this as a great buy for anyone that is a classic die hard fan of the Looney Tunes cartoons for years.

I would only say that these particular kinds of sets that focus on one character are not the best way to watch these cartoons, in my opinion, because it can seem too repetitious; and if the premise is kind of a ""one note"" deal, like with Sylvester and ""Hippety Hopper,"" even more so.  I wish that Warner Home Video would put out more sets like the Golden Collections or Platinum Collections, with discs that contain the full variety of Looney Tunes stars, well known and less well known ... after all, that is the way we all first enjoyed these cartoons.

5552293,5,B00B1LKXZY,"This video is timeless. Although the cartoons were drawn an era ago, the relationship between father and son remain the same as is depicted by Sylvester and his son in some of these cartoons. The confusion of mistaken identity never fails to make me laugh when Hoppity (the baby kangaroo) is taken for a giant mouse. I loved these cartoons as a kid and every time I watch them, I am transported back to a simpler time when you could actually hear birds singing in the morning rather than police sirens. This is a very good collection and I would recommend it to everyone who is still a child at heart.

5552294,4,B00B1LKXZY,"Any new Looney Tunes collection is welcome.  There's something to be said for completism and we get all of the Sylvester / Sylvester Jr. / Hippety Hopper cartoons on one disc.
The bad news is that at least half of these toons are mediocre to downright bad which parallels director Robert McKimson's downward trajectory starting in the mid-50s .
The good news is that it's worth the price just to get the first 6 shorts. 'Hop, Look and Listen' through 'Cats Aweigh' are prime examples of Robert McKimson at his best: laugh-out-loud funny with the loose, anarchic animation that was the hallmark of early McKimson. Once you get to 'Bell Hoppy' the laughs start to dwindle and, as the years progress, the animation also goes downhill until, by the late 50s, they're almost a chore to get through. (If you don't have it already 'Goldimouse and the Three Cats' is also very funny but it is a Friz Freleng-directed toon and a repeat from the Golden Collection).

For more great examples of early McKimson WB needs to revisit the Foghorn Leghorn toons and release the truly classic late 40s-early 50s shorts that they inexplicably left off the FL Super Stars disc.  (Not to mention his Bugs Bunny toon 'A-Lad-In His Lamp' which used to be a Saturday morning staple)

And what about all of the hilarious solo Sylvester and Sylvester/Tweety cartoons that are still languishing in the WB vaults? I'll take 'Life with Feathers', 'A Mouse Divided' and 'Greedy for Tweety' over 'Mouse-Taken Identity' and 'Freudy Cat' anyday.",1371772800,,1512,4.848837209302325

5552297,4,B00B1LKXZY,"It's what it says it is.  A whole bunch of Sylvester and Hippety Hopper cartoons.  I'm happy to have it.  I just don't understand why none of this was released in the Golden Collections.  The cartoons should all be mixed up.  There shouldn't be one entire DVD with just one character on it.  No one wants to watch, back to back, 15 Road Runner cartoons, or 15 Pepe Le Pew cartoons, or 15 Hippety Hopper cartoons.  It's not how we watched them as kids on Saturday mornings.  It's not how we want to watch them today.

Anyway, the cartoons are good.  I would have given it five stars, but the fact that they weren't included in the Golden Collections and that they weren't well mixed in with the other cartoons makes me want to penalize it.",1367712000,4,738,4.360294117647059
5552298,4,B00B1LKXZY,"This set requires you to believe that Sylvester has a short-term memory problem.  The big joke of the Hippity Hopper series is that Sylvester thinks this baby kangaroo is a big mouse, then he tries to catch him.
These cartoons originally appeared only once every year or two at the movie theaters, rather than back-to-back as presented here.  So original audiences most likely would not remember the jokes that get repeated here. Thus watching these in a marathon viewing is not the best way to enjoy these.  Take them 2 or 3 at a time.

The series starts out good, but by the 4th cartoon it seems to get routine, but don't worry as Bob McKimson gets back on track quickly.  Some entries spoof famous books & movies (Hoppy-Go-Licky), others take on more varied locations (Lighthouse Mouse).

Sylvester's son appears in many of these, wanting to learn from that 'great mouser' his father.  At times Junior has the best lines, such as when Sylvester goes flying through a wall and Junior runs up to his back end.  Junior stops talking and says ""Silly Me, that isn't the talking end"".  That line always brings a smile.

The Hoppity series ends with FREUDY CAT (1963) in which Sylvester's son takes his dad to a psychiatrist because Sylvester thinks he saw the big mouse again.  Sylvester then relates to the psychiatrist all of his adventures with the Big Mouse, using clips from most of the cartoons that we have just seen.  Not much reason to watch this one as we have just seen all of these clips.  This cartoon also tells us that Sylvester does indeed remember all of his encounters with the Big Mouse.

This set then continues on with other Sylvester & son cartoons now that the psychiatrist has gotten the Big Mouse out of Sylvester's head.  CATS PAW (1963) starts this new chapter in Sylvester's life.

Other reviewers have already given title lists, so there is no reason to repeat that information.

It appears that Warner Home Video has abandoned the idea of cropping their post 1954 cartoons to look wide-screen.  All cartoons are presented here just as they were produced, FULL FRAME.  Nothing will be cropped off.
All of the original first release title sections are here except for the cartoon WHO'S KITTEN WHO?, which has the 'Blue Ribbon' re-issue titles.

The REMASTERING looks very good, sharper than ever before. But when you see the one duplication from the Golden Collections (that was re-mastered for that series) GOLDIMOUSE AND THE THREE CATS, you will notice that these new releases just don't have the vibrant colors as the old Golden Collection remasters.

A better title for this set would have been ""SYLVESTER AND SON"".",1366675200,10,2644,4.779735682819383
5552299,5,B00B1LKXZY,"Hey, it's the Looney Tunes DVD that doubles as a drinking game! Take a shot every time you hear the phrase ""giant mouse!""

Yes, the latest Looney Tunes Super Stars release, Sylvester & Hippety Hopper: Marsupial Mayhem is just that: every single one of the cartoons Bob McKimson directed featuring either Hippety Hopper or Sylvester Junior. (Along with the one he didn't direct, Friz Freleng's Goldimouse and the Three Cats.) Most of these are centered around the concept of Sylvester and son mistaking the loose baby kangaroo for a giant mouse, a delightfully absurd premise created by writer Warren Foster that called for a lot of creative leeway (for one, joeys don't have round ears). Things play out in such a similar fashion in each cartoon that it's hard to single out any individual one for praise, beyond, ""the earliest ones are best.""

The restorations on this disc, as they've been for the past year or two of Warner cartoon releases, are a mixed bag. True, they are clearer than any previous home video or television incarnations, but for the most part are a bit dark and grungy, looking as though they could've used a little more time in the studio facilities. The time and money that created the Golden Collection sets of 2003-08 are now nonexistent, so any reasonable facsimile to these cartoons' original IB Technicolor glory is coincidental. One only needs to look at the collection's single double-dip, Goldimouse and the Three Cats (restored for the fifth Golden Collection in 2007), to see the difference. So long as they are uncensored and free of the abhorrent DVNR process (which mistakes animation lines and movement for dirt and literally erases them), though, they get a free pass from me, even if it is disappointing to have to classify the Warner discs by 'A' and 'B' restorations.

So wait, is this still worth buying? Well, of course. Anyone reading this is probably a Warner completist like myself and will buy any unreleased cartoons without hesitation. There are still many genuinely funny moments, and any viewer will get a kick out of Junior's prissy manner and snide comments to his father. They're also a painful example of how high the level of skill was in the era of classic Warner animation. If these cartoons are weak by those standards, what exactly does that say about today's animation?",1366675200,15,2330,4.878787878787879

8560931,4,B00B1LKXZY,"SYLVESTER & HIPPETY HOPPER-MARSUPIAL MAYHEM: Of all the characters in the Looney Tunes stable of stars, Sylvester the thloppy puddy tat proved the most versatile. Director Friz Freleng most famously starred him opposite Tweety Bird, not to mention Speedy Gonzales, and he paired off as a ""fraidy cat"" with Porky Pig in several Chuck Jones chestnuts. Director Robert McKimson put him in another series with a boxing baby kangaroo named Hippety Hopper, who was always mistaken for a ""giant mouse"". Often appearing was his spitting image son Sylvester Jr., who wasn't above wearing a paper bag over his head whenever his Father embarrassed him. Like Pepe Le Pew, the one joke premise was run onto the ground, but somehow remained funny thanks to writer Ted Pierce's verbal quips. To break things up, this eighteen short DVD offers a few 'roo-less adventures, notably Freleng's twisted fairy tale Goldimouse and the Three Cats. Even though Hippety was never given much personality, the sarcastic griping of disillusioned Sylvester Jr. made him shine as one of the more underrated members of the Looney Tunes family...HE deserves this tribute most of all.
