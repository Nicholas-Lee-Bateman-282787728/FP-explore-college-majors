8373184,5,B000O90EQC,"Last call for Strawberry Shortcake Songs! Those songs seems so much fun to sing and learn! Especially if you have a girl that's berry popular! (The 2003 series is cool, but the reboot.. NOT!) My 9 favorites are the theme song, Springtime anthem, Strawberry Girl in a Strawberry World, Jammin, A Berry Happy Birthday, The Cookie Song, Friendship Grows, That's Imagination #2, and I Put the Zing in Spring.",1508716800,,404,4.869565217391305
