6455972,5,B00KZKWQJ8,"Love this movie, it can be an instant classic. It's Funny, a lot of action, suspense, and I love how it's shot in Brooklyn NY. Hope they make a part 2 or another film from this director and producer.",1423094400,,199,4.128205128205129

6455974,4,B00KZKWQJ8,"Anthoni (Solvan Naim) and his BFF Ronnie (Thomas Watts) are pizza delivery boys in Brooklyn. Anthoni happens upon a bag of money from a drug deal gone bad. Lomatic (Rob Morgan) is the crime boss of the area and wants his money back.

The plot is not original. What is original is the light way in which they approach it. The film is humorous, but not a full fledged LOL inane comedy. It has no trouble introducing characters late in the film such as Layla (Celestine Rae) and Hippy (Sam Eliad). Worth a view if you like those hip-hop gangsta films and can laugh at them.

Guide: F-bomb. Sex. No nudity.",1428796800,,602,4.414414414414415
6455975,4,B00KZKWQJ8,Good movie. Could be paced faster and cut some scenes to be serious instead of jokes.,1428710400,,85,4.375

6455977,5,B00KZKWQJ8,"Great movie, didn't expect it to be AS GOOD as it is but I definitely recommend this movie to anyone, has a little bit of everything you love in a movie, or at least I do!!  I paid 3.99 to rent it, I probably would have paid 5-10$! :)",1427673600,2,234,3.7755102040816326
6455978,5,B00KZKWQJ8,"Huge movie fan loves the film. Funny and action-packed, very refreshing movie. This is a must see flick.",1426982400,2,104,4.833333333333333
6455979,5,B00KZKWQJ8,"Full Circle combines a terrific action movie with a likeable hero, a villian that you'll love to hate, snappy funny dialog, and a cast of quirky characters that keep the action and laughs going throughout. Think of a mashup of True Romance and Scott Pilgrim vs The World (with better & original music) and you'll be on the right track. There's so much to like here.  Watch out for the writer/director/star/rapper ""Slick"" Naim. Whether he ends up being known for his filmmaking, acting, or rapping, this talented man is gonna be a big success.",1426896000,2,542,4.76595744680851
6455980,4,B00KZKWQJ8,This movie is a hidden gem! The dialogue was smart and funny and had me wanting moregreat social commentary. Overall a story of depth and power where the dangerous streets are seen through the eyes of Anthoni. This is a story of adolescents temporarily becoming criminals out of sheer pragmatism. Great movie!,1425686400,4,309,4.961538461538462
6455981,5,B00KZKWQJ8,Very funny movie with great music! I think it will garner a cult following and I hope there's a sequel in the works.,1425168000,2,116,4.086956521739131
6455982,1,B00KZKWQJ8,"Wow...this is horrible.  The story is completely unoriginal, the characters are one-dimensional.

This movie plays exactly like a bad rap video, but with worse acting.",1425081600,2,167,5.64
8662925,1,B00KZKWQJ8,"An unoriginal amalgamation of rip-offs of more prominent urban crime dramas. The first 20 minutes are fun - the rest of the movie is a drag. Also, the title makes ZERO sense.",1532649600,,174,4.46875

8662931,3,B00KZKWQJ8,"Great cinematography! The story line sounds believe able, but. If you going to make a action gangster film it need to be more violent and bloody with grit film production..",1438992000,,172,4.766666666666667
