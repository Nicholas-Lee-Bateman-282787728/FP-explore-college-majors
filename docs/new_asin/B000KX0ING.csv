2698217,5,B000KX0ING,"I wish many would sit down and watch Shut Up and Sing. I worry that people will like or not like this movie based on party lines and that's disgusting to me---  I became a fan of the DC out of principle and I stayed for the music. This is a wonderful documentary--I gained even more respect for the Chicks while watching and hope they know they have also made a lot of fans over the past three years, as well.  I will buy this movie on Feb 20.",1167004800,8,443,3.966292134831461
2698218,1,B000KX0ING,"Every celebrity's career could be placed on a graph with two lines charting their course.

The first line would be the rise and fall of their careers based on the quality and earning power of their work.

The second line would track the effect of their own self-destructive behavior, whether it be their own addictions or excesses or just their stupid inability to keep their mouths shut.

Tom Cruise, Mel Gibson and Michael ""Kramer"" Richards have seen incredible spikes in their second line this year.

And the Dixie Chicks have not only seen this otherwise frightening line shoot up at nearly a vertical angle--they're riding it with the deranged glee of Slim Pickens at the end of ""Dr. Strangelove.""

If Natalie Maines wasn't so annoying, this could be a Spinal Tap-like documentary.",1166140800,,786,4.924242424242424

2698262,5,B000KX0ING,Great documentary of a great group blocked from country radio after speaking their mind. Dixie Chicks are courageous and talented,1471824000,,129,5.5
2698263,5,B000KX0ING,"How different the world was, not so very long ago.  To speak out publically about our president cost these very, very talent women their careers.  Look what is said today about Obama.  The Dixie Chicks said nothing like the disgraceful comments made by all the racists that have come out of the closet since our great President Obama was elected, and have gained boldness since the coming of the Orangeman.

The movie is great, as is the music.  As much as I like the movie, it left me very pissed off.  Bush. Please.

I purchased two copies.  One for me, one for a good friend in Canada, who knew something about what happened, but not too much.  Remember, it is enough to keep up with our own country, never mind trying to keep up with our neighboring countries. At least, for most, the politics are not followed in depth.",1470528000,,824,4.476510067114094
2698264,4,B000KX0ING,I liked it a lot and I wish nothing but the best for these women.  They really got the short end of the stick.  The lead singer suffered incredibly even though she held strong.,1469836800,,176,4.147058823529412

2698266,5,B000KX0ING,"I saw this documentary in the theater a decade ago when it came out and just watched it again recently. It holds up and is an honest, funny, touching, and scary glimpse of what happens when people are so crazy and zealous that they want to kill you for what you say. It's also a wonderful look at friendship, loyalty, and courage. I said it back in the old days, and I'll say it again now: The Dixie Chicks are brave, bold, and heroic. Oh, and hey, in the end, they won, which is always a nice touch. They're also spectacular musicians. Go get 'em, Martie, Emily, and Natalie!",1468713600,,576,4.293577981651376

2698290,5,B000KX0ING,"This pic made me an even bigger fan of the Dixie Chicks. I love Natalie's impulsive spirit. I also love how she is, at the same time,  pensive and introspective. Couple her hot fire with the talent and cool burn of Martie and Emily and they really can't be beat. I am in awe of how these strong, unshallow,  and unflinchingly honest women banded together in the wake of the ridiculous fallout from a simple, non-menacing, off-the-cuff remark. This incident could easily have shredded the bonds between these women, but they refused to be torn apart or torn down. They took what was rubble at their feet and they built something even stronger and more beautiful than it ever was before.",1464048000,2,685,4.652892561983471

If you don't know the full story of the controversy and you like the Dixie Chicks, I highly recommend this documentary. I found a new respect for the chicks and I think that you will too. If you want to know more about this film I found the following synopsis:

SHUT UP AND SING travels with the Dixie Chicks, from the peak of their popularity as the national-anthem-singing darlings of country music and top-selling female recording artists of all time, through the now infamous anti-Bush comment made by the group's lead singer Natalie Maines in 2003.",1460937600,3,670,4.726495726495727
2698293,5,B000KX0ING,A good snapshot of their highs and lows. Well filmed and not too preachy or pretentious. What it really showed for me is how completely ignorant people in this country can be. It's legal to be so and not a thing anyone can do about it.,1457481600,,235,4.130434782608695

2698295,5,B000KX0ING,"One of the best documentaries I've ever seen!  It's not just political, it's human.  After watching this I have a new found appreciation for a band that I always thought was pretty good.  I'm not saying the Dixie Chicks are ""super special"" but they are good people that got treated badly during a very scary chapter in American history (Americans should not be sheep but were) and kept true to themselves and their loved ones.  We need more people like them!",1455148800,,458,4.617283950617284

2698352,1,B000KX0ING,"They have freedom of speech.  So do I.  Where's my microphone?  Why is your opinion more important than mine?  There was a time in Hollywood when image was everything.  Stars were careful about what they put out there for a reason.  What fans thought was important.  Ms. Maines stuck her foot under the bus and it got run over.  Then bellyaches because she didn't like the response.  People did not agree with what she said.  I have freedom to have an opinion, and that is to not like yours.  If you want to hear how the american public is stupid and country fans are just rednecks, watch this movie.  They had a group of self absorbed weirdo's giving advice on damage control.  Laughable at how rigid they were about being correct.  You know the kind, always an opinion and NEVER a doubt.  They still don't get it.  Don't waste your time.",1430697600,,839,4.456953642384106

2698426,4,B000KX0ING,"I am glad I watched this documentary.  I am one of the folks who was angry at the Dixie Chicks -- and after all these years, I wanted to hear their side of the story.  Glad I did!  And this actually impressed me about how they stuck to their guns against what country music did to them.  I thought this was a well-done movie!",1405728000,,325,4.03125
2698427,4,B000KX0ING,"Watched it with a friend who gave it high marks. Though it was interesting to learn about the DCs and hear some of their music, I found it lacking energy. Giving it a 4-star because I thought it was OK and my friend loved it.",1405296000,,225,4.022222222222222
2698428,5,B000KX0ING,"The Dixie Chicks are an amazing group.  People go to concerts to enjoy themselves and to escape the hardships of life.

2698467,5,B000KX0ING,"My wife hadn't seen this documentary so we watched it this past week and it had been awhile since I had seen it.  I still got just as angry watching it all over again, maybe even more angry now seeing all the changes our country has seen politically since this happened.

In 2003 The Dixie Chicks were on top of the world and the charts and they had done it with traditional country music sounds so contrary to the pop/country hybrid sound you hear on county radio so much now.  They had a bluegrass sound, lots of fiddle and steel guitar and a well harmonized twang.  They were about as country as you could get.  And then we all know what happened after Natalie Maines made her brief comment onstage in London and it still boggles my mind how quickly everyone associated with the Chicks dropped their support.

Now we look back on the Iraq war and the drumbeats leading up to it and see it for the falsehood it was, but in the process these three women and their families went through hell for speaking out against the hurry to drag our men and women into conflict.  It's just a sad and anger inducing commentary on what's happened to our society where no one thinks for themselves anymore and relies on television and radio hosts whipping crowds into a frenzy for ratings and attention.  There's a part in the movie where they say that if you walked up to people on the street and asked them what Natalie said, they probably couldn't recite it word for word - but they could spout off on how stupid the Chicks are, how much they hate America and hate the President and how they should shut up or face violent consequences (including death threats).  The fact that it's nothing for men and women both to say things about Natalie should be slapped or worse, shot, provide a horrifying look at where our society is and how quickly a mob mentality can destroy someone.",1373328000,5,1867,4.451612903225806
2698468,3,B000KX0ING,I support the Dixie Chicks but I did not care for the documentary. Not because I did not care for what the message was conveying but because I did not hear the message and conversations. Often times it was over dubbed with music. Certainly would have been better without this so people could hear and understand the topic of conversation.,1370217600,,338,4.65
2698469,5,B000KX0ING,"I've always wanted to see this but never had the chance. I was happy to see it offered here and grabbed it up. The dvd is really good. It tells the whole story of how the Dixie Chicks upset the world with their comments about former president Bush. I personally don't think they said anything wrong, and think people took things to an extreme afterwards. It was good to see how the Chicks handled the situation, and see what they were trying to do to repair the damage. It is sad that one comment basically ended their careers - for a time - but hopefully, they will all be back with songs on the radio soon.",1369180800,2,608,4.25
2698470,5,B000KX0ING,"Excellent movie, amazing what happened to these girls. We've watched this several time.

We missed her fabulous voice.",1368921600,,295,5.040816326530612
2698471,5,B000KX0ING,I really love this dvd.  It shows that Natalie was way more intelligent than most americans when she said what she said.  Bush was and still is a total liar.,1364860800,,157,4.2
2698472,5,B000KX0ING,"I was always a Dixie Chicks fan. Their last album was one of my favorites. This documentary brings to the inter-workings of the aftermath of what Natalie Maines words said to a London audience. If you liked the Dixie Chicks, you'll see the warts and all that encompassed Maines' the reaction to her words and the backlash from fans and non-fans alike. I recommend this documentary for anyone interested in learning about the backlash, the bands' struggle and eventually you'll be able to understand the groups' demise. Today, as I write the sisters of the group formed their own group called The Court Yard Hounds. I love their music.",1363564800,,634,4.825688073394495

2698504,5,B000KX0ING,My opinion is the only reason people got mad at the Dixie Chicks is they went to another country and disrespected our then president I am all for freedom of speech but don't go to another country and talk bad about the usa or the countries leader do it at home I love this documentary one of my favorites and I am glad we as a nation turned on this person (Natalie) because it just wasn't right to say what she said other then the US if she would have just said that here nothing would have ever came of it no backlash and the chicks would probably be as popular as ever a tough but good lesson learned.,1328227200,,603,4.07563025210084
2698505,4,B000KX0ING,Natalie's voice made me like country music. :) The things she and her band said is what Freedom of Speech is all about. I had to watch this movie for my class. Glad it was an assignment.,1311984000,2,186,4.054054054054054

In my personal opinion its this strength (not to mention the their insane level of collective talent) that is going to give this band the staying power to become legends.  In the documentary Natalie references the band to Bob Dylan and Springsteen and then quickly and humbly makes it clear that she does not hold the chicks in the same regards... I think shes selling herself and her band mates short. Time will tell, but I think these chicks are the real deal.",1274227200,2,698,4.67479674796748

I am a performer of country music,and I have not listened to Top 40 Country Radio in years. Now I know why. I'll just bet that over half of the top country performers felt the same way as Natalie. We are living in a country of idiots. Like I said, the film was pretty predictable to me, but then 3 years later, at the same venue as the Bush remark,she(Maines) says it again! That made me weep.

2698534,4,B000KX0ING,"One of our great challenges as a Democracy has always been the ironic fear of our freedom of speech. One wonders, ""Well, if you say you hate me or have an issue with America or something about America, then you don't love or like or need or want or appreciate it."" Suffice to say: ""leave."" Likewise, we have struggled with the notion of critical dissent in the name of the national good. Both of these are the same coin, different sides, and the great reason Freedom of Speech is the FIRST Amendment of our amazing Constitution. It's concepts, challenges, possibilities and difficulties easily translate to any time. It is greatly worth fighting for and we all must be reminded too of the value of challenging it.
Such is the world of Shut Up & Sing, an involving, smart, inclusive musical/celebrity doc about the abrupt tumult surrounding The Dixie Chicks' Natalie Maines' disdainful remarks about George W. Bush during a 2003 London concert. A mere insulting reference and millions of people, fans and commentators, citizens and families were dramatized and activated into a ferocious communal vengeance, the likes of which few artists or celebrities has suffered. Jane Fonda's outspoken reputation has stayed with her for decades since the Vietnam war, just as she has remained outspoken. Fill in any artist who angers people with their views and you'll get the dynamic that they are too lucky to speak, too famous to have an opinion, have nothing to say because they aren't real, don't know what it's like to be a real American, etc. This is our badge of Speech Reckoning, and it represents our frequent ignorance and polarity as much as our collective pride in active bickering.
We are an opinionated people, we have been raised and taught to speak out and loud, and there is precedent that ruffling feathers makes for a better bird.
Barbara Kopple, legendary documentarian (Harlan County, U.S.A. and American Dream won Oscars) co-directs and produces Shut Up & Sing with the vitality of a fly with a camera who knows she's in the midst of something juicy, warm and important. Unlike some documentarians, Kopple and co-director/producer Cecilia Peck (famous-liberal -Gregory's daughter) are nowhere to be found; smart enough to know the intimacy of the Dixie Chicks' world, it's variety of children and husbands, managers,  musicians, and according members, all aware of the power of their communal securities; a profoundly successful feminine entity that values it's mutual love.
Shut Up & Sing is the kind of doc that would work in school because it begs the question: ""What is Freedom of speech?"" Is it release from responsibility of what one says or is it possibly threats to one's life and livelihood or somewhere in between.",1224806400,,2735,4.971615720524017

To be fair, I was much more into the mechanics of how they wrote and recorded 'Taking the Long Way' than I was over the 'controversy'. There wasn't enough of that for me.

In retrospect, forgetting the change in the view on the war and approval ratings gone south, the furor over 12 words seems a bit over the top.  People heard what they wanted to hear and nothing of what was really said.

And while I defend the right to free speech, on both sides of the conversation, Maines' comments while sincere, they were also light-hearted.  It was the responses that were so venomous and out of kilter to the original statement.  But I'm ok that the Chicks didn't bend or break to what others told them was ""right"" - and they stood together.

While always lively, sometimes it is almost too so. Managers, artists, publicists all talking over each other in heated discussions.  Sometimes it was a bit much, but it was a stressful time for all involved.

I first watched this film on a cable channel.  It proved to me how extremist groups can take things out of context and create suspicion and innuendo, when in reality it was just an American doing what we do everyday--voicing an opinion. Anyone who loves America needs to watch this film.
The music created after these women went through the firestorm of conservative back-lash turned me into a forever fan. It was the music, where they pour out their souls, that originally turned me on.
The film reveals the source of the anguish inflicted upon these American citizens by their own countrymen. It is a sobering, but beautiful film that emphasizes the friendship and love between the three women of the Dixie Chicks.
The actual events, as they happened, will enlighten anyone who has an ounce of intelligence. The film allows me to be there as the events happened, and to make up my own mind, but anyone would be hard-pressed to think that what American extremist groups do is benign or even helpful.
 The sad thing is that the initial result was a condemnation of the Dixie Chicks, when it should be a condemnation of these boycotts for our ""moral"" good.

Maines' statements during the ""The Dixie Chicks"" concert in London, England set off a fire storm amongst their fans back home in the USA, whom thought her statements about President Bush & the Iraq War were unpatriotic. Many music stations stopped playing music recorded by ""The Dixie Chicks"" due to public outrage.

""Shut Up & Sing"" documents the situation and shows how ""The Dixie Chicks"" handled the situation and eventually bounced back in full force on their own terms.

""Shut Up & Sing"" is a touching documentary that places the viewer in the midst's of what the three women whom make up ""The Dixie Chicks"" were thinking and feeling during this time in their lives and their career. ""Shut Up & Sing"" is very well done documentary.

It also shows how their  families, friends and fans were affected by the backlash in the years afterward (not to mention the fine album they were inspired to do as a result of it all). What she did would have been applauded by everyone if it hadn't have been for the fear being instilled in this country in the aftermath of 911. This documentary is proof of the travesty the current administration has made of our freedoms, and how it has turned our citizens against one another in an attempt to get attention away from the lies and crimes they have perpetuated since Bush was elected.

2698567,4,B000KX0ING,"I admit that I knew very little of the Dixie Chicks prior to the media attention they garnered for the lead singer, Maines, offhandedly saying they were embarrassed by the actions of the President the opening night of their tour in 2003 at Shepherd's Bush Empire in London.  Being relatively disinterested in country music I came to the documentary to understand what transpired for them in the aftermath of that public transgression, as it seemed their entire demographic viciously turned on them.  The documentary elaborates on what happened inside the industry as a reaction to those fateful words and how those few seconds affected the band ongoing.  Never underestimate the power of the machine, particularly when the machine is a fascist marketing campaign designed for nothing more than conscripting the patriotic dollar.  That said, there was a silent boycott on playing their music, one that no radio station expressly admitted supporting yet did not deny was no mere oversight.  DJs, themselves, received death threats as did other station personnel (and the band), creating a ripple through a strata of culture that had always been assumed to embody the peace loving easy going allure of country music.

In reality it is the obliteration of those assumed all-American qualities that the band themselves smartly attribute as the reason for the backlash.  The words spoken reflected the thoughts of a large part of the American population with regard to entry into war, but no one expected those words to come from the mouths of seemingly demure team-player girls next door.  The revelation that a few country gals could fathom, let alone speak feelings of disdain toward the governance of their country and its questionable intentions for the rest of the world came as a shock to the good ole boy music network. The wrath of listeners was instant and pervasive, trailing the band through personal threats, diminishing sales, creative process and emotional tribulation into the meager sales of their next release and tour in 2005.

Though the documentary clearly presents the perspective of the band, it is careful not to lead its viewers in assessing what happened and what big business is really about.  The culture of fear presents itself very clearly without having to be explicitly stated.  That said, this is no Michael Moore film with passionate emotional appeal.  You don't have to agree or disagree with the band's opinion or their choices around dealing with the public to be able to understand what happens to real people when they speak unpopular opinions. What shows brightest in the documentary may be the thing most easily overlooked, and that is the solidarity among these women.  They all faced the reality that their careers could irreparably suffer from these events, honestly exploring their relationships to each other along the way.  Their promises of commitment to each other are what stand out.  One of the band members, Robinson, was asked how the band would move on, and she replied, ""When you have seven kids you can't go back to the RV, you can't pile everybody in and go back and play small clubs.""  Global earning status aside, she did not speak of what she would do to keep her children fed.  She did not speak of what the three band members would do to salvage their careers.  She spoke from the place of how their collective family would be cared for through whatever means necessary, even if there was no more band.  It's refreshing to see that despite the treatment of them from their public and industry--and government--they had the perfect opportunity to lash out defensively and did not.  Instead, they maintained their dignity and compassion, and called upon their bond to dictate how to best care for the whole.  While the media may have purposefully sacrificed these three women to distract from what the left hand didn't want the world to see, these three young mothers and musicians went on to recreate themselves and their art with a fierce honesty that when it speaks now is nothing less than intentional.",1200528000,4,4060,4.976331360946745

2698570,4,B000KX0ING,"1 million people gather in the streets of London to protest the war in Iraq.  That night the Dixie Chicks take the stage in that very city and ignite a firestorm of controversy for years to come.  Natalie Maines, the Dixie Chicks lead vocalist, expresses her dissaproval of President Bush and proclaims that they are ""Ashamed that he is from there home state of Texas"".  Soon the international news media gets wind of these comments and chaos ensues.

The film chronicles the events for the 3 years after this controversial event.  Death Threats, Picketting,  and burning of their CD's is the US response to what some felt was very anti-American behavior.  A total boycott of their music happens on country radio and the Chick's number one single, Traveling Soldier"", plumetts from number 1 out of the hot 100 within 2 weeks.  They begin damage control with Diane Sawyer, Larry King, Oprah, Barbera Walters, and any major media outlet that will tell there story.  Bill O'Reiley proclaims the girls are bimbos and they become a virtual dart board for cable news shows.  Maines conveys how important free speech is and that although she regrets the wording of some of her statments, for the most part, she stands by what she said.

This is actually an excellent film.  If you don't know anything about the Dixie Chicks or the exact controversy I would reccomend this film highly.  Although at times you may find Maines political comments to be without responsibility, as the film progresses you meet a very passionate close group of girls.  This film rests on free speech and really portrays the ignorance of many.

What disturbed me more than anything about this documentary is the fact that although our constitution is supposed to support the 'right to free speech' there are underlying politics that want to slap U on the wrist ( or in the case of the Dixie Chicks, band your music ) when U excercise that constitutional right.

It is also disturbing to see how fans can be fickle enough to take a statement ( that was blown up in the media ) out of context and then suddenly want to trash CDs and return concert tickets before a show.
( U will also see how money or the fear of losing it will motivate sponsors to shift their position in terms of support as well )

I must admit that I wasn't really a Dixie Chicks fan until I saw this movie. I have always heard their music and thought they were cool but after going behind the scenes, following the tour and seeing how Natalie Maine's statement changed the lives of the group really hit home for me and now I have a whole new respect for these beautiful and talented women.

The group along with their manager proves in this film that when there is an obstacle in your way, U find a way around it a keep on your musical journey.

I think that everyone who sees 'Shut Up & Sing' will find something of value in it, and be entertained and moved by its content.

2698585,5,B000KX0ING,"In 2003, I was a big country music fan and a bigger Dixie Chicks fan. However, when the ""incident"" happened, I stopped listening to the Dixie Chicks...not because I was mad with them (I agreed with their assessment of the President), but I was exhausted by all the political mess brewing around them. I was more disgusted with Nashville, country music fans, and many of the country stars (particularly Toby K. and Reba M.) who did the exact same thing as the Chicks...voice their opinions on president but did not suffer any of the punishment simply because they supported Bush. Nashville showed the world their ugly side and proved to me they are not the ""Christians"" they claimed to be. Most country artists stayed quiet, but brave ones like Merle Haggard and Vince Gill publicly supported the Chicks during these times. Then there was Howard Stern who blasted the Chicks almost everyday...

Today (four years later), I listen to the Chicks every week, the Dixie Chicks wins 5 awards at the Grammy's; Toby K. backs away from Bush by claiming he is a Democrat, he never supported the war in Iraq and expressed regret over the Chicks flap; other country artists are speaking out about Bush (Faith Hill and Tim McGraw) and others are insisting they are Democrats or Independents. Howard Stern is now a big time supporter of the Chicks.

However, country radio still ignores the Chicks...even though it seems they are changing (slowly) toward the Chicks. For the first time in years, the Chicks are being nominated at country award shows. A great many of Nashville voted for the Chicks to win ""Best Country Album"" at the Grammy's this year. Some country radio stations are trying to put the Chicks back into rotation. Most importantly, the Chicks are more popular and respected than ever before.

It is time for Nashville and Natalie Maines to forgive and move on. In the short run, the Chicks have suffered from the backlash. However, in the long run, it will be Nashville that will suffer. Why? It is clear to me that the Dixie Chicks are the best from Nashville. Listen to Toby Keith's songs, Shania's silly songs, and then the Chicks... you will see what I am talking about.

The more Nashville ignores the Dixie Chicks (especially if their music improves), the more ignorant and out of touch they look. Due to the flap, I no longer listen to country radio or look at country videos... I only listen to artists like the Chicks and Shelby Lynne. However, judging from this video it appears to me that Ms. Maines is still very bitter and she is probably blocking a lot of the healing from being made (her comment about CMT shocked me since they continued to support the Chicks). She and the other girls want to make music (a blend of rock, folk, pop, and country) like Sheryl C., Bruce S. and Bob D. which I think is smart. It will be Nashville's big lost if they let those Chicks go so easily.

I say, the Chicks and Toby Keith should record a duet (full of fire, sass, and forgiveness)...it will warm my heart and I am sure Nashville's heart.",1189641600,11,3044,4.640074211502783

As a case study in exactly that some four decades down the road we have the 2006 documentary, ""Dixie Chicks: Shut Up & Sing.""  Ten days before the invasion of Iraq in 2003 at a concern in London, England, Natalie Maines of the Chicks said, ""We do not want this war, this violence, and we're ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas.""  The next thing everybody knew the best selling music group in the country was being denounced for disrespecting President Bush on foreign soil, supporters of the war were destroying Dixie Chicks albums, Country radio stations stopped playing their songs, and the women appeared on the cover of ""Entertainment Weekly,"" their nude bodies covered with covered with slogans reflecting both sides of the controversy.

What I found most interesting in the first half of this documentary is that nobody ever tries to make sense out of the comment made by Maines, specifically about being ashamed that Bush was from Texas.  I mean we are talking about a state that has the most executions each year, so you would assume it is a state that would extend the idea of justice being served even if it extends to the other side of the globe.  Later in the documentary a woman at a Dixie Chicks concert holds up a sign proclaiming, ""You Were Right.""  But what Maines said had nothing to do with there not being weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and being right for the wrong reasons is not exactly a position you want to take, although clearly the bottom line here is about free speech and the right to say whatever you want in this country without people making death threats against you.  Then again, it was the sentiment and not the specifics that outraged those people who were outraged by what was said.  The initial position of the documentary is not that Maines was right, but that those who attacked her and the other Chicks were more wrong.  However, in the end the implicit argument is that Maines was indeed right, proven by the success of their next&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/album/dp/B000F7MG4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">album</a>&nbsp;if not by what we know about the war in Iraq.

You could tell what side the documentary takes by which side only gets the sound bites.  One guy attacking the Dixie Chicks declares them to be ""Communists,"" probably because that was the worst thing you could call somebody where he grew up, never mind that it hardly seems to apply to millionaire women who go to church.  Another explains that it is wrong to disrespect the president and anybody who does so should leave the country, which makes me wonder how many people left the U.S. because they could not talk about being ashamed by what President Clinton did with Monica Lewinsky (I suspect that number is very low).  When the chief spokesperson for the other point of view ends up being Toby Keith and the debate descends to the level of abbreviated obscenity, the level of discourse hardly seems worthy of speech, free or otherwise.  The documentary even manages to turn Senator John McCain into a Dixie Chick supporter without him ever mentioning their name (but rather by his implying that squelching dissent is not how we play the game in this country).

Ultimately the most interesting part of this documentary is how the Dixie Chicks ended up with a new audience because of the controversy.  If radio stations in the South were not going to play their music then they would head north of the Mason-Dixon line (not to mention north of the U.S.-Canadian border) to keep playing to sold-out concerts.  Normally these stories, whether they are the subject of documentaries or not, end badly for their subjects, and a defiant single like ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" would be the last thing you say before the Dixie Chicks went down for the third time.  But the directors, veteran Barbara Kopple (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harlan-County-U-S-A/dp/B000E5LEVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harlan County, U.S.A.</a>"") and first timer Celica Peck, not only get a happy ending, but see the story come full circle with Maines and the Chicks return ""to the scene of the crime"" in London.  Fans of the Dixie Chicks will root them on through their ordeal, which includes the birth of twins thrown into the whole effort to keep their careers from blowing up in their faces, while those who still consider them traitors are hardly likely to buy the DVD just to be able to destroy it.  The gulf that exists between the two sides clearly continues to this day.

2698601,5,B000KX0ING,"Dixie Chicks: Shut Up And Sing documents the remarkably passionate and hateful backlash The Dixie Chicks band suffered after one of their members, Natalie Maines, made an offhand comment in 2003 about President Bush. As other reviewers have noted, this documentary has no narrator; instead we see their story through filmed interviews with the band members, filmed meetings with their various managers and consultants, and film clips of the three ladies talking about themselves with themselves. The extra footage of their immediate family members and their relationship to the band enhances our understanding of their group.

Natalie Maines had the right to say what she said about President Bush; she said that she was ""ashamed"" that he came from Texas. In this day and age of people becoming increasingly sensitive to people's rights and freedoms, it would seem that one single remark would hardly garner the attention that it actually did. Unfortunately for Natalie Maines and her band mates, the group suffered an incredibly harsh and vicious backlash up to and including a death threat that was taken very seriously by law enforcement at one concert in Dallas, Texas.

This documentary also shows how country radio stations immediately stopped playing The Dixie Chicks' music after they received overwhelming numbers of requests and demands from their listeners to do so. The people in the southern USA were extremely offended and enraged at Natalie Maines' comment about Bush. In the end, even to this day The Dixie Chicks have not truly regained all the ground they lost as a result of one remark Natalie made about Bush.

Something about the film clips of their talks with their manager right after the backlash began struck me as very unexpected: The band seemed clueless as to how to manage the damage control right after Natalie's comments. Because their fan base was furious at them over Natalie's comment; I would think that Natalie should have gone to the heart of the issue by promptly apologizing to the people of Texas and the south for hurting their feelings. Natalie had and still has the right to make comments about President Bush; but I wonder if the group could have minimized their financial losses had Natalie apologized in a diplomatic way to southerners for hurting their feelings. Maybe an apology would have done nothing; Natalie's apology to President Bush certainly had no positive effect for the band.

Shut Up And Sing gives a great example of how fame comes at a high price. As I watched this movie I recalled the storm that raged after John Lennon said that to some kids The Beatles were, in effect, more important than Jesus Christ. Well, just in case you don't know, The Beatles suffered terribly for John's comment with people burning their records just as people were throwing away Dixie Chicks CDs after Natalie made her comment about Bush. Talk about overreaction! If you like the band, stick with them even if you don't like their politics. After all, people pay money to see a band because they like their music--don't they?

The DVD comes with few extras but then again the movie is so thorough, touching and beautifully made it truly needs no extra explanations. The cinematography exceeds my expectations both in the scenes from the live concerts and the scenes in which the ladies talked with their managers and consultants.

Overall, Shut Up And Sing proves that the high price of fame remains a problem for well known people and groups. The Dixie Chicks were, in effect, punished by many of their loyal fan base after radio stations and fans boycotted them after Natalie Maines made just one single comment about President Bush--which didn't even have any expletives! Shut Up And Sing documents the group's struggles to get past this political damage in a way that would save their business and their careers while at the same time retaining their dignity and dealing with the issue on their terms. Obviously, their efforts were only partly successful. My heart went out to them; they paid too high a price for their freedom of speech. Come on, a death threat?

I highly recommend this DVD for anyone interested in The Dixie Chicks and the political side of the entertainment industry. This DVD documents many important aspects of the human experience; and therefore it is well worth the purchase price.",1187654400,7,4353,4.954794520547945

Anyone has the right to say what they feel and people also have the right to choose what they listen to or not but the ignorance of a large majority of Americans continues to astound me.

2698605,4,B000KX0ING,"Just watched an interesting documentary about the Dixie Chicks. While about their music, it also shows the insane ignorance of americans and how the group really stood up for what they believed in when the entire industry was out to ruin them. Granted, it helped that their music was really good. I had never really listened to their stuff, but you don't need to for the film. It delivers even if you're not a fan.

What started a half-jokingly comment about Bush and the Iraqi war at a concert in the UK turned into pure hatred by the Right Wing. What the lead singer said was, ""I'm ashamed the President is from Texas"" was picked up on the AP wire and the media went nuts. The Dixie Chicks were targeted as representing everything that was anti-Bush. As a result, Clearchannel banned all their music from the radio, there were CD destroying rallies and the fanatical portion of the group sent them death threats so they couldn't even tour. In the film, there are interviews of mothers teaching their daughters to say ""i hate the Dixie Chicks."" It is incredible what happened. The Dixie Chicks are country music singers - in America - and to see the ignorance and hatred of other Americans towards them was incredible.

The highlight of the film came when the Dixie Chicks go back to the studio and make the song ""Not Ready to Make Nice."" There's a story of a band member who wrote a song called ""Undivided"" The lead singer (Natalie) asks: ""Does that mean we would have to forgive all those people that did that to us?"" He says, ""Well, for the sake of the song, maybe it would."" Natalie, flinging a dismissive hand in the air, says, ""Nope."" and she instead proceeds to record the title track of their platinum record. It's called ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" and you can feel the emotion when they sing it. Their lives were destroyed - they were banned from the industry that they dominated b/c of their disagreement with the way. The lyrics to Not Ready:

it's a sad sad story
when a mother will teach her
daughter that she ought to
hate a perfect stranger

how in the world can the words that i said
send somebody over the edge
that they'd write me a letter
saying i better
shut up and sing
or my life will be over

I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still made as hell
and don't have time to go round and round and round

One of the Chicks commented on how this song brought her to tears for over 6 months every time she heard the song - and I believe it. These girls went through some tough shit. No country radio station would play their music for over 3 years and yet over an 8 year period, they were Sony/BMG's top selling artist. The movie is a captivating story of a music group's combat against traditional media and politics while at the same time keeping it real and producing really great music.",1184976000,6,2828,4.397705544933078
2698606,5,B000KX0ING,"Was great to find out what actually happened, as we missed a lot of it over her in Oz. Now a few comments on their other videos make a lot more sense. Well worth watching if your a Chicks fan.",1184457600,,192,3.825
2698607,5,B000KX0ING,"I'm reminded of that one song by the Clash, ""Know Your Rights,"" in which there's the line, ""You have the right to free speech as long as you're not dumb enough to actually try it.""

Well, that's kind of what happened to the Dixie Chicks.  At a concert in Shepherd's Bush in the UK, right when the US invaded Iraq, Natalie Maines said inbetween songs, ""Just so you know, we're ashamed that the president of the US is from Texas.""  Amazing right?  This came not from some dreadlocked, loudmouthed, vegan, intellectual, PC alternative woman, but someone who looked so down to earth, real Middle America.

Then came the backlash, the condemnations from those supporting the war and Bush, attacks from Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly, and their being called traitors.  Though apologies were forthcoming, as well as the expected appearances on the TV shows, the damage, or should I say, revamping, was done.  Even their sponsor Lipton got the jitters enough to send a rep down to assess the situation with the Chicks and their manager, Simon Renshaw.  And country music stations across the U.S. boycotted their music. Trash bins and mere foot stomping of their CDs mimicked similar scenes of Beatles records being smashed in the wake of John Lennon's misconstrued remarks about Jesus.  What was it Bon Jovi sang in ""Wanted Dead or Alive""?  ""It's all the same, only the names have changed.""

The photo shoot for the Rolling Stone cover is there, where the Chicks had the hateful epithets by Bush supporters painted on their nude bodies, as well as deserved ones such as ""brave.""  And the Chicks also have their own playful response to country singer Toby Keith, who condemned them as traitors.  Enter the ""F.Y.T.K"" T-shirts--use your intelligence to figure out what that means, but that also led to ""F.U.D.C."" T-shirts, so go figure.

If anything, Shut Up and Sing also brings into the fore the ""fourth Chick,"" their manager Simon Renshaw, who's clearly a significant force here during this turning point in their career.  He's not only a consultant and advisor to his charges, but treats them as equals.
The documentary also takes a look at the band members and their supportive families.  The viewer witnesses Emily Robinson, the brunette, having twins.

If anything, Shut Up and Sing is a well-documented snapshot of the turning point for the Chicks.  In the same way that John Lennon's misquoted remarks about Jesus led to a souring of their US fans, and their retreat into studios for soon-to-be classic albums, Natalie's patriotic remarks has now led them to make the kind of music they want, as they lost their traditional fan base to whom they no longer answer.  Hence a quick look at the making of songs for their Grammy-winning album, Taking The Long Way Home, including a trip to see producer Rick Rubin (Beastie Boys, Slayer) Yes, there's that feisty crown jewel, ""Not Ready To Make Nice.""  And the lyrics to ""The Long Way Around"" recall what happened since their Home album, with references to their tour:  ""It's been two long years now.  Since the top of the world came crashing down, And I'm getting' it back on the road now,"" and ""Well, I fought with a stranger and I met myself.  I opened my mouth and I heard myself.  It can get pretty lonely when you show yourself.  Guess I could have made it easier on myself.""  Well, I'm sure glad she didn't, for our sakes.  And the intercut footage of Iraq war deaths and polls showing disapproval for the war gives evidence that Natalie, among others, was right.

Whereas country fans have been traditionally conservative, working class, and southern, Natalie's free speech led that bedrock to toss them away.  But it redefined who their fans were, those who stuck with them, meaning a more progressive kind of country fan.

If you love the Chicks and their music AND support what Natalie Maines Pasdar said, shut up and watch this movie.  If not, just shut up.",1184112000,8,3911,4.783904619970194

2698609,5,B000KX0ING,"This is a moving and very engaging look at the controversy that proceeded after lead singer Nataile Maines [of country trio The Dixie Chicks] made a desparaging comment against President George W. Bush, in between songs, to a British audience.  She said, without batting an eye, that she was ashamed that he was from Texas (where the Dixie Chicks are from).  This led to a 'landslide' [to paraphrase one of their songs] of antipathy and retaliation.  Perhaps what was most shocking about this comment [for some people] was that the lead singer from a band that played country music [a genre that is popular particularly in the conservative states in the USA] would utter such an anti-Republican [and perhaps anti-American?] comment.  When Maines said this, it was 2003.  Bush's popularity was at an all-time high.  Our latest war on Iraq, with the intention of locating weapons of mass destruction, was considered a national duty, in the eyes of many [particularly, those who had family and other loved ones who agreed to go into the Middle Eastern nation to defend our nation's honor].  This was before the gritty truth emerged some three years later.  Many country radio stations refused to plays the Chicks' music, people boycotted and threw away their albums and there were multitudes of protests in front of [and inside] the performing arenas during [and prior to] their performances, as well as far more disturbing acts [or threatened acts] of livid rebellion against them.

Through footage of Maines and her fellow chicks, shot over the course of three years (2003-2006), Maines and her brood of chicks (Emily Robison and Martie Maguire) stuck together through the media speculation and overall nastiness that arose from one statement uttered in the United Kingdom, that erupted into a political and media spectacle.  Barbara Kopple [Harlan County USA, American Dream] really captured these women in a very candid and honest light.  You have to admire Natalie Maines for her brave fortitude and irrepresible spirit in the face of such hatred and nationalistic uproar, landing on her and her bandmates in such a relentlessly unbridled way.  We also see how they took that energy and made it their fuel to write all of the songs on their latest album, TAKING THE LONG WAY.  In fact, the song ""Not Ready To Make Nice"" draws from Natalie Maines' experience with the press, following her controversial statement.  This is a great documentary about the state of freedom of speech in the United States (Post 9/11) and a very gutsy musician who unintentionally disrupted a nation, a political system and pop music as we know it, through simply speaking from her heart.",1183420800,5,2667,4.99097065462754

Their music was boycotted by CW radio stations, their CDs were smashed and burned. Their intelligence, patriotism and musical talent were attacked.  ""Just shut up and sing!""  I think the issue here is not freedom of speech or whether George W. Bush deserves criticism.  Nor even whether entertainers should make political statements.  In fact, only a year before Natalie Maines stated her opinion, Willie Nelson jibed in an overseas interview: ""[Bush]is not from Texas and he ain't a cowboy, so let's stop trashin' Texans and cowboys!""  Willie got a laugh at the time and some grumbles from the ultra-right.  But CW stations continued playing his songs, and his concerts and albums are still popular.  The difference between Willie Nelson and the Dixie Chicks is image.  Willie is, after all, the outlaw and rebel whose outspoken ""ornriness"" endears him to bikers and truckers, cowboys and convicts.  By naming themselves ""chicks"" -- cutesy, ditsy, fluffy little featherheads, sex-objects, ""prey"" -- the Dixie Chicks made it difficult for anyone to take them seriously. ""Chicks"" aren't smart enough to have political opinions; ""chicks"" should know their proper place!  ""Just shut up and sing!""  But Natalie Maines dared to suggest ""chicks"" might also be eaglets. Their music, songs, voices are quite good, if one could get past the self-denigration of the band's insipid name.

I think that because country music is a particular American music and that perhaps only fans of this kind of music in France must know them. Not being a particular fan of country music, I was delighted by their music and have listened it hundred of times in my car.
I think that if they would be known in France that they would sell a lot of CDS!

The irony is that the reason the Dixie Chicks were banned, saying things against President Bush have, have been avenged by almost everyone realizing what a travesty this administration has been. Bush is in fact connected to my state and I too am embarrassed that he has connections here. The Dixie Chicks stuck together and didn't let the naysayers get them down.

2698615,4,B000KX0ING,"The galvanizing effect of one offhand statement from singer Natalie Maines on a London concert stage in 2003 turned the Dixie Chicks, the highly popular crossover country-pop trio, into a corn-belt pariah and a lightning rod for anti-Bush sentiments. Veteran documentarian Barbara Kopple, along with co-director Cecilia Peck (daughter of Gregory), cover the incident in question with minimum fuss in this 2006 film, but what they do quite well is show how much effort it has taken the group to ride the firestorm and get their career back on track with the music. Kopple and Peck spent three years with the band, and the resulting sense of intimacy makes this one of the better backstage-type documentaries.

The film's chief takeaway is that the sisterhood between Maines and bandmates Emily Robison and Martie Maguire is genuine. As they ride the torrent of death threats, hate mail, boycotts and plummeting record sales and canceled tour stops, they never appear at serious odds with each other. There is one honest scene where Maguire suggests that she and her sister separate themselves from the remark to minimize the impact, but they all eventually realize there is more strength to be had in staying together through it. Much of the intractable bond has to do with each woman's efforts at balancing work and family, and a lot of credit seems due to their longtime manager Simon Renshaw.

Unsurprisingly, Maines come across as the sharp-tongued, unapologetic contrarian of the group, a fountain of impulsive outbursts, but her instincts often prove right as they find triumph with their last album produced by the indefatigable, comeback-savvy Rick Rubin, who looks and acts a bit like Brian Wilson during his acid-saturated days. The mob mentality that builds against the group provide the most visceral scenes in the movie, although given the trio's abundant talent and the fact that most of the protests were concentrated in the country radio market, one can't help but feel there is something of a tempest in a teapot about the whole story. Credited to no less than seven cameramen, the cinematography is vivid, and the print condition on the 2007 DVD is pristine.

2698618,4,B000KX0ING,"Co-directed by Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck, SHUT UP & SING is the documentary spanning the lives of one of the most popular women's singing groups of all time, The Dixie Chicks, from that fateful concert in London in 2003, when Natalie Maines quipped that she was sorry that the President of the United States was from Texas, up to their concert tour in 2006. Singers like Joan Baez, Barbara Striesand and Judy Collins have always made political statements from the stage as well as in their songs. The difference here is that in 2003, when Maines made her statement, most of their fans were country, Republican, lovers of George Bush and not really big on diversity or opinions that differed from their own. How the Chicks' story played out is pretty much old news now. They were banned from country radio stations around the country, irate citizens made a great show of destroying their CD's (fifteen minutes of fame?). Then the criticism moved to another level when they started getting death threats. So much for freedom of speech.

There is a lot of footage of these three women with their husbands and children. Sometimes they are silly; at other times, serious but always they come across as extremely likeable. The important thing of course is that they never backed town. The film ends with their returning, as they say, to the scene of the crime in 2006, in the same hall in London, where Maines figuratively thumbs her nose at George Bush once more by repeating her original comment. They now have a different if smaller audience and a new CD with the winning song ""Not Ready To Make Nice."" So they paid the price for standing up for what they believe in, something that few media types, who wouldn't let the story die, and even fewer national politicians would ever have the courage to do-- unless their position pleased a focus group. (Can you imagine a Lincoln or a Roosevelt convening a focus group?) Of course about 70% of the American public has come around to the Dixie Chicks' position and now has the same opinion about the Iraq War as they do.

2698619,4,B000KX0ING,"Open mouth.  Insert foot.  Lament the consequences.

By now, we have likely all heard the statement by the Dixie Chicks during a 2003 concert in England that they were ""ashamed that the president was from Texas.""  Clearly, the band was unprepared for the public relations firestorm that ensued.  Unrepentant, they continued to exhibit a disdain for the president, all the while acting outraged and hurt that people take issue with their statements.

Poor, poor Dixie Twits.  They said a boo-boo and now some people are mad at them.  Imagine that!  Sorry, it's hard for me to buy into martyrdom for the Twits.

It seems that the Dixie Chicks are totally for freedom of speech, but would prefer to silence those who might criticize them for intemperate remarks.  We must recall that the statements were made just as the United States was preparing to go to war in Iraq.  The presumed weapons of mass destruction had not yet been proven to be unfounded.  The mood of the nation was in no way receptive to publicly dissing the president, regardless of what you might think about him now.

The most trenchant comment perhaps during the movie was made by a senator during a hearing, who observed that the band and entertainers must realize that such statements have business consequences.  You are free to venture from the realm of music into politics in your public statements, but if you do so, you had better be prepared as well for the backlash from those who disagree with your position.

Perhaps the Dixie Chicks would have been well served by calling in a professional media or public relations consultant to help them stem the tide and limit the damage.  Instead, they seem to be guided by a well-intentioned but fawning business manager.  It is difficult to fathom the Chicks' sense of outrage and shock over the tsunami of indignation that greeted the remarks.

Duh!!!

Whether Americans agree or disagree with the incumbent president, they do not like entertainers standing on foreign soil expressing public shame over at the current White House occupant.

What the film is effective at portraying, however, is how immensely talented this trio is.  Whether you agree with him politically or not, they make beautiful music.  (am I the only one who thinks that Natalie Maines' swept back hairdo makes her look a lot like David Bowie?)

I began the movie not being a particularly big fan of the Dixie Chicks' music.  I left the movie being a fan of their music ... but not necessarily of their political philosophy.",1180224000,,2517,4.824766355140187
2698620,5,B000KX0ING,"First of all.....

WOW! Great documentary!

 I have been a Dixie Chicks fan since 1998, and still fully support them. They are WONDERFUL musicians. Have never disappointed me at all with their beautiful music. When this whole controversey broke out, I just sat back and could not believe the hatred the American public brought forth. To be honest...it DISGUSTED me. I could not believe that people could be so hateful. The Dixie Chicks expressed an OPINION and were knocked down for it. Yes, everyone has the freedom to disagree with what the Dixie Chicks said...but what was done and is being done to the Dixie Chicks has gone WAY TOO FAR. What made me really sad was that people who were parents were getting their very young children involved! How SICK is that? I have 2 young children, and have tried to teach them to not be prejudice towards anyone or anything. For example, my daughter, who is almost 9 years old doesn't really understand why people are/were so hateful towards african americans. I have tried to explain it to her as best as I can, but she still doesn't get it . I AM happy to say that her best friend in the world right now, is an african american girl....so I must be doing something right. :)

Okay, I am getting off track here.....sorry. I am still baffled about this whole thing with the Dixie Chicks. To me....all that matters in the end, is the MUSIC.",1179878400,6,1381,4.556451612903226
2698621,4,B000KX0ING,"I'm not a fan of the Dixie Chicks although I'll acknowledge their huge talent and I always enjoy their music when I hear it on the radio or happen to see them on a TV special.  Back when Natalie Maines made her infamous remark at that concert back in 2003, I thought it was tastless and I disagreed with the timing of the remark at least as much as with the content of what she said.  (I wonder how many of those same ""right wing"" people who got so angry back in 2003 would have reacted the same way if this had not happened until 2006, when conservatives started getting fed up with the Iraq war too.)

That said, I found it really hard to hate them for what she said and I really didn't think of it much until this movie was released.  I got this DVD out of curiosity without great expectations, and I was genuinely surprised as how much I enjoyed it.  Much of the film is not about the Chicks vs. George W. Bush, but rather about their day-to-day life, their families, and the music business.  I found it all interesting.

The Dixie Chicks may be brilliant musicians, but the superstars of this ""rockumentary"" were the people who edited all the film clips together to tell a story without narration.  This can easily not work, and I've sat through documentaries where it doesn't work at all.  Of course, the Chicks' music as a soundtrack made it all the better.

If there's one thing that puts me off about this product is the tag line, ""Freedom of speech is fine, as long as you don't do it in public.""

All I saw was everyone doing what they have a right to do (with the exception of the death threat, which is criminal activity and completely wrong, but it isn't like the Constitution was amended to take away anyone's freedom of speech).

Natalie Maines certainly has a right to criticize the president, her fans or former fans, and other musicians.  And, those who disagree with her have the right to protest and boycott the Chicks' music, and radio stations have the right to play or not play what they choose.  There's plenty of freedom to go around.  Is someone's Consitiutional right to freedom of speech somehow abrogated when Southern traditionalists use the same tactics to make their voices heard as others have used for decades?  I don't think so.

So, tagline notwithstanding, this is something worth seeing.  Unless, of course, you're still mad at them.  In fact, if you are still mad at them you might view this film anyway and find yourself lightening up a little bit.",1179705600,4,2489,4.4911111111111115

2698625,5,B000KX0ING,"In America, entertainers are allowed only the opinions that their fans agree with, at least that's the way it seems at times.  That's to be expected after all, anytime an entertainer ventures out of their area of performance they become vulnerable to ridicule - think Charlton Heston being ambushed by Michael Moore for his NRA leadership or Barbra Streisand, mocked for her liberal fundraising.  But when you contrast the fifteen words at the core of the incident with the intensity of the backlash, the experience of the Dixie Chicks is far more unique.

Fifteen words... ""Just so you know, we're ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas.""

""Shut up and Sing"" documents the moment itself; Natalie Maines making an off the cuff remark at a concert in London.  They were not shouted in firebrand defiance.  Heck, they were practically mumbled, followed by the now obligatory post-Viet Nam statement of the obvious that ""we support our troops.""  Yet the Chicks were pilloried by an industry, country music radio stations that refused to play their music.  Concerts were cancelled and they received death threats, genuine death threats.

This could have been just another run of the mill, behind the scenes documentary of a concert tour, one meriting a three star rating.  But those fifteen words and the maelstrom that followed provided a story worthy of four stars.  But the fifth star is earned through the integrity and willfulness of Natalie Maines, Emily Robison and Martie Maguire.  They refuse to alter or back off of their opinions - a pleasant contrast to 99% of the collection of individuals seeking public office.

I'd like to think that Shut Up and Sing might serve to get a few people to back off and lower their Chicks-related vitriol, but I'm not optimistic about that.  What's more likely, is that music fans that were previously inclined to dismiss them as just another C&W act are far more likely to admire them as people and maybe... just maybe discover that they are excellent musicians deserving of applause for their performance.

If you have any doubts about the emotional price paid by these women, consider one particular pre-concert dressing room scene where ""credible"" death threats have everyone particularly edgy.  Natalie Maines leaves a message for her psychic, asking if she has any particular feelings regarding Natalie's safety.  It's poignant and very revealing, followed by a seemingly carefree performance that flies in the face of anyone dumb enough to dismiss  these women as ""just chicks"".",1179100800,8,2544,5.045454545454546

I doubt that the late-night comedians would look to that for their fodder. Since then, and prior to her appointment as Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi has said worse! This is as fine an example of ""timing is everything"" as one could imagine.

It was fascinating to watch the evolution of the Dixie Chicks's response to their critics, and more so, for this reviewer, to listen to their critics as they boycotted them back in 2003. I wonder how many of those who were holding signs supporting Bush would hold those still today? Quite a few, I'm sure, but to fall from a 70-something approval rating to a 30-something approval rating means that you've lost the support of not just moderates and some liberals, but a decent chunk of your core followers as well.

While I knew about what had happened - who didn't? - I had never given it much attention. It shouldn't have come as a surprise to me, yet it did, how the Dixie Chicks were completely shunned by country radio. It also struck me as interesting that as liberal as they are, that they were so immensely popular amongst a population that is as conservative as they come in the music industry.

It's a very well done documentary, even if it is one sided. But that's fine, because the ""other side"" had their chance to burn their CDs, boycott their music, send out death threats - it's the Chix turn now.",1176940800,9,1503,4.518382352941177
2698635,5,B000KX0ING,"Watching this documentary on the Dixie Chicks' struggle to come back from redneck hell is almost as eye-opening as Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth and Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11. Unfortunately, the group of folks who coined the phrase ""Shut Up & Sing"" are the very same people who have supported George W. Bush's administration and have put down everybody that hasn't supported the war in Iraq as unpatriotic. It seems like eons since this war began, and the country that had become so divided is finally showing some signs of intelligence. Well, intelligence may be too strong a word, but at least the country is finally coming around and seeing this administration for what it is. Unfortunately for our troops, it's not fast enough.

The documentary begins with the comment that started the firestorm between Dixie Chicks and Middle America. The Chicks were on a London stage in the midst of their 2003 ""Top of the World Tour"" when (in between songs) lead singer Natalie Maines uttered the line, ""I'm ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas."" That was it. No major reaction except a cheering crowd of Brits, and what they believed to be a passing thought became headlines around the world. Almost as quickly as she spoke that line, the Associated Press wire picked up the statement which sent shockwaves to right wing zealots around the world, but mostly in this country's Bible belt. Within days, Middle America was up in arms about their beloved trio of talented women, sisters Emily and Martie Maguire and Maines.

What to do? Almost reminiscent of when John Lennon made a passing comment in 1968 that the Beatles were more popular than Jesus Christ, which led to an outpouring of ""fans"" smashing and burning Beatles records all over the country like a public slaughtering denouncing the Fab Four, all due to a statement that was made in jest. A decade later, Rock fans were incensed that Disco had become a mainstream musical empire that was associated with many things they could not tolerate, which included the gay community and their embrace of the musical genre. What did they do? In 1979, the infamous `Disco Demolition' at Cominsky Park Baseball Stadium in Chicago, Rock fans indulged in a ritual record burning frenzy. When you look back in history, it's always the people who preach the Bible, but break every rule with the violence that is set forth to make their point. The word ""hypocrite"" almost seems too appropriate.

After the ban at Country radio (which was a decision made immediately after the comment), the Chicks' endured everything from public humiliation to being shunned by their own peers. Musician Toby Keith went onstage night after night publicly humiliating Ms. Maines for her statements, which in turn fired up the ignorant slobs that made up his audience. Then it turned even more personal with a death threat made on Natalie's life, right down to the date of her execution. What happened next was an apology from Maines to the President, but she never felt quite comfortable going against her instincts just to save her music career. Finally, she made another statement taking back her apology, which made them eager to write music that would make a statement for them.

The result was the brilliant 2006 album, Taking The Long Way, which was the first time that the Chicks wrote an entire album of their own. The songs were personal, the songs were harmonious, the lyrics and the melodies were married and the production was handled by mastermind Rick Rubin. The results were spectacular. The only problem was who would hear this album? Their fans and the radio stations that once embraced them had now branded them as traitors, and there was really no place for them to turn, except television. The Dixie Chicks began doing every television interview they could squeeze in, including getting their first single, ""Not Ready To Make Nice,"" played on the more liberal-minded VH1 music channel. The video was as stunning as the song and stayed at #1 on the popular channel for a record 20 weeks. Their song and their album may have been shunned by their old fans, but in turn they gained new fans that not only agreed with their political views but also started digging the music that made up this fabulous album.

Taking The Long Way debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200, and I'd like to say the documentary ended on the highest possible note. However, after witnessing last week's Grammy Awards, with Dixie Chicks winning all five of the categories they were nominated in, (including the highest honors of Song, Record and Album of the Year), the real ending (which, of course, was too late for this film) was their honored recognition, vindication for how these three women stood up against all odds. America has embraced this band not just because of their political observations, but because the music truly stands on its own merits.

I wanted to say that this film ended beautifully, but considering it arrives on DVD just nine days after their stunning Grammy sweep makes it that much sweeter. Enjoy!",1176940800,4,5068,4.859953703703703

It was the off-the-cuff stage banter heard round the world. I dare say that Natalie Maines, the Dixie Chicks lead singer who made the comment, wouldn't have thought twice about it had it not been for the knee-jerk reaction of the red-state right-wingers who have, since day 1, blindly backed the President.

Maines made the comment on a stage in London (the blasphemy!) in the spring of 2003 just days before President Bush started the Iraq War, and just hours after thousands marched the streets of London in protest against the coming conflict. The result (here in America) was a boycott of the group by country-music radio (that is still in effect today, for the most part), public demonstrations in which Dixie Chicks CDs were crushed, and death threats made against Maines' life.

The original intent of filmmaker Barbara Kopple (""Harlan County USA,"" ""American Dream"") was to make your basic documentary about a popular singing group - in this case one the biggest selling female groups in the United States. But after Maines' comment, Kopple took a detour and the resulting film, ""Shut Up and Sing,"" is a compelling and superbly made behind-the-scenes story of the Dixie Chicks' three-year journey between the London concert and the release of their latest album ""Taking the Long Way.""

Kopple does a superb job of capturing the determination of Maines and her fellow Chicks, Emily Robson and Martie Maguire, to stick to their guns; their refusal to give in to the public and corporate pressure to fall in lock-step behind this President. Their refusal to be brainwashed, as were too many Americans during the run up to the Iraq War in 2003, tested the group in many ways. ""Shut Up and Sing"" captures the essence of the tried and true friendship of these three women during those turbulent years. That friendship sustained them through the long ""post-London"" period, and it is what sustains them still today. Their loyalty to one another epitomizes the meaning of the words ""friend"" and ""family"" - words the administration of George W. Bush and their ardent supporters will never truly understand.

Four-years later, with the Iraq War in shambles and the President wildly unpopular, the tried and true right-wingers still boycott the Dixie Chicks. But in losing those fans, the group has essentially found a new legion of them. Their passionate and emotional single about the whole affair - ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" - went gold (in a day and age when few singles sell enough to be certified gold) and ""Taking the Long Way"" climbed to the # 1 spot on the national album chart.

I had always been a Country Music Fan and I was appalled at what Country radio was doing and assuming that all Country music fans thought like them. We are not all alike. This was an eye opener for me to the point that I supported my son no longer going to a College in the South to study music and be around more Country music. I had introduced him to Country music. Those hateful people calling Country radio to bash the Dixie chicks did not even listen to Country music. Before this documentary was made it upset me that Country radio (or those Country artists not supporting the Dixie Chicks) assumed that all of us Country fans were alike. I could not believe that NO country artist would come out and ask fans not to break CD's. There were exceptions and I thank them. We, who are less conservative, are actually taken for Granted by Country radio and perhaps even Country artists. I always had Country radio on in my car but now I don't.

2698646,5,B000KX0ING,"I have to get this out first: I'm not a country fan. And when I say ""country"", I mean the Keith Urbans and Shania Twains of the world; the new people. Included along in this list is the Dixie Chicks since I haven't really been able to get into the music they do at all. My sister however is a massive fan and I decided to rent the film for her to watch (she loves it, of course) so I figured ""well, nothing else to do, might as well put it on too"". What's in the film though is quite interesting even though it might not convert people into Dixie fans.

The film begins innocently enough with the Dixie Chicks (composed of Natalie Maines, Emily Robison and Martie Maguire) starting their tour in support of their album ""Home"". During a gig in London, England, Maines says (with irony and a giggle) that she's ""ashamed the President of the United States is from Texas"". It's met with cheers and applause but America sees otherwise as it is ""Bigger than Jesus"" all over again with the girls getting music banned from radio and more shockingly, a death threat against Maines. The film jumps back and forth between 2003, the height of the backlash and 2005/2006 when they're recording their latest album, ""Taking the Long Way"".

One gets the feeling while watching that you almost can't believe just how many people got bent out of shape over it. Yeah, saying stuff about the war in Iraq or President Bush might not go down so well but for it to get as far as it did is kind of baffling. Artists and even actors have said worse but as Maguire says in the film ""it just had to be us, ""America's girls"", it's perfect"". What also got them attention was the fact that they're a country group and they were supposed to maintain a certain redneck-esque persona about everything. I'm actually surprised by how vapid Toby Keith sounds on a radio interview and you realize they meant what they said; it's just after all of the other cries of anti-war and anti-Bush, they were picked as the loudest.

As for the film for a Dixie Chicks fan, it's kind of dual-sided. You get more intimate looks at each one (including one for you Heroes' fans: Natalie's husband plays Nathan Petrelli on the show) and even recording their last cd. However, we also get the girls uncensored as some of them swear and there's even talk, twice, of oral sex. While the young ones will gravitate to this film, keep in mind this is a documentary and radio has them more tamer than they are so consider it a slight warning. But we also get some big personal moments such as Martie breaking down on camera or the atmosphere after a death threat is sent to Maines personally.

Even if it's a documentary, you'd at least think there would be more special features but we get nothing. A commentary, either by the director or the girls themselves would be nice or stuff on the cutting room floor would add to it but nope. But still, even if you're a Dixie fan or not (like me) it's still an interesting look into someone making the right statement at the wrong time.",1175472000,3,3022,4.43963963963964

Having known the story, I didn't think I'd get much out of this film.  Boy, was I wrong.  On a whim, Natalie blurted out what a lot of us were thinking, and it is interesting to see the ramifications of that from the eyes of the Chicks and their manager.  This movie had me laughing, rolling my eyes, and in awe at different moments.  It was wonderful getting a glimpse into their home life, and seeing how they dealt when they really were scared that their livlihood (and their lives) could be threatened over something so benign.",1175472000,4,669,4.362903225806452

I can't believe the crap that these three ladies had to put up with due to the comment that Natalie Maines made.  I understand the reason behind the fact why they made this movie, I just didn't really like it.  I seemed like an extended music video...which had already been made.  I like the Dixie Chicks, their music, and especially their opinion of a certain US president but I just didn't like their film.  The Dixie Chicks were ahead of some of their audience in recognizing the disastrous nature of the war but many in that audience have now caught up with those sentiments and the Dixie Chicks have broadened their audience and their music since then.",1175040000,4,913,4.536585365853658

While I was shocked when I first heard about the now infamous ""statement"", it in no way ever detracted from the fact that Natalie, Emily and Martie were, and continue to be, the most talented and entertaining trio of ladies in ANY genre of music.  It was so nice to see them with their husbands and children.  Although I knew of the death threats, the film really brought home what these ladies were going through.  The film does a great job of capturing their emotions, as well as the dilemma their sponsors and management faced in trying to ""fix"" everything.  I can understand Natalie's reluctance to shy away from making country records, but I agree with Martie when she said that the new CD is country.  If they decide to move on to another genre of music, all I can say is, it is country music's loss.  Chicks Rule!",1174780800,5,894,4.481481481481482

2698664,5,B000KX0ING,"I loved this documentary about the Dixie Chicks and what they went through after Natalie Maines made a statement about their feelings about George Bush right before the war in Iraq was started. The backlash against this wonderful group was truly uncalled for. They had every right to speak their minds about how they felt but the way country music fans, radio and TV reacted (for the most part) was so over the top that it was hard to believe. The Dixie Chicks never said that they did not support the troops.

At the time of Natalie Maines statement I really didn't give it much thought. I thought the war in Iraq was needed and necessary as did most Anericans. 4 years later after all the lies we have learned about I feel completely differently and can only admire the Dixie Chicks more for taking a stand against a completely foolish and unnecessary war that has caused thousands of deaths and was all for NOTHING.

I only wish the documentary had been able to include the triumph of the Dixie Chicks winning 5 much deserved grammys for their latest album to show how they have come full circle and triumphant in the end.",1174608000,5,1125,4.536945812807882

But after viewing it several times, this documentary is about so much more than the Dixie Chicks.  This is a behind the scenes look at how a statement made by an American caused this American to not only be criticized, which is other American's right to do, but actually be threatened with bodily harm & DEATH!!  From Other Americans!!  Isn't that what free speech is all about?!?!  Anyway, this film gives you a glimpse into the lives of the Chicks, their families & how they struggle to maintain some sense of normalcy in their otherwise abnormal lives.

This film shows the full range of emotions: disbelief, anger, fear, self-doubt, love and loyalty. Ultimately it's not about the politics. This film is about overcoming.

I find myself musing--what if they'd sailed through the past few years without this particular bump in the road? (Bump is an understatement, grant you.) Would they have grown full of themselves? Bored and creatively stagnate? Would they have fought, broken up, gone off on solo careers? I feel like this experience had to have made them stronger and closer.

This is definitely a film worth watching!",1174435200,5,704,4.9576271186440675

Obviously I had heard about the controversy that Natalie caused when she spoke that infamous line in London (who didn't?), but I had no idea the extent to which people in the United States went to voice their opinions and opposition.

What struck me most about the protests and things that people, who didn't agree with Natalie (and Emily and Martie) did, were the really nasty things that they were saying, like Natalie should be strapped to a bomb and dropped on Sadam or Iraq...do these people not realise that Natalie was as free to express her opinion as they were?  Fair enough, she's in the public eye and therefore her opinion carries a bit more ""weight"" that most people's, but he opinion is as valid as anyone's!

As for the death threats...........??????  I'm not very politically minded, but even I had an opinion about what the President was doing at the time.

The documentary shows the women in a very human light.  They didn't bow to pressure from the media or from the Country Radio stations and ""stuck to their guns"" (pardon the pun).

In my opinion, and I hope I'm not threatened for saying this ;-), they were right to voice their opinions and were right to do this documentary.  It shows everyone that watches it what they and their families went through, by the reactions and actions of quite a few narrow-minded individuals.

However, they documentary also shows the great support they had from their true fans and that the Chicks weren't going to let those fans down by not doing concerts or by simply giving up and hiding in a corner.

The Dixie Chicks rock and as long as they continue to do what they are good at, which is almost everything (and all you have to do is remember that they won 5 Grammys this year), they will always have fans, here in Ireland and all over the world........

Even if you are not a Chicks fan, it is worth the money, it explains how the girls dealt with all the crap they had to endure from the right-wing crazies. The girls stuck to their guns and I am proud of them. I like the one part where they had  clips of Rummy, Cheney, Bush and Powell all saying we know where the weapons of mass destruction are, and the girls had a public relations advisor telling  them, the war couldn't be going better, Bush has sky-high approval ratings, the looting will stop and reconstruction will begin, things look good for the President.

Their emotions run the gamut as they weigh the advise they receive from multiple sources.  In the end, though, they hear their own inner voices more loudly than ever, follow that beat, and come to understand what it means to be in a band, to be a friend, and ultimately to be an American.",1174003200,6,600,5.175257731958763
2698677,5,B000KX0ING,"OK, so I've led with a title of a Prince song for a docu-rock-umentary about the Dixie Chicks but it kind of sums up this great flick...sign of the times.  I don't think it's reaching too high to say that the rockumentaries that summed up what the 60's cultural scene as it relates to music are ""Woodstock"" and ""Gimme Shelter.""  Are the Dixie Chicks Janice Joplin's, Jimi Hendrix's, Joan Baez, or the Rolling Stones?  I don't think so.  Are they three ultra-talented, genuine, truthful, powerful, and powerfully beautiful women and gifted musicians?  Most certainly.  ""Shut Up and Sing,"" not only covers the political bellwether that is the reality across America and the Global War on Terrorism, but also covers the more intricate things of art...the creative process that gives artist the therapy to let it all hang out and tell it true in music.  The documentary is a gift and a time capsule all in one.

It all started with a sentence said by Natalie Maines at ironically enough the Sheperd Bush concert hall in London on the eve of the Iraqi war, and the detour begings.  A sentene opened up a brand new life, a brand new career, and a brand new message for the three country-Texas bluegrass musicians that go by the Dixie Chicks.  Now there is something a fiction writer would be hard pressed to come up with.  But it happened.

I'm not sure when our culture expected music entertainers (or entertainers period) to be responsible in their political comments.  The day we start relying on the Toby Keith's of the world, the Eddie Vedder's, the Susan Sarandon's, and the Ted Nugent's to give thoughtful analytical commentary on world and domestic policy instead of the Tim Russert's, Wolf Blitzer's, and Diane Sawyer's is the day we should probably hang our hats up head out to the barn or the back 40 and give a good mental check on where we are at whilst kicking a bunch of cow poop.  It doesn't make sense to try to make entertainers pay consequences for a single sentence said in a concert in London.  But it happened.

So interestingly enough, Natalie Maines, says in the flick, paraphrased mind you, ""When you compare us to the Bruce Springsteen's or the Bob Dylan's...""  She went on to be humble by saying she wasn't trying to say the Chicks are on that level but I think time will tell.  It's possible.  When Natalie Maines sings, ""It's a sad sad story when a mother will teach her Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger / And how in the world can the words that I said Send somebody so over the edge / That they'd write me a letter Sayin' that I better shut up and sing Or my life will be over,"" it has to be one of the more powerful honest and emotional music moments that has been cut to CD in a long time.  I'd put up the Chicks, ""Taking the Long Way,"" next to ""The Times they are-a-changing,"" or ""Nebraska.""  There I've said it...debate to your heart's content.

So we get to see the seminal Dixie Chick's Dallas show in American Airlines Arena and are unveiled a behind the scenes peek as the Chicks go from receiving a mailed death threat saying they will die in Dallas to bravely putting up a ""show must go on,"" moment as they play the big D.  I can't help but drawing another analogy to a soldier leaving home to a dangerous place in the world...a travelling soldier knowing that harm could come his or her way but still saying goodbye to family and friends, still putting boots on hostile ground, still facing potential sacrifice for something they believe in.  It's a powerful thing and ""Shut Up and Sing,"" is a powerful documentary.

The Dixie Chicks story is really a story about you and me in these difficult times.  It's about overcoming adversity for something you believe in.  It's about sticking by those that brought you to where you are even if it means giving up your career, your chosen way of life, your lifestyle.  These are times that ask for sacrifices.  These are times that create some sublime art, as it seems all tumultuous times do.  These are times made a little more bearable to the music and vision of the Chicks O' Dixie.  When Eddie Vedder skewers a George Bush mask on a stick while performing, ""Bushleauger,"" no one bats an eye.  When one of the Chicks spouts off about not being too happy that she is from the same state the President is from (not once but twice mind you), well it begets some CD burning parties reminiscent of censored moral majority book burnings with a Kristallnacht flair.

Whatever your beliefs about Natalie Maines' attitude, don't miss on the Chicks' music.  Don't miss out on giving yourself a chance to make up your own mind instead of letting the New Republic, Pat Robertson, Toby Keith, or Country radio do it for you.  ...mmw",1173916800,9,4717,4.555160142348755

2698689,4,B000KX0ING,"""We're ashamed the President of the United States is from Texas"". With these words spoken at a London show, thus began a long fight between the Dixie Chicks and Republican Country music fans. Branded as traitors and Anti-Americans, the Chicks suffered the heat resulting from freedom of speech. This documentary shows their descent and their return to the top as the biggest selling female group of music history.

I wasn't a fan of the Chicks when I went to see this in theatres with my girlfriend last fall (I'm more of a Rock n' Roll and metal type of guy) but I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary. I'd heard and seen on the news the whole incident involving the Chicks back in 2003, but I hadn't followed it. I couldn't believe that in this day and age, people could get so offended by someone's opinion, done jokingly, nonetheless. The radio ban, death threats and name calling are eerily reminiscent of book burning and McCarthy's Communist-hunt.

You witness the girls' fall and how by sticking together they survived what could've been the end of their career. They started writing songs to put themselves through the tough times, bringing in producer Rick Rubin to help them change musical direction as Country music was no longer the proper target audience for the band. The result was something different that made new fans discover their music and allowed them to pursue their journey stronger than ever.

Filled with heartfelt testimonies and an intimate look behind the scenes at the lives of the three Chicks, Shut Up and Sing is a documentary that will appeal not only to Dixie Chicks and Country fans, but as well as to a wider, more general audience. A poignant moment is the performance of their song ""Not Ready to Make Nice"".

It distracted (and offended) my puritanical mother to the point where she lost sight of what was really going on.  This was sad because I think she would have been moved by the story.

Personally, I'm glad this documentary was made.  It is powerfully entertaining, It is even handed and in the context of telling a good tale, it raises some important questions about American values.  In this case a small group of political yo-yos, (with no sense of what is really going on), create a straw man and beat it to death.  An incident that should have been a blip turned into a life distroying terrorist attack on the band.

Natalie and the band show great strength and resilience- I would use the word ""heroism"".  I am very impressed with Natalies leadership skills and courage.  Her straightforwardness shows us a remarkable woman, who doesn't dodge the truth, and has the courage to carry on even after being badly wounded.  If this were a shooting war, instead of an dirty charactor assassination, she'd get a medal of honor!",1173312000,9,1343,4.6440677966101696
2698691,5,B000KX0ING,"I remember how upset I was the night we went to war in Iraq. Natalie Maines spoke FOR ME and so many millions that no stage to stand on. This freedom of speech looked for a mintue like it be the end of the dixie Chicks and yet Natalie never changed her point of view. As it became clear it was not a point of view shared by their current fan base, it didn't change their views. THEY STOOD STRONG! How many of us would put our own life on the line for something we believe in? I only hope I would, but they did, and Admire these ladies so much. Nothing made me happier than to see them sweep the grammy awards with my faviorte song in years ""not ready to make nice"".

2698692,5,B000KX0ING,"This isn't just another movie about a musical group weathering the storm of a boycott - it's really much more than that.  I found the interpersonal dynamics of the ""girls"" (as I am told their friends in Texas refer to them) to be utterly fascinating.  There is a lot going on here that deserves repeated viewings.

Consider that immediately after Natalie Maines made her now famous joke in London, Martie McGuire's reaction back in the dressing room was to suggest that they just disavow her comments.  It's actually rather surprising that the two sisters decided to stick by Natalie in the boycott, except when you realize that Natalie is now really the creative talent behind the Dixie Chicks.  Emily's comment about how a lead singer can threaten to go solo is extremely telling.

I was also very surprised at how much they worry about their careers, and how they fear that if a record doesn't sell well, they might have to go back to the small stage.  These are adult women with large families: a lot of mouths to feed, and not just itinerant musicians.  Not anymore anyway.",1173225600,7,1078,4.696808510638298
2698693,4,B000KX0ING,"First I love the Dixie Chicks, as people and as musicans.

This is basically a typical, but well done, movie on making of thier new album. Of course the ""twist"" is Natalie's comments and the reactions that it caused and how that all got reflected in the music and lyrics of the album. That ""drama"" of course make this more than just a movie filled with intersting factoid for fans (which I would have watched, it was nice knowing Charlie Robinson loves his wife enough to even go to LA for her). The drama that the Dixie Chicks went though was deep, and reflected the country's debate about the war in Iraq and is a very intersting story no matter where in politics you may lay. But it is intertwinded with factoids that really only fans will care about.

So for fans of the music, for those who whish to know about the events that have lead to the Dixie Chicks being banned from country music this is a nice film. But nobody should confused it with a great documentary.",1173052800,2,970,4.383333333333334

2698695,5,B000KX0ING,"This documentary illustrate more than just how the Dixie Chicks struggled through the aftermath of a throwaway line by Natalie Maines and went on to reinvent themselves. It shows in dramatic fashion how a boycott of the bank by many of their fans took an ugly turn, when some used the events to physically threaten the Chicks. There is a point in this movie where the fear shown by the Chicks as they take the stage at a concert in Dallas is palpable. You can't help but think back to Dallas in 1963. What is not known but is brought out in the film is how all this was orchestrated by a right wing think tank, and carried out by no-nothing country music stations.  The Dixie Chicks were opposed to the war from the beginning but they were not really political activists in the sense of a Joan Baez. The film also casts a negative light on corporations that sponsor such groups but htat is nothing new. What is new is just how difficult it can be to not only change your style but carry on with any sort of normalcy and family life. You can't help after seeing this film to have great respect for all three Dixie Chicks. That came through loud and clear. I did not follow the Dixie Chicks until this episode happened. Since then I bought their latest album - ""The Long Way Home"", and it is a powerful musical message especially after watching Shut Up and Sing.",1172966400,4,1360,4.375494071146245
2698696,4,B000KX0ING,"This DVD of ""Shut Up and Sing"" is far more entertaing than I anticipated. Rather than a ""band movie"", this is a a terrific documentary about how an off the cuff comment by a band memeber in the heat of a concert turned them into musical pariahs. This is not about a music group, it is about the bond that women develop that men have never developed. Watching the Chicks evolve over five or so years following the comment that almost detroyed their careers is a lesson far beyong anything political; we learn how mundane their comment was and how the uproar was orchestrated by an obscure fringe group. The candid footage of how and whether to respond was fascinating, and I found the issues much larger than a question of musical censorship and the ease with which one/s livelihood may be desfroyed. Recommended for those with no interest in music or country music, but concerned about the vulnerability of anyone to those in power.

My two cents: one of the most inspirational, and powerful, aspects of this movie was, to me, the obvious ""sisterhood"" between the three Dixie Chicks. Clearly, they love and respect one another, and it's no surprise that, once freed to do their thing their way, their last CD is so wonderful! Rock on!",1172880000,5,463,4.860759493670886

I'm from Texas, and I'm ashamed to be from the same state as the president!

This DVD likewise is amazing.  It works on so many levels.  It's political, personal, musical but ultimately revealing and inspiring.  Your politics or music preference are not even relevant to your potential enjoyment of this or the album.  They are just that good.

2698701,5,B000KX0ING,"This documentary, now available on DVD, follows the Dixie Chicks on their journey from the ill -fated  concert at Shepherds Bush Empire in London in 2003, where Natalie Maines spoke out against the upcoming war in Iraq, through the ""Top Of The World"" tour, the song writing, recording and promotion of their new album ""Taking The Long Way"" to the triumphant kick off of their latest tour with another concert at Shepherds Bush.

The film documents the impact that Natalie's words had, in terms of the immediate effect on their career and record sales, the refusal of country radio to play their songs, the effect on ticket sales and the public reactions ranging from street protests and CD trashing to death threats.

The words that caused the uproar were as follows:

(Natalie to UK audience) ""Just so you  know we're on the good side with y'all- We do not want this war, this violence  and we're ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas""

No matter what you feel about these words or about the war or the Dixie Chicks, it's worth seeing the film as it examines issues of free speech, American attitudes and values, patriotism, the conservatism of country radio, the effect on sponsors and the Dixie Chicks' treatment by the media.

As the Dixie Chicks start to work on their new album ""Taking The Long Way"", with Dan Wilson of Semisonic helping them write and Rick Rubin in the producers chair, the film also provides a fascinating insight into the development of an album through the song writing process, the recording sessions (some of which are at Sunset Sound (which is featured often)) and the promotional process. It also gives an candid insight into the Dixie Chicks changing attitudes to the whole thing and also gives some glimpses into their family lives.

With this latest album, the Dixie Chicks moved beyond their country base and developed a more rock-based sound, ultimately being rewarded with 5 Grammy awards (including, ironically, best country album and best country performance by a group). In a way, they were starting again with a new audience and this film shows the process they went through in order to do that.

I thought it was a very well made, thought provoking and interesting documentary.",1172448000,6,2243,4.83289817232376

2698703,4,B000KX0ING,"Shut Up & Sing is an in-depth look at The Dixie Chicks' struggle three years ago after lead singer Natalie Maines' now-famous phrase ""We're embarrassed that the President of the United States is from Texas."" Mumbled during a performance in England, and almost unintelligbly, to the point that in the film that portion is subtitled, these few words almost destroyed their entire career. Or did it allow them to be reborn?

That's the central question. And from their Grammy win it seems like it allowed the band to start over and build from the ground up the kind of band they wanted to be. What Shut Up & Sing shows is three strong-willed women who didn't ask to be brought into a political battle, but that didn't shy away when they were forced.

As Natalie Maines herself said, ""I didn't think anyone would really care what I had to say about anything."" The Dixie Chicks found out, as we all did through the media, just how right-wing the country music industry is and how unforgiving its listeners are.

The editing in this film is a little strange. The film starts in 2003, leading up to the phrase, jumps to 2005 as they're recording their new album, jumps back to '03 for a little while, back to '06, then back to '03 before finishing in the present. This leaves the audience a little confused, and I think the story could have been told a little cleaner, but that doesn't take away too much from the actual story itself.

Strangely the DVD contains no special features. Usually with a documentary there's a little featurette with a current update, or with some additional information.",1172448000,2,1591,4.6512455516014235

It's made with the same love and care, and it illuminates the Chicks themselves (who turn out to be amazing, outspoken artists with wonderful music) and the troubles they went through regarding an offhanded comment about the President.

The fact that they turn out to be right in the end makes this film all the more poignant and ultimately triumphant, as witnessed by their 5 Grammy wins and (still) multi-platinum sales.

I couldn't wait to go out and buy the Shut and Sing dvd. After watching the dvd I now have more repect for the chicks than ever. To me they are a positive roll model. They stuck to what they believe in no matter what anyone was saying. How the whole thing was blown out of potion was ridicules. This dvd shows them not just as artist but as a human reading a death threat, mothers and wifes. It was nice to see them with thier families. Emily and Martie could have left Natalie hanging but the sisters stuck with their friend through it all. That to me that is true friendship. This dvd also shows some rare emotions from the girls espically at the end when Martie was talking about how if Natalie wanted to quit she'll be there for her. I'm glad that didn't happen. Because I work on a cruise ship in Hawaii I missed the Grammy awards. But when I read in the paper that they won FIVE OF FIVE GRAMMY AWARDS I was so excited that I was jummping up and down, espically with the country album and duo award. The girls truly deserve it.

2698711,5,B000KX0ING,"""Shut Up & Sing"" follows the fall out from the infamous comment Dixie Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines made in 2003. Along the way they got banned, burned, and threatened. What's amazing is this took place in 2003, not 1953. You watch the film and find it amazing that so called ""fans"" would turn on them so quickly. I know people who fall into that category and to this day will not listen to the Chicks' music. The film is an interesting look at how one off the cuff remark turned into a major turning point for the band. The film stops just short of seeing the success of the ""Taking The Long Way"" album.

 If you are a fan of the Chicks, check out the film and see what they went through. If you were once a fan, check it out, I'm betting you don't realize how ugly things actually got. You may not like them, but you have to give them credit for standing tall and moving on, it might have been easier to just give up.

2698712,5,B000KX0ING,"This little five foot woman makes a benign remark about Bush, and millions of rednecks go nuts! Not only did these ""freedom loving"" American's want to stop listening to the Dixie Chicks, they demanded that they be SILENCED. Other entertainers made far stronger statements against Bush, and his war, yet no one seemed to care.

These women who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in the past for numerous American causes, were suddenly deemed female Benedict Arnold's, or even worse ""Jane Fonda's,"" oh my!! Did I miss the part in the constitution where American;s can't be critical of the president when they are in England? What federal statute did Maines break?

The good news is that the attempt by the right wing lynch mob to put the Chicks out of business, has failed miserably. The Chicks just swept the Grammy Awards, have an album that spent several weeks at #1 last summer, and just completed a tour that in spite of initial trouble selling tickets, ended up grossing more than thirty million dollars, and being attended by over five hundred thousand fans around the world.

[...]
""Shut up and Sing"" is a great documentary. Not only is it informative, it is also very funny in parts. Natalie Maines has a wicked sense of humor. Sadly, those with an axe to grind take what she says in jest and use it against her. Just look how nuts the Chicks' haters got over the ""heh heh"" remark at the Grammy's? Jeez folks lighten up.

When you finish this film, you will truly wonder what happened to the country that you once knew. The rabid Dixie Chicks haters clearly confused the concept of boycotting, with demanding CENSORSHIP!

""Taking the Long Way"" did not win the five Grammys because of ""liberal Hollywood."" It was the best album of 2006. Nashville's top music critics voted it ""Country Album of the Year"" two weeks before the Grammy's.

Natalie was exercising that freedom, perhaps you didn't agree with her opinion, but you should defend to the very end her very right to speak it.

2698727,5,B000KX0ING,"I am an American living in Canada and I saw the movie when it was released in Victoria. The movie was fabulous. It was an honest depiction of what ensued after Natalie's simple statement. What made my viewing experience even better was the cheering, clapping, and ultimately standing ovation at the theater. The Canadian crowd LOVED the movie.

I must say there were many times during this movie that I could feel tears welling up in my eyes. I took my daughter to see it (warning there are some curse words) and she really liked it. Afterward, she wondered why it was such a big deal for Natalie to make a statement. Even for a primary aged kid, she was aware of Freedom of Speech and the reaction just didn't make sense to her.

The best thing in the movie was to see how the Chicks drew strength from one antoher during this ordeal. I think that so much of the reaction to the statement was gendered. Yes, the US was going through this pseudo-patriotic time, but the ways in which the DC were attacked often was filled with sexist tropes.

I'm buying this movie as soon as it comes out and will be showing it in two of my classes. One class looks at globalization and the other is a gender and politics class. I think the nativist and xenophobic reactions by some of the ""haters"" will cause interesting discussion in class.

Overall, I'm hoping that more people will come to enjoy their music and respect that they stood by one another. I can't wait to see them again in concert. I'm a long time fan of the DC.",1170979200,50,1513,4.392857142857143

Well, you are in luck, because ""Shut Up and Sing"" is a documentary focusing on that very question.

It all began with a little zinger, a bit of nothing really, directed at some president or another.  But... that zinger irritated me.  You see, I like my music with soul, but hold the politics, thank you very much.  When ensuing boycotts were bandied, I was amused.  Turnabout is fair play.  But then something spooked the herd and... good God, the entire genre of country music went stampeding off a cliff.  I was not amused.

""Shut Up and Sing"" makes us all Dixie Chicks.  Through the camera's eye, we become one of the girls as they move from slinging free speech, to receiving free-flowing hatred, to shifting into (my favorite) a reasoned, measured fight mode.  Along the way we discover that the Dixie Chicks are loved wives, loving moms, supportive friends, amazing artists and... the target of crackpot death threats.  Who said that was okay?

America didn't.  I didn't.  And I bet you didn't either.

From this evolution of events, we witness the genesis of the next Dixie Chicks album ""Taking the Long Way.""  With producer Rick Rubin, the Chicks put voice to their American experience.  The top of the charts and five Grammy nominations followed.

2698732,5,B000KX0ING,"I recently went to see this documentary at a local upscale theater in my home town.  Being a huge fan of the Dixie Chicks, I was so anxious to see this film.  Knowing that the directors of this film had won numerous awards for previous political documentaries was an added bonus because I knew this would be done in truth.  It was such a moving documentary.  These girls are strong beyond belief.  Their friendship is something we could all learn from...but mostly their passion for not backing down, for standing FIRM on what they KNOW to be ""right""; and doing the above mentioned, arm in arm.

This documentary shows EXACTLY what happened on the day that Natalie made ""the comment"".  News media should hang their heads in shame for blowing this whole ordeal SO far out of proportion.

We also get a peek inside the lives of each girl (husbands, children, etc) and a glimpse inside the studio (writing, recording, great discussions).

One of my favorite parts was when the families got together to go trick or treating!!!

It's a wake up call for America, this DVD!

I was a huge fan LONG before any of the other crap, and continue to be, not only a fan, but a supporter of these incredible ladies!",1169510400,5,1199,4.55607476635514
2698733,5,B000KX0ING,"AS THE COVER SAYS, THIS MOVIE MAKES YOU WANT TO STAND UP AND CHEER!  AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS ALSO MOVING AND  AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING LOOK AT CELEBRITY, POLITICS, AND AMERICAN CULTURE.  DEATH THREATS FOR MAKING AN  OFF-HAND COMMENT THAT WAS NOT INFLAMMATORY UNDER ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION.  AND IN THE LAND OF THE FREE?! CRAZY,FRIGHTENING, AND JUST PLAIN WRONG.  YOU MAY ALSO WANT TO CHECK OUT A GREAT OLD BOOK ENTITLED ""FREE SPEECH FOR ME, BUT NOT FOR THEE"" BY NAT HENTOFF.",1169164800,2,481,4.6
2698734,5,B000KX0ING,"This was an amazing documentary showcasing not only the extreme backlash this talented band experienced following the infamous quote against the President, but it also offers a rare glimpse into the band's personal lives and the making of one of the best albums of the year. The girls are honest, funny, and amazingly strong in the wake of the London concert, and if I wasn't a fan before I certainly would be after seeing this film.

One of the best documentaries this year, and a must see for any fan of talented musicians and the first amendment.",1169078400,3,549,4.65979381443299
2698735,5,B000KX0ING,"The film is an inside look at their lives following the ""incident"".  The Chicks have such a bond and love for each other that was very apparent in the film.  It was disgusting to see how ugly our narrow-minded society can be when you speak out.  Death threats, mothers teaching their children to hate the Chicks and how scarey the growing radio conglomerate ""Clear Channel"" has become by censoring what they and the far right believe should be censored, reguardless of what the fans want to hear.  I hope people that are not sure what the hud-bub was about will view the documentary and see how innocent 13 little words spoken at a concert was twisted and turned in to a media frenzie.  I was lucky enough to find a local theater about 12 miles away that was  showing this documentary.  I was afraid I would have to wait until it came out on DVD.  Again, censorship is alive and well in the USA.  I think there were only 2 theaters in the state, that I am aware of anyway, that were playing the film.",1168819200,5,1000,4.3621621621621625
