8569846,5,B00BK6HRY0,"This work has brought me endless hours of delight. Meant to be a counterpart or continuation of the Magic Flute by Mozart, it is intriguingly different and infinitely rewarding. I have seen and heard things in this opera, that I have never heard before. This composer Von Winter needs to be better known and more frequently recorded. Seach him out for his instrumental music too.",1407974400,,379,4.846153846153846
8569847,5,B00BK6HRY0,"Not Mozart, rehashes The Magic Flute's plot, obnoxiously racist (but historically highly appropriate) makeup for Monostratos and his minions--none of that matters. We loved this production. The costumes are brilliant, the sets highly effective in a minimalist sort of way, the performers attractive and highly talented. It's just great.

Blu-ray really pays off here, with lots of detail to be seen in the fabulous costumes (ignore the occasionally highlighted wrinkles on Pamina's brow and the seam at the edge of Monostatos' wig--not every detail of a production can be optimized for extreme closeups like this).

Why is Tamino wearing a belt saying ""Ewig Schade"" (""eternal shame"")? Because the singer's name is Schade. An in-joke you probably wouldn't get sitting out in the audience.

This opera is extraordinary for how many thrilling choral and ensemble numbers it contains.

This is a shortened version of the opera, but it lasts two hours and thirty-eight minutes. Anybody know what's been left out? There's a minimum of spoken dialogue compared to Die Zauberflte.

There's also a credit for some orchestral rearranging--not clear how much or what kind.

There's a useful review of this production at [...] which is a bit more critical, but adds useful information. The audibility problems noted by the reviewer are completely overcome in the recording.",1384387200,2,1361,5.306976744186047

In my earlier review I missed what now seems to me the most important point.  Das Labyrinth is an attempt by von Winter to combine Mozart's ornamentation with Beethoven's future larger orchestra.  While this makes for some very exciting music,  the demands on the singers are overwhelming at times.  Later, Wagner eliminated ornamentation in favor of an even larger orchestra, realizing that dramatic singing and ornamentation are not a good mix.  As a sequel to Magic Flute story wise, Labyrinth is not very illuminating, however as a transition to Beethoven's Fidelio and Weber's Der Freischutz this is very exciting.  With the exception of Julia Novikova's Queen of the night,  this production is very well cast.  Malin Hartelius as Pamina, in my opinion, is a great choice  even though she is more a lyric than dramatic soprano.  Her dramatic voice is not as beautiful as her lyric voice, however it is effective.  In the more lyrical parts she more than compensates for her shortcomings in the dramatic parts.  I was relieved to hear a podcast of Haydn's The Seasons with her in Cleveland recorded after Das Labyrinth.  Her voice has not been hurt by occasional dramatic roles.  Older singers can explore dramatic roles that would hurt younger voices.  Hence the wisdom of Hartelius and Schade as Pamina and Tamino.

The labyrinth Pamina is a more forceful character who is evolving musically into Leonora in Fidelio.  Mozart's Pamina needs to be rescued,  Leonora rescues her husband.  This Pamina to Leonora evolution is detailed in a book that explores the psychology of opera characters, unfortunately I cannot remember the book's title. Pamina's great aria is similar to Leonora's in style and difficulty.  Not every note is perfect, but the total effect is wonderful.  I feel the same way about Gundula Janowitz as Leonora with Bernstein.  Flagstad could sing everything Beethoven and Wagner wrote and make it sound easy, but Janowitz gives more dramatically because she really sings at the edge of her ability and like Hartelius has wonderful insights.

Schade really gives Tamino some personality lacking in some Magic Flute productions.  Christof Fischesser is a good Sarastro in voice and looks the part.

The Three Ladies are fantastic in their ability to sing well while performing every Freudian move one can imagine.  I am not a fan of dumbing down opera by acting out every thought implied by the text.  The stage direction for the three ladies is over the top,  but at least there is no underware or nudity.

Papagena and papageno are well sung by young singers Regula Muhlemann and Thomas Tatzl.

New characters, not in Mozart's Magic Flute, the evil Tipheus king of Paphos and his friend Sithos are expertly sung and acted by Clemens Unterreiner and Phillippe Sly.

Julia Novikova Blasts her way though much of the Queen of the night.  Her anger often has no nuance and is just annoying.  Worse, she oversings and is vocally out of control. Von Winter is partly to blame for expanding her role.  Mozart made his Queen of the night more effective I think by keeping the role concise.

Much worse in a sense is von Winter's expansion of Monostatos.  One lonely outcast Moor was not enough, now we have four.  In my opinion, this production looks for trouble by having Monostatos plus three Moors in blackface.  Schikaneder's libretto is more racist than in The Magic Flute because Mozart was not there to give monostatos a chance to explain himself.  I wish the production had softened this visually as Bergman did in his Magic Flute movie.  There monostatos is portrayed as a generic clown.  I took off 3/4 star for this and 1/4 star for Novikova.

Bolton conducts in a dramatic way that makes this difficult opera more difficult for the singers, but also keeps it moving.  I am reminded of the Solti Ring which I have a love / hate relationship with.  Other conductors like Furtwangler, Bohm and Leinsdorf bring out more detail, and Wagner has lots of detail to  explore. Yet I return often to Solti for the power.  Von Winter is not as profound, so Bolton goes for power and this works. Bolton does give us some very beautiful soft passages as well.  Hints of von Weber and Beethoven abound.

The engineers have removed the lousy acoustics of the courtyard and generated a spacious sound which really shines when the chorus sings.  The Salzburger Bachchor not only sings beautifully but they act well and are fully involved.  The voices come through very well in solos, duets and ensembles without robbing the orchestra of power leaving no clue to the bad existing acoustic and high background noise that marred the broadcast.  In my opinion DVD listeners with good audio systems get a better sound than the live audience did.

Despite all this opera's limitations and demands every one is fully committed to giving all that they can give.  Unfortunately Das Labyrinth does not answer any significant questions posed by the Magic Flute.  We do meet Papagano's large family which gives us a very colorful scene.

Some of the costumes are very creative and beautiful.  The Three Spirits costumes are the most spectacular as they appear to be illuminated from the inside.  The three boy sopranos sing beautifully.  The choir is dressed in what appears to be modern evening wear that is off the rack.  Unlike many Salzburg productions this one is at least somewhat evocative of the opera's era.

Finally,  This is an uneven work, but the high points make this a worthwhile DVD, especially for insights into the creative evolution of musical style.",1367884800,7,5590,4.894456289978678
8569850,4,B00BK6HRY0,"Such is the supremacy and brilliance of Mozart's the Magic Flute that it's tempting to think of Peter von Winter's sequel as something of a novelty.  Written in 1798, only seven years after the original, both librettos were however the work of the same man, Emanuel Schikaneder, so in reality there's no reason why Das Labyrinth (full title - Das Labyrinth or The Battle with the Elements, Part Two of The Magic Flute, a grand heroic-comic opera in two acts by Peter von Winter (shortened version)) shouldn't be seen as a legitimate work on its own terms.  Rossini's Barber of Seville after all is a worthy prequel to Mozart's Marriage of Figaro since both works are drawn from the same source in the plays of Beaumarchais.  De Winter's opera likewise is no novelty, but rather a fascinating work that has languished in obscurity for far too long.  It's still nowhere near on a par with The Magic Flute, but then what is?

Well, it has to be said that unfortunately Das Labyrinth does indeed try too hard to be the Magic Flute, and on that level it can't help but struggle.  Schikaneder's approach to writing a sequel for an immensely popular success is much the same as the one usually employed by movie studios today.  He and de Winter simply repeat the formula of the original with emphasis on the bits that the audience enjoyed the most.  The central element that drives the plot doesn't initially appear to differ greatly from the original.  Picking up straight after the events in the Magic Flute, the Queen of the Night - who is apparently called Luna, we discover here - is plotting alongside Monostatos to get her daughter back and marry Tipheus, King of Paphos.  You didn't think she would give up that easily, did you?  As an entertainment this is a foolproof method in as far as you get to see these wonderful characters revived and put through new situations.  On the other hand, without Mozart to bring his unique vision to the work and dignify the libretto with some internal musical consistency and his deep humanism, the plot of Das Labyrinth more often feels like a lot of random incidents haphazardly strung together with little in the way of originality.

There are just as many musical references to match the familiar plot elements, with plenty of glockenspiel playing, Papageno bird whistles and acres of pseudo-Mozart arrangements.  The music is consequently often quite light and charming, even if has none of the memorable melodies of Mozart and little of the composer's carefree imagination, grace and dignity to elevate the pomposity and the silliness of much of the plot.  Ivor Bolton however conducts this work with just as much respect, affording Von Winter's compositions the same loving care and attention that he would Die Zauberflte.  This certainly contributes towards making Das Labyrinth feel truly Mozartian and consequently a more interesting work than it might otherwise have been.  At the very least it makes this a delightful curiosity that's hard to resist.

The production at the Salzburg Festival isn't quite so compelling.  The costumes are lovely, but the sets are not the most suitable for the work.  These are limited to some extent by the venue, which is the open-air courtyard of the Residenzhof, meaning that there is only room for a few narrow platforms and an all-purpose backdrop.  The backdrop consists in the main of a wall of lights, which is nonetheless versatile enough to represent the canopy of stars of the domain of Knigin der Nacht, flicker with storm effects, and break up into columns to represent the labyrinth.  It comes into play more as the evening darkens, and there are a few nice additional mechanical effects such as Pamino seated on a crescent moon, but it is otherwise quite limiting.

Christof Fischesser is a wonderful Sarastro, his warm and comforting tones assuring you that this is a character who is powerful and can be trusted.  Michael Schade's lovely lyrical tenor similarly presents a warmer and more sympathetic Tamino than is often found in the Magic Flute, and that's all to the benefit of Das Labyrinth.  Julia Novikova cuts a suitably impressive figure as Luna, Queen of the Night, but she struggles a little with the challenging coloratura that has been written for the character's extended role in this work.  As Pamina, Malin Hartelius often finds that the tessitura of the role is beyond her comfort zone and the timbre of her voice isn't always the most pleasant at those heights.  She seems to gain in confidence in Act II however and handles her individual arias quite well.  Thomas Tatzl is an excellent Papageno and Regula Mhlemann a charming Papagena.

The Blu-ray release of Das Labyrinth is region-free with subtitles in German, English, French, Spanish, Italian and Korean.  The filming isn't as polished as it might be, but undoubtedly there are difficulties presented by the unconventional location.  The video looks reasonably good even though it only uses a BD25 disc.  The audio tracks however are excellent, with good wide use of the surrounds on the DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 mix.",1365552000,7,5091,4.890570430733411
