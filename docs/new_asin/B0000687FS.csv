7963823,5,B0000687FS,Super nice dvd worth my 40 bucks for 1 cd. Totally Awesome series hard to find and worth collecting. I don't have kids and if i did they could watch but never touch my Sagwa dvds!,1458432000,,179,4.0
7963824,5,B0000687FS,"My boys (5 1/2 and 3 1/2) LOVE this.  I have not been able to sit and watch it start to finish with them, so I can't explain why in great detail.  The gist I pick up on is that it's a bit like Daniel Tiger or Sofia the First where there is a social lesson to be learned, some times guided by grown-ups but often not. I am very pleased -- I avoid violence and my older son can be sensitive, so longer DVDs (for a car trip or when I occasionally shamefully need the digital babysitter) can be hard to find.  They both truly love it.",1436313600,,530,3.888888888888889
7963825,5,B0000687FS,"My daughters, aged 5 and 2, both like to watch Sagwa.  My 2-year-old especially loves Sagwa (we have a cat with similar coloring to Sagwa) and we decided to make her birthday party Sagwa themed.  The shows are unique, creative, and enjoyable...and appeal to a wider audience than apparently was intended.",1117756800,3,304,4.9411764705882355
7963826,5,B0000687FS,"My child who is 12 believe it or not even enjoys this show (aimed for younger children).  It has very cute kittens, FANTASTIC animation for children, morals, chinese culture, and adventure! I suggest any Sagwa product for children!",1029196800,8,231,5.078947368421052
7963827,5,B0000687FS,This is a good childrens show to watch. it teaches you many lessons while you follow Sagwa's many adventures.  The show teaches you many Chinese traditions which I think is fantastic.  If I were a parent this would be one childrens show I would have my kids watch.  The DVD is great. You will enjoy the many adventures of Sagwa.,1027382400,5,328,4.433333333333334
