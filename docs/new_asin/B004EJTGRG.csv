8427072,5,B004EJTGRG,"I am blessed to be a homeschooling parent as well as a movement education specialist.  Four years after co-creating this series I'm still happily hard at play, writing, schooling, and teaching and I'm still delighted and awed every time a parents writes, emails, calls or stops me in the hall to tell me how terrific these DVDs are and how much their kids love them.  At our co-op we have the entire set available for check out each week.  For munchkins 3-8  years of age the stories capture the imagination and set their hearts racing one moment and then sets their feet on the path to drawing down, cool, calm, and confident the next.  These yoga adventure DVDs are cardio and intentional movement, self-care and self-regulation, yoga, Brain Gym, Thai Chi, Vision Therapy, and a healthy dose of pure fun.",1400112000,,806,4.728571428571429

8427074,5,B004EJTGRG,These DVDs are so much more than just yoga. Children learn a whole new vocabulary around their emotions and learn how to self-regulate using the Adventure Skills taught in each video. Emotional resilience is vital to healthy emotional development and these DVDs support emotional stability beautifully.  They are perfect for home or classroom use.,1398643200,,347,5.425925925925926
8427075,5,B004EJTGRG,my 3.5 year old was really into the stories told in this DVD series.  He spent far more time watching these than other yoga DVDs we tried.  He'd imitate the movements afterward.  I found it enjoyable as well and gave me a good help to reinforce what to do when we feel sad or angry!,1334620800,,282,4.090909090909091

Move with Me Action Adventures 2010..'
Through story-based exercises, the instructor takes viewers through a warm-up, a story with movement segment, a relaxation exercise, and a skill review wrap-up on each of these DVDs. Viewers follow along with the fun yoga-like moves that perfectly complement the adventure story being told. The instructor and a small group of children giggle and smile their way through the exercises. Children pretend to be different animals and perform various movements as they listen to the tales of a boy and his scooter and the adventures they have together. Designed to encourage physical, cognitive, and emotional development, the program should help children learn how to channel their emotions through flexibility, strength, balance, and coordination exercises. In ""Tortoise, Hare, and Dragon,"" the concept of perseverance introduces ""elephant wisdom,"" a skill that helps the children focus on their auditory system, as well as ""cat wisdom,"" which concentrates on stress relief. ""Coral Reef"" deals with acceptance while encouraging youngsters to focus on their breathing and cross-motor coordination. ""A Beautiful Dream"" highlights relationships while revisiting all the skills from previous stories. The excellent guide provides background information on the series, detailed descriptions of each adventure skill, and tips for incorporating them into children's lifestyles. An engaging series for use at home and at school.

8427077,5,B004EJTGRG,"these dvds are really fun because they combine story and movement.  kids act out everything so it's like active pretend play with the added bonus of self-regulation skills. We should all know how to shift ourselves from frustration to focus, angry to clear-headed and that what kids are learning as they do these stories.  It's terrific fun and empowering.  My son feels more in control now as the dvds helped be more in tune with his body and what happens and what to do when he does get upset, over-stimulated, etc.  Thanks Move with Me!",1321488000,3,539,4.6421052631578945
