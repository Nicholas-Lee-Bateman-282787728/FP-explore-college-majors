140748,4,0792836529,"Wonderfully silly saga of a shipment of booze to the alcohol-starved city of Denver sometime in the 1870s. Martin Landau and his Indian tribe want to capture and drink the shipment. Lee Remick and her temperance marchers want  to destroy it. Wagonmaster Brian Keith has labor troubles. Burt Lancaster  and his cavalry regiment have to protect them both, and the Denver Free  Militia want to fight off everyone else. Great slapstick, fun performances,  wide open spaces and a marvelous Elmer Bernstien score combine in this epic  send-up of westerns from a time when westerns were still good box-office.  And you've never seen Donald Pleasance until you've seen him as drunken,  mountain-man seer Oracle Jones!",948758400,11,709,5.166666666666667
140749,5,0792836529,"If you can imagine a comic twist on Wild West legends, it's probably in this film.  Burt Lancaster shows a part of his talent that few are aware of: he is a superior comic actor.  A sprawling lampoon of Calvary vs  Indians, whiskey-swilling miners vs temperance workers and man vs woman,  the Hallelujah Trail is a mad-cap roller coaster ride through the back  trails of the classic western.  If you love boots and saddles, comedy or  Burt Lancaster, this is a must see.  Just keep the tissues handy and find a  soft place for falling out of your chair or off the couch.  They don't get  much better.",944006400,44,600,4.462962962962963

140890,2,0792836529,"I'm a big Burt Lancaster fan, and he does the best he could under the circumstances but it wasn't enough to save this.  I had a bad feeling right from the start with the overlong opening score by Elmer Bernstein.  Another reviewer thought it was a great score but it struck me as smarmy and contrived.  Almost immediately the movie makes fun of Native Americans depicting them as slapstick bumpkins taking handouts of Winchester rifles from the government and barely knowing what end to point.  The scene with Pleasance as ""oracle"" was also pretty weak but at first I figured, ok, well, it'll get better.  Boy was I wrong.  And then when the temperance zealots lead by Remick are shown having gotten most of the troop, including a big brass band to whoop it up with them, it became clear this disaster is a cross between How the West Was Won and F Troop, yet lacking even the few marginal qualities of those tired and dated milestones.  I'm now wondering why I bothered to order this-- it was clearly my mistaken assumption that Burt was enough.  Quality of the video was ok, though I bought the region 2 PAL version, so perhaps that's better than the region 1 version given the number of complaints about that...",1410393600,,1213,4.583333333333333
140901,3,0792836529,"In THE HALLELUJAH TRAIL, John Sturges' frothy western comedy set in 1867, cavalry colonel Lancaster escorts forty wagons of booze to Denver while Temperance leader Remick and her group of ladies do all they can to prevent the ""poison"" from being delivered.

When supposedly peaceful Indians who have left their reservation demand half of the wagon train, the colonel refuses and a crazy chase and fight is the result. (During this sequence, stuntman Bill Williams died when the wagon he was riding went over a cliff and Bill wasn't able to jump clear of it.)

Elmer Bernstein's music track is often intrusive and there's ultimately few laughs in this 70mm Cinerama epic. A disappointment.

140908,4,0792836529,"""The Hallelujah Trail"" is an often forgotten film in the annuls of the western genre, largely overshadowed by classics like ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly""; however, this diamond in the rough was directed by John Sturges and composed by Elmer Berstein, the team that brough us ""The Magnificent Seven,"" so the film already has Hollywood Western pedigree.

The action takes off when miners in Dever grow worried about a long winter, and thus order 40 wagons of whiskey from a businessman who, in turn, demands army escort for his cargo.  Meanwhile, temperance activists rallying at the army fort hear about it and set off to stop the wagon train, at the same time that a warband of Sioux indians head out to intercept the whiskey as well. The plot seems rather contrived, but this is typical of the madcap style of comedy in movies like ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.""  As is expected, all these groups eventually meet up in hilarious fashion.

The charm of the ""The Hallelujah Trail"" is two-fold: the film is told in the narrative style of a fake documentary reenactment (think a History-channel-style ""This is Spinal Tap""), and the talented cast of performers stumbles headlong through as many western movie tropes as they can cram into 3 hours. The flagrant use of wild west stereotypes could annoyingly offensive, if it wasn't so ridiculously obvious and campy: the wagon train owner keeps telling other characters that he is entitled to things because he is ""a taxpayer and a good Republican;"" the alcoholic miners would rather risk injury and death in the prairie than spend the winter without whiskey; the temperance marchers' headstrong attitudes completely cow the supposedly rugged, masculine army cavalry officers; and the Indians are depicted as cunning, but completely obsessed with ""crazy water"" (their chief's name is ""Five Barrels"" for crying out loud!). The film relies on its talented cast (Burt Lancaster, Lee Remick, David Keith, Dub Taylor, Martin Landau, etc) to make all of this work, and the performance of it all is truly where the film shines.

The technical quality of the DVD leaves a great deal to be desired. The film, while still technically in widescreen, has not been resized for HD resolution, so there are persistent black gaps on either side of the picture.  Some of the picture quality retains flaws in the film itself, and the soundtrack has not been remastered to make full use of modern technology. However, if you can look past this being dated, trope-filled, technically un-modern, and 3 hours long, the ""Hallelujah Trail"" is an excellent example of genre comedy from a bygone era.",1403913600,,2653,4.923937360178971

140954,4,0792836529,"This is a very honest western comedy which I watched with pleasure - but which is ultimately less succesful than it could have been. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

In the year 1867 the city of Denver, mostly populated in those times by miners, is threatened by a great disaster - lack of whiskey! A great transport of booze is therefore ordered and a large wagon convoy must bring this strategically important resource to the city beofre the coming of winter and the blocking of mountain passes. The departure of this convoy will cause the immediate mobilisation of two extremely dangerous radical merciless groups: the very thirsty Indians led by chiefs Five Barrels (Robert J. Wilke) and Walks-Stooped-Over (Martin Landau) as well as the all-female Temperance League under the orders of the redoubtable sufragette Cora Templeton Massingale (Lee Remick).

In order to protect their vital interests Denver miners will therefore have to form an armed militia and march to war, under the guidance of their spiritual (in more than one aspect) visionary leader they call Oracle (Donald Pleasance). Also, Irish wagon drivers will immediately seize this occasion to launch a strike... Trapped between all those hostile factions is a somehow overwhelmed US Cavalry led by Colonel Gearhart (Burt Lancaster), who for most of the film will have to try to ""cover both rears simultaneously""...)))

The basic idea of the scenario clearly offered a great number of possibilities to the director John Sturges - but he seized only some of them and not always very well. This is a comedy and yes, I guarantee that you will have many laughs, definitely - but less than one could expect. Especially the second part is towards the end somehow disappointing and some attempts at humour feel forced.

On another hand, the music by Elmer Bernstein is a TREASURE - one of the best films scores ever!

Bottom line, this is a rather good film, amusing and entertaining, but which is not as good as it could and should have been, considering the talent of the director and of actors. Still, a nice watch. Enjoy!",1384473600,,2113,4.940845070422535

140987,2,0792836529,"There's no shortage of talent in John Sturges' The Hallelujah Trail, one of the sixties trend for epic widescreen comedies that weren't funny, but the result is one of those films that starts off as sporadically gently amusing before becoming increasingly tiresome and ending up just plain boring. Intended as uberproducers the Mirisch Brothers' first big 65mm Cinerama roadshow release, production was a nightmare, with Sturges wearing out a couple of writers before shooting and never coming up with anything anyone liked, star Burt Lancaster only making the picture at a vastly reduced salary to pay off United Artists for budget overruns on previous films he'd produced for the studio, the already lavishly-budgeted film going overschedule due to bad weather and, worst of all, stuntman Bill Williams dying on the last day of production - Friday the 13th - in a stunt with a wagon crashing over a ridge that went horribly wrong and which rather morbidly still seems to be in the film's drawn out and unfunny finale. Critics and audiences roundly rejected the results, and in an attempt to save the film from sinking into the box-office quicksand it shrunk from its original 165 minutes to 156 minutes to 146 minutes to 134 minutes, losing some of the jokes along the way - which is a big problem in a film with as few jokes to begin with as this.

There's some promise in the premise, which sees the miners of Denver faced with a hard winter without whisky pooling their resources to get one big shipment at the urging of Donald Pleasance's sun-bleached whisky-fuelled oracle. This immediately attracts the attention of both Lee Remick's Temperance campaigner and Robert J. Wilke and Martin Landau's `friendly' Sioux, with striking Irish Teamsters and the Denver militia adding would-be comic obstacles and Burt Lancaster's harassed cavalry commander stuck in the middle. Unfortunately the laughs rarely come, and those that do are mostly in the first third when Lancaster finds his fort all but taken over by Remick (ironically the scenes that bore the brunt of the film's cuts in some versions). Once the plot hits the road, things quickly grind to a halt, with a botched sandstorm set piece that Blake Edwards probably could have pulled off in his sleep demonstrating the usually reliable Sturges' tin eye for comedy staging. Things get even worse after the intermission as the plot gets bogged down in repetitive negotiation and boring arbitration scenes (really) that are like waiting for cheese to ferment before dragging its heels to a climax filled with runaway wagons, drunken Indians and pursuing cavalry but little to laugh at.

With the exception of Brian Keith, who goes into autopilot bellowing and bluster mode (possibly in frustration at his every other line being ""I'm a taxpayer and a good Republican""), the cast try their best, playing it commendably straight, but they're let down by John Gay's screenplay and Sturges' misplaced confidence in the chances of humour emerging naturally from the situations. Stranger still is the way it seems both stretched wildly beyond its natural length and truncated at the same time. Even in the 156-minute version on DVD in the US the film seems to lose interest in many of its cast: after introducing their romantic subplot, Jim Hutton and Pamela Tiffin find themselves relegated to the sidelines for much of the picture while Landau's Walks Stooped Over has little to do and tends to get lost in the shuffle until the end. At times John Dehner's straight-faced narration, often at odds with what we see onscreen, seems a last ditch attempt to tie the disparate plot strands and half-forgotten characters together in post-production.

Thanks to Robert Surtees' cinematography the film certainly looks good when it's out in the open - or did originally, since MGM/UA's DVD is a poor transfer that suffers from a lot of edge enhancement - but the film's one genuine triumph is Elmer Bernstein's wonderful score, one of the very best he ever wrote. Expansive, melodic and exciting, even the film's Temperance songs are rousing stuff: it's no wonder that one of the film's few successful running jokes has the regimental band constantly getting carried away and joining in. If only it were in a better and much less boring film...

Now that widescreen TVs have been around for years, I'm sure that justice can be done to this and other cinerama movies, including ""How the West Was Won"", a much inferior porteyal of the old west that buys into all the stereotypes and propoganda that ""Trail"" satirizes.

A wagon train heads for Denver with a cargo of whisky for the miners. Chaos ensues as the Temperance League, the US cavalry, the miners and the local Indians all try to take control of the valuable cargo. (IMDb)

Western spoof, one of several large-scale widescreen, long-form ""epic"" comedies produced in the 1960s, much like The Great Race or It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, combined with the epic grandeur of the Western genre. The movie is technically outstanding, having been filmed in Ultra Panavision 70 and presented in 70 mm Cinerama in premiere engagements, projected onto the Cinerama curved screen with three projectors.

The film is presented in a pseudo-documentary style, with a tongue-in-cheek narrator (John Dehner) providing historical background and context, and periodically interrupting the story to point out animated charts illustrating strategic positions of various groups.

Only objection: 165 minutes running time is too long!

203us - The Hallelujah Trail (John Sturges, 1965, 165') -A long drink - 1/11/2012",1351728000,,1401,5.433179723502304
141062,3,0792836529,"That's /not/ a reference to a really awful ""Outer Limits"" episode. Or the buzzing of locusts.

Like Kirk Douglas, Burt Lancaster had the sense to stay away from movies made only to take advantage of his good looks. Lancaster has an impressive record of producing and starring in above-average films (see my review of ""Lawman"").

""The Hallelujah Trail"" isn't one of them. Like ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", ""THT"" is an ""epic comedy"", a roadshow presentation shot in large format. Unfortunately for both films, ""epic"" and ""comedy"" don't play well together. And ""Western"" and ""comedy"" are even less-compatible bedmates. (I can think of exactly two successful comic westerns -- ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" and ""Destry Rides Again"". ""Little Big Man"" isn't a comedy, per se, but its tongue is pressed firmly in its cheek. ""Maverick"" (the TV series, /not/ the movie) might be added.)

""THJ"" revolves around 40 wagons loaded with whisky, headed for Denver (which has run out of the stuff), escorted by the Army, and pursued not only by the thirsty Denverites, but a temperance leader (plus her followers), and various Indians who want the fire water for themselves.

There might be a funny movie in this, but ""THT"" isn't it. Ignoring the overture, titles, and intermission/entr'acte music, it runs a good (or should I say mediocre?) two and one-half hours. Comedy needs a faster pace. With a bit of script tightening and brisker direction, the whole thing could have been over in 100 minutes. It just might have worked. As it was, I fell asleep near the end. (In fairness, John Sturges does a remarkable job keeping this cinematic longueur from collapsing altogether.)

The fundamental problem, though, is that the script assumes the basic idea is inherently funny, and needs no particular elaboration. It's enough to simply set the plot in motion and let it unfold (or unravel, in this case). Well, if you're going to hold the audience's attention for 2.5 hours, you need plot complications. There's only one rather weak one, and it comes too late.

If you think ""The Hallelujah Trail"" is funny... I've got some swampland to sell you.

PS: The copy I reviewed was from a Burt Lancaster box set. Though the transfer is from a theatrical print (there are occasional dust spots and emulsion chips), the quality is excellent, not at all of the ""badness"" others describe. It is, in fact, a bit too good. The print is so sharp that ""jaggies"" (aliasing) are often visible. The stereo sound (on a 36"" Sony WEGA) was clean and solid.",1334448000,,2523,4.8671328671328675

One of my favorite scenes has the Irish Teamster leader, Kevin, when accused of black mail, saying, ""Blackmail is such an ugly word. I prefer extortion."" That was cut out. Another scene that got cut was when Kevin was was telling Cora why the Irish were hired to drive the wagons containing champagne. Most of that was cut out. The still that was projected on the screen when the overture was being played was not present on the DVD, just a black screen. Other than the credits for the leading stars, the credits are missing at the end of the movie. All that's shown is a black screen with the overture playing.

One example would be ""Pillow Talk"" ... a very funny movie from the early 60s, but one which is extremely tame by the standards of the last 30 years or so.

Among westerns, ""The Hallelujah Trail"" is another such example. The romance is tame, the violence fails to actually ever hurt anyone (a good thing), and the comedy is full of misdirection and bluster. The story and its elements are very tame by recent standards, but I never fail to be entertained when I watch this movie. I've always enjoyed one line in particular from the film, a take-off on a famous Churchill quote (and I'm sure I paraphrase); ""Never have so many bullets been fired at so many targets in such a small area with so few casualties"". This after an epic battle scene involving cavalry, miners, a booze ""wagon train"", an Indian tribe, and a group of lady prohibition crusaders.

The narration of the film adds a special touch. Its unusual but also quite funny.

There is also a very talented cast in this movie, led by Burt Lancaster, and so for that reason alone it's no surprise that the film is solid and entertaining.

Is it a blockbuster caliber film? No. But if you're caught in on a rainy Saturday afternoon and catch it on cable, you won't be disappointed, either",1299024000,,1456,4.479245283018868
141071,5,0792836529,"This 1965 film got its name from the exclamation that drunks shout when they have too much to drink. It is a humorous, frequently ridiculous and therefore funny flick about what occurred when the city of Denver ran out of whiskey in 1867. A drunken visionary, the oracle, predicts that the city would be saved from this undesired thirst when 40 wagons cart crates of whiskey from the east. However, the oracle failed to see the complications that would dismantle this otherwise reasonable prediction, from groups and individuals.

 Arrangements are made to ship the whiskey, but it is so unusual an enterprise that a newspaper announces the endeavor and the wrong people hear about it and get involved. These include an Indian tribe that decides to raid the wagon and steal the firewater, a group of temperance women determined to save people from devouring this drink from hell, miners from Denver who want to assure that the caravan reaches them, and the army that must help the conflicting interests of each of them. Each group sets out on its own and by chance converges during a blinding snowstorm. Each group fires shots during the storm even though they can't see a foot in front of them.

Individuals add complications to the situation. There is the colonel who served the military for 19 years and his relationship with his daughter and the temperance lady. There is the head caravan driver who wants to strike because of poor working conditions. There is the owner of the caravan who insists that every barrel of whiskey must be delivered, come what may. There is the Indian chief who agrees not to attack if he is given 20 of the 40 barrels and his sub-Indian-chief who claims that he cannot speak English and walks around with a flag bearing a white cloth. Viewers will watch wondering which of the groups and individuals will succeed.",1293408000,,1847,4.783699059561129

141093,4,0792836529,"This movie was taken from the 1964 Doubleday DD hardcover western novel THE HALLELUJAH TRAIN written by Bill Gulick. Mr. Gulick was a well known writer to those of us that read and enjoy print westerns. He also wrote other westerns such as TREASURE IN HELL'S CANYON, and the trilogy of the Nez Perces War: DISTANT TRAILS 1805-1836, GATHERING STORM 1837-1868, AND LOST WALLOWA 1868-1879. Most of his westerns were of a more serious nature but every once in a while he wrote one such as THE HALLELUJAH TRAIN. The book was released years later in paperback as THE HALLELUJAH TRAIL, with some people feeling the movie version was an overall improvement of the book.

I've seen the movie several times down through the years, having a copy of the DVD now, and still enjoy seeing it every now and then.  As long as the viewer can enjoy a somewhat atypical 'western' it is well worth watching, if for no other reasons than good performances by the well stocked cast members, plus the fact that several of the actors are now dead.  The movie also is representative of what the movie production companies were releasing in the mid to late 1960s.

If a viewer enjoys good acting, western motifs, and light satire with a touch of history, then this movie will rest easy with them.

The humor is not dropped out of the sky to hit hard, it is constant and subtle, and makes the entire film enjoyable. There is sarcasm, slapstick, intellectual, and low-brow humor, all intertwined as a constant barrage that keeps you attentive, lest you should miss a joke.

141137,3,0792836529,"This isn't that bad a film. It's just not particularly funny. I guess the big problem is that there aren't any comic actors in there to help cover up the deficiencies of the script (like say, It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, which has an equally unfunny script but makes up for it with funny performers). Burt Lancaster is fine - I like the gentle send-up of his macho roles. And Robert Wilkie and Martin Landau don't do a bad job as the principal indians. Donald Pleasance starts off well as the drunken ""oracle"" who only sees visions when he's boozed, but the writers don't seem to know what to do with him once the action gets going. Brian Keith is wasted, as is Pamela Tiffin (how the heck she got into the starring credits with only five or so minutes of screen time is beyond me) and Lee Remick is just plain annoying. The big comic set-pieces (the battle in the sandstorm and the final wagon chase) are a complete mess - you get the impression that the team made it up as they went along. On the plus side is a wonderfully dry voice-over from John Dehner, stunning wide-screen photography and one of Elmer Bernstein's best music scores (not up there with The Great Escape or The Magnificent Seven but miles ahead of a lot of his other stuff). John Sturges doesn't so much direct as simply aim the camera and let the actors do their thing. All this being said, I still don't mind the movie. It has that special kind of appealing naivety that those big budget comedies had in the sixties, and if you're from that generation it'll strike a nice, easy-going note. But a great comedy it ain't.

But if this is a comedy I'm a little Green Martian

The only even slightly inspired comedic bit was Donald Pleasance as Oracle

As to the rest, well.....bloat comes to mind to describe it just like a lot of 1960's movies that went on forever.

Someone mentioned Blake Edward's ""The Great Race"" as being in the same big movie genre of the 1960's.  That movie also has bloat but there are some real comedic gems in the performances of Tony Curtis, Peter Falk, Jack Lemmon and the chick.  It had a semi-clothed performance by Natalie Wood that was genuinely sexy and it had a better portrayal of a feminist movement over Hallalujah's lazy portrayal of Temperance, although both portrayals would still cheese off feminists today.

In ""Hallalujah"" There is not an ounce of comic timing.  There are set pieces that have the form and look of a comedy but the gag setups are inept and clumsy if the setups exist at all.

Just look at that awful confrontation scene when the Miners, Indians, Cavalry and the wagon train meet in the dust storm.  It's like they made up all the scenarios on the spot with no idea of connectivity, pacing or tension.

The actors are shamelessly mugging and doing awful double takes.  There are times it works and there are times it doesn't.  This is one of those times it doesn't.

The narrator's narration is supposed to be, I take it, tongue in cheek.  He sounds like he's from a bad industrial education film from the 1950's with upbeat, spunky music in the background.

The writing falls flat.  In the first hour and a half of the film I did not even crack a smile.  A comedy has laughs.  My side remained completely unsplit.  No internal organs were spilled in the viewing of this movie.

There is the egregious comedic portrayal of the Indians.  People will say lighten up.  Well, if it was a story about slave history with whites doing blackface  would you say lighten up?  I didn't think so.

For instance, the narrator is translating the Indian's speech as Pidgin English.  I think if it was idiomatically translated it should have been portrayed as some kind of natural, fluent speech.

What should I expect though.  This was a big studio project released several years before the fresh air of the early 1970's filmmaking generation that would give us a revisionist western like ""Little Big Man.""  ""Little Big Man"" is a film which I love involving whites and Indians.  Granted it engages in reverse racism portraying whites as the other/enemy but at least  it has several actual guffaws in it, though it's not billed as a comedy.

I think there might be a generation gap involved here.  If I knew the ages of the people involved there might be a slight skew towards the older ones actually liking this and giving it 5 stars.  After all I'm used to MTV pacing and movie plots actually getting to the point within the first 15 minutes.",1110412800,3,2998,4.597353497164462

Hallelujah Trail is not serious and a must see for those who enjoy poking fun a so many routine beliefs. Lee Remick is her beautiful self; her costumes only enhance her natural beauty.

141142,3,0792836529,"From the 'BIGGER IS BETTER' school of film-making that was in vogue in the mid-sixties comes this so-so comedy/western.  Beginning with ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" in 1964 movie comedies took on the form and approach of an epic.  Immediately on it's heels followed Blake Edwards's ""The Great Race"", Ken Annakin's ""Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines"" and this film.  This trend continued and lasted for five years, culminating in Annakin's 1969 second mammoth effort ""Those Daring Young Men In Their Jaunty Jalopies"".  But movie audiences had lost their appreciation for the formula by the time it appeared - the caper film was the newest rage and the slew of disaster films was only lurking around the corner ready to take up the rest of the slack!  ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" has gone on to enjoy bona-fide cult classic status and is still highly regarded and well-loved by its many defenders.  The others all have their defenders as well and rightly so where Edwards's ""The Great Race"" is concerned, definitely a classic in it's own right.  And over forty years later many others within this sub-genre continue to delight and entertain young audiences today and that is a success that doesn't show any signs of diminishing.

In 1965 director John Sturges could have made any movie he wanted to.  He was fresh from the success of back-to-back international sensations ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Great Escape""; mysteriously he picked this project (he would never again direct another comedy).  Burt Lancaster was in a similar position, owning his own production company and undeniably a firmly established star of the screen.  He agreed to star in this film, reuniting him Sturges with whom he had done the immensely entertaining and hugely successful ""Gunfight At The O.K. Corral"" back in 1957.  I'm sure they were both counting on nothing but the best when they set out to make this picture.  Well, you know what they say about good intentions...

What must have looked like fun on paper doesn't quite make it completely to the screen here.  Right at the point the comedy should be peaking it falls flat and only rarely recovers.  Many of the sight gags, slapstick routines, one-liners and snappy comebacks drop dead on arrival.  This is not the fault of a great and very capable cast though; everyone put forth their best foot here in a solid effort to pull this off.  The two major liabilities here: a director that didn't understand comedy and the film's mammoth length.  Sturges, who had never had any experience in working with comedy, was probably unsuited to direct this film and that is painfully evident throughout.  In hindsight it would have been wise to have an assistant director with experience in this field of movie-making.  The script itself is stretched to the point of no return and should have been trimmed and tightened up.  At 165 minutes it's just too long to sustain the singular idea.

If you're not familiar with the film here's the story: The town of Denver is nearing a crisis with winter nearly upon them - there's only a few bottles of whiskey left.  A shipment is on the way to Denver but the odds against it making it to them are great.  Several tribes of Indians want to liberate some (or most) of the shipment themselves; a ladies temperance union wants to prevent the shipment entirely and runs interference with the military men assigned to protect it.  The Irish teamsters who are the wagon drivers for the shipment threaten to strike in order to procure as much of the whiskey for themselves as possible.  None of this sits well with the Denver miners who decide to form their own citizens' militia and meet the shipment to bring it safely home.  The groups all converge on one another during a sandstorm resulting in a bit of chaos.  Afterwards the commander of the military assumes charge of the situation; he works to resolve the teamsters threat to strike, gains the respect of the Denver citizens' militia, continues verbal battles with the ladies and brokers a deal with the Indians that is misunderstood or misinterpreted - you'll have to watch to decide for yourself.  Later on the Indians surprise the military, disarm them and take the women hostage - demanding the whiskey as ransom.  Eventually one side wins out...or so it seems.  Again you'll have to watch to see what I mean.

All the usual cultural stereotypes are in place here: Irish teamsters thirsting for whiskey, Indians desperate for 'crazy water', women urging the men to practice temperance, etc.  The cast tries to get the best out of this but the overall result is only middling.  Donald Pleasance as Oracle Jones and Lee Remick as Cora Templeton Massingale fare the best; Martin Landau as Chief-Walks-Stooped-Over is an embarrassment to see in this day and age (why couldn't they have cast an Indian actor in this role?) and Lancaster himself seems to appear as if working under a great strain in some scenes - I can't be sure if this is part of the character he is playing or not.  A definite mixed bag, ""The Hallelujah Trail"" was poorly received in 1965 and time hasn't been kind to it either.  It plays better on TV when broken up by commercials which is how I first saw it.

The best bit in the movie: When Remick is trying vainly to convince Lancaster about the dangers of alcohol she reports to him that ""Three of the women in my movement have lost their husbands to alcohol. The men literally drank themselves to death!""  Burt's snappy reply?  ""One can only wonder why.""  There are other gems like this scattered throughout that are worth hearing.",1092614400,3,5603,4.770746887966805
141163,4,0792836529,"THE WILDEST ROLLICKING WESTERN OF ALL TIMES! THE HALLELUJAH TRAIL is a gem! Like MCLINTOCK! it's full of surprizes!!!! Everything from THE CALVARY, DRUNKEN INDIANS, TEMPERANCE MARCHERS, THIRSTY CITIZENS, A WAGONTRAIN OF WHISKEY, and a climax of QUICKSAND!!!! This motion picture has evrything!!!!
THE WEST REALLY BECAME FUN!!!! I enjoy the great cast of BURT LANCHASTER, LEE REMICK, BRIAN KEITH, DONALD PLEASANCE, JIM HUTTON, PAMELA TIFFON, ROBERT J. WILKES, MARTIN LANDAU, JOHN ANDERSON, and DUB TAYLOR add their own special humor to this motion picture classic!!!! The funniest scenes are THE BATTLE OF WHISKEY HILLS (the shootout in the sandstorm), THE WILD CHASE LEADING TO QUICKSAND BOTTOMS (the drunken indian pursuit, leading a switch of the western classics, where the calvary attacks the indians), and finally THE DISASTER AT QUICKSAND BOTTOMS (where the wagons sink in the quicksand!) The action is high octane madcap comedy all the way! JOHN DEHNER delivers the delightful narration, even when the winter turns out to be the warmest and driest on record. This is indeed a JOHN STURGES classic! ELMER BERNSTEIN delivers a top notch music score, that include an memorable music piece during the sinking of wagons in the quicksand! The effects of all the wagons going down together in QUICKSAND BOTTOMS is unmistakably eyecatching! THE HALLELUJAH TRAIL will always be a classic to watch again and again!",1071014400,7,1411,5.275555555555556

141165,5,0792836529,"This is perhaps my favorite comedy-Western; I've watched it more times than I can count, on TV and later on video.  Like John Wayne in such films as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McLintock-Authentic-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000ANVPPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McLintock!

As the gruff veteran Col. Thaddeus Gearhardt, USC, he is confronted with a request to provide escort for a wagon train carrying a cargo of whiskey to Denver, where a cruel winter is predicted ""and a man is sorely in need of comfort,"" as one character puts it.  In carrying out his mission, assisted by his loyal Sergeant-Major, Buell (John Anderson), he must also deal with the beautiful and charismatic temperance/suffrage activist Cora Templeton Massingale (Lee Remick); his own motherless daughter Louise (Pamela Tiffin), who has become converted to Mrs. Massingale's cause; his goodhearted but somewhat inept young adjutant, Capt. Paul Slater (Jim Hutton), who is courting Louise; the bullheaded Frank Wallingham (Brian Keith), who owns the freighting company moving the whiskey; a contingent of discontented Irish teamsters led by Kevin O'Flaherty (Tom Stern); a large and thirsty band of Indians, led by the Sioux chief Five Barrels (Robert J. Wilkie) and his cohort Walks-Stooped-Over (Martin Landau); and a citizen militia from Denver, resolved to protect the ""precious cargo"" of booze, led by miner Clayton Howell (Dub Taylor) and guided by ex-mountain-man Oracle Jones (Donald Pleasence), who is prone (when lubricated) to ""visions""--one of which was the start of the entire situation.  It would take more space than I'm afforded here to describe all the twists and turns of the plot; suffice to say that Wallingham (who has ""every cent I own tied up in this cargo""), Oracle, and the miners all want to get the whiskey to Denver, Cora Massingale and her 70-odd temperance ladies want to keep them from doing so, the Indians want to get liquored up, the Irish want their fourteen-point manifesto of grievances addressed, and Slater, Buell, and Gearhardt just want to carry out their orders and keep the peace.  What follows as each group attempts to advance its own agenda is enough to make even a full bird Colonel wish he'd chosen another profession.

Director John Sturges might have chosen a better location than Gallup, NM, to shoot in: it doesn't look at all like the Platte River country.  But the actors and the story are so riveting that you forget about the incongruous setting and just follow what's going on.  I have enough of the Sioux language to know that Wilkie is using it (and very well, too) when he speaks as Five Barrels.  And while Lancaster and Remick may hold the top billing, my own favorites are Pleasence (then a good deal thinner than he later became, and worthy of having been nominated for Best Supporting Actor), Anderson, Keith, and Landau.  Remick's and Tiffin's costumes are authentically Victorian, though I'm not sure of the accuracy of the Cavalry uniforms (on the other hand, the constant detailed barrage of orders sounds very Army indeed).  Elmer Bernstein's score is another high point, ranging from moody to descriptive to the triumphant beginning and ending chorus.  John Dehner offers an uncredited but wonderfully solemn narration that plays off the tone of the film itself perfectly.  The one gripe I have with my VHS copy is that some of the map graphics aren't fully shown owing to screen format.  This film would be well suited to viewers of all ages and, while it's not Politically Correct, everyone gets their licks in at some point and it should make a great family night.

One of the earliest films to lampoon it's leads (but nicely) it stands out as both a tribute to all the great Westerns as well as a campy send-up as well.
And what a cast! Burt Lancaster demonstrated a talent for comedy that I would never have thought at the time. And Jim Hutton, Brian Keith, Lee Remick....
One of Sturges' regular contributers, Elmer Bernstein wrote an emcompassing score that went right to the heart of things.

My old VHS duel tape copy was mastered from a better copy of the film than the DVD. Several spots where film burns are noted, grainy, pixilated, jumpy too. And audio? Just causing the Dolby light to turn on is not Dolby (plus it is a mix down Dolby audio).

attention given to the transition to DVD. If not for the longevity of the DVD to preserve this classic it would not be worth the purchase price. I would hope someone takes the time to view the DVD a see the very poor attempt to create a DVD.

7792113,2,0792836529,"I never found this film funny, just kind of amusing.  It passed the time when it was on TV, but made little to no sense whatsoever.  The story was vague, and there were no real humorous moments in it, just a lot of attitude of how things could be light hearted, but not much else.

And that's the thing with comedies prior to the 80s, or more specifically the 90s and 70s (the 80s seeing the rise in bad taste films), the actors carried the performance as if the moment they were in and the dialogue they recited were humorous, when in actuality, they, the lines, and the situation, mostly weren't.  Site gags were funny, but clever non-slapstick non-vaudeville dialogue that you could laugh at, would have to wait 30+ years.

The narration in The Hallelujah Trail isn't funny, but tries to set up a funny situation that could potentially be funny, but otherwise is just ridiculous.  And something ridiculous does not a funny film make.  It makes the film and the actors look and come across as just absurd.

Whether its the women's auxiliary trying to rid the world of wisky and other spirits, or the Native Americans who don't look very Native American even with all of the makeup and wigs, or the Irish teamsters and actors playing the US Cavalry, it's just one giant mess of a film.

Now, having said that, it does pass the time, and the cinematography of the outdoor vistas is fairly impressive.  But, other than that, this movie isn't worth the film stock it was shot on.

A better film would have reworked the story and try to visually bring some of the backstory to life so that we the audience could understand the author's humor.  But that wasn't done.

On the plus side, in spite of the trite ""Indians wanting fire water"" plot device, and the poor use of water coated with sand to pretend that it's quicksand for the audience (I could never stand that dumb effect), the film is otherwise harmless.  And I mean that.  Unless you're a thin skinned native American of some midwestern tribe, I don't think there's much in here that will raise anyone's social hackles.  Eh, the Indian and wisky plot device is borderline racist, but that was an actual issue in the Old West.

In spite of my land-blasting the film here (largely done to shake the people by the shoulders who are praising this thing), it does pass the time, and is somewhat pleasant to look at.  And with all the heavy westerns regarding gunfights, Indian raids and war parties, or whatever else, the light tone does break up the western genre some by adding some attitudinal levity (again, there are no real jokes in this thing).

Even though I bought the DVD out of nostalgia, it's not a bluray that I would purchase.

I recommend avoiding this thing.",1519084800,,2724,4.565843621399177

7792116,5,0792836529,"Let's get one thing straight--this is a farce. The intent is to make fun of all the classic tropes and hypocrisies and conceited self-aggrandizements of the classic Epic Westerns. The actors in this movie certainly understood that since many of them starred in the very movies they were spoofing here. Even the soundtrack and title song by Elmer Bernstein (The Magnificent Seven) is part of the farce. For this to work, it has to be done with a straight face and over-the-top sincerity by all involved. And it is. There have been several complaints about the blank screen at the opening with music playing and again at the mid-point of the movie after the 'intermission.' Maybe those reviewers aren't old enough to remember the grand panoramic movie theaters with the velour covered seats and the huge curtains covering the giant screens. I am, barely. Now-a-days they just flash the light at the two minute warning to get you in your seats. In those days, as folks gathered--couples and families dressed nicely--and chatted, the overture would begin to play softly with the volume increasing gradually while the house lights gradually dimmed. It was a gentle advisory that the movie would begin soon. The curtains would begin to draw back from the screen. Then, just as the house light went out, the curtains fully withdrew, and the music reached full volume, the screen would light up with the opening credits. Put yourself in that place and the rest will become clear: White men playing native people while native people played supporting roles, Western cavalry in spotless, form-fitting uniforms that never really got torn or dirty, heroic local militias who really weren't, God-fearing, tax-paying Republican businessmen who face all manner of hardships to 'tame the west' including socialist Irish teamsters with their 'list of grievances.""  I repeat, it's a farce (like Sharknado but with better cinematography). But, it is a lovely farce. And I am so happy to have my own copy.

Finally, After reading several reviews of movies being purchased that were not formatted to play in the U.S. I contacted the seller I'd selected through Amazon. The seller quickly responded and confirmed that his copy of the DVD was formatted for Region 1 (U.S.A.). it has played flawlessly.
