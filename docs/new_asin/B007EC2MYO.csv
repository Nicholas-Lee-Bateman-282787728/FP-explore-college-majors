8515192,4,B007EC2MYO,"I am a Christian - so I was rooting for him and his son on these dvd's - but.... he never answers his critics!!!!??? All he does is talk about his critics bad spelling on their web sites and their grammar errors that even the most stick in the mud English teacher wouldn't count off for. He does make some points along the way though. I think it is funny hoe people keep complaining about his PHD. from a non-accredited school. It's like being a 250 pound heavy weight and crying about that ""the champion isn't a true heavy weight and only weighs 163 pounds!"" after he beat you up in the ring. Mr. Hovind is the best debater I've ever seen on any subject. YOU should get one of his debate collections.",1442966400,,701,4.2781954887218046
8515193,5,B007EC2MYO,"Dr. Kent Hovind and his son Eric Hovind Answer their toughest critics in this exciting series.  This will answer some of the questions that perhaps you have had about his Seminars and other materials.  The reviews I see are people that hate the Hovind's pr at least they disagree with what they teach.  Just because we disagree with someone, does not or should not mean that they are stupid.  I don't agree with everything Stephen Hawking has to say.  However, it would be stupid for me to say he is stupid.  :)  He is one of the most brilliant minds on the planet...I do disagree with him...but stupid?  No way.  Also, most do not know what really happened with Dr. Hovind and his prison time.  They heard that he didn't pay his taxes so this is what they go with.  Even if it were true it does not change what he teaches.  Either what he teaches is the truth or it is not true...that is for all of us to decide.",1398038400,,913,4.2748538011695905
8515194,2,B007EC2MYO,"perhaps in a bid to capture as much $ as possible and hide it from uncle sam kent hovind it at it again

this is nothing more than hovind and sometimes his son[ed mcmahon like] talking on the RADIO

none of his beautiful illustrations are present

certainly he argues with mainstream scientest but the most intresting was when he went after other  preachers

now this was funhugh ross for example

hovind sefends his position by asserting HE has read the bible and has found the only ""corect copy"" and his interpetation stands

I gave it stars cause it is funny",1339200000,,561,4.55
