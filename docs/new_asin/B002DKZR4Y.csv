Outstanding!!! This combination turned out to be one of the best CMT Crossroads Shows ever. Taylor Swift has her band, it includes fiddles, and Country Music Oriented instruments. Then you get Def Leppard, one of the greatest Rock bands ever, which includes Joe Elliot, Vivian Campbell, Rick Allen, Phil Collen and Rick Savage. The performance of these two bands along with lead singers Taylor Swift & Joe Elliot is simply outstanding.

Some of the songs you get include: ""Photograph"", ""Hysteria"", ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"", ""Picture to Burn"", ""Love Story"", and ""When Love & Hate Collide"". Plus, you get great conversations between Taylor Swift and the members of Dep Leppard.

Plus you get bonus performances of ""Our Song"", ""Love"", and ""Two Steps Behind"".

3911471,5,B002DKZR4Y,"I love love love this video.  I tend to pull this out a couple times a year when I need to end my day on an upbeat note. Confession:  I was and still am not true fan of either Taylor Swift or Def Leppard, but this collaboration works for me.  The performance is professional, polished, and it is evident that they rehearsed to insure this would be a stellar show.  In addition of great renditions of songs by both artists, the interviews are fun to watch.  Both groups are amazingly blended for every song and everyone on stage looks like they are having a great time.  A solid showing by four old guys and a golden chirp.",1493424000,,622,4.273504273504273

All the songs seamlessly blend together for a great show! The DVD itself is the TV version but also includes some songs that were left out of the broadcast.

Honestly, for the price of this DVD you can't go wrong. However, I honestly believe that somebody should release this on Blu-Ray so it can be in true HD! I think Taylor and Def Leppard both deserve this!!!

If your a fan of either or both I highly recommend this dvd!!!",1485820800,2,576,4.275229357798165

3911481,5,B002DKZR4Y,"This DVD is so good! The songs are catchy, the presentation is nice, and the way they meld the two bands together is perfect. This is obviously an older release, as it came out after Taylor Swift's second album, so it sounds nothing like her current hits.

But as far as the DVD goes, it's the TV broadcast, but it also includes extra songs that weren't featured on the show.  If you're a Swifty, it's a must-have, and if you're a Def Leppard fan, I think you'll get a kick out of it too.",1452902400,,488,4.180851063829787

3911485,5,B002DKZR4Y,"This video is like a preview of Taylor's pop music in the album ""1989"".  I would say this is one of the best Crossroads videos.  True to the title's meaning, we see a combination of rock and country.  Def Leppard's rock songs are performed in a new way, and Taylor's high tone vocals and hip dancing make the songs in some ways better than the originals.
I also liked this video for the revealing interviews that were shown in between the performances (not all at once).  Taylor's talent and life-long pursuit of music are evident here.  It is no wonder that within a few years of this performance she rocked to the top of the pop music charts.
Country music helped get Taylor started, and its emphasis on resonating and memorable lyrics has carried through to her pop music.  Yet her pop music is better than most, it really does have some country and rock features.  On top of that, Taylor's music videos are undeniably fun.",1441324800,,926,4.542168674698795

3911492,4,B002DKZR4Y,"Love Def Leppard, but Taylor could not keep up with the high notes of such hard music.  She needs to stick with her more tame pop/country singing. Although, she was amazing singing Hysteria.",1427673600,,190,4.757575757575758

This DVD only includes a featurette with eight songs interspliced with behind-the-scenes footage and no option to just play the songs.  The ""exclusive bonus"" feature just has three more songs.  The songs are great, and the production value of the recording and filming leaves no complaints.  I just wish I could get a recording of the actual concert.",1416960000,,419,4.698630136986301

3911512,5,B002DKZR4Y,"If you are someone who hears with your ears, and have no concern for what it's called, Crossroads is for you. Blending Def Leppard and Taylor Swift is not an obvious choice. The results, however, are undeniable. Taylor says she was born with Leppard playing in her ears, it shows. Joe Elliott on vocals with a Taylor song? Man has never sounded better! At 45 minutes, the experience is way too brief. Extras are interviews and press conference that show these 6 people at ease with each other. The humor shows on both sides. Try this. You owe it to yourself!",1394150400,2,558,4.534653465346534

Very enjoyable dvd.. The musicians from all seemed to be having fun. The dvd is 75  minutes long  and contains 11 songs with the extra 3 songs not performed on the special.
Well worth the money.
I am waiting for the dvd for the Storytellers series Taylor did at Mudd College. Excellent show.",1390435200,,460,4.275862068965517
3911526,5,B002DKZR4Y,Given their different genres and ages It's hard to believe how well these artists mesh. Nothing like the disaster that was Carrie Underwood and Aerosmith Crossroads.,1381276800,,165,5.384615384615385
3911527,4,B002DKZR4Y,"While I am a Def Leppard fan, previous live concert dvds have disappointed me.  And I couldn't imagine Taylor Swift doing justice to classic rock. Consequently I watched this concert expecting the worse. Boy was I wrong!  Despite a somewhat weak 5.1 DTS vocal audio track (I had to turn the center speaker to full), the songs selections and composition are brilliant, showcasing both Def Leppard and Taylor Swift.  The 45 minute concert was much too short however the 4 bonus tracks give you an hour of music. I don't understand why these songs were bonus tracks rather than simply incorporating them into the concert footage. And then there's 15 minutes or more of casual back-stage conversations of Taylor with the members of Def Leppard.  A winner!",1378080000,,751,4.889763779527559
3911528,5,B002DKZR4Y,"Had seen this concert on TV, and wanted the video.  Have watched it many times, and love the her signing with Def Leppard.  If they put a concert on with the two of them singing, I would definitely go.  She compliments them, and vice versa.",1377993600,,240,4.288888888888889

3911531,4,B002DKZR4Y,"Off hand, I couldn't come up with two more disparate artists. Def Leppard; old-school 80's arena rockers from Yorkshire, England and Taylor Swift; teenage (at the time) country-pop princess from Nashville (by way of Pennsylvania).  The thing is, it works and while Taylor really doesn't have the pipes for some of the songs, she gives it her best and you can tell everyone had a great time together.

Oh, and Joe Elliot, DL lead singer could've been a pretty good country western crooner back in the day.  Fun disc, plus some good extras including some songs that didn't make it onto the show when it aired. If you're a fan of either, pick it up you won't be disappointed.",1371168000,2,672,4.630252100840337

Taylor Swift doesn't really have a rocker voice. Her voice is soft, pretty and suitable for pop or country music. That being said, Taylor looks INSANELY HOT rockin' out on stage with Def Leppard, and that's why I love this video!",1363737600,,378,4.323943661971831

Yes it's Taylor Swift and Def Leppard and while many would say that doesn't make any sense or Def Leppard ""sold out"" they didn't and the resulting concert is actually very good. You get the hour show that was played on CMT and than two bonus songs and some extra interviews. I am bias because I love both Swift and Leppard, but for the money it is definitely and it's a good performance and the groups work well together. Something for everybody to like here.",1362268800,,564,4.280373831775701

3911549,4,B002DKZR4Y,"Great DVD! As a 60 year old fan who saw them live two months ago in Concord, CA, I can say that the Def'ers are in great form both vocally and instrumentally. They have not gone on cruise control and stopped practicing like some classic rockers. Ms. Swift never sounded better in a live performance, but that is damning with faint praise. She definitely has some ""heart of rock'n roll"" in her and does well in view of her limited vocal range and power.",1355097600,,452,4.392857142857143
3911550,5,B002DKZR4Y,"Loved it. Never purchased anything on TS prior, always been the Def Leppard fan. But both groups mixed well, had fun, and made great music together.
I wish the format of it was just the straight concert and all the interviews and back stage stuff was its own section to go to as apposed to intermixed between each song, but it appears that is the format for the Crossroads thing.",1351382400,2,379,4.428571428571429

Neither of us were Taylor Swift fans, but as other reviews have stated, this DVD is a wonderful collaboration between the two, and somehow brought out the best in both bands, creating an amazing performance. It is clearly evident that everyone is having a great time performing, including the audience, who were probably largely Swift fans, and it's hard not to get into this concert along with them. We've had this DVD playing for two days straight and can't get enough of it. Would have loved to have seen this performance live.  Fabulous, just fabulous.",1341705600,3,684,4.691666666666666

This is my first review on Amazon and the only reason is because I want to make sure nobody else makes the same mistake I did.

I'm a loyal Amazon customer (Prime even) and will continue to buy from Amazon. But I made a big mistake here. My daughter wanted this DVD and so I went to Amazon to look for it like I do everything else. I found it and bought it at the $34.25 price. The DVD arrived exactly when it was supposed to and the DVD itself is great. Great concert. If you like Taylor Swift and/or Def Leppard, you won't be disappointed. But buy the DVD from Walmart.com for less than $14.00.

In fact, the DVD that arrived was re-shrink wrapped with a ""Only at Walmart"" sticker on it. I thought that was strange so I went to Walmart.com and sure enough, there it was. I should have returned this DVD to Amazon, but I had already opened it without thinking that the Walmart sticker was strange.

3911566,5,B002DKZR4Y,This was a great find because I am a big Def Leppard fan and my daughter (11) is a huge Taylor Swift fan! Now her fondness for Taylor has rubbed off on me and my fondness for DefLep on her! They take part in singing each other's hits and it is very well done.,1284768000,,259,3.814814814814815

I still pop this into the DVD player quite often, looks great on our big screen with the BOSE surround sound it seems like we're actually at the concert.",1271808000,,298,4.0508474576271185
3911568,5,B002DKZR4Y,"If you can find one, BUY IT!! Made for K-Mart only when Taylor was still a teenager. Loved everything about this DVD. Def Leppard hasn't lost a thing.",1265760000,,150,4.392857142857143
3911569,5,B002DKZR4Y,"Ha-ha, really just discovered the CMT Crossroads series on YouTube.  Enjoy many of them but this is the only one currently available on DVD.  I would buy a couple more, too, probably if more were available.  Regardless, I previously wasn't a Taylor Swift fan, figuring she was just another teen on the scene.  Then I saw these videos and how she seemed to really ""get it."" Indeed, Taylor & Def Leppard made a great collaboration and came up with some of the best versions of their songs.  Not all, sure, but enough to make this DVD fun and worth its price.  Now if only Taylor would record more of her songs with Def Leppard!",1265155200,4,625,4.43859649122807
3911570,5,B002DKZR4Y,"This DVD is without a Doubt a Pleasant surprise!
As a Concert it's close to Flawless
Teaming up a up and coming Country/Pop Singer  With the Iconic British Rock Band
Might sound a Bit Strange @ first But, it so works...............

Even if you are NOT a Country Music fan. It's worth checking out
(You can see various Clips of it on Youtube) But, You don't get the complete Effect
Seeing the Concert on a Good size TV with the 5.1 Audio makes you Both appreciate and still Believe That The Music Industry Might still just Survive with Such Great and Unique music being put out to Fans!
The Set is Great the Singing at times has been Changed-up, tweaked But, it adds allot to The Show

This Concert should be Thrown in the Face of Both ""Would be music Critics"" and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Def Leppard is so worthy to be Put, in the R&R Hall of Fame
Despite all the Hating/Bashing from Various People  who feel they Should Not be put in the Hall of Fame (Like Howard 100's Wrap Up Show Hosts Jon Hein & Gary Dell'Abate to name a few)
They are so Much more then a Hair Band They are Pure Rock and Roll
And still sound Amazing L!ve!

Not much of A Country Music Fan But, Taylor Swift has a Very good Voice and She can run neck and neck with a Major Band
At times you can tell she is a bit In awe Singing next to them
But, it's understandable it make her seem Both Cute and very down to earth (No Diva)
Would Love to see this get a BR Transfer
Audio Mix 5.1 Dolby Digital  -10/10
A Must have for ALL Taylor Swift & Def Leppard  Fans!
One of the Best Full Leigh Concerts I've watched on  DVD,BR, AND HD-DVD
Great Job CMT and everyone behind this Concert!

3911571,5,B002DKZR4Y,I've watched this Crossroads on CMT and It was really awesome! So I bought the DVD and I watched it again..It's great. Buy it!!!,1250294400,3,128,4.375
3911572,5,B002DKZR4Y,"Huge Def Leppard fan. Country music? Not so much, However, this works perfectly. Joe Elliott seems to be losing some voice as he gets older but Taylor Swift is a great complement to their songs and vice versa",1248307200,4,208,4.5
3911573,5,B002DKZR4Y,"I found this crossroads concert on my -on demand free music station- and have watched it serveal times. The free recording will no longer be available on 7/7 so I am checking out the cost to get my own. I love every minute of the concert and even more & more everytime I watch it. Would recommend if you like southern rock. Def Lepperd was big when I was high school but country was not so popular. Country has come a long way and there are so many styles. I enjoy the duets and the two sound great together. The concert is not much to watch as far as entertaining (moves, lights, and other visual) but it's ok. They both look great and I still like watching them sing. During the concert interview Taylor Swift explains that she grew up listening to DL as her mother was a fan.  Also that DL was engrained during her brain development, her voice & vocals are awesome.",1246752000,3,868,4.2926829268292686
3911574,5,B002DKZR4Y,"The brilliant thing about CMT Crossroads is that it combines rock and country acts that you might think would NEVER work.  And this has never been more apparent than in this pairing of country's new golden girl, and one of the 80's most-celebrated ""hair metal"" bands.  It should have been a trainwreck, but it works beautifully.

Swift lets her inner rock girl loose right from the start, with the opening lines of Def's ""Photograph.""  Fans have seen her signature moves by now, but it's refreshing to see them put in service of some really rockin' tunes.  And Joe Elliot & Co. complement Swift's songs effortlessly.

The interviews and clips from the press conference are breezy and informative, as well.  Elliot quips that his country co-star wasn't even born when the band's massive ""Hysteria"" was released in 1987.

The only minor complaint I have is that the 3 bonus tracks are only available separately.  Surely these could have been incorporated back into the concert.  But don't miss them, because all 3 are as good as anything in the main event.

This Crossroads is THE home video concert event of the year.  Pick it up!",1246492800,2,1129,4.7927461139896375
3911575,5,B002DKZR4Y,"Note: This is a Walmart Exclusive.

Outstanding!!! This combination turned out to be the one of the best CMT Crossroads Shows ever. Taylor Swift has her Country Band, which includes a fiddle player, she also has guitar players and a drummer also. Then you get Def Leppard , one of the Greatest Rock Bands of all time, with the line-up of Joe Elliot, Vivian Campbell, Rick Allen, Phil Collen and Rick Savage. The performances of these 2 bands along with lead singers Taylor Swift & Joe Elliot are simply outstanding.

Some of the songs you get include: ""Photograph"", ""Picture to Burn"", ""Hysteria"", ""Pour Some Sugar on ME"", ""Love Story"", and ""When Love and Hate Collide"". Plus, you get great conversations between Taylor Swift and the members of Def Leppard.

Plus, you get bonus performances of ""Our Story"", ""Love"", and ""Two Steps Behind"".

Apparently, this dvd is being sold only by Walmart as a ""Walmart Exclusive"".

This is an outstanding concert DVD, and I highly recommend it. Thanks!!!!",1245456000,9,991,4.910179640718563

8365352,5,B002DKZR4Y,"Great show! I loved every minute of it. Def Leppard and Taylor Swift (the country western 19 year old version) should not work, and yet somehow it does so beautifully. The bonus track of Def Leppard's ""Love"" was moving. Hysteria is incredible. And the transition from one of Swifts hits to ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" makes you want to stand and cheer. If you are any sort of fan of Def Leppard, this is a must have, but be careful, it might turn you into a ""Swiftie"" like it did Eliot.",1514937600,,482,4.25
8365353,5,B002DKZR4Y,Huge fan of Def Leppard (since early 80s) but for some reason overlooked these performances. She did phenomenal with the Def Leppard songs.,1503532800,,139,5.086956521739131

8365356,4,B002DKZR4Y,"This unlikely collaboration really works! Everyone is obviously having a good time and it shows. Some documentary moments, but done without detracting from the music. This is kind of an obscure item, so if you know of any rabid young Taylor Swift fans and want to surprise them with something new, present them with this little gem.  I'm so glad I decided to take a chance on this show!",1500681600,,386,4.594202898550725
