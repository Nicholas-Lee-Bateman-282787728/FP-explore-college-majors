3129580,3,B0014D5QU6,"I was researching for a likable yoga instructor and Sara Ivanhoe seems to be very popular. I haven't done yoga that long, but I was exposed to it before.

Pros: -short: perfect for days you don't have enough time.
  -easy: good for days you want to take it easy.
  -likeable instructor: it's just a preference.

Cons: -too easy for people who want to have some challenge.
  -I don't think you can lose weight with just doing 1 dvd each day because I don't think it raises your heart rate high enough.

Overall. I do like the instructor and I hope she has more challenging dvds that I can try in the future.",1275350400,2,606,4.339285714285714

8255190,5,B0014D5QU6,"I do these every morning (well, almost).  They're short enough that it's hard to justify skipping it, which is exactly what I need to get me in gear.  They're beginner level and easy to follow, but still present enough of a challenge to keep me engaged.  I've always been a big fan of Sara Ivanhoe's instruction.

One of the discs did not function in the first set I received.  I exchanged it quickly and with no hassle, and my new set works perfectly.  Overall very pleased!",1496275200,,475,4.465116279069767

HOWEVER the last laugh will be mine, because eventually I'LL BE ABLE TO DO THIS TOO, AND I WILL FEEL VERY, VERY SMUG when I'm walking down the street. VERY SMUG. :D Seriously, though, it's an amazing workout, and you can pick which body area you want to focus on each time. You can also do just 20 min or up to an hour and a half, your choice. I'm doing 20 min. at a time, because, as mentioned, my body wants me just to lay on the floor and watch these videos at this point. ;)",1435536000,2,572,3.8974358974358974

8255195,5,B0014D5QU6,"Totally worth the buy.  She is a good instructor. She has a voice that is not irritating and it is both challenging and any age appropriate.

8255196,5,B0014D5QU6,"These yoga routines are great... if you are short on time, 20 minutes is perfect to squeeze in a yoga practice... if you have more time, it is easy to combine 2 or 3 of the routines to create a challenging practice.  Sara's instruction is easy to follow and not intimidating at all.  She explains modifications for the more difficult poses if you are still a beginner (like me).  I definitely feel stronger and more flexible since I started doing these routines daily.",1381017600,2,468,4.614457831325301
