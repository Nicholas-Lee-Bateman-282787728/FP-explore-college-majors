I challenge you to make sense of any film in its entirety! Some are two completely different storylines[shot elsewhere]spliced into one. It works for the fact that what exists on the screen was even made possible. Fans of slapstick and chopsocky with some bum-kicking Taoist priest + Chinese zombies & hopping vampires should get pleasure out of these exquisite abominations. If the world of silly kung fu films with ""horror"" elements is a place you've never tread on... be wary. This may sound cliched, but for me, a lil puffpuff doesn't hurt, prior to viewing:)
Packaging: I've owned two of these collections, and both were new/factory-sealed. The discs will become loose while in transit. I'd look for a very good to like new set and ask the merchant to make sure the discs are firmly secure in their intended positions.

My review includes five stars. That measures the amount of entertainment I had on a laughable level, b-grade scale. If you are looking for serious horror, there is none of that here. Don't forget your sticky rice!",1359417600,2,1135,4.942408376963351
