7844878,5,6303359329,"Great B Movie classic of the 80's with a great young cast of familiar faces. Remember Sherilyn Fenn who went on to fame in ""Twin Peaks?"" And the main reason is for Betsy Russell, the ""it"" girl of the times after her Lady Godiva romp in ""Private School."" Years later she stars in the ""Saw"" movies. Also stars the young male lead who starred opposite Brooke Shields in ""Endless Love"", Martin Hewitt. This is only on VHS right now so it's hard to find at a low price, but if you do, jump on it!",1408320000,3,491,4.178947368421053
