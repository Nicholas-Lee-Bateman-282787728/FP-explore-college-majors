8516503,4,B007H8ECQQ,"The schools for whites in the South in the 50s are beautiful buildings with trees and nice lawns, plentiful supplies, and bus transportation. The schools for blacks are, generally, one-room, ramshackle buildings with few supplies and no bus transportation. Prominent lawyers focus on one school district in South Carolina to force through the courts equal education for all. The fight gets ugly with white retaliation. This film is a well-acted and interesting portrayal of the historic incidents that took place leading up to equal education for all throughout the United States. This movie is well worth watching.",1510358400,,615,5.350515463917525
