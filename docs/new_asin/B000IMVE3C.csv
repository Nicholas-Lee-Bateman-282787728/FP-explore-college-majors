8146476,3,B000IMVE3C,"I like this series!

Plot and Characters: The story follows a man called Sorata Muon aka Mouse the worlds greatest thief! along his with sidekicks/helpers/servants/people who do pretty much the hardwork of the group. His 3 companions Mei Momozono,  Yayoi Kuribayashi, and  Kakio Hazuki, take on the greatest of thiefts every. It is like the motto of the show ""There is NOTHING in the world that Mouse can't steal"". And this show proves it.

Pros: This complete collection had all 12 episodes so you won't miss a thing. The plot is good but could have been better.

Cons: The girls in here try to have sex with Sorata but he always denies them so this show is one of those shows where the women wear little clothes or nude alot of the times. The plot over all could have been written out better, other than haveing a part 1 or 2 all the episodes far apart from eachother. The villians in this series are either made completly perfect but are utalized badly or the villians that used alot in the show aren't show their full potential in the show at all.

Neutral note: there are only 12 episodes but they are 15 minutes long, BUT if you skip the theme song and ending credits its cut down to 12 minutes an episode so you can finnish this entire series in less than 3 hours, so far the fastest ive watched the show is 2 hours and 39 minutes with OUT missing one bit of the plot or episodes at all.

Additional need to know note: on here I see it for the complete collection is being sold for $40, the box that holds them is a thing cheeply made cover,  you can buy the 2 dvd cases sepreatly for 19 dollars and SAVE your self 21 dollars in the process. But its good over all so buy it!!",1405555200,,1682,4.267295597484277
8146477,5,B000IMVE3C,"I love the relationships between the characters, and the fanservice is super yummy! Lots of breasts and panties. Also, I like the characters' backstory's, and I like Sorata himself. Another thing that makes this anime special to me is that the characters are adults teachers instead of high school students, and also, while he is shy, he ISN'T a virgin, and he isn't evil despite the fact that he's a thief. I can't say much wore without spoiling anything.

EDIT: I just got this in yesterday. This image is the picture for the first dvd holder. The actual boxset cover is different, but you still get this picture when you buy it. It's worth it.",1375574400,,646,4.6173913043478265
8146478,5,B000IMVE3C,I LOVE how he steals everything. Im a girl so i didn't like all the chick nudity but i kinda think it added to it. It looks at the end like their setting it up for more episodes. I hope so <3,1312416000,,191,3.5714285714285716

I must say that this is a very cool anime. It's about a guy who is the 20th generation of his family who has gone under the guise of Mouse, a thief out to snag treasures. By day he's a mild-mannered art teacher, but at night he becomes the mysterious thief assisted and served by three buxom beauties.

The whole thing is 90 minutes inside one Disc and very convenient to watch.  Just click the main menu. and you can discover what it has.",1294099200,3,469,4.188888888888889
8146480,2,B000IMVE3C,"Mouse was one of my first Anime featues. I didn't care much for the plots, and the character movement for action sequences was terrible. I did like the clarity and artistic drawings of the characters and their rather overdeveloped......personalities!",1288137600,2,250,5.435897435897436
8146481,5,B000IMVE3C,Mouse is a master thief  and there's nothing he cant snatch!  although this is only a 12 episode show I laughed at every episode and it was worth every penny! if you shop around you'll be able to pick up the show for a good price. As far as the show goes if you like beautiful flirtatious girls and a funny story of a school teacher/secret thief with three beautiful girls who call him master you'll enjoy this!,1263513600,7,411,4.256410256410256
8146482,1,B000IMVE3C,"To be fair to the creators of this. I should have known what I was purchasing from the cover.

It wasn't horrible but it is the first anime that I purchased that I didn't watch in its entirety. In a nutshell it is pretty shallow entertainment.

It kind of reminds me of Lupin 3rd (but not as funny and not as intelligent) with an aim at the ""adult"" humor, without the adult content.

It is lacking because it isn't so adult one could call it Hentai, and the approach the artist/story tellers took to ""rewarding"" his staff is just juvenile.

Also, the stories are just not very good. The story telling is not very solid. It was kind of insulting to ones intelligence... This review might be a bit rough but in some parts it really makes one think ""Oh man why did I buy this?"".

It is like some conceptual cross between Lupin & DNAngel that just feels like a low quality adult story without the adult content.

My wife and I watched the first couple episodes and just couldn't watch anymore the blatant sexual advances of his ""triple D cupped"" ""cat-girl"" ""helpers"" just seems out of place and a obvious attempt at creating sexuality where none exists...

If you're young I could see how this would appeal but an older crowd (I'm 35) should really pass this one up.",1195689600,10,1262,4.437229437229437
