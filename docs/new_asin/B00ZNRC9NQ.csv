7284602,5,B00ZNRC9NQ,"After spending money in the past to get collections with one or two episodes of these series this is literally the mother lode. I can finally own my favorite shows in their entirety. Figures it's a release NOT from the US. Still plays beautifully in my American DVD player, so fear not. A must for 70's children.",1462924800,4,312,4.491228070175438
7284603,4,B00ZNRC9NQ,"There are a pair of one-star reviews for this box set so far, based solely on the fact that the box, which contains every episode of four different series, doesn't contain every episode of all of the Kroffts' two-dozen or so series.  That's not fair.  The box has four shows and should be judged on the merits of what it does contain, not what it lacks.  Maybe some different box down the line, a volume two, will have some other shows.

I'm docking a star because the episodes were not restored, and the original master tapes were evidently not cared for very closely over the years.  The Electra Woman tapes are the slightly re-edited versions from the early 1980s ""Krofft Super Stars"" syndication package, so they're actually a generation down to start with, so the picture quality is a little fuzzy throughout.

And yes, to confirm, even though this is a Region 4 release, the discs appear to be region-free.  They play fine on both my US laptop and DVD player.",1457568000,27,965,4.608187134502924
7284604,5,B00ZNRC9NQ,"Those that have rated this set one star because a particular show was not included have done this set a tremendous disservice.

Included is every episode of four Sid & Marty Krofft favorites, H.R. Pufnstuf, Land of the Lost, Sigmund and the Sea Monsters, and Electra Woman & Dyna Girl. Considering that the second season of Sigmund and the entirety of Electra Woman has never before been released in the US market, this Australian release is a boon to fans.

No extras? No big deal.",1456617600,12,482,4.658823529411765
7284605,3,B00ZNRC9NQ,"Pricey for what you get, plus none of the extras from Pufnstuf or Sigmund Season 1 are included. (I didn't buy the Land of the Lost DVDs so I don't know what extras were on that set, but I can tell you this box set contains NOTHING extra, just the episodes.)  I bought this specifically so that I could get the 2nd season of Sigmund and decent copies of Elektra Woman and Dyna Girl, neither of which has been released commercially prior to this.  I don't know if the masters were sourced from the same place, but the picture quality for the first episode of Pufnstuf looks slightly worse for wear than the US release, but not enough to quibble.

For $67, it would have been nice to include a little more in the way of never before released programs. Perhaps there's a Vol. 2 coming.  I suppose this is worth it if you're a completist like I am, but if you want to keep your extras, hang on to the original sets.  I'd wait for a good sale before purchasing.",1453161600,12,956,4.259668508287293

7284608,5,B00ZNRC9NQ,"A must for Krofft fans, despite being an Australian release that on the packaging says the discs are region 4, ALL DISCS ARE REGION 0 AND PLAY PERFECTLY IN U.S. DVD PLAYERS. The set includes the complete series of H.R. Pufnstuf, Land of the Lost, Sigmund and the Sea Monsters (season 2 currently unavailable in the US) and for the first time ever, the complete series of Electrawoman and Dynagirl. The rhino VHS of Electrawoman has only two episodes and sells used for around $75 on Amazon. Not hard to figure out this is the better deal. Now hopefully there is a Vol. 2 box that has Dr. Shrinker, Wonderbug and some of the other unreleased Krofft series. When out-of-print DVD sets of Bugaloos and Lidsville are selling for over $250 on Amazon there is pretty clearly a market for these shows. Get it together Sid and Marty, at least offer fans DVD-R sets!",1442102400,39,857,4.571428571428571

8720532,4,B00ZNRC9NQ,"Great value for what you get if you don't already own any of these titles. I did and bought it so I could get season 2 of ""Sigmund and the Sea Monsters"" and the ""Electra Woman and Dyna Girl"" series. I thought the quality was good (looks better on smaller TVs, but still decent on my 65"". I like the thinner packaging than the earlier Rhino DVD releases. However, with this set you do NOT get any of the bonus features that are found on the Rhino releases. No interviews with the stars, bonus commentary, show quizzes, etc. Looks like the Kroffts won't be releasing any more sets anytime soon (sure there have been hints over the last 15 or so years, but nothing ever happens) so this might be the only way to supplement your collection.",1502755200,2,736,4.37956204379562
8720533,5,B00ZNRC9NQ,WOW! What a blast from the past. Super Kool Thanks It's nice to take that step back once in a while so we don't forget how far we've come.,1496448000,,138,3.793103448275862
8720534,2,B00ZNRC9NQ,"So I was a big fan of the show as a kid and when they say the complete series and the ""motherload"" I see nothing of these?

Wonderbug | Lost Saucer | Bugaloos | Far Out Space Nuts | Dr. Shrinker | Land of The Lost etc.

I know you can buy Bugaloos and Land of the Lost series but to me it's just dumb they haven't released a complete box or all of the episodes for each show?  :\",1490832000,5,379,3.7125
