3172618,2,B0017INRH2,"This is a remarketed title due to the recent craze of the movie, the Eye, thanks to the relentless bad American remakes of good Asian horror. This movie was originally called The Eye 10.  This movie came out quite a while ago and techniclaly it is the third installment of the ""Eye"" series. I am a huge fan of Asain horror, including The Eye and The Eye 2 (The originals of course).  However, the Eye 10 has had such terrible reviews I could not bring myself to spend any money on it.  If it ever shows up on cable as a free movie, I would try to watch it just to see how bad it really is.  I think it is crazy that this movie was retitled for Americans (even though it is not an American movie and has not been remade, make no mistake that this was renamed for the benefits of the Americans through Lionsgate to cash in on the recent aforementioned popularity).

What were they thinking?  They were thinking they had too many ghost stories left to tell and by their own admission, wanted to make a ghost encyclopedia (as it were).  That they decided to make it into a comedy as well is an unusual choice (I'm not certain why they took this route, as it really doesn't work on that level).  The plot involves a group of dopey kids who swap ghost stories then decide that they'd like to see some ghosts.  As luck, or bad writing, would have it, one of the dopes just happened to have a recipe book on how to attract ghosts.  They put it to the test with disastrous results (not the least of which made this film the final casualty).  Yes, they had to trot out a Ouija Board and play hide and seek in the dark.  One of their number goes missing.  Another member is stalked by a basketball!  There are ghosts aplenty but none of them are the least bit scary.  And for good measure, two of the remaining survivors decide to infiltrate the spirit world.  Everything that could go wrong does.  Worse, they make a lame attempt to tie this to the first two films by referencing them in their roster of ghost stories and using two brief clips identifying them (product placement?).  And yes, there's another elevator scene, they do seem to favor those.  Other than that, the humor is laid on rather thick (complete with a new version of a tongue-lashing).  I can't say I really liked it but it was watchable and I am ashamed to admit I laughed a couple of times (which goes to prove it wasn't a horror movie).

8266117,2,B0017INRH2,"The Eye 3 compares unfavorably to the first two movies in the series, and even taken on its own merits  is just not a good movie. Eye 1 and 2 were both creepy, and 2 actually had a surprisingly profound ending. 3 is not only trite, but cannot decide what tone to strike, alternating between what is supposed to be scary and what is supposed to be funny, including one idiotic scene in which a ghost makes one of the characters breakdance. The soundtrack is similarly  disjointed, with  moments a very average horror score alternating with a rhythmic dance music score which makes no sense  within the context  of the story  or the genre. Even the narrative methodology is disjointed. For no apparent reason, about halfway through the movie we suddenly hear several minutes of first-person narration by one of the characters, the only use of first-person in the entire movie. Nonsense. In addition to all of these issues, it is a full 30 minutes into the movie before any kind of  plot surfaces. A low point for the Pangs.",1526688000,,1021,4.638888888888889
