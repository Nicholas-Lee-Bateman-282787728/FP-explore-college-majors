5372761,5,B009YQJ368,"my son loves trains, he loves Thomas too I have purchased several Thomas but most are watched through prime which is worth every dime.",1363564800,,134,4.625
5372762,5,B009YQJ368,Good movie. Entertaining. Grand kids loved it.  The characters are interesting and one can image a world of talking trains.,1360454400,,123,5.15
5372763,4,B009YQJ368,"The DVD of Thomas : Muddy Matters, arrived on time and in excellent condition. This will make a great addition to the collection of Thomas and Friends for my Grand Daughter, who is a big fan.",1360281600,,191,4.333333333333333
5372764,5,B009YQJ368,"Getting messy is one of my boys' specialties and they love watching others get dirty.  In Muddy Waters, Thomas and Friends make messes in the mud and solve problems.  I love it because it teaches my boys lessons in a fun and safe way, and they don't even realize they are learning!  The lessons taught are working together, decision making and responsibility.  This DVD features five Thomas filled episodes all perfect for any preschooler!

""Muddy Matters""
""Thomas and the Garbage Train""
""Don't Bother Victor""
""Whiff's Wish""
""Thomas Toots the Crows""",1359504000,5,549,5.055555555555555
5372765,5,B009YQJ368,"I knew we had a winner when I saw the banner on top of the DVD that said ""Icky, Sticky, Messy Good Times!""  Aren't all messy times fun?  They are with my kids.  They get a kick out of being messy and making messes.  Me, not so much, but I am perfectly find with them watching someone else make a mess in Thomas & Friends: Muddy Matters.

Thomas has a habit of getting into tricky situations.  This time in ""Muddy Matters,"" he is joined by his friends as James gets covered in mud in the first episode!  As always, they work together to rectify their predicament.  This is great at teaching kids teamwork.  I want my kids to learn how to problem solve so it's nice to have specific examples, especially with characters they love!  This happened to be my sons favorite episode on the disc so we watched it several times to make the lesson sink in.

The next episode ""Thomas and the Garbage Train"" is Thomas's turn to get dirty when he is working with garbage. He gets called a stinky engine by Diesel, which Thomas does not like.  Reed giggled at the name and laughed throughout the whole episode whenever someone said stinky.  Little four-year old boys are obsessed with all things stinky and dirty!  When Thomas abandons his friend Whiff for his own selfish reasons, he pays a great price.  Thomas is humble and admits his mistake and apologizes and makes a sacrifice to do the right thing.  Great things to fill my sons head with, even if he walks around saying stinky all day!

There are three more episodes filled with more life lessons on things all children need to learn!  Hearing it from shows they love often makes it click more than hearing it from their parents over and over again. Hit Entertainment is great at providing fun bonus features and Thomas & Friends: Muddy Matters is no exception!  There are FOUR great bonus features on this one including a game, puzzle, music video and fun activities.

My son has loved Thomas since he was two and I keep waiting for the novelty to wear off but Thomas & Friends Muddy Matters was just as beloved as the rest!  We can't wait to see what is in store for Thomas & Friends next!",1358208000,4,2134,4.434447300771208

My grandson has heard those songs so many times from watching these collections that he sings them as he's walking around pretending to be a steam engine.

If you have a child in your home who loves Thomas & Friends as much as my grandson, these videos are perfect. Being able to stream them free is more than worth the cost of the Prime membership...we watch at least one of these per day.",1383696000,,583,4.5
