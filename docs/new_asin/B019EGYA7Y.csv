7572862,1,B019EGYA7Y,"What a joke is right! Only two of the 5 movie were descent to watch.  Had I known that up front, I would not have purchased the lot but looked for the two individually.  The two that I found to be very good movies were THE DAY THE EARTH MOVED with Jackie Cooper, and FIRE FROM BELOW with Kevin Sorbo.  The Chain Reaction, Epicenter, The Day the Sky Exploded were the pits.  For the titles of those movies should not have been more nude than the action of the titles.  Bad Form!!!",1486771200,,479,4.163043478260869
7572863,1,B019EGYA7Y,"2nd addendum to original review: the movie Fire From Below with Kevin Sorbo is good. But that is the only one so far. The only remaining movie I still have to watch is Chain Reaction. If that is the one with Keeanu Reeves & Morgan Freeman, then I already know I like it.

Addendum to my review below:  I am watching the Epicenter movie on this movie disc set right now. So far it is more of an espionage movie, than a natural disaster movie & it's ok.
I still say, don't waste your $!

My rating: negative stars!!!
Don't waste your $!!
I am only 5 minutes in to the 2nd movie (I am watching them out of order), on this 5 movie set, & I am about to switch to a different movie.
Also, I didn't finish the 1st movie, either.
I am a fan of natural diasaster movies that you see on the Sci-Fi channel. So far though, all the movies on this disc are aweful! I will say it again, don't waste your $!",1485475200,,892,4.0

7572867,4,B019EGYA7Y,"Bought this collection for The Day the Earth Moved. It was a old 70's TV movie that I actually enjoyed and always remembered as a kid and it is still enjoyable today. A speed trap town catches a photographer passing thru and he meets everyone in the town and befriend them so later when he returns to takes ariel pictures that when developed show a red line on the photos which everyone thinks is due to bad film turns out be a freak thing that somehow the red line on the picture shows where earthquakes will happen which then gives him enough time to return to warn and save a small desert town and his new found friends. Like the stars here they include Jackie Cooper as the photographer, Cleavon Little as his business partner, Stella Stevens as their other business partner  and Lucille Benson as the mail lady. Really like the movie. Also there is a movie here called The Chain Reaction that has Mel Gibson as a un-credited Bearded Mechanic in a garage that is a hard sought collectors item for Mel Gibson fans. The other films here are ok but it was worth it for me just to get the day the earth moved.",1474502400,6,1109,4.357487922705314
