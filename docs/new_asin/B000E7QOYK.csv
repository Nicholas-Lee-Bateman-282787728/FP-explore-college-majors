It's worth it just to watch Spurrier have a meltdown on the sidelines =)

8106917,3,B000E7QOYK,"They (Walmart) had this playing while over the holidays and I just could not get enough of it.. I found the quality very poor, because it was taped off the live feed from the sponsoring network.  How can we ever forget the famous run by Tommy Frazier.  I looked and looked for the real thing, done by a film editing crew of which I thought UNL would have had it done or made.  If so there are none to be found.  Of course everyone's favorite MC announcer, Brent Musburger, is one of the reason I turned off the sound and put on th radio.  Even though it should have taken less than two hours to put this all on dvd, it seems like it runs long as well.  But maybe that's because they do a lot of the instant replays.  Overall I would give it a A rating.  I wold have thought that NU would have had their say in it, but apparently not, as in all rights were voided by rule of the NCAA and ABC.",1400284800,,891,3.994350282485876

8106919,4,B000E7QOYK,"After Nebraska's loss to Wisconsin in the Big 10 Championship (12/1/12), a video like this can bring a person back to seeing life as possibly worth living again.",1354492800,2,161,4.785714285714286
8106920,4,B000E7QOYK,"The 1995 Nebraska football team is widely regarded as the best of all-time and this game showcases the reasons why. An offensive line that averaged 300 pounds allowed Tommie Frazier, Lawrence Phillips, and Ahmad Green to run the triple option to perfection, averaging 400 yards on the ground per game. Teams knew they would run and couldn't stop it. Nebraska beat 4 teams in the top 10 by no less than 23 points and in this game put 62 on a supposedly faster and more athletic #2 Florida (rushing for 524 yards) while their defense crushed and confused future Heisman winner Danny Wuerffel (sacking him 7 times) and the Gators high-powered offense all game long, holding them to 269 yards, with -28 rushing yards.
  I've seen the championship games of 2 of the more recent teams mentioned in the ""Greatest of All-Time"" argument (the '04 USC Trojans and '01 Miami Hurricanes) and while both those teams dominated the game, their opponents helped make the score lopsided by making foolish turnovers. The thing that stands out in this game is the simple inability of Florida to move the ball on offense and the inability to stop the bigger, stronger Husker offense. This is summed up best by a 75-yard TD run by QUARTERBACK Tommie Frazier in which he breaks at least 7 tackles.
 I gave this 4 stars because there were few bonus features or interviews regarding this incredible team and the nearly 3 year perfect run they had. A missed field goal in the 1993 Championship Game was all that kept this team from winning 3 undefeated national championships in a row. The video and audio quality are excellent.",1287187200,2,1602,4.734767025089606
