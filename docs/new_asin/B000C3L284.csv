2452536,1,B000C3L284,"The two previous reviewers pretty much summed up my opinion of Foxworthy & co's sophomoric humor, but surely there's no wrong in voicing my discontent nontheless. ""Blue Collar TV"" was basically an ambiguous attempt at making Jeff Foxworthy somewhat relevant in pop-culture, for the hundredth time. Please, just disappear into the briny depths of television's obscure past.

The original concept was simple, if tolerable: Rednecks telling jokes about rednecks. Oh ho ho. Far from groundbreaking, but now these guys have a sketch comedy show? How many times can an audience cackle feverishly at the exact same dull mantras, like ""GIT R DUN"" and ""You might be a redneck,"" despite the fact everyone knows these jokes by now, fan or not? When will these asinine groaners lose their appeal? When will pre-pubescent Foxworthy fanboys quit repeating these self-characteratures' jokes with their crackling croaks and feigned accents?

You are above this. (Unlike the silly muffins who voted ""no."") Stop reading these reviews and exit this page.

2452537,2,B000C3L284,"The fact that Jeff Foxworthy got another chance after his dismal and nauseating sitcom must be in the hands of ethereal beings. His stand-up comedy is good, and transcends socio- and economic borders, providing humor for the lowliest of poverty-ridden cretins to the enjoyment of despied and well-off yuppies.  However, anyone so into the humor of Jeff and his cronies that they would actually purchase an extended version of what was sympatheticaly displayed on tv... well i personally question that purchaser's sanity.",1138665600,3,520,5.341463414634147

I am so glad to be able to share this with my kids~ who get a bit of a giggle at the ""acting""~ but still enjoy the show.

Good, clean fun for families, any time we want it!",1375660800,,215,3.652173913043478
2452540,5,B000C3L284,These guys are VERY funny and not dirty.  You will laugh at this.  It's so nice to find so-called clean comics.  I think this should still be on tv.,1357862400,,148,4.0344827586206895

2452543,5,B000C3L284,Very humerous. Fun to see the Guys doing skits and playing characters. But you *have* to get the full series for it to be a proper experience.,1346976000,,142,4.296296296296297

2452546,5,B000C3L284,"Most comedy we see on TV which features ""working class"" people gives us an ""up-scale"" writer's idea or view of what these people are like. Blue Collar TV gives a working man's view of ""blue collar"" people and their comic life situations. I would have a few criticisms of the excessive scatology and excessive sex jokes, but these are really just reactions to the way things are today in our decadent American society.  Jeff Foxworthy and the others in the cast work great together as a team. I like the much better than the individual stand-up routines of Foxworthy, Larry, Bill and Ron. All in all, Blue Collar TV is a breath of fresh air. I can't seem to find it on local Chicago TV anymore. I wonder if they are still doing it?",1169510400,,730,4.447761194029851
2452547,5,B000C3L284,"There's a reason why Larry The Cable Guy was the top grossing comedian of 2005 - he is the funniest man on the planet! I feel sorry for those who don't ""git"" it! Too bad they lack a sense of humor.",1141948800,4,197,3.8292682926829267
2452548,4,B000C3L284,"The reason that Jeff, Bill, and Larry are so popular is because their comedy is geared for your ordinary American worker.  If you don't like the humour (ie the last three reviews) than you are probably one of the 'upscale viewers' that the show sometimes pokes fun at.  All it takes is getting down to the Blue Collar level to enjoy these sketches, and believe me they are pretty funny.  Yes, they do tend to redo some of their routines, but that tends to be because they get a laugh every time they are used!  These guys manage to come up with fresh humour for every show, and I have not seen an episode yet that was a complete miss.  In short:  get off your high horse, get down in the mud, and laugh your rear end off.  At the risk of being cliche, Git-er-done!",1139961600,5,764,4.227586206896552
