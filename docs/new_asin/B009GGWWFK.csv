Since I have his 2 CD's I don't use the others that I have! His way is just the Best for me! I can keep up with him& he don't rush you wiht the moves! Just Love this purchase! Try it,you won't be sorry! Thanks Bonnie:)",1366329600,5,374,3.6296296296296298
5325721,5,B009GGWWFK,This is a high quality video and the content is satisfactory. I would recommend this video to anyone interested in Tai Chi.,1365465600,4,123,4.636363636363637
5325722,2,B009GGWWFK,Did not have enough good instructional exercises. Was more of an advertisement than I expected. Had hoped for instruction in a session of exercise but that did not happen. Disappointing DVD.,1363651200,10,190,5.161290322580645
5325723,2,B009GGWWFK,It looks more like a promotional or marketing tool. I really wish I did not buy it. It is not very practical to me.,1362009600,8,115,3.8333333333333335
5325724,2,B009GGWWFK,"This instructional Tai Chi DVD is very ineffective because the instructor is shown overly explaining the easy parts while under explaining and under demonstrating the difficult parts of the routine. What should have taken a few viewings to learn has been so difficult to follow that I have still not learned the routine after a dozen viewings, with tedious and almost interminable explanations of the very easiest parts that one cannot fast-forward past. As a beginner, which I am, and which this was produced for, it angers me that the producers are so inept at making a simple instructional video.

It is a shame because everything else about the video is excellent.",1361059200,6,668,4.964285714285714
5325725,1,B009GGWWFK,Ok....some good ideas. As a teacher it didn't give me anything new. May be good for someone as an introduction to tai chi.,1359849600,5,122,4.3478260869565215
5325726,5,B009GGWWFK,Easy to follow. Very informative. I really enjoy this. It is appropriate for all ages. I highly recommend it as an introduction to Tai Chi.,1359676800,5,139,4.6

5325748,1,B009GGWWFK,"Mostly Ross yammering on about tai chi, rather than actually teaching much of anything.  Waste of time.",1407888000,2,103,5.0588235294117645

5325751,3,B009GGWWFK,"When ordering this DVD, I didn't realize that it was simply a copy of the PBS program.  The DVD spends as much time on audience participation (if I see one more head nod I may scream) as it does on the instructions of Mr. Ross.  And some of the movement guidance by Mr. Ross is not shown because of the focus on the audience's attempts to follow him.  I found David-Dorian Ross to be interesting and engaging, and he increased my interest in Tai Chi.  However I think I'll try to find a DVD focused on the instructor, and one that doesn't see the need to assure me that others are having as much difficulty being graceful as I.",1384992000,2,627,4.243697478991597
5325752,5,B009GGWWFK,I chose it because I had seen him on TV. I am profoundly hard of hearing and have trouble understanding a lot of people. But him I could understand clearly with no problem.,1382745600,,172,4.242424242424242
5325753,2,B009GGWWFK,"If you want to watch someone talk about Tai chi and how good for you it is than go ahead and get it, you won't learn many movements. I got it so I could follow along with a video and get some exercise. Definitely is not that kind of video. A shame too, because I really like Tai chi.",1378512000,3,283,3.8135593220338984
5325754,5,B009GGWWFK,"This was a featured presentation shown once on PBS.  I thought it would be
helpful for centering and balance as I continue to grow ""in wisdom,age,and grace"".
Though a ""beginner"" in this exercise now, the directions for each movement are
beautifully explained through the use of ""mind pictures"" or mental imagery..
I have found these movements very helpful, and look forward to being able
to move through a complete set of these dance-like motions in the near future.",1368316800,4,466,4.9743589743589745

8541269,1,B009GGWWFK,"DO NOT BUY this video. It is basically an infomercial, with 60 minutes of talk and 5 minutes of movement. I should have read Amazon's Editorial Review first. I rented it from my local library, and I'm so glad I didn't buy it.",1491264000,,225,4.255813953488372
