8004464,5,B0000YEE0I,"My take on the Documentary is simple.

Fellini is a genius, and because of that immense stretch of humanity not an easy ""bite"" to digest.
The true light of this documentary is not to exacerbate the complex master Fellini character but leveraging the Entertainment side of it, to develop a simple ethos over the Master, therefore to reach the heart of people in need to be taken by hand into a very complex galaxy.

In that respect I really thought the Piccini's Documentary to be a Masterpiece, as it is so enlightened in funny stories I didn't even know about Fellini, and the magic rhythm that ms. Piccini choose, with her soave director's cut, giving to the narration and entertainment an unquestionable superb attitude.

I was taken by a magic wave of curiosity vs laugh vs tears of depth, and back to the beginning, in a very well sequenced loop of intelligent editing.

There is a world in world to dive into the complex Italian jokes with superb Italian comedians not known abroad.
The reverse apex is when Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese shine as witnesses, but not translators.

The Doc is keen to explore Fellini's relationship with the world surrounding him either with the depth of his sublime mind, but not forgetting and establishing his profound relationship with that COMEDIAN expression muse he leveraged, but sadly tied in a lost ""castle"" belonging only to Italy.

Thank you dearly Carmen.",1426723200,,1407,4.841666666666667
8004465,5,B0000YEE0I,"This film is a gem, and highly recommended to fans of Fellini. The interviews hold fresh insights, and the interview subjects go beyond just the usual suspects (Claudia Cardinale, Anthony Quinn) to key Fellini collaborators behind the camera, like Gianni di Venanzo, Nino Rota and Guiseppe Rotunno. This documentary is not a boring chronological history of a filmmaker: it is a thoughtful rumination, a poetic stroll, and a delightful dive into the man and his art.",1426204800,,465,5.131578947368421
8004466,5,B0000YEE0I,"Although this documentary was released a long time ago, it shows the creativity and imagination Fellini had making films, without a script and and ad libbing or dubbing in dialog after the scenes were shot. Who would have known? Very informative and I love LA DOLCE VITA and SATYRICON.

 A great Italian director. The actresses that were in his films many years ago, are now senior citizens and discuss his movie making they went through. He should be remembered.",1340582400,3,463,4.848101265822785
8004467,3,B0000YEE0I,"Anyone looking for an in-depth study of Fellini and his films, for new insights into his life and work, will surely be disappointed by this brief biopic. For the most part, ""The Magic of Fellini"", which has a run time of 55 minutes, consists of interviews with various people who were close to the director in some way or another: personal assistants, assistant directors, set designers, friends as well as the actors who worked with him, Italian film critics and producers. Incidentally, the cover notes that the biopic stars Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen; the notice is misleading since the Woody Allen clip is about a whole half minute long and Scorsese, though eloquent, appears for only slightly longer. There is some archival footage of Fellini himself, speaking about his films, but these clips are relatively brief and some of them will be familiar to anyone who has seen ""Federico Fellini's Autobiography"", originally broadcast on Italian television.

Aside from the interviews (of which the ones with Anthony Quinn and Donald Sutherland are the most amusing) there is some footage of Fellini working on set and going through the casting process. The films discussed the most include La Strada, La Dolce Vita and 8 . However, they are covered only very superficially and in a seemingly haphazard manner, not really shedding much light on the importance of these works. The unique partnership between Fellini and Nino Rota is discussed, as well as the partnership between Fellini and Marcello Mastroianni and these pieces are interesting, if brief. What emerges about Fellini from the documentary is that he was an enormously creative man, spontaneous (often his actors would have absolutely no idea about the dialogue or the context of scenes and he would feed them the lines as the shooting went on) and in love with his work.

Clips from such Fellini films as 8 , Amarcord, Nights of Cabiria and Roma are interspersed throughout this documentary. As such, ""The Magic of Fellini"" may be a great gift to give to someone who is not familiar with the director's work - it might serve as a nice introduction, a way of piquing the curiosity of someone who has never seen these gems. However, for Fellini fans this documentary will probably be too superficial to be of real interest.",1152576000,10,2289,4.942857142857143
