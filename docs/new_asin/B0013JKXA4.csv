3113033,5,B0013JKXA4,"From a director who has made some wonderful films, from one of the best composers there ever has been, and from an actress that gave a performance of a lifetime comes this incredible piece of work that I cannot recommend enough.

As far as acting, risks and film style - this should have won that year but at least it got submitted for the Academy (wrongly overlooked - probably due to content). A suspenseful tale that follows the lead woman through flashbacks and present time, with an editing style that makes the film a stand-out in storytelling. Xenia Rappaport convinced me beyond any doubt of her skill level, and even when you watch the supplemental documentary, she exudes a certain professionalism that warrants attention. A strong R rating of a film about retribution, loss, prostitution in the worst way, and an ending I did not see coming (considering all that had happened).

The DVD quality is excellent, the sound mixed perfectly for what was being asked, and the supplemental feature contains just the right amount of background material and non-cheesy interviews. Hope this does not get overlooked again.",1248393600,28,1122,4.962765957446808

3113038,4,B0013JKXA4,"A little hard to follow and a little hard to swallow, this film by the director of Nuovo Cinema Paradiso is gritty and loose. A dark controlled chaos in skilled hands, it feels like an army of films rushing at you all at once. It's a bit overwhelming until the grabs you, sucks you in and won't let you go performance of Xenia Rappoport kicks in. She's a magnet in the middle of a mysterious mayhem. It's too bad that the style and substance of the film will prevent it from ever becoming popular because her portrayal of suffering and sheer determination is one for the history books. The woman's got chops. She moves like an insect through the undergrowth of her seedy milieu with an androgynous, unkempt beauty that's both tempting and invisible. She's able to shift her portrayal from one emotion to another, and then another, without moving a muscle in her face--a skill few actors possess. It's her story and we follow her through it not knowing exactly what she's after or what she will do with it when she seems to have it in her grasp. That's the unknown part and Rappoport plays the mystery for all it's worth. She works the complex narrative inside her head and lets the revelations drip out slowly, uncontrollably.

Director Giuseppe Tornatore says this film is about a woman reclaiming her power as a woman (there's a great big serving of motherhood with that) after it has been stripped from her from every angle imaginable. Rappoport's character is the victim of a human slave trade that uses immigrant Eastern European women to make babies for the upper-class. She's gotten out of it, but with a lot of baggage. Some of it is misplaced and some of it is hurled at us in short, chaotic flashbacks in the beginning of the film (that's the hard to follow part), slowly unfolding to more understandable scenes as they catch up with her present life at the end of the film--a nice structural technique by the director.

Roger Ebert wrote a review of this movie which essentially lists the aspects of it he thinks he understands and the aspects he thinks he doesn't. He scores a little above average, I think, which is about as good as anyone is probably going to do. There's a noir-ish component (not a stylistic one) to the film where major events and character traits are unleashed which are way beyond the reality of any mere mortal's life. There are also plenty of cause-for-pause moments when you will consider if the means justify the end. That's the hard to swallow part but I'm not complaining. It is a movie after all, and if you've read many of my reviews you know that I take all comers when it comes to plot gymnastics as long as they don't infringe upon the integrity of my players, as long as they don't cause incredulity to appear on the faces of the actors because they don't believe the script. Giuseppe Tornatore is lucky, or smart, to have enlisted an actress with the strength of Xenia Rappoport. ET coulda popped in here and I don't think she would have missed a beat.

Speaking of beats, Ennio Morricone scored this film spectacularly.",1220918400,22,3068,4.605118829981718

3113083,4,B0013JKXA4,"THE UNKNOWN WOMAN is definitely not an American film--it assumes intelligence & concentration on the part of the viewer. It is not an ""easy"" film to watch at times, graphically depicticing horrific flashback scenes of violent abuse against women involved in the Ukrainian ""sex trade."" Fortunately these scenes are brief & most of the story unfolds in Italy where the main character Irena seeks refuge from the poverty & terrors of her exploited past. Fear not: the excellent script, direction & Xenia Rappoport's expert acting skills do not ask for sentimental tears over another oppressed woman. If anything, Irena's mode of survival & the actions she takes to further her aims are sometimes illegal & brutal. How her past affects her present is revealed slowly--hence the need for a certain degree of attention span.

One scene that really got this reviewer's attention is set in the Ukraine. Irena is trying to escape her corrupt pimp as well as to flee the country. You see her going through a landfill dump yard where she picks out scraps of food to eat. Again, you don't feel obligated to go, ""Oh, how terrible!"" It's just something she has to do so she does it--sort of like a colorized film noire version of Scarlet O'hara.

The film is the revelation of a character, a strong woman who follows her destiny--and although her fate is far from most people could endure, she manages to find non-romantic love & a place of peace within her soul.

THE UNKNOWN WOMAN is fascinating & deserves a wider audience.",1305417600,,1512,4.8076923076923075
3113084,5,B0013JKXA4,"Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore both wrote (with Massimo De Rita) and directed this intensely powerful film about the resilience of the human spirit.  It is a triumphant masterpiece of a film that somehow has escaped the eyes of the audiences here in this country.  With this DVD it should find a legion of fine film aficionados for 'La Sconosciuta'/'The Unknown Woman'/'The Other Woman' as it is variable named.

In a series of flashbacks and flash forwards the story reveals the history of a Ukrainian girl Irena (a brilliant tour de force of acting by Russian born actress known variably as Kensiya/Ksenia/Xenia Rappoport) who lives in a small village, has a handsome construction worker lover, but following a need for a better life of wealth and fame, becomes involved with the pimp Muffa (Michele Placido) who uses her popularity as a prostitute to fill his coffers while sadistically binding and beating her into submission as a breeder of babies for the black market.  Irena finally attacks Muffa, thinking she has killed him, escapes and moves to Velarchi, Italy where she rents a small apartment across the street from wealthy couple Donato (Pierfrancesco Favino) and Valeria (Claudia Gerini) Adacher who are gold dealers and their daughter Tea (Clara Dossena) who apparently is suffering from a neurological disorder that causes her parents to be overprotective of her lack of ability to cope with aggression.  First working as a servant and house cleaner Irena pleads with her employer to find her a better job, and that job just happens to be a new nanny for the Adachers.
Irena gradually ingratiates herself in to the family, earning the trust and respect of the parents and especially that of Tea.  In a series of flashbacks instigated by events that occur in the household Irena relives her gruesome past, devotes herself to training Tea how to defend herself, and in general makes herself indispensible to the family.  But many twists and turns occur: Muffa is not dead and shows up in Velarchi demanding money, beats Irena, and causes a life of desperation for Irena.  Because Irena is convinced that Tea is one of her babies she sold on the Black Market she does many things that turn out negatively: at worst she discovers Tea is not indeed her daughter and the events that follow are both tragic and ultimately redeeming
Kseniva Rappoport is transcendently beautiful, immersing herself in this impossibly difficult role without ever losing our empathy.  Both Gerini and Favino as the parents and Dossena as the daughter are consummate actors and the fine cast is supported by cameo roles by such luminaries as Margherita Buy, Nicola Di Pinto and of course Michele Placido as one of the oiliest, most hateful villains ever created for the screen.  The effective cinematography, mixing the past imagery with the present, is the fine work of Fabio Zamarion and the musical score is by the always-fine Ennio Morricone. Giuseppe Tornatore has created a masterpiece of cinematic art.  A revelation.  Grady Harp, August 10",1283040000,4,3041,5.023856858846918
3113085,3,B0013JKXA4,"If there is one thing to say about this movie, it is fast paced, filled with many many different scenes, angles, flashbacks, settings, characters, and lord, never a dull moment.  The filming is quality, the concept with flashbacks is good, some settings are real and the views are generally beautiful.  But there is so much happening here, so much it is impossible to understand given that you are to, own your own, attempt to grasp the story as it unfolds.  I have not seen a film where so much has happened to a character that it becomes unbelievable.

The lengthy Italian film is a dark psychological tormenting drama.  Ugly sex, nudity, brutality in flashbacks, abusive, graphic, violent and bloooody.  It unfolds with furthering complexities and played out too weird.  A child actor plays an important role and it is difficult to watch a child handled abusively while simultaneously, a graphic violent scene from Irena's past plays on.

The focus is a young woman who has been in the sex slave, sadistic industry and gave birth to 9 kids and the kids would be sold on the black market.  She is in search of the latest child and becomes employed as a nanny/housekeeper and on the hunt with false information.  From there everything happens, including fast paced flashbacks, violent episodes.

The DVD cover description is deceptive as it provides a mellow description that is clearly not what is described.  The film is lengthy.  I think I dozed off for 15 to 20 and she was still going through hell when I awoke.

There is an excellent commentary by the director and a Behind the Scenes feature.  Again, if you haven't figured out the storyline, try the commentary, if not, you might need guts to view again or skip the entire movie, because there isn't enough time to try to figure it all out.....Rizzo",1279238400,3,1808,4.75
3113086,5,B0013JKXA4,"What an amazing film.

It reminds me of Patricia Highsmith books: slow-paced and confusing at first, developing little by little into a masterpiece that depicts how twisted and sick mankind can be. Kseniya Rappoport arrives in Trieste to do what it takes to find and get back what's been taken away from her. Some of her acts are questionable, and you will have trouble justifying her or condemning her.

If you liked Giuseppe Tornatore's ""A Pure Formality"", starring Gerard Depardieu & Roman Polanski, you will definitely like this one. While this is a Giuseppe Tornatore movie, ""The Unknown Woman"" has nothing to do with his most famous works ""Malna"", ""Nuovo Cinema Paradiso"" and ""The Star Maker"", which deal with social aspects of culture in Southern Italy, specially Sicily.

Kseniya Rappoport also stars in the excellent Italian thriller ""La Doppia Ora"" (The Double Hour) by Giuseppe Capotondi.

3113087,2,B0013JKXA4,"There is no way to describe this movie without spoilers. It's the story of a woman ********SPOILERS COMING*********

beaten, raped, forced into sexual slavery, prostitution and bearing of children who are sold into adoption. She escapes and searches for one of the children, committing her own heinous crimes against the innocent along the way. It's almost pornographic in its intent, if not in its imagery, which is harsh, but wouldn't get an X-rating these days. These things and worse do happen to women, but to superimpose a twisted story of misplaced revenge is to really do a disservice to victims of such crimes. This is a twisted movie, not the least bit redeemed by sensitivity, imo. I don't care about the writing, cinematography, music, etc. The story is a weird mixture of attempted sensitivity and commercial exploitation. And, it turns on the incredibly unlikely coincidence that the couple whose name her pimp gives her *at random* -- he takes it off a piece of jewelry, it has nothing to do with the sale of her child -- turn out to have an adopted daughter who is the same age within 3 days and who looks like the main character.

beaten, raped, forced into sexual slavery, prostitution and bearing of children who are sold into adoption. She escapes and searches for one of the children, committing her own heinous crimes against the innocent along the way. It's almost pornographic in its intent, if not in its imagery, which is harsh, but wouldn't get an X-rating these days. These things and worse do happen to women, but to superimpose a twisted story of misplaced revenge is to really do a disservice to victims of such crimes. This is a twisted movie, not the least bit redeemed by sensitivity, imo. I don't care about the writing, cinematography, music, etc. The story is a weird mixture of attempted sensitivity and commercial exploitation. And, it turns on the incredibly unlikely coincidence that the couple whose name her pimp gives her *at random* -- he takes it off a piece of jewelry, it has nothing to do with the sale of her child -- turn out to have an adopted daughter who is the same age within 3 days and who looks like the main character. I found the concept distasteful. Just my opinion. Others have liked it.",1275436800,12,1218,4.7725118483412325

There are a lot of nude and sexually explicit scenes so may not be suitable for children, but definetly a movie to watch if you like suspense.",1273363200,3,283,4.854166666666667
8251279,5,B0013JKXA4,"This is a really sad and powerful story, that ultimately brings redemption to the main protagonist. La sconosciuta (The Unknown Woman from 2006), is the story of Irina (Kseniya Rappoport), an Ukranian woman in Italy, that has suffered and experienced untold brutality and violence; torture, rape, sexual degradation, and depravities of the worst kind imaginable, at the hands of one very deranged/psychopathic pimp and sex-trafficker. I do not want to give any of the story away, but suffice it to say that Irina was able to eventually escape her tormentor and abuser, and is trying very hard to start a new life. She is searching for the last child that she gave birth to, but was taken away from her, and sold by the psycho pimp. Unlike the other babies that were stolen from her (there were nine in total!); this one was not the result of being impregnated by a john, but by a local Italian man that she actually loved and was going to run away with, before the deranged pimp, callously murdered him in cold blood.

The character of Irina is a truly powerful and heroic figure. Despite the cruel and inhumane treatment that she received and experienced; she has no real hatred or animosity towards her fellow human beings. Indeed, she is not vindictive at all, but is truly compassionate and caring. She is just desperate to have what should be her natural birthright: joy, happiness, companionship, motherhood, peace and love. Far from being the unknown woman, she embodies and represents the feminine principle of nature: creativity, memory, wisdom, harmony, imagination, motherhood, love and peace, etc.

The cast: Kseniya Rappoport. Michele Placido, Claudia Gerini, Piera Degli Esposti, Alessandro Haber, Clara Dossena, Angela Molina, Margherita Buy, etc.

Giuseppe Tornatore is a filmmaker of the first order! He has given us some of the best heartwarming  and though-provoking films of the last thirty years; such films as: Cinema Paradiso 1988, Stanno tutti benne (Everybodys Fine 1990), Luomo delle stelle (The Star Maker 1995), The Legend of 1900"" 1998, Malna 2000, Baara 2009, The Best Offer"" 2013, etc. And, Kseniya Rappoport is an extraordinarily gifted actor, her eyes and her facial expressions say it all.

I highly recommend it, but be warned, there are scenes of graphic violence that may not be suitable for a younger audience. The DVD picture and sound quality from Medusa Home Entertainment is excellent. PAL format, Italian (English subtitles), extras, FFN, NR 115 mims.

On a side note:

With all the recent allegations, civil lawsuits, and the sensationalism surrounding them, that have suddenly surfaced from Hollywood actresses/actors aimed and launched at their fellow Hollywood directors, producers, and other actors. In the sick, depraved, cut-throat and greedy movie industry that they all heartily belong to, I have one very big and important question for them all; are you people for real? Why didn't these women report these crimes sooner, why now? Who or what's really behind this campaign?

Compared to the real exploitation and inhumanity that is experienced by millions of women throughout the world (and the millions of victims of Washington's wars), just like Irina, who did not willfully and willingly sell their souls and principles to the devil; in return for millions of dollars like the Hollywood prostitutes (AKA actors), you people are the epitome of hypocrites, harlots, and scum!! You have no morals or principles! Because, your agenda does a true injustice to the real victims of rape, prostitution, sex-trafficking, pornography, exploitation, etc., throughout the world, and you all know it, but are afraid to speak out lest you lose your chance to make millions of ""exploitable dollars!!""

Love and Peace,
Carlos Romero",1520380800,,3772,5.160392798690671
