7873831,5,6304481152,I think this is the best relaxation video I've seen. The reviewers below are missing the point. There are more exciting videos- of course but that's not the point of this one. If you are looking for a beautiful well-photographed very relaxing movie this is great. I rented it and watched it over and over and now I am buying it.,1061510400,5,328,4.39344262295082
