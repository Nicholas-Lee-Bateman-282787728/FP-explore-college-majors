3118890,5,B0013RF9VE,"The very first episode from 1983. This special is wonderful. I only saw the second one. It's the first one that I saw. I really enjoy watching The Care Bears a lot I love it. I order this, then it came in from mail and it's in excellent condition. For the 25th Anniversary of this special and the Gold of Heart DVD of the second one, I consider those two as the rarest in my collection.",1343174400,,386,4.092105263157895
3118891,3,B0013RF9VE,"Having grown up with ""The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings"" in it's original format (as TV specials), I was pretty upset when I found out this DVD was the edited version. The Powers That Be edited the special and aired it as an episode of the Care Bears TV series. It wasn't *too* bad of an edit, all they did was take out the original beginning and ending credits. But in all honesty, it just wasn't the same to me. It's really my own personal preference, but if they say something is unedited, then it shouldn't be edited!",1342483200,9,531,4.32

So basically this DVD brought back good memories, it's a hard to find episode that I thought was a movie.  The episode has good morals & generic messages so I definitely think kids should watch it.",1325808000,,453,4.244186046511628

humans to get help from the Care Bears were Donna and Kevin. One of those names is my name too. I liked how the rocks and trees
talked back. This was a fun episode which lead to a whole world of Care Bear shows and movies. This is a piece of Care Bears history

One of the best Care Bear episodes ever. I would recommend this to anyone who loved the movies.",1208476800,9,433,4.7105263157894735

8252718,2,B0013RF9VE,"Disk and packaging came without scratches or blemishes. Unfortunately it's the edited version distributed by Nelvana. No TV series movie or cartoon should be subjected to this kind of editing. It's useless and annoying. Please stop.

I ordered the original series volume 1 from the UK in hopes that the full version is in there. I'll edit this review when I get it.

[UPDATE]
I got the ""Care Bears: Volume 1"" DVD from the UK and it includes the unedited version!",1450137600,7,462,4.691358024691358

8252720,5,B0013RF9VE,"This is one of the best cartoon films I ever saw, I remember seeing it all the time as a kid at daycare, I loved the films and cartoon show of The Care Bears they did of it that was the first original series that started it all. I finally got the whole cartoon series of The Care Bears from the first cartoon show and to the film series that was part of it and the specials that came with it. I now got the complete original series of The Care Bears that was back in the 80s when it first started. I watched it all for the first time in the 90s as a kid and loved it so much. It was a great part of my childhood, I reccomand this kind of animation to anyone who loves good old fashioned animated cartoons, both as a TV show or a film. Your never too old for cartoons as good as this one.",1421712000,2,787,3.834355828220859
