2042803,5,B0001XLWGC,"This is the acclaimed Trevor Nunn 1976 stage production of Macbeth, videotaped for television.  It is minimalist in terms of scenery, props and costume.  There is a mostly black background and the costumes are era-independent.  I think that worked well, serving to concentrate attention on the dialogue where in Shakespeare, it always belongs.  It also served to divorce the action from everyday reality, thus reinforcing the supernatural elements of the plot.

The actors perform as if for a stage production, playing to the back row of a theatre rather than to a camera just in front of them.  This sometimes makes it rather overwrought.

The scene where MacDuff receives news of his family's death is the scene that affected me most when I saw a different stage production but here, MacDuff, played by Bob Peck, receives the news as if he refuses to understand it, and it's played almost to comic effect.  That absolutely did not work for me.  There is no doubting Peck's acting ability.  Indeed, according to Ian McKellen, Peck is the actor he ""learned the most from"".  But I don't think he learned anything from this scene.  I don't know if playing the scene that way was Peck's idea or the director's, but it is the low point of the production.

McKellen and Dench are superb.  And it was good to see John Woodvine as Banquo.  He was a familiar face on British television, usually playing a policeman, but rarely in a part that allowed him to shine, so this performance was something of a revelation.

Recommended, but be prepared for it being a recording of a stage production rather than a true television adaptation.

2042820,1,B0001XLWGC,"my chief complaint is the staging of the play. The costumes are a hodgepodge of styles ranging from Druidic to something they would have proud to wear in Nazi Germany. The costumes worn by MacBeth and Banquo look like they came straight out of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark movie""
  On the plus side I the actors and especially Judy Dench who is superb which of course is a given.
 It is my contention that you cannot remove a play such as MacBeth from its time setting i.e. early 11th century Scotland. It should be kept in mind that the events in the play were almost as removed from the Eliizabethan audience as they are from us.
  Thus, in conclusion to get the full flavor of as they say 'The Scottish play""the directors should stick to the historical period in which it took place",1424217600,,781,4.395833333333333

2042823,2,B0001XLWGC,"As a high school English teacher, I need a good video of the Scottish play. I was not happy with the Roman Polanski DVD that our school library provides, so I tried this one.  I thought that a Royal Shakespeare Co. and Thames network production would be top notch. In some ways, it is. However, I'm unhappy that this DVD does not offer closed captioning. I teach in Texas, and many of my students have a bit of trouble understanding British accents, particularly if the actors talk too fast using unfamiliar words. (This production's Banquo does just that, despite the actor's overall excellent portrayal.) For that reason, I prefer to have closed captioning so that the words are on the screen; it not only helps reinforce Shakespeare's writing but may also help some students keep up.  So the fact this does not offer closed captioning is a big problem. This is  also is a filmed stage play, so the realistic scenery of the castle, battleground, etc., is not there;such background visuals would help students with limited English proficiency better understand what is going on. The production style is minimalist, and there are many close-ups of the actors' faces, but I do not think at-risk high school students will be interested in seeing all those ""talking heads."" Therefore,  I am sorry to say it does not give me what I had wanted. I may use this as the second Macbeth video we watch and pair it with Polanski's or some other movie version which has the period setting. However, I usually use the PBS/Patrick Stewart DVD as the alternative version (this may be heresy to some, but Kate Fleetwood's sleepwalking scene, and Fleetwood's overall performance as Lady Macbeth, I believe, is superior to Judi Dench's) so showing a third version would be overkill.

This to me is the best way to do Shakespeare, or at least it worked for Macbeth and it could work for Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Corialanus, Timon of Athens, Anthony and Cleopatra, Julius Caesar, Troilus and Cressida, Romeo and Juliet, basically all of the tragedies.  For the history plays and obviously the comedies, this atmospheric and stripped bare style wouldn't really work.  But here it most definitely does.

2042845,4,B0001XLWGC,"I was glad I read the bad reviews because, well, it's good to be reminded every once in a while that art is a subjective experience and even great artists do not connect with some people. Nevertheless, I felt the need to speak up for my own experience. IAN MCKELLEN AND JUDI DENCH ARE BRILLIANT. That's it. Ian McKellen is not the first actor I would have chosen for this role but watching his supremely intelligent Macbeth slowly unravel until by 'Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow' there is nothing left but a hollow shell is supremely compelling. Judi Dench is simply devastating and likewise, her fierce mind is front and center. What both McKellen and Dench truly shine at is bringing you along as fantastic and drastic decisions are made and then acted upon. This is an ultimate power couple undone by the arch of their own ambition.

I found Trevor Nunn's lean, stripped down direction exciting and invigorating. It's not about pageant or politics. It's about ordinary people attempting to do something extraordinary and succeeding and failing disastrously. It's about the word as action. The rise and fall of a nation and the transference of power find their source in the word. And the non-period specific costuming and dearth of set gives the story a timeless quality and keeps the focus on the word which Dench and McKellen, in turn, keep active, lively and versatile. If not all the acting matches theirs, so be it. But the story is always clear and engrossing. I love this production.",1354406400,,1498,4.8062015503875966

It was like trying to view a play in a pitch dark room with a flashlight.  I get it that this is a dark story.  I don't need to be constantly reminded of it.  I taught this play to students for many years and understand it very well indeed. This is by far the worst production I have ever seen.  I bought it to introduce my 14 year old to Shakespeare prior to going to a live performance.  What a mistake! Only someone throughly familiar with the play could make heads or tales out of this f...... mess.",1331424000,,645,4.325
2042848,4,B0001XLWGC,"You'll find it at the top of 'Special Features', on which I clicked hoping to find a subtitles app. Although I was disappointed in my search for closed captioning, which would have aided the sometimes muddled soundtrack greatly, I was delighted to discover McKellen's excellent introductory remarks, which explain Trevor Nunn's minimalist approach to Shakespeare's horrific Scottish play, which must have been an exciting stage production when performed at the RSC's ""Other Place"". According to Mr McKellen, the play was performed in the round in a comparatively intimate setting, and he was able to walk the perimeter of the stage during the monologues and eventually look every audience member in the eye, as if he were sharing Macbeth's deepest thoughts and fears. In translating ""Macbeth"" from stage to small screen, Nunn directed McKellen to look the camera in the eye. All the actors, in fact, are viewed from one perspective, that of the camera's eye.

The effect, Mr McKellen explains, was to emphasise Shakespeare's words, and this often-disturbing intimate production succeeds in that aspiration: I found myself listening to the words (without subtitles, one has no choice), and began hearing the playwright's recurrent images, which are otherwise evident only on the printed page, if one is studying the text: the characters name countless creatures of ill omen, e.g., ravens, owls, serpents, crickets, wolves--harbingers of the horrors to come--in the 'half-world' of 'Pale Hecate' (the goddess of witchcraft), where 'Nature seems dead'. The camera's eye, in fact, reflects Shakespeare's contrasting imagery of fire and darkness, viewing the crown and royal robes in the gleaming over-staurated gold of ambition, and viewing the characters, who become slaves or victims of ambition, as bleached almost bone white so that they actually glimmer like ghosts against the overpowering darkness of the tragedy.

Nunn's intentions were, I think, only partially realised, since this production, filmed in the '70s, really does need closed captioning so that the words can be fully appreciated by those who are not familiar with the text, because no matter how closely such viewers listen, they will be only partially successful in understanding every word; and because of the director's economical use of movement, which must have been effective within the closed circle of the actual theatrical space, the production is often visually static.

What works: 1) Judy Dench's Lady Macbeth, played against type, as a woman, whose prayers to the 'murd'ring ministers' to lose all vestiges of womanhood are patently unsuccessful; increasingly she becomes as unhinged as her husband; and finally, as she moves--eyes unseeing--in her sleep with flickering candle through the darkness of the castle, her seemingly endless howl of emotional pain is truly harrowing. 2) The actress playing Lady Macduff, and her son (whom Shakespeare compares to a helpless bird in the nest.). In the face of the pervading evil, they cannot help providing relief for the audience. 3) The Weird Sisters, especially the oldest one, who makes her singularly weird lines (e.g., 'Thrice the brindled cat doth mew!') believable. 4) Macbeth's 'Out, out brief candle' speech, which was especially moving.

What doesn't work [IMO]: 1) The organ music, which made the production seem rather Grand Guignol (and further detracted from the actors' words)  2) The camera, which focuses so closely on the actors that it distorts their faces, sometimes making McKellen--otherwise powerful as Macbeth--seem as though he's 'tearing' his Shakespearean 'passion to tatters'; and I would have preferred that the camera's lens had left the considerable spittle of his rage to my imagination.

I found the DVD of this production at my local library, filed under 'education' rather than 'entertainment'. After viewing it, I would have to concur; it is a performance that every aspiring actor or director should see, but the word 'entertainment', as in 'enjoyment', hardly applies.",1321315200,,4032,5.3920634920634924
2042849,4,B0001XLWGC,"I was looking for a production of Macbeth with clear emphasis on the language of the play and not necessarily cool special effects as Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane, Macbeth sees the ghost of Banquo, the witches do their thing, etc.  This pretty much fit the bill. It is filmed ""on stage"" with a plain black background, although not in front of an audience, so the camera can and does move about to capture different angles, close ups, etc., but there is little relief or highlighting by way of scenery.  Ian McKellan and Dame Judy Densch were terrific in the title roles. It was fascinating to see Macbeth's initial passion for his wife, how she used that to manipulate him, and how his passsion, and their connection, disappeared almost entirely once he seized the crown.  Again, Shakespeare's language came through clearly, as did the motivation of the characters, and there was relatively little scenery chewing (ok, McKellan does froth at the mouth a bit), and only a bit of editing from the generally accepted text. I wasn't nearly as impressed by the supporting cast.  Banquo was so lifeless it was hard to tell he had not been murdered sooner. Duncan's children were spiritless non-entities, I didn't enjoy Roger Rees at all, and the costumery was bizarre, as if the director couldn't quite decide where or when to place the play, or really didn't care that some characters were in turtlenecks (honestly), while some looked like English naval officers sailing to Jutland, others like butlers out of Trollope, and others like possible products of the 17th century. The Porter's scene also seemed oddly done, with the Porter seemingly putting on a show, for no apparent reason, to the camera.  Disconcerting.  That being said, the director made some interesting choices: keeping all of Macbeth's visions ""in his head"" and otherwise unseen; coordinating the witches, turning some of their lines into a type of chant, and eliminating Hecate in favor of dolls or puppets that Macbeth uses as props through the end of the film; emphasizing the christian/pagan contrast (Duncan fairly glows like a saint, wears an enormous cross and at times is absorbed in prayer--the only really ""illuminated"" chracter in a dark production) and the blow to the social and religious order caused by the murder of Duncan.
Overall, and mostly for the clarity of language and the relative simplicity of the production that does not detract from that language, I like this production. I should say that the occasional strong Scottish brogue can be hard to follow (especially contrasted with the clarity of speach of the principals), and like much Shakespeare I can't imagine anyone really enjoying it, or even getting a lot out of it, if they had not read the text. Nor is this the most ""exciting"" version of the play that is destined to rouse the enthusiasm of the uninitiated. Still, it is a solid production with a couple of fine actors who speak the language beautifully.",1315094400,,2956,4.913827655310621
2042850,5,B0001XLWGC,"At first I was a little reserved at this spartan rendition of MacBeth. Minimum costumes, props, and no scenery. The weight of the play rested on the actor's ability to draw you into their world. Some lines reversed, some omitted altogether. Missed the Siward, young and old, characters; thought that old Siward's reference to hurts before was inspiring and that the young Siward's death helped place MacBeth in an invincible state of mind that proved the pinnacle of his hubris. But, the part was a bit of a distraction for the central theme to move forward to its climax, and therefore understandable.
Excellent performances from all. This is the one to watch over and over again.",1311379200,,681,4.879310344827586
2042851,4,B0001XLWGC,"I have a passion for good movie presentations of Shakespeare, and this is my third version of the Scottish Play (alongside the dramatic Playboy/Polanski and the rather odd Aussie modern setting). I like both McKellen and Judi Dench, who in this production are at an earlier stage in their careers, so I grabbed this DVD without having seen it before. I must say, I was surprised that it was entirely on stage, beginning with the small cast sitting in a circle - the sort of thing you might see put on by a small theatrical group. It wasn't even as lavish as Olivier's Henry V, which began with heavily made-up actors against painted backdrops in something like the old ""Globe"" theatre and slowly expanded to live outdoor action. This Macbeth"" had no scenery, almost no props, and no sweeping outdoor vistas or massed troops. In short, it was done as it was written, as a stage play. The entire load was on the shoulders of the cast, and they bore it well, from the smaller roles up to the two leads, McKellen and Dench, who need no praise from me to enhance their reputations! If you're like me, you need two Macbeths - the big Polanski production when you're in the mood for spectacle, and this one when you want to enjoy Shakespeare rendered by two great actors and good support.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Macbeth-McKellen-Dench-Thames-Shakespeare-Collection/dp/B0002TVWYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Macbeth / McKellen, Dench (Thames Shakespeare Collection)</a>",1302566400,,1512,5.304166666666666
2042852,5,B0001XLWGC,"When I first saw this version of 'the scottish play' I was expecting a 'movie' movie. As in, scenery, costumes, and one or two special effects. I was also expecting excellent performances from Judy Dench and Ian McKellan. In the first regard, I was very disapointed; in the second, I was not. The acting is very good from all the actors and excellent from Dench and McKellan. However, there are no costume changes (in fact, very few actual costumes). This is supposed to let the audience pay attention to only the actors, which i think would have work had they all been wearing simple black and white. However, Prince Malcon wore one of those awful seventies knit sweaters, and many of the thanes wore what looked like clothes from the victorian era, which was very distracting. There is no scenery just a lot of smoke on the stage. There are almost no props. Later I learned that this movie is based on a stage production. The minimalist effect is interesting (except for the poor costumes), and indeed I enjoyed the movie but was let down because I didn't expect what I got. So if you're looking for a unique film expierience, watch this, but try another version for a traditional movie.

I ordered the 2011 PBS release with Patrick Stewart (excellent performance) but found it very edgy and extremely bloody which prompted this order of the 1979 version. The opening scene of the 2011 release is noisy, and the wounded character's lines are barely discernable.  I will show the classic version first and show clips from the more modern version.  I want students to hear and appreciate Shakespeare without all the bells, whistles, and shock value add-ons.  Once they have that foundation, then they can compare a classic version to a more modern take on the story.",1299196800,,1003,5.0

I used this version of the play for years when I taught the play at a New England prep school, and am glad to have it again to share with the members of my adult education Shakespeare class here in Arizona.

2042856,5,B0001XLWGC,"The final scene of this production shows the crown of Scotland next to a pair of bloody daggers...essentially, it ends the same way it begins--power being attained by slaughter, which is unfortunately reality in nearly every part of the world.  The story of Macbeth is relevant to all cultures in any point in history; I recommend you watch ""Throne of Blood"" for the translation into a culture that is far different from that of northern Europe, yet which still confronts the same failings of humanity.

This production is sparse.  Every actor wears a simple costume, which is mostly black; the music consists entirely of an organ, which is only occasionally accompanied by a single voice; there are few props, and special effects are completely non-existent; the lighting seems to come from a single overhead lamp; the dialogue, being Shakespeare, can be difficult to penetrate.

Quite simply, this is the exact opposite of everything the modern audience has come to expect from their filmed entertainment over the past sixty years.  We expect flashy costumes, wild special effects, elaborate sets, and glib dialogue.  This production has none of that.

Instead, this version of Macbeth relies solely on the perfect lines written by Shakespeare, and the raw talent of the actors.  For example, take Macbeth's hallucinations at the feast, where he sees the ghost of Banquo.  Instead of an actor portraying the ghost with all of the attendant special effects one would normally expect, we simply have Ian McKellen screaming and covering his shirt with his own saliva as he stares into empty space; he is spitting, foaming at the mouth, and working himself into a murderous rage.  Think on it--one of the greatest of all actors, soaking himself in his own body fluids, while reciting some of the greatest poetry ever created by humanity.  It is utterly disgusting, but so captivating in a way that Saw or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre could never be.

This is Art with a capital ""A.""  Of all the artistic works created by the Human race, Macbeth is possibly the most intense portrayal of pure evil and madness ever produced.  This is definitely the best production of that portrayal I have ever seen.  Hail Shakespeare!",1296864000,,2215,4.980978260869565

2042867,5,B0001XLWGC,"The set is sparse, dark, and perpetually fog-filled. A Caravaggio-inspired lighting scheme picks out the actors' faces from the deep shadow around them. Shakespeare's words, in this context, take on a visionary vividness. This is essentially a filmed version of the legendary stage production put on by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1976.  Despite the absence of many requisite ""cinematic"" elements, it is also by far the most satisfying adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth (not including Kurosawa's 'Throne of Blood') that I've seen. With actors the caliber of Ian McKellen and Judi Dench, lavish sets and props would be an afterthought, even a distraction. Instead, they control the screen with their fierce, combustible passion.

Through his actors, Nunn preys on the audience's imagination. Instead of spoon-feeding us a steady, predictable diet of horror show gore and carnage, Nunn emphasizes the imagistic poetry of Shakespeare's language. The language, channeled through such superior interpreters as McKellen and Dench, takes on an expressionistic life of its own. ""Full of scorpions is my mind,"" Macbeth confesses to his wife. The horror is internal, not external, and Shakespeare's words have a terrifying immediacy that only the imagination can do justice. The barren set is a mindscape, a blank canvas on which the audience paints its own fears.

It's ironic that of all 'Macbeth' versions this is the least explicit, least violent, but is the most difficult to watch. I felt drained by the end. McKellen and Dench give such powerhouse performances the effect is of watching the complete mental disintegration of two people happen before your eyes. Impenetrable shadows surround the characters, literally and figuratively. Nunn strips the play of all extraneous trappings and what is left are the words.

2042871,5,B0001XLWGC,"First off, I just have to say how this particular production of one man's imperial hubris and revealed lust for power is just extraordinarily dynamic to watch during presidential campaign season. Minimalist right down to the film's ending, such things as widely seen and read as Macbeth -- ""...a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing"" -- ought to be well understood throughout most if not all of our worldwide community, one would think, by now?

Two major themes arise while seeing any production of Macbeth: blind ambition and lust for power. But, by the end of this tightly and exquisitely produced production, Act I, scene iv, (about a half-hour or so into this film) just after Macbeth eyes the crown as it is being elevated from the King's head, he anxiously mutters, ""Stars hide your fires, let not light see my deep and black desires..."", you know what the rest of this play will be about but stay rapt with fascination, nonetheless.

Great actors and directors are necessary to pull off Shakespeare, well. The names Trevor Nunn, Ian McKellen, and Judi Dench should pretty well sell this film, outright, along with the several other terrific Shakespearean actors. Add the fact this is a black-box production, which of course relies heavily upon the actors' imaginations, and this is perhaps the most effective rendition of this great play you will ever see. The scene between Macduff and Malcolm's soul-searching/testing the characteristics of a hero versus a villain, is terrific. Ian McKellen's Omega-depiction of Macbeth, throughout the telling, is simply dynamite (especially, how the harrowing dagger soliloquy is shot -- particularly, how he ""moves ... like a ghost""). Judi Dench is simply terrifying as Lady Macbeth. The dvd's special features with Ian McKellen are very good and informative. He discusses some of the realities toward which some of the aforemnetioned actors' performances and the play relate, his different styles, among other interesting tidbits. And, again, this film has a better and more thought-provoking ending than the play, I think, as it was written.

Looking at the events that unravel after encountering the three witches and realizing how he had been bewitched into temptation to ""become King, hereafter"", he would then proceed to talk himself out of what he haphazardly refers to as ""the bloody business"" (committing regicide and treason); then, he gets talked back into reconsidering it, and agrees to go ahead with it after all. Then, ultimately, he has to re-convince himself, outside of the King's chamber (the 'dagger' soliloquy). If he had been able to actually stop and listen to himself, to how he is absolutely not cut out to overcome the potential obstacles that would knowingly arise within his conscience -- for he had always been bound by virtue to King, country, honor, duty, and valiance as a soldier, friend, and general (as well as God-fearing) -- and, thereby never a murderer of these things.

Dench's performance of the famous ""sleepwalking scene"" has got to be the best ever.  Ian McDiarmid (later Star Wars' ""Emperor""), as Ross and as The Porter, was a fun surprise and excellent in both of those small parts.  Seeing all these wonderful actors when they were younger was fun.  And the minimalist sets and dark, dramatic lighting worked for me.

A few criticisms:
-- McKellan and Dench had no sexual chemistry, which made their attempts to kiss and nuzzle (in some scenes) just annoying.  The director should have told them not to bother.
-- The actor who played Macduff was unconvincing.
-- No subtitle option.  As with all Shakespeare, language is an issue and I had to refer to a written _Macbeth_ often.  Subtitles would have been so helpful.

2042874,4,B0001XLWGC,"I love Shakespeare and I collect DVDs with adaptations of his plays for TV or Cinema. Macbeth is one of my favorite plays but, with the exception of the amazing THRONE OF BLOOD, of Kurosawa, not quite Macbeth but an adaptation of the genial Japanese director of the immortal play, the adaptations of Welles and Polanski are not just quite the thing! Don't think I am too exigent, because I loved Branagh's Hamlet, and the Othello with Laurence Fishburne, but I have a thing with Shakespeare and it is the TEXT!!! A good shakesperian adaptation cannot mutilate the words and condense the scenes for the sake of making the story more easily filmed. That was what I loved in Branagh's Hamlet, he did not omit one single word from the original text. And this Splendid adaptation of Macbeth keeps the text intact! OK, the format is like a stage-play, not many visual effects but the text is COMPLETE. Regretfully, NO SUBTITLES OR CLOSED-CAPTIONS!!! Shakespeare IS complex and the plot is very subtle , the actors for the sake of the acting cannot speak slowly, of course, so I did the best I could, I opened my book of Shakespearean plays and listened the movie reading the lines in the book!!! Only then I could be astounded and marvelled by the very best performance of Macbeth that i HAVE ever seen. Judy Dench is THE BEST LADY MACBETH I have ever seen, is chilling her rendering of the ambitious lady that became queen after stimulating her husband to murder the former king and gets mad in the process. Ian McKellen begins as a vacillant thane that desires the throne but in the end his cruelty makes even his wife shudder! Reading the play and watching the performances was a extremely satisfying experience because I never had perceived the nuances of the relationship between Macbeth and his wife, how ambitious she was, and how she was instrumental for his first crime. And it is a crime that this extraordinary play has NO Subtitles. A crime against the average spectator that is not fluent enough in the English language, especially 16th century English! I reccomend this adaptation to everybody, but have your Macbeth play written nearby for reading while you are watching the movie. Even with the extra work, is worthwhile. I have never seen  a best MACBETH performance, and I have seen all the MACBETH versions that have been filmed !

2042883,5,B0001XLWGC,"Trevor Nunn's 1979 Thames Television production of ""Macbeth,"" directed by Philip Casson, is a dark, stripped-down, claustrophobic version that emphasizes the furnace-fire terror of Shakespeare's play. As star Ian McKellen tells us in an introduction and reminiscence included in the DVD's special features, the broadcast documents a production of the play that had been running, with the same cast, for the previous three years in Stratford and London. The cast had become a family by then, he tells us, and its members were so in tune with each other that the film took less than a week to shoot, rather than the usual several weeks. The sheer fluidity of the performances attests to the teamwork the cast members had achieved. The camera, shooting mostly in close-up, offers the actors nowhere to hide; they must give us the whole, unvarnished truth of the story with their faces and voices, and that they do. McKellen makes a brilliantly Stalinesque Macbeth, spiraling unforgettably into murder, paranoia, and nihilism. Judi Dench is, if anything, even better than McKellen; the extended, ripped-flesh scream she rips from herself during Lady Macbeth's final soliloquy seems to emanate from the Ninth Circle of Hell. Also notable are Roger Rees as Malcolm, John Woodvine as Banquo, and Ian McDiarmid as Ross. Not all of the performances, alas, are on this level. Although McKellen pays loving tribute to the late Bob Peck in his reminiscence, I found Peck's performance as Macduff inexplicable at times. (When a man hears that his wife and children have been murdered, don't you think his reaction would be a little less, well, CLINICAL?) Nevertheless, this has to be counted as a Shakespearian performance of historic importance, with the two greatest Shakespearian actors of the late 20th century giving us their definitive versions of Lord and Lady Macbeth.

2042885,1,B0001XLWGC,"There are several murders in this RSC production, the most notable of which is that of Shakespeare, brutally slaughtered by dreadful acting and worse direction. The other murders are those of some of the greatest monologues in all of Shakespeare, tortured to death in this appalling version.

The two main culprits are Ian McKellen as Macbeth, and director Trevor Nunn. McKellen's acting is so inept it is simply unbearable. He does not act his monologues, he recites them, badly at that, and conveys as much emotion as one might when ordering Chinese food over the telephone. When informed that ""The Queen, my lord, is dead,"" he has no emotional response whatever - not even so much as a quiet pause or reflection - and immediately, without any trace of emotion, responds with the line ""She should have died hereafter"" as though saying ""She should have worn the blue dress.""

This is of course followed by the famous ""Tomorrow"" monologue, which here conveys as much tragedy as someone singing ""Tomorrow"" from the musical ""Annie."" Nunn's hopeless direction features dreadful timing, total lack of line reading direction, and weak physical staging. All of this is exacerbated by terrible and pretentious camera choices, which feature huge full screen talking heads, and monologues delivered by having the player turn directly to the camera and deliver a full frontal face speech directly to the audience.

Nunn directs a preposterous drunken porter scene, entirely devoid of humor, and then turns this scene, which Shakespeare intended as relief to precede and prepare for the murder of Duncan, into a serious scene, which defeats its purpose.

Bob Peck as Macduff is pathetic and simply laughable, and in fact this reviewer actually burst out laughing at one point: following Duncan's murder, when Malcolm enters in apprehension, wondering what has happened, Peck, as Macduff, informs him in the most bland and matter-of-fact voice and manner that, ""Your royal father's murdered,"" exactly as though he were telling Malcolm, ""You won't be able to play golf today - it's raining."" Peck greets the news that his wife and children have been slaughtered, with ""Oh, really?""

Malcolm is played by Roger Rees, and Rees provides one of the few bright spots here, a compelling performance, that fully conveys the tragedy of a young man whose father has been murdered, and is himself suspected of the deed. The rest of the supporting cast is comprised of fine actors who turn in excellent performances that unfortunately, because of their subsidiary importance, cannot overcome the abysmal acting and direction by McKellen and Nunn.

Although she doesn't look or fit the part, Judi Dench delivers a reasonable performance as Lady Macbeth, but most of her scenes are naturally and regrettably played against McKellen, whose acting drags down Dench's, and of course she was compelled to submit to Nunn's horrible direction and staging.

The lack of sets, which was the way this was presented in Shakespeare's day, does not work on film, (in this case videotape) as it lacks the immediacy of a live performance, which can compensate for the lack of sets. This was yet another disappointing attempt at Macbeth on film. There has never been a fully satisfying version. The best available is the Maurice Evans/Judith Anderson version made for the Hallmark Hall of Fame in 1954.",1167609600,,3361,5.088929219600726
2042886,5,B0001XLWGC,"I have read about this film in John Miller's book on Judi Dench where she had given some interesting insight into the making of Macbeth. The Royal Shakespeare Company had successfully performed this play for several years prior to it being filmed for television. There is absolutely no difference in what was performed on stage to what you see in the film version of Macbeth. The stripped down bareness of prop use was director Trevor Nunn's idea, which the whole cast originally questioned. However, the sparsness is what gives the play it's impact because the attention is fully on the characters. Judi Dench had said that their performance of Macbeth put such a dark and eery feeling over the cast and audience while it was being played that a local priest used to come to every performance and hold out a crucifix to protect the cast and audience from any evil spirits! Needless to say this an awesomely powerful stage production of Macbeth. There is no doubt in my mind as to why Ian McKellen, Dame Judi Dench, and Trevor Nunn all won awards for their work on Macbeth.",1164931200,,1073,4.682539682539683
2042887,1,B0001XLWGC,"Would that the bard himself had directed.  Ian contorts and convolutes.  Judi despises and denies.  The whole stage to television adaptation loses the gripping starkness of the theatrical intent.  Brits being Brits bringing the bard to the modern masses. How more cliche can it get?  In 1976 this may have seemed the definitive version, and lord knows it made McKellen and Dench, but I still hold out hope against hope that an actor and actress will come forth and give this play the truly powerful pitch it deserves for the pallette of film.",1157846400,,542,4.78494623655914
2042888,4,B0001XLWGC,"Live on stage, Trevor Nunn's production was extroardinary, one of the best theatre performances I have ever seen.  The video doesn't totally capture that power; it may have been wise, for a television director, to de-emphasize the stage set (a black magic circle outlined on a wood floor, surrounded by wooden crates), and such brilliant theatrical images as the invading thanes, surrounding Macbeth in a circle, as he slumps on the crate throne of his ramshackle bunker; but those features are part of what made the stage version unforgettable.  However, the video does preserve the wonderful performances.  I must dissent from some of the reviews below: Dench is a superb Lady Macbeth and the late Bob Peck's understated Macduff works beautifully; both deliver their big scenes as well as any production you will ever see.  And for McKellen, this was a signature role of his career.  The video also conveys the low-key intensity and furious pace of this MACBETH; it's a rare opportunity to see one of the great Shakespearean productions of the century, preserved.",1152576000,,1065,5.062857142857143

2042890,5,B0001XLWGC,"This production is decades old, but will continue to be a classic.  The settings are spare, the costumes are minimalist and stark.  The acting is truly scarey.  Ian McKellan tends to be a bit twitchy for my taste as an actor, but here the twitchiness works very well.  Spitting, fuming, puking even at one point, he wrestles with a terrible evil he has hatched inside himself.  I imagine it would have been hard to sit through in the theatre with no intermission.

Judi Dench - a goddess to me - is alternately terrifying and heartbreaking as Lady MacBeth.  Her sleepwalking scene has a desperate, lost quality to it, and the scene climaxes in a bottomless cry from her heavy heart which gives me goosebumps just to think of it.

A young Roger Rees (just off his stint as Nicholas Nickleby - does anyone here but me remember that one, or am I dating myself?) plays Malcolm, perhaps bringing some inadvertent comedy to the production. Malcolm's scene where he comdemns himself for his lust and then admits that he's a virgin.  To me, it's a hoot, but maybe I was just letting off tension steam from the rest of the play.

The witches are creepy, too.  Now I know why they call them ""weird"" sisters.  Really weird, with even more drool and twitching.

All in all, I think this is the best MacBeth that you'll find on tape.  It's just a matter of whether or not you can sit through it without jumping out of your skin.  Highly recommended.  A classic.",1144800000,,1448,4.5115384615384615
2042891,5,B0001XLWGC,"I was lucky enough to see this production of the Scottish play in the theatre, and it retains its place as one of the most thrilling evenings at the theatre in my life! Both Ian McKellen and Judi Dench gave extraordinary performances of great power and beauty. Though no dvd or film or video can match the live experience this dvd comes very close to doing so. Filmed in close up a lot of the time the viewer is right there in the middle of the action, the plotting, the murders, and the excitement. The poetry of Shakespeare's language cannot be bettered, nor better delivered, with all the actors speaking their lines as if they had just thought of them. If you like great theatre and acting this is one your collection cannot be without.",1143763200,,740,4.488888888888889
2042892,5,B0001XLWGC,"Let me start by telling you what I don't like about this production. The costuming is annoying - a mixture of styles for no reason that is clear to me and to no particular effect. And that's it. Everything else about this production works beautifully.

Ian McKellan and Judy Dench are absolutely magnificent. Their slide into evil is absolutely convincing, the anguish it causes them is completely natural. All the ambition and cruelty that we expect are there, mingled with a tenderness and regret that are often missed by lesser actors. The supporting cast is all good, though not uniformly so; some are excellent, some merely good.

The witches are creepy in a repellant rather than a scary way. The supernatural elements of the play aren't played out with special effects, but rather take place in the minds of the characters. I think that works well - hags over cauldrons and gauze wearing ghosts get pretty cliched. Here the boundary between supernatural and madness is left completely blurred.

I expected the set design to be a negative - I'm not fond of dark and mostly empty sets. At first it bothered me, but later I found that I was focusing entirely on the actors and completely failing to notice the absence of detailed background. The darkness fits the mood of the play and makes everything that is there on stage stand out. The sets may be initially off-putting, but I think they're a wise and artistically sound approach.

In spite of the senseless costume design, this is a solid five.",1142985600,,1503,4.769230769230769
2042893,5,B0001XLWGC,"This is the legendary 1976 Royal Shakespeare Company production that caused such a stir when it hit the stage back then.  The stars were the young Ian McKellen as Macbeth and Judi Dench as Lady Macbeth.  Also in the excellent cast of this television version are Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine from ""Star Wars"" as Ross and an especially creepy Porter), Roger Rees, and Marie Kean.  Trevor Nunn directed the stage version and designed the television one.  There's not a hint of sunlight to be had, befitting one of Shakespeare's darkest plays.

What struck me is how much McKellan, clad in black leather and with slicked-back hair, resembles Bob Geldof in the fascist dictator scenes from the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pink-Floyd-The-Wall-25th-Anniversary-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B0006ZE7G2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pink Floyd - The Wall 25th Anniversary (Deluxe Edition)</a>&nbsp;It makes me wonder if Alan Parker, the director of that film, modeled Geldof's appearance on McKellen's here.  McKellen is really something to see; his Macbeth is a quivering mass of ambition, terror, and guilt.  When he says his ""mind is full of scorpions"" you really believe it.  And Dench matches him all the way.  Her final shriek of anguish and shame is something you will never forget.  The Weird Sisters are really horrific; these witches could live in your nightmares for a while.  This production is not as nihilistic as some other recent stagings; goodness does exist, although it is under constant siege by madness and evil.  This is a bone-chilling vision of Shakespeare: it would be kind of presumptuous to declare it the definitive version of the play, but it certainly comes close.  I can't imagine a better one.",1140048000,,1751,5.51310861423221
2042894,2,B0001XLWGC,"The casting for this production could scarcely be better (of particular note is the harrowing performance of Judi Dench) and it's one of Shakespeare's best plays. That said, this film of a production on stage doesn't quite carry the viewer's interest for the entire play. There are times when the actors seem downright pretentious; you feel as if they're tellings us, ""We know how deep this is so appreciate it, please."" That's too bad since ""Macbeth"" is a work thriving with intense imagination with a few hallucinations thrown in so it should invite a great film. Sadly, this relatively slow-moving production isn't it. There are, of course, wonderful moments with Mackellan and particularly Dench (no one plays the scene where Lady Macbeth goes crazy better than Dame Judi). I just don't know if that alone makes this a worthwhile purchase. For my money, Kurosawa's ""Throne of Blood"" is a far better choice.",1140048000,,910,4.993421052631579
2042895,5,B0001XLWGC,"I mean it; this is not only the best filmed Shakespeare adaptation I have ever seen (and I've seen a LOT of them) but a wonderful film.  McKellen and Dench are, well, McKellen and Dench, and even the supporting cast is outstanding, with a particularly good performance by the fellow in the role of Malcolm.  The minimalist, unobtrusive costumes and set are functional without distracting and allow the viewer to pay attention to the acting.",1109548800,,440,4.8533333333333335
2042896,5,B0001XLWGC,"If you require elaborate scenery, costumes, or special affects to appreciate Shakespeare, then this production is not for you. If all that you require is outstanding acting to bring Shakespeare to life, then you'll likely enjoy this production. The performances of Ian McKellen and Judi Dench are outstanding. Judi Dench's depiction of Lady Macbeth's descent into madness is riveting.

Acting aside, the great thing about this production, is that it presents Macbeth in much the same way as it would have been seen by William Shakespeare. Some comment on the stripped down nature of this production, without appreciating that in the original productions there was virtually no set and little in the way of costumes. Oh, and no women. Far from being an esoteric adaptation of Macbeth, this version is much closer to what theatre goers would have witnessed in Elizabethan times.",1103328000,,876,5.169014084507042
2042897,3,B0001XLWGC,"This production has many virtues, chief among them the wonderful performances of McKellen and Dench, especially in the latter parts of the play. The ""Tomorrow"" speech and Lady Macbeth's final scenes are especially effective. But I found the perpetually dark stage, largely hokey lighting and incoherent costuming very distracting (what century are we in? 11th, 17th 19th or 20th? No clue here-- oh wait! stupid me! that's the point---how SOOO clever!!). The Spartan sets might have worked better on a real stage but as a film they are a disaster. I think I would as soon put up with a banner at the bottom that pops up now and then with the line ""Warning folks. The Macbeths are not nice people, in case you don't get it. This play is about some really DARK doings."" I also found using the same actor for both a murderer and the doctor very annoying (Ian McDiarmid, the Emperor in Star Wars, works better as both the Porter and Ross). Despite getting to share Macbeth's pain in ways we could probably do without, this film is still worth it for the generally fine performances (Macduff excepted), especially McKellen and Dench. I agree with those who suggest this might be much better as audio only. Worth seeing for the diehard Macbeth fan. Look elsewhere for an introduction to this play.",1100304000,,1290,4.737777777777778
2042898,4,B0001XLWGC,"This version of Macbeth, which is a triumph I must add, made me very pleased to watch it.  And although there is no real set, but a circle surrounded by rocks, this film was very emotional.  It does not use much gore in it to show that it is a horror film.  This version of Macbeth shows Ian McKellen, the man who portrayed Gandalkf in The Lord of The Rings, at his best in this shakespearian work.  It does not even show Macbeth's head at the end, yet this work has all of the wit, horror, and cleverness to be declared a shakespearian treasure.",1075593600,,546,4.221153846153846
2042899,5,B0001XLWGC,"Without question, this version of Macbeth featuring two of the finest actors to speak dialogue is one of the most compelling, chillingly stark renderings of the bard's bloody drama ever captured on film. An actual staged production, the Trevor Nunn film posits the Macbeth world in a land of black shadows broken occasionally by the luminescent faces of the poor souls who populate that world. The characters come from darkness and they return there. In envisioning the play this way, Nunn emphasizes the sad vulnerability of human beings who must act out their little roles only to vanish in the great swallowing mystery of time and eternity.
Ian McKellen's Macbeth is one of those tortured souls: a real human being riddled with arrogance and aspirations but at the same time tormented by morality and fear. McKellen's performance is not of a monster but of a human being teetering on the brink of good and evil. Once he loses his delicate balance, McKellen's Macbeth becomes cold and statuary, a soul realizing its own destruction, its own sinking into the great gulf of blood it has spilled. McKellen manages to capture Shakespeare's vision of a Macbeth who is always self-aware, always conscious of his own evil and its consequences.
Judi Dench's Lady Macbeth makes a similar transformation, except in her journey, she moves from cold, malevolent she-devil to sadly broken, guilt-ridden madwoman. Dench's performance is the show's dramatic star, its center, its barometer for guilt and its exacting consequences. The sleep walking scene is one of the finest depictions of guilt and human culpability one is likely ever to see performed and reason enough to award this production five stars.
Both McKellen and Dench humanize their characters, never letting them slip into the extremes of monsterdom. Both Macbeth and Lady Macbeth appear here as our brother and sister: equipped with minds and souls capable of knowing good but also capable of choosing evil, or perhaps capable of letting evil choose them. Their relentless self-awareness is the one quality of Shakespeare's play that makes it so chilling: great figures losing their better selves and having their eyes open during the loss. To commit evil and know it--such is the awful plight of these hapless souls--and Nunn's production, buoyed by remarkable performances, renders that plight disturbingly our own.",1058745600,,2371,5.177083333333333
2042900,4,B0001XLWGC,"I purchased this tape after it was featured in an interview with Ian  McKellen on Inside the Actor?s Studio and I decided I had to have it for my collection. This is a very simply staged version of Shakespeare's most violent play, and against this basic black canvas you witness two of the greatest stage actors of all time.  The queen knighted both McKellen and Dench after this production, and rightfully so.  They are both national treasures, as they should be.
This film is worth watching for these two outstanding performances alone, and for the beauty of the language, unencumbered by complex technical effects.  Trevor Nunn has chosen to highlight the emotional deterioration of MacBeth and his Lady for this production, and I wonder if that choice was made because he had these two incredible actors for this production, or if he chose them for this purpose (a variation on the chicken/egg theory of theatrical production).
The ""apparitions"" (Banquo, dagger, et al) occur in MacBeth's head only -- McKellen's amazing ability convinces you that he sees bloody, murdered Banquo seated at the table, although we do not see him. (Believe me, this is infinitely preferable to some other Banquo apparitions I've witnessed in other productions.)  Dench is, quite simply, the best actor alive to ever trod down the even road of the Bard?s blank verse. Period.  Her Lady MacBeth?s degeneration is set in motion from the first letter-reading scene, climaxing in the most jaw-dropping sleepwalking scene ever.
Shakespeare has never SOUNDED better?much of this recording would work equally well as an audio-only version.
Other reviewers have done a remarkable job in explaining what works about this notable production; allow me to share what bothered me about it:
The camera work:  looked and felt like an old episode of Dark Shadows with much-too-tight camera angles.  I wish that, C-Span-like, the TV director had simply trained a camera on the stage and then we could watch how Nunn utilized the small space of this theatre.  So many tight shots of the actors? faces deprive us of seeing what they are doing with the rest of themselves, and how the others in the scene are reacting.
Bob Peck as MacDuff: autistic, rather than artistic.  I know the British are famous for their reserve (but the Scots certainly aren?t), and sometimes less is more onstage when it comes to emotion, but Peck?s greets the news that his wife and children have all been murdered with the same amount of indignation that he might incur at the news that someone drank the last beer in his fridge.  It?s a choice that doesn?t seem to work, and this goes against Shakespeare?s own text:  (?But  I must also feel it as a man?), which makes MacDuff one of the first completely emotional strong, sensitive males on the stage.  Even when he murders MacBeth, Peck comes across as only slightly peeved.
Accents: Nunn has chosen to have some of the ?character? parts (the Sergeant, the Porter) performed with heavy Scottish brogues?and they are difficult to understand for the average listener. (I?m quite used to these accents and I had a hard time with some of it.)  I like the authenticity, but sometimes one should sacrifice authenticity for coherence.
If you like Shakespeare, good acting, or need to learn this play for school, buy this version.  It comes closer than most others toward depicting what the main characters are all about, and the language is beautiful and terrifying.  If you are studying acting, McKellen and Dench?s performances will probably convince you that you have no talent whatsoever.",1041120000,,3581,4.961538461538462
2042901,5,B0001XLWGC,"Staged for a very small theater in 1976, director Trevor Nunn gives us an exceptionally bleak production in shades of black, grey, sepia, and the occasional red of spilled blood...with no sets and minimal props, and lots and lots of mist. The costuming is pared down to a simple ""non-descript"" look, and overall, it's very effective.
With a fine cast of Royal Shakespeare Company members backing them, Sir Ian and Dame Judi shine brilliantly as the devilish couple. McKellan looks handsome and his disintegration is mesmerizing...his big scene with the witches is fabulous (and terrific witches they are ! Susan Dury, Judith Harte, Marie Kean). Dench is phenomenal! I love the inhuman wail she lets out in the sleepwalking scene. It's chilling, and unforgettable.
There are so many intriguing Macbeth productions available, like the Orson Welles film, and the visually entertaining Polanski/Jon Finch version, but this ""bare bones"" one is my favorite, where the play's the thing.",1018569600,,979,5.24203821656051
2042902,2,B0001XLWGC,"I didn't like the idea that there were no props. No stage sets. No real lighting effects to speak of. No good costume work. This movie reading of Macbeth takes place in a dark room, where the actors say their lines to each other, and sometimes, just by themselves.
That's all fine and good if you already intimately know this play. But even though I have read it countless times, I couldn't even sit through this entire production. I was very disappointed in it, especially after seeing who the actors were. Part of the magick in performing a play onstage is the use of props, lighting, interaction, costuming, etc., to engage the audiences imagination.
This seemed to be to be a read aloud, book-on-tape style production. Yes, the recitation of the lines was well-done. But there was nothing else to compel me to finish it. I can read it myself.",1008720000,,846,4.6466666666666665
2042912,2,B0001XLWGC,"I think that Ian McKellen and Judy Dench are two of the greatest people working in the film today. McKellen turned in a rather Shakespeare-esque performance as Magneto in X-MEN, and Dench has proved herself as a good M in thel last three JAMES BOND epics. So I was surprised that this film turned out to be a waste of time. Trying to capture the Bard's stage vision, Trevor Nunn screws up everything with this lumbering two-hour-and-sixteen-minute film. There are no sets, just blackness, making the dark tragedy TOO dark. The costumes are no good whatsoever. The acting is just plain terrible! The only saving grace in this film is Roger Rees. Please miss this peace of crap not worth seeing. Either watch Roman Polanski's version, or wait for Kenneth Branagh's version to come out. They're better than this is, I'm sure.

2042914,5,B0001XLWGC,"Shakespeare's plays, I find, often tend not to come off too well on screen. The essence of these works is the language: it is Shakespeare's blank verse that contains the drama. But all too often, this gets lost on the screen. However, this much acclaimed Royal Shakespeare Company production, directed by Trevor Nunn, gets it absolutely right. The sets are minimal; the lighting is imaginative, but dark; the camera movements and editing are unobtrusive: nothing distracts from the verse, which - needless to say, given this cast - is beautifully spoken. The costumes are taken from different periods in history, and so do not tie the action down to any particular time; but there is a unity both in design and in purpose.
The atmosphere is intense and claustrophobic from the very beginning. Judi Dench presents a Lady Macbeth who, right from the start, is terrified of the spirits she calls upon to possess her. Ian MacKellen presents us with a figure on the verge of insanity, and possibly beyond: this Macbeth has to convince himself that ""all is but toys"", for otherwise, he could not go on living with the burden of such guilt. It is terrifying to see these figures descend further into the depths of evil and madness. Somehow, all horror films seem a bit tame after this: the evil does not come from the monster outside, but from the monster within ourselves.
In brief, this is not prettified Shakespeare. If you are looking for spectacle and opulence, it would be best to look elsewhere. But if you are looking for an intelligent reading of one of the great undisputed masterpieces of drama, then you need look no further.",979344000,,1630,4.783687943262412
2042915,3,B0001XLWGC,"In this minimalist set probably not.  Trevor Nunn's adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth features a fantastic (young) cast led by Ian McKellan, and concentrates more on the psychological instead of the physical.  With a nearly bare stage and missing characters (Ghost of Banquo), the audience must rely on the acting to understand what is happening within the play.
