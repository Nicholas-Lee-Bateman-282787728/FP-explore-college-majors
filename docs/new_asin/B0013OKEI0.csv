8326079,1,B0013OKEI0,"The DVD is almost entirely narrated in English with little Chinese. The few Chinese learning spots are poorly presented in a stiff ""first here's the English phrase, next here's the Chinese phrase"" format that children do not absorb well. It would have been better if the DVD used Chinese narration as the base, interspersed with some English explanations of certain key words and phrases. As Mei Mei is a native Chinese speaker, this wouldn't have been very difficult to do. Also, some learning spots with the children in the village speaking to the camera would have been nice. As is, the DVD isn't much more than a day in the life of Chinese school children in English.",1388793600,,671,4.743589743589744
8326080,5,B0013OKEI0,"I highly recommend this DVD.  Both my daughter and I enjoy it a lot.  Great for learning Mandarin Chinese phrases and sentences, and also entertaining and educational.  It teaches you, and it is fun, too.",1258156800,,204,4.771428571428571
8326081,5,B0013OKEI0,"Seeing the actual life of an older child in a modern Chinese village is entertaining as well as educational.  The Chinese Phrases learned in this video add to an already developed appreciation for the Chinese language.  The fact that the phrases are repeated separately, by both Mei Mei and a child allows for time to hear the words in a variety of voices and the ability to pause the video to read the Mandarin words.",1231200000,2,418,4.56
