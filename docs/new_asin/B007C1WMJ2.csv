8514143,2,B007C1WMJ2,"I just finished reading ""Boys in the Boat"" which details the 1936 gold medal victory of the University of Washington 8 oar crew team. The book specifically mentions certain scenes that were filmed by Leni Riefenstahl for her Olympia movie which I was eager to see.  However, that particular sport is not here!  This DVD only shows discus, 100 meters, long jump, javelin, pole vault and marathon. What happened to the rest of the sports?!",1425945600,11,437,4.8133333333333335
8514144,4,B007C1WMJ2,"This is an interesting film to see - to help understand a little what was going on in Germany prior to WWII. Not entertaining like The First Olympics, but nonetheless informative.",1420243200,,179,4.806451612903226
8514145,4,B007C1WMJ2,"Great film, but am giving it 4 stars because it really could have done without the atypical anti-Nazi propaganda in the synopsis, particularly the myth of Hitler supposed disdain toward Jesse Owens, an American Olympic gold medalist.

Noted in his biography ""Triumph"": Owens said, ""Hitler didn't snub me  it was FDR who snubbed me. The president didn't even send me a telegram."" On the other hand, Hitler sent Owens a commemorative inscribed cabinet photograph of himself. Jesse Owens was never invited to the White House nor were honors bestowed upon him by President Franklin D. Roosevelt",1413244800,20,590,5.135416666666667
8514146,4,B007C1WMJ2,"OLYMPIA was split into two parts for its German release, but amalgamated into one elsewhere.  I saw the amalgamated version, in which the principal focus of attention centered on the athletics.  Riefenstahl's photography is quite outstanding; her sense of camera placement impeccable; her ability to define the individual in relationship to environment cannot be questioned.  As a study in the human body and its potential, OLYMPIA cannot be faulted.  However there is perhaps less to OLYMPIA than meets the eye: viewers looking to the film as a source of Nazi propaganda are likely to be disappointed.  True, there are shots of Adolf Hitler clapping approvingly at German athletes winning gold medals; and shots of the swastika being raised during various ceremonies; but the film in this version adopts an even-handed approach to its material.  The only suggestion of politics comes when the British and American athletes refuse to adopt the Nazi salute, both during the opening ceremony and during medal ceremonies; rather they salute as they might have done if they were acknowledging superior officers in the Army.  As a record of a unique event, OLYMPIA cannot be faulted, but perhaps it should be treated first and foremost as a sports documentary rather than a piece of political propaganda.",1389398400,6,1299,5.186602870813397
8514147,5,B007C1WMJ2,"Part I
The film opens up with a film tribute to the history of Greece and the games. We get to see the names of the nations at the time that the torch passes through as it reached Berlin. A much more realistic torch than today's is ran into the stadium with a few pauses to let everyone see just before the final dash to the Olympic torch at the stadium. It would be great to recapture this in the present day. Some of the tribute leads me to believe that our athletes are overly clothed for the sports.

Part II
By now watching Part I, ""Festival of the nation"" spoiled you. Again this film starts out with the ideal and surrounded by Leni's signature clouds. List is leading you to ""field hockey, soccer bicycling, equestrian, aquatic and gymnastic events. Highlights are the Pentathlon and the Decathlon."" Remember that some countries were still using horses in the military.

It may be unique reasons that brought you to this point such as Leni or photography, or interest in history, or, or, or. But once the action starts you feel that you are there and get lost in the ""who will win what and how."" Even being aware of the outcome does not prepare you to ""not bite your nails"" as you watch each athlete barley besting the next until it is over too soon. I noticed that instead of placing medals over the winners, they used laurel wreaths.
Any way you cut it, this movie is worth watching.",1370131200,,1393,4.416342412451362
