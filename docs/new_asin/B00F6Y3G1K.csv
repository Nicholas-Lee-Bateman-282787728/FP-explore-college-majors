8612763,5,B00F6Y3G1K,"A really nice early action film featuring Douglas Fairbanks Jr in his prime, with very blond Betty Davis. The rest of the story can be found at the IMDB site. The DVD copy and the sound are very good for a1933 film. The early flying shots are really fun, interesting to think that they were flimed 81 years ago!",1395014400,5,311,4.288135593220339
8612764,4,B00F6Y3G1K,"Booze, Narcotics, Bette Davis and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. What more can a person ask for? Joan Crawford perhaps? Nope, sorry Joan is not in this movie but how fun to have her ex husband and the woman who hated her more in the same movie? Bette Davis in an earlier role meets Douglas in Central Park strikes up a conversation and falls in love. Douglas plays a pilot out of work and with some determination lands himself a flying gig that only gets him in deep water with the border patrol. A fun story for Bette Davis Fans and a fun movie to ad to ones collection.",1392940800,3,562,4.261682242990654
8612765,4,B00F6Y3G1K,"Contains spoilers!  Two Marine Corps pilots from the Nicaragua campaign find themselves on the streets of New York looking for work after their promised civilian jobs disappear during the Depression.  They take on a steno gal also between jobs as they make the best of it.  While visiting a flying field exhibition, Fairbanks wrangles a job making a wing walk and parachute jump for the audience.  After eavesdropping on a conversation, he uses the money to outfit himself as a chauffeur for a young rich dame that has more service in mind than he expects. She turns out to be the moll of a smuggler, but after a confrontation with the boyfriend, he's hired as his bodyguard.  Eventually, he and his buddy are recruited to smuggle Prohibition alcohol, and unbeknownst to them dope, from Canada by air.  They shoot down two Border Patrol planes on the way back, having been told they might be hijacked by rivals.  Davis independently gets hired as a secretary by the same smuggler, and there's a misunderstanding between the couple over motives. Eventually, Fairbanks gets in too deep when he's involved with two troublesome business partners getting bumped off in a club.  The heat gets too great, and the smuggler arranges to split town with his cache of dope, convincing the two buddies to make one last flying job.  Fairbanks figures it all out in the final act, and with the smuggler holding him at gunpoint, is able to turn the tables and save his buddy who has been set up to take the fall in another plane.  They are all reunited in the end, poor but wiser.  As his friend joins back up with the Marine Corps for security, Fairbanks finally makes his commitment to Davis and a civilian life.

There is a decent amount of flying footage for aviation enthusiasts of contemporary era stick and wood biplanes and cabin monoplanes.",1389830400,5,1833,4.747634069400631
8612766,4,B00F6Y3G1K,"Not a bad film really, I enjoyed it and would recommend if you want some fast-paced pre-code 1930s fun!

I only really bought this film because of Bette Davis (who loathed the film) her Alabama accent is dodgy & not convincing but she looks fantastic. I love slinky blonde pre-code Bette Davis and would definitely recommend if you are a fan and want to see her early work.

I hope Warner Archives release ""The Cabin in the Cotton"" soon!",1382486400,11,437,4.518987341772152
