8614042,4,B00FBJLK2C,So happy I came across this blu ray.  Been looking for a some kind of video for my indoor walking.  Pretty decent.  Glad I got the blu ray as I have a 60' tv.  A few minutes at the beginning were a little anoying as this was shot in a rainy day and you see rain drops on the camera.,1427068800,,282,3.65
