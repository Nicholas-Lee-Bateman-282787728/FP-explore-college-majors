He did not torture his victims, nor burn ships with people on them.  He did however try to combat injustice while knocking the hell out of those who projected arrogance, believing themselves to be better than the rest of us.  And at the same time he ruled the Atlantic longer, helped those in need by freeing hundreds of slaves & advenging those wronged.

The rest of the video is great!  And even though many of the facts are wrong I throughly enjoyed it & will again & again.
