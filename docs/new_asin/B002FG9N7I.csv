8368966,4,B002FG9N7I,"I can't honestly give it ""5"" stars, but the only reason I'm giving it ""4"" is it ranks right up there with ED WOOD'S films! Very tacky, awful cheap, definitely ""non-threatening"".
Don't let the cover art fool you, and also as the director [in the bonus features said;] ""this IS NOT a pornographic film"". Black & White and any potential ""naughty bits"" being safely obscured by shading & arms, etc.
A cheezy story filmed in a ""film-student / avante-garde"" [on a safe level] style. The whole film looks as though it was shot all in one or one & a half days! [:-)]

The bonus features have two classic LSD & drug ""educational films"" which [to me] are worth the price of the DVD alone and an interview with the director & lead actor [sorry I can' think of their names at the moment].

I am NOT trashing on this, not at all [:-)] it's definitely one of the ""it's so bad [or ""cheap"" rather] that it's fun to watch!",1403308800,4,905,4.317647058823529
