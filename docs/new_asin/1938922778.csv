4133857,5,1938922778,"I rented this and then purchased it. Leiter is a jewel, a sensible, sensitive, and talented man in the last chapter of his life. The film is a good introduction to his work if you are unfamiliar with it, as I was. You will appreciate the quiet beauty of his photographs. The film also provides an insider's view of a life, a man who values love above success, who mourns the loss of his lifemate, and is in the midst of trying to clean out the sweet detritus of her life, and who sees nothing wrong with the legitimate work he did as a fashion photographer before he gained recognition as a ""fine"" photographer. Like photographer Bill Cunningham, he seeks beauty, has little interest in celebrity, and lives his life by his own credo. Leiter died in 2013 shortly after this film was released, I believe.",1421712000,,803,4.506849315068493
4133858,5,1938922778,"I thoroughly enjoyed this video. Leiter is such a talent and so unassuming that it's refreshing. He never sought notoriety or fame but produced work outside of the public eye that showed a keen eye for color and form when color was new to photography. He was a successful professional photographer but what captures our imagination is his work that no one knew existed until close to the end of his life.

I highly recommend this to photo enthusiasts who want to see the mind and work of a man with vision rather than the usual bloated egos and hyped work of megastars.",1416096000,4,569,4.524271844660194
4133859,1,1938922778,"No real enjoyment can be garnered from this art-umentary, Saul may be quite talented, but he's not well suited for video story telling.",1415491200,,135,4.913043478260869
4133860,3,1938922778,"I love Saul Leiter's photos, especially his early color work.  This movie is sort of an extended interview with him in his apartment and local environs nearby.  At one point toward the end of the film he looks at some footage and chuckles something to the effect ""this could be good if it's edited correctly"".  I thought it could have been shortened without cutting the interview parts.  Still, it is very informative and after viewing the film I wish I could have known Mr. Leiter personally.",1412812800,,493,4.6976744186046515
4133861,4,1938922778,liked it- i am a huge saul letter fan thus i would watch it either way- some of the letter interview content was a little meaningless to his work and did not offer any insight that I didn't know thus more researched insight would of made this a 5 star and more photographs that Saul might of discussed,1412640000,,301,4.206896551724138
4133862,2,1938922778,"A real disappointment. If you've seen the promo clip, then you've pretty much seen the entire movie. It could have been so much more, but it's basically a repetitive drag, with very little context or meaningful background info. What there is, is glossed over. A very lazy documentary - amateurish.",1411344000,2,297,4.96
4133863,4,1938922778,"What are the odds that TWO different documentary films on New York street photographers would be released within a week of each other? I would think, fairly high. But just after I received and reviewed a DVD titled More than the Rainbow about street photographer Matt Weber (and another four SPs who began shooting in the 1980s through today), I received this DVD which is devoted to just one famous SP  Saul Leiter. Leiter was a pioneer in this field and his heyday was the 1950s and 60s. In addition to having his work sold in galleries, he was a fashion photographer for Harpers Bazaar magazine. His specialty was color photos that were often purposely out of focus or distorted.

Dutch documentary film maker Tomas Leach convinced Leiter to allow him to come and interview him on film and thats the basic for In No Great Hurry. Leiter never wanted to be famous or in the spotlight (or so he says constantly in this 79 film (divided in to 13 lessons). He rarely  if ever- left his multistory apartment on the Lower East Side of New York and was the proverbial pack rat. If youve watch the TB show Hoarders you will know what to expect as you watch the interview. There is no rhyme or reason to how his negatives and slides (and camera supply catalogs) are piled. And he obviously doesnt care. As he says  hes in no great hurry to edit his piles of stuff.

Director Leach inserts close-ups of some of Leiters work in the film but, more often than not, he only shoots a photo that Leiter is holding and the images aren't clear for the viewer to see. His hand held camera doesnt help either and, in the earlier parts of the film, it is really jumpy.

Leiter is an engaging  though highly-opinionated  interviewee but Leach doesnt give us much background on Leiters earlier life or who some of the people that Leiter mentions are.  He basically turned on his camera, asked a few questions, and filmed Leiters answers. The editing could have been much tighter as the answers become repetitive.  And, just in case yiou think he didn't at least edit some, the DVD includes seven more interview segments (totaling about 15 minutes) as bonus features.

The music score (unlike More Than The Rainbow, which used a jazz score by Thelonious Monk) uses classical-style piano and strings, which also affects the pacing of the film).

Leiter lived to see the final version of the 2012 film and died in 2013.

The DVD is packaged with a four page folder containing a one-page Directors Statement, the list of the DVDS chapters and both a large photo of Leiter and one of his photographs.

While I did find Rainbow more entertaining, this DVD showed me the work of a photographer who carved the path for Weber and his fellow artists. And, anyone interested in photograph art will want to see both films.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4133864,5,1938922778,"Great start on documenting Saul's work. I wish that it would have delved into showing more of his work throughout photography and painting a little further. Otherwise, it is refreshing to hear a take on his life that is a bit outside of process and technique like most other documentaries do on relevant artists of contemporary times.",1459036800,,334,4.87719298245614

4133869,3,1938922778,"Wonderful to see and hear Saul Leiter. But the filmmaker seems completely out of his element, not at all tuned into the man he is making a film about. And the resulting film seems all wrong for the subject - the music, the filmmakers attempt to shoot in the style of Saul Leiter's photographs,, the idea of ""life lessons"" that seem so un-Saul Leiter. It's like Saul Leiter is fighting to come out of this box that filmmaker is trying to put him in. With Saul Leiter now having kicked the bucket, it's wonderful to have this hour with him. But it's a shame he didn't get a filmmaker who was tuned into him and wasn't so intent on turning him into something he not only wasn't but had no interest in...
And where's the painter? The painting? He was a painter! I think the filmmaker got permission to film him in the room with all the boxes of prints and slides and that was it and it strangles the film...",1438041600,6,903,4.286549707602339

8398722,5,1938922778,I actually enjoyed this movie. Maybe it's just because I enjoy speaking with people of another generation and hear about their life experiences. Couple that with my love for photography and I think you've got a winner. Interesting that he really never left his neighborhood and still had amazing images. I love his attitude about his photography as well. He doesn't make a big deal about it and doesn't see what the fuss is about. This is a nice video about an interesting guy. Take a look,1464566400,,489,4.632183908045977
