8462169,5,B0058P8F0Y,"What a neat biography of Margaret Mitchell.  She had some interesting experiences and she crossed many boundaries for ""proper ladies"" of her day.  She was a newspaper reporter when holding down a job outside the home was almost unthinkable for a society woman.  What an interesting childhood she had--listening to antebellum stories of her great aunts and other relatives.",1355011200,,372,5.271186440677966
8462170,5,B0058P8F0Y,"MM is my favorite author. I love to hear more about her life. If you are interested in something very in depth, during the time she wrote and published GWTW, read the book of her letters. Now that is fantastic for a 'windy' like myself.",1343606400,2,236,4.266666666666667

8462173,5,B0058P8F0Y,"This is a dynamic DVD of a documentary first shown on Georgia Public Broadcasting to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the publication of ""Gone With the Wind.""  It is not only a close-up of a fascinating woman writer but of the history of the south from 1900, when Margaret Mitchell was born, until 1949, when her life ended tragically.  It is full of photos and videos of Mitchell throughout her life as well as interviews with Mitchell biographers and historians.  It has original music created for the documentary which moves the documentary quickly through Mitchell's life and times.  Highly recommended.
The difference between the $19.95 version and the $29.95 Collector's version is the Collector's Edition has material which did not make it into the final documentary including commentary from author Pat Conroy about the importance of ""Gone With the Wind"" to him personally, premiere footage of the movie in 1939 and footage of the Pulitzer Prize night in 1937.",1313452800,11,969,5.0754716981132075
