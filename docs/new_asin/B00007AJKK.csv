1803787,5,B00007AJKK,"I've waited years for this movie to be released on video/DVD. Thank God my patience has finally been rewarded. Claudine is a sweet movie about family and a woman who's made mistakes but loves her children and is willing to make sacrifices to provide for them. Released during the age of blaxploitation, the film features real characters that are well rounded.
James Earl Jones is fanstatic as always despite his protests to the contrary in the commentary. Lawrence Hilton Jacobs does a fine job as well. Carroll is a revelation especially to those television and movie watchers who know her only from Dynasty, Julia or the Five Heartbeats. Hey movie studios, how about stepping outside the box for once and find this underutilized talent another leading, meaty role?
Another plus is the outstanding soundtrack. The team of Curtis Mayfield and Gladys Knight and the Pips was a winning one. I wish someone would re-issue the CD like they did a few years ago.
My only complaint...a small one...is I wish that there were more special features. A where on they now on the children in the movie would have been really nice.",1043798400,11,1117,4.822916666666667
1803788,5,B00007AJKK,"This is a wonderful film.  Historically, I think it is one of the first movies to ever attempt a realistic, three-dimensional portrayal of a complex love affair between an African-American man and woman.  Although it does not succeed on every level, it is earnest, entertaining and extremely well acted.  Diahann Carroll stars as the title character Claudine, a pretty middle-aged woman whose life is complicated and yet enormously enriched by having to single-handedly raise six children. Claudine is on welfare but also works a job on the side.  James Earl Jones is Roop, who turns out to be Claudine's black knight in shining armor. Claudine and Reuben are very human, but find that their love can bring out the best in each other.
Carroll and Jones are both so committed and masterful in their performances that it really elevates material that in lesser hands could be trite and somewhat embarrassing.  Carroll, in particular, showed great commitment to this piece, she skillfully shed her high glamour image to play a single mother on welfare, and invested the character with humanity and dignity as readily as she exposed the character's human flaws.  It is a staggering achievement for a woman who began her career as a cabaret singer.  Carroll was most deservingly nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress.
The young actors are very good as well.  Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, only 19 at the time, did a great job of conveying the frustration, confusion and rage of a fatherless young man trying not the repeat the mistakes of his parents and yet fearful of going the wrong way. Tamu is also great, and she brings sass and charm to her role as the eldest daughter who loves, and is loved by, her beleaguered mother but is still uncertain of how she can avoid Claudine's life of hardship.
""Claudine's"" gorgeous score is courtesy of the grand maestro of Black American cinema, Curtis Mayfield.  Mayfield composed the original songs, which are memorably performed by Gladys Knight & Pips.  My only complaint is that the DVD has rather shoddy production values.  It was not remastered so the image is not typical DVD quality, and the DVD is very low on extras.  Although it does feature audio commentary by Jones, Carroll and Hilton-Jacobs, among others.  Otherwise, ""Claudine"" gets my highest recommendation. It is a landmark in African-American Cinema.",1043020800,11,2386,4.979848866498741
1803789,5,B00007AJKK,"This was not only a great movie, but also great album with all of the music in the movie by Gladys Knight and the Pips.  I believe I have a collectors album with all of the rocking songs that are clear and have absolutely no cursing at all in them.  I don't understand why this movie has not been shown even on television.  I heard the story that it was being tied up by someone in Detroit.  My grown children still sing ""To Be Invisible"" and ""On and On"".  I lived with both of my parents growing up. We were not on the welfare, but I remember how hard the times were back then.  I can relate to the apartment building and the area where this family lived. I cannot wait to get my copy.  I believe I will order a few more to give to my children as presents.",1042156800,3,757,4.006666666666667
1803790,5,B00007AJKK,"Oh boy...this movie has taken sometime to get to video format. I actually taped it from the Movie Channel years ago, but I will buy this copy. The story is such a great commentary on the welfare system and how nearly impossible it is to live a normal life based on their rules and regulations. I see why Diahann Carroll earned an Oscar nomination. She really shines in this movie and so does James Earl Jones. The kids are good and provide some comic relief without acting bufoonish. I strongly recommend this thought provoking film.",1041897600,5,533,4.621052631578947
1803791,5,B00007AJKK,"When this movie originally came out, I went with my family to see it.  I was a child then.  Now that I am 39 and a grandmother, I have longed to have this movie in my collection.  I have searched other web-sites and this is the first one to have this.  I am greatly pleased and will inform others of your variety.
Claudine is a wholesome movie that reflects reality in our community.  I enjoyed how no matter what situations came up, they always worked it out, and in the end they stood by each other, even when getting arrested.
Again I must say, that I can't wait to add this to my collection .",1039651200,6,596,4.147826086956521
1803792,5,B00007AJKK,"I Love this movie.. And I am so glad that it's coming out on video. You have this woman with a lot of kids(Diahann Carroll), who is on welfare and works on the side to make ends meet. She meets this garbageman(James Earl Jones) who likes her despite the kids, dates her, and despite his own problems, want to marry her. In time,he gets cold feet and runs off for a minute thinking on the committment he's about to take on, but in the end, love rules the day. This movie,which the late Diana Sands got a hold of initially, was about to star in but got sick and later died, is so realistic. You have this woman who is on welfare, but works. You have this man who loves this woman, but he got kids from another relationship, and he got to pay for that too, then marry a woman with five kids?... That's enough to make anyone take a pause for the cause. Not to say it isn't a good idea. I have seen men do it and keep on going. But, it will make you think. A great movie by an unlikely actress. Diahann usually plays classier roles, yet she was  good in this one so much so that she was nominated for an Oscar for that role.",1037232000,44,1119,4.0633484162895925
1803793,5,B00007AJKK,"Excellent movie sure to entertain all those who watch.  Diahann Carroll, James Earl Jones and Lawrence Hilton Jacobs put in the performance of their lives.

1803833,1,B00007AJKK,"The black ghetto stereotypes: profanity, fried chicken, cockroach infested apartment and the unempowered ""white man got me down"" attitude throughout. The James Earl Jones character can't get ahead because the system is against him; his paychecks are dunned for child support .The Diahann Carroll character's hypocrisy of sleeping around while beating her daughter for getting pregnant are just a couple examples of  the main character's willingness to blame their hopeless lives on ""the man"" rather than their own choices and actions. The son's vasectomy subplot and Claudine's angry response ""why would you do this to yourself? This is what the white man is trying to do to you"" CRINGE. This movie was pathetic and misguided when it premiered and is especially hard to watch now. Good actors in a overrated and downright embarrassing film. I am surprised that more viewers do not find this movie offensive, let alone the many who seem to love it.",1511827200,,947,5.109677419354838

I know the story is a common one, so people can relate, but baby daddy issues and single motherhood shouldn't be a thing we all amen to, but learn from.

The movie is reflction of the real circumstances (TODAY). The acting is stellar by Carroll and Jones.

But, the story pissed me off and I hated it. Claudine's an idiot. Roop's an idiot. I get mad thinking about the real versions of them and how broken the system is.",1485561600,,495,4.24468085106383

1804028,5,B00007AJKK,"Will have to replace my dvd.  I loaned it out, never got it back.  What can I say?  one of the best movies ever made depicting working class/working poor Black life.  It ranks up there with "" A raisin in the Sun"", and deals with issues still going on today. Although Diahann Carroll played a welfare mother with six children, she did it with class, dignity and beauty that she naturally exudes. Diahann Carroll and James Earl Jones are electrifying. Their on-screen chemistry was off the charts: funny, sexy, somewhat disturbing and in the end, joyous. Not only is the movie a classic, but the Soundtrack was as well.  Curtis Mayfield...ahhhh!, what a Genius.  And Gladys Knight and the Pips' vocals made the Claudine soundtrack one of my Desert Island Faves.  When Gladys sings ""To Be Invisible"", she goes straight for your heart, and does not miss her intended target.  I listen to it and cry each time. This is a great addition to your Black Cinema collection.  Great Movie.",1451433600,,977,4.7

1804157,4,B00007AJKK,"An important film in its day, it still holds up well. Claudine was one of the first mainstream U.S. dramas
to deal with the struggles of urban poor African-Americans without exploitation, violence or exaggeration
on one side, or sugar coating or soft peddling on the other. It has sadness, anger and heartache, but also
joy, love and humor. It has two smashing central performances by Diahann Carroll as the mother of six,
trying to survive on welfare and an off the books job as a housekeeper, and James Earl Jones as a very
charming garbage man who woos her despite the risk their getting together could cut her welfare payments.

Carroll is a wonder. One of the most glamorously beautiful actresses of her era, here she manages to be
believable as an over-worked, under loved mother in the ghetto. Equal parts pain, pride, vulnerability,
smarts and strength she was one of the first African Americans to get an Oscar nomination in a drama.
Jones does some of his best film work. Always a great of the U.S. theater, in his early films Jones often
came off as too theatrical, larger than life. But here is he subtle, sly, complicated, and very sexy. The
young actors playing Carrolls six children are uniformly excellent, often a weak spot in a film like this.

There are problems; some plot turns are predictable, some moments feel a bit Hollywood, some of it
feels awkwardly dated. But much of it is as relevant as ever, and not afraid to be upsetting and angry
along with its gentle comedy.

Two notes, while often marketed as a family film, this deals with sex and nudity in an honest and realistic
way, and its language is salty and true. Also, sadly, the only available DVD is full screen  too bad since the
film was quite nicely shot in its gritty way.",1383868800,,1760,4.613418530351438

At any rate, Claudine is a true classic and even seems versatile as a type of 70's sitcom. At any rate, its the type of movie you don't want to watch over and over. It does the trick about two or three times and thats it. One feature is the movies realism. James Earl Jones is young and hot. Claudine is unexpectedly flashy and exposed. It gets soo real and not quite something offered often in those 70's classic films. At any rate the realism makes it heavy to watch just to fill late night hours atleast repeatedly. Its like moving through a true life experience and its not always easy to pounce around uptown Harlem and negotiate all the chaos.

1804252,4,B00007AJKK,"There is something so genuinely sweet about `Claudine', so warm and real that I can't help but truly adore it.  It has its faults (I really hated the campy way it ended) and sometimes its uneven mixture of grit and humor can make it appear like an overlong sitcom episode, but the rich and beautifully sincere performances and the touching screenplay really make this a must-see film.

Claudine is a single mother of six who is trying to survive, keeping a house keeping job on the down low so that she won't lose her welfare benefits.  She hasn't been with a man in quite some time, so when Roop, a big hearted garbage man, comes along she is very eager to jump into a relationship; even if her kids resent her for it.  It isn't long though before her children love Roop as much as she does; but her fear (as well as his) of losing his humanity to `the system' may be the nail in the coffin of their seemingly perfect relationship.

The key to this film is the wonderful performances by the two leads.  I have never even heard of Diahann Carroll before seeing this movie, but she is just luminous here, so much so that I want to research her resume and start watching some more movies.  An even bigger surprise to me was James Earl Jones, an actor who I tend to find a little stale.  He reminds me a little of Lawrence Fishburne, in that he almost never appears relaxed; always relying on the heaviness of his voice to carry him.  Here though he floored me, for he was loose, energetic, playful and very sincere.  It reminded me of the time I saw `What's Love Got to Do With It?' and realized that Fishburne had it in him to be something amazing.

The script works for the most part, giving Claudine and Roop real personalities with real problems.  I like the fact that it shies away from making the `white man' the enemy but focuses on the corruptness of the system supposedly designed to `help'.  Like I said, I didn't like the final scene, which I felt was overdone and almost campy (it didn't fit at all) but for the most part the film excels, especially when it leaves the focus on the relationship between Claudine and Roop.

I'm impressed, I must admit, and I'll surely watch this one again.",1238371200,,2199,4.397530864197531

1804265,5,B00007AJKK,"This is a great movie, but i'm reading a  few of the reviews here and the one written by the user  Taperpowell especially caught my attention. Did we actually watch the same movie here because this movie seems to have totally gone over your head. What crass commercialism are you talking about? This movie hardly has any cussing, absolutely no violence and one tame love scene so I have no idea what you're on about. Another thing, this movie is absolutely NOT a Blaxploitation film. I am sick of older black movies being labeled as that. I actually enjoy the Blaxploitation genre but this film does not fit in that category at all. Most blaxploitation films are  low budget, include enourmous amount of nudity, violence, sex and usually involve pimps in the storyline. No, this film is none of that. This film is just a movie about a woman with six kids trying to work hard in order to provide for herself and her family. I will agree that the romance between Claudine and James Earl Jone's character moves too fast, I wish more time had been taken to develop that and I wish the movie had been a bit longer, but this is BY FAR one of the best black movie's or family movie's period of this time and still holds up until this day. The characters are likeable and the the movie is well written and directed. It holds your interest the entire time. The soundtrack is great too. Gladys Knight & The Pips and Curits Mayfield are a match made in heaven and provide perfect music for this movie.",1233187200,2,1490,4.470588235294118

1804267,3,B00007AJKK,"I collect blaxploitation films because I enjoy the messages they portray.  I realize the filmmakers were trying to make money, but many were also trying to be ""gritty"" and ""raw"" and ""honest"" about depicting what was happening in the black community in the 1970's.  When a film really does that, you can enjoy and learn from it even when it displays negative messages...because we all walk away realizing something should be changed.  That said--and admitting that Claudine was obviously seeking to be that kind of movie, lancing at the welfare system for being inefficient and standing in the way of true love--here's why it isn't successful at being that kind of movie, even after trying so hard to be:

The love story, as one reviewer has already pointed out, moves way too fast.  It's too easy to slip into feeling like, ""so THAT's why this lady has 6 kids by 4 fathers; bucket of chicken, bottle of wine, that's all it takes.""  If we want to feel compassion for her, that she's doing all she can, we need to see her with some self-control in this area too.  We know she has some; she gets herself up and goes secretly to work as a maid each morning.  I know what goes on between adults, but if it had gone on a little later, I could respect her struggle a little more and not feel quite as much like she brought a lot of her trouble on herself.

The language is gratuitously obscene.  I'm not a prude, but cursing in movies is placed there to indicate strong emotion in a scene.  Great, fine.  But that many times in a row in some of the scenes?  Okay, OKAY, I get it, strong emotion...now, stop cussing each other out and give me some dialogue that moves the story along.  If all you have is a string of 4-letter words, we've got a bad scriptwriter, actors ad-libbing badly, or both.  Not compelling as cinema, and certainly not something the whole family should watch or that should be shown on TV, as a few reviewers have suggested.  Having the kids do it was definitely not cool.  We will never watch this movie with my daughter in the room.

The crass commercialism every time a music cue comes up was particularly annoying.  They were REALLY pushing this soundtrack album.  Even when you see them put on records during the Father's Day party in their home, you hear another track from Gladys Knight & The Pips, straight from the album.  I love soul music from the '60's and '70's as much as I like blaxploitation films, but after this movie I didn't want the soundtrack; they'd overdone it.  It created a surreal impression that this was the only music that ever existed in their world, which was just one more thing contributing to the artificial feel of the movie.  And I can't think of one thing I heard during the movie that was by Curtis Mayfield, though he gets a credit.  As much as I like GK & Pips, I was sure tired of them by the end of this DVD.

It was fun to see Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs before he became Freddie Washington on ""Welcome Back, Kotter"".  But the whole vasectomy subplot was a rabbit trail we could have done without.  We get that he is an angry young black man; this scene added nothing to the story.  It was a setup for Claudine to deliver the lines about ""why would you do this to yourself, this is what the white man is trying to do to you..."" but just isn't believable, or necessary, by the late point in the movie that it occurs, and only makes it run longer.  We already got that message when she and Rupe visit the welfare office earlier, though not in those words.

I admire that they tried to tell this story, and in spite of its shortcomings (of which I've listed four, but there are more), I recognize what they were trying to do.  In fact, it did enlighten me some on the issue; part of my own growing up years were spent in a poor white neighborhood with a lot of welfare recipients, and some of the same problems.  If someone ever really got down to making it without being so heavy-handed, it might be a great premise for a movie.

I bought it because I'm trying to see as many of the movies of this genre as I possibly can, and it is better than some.  Since 20th Century Fox did it, there was at least some professionalism on the technical side...but even here, the soundtrack could have been fixed so you could understand the dialogue when the characters were mumbling (which seemed to happen often).  To make my collection complete, I'm keeping it, but it's not one I'll return to often, like ""Shaft"" or ""Superfly"".  92 minutes seems like 3 hours when I run this film.  See it once, get beat over the head with its message, then you can move on to the next one.",1230508800,,4615,4.393404004711425

1804272,5,B00007AJKK,"I bought a copy of the DVD from Amazon a couple of months ago...and I cannot tell you how many times I have watched it since. I am a child of the 70's and all themes and settings in the movie are a part of my childhood.  I remember playing outside on the sidewalk in Harlem and just being kids.  This movie makes me cry everytime it ends!  When I have nothing to watch on TV I pop it in the DVD player and pour a glass of wine and just think back.  This movie shows the strength and fortitude of two people trying to work themselves up in life in spite of the financial hardships that they face.  I don't think Rupert ran out on his children.  I firmly believe that those relationships just did not work out for him.  Same as Claudine.  Granted there were nine children between them but all in all they were two people who happened to find themselves later on in life after they had already acquired so much baggage.  The hookers and rodent infested apartments were what many families who lived in the tenements back in those days had to contend with.  Overall Rupert was a hard working honest man.  Claudine just wanted a good life for her children and that showed in how she went to work while she was collecting welfare.  The soundtrack is amazing.  I just downloaded it and I listen to it over and over again.  'Be Invisible' is my favorite tune, the music and lyrics are so true to life.  Soundtrack and movie are fabulous.

Anyway, Dianne Carroll played this part to the bone, I don't think any other black actress of the day could play the part she did. Excellent storyline and excellent plot! I could relate to this very well, because I have 5 other siblings and my mother was a single mother.

1804297,4,B00007AJKK,"Too real was the plot/story. Back then, a single woman single-handedly raising a half dozen kids and trying to keep her sanity at the same time was a common occurrence. Then a man steps into the picture and she's faced with several dilemmas; one question that she's asking herself if she should give the kids a step daddy or not. Although times are tough for her, she still loves her children enough to consider their point of view. And she's faced with the possibility of losing public assistance if she does marry. So true is how the government treat under-privileged people. They don't want you to have too much. One thing I've always wondered was what did a man buying a woman something with his own money have to do with whether or not she qualified for government assistance. I'm so glad those days of social workers showing up at a woman's house and snooping around are gone. That invaded their right to privacy, which to me says their constitutional rights were being violated. And this mess was going on just as recently as the mid-70s. Shows that blacks still haven't gotten THAT far yet.

Nine kids between them and I'm supposed to feel sorry for Rupert when the government starts garnishing his check?  NOT!  I realize this film was supposed to be landmark because it was trying to depict a normal black family just trying to get by and it came out during the blaxplortation era-so it was supposed to soften all the thugs and pimps stuff.  And maybe it did.  But it missed every mark with me as far as being a romance.  I was appalled by the first date-being taken to a roach and rat infested apartment where all the hookers say hello as he enters the building-and then having the date end with a bucket of fried chicken.  Then this woman with the SIX kids sleeps with this man on the first date. I swear I must have frowned through most of the movie.  The language of the children.  And can someone tell me how Charles had himself fixed?  How did he pay for this?  Whatever happened to birth control?  Condoms?  Why was I listening to rhetoric about how the welfare system doesn't work, instead of a public announcement for birth control?  And did the welfare system EVER work this efficiently?
This film DID humanize black characters-but it definitely didn't put us in the best of lights. (Why doesn't that look like Diahann Carroll on the cover?)",1192320000,7,1417,4.409266409266409

Claudine looks forward to trash collection in the suburban neighborhood....where a young, handsome and obviously smitten James Earl Jones (playing the character Rupert) tries to woo her.  The two begin dating, and fall in love.  But the pressures of the prying eyes of social workers and Rup's own checkered past soon come calling.  Will Rupert step up and be the man that Claudine and the children need and know he is?
With an endearing cast a great soundtrack courtesy of Gladys Knight (remember that hit Make Yours A Happy Home?), this movie is a classic with issues and concerns that unfortunately are still very relevant...this is a must for every movie collection.

The main characters, Claudine (Diahann Carroll) and ""Roop"" (James Earl Jones) are great, very charasmatic and come across great on the screen. However, I thought Claudine's kids were hilarious. Keep an eye out for the scene where Claudine is having breakfast with her kids after her first date with Roop.

Someone like Cicily Tyson or Esther Rolle would've pulled it off more convincingly. Ms. Carroll has just too much of a glamorous charisma for it.

1804319,5,B00007AJKK,"Claudine is one of my all time favorite movies. I love the story which resonates with stories of today. What I loved about Claudine were the characters, and the bold statements the movie made. The movie discussed issues not only dealing with Black America, but also with poor America. The story discusses such controversial topics as minimum wages, jobs (and the lack there of), sexuality, teen pregnancy, race, sterilization, masculinity, welfare, basically you name it and the movie talks about it.

But what I love most is Claudine. She is bold and has a lot to say. She knows her struggles and is not disillusioned as the government would like to think. She battles the system while trying to raise her family. However, the story does not let it stop there, this is a love story. I think many people would like to think that a woman with six children should not be worried about a new love interest, but Claudine goes there.

I cannot say it enough, buy Claudine it should be a part of your movie collection. Maybe with the sales of this they will put more Black movie classics on DVD.

1804366,5,B00007AJKK,"I remember when CLAUDINE first came out.  I was a pre-teen growing up on the South Side of Chicago.  I think it was my babysitter who took my sister and I to see the movie.  We LOVED it. We wanted to see it over and over, but of course we couldn't; we were children.  Who was going to keep taking us to the movies?
  When the movie finally got to TV, I had to see it, but it wasn't the same.  My sister and I, who almost knew the movie word for word, would ask, ""Where's the part where...""  It was so edited.  Still, when able to do so, I did copy the TV version. Any version was better than no version.
  I was so happy when videos came out.  I said to myself, ""I can finally see the UNCUT version of CLAUDINE.
  When my aunt got her first recorder, a Betamax, we would go to the videostore, I think it was called Errols, and check out the maximum number of videos you could.  From those early times I searched and searched and asked and asked for CLAUDINE.  I looked through that huge video directory that would be in the store, but it was NOT listed and most of the people I asked didn't know what I was talking about. I could not understand why it couldn't be found.  I wanted to write in to that question section in the front of the Parade magazine to ask why CLAUDINE wasn't in video format, but I never did.
  Imagine my surprise and delight when I walked into Blockbuster yesterday around midnight, and there was CLAUDINE.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  I checked it out, and when I got home, though it was after midnight, I not only watched it once, I watched it a second time with the commentary from some of the actors.  I am now older than ""Claudine"" was in the movie, but I STILL absolutely LOVE it and I LOVE the soundtrack!
  James Earl Jones and Diahann Carroll have the best chemistry in this movie.
  Of course I'm going to buy it, not just for myself, but for my sister and one of my aunts, too.
  I highly recommend this movie.  It is HEART-WARMING and just WONDERFUL.",1088121600,4,1997,4.167979002624672

But the one thing I remember about his movie is the soundtrack! Some of the best soundtracks ever: Sparkle (Aretha), Car Wash and of course Claudine (Gladys), my fav: To Be Invisible!!!",1053043200,,318,4.781818181818182

1804370,5,B00007AJKK,"""Claudine"" is one of those rare films that no matter how old it is, it always seems to get better each time you watch it.
This film centers around a mother of six, Claudine, and struggles with raising her children, earning enough money, fighting the ""system"", and handling her love life. James Earl Jones and Diahann Carroll did excellent jobs of playing the lead roles.
I would highly suggest this film! It's full of all the things that make a movie truly great!",1049155200,2,463,4.590361445783133
1804371,5,B00007AJKK,"A crowning achievement, if ever.  Diahann Carroll steps out of character, as she portrays a welfare mother exploited the system.  James Earl Jones, one of hollywood's finest actors, plays a fantastic part; a part in which you can feel an emotional vibe, because two black people in the mid-70's is still victimized by  social injustices of our time.  It shows how two people, although victims of poverty can feel real love; and, how 6 children on welfare, whom are fatherless become defensive and lash-out at the world.
The acting in this movie is superb, from Diahann Carroll, the character we knew as Julia can get down-and-dirty; James Earl Jones, who'd been over-looked by Hollywood for years, is so convincing, that you want to smile at your garbage man the next day.  Lawrence Hilton Jacobs, who was so funny in Welcome Back Kotter, now shows another side of his acting ability, as he plays Charles, the oldest of 6 children, who is so fed-up with the system he has a operation to avoid having children.
And, the music is so typical of Curtis Mayfield, a composer who was ahead of his time, blends a combination of styles from ""On-and-On"" to ""The Makings of you"", in a master-piece, similar to what he'd done in Superfly.  This is a must-see movie!",1046995200,10,1254,4.729357798165138
1804372,5,B00007AJKK,"Well, I admit I'm biased (because my parents wrote and co-produced CLAUDINE), but after seeing the film again as an adult (I was 19 when it came out), I am amazed by the splendid acting and, yes, my parents' remarkable script. This film definitely improved with age, and I'm extremely happy that my late parents' finest work is finally available for the home video/DVD market. It was a total blast working on the DVD commentary track; to find out that the movie meant so much to Diahann Carroll, James Earl Jones, Lawrence Hilton Jacobs, and George Tillman Jr. was extremely gratifying. Thanks to all the CLAUDINE fans that clamored for the movie and helped bring it home.",1044576000,26,672,4.752136752136752
