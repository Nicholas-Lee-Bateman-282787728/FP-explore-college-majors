I like the opening match the nation vs. Faarooq/Shamrock/Blackman was great it was quick and entertaining(ie faarooq using his belt on The Rock). The L.O.D. 2000 vs. The NOA for the tag titles was very entertaining and had a very original ending. The inferno match was great, besides Kane's really bad ending. Austin vs. Dude Love was exciting especially when Vince got laid out by a chair to the face.",1087948800,,478,4.635294117647059

I expect the Evening Gown match to be a little bit longer but it was 3 minutes short. I like the Inferno match because it was intense with excitement & shocking suprises. Seeing The Undertaker wrestling inferno match makes me wonder whats next for him, I mean he has battle Giants, hell in a cell, casket matches, etc. Undertaker has has overcome all obstacles in The WWE & I don't think there will be another Superstar to forfill his legacy. The main-event between Austin & Dude love was a good match especially Mcmahon get his head knocked off.

The  under-card was fairly hit and miss with DX aka HHH taking on Owen Hart in a  match that was given nice build up in the preceding episodes of RAW. The  Inferno match is a typical back-and-forth contest that was left down not  only by the lack of high-risk bumps but also the terrible ending. When the  WWF says the match will only end when someone is set on fire, they mean,  'as soon as the padded glove is ignited a billion guys with fire  extinguishers will put it out'. The feeling of lighting a match in a petrol  station that filled my stomach when the Inferno match was first announced  soon dies down... or should I say, gets extinguished. Austin and Dude Love  put on an excellent match with the love-to-hate McMahon stealing the show  by getting his butt kicked by Austin.

Double J Sings with country  superstar Sawyer Brown! (Just used to be put on Celeb entertainment outlets cheap) silly filler,

Faarooq, Ken Shamrock and Steve Blackman vs  The Nation of Domination (Six-Man Tag team War)
2.5 Star match interesting for various reasons This version of The Nation was watered down and a massive wasted opportunity

Triple H  vs Owen Hart ( WWF European Championship Match) 3.5 Star match mostly in part to the late Own Hart carrying the match

The New Midnight Express (Bodacious Bart and Bombastic Bob with Jim Cornette) vs the Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson)  Tag team match for the NWA World Tag Team Championship
The NWA in WWF was a cool idea that was also wasted and torn down quick mostly due to the upcoming Brawl for All 2.5 Stars

Luna Vachon vs Sable  (First Ever Evening Gown Match!)  Terrible cheap T&A match selling sex just to sell sex
It's a glorified cat fight there's been much better ""Catfight"" style matches in USWA, SMW, and ECW
The best thing about this is Luna this was only booked to get Sable 1/2 Naked!

 The New Age Outlaws vs LOD 2000 /with Sunny  ( WWF Tag Team Championship) average forgettable tag team match
LOD 2000 was a strange nostalgic tag-team =now used as jobbers

The Undertaker vs Kane (First Ever Inferno Match in the WWF/WWE) over kill cheap gimmicky trying way to hard
The build up to Undertaker/Kane feud was great but, this was just bad!
They tried to emulate a  Puerto Rico/Japanese style deathmatch but, it was so over-produced and phony
Doing any type of match with fire in a massive arena is such a stupid idea
(If you want to see what a real Inferno deathmatch looks like check out classic matches from  Puerto Rico,  W*ING, IWA Japan, FMW, and Big Japan Pro Wrestling)
1 Star terrible chapter in the Undertaker/Kane feud

Dude Love vs Stone Cold Steve Austin  (WWF Championship)  a solid 5 Star match from two of the biggest attitude era super stars

Overall this late 1990's PPV is a interesting time capsule when the WWF were trying to be more gritty/real and copy ECW
This is before they became a publicly traded company and just gave up and rested on there laurels
It's interesting and enjoyable overall but, it does have problems 7.5/10
This DVD is long out of print (cause the WWF is like Playboy they have a decent  back catalog but, only release physical dvd's once
Is this dvd worth getting it all depends it's not worth the insane mark-up you might be able to find a used copy at a used book store, pawn shop, or goodwill
I have no idea if you can see this PPV uncut on the network",1457913600,,2796,4.536926147704591

This was the first PPV in which the Nation was fully under The Rock's lead and we begin seeing Kama transitioning to The Godfather character. The match starts off with some tussling between Blackman and D'Lo. We eventually get some action between the new and former Nation leaders Rock and Faarooq. After both teams work each other over for a decent amount of time, Faarooq puts The Rock away with the Dominator for the win

Stone Cold Steve Austin comes to ringside, throws the timekeeper in the ring and threatens him saying that if he screws him out of the title in the main event, he'll beat him up

2.) WWF European Championship Match: Owen Hart vs Hunter Hearst Helmsley  (Chyna suspended above ring in cage at ringside)

Following another Chyna interference at Wrestlemania that cost Owen winning the European Championship, Commissioner Slaughter had finally had it with her interfering in matches. Owen was given another shot at Triple H's European Championship and this time made the ruling that Chyna would be forced to watch the match suspended above the ring, locked inside of a cage. Owen controls HHH for the opening minutes of the match, owning him all around the ring. HHH manages to counter Owen's attacks with a sick face crash into a turnbuckle pad. HHH stays in control of the Black Hart for the time, while the camera consistently shows Chyna trying to escape the cage. Chyna ends up bending the bars of the cage and squeezes through to escape. The cage is eventually lowered, revealed to be Road Dogg who lowered it. Slaughter and several referees return to ringside and try to capture Chyna. Owen Pedigrees HHH and goes for the pin but all the referees are distracted trying to get rid of Chyna. While the referees are distracted, X-Pac enters the ring and attacks Owen with a fire extinguisher. HHH manages to drape an arm across the chest of Owen and the referee runs back to the ring and makes the count for the win. Interesting match, I just find it a little disappointing that they made Owen look like a weakling during his feud with Triple H. Michael Cole interviews Owen after the match about losing the match due to the DX antics and Owen coins his phrase ""Enough is enough and it's time for a change!"" that would lead to him joining the Nation the next night on Raw.

3.) NWA Tag Team Championship Match: The New Midnight Express (Bodacious Bart and Bombastic Bob Holly) w/Jim Cornette vs The Rock n Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson)

Short match and not much to be said about it. Semi-comical moment where Jim Cornette tries to fight referee Tim White and Tim scares him away. Bob Holly hits a bulldog on Gibson and Bart makes the cover for the win to retain the titles.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Evening Gown Match: Luna w/Goldust vs Sable

The first ever Evening Gown match starts right away with Sable and Luna grabbing at each other, trying to rip each other's clothes off. Luna strikes first as she gets Sable in a corner and rips her skirt off. Just as Sable starts to fight back and get some offense in, Marc Mero comes down and distracts Sable just long enough for Luna to rip off the rest of her gown for the win. A pissed off Sable attacks Luna after the match with a Sable Bomb and chases her under the ring. Sable re-emerges a minute later, holding Luna's clothing and poses afterwards

Vince McMahon comes to the ring with Gerald Briscoe and Pat Patterson and cuts a promo about whether or not he'll screw Stone Cold out of the title and goes on to state that Austin will screw himself out of the title

5.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: The New Age Outlaws (c) vs LOD 2000 w/Sunny

LOD controls the Outlaws in the early going parts of the match but their momentum is cut short when Billy clips Animal's leg, preventing him and Hawk from hitting the Doomsday Device on Road Dogg. Once The Outlaws take control, Billy and Road Dogg use great teaming strategy to work over Animal's left leg. The hot tag is eventually made to Hawk and Billy hits Hawk with one of the championship belts behind the referee's back but it only gets them a 2 count. They try it again but Road Dogg accidentally hits Billy with the belt instead. Hawk german suplexes Road Dogg to get the win....or so we thought. The referee ends up rewarding the match to the Outlaws as Hawk's animals were also on the mat during the pin, resulting in The Outlaws retaining the titles. LOD attacks ref Jack Doan following the match and drop with the Doomsday Device for good measure

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

We get a short concert from Double J, Jeff Jarrett and Mark Miller, sponsored by Tennessee Lee. Jarrett was obviously lip syncing the entire time but that was the whole point of his country music star character. I'm a Jeff Jarrett fan, but I really never cared for his country star gimmick. It never appealed to me, but I'll take a musical performance like this over the garbage we get on Raw nowadays from Flo Rida and Florida Georgia Line. After the performance, Jarrett is assaulted by Steve Blackman. Tennessee Lee cracks a guitar over Blackman's head and Jarrett puts on the Figure 4 Leg Lock on Blackman.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Inferno Match: Kane w/Paul Bearer vs The Undertaker

The Kane/Undertaker feud continued after Wrestlemania had some more amazing and intense storytelling to it. Paul Bearer claimed he had a dream that the ring was surrounded by fire, thus visualizing the Inferno Match. Not satisfied with Kane losing at Wrestlemania, Bearer challenged Undertaker to fight Kane again in the Inferno Match and dug up and destroyed the caskets of Undertaker's parents to add on to the intensity of the storyline. Lawler was pretty hilarious as he had hot dogs and marshmallows to toast on Undertaker when he caught fire and went on to ask J.R. how he liked his Undertaker: regular or extra crispy. From an entertainment perspective, this match was good as everyone paid to see either Undertaker or Kane get caught on fire. From an entertainment in wrestling perspective this match wasn't as good as Kane and Taker were restricted to what they could do due the ring being surrounded by fire, so they mostly had to stay centered for most of it, making this match not as good as their classic at Wrestlemania. With each strong striking move, the flames rose high, enticing cheers from the crowd. There comes an interesting part of the match where Undertaker throws Kane out of the ring and Kane heads for the back but he's attacked by a returning Vader who hadn't been seen since Kane bashed his brains in with a monkey wrench back at the No Way Out of Texas PPV. Amidst the brawl, Taker finally finds his way out of the ring with an impressive suicide dive over the top rope onto Kane and Vader. After taking Kane out with a chair, Taker stalks Bearer over near the entrance way and busts him open with one of the drums used in Jarrett's concert. Making his way back to the ring, a kick to the gut sends Kane into the fire where his arm catches on fire, giving Undertaker the win. A fairly good and memorable match for entertainment value but truly lacked in competition

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) WWF Championship Match: Dude Love vs Stone Cold Steve Austin (c)

Vince McMahon's worst dream came true when Stone Cold Steve Austin won the WWF Championship at Wrestlemania 14. After failing to get Austin to adapt to the system as a respectable, corporate champion, McMahon found his first of many prospects to dethrone Austin and take the title from him in Dude Love; one of Mick Foley's 3 alter egos. Dude starts the match off attacking Austin from behind but Austin soon fights back with some offense and what follows is a spectacular back and forth and competitive main event match. The match periodically ends up heading over to the bandstand where Jarrett's concert was and Dude takes a sick crash to the concrete floor. Within 10 minutes of the match, Vince McMahon makes his way to ringside and takes a seat to get a closer look at the action. Dude accidentally takes the referee out with a clothesline, which means something bad is going to happen. Dude and Austin fight to the outside where Austin counters an attack from Dude with the steel chair and then knocks Vince's lights out with it. The match heads back in the ring where Austin hits Dude with a Stunner and makes the pin for himself and his music starts to play. Moments later it's announced that Stone Cold is DQ'd for striking a WWF official and the winner via DQ is Dude Love. Unforgiven goes off the air with Vince McMahon being rolled away on a stretcher

Overall: The 1998 Unforgiven PPV was fairly put together, hot off the heels of one of the most successful and memorable Wrestlemanias in WWE history. Unforgiven was a PPV that defined what the Attitude Era was all about. Excitement, story-telling, entertainment, and unpredictability. It was a big night of firsts for this PPV as fans witnessed the first ever Evening Gown Match that would serve as a gateway for several other diva gimmick matches that would come over the course of the Attitude Era. We saw the first ever Inferno Match that hosted the continuing Undertaker vs Kane feud, and we saw Austin's first title defense with an unclean finish, meaning that the Dude Love/Stone Cold feud was far from over. The only match that really didn't deliver was the NWA Tag Team Championship match. Other than that, Unforgiven is a 5/5",1429228800,,10486,5.215092097445039

7880259,3,6304982305,"This was another event from the Attitude Era that I was able to check out recently with this particular one being Unforgiven. Stone Cold Steve Austin had just won his first WWF Championship at WrestleMania but by the following night was told to do things ""the easy way or the hard way"" with WWF Owner Vince McMahon. After Austin made his choice, it began a series of events that lead to a full-fledged feud between Austin & McMahon. On one particular night during the first official Austin/McMahon meeting, Mick Foley returned to his Dude Love character & proceeded to attack Austin much to the surprise of everyone else to get this title shot while McMahon also made it clear that he was going to be at ringside for this particular match (playing up the previous Survivor Series). Also, The Undertaker & Kane took their feud to the next level resorting to a first for the WWF, The Inferno match. One more thing, the night after WrestleMania Faarooq was kicked out of his organization as his fellow members turned on him with The Rock declaring himself as leader & ruler of the Nation while DX received a new change with Shawn Michaels being out of action, Triple H taking over as leader & bringing in new DX members in the New Age Outlaws & the returning X-Pac (WCW's Syxx/1-2-3 Kid).

Faarooq, Ken Shamrock & Steve Blackman vs The Nation. This particular group of the Nation was The Rock, D'lo Brown & Kama with Mark Henry at ringside. Each man had a score to settle with the Nation but none bigger than Faarooq whose intentions was to get even with The Rock. The Nation worked as a team by isolating Blackman for most of the match while Shamrock & Faarooq were working together but were trying to get even for their own agendas before one man got what he wanted in the end.

WWF European Champion Triple H vs Owen Hart. The rematch from WrestleMania but this time, the added stipulation was that Chyna was going to be suspended above the ring a steel cage. Without having to worry about Chyna, Owen was able to take the fight right to Triple H and even taunt Chyna on a few occassions. Triple H was able to regain control & even attempted to ground Owen on several occassions. However, this match took a unique turn of events as Chyna was able to do something that nobody thought was possible before it was another member of DX that ended up getting involved that finally caused Owen Hart to snap.

""New"" Midnight Express vs The Rock & Roll Express. Jim Cornette had brought back Bob Holly & Bart Gunn & renamed them the new Midnight Express while also turning on the Rock & Roll Express. The Express were past their prime at this point so this match wasn't really much past watchable with the only highlight being Cornette's interaction with the referee but overall, this was not even close to the quality of matches that the Express had with the ""real"" Midnight Express.

Evening Gown Match: Sable vs Luna. This was a first as this was a match in which the only way to win is to strip your opponent's evening gown off. Nothing much here past the usual T&A from this era.

WWF Tag Team Champions The New Age Outlaws vs L.O.D 2000. This was the climax to the months long feud between these two teams as the Outlaws had beaten, humliated & even at one point seemed to break up the LOD till WrestleMania where the LOD returned with a new look & manager in Sunny. Before the match, The Outlaws ran down North Carolina along with subtle lines towards the LOD. However, this match was similar to their previous matches in which they had a slow paced tag match but I will give credit in that Animal & Hawk put more effort into this match than they did in their previous match. The match itself was average but pay close attention to the finish as it didn't set well with the LOD that even had the referee suffer for his call.

Inferno Match: The Undertaker vs Kane. The first ever Inferno match & for those keeping track, this is the second meeting between these two but also the first of two Inferno matches between these two. Considering the limitations that this match had with the ring being surrounded by fire, these two went above & beyond the call of duty. They exchanged high impact moves such as chokeslams & even a suplex from the top rope with both men using a chair at one point along with one man returning who had his issues with Kane as well before Taker was able to get the revenge he had been seeking for months on not just Kane but also Paul Bearer. This was quite the spectacle to see with flames adding visuals but speaking of visuals, check out Taker's dive out of the ring over the flames to solidify that statement.

WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Dude Love. Austin's first title defense comes against a man that was once Austin's Tag Team Champion/Partner in Dude Love who jumped Austin right from the start & listen closely early to Jim Ross's shoot towards WCW in regards to Austin's career. Austin was able to turn the tide & take the brawl up the entrance way before both men battling on top of the concert stage with Dude taking a fall off the stage that you just knew had to hurt. Dude was able to regain control off one mistake from Austin before working over Austin's previous injured neck. The big story here was the appearance of Vince McMahon which raised speculation of a Montreal Revisit with even moments of Vince & the timekeeper (who Austin threatened earlier in the night) making eye contact at times while also getting into confrontations with Austin. This one got out of control once the referee went down, both men brawling around the ringside area, the front row, Austin suplexing Dude onto the steel steps before a chair got involved & McMahon ended up paying the price for getting involved one time too many. This was a prelude to their more famous match a month later at Over the Edge but this was still a very good main event that left you wanting more when it was done.

Overall, the only matches here that weren't much was the Express match & Evening Gown match (unless you just want to see women in bikinis) while the main events were good quality as well as others pushing the storylines which I think was at it's peak during this particular time of the Attitude Era. However with the main events already being released on DVD, I'd recommend seeing this if you can see it online or even a cheap price.",1377820800,,6360,4.486183074265976

Say what you want about scripted wrestling, the fire was AUTHENTIC! You could feel the heat from hundreds of feet away! But after the Owen Hart tragedy, I can see why this match will forever remain unique! Sable stole the show, and JR's implying of ""pause-rewind-pause"" was very prophetic! The main event properly maintained the momentum of the Ministry of Darkness/Corporation angle, but the backstory to all this is what is truly amazing. Once upon a time, the dark matches (covered in shows like ""Heat"", ""Velocity"", et. Al) were used to seriously promote storylines, as Vince was in a dark match before this PPV. This is unheard of in modern day. This DVD/VHS is truly worth owning if you are a true ""wrasslin'"" fan like me.",1342051200,,875,4.7254901960784315

The Evening Gown match between Luna Vachon & Sable was nothing more then a lousy try to get men to watch their shows. The Inferno match between Kane & The Undertaker was a scary,heart-stopping,nail-biting showstealer. The world title match between Steve Austin & Dude Love(Mick Foley) was great hard-hitting brawl ruined by a DQ ending. The rest were not great but pretty good. I give this PPV a 8 and a half out of 10.",1279670400,,647,4.684210526315789
7880263,3,6304982305,"To start off, the DVD production quality of this potentially amazing DVD release is very poor.  Mirroring the comments of other reviewers, I add my own assessment and confirm theirs---this DVD, released in 2002!!! as part of the ""Attitude"" collection, has no special features, no chapters, not even a main menu.  The only ""chapter"" is mid-way point in the DVD which features the end-point of the New Age Outlaws vs L.O.D. 2000 match, the rest you have to fast forward or rewind to as if they just ripped the VHS onto DVD and released it.

The matches, meanwhile, were a shining example of WWF at its greatest point in time.

Faarooq, Ken Shamrock, and Steve Blackman vs The Nation of Domination
This was a somewhat dull one, without much excitement attached to it from the crowd or the wrestlers.  It was something of a ""just there"" match just to further the story of Faarooq getting vengeance on The Rock and The Nation who betrayed him.  Steve Blackman was pretty much the only member of his team in the ring most of the time.  (4/10)

WWF European Championship
Triple H (C) vs Owen Hart
This match was something of a good one, without being a spectacle of wrestling or charisma.  The special stipulation of this had Chyna hanging in a small cage over the ring to prevent her interference, which she promptly broke out of and escaped after the Road Dogg lowered the cage via the controls in the back.  (7/10)

NWA World Tag Team Championship
The Midnight Express (with Jim Cornette) (C) vs The Rock & Roll Express
I sort of shudder and look upon the two WWF stars, Bart Gunn and ""Hardcore"" Bob Holly, seeing them with the ridiculous names of ""Bodacious Bart"" and ""Bombastic Bob"", and then I see these Rock & Roll Express people I've never heard of, and then I was surprised by a very good match, with even some entertainment as Jim Cornette got involved and challenged the referee to a fist fight!  (8/10)

Evening Gown Match
Sable vs Luna
One of those... you know... (1/10)

WWF Tag Team Championship
The New Age Outlaws (C) vs L.O.D. 2000
The Road Dogg is great with riling up the crowd, and the New Age Outlaws are a greatly charismatic group.  This match, while not the greatest, was a good one, with a very... confusing ending, which didn't really make sense until several minutes after with an explanation regarding camera angles and viewing and such.  (6/10)

Inferno Match
The Undertaker vs Kane (with Paul Bearer)
This sort of match is what the Attitude era is all about.  While the wrestling wasn't at its best, the action was nonstop, and the charisma and energy these two gave off was incredible.  The ring was surrounded by metal exhausts which kept the firing going, and with ever big bump taken or at random intervals, the gas was turned up and the flames jumped as high as a man!  The match got taken to the outside and to an amazing finish.  (9/10)

WWF Championship
Stone Cold Steve Austin (C) vs Dude Love
This match is a classic.  That's pretty much as much as can be said.  There wasn't too much wrestling or technical usage, but the energy and the action of these two was astounding, and this match is simply a classic because of it.  (10/10)

If it weren't for the shoddy DVD production quality, this would be a great release and I'd've encouraged further releases (before the WWE change)",1184457600,,3313,4.591836734693878
