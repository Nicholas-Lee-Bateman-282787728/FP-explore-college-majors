306363,5,6301035828,"I think any man can relate to Richard Pryor's Character.
They did excelent work with a shoestring budget here.",915667200,,110,4.842105263157895
306384,5,6301035828,"This movie has to be the most HYSTERICAL movie of its era.  This is Richard Pryor at his absolute peak.  You will laugh non-stop at the one-liners and facial expressions that are present through the entire flick.  A definite keeper, one for the ""classic"" comedy collection.  I highly recommend this movie.  You will not be disappointed.",1103673600,,336,4.928571428571429
306385,5,6301035828,"Richard Pryor, Randy Quiad, and Dana Carvey together, what more could you ask for.  This is by far one of the funniest movies ever made.  We play this VHS so much, that it is wearin'out. I am patiently,no desparately, waiting for the DVD to come out.",1098576000,6,250,4.413043478260869
306386,5,6301035828,"This is another well kept secret of movie greatness! Richard Pryor's character is wonderful as a typical corporate employee with society's so call ""job security"" I refer to this movie when I teach Homebuyer Education. I am A REALTOR and I know for a fact everything in this movie can and does happen. The movie takes a serious situation and make us laugh at life or our life. I have tried for 3 years to locate this movie,thanks for making it avaliable to me and others.",1098316800,,470,4.476744186046512
306387,5,6301035828,"In late 1988 or early 1989 I asked the video rental clerk if he knew of a movie that was really terrific that I may not have heard of before and he said ""Moving, with Richard Pryor, all our customers love it"". As soon as I watched this movie I decided to find a copy for sale and buy it so I could watch it every year from there on out.

  This movie isn't just funny folks, it transcends funny and enters the realm of hysterical. If you like any of the Vacation films you will love this one. And you will even see Randy Quaid again, only this time as the neighbor from hell that Arlo Pear and family are none too sorry to leave behind in New Jersey and also as his insane twin brother who happens to live next door to the new digs Arlo moves into in beautiful Boise Idaho, also from hell.

  Why this film isn't out on DVD is a mystery of the highest order and should be dealt with. I have been waiting for years for this to come out on disc. How Moving slipped through the cracks of wide scale release to theatres I have no idea, but don't make the mistake of letting this one slip through the cracks of home video.",1092700800,2,1117,4.031674208144796
306388,5,6301035828,"The Toy is a great movie from an all time legend Richard Pryor.
O.K. its not in the top ten of all time comedys and the first 15 minutes is a bit slow,but if you are like me and my family who go on the feel good factor instead of ""ACTORBILITY"" and all that crap then you will love this film.
A classic comedy with good values, what more can i say!",1087516800,,347,3.8333333333333335
306389,1,6301035828,"Why hasn't this great comedy been put onto DVD yet? Did the people converting movies from the reels pack up and leave, and this was one of the films that they said ""where taking it with us""?
Come on, this a 4 to 5 star comedy , when is coming out on DVD? Treat great comedys with respect. And this is certinly one of Richard Pryors best.... TO DVD, NOW",1084579200,,352,4.042857142857143
306390,4,6301035828,"There are so many great movies that have NOT been released to DVD and it boggles my mind. This movie, Moving, is hilarious. I remember laughing all the way through it and hope it comes to DVD soon.",1072828800,,197,4.2105263157894735
306391,3,6301035828,"Having seen this movie after numerous times, I find the film funny but not as side splitting as it could or should be considering Pryors talents. The script lets him down, however certain touches save the movie including Next door neighbour Mr Crawford played by Randy Quaid and the finale in which Pryor loses his cool after everything goes disastrously wrong for him. Worth a look at if your interested in this comic's career of films. Not sure about the character wearing a beard though.",1066348800,,490,4.776470588235294
306392,3,6301035828,"""A few years ago, I wrote a screenplay for a film called _Moving_, which, inexplicably, got made...""
That was how the author of this film described it in an article I once read, and it's pretty much all you need to know about it (he went on to tell how the director, as a joke, snuck his home phone number in on a sign shown in the background, resulting in hunderds of harassing phone calls when it came out on video).
Still, much like that old Star Trek theory about how if you go far enough to one side of the universe you pop out on the other side, there _is_ an art to stupidity. So, if you have a taste for such things (and a cold six-pack handy), this might just be your afternoon of chuckles.",1046476800,,699,4.109489051094891
306393,3,6301035828,"Richard Pryor did a great job in this movie! It was so funny and he sing like on Wizrd of oz ""there was no place like home"" He did a great job and I watch it over and over! I'm upset cuz they didn't make on DVD! I want them to make it on DVD's!
I gave them 3 star cuz they didn't make on DVD's! Please make it cuz I am Richard Pryor Fans! This is a good movie for making on DVD's.",1041379200,,380,3.5357142857142856
306414,5,6301035828,"Now, keep in mind, I'm giving ""moving"" 5 stars because it's just one of those movies you can watch when you're so bored you don't think anything in the world can make you unbored, this movie is just so genuinly entertaining in its own unique way.
Moving stars Pryor as an engineer who was fired and needs  to move from Jersey to Idaho for his new job. The troubles he goes through during this process are reminicent of the National Lampoon Vacation movies.
The first half of the movie most people won't find very amusing, just because the comedy seems really an aquired taste, those in tastes of something goofy and who like listening to Pryor complain, I find it hilarious. The second half of the film become really funny because of the movers Pryor hires to do the job are just such horrible workers and hearing Pryors compaints and seeing the looks on his face are just hysterical.
Overall, the movie is very cute and just plain old fashioned funny. It's an original idea that I haven't seen in any other movie. My only gripe is that I wish it would've been longer, maybe make the movers do other crazy stuff to Richard, he's just so funny to listen to.",1037664000,7,1156,4.478672985781991
306415,5,6301035828,Funny!  Ending was awesome.,1035417600,,27,5.75
306416,4,6301035828,"Richard Pryor, in my opinion a very funny man, stars in this outragous comedy! Even though every thing goes wrong with his character, Richard Pryor fitted in very well! I thought Pryor was wimpy but at the end when he snapped, it made me love this movie even more! Randy Quaid was hilarious! And a small cameo by Rodney Dangerfield was outstanding. As I say a good movie,I recommend that you buy this!",1006905600,,401,4.506849315068493
306417,1,6301035828,"Moving is one sad misrable comedy that fails at every turn.
Richard Pryor who in the past has been able to deliver great
comedy with rogue humor but is made to be a complete fool here a
Bill Cosby Type as a Engineer who gets fired from his job and
must plead with his family to make a fresh start in Idaho.
Laughter is the furthest thing from anyone's mind. This film
won't go down as one of Pryor's Classics.",1001116800,2,409,4.125
306418,5,6301035828,"Having experienced a variation of nearly every pitfall which Richard Pryor encounters during this hilarious film, I had tears in my eyes watching it happen to someone else.  A character not to be overlooked is Dana Carvey who brings even more laughs to this side-splitting cult classic.  Though this movie never made it in the ""main stream"", it remains one of my favorites and I suggest it to all of my friends.  It's difficult these days to find a film most have not seen.  They are surprised and delighted to find that this one shoud not have been overlooked.",988416000,,561,4.636363636363637
306419,1,6301035828,"And why wouldn't he? It's like he woke up in a bad Chevy Chase comedy, with Randy Quaid doing a slight variation on the Cousin Eddie shtick, no less. There's nothing more depressing than seeing one of the great comic minds of the century stripped of his livelihood. Please check out any of the concert films, ""Which Way Is Up"", ""Blue Collar"", and ""Jo Jo Dancer"" before you even think about wasting your time with this one. Hell, even ""Brewster's Millions""...
On the other hand, it's not QUITE as awful as ""Critical Condition.""",983750400,,526,4.666666666666667
306420,4,6301035828,Richard Pryor and Randy Quaid play against each other perfectly in this movie.  This movie may not be a great but definetely is entertaining and funny.  Give it a look.,976060800,,168,4.566666666666666
306421,5,6301035828,This is one of Richard Pryor's best movie's.  Too bad it's not available on DVD!,957657600,,80,4.333333333333333
306422,5,6301035828,"The first time I watched this, I almost coughed up blood. It's that funny. Randy Quaid as Frank the psycho neighbor from hell is great. The movers are riff-raff who, of course, know Frank from their prison days. Frank's  initial response to them is ""well choke my chicken, when did you guys  get out""? Together they make life hell for family man Pryor. It has so  many hilarious scenes like this. Dana Carvey is a warped, multi personality  psycho who drives Pryor further into insanity. I can't wait for the dvd to  come out.",954633600,,526,4.553191489361702
306423,5,6301035828,"This is richard Pryor's best movie since ""Stir Crazy.""This movie shows the funny side of moving out .With the furniture movers stealing their furniture,a physcopathic neighbor and much more. Nice part in the  beggining when Pryor is using offensive language behind the window. Very  funny movie fom start to end.",946857600,,312,5.22

7809063,5,6301035828,"I saw this on HBO several years ago and I laughed my a** off!!! Although this film came out around the time that Richard was first diagnosed with MS and his movie career was in trouble, it is still very enjoyable. It is highly recommended for anyone who is a fan of family-oriented comedies.",1374624000,,291,4.407407407407407
