The film lacks plots, sense, and good acting.

It begins where the last film left off: our three good friends are living on the top of the world in the ocean of cash under the protection of the respectable mafia man. Then we realize that one of the main characters is now played by a different actor. It is explained easily: he got a plastic surgery.

Then you start seeing advertisements of various products shamelessly pasted into the scenes: there is a big baloon floating in front of the apartment's window advertising ""Russian Radio"", then there is a big sign on TV for ""STS"" - a Russian enternainment channel, and a big bottle of beer on which the camera focuses for a few seconds.

In the sequel, the three friends lose the protection of the mafia and now they have to flee the city. They go to a remote city in a former Soviet republic. Their old ways of getting money don't work and there is almost no hope until one of the guys discovers a society of swingers that are planning a political scham that would take place during the summit of the big 8. We again meet Dolphin's character, who lives in a submarine, only now it's a spacecraft, and Dolphin is really an alien who can transform into other people. And of course there is a lot of cash that the swingers' society just happen to have (I think it was a main prize for the best coupling couple). Are you still following me? I didn't think so.

Watch the movie if you don't mind the absurdity and bad acting (it was dissapointing to see such a lower level of acting, especially for the replacement of the main characted). I would not recommend it.",1137974400,,1704,4.414012738853503
