2120676,5,B0002UUO8G,"This show is one of my favorites of all time, i hated the show when it first premiered, but by the second season it grew on me. I think the problem at the time was it was compared way to much to Matt Groeings other more popular show ""The Simpsons"". And thanx to FOX's schedualing department the show never really found a home, and as a result was cut short way to early. The thing was, this show never really had the chance to step out of ""The Simpsons"" shadow, thanx to Cartoon Network though, the show has proven itself in repeats, that it is a show that (as the reviewer before me stated) does not get old, and unlike alot of todays shows, really had some thought put into the wrighting and plots, and yes the show is a semi tribute to pop culture in general. Every now and then picking something specific to poke fun at, like...Star Trek, which is only one of many refrences. But the charachters are another plus with this show, there is someone for everyone, someone out there loves the industrialist Mom, who created all robots, and constantly slaps her 3 sons. Seriously, this show just gushes quality, and although a few episodes sucked, the rest of them are of a really high calibur and there are WAY more good episodes then bad.",1110412800,4,1238,4.4104803493449785
2120677,5,B0002UUO8G,"Furturama is definitly a classic that was cut short. This show is a staple for any Star Trek fan since it made lots of refrences to it. For example, Captain Branigan is definitly an exagerated Captain Kirk, and of course the classic episode featuring the original crew of the Enterprise. Not to mention this show has some of the best most memorable characters, who doesn't like Dr. Zoidberg? I also hope that one day this show like Family Guy, is resurected thanx to its fans. Until then the dvds and Cartoon Network will have to do. I highly recomend the DVD set, when your bored or have a little time to kill, you will always find yourself throwing in one of the disks and watching an episode.  Its amazing how this show just doesn't get old.",1110326400,3,744,4.470588235294118
2120678,5,B0002UUO8G,"Futurama is by far one of the best animated series of all time.  The series was cut short in my opinion and I have had hopes that DVD sales would indicate that there is enough interest to create new episodes as in the case of Family Guy.

Futurama kind of got a raw deal.  It was often preempted by Fox Sports and the time slot was changed around without advertising the fact.  These DVDs were extra special because making the entire collection available allowed me to see episodes I never got to watch.

The short life of the series may have served to boost its appeal.  It definitely went out with a bang instead of gradually getting worse each year.

All the stories are well written and the jokes tie in nicely.  Futurama seldom resorts to ""out of nowhere jokes"" that are common in other animated series.  The stories also do a good job of tying in together.  For example: the story about Nibbler pushing Fry's chair so that he can make it to the year 3000 in order to defeat the evil brains is supported by the very first episode.  If you look carefully in the first episode you can see Nibbler's shadow as Fry falls into the cryogenic tube.

A lot of the humor is aimed at people that grew up in the 80s.  That's probably why the series speaks to me.  Every time I watch the episodes I pick up on new jokes that I missed.",1110240000,2,1327,4.27710843373494
2120679,5,B0002UUO8G,"Futurama Volume 1-4

Futurama the Series

Simply put, one of the best series ever created.  There is so much detail put into the animation its amazing.  You could watch the episodes 100 times and still find new things every time you watch it.  Definitely ranks as top 3 in my all time best TV shows.  It's a shame it was cancelled.

Comparison

This is simply put one of the most amazing boxsets out there.  The colors and quality of the episodes are absolutely amazing.  Compared to other boxsets like The Simpsons, Family Guy, ATHF, etc; this boxset has some of the best extras and ""best bang for the buck"" value.

-one of the few DVD boxsets that actually allow you to pick scenes in the episodes (YES like movies!)

-TONS of extras, deleted scenes, etc etc.  worth the price JUST for the ridiculous amounts of extras.

-the boxset case is the absolute highest quality, best looking, and well done case I've ever seen or owned

Price

At first glance, the price may scare you off (I know it made me think for a few days), but I assure you that it is well worth it.

-first off, if you were to buy this at bestbuy or something, it would cost you roughly $200.  at $119, this is a STEAL.

-Unlike other TV boxsets that basically JUST give you the episodes, this boxset gives you TONS of extras.  It is well worth the price just to get all the extras.

-I would highly suggest you purchase it from amazon.  While shopping around; I check out ebay (~$150), bestbuy (~$200), and circuit city (~$180) and none were as low as amazon.",1109635200,5,1529,4.405017921146953
2120680,5,B0002UUO8G,"Among fans of prime-time cartoons 'Futurama' seems to get relatively little love.  I'm sure most people like it, but hardly anyone seems to declare it their favorite.  Well, it's my favorite.  Maybe if the Simpsons went of the air 5 years ago it would still hold the title, but I dunno.  'Futurama' did get better as the series went along, but it was brilliant right from the beginning, unlike 'The Simpsons' which took 2 years to really get going.  And, great though 'Family Guy' is, it wasn't as consistent, didn't have any heart, and was occasionally trying too hard.(Though the book isn't closed on 'Family Guy' yet, of course. I'd like to pretend that it isn't for 'The Simpsons', but it is. It just needs to go off the air.)

Futurama had it all.  A perfectly balanced center with the 3 main characters, a brilliant cast of secondary characters easily surpassing that of any show other that 'The Simpsons', a good variety of plots and the most appealing visual style of any of the shows of this sort.  The DVD's are great.  They do look very, very nice, the commentaries are consistently interesting and entertaining, and it comes with tons of excellent deleted scenes.  At less than 2 bucks an episode, this is an absolute bargain.  Too bad that Fox had to assassinate by giving it a time slot were it was pre-empted every damn week.

My 200th review. Wow.",1109289600,3,1363,4.633333333333334

Not only that, but it is a supremely, fantastic visual feast! The art direction is nonpareil...you could spend gobs of time pausing to look at everything the animators fit into so many frames. Futurama is also very cleverly written and performed. It works on so many levels. And if the show quality wasn't enough to warrant must-buy status, these sets are LOADED with goodies. The packaging is novel too, as the slim cases the dvds come in have illustrations on both the outside and inside. Great!",1105401600,7,636,4.738738738738738

2120683,5,B0002UUO8G,"This is my favorite modern cartoon - surpassing even the Simpsons.  I really did not appreciate it much when it was first on - in actuality, I never really saw a whole episode.  I saw the complete series for sale, so I bought it - and the rest is history.  In brief, Frye is a Pizza delivery man who accidentally locks himself in a cryochamber for 1000 years, awakening to a strange new world.  There are just SO MANY little jokes - Lela, the one eyed love interest whose original code name was ""1BDI"" (get it?) , little things like eating ""Admiral Crunch"", living in ""New New York"", a Rastafarian bureaucrat, Fry's senile great great great etc grand nephew, Professor Farnsworth, etc.  The most hysterical classic episode was the first x-mas episode, where an evil robot Santa changes the holiday in a unique warped way... one of the best lines of all television history must be, ""Your mistletoe is no match for my Tow Missile"".  HAH !  The Star Trek episode is also pretty amazing.  My 11 year old must have seen every episode 10 times by now...",1298160000,,1047,4.531914893617022

2120687,5,B0002UUO8G,"This box set is awesome! It has all the seasons aired at FOX from 1999 to 2003 before the cancellation. I was lucky to grab the seasons for less than $43 with the Amazon deal of the day, and it peaked to $50 with International shipping. This is great for the true Futurama fans out there.

[ FEATURES ]
It has a lot of features and extras, animatics, commentaries, 3d models, storyboards, deleted scenes and neat easter eggs. Audio in English, Spanish (Latin America[*1]) and French. Subtitles in English, Spanish and French.

  [*1] = The dubbing that is used in all Latin America but not in Spain, that has other dubbing actors.

[ COVERS ]
The seasons boxes are a little different than the original ones, because they use now slim dvd cases, making the seasons thinner. The cardboard cover of each season has the back with the description of the season glued permanently to the cover, so you can't see the original art of the back of each season. This is because the season covers have holes or are semi-transparent (Season 4) to match the internal holder of the individual DVD cases.

The individual cases are made of transparent plastic, and have the inlay info in the back of the cover, and they look very neat. The cover of each DVD disc has an scene, and when you release the disc you'll see the next scene that the disc was covering, many with funny situations!.

I believe that the DVD disc covers are also different, but I'm not sure because I've not owned the original seasons sets that appeared first

[ SHIPPING ]
About the shipping, the 1st package didn't arrive internationally to Quito, Ecuador. I waited 45 days and then contacted Amazon with my problem, and they kindly sent me another package, and this one arrived very quickly, so that's a plus for a international customer =). I've never received the original package, but Amazon said that if it appears, i should return it to them or donate it.

I think buying all the seasons is the best way to watch a serie because you don't miss even one episode and if you like it, is like a non-ending movie. Plus you don't have to find two hours in your day to see it. it only takes 25-40 minutes.
And on top of all this, Amazon makes some AMAZING ""Today's Deals"". I bought it (the 4 seasons) at $42.99!!

The humor is for Geek, Trekkies, Nerds and best for the Sci-Fi fans from the 1960s - 1990's.  It spoofs many of the ideologys from this eras science fiction from Cryogenics to Phasers.

A real must for trekkies, even has a little simpson humor in it (and celebrity voices).

I recommend!, and on sale I got each volume from Amazon lickety split for under $12!

2120696,5,B0002UUO8G,"Extremely enjoyable series; we'll watch four or five episodes at a time.  In some ways, Futurama exceeds the Simpsons' quality of humor.  Sometimes the comedy is dated (to things popular in the early 2000s) but everything relating to Fry and Leela's relationship and non-pop culture references is pure gold.  One of the discs' menus was screwed up with Dell's DVD player but we fixed it by using VLC Media Player.  On sale, this was close to the best $40 I ever spent.",1251590400,,468,4.670731707317073

Not only is it hilarious the first watch through, but they cram in so many little less obvious jokes that it stands up surprisingly well to re-watching.  Unlike some other popular animated comedies, Futurama manages to tell a cohesive story throughout the episode, rather than using a combination of non-sequiturs and repetition to simulate comedy.

2120700,5,B0002UUO8G,"Futurama is the sister animation project of Simpsons guru, Matt Groening. It tells the story of down on his luck pizza boy, Philip J. Fry who, after delivering a fake pizza order to a cryogenics lab on New Years Eve, he accidentally falls into one of the machines and is frozen for 1000 years. Waking up in the year 3000, Fry realises that everyone he ever knew is dead and from the looks of it, he couldn't be happier. Fry is approach by sexy Cyclops, Turanga Leela who tells him that now he's in the future he must be installed with his career chip which condemns him to being a delivery boy in the future for the rest of his life. He winds up working for his closes living relative, his nephew, Professor Huber J. Farnsworth at the Planet Express delivery company.

Fellow colleagues at planet express include the beer drinking, smoking cyborg, Bender Bending Rodriguez, the incompetent Dr. Zoidberg, the Jamaican bureaucrat Hermes Conrad and the rich and shallow Amy Wong. There is a massive ensemble cast much like the size of The Simpsons supporting cast, but what sets this apart from The Simpsons is that, Futurama's side characters are actually very interesting and hysterical in their own personal ways. Over the years, The Simpsons has started dying a death and is becoming less and less funny as the seasons progress. Futurama hasn't hid that peak yet and I suspect that they will continue to grow for many years, especially when they get a new 5th season.

The comedy of the show is broad and quite brave at times as each individual character well presented personality has the genuine ability to create episodes based solely around those individual characters. Zapp Brannigan is someone that comes to mind and is the James T. Kirk of the animated world with his pure arrogance and sex drive; he makes for purely impetuous giggles. This is also a show that has mastered the superb accomplishment of binding pure comedy with pure emotional drama. Although animated, Futurama has numerous episodes that present an emotional and dramatic ending that puts you on the verge of tears.

Some jokes featured within are very subtle, whilst others couldn't be more ""in your face"" humour if they tried. Each character's little quips can sometimes fly over your head and you only notice them when you re-watch the episodes. You also pick up on little things that go on in the background of a scene which just shows how much work the writers and designers are putting into making this show as good as it currently is. It's unfortunate that this shows original run is only 4 seasons long, but thanks to the newly released series of DVD movies, I can imagine a new run is imminent.

The show is a unique all-rounder in terms of both writing and animation. It contains the subtle and obvious comedy along with some emotional scenes to keep you engaged in what you're watching. The animation incorporates a lot of CGI along with traditional 2-D animation making it one of a kind for a show this popular. I would highly recommend this set to anyone who enjoys a good laugh and just likes to sit and be entertained for a couple of hours.",1241568000,,3131,4.6872727272727275
2120701,5,B0002UUO8G,"Futurama is a great cartoon comedy sitcom, that much like Family Guy was cancelled before its' time. Also like Family Guy it grew its fan base due to its nightly reruns on Adultswim. Unfortunately, unlike Family Guy the show was not brought back, although they did produce 4 feature length, straight to video movies instead.
This show was created by the maker's of the Simpsons and much of the humor is similar, but it does manage to have it's own flavor and in many ways is a better show. It takes place in the future and the Sci-Fi fantasy of it, allows for many varied storylines, and a large cast of both main and side characters. I really enjoyed this show, and it's a real shame they didn't keep it going or bring it back. All four volumes are good and feature some great episodes.
This set is the four individual seasons. The packaging is good and the extra's are too, including deleted scenes and commentaries. My favorite extra's are the character voices on each dvd, telling you things, like how slow you are picking a choice, etc.

One thing this show does similar to the simpsons is recognize the flaws in the setting of the show (space future) by poking fun at it.

The reason why some sights list Futurama is this:

Futurama ended as a series a few years back (completing 4 seasons).  A couple years ago, they decided to release a few movies straight to DVD.  As of now, 2 have been released and a third is set to come out soon.

There are plans to break these movies up into 'episodes,' and air them as Season 5.  They will most likely go to Comedy Central, and there is talk that extra material will be added in order to make it seem more like a TV show than watching a quarter of a movie.

However, I wouldn't count on seeing the re-release as episodes (especially if they add new material) anytime soon, as not all of the movies are even released yet.  So, all in all, this represents all of Futurama except for the movies - so just buy this and add the movies to your collection as they are released.",1221868800,3,870,4.2303030303030305

Go to your friendly neighborhood Walmart (among other retail outlets), and you can find each volume of Futurama priced at approximately $20. This series is not a rarity (in fact, I've got a good third of it on my DVR). Amazon was selling each volume for $18 a while back, which I'm assuming was to celebrate the release of Beast with a Billion Backs. That's about what each volume is worth. I wouldn't pay more than $24 for it. Trust me...it'll be around for a long, long time.

Some of the best television ever written are in those volumes, like the last episode of the series as well as emmy-award winning episodes.

I don't usually like to post a negative review of a series I love just because of an unplayable disc, but so far I have found three duds, disc 2 of Vol. 3 and discs 1 & 2 of Vol. 4.  Amazon's return period is well over (I savored Vol. 1 & 2 a little too slowly, it seems), and even if I could return them, I would have to return all four volumes just for problems with two (because I bought the complete series, which counts as one product).  The few dollars I saved buying all four at once does not make up for the hassle I have to deal with now.

Again, I love Futurama and I'm thrilled to have the series on DVD.  I just recommend not buying all four volumes at one time, lest you get stuck with unplayable discs and the hassle of trying to finagle a return somewhere other than Amazon.

UPDATE: I understand that people get upset when they see negative reviews of a series they like when the review is not concerned with the series itself.  As I said, it's not the route I would usually take.  However, I got stuck with a stupid situation for trying to save money by purchasing the entire series at once, and in the end spent much more than the initial savings trying to correct my problem.  My review was intended to help people avoid the situation I found myself in by pointing out the pitfalls of purchasing the complete series--in contrast with the safer alternative of buying each volume separately.  There's no need to take offense because of a single one-star review.  I used the one-star rating to draw attention to the situation for the benefit of others, not to somehow punish the series because of a couple of unplayable discs.",1200873600,11,1711,4.329153605015674

2120718,5,B0002UUO8G,"Futurama is one of my favorite shows of all time. I even go as far as to say that I like it better than The Simpsons or Family Guy. It's basically of a NYC pizza delivery boy named Philip J. Fry that gets frozen on the Midnight of December 31st 1999, and is revived in the year 3000. He meets Professor Hubert Fransworth, who turns out to be Fry's distant nephew, Leela, a one-eyed mutant who Fry develops a crush on, Bender, a foul-mouthed robot who becomes Fry's best friend, Amy, a self absorbed, rich brat, who ethnically is Chinese, but was born on Mars, Dr. John Zoidberg, a lobster like alien, and Hermes Conrad, a Jamaican Accountant. All of them work at Planet express, and recruit Phil as the delivery boy. Many of the situations involve spaceships, aliens, flying cars, mutants and robots, which are many of the things that people imagine the future will most likely have, and the plots are absolutely hilarious, especially when Bender (best character in the show) is involved. I always end up laughing  extremely hard. It's also fun to watch how Matt Groening depicts the future in NY (which is called New New York) in a satirical way. So Overall this show rocks. 5+ Stars",1182643200,31,1184,4.584905660377358
2120719,5,B0002UUO8G,"What can I say about futurama that hasn't been said before? This show is perfect in the line of humour and character growth that matt groeing and seth cohan did to their best. Sadly though, the demise of this TV show came from when too many people just couldn't catch onto the gold humour that was given in every episode. Was it the subtle Sci-fi comments? Was it the occasional metaphor that someone with beyond 10th grade education might understand? I don't know, but like most people, nerd and non nerd alike, was heartbroken to hear that it was taken off tv. Maybe in a few years people will turn around and appriciate what golden humour this show provided.

This boxset is the quintessential collection of all the futurama episodes sold in one seemingly special box for possible ""show-ponyship"" that might impress some people, or for that fact that ""iT cUlD b3 RaRe 1n A fEw yEaRz LOL"" and some people might buy it so they can sell it off for a slightly hefty price to other idiots that may pay for it.

But seriously, with all due respect to the show and what not, I cannot seemingly justify the price tag that comes along with this boxset.

If every season was bought seperate (at $24.99 as shown on amazon) you would pay

Seasons 1-4 (sold individually)= $99.96
Seasons 1-4 (Primative set not boxed up but still containing all seasons) = $106.76
This boxset: Starting from $212

Why??? Is the box made from kryptonite? Does it contain a signed melllvar picture? No. Its just packaged differently. And for those of you in america with primative dvd players, it might not play on your system cause its PAL.

Do the right thing: Buy the seasons seperatly and save yourself $100. If you honestly feel like the money is worth it, Let me know so you can spend the difference on me. This show is so worth it. But not at that price",1182211200,16,1831,4.516616314199395

2120722,5,B0002UUO8G,"From the brain of Matt Groening, creator of ""The Simpsons,"" and David X. Cohen (who also did time on ""The Simpsons""), comes ""Futurama."" Making it's debut in January of 1999 and capping off in the spring of 2003, the show was consistent from beginning to end. Unlike it's infamous big-brother in ""The Simpsons,"" ""Futurama"" had it's feet firmly on the ground from the start; from the animation to the character development, it seems as though everything that occurs throughout the four-season course of the series was planned from the beginning (and as you'll find out, in some instances, it's the truth). Unfortunately, despite it's abundance in both intelligence and heart, it met an untimely end. Much like ""Family Guy,"" which arrived at the same time, this show has thankfully found it's audience on DVD, and is also facing a resurrection in the near future. But for now, these four seasons are all we have.

""Futurama"" begins with the story of Philip J. Fry (Billy West), a lowly pizza-delivery boy in the 20th Century who is more than down on his luck. His job stinks, his girlfriend may or may not be cheating on him, and he apparently finds himself victim to phony pizza orders very often. However, his life changes on New Years 2000, when a delivery to I.C. Weiner lands him at a cryogenic lab. Due to a freak accident, he is trapped inside one of the cryo-chambers, where he remains for the next 1,000 years, only to awake to the bizarre inhabiatants of the year 3000, such as a one-eyed cyclops named Turanga Leela (Kathy Segal), and an alcoholic robot (John Di Maggio) who goes by the name Bender, not just for his hobby, but his job as well. Not too long after getting to know each other, the three come into contact with Professor Farnsworth, Fry's great, great, great, etc. nephew, and all earn jobs at his intergalactic delivery service, Planet Express. Throughout the series, the Planet Express crew, which also includes an asian Martian by the name of Amy, a sad-sack doctor-lobster named Dr. Zoidberg, and the rasta-bureaucrat, Hermes, travel throughout the galaxy, visiting bizarre planets and encountering weird creatures and getting themselves into plenty of tight situations.

What makes Futurama a notch above the competition, is that not only is it consistently funny, but if you are a sci-fi geek, there are thousands or references imbedded into each episode that go over the heads of most viewers (me). Despite the complexity and context of much of the humor, it never detracts from the overall experience. In other words, even if the extent of your sci-fi knowledge is limited to ""Star Wars,"" you'll still more than likely dig the show. Likewise, there is a major human element to the show that many other animated series such as ""South Park"" and ""Family Guy"" fail to bring to the table. Episodes such as ""The Sting,"" ""Parasites Lost,"" and ""The Devil's Hand Are Idle Playthings"" (the series finale) expand on Fry and Leela's growing relationship and give the series a sort of timeline and a sense of realism. Episodes about Bender, arguably the most interesting character, are in abundance as well. Episodes such as ""Godfellas,"" ""The 30% Iron Chef,"" ""Bendin' In The Wind,"" and ""Bend-Her"" are dedicated mainly to Bender B. Rodriguez and bring out some of the funniest moments of the series. Possibly the most emotional episodes, such as ""Jurassic Bark"" and ""Leela's Homeworld"" balance the equation, with episodes focused on Fry and Leela, respectively, and help build the characters beyond what most other animated series would bother doing. Overall, I can't say there is an episode worth missing. Sure, not every one is a winner, and if you aren't a Star Trek fan and can get through ""Where No Fan Has Gone Before"" more than once, you are a better person than me. From the first episode to the last, there is a certain continuity lacking in most other series, and I guarantee, by the time you reach the end, you will wanna start all over again from the beginning. As for the DVD's, they are definitely worth owning. Perfect picture quality and sound, combined with commentary on each and every episode from Groening, Cohen and various cast and crew members, make this a must for anyone who loves this show. Plus, there are deleted scenes galor and plenty of interesting animatics as well. It may be a huge blow to your wallet, but if you happened to surf over to this page just out of curiousity, it's probably best you just bare down and purchase each and every season of ""Futurama."" Personally, I bought each set as they were released, and I've seen all the episodes, countless times, but I can still pop in a disc on any given day and am still entertained. ""Futurama"" was, and still is, a cut above the rest.",1168300800,,4737,4.789731051344743
2120723,5,B0002UUO8G,"Right off the bat, I want to mention that Futurama often runs on the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, so you can catch a lot of episodes there.  But if you want to watch the entire series from start to finish and get some of the commentary, I highly recommend picking up all four sets, especially since prices have started to come down on each of the 4 seasons.

I personally think Futurama is funnier than the Simpsons or at least as funny as the Simpsons were in their prime.  The problem for Futurama is that many of its jokes are random and are infused with a basic layer of science/math humor, which is not altogether surprising given its science fiction setting.  Like the initial run of Family Guy, I think viewers did not buy into the randomness and certain inside-joke feel of Futurama.  But the more you watch and pay attention to the episodes, the better you'll pick up on the nuances.

In any case, the characters are flat out ridiculous and hilarious, Bender and Professor Farnsworth being my personal favorites.  I suspect that each character represents a portion of Matt Groening's own personality as they are all wildly different from each other.  Fry's basically your Homer-type for Futurama but I think Bender steals every episode with his wise-cracking.

Again, if you don't pay attention, you might miss the nuances behind each joke.  A lot of things might not even make sense, so I definitely think this series is not for everyone.  But if you like a little sci-fi humor born out of the same mold as the Simpsons, with some of the same randomness inherent to Family Guy, then check this out.  Whenever I'm having one of those bad or boring days, popping in Futurama and watching a few episodes quickly fixes the problem.",1157932800,5,1738,4.662295081967213

- the best commentaries ever.  I have listened to a lot of commentaries, and they usually ramble off into sex, politics, or quaint parenting stories about what the director's 6-year-old daughter did when she saw the rape scene.  The Futurama commentaries stay largely on-point, about where some bit of comedy originated, or what the real science is behind something in the episode, etc.  As a taste, they chose Omicron Perseii because it was 1,000 light years from here, and they needed the people there to be receiving TV transmissions from Earth that were 1,000 years old.  Even after I saw all the episodes, I still enjoyed re-watching some just for the commentaries.

2120733,5,B0002UUO8G,"What is there to say about Futurama that hasn't been said already?  It was an awesome show canceled before its time.  It ran for five on air seasons which was four production seasons which are how the DVD's were realeased.  However, maybe it was for the best.  The show never got stale and all the episodes are fresh.  There never came a time when you could say, ""Well, I've seen that before on Futurama.  Boring!"", unlike a certain show about a yellow family that's a good show but is pretty much run into the ground.

One of the best things about Futurama besides the engaging and (mostly) intelligent humor, colorful characters and original plots was the fact it was also a solid sci-fi show and carried some cool and complex ongoing story lines over the course of the series, most of which were tied up neatly by the end of the show's run.  Quite an accomplishment for a 30 minute cartoon show.  It had some story arcs and single plots worthy of Star Trek, except funny.

How and why did Fry really end up 1000 years in the future?  Who are Leela's real parents?, Why is Fry immune to the evil Brain Spawn?  Will bender ever have morals?  Will Fry ever get Leela?  I'm constantly amazed at how they wove these threads into the show and revealed them over time.  Time travel, supernovas, worm infested truck stop sandwiches, evil robot Santa, Globe Trotters from another planet, its all here.

One last note.  This DVD collection spoiled me.  EVERY EPISODE HAS A COMMENTARY!  Every last one.  Stack that up against Family Guy or King of the Hill were you're lucky to get 2 or 3 commentaries.  If you like the inside information you get in commentary tracks and the insight into the process of a cool show like this then this is the best DVD collection around.",1139356800,3,1762,4.512658227848101
2120734,5,B0002UUO8G,"Futurama was a superbly written show that suffered GREATLY at the hands of Fox's executives placing them in a terrible time slot - 7pm Sunday, I believe.  I can remember one season in particular where Futurama was constantly pre-empted for football on the East Coast, meaning viewers in this time zone got to see a grand total of about four episodes that year.  I believe this this cartoon would have thrived in a later slot, but I guess execs don't see things the way that a fan would.

Bafflingly enough, other Fox cartoons such as ""Family Guy"", which has been resurrected after multiple cancellations and ""King of the Hill"" which got relentless promotion, the dark horse ""Futurama"" received neither of those blessings.  Can you say 'sabotage?' That's okay, pronounciation doesn't count.

I'm off my soapbox...for now.

Fortunately, for fans, this show managed to hang on for four laugh-packed seasons and surprisingly enough it has also managed to have all episodes released on DVD.  Futurama maintained consistently funny writing, original characters and plotlines and may actually portray a fairly realistic vision of the future - where crack is sold in vending machines and advertisements are broadcast within your dreams.

Your main characters are all pitiful in their own way, but very likable.  There is Fry, who was cryogenically frozen for 1000 years and reawakened in a whole new civilization rife with aliens, robots and heads kept alive in jars.  Leela is an ""orphaned"" cyclops who in early episodes is basically on a quest to find her family and later on seems to be on a quest to find a man (other than Fry, who adores her).  And of course, you have Bender - an alcoholic, cigar-smoking, foul-mouthed robot, who probably spouts some of the funniest lines in the show.

If you enjoy originality and haven't already purchased any of the seasons of Futurama on DVD, then this box set is for you.  Or perhaps, like myself, you've lost some of your DVD collection, including your favorite animated shows, due to a messy divorce - plunk down the money and buy this set now.  And while you're at it, shoot off an e-mail to Fox and tell them to BRING BACK FUTURAMA - NOW!",1136160000,6,2179,4.82258064516129
2120735,5,B0002UUO8G,"Ah Futurama. I loved this show, I still love it. Futurama was pulled way before its prime. At least it didn't get old, crusty, and stale like The Simpsons. I enjoy every episode. Having seen them all I can't really think of an episode I didn't like.

I think what the 'problem' with Futurama was that it was ahead of it's time and the masses didn't flock to it like sheep the way they did with The Simpsons. The humor was more biting for one. When you have an alcoholic robot who laughs at everyone's misfortunes not everyone will appreciate the humor, no matter how funny it is.

A lot of people just didn't like the setting or it was a different future than what people wanted to see. I doubt people from the 17th through 20th centuries will continue to live as heads in water jars, but it was a comic effect. Leila's line ""We can't have a Robot Nixon terrorizing the Earth."" is a perfect example of this. Who can forget Nixon's head on a 100 foot robot smashing DC after winning the election?

To tell you the truth it was the characters that made the show. Fry, Bender, Leila were the three main stars of the show, but look at the supporting cast! Dr. Zoiberg was an awesome charactor, as was Amy and the Professor. Hermes even got a good line in every now and then. Even little charactors had a great impact. I would cheer every time Morbo would make an appearance on the news. Snuffy the Janitor who only spoke of himself in the third person made every second of his appearances count. The charactors were colorful, funny, and rememberable.

So to say I'm a Futurama fan is only the tip of the iceburg. This show should have continued. Take that American Dad off the air and put The Simpsons to rest. If Family Guy can be brought back (and thank God it was), then Futurama has a chance to be reserected to.",1132012800,6,1812,4.35207100591716

2120737,5,B0002UUO8G,"In my opinion, this is right up there with Family Guy for the best cartoon ever. It's not as funny as Family Guy--though Family Guy has to resort to tons of cutscenes and very unrealistic sequences (which make it hard to suspend disbelief and thus enjoy the show) at the expense of the plot. It's about as funny as The Simpsons I'd say.

Where the show really shines is it's plot. It's far and away the most interesting of its genre for several reasons: being in the distant future gives creative license to produce many 'neat' characters (e.g. aliens and mutants) and settings (e.g. the edge of the universe); also, it's managed to gravitate away from the old 2 parents-3 children-1 to 2 pets family-centric plot. Unlike Family Guy or South Park, it can be considered a good episode if you didn't laugh out loud several times--indeed, the show can legitimately take you through a range of emotions. I'm not trying to downplay anything, the show is quite funny; rather, I want to point out where the show shines brighter than any other in its genre: its ability to make episodes with awesome plots.",1128902400,3,1098,4.65979381443299
2120738,5,B0002UUO8G,"Its a crime that there haven't been anymore futurama episodes made, but at the same time i'm glad - the characters are well established (the main characters at least) and there aren't too many 'filler' episodes (inevitable in any cartoon, check out the simpsons or south park to see what i mean by filler). The humour is dry and very much in the same mould as The Simpsons (as you'd expect).

The more original characters (Zoidberg, Kif) are unfortunately not as funny as the Homer rip offs (Bender and Fry). But the different art direction, voices and superb animation set it apart - Futurama is a show that can hold its own. Being Australian, i have to admit some of the American cultural references went over my head - i'm afraid i just don't see whats so funny about Nixon being president of earth. In fact the weakest episodes of the series are those that contain guest appearances from uninteresting celebrities, such as Lucy Liu, Beck, and the cast of Star Trek. Its as though  everyones having a great time making the show, but it leaves the viewer wanting.

But i'll forgive them - particularly as i was so moved by Fry's desperate attempts to win Leela's heart in the fourth season. Buy it or steal it, make sure you have it.

2120740,5,B0002UUO8G,"Yea what can i say,i love futurama coz i love science fiction and humor, and i love good series, and this is an great serie so how can i not love it.

I like that Futurama shows more then only humor, there is emotional, fascinating stuff in it.

The only thing i find misplaced in a sci-fi cartoon or movie would be the sometimes medeivil stuff. But only sometimes, for the rest it's alot futuristic. Example Scruffy the janitor pulling on a rope to get the elevator up, this stuff should be replaced by some cool Sci-Fi style elevator.

All in all, these series r so great.

I own all 4 DVD boxes, and saw all episodes allllooooot of times, and still see them now and then.

I would recommend buying all DVD boxes, or at least 1 to try it out.",1123804800,,744,4.211267605633803
2120741,4,B0002UUO8G,"Consistently funny, with a scattering of sight gags (watch Bender for some of the best), and occasionally it even forces you to think a little instead of staring at in stand-by mode.  Not a show for people who don't appreciate irony (bad pun, Bender-yes I know).  The Simpsons has finally wound down and lost it's edge, but this show managed to keep up it's high quality until the end.",1122422400,,385,4.565217391304348
2120742,5,B0002UUO8G,"This is truly an amazing show. The writing is perfect full of laughs, pop culture references, and even references to little known science fiction show and books. The characters are perfect, bender being the best. The romance between fry and Leela is heartbreaking. The show also looks amazing seemlessly blending in 3d animation with 2d for spectacular effects. But enough about the show.

Aside from the show the special features on these sets are great. The deleted seens are great, the 3 and 4 sets have how to draw segments, but the commentaries are reason alone to buy this set. Even if you have seen every single episode i would recommend this set for the commentaries alone.  David Cohen is a lovable geek, Billy West (voice of Fry, Zoidberg and the Proffesor) and John Dimaggio (voice of Bender) are hilarious and so is the rest of the cast.

So in short BUY THESE DVDS",1117584000,14,877,4.681818181818182
2120743,5,B0002UUO8G,"I loooooved Futurama, and all the sets are great, so you know, if you were gonna buy them all anyway, you might as well buy them in this package.

Every Set has great features, each one including Deleted Scenes, and the Shows all look great(well it isn't old anyway so no one should expect any worse).  Some folks complain about there being no play all option, but ehh, It doesn't really bother me.

So anyway, I don't have a single bad thing to say about these sets, so if you like the series and were thinking about buying the DVD's, buy them, they're great.",1116028800,2,560,4.365384615384615
2120744,5,B0002UUO8G,"This is not a review, per se, though I highly recommend the set.  Rather, I just wanted to point out that you get 72 episodes (with a total of 74 commentaries!), not just 61, as amazon incorrectly states above.  [Note: amazon has subsequently corrected their listing.]",1113004800,31,268,4.804347826086956
2120745,5,B0002UUO8G,"I must admit that I did not begin watching ""Futurama"" until the summer of 2004 when my sister and I saw the shows airing on [adult swim] on the Cartoon Network. We soon became engulfed in the show and soon after became obsessed! ""Futurama"" is a brilliant show with fantastic characters, clever pop-culture references, unforgettable humor, and much much more! We LOVE ""Futurama"" so much that we immediately ran out to the store and bought all 4 seasons on DVD. My sister and I eat, sleep, drink, dream, breathe, and live ""Futurama."" We are constantly quoting lines from the show back and forth to each other, can not go even one day without watching an episode, and are even currently creating our own ""Futurama"" comic.

Like my sister and I, there are so many other new Futurama fans because of the airing of the old shows on [adult swim], and I thank Cartoon Network for that! Even though I own all 4 DVD sets, I still watch the episodes on Cartoon Network every night to keep the ratings up in the hopes that FOX will bring the show back on the air with new episodes! I, like so may other Futurama fans, am dying to see Fry and Leela finally get together! The last episode was so bittersweet and sad! I want to see what happens afterward with Leela and Fry's relationship. I have way too many favorite episodes to list, but I would have to say that I think the best episode is ""The Sting."" I cry every time I watch it, and I love how each progessive episode in the series (especially in Season 4) showed Fry and Leela growing closer and closer together.

In closing I leave with a plea to 20th Century FOX -- Please, please bring back ""Futurama""! It's such a wonderful show and not like any other out there. In the final words from Leela in the last episode, ""I want to see how it ends.""",1112140800,3,1789,4.385542168674699
2120746,5,B0002UUO8G,"I ordered and recieved this set two weeks ago, after viewing all of it i have to agree with the other reviews and give this one 5 stars. The show itself has been off the air for 2 years yet its repeats keep generating new fans as well as keeping the long time fans. As a reward, the creators jam packed the dvds with lots and lots of extras, heres the list.

61 episodes on 15 discs

Commentary on all episodes

Animatic, script, and storyboards for ""Space Pilot 3000""

Deleted scenes

Featurette

Animatics

Storyboards, character art, and ""how to draw"" galleries

Easter eggs

Futurama video game trailer

11 segments of 3-D models from rough drafts with narration

Two ""how to draw characters"" galleries of Bender and Professor Farnsworth

Still gallery and nine pencil test segments

 I was totally surprised with the amount of extras they squeezed into this set,  the deleted seens are a hoot, and there are tons of them! Each episode of the show has a comentary about it, every single episode! and they even squeezed in a few surprises in the easter eggs, i won't spoil it, but if your a fan of the show, you will really be pleased! There is way to much to put in the review plus i really don't want to spoil anything for anyone. Its a great show, with more extras then i've seen in a long time. If you decide to buy this set, YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY! Overall i actually give the Futurama DVD set a grade of A++! Rarely do we ever see a set with so much extra stuff, and $119 is actually pretty cheap for everything you get! TWO THUMBS WAY UP!",1110412800,3,1547,4.341463414634147
2120747,5,B0002UUO8G,"I bought this boxed set with my hard earned cash and it was

 worth every pennie. The show alone is fantastic, but these guys

 went the extra mile and seriously packed this set with tons of

 extras. If you weigh the entire package vs the price, the

 package will out weigh the price. In other words its a freakin

 bargain! They didn't have to put any extras in at all, but

 they did, and they kept adding and adding! These days when so

 many people who put out dvd sets over charge and give you

 virtually no extras, its nice to see that there are some

 people who care about thier shows and thier fans enough to do

 something special like this. This is truly one of THE BEST dvd

 sets i have ever bought and i highly recomend it.",1110412800,3,740,4.135714285714286
2120748,5,B0002UUO8G,"I'm compelled to write a review of the boxed set becuase i recieved it as a birthday gift from my family. I love Futurama for its inteligence and ability to poke fun at everything from our dependency on machines to tv classics like Star Trek and even Married...With Children, even The Simpsons gets slightly ripped on in an episode where a garbage comet is heading for earth and on it fry finds a pile of Bart Simpson dolls, the key being they were part of a pile of trash..Not only that but the characters keep getting mentioned in the reviews because they are what makes the show special. Bender a robot that needs to constantly drink booze in order to function, The profesor, a senial moody old man who can't remember anything yet remembers everything, Hermies the rasta burocrat that loves his paperwork and special cigars, Zack Branigan, a captain that looks and acts suspicously like Captain James T. Kirk. Thats only a few of the characters, there are so many more. But besides the show, the dvds also have some incredible extras which alone would cost a bundle, when you realize just exactly what you got with this boxed set the price will seem rather low, trust me, they packed in the extras here. Even though i got this as a gift and there for didn't pay a red cent for it, don't think my opinion doesn't count, because if i didn't get it as a gift i would have bought this on my own. Its that good, and i still haven't gone through all the extras yet, there are that many!",1110412800,2,1483,4.435897435897436

If you've seen Futurama, then you know it's good. If you haven't, you should! My s-i-l gets all the science jokes, and is kind enough to explain without going into detail that would confuse my fuzzy old brain. But you really don't have to be be a scientist to enjoy Futurama. I like it so much better than ""The Simpsons"", so if you're not a fan of the original from Groening, don't assume you won't like this one. The pithy jokes, and the amazing voice actor talent make it a pleasure.
And this was a bargain, too. You can see this show at places like Netflix, but I like having the DVDs handy...oh, did I forget to give these back???  ;-)",1318723200,,834,4.374193548387097
