558355,5,630309483X,"HAVING MANAGED A FITNESS CLUB FOR 20 YEARS, AND I HATED WORKING OUT AT THE GYM, OPTING TO WORK OUT AT HOME. I FOUND THIS TAPE AND THE SERIES OF FIRM TAPES TO BE BY FAR THE BEST TAPES FOR HOME FITNESS. THEY ARE EASY TO  FOLLOW, AND PROVIDE A COMPLETE  WELL ROUDED WORKOUT. I GAVE THIS PARTICULAR  TAPE TO A FRIEND TO TRY OUT AND NEVER GOT IT BACK, AND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE  TO FIND ONE IN THE STORES TO REPLACE IT. DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR YOU CAN'T BEAT  THESE TAPES, I WOULD RECOMEND A FINANCIAL INVESTMENT IN THESE OVER ANY  HEALTH CLUB ANY DAY.",947548800,11,538,4.028301886792453
558435,5,630309483X,"the first Firm videos are the best. I love this volume..great workout head to toe. Only draw back, cannot get it in DVD..times are changing and the videos are going by the way side. Have to keep replacing my videos with new ones!!!! Yes, I have been doing these for 25 years!! Started using them when my daughter was a baby and she is now 26!!! I am 58 and still get compliments......thanks to the FIRM!!!",1224806400,4,405,4.342105263157895
558436,5,630309483X,"I love this workout! IMHO, it is one of the best of the older Firm workouts that was made for several reasons; it utilized the interval format very well, working you to exhaustion in the cardio segments, and then recovery with heavier weights during the strength segments. Sandahl is excellent (not chessy, but humorous) and displays strength and grace, and her training in dance is inspiring. Also, it is a 65 min. video and works the body completely. If you only had to pick one Firm video, make it this one!",1221609600,2,510,4.615384615384615
558437,5,630309483X,"Get ready to burn some calories!!! Sandahl is one of the best firm instructors.  She's actually entertaining to watch and keeps you motivated throughout the workout.  This tape is tough!! So, if it's results you want....Don't look any further.  I have all most every vhs or dvd workout you can think of and if you don't have this one in your collection you are really missing out on a great workout.",1208908800,2,399,4.591549295774648
558438,5,630309483X,This video gets the job done. This is the 2nd Film video that I own. I bought my 1st over 12 years ago. It's the one with Susan Harris on the cover in a yellow leotard (great video as well). My recent firm purchase really satisfies my fitness needs. The moves are ever changing the repetitions aren't too long. The moves are also clean and graceful. You really get a work out when you're done. I was completely drenched in sweat at the end of the video.,1202688000,3,453,4.218390804597701
558439,5,630309483X,"Madre des Frijoles, this is a rough exercise program.  The other FIRM programs I have are terribly difficult, but this one seemed to go on forEVER.  Since I've been using the 5-Day Abs tape and the Tough Aerobics tape for years, I had an inkling as to how difficult this tape would be, but honestly, by the end of it I was praying for death.

They tell you at the beginning of their tapes not to use weights the first time.  How stupid am I? Very stupid.  If you are a 180-pound 22-year-old Army Private coming home from boot camp, DON'T USE WEIGHTS THE FIRST TIME.  It's that hard.

You can make this routine easy by not doing all the reps and using light weights or none at all, but it is still VERY LONG.  Keep going until the end though. Oo, the sense of accomplishment.

Sandahl Bergman appeared in ""Conan the Barbarian"", not a great film, yet I'm still a bit sentimental about her.  She does a fine job, but honestly, the woman is a work-horse.  I'm sure she's older and stringier, by now, but when she made this video she was prime real estate; and she forges through this very lengthy routine like a warm spoon through a pint of Blue Bell.

Did I mention this work-out video is long?

Yikes!  o_O",1182384000,16,1204,4.316964285714286
558440,5,630309483X,"Even though some of the moves in this video are outdated (although nothing like Vol. 1, where you do lat rows without bending your knees), it still gets the results.  I love the focus on the interval training, although by the time that's done, you're almost too tired to go on to the leg exercises.  Sandahl Bergman is rather good at cueing, and you can definitely tell she was a Fosse dancer.  I often enjoy the ""older"" FIRM videos because of the variety of the hostesses. You had dancers, gymnast/dancers (Janet Jones-Gretzky?), among others.

And yes, the tagline (I'm not sure if it's still being used), but you do see results even before you've used it 10 times.  It's definitely a good way to tighten and tone your body.",1181347200,2,726,4.596899224806202
558441,2,630309483X,"I own TONS of Firm Videos and DVDs ... I own everything The FIRM.  I love them!  B U T  I do not like this one.  The work out is good, but she's not very charming and so its not fun to do.  Janet Jones FIRM video or anything by Susan Harris are much better. Plus the workout from Jones or Harris are far better (which I know they didn't construct, but I'm using their names for definition).

So... I feel bad giving this one a bad review, but it is the one FIRM tape that I am willing to throw out.  2 friends of mine tried it and did not want to keep it, but they liked the others.

That's it. The instructor is disagreeable. I am glad others like her, because I'm sure she's a nice person. Her body is perfect, so that's a good sign that it works!",1172448000,,749,3.9139072847682117
558442,5,630309483X,"Along with volumes 1 and 2. This is yet another one of my favorites. I alternate this one with other firm workouts after doing this I have lost 80 pounds and feel great. This has the most aerobic minutes of the early Firm workouts because it is the first interval training one. I think this Interval training will appeal to the beginner because they take rest in between set with weight work. This is the first tape with the Fanny Lifter on it. They use the wooden stools,but you can a substitute of use the new blue and purple fanny lifter like I do. Nothing Has reshaped my lower body,like this has.

  Sandahl Bergman is one of the best instructers of the Firm series. She will get you through it. She is beautiful and tough and another one of my idols. This is truly another gem from the firm. If you can`t do this,than you obviously don`t want a body like Sandahl Bergman.",1150761600,2,877,4.368098159509202
558443,5,630309483X,"I am actually in the process of ordering this video as a back up.  It is without a doubt my favorite and I don't want to find myself without it in the near future.  I find it intense yet manageable.  it is a real work out without the annoying, unnecessaarily complicated step routines.  I would like to find more by this instructor.",1137369600,,332,4.306451612903226
558444,5,630309483X,"This workout is still the gold standard of video workouts.  Yes, it has a dated look and some of the hokey aspects of the early Firm workouts (e.g., the contrasting outfits, the silly introductory section, etc.), but it remains the most effective way to get into shape fast and stay toned all over.  Thanks to this and other Firm workouts, I've remained in great shape for over fourteen years and through two babies, and now am a size 4 -- even smaller than in college!  Not only will you look good, but you'll also be strong, feel tough, be able to carry small children around all day, and be ready for outdoor activities of all kinds.  You could get in great shape using this workout alone, but you might want to alternate this with the Super Cardio workout for extra cardio, since this workout uses aerobic intervals rather than a long aerobic section.

If you have problem knees like me, you need to be _very careful_ doing this workout, because it is chock-full of high-impact aerobics, squats, lunges, dips, and tall-box leg presses, and has an extensive section where you move around wearing ankle weights.  But I've found that this workout strengthens and stabilizes my knees and ankles so that my problems are diminished. Plus, all these exercises lift up your butt like nothing else.

Back in the early days of the Firm, they felt they needed dancers and actresses as lead instructors, for reasons that escape me.  Sandahl Bergman is by far the best of this bunch, as she has a real personality and gives good instruction on form.  Her encouraging remarks like ""let's get tough"" are helpful when you need them.

My only worry about this workout is that my videotape will someday wear out and I may not be able to get a replacement.  I'm seriously thinking of buying a back-up copy now.",1107216000,16,1795,4.64873417721519
558465,5,630309483X,"I love this video! I have all the Firm classics and most of the Firm Parts and this is probably the toughest of all except for Standing Legs. I just turned 50 and I put a pair of 10 year old jeans on last week--perfect fit. The ""table position"" floor work with 5lb ankle weights is still as tough as it was the first time I did it 11 years ago.",1105315200,3,344,3.859154929577465
558466,5,630309483X,"this video is one of the best that I have used. No doubt, it's challenging and really gives you a good kick in the [...]. Results come very quickly with this tape.",1099612800,,163,4.125
558467,5,630309483X,"I think this is the hardest tape I've ever done by far, and I own many Firm tapes.  Ms. Bergman is an excellent instructor because just when you are ready to give up, she gives you that extra ""get tough"", or ""power! control!"" that keeps me motivated.  This works your entire body into ""muscle exhaustion"" and you will see results in ten workouts or less.  Beginners may not like the format of the tape, but do NOT use weights at first.  Remember to do what you can and work up.  I started with either no weights, or two pound weights and am now up to ten pound hand weights and 2 and a half pound ankle weights.  The brilliance of the original Firm tapes is that they never can get boring.  Just add more weight!  Also, I found more results using this tape because it is interval training.  My heart rate never drops to normal in the hour long workout.  A great way to burn fat and lose weight.",1086912000,21,894,4.236686390532545
558468,5,630309483X,"I liked the video, but when I did it I hadn't exercised a lot before so it was pretty hard to do.  I was out of breathe, and even when your trying not to work too hard, it's pretty tough.  It's hard to do, but the video has a lot of variety which makes it less boring to do.  It does feel like you are working out, though.  This is what I call a hard day's workout.  On the days that you really want to kick your workout up a notch, this is the tape to do.  I can completely see how you can see results in the first ten workouts.  I bet you could even see results in half that time.  It's a tough workout, but if you don't mind working hard or putting extra effort into your day, this is the workout for you.",1066694400,9,708,3.8013698630136985
558469,5,630309483X,"I own the whole set of the old firm videos, and this one is my favorite.  The instructions are easy to follow, and I can build up to a higher level of fitness easily by increasing the weights.  One thing I would definitely change if I could is the music--although the tunes are interesting, a more ""aerobic"" type mix would be more motivating for me.  But I do go back to this video year after year, and feel great during and after my workout.",1053907200,3,442,4.238095238095238
558470,5,630309483X,"This is another oldie, but goodie! I really like the older Firm videos. The first four (the ones I have currently) are all challenging, with instructors that cue pretty good and are motivating. The music is nice...some find it very '80's, but I love it. It sounds like music, not just noise and it keeps the pace nicely. The promise of visible results in 10 workouts is true...if you do them several times a week and eat right you won't be disappointed!",1044489600,4,453,4.536585365853658
558471,5,630309483X,i just want to say that this video is the best workout  i ever tried. it really works. 5 stars for me.,1043280000,6,102,3.6363636363636362
558472,5,630309483X,"this was my first Firm video,and i can truely say that i'm hooked on The Firm! I used all different types,Kathy Smith,Billy Blanks,Cher,and others. I borrowed this video from a friend just looking for a change,when i read the ""lable see results in just 10 workouts"",I thought to myself i'm going to see if that is really true. AND IT WAS!!!...It's a great tape for everyone,but just a word of caution to beginners,learn proper form first before doing this tape,that is one thing the instructor does not really go over.
I Have odered 3 different Firm Videos and do not intend to stop here. I can proudly say I AM A FRIM BELIVER!!!...",1029283200,2,632,4.601769911504425
558473,5,630309483X,"I now own a lot of FIRM video's - and they're all great - but I chose this one to review because it was the first one I bought and I used it exclusively for months, until I bought a few more.
I bought this video because I gained a lot of weight in college - eating fast food for every meal can do that.  I was wearing a size 14 when I started using this video 2-3 times a week.  I don't cook, so I also sabotaged my efforts by still eating a lot of fast food.  Despite all the McDonald's I still went down to a size 8 very quickly.  Now I wear a 4 or 6, but that took a little longer.
The biggest drawback is the same thing that makes this video so great.  I lost weight quickly.  It can be expensive replacing clothes - even my rings became too big.  I also got stretch marks on my hips from losing weight too quickly.
The only FIRM videos I don't recommend are the FIRM BASICS.  They're for beginners.  If you are a beginner, I recommend saving your money and just take breaks as needed and add weights slowly using the TOTAL BODY workouts.",997920000,38,1042,3.995169082125604
558474,5,630309483X,"This is a great tape and my favorite of the Firm tapes I've used.  I've had this tape for 7 years and I use it regularly.  I tried Taebo last year and it doesn't hold a candle to the Firm tapes.  Aerobics + weights is the  only way to go!  After using the Firm, you'll never want to waste your time  using anything else.",953424000,7,320,3.921875

7837235,5,630309483X,"This is an old tape (from the 80s) but it is by no means outdated.  In fact it is one of the first workouts to use interval training (although they didn't call it that back then).  It is a mix of low and high (plyometric jumps) aerobics and  total body weight training. The work out is tough and some of the steps are a little tricky but it will definitely have you breaking a sweat.  Best off all, it really works!  They say you will see results after 10 workouts.  I used it for a month (5 days a week) and not only did I see a change in my body shape (I lost 6lbs).  I felt stronger and had more endurance.  I really enjoyed all the Firm Classic workouts.",1396051200,,658,4.007692307692308

7837238,5,630309483X,"Get ready to work your butt off... literally!  I love all the FIRM workout videos.  They are such a great set of tapes.  The only downside (if you can call it that) is that they use an aerobic step box & weights - for me this was not a big deal since I have the proper equipment, but wanted to give a heads-up.",1357344000,,310,3.888888888888889

7837240,5,630309483X,"So far I've loved every Firm workout I've done other than their yoga one, which I didn't like at all. I've done yoga for years and it just didn't work for me.

This one is excellent. I learned still more about how to handle dumbbells, how to build muscle and burn fat, and generally get a great workout.

I always modify the workouts so that I don't do jumping jacks or other high-impact moves. I dislike those and if I forced myself to do them, I wouldn't do the workout again. I just don't like the way they feel.

Other than that, I really enjoyed this video.",1308268800,,562,4.233644859813084
