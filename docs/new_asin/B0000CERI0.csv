7999161,2,B0000CERI0,"The DVD box makes you think this is a movie about Delta Force against ressurected ghost warriors.  In reality its about a bunch of overweight, out of shape ex-commandos running around with machine guns killing the same half a dozen stunt men over and over.  The 'Ancient Warriors' of the title appear in the last 30 seconds of the movie.  All they do is fade in, look mean and fade out again.  Don't even waste money renting this one.",1074384000,9,434,4.455696202531645
