8529814,3,B008QZ5U7Y,"I love this series, but the trouble with the DVD's poor loading on a Blu-ray player was a large distraction and quite aggravating when large chunks of the story were skipped and had to be reloaded.",1477267200,,197,4.5
8529815,5,B008QZ5U7Y,"Who doesn't love Airwolf. Season 4 is not worth buying so only stick with the real show, season one, two and three.",1447891200,,115,4.2727272727272725

8529818,5,B008QZ5U7Y,"This 80s TV show about a military helicopter operated by 2 civilians (Stringfellow Hawke played by Jan-Michael Vincent & Dominic Santini played by Ernest Borgnine,) while doing missions for The Firm while Archangel (Alex Cord) searches for Hawke's MIA brother St. John was a hit if for no other reason than the chopper. The addition of Caitlin O'Shaunessey 'Sweet Britches' (Jean Bruce Scott) was a nice touch.  The first 3 seasons were much better than Season 4 when some rather dramatic changes were made:  The season starts with Dom being killed in a helicopter explosion; String being fatally injured in the explosion and dies, Archangel ends up on assignment in the Far East and heaven only knows what happened to Caitlin.  The Firm becomes 'The Company,' and it becomes a race to see who finds Airwolf first.  Season opener introduces Dom's niece, Jo (Michele Scarabelli,) Hawke's brother, St. John (Barry Van Dyke,) Major Mike Rivers, a hot shot Air Force pilot (Geraint Wyn Davies,) and their contact at The Company, Jason Locke (Anthony Sherwood.)",1411603200,3,1056,5.051724137931035
8529819,5,B008QZ5U7Y,"if you like ""helicopters"" this was a great series..when this was made in the early 80's ... alot of it was ""Hollywood""..back then But now its all being used TODAY.''its a good part of history  . there is alot of older heilo's & mig's  ..very cool Air to Air combat scenes w/helicopters..what saves this series is the Vietnam War.this series still deals with POW's /Goverment cover ups and try'n to do the rite thing .. Im just say'n its not all typical TV 80's explosions/no one dies & the good guys win at the end..They go into rotor failure ..didn't get there ""in time""..etc..etc.. from what i know the series cost too much to keep going..I have a private helicopter license ..So here it goes per the spec's on AIRWOLF,,when it goes Mach 1 or he loop's a target the main rotor disengage's and the twin turbines take over..Hopefully this helps with watching the series.........",1408233600,,878,4.658064516129032
