4392277,5,B004K4FUES,My 8year old and 4 year old love this book. They both know their states now! It's been a great starting place to learn about the states.,1370563200,3,136,4.074074074074074
4392278,5,B004K4FUES,"I first saw the Do Unto Otters on PBS and it was the cutest and visually stimulating kids show, my son (16 months) loved it so I thought I would check it out. And I was surprised to find there was a book series and this collection of cute videos. Definitely worth the money! I think I will be buying the books too!",1342742400,7,314,4.0
4392279,5,B004K4FUES,"This video was so much fun! I am amazed at just how well it was. Of course the Scrambled States book was good on its own, but this video really brought it to life. On the video is Scrambled States of America, The Scrambled States Talent Show, Do Unto Otters, and Open Wide Tooth School Inside. There is also some bonus footage including an interview with Laurie Keller (the author of all four books).

My kids love this video and even asked my to purchase the two books we didn't have already (Do Unto Otters and Open Wide). They have watched it many times and I am not even tired of it yet. Even if you don't yet have any of the books, the video will still be a hit with kids (I would say the 10 and under crowd) - but they will really enjoy it if they already have some of the books.

Definitely a fan of Laurie Keller!",1337472000,11,821,4.093167701863354

4392303,4,B004K4FUES,"My autistic daughter loves this, but was disappointed that the characters pronounced Nevada, ""Nev-AWD-ah"". Here in Utah, we pronounce it ""Nev-ADD-ah"". But she did like how they brought the stories to life! She usually only watches the states ones, but the other books brought to life were okay to her. Next time, pronounce Nevada the way locals do.",1416528000,2,348,5.017241379310345

My favorites are Laurie's 1st book, her predecessor, and Open Wide: Tooth School Inside! Do Unto Otters was an ok story.
