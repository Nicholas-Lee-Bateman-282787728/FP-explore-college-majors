7864599,5,630417666X,"I watched this doco back in 1984 on the Australian Broadcasting Channel (ABC) and it started my interest in this genre. I have been trying to find this again after 20 years.
Excellent doco detailing from the start of the early influx of Italians up to the present day (1984). Presented well, with excellent photos and TV footage. Also the interviews with Jimmy the Weasel, Joey Cantalupo and Ray Ferrito gives a rare insight of how the minds of these guys work. They discuss murder with such an air of innocence, it is frightening.
My only disappoint is that the doco being made in 1984, ends in 1984. I would love to see another series of this calibre made detailing what happened from 1985 to the present day.
For those who dislike videos in the day of the DVD, I was about to buy this set from Amazon, but I actually found it in Melbourne on DVD (2 discs, instead of seven tapes) and it was only $30 Australian.",1083715200,,914,4.414201183431953
7864600,5,630417666X,"Absolutely, compelling (and often bloody) documentary over 7 hour long chapters that accurately covers the incredible true story of the birth and rise of the American Mafia.
This intelligent and well narrated series made in 1984 by English Thames Television covers the early influx of the Italian gangsters into New York, the Castellamarese wars, prohibition & bootlegging, the birth of Las Vegas, the mobs troubles in Cleveland, extortion in the Miami dockyards and several other key stories within the expansion of the national crime syndicate.....
The makers behind this series have unearthed excellent newsreel footage and newspaper photographs covering many notorious gangsters from the early part of the twentieth century such as Lucky Luciano, Big Jim Colisomo, Louis Lepke Buchalter, Johnny Torrio and Bugsy Siegel. Added to this extensive coverage of now extinct (!) gangsters are face to face interviews with modern day villains including ex-Los Angelas crime boss and noted hitman, Jimmy ""The Weasel"" Fratianno, and the refined and smooth talking Ray Ferrito...the hitman who blew up Irishman Danny Greene, solving the mob's problems in Cleveland.
There are additionally intriguing interviews with top notch retired FBI agent, Bill Roemer, talking about his run ins with hot headed Chicago crime boss, Sam Giancana. Plus discussions with photographer Tony Bernardi, the man who took the famous photo's of the carnage of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre !!
Definitely not a documentary for the faint hearted with some rather grisly images of deceased gangsters and accompanying news footage...and plenty of gallows humour from interviews with newspaperman, police officers, federal prosecutors and criminals alike.... If you are an afficiando of the history of the US Mafia...then this gripping series should definitely occupy a place in your video collection !!",983059200,10,1872,5.548951048951049
