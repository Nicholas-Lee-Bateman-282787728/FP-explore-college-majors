8545484,5,B000LXGV2W,"As Superman triumphantly returns,  there is another superhero about

to blast off on-screen! Yes, Superman's hilarious alter ego,

STUPIDMAN, in a parody of the legendary hero's comic book, TV

and big-screen adventures!

From Los Angeles-based independent filmmaker Jim Polivka (Last

Man Out), STUPIDMAN ambitiously traces Stupidman's beginnings

from his dramatic escape off the doomed planet Crapton to his

arrival on Earth where as Kent Clark, his unusual talents are soon

exploited by his cash-strapped new parents. He eventually gets a job

at the curiously outdated Evening Moon newspaper where he is easily

misled by the frustrated, career-driven reporter Lotus Lam and her

geeky, sexually ambiguous sidekick, Jamie Oldstone. When

insane/evil environmentalist Lax A. Tiv has his bumbling stooges

Nipps LeTrog and Clyde Pigsqueal kidnap Managing Editor Barry

Black, Clark's rescue attempt is delayed by his elaborate costume

change and a flirtatious flight with Lotus Lam. Can the stupidest

man on the planet save the most hard-boiled editor in

Megalopolis...and how long can he possibly protect his secret

identity?

Full of antiquated special effects, lots of B-grade action and tongue-in-

cheek film and cultural references, STUPIDMAN is a refreshing

breath of fresh air!

Featuring a wonderful performance by veteran comedic actress Karen Knotts as the villianous Nipps LeTrog.  In her new one-woman live stage show Tied Up In Knotts, Karen shares stories of her life, loves, a nervous breakdown and growing up with her famous father, Don Knotts, all in the name of comedy.
