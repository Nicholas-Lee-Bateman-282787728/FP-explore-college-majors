2910528,5,B000TV1SSS,"Wow! Route 66 on DVD. Finally, we get to cruise America with Tod (Martin Milner) and Buzz (George Marahis).

What can I say to convince you it's a `60s B&W series worth watching? Well, the vette is one thing, but it never overshadows the stories. Despite all the adventure, travelogue, drama and poetry this duo gets into, the real subject of the series was the human condition. Tod and Buz acted as observers and mentors to broken-down prizefighters and rodeo clowns, sadists and iron-willed matrons, surfers and heiresses, runaway kids and people from all walks of life, forced by circumstances to confront their demons.

While we may only get Route 66 Season 1 in Volumes 1 and 2 as some reviewers have indicated, this is what we have to look forward to in the first year (October 1960 to June 1961):

Episode 1 -- ""Black November"" -- Car trouble strands Tod and Buz in a small town with a terrible secret.

Episode 2 -- ""A Lance of Straw"" -- Tod and Buz sign on to crew a shrimp boat, despite the objections of the female captain's boyfriend.

Episode 7 -- ""Three Sides"" (aka Three Sides of a Coin) -- Tod and Buz get involved in family strife while working for an Oregon hop farmer.

Episode 8 -- ""Legacy for Lucia"" -- While working at a logging camp, Tod and Buz meet a girl from Italy, who insists she has inherited the state of Oregon from a local man.

Episode 9 -- ""Layout at Glen Canyon"" -- Tod and Buz act as bodyguards to fashion models at the Glen Canyon Dam construction site.

Episode 10 -- ""The Beryllium Eater"" -- Tod and Buz help an old prospector stake his claim after he finds beryllium ore.

Episode 11 -- ""A Fury Slinging Flame"" -- Tod and Buz meet a scientist (Leslie Nielsen) who intends to hide in Carlsbad Caverns with friends until an expected nuclear holocaust is over.

Episode 12 -- ""Sheba"" -- Tod and Buz work as cowboys for Woody Biggs (Lee Marvin), who isn't done with the woman he sent to prison.

Episode 13 -- ""The Quick and the Dead"" -- Tod becomes a race car driver as he and Buz get involved in a family controversy over whether an aging driver should retire.

Episode 14 -- ""Play It Glissando"" --Tod and Buz try to protect a woman from her jazz musician husband.

Episode 15 -- ""The Clover Throne"" -- Tod and Buz work for a date farmer (Jack Warden) who fights the highway department while he ""waits out"" his sexy ward, hoping she will marry him.

Episode 23 -- ""Most Vanquished, Most Victorious"" -- At the request of his aunt, Tod traces the life of his saintly cousin through the Los Angeles slums.

Episode 24 -- ""Don't Count Stars"" -- Tod and Buz get involved in a custody case over a 9-year-old heiress and her drunken, gambling ""uncle.""

Episode 25 -- ""The Newborn"" -- Tod and Buz protect a Native American girl and her newborn from their employer, who rules the land like a feudal baron.

Episode 26 -- ""A Skill for Hunting"" -- Tod and Buz are framed as poachers after Tod interferes with a real poacher's hunting.

So, c'mon. Hitch a ride and relive these nostalgic vignettes of America and Americans. It's a great trip!

POST-SCRIPT (31 Oct. 2007):
I concur with subsequent reviewers, regarding the audio-video transfer quality to this DVD set. It could be better. Although the video is too dark, the brightness and contrast can be adjusted from your system. Audio varies from episode to episode, and I would have thought with today's technology this could have been improved. It is a pity because the packaging of this boxed set is well done. The menu of episodes, commercials and bio-film background are nice touches to a great, great series. Does this mean I regret buying this DVD set? Not one iota, considering its the best thing out there at the moment.",1186272000,83,5624,4.40715667311412
2910529,5,B000TV1SSS,"UPDATE: The quality on some of the episodes lacks the quality of Season 1 Part 2 which is excellent except for the widescreen formatting they used. You can tell when they used original films versus washed out and barely audible video tapes in Season 1 Vol 1. Just keep that in mind. At least it is in 4:3 format.

Finally someone is listening! First the Fugitive and now Route 66! Television with meaning. I guess it was well worth the wait for the studios to get all the crap out of their system so they could start releasing the real quintessential jewels of American television.
This show was so innovative for its time - It was shot on location around the country. The entire cast and crew literally travelled from one spot to the next and filmed each episode. This would be so cost prohibitive today,  and a show like this would probably be cancelled after one episode anyway with today's TV execs - especially that one at the CW!

Anyway, this is a legitimate, proper Season release (granted it is in two parts) of my all time absolute favorite television show ever!
It is released by the same people who did the 11 episodes disc, which had great video quality, kept all of the bumpers, commercials and previews for the next week intact. You couldn't ask for more. If they release all  seasons of this great series, I swear I will never watch current television again. THIS SHOW IS WHERE IT'S AT CATS!",1184889600,39,1407,4.52755905511811
2910530,5,B000TV1SSS,"This is one of the best-written anthology shows ever to appear on television (thank you, Stirling Silliphant). Let's hope Roxbury responds to the fan's reaction of this set and does the presentation right by better remastering future volumes and adding interviews with Martin Milner (Tod) and George Maharis (Buz), both still alive and kicking.

Buz and Tod tooled around in a (60'-64') Corvette leading us into the lives of locals all over the country. The show was actually shot on location on the road, as opposed to Fox TV's recent road series disaster, ""Drive"" (shot on one bad patch of road in So. Cal. subbing for Florida and Georgia!) Episodes focused on boozy broads married to domineering husbands, tormented artists (Jack Lord channeling Chet Baker), and kooky kittens (purr, Julie Newmar, purr).

I ran into George Maharis at a restaurant in Santa Monica a while back when Nick At Night was replaying the series, and just had to go over and congratulate him on the show. He beamed like a proud peacock, wearing a blue blazer, neck scarf, and a wig that still matched his Buz-do. I said, ""You must have been on top of the world at 25 in your own series having adventures all over America."" He was, and he had some great stories to tell behind the scenes.

Let's hope some of them end up on a future volume of this series on DVD.

2910531,5,B000TV1SSS,"Loved the series,watching ""Effigy In Snow"".Worth the price of admission to see big George Macready in snow gear and on skis,not playing an uber villain for a change,Scott Marlowe,another favorite did that as his son.

2910534,4,B000TV1SSS,"This was a very pleasant surprise. I bought it as a bargain book and found a good story, well written. I liked the writer's style so much that I bought his other books as well. If I may quote ""A chocolate milkshake, eaten with a spoon, accounted for 50% of the cost and 75% of the satisfaction"". In a world where books are rarely even spell-checked, that's good writing.",1482192000,,370,4.3768115942028984
2910535,4,B000TV1SSS,"I didn't realize I bought this, I thought I just watched it free over the internet.
It was the same movie I watched as a young child but as an older adult I see things I never noticed as a child, like they are young guys and not older men for example. The story line I think is more for a younger person but older ones can enjoy it too.",1481328000,,336,3.8142857142857145
2910536,4,B000TV1SSS,"I was in 3rd grade when this series aired. Didn't know anything about the ""On the road"" movement at the time. Now in my 60's with dim memories of the actual highway, my big brothers 63 Vette and Henry Mancini's theme song it's interesting to look back at this period through older eyes. One thing hasn't changed since I was in 3rd grade. The Vette is still eye candy to my soul. I like the series just for nostalgia.",1481328000,2,416,4.2784810126582276

2910547,5,B000TV1SSS,"As a young man and now as an older man, I can never remember a time when I didn't want a sports car with knock off hubs and a luggage rack on the trunk. My first car was a 1963 TR-4 with knock off hubs and one of the first things I did was put on the luggage rack; my current car is a 1995 Miata and one of the first things I did was get my luggage rack, though knock off hubs were not available.
I often wondered where this set of desires came from...and then, just recently, I was watching a CNN documentary about the 60's and, lo and behold, there was the 'Vette with the knock off hubs and the luggage rack....epiphany, it was Buzz and Todd who birthed in me  this lifelong dream.
I recalled how much I loved this series when it was on the box, my brother and I were religious about watching every episode...so I decided to watch a couple of episodes on Prime and they simply floored me!
Not only were Buzz and Todd the perfect anti heroes, motoring from place to place, landing the coolest jobs, meeting the grooviest chicks and righting the worst wrongs, the supporting cast was a who's who of character actors: Everett Sloane, Inger Stevens, John Larch, Ed Asner, Bruce Dern, Leslie Nielsen...and the list goes on and on.
The plots were imaginative and meaningful, stories you could get your teeth into...little individual passion plays full of wonder and angst...amazing.
I'll never regret buying the whole series on DVD; though some seem to complain about the quality of the audio and video, I found them totally acceptable.
I look forward to hours and hours of fun and nostalgia; thank you for making this seminal series available.
Thanks also for the knock off hubs and the luggage rack.",1462492800,4,1698,4.47741935483871

2910550,5,B000TV1SSS,I loved watching Route 66 and to be able to see the show on my kindle is great.  I liked this show about the motherless child.

Kind of a dissapointment yet still some good episodes in the package. I've had a problem recently ordering packages on tv series finding all of the episodes that are supposed to be included. I guess that I'll have to request a list of episodes and only purchase after I am satisfied that I'll get exactly what I'm looking for.",1423526400,,694,4.4296875
2910568,3,B000TV1SSS,"I remembered this show on television, it was a good show then and now.  It may be interesting to some because it is a part of American History. The DVDs show episodes of the American Road as it was in the 1960s, which makes these videos interesting. Unfortunately, I bought it because I am a Route 66 roadie or maybe you would call me a Route 66 fanatic. These DVDs do not have anything to do with Route 66, the famous highway.",1422057600,,427,4.2073170731707314

2910573,5,B000TV1SSS,"Another great season of television drama.  I was deeply affected by three of the episodes in this season.  The first was ""Most Vanquished, Most Victorious"", in which Tod and Buz carry out a woman's last wish.  ""Welcome to Amity"" guest starred Susan Oliver as an estranged daughter needing the assistance of both men in order to honor her mother.  ""Incident on a bridge"" is a poignant and unusual love story I'm very glad I've had the opportunity to watch.  There are many other episodes in this season that are well worth your time to view.  Again,  highly recommended viewing for those of you who enjoy great drama.",1414454400,,616,4.700934579439252

2910576,5,B000TV1SSS,"I have just finished watching the entire First Season of the old CBS series ""Route 66 and despite what many reviewers have stated the prints look beautiful and amazing especially for a show that is over 50 years old! What can people expect from a studio that has never once touched the original prints in decades? Sure there will be lines and jumps to some scenes, but to me this only adds to the nuance of a fabulous series.

 The series is pretty simple: it focuses on two young men (played by Martin Milner and hunky and former Playgirl model George Maharis) on a cross country journey in a beautiful Chevrolet. The series was really in touch with reality in the early 1960's when it originally ran (from 1961-1962) as it dealt with the young and restless youth of America trying to find themselves.

 ""Route 66"" is extremely well-written and excitedly directed. The guest-stars of the first year include Suzanne Pleshette, George Kennedy, and many more.

 A total of 30 shows were shot totally on location at various places around the United States making ""Route 66"" one of the few network prime time shows to be shot entirely on location.",1410912000,5,1143,4.69

Shout Factory basically repackaged the Roxbury/Infinity series which includes a few syndicated episodes that have dark video or muddy audio or both, but for a 50 + year old show most of the episodes are in excellent shape and look good even on HD TV's. This is a well written, well acted series that you will want to binge watch once you figure out what it's about.",1408838400,12,594,4.4495412844036695
2910579,5,B000TV1SSS,"At the time this was my favorite TV show. Every series is hard hitting character review and a look at America in the past.

2910585,5,B000TV1SSS,"Besides A few episodes that use syndicated transfers which have pretty crappy audio tracks and some dark video, this set is really nice. From the first episode to the last you can see how Route 66 started to evolve and get its format down. Originally, the end credits rolled over a moving image, but after a few episodes that changed to a still image. Buzz and Todd's character's get tweaked and you get to know them as I think Martin Milner and George Maharis get to know them at the same time.

Originally Season 1 was released by Infinity/Roxbury in parts. The second part was released in an artificial widescreen format that cut off parts of the picture. This was corrected in the FULL Season 1 release (This item) and is also fixed with the Shout Factory release. Basically, Shout Factory bought the film elements that Infinity/Roxbury had and reissued them under their name. Whatever episodes were missing (which weren't that many), syndicated video transfers are used, which accounts for horrible audio and dark video. Where the film elements are used the video is very clear, and the audio much better, though not up to today's standards, but the TV standards of 50 years ago.

2910587,5,B000TV1SSS,"Producer Herbert T. Leonard and writer Stirling Silliphant captured America like a ship in a bottle...before the shine wore off in the late sixties, it's innocence and excitement were echoed in these stories. The CBS series had a traveling caravan of grip truckers, lighting vans, generators and trailers carrying two corvettes...as well as the PERSONEL and actors that comprised the compliment of talent that travelled the country, shooting two episodes in each city. The location work payed off giving us these toes that now can be enjoyed. Unfortunately, when I was working in restoration I asked the Columbia rep why this show had not been remastered for DVD and he checked and replied that due to legal entanglement this series was licensed out to Roxbury, then Shout! Video for external release. This meant the OCN or original camera negative was NOT released from Screen Gems vault for digital cleanup and remastering. Instead they provided the old one inch masters produced in the mid-eighties for NICK AT NITE to air, converted tem to digital dupes and used them for producing the DVD. unfortunate as Jack Marta's cinematography would be glorious if scanned in at 4K resolution!

2910589,4,B000TV1SSS,"I used to watch Route 66 as a young teenager. Every Saturday night I looked forward to the show coming on and every new year when Todd got a sparkling new Corvette!  The intro music by Nelson Riddle was great! All of the shows were made on site, not in a studio, and this added to the distinctive charm of the show.  The tension between the preppy Todd and the tough kid Buz brought different views to the situations they found themselves involved in during each episode. Many of the guest stars were well known or went on to have successful acting careers of their own. The Corvette convertible was of course the real star of the show. This was one of the first TV shows to be shot on site around the country, usually in a small rural town.  The show also taught morals and the work ethic as the guys were always looking for work as they traveled around the country and Canada as well.  George Maharis was my favorite partner for Martin Milner. It was a disaster to me when he had to leave the show due to illness, thus I favor the earlier shows with George starring in them. The show presents a snapshot of life in America in the early 60's when America was more self-sufficient and people lived a simpler and more moral lifestyle.

2910601,4,B000TV1SSS,"U.S. Highway 66 was fully decommissioned in 1985 and had been largely replaced by the Interstate Highway System well before that, but even today the phrase ""Route 66"" still strikes a chord in the American psyche--it symbolizes freedom, adventure, big skies and wide-open spaces, optimism, and maybe even new beginnings.  Route 66 was a state of mind as much as it was a ribbon of pavement.

For four seasons on CBS, the television show ""Route 66"" attempted to convey the spirit of the Mother Road, and this DVD set contains the first 15 episodes of the series that were originally aired from October 1960 to January 1961.  In the series, good friends Tod Stiles (Martin Milner) and Buz Murdock (George Maharis) traveled the country in a Corvette following the death of Tod's father.  They worked odd jobs and found danger, adventure, and romance in cities and towns they visited.

Viewers born well after the series ran will definitely notice differences between today's society and that of a half-century ago.  They will also wonder whether people in small towns then were really as suspicious and violent as portrayed in the show, or if those traits were greatly exaggerated for the sake of a TV drama.

All episodes were filmed on location--most of them actually took place in towns far from the actual highway, with some episodes even set in places like Louisiana and Oregon.  The scenery still looks very cool even in black-and-white, and the wide-open spaces of the West seemed even more wide open in the show given that the United States was much more sparsely populated then than now.

The series also had illustrious guest stars such as Jack Lord, and Nelson Riddle's theme song became a hit record.  Bonus features on this DVD set include television commercials from the early Sixties, and there is an informational feature about Corvettes from that era.  If you like travel and adventure shows or just good drama, you would enjoy this classic series.",1336176000,,1961,4.8942598187311175

2910604,5,B000TV1SSS,"This is a wonderful show.  I had heard about it for many years, but was far too young to watch it when it was first on.  The show didn't get rerun like other shows because it really didn't have appeal to children who mainly enjoy reruns.  The show isn't about space aliens or is filled with jokes.  Route 66 is about college age Northeastern men who have lived a privileged life.  They decide to travel through the country on Route 66 which travels East-West in the Southern part of the United States.  Working construction jobs, etc. and associating with more working class people, the men experience ""real"" America and learn more about their country.

Women abound, as well as conflicts, music, fistfights, and many other adventures on the road.

Each story runs around 50 or so minutes, which makes each one seem more like a mini movie than a typical TV show.

Very enjoyable!",1282348800,,574,4.287037037037037
2910606,5,B000TV1SSS,"I was a bit young to have watched this excellent drama series when it aired in 1960 ; but am glad it has been re-mastered and now available. Each episode follows Buzz and Tod to a new location, where they meet and become involved with local people. Difficult situations occur; but the pair are determined to help out, and somehow things are made better because of their efforts. That constant private struggle toward improvement was a natural part of their society.

The episodes were filmed on location, and it is facinaing to see what the country looked like at that time.  Some things are the same, such as buildings or houses, that could likely be viewed just as they were today.  So much though is different.  The amount of economic activity is astounding, as is the freedom in which the people operate.

As they travel about, they easily take jobs at seeminly endless manufacturing facilities. No labor laws keep them from taking or ending their employment at will. They, and their employers, enjoy freedom of association.  Those facilities efficiently directed the society's scarce capital into productive uses, causing prosperity, and a real hope of a better tomorrow for all honest people.  They also produced most of the goods purchased by people around the world.  Almost every product seen, in location after location, was made in America. Just being able to see these products, especially the fabulous American cars of that time, is reason enough to watch the series.

And the money, it was real.  One episode involves gambling in a Reno casino, where we witness that silver dollars were often then used as chips! What a sad testiment to our times that those honest dollars have been replaced by tokens made of cheap plastic or base metal.

As we witness the present decline our living standards, and social disintrigation, brought about by the financial bankrupcy of out nation by the politicians, the mis-direction of of our scarce capital into consumption, rather than productive investment, and the substitution of our once honest money by fiat paper, we would do well to look back at our world from 1960 -1963, and re-kindle it.",1279497600,12,2146,4.916897506925208

2910610,5,B000TV1SSS,"Route 66 centered on two young men, who traveled together in a sleek Corvette. The car was bequeathed to one of the main characters, named Tod, by his dead father. His traveling companion was named Buzz. Tod and Buzz were actually polar opposites. Tod came from an affluent background, and had an education that he'd acquired from Harvard. On the other hand, Buzz was a street-wise young tough, who grew up in the urban jungle of 'hell's kitchen', in NYC.

Tod and Buzz were seeking adventure during their travels, and they often got more than they bargained for. As they made their way from town to town, they frequently got into some serious skirmishes, that they were barely able to escape. They also got to assist many of the people that they met, in one way or another. In this way, the show resembled the story-line of the Fugitive, which was also an enormously popular 60s drama series.

George Maharis as Buzz, and Martin Milner as Tod, projected a good on-screen rapport, as the two road buddies. George had a more charismatic appeal as an actor, than Martin Milner did. The cinematography in this show was amazing. Especially considering that the show was produced in the early 60s, before the high-tech film cameras of today were available. The scenery in general, was always one of the most enjoyable parts of Route 66.

This was a quality TV drama series. And it was prescient regarding the restlessness of young people, that would intensify by the latter part of the 1960s. In this way, the show was really on the cutting-edge of hipness. Highly recommended, for fans of 60s TV dramas.",1261958400,6,1599,4.724014336917563

My only regret about these editions of ROUTE 66 on DVD is that they are not remastered from the original negatives. Most look as though they came from a TV syndicated package, and the audio is poor on some episodes. But it is sure nice to see the show again.

2910612,4,B000TV1SSS,"The romance of the open road is alive and well as Tod (Martin Milner) and Buz (George Maharis) cruise the country in their snazzy corvette convertible and get involved in the lives of the people they meet. The series opens by explaining that the boys are lost and a ""long way from Route 66,"" when they find themselves in a backwater Mississippi town that harbors a grim secret. From there, they're on to Louisiana where they get involved with a lady shrimp boat captain and find trouble at the New Orleans waterfront before befriending a Nazi-hunter on an off-shore oil rig.

This was the first drama to be filmed entirely on location (in 40 states and Canada) and the locations were really the key to the unique excitement of each show. The boys were mainly observers, albeit defenders of the underdog and good with their fists if need be. Each show featured many famous stars and well-known character actors; the quality of the acting and the scripts (most by Stirling Silliphant) were first-rate.

Clean-cut and twenty-something Tod and Buz bear no resemblance to the leering sex, drug, and rock and roll-crazed young men we often see on the screen today. Dressed in their button-down shirts and freshly-creased slacks, they were upstanding good guys who solved a town's problems in strictly G Rated style.

I Had the pleasure of seeing the show when it ran on Nickelodeon a few years back. Had I known jibberish like Gilligan's Island and Hogan's Hero's would see the light of DVD long before Route 66, I would have tried to record them then, and offer them here, if only as therapy.

Also, the sound is muddy which matches much of the murkiness of the overall visual experience. Having no captions is a drag, too. Other than that, the episodes themselves are wonderful. Too bad no one seems to have thought of remastering the original tapes, or focusing the film better, or cleaning up the sound a bit. But it's great low-tech drama from a time that no longer exists in America.

With a somewhat dark and brooding tone, much like the 'Fugitive', the show jumps from town to city to state along the classic American corridor know as U.S highway route 66.  Brilliant screen writing and direction provide poignant drama as Tod Stiles and Buzz Murdock rediscover early 1960's social views and changing perspectives from the seats of a Chevrolet Corvette.

Best news of all, it appears that the releasing studio has finally heard the pleas of America by halting the absurd practice of half season releases. Appropriately filmed in Black & White; as with ""The Fugitive', this is quality programming for the entire family.

**UPDATE**  08.08.08

I've noticed that with the Volume 1 discs, the video and audio is a bit on the muddy side, probably due to the most affordable source material Infinity decided to spend on this venture.  And as another reviewer stated , the elapsed time & chapters are missing on the Volume 2 discs but this happens on only select players.

BUT, Infinity IS listening to its customers; restoring the OAR and putting the entire 1st season out as a single set.  And at a reasonable price too!  At least Infinity/Roxbury is moving in the right direction.  The Mob bosses at Paramount could take some lessons from them!

Route 66 - What's the Delay on Route 66 DVDs? It's GOOD News, Actually!
Complete 1st Season set still coming; 2nd Season isn't scrapped either!
 by David Lambert (tvshowsondvd), 4/29/2008

Back in mid-March we reported that Infinity Entertainment and Roxbury Entertainment were planning on May 20th releases on DVD for both Route 66 - The Complete 1st Season AND Route 66 - Season 2, Volume 1. Late last week fans of the show started writing in to us, highly concerned that online pre-orders they had placed for one or both of these were being canceled. What's going on? We talked to Infinity, and we've got the scoop on what's happening...and it turns out that it's a good thing, actually.

Along the course of putting out the first DVD packages, Infinity (and Roxbury) recognized that there was some customer dissatisfaction with the half-season sets put out for the first season, and they want to resolve this. To begin with, they are scrapping the half-season set concept at this time. As a result, Season 2, Vol. 1 is completely canceled. Instead, though, we will get a Complete Season 2 DVD package! It's currently penciled in for an October release, but that's not finalized just yet.

In the meantime, the release of The Complete Season 1 DVD set IS still coming out. But it's being pushed back to release sometime in August, in order to give the studio more time to resolve customer complaints about how episodes were presented on disc in the two half-season sets for that show. There has not been any word yet as to whether Infinity will offer any sort of ""upgrade/fix"" path for people who purchased the original versions and wish to get the corrected versions, but we'll let you know if we hear anything.

We'll bring you the specific new release date for Route 66 - The Complete 1st Season once it's been determined, and we'll also bring you the release date for Route 66 - The Complete 2nd Season when that's announced. Stay tuned!

2910630,5,B000TV1SSS,"Just to start off,let me say,that this first addition was so good,and entertaining,that i'm buying the 2nd. edition vol. 2.

To see Todd,and Buzz again brought back so many memories of my youth,I thought I was really back in the 60's,or at least I wanted to be.

The acting, presentation,and story material are so good,that nothing in todays media even comes close.

A definate must see. I just hope ,that we can get all the years of this series?",1211414400,2,446,4.620253164556962
2910631,5,B000TV1SSS,Thanks Infinity for listening to what your customers want and making amends to it! Unlike other DVD companies that ignore their customers and do as they please! Here Here!!!,1210809600,3,173,5.0
2910632,1,B000TV1SSS,"I am old enough to have totally watched and LOVED the original broadcasts of this wonderful series.  I have this product one star based on the excrable quality of the transfer.  The original was in beautiful b&w and rather well photographed, which you would never know from watching this DVD set.

I've noticed some young reviewers panning the series, indicating a lack of interest in the stories.  I have to say that in it's day, ""Route 66"" was indeed cutting edge drama.  Also, it embraced and exemplified the zeitgeist of the early 60s in very many ways.  It was a time of ""busting out"" of the old ways of the 50s and 40s; it was the New Frontier.  It was a time of the ""Beats"" and following your dharma.  Tod and Buz were looking for life's meaning, for connectedness to others.  The were  knights of the road; passionate, sensitive men who, ironically, were always referred to as ""boys"", which was a convention of the time.

Another aspect is that all the stories were shot on location with local extras and the show serves as a series snapshots of specific times and places.

The various ""guest stars"" were either actors who had been famous or were to become famous, and, happily, their performances are archived here.  Others, such as Lois Nettleton, were wonderful tv actors of the time who did memorable things with these interesting roles and characters.

I loved the series because it attempted to reveal people's feelings and, often, their anguish in dealing with life situations.  Every week ""the boys"" encountered, in some Zen sort of way, someone with a major life (or death) problem, some crisis and as a young adolescent each show gave me something to ponder all week until the next episode.  Can anyone really say that about anything (besides ""The Sopranos"") on tv these days?

When I was a child I watched ""Route 66"" with the eyes and mind of a child of those relatively innocent times.  Now, in later middle age, I see more of the sometime acting excesses and over-the-top speeches but I also see a series made with integrity and honesty that attempted to portray a time, a place and a philosophy that still resonates with me today.  I can relate even more with these (fictional) people at a crossroad in their lives; these people speak to me through and beyond the sometimes melodramatic trappings of the show.

I'm sorry whoever did the tape to digital transfer didn't value the artistry of the show more and do it the justice of a careful transfer.

(P.S.  Many, many years after ""Route 66"" ceased production I drove across the country (although on I-80) in a Miata (alas, not a vintage Corvette) with the top down every inch of 3K miles and, yes, listened to Nelson Riddle.  It was my homage.  It made me very happy.)",1210636800,9,2741,4.650727650727651
2910633,4,B000TV1SSS,"The info section of the main page says the aspect ratio is to be 1.33:1.  After the outcry regarding the video quality of Season 1, Volume 1 and the horrible 1.77:1 cropping done on Season 1, Volume 2, maybe the third time IS the charm.  I'll give it 4 stars for now...",1209686400,10,269,4.153846153846154
2910634,5,B000TV1SSS,It was great and just what I asked for. Keep in mind that some of the episodes are not on Route 66...but the story lines are still great. You must be appreciative of black & white TV to really enjoy this.,1209081600,,204,4.0
2910635,3,B000TV1SSS,"It's hard to write a review for this because the show has always been a 5 star show. The production values of the DVDs...not so much.  Since for me it's a given the show is wonderful this review is, like so many others here, going to rant about the physical quality of the DVDs. Though the picture is clear and crisp the sound is appalling. I'm hesitant to do a full blown screaming rant because I don't know what sort of quality tapes the company were working with. The sound is so muffled that I have to wonder if they spent any time at all with a competent sound person cleaning it up. Because of this lack of concern for the buyer I doubt I'll ever buy the second part of season 1 since I've read what they did to the physical framing of the picture with faux letterboxing. This production company hasn't quite learned how to get it right. So the show gets 5 stars ***** but this production gets only three. I only hope that some tv channel once again shows the full series.",1206662400,3,978,4.258064516129032

2910637,5,B000TV1SSS,"Sorry friends and readers, I know it's a bit shopworn but I couldn't resist the title.  I assure you, however, that this TV series remains far from stale.

Inspired by the wanderlust of Kerouac and mainstream America's discovery of the beat subculture, ROUTE 66 ran from 1960 to 1964 and was television's first road trip drama.  Similar to David Janssen's THE FUGITIVE, each episode would have the all-American Tod Stiles (Martin Milner) and his hipster companion Buz Murdock (George Maharis; replaced in mid-1963 by Glenn Corbett as the haunted army vet Lincoln Case) traveling Route 66 in their blue Corvette, getting involved with the lives and problems of the people they'd encounter on the road.

 Although some of today's viewers might find Buz's ""hip lingo"" to be over-the-top, one should understand that he is a beatnik and he talks like a beatnik.  Throughout ROUTE 66's four year run, Stirling Silliphant (VILLAGE Of The DAMNED, IN The HEAT Of The NIGHT, TOWERING INFERNO, POSEIDON ADVENTURE, DIRTY HARRY) was the main scriptwriter, earning the series its well-deserved reputation for quality writing.  Nelson Riddle did the show's opening theme, which became a Top 30 hit.

Included in this 4-disc collection is the first half of the first season, containing 15 episodes (guest starring Walter Matthau, Darren McGavin, Lee Marvin, Leslie Nielsen and Jack Warden, among others), along with extras featuring original commercials and the featurette ""History of the Corvette.""  The rest of the first season can be found on the recently released Season 1: Volume 2.",1205452800,35,1571,5.177865612648222
2910638,2,B000TV1SSS,"This is my first time watching this series. I am a big corvette enthusiast and enjoy nostalgic television. I am noticing by reading other reviews that my fellow critics are enjoying a stroll down memory lane. As for me I don't find the storylines very interesting. Two guys are just aimlessly driving across the country (and not always on route 66) and seem to stick their nose into everybody's business. They would get into alot less fights if they just minded their own business. I just don't get the motivation. They come upon a town, look for work because they are running low on cash and the next thing you know they are coming to the rescue of someone else's misery or misfortune. The first few episodes weren't too bad, but I am half way through volume I and it seems to be going downhill. The theme music is quite bland. According to a review I just read the writer says that Nelson Riddle contributed a new musical score every week. Not according to my viewing. Midway throught this volume there have not been many famous guest appearances. It could get better. So far it has been disappointment.",1205107200,2,1105,4.585858585858586

WHAT YOUNG MAN WOULDN'T WANT TO ZIP AROUND THE COUNTRY IN A COOL CAR AND FIND ADVENTURE AND ROMANCE JUST AROUND EVERY BEND IN THE ROAD??? OF COURSE, IT HELPS TO HAVE THE SCRIPTWRITERS ON YOUR SIDE!!! THE SPIRIT OF TODD AND BUZZ WILL NEVER DIE!!!",1204502400,,290,4.290909090909091
2910641,5,B000TV1SSS,"I was born 5 years after this show aired, so what little I did see of it was on afternoon reruns...as a teenager...a teenager whose attention span lasted about 6 minutes. So, for the first 40 years of my life, my relationship to this show was based on all of about 18 minutes...from three different 6 minute stints as a teenager! lol

The last few years however, I have been checking out various older TV programs for some ""new viewing"" experiences, to help broaden my horizions.
The first episode (Black November) didn't go very well with me. It was dark, dreary, the characters were odd & the condition of the copy wasn't great...thinking I made a mistake with this series, I shelved it for 3 months.
Finally, I got it back out & gave it another chance, trying to keep an open mind. This time, I enjoyed it much better & found myself enjoying each following episode even more. I'm hooked! :D

I really enjoy seeing how things were portrayed back then, enjoy seeing the old cars (I'm a gearhead at heart) & the towns...a bunch of which I've been to through the years. One episode took place in Page, Arizona, early in the construction of Glen Canyon Dam...just a few years after Page was even on the map. I crossed the bridge over the dam just last weekend!

I've ordered a copy of season 1, volume 2 & am anxiously awaiting it's arrival. What a cool show! I'm so glad it's being released on DVD, even though the quality isn't the greatest...but after all, that's about how it was when the show was aired isn't it? The picture sorta snowy & the sound not so clear, depending on which direction the rabbit ears were pointing? LOL!!",1204070400,,1631,4.484848484848484
2910642,5,B000TV1SSS,"I bought this because I remember watching this show with my dad when I was very little. It was my dad's favorite show at the time and now I can understand why. Freedom, adventure, the open road, girls, a couple of fist fights, a swell car - what more could you ask for? The one thing I remembered the most from watching this show at that time was that MEN could have these adventures and wishing that WOMEN could have them, too! Anyway, the DVD set doesn't disappoint. I only wish there was some extras like interviews with the stars. I had forgotten that all the episodes were filmed on location (that must've been a feat in 1960), which makes the show unique. I had also forgotten that Buz Murdoch was a street tough from New York City - a character point that really motivates and moves many of the plots along. Yes, it's in black and white but who cares? I think that it adds to your imagination about our country at that time.",1203206400,,931,4.325714285714286
2910643,4,B000TV1SSS,Brings back memories. I believe the quality could have been enhanced. Enjoyed the old commercials too.,1202428800,,102,5.4375
2910644,5,B000TV1SSS,"I bought this as a gift for the man in my life (I watched it with him) and the quality is great.  I had purchased other Route 66 DVDs for him and they were horrible quality or the CDs wouldn't even play.

It's fun to watch --- there's usually a major star in each episode and it's just fun to see the U.S. the way it use to be.  I recommend watching the commercials that are an ""extra"" in this set ......... they are a hoot.",1202256000,,424,3.9069767441860463
2910645,5,B000TV1SSS,"Can't say much more than what has already been said but I particularly like the view the series provides of past locations, morals and living standards of the time. Got a laugh when Todd and Buzz talked about $85 a week being a big paycheck! I think 50+ folks will enjoy the look back while younger ones can learn something about our recent past.",1201910400,,346,4.421875
2910646,4,B000TV1SSS,"It's a fascinating series on a number of levels, and it has to be said that not every episode really hangs together, but most do. It feels contemporary and the on location filming will always preserve it with that genuine on the road feel..and, speaking of On the Road, are we to, I suppose, come to the conclusion that Buzz Murdoch is based on Jack Kerouac? Or is that just a redundant question..

Play it Glissando is fantastic, I mean Jack Lord and Anne Francis in the same episode. Both a  melancholy and upbeat series in some ways, too, presenting a golden encapsulation of a free America but, also a presentation of its transitory, fleeting glories. This is one series that can be genuinely called classic, and personally I found the video quality to be as good as you can hope for.

2910647,5,B000TV1SSS,"I became hooked on this tv series when I saw it in syndication in the 1980's during late night.

As an extra, some of the commercials are shown separatly as ""Bonus Features"".

Their life is carefree and they follow no schedule. Just trying to find a place to fit in.

2910649,5,B000TV1SSS,"Of all the series of the golden age of television, when the writers grew up on radio with a fund of experience and an ear for dialogue, Route-66 captured the promise of the Kennedy era. Before I read Shakespeare, Kerouac and Hunter Thompson, this weekly series coaxed me along. Long overdue, I cannot wait to see more of the calvalcade of talent this trail-blazing series nurtured. Looking back, you can see the coming wave of change, for at their least, Buz and Todd resembled early beach bums (surfers) with pendleton shirts, open collars and casual attire, attacking any way, at any town, head-on with their street smarts, mental toughness, parental reminders and bonhomie into the challenging future. Underlying the entire series is the road itself, Route-66, which represented openness and excitement, unlimited expectations. Every locale presented unknown obsstacles, yet these two buddies, the downtown and uptown of city slickers, continued on. It never left my mind, how one could meet the challenges of life if one consulted his past,(parents and book learning) and drove headlong into the next adventure. Not only is the changing landscape interesting to see, but the endless supply of acting talent, presenting fascinating as well as fantastic tour de force stretches of character, delightful snippets of characters we were to see broadened much later in cinema, like George Kennedy in the first episode ""Black November.""  ""A Lance of Straw,"" depicts the struggle of shrimp boat operators, with a riveting portrayal by Janice Rule of a too self-reliant captain(Yes, Virginia, a CEO)with a male crew, taking great risks to succeed. The photograpy of Janice is exceptional, creating the perils of shimpers in hurricane conditions with believable terror. Here it is 46 years later and there is simply too much of this carefully crafted series, nursed along by Herbert B Leonard's wife to boot, to comment at length upon. The cast and crew made this series something very special; making the coming decade an open road of opportunity. What this series seemed to depict was that life was simply the journey more than the destination. Take a spin.",1200960000,,2153,5.151428571428571

Some have had complaints on the technical quality of the transfer from film, most commonly that it's dark.  Yes, the first episode is dark, but it took place mostly at night. Later ones look fine.  Audio is OK; about what I'd expect from a 16 mm optical soundtrack.

All in all I gave it a 5.  It's well worth buying.",1200960000,2,531,4.26

2910652,4,B000TV1SSS,"There are so many old series from television that need to be released on DVD. This one is long overdue but it's good to see that the speed of release of episodes may be as quick as Stiles' Corvette on a straightaway. Yes, there seem to be some weaknesses (Buz is going to belt someone in every episode, apparently) and sometimes the sound wanders (why not digitally remaster?). But the romance of the American road sans interstates and their interchanges comes through with a new location in every episode. And each episode is at its best when Stirling Siliphant's lines flow from the mouths of the characters (usually one of the guest stars). This series is well worth collecting all the episodes. Little, if anything, will change when Linc Case and the Stingray join the cast. And, if I remember correctly, thankfully the series was never shot in color. Although that would have added brilliance to the often spectacular, sometimes stark, scenery, Route 66 belongs in black and white as a reminder that it reflected an American love affair with the curves, double yellow lines, and roadside cafes of a bygone era.",1200096000,2,1115,4.8125

I'm not sure where Route 66 enters into the picture since one of the early episodes takes place at Grand Isle, Louisiana, which is a long way from the real US 66. Of course that legendary stretch of highway goes (actually, 'went') from Chicago to Los Angeles. This departure from reality in no way takes away from the show's entertainment quality, though. Well, not to spoil anything, but this is a series about two guys who drive around looking for...??? I guess it's a Corvette version of Easy Rider sans the drugs and hippies, neither of which was in vogue yet. Martin Milner was usually the driver and George Maharis was a rumbler.

2910659,5,B000TV1SSS,"I will date myself by saying that when Route 66 was in its first run I was in my early 20s. Believe me, this was by far the favorite show of guys my age. When I was in the Navy the TV room was always SRO once a week when Route 66 was on. And as someone else has stated, it wasn't just the Corvette, although it was nice seeing two guys driving around in the car that we all wanted someday to own.

No, it wasn't just the Corvette (the shortened moniker ""vette"" wasn't in use yet). It was the fact that every show was shot on location, and it was the direction, the actors (many now famous, early in their careers), and the overall high and even ground breaking production values. Most of all, it was the writing, primarily by Sterling Silliphant, stories that grabbed you, made you think, and sometimes brought a tear to your eye. Writing of a quality that hasn't been seen in movies or TV in decades, so much the pity. And it was also that great Nelson Riddle ""Route 66 Theme."" That tune was actually a hit record for a while, and maybe it didn't raise your spirits to be driving along in your own car, turn on the radio, and hear that Route 66 music as ""background"" to the world passing by your window!

""Route 66"" was an experience, and guess what--it still is. I am having a great time revisiting these great old shows, enjoying the stories once again, and yes, feasting my eyes on that '61 Corvette.

As most fans know, there were two Horizon Blue Corvettes for filming, as well as a troupe of other Chevrolet products (Chevy sponsored the show) that traveled along with the production company. Also, George Maharis traveled in his own personal Corvette. My company commander in boot camp was an acquaintance of Maharis, having met him in that famous duck hotel in Memphis while they were shooting there, and got to drive George's Corvette, something he never got tired of telling people about. He had been working as a desk clerk at the hotel at the time and, like many locals in the show's history, appeared briefly on camera. Since Milner and Maharis were friendly, outgoing guys, the show left a string of ordinary people in its wake who all today have stories to tell of their first hand experiences when ""Route 66"" came to town. As I said, Route 66 was an experience! You got that feeling just sitting in your own living room watching it on TV.

So it's a joy to finally have one of the best written and produced shows in TV history finally on DVD. True, the picture and sound quality vary from show to show, but I wouldn't put too much blame on the transfer. You have to consider the probable condition of the source material these 45 years after the fact. I don't know if the show was filmed on 16 or 35mm, but remember that it was only intended to be shown on the relatively weak quality television of that time, and today we are used to seeing and hearing much higher quality on modern television. That said, every one of the shows on this DVD collection are quite viewable, and when you get into the stories, the 1950s, early '60s quality of the source material won't even be noticed.

If you want to enjoy stories of a quality that is totally missing from modern television, and movies too for that matter, do yourself a huge favor and buy this set! I can't wait for the second half of season 1 to come out.

A couple of automotive sidebars: Although Todd and Buzz were living from paycheck to paycheck and barely making ends meet, for six seasons they always had the newest model Corvette! (Chevrolet saw to that) Also, in the early shows take a look at the car driven by the love interest. It's always the same 1960 Chevy convertible, which obviously traveled with the show. That car really got around!

I could go on and on, and probably already have!",1196208000,10,3771,4.4094827586206895

Considering the age of the films, the video and audio are decent, to say the least. My issues with this set are some obvious ones: In the preceeding ""Best of Route 66"" collection by Roxybury Entertainment, there were 11 episodes, all had the original commercials intact within the episodes, inluding show promos for the next week's episode. For this collection, I would've preferred they transferred them this way (the ""original commercials"" extra was thrown together sort of un-professionally, with the control track not synching up sometimes until after the commercial had started). Also, why not include the show promos as a bonus feature? I would've preferred to see this than a history of the Corvette sports car as a bomus feature. My other issue is why break up Season One into two volumes? I'm guessing the reason is packaging 8 discs instead of 4 would bring up the price and imminent additional revenue to be made on Season One, Volume Two for die-hards fans. Otherwise, this series, (which has been long overlooked by TV-to-DVD distribution companies), is finally getting it's due on DVD.

Since the beginning of the Video/DVD world for sell via the internet, I have been searching for the release of this series. I did not remember how great the writing was until Nick at Night re-ran the show as part of their regular line-up in the mid 1980's. Just as I had become addicted to Route 66 all over again, the network started running a commercial announcement that the show was ""leaving the air"" forever. I have always wondered if there had been some in-fighting over the rights to series and that is why it was taken off of Nickelodeon and not released for public sale.
After years of searching, I finally found a Candian distributor that sold the entire series as one set. I had to have it. It was poorly packaged, poor quality and some of the DVD's did not work at all. However, I did finally get to see some episodes I had been wanting to see for a very long time. This new release has only the beginning of the series and the show got better as it went on.

2910668,5,B000TV1SSS,"I am so happy that someone has begun the task of releasing Route 66 on DVD. Although the transfer may not be perfect, most of the episodes on this release are very good or at least very very watch-able. Besides, this DVD release is still better than the old Colombia VHS tapes - which only released 20 episodes period.

In one of these episodes, we get to see Riverside County in Southern California when it was covered in plenty of rolling hills of grasses and trees; compared to today where these same hills are covered in homes and businesses. Another episode shows the Date Farms and surrounding areas of Palm Desert and Indio, south of Palm Springs, CA and back during the filming of Route 66 these two areas were wide open desert fields, unlike today. I don't even think those two cities even existed at that time. It's just great to see all these different areas and what they looked like back in the early 1960's: the Route 66 era.

As kids, or young adults, we enjoyed Route 66 for a number of reasons. And now, after all these decades later, we not only get to enjoy watching Route 66 again and again, but we get to enjoy some other aspects of the series that we did not when we watched the series as kids. i.e. we see how the many areas Buzz and Todd visited and filmed have changed so much.

I also enjoyed the extra feature where the DVD's list past movie performances of the main cast members from each of the episodes. This was a great resource, as some of the listed movies I have never heard of and some sound very interesting and I plan to search some of the movies out. And I also suspect that some of these credited movies are probably physically lost films - never to be seen again.

If you liked this series in the past, or you're a fan of the series now, I encourage you to purchase this release and hopefully with all of our support more DVD's of Route 66 will follow. The Naked City DVD Sets, no matter how GREAT their transfers were and mentioned in other folks reviews, the Naked City has stopped at Set 3 and no more seem to be in the works - as far as I can tell.

2910673,4,B000TV1SSS,"I'll add my voice to the chorus rejoicing in the long awaited release of this excellent series but finding fault with the technical quality of the product.  Several episodes looked great, several were about on a par with the Columbia House tapes and several were disappointing because of the contrast problem mentioned previously. (The comparison to the superior technical quality of recent ""Naked City"" DVDs is spot on.)  Even so, I'm simply delighted that the series is finally being made available and I only hope sales suffice to justify its continued and full release.

""Route 66"" was not, as an earlier reviewer claimed, standard TV fare from the early 1960s.  It was superior even then, as were a handful of other classic series from that era, ""The Twilight Zone"" especially included.  And like ""The Twilight Zone,"" some ""Route 66"" episodes were brilliant, some were so-so and some were weak, at least by the series' generally high standards. Sadly, Stirling Silliphant isn't nearly as well remembered today as Rod Serling, and yet in many ways he was the superior writer.  In general, these stories hold up not merely as nostalgia but as superior television fare that continues to deserve a wide audience.",1193356800,11,1213,5.009950248756219
2910674,4,B000TV1SSS,"Definitely 5 stars for the decision to finally make all the episodes (one hopes) available on DVD. I've watched the first 3 of 4 CDs (hence, 12 episodes) and have to echo the previous commenter about the technical quality. My main complaint is that episodes are ""dark"" to such an extent it's often hard to make out details - something which black and white tends to emphasize in any case. In short, even though the source tapes might have deteriorated, the supposed ""remastering"" should have dealt better with this contrast problem. While the worst cases appear in the first half dozen episodes, it's still regrettable. And doing an A-B comparison of similar episodes on the DVD and the earlier Columbia House videos shows this is largely a mastering problem with the DVD.But, having access to the show (which I faithfully watched beginning season two when it originally aired) is something all fans show rejoyce in. I won't go into explaining to the unitiated, as others have here - warts and all.

2910675,4,B000TV1SSS,"Not having seen Route 66 since it briefly reran on Nick at Nite twenty years ago, I was really looking forward to DVD release. Still, no avoiding the fact that this package is something of a lemon. A particular disappointment in light of high-grade DVD treatment given to same production team's Naked City.

Seems like most of money when into flashy packaging with little thought about actual content. Very shoddy technical quality: Some episodes seem to have been duped from bad syndication tapes or maybe even bottom-of-barrel 16 mm prints. Opening episode, much of which takes place at night, is so murky that actors' faces are frequently bathed in such dark shadows (even during some daytime sequences) that facial expressions are rendered meaningless. Other early episodes are similarly murky, have numerous scratches and print debris, and feature wobbly and/or uneven sound.

Chintzy extras, too--no interviews with Milner or Maharis and for a 15-episode collection, I expected more than five or six original commercials--two of them virtually identical aspirin spots. (Although it was fun seeing the My Three Sons cast in a bizarre spot for the 1961 Biscayne.) Other extras include bare-bones guest-star filmographies and a brief featurette about history of Corvette. (But let's face it--people who love this show watch it for the drama, not because they're Road & Track fans.)

2910676,4,B000TV1SSS,"The euphoria of the early five star pre-release customer reviews now has to be tempered with the reality of this new release from Roxbury Entertainment (owner of the series) and Infinity Entertainment (the DVD releasing company).  Unfortunately, the audio/visual quality of this release is simply not up to the standards set by some of the major studios for classic/vintage TV-on-DVD releases.  While there are, indeed, some very good looking episodes in this release of the series' first 15 episodes, the reality is that a number of the episodes are of lesser visual quality.  They're not horrible looking, mind you, but they're certainly not as good as one would expect for one of the key television series of the 1960s.  One of the episodes, ""A Fury Slinging Flame,"" is clearly an edited, syndication episode timing in at just over 46 minutes, though all of the other episodes average around 51 minutes.  ""Route 66"" was produced around the same time as ""Naked City"" by the same producer, Herbert B. Leonard, and the episodes from that series that have been released to date by Image Entertainment look significantly better than what has been released in this collection.  One wonders what this release could have been had it been in the hands of an Image Entertainment or CBS/Paramount, which has released brilliant looking vintage TV series on DVD such as ""The Fugitive"" and ""The Untouchables,"" among several others.

The DVD's producers have included some original, vintage commercials which, like the ""Naked City"" DVD releases, are included as an extra feature and are not integrated into the individual shows.  There are also cast bios (including short clips from the episodes), as well as a photo gallery and historic information about the Chevrolet Corvette's early years.  But one wishes that the series' leads, George Maharis and Martin Milner (both, thankfully, still with us but getting on in years), had either been interviewed for this set or even provided some episode commentary.

The brilliance of this series is the sum total of its parts, starting with superior writing, the superb casting of both leads and weekly guest stars, and the on-location filming across America, circa early 1960s.  Simply put, ""Route 66"" ranks among the very best television dramas of all time.  That it has not received better treatment on DVD befitting its pedigree is a shame.

Despite the flaws in its presentation, this release is essential for all fans of the series and those who appreciate a classic, quality dramatic television series.  Let's hope that Roxbury/Infinity can make significant improvements on subsequent releases of the series.  ""Route 66,"" the series, easily earns five stars, but this DVD set loses a star for a somewhat less than desirable audio/visual presentation.",1193184000,15,2789,5.139380530973451
2910677,5,B000TV1SSS,"How quickly the cultural phenomena of one generation is forgotten by the next. From the years 1960-64 ""Route 66"" was one of the most popular and critically acclaimed TV shows on the air. But it has been little remembered throughout the years, and somehow the status of a television classic to rank with the likes of TV's greatest has inexplicably eluded it.
Ostensibly an adventure show chronicling the ultimate American road trip, Route 66 originally had three main regular stars: (1) Martin Milner as clean-cut, Yale-educated, introspective Tod Stiles, (2) George Maharis as his close friend the street-wise, hep-talking and opccasionally short-tempered Buz Murdock and (3) the Corvette the two of them drove around the U.S.A. in search of romance and adventure.
""Route 66"" had all the qualities that the greatest of television series possess: Fully developed lead characters who attain depth and complexity and become as familiar to viewers as their own friends and family, superlative top-notch writing including classic lines of dialog, unforgettable individual episodes and scenes, quality musical scores tailored for individual episodes and used to great effect, and even a two-part series finale which brought closure to the saga (almost unknown in television at the time, today it is de reguir).
The series achieved a quality of literary and dramatic excellence seldom seen on the small screen, and did it consistently throughout its four-year run. The brilliant scripts of chief writer Stirling Silliphant and his award-winning stable of writers took Tod and Buz through a series of psychological character-based stories in their trek throughout America unparallelled in the medium. In contrast to the pat happy endings and clean resolutions which prevail in episodic TV drama even to this day, the individual stories of ""Route 66"" often turned out to be tragedies with no real winners, no clear answers. As the series progressed and the stories began to attain more complexity, some of them quite flatly appeared to be nearly incomprehensible on a first viewing, only to take on new levels and layers of meaning each time they were viewed again. Yet the series showed it's diversity by offering up the occasionally delightful whimsical comic episode as well. ""Route 66"" probably couldn't be done today.
But perhaps the most unique aspect of the series - and its most historically significant one - was the fact that it actually was filmed on location all throughout the U.S. And not only were the adventures of Tod and Buz played out against the background of familiar metroplolises such as Chicago, L.A. and Boston, but in America's small off the beaten path communities as well. Towns like Grant's Pass, Oregon; Butte, Montana; Carlisle, Pennsylvania; Apache Junction, Arizona; Poland Springs, Maine and many others had episodes filmed in them, and those shows remain as important time capsules for those communities of how they looked in the early 60's.
There's so much more to say about this marvelous show, but that will have to wait till the release of volume 2. Yes, the only shortcoming of this set is that only the first 15 of the 116 episodes are availible. And, also true, that while this undenaibly constitutes fifteen great hours of entertainment for the truly discerning, the show is still finding its legs, and these early offerings really only begin to hint at the level of excellence that ""Route 66"" was about to achieve. In fact, the benchmark for me when the show really began to take off, was right immediately after episode fifteen.
Well, all the more reason for us to buy this set, then, so that the makers will put out the rest of these 116 true screen gems. Then finally all of us devotees who have held on all these years to our old VHS tapes garnered from mid-eighties Nick at Nite reruns, made nearly unwatchable from the wear of having our most beloved epsiodes played again and again and again, will finally be able to retire them.

ADDENDUM: This initial review was written just prior to the release of this set. At the time, neither I nor the other fans of the show who were eagerly awaiting this official release could have anticipated the dreadful overall quality of the set, probably the worst of any official TV series DVD offering I've ever seen. While everything I stated above about the quality and importance of the review still holds true, I would be remiss if I did not add my voice to the other reviewers warning about the poor quality of these episode transfers which in most cases are no better than bootleg quality. One episode, ""The Fury Slinging Flame"", is actually an edited-for-syndication version with four and a half minutes trimmed from the original! This is unacceptable for a professional release and I cannot believe that better quality sources were not availible for this important release which has been so badly done. If this is the only way you can get epsiodes of Route 66, then by all means by the set, as the series is of such an outstanding quality that it must be seen in whatever watchable form one can get it. But take heed of the warnings of the quality I and others have posted. The five stars for the series itself I gave earlier still holds, but I have to temper that earlier enthusiasm by giving two stars to the quality of the product.",1193011200,15,5318,4.908888888888889

2910680,5,B000TV1SSS,"Forty Six years ago the Route 66 TV series was part of the standard quality TV fare. Today Friday Night Lights and American Dreams are having or have had trouble staying on the air due to low ratings. What does that tell us about the real state of ""quality"" TV ?
I am hoping that there is enough interest here that all 116 episodes come out on DVD, and not over a period of 2 years, but much faster. Character and story driven TV shows like this are what make this series so special. Yes, it was based on Jack Kerouac's book ""On The Road"", but with such good writing, acting, and story lines, I doubt that anyone will find a bad episode. A story line about the Vietnam War in 1963? Talk about being ahead of its time !!! A line up of todays stars that would take too long to list.
I have a DVD put out by another company that has 11 episodes (like a greatest hits) that was supposedly remastered and has the original music and commercials. I hope this set of DVD's at a minimum, has the same focus.

Since this series was actually filmed all over the U.S., it is like an emotional and cerebral history lesson of where we were and where we are. Yes, most of the baby boomers will buy this type of DVD, but when the series was on Nickelodeon in the mid 1980's after being off the air for 20 years, I found that when I exposed a younger generation to its stories there was more than a passing interest in each new episode. Quality TV doesn't die; It's just put in storage until someone can resurrect it and show us anew what we've been missing.

Todd & Buz, glad to have you back. The life lessons taught to a then new generation through Route 66 still resonate today, because even though the times may change, human behavior and its ups and downs don't really change that much.
Thanks for getting this series to the public, and I can't wait to buy the rest of Season 1, as well as Seasons 2, 3, & 4. If TV and film are an interest or a passion of yours, spend your money wisely and buy all of these Route 66 DVD's as they come out. You will NEVER regret it.",1189036800,17,2055,4.147869674185464

8211134,5,B000TV1SSS,"I read somewhere after watching the Elvis film Follow that Dream that Anne Helm was chosen because of her work in a Route 66 episode.
So I tracked it down and could see straight away why that was. She was extremely good in both parts.
Now I have happily been diverted to a new viewing experience and will be renewing memories of the early 1960s shows.
Phew that was a long time ago!
I am expecting the rest to be as good.  Route 66....Here I come!",1513468800,,447,4.1976744186046515
8211135,4,B000TV1SSS,Years ago I bought the VHS Collectors Edition of eight episodes  was shocked at the terrible quality  even at that time they were unwatchable. So I was quite skittish reading the Amazon reviews which suggested that the Shout Factory complete set and other DVDs issued in 2008  had not improved the quality. The reviews did say that the 2012 reissue of season 1 had addressed many of the quality issues and I found that to be true (other than the fact that the 1961 Corvette is obviously elongated). Looking back over 60 years it is just incredible how good the actors and plots were  so much better than the junk on today's TV series. Well worth buying and watching.,1504915200,,666,4.571428571428571

8211137,1,B000TV1SSS,"The cast in this series was quite good - but the stories they were saddled with defy reality.
Steling Silliphant has concocted the most outlandish sequence of preposterously and unbelievably
dramatic episodes EVAH!!!
One week the boys are being tried for murder, the next they are protecting people from a Nazi
govt official. Yeah, boy! them Nazis were everywhere. .And the scripts get even more out of touch.
 In two months, the boys have held 8 different jobs, from draftsmen to race car drivers, to tuna
 fisherman to mechanics, and they are exceedingly competent at them all. I simply can't watch
these episodes - And they are so  preachy I feel like I'm in a Hollywood propaganda ward.
Sterling Silliphant sucked as a concocter of tales. His stories seemed  only to exist to .allow him to
preach his corny  philosophy of life, one which makes Hugh Hefner's Playboy simplistic philosophy
(anything between consenting adults is ""OK"") look positively brilliant.
The sad thing is that the overall cast and general theme of the series should have produced an
entertaining piece of television. It just needed a good scriptwriter or team of writers. What a shame.",1504656000,,1161,4.963917525773196

8211141,5,B000TV1SSS,"Greatest television show ever period. The writing, story plots, acting and direction boggles my mind every time I watch an episode, and people also really miss the point between whether Link or Buzz is better than the other, there is no way to make comparisons, both are different and that is all but both actors are superb.",1489622400,,324,4.701754385964913
8211142,5,B000TV1SSS,"Co-creator and prolific Academy Award winning writer Sterling Silliphant wrote more than two thirds of season one's thirty episodes and it shows . Highly literate , thoughtful , realistic and teaming with an ongoing , pleased to do the right thing attitude , I can honestly say I've never seen another television show like it . It's truly uplifting , gratifying and rewarding .
I'm much more of a motion picture enthusiast than a television buff . This season of this program goes a long , long way towards restoring my faith , interest and fascination in the smaller screen . Truly unique and exceptional concept and execution by all involved and mightily recommended .",1487203200,,670,4.834782608695652
