8363151,1,B0000A5A1X,"I have seen better troma movies and this one did not hold my interest with its cheesy low budget style. I wished I would never have bought it. If you are thinking of it, forget it. Better off buying Troma's ""Hobo With a Shotgun"" which i highly recommend.",1358640000,,254,4.3125
8363152,5,B0000A5A1X,"A breathtaking allegory of the world we live in, Viral Assassins, set in an undefined near future, shows the government's solution to the problem of a new terminal desease - they simply make carrying the desease a capital crime. Most of the film is taken up by a terrifying secret conversation that takes place between three people in  one room; skinscrawlingly uneasy secrecy and mistrust, on top of the claustrophobic nature of the setting, make this a film that, in spite of it's modest budget, easily surpasses the tension and watchability of any major multimilliondollar Hollywood movie with a critical edge (in itself a rare commodity). In Viral Assassis you get nothing of the predictable plots that we know from visiting the multiplexes, in this highly original and unique film we are constantly on the edge of our seat untill the unexpected climax. Highest possible recommendation.",1095724800,4,890,5.095890410958904
