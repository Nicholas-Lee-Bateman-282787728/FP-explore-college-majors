8516467,4,B007GQ279I,I saw this on tv a long time ago and would like to see it again. But it isn't avaliable now! I wish you would get more in stock and not at an outrageous high price! It seems almost everything from the 70's-80's are hard to come by or they are way over priced. I refuse to pay that much money for a dvd movie that isn't worth the price they are asking! I have bills that cost as much as the price of these dvd movies from the 70's & 80's... In this age and time people are looking for the lower price!,1369785600,6,500,3.8173076923076925
8516468,5,B007GQ279I,"As the title hints, Genie Francis is great in this movie. Glad to see her in something other than General Hospital. This is a Cinderella story. From Rags to Riches but she doesn't do it with a fairy tale. She does it on her own with her smarts. Like that.",1343606400,9,255,4.12
