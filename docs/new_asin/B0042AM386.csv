4247652,5,B0042AM386,"Denise Austin's ""SHRINK YOUR FAT ZONES PILATES""  is a wonderful pilates workout dvd.
It consists of 3 workouts broken up in zones for 21 days to trim and slim.
ZONE1 (15 mins);
This workout is for abs & core. It works the abs from every angle and you WILL feel your muscles work.
ZONE2 (15 mins);
This workout is for the upper body. It works the shoulders,chest and arms. You will need Weights for this workout.
ZONE3 (15 mins);
This workout is for the buns and thighs. You will need a towel for this workout.

Denise Austin shows that she knows her stuff in this workout,using her background exercisers to demonstrate correct technique and informs the viewer on the muscles/body parts being exercised.

Don't worry if you are not very flexible,this dvd is for everyone:-)",1292630400,101,772,4.703703703703703

4247686,5,B0042AM386,"I really like Denise Austin videos I have 2 of her DVD sets that have several 15 minute segments and it really works for me. She does go pretty fast so the first time you might need to back up the video a little. But she doesn't do anything totally out there - I'm pretty much a beginner and I can follow it. They've been around for a while (early 2000's) but they work for me, I like her pace and I feel like I'm getting a work out!",1507593600,,433,3.8764044943820224
4247687,5,B0042AM386,"For years I used the same Denise Austin dvd day in and day out. Pilates for every body. Along with smart eating choices and walk/sprinting on the  treadmill I lost 90lbs. Anyway, after years of only doing that one I decided to buy this dvd and love it. I think Denise Austin is the least annoying fitness dvd instructor ever. She gets cheesy at times, but its never too bad. This dvd Im particular is great because you can do all 45 minutes, or choose one, two, or three 15 minute workouts.",1507334400,,490,4.326086956521739

4247691,3,B0042AM386,"Though this one is newer, from 2010, I find that the format of 3,15 minutes workouts to be too broken up for my purposes. As a side note, you will need props for these workouts, like a yoga towel and hand weights, for instance. Also, these workouts are more like a hybrid of low-impact aerobics meets Pilates, not pure Pilates.

If you want a really well done yet beginner paced Pilates workout from a real Pilates instructor, I highly recommend Brooke Siler https://www.amazon.com/Element-Pilates-Weight-Loss-Beginners/dp/B001AYWY6I/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_pdt_img_top?ie=UTF8.",1500854400,,570,5.867469879518072

4247703,4,B0042AM386,I wish Denise would spend a little more time explaining the moves and allow more time for learning the move before she moves on.  It might be a better workout for someone already familiar with Pilates.  As someone just learning this doesn't offer quite the beginner instruction I was hoping for.  It does offer a good workout if you can keep up with her.  You need a small towel for part of it.,1500595200,2,394,4.3561643835616435

4247705,3,B0042AM386,"The workout seems to be effective, but I am really glad that I'd been doing yoga for a while before beginning this one.  The video does not include enough warmups or stretches for the workout, in my opinion.  Someone who was new to exercise at home could really hurt themselves doing some of the moves without good stretching and experience.  I hate that the exercises are not in any rhythm or even matched to the accompanying music.  And, like most people, I find Denise Austin somewhat annoying- but you can do the workouts without her voice.  However, it's nice to have the combination option for which workouts you want to do in what order.  Even after only fifteen minutes of a leg segment, I was sweating and enjoying the activity.  Will continue to use in combination with other at-home workouts; doing on my own schedule in my own home still beats trying to make it to the gym.",1498262400,3,885,4.563291139240507

I am in day 13 of my fitness plan, I chose this DVD because Denise usually works really well for beginners. However not this DVD,  I could barely do any exercise in this video! It was such a struggle.

Great exercises and if I could perform the tasks at hand I probably would see results, however I found myself just struggling too much to even complete a pose. Some of the exercises are not easy, but you can manage. But most are very advanced. This video is for intermediate and definitely advanced. Someone who has strengthen their body and worked out a few months could probably do these exercises, not someone who is just starting out. I am disappointed because I wanted this video to be my back up for when I don't want to do Cardio, but this will go on the shelf for a few months. :( I won't even attempt to do this DVD again for awhile.",1483747200,3,938,4.264044943820225

I have a foot injury and am looking for anything which will give me a workout while allowing my foot to heal.  This is not that workout.  In my opinion it barely qualifies as a workout.  Very, very lightweight overall.  The best part was the abs section.  I did feel like my abs got a halfway decent workout.  I did Denise Austin years ago and thought I would like this, but I didn't.

To me this is more for beginners or people who have had major illness or injury and are trying to get back into things.  I just didn't feel it at all.",1476144000,,631,4.10655737704918

4247775,5,B0042AM386,"This DVD has three 15 minute workout sections.  The abs/core workout kicked my abs to the curb. It depends on how much oomph you put into the moves, but I worked hard and couldn't finish some of the exercises.  Denise uses a towel to help cradle your head while working your abs - I love this because my neck gets tired when doing ab work.  The lower body section was great and has new exercises I've never done on any other exercise DVD.  The time passed quickly without lingering too long over any moves.  You can increase your intensity as you progress.  Denise was quieter in this DVD and gives instruction without too much chatter.  There's also the option to workout just to music.  I plan on using this DVD a few days a week and expect good results based on the intensity and variety of exercises.  Highly recommend this DVD.",1456444800,,832,4.456953642384106

4247780,2,B0042AM386,This DVD is AWFUL. How does it have such a high rating? I could do without Denise Austin telling me how great my butt is going to look and how I'm going to lose those flabby arms. She's incredibly annoying. The workout itself is average. Not great but not terrible. I'd rather pay and go to a class with someone who's not so difficult to listen to. I doubt I'll use it more than the one time I already did.,1453420800,,406,4.0875

4247794,4,B0042AM386,"I am mostly a Kundalini, yoga, and dance type of workout person but I really liked this DVD.  I chose this DVD because the trailer has flowy, stretchy looking movements.  It did not disappoint but there was less stretching than I thought.  No matter, I still loved it.  The abs workout was incredible. I don't believe there was one exercise I didn't like.  I was feeling the effect hours late but in a good way.
I think there were three exercises I modified. I modified because they either stressed my back or I just wanted more stretch. It was easy to do with all the yoga practice I have had.  Modifying the exercises made it more pleasurable and fun.
I only gave it a four because the music is not inspiring nor was there a good cool down. It's still a great workout DVD for the price and time put in. I am glad I have it. Thank you Denise for adding more workout joy into our lives.",1442188800,,886,4.244047619047619

4247813,4,B0042AM386,"Summary:  This is the one you really want for beginners.  While I am not a beginner exerciser, I am mid-50's in good condition I am glad, thanks to reading other reviewers I chose this one.
Details:  Wow, what a difference.  I ordered 2 Pilates Dvds.  Wish I had bought only this one because the other - Element Pilates weight loss for beginners - complete DUD!! - The only thing I got out of it was the initial few minutes explaining what ""Pilates"" philosophy is, which Denise does not completely go into as much detail, but definitely enough explanation.  I had to throw Element Pilates in the trash because three of their exercises included wrapping arms around legs and ""wobbling"" on your butt!  I go into that much detail because this one is SO much better.  It not only offers 3 different 20 minute workouts they are reasonable in their moves.  While I am definitely not new to exercise dvds (originally vcr tapes that's how long I've been using them!) I hurt my back last year so I had to change the type of exercise I do to include yoga which did not really work well for me - the beginner yoga was fine but when we got to the downward dog which is great if you're 5'2, but with my long legs forget it!  Pilates was suggested.  This Dvd is challenging enough especially since I'm just getting back to fully working out, as opposed to just physical therapy & just exercises mostly focused on my back.  If you've had any issues with your back or knees this Dvd will still work for you.  I tried to thoroughly read the reviews for suggestions about each Dvd program if they would work for me.  This one really does.  I've always had to modify 1 or 2 exercises over all these years, no problem.  Only had 1-2 moves for minor modification for me mostly lying on my back or side to accomplish the same move she did standing or on her side balancing on her arm & foot.  I could have done the moves just fine, just for right now I need the extra back support for at least right now.  Got some cardio, thanks, which is what I really need in addition to adding to my regular strength training ""go to"" exercises.  I would go so far as to buy another Denise Austin Dvd because the music is not annoying, no ""cutsie"" ""girlie"" stuff and will be looking for a little more challenging moving forward.  The only complaint is that I wanted more repetitions, so I just went ahead & did them myself, easily stopping the Dvd, so again for a beginner or someone who hasn't exercised in a while this would be perfect.  For right now, it is perfect for me and I think it will always be included as an option for I would not quite call it an ""easier day"" but a good go-to in-between more challenging days.",1431734400,19,2688,4.346693386773547

I'm 25 and I haven't worked out AT ALL in years so I thought this would be a great place to start. I'm very out of shape and not flexible and I still found this to be way too easy. Most of the moves are good but simply aren't repeated enough to be effective. I think I'd have to do each segment two or three times and that defeats the purpose of a quick workout. I've found that I get a lot more bang for my buck with Jillian Michaels.,1414368000,,527,3.888888888888889

4247862,5,B0042AM386,Loved this work out! Three fifteen minute sessions with three target zones is great! I like that even during the work out she tells you different options for easier or more advance positions,1400976000,,190,4.787878787878788
4247873,4,B0042AM386,"I have been doing this workout for about a month and a half and I absolutely love it!

When I read reviews for things like this, I like to know what kind of results people got, but before I get into that, let me explain how I have been doing the workouts.

I started out doing a modified version of the 21 day challenge that is on the disc. There are three exercises including one for abs, one for upper body, and one for lower body (all 15 mins each). The first week I did the ab workout everyday and then alternated between lower and upper body. The second week I did upper body everyday and alternated abs and lower body. And the third week I did lower body everyday and alternated abs and upper body. I liked her workouts so much I got the sculpt and burn body blitz, so for every week after the first three, I have been alternating between this DVD and body blitz every other day.

I've maybe lost 2-3 lbs in that time, but don't let that discourage you. I know people are dead set on losing weight as fast as they can, but seriously be patient. I am overweight, plain and simple. I could probably stand to lose about 25lbs. However, I'm not interested in losing weight as much as inches because to me, weight is just a number. Since I started, I have lost about 10 inches overall (from my stomach, thighs, arms, and butt), lost almost 2% body fat, and gained a LOT of muscle. I haven't changed anything about my diet at all, but I don't really eat unhealthily in the first place.

I do have to say, Denise is a little cheesy. Also I find that some of the things that she says just don't really make any sense, so I like that you can do the workouts without hearing her talk and just have music playing instead.
I also find that she likes to say that you have x amount of a rep left and then she will do twice as many plus.
When I noticed that, I started counting how many reps of certain exercises she does on one side to compare it with how many she does on the other and they don't always match up. So make sure you count to yourself to make sure you are working both sides of your body equally!

Like everyone else said, you do need a small towel and light hand weights to do these exercises, but thankfully I already had those things before I started.

Overall, I would recommend.

**UPDATE**
I forgot to say, I noticed a few of the reviewers saying the format of this DVD is choppy, but it definitely is not. There are two menus you can go to on the main menu for the workouts. One is the plain old workouts menu in which you can individually choose what workout you want to do. OR, and I am thinking this is the part they missed, you can go to custom workout and select up to three workouts you want to do and they will play continuously.",1400457600,17,2750,4.157894736842105
4247874,4,B0042AM386,"I bought this video because I had a cold and couldn't handle cardio, but knew I could still strength train.  This video is great because it tightens your body without wearing you out.  And I love her attitude!",1398816000,2,209,4.473684210526316

4247878,5,B0042AM386,she is great very good work out video you can feel the burn the day and day after the work out very good and fun,1396915200,,112,3.52
4247879,5,B0042AM386,I really like Denise Austin for some reason. She's peppy. I like to have someone talk to me while I'm working out. Someone to tell me to keep breathing.,1395014400,,152,4.275862068965517
4247880,4,B0042AM386,"I bought this DVD because I wanted a good workout for my butt and thighs, particularly. I love the layout on this DVD - from the start screen you can mix and match which workouts you want to do that day - 1 is abs, 2 is arms, and 3 is butt and thighs. You can do them in any order and each one is about 15 minutes, so you can do whatever you've got time for. The DVD also has a recommended workout schedule for you if you want to do the 21 day challenge, so that you're not burning yourself out trying to do all three or just focusing on one zone.

The workouts themselves were good, very active and showed me some moves I'd never really seen before. However, I wouldn't call them ""beginner"". I'm 24, in pretty decent shape, and with a bit of yoga and Pilates experience, and I had trouble keeping up with what they were doing at first. I have since loaned the DVD to my 42-year-old friend who has a weight problem and lupus because she was looking for some moves to tone her arms, since she's lost a lot of weight recently. I thought this would give her some good ideas for some moves but warned her she probably won't be able to do everything because of her lupus. She has since said that she does like the DVD but because Denise doesn't give much direction on moves, such as telling you if you should be going to the left or right, or how many times to do a move, she gets confused and has to pause it a lot. On the plus side, she said she has lost two pounds since starting it and she's feeling more toned in the lat area. Plus, Denise and the other ladies move so quick without breaking down the moves first that less coordinated people might struggle to see what they're doing.

My other problem with the DVD is that they don't tell you that you need a small towel and a set of hand weights before you start, and I didn't see it mentioned on the DVD box, either. This wasn't a huge deal for me, since I just used an old t-shirt instead of a towel and I had a set of hand weights already, but I could see it being a problem if you don't already have a set of weights at home.

Overall, I liked this DVD. It has variety, it's challenging without being too difficult if you've done a bit of yoga and Pilates before, and it made me feel good. I didn't see much change in my body, but maybe my abs got a little more sculpted. You probably won't see anything drastic in just three weeks though. However, it's not great for true beginners because the moves aren't broken down and go pretty quick. Make sure you have a towel (or old t-shirt or something) handy for the ab section of the workout and a set of small hand weights for the arms portion.",1394755200,4,2646,4.114119922630561
4247881,4,B0042AM386,I really enjoy this DVD.  Denise Austin has a very relaxed way of speaking and giving instruction which is nice. The workouts are fun and you can really feel it the next day.  But it's not too hard so you don't want to do it everyday.  I recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to improve flexibility and work on specific parts of the body.,1394064000,,340,4.2
4247882,5,B0042AM386,"First of all, I like Denise Austin. Sure, she may seem a bit hokey sometime in her videos but I like that. It makes working out  bit more entertaining and less of a chore.

Now let me tell you, this workout kicked my butt!  I've been doing pilates for a few years, though nothing hard core, mind you.  However, after doing this video the first time, I was SORE!  And the crazy thing is, I did the core workout and the upper body workout, and the next day, my glutes were so sore!  Crazy, right?  Anyway, I like that on this DVD you can choose one or two or all three workouts at the beginning, and it will play just the ones you select.  You can do core and upper body, core and lower body, upper and lower body, or just one of the three, or all three, and it will play what you select. You don't have to stop and skip to the next workout. Plus, you can workout to just the music with no talking.

If you like pilates, this is a good video. Its a bit of a faster pace than other videos I've seen, and I like it for that. The one thing I don't like is the lady in the background in the video with the six-pack abs....  She makes me wanna go eat a Snickers...",1392768000,17,1157,3.9696969696969697

4247904,1,B0042AM386,I work out alot and thought pilates would be a nice addition to my workout routine.  The exercises were simple enough.  Did not even sweat working out.  Woke up the the next day & could not move my neck.  Severe pain.  Using the towel under the neck to do ab exercises hyperextened my neck & stretched the muscles & tendons in all the wrong ways.  Very sad that it did not work out.  I will stick to regular aerobics.,1390953600,3,417,4.2025316455696204
4247905,4,B0042AM386,"I love to walk, but not in the cold or snow!  So I purchased this to do light exercises every second day at home.  I love it.  I feel warmed up and stretched.  Even noticed I'm feeling trimmer and more energetic.  There are three sessions of 15 mins in duration each.  I've only done the first one but I'm now ready to move on to doing two sessions back to back.  This us not for the person who likes to sweat and jump around.  It's more gentle but you sure do feel sore the day after your first go!",1389830400,,499,3.9696969696969697

4247908,3,B0042AM386,"So this really isn't much of a Pilates workout as it is basic circuit training. Three 15 minute workouts with a focus on core, arms, and lower body respectively. The tempo is faster and the routines are varied quickly with a very small repetition of each workout. Your personal style will determine if you like this. The dvd does use props, so have a towel and weights handy. While not the most intensive you will feel this (especially if you increase the weight in the arm routine). And while each workout has a focus, she does make an effort to incorporate the total body.

I am not a fan of her coaching style and her voice and mannerisms are a little grating. But this is easily fixed by selecting the option of music only, for which I'm very thankful. There isn't any excitement or great challenge here, so if you are bored easily with your standard workout video, I'd find something else.

However, she is very positive and I like her whole vibe. I like that the video is in 15 minute sessions. I can focus on some or all of the workout sessions if I am pressed for time. I am in shape but now that I have hit 40 I needed help to lose a couple of inches in trouble spots, and I didn't want to add more miles to my runs.

The next video wasn't any better. I did not get a workout (the videos are only about 15 minutes long and basically consist of swishing your arms around) and even the stretches were sub-par.

4247949,4,B0042AM386,"When I first popped in the DVD & started following the exercise routine, I thought, ""this is too easy"". I was used to another Pilates DVD, by another instructor, that takes over one hour to complete, from start to finish. It was quite a challenge, but having grown a bit bored with the same old routine, I ordered Denise Austin's Pilates DVD.  I really like her; some people think she is too peppy, but it is sincere and it keeps me going! She is highly motivational. Plus she is about my age, and I keep thinking, ""Yes, it IS possible to look like that, even now!"" Anyway, the routine seemed to fly by, and by the end I had broken a sweat, but still thought that perhaps it was not a hard enough workout. Well, the next day it seemed as though I could feel ALL the muscles in my body! Not a bad soreness, but like they had indeed been woken up! Plus I like how, if stretched for time, you can simply choose one 15 segment, to work on, if you don't have time for the whole series. I think that this is a very good workout, and yet DECEPTIVELY easy-looking!",1347926400,3,1056,4.201970443349754
4247950,3,B0042AM386,"My wife likes it. I have tried it and it does seem to give a good ab workout. I'm sure that Denise Austin is a wonderful person, but she annoys the crap out of me. She is a weirdo and an airhead.... Also she is instructing the video with a group of women. Most of them are dressed as normal people would dress. One of them is dressed more skantily and she gets a lot more attention from the camera, and Austin, than the others do. Seems awkard",1334966400,2,443,4.045454545454546

I work out on a treadmill for an hour and twenty minutes per day and do this video three to four times per week and I have seen results after one month!  The workout for the tummy and waistline is especially effective.  I have lost at least two inches off of my waistline.  This IS possible, even for women going through that weight gain during menopause - you just have to work at it.  Of course, you have to watch those empty carbs, too!  The arm exercises are also good.  Can you believe it?  In your 50's, you can actually get cellulite on your ARMS????  Well, after a month or so, you WILL see some definition with this workout.  Denise is in her best form, here, too, and very likeable.",1334188800,53,796,4.171052631578948

Maybe I need something way more advanced. The leg and arm potion of this is pretty ok. The ab section is a JOKE. Way too easy. Even a beginner would laugh at the ab section. If she performed more reps than this would be much better, maybe even effective. In fact I actually like the ab exercises, but she does like 5 reps so you feel nothing. Also she does not give any direction so ....you may want to view it first or be familar with pilates before you begin. If you want a good ab workout do anything by Cindy Whitmarsh. She is the best trainer I have seen so far.",1325635200,,724,3.9657534246575343

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wish they were 20 minute segments instead of 15, but I would definatley recommend this DVD.

I do yoga / pilates DVDs 3 or 4 times a week and this was a great addition to my collection.  I love Denise's workouts because they don't kill you but you totally get results.  This fits in line with that theme.",1321401600,7,353,3.9295774647887325
4247978,4,B0042AM386,"I bought this dvd because I have been using Jillian Michaels dvds and feel I am bulking up instead of stretching out. I had Denise Austins pilates and yoga videos when my children were younger and I kept tone and the weight off. Now I feel as if I can't lose weight and I am bulky. I have always enjoyed Denise's approach, and feel Jillian is a brute with boobs. Yes, her videos shape and define, but I like a lean, tone look and feel Denise's pilates gives me that. I think you can get the benefit depending on what you put into it---tighten your muscules, push yourself more into the pose. I definitely don't think this is targeted toward a beginner, although it would be a great video to challenge you. I consider myself to be in good shape, and feel the different muscles moving with both this dvd and her yoga dvd.  I am frustrated with Jillian and although see results in muscle tone, I do not see it in becoming more lean.",1319587200,28,929,4.308571428571429
4247979,4,B0042AM386,"This workout is definitely more low-key than Austin's other productions. I have her Hit the Spot Pilates DVD and it provides a heavier, more Pilates-based workout than this one; however, both are very effective.

If you are desiring more crunches and ab-focused exercises, go with Hit the Spot Pilates. If you want an easier Pilates workout, I'd highly recommend this one.

Either way, Denise Austin is the way to go. I have tried other Pilates workouts from various instructors and they do not provide the same post-exercise-good-feeling like Austin does. She knows her stuff!

Side note: For this DVD, you will need a towel and light weights for the exercises. For her other Pilates DVD, no props are necessary.",1316217600,9,713,4.974789915966387

4247982,5,B0042AM386,"I loved this work out! It worked every angle & every muscle in my body, without me even feeling it. During the work out, I felt challenged but it really didn;t feel like a work out. It was fun & didn't seem too strenuos.  I had no idea what a great work out I was raelly getting, and I like that.  It seem too easy but I assure you, youw ill feel it the next day!
 I have back & knees issues so I have to avoid anything high impact, or that puts too much stress on either.  I was doing 30 Day Shred & Ripped in 30, but they were too hard on my knees & back. I have done Pilates for a  while & was looking for a new Pilates work out that could challenge me.  This one definitely did.  As I said, I didn't feel it during the moves, which is nice, but the next day I felt it every where! My abs hurt even when I laugh, and I'm talking lower abs, mid abs, & obliques! My legs & butt are sore as well.  My arms really didn't get a good work out, but that's because I did 2.5 lb weights,as Denise recommends.  I switched to 5 lb weights at the end & that felt like a bigger challenge.
I have been a fan of Denise's since the early to mid 90's & she never disapoints.  This & Hit the Spot Pilates are two of my fav videos now.",1310601600,2,1219,3.782608695652174
4247993,5,B0042AM386,"I am honestly surprised beyond all relief at the reviews that state that this workout is ""ineffective"" and ""geriatric style"". I honestly don't see my 87 year old grandmother being able to do these workouts! All I can think of is that these reviewers are already in extraordinarily good shape or highly experienced at Pilates.
I am neither of these- this is my first foray into Pilates and while I consider myself in pretty good shape, I am definitely not one of those background people in an exercise DVD. I have paired the 21 day plan on this DVD with one workout from Denise's Hot Body Yoga most days. I, like other reviewers, was doubtful of the effectiveness of so few repetitions. However, I was pleasantly surprised- after just a few times of just Shrink Your Fat Zones alone, I noticed that my inner thighs- my most stubborn ""fat zone""- were already getting more toned and I am experiencing less chafing from them rubbing together while I walk. After trying multiple workouts and multiple DVDs, this is the fastest and most profound results I have ever experienced. Ineffective, my foot!
I admit I don't work out every day. I watch what I eat, but I don't believe in dieting. And approximately 10 days into my modified 21 day plan, I have already lost over 5 pounds and see differences in my body that previous workout DVDs couldn't give me. While my modification contributes to this, I wouldn't be able to achieve this result if half my workout was ""ineffective.""  I also admit I couldn't stand Denise at first- but I stuck with her and she's definitely made me a believer.",1306713600,133,1581,4.646428571428571
4247994,5,B0042AM386,"I'm new to pilates. I love this DVD. There are three workouts. One for core, one for arms and upper body, and one for legs and lower body all 15 minutes each. I found them all challenging enough (the arms one being the most challenging for me). I was even a bit sore the next day. (The GOOD sore!) Some of the moves were just pushing to the limit of ""I don't think I can"". But most of it I could! I didn't find too much of the DVD a bore or too easy.

The only downside is her voice. LOL She talks funny (the way she says things...""And oooooooookay here we go!"" and all the girls in the back look like robots.

I'd recommend it to anyone in the ""advanced beginner"" stage. This might be a but much if it's your first pilates DVD.",1306454400,2,728,4.0137931034482754

Shrink Your Fat Zones Pilates is just challenging enough to let you know you're actually ""doing something"", but not so difficult that you dread doing it on a regular basis. I use this video on days when I'm not doing cardio (usually 2X per week for the last 2 months) and I can really see the difference in my body. What I love most is what is has done for my rear end. I've always envied women with those perfectly rounded and lifted ""pilates"" buns and now I have them.",1301356800,39,567,4.2592592592592595
4247997,3,B0042AM386,"I've read the reviews over this...someone mentioned how there isn't enough repetitions. They're correct. There really isn't! For instance she only asks you do 5 bicep curls with the weight. BUT I've been using this dvd for a week and I really do feel the burn and feel a difference in my strength. It's nice to have an instructor who you're not SCREAMING at to change exercises because your arms are about to fall off from doing 50 bicep curls.
What I do is just pause the video, do a few more repetitions of certain exercises, then press play. It's not that big of a deal.

Bottom Line: Good workout, I feel the burn! You might have to alter it a tad by adding more repetitions to see SERIOUS results.",1299196800,3,702,4.4
4247998,2,B0042AM386,"These are new exercises from Denise, but are very basic and boring.  A lot of the exercises are simple pilates moves with a twist, such as her adding the towel in the abs section.  I used a resistance band.  Other than not having an introduction on how to do Pilates, I would recommend this for a beginner.

It is broken down into 3 sections with a 1-2 minute warm-up/cooldown in each one.  I did break a minor sweat.  Although she recomended 1-5 lbs weights, I found you can use heavier weights on some of the arm exercises.  She does a lot of side bends for the obliques, which are pretty worthless if you do ab exercises regularly.  She tries to incorporate the lower body during the arm exercises, but it doesn't feel very effective.  The leg section is also pretty basic... doesn't feel like Pilates.  Just feels like lunges and lifts.

I would recommend Hit the Spot Pilates and Mat Work Based on JH Pilates if you wanted a more effective and challenging workout from Denise.  Pilates for Everybody is also pretty decent.",1296086400,6,1027,4.551912568306011

I am lucky if I get an hour a day, so I want that hour workout to be worthwhile. In this DVD, the repetitions are very low--maybe 3-5. It's like taking a tiny sip of each exercise. This will not shrink any fat zones, I am afraid. Also, because Austin presents this as three mini-workouts, there is no unified warmup/stretch nor cooldown/stretch, and I really miss that.

There are so many more effective mat/Pilates style workouts. I do like the idea of Pilates for days that I don't want to do aerobics or lift weights--Pilates IS a very effective form of exercise to tighten muscles of the body. But, you will not sweat a drop during this workout, so no one's fat zone will be melting. If you want to melt, try aerobics or weight-bearing exercise. If you want to tighten, try Pilates. But, do yourself a favor and try another Pilates DVD. I highly recommend Tracy Effinger for serious matwork that gives results.",1294099200,14,1070,4.544041450777202

I thought it was too easy.  There were a few moves that I really liked a lot, but she doesn't spend enough time on each move.  She only does a particular move a couple times on each side so you don't get a chance to feel the burn.  One reviewer complained about her voice.

I've used other pilates/yoga videos that have truly resulted in toning and slimming, but this one just didn't do anything for me at all. I bought it to change up my routine, and while I enjoyed the pace, I found simple things about it to be annoying. For starters, the number of repetitions is not consistent from the left side to the right side for many of the exercises. It also seems like there are not enough repetitions for certain exercises. Overall, it's a pretty easy-going, light routine and I guess if your goal is to simply move your body, this accomplishes that.
