5538842,1,B00B0325MM,"If I could give half a star, I would. Among some things missing (and there are MANY): 5 or 6 McCartney performances, including his performance with the surviving members of Nirvana; half of Billy Joel's set; one or two Bon Jovi songs, most notably ""Livin' On a Prayer""; over half of The Who's set, including ""Pinball Wizard"" and other hits; some of Bruce Springsteen's performances, etc. etc.

And we all know this was broadcast in sparkling HD, so a lossless video/audio release would have been essential to me purchasing this anyway. You have the technology: use it. I'd rather donate all the money to Sandy Relief than only a portion in return for this half-baked attempt to capture a phenomenal night of music, comedy and charity.",1379203200,37,734,4.825396825396825
5538843,1,B00B0325MM,"Why won't they release the entire concert?! This is very disappointing! I have been waiting for a DVD to be released hoping that it would be better than the abbreviated CD, but I guess not! Why not make a ""delux"" edition then and put out the whole concert? As much as I would hate to have to spend more money simply because it would be ""delux"" but I would so I could have all of the show!",1378944000,46,388,4.0519480519480515
5538844,2,B00B0325MM,"WOW! We were all hoping for A LOT more! Of course we all expected them to do some sort of release and get some more money for the cause by releasing a CD/DVD, but this is far less than it should have been. I actually think they've hurt themselves because a lot of people will probably download the performances off of bootlegged recordings instead to get the stuff they want. There are some good moments included, but some of the best have been left off. For me, the biggest let down was the lone McCartney track. Getting his performance was the whole reason I looked into this set in the first place. It's especially astonishing because of the exclusion of his performance with the surviving Nirvana members. I like the idea of donating to Robin Hood Relief, but I really don't think I want this set. What a missed opportunity.",1378425600,29,828,4.526666666666666

5538866,4,B00B0325MM,"When the Live Aid dvd came out about ten years ago,most people could understand that there were missing performances-missing artists even. (though i still am upset that Zeppelin couldn't give in and not worry about their image for once,it was the spirit of the day. And i miss the CSNY reunion...etc) The tapes were 20 years old,at least the tapes that survived. We got almost all that Geldof had to show us.

But for a concert held in 2012,to have a mere 2 1/2 hours from a 6 hour show is ludicrous. Commercial time,fine. Editing artists down to 3 songs or so..alright. But were missing Kanye West's ENTIRE performance. And have but only one song from McCartney? The members of Nirvana were there,but you wouldnt know it. Its a nice little disc as a sampler,but haven't the Robin Hood people seen the demand for a more full concert? its for charity,and were willing. Where's the downside here?

Here's a small suggestion

Still,its a good concert,and a  good cause. The Who almost steal the show,same as the Concert For New York City. Springsteen has youthful energy, and Alicia Keys stuns,both in beauty and passion. Chris Martin is,delightful. And the jersey boy himself doesnt disappoint. Some of the speakers are hit or miss. Crystal finds a good balance,and Colbert is Colbert. Buscemi does a good job with his segment,its clear that the audience is quite 'refreshed' by that time. Oy,Kristen Stewart though. All the personality of a beach towel. At least Jimmy Fallon exerts some gushing awe.

5538872,1,B00B0325MM,"The fine print on the jacket says it is FROM the concert.
Don't waste your money on this if you are looking for the concert closer to the version that aired on cable.  This DVD contains less than half the songs in the full concert set list.
I don't know why they bothered. I'd much rather pay for a multi-DVD set of the full concert.
This DVD drops things like Springsteen performing with Bon Jovi.
This DVD has ONE Paul McCartney performance.
In the concert he did EIGHT, including 2 with the likes of Diana Krall, Dave  Grohl, Krist Novoselic and  Pat Smear.
If you want the real concert, maybe Palladia will air it again so you can record a decent version.
It's not this one.",1388188800,,678,4.365079365079365
5538873,5,B00B0325MM,"I don't know why the artists and their management could not agree to provide the entire epic concert, but the song list was clear as to what was included, so I am not sure why people are complaining.  I would have made different choices of what to include, but I am sure legal issues had to be considered.",1387238400,,305,4.258620689655173
5538874,2,B00B0325MM,"Well, This is disappointing.  I did record the entire concert in 1080p HD, and the audio was 5.1 using my PVR, which is a high end PC with a Ceton PCIe card and M-card.  I use Sage-TV (MS Media center uses a WTC format file and it is a PIA to convert. Sage writes a H.264 MP4 file with original resolution and audio.  I pulled a bit down and ran it through Mac-X DVD Creator pro, which will generate an ,iso file from the MP4, or a .BRK if you are going BluRay.  It sounded and looked great.  I suppose I will do the entire concert.  Mac-X DVD will automatically mark the commercials as well, and you can delete them.  Comparing the .BRK my media player plays to this DVD and there is some quality loss.  But all in all, I think I rather have the entire concert as a DVD at 1080p 5.1 audio.  It looks like it will be 2 DVD's if I use Dual-layer (e.g. 3 DVD equiv).

I am glad to have this, but I am also glad I kept the full show. Just to have it all.",1386374400,,951,3.90625
5538875,1,B00B0325MM,This could arguably be called the concert of the century and this DVD could arguably be called the botched DVD release of the century.

5538876,3,B00B0325MM,"After reading all of these reviews, it is quite clear that most people don't know how the entertainment business works. Everything that went on the DVD had to be approved by multiple people and entities...and ""NO"" was a frequent answer. Sometimes from the artist, sometimes from the manager, sometimes from the label, sometimes from a lawyer. So don't take it out on The Robin Hood Foundation and relief efforts.",1384300800,6,412,4.9855072463768115

5538878,3,B00B0325MM,"Would have been a 5 star review if there was more Bruce and fewer appeals from a few stars of the moment who didn't do their presentations with skill, heart or conviction.  On the other hand, there was Springsteen and two songs are better than none.  Alicia Keyes, the only woman performer featured, was her usual beautiful and fabulous self.

Nothing. The Who - clipped in their prime. Over, done. No Bell Boy, no Pinball Wizard/See Me Feel Me with the amazing footage. Glad I only rented for 48 hours. This is a total rip off.
