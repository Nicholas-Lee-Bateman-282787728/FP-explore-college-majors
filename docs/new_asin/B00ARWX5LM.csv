5495067,5,B00ARWX5LM,"WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD: Before we get to the review, a little background about the film and director/co-producer/co-writer David DeCoteau. This was one of the last films to be shown as a double feature in theaters (with SLAVE GIRLS FROM BEYOND INFINITY - 1987) and CREEPOZOIDS was the bottom half of the double bill but, for me, the film should have been at the top half because it still holds a fond place in my heart for showing what one man can do with so little money. Sure, there are indications of an ultra-low-budget (A lab that consists of nothing but a computer and two aquariums filled with colored water; filming in one location; a cast of five people, etc.), but it was just such a crazy-a** film that even Fred Olen Ray directed a remake of the film, called HYBRID, in 1996. And then there's David DeCoteau. He made no secret that he was gay because he made a series of all-male porn (as well as straight porn) films before he got into the genre filmmaking business. He continued to make adult films while directing his first few genre films (his first one was DREAMANIAC in 1986 and this was his second), but his genre career took off like no one had ever seen before (as of 2015, he has directed over 115 genre films (not counting his adult films), and that's not counting the hundreds of other ones he worked on in various other capacities) and during the 80's & 90's, he gave straight people what they wanted: naked female flesh mixed with violence. But as gay rights began to gain steam in this country (and it was about time), David DeCoteau formed his own production company, Rapid Heart Pictures, and began to make homoerotic films of all types for audiences that would appreciate them. They were (and are) never hardcore, but they never shied away from the gay subtext, either. As a straight man, I applaud him for that fact, but he also kept making films for straight audiences, too. A lot of people consider David DeCoteau a hack (don't get me wrong, he has made his share of stinkers; but with that many films under his belt, how could he not?), but we are talking about a man who worked since he was just a young buck with such people as Roger Corman, Charles Band and Fred Olen Ray and whenever I read that he is moderating or doing a running commentary on a film, even if it's a film I don't like, I buy it on DVD or Blu-Ray, because this is a man who knows more about filmmaking than 99.9% of the people in the business and his commentaries are pure gold. I have had the pleasure of communicating with David a few times on Facebook and he has always come across as a pure gentleman and always answered questions like he wasn't talking down to you. A person like that is very rare commodity in the business and he should be celebrated. Which brings us to the film at hand. There is only one thing that really bugged me about this film: Linnea Quigley had no problems doffing her clothes in this film, yet adult film star Ashlyn Gere (here using the name ""Kim McKamy"") never appeared nude. I guess she wanted to be taken seriously as an actress, but this was the wrong vehicle for that. People come to see films like this for the nudity and the violence, so I tip my hat to Linnea Quigley for spending a good amount of her screen time unclothed to make up for McKamy staying clothed (there was one point in the film where I thought McKamy was going to get naked when she turned the shower on, but it was nothing but a cheat). After watching an unnamed scientist (Joi Wilson) getting killed in her bare-bones laboratory set by a tall creature with giant pincers around its mouth, we are informed by on-screen computer terminal-like writing that in 1998, six years after the superpowers have engaged in a devastating nuclear exchange, Earth is now a blackened husk of a planet. Tiny clusters of survivors eke out a miserable existence in the ruins of the city, and bands of military deserters roam the barren wastelands...hiding from mutant nomads and seeking shelter from the deadly acid rain. We then meet five deserters: Bianca (Quigley; SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT - 1984; also an associate producer); Butch (Ken Abraham; BLOODY MOVIE - 1988); Jesse (Michael Aranda; EL CHUPACABRA - 2003), Kate (McKamy; EVIL LAUGH - 1986) and Jake (Richard Hawkins; CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND - 1977), as they are trying to find shelter from a fast approaching acid rain storm. They make it just in time in the building that just happens to hold the lab where we saw the lady scientist killed by the creature, so we know that they are not alone. Since they are military deserters, they still know how to clear a building, so they split up into two groups and search the entire building (some of the rooms just don't look kosher to Bianca), but all they find is a rotting head of the scientist's assistant and nothing else. When Bianca finds a working shower, she is ready to strip and has Butch join her. We see them both completely naked, before and after the shower (something for both the guys and the girls!). Jesse is using the lab's computer to try and learn what they were working on there. Was this a military base or a private enterprise? After trying to break into the computer's files with no success (his access is always denied), he finds the scientist's computer journals, where it says she was purposely cut off from communicating with New L.A. (over 400 miles away) and she is worried that New L.A. is in serious trouble. She mentions some new experimental ""stuff"" that scares the s*** out of her. If this ""stuff"" is added to food, she has no idea what serious repercussions that it will have to those who eat it. Jesse hears a noise coming from under the desk and discovers a secret passageway, which leads to a room that looks like it is full of giant cocoons. While Jessie is crawling into the lair, the computer screen changes and reads, ""Long time no see. No one suspects a thing. Covered my tracks like a pro. The blood was a b***h to clean."" Jesse enters the room and sticks his hand in a puddle of blood, before the creature attacks him and we think Jesse is dead. But, when morning comes, Jesse awakens from his bed like he has no memory of what happened the night before. A shirtless Butch sleeps with a topless Bianca when everyone is awakened for breakfast, made by Kate. Jake wants to do a more complete recon of the building to see how long they can stay there (food supplies, water, etc.) when Jesse begins to scream and starts to mutate in front of everyone (the fingers on his hands fuse together) and he spits some black liquid out of his mouth and dies face-down into his breakfast dish. Kate then says she believes that this building is some kind of containment vessel. It was not meant to keep people out, but to keep something in. This building was meant to keep the outside world safe and she believes they are all now infected with a virus where the body produces its own amino acids, which means they will never have to eat food again (Jesse overdosed when he ate breakfast [no one else had the chance to eat yet] and it not only mutated him, it killed him). Jake and Butch go to the lair, while Bianca does some investigating on her own and his nearly killed by the creature. Jake is found unconscious, but when he comes to, he believes the creature doesn't want to kill anyone. It looks like the creature was once human and wants another person to mutate like him so they can start a new intelligent species on Earth. The generator goes out and Butch goes to fix it, but he is attacked by a huge mother of a rat, so Jake pulls it off Butch and kills it with a ray gun. The creature attacks Jake (always, and I mean always, check under your desk) when he tries to send an SOS on the computer. The creature, which not only has pincers on the side of its mouth but extremely huge sharp teeth, attacks Butch, so now both Butch and Jake are out like a light while the creature destroys the computer, knocking out all communication with the outside world. The creature drags Butch away, but what does he really want from them (It seems Kate's reason just doesn't wash)? Another giant rat attacks Bianca (even crawling up the back of her shirt, but Kate pulls it off and gets bitten in the neck. Jake shows up and patches her up. The creature has dragged Butch into its lair, where it sprays black liquid on Butch from its mouth. He mutates in front of everyone's eyes when they hear him scream and then he dies. The creature tries to attack Jake and Bianca, but they get away. Bianca has discovered Kate has transformed into a mutant and she tries to kill Bianca. You don't mess with Bianca unless you want to get the horns and she kills the mutated Kate by dropping a metal shelf on her and stepping on it hard until Kate stops breathing. The creature brings Jake down to its lair and then kills Bianca. Jake runs away and finds a medical kit on a shelf and puts something into a huge hypodermic needle. After the creature nearly kills Jake several times, Jake finally injects it with the hypodermic needle and the creature dies, breaking into pieces. In the part of the film people remember most about this film, one piece of the creature delivers a mutated baby, which tries to kill Jake. Jake thinks he chokes the baby to death with its own umbilical cord but, as the final shot shows us, the baby gets up and the film freezes on its image.  As you can imagine, the story makes no sense at all (DeCocteau wrote the screenplay with Burford Hauser; BLOOD NA$TY - 1989), but it is an entertaining 72 minutes that gave audiences what they wanted: blood, boobs and gore. This was one of Charles Band's Empire Films (he was the uncredited Executive Producer) and it was apparent he gave David DeCoteau very little money and told DeCoteau to give him what audiences wanted, story be damned, This film is just weird enough to merit a viewing (I have seen it about 20 times) and since it was one of DeCoteau's first few horror films (porn directors know how to squeeze every penny out of a buck), he gives us much more on screen then some established genre director would. The success of this film (and a few others), would make DeCoteau a house director at Full Moon when Empire Pictures folded, where he would have to take pseudonyms, like ""Ellen Cabot"" (a credit he used on this film as an Associate Producer), ""Richard Chasen"", ""Julian Breen"", ""Mary Crawford"" , Victoria Sloan"" and at least a half-dozen others so people wouldn't think that DeCoteau was directing 80% of Full Moon's features every year or working in so many capacities on a film (He used the pseudonym ""David McCabe"" when directing all-male and straight adult films and really is a jack-of-all trades when it comes to filmmaking. I doubt there isn't one thing he could do better than most artists). This film packs an awful lot into a small amount of time and makes it one of my guiltiest of pleasures. While David DeCoteau will never win an Academy Award for his body of work, he has given millions of people countless nights of great genre exploitation. David is still working up to this day, so expect to see reviews of his films KNOCK 'EM DEAD and 3 SCREAM QUEENS (both 2014, which I viewed on VOD using my Roku 3 player) on this site very soon.  He sure knows how to put great actors in his films. I recently saw his BIGFOOT VS. D.B. COOPER  and 90210 SHARK ATTACK (also both 2014, a banner year for him) and laughed my ass off at the absurdity of it all. It was obvious DeCoteau was just having fun at/with the audience's expectations with these films and it worked. I can't think of a nicer guy all this success is happening to. Cinematographer/Second Unit Director/Special Effects Supervisor Thomas Calloway directed the ridiculously bad film HEEBIE JEEBIES (2012). You have to see it to believe it (Or read my review by clicking on the link). Released on VHS by Amazing Factory/Cult Video and even though the Full Moon Grindhouse Collection DVD series always get a bad reputation, besides the DVD being in fullscreen, the picture was sharp and looked great on my Blu-Ray and HD TV system. Only their first ten releases looked like they were taken from video masters. Their newer releases look great, so don't let what other people say dissuade you from purchasing the DVD. Rated R.",1446768000,6,12312,4.500446827524575
5495068,5,B00ARWX5LM,"full moon's grindhouse release of ""creepozoids"" on dvd.
This is a great release of a classic B horror/sci-fi film. it is in fullscreen but the picture quality is really good. also there is a cool charles band intro. i was nervous that the picture quality would be poor but was very happy to see very clear picture! if you have not seen ""creepozoids"" and are a fan of b-horror films like ""ghoulies"" or ""troll"" you will more than likely enjoy this cheezy b horror fun flick!
highly recommended.",1414627200,8,492,4.6022727272727275
