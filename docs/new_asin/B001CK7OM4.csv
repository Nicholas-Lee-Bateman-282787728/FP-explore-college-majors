3513857,4,B001CK7OM4,"A well-done film...unfortunately, the information offered in this tale was greatly similar to that of Simon Shama's Power of Art and other written expositions of Rothko's work and life.
The hope, in reading the description, was for more on the museum's acquisition, inherent politics and inside information related to the Tate (again, the title implies the experience of curating and management will be expounded upon). Disappointing only in that no new Rothko info offered, and no inside museum info rendered.",1253577600,6,510,5.3875
3513858,5,B001CK7OM4,"When I finally had the opportunity to see this film on television. I was quite amazed by it. But saddened that it was only an hour long. The interviews are tremendous, as you get to see Kate Rothko sitting in front of a great dark painting of her Father's, as she speaks of him.

I really don't wanna say too much about it. I will let it speak for itself.

One thing I do wanna find out before purchasing this is, are there ANY extras to the DVD version of this. Or is it just a DVD version of what I saw on television?",1238457600,20,519,3.980769230769231

3513866,4,B001CK7OM4,"Interesting film, but there is not much there that's really new to those who are already familiar with that very impressive painter. Most of the comments are simply laudatory. It's worth seeing in any case.",1321747200,3,206,4.914285714285715
3513867,4,B001CK7OM4,"In the late 1940s, Mark Rothko explained, ""The people who weep before my pictures are having the same religious experience as I had when I painted them.""

Of course, he's well known for creating wall-scale abstract paintings that filled the viewer's field of vision and became a form of environment.

With penetrating interviews from his daughter Kate and his son Christopher, this documentary is the best and most clear explanation on the famous Seagram's murals, and his now dedicated room at London's Tate Modern.

Rothko was with the period of Abstract Expressionists who wanted to be unique. Existentialism was a popular influence on the painters' intellectual search.

Imagine sitting in the center of a private room at The Tate, literally surrounded by huge Rothkos and listening to Mozart's Don Giovanni or Brahm's 3rd Symphony. You'll see and hear it all on this well produced DVD.

3513868,4,B001CK7OM4,"It indeed is a fine documentary tracing his steps from the early years into abstract expressionist.  Interesting to note his personal view of both himself and how his art should be viewed.

The photography gives us some real eye-candy to enjoy for the hour as well as stimulating discussion from his daughter and others in the know.",1312243200,9,332,4.807017543859649
3513869,4,B001CK7OM4,"I was a student of Mark Rothko at Brooklyn College and it was ""Mr. Rothko"" who showed me the wonder of creating art.
To me he was kind, generous, and eager for students to understand his very abstract perceptions of painting. Few students did and he had to continuously overcome human hurdles in teaching and in the art world in general.

The film is very well done and I enjoyed seeing the many people speaking about Rothko the artist, parent, and the troubled man, but while it is excellent and I recommend it for all to see, it did not convey how his profound inner life had to reconcile with those around him,  those who did not fully understand what he was trying to achieve. and what he must have suffered inwardly as a lone artistic pioneer. But that is the fate of creative souls. Only after his passing did people realize what a treasure they knew and could have appreciated more while he was alive.

To me Mr. Rothko was always fatherly. He listened to me and took an interest in my work, even though I was a naive girl from Brooklyn. He listened because I appreciated what he had to say. How many in the art world - gallery owners, and fellow painters -- were really interested then in his esoteric ideas of color, shape, and space and how these artistic elements convey the profound forces of nature in our physical world.

Thank you,
Roberta Carasso, Ph. D.",1287878400,111,1370,4.468

8288025,5,B001CK7OM4,"Dont be fooled by the opening sequence: Rothkos Rooms is a fascinating documentary with much more ambition and scope than its avowed goal of telling us how a set of nine Rothko murals found their way to the Tate Gallery. Those murals do provide a unifying theme for the movie, beyond the obvious idea of making a documentary about Rothko, and help keep it focused on the concept of Rothko place or Rothko environment that was so dear to Rothko in his lifetime.

Rothko had very specific ideas about how his works should be exhibited, and the idea of exhibiting them as a group was extremely dear to him. The paintings shown first at the Tate Gallery and later at Tate Modern were part of a set of thirty Rothko had originally painted for the Four Seasons restaurant in the Seagram Building in New York City, before he backed out of the commission and returned the money. (We are told that Rothko, who leaned toward Socialism, thought the restaurants workers would be able to see his murals from their canteen or on their way to it, and he was incensed when he learned they would hang in the upper level of the restaurant itself, above the heads of wealthy patrons.)

The movie shows us many stills of Rothkos paintings throughout his career, allowing us to take stock of the evolution he underwent from his figurative painting phase to his surrealist one to more abstract works that meld into those of the multi-form period, to the focus on color of the mid-1940s to the late-1940s,  until the rectangular forms Rothko is best known for, which he painted from about 1949 onwards.

The movie also benefits from many testimonials of key members of the art world such as Sean Scully, Phyllis Lambert and Philip Johnson who had commissioned the murals for the Seagram building, and the director of the Tate Gallery when Rothko gave his paintings, Sir Norman Reid (he has a wonderful anecdote regarding why Rothko, who was famously indecisive, finally agreed in November 1969 to donate his paintings to the Tate after six years of negotiation  Ill give you a hint: it has something to do with a tax change), Rothkos friends and collaborators, and finally Rothkos both children, who speak thoughtfully and convincingly about their father and his art.

The first half of this 60-minute documentary are spent on general yet highly informative considerations about Rothkos life, his working habits as an artist and his paintings, such as the contrast of the New York urban landscape and the immensity of Rothkos best-known paintings, as well as the influence of the Southwest on the colors he used. The movie changes focus at the halfway mark when it starts delving in more detail into the Seagram murals, Rothkos continued efforts to create a Rothko environment, how nine of the thirty Seagram murals found their way to the Tate Gallery, and Rothkos suicide.

The thread of the sense of a Rothko place is convincingly weaved through the narrative, not only for the Seagram building but also for the Rothko Room in the Phillips Collection in DC, which came about shortly after the Seagram commission fell through, the Rothko Chapel in Houston, and the New York City studio where Rothko painted those murals, which has become a Japanese teahouse. I found it particularly poignant that the people at the Tate Gallery heard of Rothkos passing the day the paintings finally arrived.

This is a must-own for anyone interested in Rothko.",1487116800,5,3422,4.817717206132879

8288032,5,B001CK7OM4,"See my review on the Robert Motherwell documentary.  The same applies for this documentary as well.  One of the more interesting things that I noticed about the successful artists from the New York school of Abstract Expressionism is that many of them suffered from what we would today refer to as bipolar disease.  This caused much mental disorder, alcoholism, and caused several of the more prominent of them to commit suicide.  Tragic, yes, but part of what it requires to be a great artist, it seems.  Some of the greatest of all time where bipolar: from van Gogh to Pollock, Toulouse-Lautrec to Mark Rothko, while many others suffered some form of mental disease/disorder.  An unfortunate byproduct of genius?  Lord, I hope not. ;-)",1426550400,2,737,4.943089430894309
