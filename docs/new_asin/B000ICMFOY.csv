8145067,5,B000ICMFOY,"The moon ""landing"" was pure fiction, or the one we were presented with on TV was, I'm sure there is a black(magic) ops space program. The purpose of the big show was to steal 30+ Billion 1960s Dollars for black(magic) ops programs(criminal), a diversion from the Opium War that was Vietnam(also designed to bring drug addicted/damaged vets back to America) and Ra-Ra propaganda for the very gullible masses. This only adds to the lie of ""official"" history as brainwashed to us by the Rockefeller controlled General Education Board. You see America is fully infiltrated, and has been for at least 100 years, by evil fascist banksters and their occult satanist masters in the City of London as well as the Jesuits for the purpose of being a forerunner in a Fascist NWO that is global. This is mostly an extension of their very real satanist religion based on cognitive dissonance, opposites are equaled, nonsense is sense, Alice in Wonderland/Wizard of Oz type of logic. The logic of the Devil. Anybody who does their own leg work can see this and the very dangerous phase the world is entering. Babylon Rising.",1400284800,,1109,4.842105263157895
8145068,4,B000ICMFOY,"The premise of ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" is that the Apollo moon landing(s) were faked, nothing but a movie shot by Stanley Kubrick in his studio in London, not long after he filmed ""2001:  A Space Odyssey.""  That's the cue for everyone to start laughing, since of course the moon landings really happened!  And the interviews of Henry Kissinger, showing him chuckling, and Kubrick's widow telling how it all went down, and the general interviewed in French (who mysteriously died shortly after giving it), although tantalizing, are ambiguous.  They aren't really saying the Apollo moon landings were faked.

But when you remember NASA ""lost"" all the camera footage from the moon landings, and we've never been back (was the technology that much better in 1968?), the premise that the landings WERE a hoax gains much more traction.  In my view, this movie is no spoof.  Kissinger is laughing because we're all such suckers.

Dave McGowan's online series ""Wagging the Moondoggie"" is recommended for additional substantial evidence that the moon landings were faked.",1393200000,,1066,5.086206896551724
8145069,5,B000ICMFOY,"I had a chance to tape this movie on Swiss Televion last weekend, and watched twice, the first time I was ah and oh, and could not believe what I had just watched, so I watched it a second time fully through and had the greatest laugh. I don't want to give anything away, however I recommand to watch the movie until the credits are over, then you will have the greatest laugh. - To bad the docu is currently not available on DVD.",1245888000,3,430,4.130952380952381
