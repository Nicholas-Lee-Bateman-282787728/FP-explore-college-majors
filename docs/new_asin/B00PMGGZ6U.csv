8688831,5,B00PMGGZ6U,"If you like samba music, Raca Negra and/or A. Pires, you will love this DVD or CD. Great music from the first to the last. Besides the wonderful singers, the band is terrific. I just returned from Brasil and this album was advertised constantly on TV so bought my copy there. I love it.",1421193600,,286,4.314814814814815
