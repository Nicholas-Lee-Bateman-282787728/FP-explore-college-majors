8579997,1,B00CBNV6KM,"Sometimes, a movie is so poorly done, acted, shot, etc., that it can be fun to watch and laugh at. This stinker is soooo bad, the viewer is saddened for the writer, producer, actors, cameramen, soundmen, editors....... Wow. High school classes never popped out one this bad, in every regard.",1388966400,,291,4.84
8579998,1,B00CBNV6KM,"A puppet show has more acting bravado and depth than this waste of time. A stunning forte of boredom, cheesy acting, vampires dressed in Walmart $9.99 suits that hobble down stairs and move with all the speed of a constipated slug toward their prey. The only scary part of this drivel is knowing you've wasted more than a nanosecond watching it. Here's the movie in cliff notes: Pan up to the actors face when they say anything, sound a gong, and sludge through the misery of a script written by a dolt. Now you know where ex-porn actors go when they get sacked for not having a shred of acting ability in an industry that doesn't even require it.",1388361600,2,647,4.445378151260504
8579999,1,B00CBNV6KM,"This movie just totally sucked! Some rated b movies are ok but this was very disappointing! The preview looked good but the reality of this movie was poor, just bad acting and the storyline was poor as well!",1388188800,,207,4.473684210526316
8580000,2,B00CBNV6KM,"Johnny Dust (Jasen Wade) is a divorced Tuscon film and western show actor. He has an ex-wife (Shannon Whirry), daughter (Ariel Myers) and a wannabe girlfriend (Anglica Celaya). The studio set is taken over by a new owner who opens the mine. A new Halloween show is in order, which includes real vampires, and rubber ghoul faced creatures.

The idea is not half bad, the problem was the characters were sadly cardboard with trite dialog. The film couldn't bring home the horror. Not much of a cowboy film or vampire film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity . Also the same film as ""Cowboys and Vampires"" from 2010.",1387929600,,620,4.678899082568807
8580001,1,B00CBNV6KM,The title should tell you everything you should want to know. It also looks like it was made with a budget of ten dollars. Only for fans of really bad films.,1386115200,,157,4.096774193548387
