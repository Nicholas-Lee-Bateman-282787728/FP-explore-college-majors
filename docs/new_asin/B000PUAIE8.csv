2828271,5,B000PUAIE8,"My favorite part of this movie are the Lions. The song ""I'm a Vegetarian Now"" makes me smile every time.  I also enjoy the song ""Because of Thee"" sung by Daniel in prayer. It will make you laugh and cry and learn more about this great bible story than you thought you knew!",1179446400,,273,4.150943396226415

2828282,5,B000PUAIE8,I really enjoyed this version of the account of Daniel. Was unable to find it in many Christian stores and was happy to finally find it again.,1399939200,,142,4.296296296296297
2828283,5,B000PUAIE8,"While these movies are a bit silly, my kids adore them and beg to watch them. We have a few and this is my daughter's favorite (age 6). She loves the songs and always sings along to them. They are a fun way to teach the Bible stories.",1393372800,3,234,3.8958333333333335
2828284,5,B000PUAIE8,We gave this a five star rating because it is an excellent product!  Great music and a wonderful message.  Our children and grandchildren are in love!,1391126400,2,150,4.730769230769231
2828285,1,B000PUAIE8,"I gave it a zero because it was so poorly made low budget I was so disappointed when I seen it was a play
 with horrible actorsI want my money back",1390694400,,147,3.7419354838709675
2828286,1,B000PUAIE8,"Your children may enjoy this play , adults might not stay awake , it's a real yawner , but the story is made for children only , repeat for children only . But it's cute .",1390262400,,171,3.7777777777777777
2828287,1,B000PUAIE8,"It's cute for little kids maybe , it might hold their attention I think , but it's not my cup of tea , just saying.",1387756800,,115,3.64
2828288,1,B000PUAIE8,don't buy you'll be disappointed. to silly too take serious. I have a worthless product. it put me to sleep in 5 minuts,1382140800,,119,4.217391304347826
2828289,5,B000PUAIE8,"It was a little goofy, but it was meant for kids, my kids loved it. They want to watch it over and over. Good investment.",1377561600,3,121,3.88
2828290,1,B000PUAIE8,"I was expecting the Biblical Story of Daniel and the Lions. What I got was a childlike nonsensical movie. We watched the first 10 mins hoping it would improve, but it was too irritating to watch any further. It seems they mixed up the account of Moses feeling overwhelmed with the task of judging the people with Daniel. The characters were nothing like the Bible characters. I wouldn't recommend this movie for children as it will not help them to gain an accurate understand of this Bible account.",1367884800,,499,4.681818181818182
2828291,2,B000PUAIE8,IT IS A PLAY AND MUSICAL  I WANTED THE MOVIE OF DANIEL NOT THIS PLAY LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING MOVIE,1366675200,,100,4.0
2828292,1,B000PUAIE8,Didn't care for the new day actors and story telling. Was looking for an original film portraying like Joseph and moses. The beginning was terrible so I didn't watch the rest of it. Not at all what I was looking for.,1364947200,2,216,4.2926829268292686
2828293,5,B000PUAIE8,"I was loaned another Liken video and fell in love with the quality, humor, and yet seriousness of each film and got my own complete series little by little but have had to replace my copies little by little because people ""forget to return"" when I've loaned them my copies so I now keep a ""lending list"" of when I loan them and to whom. The song about Meat tonight is the best!",1362960000,2,377,4.178082191780822
2828294,1,B000PUAIE8,"Didn't like at all. But I was expecting Bible times and close to scripture based. Modern day setting, well I didn't even finish it.",1361145600,3,131,4.5
2828295,3,B000PUAIE8,Le encanto esta pelicula a mi hija...aunque carece de seriedad y es para nios...muestra un relato de como vivio en aquellos aos Daniel....,1360368000,,138,5.043478260869565
2828296,1,B000PUAIE8,"Don't buy this movie, it is a really weird and quirky movie. It's like they're trying to make fun of this beautiful biblical story.",1358985600,2,131,4.5
2828297,1,B000PUAIE8,"this was not a movie ! it was a play, not that good for what we wanted it for. not for me",1357689600,,89,3.090909090909091
2828298,5,B000PUAIE8,Another one in a long line of hits by the Liken the Scriptures Team. Your  family will love the great songs - something for the whole family!,1357344000,,141,4.222222222222222
2828299,5,B000PUAIE8,This is our second copy purchased.  The quality of the singers is exceptional and the plot is entertaining.  We especially liked the lions.  We watch the two den songs over and over and start singing along. I'll probably purchase more for the grandkids (but we like as much as the kids).,1349395200,2,287,4.588235294117647
2828300,5,B000PUAIE8,"There are so few versions of this story available that are not animated; this is a musical version. They present the story beautifully. It not only portraits the many emotions; happiness, sadness, jealousy, and love, but you feel them through the actors. I have watched it several times since I purchased it. I would recommend it to my friends.",1348444800,2,344,4.8474576271186445
2828301,5,B000PUAIE8,We have watched this movie about 10 times.  We just love the creative additions to the basically correct bible story.  The songs are just fun and creative.  Such talented singers!  We have shown the video to friends and we run around singing the words to the songs.  Great fun as well as faith-promoting.,1348012800,,304,4.660377358490566
2828302,3,B000PUAIE8,"I would recommend this for a child getting to know about God and the Bible..
not really something for an adult to sit through.",1340841600,3,126,4.291666666666667
2828303,5,B000PUAIE8,"This is a great film. The kids love it. It's a funny, entertaining, uplifting musical that the whole family can enjoy.",1339286400,4,118,4.666666666666667
2828304,1,B000PUAIE8,We could not even watch this for 10 minutes.  We often use Biblical DVDs  for learning purposes.  This was rediculous and stupid,1336089600,3,128,4.7272727272727275
2828305,5,B000PUAIE8,"This DVD proves that you don't need a Hollywood blockbuster to make a lasting impression on the audience.  The music is fun,  and how about that compelling song by Daniel and the King?  The idea for singing lions was great.  I'm a fan of Rockapella, and the 2 songs by the lions are pure delight.  The portrayal of the bad guys trying to frame Daniel has helped me understand this bible story so much better.  In the end, the message that you take away from the show and how it influences your life are what makes me give this one 5 stars.  It is fun and unforgettable.",1193529600,,569,4.261682242990654
8193395,1,B000PUAIE8,Lightstone Studios is mormon.  Be warned.,1523059200,,41,5.833333333333333
8193396,5,B000PUAIE8,"We really like this movie and it has some fun, silly songs as well as sweet, spiritual songs, both of which are sung really beautifully.  I really like the acting by the king and Daniel as well as their duet.",1484697600,,208,4.2
8193397,5,B000PUAIE8,Surprised by negative reviews. This story is told as imagined by a child. Most of the negative reviews were because the reviewers were expecting an adult portayal. I thought it was a creative approach aND fun to watch.,1474243200,,218,4.7631578947368425
8193398,5,B000PUAIE8,"Daniel & The Lions, a biblical story of Daniel's courage and prayer.",1473206400,,68,4.75
