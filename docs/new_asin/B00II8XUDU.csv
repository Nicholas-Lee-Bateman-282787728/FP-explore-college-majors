8642214,1,B00II8XUDU,"what a dangerous idea to suggest that what someone dreams is given or ordained by our creator. People dream all sorts of nonsense inspired by love, greed, longing, hate, jealousy, prejudice, charity, etc. People use your heads.",1471046400,,227,5.162162162162162
8642215,4,B00II8XUDU,"Visions of the Night..How God Speaks was very well done. I was interested in getting the dvd but was really expecting more, maybe because I have scriptually studied on this subject and myself have a very extensive 15 plus years study and wish to publish in the future via amazon as an app if possible. There is a high demand under this subject but not in the secular sense for those who are interested in scriptural based. It arrived on time, graphics, sound quality very nice. I really thought it would be longer however, but I would concluded that it is a basic understanding where many dreams are relevant to one but NOT all under discernment. Very glad with the seller. Thanks!",1405468800,,681,4.590163934426229
8642216,5,B00II8XUDU,"We all wonder ""What"" is meant by the content of our dreams.  God used dreams to speak to Pharaoh while Moses interpreted.  Save goes for the Seven ""Good"" years, followed by Seven ""Famine"" years as shown to another Pharaoh"".  This DVD will help you learn what your own dreams really mean!",1397433600,3,287,4.588235294117647
