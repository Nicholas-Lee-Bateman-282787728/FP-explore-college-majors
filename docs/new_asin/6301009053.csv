7808922,3,6301009053,"I'm pretty much a fan of any old WWF videos and matches.  Allthough the matches are fun to watch because they are from the old age of WWF, I would not dare call them ""The Greatest"" WWF matches.  Even for the very young WWF at the time of this video release, these matches just seem to be picked at random and released so WWF could make a quick buck.  The video is only an hour long.  If you are a serious video tape collector, then pick it up.  If you are just curious like I was, ignore this and check out some of WWF's old ""WrestleFest"" videos.",1261180800,,546,4.065420560747664
