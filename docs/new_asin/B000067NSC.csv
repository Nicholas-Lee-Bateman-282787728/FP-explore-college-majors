1718886,5,B000067NSC,"This is such a great, timeless series, but the DVD's are SOOO expensive in region 1 (U.S.) format. We bought a region free DVD player for < $50 and now we can finally afford all of the great British shows that are so half-heartedly marketed here.",1358208000,16,246,4.369565217391305
1718887,5,B000067NSC,"A different style of British comedy. This is a gentle comedy with the humor coming out of the nature of the characters and their symbiotic relationships. This set contains the first two series (13 episodes) featuring Norman and Compo, but not Foggy Dewhurst.  In the first two series, the third member of the trio was Cyril Blamire, played by Michael Bates, and the overall mood is somewhat different from the later episodes.

This is the longest-running British comedy and one of the most popular, so why aren't more episodes available on DVD?",1158451200,26,544,4.9021739130434785
1718938,5,B000067NSC,"Okay here goes... We LOVE EVERYTHING ""Last of the Summer Wine""!!  We just had to have the first 2 seasons for our collection even though their Region 2... we knew that when I ordered them.  Having said that, we have not watched them yet (they only arrived last week).  They will not run on our PC like I had hoped they would.  I can switch it over but only 4 times then it is locked on the last region forever.  So I'm still looking into how to override that.  I'm also looking to buy an open region DVD player.  We are willing to do that just because we LOVE LOTSW so much.  We can hardly wait to see Compo, Cleggy, and Nora when they were younger and this series began.",1472947200,3,671,4.107692307692307

1718940,5,B000067NSC,"This is a love it or hate it show and I'm one of the diehard fans. Not all the shows are available in region 1 format DVDs, so I also have disks from the UK, Australia and New Zealand but they all play fine on my Windows 7 and 10 machines. The pilot is not on DVD anywhere but it is available to watch free online.",1461888000,,314,3.772727272727273

1718972,5,B000067NSC,"I got a DVD player for all regions just so I could play this dvd.  This has some of the most comical story lines ever.  If you love ""Last of the Summer Wine""  series this is a must.  Quiet drink at an old pub- and the canoe ballad two of the most comical stories ever.  The writer and the actors are a perfect fit.  One of the best ever.",1395532800,6,337,3.8115942028985508
1718973,5,B000067NSC,"Charming classic British TV--nothing hectic or overly dramatic or hysterically funny.  Just a slow-moving, amusing little show.  As a senior myself, I thoroughly understood the men's need to be active and do the things they may not have time to do when working--no matter how strange.  Noi ne does sit-coms better than the Brits",1386633600,2,328,5.037037037037037
1718974,5,B000067NSC,This series is probably the the funniest I have ever seen.  No sex involved.  No bad language.  The best British comedy you can find.  Most are available here in the states and after I bought these in the region 2 format.  Found out they are now being sold in a format that is compatible with the U.S. without using a special player.  It is definitely worth it.,1381968000,3,361,4.313432835820896
1718975,5,B000067NSC,Have not seen all of these episodes on any  USA format DVDs.  What a wonderful series.  It's fascinating to see how the characters develop over the years.,1379894400,,154,4.62962962962963
1718976,5,B000067NSC,"This is a great way to start off your last of the summer wine collection. I own the American version of this, but the UK version has more episodes on if. So this makes the best choice by far.",1376956800,8,191,3.923076923076923
1718977,5,B000067NSC,This is a great series.  A look into another culture and time that is funny without being disrespectful or vulgar.  Truly enjoyable.,1358640000,4,132,4.954545454545454

7963484,4,B000067NSC,"early  summer wine episodes are good.  Compo in these is a little too scruffy, and Clegg is more vulgar than in the later ones when Foggy  comes on the scene to blunder as ""commander"" and Clegg  has all the clever one-liners, but I enjoyed the episodes.  They are so much more clever than modern TV!",1480636800,,299,4.363636363636363
