8325900,5,B000XPZTJO,"Watched adventures in Europe before going to Amsterdam, really enjoyed it and love Big D",1430956800,,88,4.933333333333334
8325901,1,B000XPZTJO,What an awful show.  The narrator was a real bozo.  Cheap thrills with no substance.  Don't waste your time.  Borrring!,1415318400,,119,4.8
8325902,3,B000XPZTJO,It is what you would expect.,1408147200,,28,3.8333333333333335
8325903,2,B000XPZTJO,"This is not very well put together.  It was more of highlights reel of different parts of Europe instead of him acutely digging into a specific area or interviewing anyone.  Not worth your time, almost no nudity and no depth to this movie.",1387929600,2,239,4.534883720930233
8325904,1,B000XPZTJO,If you dig watching some guy meander around Europe in search of prostitutes - then you have struck video gold.,1365033600,,110,4.55
8325905,1,B000XPZTJO,"very amateur documentary. Terrible editing. Repetitive. Irritatingly out of focus. One would not think someone could make this topic boring, but this is achieved the seemingly impossible. It was quite difficult to watch the entire thing.",1354492800,2,237,5.611111111111111
8325906,4,B000XPZTJO,good fun dvd not sure if was worth the price tag but certainly worth a watch,1280448000,2,76,3.8125
8325907,5,B000XPZTJO,"Loved it! Totally unique independent video. The host Big D travels to Amsterdam, Belgium, Germany, and Prague. These Red Light Districts are amazing! It's hard to believe that the working women stand behind storefront windows in Europe. It's basically like a video guide to the Red Light Districts of Europe. I had a lot of fun watching this video. The cathouse in Prague was totally cool, as was the Sauna Club in Germany. I'm already planning my trip! LOL!",1214697600,2,458,4.810126582278481
8325908,2,B000XPZTJO,"The DVD was just a compilation of ""Big D"" haging out in Europe. Little to no concrete information or advice is given. It's also fairly tame concerning nudity or sex. The Prague section is best and the most informative.",1206576000,4,218,4.615384615384615
