8132430,4,B000GI3RZQ,"Okay. What we have here is a concert with 5 original Whispers, Lakeside before Fantastic Voyage, the original Shalamar and I can't for the life of me think of the final group. But one of the 5 Stairsteps is prominent with this group. Great concert. Only snag is during Shalamar's part of the show. There are no closeups. Had there been at least a couple of closeups on Shalamar, this would be a 5 star review.",1184284800,,409,4.394736842105263

SO when I saw that DVD I knew I was going to buy it no matter what. And I am glad I did! 12 great tracks and vintage performances drawn from TV appearances from (probably) all over the world as you can even see during the Joe Bataan performance the RAI (Italian TV) logo at the bottom! All the performances are playback, but the remastered audio tracks are great, although the image color has sometimes faded a little bit. Enjoy Aurra, Instant Funk, Skyy (First Time Around is brilliant), Loleatta Holloway, First Choice, Bunny Sigler or Love Comittee and do the time-warp!!!!",1164499200,6,738,4.4338235294117645
