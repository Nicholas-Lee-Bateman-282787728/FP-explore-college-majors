8154282,2,B000K4X5QW,"Wonderful actors wasted in a bad story.  Carradine, a classic and great actor, had nothing to do, and Matt Schulze, a truly unique and intense performer, one to be reckoned with on the big screen, could not overcome the seemingly endless TV Cable-Movie-cliches of a sanity-challenged psychic cop. Lochlyn Munro deserves mention, also as a talented actor who deserves much better.  Perhaps it looked much better in script form.
