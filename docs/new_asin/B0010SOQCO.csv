3049809,5,B0010SOQCO,"Mastering the Rubber Guard is the definitive resource for the Martial Artist who is willing to think outside the box right away. After 20 years of TaeKwonDo training I decided to begin training Brazillian JiuJitsu. I was determined to not make some mistakes I made in TKD. Specifically, I'm not going to learn anything for the sake of tradition. I want to learn what works.

Since I'm not wearing a Gi out in the world, why would I learn a self defense system based on one? After some research I found Eddie Bravo. I was hesitant at first due to Eddie's very outspoken opinions on Marijuana use. At the end of the day I decided to seperate the message from the messanger. Eddie Bravo is a genius ON THE MAT. Pure Genius.

The system, and it is a system, takes TIME. I bought the book (also Mastering the twister) and later bought the video. GET EM!! It works. No one in the Jiu Jitsu world is thinking the way Eddie is.",1247097600,,919,4.368421052631579

3049811,5,B0010SOQCO,"Eddie Bravo has done an excellent job in this DVD Set. The instructional (most important part of the DVD Set) is excellent and the format is great to use together with his book of the same name. The rest of the content, which has some comedy pieces and Eddie's music is very entertaining and funny. Excellent Eddie Bravo Product. If you are serious about learing Eddie's system, this is a must.",1227398400,,394,4.563380281690141
3049812,5,B0010SOQCO,"I love this system.  I ordered the book and the DVD and I am now tapping people out with the moves.  This is the most offensive guard that I have ever used, and the transitions to other positions are great.

This DVD is not only a instructional but it has lots of entertaining music and other stuff which break up the instructional so it is not so boring.

I have been training BJJ for years and this is a must have for anyone wanting to take their game to the next level.  Great job Eddie, I am looking forward to the Mastering the Twister DVD.",1221177600,,545,4.152380952380953

Detailed how to's and the why behind it.
I have had this product for about a month, and have implemented a few techniques already. The guys I roll with are dumbfounded.

3049816,5,B0010SOQCO,"This can be one of the most important reviews you ever read if you apply the knowledge that this DVD and I am about to share with you into your life.
  To take full advantage of Eddie's Mastering the Rubber Guard you should already know the basics of the guard and mount from a Gracie or equivalent type video.
  Assuming you have the basics under your belt Bravo shows you many ways to apply submission holds starting from the bottom.  Many of the tap out holds he developed have his own quirky names, but that is OK.  The main thing is they are unknown to many jiu-jitsu practitioners so they should work for you if you practice them.
  But what makes this DVD great is not that it has a lot of neat escapes and counters and so on, it's that it showcases a man that is doing what he loves in various pursuits of his life.  He is not worried what society thinks, he is into enjoying life and mastering many different areas.
  If you take that attitude and live your life that way you are on your way to becoming much more happy and successful than most of those around you.
  Besides practicing the ground game on this video you also need to make sure your kicking and punching game is up to par.  Is it?  If not get a DVD on low kicks and also study some Wing Chun or Kali/escrima to get your hand speed up.
  There are many fine instructional videos out there.  I highly recommend Marco Lala, Mark Hatmaker, Matt Furey, and the guy that used to be Lt. X but has recently changed to Capt. Chris in the close combat series.
  If you want to take advantage of this review on Eddie's dvd then you also need to study some of the material by the other guys that I mentioned.  Decide that you are going to have a complete fight game.  Being able to roll on the mat is great, but there are times you absolutely don't want to be on the ground such as in a bar fight with your attacker's buddies coming at you with a beer bottle or pool stick in their hand.  You must learn to be able to get up quickly.  Practice these type of escapes.
  Become like a Special Forces guy that must get up and take cover before a sentry comes and spots and shoots him.. That is how good you want to get at getting up and getting gone.
  But also I want you to take this DVD and incorporate it into being the total person you dream of being.  You can accomplish great things in only 20 minutes a day.  Practice the moves 2 or 3 times a week and then pursue some other goal on other days of the week.  Need to build up your endurance?  Then go to a track twice a week.  If it is a 440 yard track and you can only jog half way around that is a start.  Walk three laps and jog a half lap.  Do that 3 times twice a week.  Then once every two weeks figure out how far you can cover in a minute and a half or two minutes and do a normal lap but the last 1/4th speed up a little bit and then the last 10th of a lap finish with a kick.  This is your speed day.  One week two normal jogging days, then the next week one normal and one speed  jogging day.  Your endurance will grow faster than you thought possible.
  Maybe you want to increase your strength.  Then lift weights every 3 or 4 days.  Don't worry about that every other day, 3 times a week stuff.  Every 3 or four days is plenty often enough to get strong.
  Want to become flexible to be able to do some of the moves Eddie shows?  Then study Yoga two or three times a week.  Studying Mastering the Rubber Guard can be part of your overall game plan.  You are using it to become the total package you want to be.
  You should know that there are some nasty, even lethal counters to the positions that Bravo demonstrates.  While I really like this instructional disc I worry that people don't realize how deadly an encounter with a trained fighter or soldier can become.  They aren't used in competition because most people don't want to cause permanent harm to someone in a sporting event.  Just know they are people floating around out there that can deliver such moves.  They don't show them to the public or teach them to the public as a general rule, but I figure they will start to leak out in the future.
  Well, Use your time wisely and pursue your dreams.  If you want to learn to play guitar like Eddie Bravo then do that on the days you aren't studying this DVD.

Time Management for Entrepreneurs (No B.S. Series)</a>&nbsp;and make sure you are doing the most important thing to you in your life.

3049817,5,B0010SOQCO,"I have been training in BJJ for only 5 months and obviously still a white belt. One thing I noticed is how I always found myself in the half guard (about 70% of the time), constantly trying to keep my opponents leg from passing into side control. At the same time I was taught to stick in the butterfly hook in and sweep him before he is able to finagle his leg out and control me from the side. Needless to say my percentage was very low in sweeping anyone, unless they were a newbie white belt. I was extremely frustrated and never wanted to be on my back, but all of the bigger and stronger guys were able to muscle me to the floor at the beginning of rolling.

Then I came across the half guard game that Eddie teaches with the lock down. What a difference! With the Rubber Guard DVD I started practicing mechanics of Old School, Electric Chair, and Returning to Full Guard. It has been about two months since my start, and I have become proficient, but not perfect; But no one in my gym seems to know about this system, or want to learn it so I got away with moves even if they are semi sloppy. This gave me the comfort and confidence on being on my back! I think a couple guys have the Rubber Guard book, but no one has shown me or attacked with a lock down/grape vine, or any rubber guard for that fact. Maybe they are not flexible or are embarrassed to use it because it is not taught in my school.

WHAT THIS REVIEW IS ULTIMATELY ABOUT:

The other day I had to roll with the second head instructor of my school. No doubt, a black belt, given by Carlos Gracie Jr. I had never rolled with him before, but everyone told me how strong, efficient, and great he is. He let me fall into his guard and the first three minutes and as we were moving and rolling, he caught me in a arm triangle choke. I was kind of embarrassed because I saw it coming and was almost able to defend it, but it was to late. Then, I decided to let him come to me, and I pulled him into my half guard. Quickly I pulled the lock down, softly, not to alert him to what I was trying to do. Then as I went for the Old school Sweep, I noticed there was also an opportunity to go for the electric chair. I figured if there was ever a chance to submit my instructor, this would be it! I under hooked his leg and I tried to whip my leg up and across, but all of his weight was on the back leg. For a split second I thought to myself, ""Damn, this guy also studied Eddie Bravo's Guard!""  But no more then 3 seconds later, I felt his weight shift off the back leg, and I quickly whipped my lock down to the left and he fell right into the Electric Chair. In hopes that he would realized he was done, I didn't want to go to hard because I was afraid of hurting his hamstrings. But, I could tell on his face that the discomfort was not enough for him to tap. He tried to defend by grabbing my head, but I jolted it back and cranked it up. All I could hear was my other instructor/friend in my head say, ""Never Let go!"" Needless to say he tapped a couple seconds later. It was almost surreal to see a black belt on the floor ashamed that a white belt just tapped him out.

I can't wait to utilized the other 90% of the DVD's instructions. If this is what the 10 percent can do for me, then I can't wait to use the rest. Just always remember to work on flexibility, and repeat the drills over and over, until you get the mechanics engraved into your brain. If it worked for me, it can work for anyone!",1205452800,17,3464,4.036390101892286

Being able to see the techniques in action you will notice many little things you probably aren't doing when playing rubber guard.,1203033600,6,354,4.634920634920635
8238400,3,B0010SOQCO,"In this series Eddie explains the following:

1) The half guard- excellent techniques.  I am relatively weak and non-athletic (not all of us are gifted with a fighters physique).  I try these techniques in class against the bigger and stronger opponents. The bigger and stronger get on top and crush you into a submission.  Now I can defend myself, I pull Eddie's half guard from the bottom and I love the annoyed and shocked look when the ""lock down"" is applied and their plans to mount and crush are destroyed.  Love it even better when the bigger and stronger higher belt gets swept by ""old school"". These techniques are very high percentage and I'd say the best part of the dvd, and its no wonder its the best part because I'm finding out that this is what Eddie Bravo is really famous and feared for! He is not really feared for his rubber guard, it is actually his bottom half guard skills that people fear!!! Evidence . . . watch his latest fight with a Gracie, he half-guard kills the guy the whole fight.

2) The dog fight- Eddie's name for when you end up side by side with your opponent on your hands and knees with the whizzer thrown in (you get to it from going to hands and knees from half guard), as wrestlers often do.  Very good lessons from Eddie who used to be a wrestler. I have not seen these lessons in any other dvd series (and I own a lot of DVDs, about 12 different sets of all the most famous ones).  I can't speak to applicability here since I am not a wrestler and I don't try these move, and I don't see anyone else in my school practicing it. If you have a lot of wrestlers in your school then this is probably a must learn section for you since Eddie gives the jiu jitsu perspective to the dog fight.

3)  Butterfly Guard- it's Ok, nothing magical here and not a huge section on the dvds. Honestly, I've seen better butterfly videos but Eddie does add a different flavor to it and in his defense it wasn't meant as an extensive butterfly guard segment.

4) Spiders Web- This position is when you are about to apply an arm bar and the opponent defends it, so Eddie teaches not trying to rip is arms off each other to get the final arm bar submission, but instead he teaches the tricks to make him suffer for his defense by applying other submissions from that position.  He has good transitions and submissions here.  Apparently the highlight is suppose to be the ""arm crush"" technique, but honestly the arm crush technique could have been taught better.  I've tried it in practice and must be doing something wrong cause no submission occurs, the dvd lacks the details to correct my error, he concentrates more on explaining the transitions in this section rather than the details to make the technique successful.

5) The Rubber Guard- an amazing section if you are flexible enough to pull these moves off. I am completely inflexible so this section was pretty useless for me. But if you watch it you will be in awe of what can be pulled off and the deep trouble you can get people into if you are flexible enough. I am not flexible, however, my children (as most children are) are very flexible and it has made me determined to maintain their flexibility and I've taught them some of these moves and it is awesome to see them apply it in class successfully.

To me, this dvd is worth the entire price just based on his half guard lessons by themselves!!! As for a previous reviewer who said the production quality sucks, I disagree. Sure I can tell he recorded it in his studio (you can hear the chime when someone enters) but I like the different camera angles he switches to, the close ups, the change in filters from camera to camera, the interludes with live action and funny stuff, etc. that make it a pleasure to watch.

The one VERY ANNOYING THING is that the entire dvd series has a large web address across the top of the screen for the entire dvd series, so every second you watch you are looking at the stupid web address, sometimes across Eddie's forehead and face.  What was he thinking promoting that damn website through entire dvd series that I paid for? Very dumb thing to do!!!

I knock off 2 stars for the immoral. Sure he has the explicit content warning on the dvd, so you should know not to watch it with your children. But the profanity, the vulgar, and pro-drugs agenda is a bit too much for a jiu jitsu series. I'm sure it won't bother some and some will even agree with his agenda and style, but I am not one of those.",1411862400,2,4477,4.3852657004830915
8238401,3,B0010SOQCO,good info - but comes off as a bit of a home project.  production quality is not great but certainly watchable.  I liked it - I just don't think it was worth the $$.,1396396800,,165,3.823529411764706
8238402,4,B0010SOQCO,"Mastering the Twister was released finally in 2012 and includes Eddie Bravo's top game on DVD.  The video is 1 hour and 55 minutes long and doesn't contain music videos and pranks like in the Rubber Guard DVDs.  I actually really like that this video is straight techniques, and Eddie delivers.  I've used these moves to tap out a lot of folks in class.

I'm giving it only 4 stars because there was some kind of issue with the manufacturing.  The DVD works in my laptop, but for some reason the last part of the DVD doesn't play on my video player.  Maybe it's because there is 2 hours on one disk and then will offer it in blue ray.  Well, my training partner and I use the laptop mostly anyway, so it isn't a problem, but buy knowing that is an issue.  The content is 5 stars.",1391990400,,779,4.216216216216216
8238403,5,B0010SOQCO,Got this for my cousin. Says it's a great dvd for people starting out in MMA. Four more words then.,1366502400,,99,4.0
8238404,5,B0010SOQCO,This DVD set has a lot of techniques that I have never seen before...There are 3 DVDs ...personally I like the half guard DVD...and of course the rubber guard dvd ...you don't have to change your game to rubber guard ...but is good to have this techniques by your side...!!!!,1364860800,,275,4.52

8238406,5,B0010SOQCO,"The mastering the rubber guard Eddie bravo DVD came very fast and came in perfect condition. I bought it for his Christmas gift and was nervous that he wouldn't get it on time, but it did and he was so happy when he opened his present.",1358726400,,235,4.130434782608695
8238407,3,B0010SOQCO,"These DVD's are really well laid out. They start with the half guard and proceed to the pyramid position and then full rubber guard. Eddie spends just as much time detailing HOW to get to his positions as what to do when you get there, which is definitely appreciated. As far as BJJ/MMA strategy goes, I'd say most people can glean a few tricks from this stuff, but not everything is super high percentage.

(I'll leave Eddie's stoner philosophy stuff out of this review except for saying that if you actually find the ""comedy"" interludes on these DVD's funny, you MUST be high.)",1350950400,,579,4.621359223300971
8238408,2,B0010SOQCO,"The instruction, in a vacuum, is an A+.  But there is profanity/drug use/offensive position names (i.e. Retard Control)/etc.

If you think that sort of thing is cool, then this video warrants 5 stars.  If you don't then it's a mixed bag.  I'd like to use it to work out with my son, but the negatives (morally dubious role model) grossly outweigh the positives (better jiu jitsu).  It's a shame, the instruction is top notch.",1341100800,,425,4.6891891891891895
8238409,5,B0010SOQCO,I've been training BJJ for 9 months and this dvd has improved my game alot. I have just been focusing on the rubber guard(dvd 2) and that's awesome. However ther is also the lockdown-half guard(dvd 1) and the spider web(dvd 3). Aswell as this there are many good extras.,1302566400,,270,4.530612244897959
