5186332,4,B008VR7U8O,"I happened to catch this movie in a theatre in Washington, DC some 4-5 months ago. I had heard about the amazing circumstances surrounding this documentary (more on that later), and couldn't wait to see this for myself.

""This Is Not a Film"" (2011 release from Iran; 75 min.) is nothing more, nothing less than Iranian dirctor Jafar Panahi filming life in his apartment on a digital camcorder. Indeed, as Panahi explains to us, he is under house arrest (for reasons not fully explained) and barred from film-making by the Iranian authorities. Panahi has a script written for a new film and with the help of a friend, he decides to read the script to us and live out the script as best as possible in his apartment. Alas, that is not practical (a frustrated Panahi exclaims at one point ""If we could tell the film, why make the film?""). In the last part of the film another of Panahi's friends comes to the apartment and the two men simply discuss their daily struggles, and then take out the garbage as we see Teheran and hear explosions in the background.

As mentioned, the movie itself is rather ordinary (although you can feel the tension throughout the movie), but the circumstances surrounding this movie are nothing short of jaw-dropping. Defying a total ban on film-making by the Iranian authorities, Panahi was upon its completion able to smuggle this out of Iran on a flash-drive with the help of friends, and this documentary made its dramatic debut at the 2011 Cannes film festival. I feel like every time someone is watching this movie, it is providing a stance of support to Panahi and a raised middle finger to the Iranian government. For historical purposes, this movie is a must-see, period, and hence HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1351209600,5,1738,4.751655629139073
8531188,3,B008VR7U8O,"I can't say this film was my cup of tea, however my son enjoyed it thoroughly. At first the documentary seems almost pointless--a censored film maker trapped in his house, desperate to make a film of just about anything--but at the end, the purpose becomes somewhat clearer. I think this one is better suited to people who are more sophisticated about film making than I am.",1487980800,,374,4.681818181818182
8531189,5,B008VR7U8O,Really not a film but an interesting documentation of a day of his life in 4-shanbe soori night. Nicely portrays his feelings and conditions in that period of time.,1475625600,,164,4.689655172413793
8531190,5,B008VR7U8O,"If this is not a film, I'm not really giving away any spoilers, but if you haven't seen this and would prefer to watch it without knowing what to expect, please stop reading.

After the Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi was convicted of subversion, part of his sentence included a 20-year prohibition on writing or directing movies.  In response, he has another filmmaker record him through the course of a day, as he sits in his apartment, calls his attorney, and checks up on family members who are out buying a gift for his mother.  In one sequence, Panahi describes scenes from a script he is working on, about a girl whose family leaves her locked inside their house to prevent her from registering for college.  The girl's plight in the script mirror's Panahi's own as he is also trapped by factors outside his control.  At several points, the sound of what appears to be gunfire is audible from outside; Panahi is strangely calm until we realize that this is part of a fireworks celebration.

After the other filmmaker leaves, Panahi follows a substitute garbageman on his rounds, filming him with his cell phone as he collects trash from other residents in the building, and finally following him outside where they are confronted with people lighting a fire.  The garbageman asks, ""should you be filming this?"" Panahi responds that he's not.

Filmed in secret and smuggled out of Iran, ""This Is Not a Film"" is a testament to the endless struggle of the artist against a system devoted to suppressing him.  By turns fascinating, frustrating, and courageous, this film, which is, regardless of its title, very much a film, should not be missed.",1466812800,,1648,4.815602836879433
8531191,1,B008VR7U8O,"I don't understand the over-the-top reviews of this (not a) film? I understand the political-social statement being made. But as a documentary it is not engaging. This was just dull. the backstory is interesting, but that's where interesing stops for me. I don't mean to be disrepectful, but I just don't get it.",1463356800,,312,4.90566037735849
8531192,3,B008VR7U8O,"Features a filmmaker in Iran who has been charged with making inappropriate movies so he has been put on trial and is on house arrest. With nothing but time on his hands it becomes a version of 'Rear Window' as he talks on the phone, watches television, and then does a live action story board of his next film idea where he is going to have a gal shave her head.

He has a lizard the size of a cat and then a dog shows up. Eventually some guys show up to chat, he takes an elevator ride.

8531193,4,B008VR7U8O,"So your last movie went way over budget, then tanked at the box office? Think youve got it bad? Jafar Panahi is an Iranian director (of the wonderful The White Balloon and Offside) whos currently serving six years in prison and a 20-year ban on filmmaking for making a movie the nations ministry of film didn't approve of. No joking. But the law doesnt say he cant READ a screenplay on film. So before his imprisonment, Panahi invited his documentary filmmaker pal Mojtaba Mirtahmasb to his apartment in Tehran to film him reciting and acting out his latest creation. This is not a Film is a record of that event.

Its a noble venture, but as a filmmaker himself, Panahi quickly realizes the futility of his stunt, as he concludes, If we can tell a film, why make a film? then dissolves into tears. The rest of the movie, therefore, is taken up with Panahi screening parts of his older films while providing running commentary on his artistic choices, discussing everyday concerns with Mirtahmasb, and awaiting word of his fate.

The movie is certainly an indictment of the repressive society in which he lives, yet it also demonstrates that film comes in many forms, and while Panahi may be unable to make the dramatic feature he would like to, it is an equally valid and valuable form of artistic expression to simply document his own real life experience for others to observe - and just as powerful in its effect.

And, indeed, the most compelling scene in the movie is a completely extemporaneous one, as Panahi interviews a substitute custodian who stops by to pick up Panahis trash when the camera just happens to be running and we get to know a little something about this utterly charming mans life in the few unguarded moments we get to spend with him. Its a subtle yet potent reminder that no regime, however cowardly and repressive, can completely dim the human spirit and our basic human need to connect with one another on a personal level.

The movie, which was spirited out of the country on a flash drive hidden inside a cake, functions as a frank political statement for what life is like for film artists living in Iran, but, equally important, it makes the rest of us appreciate the freedoms of expression we all too often take for granted in our own parts of the world - and the need to be ever vigilant in preserving them.",1396569600,3,2344,4.613908872901678
8531194,3,B008VR7U8O,"I applaud the film maker for this.  It's darn good for what it is, but I did find trouble keeping interested all the way through.  It is worth looking at, though.",1384387200,,162,4.193548387096774
8531195,5,B008VR7U8O,"A rare work that can be dated exactly to the day it was filmed - March 16, 2011, five days after the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the coverage of which Panahi watches at one point, and also the date of the Iranian holiday ""Chaharshanbe Suri"" or ""Fireworks Wednesday"", the beginning of the celebration of the Iranian New Year which coincides with the start of Spring. So this is a home movie of a day in the life of it's (co)director, right? Not quite. Panahi was under house arrest, essentially for ""subversion"", and awaiting appeal of his sentence to 6 years in prison and 20 years of no filmmaking or writing or leaving the country - essentially the end of his career (the appeal was not granted). He spends the day on the phone with various people, surfing the Internet (and complaining about how nearly everything is blocked), and trying to stay hopeful about his furture. At a couple of points he acts out and discusses parts of what would have been his next film, and it turns out that the themes of freedom and house arrest were prominent in this unmade film, the irony of which is not lost on anyone. There are also interludes with a large pet lizard which seems to love the filmmaker more than he loves it (it's his daughter's) and a dog that won't stop barking.

As I write this, Panahi is still in jail, less than halfway through the expiration of his sentence, and the situation in Iran is just as bleak, or only marginally less so.  In addition to Panahi, the country's great cinema has lost Kiarostami, the Makhmalbaf family, and perhaps now Asghar Farhadi to voluntary exile; at the very least, these and other filmmakers are ever more wary about staying in a country where their freedom to work is so severely curtailed and - perhaps most importantly - subject to the ever-changing whims of the censors and the leadership of the country.  As Panahi not-so-subtly reminds us throughout his film, one can submit an idea - have it approved - begin filming - and then be arrested after the script is re-evaluated by a harder-line functionary further up the chain.  It is truly a miracle that the country's film scene still exists - let alone produces masterpieces like this one and the dozens of other great works that have appeared over the last few decades.  Perhaps in this case the complexities of existence in such a state have helped to provoke a meditative attitude towards the natures of fact and fiction, which Panahi with his mentor Kiarostami has practiced as well as anyone in world cinema today.  For those who love to ""feel"" the wheels of the narrative, I can wholeheartedly recommend most of the fictions, semi-fictions, and essayistic films from these masters, and ""This is Not a Film"" is a fine place to start.

Ultimately this works as a privileged, secretive view into the mundane daily life of a man who the government believes is so dangerous that it has to keep him locked up for years, and then unable to do his work. If you know his story - and the story of Iranian cinema - it's both fascinating and very sad, and it certainly speaks to the power that art has.  And despite the home-movie, improvised feel of it, it also winds up being a great piece of documentary/essay, despite Panahi's pains to deny that it is, in fact, a ""film"".",1379462400,4,3281,4.596581196581196
8531196,1,B008VR7U8O,"What in the world did I just get myself into?  This film was like a very long submission to America's Funniest Home Videos... but without the funny.

The filmmakers pulled a fast one and really got paid off this films gimmick of having no gimmick. Documentarian meets Bruce Lee's 'jeet kune do' I guess... the style of no style.  So all I gotta do is turn on my camera, burn some tape, and give it to Sundance with a little teaser story with it like ""film was smuggled out of the city on a solid-state drive in a modified bean pie.""  Give me a break.

I bet some pretentious artists types will have no problem seeing the ""art"" in this film... post-weed smoke.

If you want to see a good recent main stream documentary, pick up 5 Broken Cameras or The Invisible War.

It should eally be called, ""This Is Not Even A Good Film"".",1365724800,6,825,4.283870967741936
8531197,5,B008VR7U8O,"This extraordinary film has a backstory that's almost as interesting as the film (excuse me, this is NOT a film, really it isn't - because it was short using a digital camera and an iPhone - but there are other reasons). As pointed out in my fellow Amazon reviewer, Paul Allaer, the Iranian filmmaker - Jafar Panahi - was banned from making any films and this documentary was smuggled out of Iran to premiere at the Cannes Film Festival. (What Allaer failed to mention is that the flash drive containing the documentary was hidden in a BIRTHDAY CAKE!).
I'll leave you to read Allaer's review but clarify a few points. 1) there are two other people who appear in the ""not a film"" besides Panahi: his fellow documentarian Mojtapa Miratahmasb who mans the digital camera at one point  and the custodian (who Allaer refers to, incorrectly, as a Jafar's friend - he is actually the brother of the normal custodian who is filling in, and apparently Panahi has never met.) and 2) though we hear explosions early in the ""not a film"", which could be gunfire, the explosions in the last section with the custodian are, in fact, fireworks (which, by the way, the Iranian government banned).  These are not major points but I wanted to clarify.

The 75-minute ""not a film"" will draw you in in its simplicity. Panahi is a well-known Iranian filmmaker who the government has put on trial. Throughout the ""not a film"" he is awaiting his sentence which carried a minimum of 6 years in prison.  But he wants to tell his story. About an hour into the film Mirtahmasb says ""It's important that the camera stays on"", and this - for me was the key to why the ""not A film"" is important. We cannot let a government determine what a filmmaker can say about politics.

The DVD will be released on March 12th and comes with a few bonus features.  (more in a minute). It is in Iranian with English subtitles. If there is one caveat I will make for those watching the film on a standard definition TV, it is that this is another recent case where the English subtitles are in white print directly on the screen image and not very large. The size is not the issue but there are quite a few scenes where  background  is white (Panahi is wearing a WHITE shirt)  and the subtitles are quite hard to read. I have to say that even on my 27in standard format TV, I missed about 5% of the dialogue (but I could still follow the story). Other recent foreign films I've reviewed recently have subtitles in green or the words are placed below the image, making it easy to read.
The bonus features include a commentary track - which I did not listen to) and a 10 minute except from a 2008 interview with Panahi - which I found interesting. Ironically, the subtitles for the interview are in a larger font and in bright YELLOW!

I also forgot to mention another unique aspect of this ""not a fil"". It has the shortest ""credits"" of any release I can remember. That's because Panahi - self-censored the ""credits"" so alll that is there is ""*******"", ""******"" and ""*****""

I highly recommend this ""not a film"" to anyone interested in world politics or how to make a documentary film when making ANY kind of film is illegal.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
