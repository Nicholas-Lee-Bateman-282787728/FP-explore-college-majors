8441443,5,B004UE06WE,"FANTASTIC!!!!!.  This DVD contained episodes I had never seen before.  And believe, me, I thought I had seen them all!!!!!!!!!
I'm really pleased, and will buy more.  Still looking for the DVDs that contain the episodes of ""The International Silver String Submarine Band"", and ""Yum Yum Eatum Up"".  (Uncle George from Borneo).",1448064000,,325,5.1923076923076925
8441444,5,B004UE06WE,"Nice little collection of old rascals vids but final video is very old and silent and is a story involving a chimpanzee, and there are a few scenes of what these day's we'd consider to be abusive including two chimps fighting. Today this would not be tolerated in a film for entertainment and may disturb young kids and sensitive souls. Most of this vide is typical rascals silliness and can be enjoyed by all but concerned parents may want to stop before that final video comes on.",1440892800,,482,4.551724137931035

8441446,5,B004UE06WE,"Here is a wonderful DVD to share with your children. The film quality was excellent, and my two nieces enjoyed this as much as I did. It is so great the Legend Films keeps bringing back the classics of yesteryear restored and ready to watch and be entertained!!",1395792000,,261,4.458333333333333
8441447,5,B004UE06WE,"Pretty good selection of [probably] public-domain short-subjects.
For the price, you cannot go wrong.
There ARE better collections for double the price.",1387324800,,152,5.954545454545454
8441448,5,B004UE06WE,"Mostly some classic Our Gang/Little Rascals shorts. Some of the cream of the crop.

""Little Daddy"" (1931) is a rarely seen tale of Farina taking care of his brother Stymie while their father is imprisoned. A good mixture of comedy and pathos, as the gang (and Miss Crabtree) band together to keep Stymie from going to the orphanage. A bit ahead of its time in that the Black church sequence is played straight and not for laughs. This was sort of a changing of the guard of the show's black headliners from Farina to Stymie.

""Birthday Blues"" (1932) is another depression-era dramedy. Spanky and Dickie defy their mean daddy to raise funds to get their mama a birthday present. The burping cake is a howl.

""Pay as You Exit"" (1936) is one of the better later eps with Spanky and Alfalfa. The gang puts on their howl-arious version of ""Romyo and Juilet"" (sic). Buckwheat really shines in this one (""My homeo""). A real laugh riot.

""Fishy Tales"" (1937). An amusing tale of Alfalfa trying to get out of a fight with Butch. The bit with the cats is hilarious.

""Honkey Donkey"" (1934). ""Oh you nasty man."" Need I say more?

 ""Monkey Business"" (1925). A silent epsiode about Farina and his hyper-Chimp pal. A few uncomfortable racial implications here, but the Chimp is quite funny. Some of the gags here were repeated almost identically 7 years later in ""A Lad and a Lap"" (where the cops chase the chimp).

Overall, a good set of Rascalism. Enjoy.",1315267200,3,1442,4.627450980392157
