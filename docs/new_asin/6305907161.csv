I have to congratulate though, the marketing agent or whoever was behind the making of the cover, because it leads you to believe that this could be a somewhat sexy movie, with some ""sexy"" scene with Christina Applegate, well nothing like that....
If you want to see a fun movie with ther, rent or buy, the sweetest thing, possibly the unrated version.",1057795200,12,446,4.321428571428571

1089939,5,6305907161,This movie ranks very high on the list of an ability to cut through the hollywood candy coated lives we see in most movies. The writer and director had an understanding of human life and the need to be loved. In this film Christina Applegates character has fallen into the underworld trying to cope with her failed search for real love. When she meets a young man who truly loves her she is unbelieving and rejects his love over and over. When he is relentless in his understanding for her she finally gives in to him and all seems good. But like so often in life just when things seem to be getting better it ends. The film makes a great point about life at the end and leaves you sad but comforted and wiser. This is one of the better films I have seen in a long time. The actual filming is suberb in creating intimacy without a coating of explicit sex so as to not distract from the real story. The film draws you in close in a very artistic way. ...,987292800,4,953,4.184782608695652
1089940,3,6305907161,"Christina Applegate did a great job with a very bad script. It's obvious that she is a great actress. However, it doesn't make up for the movie all together. If it wasn't for her performance, I would rate this one a zero. The other actors missed there marks all through the film. A film school student could have done a better job directing this film. It would be nice to see Christina in a real movie.",986428800,4,402,4.302631578947368
1089941,2,6305907161,"Applegate's stripper-by-night/motel-laundress-by-day life spiral is apparently motivated by her troubled past.  A past that includes a stern military father, a brother who killed himself on his 16th birthday, and a step-mother still living in the family's Southern mansion.  Unfortunately these elements are only hinted at in Applegate's exposition, and the viewer is left to wonder what sort of childhood they add up to.

The arc-free plot involves an Italian drifter, hired as the motel's handyman, who becomes smitten with the laundress.  Unfortunately, Applegate's character has intimacy issues (or perhaps bi-polar disorder), and the couple embark on a series of push-me-pull-you encounters.  There are plenty of content-free subplots - including porn films being shot at the motel, and a lesbian affair - none of which pay off.  There's also a big helping of artistic lighting, framing and freewheeling camera work, none of which further the film.

Applegate's short erotic dancing sequences are the sort that provide good copy (and a still) for the tape's packaging, but are not the sort of blockbuster performance one might expect in light of the turns made by Demi Moore and Elizabeth Berkeley.  In fact, it's Applegate's dramatic scenes that show off her actual talent - acting.  Too bad there's so little content for her to work with.",979516800,15,1345,5.306603773584905
1089942,1,6305907161,"The biggest gyp I've ever seen. The costume she wears is out of Annette Funicello and the 1950's. She has no heat - whatsoever, no dance moves  either. This is strictly a marketting movie all about selling the cover.",969408000,,216,4.538461538461538
1089943,2,6305907161,"Those who seek this video for hot action of Christina Applegate as a stripper will be disappointed with all but about two minutes of this film.  It's a rather dour tale of a Southern girl from a rich home (Applegate) who  runs away from her ""evil stepmother"" (what the exact problem is  with the stepmom is never adequately explained).  An Italian drifter  happens along and they strike up a romance, although she is rather  abivalent.  The film is basically about the ins and outs of their  relationship.  There's very little humor and not a lot of sexual heat--the  main message seems to be ""life sucks, but it's all we have"".  Based on a short story by Heidi Hall (""The Magnifcent Rescue""),  who also scripted the film.  Perhaps the s story had more of a point.",966816000,10,764,4.57037037037037

7897853,2,6305907161,I had never heard of this movie.  The cover shows Christina Applegate in pink lace pole dancing.  Which happens in about the first 30 seconds of the movie. The rest of the movie long slow drawn out and boring.  Wichita Falls Texas is mentioned in the move.  And that's about it.,1499990400,,278,4.392156862745098

7897857,3,6305907161,"hola.
and i cannot believe i have never heard of this movie being a movie and soap tv buff since 12 and then recording artist too for decades! i love her films and television...and this movie ok well 1st,kinda cheesy lol boring etc.but

i say how flagrant because it is so typical for movies imo anyhow. i mean
come on get more original plz.gracias.lol but i did like it alot for the
1st time watching on the S AND M lol channel and no guys i do not mean
submission and dominatrix lol but S AND M is a new time slot after 10 p.m.
on mi fave,one of mi fave channels on soapnet channel who show ALL classic
80's and new 90's type movies too! i just finish seeing my girls christine
and applegate is awesome. i just adore her and love her,she is my age now
in her mid 30's or so and i just adore christina so for this reason PLUS
i love the sexy tall dark guy italiano name of Stefano i just love how he truly adored mixed up but lovely and loveable claudine,

i think the ending
suck how he put on a bra to make her think or love him more that was kinda
weird,but i do get why he wanted her to love him at practically ANY COST
to put on make up and a bra lol just to seem as if he was one of her old
stripper girls etc lol i was laughing at this part with mi papi here when
we were watching this but over all i do believe he TRULY LOVED HER but she
was just too mixed up in my opinion and at the end it was really too late
when he tried to see her getting off the bus to go back to where she was
at visiting the OLD house then she was already dead sad and tragic love story, a strange love story but DEFINITELY a TRUE LOVES STORY with tragic
of course in the end.i will watch it again only because i LOVE C.A. and
stefano is such delicious eye candy to look at yum yum! lol but that is the only reason,they got good/great chem on screen together! sizzling hot!
and the fact i will watch it again if it is on or buy it cause i love her
movie and tv shows,she is a natural for years in front of the camer so cute and great actress in my opinion.but could have been MUCH BETTER over all.but no complaints much i love her anyway.good movie alot boring but overall again i give it at least a tres...three for ALL reasoning listed

7897858,4,6305907161,"Now this is an outstanding  example of independent style film-making.  While the subject matter and characters wildly swing from eccentric, impish, passionate to spiritual, the easiest conflict to recognize is the tormented love-affair of Claudine Van Doozen (played by Christina Applegate of Married with Children fame) and Stefano Marui (Stefano Dionisi).  To add to this complex mix of emotions, Claudine has tendencies to be openly self-envolved, including AC-DC tendencies. This then relegates Stefano as simply an escort, as Claudine routinely shares herself with her other female acquaintances.  Nevertheless, Stefano is like a moth-to-the flame, spell-bound by Claudine's physical beauty, moodiness, spiritual insights, inner-conflicts, plus deep personal scars.  By conjecture, this film supposedly depicts a fringe element of southern society that may shock you.  But like Stefano, you become ever-intrigued to see how it all plays out, and who will ultimately win Claudine---if at all possible.  Truly, this film is a sleeper-classic that will likely never be aired on network TV...at least not during the kiddy-hour!",1189555200,,1128,5.8
7897859,1,6305907161,and I have to say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I watched alot of the scenes being filmed and I can tell you that in her cocaine induced state she still can't act. I own it only because it reminds me of the days that I had long red hair... yeah that is me the amateur porn girl heheheh,1117584000,,302,3.734375
7897860,2,6305907161,"I can honestly say that this movie wasn't interesting in the slightest.  The only reason that I even watched it is that my best friend and I were extras in this movie.  We were in the strip club scenes.  It was great. I almost hit Christina in the face with a pool stick once.  It was first going to be called ""Claudine's Return"" but they changed it.  I wish someone had told me.  I had to find out several years later from a friend of mine who found it on the internet.  I thought that the movie had been scrapped or something.  When I finally watched it, it bored me so much I had to fast-foward it to the scene that we were in.  My friend did the same thing.  Christina did a great job acting though.  She has great talent but made a bad choice in making this movie.  If they had chosen a different actress to play Claudine, it wouldn't even be worth renting.",1110240000,3,862,4.126506024096385
7897861,4,6305907161,"I bought this DVD because I am a HUGE fan of Christina Applegate, and it was well worth the price. The film is really beautiful, but the standout thing here is Christina's performance. She does an amazing job as Claudine, a woman trying to escape her past. Now, we come to one of the reasons I gave the film four stars: What past was Claudine trying to escape? That was never really said in the movie, and it would have been better if it was. Claudine is a laundry-girl by day and exotic dancer by night. Christina has a really good dance sequence early in the film. A young Italian man, Stefano, begins to work at the inn that Claudine works at during the day, and he goes to the club where she dances one night. Claudine and Stefano form a relationship, but problems come along, and their relationship is tested. This is a very dramatic, dark movie, and it makes me sad every time I Watch it, but sad in a good way. Christina proves here that she really is one of the best actresses of this generation (one of the best ever, in my opinion). I would reccomend this film to anyone who wants to see a beautiful drama, or anyone who likes Christina. In the end, there are a few questions that the viewer will have, though. I found that watching it a second time helped me understand, and I noticed a lot of things that I missed the first time, but that is another reason I gave it four stars, because there are still a few unanswered questions in the end.",1085443200,3,1453,4.287272727272727
7897862,5,6305907161,"The first thing that shocked me about ""Kiss of Fire"" was Christina Applegate's performance. I mean, WOW. She just MADE this movie.
The storyline was actually very strong. The director handled it well. Claudine (Applegate), a beautiful free-spirited young woman, is desperately trying to escape her awful past. She is a laundry girl by day and an exotic dancer by night. When claudine meets Stephano (Dionisi), a man who changes her life, she learns about real love and decides to confront the secrets that haunt her. Everything seems wonderful...but all good things usually come to an end.
""Kiss of Fire"" is powerful, captivating, and intensely riveting.
A truly beautiful film.
I searched and searched and searched and FINALLY found it on DVD. It only includes a chapter selection (1-29) and captions (english subtitles or none). The main menu has a gorgeous picture of Christina Applegate on it with some fireworks in the background.
If you've seen ""Kiss of Fire"" and you're looking for the DVD, I found mine at the Virgin Mega Store in Westside Downtown Disney in Orlando, FL. Well, that's only if you live near there or are planning to go there. ...",1061683200,5,1153,4.917948717948718
