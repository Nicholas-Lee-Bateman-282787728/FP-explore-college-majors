8475246,5,B005IXSNE4,"Home movies Ken Murray made from the 30's on.  So great to see Lew Ayres at age 19, especially if you know the backstory of his life from WW2s, on.  Cary Grant, Marion Davies, etc.  No professional filming here - just the same as if you or I would take a camera and go film some of the  greatest actors of the 20th Century.  I remember Ken Murray from TV in the 50's.  He's a great narrator in this collection of clips.
Apparently this is a Region 2 DVD - not clearly indicated by the UK sellers.  If you don't have a region-free player, go get one for about $30 from any store that sells electronics.  This DVD is worth the trouble.  You can see Tom Mix with his 30-year old horse and the car Mix was killed in two weeks later.  Keep your U.S. player and just hook up the region-free as well

The reviewers who gave this little gem one star because they didn't seem to notice they were buying from the U.K. are angry because
they expected region 1 DVD's.  Anytime you buy DVD's from Europe, the buyer should realize it is doubtful they are region 1 discs.  At
the very least, the buyer should contact the seller to make sure.  I have a region 1 and a region-free DVD player because I've  often been able to get DVD's cheaper from the U.K.
Hollywood Without Makeup is pure nostalgia at its best.  Enjoy.",1480982400,,1303,4.235772357723577
8475247,1,B005IXSNE4,"This was a very deceiving purchase.  Nowhere on the listing does it say it will only play in ""Region 2"" compatible DVD players or that a DVD player with that setting is even necessary.  This means that the DVD will not play in America.  Ridiculous!  on top of it, the company won't accept a return of the DVD if it has been opened and found to be defective on an American DVD player.  The email from customer service was friendly but did not help the situation except to take my money for a DVD that won't work.  Bogus! I will never buy from this company and I suggest any other American customer does not as well.",1472601600,4,614,4.25
