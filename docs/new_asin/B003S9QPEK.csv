8404103,5,B003S9QPEK,"I have not been able to find this item for sale on DVD, but I can attest to the quality of the program. It came on KLRU yesterday afternoon, and I suspect it appears occasionally on weekends. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in folk art, ecclesiastical decoration, Texas history, and related subjects.

The film provides an overview of the history, architecture, and artwork of the famous painted churches of Texas. They were created and commissioned mostly by the immigrant Czech communities of rural Texas in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and the film situates their construction within this larger immigrant movement. As such, the film is part history lesson, part art tour, and part exploration of the legacies left by these disappearing communities. The film does an excellent job of capturing the beauty of the various churches - mostly Catholic, but with one or two other examples of other Eastern European faiths as well. Though clearly made with a relatively low budget, the video captures the colorful and delicate decorations of the walls, ceilings, and altars, while it also contrasts the impressive yet simplistic elevations of the buildings with the scenery of the eastern farmlands and the Texas Hillcountry.

Beyond the content, the overall production is also quite well done. Interviews with historians, art commentators, and local residents are well balanced, giving a good impression of the artistic achievements of these parishes alongside their more human histories. The narration is quite informative and has a pleasant Texas twang to it, though it occasionally falls into the trap of saccharine sweet sentimentality. More effective is the light religiously inspired music (Ave Maria pops up throughout) that provides a background to the lingering images of the churches and their local surroundings. Measured in its pace, the film does an excellent job letting the viewer soak in the rich art of the churches and proves calming, especially in contrast to the schizophrenic attempts at documentary film-making produced by the History Channel of late.

Though I have sadly been unable to find this for sale online, I regularly check to see if it is available. I find the painted churches a real testament to the faith and artistic visions of an understudied immigrant community, and - as someone not native to Texas - lament that information on these beautiful works of art are not readily available nationwide. For anyone interested in the subject, a companion site remains available despite the scarcity of the DVD.
