1981827,4,B00019GHQQ,"It is a [romp] through the seedy underbelly of Hollywood. As three actresses at varying stages of their careers, these ""girls"" go through living hell! And you're right there for the hilarious ride!
It really touched a spot inside of me (...)  and reminded me of my group of friends on a good boozy bender!  Fun and campy, it stands wigs and shoulders above the rest. I haven't seen this much camp since Mariah Carey's titanic debut in ""Glitter"". What more can I say about a ""Valley of the Dolls"" done by drag queens? Brava ladies, bravas!",1080000000,3,538,4.536082474226804
1981828,3,B00019GHQQ,"First the good news: the acting, the makeup, the sets, the colors all add up to one of the most gorgeously campy looking films of all time. All three of the leads are very good.  Having only seen Jack Plotnick in non-drag roles (Ellen, The Jenny McCarthy Show on MTV, Buffy the Vampire Slayer), I have to say he was very funny and his wig was perfect, but the real honor goes to Jeffery Robeson whose Varla (his off-screen drag persona as well) is so spot-on perfect that a few times I had to remind myself that this wasn't an actual woman.  Even more amazing is seeing the male Robeson out of makeup (on the extras) as a nice-looking young guy.
The bad news is that as great as this film looks and is acted (at times, it seems to bring to mind Comedy Central's ""Strangers with Candy"" for the way the actors play many things straight), the film suffers from ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch syndrome: it goes on too long and runs out of humor steam. An hour or 45 minutes would have been sufficient for the film's running time. The plot gets stretched and by the time Evie's ""speciamercial"" revelation occurs, I wasn't laughing anymore. The sense of glee was wearing thin, and not even the pool party flashbacks could perk the film up again. Plus, the ""naked"" Evie was pretty gross and unnecessary.
All in all, a decent film with a generous portion of extras on the DVD.",1079481600,11,1366,4.438247011952191
1981829,5,B00019GHQQ,"Sure it was quirky and campy... and even more rude than SOUTH PARK... but it had heart.
I've seen Jack Plotnick in small character roles for many years, so it was really nice to see him in a leading role.  Clinton Leupp (who pretty much stole the show in that bathroom scene from the movie TRICK) also shines brightly in this movie!  He's beautiful as a woman and in addition to being hilarious, he knows how to tug at the heartstrings.  Jeffery Roberson was like the cherry on top of the sundae!  Even for being so physically large, he has a vulnerable quality that works so well for his character.
I highly recommend this movie for fans of this genre.  Watch it with a group of friends and a bottle of wine (or a can of Cheez-Whiz)!",1076630400,16,734,4.328467153284672

1981884,1,B00019GHQQ,"I made it half way through the film. I wasn't really enjoying it, but I was willing to finish it until Coco started a romance with the doctor who drugged and raped her in the hospital. Watching their ""date"" scene--particularly her struggling as he forced her face toward his crotch--was too much for me. Rape isn't a punchline. There's edgy, and there's totally inappropriate. This movie went for the latter, and I'm not entertained.",1400371200,,433,4.864864864864865
1981885,5,B00019GHQQ,"I've watched this at least three times and it never fails to elicit plenty of laughter. All three performers are spectacular, and it's full of great, absurdist humor.

1981895,5,B00019GHQQ,"Ok boys and girls it's time to admit the truth: gay comedies are by and large underwhelming if not just unwatchable.  Unfortunately the latter has become the standard for the genre.  They are so schmaltzy and risque and predictable that it feels like I'm losing IQ points just watching them.  Girls Will Be Girls on the other hand is genuinely, really, truthfully funny.  It's a movie about women (earnestly played by gifted drag queens) living together Golden Girls-style puking, drinking, screwing, smoking, acting, revenging, (I know it's not a word but it fits so well!) and MURDER!  Asteroids!  And more drinking, fighting, making up, and on and on.  What makes this movie genuinely enjoyable is that the people who made it were in on the joke.  They served up a stinking pile of drag comedy genius and they're gonna make you eat it and lick the plate and ask for seconds.",1377043200,,877,4.76158940397351
1981896,5,B00019GHQQ,"With an all-male cast, how can you go wrong? This low-budget film needs more recognition for its creativity and fabulousness. If you're a fan of ""The Birdcage,"" definitely check out ""Girls Will Be Girls."" There's not enough clock stuff!",1376956800,,236,5.076923076923077

1981899,1,B00019GHQQ,"Maybe got through the first thirty minutes before I gave up on it.  The characters, or should I say caricatures, just weren't endearing, even in the campy way they were intended.  Big time loser...",1362182400,,197,4.764705882352941
1981900,1,B00019GHQQ,"I am very open minded, liberal, and a lover of drag shows and drag queens.  My friend and I thought this was going to be a fun spoof with Drags queens as the stars.  We are also female which may make our view point different from that of males.  The drag queens play real females even though they start the movie showing them putting on wigs so you at first assume they are drag queens.  They have sex like women and make some seriously disturbing choices that most women would not make even to be funny.  It is so over the top stereotypes of how some people must think woman are that it makes you physically ill and we ended up turning it off after about 30 minutes. I think because it took itself so seriously, that the humor was lost for us.  I suppose this movie has it's place for queens and transgender audiences that relate better to the humor of the movie, but it was lost on us female lovers of drag shows because it portrayed woman so horribly. So I gave it one star for an audience like myself....liberal, part of the lgbt community, and female...but for others I guess they love it.  Just think about your point of view before you rent it...it may not be for the gals even though it has girls in the title.",1350864000,4,1218,4.246753246753247
1981901,5,B00019GHQQ,"I love this movie, I've probably watched it at least 20 times. Each time I see something I never saw before! So much whit, and so much underlying humor!

1981903,5,B00019GHQQ,This is a hilarious movie and I highly recommend it if you have a good sense of humor.  The movie was like new. I would order form this person again.,1315440000,,149,3.966666666666667
1981904,1,B00019GHQQ,"1 star isn't enough, in my view, in terms of a low rating for this movie... I don't know WHAT film it is tha the 5 star reviewers were watching, but i gotta tell you, this one ain't it...! If ever a wrong tree was barked up dear, this film's it!

The character references are brilliant, & the film could have gone somewhere... Instead of really bringing the story line together, the characters portrayed by the actors are SO damned disattched from one another, you could place them on opposite poles of the planet... The story... Hmmm... I don't think there's meant to be one... Well, not from what has been given in the film.

I think the director just got up one morning and said: ""I want glitz, I want glamour, colourful characters & set, I want gay guys dressed as women, an alcoholic, a tragic queen, a prospective actor, & a man whose bank account is larger then his endowment & a love triangle involving the 4 characters mentioned... To top it all off, I want them in the same movie all together...""

Listen, here's what i think, whatever this movie was trying to achieve, it hasn't... It falls short in EVRY way I have tried to think of how it all adds up... There's just no saving it...

There's a LOT of funnier gay films out there, (Might i even suggest ""Is It Just Me"" and ""Another Gay Movie""), And this one doesn't even classify as comedy... Its more arthouse, or something else... Come to think of it, Arthouse is WAY too kind for this film... Its a class of its own...

Hated every minute, its not funny, and its not worth the purchase...",1309046400,,1553,4.397212543554007

Girls will be Girls is the story of a Hollywood Diva whose own star has burned out decades earlier.  She is surrounded by her verbally-beaten assistant and a 'new girl' looking to be the next big thing in Hollywood.  The situations in which these three are placed never grows tired and the dialogue only gets more abusive and obtuse.

1981911,5,B00019GHQQ,"Evie (Jack Plotnick) is a washed-up B-movie actress who is decidedly not aging gracefully. She lives with Coco (Clinton Leupp), her more grounded friend who functions mainly as Evie's maid and abuse magnet. Into their lives walks their new roommate Varla (Jeffery Roberson), an aspiring starlet whose late mother Marla was also Evie's most hated acting rival. All of them have dreams, of course. Evie's dreams involve drinking as many martinis as she can and then having plenty of sex with anyone available. Coco still pines for the hunky abortion doctor that operated on her many years ago. Varla hopes to become the actress that her mother couldn't while dealing with the advances of Evie's gorgeous son Stevie (Ron Mathews). Of course, there are hidden motives galore, and more than one mean-spirited one-liner. Plotnick is quite humorous, dropping the most of them and the clips of Evie performing in the 60's stinker ""Asteroid"" resemble nothing less than Morgan Fairchild on qualudes. Leupp reprises the role of Coco from his scene-stealing moments in the movie ""Trick"", and he imbues the character both with a humorous sense of bad luck and an immediately sympathetic personality. Roberson is not quite as spectacular as his co-stars, but he gives the naive, trusting Varla a great heart and a hilarious scene involving opera and cheese in a can. When it's funny, it's very funny. When it's in bad taste, it's even funnier. The sets and costumes (as you would expect) are all letter perfect and there are as many sight gags as there are funny lines. Need cheering up?

Aside from that, the movie contained therein is funny and entertaining.  It has great sequences and looks really slick.  I wouldn't even consider this a ""gay-themed"" film in that the men playing the lead female characters are never revealed to simply be men in drag.  They are able to whimsically pull off their protrayal of robust women trying to earn acclaim in a tarnished Hollywood.  Yes, that certain drag queen wit and cynicism is here, but that is what makes the film stand out.

The story and arcs for all the characters are hysterical and don't rate as fluff.  The movie, in all, has a mainstream look and feel, even though one might expect a title of dubious quality.

Girls will be Girls is hilarious, nasty, campy, draggy (?), a hoot from beginning to end.

Really raunchy. Not for the prim and proper.

Be sure to check the special features: one documents the makeup job to change three ordinary-looking guys into fabulous queens; the other is a commentary on the making of the movie - on a shoestring, so it's fun to see how they solved the many production problems (it's shot in some guy's house) and produced a professional quality film.",1150848000,2,527,4.645161290322581

It really didn't appeal to me at first, since I'm not into drag queens but then I saw the trailer at the beginning of the ""Pieces of April"" DVD and thought it looked pretty funny.  I read the other reviews here and was convinced to buy it.

""Girls Will Be Girls"" turned out to be a real hilarious movie and is now among my favorite DVD's.  I've watched it a good half-dozen times since purchasing it last year and probably will again, very soon.

I recommend it to fans of one-liners and sarcasm but warn prudes against it, since some of the lines might be quite offensive to some.  Then again, as Marla would say ""Feelings are like treasures, so bury them.""

Also, I'd advise against buying the Canadian edition, as it doesn't include the animated menus which contain some hilarious lines not featured in the movie not the featurettes.  Since I'm in Canada, I ended up ordering the American version (and selling my other copy) just for those.

Enough said, now hit the ""Add to Shopping Card"" button!

I am embarrassed to admit that because most of the humor is very low-brow and slapstick.  The slut and alcohol jokes fly fast an furious (there is one line that you are guaranteed to repeat to your friends later), but only about half of them hit the mark, and to be honest by the end of the movie they get kind of old.  A lot of the humor is very campy - we loaned our copy to two of our lesbian friends who couldn't get into it at all.  So my verdict would be the first half is pretty funny, with parts hilarious, and parts that were good.  The second half was pretty lame, and by the end, I was pretty glad to see the end.  The hilarious parts in the first half were enough for me to want to own a copy.  My advice would be to rent this one first if you can.",1127433600,,887,3.938202247191011

1981932,5,B00019GHQQ,"All right, this is sooo funny. It is a strange movie. First you have to get to a certain point in the movie where you can be sure that the drag queens in the movie are playing actual women roles, so it's not a gay movie, or a drag queen movie. If you can get over that....there's still lots to get over hahaha.
The ""As-tro-phy-si-cist"" line is the best one, it had me stop the movie and laugh like a madman, it was unbelievable!!!
Then, when Evie (it's all about Evie tonight) tries to bed the guy she had the accident with, she throws him all the names of ""shows"" she's been in, including the (soon-to-be-on-dvd and raise-your-hand-if-you've-ever-seen-it-does-it-really-exist-?) ""Bewitched"" spin-off ""Tabitha""!!!!LOL, if there's something no-one has even seen, including this guy, then that's it!

The cons are that some plots are really unbelievable and distract from the movie, like how can Varla the fat one not see she's being pimped, ripped-off by the stinker and let him get away with her money, and the hunk (Evie's son) let him get away with his shoes? Hello??

Oh by the way, referring to the only long bad review here, there are loads of shows where straight men play VERY effeminate men. No-one complains (well, some do). And if there is someone who can do this kind of movie which mocks and plays around with stereotypes of gay many and drag queens, it's just them: drag queens. You don't complain when black people call themselves n****rs in movies, right? Between them apparently it's ok so those points fall flat.
On the other hand, yes this movie is crass, has very cruel jokes about abortion and rape (although at the end, when Coco still marries his ex-doctor/rapists, Edie points out just like that ""still, he raped you"" which is totally hilarious, like most lines from the movie) and you won't like it if you're not able to get over it and take it for what it is, a b-movie comedy played by drag queens out of which you get what you expect.

I've secretly followed his career, ever since seeing him on Ellen to his brief but memorable performance in ""Gods and Monsters"". Drag shows just haven't been my cup of tea. So, this review is solely based on your level of interest in that art form.
""Girls Will Be Girls"" is the story of three actresses, each played by men, who aspire, have aspired, or have expired in Hollywood. The entertainment from the movie comes not from the plot, however, but from the bitchy interchanges in between the queens as they fight and argue their way through the movie.
The actors playing the queens do an excellent job with the parts they have. Especially the aformentioned Plotnick, as an aging drag queen who is literally falling apart. And it's nice to see Miss Coco in another film (from her cameo in Trick), she plays her dramatic role with the right amount of pathos and camp (if that's possible).

1981949,4,B00019GHQQ,"When Tennyson penned ""The woman's cause is man's:  they rise of sink Together"" he likely had no idea just how synergistically a cause might co-exist.  This delightfully funny film is inspired as much by Shakespear as Charles Busch, for every female portrayed throughout is successfully done so by actors so deft that they are able to effortlessly overcome any and all physical limitations (and there are a few here) which, under less capable hands, might suspend a viewer's belief that these are actually women who possess attributes worth caring about--despite their considerable shortcomings.  This is even true of a remarkable five year old actor, who in a brief flashback scene, portrays one of the major characters as a traumatized little girl.
The story chonicles the lives of three full blooded women at different stages in life, yet facing the same issues of love, forgiveness, and reconciliation.  Their individual journies converge as they share their lives under one (very 1970's)roof, and embark upon the road to trancendence and redemption.
Filled with good old fashioned campy, tasteless, low brow humor it is destined to get Jack Plotnick and company on the most wanted list of the Conservative Right/Chirstian Coalition. A must see for anyone who is fed up and fearful of the new wave of humorless conservative tastemakers who seem to be committed to imposing their narrow minded definition of entertainment and acceptability on all Americans--many of whom just want a good old fashioned irreverant laugh, like those they will experience (despite themselves) here.
Most striking are the actors, who release us for nearly 80 full minutes from the adversity of human existence, and bring us into a world far more sordid, but ever so much more fun than the one we see or read about in the daily news.  Most importantly, their chemistry with one another is simply amazing, and a great treat to watch.
Also, one must make his or her way through the very entertaining and clever menus, which somehow make this classically campy romp all the more endearing.",1080864000,4,2066,5.064705882352941

She moves in with two other actresses: Coco, trying to find her true love but haunted by dreams of Dr. Perfect; and Evie, an aging actress trying to make a comeback.  Along the way, Varla meets Stevie, the handsome son of Evie.  He falls in love with her at first sight, but wonders if his ""tiny"" problem will get in the way of their being together.  When Varla gets her big break in a commercial, jealousy rears its head as Evie remembers the shocking and disturbing events that happened between her and Varla's mother, Marla.  Is Varla here to thwart her efforts at regaining her stardom?
This is a wonderfully campy and un-PC look at the Hollywood dream of making it big in the movies.  The story is a little slow in some points, but the actors more than make up for it with their delivery of the catty dialogue and their acting skills.  What also makes this a wonderful film is that all the actors are men: from Varla, Coco and Evie to Stevie, the nurse and Dr. Perfect.  Jack Plotnick (Evie), Clinton Leupp (Coco), and Jeffrey Robertson (Varla/Marla) are all phenomenal in their roles.  And Ron Mathews gives a fine, comic performance as Stevie.  The special effects are interesting, too, and quite surprising.
The DVD is great, not only because of the extras (like the funny deleted scenes), but each menu has a little routine either by all four of the main leads or by them in groups of two.  Special dialogue written and filmed especially for the DVD.  The picture is one of the sharpest I've scene, and the sound quality is perfect.

Jack Plotnick as Evie, Clinton Leupp as Coco, and Jeffrey Roberson as Varla trade on their larger-than-life drag personas to paint a picture of an unhappy (but colorful!) home, sort of a gender-bent ""Three's Company"" with a badly coiffed Grinch instead of Jack Tripper at its center. Ron Mathews does a great job as the loving son of Evie who gives Varla every little bit he can (and who is really easy on the eyes--what a knockout!). I saw this movie when it first premiered in Seattle, with Jack Plotnick introducing it, and I laughed until I cried. I was surprised it didn't get a longer run in theaters. I preordered the DVD as soon as it was available.
The DVD has funny snippets of dialog among the main characters as you choose from all the menus, and there is a small featurette on how ""guys will be girls"" through the magic of makeup. Richard Day keeps things moving apace with the writing and direction, and the set design alone (which I understand was mainly shot in Day's own home) is worth pressing the Pause button in several places. From the high-kicking theme song and opening montage through its final scenes, this movie takes you on a bizarre, tasteless, and yet in some ways heartfelt ride. And oh yes, Evie's accidental nudity still cracks me up every time I watch it--I don't care that it's train-wreck terrible, I laugh!
