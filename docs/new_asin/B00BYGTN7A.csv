8575594,4,B00BYGTN7A,"I've been collecting films for almost 40 years, I used to operate Fright Video mail order back in the day. I can't believe how picky and critical ppl can be. This Vinegar Syndrome release of DUNGEON OF HARROW is mindblowing. Drawing on the customer reviews I'd read I was expecting the color to be improved and much richer instead of drab but no one really got into the quality of the print in terms of definition and clarity. This Vinegar Syndrome release is an ABSOLUTE, POSITIVE UPGRADE. If you're accustomed to Sinsiter Cinema's print or some of the others I've seen, this upgraded viewing can be likened to watching the film for the very first time, a new experience. This is a great print.",1530057600,,695,4.612903225806452
8575595,3,B00BYGTN7A,The commentary track on Death by Invitation by 4 nerds is way more entertaining than the film itself. Actually the hillbilly accents of two of those nerds are more entertaining than this film haha. Dungeon is just ok. It's a cheap talkie movie and the print is still pretty crappy.,1495497600,,281,4.64
8575596,4,B00BYGTN7A,"I bought this DVD only for the film Dungeon of Harrow.  A great movie to watch while you're doing something else.  Made in the early 60's somewhere in the Texas boonies and amateurish all the way.  Sort of Poe-ish story wise.  Two shipwreck survivors, a nobleman and the ship's captain, end up stranded on an island inhabited by a madman, his leper wife, the wife's nurse, a slave who does the muscle work, and a servant girl who is perpetually victimized.  Lots of mayhem and sedate histrionics ensue.  Looks like the cast and crew made this during weekends so as not to give up their day jobs.  The music is re-used from the 50's Superman TV show.  The Alpha DVD is not very good quality.  The Vinegar Syndrome DVD is the one to get.  The film is about as re-mastered as it's going to get.  The color is very nice.  Recommended for fans of lousy movies.",1491004800,,855,4.410256410256411
8575597,3,B00BYGTN7A,"To be clear here neither of these two movies can be considered good. Dungeon Of Harrow is definitely high school play territory but Death By Invitation is one of the most boring films I've ever sat through.( I watch 500+ movies a year so I wade through the shallow end of the film pool so this isn't an idle comment).

A SLIGHT SPOILER: Dungeon first caught my attention on a morning tv broadcast back in 1968 or 1969. It was so so until the hero (if you can call him that) was locked in the dungeon. When the insane leper ""bride"" made her way out and started pawing him reliving her honeymoon night I went behind the chair gibbering in fright. END OF SPOILER. It is still an effective scene and if the rest of the movie were even half as good this would be remembered as a minor classic. But the acting, the sets and the narration scuttle this like the toy boat at the start of the film.

Honestly the film has never looked better and since it was probably shot on 16mm it won't. I happily bought this for Dungeon and consider Death By Boredom to be an extra that can be skipped.",1419724800,2,1080,4.237864077669903
8575598,5,B00BYGTN7A,"Dungeon Of Harrow - a giant jewel in the crown of Schlock B-Movie Horror - is finally available in a beautiful anamorphic widescreen print courtesy of the fine folks over at Vinegar Syndrome. Some people dislike this film because of its teeny tiny budget...however, I think it is a true merit to Pat Boyette's skills that he was able to produce a flick which has a similar tone to the Corman Poe movies but with a greater coolness and scare factor, made at a tiny fraction of the cost of those! An ominous tone, dismal atmosphere, creative writing and inspired performances - as well as a few very creepy scenes - have carried this bargain basement production into the 21st Century when so many others have been forgotten. DOH is concrete proof that you don't need a big budget to tell a good story. Anyone who has seen this film in any other DVD release has had to suffer with a print that looks and sounds like it was under water for a few decades - with abysmal picture, muffled sound, and color that fades in and (mostly) out! Here we have that same film in a 16x9 aspect ratio, colors that pop off the screen, clear sound AND a tiny scene that has been cut from EVERY other release so far!!! ""Death By Invitation"" is the other picture in this combo. I'm not a huge fan of that one but it looks better than ever before as well. Again, Kudos to Vinegar Syndrome for giving Dungeon Of Harrow, a classic that was oft-repeated at drive-ins and on ""Chiller Theater"" TV-Movies, the TLC it so deserved.",1389744000,4,1499,4.434782608695652
8575599,4,B00BYGTN7A,"I bought this DVD specifically for the movie ""Dungeons of Harrow"". This film fell into the public domain and has been available on budget labels for years. The problem is those budget releases use an vastly inferior print-it looks like a 3rd generation dub from a VHS tape. The movie is in color but those prints barely look sepia at best. This remedies those problems. While the print is far from pristine, it is VG+ and seeing the film in actual color was nice. While the plot and acting leave much to be desired, those familiar with this movie will find it so much more enjoyable as it is presented here. Beware those public domain prints-they just aren't worth it. This is the real deal.",1383696000,10,691,4.536
8575600,1,B00BYGTN7A,"I generally like ""bad"" movies, but I am thinking more along the lines of say, 1950's science fiction films. Attack of the Giant Leeches, Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, and similar titles are considered bad movies, but yet these types of movies are entertaining to say the least. The Dungeon of Harrow, well, it is awful. Some commentators seem to have liked this movie, but having seen hundreds and hundreds of movies in my lifetime I can say with all assurance this movie is terribly, terribly bad. If I can't stay interested, or even keep watching a movie, then that is the best indication of how awful it is. I haven't even watched the other half of this double feature and probably won't considering my impressions of Dungeons of Harrow. Oh, and to make things even worse, the video quality matches the movie itself in awfulness. If you've ever seen some of the Alpha Video titles that have been released in the past you will know what I mean; grainy, washed out, appears out of focus, etc.  I'm disappointed that I paid money for this, but may just trade it in as I can't see anyone else paying too much for it. Sorry folks, but I have to call it as I see it, and seeing is believing how bad this is.",1380758400,4,1203,4.394618834080718
8575601,5,B00BYGTN7A,"I've been searching for a good print of DUNGEON OF HARROW ever since it scared the crap out of me since viewing it as a kid on TV in the 60's. It has floated around in terrible condition on various PD labels for years, but finally Vinegar Syndrome offers a beautiful print in its original aspect ratio. There are still a few emulsion scratches here and there, but the colors pop on the screen. It's like watching the movie for the first time. Cudos to VS! As for DEATH BY INVITATION: the film is very bad, but VS offers a beautiful widescreen print of it. Here's my hope: That VS discovers the other two films of DOH's director Pat Boyette (especially THE WEIRD ONES) and gives them the same care as they did this film. I wouldn't care how much they cost, I would still buy them. I own all of Vinegar Syndrome's releases so far and am never disappointed with their condition. I may not like the films, but the presentation is flawless.",1367971200,14,935,4.379310344827586
