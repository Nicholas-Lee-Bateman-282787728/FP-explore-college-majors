The whole movie in a nutshell is Kadeem Hardison and the comedian Godfrey play two idiotic garbage men who act like black versions of Tom Green until they stumble upon some cash and start to spend the money on everything they wanted. The problem is the money belongs to some mobsters and one of them finds out that these two dummies have their money and go looking for them.

The movie is a complete and utter bore. Kadeem Hardison, how far has he fallen? He went from being in great comedies like Im Gonna Get You Sucka and and being in the best black show to grace the TV screen, Different World to being in garbage like this? Wow. Godfrey was always a sporadically funny comic but here he just stinks. Both Kadeem and Godfrey look like they are bored to death and if there is anything I hate is when people act bored in a movie. I understand this is a low budget flick but at least act like you're having a ball and overact a little. They both act like they don't want to be here and if that was the case they shouldnt have made this flick period. The acting is terrible and the jokes faller flatter than Suge Knight after a knockout. Dont waste your time on another deadly dull comedy. What Up is more proof that bad comedy is not fun just painful and unpleasant. Sweep this movie under the rug and stomp it!",1221782400,,1360,4.271317829457364

So if you have some household chores to do, rent this movie and you soon you will have them all done. Totally boring.",1214870400,2,274,4.188679245283019
