4883884,2,B005SH63HO,"This is a 30 or 40 minute little puzzler jammed into a movie length feature. Sorry, I want to like it, but it never gets above the normal JLA episode in terms of plot, character, and story. At the end we are slightly more aware of baggage the white version of Green Lantern is carrying. None of the other heroes reveal awareness.

Spoiler alert!
A great deal of the story requires a selected few JLA to communicate in very limited fashion and fly solo against picked enemies. Picked by the big bad,  that is. Now, JLA MO is for intensive comms, with lots of quarterbacking. That can't happen, because if it did, the selected heroes would tag out and heroes better equipped against their nemesis would tag in. Pretty mindless in other words.

I mentioned lack of character and story. A feature should really carry us forward and reveal things a normal serial can't. In this one we get a backstory  on... the big bad. We get no real insight on why he's bad mind you, just backstory.",1485129600,,980,4.48876404494382

4883901,5,B005SH63HO,"One of the absolute best DC Animated Movies in my opinion. JL Doom loosely adapts the plot of the famous Tower of Babel storyline wherein Ras Al Ghul manages to hack the Batcomputer and steal all of Bruce Wayne's dossiers on the Justice League team members. It is a classic Batman story about how paranoid Bruce is in regards to his super powered teammates, but the fact that Ras also hits the entire planet with a confusion ray that makes it so no one can communicate with anyone else (hence the Tower of Babel title reference) was a bit much for my tastes. In Doom, Ras is replaced by Vandal Savage who gathers together the various arch-enemies of the JL to enact Bruce's hacked dossier plans. Metallo shoots Superman with a Kryptonite bullet, Star Sapphire uses Scarecrow's fear gas to break Green Lantern's will, and so on. By focusing the plot on the subplot about Batman's paranoia instead of Ras' environmental terrorism, the movie works wonders while managing to do great justice to the betrayal the League feels for Batman's schemes. The ending gets a bit over the top, but it is still classic comic book fun.",1478131200,2,1118,4.680203045685279

4883976,5,B005SH63HO,"Well-written, crafty, really captures the character of the heroes well.  The problem with DC heroes in general is that many of them are virtually invulnerable, making it difficult to make challenging villains or threats.  The Martian Manhunter, like the Vision (Marvel) is one such character whose powers are far too broad and vulnerabilities never well-explained.  The DC universe, and this movie, could do without him.  This, however, is a minor quibble.  These movies should not be viewed as lesser works because they are ""comics"" or ""cartoons.""  They rival the best of what cinema has to offer, and are an art form that should be respected as such.",1464652800,,652,5.046728971962617

The DC animated films have been excellent for the most part thus far. Each one has been fun and most have been pretty good adaptations of the comics they were based on. This one is a reimaging of the story Tower of Babel by Mark Waid. This ended up being a pretty good take on that story adapted by the late Dwayne McDuffie.

Batman always has a plan, he always has a plan followed by a backup plan just in case. Those plans even go towards his fellow heroes in the Justice League. He has a contingency plan for each and every member in case they go rogue for whatever reason. Vandal Savage knows this and plots to take the League out using Batmans plans, he succeeds in obtaining them. He builds a team using one member from each hero's past to personally take them out using said plans. With the perfect plan for each member to be taken out is there anyone who can overcome what could be the final moments of the Justice League.

This was a fun watch that featured one of my favorite villains, Bane. All of the voice acting was perfect for each and every character as was the writing, direction and animation style. I also enjoyed the special features as I always do with these DC animated releases. We get a great documentary on the late Dwayne McDuffie, an excellent writer that most fans will remember from his work on Ben 10. We also get looks at Cyborg, and the stories that inspired this film in the Batman and the JLA feature. Then of course there is the digital comic from Tower of Babel, the sneak peek of Superman vs. The Elite and two wonderful episodes of the Justice League animated series involving The Joker. But of course my favorite thing is the excellent commentary from the creative team here. Over all this is a wonderful addition to any collection and I highly recommend it.",1462406400,,1818,4.437125748502994

4884058,4,B005SH63HO,"Unknown to the other Justice League members, Batman has created emergency plans to stop each of them, should they ever cross over to the ""dark side"". A criminal mastermind forms a Legion of Doom to sneak into the Batcave and steal the plans from the Batcomputer. Suddenly, members of the League are being taken down by their rivals. Batman realizes what has happened and tries to set things right. Tensions mount as the other members are angry at him for creating such plans. I thought that was a really cool plot, and the main reason why I gave the cartoon 4 stars. Overall, I think it's a good cartoon, though not as good as Crisis on Two Worlds or Doomsday. The rest of the cartoon deals with the more typical plot of bad guys going for world domination and ultimately being defeated by the good guys. If you like these superhero cartoons and find it for a good price, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

4884128,5,B005SH63HO,"I own every DC animated movie: this is my favorite (so far): this is the one I rewatch the most BECAUSE when I'm in the mood for Justice League, I want ro see the JL being the JL doing essential JL stuff. I adore everything animated since Bruce Timm started Batman BUT I am by no means a hardcore comics fan so I don't care for megatwists like evil Aquaman, Wonder Woman goes bad, 60 year old Batman, Thomas Wayne Batdad, Year One, Day Zero, New 52, Alternate InfiniCrisis yadayada: just meat and potatoes superhero stories are witty enough, in a universe that is so traditionally well flushed out it needs no exposition. I'm tired of the gritty fauxgoth world weary scenarios with over the top fateoftheworld stakes: just these superheroes-  as-is in their fictional backdrops, supernatural principles,and supporting cast,- are a fascinating enough springboard for terrific humor, conflicts, adventure plots, and universal human observation. We know who they are: we don't need hypertwists, like Left-Handed Batman, or Superman with eyepatch, or Wonder Woman IN BLACK! I prefer Flash offers Wonder Woman a latte - because they don't have coffeemakers on Themiscura- than see President Superman Rules the Negaverse in Blonde. So for me, Doom is Justice League essentials: each character is unique, acts uniquely, and contributes uniquely to ending a crisis caused by familar supervillainous personalities. As long as Batman has gadgets and no beard, Superman has laser vision and no earrings, and Wonder Woman has grace & wisdom and doesn't wear a baseball cap, I'm probably going to eat it up: so far, Doom is the closest to a straightforward JL movie, so I rewatch it the most when I'm in a JL mood.",1440201600,,1701,4.9475524475524475

4884184,2,B005SH63HO,"How the heck can Superman not only breathe in outer space, but talk in outer space too?

The animation was too anime for my tastes and it irked me how Superman's emblem was never once drawn correctly. Not a fan of Cyborg particularly, and this incarnation of him lacks the charm the New Teen Titans version had. All in all I would have preferred Hawkgirl. In fact the roster in this movie is full of problems; we get Hal Jordan as Green Lantern, who is nowhere near as cool as John Stewart, and we get a Barry Allen Flash who is actually being played like the Wally West version. I would have rather just had Wally West. As for the plot it really feels like a relic from the sixties, but not in a good way, with talk of somehow moving the Earth out of the way of the impending solar flare, the JLA managing to hook up the Legion of Doom's headquarters to the League satellite's power cells in just under eight minutes (luckily the Legion of Doom's headquarters comes with handy giant power adaptors that can be hooked up to giant cables that the JLA satellite just happens to have, kind of like hooking up cable wires to the back of your TV set), and the JLA deciding to fight the Legion of Doom in the silliest way possible, by attacking their direct counterparts. Superman could have taken out Bane and Cheetah with one punch each, freeing Batman and Wonder Woman to help the others; instead he decides to go after Metallo.

And there are plot holes that individually don't matter much, but which become annoying when they start to pile up. Why didn't Star Sapphire just take Hal's ring when he gave up and let it slip off his finger? Why didn't Metallo finish the job against Superman? If Cheetah's part of the plan was to poison Wonder Woman why not use a poison that could actually kill her immediately? How could Mirror Master touch anything when he was in ""hologram mode"" in the Batcave? Batman claims the hologram mode was the reason the Batcave's sensors didn't detect him, because ""there was nothing for them to lock onto."" Okay, so how does Mirror Master carry that computer doohickey around and manage to place it on the bat-computer if he's a hologram? And so on.

As for the extras, the commentary would have been cooler if people from the animated series side of things were commenting rather than Geoff Johns and Mike Carlin, and I found the ""Guarding the Balance: Batman and the JLA"" featurette just silly: I don't need comic book writers lecturing me about the human race and its struggle with dictators through history. Stick to the funnybook source material, guys.

The one saving grace of this movie was the voice cast; not only the reliably excellent Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly for Batman and Superman (is there any reason to ever cast anyone else to voice these two?), but also actors like Claudia Black, Juliet Landau and Olivia d'Abo for villain roles: they all knocked it out of the park.

All in all though, this movie is a rental at best.",1430006400,,2965,4.524253731343284

4884206,4,B005SH63HO,"Culling the primary plot from ""JLA:  Tower of Babel,"" the DC animated feature ""Justice League:  Doom"" gives us an excellent glimpse into a world where Superman, Batman, Flash, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, and the Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) face their greatest challenges individually and struggle to defeat an enemy that has put into play a contingency plan orchestrated by a member of the Justice League itself!

Without giving too much away, the primary villain puts out a call to some of the JL members' greatest foes including Mirror Master, Bane, Cheetah, Metallo, Ma'alefa'ak, and Star Sapphire.  His plan is to have them individually take out members of the League and then, surprise, surprise, take over the world!  Does he succeed?  You'll have to watch the film to find out.

The story plays out quickly and is loaded with humor, especially a decent amount from Alfred Pennyworth early on, and as the plot thickens, we realize that the enemy has used one of the League's members' contingency plans in order to make an attempt at wiping them all out.  As the individual members of the League fight for their lives, Cyborg is called in for the assist and helps them tackle their problems head on.

The animation is vibrant and clean, and all of the voice acting, especially that of Nathan Fillion (Green Lantern), Kevin Conroy (Batman), and Tim Daly (Superman) is excellent.  The pacing is solid and I never grew bored with the story.

Overall this is an excellent addition to the DC Animated Universe.  DC has proven once again that it has the chops to create some excellent animated films.  Now only if they could telegraph that into their live action film universe!?!?!?!?

Assembled by Vandal Savage, the elite members of the Legion of DoomBane, Cheetah, Mirror Master, Star Sapphire, Maalefaak and Metalloare shown how to beat each and every member of the Justice League of America. Using the specific weaknesses of each hero, the Legion heads out to destroy their counterparts and bring them to their knees so Vandal Savage could implement the next phase of his plan: annihilating the majority of the human race so he can bring about a new world order from its ashes.

To make things worse, Vandal Savage didn't discover how to destroy the Justice League on his own, and when the answer as to who was responsible is revealed, the JLA is rocked to its core with the fate of the world hanging in the balance.

Man, I love this movie. It features an all-star cast of all-star superheroes going up against an all-star roster of evil supervillains. Finally, we get to see the villains stick it to the heroes in a big way and not let up until the JLA is down. And I mean really down. Its not often you see Superman on the brink of death, Batman humiliated and defeated, Flash completely screwed, Green Lantern a broken man, Martian Manhunter totally incapacitated, and Wonder Woman so messed up she doesnt know what to do or which way to turn.

This flick is based on the Tower of Babel Justice League story arc by Mark Waid, who is arguably one of the best comic book writers on the planet. I cant comment on this flicks faithfulness to that storyline because its been over ten years since I last read it, but I do remember the overall premise and this movie delivered on that.

The heroes and villains look great in this movie, and it does well in showcasing their various powers and abilities.

Its also an exciting movie that is fast-paced, has a sense of atmosphere, a sense of taking place in the overall DC Universethanks to other heroes and villains not mentioned above showing upand gives the JLA a threat that even they might not be able to handle. And thats the thing with a JLA movie: the threat needs to be so huge and so dangerous that it takes them as a team to solve the issue, and considering each one of them is extremely powerful in their own right, that threat needs to be mega huge, not just physically but psychologically as well. Justice League: Doom has that and delivers it in spades.

Also features the voice talent from the Justice League animated series so that totally adds to it as well, giving it a sense of familiarity.

Out of all the superhero movies on the market, this is easily one of my favorites and is good viewing for kids and adults alike.

Highly recommended.",1424476800,,2639,4.50418410041841

The problem is that the heavy hand of DC corporate seems to have forced changes that conform to their ""New 52"" status quo.  Those changes adversely effect the wonderful chemistry that the Justice League had in its animated series.  John Stewart is gone as Green Lantern and is replaced by the always unlikable Hal Jordan.  Michael Rosenbom is asked to play a less interesting Flash in Barry Allen.  Hawkgirl has been replaced by a much more boring version of Cyborg than fans of Teen Titans are familiar with.

4884219,5,B005SH63HO,"My sons (8 y/o and 5 y/o) and I really enjoyed this entry.  Note that although we are fans of comic books films, we are not comic readers.

I grew up with SUPER FRIENDS as my entry in to the comic world.  What I liked about this film is that there are things that relate back to that show.  The LEGION OF DOOM assembly for one, and the style, look, and location of their hideout was another.  The opening scene, where our heroes have to thwart a gang of thieves dressed as playing card characters ties back to an episode of the SUPERPOWERS TEAM (a version of Superfriends) with a similar villain.

With this entry Vandal Savage has assembled a villain for each Justice League member, with thoughts of destroying them.  Bane, Cheetah, Metallo, Mirror Master, and Star Sapphire come together to accomplish this.  Of course, Savage may have other motives.

Having Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly back as Batman and Superman ties this to more modern creations, and the story moves quickly with lots of action.

Unlike some of the more adult DC films, this one has more mild language and violence, so it was just fine for my kids.  Really liked it.",1420675200,,1137,4.5245098039215685

4884308,3,B005SH63HO,"This is the first Justice League movie I had to see twice.  My first viewing took place immediately after I received it.  When I finished, I delayed submitting my review.  Then, when I was ready, I learned Dwayne McDuffie had passed.  Again, I delayed my submission to properly mourn a writer that breathed so much life into the Justice League mythology, no other animated screenplay writer could have done a better job.  Then, DC Comics created the New 52.  I postponed my review yet again to give this revamped DC Universe a chance.  I viewed the movie a second time so I could contrast the pre-52 and new 52 Justice Leagues (yes, I have seen Justice League:  War).

Justice League Doom had a promising start.  I enjoyed hearing the voices of Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly, Susan Eisenberg, Michael Rosenbaum and Carl Lumbly.  Their voice-over performances took me back to the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited animated series.  I have to admit, though, it was peculiar viewing Barry Allen (Flash) in action with Wally West's voice.  While the plot was more ideal for a JL or JLU two-part episode and lacked the cinematic intrigue of Justice League:  Crisis of Two Earths, it reminded me of why I will always prefer the pre-52 Justice League over the new-52 JL.  The heroes of Justice League Doom have a camaraderie so powerful, a betrayal of trust could not prevent them from collectively performing the one task they carry out ably:  saving the world.

I would recommend this movie to fans of the pre-52 Justice League that consisted of superheroes with the capacity to be both exemplary teammates and comrades that safeguarded the world and each other from the DC Universe's abundant representations of entropy and anarchy.",1410307200,3,1731,4.853242320819112

4884356,4,B005SH63HO,"We reviewed the DVD to ""Doom"" a few months, but have been slow to post any on the Net.
In This animated film, Batman, suffers from an Inferiority Complex (Not mentioned in the Film),
and devises plans to ""neutralize"" every member of the present Justice League, problem is,
he keeps these plans to himself leaving the door to the betrayal of the others in this film when the
plans are stolen by Mirror Master (Under the Supervision of Vandal Savage, whom plays the
role of Satan - not credited,-  as he mentions he is an ""immortal"" with his wicked plans to destroy
the League).  After the Plans are stolen, Savage purchases the services of all the JLA's most
vicious enemies to destroy each of their counter parts.  One by one, every member of the Justice
League is struck down at their weakness link, all by their opposite nemeses.  Savage then betrays
those he paid to take down the JLA, and offers them a dominion in the new world, after he plans
to destroy half of the world, with a missile directed to the Sun.

After a near edge recovery, and Savage's defeat, along with the defeat of the Justice Leagues
opposites, Batman tells the league that ""he would do the same thing again"" and calls
them 'damn fools' if they did not.

Truly suffering from Small Penis Syndrome, Batman proves he is no hero has
he has never had 'superpowers' of any kind, and feels the Justice League is
""too dangerous"" not to have a plan for neutralizing each of them.

Batman then tells Superman that The Justice league was his plan
to be neutralized in case ""he went bad"" - but this leaves  the question
- If the Justice is ever neutralized by Batman - there would no No Justice
League to neutralize him..and one must remember that batman kept his
plans secret from them, so even before batman gets neutralized, he already
had the advantage over each and one of them. So The balance is wrong in this film.

In true evidence of Batman's arrogance he tells the league that ""he
needs not a defense"" and ""I would do it all over again"", and If they
can't see his point of view ""I don't need to be here"" - the true
arrogance, stupidity, and the explicit view of himself as being ""right""
shows batman's head is obviously far to deep into his human cavity of
expelling his waste, this attitude clearly shows this to be true.

Batman is not a heavyweight, and he should have been banned by the
League (he left on his own at the end), and Superman gives him the
Kryptonite piece as a measure of good gesture than he still trusts him.
The very ""hero"" that betrayed not only him - but all the Members of the
Justice League.  We have had nothing disdain for ""batman"" as he is
nothing compared to the rest of the true Superheroes in the comic books,
Films and Television. There is nothing
""great"" about batman, nor the idiots that keep
making films about him and putting his name next
to a title.

What a great movie.  The title comes from the fact that the story revolves around occurences that happen at the Hall of Doom.

It was interesting to see Vandal Savage lead the Legion of Doom as opposed to seeing Lex Luthor as the leader.

It was interesting to see each league member matched with their evil counterpart, although I don't feel as if Cheetah is truly a match for Wonder Woman.  This was also my introduction to Martian Manhunter's evil counterpart.

It was great to see Cyborg as the wild card who changed the entire game.

4884523,4,B005SH63HO,"Batman: Alfred, get the Batwing ready. The Justice League is under attack.
Alfred Pennyworth: By whom?
Batman: By me.

Led by Vandal Savage, some of the League's most fearsome foes have united to destroy the League, using plans developed by Batman himself. It's Superman vs. Metallo, Batman vs. Bane, Wonder Woman vs. Cheetah, Flash vs. Mirror Master, Green Lantern vs. Star Sapphire, and Martian Manhunter vs. Ma'alefa'ak. The plans are effective and deadly, with each Leaguer succumbing in turn.

Batman: I've carefully studied every Justice Leaguer, past and present and created contingency plans to neutralize you should that become necessary.

The only problem is that Vandal Savage manages to sneak Mirror Master into the Batcave, hack Batman's systems, and steal the plans. But taking out the League is just step one of a far more sinister, and deadly plan. Vandal Savage, as usual, has his mind set on total world domination and, with the League out of his way, he just might achieve that goal, along with the deaths of billions of people.

I won't go into the details of the plans, as that's part of the fun, seeing the plans go into effect and then figuring out how they can be overcome. Suffice to say that, just as Batman was the source of the problem, so, too, is he part of the solution, along with a little help from a non-Leaguer, Cyborg.

One plot hole is that Batman states that his plans are intended to, ""Neutralize, not kill. Whoever implemented my plans altered them."" I can see that for some of these plans but some of them I can't figure out how they could be made non-lethal. And the final Vandal Savage threat and solution, frankly, seem a bit contrived. Still, these are small points in an otherwise enjoyable story.

The voices are performed by the usual Justice League voice actors, with Conroy, Daly, Eisenberg, Lumbly, and Rosenbaum reprising their television series roles, joined by Nathan Fillion as Hal Jordan/Green Lantern. These are all professionals who know their characters well and it shows. The animation is solid and the storyline intriguing; I can definitely recommend this movie.",1391904000,4,2123,4.916201117318436

There was much that worked very well about the story: the plans were, of course, brilliant death traps that really put our heroes in peril. The film also has some great action sequences. In addition, Kevin Conroy is Batman and it's a joy to see him in the role. The themes of betrayal, arrogance, and power are all explored albeit too briefly.

The film does, however, leave me with way too many questions such as why Vandal Savage and the villains held a victory party where Savage paid off on his contracts when the bodies of the Justice League had not been found. Given how many times, JLA members have escaped from death traps, this would seem kind of dumb. While Batman claims many of these death traps were meant only to neutralize, it's kind of hard to imagine non-lethal versions of these plans. And Superman's question at the end is dumb even if it does set up a great line from Batman.

4884566,2,B005SH63HO,"I am a huge fan of comic book movies and animation. Loved the Justice League, Batman/Superman animated series, loved The Avengers movie, and have seen almost all of the DC collection.

So when it came time to check out DOOM, I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into it. It's essentially a story about Batman's plans to neutralize every hero, falling into the wrong hands. The premise is great, the build up is great, the animation is cool. But the story is weak. How was it weak? Well, it was Batman's plans that ruined this movie.

Particularly, the way they neutralized Green Lantern and Wonder woman was just lame to the highest degree. I'm going to spoil this a bit, so if you're going to watch this movie, you should stop now.

*Spoilers* Basically, Wonder woman is attacked by Cheetah who manages to infect her with nanomachines that make her think every civilian is Cheetah. The way Wonder Woman was supposed to be defeated, was that she would tire herself out fighting all the Cheetahs.

Lame.

Green Lantern goes into a mine, is supposedly infected with fear gas, and then is convinced that he let a woman die. So for a good chunk of the movie, Green Lantern is sitting in a mine crying while all the heroes are being annihilated. Seriously?

Lame as well.

Do you really think Green Lantern would just be sitting there crying the whole time? Or that 'tiring out' Wonder Woman is an effective strategy? These were painfully weak moments in the film and really didn't hold up well against how Superman, Manhunter, Flash, and Batman were neutralized. Once Batman starts reversing his plans, the heroes go to deal with Vandal Savage. Unfortunately, at this point the movie lost me. I just wasn't satisfied or as interested in how the conflict was resolved, and I think there were points where I actually fell asleep.

Compared to the other DC movies, this is one I would definitely skip.",1383004800,,1890,4.671686746987952

Every character faces one of their biggest enemies and it is so exciting and emotional at times to watch them go through this.

If you are a fan of the Justice League or any of these DC characters, I strongly recommend you get this. It's on par with some of the best animated DC comics movies.

4884689,5,B005SH63HO,"This is the third DC Universe movie with the JLA, although it's a little different from the original plot as it breaks down the separate members of the League while uniting them in a common story. Loosely based on the Tower Of Babel story arc from the comics, Doom brings together the age-old tradition of ""superheroes vs. supervillains"". It was written by the late Dwayne McDuffie, who adapted it from the Tower Of Babel story arc from JLA comics.

 After stopping the Royal Flush Gang from using some fancy new phasing technology to rob a jewelry vault, the Justice League are targeted by a collected group of their personal enemies going by the handle, the Legion of Doom. Immortal formal caveman Vandal Savage organizes several supervillains to take down the JLA using plans heisted from Batman which were designed to neutralize members of the League. Each of the bad guys corner the heroes in their own way. Bane buries Batman with his parents, Mirror Master places an unshakable bomb on Flash, Cheetah tricks Wonder Woman into thinking everyone is her and attacking them, Star Sapphire uses fear toxin to scare Green Lantern into quitting, Martian Manhunter is set on fire by his evil twin, and Metallo shoots Superman with a Kryptonite bullet. Savage sets all this up to get the League out of the way so he can implement his master plan of using a nuke to send a giant solar flare which would kill half of the world's population, afterwards he and the Legion would take over what's left. Batman manages to free himself though, since his original plans didn't include subduing himself, and with Cyborg help the rest of the League from their own personal traps. They then reconvene to hear out Batman's reasons for creating scenarios for subduing them, but pull their act together to locate Savage's lair. After a classic heroes/villians battle, Savage's rocket does make it to the sun, so the League uses the special phasing technology Savage had made to protect themselves from the solar flare to make the entire planet temporarily intangible, making it safe for the flare to pass through the Earth. In the end, Cyborg is inducted into the League, but Batman decides to leave knowing his techniques weren't accepted by the other members.

Justice League: Doom is a splendid mix of the original comic book story, and merging it with a new plot. The original comic one had Ra's Al Ghul acting on his own as the main villain with the League of Assassins, and no other supervillains or Legion of Doom, and using Batman's plans to keep the League out his hair while he tried taking over the world. Dwayne McDuffie expanded on it by keeping the League down to its core members, while adding Cyborg probably because DC Comics was pushing to have him in the group to make them look more diverse. Young Justice animator Lauren Montgomery directed this, and her more realistic style stands out quite well. The vocal casting is great, with most of the Justice League animated series actors returning, except Tim Daly as Superman, Michael Rosenbaum playing the Barry Allen Flash, and Nathan Fillion reprising Green Lantern from the previous GL animated movie. It's a good enough stand-alone film that you can enjoy without having to see any of the other DC Universe flicks, and a decent foundation for a possible live-action Justice League movie.",1374451200,,3341,4.8374125874125875

We really like the Batman Animated Series, and some of the other DC animated movies (""Batman and Mr. Freeze"", ""Superman VS. The Elite"", for example), but have been disappointed, so far, with the Justice League animated series (though we're only halfway through Season One).  Despite good reviews our expectations weren't very high for this, but we found that it's, by far, the best Justice League story we've experienced.

The animation is really good, the story is tight, and the action is nonstop.  Add to that top-drawer voice characterizations and a fine sense of humor and the 77 minutes just fly by.  There are also some nice special features.  Highly recommended for fans of DC animation.",1370908800,,772,4.9

It was the right mix of campy one-liners and dream-team matchups to please anybody familiar with D.C. comics and the JLA, and a good ratio of serious moments and language choice (I think I recall at least a few ""damn""s) to not feel like this is not a Saturday morning cartoon

Other appearances include Cyborg, The Royal Flush Gang, and the main villain of the film Vandal Savage, who plots to send a missile to the sun to cause a massive Solar Flare to destroy nearly all life on Earth, and take over with the 6 villains. Other great things about the film include all the action scenes, and especially the suspense of each of the Justice League members (except for Cyborg) being beaten by their respective villain.

4884730,3,B005SH63HO,"Justice League Doom kind of re-imagines the old Saturday morning Super Friends cartoon by modernizing the Legion of Doom storyline.  In this version, the LoD is formed by the immortal Vandal Savage who, using information about the JL obtained form an inside source, brings together Bane, Cheetah, Metallo, Star Sapphire & Mirror Master to destroy the Justice League.  Vandal Savage has a greater overall plan that he knows will only succeed if the JL is out of play.  There is no Brainiac, but Savage still has the Brainiac-Dome in the swamp as a base.
The art was nothing special, pretty much on par the other DC releases.
The story was a bit simple and lacking, especially considering the PG-13 rating.  If they are going to go the PG-13 way, then the story needs to be more adult, or at least less silly.  I was specifically disappointed with the Green Lantern.  The lack of imagination with his ring's power and use was very obvious.  Wonder Woman was a little wimpy, and the Flash was more of a Allen/West combo than just the Barry Allen version that he should have been.
The ending was where I really got down on this movie.  I know I over analyze this stuff sometimes - we are talking about a cartoon with flying aliens, immortals, and robotic men, but it still annoys me when movies ignore reality and the law of physics.  I have always felt that if a story wants me the believe the incredible, then everything else has to be credible.
The movie as a whole was OK, but it was lacking in intelligence and excitement.  I doubt I'll ever watch it again.",1366675200,2,1558,4.551971326164875

4884761,4,B005SH63HO,"If you've seen one Justice League movie you've seen 'em all, right? It's amazing how the stakes can seem so meaningless even when they're so high.  See the Justice League fight off an alien invasion; see the Justice League fight off an extradimensional invasion; see the Justice League...you get the idea.  ""Justice League: Doom"" breaks the mold by making things very, very personal. Add in the fact that it features the DC Animated Universe voice cast and you have a recipe for a very different kind of Justice League cartoon.

""Doom,"" doesn't just take on the Justice League, it deconstructs each of its members.  It's one thing to beat Batman (Kevin Conry) up, but quite another to bury him alive with the corpses of his parents. We all know the Martian Manhunter (Carl Lumbly) is vulnerable to fire, but what would happen to him if he was set perpetually ablaze? In a lot of ways the fate that befalls each of the Justice League feel like a throw-down between two elementary school comic fans: anybody can beat Superman (Tim Daly) with a kryptonite bullet, right?

What makes ""Justice League: Doom"" so much fun is how it takes common horror movie plots and applies them to superheroes.  Flash (Michael Rosenbaum) gets trapped in a ""Speed""-like diabolical trap in which he can never slow down without exploding. Filling this Jigsaw-esque role is Vandal Savage (Phil Morris), the DC universe's resident Dr. Phibes.

If that was all there was to ""Doom,"" it would merely be a noteworthy addition to the DC Animated Universe. ""Doom"" is also a tongue-in-cheek throwback to the cheesy animated series, ""Challenge of the Superfriends"" and the Legion of Doom, complete with domed fortress and an unlikely agreement to work together to take down the Justice League.  Hilarity ensues.

Unfortunately not every diabolical plot is up to ""Saw""-level standards: Green Lantern's (Nathan Fillion) is particularly nuanced and Wonder Woman's (Susan Eisenberg) seems to be far-fetched to say the least.  But the denouement makes it all worth it when we discover who the real diabolical genius behind all these evil plans are.",1362268800,5,2109,4.982905982905983

Its the story... It had such great potential if DC just had the balls to pull the trigger on it. I hate when the bad guys down a superhero with his Achilles heel weakness .. and that hero gets wounded.. but somehow survives. In this movie Batman has secretly come up with a file full of ways to kill off ALL the Justice League and that file falls into the hands of a Mastermind of evil that exploits all the Leagues weaknesses and manages to kill.... no one... not a single hero... all manage to somehow survive.. DC is so great at lacing their movies with darker elements I just wish they would off  good guys once in a while.

4884790,4,B005SH63HO,"My main complaint about this is the characters didn't get a chance to develop more. I've seen many complain about Cyborg's role in the movie, which is dumb. In this movie they played up the scientist aspect of the character. Which seems to confuse people as to why he was added. I think a little more development for him and Martian Manhunter though would have done wonders for the movie. In this movie Batman was down-played as the invincible human  and up-played as the well prepared strategist. Cyborg was down-played as the power house and up played as the science tech genius. And in this movie considering both are considered human characters in most circles works well. It's hard to stand out on a team that has Three Superman level powers already. My other gripe is what happens with Green Lantern (You will see). And yes I know it was more than what was there. But if it was so easy for him to overcome it in the end why didn't he man up in the first place? Another example of why I dislike Hal Jordan as Green Lantern. And with 5 GL's on earth now there's no excuse to keep adding him to anything. John Stewart and Kyle Rayner have become more popular. Guy Gardener has changed ALOT character wise and is a more interesting Lantern. And Simon Baz is still a mystery and has a lot of room to grow.

4884822,4,B005SH63HO,"This 2012 animation deals with Batman's ""contingency plan"" of what if the JLA members got out of control or were mind controlled against their will. Batman, ever the paranoid type, has a plan to isolate each of them. Well, it turns out that a smart enemy breaks into the Bat's computer and implements it against the JLA, forms the Legion of Doom and then speaks of destroying about two thirds of the Earth.

It's more interesting as to how each JLA member is taken out rather than will they prevail because we know this is a JLA tale.

The more interesting aspect is when Batman is confronted at the end and some very tough choices are made with a melancholy result for the Bats.

Notable voices by: Tim Daly (Joe of WINGS and Pete of PRIVATE PRACTICE more recently), Kevin Conroy (the ever present voice for almost all of the Batman animations), Nathan Fillion (Captain of FIREFLY), Claudia Lee Black (the voice of Morrigan in Dragon Age: Origins), Phil Morris (lots of animated tales as well as SMALLVILLE, various Star Trek tales and a few other things) and Michael Rosenbaum (Lex in SMALLVILLE). Fans of the video game ""Skyrim"" will recognize some other voices. Huzzah!

I didn't want to say who they all played so you could figure it out yourself (that's part of the fun, right?). But, if you must I put their voice connections below in spoilers.

ANIMATION: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B to B plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: C plus to B minus; SOUND/MUSIC: B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B; WHEN WATCHED: mid December 2012 (streamed)

SPOILERS: I liked how Batman just upped and left the JLA before they had a chance to boot him out. That's totally a part of his as**ole persona. Heh.

Voices: Tim Daly is Superman, Nathan Fillion is Green Lantern, Claudia is Cheetah, Phil Morris is Vandal Savage and Michael Rosenbaum is The Flash.",1355788800,4,1860,4.722222222222222

4884833,4,B005SH63HO,"Ok, I am a huge fan of the new JL series (I have all of the seasons on DVD- and all of the movies). This one isn't super high-concept; the fight scenes end a little illogically or the victories come too easy; and one could even call this film redundant but it is still entertaining and is still pretty darn good.

The tribute to Dwayne McDuffie in the features is absolutely beautiful and sincere. This makes it all worth it.",1355702400,,425,4.3125
4884834,2,B005SH63HO,"Plot: The plot is ok and had great potential. Had this movie been split up into 2 parts, it could have been great. The idea of having the enemies of each hero expose their weaknesses to achieve defeat is excellent. However, considering each idea for defeating the superhero was developed by Batman, some should have been alot better. Especially when it comes to flash and wonder woman. The plot for Superman has been done over and over again. The weaknesses exposed for Martian Manhunter and Green Lantern were very good, however. I would have liked to see more time devoted to this section of the movie. This way each plot could have been equally devious. The end was rushed and the resolution was just weird and amature.

Voice Acting: The voice acting was good. I'm a huge fan of Kevin Conroy as Batman. But, admittedly, the cast didn't have much to work with.

Animation: This was the worst part of the movie. The animation was not very good. I was particularly disappointed with this. The character faces appeared devoid of emotion and felt flat.

Action: Boring. I watch JLA movies to see the JLA work together. In this movie, however, each battle is seperate. They never actually work together to defeat even one foe. Instead, they all spread out and fight the baddies alone. The only instance where this changes is in the beginning with Batman and Flash working together.

OVERALL: Totally Forgetable

::::::::::::::SPOILERS:::::::::::::::::::

I grow tired of the kryptonite bullet. Superman's tagline is ""Faster than a speeding bullet."" He's almost as fast as the flash. There's no way a bullet fired anything but point blank to the head would ever hit Superman. Writers need to be more inventive with this. It always looks dramatic, but really isn't.

Bane burrying Bruce Wayne alive...and Bruce's ""Kill Bill-esque"" escape from the situation was equally lame. I would rather have seen Wayne hospitalized and communicating from a hospital bed. This would have added to the drama while forcing the writers to depend on Batman's intellect, rather than his physical skill.

There had to be something better than a lame poison that keeps Wonder Woman fighting until she dies. I'm not as familiar with her lore, but I imagine Batman would have had something more effective and more easily administered.

I did, however, love the Martian Manhunter's method of torture. Of course, it had to do with fire. But to be on fire constantly for days...that's great.

Additionally, using the fear gas of Scarecrow to induce doubt and fear in Green Lantern is equally smart. I liked this as well.",1355616000,3,2590,4.919724770642202

I may be missing something but it doesn't really matter much.

Justice League - Doom was much more than the title entailed. It paid distinct homage to the old Justice League series (the Hall of Doom, Cheetah, etc.) but Vandal Savage was no Lex Luthor- he was worse. Lex only wanted world domination- Vandal Savage wanted world annihilation!! There are twists and turns everywhere you look - not a dull moment.

I was expecting the entire all star cast; not that it matters but what's with Timmverse always using ""Hal jourdan"" and ""Barry allen"" for most of the DC titles? This is the new age, where is Kyle Rayner and Wally West the ones from superman the animated series? Their  the ones who should have been in this movie along with their original voice cast. The Flash seem a little too serious what with using big words in all, isn't he suppose to be the clown of the league always joking and messing around? The story could have done without Cheetah and her awfully annoying voice however all the other characters voices were spot-on.

The visuals and colors were done very well.  The animators did a great job although it would be nice to have an American animated DC movie at some time.  Metallo and Bane looked awesome.  I kind of wished they use the same animation style for bats and supes from superman/batman apocalypse but this was okay.

In this movie, they plumb the depths of the psychological profiles of the heroes to construct plausible situations where they could be defeated.

I just want to point out that the Ultraviolet/Flixster model of delivering digital copies is absolutely HORRIBLE. You have to create a Flixter account then an Ultraviolet account and then download a copy of their desktop software. The install for the desktop software is also Horrible. You need to download around 50 MB of data just to get the install and the install starts out telling you that it's getting around 16 MB, then when it reaches that, it says it is getting more and then more again. And even after that, you still can only stream the movie.

4884952,3,B005SH63HO,"The artwork was good, the characters were good. Some of the villains used really surprised me. This is not a spoiler: the Royal Flush gang makes an appearance.

I felt like the movie was going well and was pretty smart up until the main villain revealed his master plan. At that point all science and intelligence went out the window. The Justice League also disappointed me because they had everyone fight their rivals. If any of the team members would have helped Superman, who was fighting the only villain he was weak against, he could have easily defeated every other member of the Legion of Doom. Is Green Lantern weak against kryptonite and I never noticed? Also the position of the sun and the speed of light are convenient to however much time the movie has left.

Now to get serious--- it is not a bad movie. It feels like a comic book movie and it seems like some of the ideas could have been good but just did not translate in to animation well (any time there was an outerspace scene it made the universe some how feel compact).  Some of the characters were used better than I had ever seen them before, especially the cheetah woman and Flash.

This movie is actually very easy to describe and recommend. If you like the universe these characters come from you will like the movie. It is not perfect, it is not the best DCAU movie, but even the worst episodes of Batman TAS were enjoyable. This is a middle of the road Justice League story that begins and ends in a little over an  hour. Anything less than $15 is worth it. The artwork on the box looks good too.",1339545600,,1575,4.417241379310345
4884953,4,B005SH63HO,"As always, anytime Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly, Susan Eisenberg, Carl Lumbly, and Michael Rosenbaum assume the roles for which they have patented in the animated JL series, it is a cause for celebration.  Unfortunately, this ""movie"" falls short of that expectation.

The story line, involving Vandal Savage and a ""Legion of Doom"" in a scheme to change and take over the world, is rather far-fetched for even a comic book.  The dialog is not remotely as good as that in the two-part ""extra"" JLU episodes contained on the disc.  In fact, the JLU episodes are much better than the movie, which just seems to go nowhere, even with the stellar vocal talent.

The anime-look - of which I am not too fond- doesn't work here, making the characters look too stilted.  I suppose I have a preference for traditional-style animation.

A plus for the product is the documentary on the great Dwayne McDuffie, the late writer/animator responsible for much of the success of the animated series and the direct-to-video films.  It is informative and quite touching as friends, co-workers, and his wife pay tribute to him.

Let's face it, he can't stand a chance of being compared to Superman, the Green Lantern, the Flash or Wonder Woman. They are superheroes in every essence. They have super powers. Whilst Bats, is a crime fighter with stellar detective skills and a clear, preceptive, shrewd mind. He is usually portrayed as an accessory a side-kick. No matter how hard the writers give him a lead role in any of the JLA, It fails to convince me.
Batman, in my opinion, has always fared better when alone. He is always brooding, hard to get a long with. Is obsessive. With these traits, it's no wonder that Bruce Wayne is still a bachelor. it's better to go it alone.

Anyhow, this DVD was a treat and the dissension within the JLA makes it far more real.

4884977,5,B005SH63HO,"What would you say if your best friend whom you have trusted for the longest of time was discovered to have known all your deepest and darkest secrets? If that day ever came, he or she would use them against you to take you down. Enter the newest DCAU film `Justice League: Doom.

A secret society of super villains led by one of the most mysterious of them all finally has discovered how to bring the Justice League to an end, by turning them against each other. It turned out that one of them (you can probably figure out who) had files on each and every one of them, just in case. By using those secrets each of them is exposed and their vulnerabilities tear them up from within. Eventually as always evil is punished, but at what price?

This film is one of the better in the ever growing DCAU library. Unlike `New Frontier `& `Crisis On Two Earths',  `Doom' individualizes each of these super-heroes and shows a very human side to them. There are moments in this film that make you feel a bit uncomfortable as you watch each of them fight their inner demons. Of course, the action is great and when you see the easily predictable final good vs. evil showdown, it's hard to disappoint. The film also ends on a very different note, more of a melancholy ending which is also something I have not seen in these films thus far. Finally, the voice acting, it was great to see the original cast back in action. Bringing back Nathan Fillion to voice Hal Jordan is always a treat. It was a bit weird to see Michael Rosenbaum giving his voice to the Barry Allen Flash and not the wise cracking Wally West.  It shows how much these guys have grown together as a collective group.

As I thoroughly enjoyed this film,  I am always excited for the next DCAU film. The two disc edition includes a very heartfelt and in-depth look into the legacy of Dwayne McDuffie. It is definitely worth the extra money.",1335052800,,1895,4.415472779369628

4884979,5,B005SH63HO,"It's that time again. It's a new year and DC and Warner Premier are releasing their 13th home release with ""Justice League: Doom."" A new adventure for the Justice League feels like the return of old friends with the cast of the ""Justice League"" and ""Justice League Unlimited"" animated shows back. This was also the last script done by the late, great Dwayne McDuffie and as always he knocked it out of the park.

""Doom"" is loosely based on the ""Tower of Babel"" story arc from the ""JLA"" comics in the early 2000s. Though it takes cues from that story, it's definitely its own animal. McDuffie took the major parts of the arc, Batman had created secret files to use against the League if they ever went rogue, or something and they were stolen by one of their enemies. This is all just a very elaborate way to get the league out of the way for the real plan. Destroy half the world and rebuild as the villain sees fit. In the comics it was Ra's Al Ghul, here it is Vandal Savage; swapping one immortal villain for another works for me. What McDuffie added was a personal slant to it. Savage contacts a villain that has a personal stake or vendetta against a member of the League, and hence the Legion of Doom is born. I won't spoil anything but I will say the action is fast and well choreographed, starting with a pretty cool confrontation with the Royal Flush Gang. Things only escalate from there and the film follows a three act structure that works perfectly. They set things up in the first act, the second act is the confrontation between the Legion and the League and the results of that lead directly into the third act which is the resolution of the adventure.

Kudos to Phil Bourassa for some very cool designs for the Legion as well as in general. Bane's mask design resembling a skull was sweet, and Mirror Master's almost transparent design was just brilliant. Vandal Savage looks suitably superior, and I love the semi-Victorian/militaristic look they gave him. He truly does look like someone who has lived for centuries, and him keeping the tooth/claw necklace from his Neanderthal days is a nice touch. Bourassa was the character designer for ""Young Justice"" as well as the previous JL film, ""Crisis on Two Earths."" There's the same Watchtower design, Wonder Woman's Invisible jet is the same, and most of the character designs are the same. So in a lot of ways it feels like a pseudo sequel to that movie, and it can very well be taken that way much like ""Superman/Batman: Apocalypse"" was a sequel to ""Public Enemies"" even though the art was different.

The big draw here though is the voice cast. Throughout the releases we've had a few people return for voices, but never this many at once. Though George Newburn voiced Superman in ""JL"" it was Tim Daly that originated the voice in ""Superman: The Animated Series"" but couldn't return for JL when it first started. He has returned to the role a few times since then to much fanfare, and here he returns again joining the cast he should've been with originally. Also returning are Kevin Conroy (Batman, duh like you didn't know that), Susan Eisenberg (Wonder Woman), Michael Rosenbaum (Flash, but the Barry Allen version), and Carl Lumbly (Martian Manhunter), with fan favorite Nathan Fillion playing Hal Jordan (Green Lantern). Also reprising roles from the show are Phil Morris as Vandal Savage and Olivia D'Abo as Star Saphire. New to the cast are Claudia Black playing Cheetah and Bumper Robinson coming on as Cyborg. Even with changes like the Flash being less of a jokester, the voice cast still felt like an old friend you haven't seen in a while and missed. Everyone falls into their places without so much as a hitch and the banter between the team in the beginning gives us a feeling that they've been doing this together for a bit. It's all the more meaningful when things start to fall apart later.

The film is in my opinion one of the best of the bunch. I've yet to truly be disappointed with these though I could use a bit more variety in subject matter (only so many Batman and Superman stories can be told before we start losing fans here DC), this one provides that with all the different characters. Everyone gets a moment to shine, and no one feels glossed over. Some have felt things were tied up a little too quickly, for the tension that was brought to the team, but this is a movie and we need to get to the climax of the story. In the comics this arc was a set up for the next arc so they had time to really explore what the fallout was like, but I think the movie did a fine job with it, especially with Batman's decision at the end. If you've been a fan of these, or are just looking for some good superhero action pick this up. Also there is a scene in which Alfred shows he's the only person that can make Batman look like a petulant child! That scene alone is worth it.",1334707200,,4866,4.507361268403171

4884982,4,B005SH63HO,"Justice League: Doom is about the 50,000 year old man, Vandal Savage and his plan to wipe out a large part of the human race and put in his own social order.  But how to do that with the Justice League in the way?

Unlike the ""Tower of Babel"" graphic novel&nbsp;]] from which the film is based, the film concentrates more on the fighting between the JLA and their opposite numbers rather than the brooding Batman, though the Bats is prominent in most of the film.

Some shockers that entertain: Bruce Wayne's parents' bodies are gone.  Bane gives him a sucker punch and locks him in a coffin with his long dead father.  Seems to me he got a lot of inspiration from that == beating his way out of the coffin was quite amazing.

Batman has a contingency plan if the JLA ever got crazy and somehow the bad guys find out about it and using Vandal's technology get the data from the Batcave and then use it to put the League out of action.

Several points that I liked, others I didn't:  How did the bad guys find that Batman had this file in the first place?  If it was revealed I missed it.  Wonder Woman is drugged to believe that she is fighting Cheetah,  many copies of her.  Now if the serum made WW believe this, then OK.  But at some point in the fighting would she not have realized that they were all fakes?  And when Cyborg came to her and explained it all and gave her an antidote, she still asks what happened.  Really?

OK, now the parts I liked:  The amazing way Flash figures out how to beat on Mirror Master, a favorite of mine from the Silver Age of Comics.  Really great telling of Hal Jordan as he is convinced he killed people in a mine shaft and apparently has been there for hours clutching a dead body.  Still, a great piece of psychological torture thanks to the trickery of Star Sapphire.

The other heroes have their own demons, but the above two were the most impressive.

Bottom Line:  Got some great features in this two disc set, but the storyline and voice actors for Doom, though the plot thins at parts, is a valid entry into the DC Animated Universe.  Do buy!

Voice Actors!  Claudia Black gave a British accent to Cheetah which I thought clever.  Lots of repeat actors from Crisis on Two Earths.

I am a HUGE Superman fan. Aside from Batman: Under the Red Hood, the last few DCAU flicks have been not up to the usual level. Something was missing....

Justice League: Doom is what I have come to expect from the DCAU! Whoever decided to bring back the old favorites, like Tim Daly, Kevin Conroy and Susan Eisenberg made the right choice. The inclusion of these actors makes up for the some of the movie's detractors. I was not impressed with the way the characters looked.

On the flip side, there were some very good scenes, like the one where Green Latern protects the earth.

4884992,4,B005SH63HO,"Exit Ra's al Ghul. Insert the even more immortal Vandal Savage. The only reason I can think of for swapping Savage for Ghul is that Vandal holds more cachet by virtue of being even more long-lived (dude's been around since the dawn of man, for cripe's sake). Vandal Savage, eternal and brooding and nursing a case of crazy, is ready to implement a master plan which would wipe out half of humanity. But, first, he's crossing his t's and dotting his i's. He eyeballs them capes in the Justice League and recognizes them as formidable enough to foil his fun.

In the swamps of Louisiana, in the Hall of Doom, Vandal Savage founds the Legion of Doom, gathering to him a collection of super-villains, each a (less exalted) nemesis of a respective Justice Leaguer. He lays out a series of fiendish strategies guaranteed to eliminate the Justice League. But Vandal Savage did not come up with these strategies. He's not privy to inside knowledge which would allow him to exploit each weakness of the JL members with such precision.

JUSTICE LEAGUE: DOOM, written by the late Dwayne McDuffie, loosely adapts Mark Waid's classic ""Tower of Babel"" story arc from 1990. It's a good film. The action sequences are taut and well-animated and seriously put our heroes thru their paces (I really liked their opening battle with the Royal Flush Gang). For me, who's read and re-read Waid's ""Tower of Babel,"" the fighty fights serve as appetizer. The main course should've been the scenes which explore the rift that develops within the Justice League. I wish the film had spotlighted those moments more. It's a riveting morality play.

Batman, thorough, far thinking cuss that he is, had some time ago created contingency plans for taking out the Justice League should the members turn bad (or get brainwashed or possessed by demons and so on...). Except he didn't tell his teammates, so it's a hell of a thing for them to find out this way, with Vandal Savage having stolen Batman's files and implemented them. A shocked Superman confronts Batman: ""None of us would ever do that to you."" To which Bats cooly retorts: ""Then you're damn fools.""

It's an awesome reunion of voice talents as the cast of the JL/JLU cartoon series reunites. Kevin Conroy (Batman, of course), Tim Daly (Superman), Susan Eisenberg (Wonder Woman), Carl Lumbly (J'onn J'onnz), and Michael Rosenbaum (Flash, but this time Barry Allen instead of Wally West). Nathan Fillion and Bumper Robinson join in as, respectively, Green Lantern and Cyborg. I thought Cyborg was handled well in this story, even if there's still that nagging sense that DC is furiously trying to elevate him to Luke Cage status. Oh, well. I guess I'll always associate Victor Stone with the Teen Titans.

JUSTICE LEAGUE: DOOM, paced at a brisk 77 minutes, wanders into some fairly grim territory. Whereas Batman's methods would have merely incapacitated the other heroes, Savage intends a more permanent solution. As such, he takes Batman's cautionary measures and extends them to their logical murderous functions. The Martian Manhunter probably gets the worst of it, but the others also fall under some pretty sadistic duress.

Ultimately, what I really cared about are those moments which deal with the Justice League's reacting to Batman's perceived betrayal. I wish we'd gotten more of the Darknight Detective and the others hashing out their warring philosophies and polarizing world views. Batman has never seemed more isolated, has never seemed less of a team player. The Batman as a lone wolf vigilante has always resonated more with me. 3.5 out of 5 stars for this one.

Also, I miss Wally West and Michael Rosenbaum's take on Wally West.

4884995,4,B005SH63HO,"I'm reviewing this after my second viewing, which I enjoyed far more than the first watch.

The previews for Doom had me eagerly anticipating the challenge of the JL facing an attack that, even if unintentional, came from within.  I had high hopes for some intense dialogue, powerful character development, and challenges that would impress on us the weight of the battles each member faced.

Instead, it was pretty much a collection of action scenes that, while fun to watch, didn't leave more of an impression on me than some of the average battles from the TV series.

In part, I think this is because I'm not familiar with all of the members' pasts.  If you don't know the story behind *why* these villains are major adversaries to the league members, it takes away part of the ""wow"" factor of them facing off.  It's like... seeing the final confrontation of Skywalker versus Vader, or Holmes against Moriarty,  without knowing any of the back story that's lead up to these ultimate battles.

Because of that, I think this would have made a much better mini-series or full season.  A lengthier presentation would have helped to fill in some information gaps, develop the characters' connections to the villains, build and sustain the suspense of the attacks, and offer the time to show the real damage and questions it caused among the league itself.

Unfortunately, that probably wasn't an option to the DC team creating this film, so what we have is a whole lot of story crammed into a tight 70-something minutes.

So, by knowing what I was getting into with the second viewing and not having my original expectations, it made for a more enjoyable watch.  Grab some popcorn, relish in the awesome and beloved cast of voice actors, and give yourself some eye candy with the fast action.  It's worth checking out if you're a fan, so long as you have an idea of what's to come.",1333238400,,1880,4.712538226299694

4884997,3,B005SH63HO,"I bought this from Wal-Mart, good price.  Watched as soon as I was home.  Well...this film was great!!  I was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of the voices from the Justice League tv series reprising their roles.  Also Nathan Fillion voicing Green Lantern Hal Jordan, no brainer there.  He should have been in the live action movie, not Ryan Reynalds, maybe then the film would not have sucked so bad...Anyway if your like me and collect all the DC animated features, this will be a fine addition to your inventory.

Story wise this is pretty good, with Vandal Savage as the central villan.  As usual he wants to be God of the Earth, or something like that.

I like that Cyborg finally got an entry into one of these films as well.

Now for the gripes, (Minor fanboy ones).  **Minor spoilers ahead.**

Don't have Superman talking in space.  This is impossible by the laws of science.  Have him talk telepathically, or whatever, but don't have him and Green Lantern talking with each other in outer space.

Why did Wonder Woman not go to jail after beating up and possibly killing all those innocent civilians?

How did Martian Manhunter burn so long?  What's he going to do now that his John Jones secret identity is blown?

If Vandal Savage and Bain know Batman is Bruce Wayne, why don't they ruin him and tell the world?

Quit changing which Flash is in the movies, pick one: Wally West or Barry Allen, quit going back and forth.

I would say if Vandal got all of Batman's files, then all superhero secret identities are blown, wouldn't they be?

Lots of loose ends at end of film.  Biggest gripes with film.

Still overall good film, just don't think so much like me when watching it.

4885001,4,B005SH63HO,"Vandal Savage is a great villian and this movie does him a decent justice in showing how extreme he is compared to the majority of villians. As well, this movie is a great example of how flawed the JLA really is and that none of them are invincible by any means. Their flaws were legitimately exposed without it being too far fetched, for the most part. As well, it shows the flaws of the villian's in which they always would rather have their counterparts suffer before death, as well, they are proven to be far less extreme compared to those like Vandal Savage. The art is what I expected from a DC movie, not incredible, but still good nonetheless. This story is one of the best and personal favorites and was shown pretty well throughout this movie. Batman once again reigns supreme as it should be. Although he is only human, Batman has one strength the rest don't have in that he literally is a one man fail-safe, as the basis of the storyline, that never lets emotion or trust take place of reason. Ultimately, emotion is a key weakness in all of the heroes and lack there of is one of Batman's greatest strengths. The only gripe is the fight sequence towards the end, as another reviewer pointed out, showcases the JLA all fighting their counterparts once again. Still enjoyable don't get me wrong, but instead, it should've been mixed and matched to show how well the JLA works together and needs one another. All in all, still a good movie and thoroughly enjoyable. As a true Bat Fan, I was impressed with the true showcase to all that makes the Bat so great and the JLA incomplete without him. I highly recommend this DC movie and is at the top of my list.",1332720000,8,1667,4.468852459016394

I'd say this movie is even better if you are more of a fan of Batman than the others since he's kind of a central character to the film and Conroy delivers some great work here (as always).
I give it four stars because in my opinion there are some week points. Without giving away spoilers, let's just say that if you watched the JL animated series then you will notice that they are retreading old territory. Also Cyborg is pretty lame. His voice and dialog are not bad but compared to the rest of the characters, it just comes off as unremarkable.

Wouldn't it have been easier to just inform the rest of the League instead of creating dosiers on how to defeat them behind their backs?  These were the questions that were racing thru my mind while I was watching this, and the truth is (if you can find a truth in an animated feature) that there was no clear cut truth to it.  Sure Batman could have gone the more honest route and informed them, but if one of them do go rogue....well, like I said, it's not an easy call to make.  That's why I loved this movie!

Batman (Kevin Conroy) has believed that the members of the Justice League are among the most powerful and potentially dangerous people in the planet and has developed contingency plans with all their weaknesses to neutralized them should anyone of his super powered colleagues ever goes rogue. When the immortal Vandal Savage (Phil Morris) gains control of Batman's top secret files, he employs a team of super villains to destroy the Justice League one by one. Based on the graphic novel JLA: Tower of Babel by Mark Waid, Justice League: Doom feels like a very amusing and action-packed episode of Justice League. Though the story lacks much emotional depth and character development due to its brief 77-minute runtime, the animated adventures does boast with some blazing action, great dialogue and fluid animation. The voice cast also includes Tim Daly, Nathan Fillion, Susan Eisenberg, Carl Lumbly, Michael Rosenbaum, Carlos Alazraqui, Claudia Black and Alexis Denisof.

Justice League: Doom is one of the finest Blu-Ray releases from the DCAU movie collection. The animated adventure is presented in 1.78:1 widescreen format. The picture quality is quite good with a few flaws. The Blu-Ray does boast with a solid DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack. Its special features include an audio commentary track, three featurettes (A League of One: The Dwayne McDuffie Story, Cyborg: His Time Has Come & Guarding the Balance: Batman and the JLA), two Justice League episodes (Wild Cards Part 1 & 2), the DC Digital Comic Book JLA #43 and a 7-minute sneak peek of the upcoming animated movie Superman vs. the Elite.

4885010,4,B005SH63HO,"As a proper child of the `70s and `80s, I watched the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Friends/dp/B00023E88U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Friends</a>&nbsp;constantly. In fact, I knew superheroes from the Super Friends long before I ever picked up my first comic book. That show introduced me to the brightly colored world of comics. Although I didn't know it at the time, the Superfriends I watched wasn't a single show, but a couple of different series randomly slotting in together. All I knew was that when the skull-faced dome rose up from the swamp, I was in for a good episode. I would get to see the Legion of Doom.

Even now, the Legion of Doom gets me giddy. Nostalgia has a powerful effect. So when it was announced that the next DCU animation was ""Justice League: Doom,"" well, I was six years old again, and that skull-faced dome was rising out of the swamp.

""Justice League: Doom"" was better than I had hoped. Merging the classic imagery of Legion of Doom with Mark Waid's brilliant&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tower-of-Babel/dp/156389727X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tower of Babel</a>&nbsp;story and slicing in a touch of the new 52 JLA re-launch was brilliant. They kept all of the necessary nostalgic elements--the headquarters in the swamp, the name Legion of Doom, a balance of one villain per hero--but then they made the evil team a credible threat via the Tower of Babel story and the theft of Batman's anti-hero files. Oh, and that touch of the 52 JLA re-launch? That would be the novice hero Cyborg making his debut on the team.

The animation and character design for ""Justice League: Doom"" was spot-on. I haven't seen this design for Mirror Master before, so I don't know if that is his current costume, but I thought he looked great. I even thought they did a good job with Bane, who is a character I normally can't stand. He has been used well in Young Justice also, proving once again that it is the writer not the character that matters most. Vandal Savage makes a credible replacement for Ra's al Ghul, and even though the superhero take-downs are less cerebral than Tower of Babel, the more action-orientated style is animation-friendly and works well.

The only attack I didn't like was Wonder Woman. Suddenly surrounded by an entire city full of the Cheetah, Wonder Woman didn't even try to reason things out but just went straight to the fighting taking down innocent people in the process. I thought that did Wonder Woman a disservice; she should be able to use her brain as well as her brawn.

All the right people are doing the voice acting; by which I mean that Kevin Conroy is Batman and Tim Daly is Superman. With those two anchoring the show, the rest of the cast can be mixed up in almost any direction. DC seems to be trying to maintain some continuity in voices; Nathan Fillion is back as Hal Jordan, Susan Eisenberg as Wonder Woman, Carly Lumbly as Martian Manhunter, and Michael Rosenbaum as The Flash (Barry Allen instead of Wally West, which is a bit odd as Rosenbaum does both of their voices as essentially the same character).  I didn't recognize any of the other voices, but everyone suited their character.

Continuity is going to be a problem for DC with these animated releases. With new generations raised on continuing-storyline animation in the Japanese style, like ""Dragonball Z,"" rather than the random-episode style like the original Superfriends, I have seen a few younger viewers confused as to how this fits in with other DCU animations. Is this the same JLA from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Young-Justice/dp/B006PA0WF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Young Justice</a>? Where is Red Tornado? Why does Superman look different? All these things adults take in stride--we know the shows are only vaguely connected. But the run the risk of alienating younger viewers who are used to a certain style of storytelling. And without raising a new crop of kids on superhero animated adventures like I was, DC is going to find its future in trouble.

The Special Features on the Blu Ray were outstanding. The best one, of course, was the moving tribute to Dwayne McDuffie called ""Legion of One: The Dwayne McDuffie Story."" Watching this, I realized how little I knew about McDuffie. Like the fact that he was a minor celebrity as a young boy, going to college at age 10.  Or how he wanted to be an astronaut and only gave up when he grew past the maximum height requirement.  Or his commitment to bring actual ethnic diversity to comic books.  The submitted fan tributes via webcam to Dwayne McDuffie were truly moving.  Expect to drop a tear or two.

The other two features are ""Guarding the Balance: Batman and the JLA""--a look at American history, politics, and paranoia--and ""Their Time Has Come: Cyborg and the DC Universe's New Diversity,"" which was less personal than the Dwayne McDuffie feature but still interesting.

One bonus feature that I wish DC would included on these animated releases are Who's Who -style character profiles.  They would be easy enough to include--just stagnant clickable screens--but I think they would add significant depth.  With these animated releases DC reaches a much larger audience who aren't familiar with their stable of characters. A history and profile of lesser known characters like Vandal Savage, Cyborg, and Star Sapphire would help orientate new viewers.",1332028800,,5501,5.15712682379349

The story that was told in the Grant Morrison run of JLA was big and important because of how it changed everyone's view on Batman. There were issues to deal with after the big reveal. As a stand alone movie, they can't possibly show that. Everything has to wrap up because: A) There is no sense of continuity and B) It's all just excuses to have fights.

Spoiler Alert!!! (in case you can't guess how it will all end)

In the Justice League series, it's shown that bad guys could beat the JL when they worked as a team. The Justice League, as a team, had to work together to cover each other's weaknesses and help each other. This isn't true for the movie. In the movie they just beat up the same villains that they had beaten before. It's even stressed that with out the help of Batman's plan and Vandal Savage's guidance, then they wouldn't have stood a chance against the super heroes. Nothing is learned, and the use of a team is just an excuse to have a bunch of fights in close proximity.

The hall of doom has been used in the series where all the voices are from. Fans of the earlier series have nothing to gain by watching Justice League Doom. Just avoid it.",1331856000,2,1327,4.253968253968254
4885014,3,B005SH63HO,"Bruce Timm and company have released some of the best Dc animated films over the years including Batman year one but as for Justice League doom, I'd say I've seen better Dccomics Roster has a greatline of super hero's and a handful of talented writers and artists and some of the best of storylines. And Bruce Timm as the producer from I ve seen Ive learned to expect better however thats not the case with JLD.

A Lex Luthor Ripoff

First of all the chracter of Vandal Savage I felt was a cheap Lex Luthor ripoff, his idea of taking over the world was cleage ,his backstory of the shooting star and becoming a super genius, was just boring I just didn't care for the chracter at all. however I did buy into  Batman's reasons to create these top secret plans to fight the JL should they go rougue one day ,speaking of which I'd really like to watch a full Length Batman vs Superman film. Performance wise when you have Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly you have a winner, the voice talent of these wonderful actors in JLD is spot on where casting is concern Andrea Romano could do no wrong.

Action Scenes
The action scenes were decent to keep me watching especially the opening sequence where the royal flush gang was introduced, although  it was a tad missleading in its presentation where the guard was struck down by a playing card for which I immediately thought the villan was the joker, sadly I was wrong and therefore very dissapointed .

We all know that batman eventaully comes back from the dead litterally but the scene where Bruce Wayne meets Bane at the cementary is terrble I would've expected  for Bruce to put up more of a fight against Bane who just knocks him out with one kick.  Fights that take place in the cementary are usually great to watch because there are oppertunities for some real intense heart pounding  fight action for example Bruce Lee Dragon Story. The scene where johnn the martian manhunter was suduced by the woman in the bar was pretty cool. I had no idea she was a fake I totally bought into it when she lit johnn on fire,I thought he either be critically injured or dead that scene was intense.

The Music
Since the release of  Batman gotham Knight which also starred Kevin Conroy composer Christopher Drake has  been very sucessful within these fine Dc Animated films, might I add even more popular then composers Robert J. Krall and Kevin Manthie, scoring many popular films such as Wonder Woman, Public Enemies, Batman Under The Red Hood, Including Batman Year One. What could I say about the music for JLD If I had one word to describe the score it would be awesome which was the main reason why I sat through the movie.  I really don't know why Christopher Drake's music is not being released because he's  done a superb job scoring this film and for that matter I think the music deserves more reconition.

Conclusion

Overall  I think this movie is the weakest of all its predecessors as I said before the action scenes were decent but in my opinion could've been alot better the plot was and chracter of Vandal Savage was terrible. Simply put some comics are not meant to be made into movies and Justice League Doom is a example it might've been great as a comic book but as a film I'll give three stars because although it has it's flaws it is a  fine tribute to the memory of Dwayne Mcduffie it is a decent film just not a great film.",1331683200,,3378,4.465040650406504

4885024,4,B005SH63HO,"I won't go into detailing the plot, since other people have done that. I just wanted to add a few comments. This isn't the Justice League you may be familiar with from the previous DC Justice League animated series, even though most of the voice acting cast is the same. Neither is it the same Justice League featured in the previous JL animated film, Crisis on Two Earths. For anyone wondering, the Flash here is Barry Allen, not Wally West, and Green Lantern is Hal Jordan, not John Stewart (or Kyle Rayner or Guy Gardner). The Batman here might well be the same one from the previous DC animated feature, BATMAN: YEAR ONE. For those that have watched the YOUNG JUSTICE animated series, this appears to be the Justice League (at least some of them -- you won't see Red Tornado, Green Arrow, Black Canary, or Aquaman from that series) of that continuity, along with the Vandal Savage already introduced in that series. It adds a couple of elements inspired to some degree from the old Super Friends cartoons -- The Legion of Doom (although the only character here who appeared on Super Friends is the Cheetah) and Cyborg (who was a member of the Justice League in the ""Galactic Guardians"" final season of Super Friends). The character designs and animation style appear to be exactly the same as those used in YOUNG JUSTICE. The plot is very loosely based on the comic book story ""Tower of Babel""... really only taking the central idea that Batman has secretly developed contingency plans for taking down each and every Justice Leaguer in the event that it becomes necessary, and that these plans are stolen from the Batcomputer. Otherwise it's a completely original story. There's plenty of action throughout, and each individual member of the JLA gets a few scenes to showcase their unique powers and abilities.

I subtract one star from an otherwise perfect score only because of the lack of inclusion of a DC animated short film as an extra -- which we've come to expect in the last half-dozen DC direct-to-video releases. And given that the feature film is only about 70 minutes, having a short extra would have added value to this release. The (very) short preview of the next upcoming feature, SUPERMAN VS. THE ELITE (seems like a strange choice) was interesting, but mostly talks about the comic book story that inspired the feature and gives only the briefest glimpses of animation from that film. I didn't get the Blu Ray or 2-disc version so I can't comment on the extras included on those versions.  All in all still a solid buy, though.",1331164800,2,2550,4.72808988764045

Tower of Babel involves a villain team using Batman's protocols for defeating the JLA against the team. It's a BRILLIANT idea. It setup years worth of stories, eventually culminating in Infinite Crisis. The whole point of the story was to create tension in the team. Batman was right to create back-up plans to defeat his fellow leaguers... But they should've talked about it. The result was a long standing air of distrust amongst a team of the World's most powerful superbeings.

This movie, ""Doom"", took the central aspect of the storyline it was based on... and resolved the problem in 5 minutes. The rest of the movie was a by-the-numbers hero team vs. villain team. It SUCKED. I expect much, much more from this studio.",1331164800,12,804,4.826086956521739

4885029,4,B005SH63HO,"Justice League Doom is the last story adapted by the late, great Dwayne McDuffie who had previously worked with DC in Justice League and Justice League Unlimited. It also features the return of the majority of the JLU voice cast (except Phil Lamarr, Green Lantern - John Stewart). It's a loose adaptation ""JLA: Tower of Babel,"" where the JLA are systematically defeated by their enemies. While it's certainly not a bad story, it's predictable pacing and close association with the Justice League cartoon makes it feel like just another episode of Justice League.

On the positive side, not even mentioning the splendid animation, the original ""Tower of Babel"" was cleaver but very methodical, so they changed it up to be more action oriented. For instance, in the original, the plan was to render all language (written and vocal) into randomness and cause confusion. In this version, it's world domination. (Of course!) And they mixed in allusions to another similar Justice League story ""Justice."" But, the disappointing part is the predictable set up:

First, Action Piece.
Then, they get taken down.
Then, they pull themselves out of it.
Then, the final action piece.

It's a tired formula and I've seen it a million times. But, as they say in the commentary, every time it's somebody's first time. So, if you weren't old enough to watch Justice League in it's original run, this is a pretty good showcase for them and the ""Legion of Doom"" concept.

Extras on the Bluray include:

Commentary with Geoff Johns (current writer for JLA) and Mike Carlin (former DC editor). It's strange they chose them, instead of Bruce Timm and Andrea Romano or the voice cast.

Guarding the Balance: Batman and the JLA - A 18 minute featurette about Batman's relationship with the JLA.

Cyborg: His Time Has Come - A 6 minute featurette about Cyborg (Victor Stone) and his role in the comics. People have been asking for him to join the JLA since the end of Super Friends.

Digital Comic Book - JLA: Tower of Babel - The firs issue of the Tower of Babel storyline from the comics. They really should change this into a code from a free download of the comic from DC's online store.

A League of One: The Dwayne McDuffie Story - Thirty minute documentary about Dwayne McDuffie and his legacy across comics and TV.

First Look at ""Superman vs. The Elite"" - The first glimpse at the adaptation of ""What's so funny about Truth, Justice, and the American way?"" The first impressions of the animation remind me of ""The Batman,"" and that's not the best first impression to give.

Bruce Timm's picks: Wild Cards parts 1 & 2 - The episodes of the Joker and the Royal Flush Gang.

I suspect they didn't include episodes like ""Secret Society"" and ""Injustice For All"" because it would highlight how often they rely on the ""Legion of Doom"" concept. I don't mean this as a knock against Mr. McDuffie's legacy, but I will not give this a perfect score based solely on the fact it's the last thing he penned. It's just an all too familiar plot with the added novelty of bringing back the iconic voices from the much acclaimed JLU series. And I can't help feeling that a straight up adaptation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice/dp/1401231853/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice</a>&nbsp;might have been a better choice.

The whole pg-13 thing just makes these projects too heavy and somewhat depressing and needlessly violent to justify the rating.

Most are familiar with the story line, taken from JLA: Tower of Babel. Though I was comfortable with the changes made, (Vandal Savage, Cyborg) the execution is less than desirable. Furthermore, it is just down right silly, even for a comic book. Anyone remember back in the 70's in Marvel Team Up, with Spider-Man and Hercules, the Island of Manhattan get separated from NY, and Hercules wraps a chain around it, and pulls it back. LOL. It was later revealed that was an imaginary story. Well, this one does get that silly.

Supes flies to the Sun, then a Fortress is pulled out of the ground in the Swamps, it then gets connected to the JLA satellite to block a solar flare, all within a 7 minute countdown. sigh.

4885033,5,B005SH63HO,"Doom is essentially a movie adaptation of the trade paperback JLA: Tower of Babel.  The details are of course different (the JLA lineup, the evil mastermind's identity, and the plans themselves) but the basic premise is the same: Batman, always trying to prepare for any eventuality, has made contingency plans to disable the Justice League should any of them ever pose a public threat.  When those plans are stolen the League faces an attack designed by both the greatest strategic mind on the planet as well as someone who knows all their secrets.

The comic has some more depth to the conflict and emotions that Batman's actions cause for the rest of the team, but I was surprised at how well the overall concept translated.  The individual villains and plans used against each leaguer were very interesting and made to present real danger (if you suspend preconceived notions about what can and can't happen in the movie, of course).

I have stuck to the DC movies and Batman:TAS, and have never seen the Justice League shows nor Superman's.  As such I can not comment on the portrayal of characters comparatively with previous showings.  Judging it by itself the characterizations are good, the story well told and the action suitably over the top for such a release.

A side note: the establishing fight at the beginning against the Royal Flush Gang was a lot of fun.  It's a small thing, but a well done scene like this to set the stage and introduce new viewers to the League's powers is a nice touch.

It also showcases each of the heroes in different ways. The artwork is great and the voice cast is the absolute best of the bunch. Tim Daly as Superman, Kevin Conroy as Batman, Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern, Susan Eisenberg as Wonder Woman, Carl Lumbly as Martian Manhunter and Michael Rosenbaum as the Flash (Now playing Barry Allen and NOT Wally West who he always played before).

JL Doom is OK, I don't think it's nearly as good as Justice League Crisis on Two Earths. The story here is has potential but I think the execution could have been better. Two key characterization flaws here. I don't like how Wonder Woman is de-powered so much here. In Crisis on Two Earths she fought toe-to-toe and eventually got the better of the evil superwoman who was knocking Superman around. Here Diana can barely hold her own strength-wise against Cheetah and it appears they took her ability to fly away. I'd say they made her barely as strong as Spiderman compartively speaking here. The other big characterization flaw is how the Flash is portrayed. In this movie he is Barry Allen, police scientist (well CSI officer here). But the Flash is portrayed as wisecracking, and somewhat immature ...a hallmark of Wally West's personality which was well established and consistent in the JL/JLU TV series. That is not Barry Allen's personality. I agree with others in that I'm glad they used a main villan other than Luthor/Joker. Vandal Savage was a good choice. The fight sequences here aren't as good as Crisis on Two Earths. The way Hal Jordan was defeated was interesting. Despite its flaws if you are a JL fan you should watch this and despite my lukewarm reception to this movie I hope they keep making these movies because these films are a great escape.",1330905600,30,1526,4.655555555555556

The backgrounds are great and drawn wonderfully. However, the actual people animation is horrible. The people are drawn with minimal attention to detail, and it sucks.

4885039,2,B005SH63HO,"Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of the Justice League, as well as a fan of the majority of the DC Animated movies.  That being said, Justice League ""Doom"" is a largely forgettable and mildly entertaining feature.

When I first heard there was going to be a Justice League animated feature with the Legion of Doom I was pumped.  When you mention Legion of Doom to fans of the old Super Friends and Justice League Unlimited series you think about of the most entertaining villains in the DC Universe.  You think of Luthor...Sinestro...Gorilla Grodd...Bizarro...Braniac...Solomon Grundy.  I was bored out of my mind watching this new Legion of Doom led by Vandal Savage.  I new when I purchased this DVD that I was not going to see my beloved Legion of Doom, but I had hoped that this new Legion would be somewhat interesting...unfortunately that was not the case.  It's very difficult to make a successful superhero animated feature, cartoon, movie...whatever...if the villains are about as interesting as watching paint dry.

Additionally, I was not a fan of the animation.  I know the ""anime"" look is all the rage...and in many instances I can overcome the anime look...but in this case I really disliked how my favorite heroes were animated.

This animated feature is a rental at best, and the special peek at the next DC Animated feature (Superman vs The Elite) has the look of being another average animated release.  Note to DC...not every animated short you release has to star Superman or Batman.  Yes they are your most popular characters, but you have some other great characters and stories from groups like The New Teen Titans or Legion of Superheroes.

The opening fight scene with the Royal Flush Gang is exciting and a great way to start the movie. Then we hit our first plot hole with Mirror Master being a hologram so Batman's motion detectors can't detect him, and yet he's able to hold a physical device that can hack his mainframe without the computer detecting anything.

The next fight scene could have been better if they had edited it differently. Basically the League of Doom splits up and takes on the Justice League one-on-one. The idea is good, but the breaks in the fight are awkward, and somehow each fight takes a different amount of time even though they are going on simultaneously.

The final battle is pretty good and fun to watch, but again there are some major plot holes. Somehow a rocket is able to travel from the Earth to the Sun in a few minutes, Superman is able to travel from the Sun to the Earth instantly, and yet solar flares need 8 and a half minutes to reach the Earth? And Superman is able to lift the Hall of Doom from the ground into space in less than a minute and no one experiences more than 1G?

If all you are looking for is 74 minutes of slug fest, then you will really enjoy the movie. But if you want a plot that makes sense and a story with something other than fighting, you'll probably be as disappointed as I was.",1330646400,5,1548,4.364583333333333

If you are like me and a fan of the old ""Legion Of Doom"" episodes from the 1970's and 1980's, or even the recent incarnation from JUSTICE LEAGUE, then ""DOOM"" remains faithful to the original:  a group of super criminals collaborate together to take down the Justice League and wreak havoc on Earth.  That said, you have Vandal Savage and not Lex Luthor leading the group, and the super villains here are mostly 2nd or 3rd level super criminals (I did not know who ""Vandar Aag"" was since he never appeared in earlier cartoon series).  Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly, Susan Eisenberg, and Michael Rosenbaum all reprise their characters from the JUSTICE LEAGUE series (not sure why Flash is Barry Allen and not Wally West, though I was glad they kept Rosenbaum for a slightly different DC timeline).  Bumper Robinson does a good job voicing Cyborg; I wouldn't mind seeing more of him in future movies.  The only storyline that was a bit confusing was the relationship between Carol Ferris/Star Sapphire and Green Lantern; this was never covered in the recent JUSTICE LEAGUE series so unless you read GL comic books you might be a bit confused over those scenes, small as they are.

That said, there are a few annoyances with the way the disk is outlined.  First, I am getting tired of having useless promos and advertisements load before I can get to the Main Menu.  Second, don't give me promos about other TV or cartoon series coming out on DVD or Blu-Ray  -- if they want to entice people to buy them, put a free episode on the disk, maybe even Part 1 of a 2-part episode.  Most people buying the disks are already fans of the other cartoon series so we have either seen the shows or purchased the DVD's/Blu-Ray's.  Third, while there is a 2-part JUSTICE LEAGUE episode (""Wild Cards"") included, there is plenty of space on the 2-disks to include more episodes from that series or from some of the newer series.

A few minor quibbles:  If you are going to create a movie called ""DOOM"",  I bet some of the older buyers wouldn't mind seeing the old cartoons from the 1970's or 1980's included, which featured The Legion Of Doom.  If there are future movies playing on older cartoon themes, then include those cartoons for nostalgic fans.  The artwork is out of the current YOUNG JUSTIC format; I still prefer the art style from the recent JUSTICE LEAGUE series on Cartoon Network.  Phil Morris (aka ""Jackie Chiles"" from SEINFELD) does good work voicing Vandal Savage but considering he actually played the Martian Manhunter on SMALLVILLE I would not have minded him voicing the same character here.  Claudia Black (""Vala"" from STARGATE: ATLANTIS) does good work here as Cheetah.

Pros:  Action-packed movie with good story, decent bonus features, DVD disc basically `free' with the Blu-Ray purchase, digital comic included, nice Dwayne McDuffie tribute, upconverted JUSTICE LEAGUE cartoon episodes.

Cons:  Could have more cartoon freebies, annoying disk interface leading to previews and purchases, ultra-violet feature of little use to anybody but tech geeks, very drab Main Menu interface

Overall, a quality addition to the DC Comics/JUSTICE LEAGUE universe, and the improvements outweight my personal dislikes which will not be shared by all JUSTICE LEAGUE and DC Comics fans.  You definitely get your money's worth with this purchase, and the decade of continuity from Bruce Timm and Andrea Romano and the other folks behind the scenes is most appreciated.  And yes....LOVE those upconverted JUSTICE LEAGUE cartoons - keep `em coming !",1330473600,8,4209,4.9137199434229135
4885055,5,B005SH63HO,"In a series of videos based on important comic story lines, this one stands out. What I like about this is each character was depicted accurately showcasing his or her strengths and weaknesses. The story was a solid one back when it was first printed, and the writers did a good job transferring it to the screen.  The director did a good job taking the audience through the action scenes and plot points, and it was nice to have the voice talents back from the 90's animated series.

I also really enjoyed the character design. The stylization was just enough the make the drawings more handsome.

This movie and JLA: The New Frontier are my 2 favorite DC releases over the last 12 years.",1330473600,23,689,4.540322580645161
4885056,5,B005SH63HO,"I will give my review without trying to ruin the movie for fans of this genre, this review may contain spoilers, but I will do my best to not go in depth.  This movie is a loose adaption of comic book writer Mark Waid's accliamed 2000 miniseries Tower of Babel, with a little bit of the more recent New 52 from DC comics.  This film was directed by longtime DC Universe veteran Lauren Montgomery who was also responsible for bringing us Wonder Woman and Green Lantern:  First Flight, which just happens to be one of my all time favorite animated movies.

This movie like all the previous animated movies are a animated feature which are always nice and has the feel to it of the Justice League animated series series.  This film also introduces Cyborg which is a character some people might not be familiar with, even though he was a hugely popular character in the animated cartoon series of Teen Titans and has had some good success in comics recently, and is a nice change of pace to the story.  This film does a good job of plot twists and those not familiar with the Babel story will be shocked at some of the things that happen.

The film is rated PG-13 like the other films that DC has released so parents with younger kids should be aware that it is given this rating not only for intense action and some blood, but several of the heroes weaknesses are used against them in a dark way, and some are tortured, so there is some emotional drama going on that you do not previously see in the other animated films.  You also have the usual Superman beating up on villains type of action. The basic premise of this movie is what would happen if villains new about each members of the Justice Leagues greates vulnerabilities and knew exactly how to exploit them all in a plot to get rid of them for a even more sinister plan.  Even worse, how did they find out about their weaknesses and come up with the plans necessary to make it happen?  You have to watch this movie to fid out.

Longtime fans will be excited to know that Justice League: Doom boasts a lot of voice veterans that they will be familar with.  Tim Daly (Superman), the great Kevin Conroy (Batman), Susan Eisenberg (Wonder Woman), Michael Rosenbaum (Flash), Carly Lumbly (Martion Manhunter), and the newest addition of Bumper Robinson (Cyborg).  For the hardocre fnas it has what they believe to be the best Green Lantern in Hal Jordan voiced by Nathan Fillion, and fans of the Justice League animated series and Justice League Unlimited will recognize some of the villains in Mirror Master and Vandal Savage.

My final review is I found the movie highly entertaining and hope that they continue to make movies like this.  I do wish that these movies were longer, maybe even feature film length in the 2 hr range, or at the very least the 90 min range escpecially with the PG-13 rating and darker content it is possibly geared more towards adults and pre-teens and they are trying to find the right mixture of violence/action for the adults that they can still watch with their children, with that said, another 20 minutes would have been perfect because they do such a great job of setting things up to it to only feel rushed in other parts.  I found the animation to be on par with the previous films, and in Blu Ray it looks even better.

I recommend this film!",1330300800,60,3332,4.499170812603649
4885057,3,B005SH63HO,"WARNING...Spoiler Alert!

I'll preface this by saying that I've always been a comic book fan and I also own all of the televised Justice League cartoons which I've really enjoyed.  Doom is a great film and is another great installation in the JL films along with similar releases with Superman and Batman.  However it kind of sucks.  I have read Tower of Babel from which this story is derived (a great story by the way, check it out if you haven't) and I'm OK with most all of the changes made to maintain whatever loyalties were struck with previous cast members, the otherwise most recent JL film Crisis on Two Earths as well as the tie in with the new DC 52 comic where Cyborg becomes a member of the Justice League.  Hey, we live in a commercial world after all and such are the wheelings and dealings behind the makings of such things.  But the one element that could've really made this story great was somewhat brushed over in this rendition.  The fact that Batman is perceived as having betrayed his team members and the psychological drama that would ensue over that in itself is enough of a story to carry this baby much further than it went.  Also, Bruce Wayne is buried in his parent's grave with the bones of his long dead father.  The fact that this has relatively no affect on his ability to act and get his team back into working order just doesn't make sense.  These factors could've made the film an amazing study on Batman and the other characters of the Justice League but their absence makes it another run of the mill WHAM BAM go superheroes flick.  Not that I'm opposed to that but I really had come to expect so much more of the team putting these films together.

That being said, it's enjoyable.  If you've been following, as I have, the previous Justice League animated material, the character design is great accompanied by great animation and of course the voice acting is superb.  Still, as much as I like the original cast of the JL I'm over it and don't mind new actors, including replacing Kevin Conroy.  He's superb as Batman but there are other renditions that are equally convincing which also allow for more depth of character.

I know, I'm bashing here.  I'm a huge fan and am going to re-watch it tonight but I think DC needs to reconsider it's approach on the next JL endeavor.  They can obviously still deliver amazing stories (as visible in Batman Year One; the Catwoman short is also a must see) but perhaps their familiarity with the Justice League universe needs to be mixed with some new blood on the creative side.

Just sayin'!",1330214400,12,2576,4.536796536796537
4885058,4,B005SH63HO,"DC has made so many great animated films they have forced us to review them harder. Batman year one, Allstar Superman, and New Frontier are just 3 of the grade A pix they have produced. I'd definitely purchase one of those before this one if you are starting fresh, but this is well worth the price. A lot of people worked very hard to make this a damn fine film. If you haven't checked out the others, I would start there, or even check out Justice League Crisis on two Earths. Also a top tier flick.",1330041600,7,501,4.229166666666667
4885059,5,B005SH63HO,"Is Waid's story better? Heck yes! Did this movie do a good job of giving the general gist of what ToB was supposed to be about with only 77 minutes? Again, yes. If you only have enough money to buy one or the other, buy ToB. However, if you can spare a few extra bucks, I recommend getting this movie as well.

Moving into the movie, I liked the new plans/altered plans that Batman came up with in this film just as much (if not more) than ToB and so have no problem with the changes. In fact, Bane beating Bruce's a** was one of the more wonderful parts of the movie.

Overall, the plot wasn't amazing (again, 77 minutes) but for what they had it told a decent story. (Remember, ToB didn't just span its 4 issues, but was also told with follow-up JL issues and it even had repercussions for the younger heroes like Robin in Young Justice.)

Also, for those fans in-the-know, there were several hints throughout the movie to previous things that had happened in the comics (Bane, anyone?) which I'm just nerdy enough to get a real kick out of.

The artwork was great and it looks as if they were drawn by the same person that does Young Justice. The music is again by Christopher Drake and the main theme is a sort of remix from the awesome Crisis on Two Earths song.

One thing I did find odd is that Flash is Barry Allen but voiced by Michael Rosenbaum (who voices Wally in the Justice League cartoons). Nothing wrong with that since I do like Michael's voice, but it threw me for a loop until they definitely confirmed that it was Barry and not Wally as the Flash.

In case anyone is wondering, the line-up is such: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash (Barry, obviously), Green Lantern (Hal), Cyborg (not a member of the JL, for you whiners!). For baddies you have Vandal Savage, Bane, Cheetah, Mirror Master, Star Sapphire, Metallo, & Ma'alefa'ak, as well as a minor appearance from the Royal Flush Gang. As much as I love Luthor and Joker, I'm glad they decided to go for some different villains for once.

As for the special features (on the Blu-Ray), the ones I've seen so far were just ok. The preview of Superman vs. the Elite was cool and I can't wait for it, but the Guarding the Balance: Batman and the JLA had more commentary about American history and politics than Batman. :( The episodes that Bruce Timm Presents are Wild Cards Part 1 & 2, which is cool but I already own the entire Justice League series. I haven't watched the other features yet.",1329955200,31,2465,4.416299559471366
4885060,2,B005SH63HO,"Just finished streaming Justice League: Doom. Trust me on this. Purchase the trade paperback JLA Book 7; read the comics. Rent it or stream it if you are so inclined but don't buy the DVD. The movie is loosely based on Mark Waid's well-received 'Tower of Babel' storyline. It's dramatic, gripping and thought provoking. I don't want to spoil the story because I can not compare the DVD to the comic book without revealing too many details from both. However there are quite a few changes & alterations from the original source material which appear to be done just to coincide with the reboot of DC's Justice League comic book series. For $10 dollars you can purchase the complete Tower of Babel story which this DVD is based on.

First off I enjoyed most of the movie, but there were some problems with the premise.  Vandal Savage purposed to destroy half the earth and all electronics would be useless.  Metallo should of had a problem with his plan because he would be destroyed.  Superman was shot with a kryptonite bullet, but once it was removed had no signs of kryptonite blood poisoning.  Also the flash had a bomb implanted through his wrist that would explode if he decelerated (why takeoff running at top speed?)or vibrated, but he vibrated his electrons to pass through an iceberg to freeze the bomb.

4885062,3,B005SH63HO,"Justice League: Doom is a direct-to-video animated original movie by DC in collaboration with Warner Bros. Animation.  They have been releasing these full-length films for the last several years and for the most part, they have been excellent.  They are usually adapted from a popular storyline from the DC comics and feature high quality animation and a large talent of popular actors doing the voice work. Doom is a loose adaptation of the Mark Waid ""Tower of Babel"" storyline from 2000 that appeared in JLA #43-46 and is available as a trade paperback as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JLA-Book-7-Tower-of-Babel/dp/156389727X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel</a>, combined with elements of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice/dp/1401231853/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice</a>&nbsp;by Alex Ross.  Doom keeps the basic storyline in tact, but is still a fairly radical departure from Waid's original story, and the two should be viewed independently of each other.

The basic premise of Doom is that Batman, in his ever-increasing paranoia, has created files on members of the Justice League, detailing their strengths and weaknesses should any of them happen to go rogue. The files are stolen by the villain Vandal Savage, who plans to use this knowledge to keep the members of the JLA occupied while he can implement his ultimate plan.

[The following paragraph may contain some spoilers but if so, they are very minor ones that shouldn't change the movie for you]

CONS
Compared to the previous DC animated films, Doom is largely a disappointment.  I realize this is a ""comic book movie,"" but you have to really suspend your disbelief to get through it.  I'm okay with a movie taking artistic license to make for a more interesting film, such as portraying sound and explosions in space, showing the sun as yellow even though it is white, and ridiculous tech that would make the writers on CSI blush (Batman's encrypted files apparently send a homing beacon to him whenever they are decrypted - what??).  But after awhile, these start to add up.  In one scene the writers correctly acknowledge that it takes light 8 minutes to travel from the sun to the Earth, yet right before that they show a rocket (which is traveling considerably slower than the 186,000 miles per second light travels) reach the sun in about 2 minutes (it should take at least 200 days).  Superman ponders ""moving the Earth"" to avoid an impending catastrophe that is in itself ridiculous.  The number of inconsistencies in the story and plot holes are pretty overwhelming.  Do you know that feeling of outrage you get when the villain has all but defeated the hero, yet he leaves him dangling over a slowly lowering shark pit and then leaves to do something more important instead of making sure he's dead?  Expect to see things that like that a lot.  At one point, the JLA conveniently face off against the exact same members of the Legion of Doom who previously tried to kill them.  Hey Superman, maybe you should pick anyone OTHER than the guy with kryptonite inside his chest?  The final d&eacute;nouement is anti-climatic and you never really get that real sense of danger.  Character development is mostly lost in favor of action, which is a shame when you're dealing with a character like Batman who is crazy and has so much potential (as seen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Year-One-Blu-ray/dp/B0058YPN4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: Year One [Blu-ray</a>]).  Batman has some great dialog at the very end and I thought they were going to redeem themselves by giving the story a darker edge, but then they side step that in favor of a happy ending. Even though this is a comic movie, a large portion of the audience is going to be adults, and Doom feels too much like it is designed for children who just want to see fights and things blow up.  There needs to be more here for the adult viewer.  DC has done this successfully in the past so I don't know why they couldn't do it here.

PROS
Like its predecessors in the DC animated universe, the voice acting in Doom is excellent. The familiar voice of Kevin Conroy (from Batman: The Animated Series) returns, as well as Tim Daly as Superman and a standout performance by Nathan Fillion as Hal Jordan/Green Lantern, last seen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Lantern-Emerald-Knights/dp/1563894750/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Lantern: Emerald Knights</a>.  Sometimes with this many big names in an animated work the actors tend to overshadow the film, and you can't get them out of your head, but here they all blend in seamlessly and there is no trouble focusing on the characters rather than the actors.  Animation is top notch.  Animated comic movies will often seem more like extended episodes of TV shows, but it's clear that Doom was designed as a feature and a lot of work went into its production.  The other strong point of this film is that you don't really need to be familiar with the DC universe at all to enjoy it.  It is pretty much self-contained and easy to follow.  I'm not a big DC guy and literally the only villain I had heard of was Bane, but this didn't give me any problems and there was no need to go into complicated back stories.

BLU-RAY BONUS MATERIAL
The Blu-Ray is a combo Blu-Ray DVD.  The Blu-Ray has several featurettes, and comes with a digital copy of the first issue (#43) of JLA from the original story arc. This is a bit of a tease and I really wish they would have included the entire 4-issue arc, but I guess they want you to buy the trade paperback as well.

  - Audio Commentary - Features Geoff Johns (writer and Chief Creative Officer for DC) and Mike Carlin (Creative Director of Animation for DC).  I have a lot of admiration for these guys but they are not cut out for commentaries. I feel like studios feel pressure to include a commentary on every film release, rather than just when it can add to the film.  In this case, there is little insight to be gained from the commentary.  I knew I was in trouble when Mike said the ""title sequence alone is awesome,"" even though it fairly boring.  I think they really would have benefited from paying Nathan Fillion to sit in and add some humor.  At one point, Mike says ""you can always learn something from these commentaries,"" yet instead of providing insight, he and Geoff spend most of the commentary with comments like ""this is a cool scene,"" and ""that was awesome,"" as well as explaining scenes like I'm five and just narrating what I'm watching: ""in this scene, everyone thinks Wonder Woman is the bad guy.""

  - Featurette: ""A League of One: The Dwayne McDuffie Story"" (also on the DVD)- a great tribute on the DC writer who adapted the story for this film and unfortunately died last year before its release.

  - Two random episodes of Justice League (""Wild Cards, Part 1 and 2"")

  - Seak peak at the next DC animated film - ""Superman vs. the Elite""

CONCLUSION
There was a lot of potential here, but ultimately, Justice League: Doom falls flat.  The high quality production values and outstanding voice talent can't save it from a weakly-developed storyline and poor direction. I don't really think McDuffie's script is to blame as much as whoever was in charge of executing it. If you're a DC/JLA fan and have seen all of the past animated films, it's not terrible and wouldn't hurt to check it out, but I would suggest renting it rather than buying.  The bonus features don't add to the release. If you're planning to make Doom your first foray into the DC animated world, I'd advise skipping it for now and starting with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Year-One-Blu-ray/dp/B0058YPN4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: Year One [Blu-ray</a>] or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Under-the-Red-Hood-Blu-ray/dp/B003ITZBVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: Under the Red Hood [Blu-ray</a>].",1329436800,7,8157,5.2225633154259405
