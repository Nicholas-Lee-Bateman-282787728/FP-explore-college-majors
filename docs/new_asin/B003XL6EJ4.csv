4217128,5,B003XL6EJ4,"FINALLY!

Have you been wondering how you can introduce superheroes when your kids are...well...nervous little weenies...but, if you watch Thomas the freakin' Tank Engine one more time you're going develop a permanent facial tic?

My nervous little kids LOVE this show. My kids are little, but I have 4 active children who would MUCH rather be playing outside instead of watching television. But, on a day where the kids can't go out and play...THIS lets me get my dishes done! Winner!

My oldest is 6 and is on the autism spectrum, but even my smaller ones love this show! My 5 yr old daughter now wants to be Iron Man when she grows up! LOL!

It has been a wonderful purchase! More silly...rather than violent. *thumbs up* I can let them watch it without worrying about them getting scared, or having nightmares.

I hope they continue on with this early childhood version of superheroes...I wanna see backpacks, and lunch boxes! I hate the scary looking backpacks when I've got a nervous 6 yr old...the only thing that is relatively benign for this age range is usually from the Cars movie.

FINALLY a superhero show that is geared toward younger kids.",1293408000,3,1154,4.745
4217129,4,B003XL6EJ4,"Disclaimer: I am reviewing this product based on the series not the DVD release. The DVD itself appears to have 6 episodes - those following the ones from Volume 1 - and a variety of special features.

Animated series these days often seem to be severely split between the ""Dora the Explorer"" age category and the ""geared for adults"" titles of, well, ""Adult Swim"" (e.g. - ""The Venture Brothers). Finding something for the youth in-between - those who are still kids, not quite teenagers - isn't always as easy. It gets even tougher with superhero-based animated series: comic fans have become an older demographic and animated series starring comic book heroes are geared towards them, not younger viewers (e.g. - ""Justice League"" or the recent ""Wolverine and the X-Men""). So it's nice when a series like ""Marvel Super Hero Squad"" comes along - juvenile enough that you feel your kids can watch it but not so young that they'll lose interest with ""That's for little kids"" comments.

MSSHS takes the premise that the Marvel comic characters have the heroes all living in one city - Superhero City (headed by Stan Lee, er, The Mayor) - and neighbour a villainous ""state"" headed by Doctor Doom. Many of the heroes work for SHIELD, the X-Men attend an actual school, and various other little ways of making it so the writers can basically go use any Marvel character they desire without having to deeply worry about ""team affiliations"" or such. The core heroes featured in the series are Iron Man, Wolverine, Thor, Reptyl, Falcon, Silver Surfer, and Hulk (sorry, no Spider-Man in season 1); there are frequent appearances by Ms. Marvel and Captain America in most episodes and the episodes of the season bring in many other characters ranging from the relatively obscure (Heroes for Hire) to iconic (Fantastic Four). So chances are if your child has a favourite hero - or you do - that he/she shows up at some point in the series, quite possibly more than once. Same goes for the villains - it's Doctor Doom and his henchmen MODOK (hilarious), Abomination and Mole Man but -plenty- of others show up in the series.

As noted, the tone of the series is young - maybe around Smurfs level (but with a few more flatulence and mucus jokes than that era; nothing -too- repulsive or overdone...about in-key with what you see in many G/PG movies these days). The heroes and villains may fight but no one is ever really hurt/injured and there are the obligatory ""good lessons of the day"" in each episode. It's done in a manner that's fun enough - plenty of quips and action - to keep the kids amused.

The thing is, while you're sitting there watching the show with the kids for the first time - let alone the potential umpteenth reviewing children are prone to do - you don't want to go stark raving crazy. Fortunately, if you enjoy the genre, there's plenty of things here for you too. The writers toss in both nods to comic history - the opening titles of each episode, for example - and little ""wink wink nod nods"" to the adult viewer (e.g. - Cap (dressed in a Confederate uniform, heading out for vacation at a Civil War re-enactment): ""Tell Brubaker to relax. I'll be on time.""..hangs up phone..""Sheesh. It's just the Civil War. What's the worst that could happen?"" ) If you get the joke, you may even be the sort of person who enjoys the series enough that you needn't view it with kids. There are plenty of amusing moments if you are okay with the ""toned down action"" and the unusual animation style. This may not be the deepest superhero series out there but it'll make you smile and, sometimes, that's what you need.

The show doesn't take itself seriously except with the intent to amuse its' target audience and it does that well enough. It's tougher and tougher to find a good link to superheroes for kids these days - too many other mediums have Wolverine eviscerating someone or Captain America being assassinated or the Joker killing/crippling someone (not saying those are part of bad stories but not for children) - so this is a nice change of pace. So check out Marvel's version of ""The Super Friends"" and laugh along with your kids.",1286409600,20,4139,4.672153635116598
4217136,5,B003XL6EJ4,Super Hero Squad Show is my Fav cartoon of all time. The humur is pointed toward older generation. Dont recommend younger kids but if you want a good laugh give it a try.,1392249600,,170,4.181818181818182
4217137,5,B003XL6EJ4,"Item was in good shape.  Delivery was fast, even for the post office. My son love getting it for Christmas.  We haven't watched all of it yet, but it looks to be in good condition, for being a used video.",1389052800,,204,4.075

4217141,5,B003XL6EJ4,"My kids are 3 years old.  They have seen Daddy play Bat Man games and heard teen helpers talk about Spider Man.  They both wanted to watch shows about superheroes, but I didn't feel comfortable showing them even the cartoons because of the violence.  When my son had his tonsils out we knew we would need to keep him quiet and his sister entertained while we nursed him back to health.  My husband searched for something that would keep their interest and found Super Hero Squad.  Much more about humor than violence, the series is just right for our young kids.  I didn't think they quite followed the plot until they started acting out scenes from the show.  And they know the catch phrases and names for most of the characters.  Even my daughter will ask to watch Super Hero Squad, so it's not just a ""boy"" show (and yes, she is a girly-girl).  As a matter of fact, we are now decorating my son's room in Super Hero Squad gear as we transition them to separate rooms.  He is very excited!",1345420800,,991,4.395604395604396

4217143,4,B003XL6EJ4,"I ordered this DVD for my 3 year old son who LOVES super heroes and he LOVES this DVD.  I like it because it's something that my son enjoys, but it isn't a full length movie.  Each episode is only a little over 20 minutes long, which is great for a three year old.  My only word of caution is that the first DVD we received was really difficult to get out of the packaging and after only having the DVD about a month, the disk broke when we were attempting to get it out of the DVD case.",1303171200,,487,3.898989898989899

8408280,3,B003XL6EJ4,"I'm still trying to get my head around the fact that Tom Kenny, the voice of Spongebob/Patchy the Pirate is the voice of Iron Man in this series? Well, like the first series, this is a mostly harmless super hero cartoon intended for younger viewers with surprisingly funny dialog worked in for adults to appreciate (e.g, the Dracula episode, in which Iron Man, pleading with the Wolfman for help with powering his armor, tells him to ""improvise!"", to which the Wolfman replies, ""Ok, give me an emotion!""  Yeah, completely over the head of the kids yet that had me cracking up.) There are quite a few goofy bits through the series that make this watchable for adults, yet at the same time harmless for all ages (the worst thing in the show is the occasional belch gag, or references to farting (with Thor responding ""Verily, I dealt it not!"")
Goofy stuff.",1426896000,,854,4.655629139072848
