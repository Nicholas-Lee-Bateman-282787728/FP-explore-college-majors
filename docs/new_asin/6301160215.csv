7809775,2,6301160215,"This video was not good! I only could get through the first 10 minutes, but it was horrible. It hurt my knees (and I don't have any knee problems at all). The music was horrendous and this exercise video looked like it was from 1979! Now, I actually REALLY like OLDER exercise videos (from 90's) but this one was terrible! Also it's 30 minutes long.",1367107200,,349,4.384615384615385
7809776,5,6301160215,"There are two versions of this video. The first one is from 1986 and features Deborah Crocker leading it. It contains basics yoga moves,stretching and breathing. The second video came out later which the picture is shown right here. This one is led by a different instructer and features different types of exercises. This video features mostly low impact aerobics. They are very easy to follow and very fun. I sure enjoy the because they are simple dance moves that anybody can follow. Great for beginners or anybody who wants a light workout on days they do not want to jump around. I enjoy both version of the videos. The other version of the video is great fro anybody who loves yoga and stretching.",1168214400,7,703,4.67741935483871
