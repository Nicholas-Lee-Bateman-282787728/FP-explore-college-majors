8508263,5,B0071BY1E2,"I wasn't sure I what I was going to think about this DVD.  I have watched other DVDs that combine an artistic documentary with concert footage and most have missed the mark, focusing more on the abstract and unusual.

This music DVD was insightful and filled with beautiful scenery and people.  The music was fantastic as you would expect from Calexico.

If you are looking for just a concert DVD, this is not it... but if you want a concert video that you can learn more about the Day of the Dead, the cultural significance, along with the social/economic issues facing southern Arizona and Northern Mexico, this is a great DVD to watch.",1393200000,,638,4.619469026548672
8508264,5,B0071BY1E2,"I first heard of Calexico on the 'Arizona Highway's' TV show. That same night I ordered two of their DVDs from Amazon. Both are excellent programs, but the 'Flor De Muertos' brings a whole new world with it. A powerful message and more understanding of the problems along our border. Not in a political sense, but in a very personal look into the lives of the people affected. The music is fantastic, both from 'Calexico', and the musicians at the 'Dia De Muertos' celebration in Mexico. I had never heard of the celebration in Tucson, but it's on my 'Bucket List' now.

I highly recommend this DVD, not only for it's entertainment value, but also, maybe, as a look into the real lives, problems, and celebrations of our neighbors. I guess nothing is really just, 'black-and-white'.

Great music, a little education, and besides, 'Crystal Frontier' makes me cry.",1357948800,3,862,4.8175675675675675
8508265,5,B0071BY1E2,"This is a truly compelling story of the Southern Arizona culture. More than just a concert video, although Calexico is amazing, live at Tucson's Rialto Theater with many special guests. The interviews with Salvador Duran, Charles Bowden and others shed a lot of light. I plan on joining the next Dia De Los Muertos procession.",1356393600,,326,4.945454545454545
