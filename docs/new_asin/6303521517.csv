We just recently found it again, and thinking it might be something our two-year  old might enjoy, played it for him.  It has been an almost  continuously-running feature since. ""Again! Again!"" cries  Caleb.

697927,5,6303521517,"I didn't particularly care for this series in the beginning, but my 3 yr old and husband watched multiple episodes while I was at work. I came home to my 3 yr old saying "" you forgot the cheese"" ( they actually say they forgot the crackers on that episode) while waving his arms and back and forth. It so hilarious that I had to find the episode to watch with him. The characters are clay animation and have British accents. I've watched all the episodes with the boys now and love them all as well. Really cute and I think they may have been based on books. 3 yr old loves it so much he has a bunny named Gromit and a chicken named Wallace. The adventures these two get into mske for a very interesting show.  I love it now because I never know when I'm going to hear,,, "" you forgot to light the shoes, mimi (fuse for the rocketship).

703748,5,6303521517,"I have always been a fan, an adult fan. It is my understanding the production facility in England that created the series, and other spinoffs burnt to the ground some time ago. The original masters and tapes were all lost. Very sad, as I understand the production costs were one million dollars per episode. I have always favored claymation, over animation. It's warmer, and it allows each individual their imagination to add to the experience. As a child I was fond of very old religious TV series called Davy and Goliath, I suspect that series was inspiration for Wallace and Gromit. I offer a bit of a ""spoiler"" here....Gromit only expresses himself with gestures, facial expressions, and other movements. He doesn't speak, but in every episode he critiques Wallace in every move. Live, laugh, and enjoy a warm loving show for all ages. I do think there are more episodes than this ""Complete Collection available somewhere?

Puns and inside jokes can be found in simple things like the advertising on billboards and the labeling  of things like the title of the book ""electronics for dogs"" that Gromit was reading and Wallis' electric hand drill branded ""BOTCH"" instead of ""BOSCH"".

706274,5,6303521517,I love this series. It's fun for both children and adults. Plus it's timeless. I started watching Wallace and Gromit back in the 90s when my daughter was young. Most episodes are around 30 minutes. There are loads of subtle humor - so watch the details carefully (like the titles of newspaper articles and quick witted lines).

707235,5,6303521517,"Wallace and Gromit: What can I say? There are no words to describe the fact that someone actually thought of creating such a thing in the first place...this, after all, ain't no Gumby. Nothing wrong with Gumby, but this is so much of an improvement in storyline, plot, and [dare we say it] acting. The characters are so real that you easily gain sympathy, or the opposite as required, with each one. These are a bit Brothers Grimm like at times, dealing with mass murderesses, dogs with a criminal twist of mind and other such dark subject material. So, if you are a bit of a sissy, be aware that these may make you shiver and sob. But for the rest of us...less sensitive yet tender minded...these can bring a tear of laughter to the eye and a stirring of near real emotion to the heart. God bless Wallace and Gromit...too few were ever made. I console myself with watching the spinoff show known as Shaun the Sheep; another fabulous collection of tales and characters which should go down in time, along with Wallace and Gromit, as the best of their kind ever produced to the date of this writing.",1427328000,4,1098,4.495

707594,5,6303521517,"I don't need to write a review to influence whether or not you're going to buy this. I'm writing this because I hope that someone who happens to stumble across Wallace and Gromit for the first time will wonder why their life wasn't fulfilled until they met these two characters. I absolutely love the wit and nuance captured in each clay-formed expression that Nick Park brings to life. There is nothing so creatively though out and painstaking to produce than these 4 episodes. I just wish there was an amount of money to pay Nick Park to do more of them (although I'm guessing that Nick is most likely more motivated by purpose, authenticity and principle rather than financial gain-another reason to love this guy). That is until you learn/watch the bonus features and discover how much work goes into making one of these episodes. If you're reading this Nick Park, please find somewhere in the middle to keep W & G alive and make a few more episodes. Or a full length movie would be awesome. You could literally charge $50 a ticket and host it only on limited basis. I'm not suggesting that you sell out and become the Simpsons. Just lay a few more lengths of track before the penguin gets caught :-)",1425859200,,1204,4.578703703703703

The films are clean, with no cursing or sexuality, and though resorting to some slapstick humor, no representation of a living being is ever injured.  Many folks will find the English humor to be a bit odd, to be sure, but my personal opinion is that the cultural quirks dovetail nicely with the absurdities of the stories. Like old Warner brother's cartoons, there's something there for all ages, as my 3 year old, who delights in the films, would attest to as well.",1424390400,,533,4.670212765957447

709223,5,6303521517,"Having done stop motion animation many years ago, I can tell you it is arduous and time consuming. But when you see the results in watching the completed effort, it is worth every sweaty, tedious, harrowing moment you put into it.

The creators of Wallace & Gromit keep the tradition alive. And there's a reason there are not a ton of them being dashed off and put on the market. You cannot do that with stop motion animation. So the gems we have may be few, but they are precious.

And the animation is stellar quality, with the attention to detail showing up in every frame, every shot, every nuance of motion.

So who are Wallace and Gromit? Well, they're just a man and his dog living their lives, somewhat precariously at the edge of society, yet content in their own little world and interacting with the rest of humanity, often with quite hilarious result. But, too, they are also very introspective in their machinations, and the outside world is often a distant thought.

The beauty of this duo is that they appeal to young and old because the humour is timeless, and the situations are profund, silly, wonderfully serendipitous and always entertaining... particularly the inventions.

So, if you are wondering, stop it! Simply dive in anywhere. This little collection will introduce you to the pair very nicely. Then you can take on the Wererabbit when you're ready.",1415404800,,1376,4.764705882352941

If you haven't seen these movies you are missing one of the great joys of life.  They are appropriate for all audiences, and they are delightfully funny.  Laugh out loud funny.  Wallace and Grommit get to know other  interesting characters, some lovable. some not so. Their adventures somehow tie into whatever invention of Wallace's is being featured - for us Rube Goldberg fans a great jumping off place.  Then there are those great movie devices - wild chases, near misses, last-minute saves.

I have yet to find a penguin disguised as a chicken costume to wear on Halloween.  Confused?  Check out ""The Wrong Trousers"".  Love sheep?  Meet Shaun, from ""A Close Shave"".  These are memorable, and lovable, characters.

A man and his dog live together in England, I think.  They have all kinds of contraptions, making the sky the limit in fodder for show ideas. In this one Wallace (he's the man) gets Gromit a pair of robotic trousers, puts a collar and leash on Gromit and has the trousers take Gromit for a walk.  Enter a nasty penguin as a boarder, who takes over Gromit's bedroom, then tries to do away with Wallace and Gromit.  Guess who wins?

This series is also creative enough that it really doesn't matter if your'e old or young because you'll understand the plots and punchlines of this series. It's also very clean and NO elements of anything derogatory or any sexual innuendos knowing that the proper British has their hands on this and theme is very traditional British. You'll love Wallace on how mellow and typical British he is...all he really eats in this series is nothing but cheese and crackers (Really typical British!) and he washes it down with tea. Grommit is one of those very intelligent dogs that doesn't say much because everything that he wants to say, you can tell it by his facial expressions just like a pantomime or even a Mime himself. The series involves both of them their adventures & misadventures and Grommit is always saving Wallace butt because of his zany ideas.

The technical quality of the animation is very high, for sure, but the creators have also managed to create a wonderful environment and atmosphere. The way they played with light and shadows creates a very nice frame for the stories. And the stories... they have a great mix between a well accomplished portrayal of simple human emotions and social relations with off-the-hook crazy situations. Some of them are for adults to fully appreciate, but small kids won't get turned off by them, nor confused. At least that was the case with our little ones...

It's an entertaining, visually outstanding and smart show. I'd totally recommend it.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Continuing the noble tradition of fictional pets that are infinitely more intelligent than their masters equivalent to their inferior American Cartoon Characters, Wallace and Gromit have cemented themselves into the hearts and minds of fans around the world, literally. Translated into more than 20 languages, their beloved short films and recent feature-length motion picture, Wallace and Gromit in `The Curse of the Were-Rabbit' [not included here, sadly] have been watched, re-watched, and talked about at length by fans and critics alike. Needless to say, their latest adventures bring our heroes into the digital age and they look absolutely brilliant!

I was first exposed to Nick Park's brilliant A Grand Day Out' through their first introduction to the charming duo of Wallace the absentminded inventor and his genius-intellect faithful companion Gromit. From that moment on, I was hooked. My passion for stop motion animation had just found a new hero.

Wallace & Gromit found life in creator Nick Park's sketch books from an early age. Part stereotypical northerner, Nick Park's own father, Wallace grew out of his moustached stocky appearance and settled on his present form in fairly short order. Gromit started life as a cat and made several evolutions before arriving at the look he has today. In fact, when Nick began work on this film in 1983, the very first screen test had Gromit looking like a big old wolf hound. A labour of love, he continued his work at National Film and Television School but ran out of money and missed his deadline. It wasn't until he picked up a job at Aardman Animations that he was able to finish the film.

Sure the technicality of these films is superb, but the real genius of Nick Park and his Aardman Animations compatriots, is in getting us to love all these characters. From the principal heroes to the mice in their basement, we're invested in this adventure from the very beginning, despite the fact that only one character has any dialogue. In 24 minutes we get a complete adventure with a main story and equally enchanting subplot, both leaving us with an uncontrollable grin. What more can you ask for? Now check out the synopsis on the four different terrific animations.

A Grand Day Out [1989] [1080p] [24:00] Confounded by where to go for their bank holiday, Wallace and Gromit are devastated when they realize that they have run out of cheese. With the local corner shop closed for the Bank Holiday, Wallace decides to take a trip to the moon, as ""everybody knows the moon's made of cheese."" Naturally, he has to take his faithful dog Gromit with him. The two build a rocket in Wallace's basement and set off to the moon. Upon landing, Wallace tries the cheese, which he suggests tastes like Wensleydale, but starts to question his theory on the moon. Also, a strange coin-operated robot shaped like an oven, complete with arms, wheels and a creepy weird eye, is encountered by the duo and tries unsuccessfully to stop Wallace from eating the cheese. The robot later seems to wish to go with them to Earth so he can try out some skiing. Wallace and Gromit believe it is after them for stealing the moon cheese and try to escape. Little do they realise there may be someone or something waiting to foil their grand day out? Nominated for an OSCAR and won a BAFTA.

The Wrong Trousers [1993] [1080p] [30:00] It's Gromit's birthday and Wallace honours his friend with a pair of Techno Trousers, designed to relieve the master of the house from having to take his best friend for a walk. Unfortunately, the house has been overrun by Wallace's inventions and they've managed to drain his piggy bank. To ease their financial crisis, Wallace takes in a boarder who quickly commandeers Gromit's bedroom and made his life a living hell. There's something nefarious about this penguin that goes above and beyond petty jealousy, and our canine Sherlock Holmes is bound and determined to expose him for the evil interloper he is. Little do we know how dastardly the penguin's plans truly are. Won an Oscar. Won a BAFTA.

A Close Shave [1995] [1080p] [30:00] The county is suffering though a terrible wool shortage and rampant sheep rustling is on the rise. In fact, late one night, the now legendary rustler loses a sheep on Wallace and Gromit's street. Before he can reclaim the escapee, Shaun the ever hungry sheep ducks into the house, leaving our heroes unwittingly marked. The following morning, the duo's successful new window washing business is called into action. The client? Wendolene Ramsbottom, proprietor of Wendolene's Wools. When Wendolene discovers Wallace is an inventor like her late father, it is instant karma for both. Meanwhile, the rustler, Wendolene's dog, Preston breaks into the boys' home to steal back Shaun, only to discover the blueprints for Wallace's Knit-O-Matic, the perfect solution to bolster his mistresses failing business. The only problem is Gromit is on to Preston's villainy and needs taking out. Framed as the infamous sheep rustler, our favourite pooch is sent to the big house. Can Gromit beat the rap? Will Shaun eat them out of house and home? Will Wallace and Wendolene find true love? Is there more to Preston's evil scheme than just sheep rustling? Won an Oscar and won a BAFTA.

A Matter of Loaf and Death [2008] [1080p] [30:00] Twelve bakers have been found murdered in the past year and guess whose now running a bakery? Wallace and Gromit! On a morning delivery run, the legendary Bake-O-Lite pinup girl, Piella Bakewell, and her precious poodle Fluffles discover their runaway bicycle has no brakes, so it's Wallace and Gromit to the rescue. But Gromit's suspicions about Piella Bakewell bear bitter fruit and, before he can warn his master, Wallace announces they are to be married. Thus begins yet another game of dog vs. evil villain. Can Gromit expose Peilla's treachery before Wallace completes her black widow baker's dozen? It won a BAFTA.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Each of the four episodes is given the 1080p encoded image treatment. With each of them presented in their original aspect ratios you'll be able to see how the series has progressed over the years. The first two episodes A Grand Day Out and The Wrong Trousers, are presented in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. A Close Shave is presented in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio. Rounding out the set is the last episodes A Matter of Loaf and Death that is presented in the widescreen ratio of 1.78:1.

""A Grand Day Out,"" while solid looking, it does appear a little older than the other episodes. The colour is just a tad dimmer. It's also slightly grainier. Still the fine detail is immediately noticeable in the first episode. When you can see the fingerprints on the actual Claymation figures you know you're getting a greatly detailed picture. A Close Shave and The Wrong Trousers both look terrific. The same fingerprints are noticeable here, but the colours are vibrant and the detail is even finer. Every thread and stitch is noticeable in the fabrics that are used to create the world of 'Wallace and Gromit.' A Matter of Loaf and Death does harbour a bit of aliasing, but that's about the only technical anomaly that can be found on the set.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  There are only 2 audio option on this All Region Blu-ray release. You can either go with a 5.1 TrueHD Master Audio and 5.1 Dolby Digital sound track. The 5.1 TrueHD Master Audio sound track is definite the way to go. The range is far greater than its 5.1 Dolby Digital counterpart. I was actually more amazed at how this collection sounded than how the visuals were presented. Barring some muffled dialogue from Wallace, the rest of the audio track on each episode is engrossing. The musical scores are enveloping using the surround channels to create an omnipresent feeling. Panning effects work smoothly for the most part as objects and people travel across the screen. Directionality is also well done. This is all around a pleasantly surprising audio offering.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Nick Park and David McCormick: Creator, writer and director Nick Park provides solo commentaries on the first three films, before being joined by Editor David McCormick on Loaf and Death. Nick is a humble but engaging guy and fans of Wallace & Gromit owe it to themselves to hear all four tracks. Each of the commentaries holds a variety of anecdotes. Each of the commentaries are a must listen material.

Special Feature: The Amazing World of Wallace and Gromit [2009] [1080p] [15:00] This Mini-documentary detailing the origins of the characters. Nick Park says, ""Because they're characters now, they exist; they've got their own life. So they can sort of write their own stories. I don't look at these films and say, 'Yes, that's it. I'm satisfied.' I just want to go onto the next one."" See the original 1983 screen test in which Gromit looks nothing like he does today. Exploring the Wallace & Gromit phenomenon in Japan, France, Germany, China, and Australia. Helping save the Wensleydale Cheese company.

Special Feature: Inside The Wrong Trousers [2009] [1080p] [24:00] A fascinating look back at how far these characters and Nick's filmmaking process have come from their humble beginnings. The evolution going forward is gradual and much less noticeable, but going backwards it's staggering. One-on-one interview with Nick on the origins of the characters, his work on Peter Gabriel's ""Sledgehammer"" music video and creating the dancing chickens and the bumper cars and Creature Comforts [1990], plus turning down potentially lucrative feature film and television projects to focus his attention on The Wrong Trousers. This is totally fascinating stuff.

Special Feature: The Making of `A Matter of Loaf and Death' and How  they Donut [2008] [1080p] Nick Park says, ""It's sort of a bread-based murder mystery 'Who Donut?'"" Interviews with members of the production team about universal love for Wallace & Gromit and energy that goes into every adventure. The quickest turnaround on any film in the series. The team having gelled on Curse of the Were-Rabbit, they're now a well-oiled machine. Over 700 shots in the movie, averaging 32 shots per week. Nick Parks personally acts out the character actions for the animators to draw inspiration from. Using the digital still cameras, the flexibility of camera aesthetics, instantaneous evaluation of each shot, and resulting spontaneity gave the production a whole new feel.

Special Feature: When Wallace Met Harvey [2008] [1080p] It is an in-depth documentary about how to create a Wallace & Gromit Advertising Campaign, to launch the new Harvey Nichols store in Bristol in Partnership with Aardman Animations. You get to see behind-the-scene on how the Aardman Team create the actual animation advertising campaign, especially with the famous Claymation animation characters from the Wallace & Gromit film.

Trailer: Shaun the Sheep in ""Off the Baa!"" [1080p] [7:00] The first episode of Shaun's very own television series, produced by Aardman Animations. When a lettuce truck loses part of its load, Shaun uses the inedible head to show off his football skills in a friendly game with the rest of the flock. Only problem is the neighbouring pigs want the lettuce head for a meal. Very cute! Gag heavy, no dialogue, and introduces us to a gaggle of lovable new characters.

Scrapbook:

Invention Blueprints: [1080p] Image gallery of invention blueprints, production stills, and behind-the-scenes from The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave.

Picture Gallery [1080p] With this Slide Show you get roughly 16 different awesome images from the 4 different parts of each film and behind-the-scene of setting up each shots. If you want to, you can use the pause button to study in detail each image. While this Slide Show is running, you get the Wallace & Gromit music in the background.

A Matter of Loaf and Death Gallery [2008] [1080p] With this particular Slide Show you get roughly 16 different awesome images from the animation `A Matter of Loaf and Death' and again if you want to, you can use the pause button to study in detail each image. While this Slide Show is running, you get again the Wallace & Gromit music in the background.

Finally, Nick Park stands shoulder to shoulder with Walt Disney's nine old men, Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, Henry Selick, Ray Harryhausen, The Fleischer Brothers, Don Bluth, John Kricfalusi and John Lasseter. Creating characters that live on in the hearts and minds of an audience is one of the greatest achievements of any animator. Wallace & Gromit are treasures and this collection will enable us to relive their adventures over and over again. Here's hoping very soon there will be more Aardman Animations adventures, especially as it looks so stunning in the Blu-ray format and that is why I am so honoured to have this added to my Wallace and Gromit Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

Their relationship is unique in the fact that the dog appears to be the wiser and usually comes to Wallace's aid to help save the day. Even though the videos can be found on the internet for free or at a price; web sites offer clips, games, merchandise, and info (history) for fans. This Oscar-winning duo once had a TV series. There are also video games oft them. I bought this collection to view whenever I liked on my e-devices and have them all in one place and convenience. Also, it's a life saver to calm the boys, my grandsons, down while traveling or at home.

All of Nick Park's characters have that loveable, innocent and goofy ""deer in the headlights"" look!  I have all of the Wallace & Gromit DVDs as well as Chicken Run-which ironically was the first Aardman Animations film I ever saw. A collage professor assigned it in a one of my courses for us to critically analyze and report back on for our grade. Everyone loved it and it was fun to see grown ups so excited about a child's film! Discussion on our different observations and rationalizations was surprising. There are films of some really hilarious and highly mischievous sheep as well...gotta see them for yourself...PRICELESS!.

Aardman Animations is in the United Kingdom so all production have British accents that add to their charm. The company had a really bad fire in their main warehouse and lost many valuable archives and lots of history in the late 1990's.

My grandsons LOVE these two characters and replay the film's and movies repeatedly. It's not uncommon to unconsciously recall and hum that catchy theme song or bounce to that beat when hearing it play.

All-in-all this is one you gotta have. It's good, clean fun and witty! Great bonding material and morality teacher for the money. Here's an informative link: [...]:Films. Enjoy!",1403827200,,1871,4.7446153846153845

713524,3,6303521517,"I've seen this series when I was a kid, I enjoy Aardman animations.  The reason I'm giving this a 3 is because of the Amazon video system.  When I watched The Adventures of Tin Tin, I had no trouble at all starting it up and watching each episode with no lag or having to buffer before watching the video.  These ones had trouble, I would constantly pause and wait for it to buffer a little then it'd play for about a minute straight through without trouble, then it'd be back to the slow and go.  Sometimes the loading sign, big yellow circle, would be in the middle while it'd be playing just fine.  I don't know if Amazon has changed anything with it's video system, but it's looks are different than when I watched Tin Tin.  It doesn't have its black and green, but yellow instead of green.  I don't think my internet was a problem, nor my computer itself.  I used the same settings, internet service, etc and the only thing that's different is the video itself.

The four animated shorts look great in high-def. There are also about a dozen two minute Wallace & Gromit cartoons from 2002 called Cracking Contraptions. I had never heard of these, and was delighted to find that they are very inventive and humorous. The disc also has making of featurettes and commentaries. There's also an episode of the spin off cartoon Shaun the Sheep. The newest Wallace & Gromit short, ""A Matter of Loaf and Death"", is okay but not nearly as entertaining as the earlier shorts.

It's not as if Wallace and Gromit is renowned for brilliant plots, but it felt like this one went back to barely trying. Imagine a modern ""action"" movie with all the usual family-unfriendly elements, crammed into a fifteen minute cartoon parody (but without much lightheartedness to make up for it) -- that's about how this felt. There's little suspense, so the story moves pretty quick to threats and abuse until time is finally up and the uninspired ending lands.

There were a few fun gags and a couple touching moments but this short film is absolutely NOT charming or even clever on the whole. Even the contraptions just seemed uninspired and obligatory, mostly just filler. Give ""A Grand Day Out"" another watch before you bother with ""The Loaf of Death (SUBTITLE: THE LADY IS A SERIAL KILLER)"".",1322352000,,968,4.688235294117647

714406,5,6303521517,"Pay no attention to the negative reviews for this movie.  Most of them are referring to the DVD version.  Three of the movies are in widescreen HD format, and A Grand Day Out is presented in fullscreen.  I don't find this to be an issue since this stays true to the original format.  Would you expect to watch Casablanca in widescreen?

Seeing these old favorites in HD is simply amazing.  It's so clear you can even see the fingerprints in the clay.  A great deal of time and effort was put into the visuals for these films, and finally, seeing them on the widescreen can do them justice.  The sound is another great attribute.  Hearing the sounds of Wallace's lab in surround sound really puts you in the moment.  Bottom line, even if you have these movies on DVD, seeing them on Blu-Ray feels like a whole new movie.

The extras on this disc aren't much to brag about (the drawings are kind of lame) but I really enjoy the ""Cracking Contraptions"" and more so, I'm glad they filled the disc with special features as opposed to just the 4 films.

Chicken Run and The Curse of the Warerabbit were enjoyable, but can't hold a candle to these four movies.  Any Wallace and Gromit fan should definitely pick up a copy of this, and those new to Nick Park's work will really enjoy seeing these classics in HD.",1303776000,12,1304,4.428571428571429

We also admire Wallace's crazy inventions, even if they don't always work as intended, and sometimes lead to unexpected situations. The stories are great, have something for both adults and children, and the animation is intricate and beautiful.
 We also really loved watching the extras on the discs, short Wallace and Gromit stories and especially the bits about the making of the films.  The boys were fascinated with the way these plasticine animations were made and my 8 year old has been experimenting with figures made of play dough, Lego people, a digital camera and a computer.

714410,4,6303521517,"Though aware of their existence and somewhat curious about them for some time, I had not previously see any of the Wallace & Gromit shorts prior to seeing ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" when that hit theaters.  The movie made me a fan and soon enough I grabbed the DVD collection of the first 3 shorts.  More recently, I grabbed the Blu-Ray Collection to grab the 4th short, and to get the HD versions.  This Blu-Ray Collection is absolutely THE way to see Wallace and Gromit.  The colors are much more vibrant, and details hidden previously by the overly dark presentation on the DVD set now stand out and make this so much more enjoyable to watch.

The 4 shorts are often reported as being presented in the aspect ratio ""as intended"", and that was the impression I was under for quite a while, but that is debatable with regards to one of them.  ""A Grand Day Out"" and ""The Wrong Trousers"" are shown in 4:3 aspect ratio, as they are on the DVD release.  The short ""A Close Shave"" is shown in an odd 1.66:1 ratio that is not quite the more standard widescreen of 1.78:1 that the final short, ""A Matter of Loaf and Death"", is in.  On the DVD release, ""A Close Shave"" is shown in a 4:3 aspect ratio.  If you watch the DVD and Blu-Ray versions side-by-side, it's a lot more obvious that the Blu-Ray version was simply cropped at the top and bottom to make it ""widescreen""... and clumsily so in retrospect.  I had thought before that they simply opened up the framing on the sides and cropped a little on the top/bottom, but that's just not the case.  It's easy to overlook how badly the cropping is since the Blu-Ray version looks a LOT nicer with the colors more accurate and details popping out that were hidden on the DVD.  Why they did this is rather baffling.

So, what about the videos themselves?  Starting with ""A Grand Day Out"", it's obvious from the get-go that this was an early effort from the animators as they were refining their skills.  The production is lower in quality, with the animations being somewhat jerkier than the others, and the characters' features a bit cruder than what we know and love today.  The pacing I feel is a bit stilted, and it seems to me that the video serves largely as a showcase for demonstrating some of the more complex animations that had to be difficult to pull off.  This doesn't mean that the video wasn't enjoyable.  Quite the contrary, despite being something of a freshman effort, it was full of the witty little bits and pieces that their work is so well known for.

The second video, ""The Wrong Trousers"", is my personal favorite.  The character animation is much smoother than before; their features developed to how we know them today; and the story was a fair bit more complex and paced much better.  It feels like the animators had really gotten comfortable with their craft and, rather than devising a series of scenes to show off their animation skills, paid much greater attention to the story than before.  It's truly a great piece.  The same can be said for the latter two shorts, ""A Close Shave"" and ""A Matter of Loaf and Death"".

In addition to the four short films, they've included as extras the 10 Wallace & Gromit short shorts collectively known as ""Cracking Contraptions"", and an episode of ""Shaun the Sheep"", a spinoff series featuring Shaun, a character who was first introduced in ""A Close Shave"".  I didn't watch ""Shaun"" all the way through, so I can't comment much other than it being in standard def and is basically there to promote the DVD set for that series.  The ""Cracking Contraptions"" extras were rather disappointing in that they appear on the Blu-Ray in standard definition (480p).  Compared to the feature short films, the CC shorts (which are 1-3 minutes long each) are noticeably blurrier on my 50"" HDTV and much of the little details that the W&G films are known for don't stand out like they do in these HD versions of the featured short films.  For as short as the ""Cracking Contraptions"" episodes are, roughly 20 minutes or so in total, surely they could have been remastered in HD along with the featured W&G short films.  For this reason, along with the butchering of ""A Close Shave"", I consider this worth a 3-4 star rating out of 5 stars, rather than a full 5 of 5.  Hopefully we'll see ""A Close Shave"" re-released in HD without the butchering some day.  I'd especially like to see ""Cracking Contraptions"" remastered in HD and released perhaps as a digital download also.  Better yet, as extras on a yet-to-be-announced-but-hopefully-is-coming-soon Blu-Ray edition of ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" (please pretty please!!!).",1300579200,6,4613,4.642857142857143

714454,4,6303521517,"It's Wallace and Gromit, you can't really go wrong there. I got this set for my daughter for her birthday, because she loves everything in the W&G universe. I saw it was a 4 disc set, so I (naively?) expected everything in the W&G universe to be in this case. Unfortunately, it's only 4 shorts, each on a separate disc. Maybe I'm getting old, or am less tech-savvy than I thought I was, but I was expecting quite a lot more than just a 30-minute short on *one whole disc*. As a comparison, I own all three LOTR extended editions, each of which come in a 4-disc set, and those discs contain: 3 hours of straight film, several hours of the same film with different commentaries, and a bajillion hours of behind-the-scenes and other special features. I was quite disappointed to open the W&G set and have to flip through 4 discs to pick out one short. (I realize there are some bonus features on each disc, but they are not extensive, and there is the question of the feature-length movie that is not on here. Certainly not enough material to warrant 4 separate discs.)

I'm not exactly complaining about the content, as I am indeed happy with the 4 shorts I received. I am more complaining about the packaging, and concept of the set in general. This is why I gave it 4 stars, because I did, in fact, get what I ordered. It's not Amazon's fault that I didn't read the description a little more closely. I'm just a little put off that it was packaged this way. Maybe this set was put out in the late 90s? IDK. At the very least, they could have just smashed all 4 shorts onto one disc and sold that as a shorts compilation.",1294704000,10,1620,4.346534653465347
714455,2,6303521517,"As far as the actual Wallace & Gromit films go, a solid 4 star rating, so I can't entirely justify a one star rating.  But the packaging and presentation are inexcusable.  Frankly, I think there should be strict laws against such anti-consumer releases.

  First, four half hour films plus a handful of two-minute quickies could easily fit onto a single disc.  Even with the bonus materials provided, two discs would be more than sufficient.  (The bonus documentaries are merely OK -- not something you'd want to watch more than once.  After you've seen one, the others seem fairly redundant.)

  The big problem is it takes forever to get to the menu and the actual program content.  A seemingly endless series of ""previews"" (these are properly called ""commercials"", folks) are forced on you before you get to the menu.  Yes, you can hit the chapter skip button half a dozen times, but why should someone who has paid for a DVD be forced to do this?  If the publisher truly believed anybody would actually want to see these previews, they would have offered them as an option on the menu, NOT a forced pre-menu screening.

  To make their complete and utter contempt for their customers absolutely undeniable, the same barrage of ads is included pre-menu on each and every one of the four underlength discs.  This is NOT a ""marketing strategy.""  This is just plain insulting and sadistic.

This is unforgiveable treatment of classic material. A pox on the corporate suits who plotted this rip-off.",1253923200,190,479,5.575342465753424
714630,5,6303521517,"Update:  This film has one big problem.  The third film, A Close Shave is in the 16:9 format on this disc while the original was in 4:3.  This means the original film has been cropped to fit a widescreen TV.  Pretty upsetting that they wouldn't include the three original videos in their original form.  The first two, A Grand Day Out and The Wrong Trousers are in their original 4:3 format.

This is a great collection of the Wallace & Gromit films.  The films all look excellent in HD and the behind the scenes features and commentary tracks are wonderful to listen to and really provide a lot of insight into the creation of the films.

For example, the commentary track for A Grand Day Out, the first film, talks about its production over about 6 years and the tricks that Nick used to film each shot.  I'm pretty sure that these commentary tracks are taken from the DVD release, so they are nothing new if you have that version.  The film also has several behind the scenes features which are also a lot of fun to watch and give good insight into the animation process, Nick Parks career, and the growth of the Wallace & Gromit franchise.

The packaging consists of a standard blu-ray case with a paper sleeve that has the same art as the case.  There is no booklet with the film, just the disc.

I think the only thing missing from this collection is the full length feature film, but I think Wallace & Gromit works best in this shorter format.

I would recommend this collection to any Wallace & Gromit fan.  The noticeable improvement in quality when viewed in HD and the behind the scenes and commentary tracks make it a joy to re-watch these excellent films and notice all the little details in the sets and animations.",1253923200,106,1729,4.479233226837061
714631,5,6303521517,"I have always been a fan of the intelligent wit of Wallace and his faithful dog Gromit. I did not expect to see the series on blu-ray, but it is a joy that we now have 4 of their exploits on high definition. I had to travel over 30 miles to find a store (Best Buy) with the item in stock and was able to price match Wal-Mart, making each movie just $5.

I've watched two of the films so far (A Close Shave and A Matter of Loaf and death) and Wallace and Gromit has never looked or sounded better than on blu-ray. I can give a hearty thumbs up on this collection - it is well worth owning.

Some items of note: This is a 1 disc blu-ray release, not 4 discs (which would not make any sense). This collection is also not ""complete"". We are missing Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Curse of the Were Rabbit has to be their best film, so it is sad that it is not included here. The films we do get are great.

-  ""Amazing Adventures of Wallace & Gromit"" featurette
-  ""Inside The Wrong Trousers"" featurette
-  ""How It Was Done"" featurette
-  ""How They Donut"" The Making of A Matter of Loaf and Death featurette

You also get an episode of Shaun the Sheep: ""Off The Baa"" and all ten of the Cracking Contraptions shorts that aired on the BBC website and AtomFilms back in 2002. Technical aspects include MPEG-4 AVC video in 1080p with Dolby Digital 2.0 audio.

Just a little bad news. It looks like it's confirmed that the short film ""A Close Shave"" is the altered version that doesn't have the Happy Birthday song in it. Instead of that song another one is dubbed just like in the WB DVD release. Kinda sucks that they won't pony up the royalties to make this disk as true to the original broadcast as possible. Oh well... it's a small detail.

Wallace is such a [...], but you have to love him, just like Gromit, his long-suffering and tolerant pet, does.  The sequence in which Gromit has a disappointing birthday in The Wrong Trousers is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  We live in a tiny town that makes it difficult to stay au courant with what's happening out there in the wide world.  I bought the original videos based solely on a good review in TV Guide, of all places, and i've always been glad i took the chance.  The humor, the adorable doll-house-looking sets, the music and the sense of friendship the characters share make these really enjoyable.

To make matters worse, a mysterious penguin has moved in, taken over Gromit's room, and, it seems, his spot in Wallace's heart.  Gromit leaves home and discovers the penguin is the notorious criminal ""Feathers,"" who plans to use the mechanical pants to steal a priceless diamond.

The story is very clever, and the claymation completely enchanted me.  It's very droll and sly, often poignant, and really, really funny.  Clever Gromit, absent-minded Wallace, and the sinister penguin are comic characters you can enjoy over and over.  This Academy Award-winning film can be enjoyed by all ages, and I think adults may laugh even louder than the children.

714762,5,6303521517,"Nick Park's first W&G is still my favorite. It shows his incredible skill with clay animation, but that's the least of it. His characters are what really make this movie.

Wallace is the nominal star of the show. Brilliant as an inventor, he's a bit of a twit in all other respects. Gromit, his long-suffering dog, is at least as smart. Gromit is silent, but I keep thinking that he gets all the great lines - that's how good the body language is. The guest star in this program is, well, improbable. You get to find out for yourself, but this additional character is just wonderful.

There are endless little details that round out the story, including background music, visual gags, and fine points of Park's scenes. This is easy to enjoy, and easy to enjoy more than once.

714763,5,6303521517,"This is about the best stop action animation (""claymation"") ever. It's a clever and kid-safe movie, but it's also an incredible technical achievement.

 The plot is well within the range of any five year old: a home inventor creates a wonderful but ridiculous device, an evil-doer puts it to criminal use, thre's a great chase scene, the bad guy ends up behind bars, and the righteous live happily ever after.

 The real fun is in the characters, the little details of the script, and especially in the stop-action animation. Nick Park has put together a perfect blend of characters, voices, and background music, all in the serivce of his wonderful clay figurines.

 There's no way I could describe this and do it justice. You'll just have to see it for yourself - then see it again and again.

The story centers around a clever inventor; Wallace and his genius-dog; Gromit. This, the second time around, our dynamic duo are experiencing financial troubles. When Wallace decides to let out a room to a sly penguin the story really gets going and does not wind-down to the very end with the grand finale.
