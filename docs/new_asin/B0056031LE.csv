4582866,4,B0056031LE,Fabric of the Cosmos is an understandable and quick read. The concept that our three dimensional universe is an illusion plastered on to a two dimensional canvas is intriguing and evokes more questions than answers. Looking forward to seeing Brian Greene explain on PBS.,1320624000,4,270,5.159090909090909
4582867,5,B0056031LE,"This is  the first of a four part series on the universe narrated and essentially created by Brian Greene. I've been a fan of his books because he is very good at explaining complex concepts in a very simple and tangible way. This first episode is an engaging one hour full with historical references that Brian is able to tie into the modern age of theoretical physics. The special effects are worth a thousand words alone because they are able to convey what would be otherwise very complex ideas into something the viewer can comprehend. As an adult I found The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space to be very engaging and I think a high school student who has an interest in physics and science would also find it amazing. I am looking forward to purchasing the other episodes in this series. Why didn't we have stuff like this when I was in school?!

Please keep up the good work at PBS. It's works like this that inspire.",1320451200,15,918,4.458333333333333
4582868,5,B0056031LE,"This is the clearest explanation I've seen of relativity, quantum theory, the nature of space and time - even Newton. Very very good science documentary.

NOVA has surpassed its usual high standards. It's obvious they thought carefully about how to visually explain the concepts.

They did an admirable job in trying to appeal to a broad audience, including to curious people who aren't well-read about science. If you like eye-grabbing graphics you are in luck here. But this show was also enjoyable to me, even though I was already familiar with many of these ideas.

As is NOVA's trend in recent years, for me there was too much hyperactivity in the presentation. But I assume they do this to appeal to younger audiences, and this show will without a doubt be presented in high schools for years to come.

The last part of episode one was mind-blowing, that our universe is like a hologram. I didn't really understand it, but it's a very interesting idea to say the least. (I did see some science news articles a few months ago saying this idea has now been mostly disproved, but maybe those news articles were premature.)

Having seen the previous Brian Greene series named The Elegant Universe years ago, I had high expectations for this new series. Even more so because where Elegant Universe is mostly about only string theory, Fabric of the Cosmos is broader, covering space, time, quantum physics, and multiverses - all core ideas to physics. Now I'm reading the book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fabric-of-the-Cosmos-Space-Time-and-the-Texture-of-Reality/dp/0375727205/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality</a>.

If you are interested in science or just enjoy an excellent documentary, this is a must-have DVD. If you are well-read in science, you may not hear much new here. But you may well see things presented in a new way. And in the end, it's all about the wonder.

[Update] I saw an after-show Q&A with Brian Green at the World Science Festival website. About a third way through, Leonard Susskind joins and gives more good explanation of the holographic principle. It sounds like it's still very much a viable theory.",1320451200,145,2241,5.225626740947075
4582869,5,B0056031LE,"Yes I love it, I'm happy that I got it free with my Prime account, I can't wait to see the other episodes. If the scientist ever come out saying that we are just a hologram. I would be be mad because it means that we are just little mindless animals, that we don't have a point. I hope they discover the Higgs particle. Henery ?Cashmere? observation was amazing.",1320451200,6,362,4.260869565217392

4582871,5,B0056031LE,"Another top notch Nova show that isn't afraid to present challenging concepts.  Usually shows on physics and astrophysics are either totally dumbed down or presented with exploding stars.  This video gives us the idea then explains it with interesting graphics. It is geared toward adults instead of junior high kids.  The final concept, the universe as hologram, can be seen in the Stargate series.  I always wondered how that would work and now I know.  Would love to show this at a Teaparty meeting.",1320192000,7,502,4.928571428571429
4582872,3,B0056031LE,"Brian Green does a great job in describing space-time better than any other. This is a wonderfully informative show. I think a to put together all the new ideas out there is needed. Perhaps, not fairly, I wanted this show to be a new ""Cosmos"". I wanted it to guide me through these topics and place it all in a human perspective. I wanted like Carl to buzz me around the universe. To talk to me about this cosmos in an italian cafe and to ponder about this all really means. Isn't cosmology supposed to be about that?

The show does explain these new topics better than any other I'm aware of. I think just about anyone can understand the new theories scientists coming to grips with in nature. Brian Greene, with his books and now this show, has done more to bring this topic to life. However, Brian is not a good stage presence. I often found that I wanted some of the other scientists to kick out Brian and take over the show especially guy from University of Maryland. Maybe it was his voice. Maybe it was me wanting Carl Sagan.

Another beef is they brought up the shocking concepts of holograms and black holes storing information in the last 10-15 mins of the show. Those topics are truly bizarre to me yet those ideas are not really well developed. It left me saying ""Really, You really expect me to believe that?"". I was hoping they would do a bit show me how those concepts could be true but it did not.

All in all, watch this if you want to get up to get a good overview of space time and how perspective on space time have and are changing. If you want something more maybe another view Cosmos will do the trick.",1320192000,6,1625,4.303921568627451
4582873,5,B0056031LE,"I just watched the first segment of the new series, The Fabric of the Cosmos, and thought it was well done. I remember watching the Carl Sagan Cosmos series years ago and Brian Greene does an admirable job in making some fairly exotic physics about the ultimate reality and reconfigurability of space come alive.

4583016,4,B0056031LE,"I think it missed a very important point in Episode 3 : Shooting individually electrons in a double slits, the distribution is explained by the wave probability, but this alone doesn't explain the amplitude/intensity of lines in the barrier where they are hit at, which look the diffraction.lines of two imaginary waves. In other words, something should be more into that in order to explain the diffraction lines,  because to explain those lines look like a single electron becomes a wave and suddenly turns  into an electron .As weird as this sounds, it's the only explanation of this experiment. Only probability waves does not explain the existence of  diffraction lines if two waves were not in there in the first place.  If no waves where there how the stronger amplitudes or canceling out lines can be explained when electrons were shot one by one ? Probably the probability waves show the probability where the physical electron will be, but some waves of directing this electron should be in there all the time with him.... OR the electron does spooky action",1486339200,2,1067,4.911111111111111

Our ordinary view of life as experienced day by day at work, in traffic, in our interactions with ordinary reality is changed/challenged by this series.

The episodes on quantum physics and time are the most fascinating, but the other two episodes on space and the multiverse also are worthwhile.  Greene and the graphics explain quantum mechanics better than anyone.  Did you know that tiny particles have already been transported Star Trek-style?  He explains how and the implications of such quantum technology.  The Time episode simplifies Einstein's theory of general relativity such that people with no formal schooling on the topic (like myself) can understand the concept of space-time; that is, space and time are part of the same dimension where time slows as one moves through space.  This series is a must to understand the hottest topics in cosmology.

As a trained Engineer and technophile, I have long been familiar with many of these concepts, but this Documentary gives truly great yet easy to understand illustrations into our growing understanding of how the Universe operates, even in our day to day lives. I have watched and enjoyed many science oriented Documentaries over the years, (and there are many many good ones), but this is one of the best I have seen. Dr. Greene keeps your attention with his intelligent analogies. Even those with only a rudimentary understanding of quantum mechanics will be looking at life a little differently from now on, and perhaps like Dr. Greene, thinking of how these new discoveries will continue to mold our perspectives into the future. Or, perhaps as Dr. Greene alludes to, the future is here already. EXCELLENT!!",1465171200,7,964,4.9937888198757765

4583900,5,B0056031LE,"This is a broad and entertaining, four-part series, introducing some basic perspectives related to physics.  The first segment concerned space, and the second enlarged this picture to include time, in the current unified framework of spacetime, in which physicists think about the world. The next episode develops the main theory of ""existence"", quantum mechanics, and the last is very speculative, considering the place of our world in a possibly grander scheme of ""many"" worlds.  The visual effects, intended to educate, are clever and appealing, and really communicate a feel for thinking about the world from the viewpoint of a physicist, in a way intelligible to all viewers.  I think that it is largely successful in this, and is able to bring the ""big ideas"" in physics alive to stimulate the imagination.  Long ago, it was popular presentations like this that attracted my interest in astronomy and physics, and I expect this series to be especially meaningful to the young.

If you want Star Wars video, then watch Cosmos with Neal Tyson. If you want an understanding of Einsteins relationships, then watch this, you'll find it exceptional. It's done in such an elegant way.

4583995,5,B0056031LE,"I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewers that this is the best series I've seen yet on explaining the inexpiable nature of our world and universe.

But also, I' like to throw out a notion or two that helped me immeasurably toward understanding time, space, gravity, and quantum mechanics. I have always been interested in time travel. Any Star Trek episode with time travel always fascinated me. And classics such as 'The Time Machine' equally so. But at the same time the idea of traveling to the past or future always left me slightly befuddled.

What changed everything for me came not from physics, but more from meta-physics. It is the notion that reality is an illusion. That what we see in everyday life is not actually real. Time and space are part of that illusion. Without trying to *prove* such a notion here, I would just suggest that if one at least considers the possibility of this, then suddenly the bizarre qualities of time, or the vastness of space, are not all that unfathomable. Reality is not set in stone. It does not have inherent unchangeable qualities. Rather, reality is being manufactured moment to moment. There *is* someone in control setting the rules though. Some may say the source of that rule making is a Divine presence. Some may say it is the Divine nature of mankind setting the rules.

Either way, a conscious being may well be ""thinking reality"". The point is, IF that is true, than time and space can be anything we say it is. Reality can have any quality we wish. It can be composed of atoms, and those atoms in turn can be composed of a zoo of any kind and amount of sub-atomic particles we wish to make them.

The idea that it is *thought* that is real... not matter...  is what made the cosmos for me, a non-physicist, much more acceptable and understandable. If I accept the idea that we may be *dreaming* reality the suggestion of something like time being able to run backwards is not so startling. And the thing is, the more theoretical physicists learn about the nature of matter, the closer they get to the notion that thought is the basis of reality. Look at what quantum physics and Heisenberg's Uncertainly Principal are telling us. This Fabric of the Cosmos series is bringing it out wonderfully in illustrating that matter is in an uncertain state until it is observed. In a manner of speaking it is not there, at least in a cohesive state, until we focus on it.

A more poignant example is quantum entanglement. The series is claiming that a set of paired particles react to a change in state to the other, INSTANTANEOUSLY, regardless of the distance between them! Instantly. Faster than light. Does that not suggest that the space between the particles is perhaps not really there? Explains, a lot, doesn't it? And from there you might think about the concept of free will and self-determination. One could argue that quantum physics tends to demonstrate that free will is indeed so.

And from there, perhaps destiny, fate, and even karma play a role. I read one time about the Indian religion of Jainism. The Jains apparently stated centuries ago, long before the discovery of dark matter and dark energy, that karma is an invisible force that permeates the universe. Kinda makes you think.

Where scientific minds fall short of coming up with a 'theory of everything' may be in their inability (at present) to make the leap into the meta-physical realm. The next book I am going to read is by an author who is claimed to have made that leap by combining mysticism with science (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wholeness-and-the-Implicate-Order/dp/0415289793/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wholeness and the Implicate Order</a>).

4584324,5,B0056031LE,"Fantastic! I attribute this series to my son's now passion for science (and some of his friend's as well!). He saw the first fabric episode when he was 5. He did not want to watch it at first. After watching it he looked at me and said ""wow"". I will never forget that moment. He became obsessed with all four of the segments and has watched them numerous times. When he asked friends for a sleep over he would say ""we can watch fabric of the cosmos!"".
One of his little girl friends was over watching it with him for the first time while I was in the kitchen making dinner, I overhead her say with MUCH passion ""I HAVE to learn more about science I don't know ANY of this!"". I walked around the corner and she had her hands on her face in amazement. My son is almost seven now and whenever I get a little stressed he asks if I want to watch ""fabric"" :) or look at an ap we got called ""wonders of the universe"". Because of ""Fabric"" my son is learning the periodic table because he ""gets"" that they are what make up all that we know. He wants to know where the elements come from, how much is left etc....
He does great impressions of some of the scientists that always make me laugh and he thinks Brian Greene is the coolest guy ever....wants to get his autograph as well as some of the scientists :)
If this series was shown to all first graders I believe it would have a profoundly positive impact on our world!",1431388800,8,1412,4.156934306569343

4584326,4,B0056031LE,"An interesting, if inaccurate, take on time space.  I will explain it, and will note that on Monday, May 11th of 2015, I put down my theory of what time actually is and isn't in this review of the second episode of ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"".

The episode itself explores what the essence of of space actually is, and goes on to explain the Higgs field, and how it permeates 70% of space, and Brian Greene makes the apt notion that the Earth itself is roughly 70% covered by oceans.  It turns out that space itself isn't just space, but has ""stuff"" comprising it above and beyond dark matter.

But the mystery of ""Time"" is still prevalent.  We know what a Higgs' field is, but how does that go on to explain what Time actually is?  The truth; it doesn't.  So I'm going to have to do it for you.

Chronological time is a measure we, as human beings, created to measure the chronological distance between one event and another.  Time, as it relates to matter, again is not a real thing, but a perceived alteration in existence as matter is stressed under an increase in velocity.  That is to say as ""time"" alters for a mass as it approaches the speed of light, Chronological Time hasn't changed, but the mass-energy that is being accelerated has been stressed by energy injected into that system.  So when the time differential experiments with a plane in the air travelling at high speed with synchronized watches in both on the plane and in some laboratory below on the surface, we are witnessing a stress being put on the mass energy system that is travelling faster than the mass energy system at rest.  Even though the clocks are different, what they measure hasn't been the objective outside measure of time, but in essence the stress put on the accelerated mass energy expressed as a quantity of time.

The idea that there was no time before the big bang is an interesting one, but predicated on the notion that time is a tangible thing that can be manipulated and it hinges upon a mass having energy injected into it.  It actually doesn't.  The perception that because a mass has had a chronological alteration leads to the thought that therefore time is a real thing, when in reality objective time is still moving as it always has.  The big bang itself is said to have been the result of two massive energy membranes colliding with one another giving rise to our universe.  If this is the case, then that event happened before the big bang as a measure of chronological time, and not as a measure of mass-energy.

In short; because we've verified that mass can have an acceleration of time (or deceleration of time, depending on your point of view), that somehow the chronological measure of time outside that system has changed.  But it hasn't.  It's the mass-energy system (or mass) that has gone through a change of state relative to everything else because of the energy put into it via acceleration.

I could be dead wrong, but I tend to think not.

Either way this show attempts to answer or postulate why time is so elusive, but fails to deliver on explaining what time actually is.  Physical time is a state of mass relative to the rest of the universe.  Chronological time is our concept of measuring chronological passages of events.  And that's where the researchers continue to get confounded and confused, for since the math has ""t"" standing for time in the equation, it is therefore difficult to extract that term, or label it as something entirely different from what said researchers are working with.

Even so, Brian Greene and his fellow scientists do give us more insight into how the universe operates, and some fascinating postulates on what might be forthcoming in the future.  Time travel?  I doubt it.  Greene says the math predicts it, but the math doesn't mean that it's practical as a physical manifestation.  And that's the real fault of the series; for as insightful as it is, it occasionally stumbles over its own shoe laces.

Either way, watch and enjoy.",1431302400,,3993,4.637268847795164

4584535,1,B0056031LE,"The supporters of Quantum Mechanics keep telling us about their ""revolutionary"" theory--but it's been around for approx. 100 years and is still completely useless for actual engineering work.  The theory cannot be used to calculate the properties of matter--engineers have had to use empirical regression equations instead.

As with most of the talking heads on the show, I'm a Ph. D. theoretical physicist / engineer who attended MIT.  I will now provide a step-by-step refutation of the nonsense perpetrated by this show.

1.  The Rutherford experiment wasn't even mentioned--you know, the one in which Rutherford used alpha particles to bombard gold foil to see how the particles were deflected.  He concluded that the scattering was due to a Coulombic repulsive force between the protons in the ""nucleus"" and the protons in the alpha particles.  He failed to run the experiment with neutralized alpha particles; if he had, he would have found the same scattering, but this would have shown that the repulsion is not electrical.

2.  Bohr simply hypothesized away the problem with his electrons in ""orbits"" around the ""nucleus"" that the electrons would spiral right down, and the charges would neutralize.  All experiments show that positive and negative charges in close proximity neutralize one another!

3.  Neutrons decay in something like 12 minutes (their half-life).  How could neutrons be stable inside atoms?  They cannot be, and the so the nuclear theory of the atom is dead wrong.

4.  Protons repulse one another, of course.  Supposedly a ""strong force"" inside the ""nucleus"" keep the protons together.  This force is supposedly mediated by pions--but no pion current has ever been found inside a ""nucleus""!

5.  The spectroscopists assert that the electrons are in definite orbits, in order to account for the spectra of atoms.  But other physicists assert that the electrons are simply probability waves, in order to account for the two-slit experiment.  Both groups are dead wrong.  Electrons are not constituents of atoms, period.  Spectra result from the quantized translational motion of atoms.  Atoms and subatoms like electrons are rotating photons with quantized spins.  In the two slit experiment with photons or electrons, the slits disturb the photons (whether by themselves or rotating as electrons), causing them to ""hop"" onto other progressing space units, thus accounting for the scatter.

6.  In quantum ""entanglement"" two particles are created simultaneously in the same space-time location and moved apart in coordinate space.  But they are not moved apart in coordinate time and hence if one of them is perturbed, so will be the other.  There is no ""spooky action at a distance""--the particles are still connected in coordinate time.

Here are some references for you to read:  The Case Against the Nuclear Atom by Dewey B. Larson, The Unmysterious Universe by Ronald W. Satz, and ""The Case Against Modern Physics"" by Ronald W. Satz.  The Reciprocal System of theory is far superior to Quantum Mechanics in every way.  There is now available The Reciprocal System:  Microcosmos Database which calculates the major properties of matter from theory alone--something that Quantum Mechanics is completely incapable of doing.",1419811200,10,3254,5.2890625

These people need to have a real job, with daily cause to develop something useful.
Nova tries to put some suspense into the the show, but taken apart an analyzed for content, this should never have been produced.
This puts me in a foul mode.  Cutting corners, and not testing against content of merit, or principled methods.  The author and those behind the production spend eons on conjuecture.
The film spends considerable time musing about space, vast nothingness, and yes space is important, without sufficient space, we would be squashed.  Space (seemingly empty distances between objects) serves purpose in design.  In orbital mechanics as well as particle physics, when distances get shifted, balance is rapidly sought by things in nature.  e.g. nature seeks balance.

This series of four different lessons are what I call a simple, easy to understand course of theoretical physics for a psychologist. I have to thank every person involved in the production of this great tool. I cannot go into details here but the fact that ""space""is not a void and the existence of sub-atomic particles through all the universe is very useful to better explain human behavior. So is dark matter and dark energy.

Amazingly, though I read the book years ago, I had no inkling that Brian Greene, its author, had made this series.

the one on quantum physics was definitely the one I enjoyed the most! However it is best to watch the first two, then the third one on quantum physics. The theories presented are the kind that visualization helps, and this is done very well. Sometimes i could even picture the formulas as I was watching thinking yes, i can see that even in the abstract form of the equation statement.

the quantum computer is mentioned, which there was a news article recently that one has been built. So this series helps you understand the difference between computers as we know them, and a quantum computer.",1388793600,,941,4.497076023391813

Brian Greene does a fantastic job of explaining the cutting-edge theories of physics in such a way that a non-scientist like me can (sort of) understand them.  Based on his book of the same name, this series delves into popular topics such as string / M theory, quantum physics, multiple infinite universes, and general relativity.  It's all fascinating, and you don't have to study 4 - 8 years of torturous mathematics to understand it.

The only con I have (and it's a minor one) is that Greene goes into far more depth on these subjects in his book.  Time and budget constraints obviously limited how much material the show could cover in a television format.  But, that could also be spun into a pro -- if these topics interest you, read more about them in his book!

I had him watch this and the movie ""What The Bleep"", and this proved to be quite effective to teach him why his father does not believe in religion. I am agnostic. Its not that I don't believe in a higher power, but I can not put my faith in the ignorance of man who wrote these religious books that have been misinterpreted through the ignorance of man hundreds of years ago.

Brian Greene is a fantastic teacher and is very pleasant and enjoyable to listen to.  The topics are highly interesting and explained in a very understandable way.,1373932800,,269,5.068181818181818
4585439,4,B0056031LE,It was very interesting.  In some places hard to follow.  Would be better if they took it down a notch so that simpler ideas built slowly to the more 'outrageous' ideas of time and space not being what we have thought.  It was helpful for me though.....and I would like to see more shows like this.,1373414400,2,298,4.285714285714286
4585440,1,B0056031LE,"This series should be evaluated in a unique way, specifically its effect on our culture.  Science is seen as the antithesis to superstition, mysticism and literal religious beliefs.  This process has been going on in Western Civilization since the beginning of the enlightenment, having battled the forces of ignorance for generations. Science prevailed not because it had more evocative music than cathedrals, or more enchanting stories than those in Genesis or created more transcendent emotional states than mystics; but because of a few simple qualities that have been codified in what we now call ""The scientific method.""

The rules are rigorous, but all are designed to transcend fads or public opinion, and to be based on verifiable evidence that supports theoretical structures. My evaluation of Briane Greene's ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" which I saw on NOVA goes beyond the ratings of 5 to 1 star, which would indicate being worthless, to a negative number, as I will argue that this presentation is harmful to this most valuable enterprise of science.  I say this irrespective of the selected array of experts that were presented on the program, as this is a distortion by exclusion of those in the field who reject this approach who have made great contributions.

It will be useful to pick up one of many reviews here rated 5 stars with universal ""useful"" ratings.  This one ended with this: ""Other science programs I recommend to accommodate your collection are ...................... 4) ""What the Bleep!? - Down the Rabbit Hole.""

That film takes the tone of the Nova program to it's next stage, supporting ESP along with mystical beliefs that certainly would be possible based on the extrapolation of ""weirdness"" at the quantum level to higher organisms. Like the Nova program, they had scientists who later said they were taken out of context, but no more so than in Greene's presentation. ESP has no scientific validity, even though quantum entanglement could cause such an effect, just as it could provide for teletransportation.  ""Could"" is the word used to excuse transforming science into science fiction, both in that film and this Nova program being reviewed.

I do not have the space to point out all of the breaches of  the scientific method of this video, specifically the requirement to test any hypothesis before it becomes accepted. The program talks about string theory as if it exists. Let me recommend Lee Smolen's book, ""What's wrong with Physics"" to understand that this theory is conceptually impossible to verify. Yet, it is universally accepted, for reasons similar to why Greene's work is applauded --specifically, social and institutional dynamics.

And then there is the perversion of the concept of time illustrated by those graphic film clips, where the past and future are identical. Since the reviewer quoted Einstein, here's one from a 1950 letter he wrote to Erwin Schrdinger, one of the giants of 20th century physics.

""You are the only contemporary physicist... who sees that one cannot get around the assumption of reality if only one is honest. Most of them simply do not see what sort of risky game they are playing with reality -- reality as something independent of what is experimentally established""

Time is only paradoxical to those who refuse to see it as a human term for an actual phenomenon.  It is to be understood by scientific induction, rules made to fit experience; and is only perverted beyond recognition by deduction from non-applicable findings of isolated quantum research. I write about it in my essay that can be googled, ""I""ll stop now, I'm out of time.""

Just as science and religion are uncomfortable companions, so it is when a rigorous discipline is subordinated to entertainment goals. This series is worthy of Academy Awards in special effects, costumes, and writing- and if it had been categorized as science fiction, in the class of Avatar or Star Wars, I would actually applaud it. But it was sold as being an extension of established fact, as the conclusions of the most respected minds in science without the input of those who would condemn this approach-- which is close to being criminal.  How this will ultimately affect our culture, our continued respect for the enterprise of science, is a question that deserves our concern.

In the second half of the episode we're explained that the universe is moving through time from a more orderly state to a more disorderly state. First of all, they should have precisely defined what they call order. Second, the parabols used in the show (the pages of the book and the broken glass of wine) give the impression of creating disorder, but if you take other examples you get a different impression. The birth of the solar system, as a case, could be considered a movement from a disordered state to a more ordered state. If the pages of the book you throw in the air get dispersed, they're not really in disorder, they are actually arranged in a new order, even though to a typical reader it would be more difficult to make sense of this new order. To me it doesn't seem that the universe is becoming more ""disordered"" but rather is moving into a new order. I'm no specialist but maybe there is confusion between Order/Disorder and Complexity. Maybe the concept of order is too tainted with cultural aspects that have nothing to do with physics.

Saying that the value of Dark Energy, being so 'perfectly small', would be explained by a multiverse , and so SUPPORTS the theory of multiverse , is actually a LOGICAL FALLACY.  I  SAID  LOGICAL  FALLACY

The show is inspiring and brings lots of material for thought. Why don't the paths of electrons in our brain cells follow the physical rules of entropy rather than the rules of reason?... Any way, the ramifications of the scientists beliefs go far beyond any established religion (eg. all possible results of any action actually all happen, but in other dimensions in new universes that emerge every instance...).

One small irritation tough which made me rate this at 4 stars. Why does Brian Greene try to explain more dimensions than the four we know by mixing the concept of scale into it? (It's only briefly in the fourth show, but he did the same in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NOVA-The-Elegant-Universe/dp/B0000ZG0TA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NOVA - The Elegant Universe</a>). Why would we need to go to a small scale in order to understand a 5th dimension? It's so much easier! William Branham had a great way to explain it: For this illustration pretend not to know how television and radio works (ignore modulation on electromagnetic waves): Television travels through walls and is everywhere, just put an antenna up anywhere. On the TV dial, you can choose channels, peer in to different worlds and places without physically moving the TV set to a different location. William Branham used this to illustrate that heaven and hell are right here, just move up or down in an extra dimension. We do not need scale for clearing up the concept of extra dimensions (a concept humans have understood for centuries).
Scale only comes in to explain why we only perceive 3 dimensions + time: we're trapped into a thin plate of a 5th dimension, just like pac-man is trapped on the two dimensional screen and cannot jump over the wall when a ghost comes around the corner.

Having said that, the show was very educating and clear. I learned quite allot from it! It is quite condensed, not going into detail about the math, but visualizing the concepts.

I'm a college student, and I've taken my share of Chem, Bio, and Physics to learn basic rules and understand what happens, how to calculate formulas, etc. However, none of these classes ever answered the major, over-arching ""why?"" questions. In all honesty, memorizing formulas and rules for for undergrad university classes actually bores me - however, the thought-provoking material presented in these documentaries greatly fascinates me. All I want from a documentary is to be entertained, learn accurate and current information, and have enough supporting information to believe the claims (but not have so much evidence that I need to have Masters Degree to understand it.) The Fabric of the Cosmos is the most well presented and concise documentary on this topic.

~~~~~~
Here's why this documentary series is so good:
~~~~~~
1) Presentation. It's not a boring science documentary by any means. It's a NOVA documentary meaning it's high budget, well animated and genuinely fun to watch. This isn't something that you have to force yourself to watch - the plethora of examples, metaphors, clips from interviews with professors and researchers, and thought provoking questions always keep you engaged. That being said it's still a documentary and you do have to pay attention - you can't just stare blankly at the screen and hope to become an expert.

2) The information is given in a question-answer format. They start by explaining something simple that seems like common sense and then they keep complicating it by asking questions that require new experiments and thus new theories. In other words, they present models and then raise questions and show anomalies that push for a new paradigm.  Rather than going in a boring linear progression that cites major scientists to show how humanity's perception of the universe progressed, the question answer approach is much more engaging.

3) The supporting evidence they give is also very concrete and useful. Every study and experiment is described well enough to not bore but also explain what is actually going on. Rather than just saying ""Joe Mac did an experiment that proved blah blah,"" they phrase it as ""Joe Mac devised an experiment using blahbalh and if the results were blabhblah then the theory would be supported"". When it comes to science, I usually am a skeptic until I see solid evidence and this show backs up almost all of its claims. Going back to what I said earlier, this is because they start from a common sense, every-10-year-old-knows-that idea and keeps on building until they arrive at today's current model.

4) Easily accessible but highly informative. This is the beauty of the series: you could know nothing about physics or the universe and still learn a huge amount, but even if you are knowledgeable on the subject, you won't be bored. There are plenty of metaphors that anyone could grasp (for example, they use the popular rubber sheet gravity example to show how heavy objects like the earth can bend space as shown by sinking into the rubber sheet, then showing how this causes smaller objects like the moon to stay in revolution around the earth -- if you couldn't catch that, blame my description because the metaphor in the video is gold). Whilst making complex ideas easier to grasp, they continuously cite experiments or play clips from interviews that introduce new information and keep you engaged.

Conclusion

This series is new, features quite new discoveries, and is packed with information. If you watch it, you will learn plenty and maybe you could even share it with friends or family over dinner. The best part is that it's open to anyone and it's actually fun to watch. If you're a prime member, it's even free to stream. If you want to get an overview of how the universe ""works"" but don't want to read dozens of technical and theoretical texts, then this is the perfect introduction to satisfy your curiosity.

4585742,5,B0056031LE,"""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" is a four-part educational series by Nova from 2011. It is based on the book ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene who also serves as the host for all four videos. It is available in 1080i high-definition (HD) on blu-ray and this is the what I purchased. So my review and 5-star rating are based on the HD blu-ray version.

The videos in the series are:

Part 1: What is Space? - 56 minutes
Part 2: The Illusion of Time - 56 minutes
Part 3: Quantum Leap - 55 minutes
Part 4: Universe or Multiverse? - 56 minutes

Parts 1 and 2 are provided on blu-ray disk 1 and Parts 3 and 4 are provided on blu-ray disk 2.

In ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" Brian interviews many of the same experts from his 2003 series ""The Elegant Universe"" but the material only overlaps a little. I have both series and consider ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" to be an excellent companion to ""The Elegant Universe"". Sadly, the latter is not available in HD like the former.

The information in the Amazon ad contains some mistakes. The aspect ratio of the HD version is NOT the old 1.33:1. Rather, it is a widescreen 1.78:1 and looks gorgeous on a 1080i or 1080p widescreen HDTV/monitor. Plus, the total running time for the four videos is not 240 minutes. It is 223 minutes.

4585745,5,B0056031LE,"ANOTHER GREAT UP-TO-DATE SCIENCE PROGRAM FROM PBS/NOVA
How well do you understand this universe you live in? Science has come a long way in recent times. Programs nowadays are transformed to keep pace with our rapid information media society. This one is no exception, as it excels at getting the latest and greatest info to make you ponder deeper about the fabric of what this world is really made of, from the tiniest of strings, to the expanse of what's beyond our own universe.

BASICS ARE REVIEWED
Some basic concepts (and prerequisites for the laymen) are reviewed in the 1st episode, Space. (For example, this show is NOT about black holes. But they briefly review it to show a concept they're getting at, i.e. the fabric of space, and how it can be warped.) Otherwise, besides episode 1, there are may be parts of this program where you may need to hit the pause to process the info and let it sink in.

TIME AND SPACE DEVIATIONS
As a follow up to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NOVA-The-Elegant-Universe/dp/B0000ZG0TA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NOVA - The Elegant Universe</a>,"" Dr. Brian Greene continues where he left off, presenting hard science understandable today by using colorful illustrations, and the down to earth explanations. This is a biggest noticeable improvement compared to programs decades ago. Modern physics is a tough topic to grasp even for those with a science background, because this topic is beyond the realm of what we humans normally perceive in our daily lives. For example, in the Time episode 2, Greene takes an imaginary sword and slices across the time continuum graft, to show how the concept of ""now"" may not be the same as someone else's ""now."" Deviations in the ""now"" (or ""then"") may be more evident in the large vastness of time and space (distances), but doesn't mean it's not there for shorter distances too, such as here on earth. It may be negligible or irrelevant, to the point where time variations are barely perceivable in our daily lives, especially from a human perspective. But it IS there, from a relativity (Einstein) standpoint. (Note: Einstein once said, ""the distinction between the past, present, and future is nothing more than a stubborn persistent delusion."") The notion of ""now"" being different than someone else's ""now,"" is based on each observer's perspective in what is seen and perceived. This has huge implications in that a different observer's time may be slightly different from someone else's time (and space), and because of that, the significance is that we carry our universe with us individually. Hence, in essence, an infinite amount of possibilities would then exist, with each observer associated with each time and space. This leads to the concept of parallel universes and this idea is the harbinger for one of the many basis for the multi-verse theory, episode 4. Time dilation is the same principle as when we physically travel (far distances), our clocks become different relative to others, and we disengage our universe from others' in terms of time and space. Likewise, as with time travel (via wormholes), the paradoxes associated with that is nothing more than a splitting detachment from your previous universe. So, BTW you can go back in time, but if you kill your great, great grandfather you won't disappear.

THE WORLD IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK
Greene further states that our whole universe and how we view and experience it, may be nothing more than an illusion, or even a simulation. This might be mind boggling to grasp, though not a new concept, nor his original idea, it is really based on these 3 or more premises: 1) The holographic principle of the universe. That what we see and experience are really projections of a higher dimension, by Michael Talbot (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Holographic-Universe-The-Revolutionary-Theory-of-Reality/dp/0062014102/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Holographic Universe: The Revolutionary Theory of Reality</a>). For example if someone sees your shadow on the ground, it is really a projection of the 3 dimensional you. 2) Quantum Probability (that everything possible exists, in a wave form), and that when we look, the wave function collapses, and only 1 possibility is revealed (the double-slit experiment), i.e. the one your mind (brain) will seep out and perceive to be real. This program illustrates this point by showing the moon fluctuating in all areas behind Greene, but by the time Greene turns around to look, the moon is in one place only. 3) Since every particle is linked to every particle (via entanglement), your thoughts (subatomic particles in you brain) have an impact on how ""your"" universe behaves and molds to your perception (implying the universe is framed). Also revealed is that entanglement is instantaneous, i.e. faster than the speed of light.

ENTANGLEMENT
Noteworthy, it shouldn't be a surprise that entanglement possesses inferences faster than speed of light. After all, instantaneity (like spontaneity) is an entity, whereas the speed of light is an actual physical property (measurable), like temperature. Much the likes the speed of sound including its variation through different media. We assumed light speed ""c"" to be the benchmark which cannot be surpassed. The speed of light is actually the speed of a subatomic particle ""hv"" photon, which has mass. Inferences like entanglement have nothing to do with particle, and hence not limited to a speed. So in essence, it was our own myopia in hindsight at man's progression in the history of scientific knowledge and revolution in assuming ""c"" to be the ultimate limit. Greene alludes to a concept where theoretical work is still being done regarding the notion of one particle inside the black hole, while the other is entangled outside the hole. Ie, measuring the property of the particle outside the hole could determine what goes on inside a black hole. Bet you didn't see that coming.

STRING THEORY
Episode 4 further goes into the idea that everything is made up of strings (11 dimensions curled up in an array of vibrations or harmonic frequencies), and how we may be sitting on membrane(s). This concept or theory stemmed from the fact that gravity force is so much weaker than the other 3 fundamental forces: electromagnetic, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Mathematical calculations in the gravity force shows it may actually be as strong as the other 3, but its appearance is greatly weakened as the subatomic particle representative graviton floats partially in only briefly then exits out of our current dimension.

BOTH EVERYTHING AND NOTHING EXISTS SIMULTANEOUSLY, UNTIL YOU PEEK
In episode 3, The glove in the box thought experiment (the one glove is neither right nor left until you open the box and look), is just another way of showing the classic Erwin Schrdinger's cat equations. Not sure why they didn't just reference that to Schrodinger, who played a much more historical and significant role in quantum mechanics.

REALITY OF THE FABRIC
After watching this program, you'll see that the real universe (true reality) is much different than your normal daily perceived universe. Remember after all, we are seeing the universe from our encapsulated (restricted) human mental elucidation. The human body is so tiny in comparison to the real universe. Much like a single bacterium on top of a desk cannot perceive the entire desk. Careful, you may be inclined to assume I mean we are too small, but likewise we are too big to see the functions of our same small universe: the molecular and particle structures behaving the irrational quantum dynamics. The universe of the small is another whole vibrant invisible to our physical human being perception, and size of course is all relative. (Fortunately Heisenberg crunched out the mathematical differential equations to show the unpredictability of the tiny world in his famous Uncertainty Principle.)

HUMAN PERCEPTION AND GREAT MINDS
You can see the span of large to small is so exponential, and the being of man to study it is restricted to not just physical size. Not only are we within the cosmos, we are part of it. The limitation of our understanding of the entire scientific basis of our cosmos is intrinsic to us, and biased on our humanistic observation and perception.  But we have programs like this to provide the framework facilitating us to think ""outside the box.""  Life after all, is the greatest mind simulation game played out in this universe and from there it's all about discovering the fabric barring such limitations.  Life, and the constituent of our existential being, is essentially hampered in 2 elementary ways. 1) Each of us in a physical sense has mass and hence is ""hardware"" subjected to the laws of physics (such as the 2nd law of thermodynamics), i.e. we are not immortal. Also our hardware inputs are limited to only 5 senses. 2) Our mind is the ""software,"" by which each human is the recipient and beneficiary of consciousness to observe and understand the cosmos, but its processing ability is limited by IQ (we don't possess infinite smartness).  But the latter requirement is that only a mere simple thought may be enough to elucidate this fabric of reality. The scaffolding outside the box (true reality) has always been there from the beginning of big bang (and possibly before). It just takes a run of the mill imagination to see it. Lamentably it is our own daily routines that equilibrate our conscious worldly thoughts back to the secular attentiveness (the way we are wired). But the great minds of our times (and programs like these) maintain that perception in check. Will the next Einstein, please step up to the plate. Okay Mr. Greene, you're on deck for the clutch hit; and in this program he drives in the winning run (figuratively).

QUANTUM MECHANIC BASIS OF THE SIMULATION MODEL
If you're still tripping about the simulation model, I'll carve out more details here. If you're still reading, I assume I've held your attention. I'll pat my back. OK, here goes. Since the fabric of everything (time, space, and mass) is quantized, everything comes in distinct packets (of energy, mass, and even time) rather than a titrated gradient. In essence, when the ""stuff of everything"" is broken down, the subatomic particles become whimsical flavors of properties humans can't even name, except for something like ""charm"" or ""strange."" (Note: yes those 2 do sound subjective but are real objective physics terms. Scientists had difficulty assigning nomenclature because it's beyond the realm of Newtonian classics; one even coined it ""pigments of your imagination."") The easiest way to put it, life and cosmos is analogous to a simulation. In the simplest terms, like a computer simulation, made of bunch of ones and zeros. (You've probably been to an art gallery and seen one of those pictures of a beautiful face where if you look closely, it's becomes a blur, and then you see it is simply made of elementary repeating grains.) But this running program is so finely detail pixilated to a sufficient amount enough that we fallaciously presume the world we live in to be real.  Yes, welcome to the fabric of our cosmos. The distinction between the real reality and simulation is no different, they merge and are identical, and hence each individual is living in a simulation, hah right now.  (Like a movie, the acting needs to be enough to be believable.)  Not only are we lead to think our life is real, but we also assume to be the only one (aka ""uni-""verse) to exist from each individual's vantage point.  At the most fundamental level, cut down to the constituent ingredients, everything becomes vibrations and distinct packets of information with infinite numbers of simulated possibilities (parallel multi-universes).  (An analogy would be the following: like there are plenty of Hollywood movies to choose from, so are many copies of the exact you living in infinite other worlds, and all this time, you thought your life was the only story of you, as if like Tom Cruise made only 1 movie his whole career.)  BTW, in Geneva, Switzerland, the largest science experiment in the world, the large Hadron Collider (17 miles wide, and costing the US equivalent of almost $10 billion to build) is currently smashing and breaking up pealing away atoms so we can observe the fabric's behavior. Particularly in search of the elusive Higgs Boson.  Stay tuned for more discoveries.

SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
When Copernicus said the Sun was the center, the shock took centuries before man came to grips with it. 40 years ago, Armstrong first stepped on the moon the world gasped; today it's no longer a big deal. Same with new physics model explaining reality and science. Not a big deal. Everything we have discovered (and yet to) has been both in and outside the box all this time. Just knowledge, science is all about learning, aka interesting & fun. What was really cool is I've had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Greene during his public lecture and book signing at the Griffith Observatory. I may be another layman to him in passing, but as you can tell from his video, he's very down to earth and probably very good with kids. Please do share our knowledge to the future. Again, who's next at bat?

EXTRAS
I would have liked to see some extras on this blu ray (there are none). For example, 1) the interview with Dr. Greene to accommodate this program, is available only on the PBS NOVA website, and 2) The mini documentary, ""Brian Greene: The Search For Hidden Dimensions"" is on YouTube. These should have included on this blu ray. Other than that, as far as the quality of this program, you really can't ask for anything more. Programs nowadays need to compete for your attention since we are bombarded with so many distractions in life, and this one does succeed, and I have no doubt will work even for the ditzy teenager hung over from Katy's Friday night. Fabric of the Cosmos uses plenty of art, flashy graphics and designs, and media, really look advanced. BTW, though Brian Greene is the main host and is based on his book, this program does also feature a plate of renowned guest scientists including Alex Filippenko, Jim Gates, Janna Levin, Max Tegmark, and many others to get your juices flowing.

This includes discussion of Sir Isaac Newton, the father of modern science, and Albert Einstein's spacetime.  It also covers quantum mechanics and dark (unknown) energy.  Space is described as a fabric.

  Making Something from Nothing
  The Problem with Gravity
  Space at the Quantum Level
  The Expanded Universe
  Space as a Hologram

2. ""The Illusion of Time""
Mr. Greene presents the Big Bang and how it drives time forward.

  The Mystery of Time
  Einstein's Time Revolution
  Past, Present, and Future
  Time Travel and The Arrow of Time
  The Disorderly Universe

3. ""Quantum Leap""
Mr. Greene explains quantum mechanics which involve electrons and probability waves.

  Down at the Quantum Level
  Particles and Waves
  Einstein vs. Entanglement
  Future of Teleportation
  Quantum Mechanics Today

4. ""Universe or Multiverse?""
Mr. Greene expounds on the birth of the universe and plays with the theory of multiverses.  Dark energy and string theory are also discussed.

  One of Many?
  From Universe to Multiverse
  Dark Energy and the Multiverse
  Another Piece of the Puzzle
  Are We Unique?

The idea that the cosmos is like a fabric reminds me of a phrase from the writings of Isaiah, ""... and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll."" This would be familiar to Sir Isaac Newton, a noted theologian and intense student of the Bible, who wrote more on the Bible than in regard to science and math.

Seeing Bohr's electron ""orbit shifting"" visually was a breakthrough for my feeble Physics 100 level brain.  I now ""get"" quantum theory, thanks to the show combining Bohr's electron shifting with the use of bowling as a model for the famous ""double slit"" experiment.

Entanglement entangles me though.  No one seems to understand why it is possible.  But they lost me when they showed that you could make a copy of a body of molecules and rebuild them somewhere else.  I understand how you can transfer the ""data"" (we do that with FAX machines and ""serialization"" of data bits in programming all the time).  Big question (where they lost me..)..

But thankfully we have Brian Greene to feed us pablum for concepts that we intuitively know are possible in the Cosmic Drama.  For years I have been attending the Mind & Life Institute conferences (many of which have been held at Harvard & MIT) where scientists and theologians explore the nature of reality and where early conversations took place.  The Elegant Universe aggregated many of the conversation streams I have followed for two decades and was a breakthrough program experience.  Fast forward to the cusp of 2012 and The Fabric of the Cosmos, where Greene & his colleagues extend conversations began in The Elegant Universe ... this is a phenomenal must see series where Past, Present & Future collide and multiverses are the New Normal.  I grew up on Star Trek and now cell phones & G+ HangOuts are common place.

4585772,5,B0056031LE,"Brian Greene and his producers have created the most understandable view of quantum physics and the oh-so awesome, but not so natural universe. Although I haven't seen the last episode, I can honestly state that the graphics and models of the first three are the most revealing to date to understanding modern physics' view of 'existence'. To be able to actually begin to grasp some of Einstein's concepts is incredible in itself.
The model of reality that Dr. Greene and his fellow physicist paint leaves me optimistic that if we somehow survive our own primitive roots, we will be able to reach far beyond the stars and the galaxies, that the previous views of the limitations of ultimate speed limits and time and distance, are solvable puzzles that we will conquer. It makes being alive today very exciting.

I have seen 3 episodes of the ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" now. The Episode on Time is alright but not superb. The episode called ""Quantum leap"" is superb and I will definitely use it for my introductory astronomy courses. The 3rd episode on ""String theory"" is even better than the original Elegant universe.
The part about Einstein and Neil Bohr is superb. The explanation of Quantum Entanglement and then the Teleportation is surprisingly digestible. I am thinking of building a course based on the fabric of the universe series. This is a fantastic series for the curious minded people among us. I am definitely buying these DVD's even though I have seen only 3 of the episodes.",1321488000,76,805,4.840579710144928
4585776,4,B0056031LE,"In this episode, Brian Greene does a very good job explaining modern physics through illustration and example. I think at times it can be a bit misleading, but it still gets you thinking about the content and I think most people that would be interested in this type of show will enjoy it. The content gets four stars.

However, Amazon is charging for a public broadcasting episode that is available freely to everyone on pbs.org. I actually watched it there. Amazon should do the right thing and include all PBS content for free for Prime members. Most of it seems to be already. This knocks two stars of the rating.

Edit: A couple of weeks after this review, they released all of them for free. I know that some commenters disagreed with part of my review, but I'd like to think that it precipitated a change. If that is the case, thanks for listening, amazon!",1321315200,17,863,4.561290322580645

4585778,5,B0056031LE,"I was at a bar a few years ago in New Orleans and I asked my friend ""So, what is time?"" She told me what time it was but this was not what I meant of course. After I asked again, she thought about it and then said ""Are you trying to make me look stupid?"" I laughed and said genuinely, ""No! I think it's a very fascinating question. Haven't you ever thought about this?"" She looked at me and shrugged.

But I am so glad Brian Greene has tackled this very interesting and complex question that would make even the most accomplished physicist feel, well, a little insecure.

This is the second episode in the series entitled ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" which is based on the book of the same name. In this episode, Brian once again takes an exceedingly complicated topic and tries to let the viewer see this question from tangible experiences of our world. He begins by showing us the historical references that led to the modern synchronization of time pieces which then leads to the really difficult question of ""what exactly is time?"" We know how to measure it but what exactly is it?

From Newtonian physics to Einstein to modern theoretical physics Brian and colleagues take us step by step through the nature of space-time itself and how motion (or velocity) affects our human perception of time. Cleverly done with stunning computer generated graphics, it allows the non-physicist to grasp important concepts that leave the viewer wondering about their own past, present, and future. Is the future predetermined? Can we go back in time and change events? Do the current laws of physics allow us to theoretically do these things? And how will the universe itself look hundreds of billions of years form now if it is indeed expanding....over time?

Fun stuff and great viewing for adults and the high school student who wants to truly have their mind stimulated.

Once again, thank you Brian Greene, colleagues, and PBS for such a thought provoking series.",1320969600,7,1957,4.7105263157894735
