840931,3,6304311834,"D3 lacks Coach Bombay for most of the movie.  The private school setting isn't the best, and there are other problems as well.  Sometimes it seems like they're trying to hard too recapture the original by reintroducing gags from the first one, like Fulton shooting straight pucks out of the alley or the poop in the bag trick. However, if you're looking for a fairly enjoyable family movie, this fits the bill.

For me, someone who grew up in Minneapolis in the 90s it offers a special treat in the form of a lot of footage of Camp Snoopy at the mall of America, (now gone for the far inferior Nickelodeon Universe), and  many of the other locations including the arena and the parking lot where they play street hockey having personal connections the significance for me .",1468713600,3,773,4.579710144927536

841169,4,6304311834,My kids loved this movie!!!,1408924800,,27,4.6
841170,5,6304311834,"Ok let me first start off by saying that sure some of the lines were corny and some of the action was very unrealistic... but hey its a 90s Disney movie. I have always loved the Ducks trilogy ever since i can remember and this third installment was very fitting in my opinion. Sure (SPOILER) Bombay is hardly in it, and they are not even the Ducks until the end of the movie, but hey thats the point. The movie is about growing up for everybody including Coach Bombay as he moves on to take a position in the Jr. Goodwill Games. Charlie is dissatisfied with the new coach, and as stubborn as Orion is portrayed to be in the beginning he teaches the team some important lessons . . . like Defense, playing ""Two way hockey."" He takes them out of their comfort zone playing them in different positions and even stripping Charlie of his Captain status.
Absolutely love the end sequence 5 on 3 with 2 mins to go. (my two favorites were Banks and Charlie through the trilogy) Adam' save on goal and of course the winning goal by ......
Overall its a movie more about maturation and learning life lessons and I think in the end  its a main reason why Bombay is only in briefly. To grow up we have to let go of things and sometimes the people we love ...we have to move on.",1408665600,3,1265,4.24896265560166

841237,3,6304311834,It is as predictable and campy as the other movies.  My 4 & 7 year old kids liked it for the most part.  My 7 year old was bothered by the hockey action since he plays and realized that it is really unrealistic (Bash brothers - It is a penalty to charge and hit a player away from the play).,1393372800,,291,3.8333333333333335

841288,3,6304311834,"The Mighty Ducks is a great series, and this one is chalked full of decently clean humor, though some of it is not a great role-model, it is at least not profane.

There's a lot of disrespect portrayed in this movie towards family, however, Charlie does learn his lesson in the end.  I wouldn't personally use this as a family movie because it typifies what is ""cool"" for teens, and that entails a lot of disrespect towards their parents.

You may find it worth your time, but for me, this is a 1-watch movie.",1378944000,,509,4.3936170212765955
841289,3,6304311834,"Okay, first off, what the heck was with those sound effects that were clearly borrowed from Disney's cartoon library?  It's decisions like this that make me dislike sequels to children's films...because they go ""sideways"" like this""...and why this film earned a lower rating than it's predisessors.  Apart from that distracting decision, this movie did a decent job.  True, there was a major shakeup withe Ducks going to high school (had to happen sometime) where they were placed under the tutilidge of a new coach.  While a casting change like this can often break a film, this one didn't.  I think Jeffrey Nordling did a great job in bringing this new, and different, coach to life on the screen and instilling the message to the Ducks (and the viewers who haven't stopped watching because of the sound effects) that change is a part of life and must be handled properly, for which preparation is required.  I'll be the first to tell you that life does not always go the way we want (more often than not, it doesn't.)  I do wonder what would have happened if Aaron Lohr had been in the film the whole time instead of the last 15 minutes...though it did create drama.  While I have enjoyed Emilio Estevez throughout this film series, it was nice to see a new face take the helm of the Ducks, and again, Jeffrey Nordling did a fine job as his own man rather than a carbon copy of the beloved Bombay...but was that hug between him and Joshua Jackson at the end really needed?  Ultimately, this is another decent film for kids who like to see the underdogs win.  Despite the characters having grown up (a bit) during this film series, this film was the least mature of them all (I think the series went in reverse on that element) and I atribute that mainly to these wierd, annoying, and pointless sound effects.  I cannot get past that and it is the reason this film is ranked lower than the other two.  But I will say that, if you've seen the first two films and cheered the Ducks to victory, this one is worth getting to complete the collection.  And speaking of sound effects...the Mighty Ducks theme music I've come to know and love is still there, so at least someone in the sound department's got their head screwed on properly.  So, watch the Ducks as they grow up through victory, defeat, triumph, and tragedy...and the romances that blossom along the way.",1378857600,,2364,4.584323040380047

841369,5,6304311834,"Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) and his underdog hockey team are back again in this third installment to the Mighty Ducks legacy. In ""D3: Ducks Divided,"" Robert Lieberman takes a crack at reenvisioning the gang on an unforgettable scale never before attempted in a children's sports film. When the Ducks are killed in a bus accident in the Sierra Nevadas, the team finds itself suddenly split into separate factions: those Ducks who have lived a (sometimes surprisingly!) morally redeemable life, and those who have failed the grade due to particular unforgivable behaviors. Gordon and the righteous Ducks suddenly find themselves at the gates of a Paradise ruled by figure-skating angels and referees, but Heidi Kling and the other damned are thrown, after rewitnessing their transgressions, into the ice-melting wastelands of Hockey Hell. Here they meet the sympathetic Lucifer (Dustin Hoffman), who convinces them one by one to realign themselves in his own plan to take back Heaven full-force. Tensions rise as both teams prepare for the thrilling and climactic showdown, facing such difficulties as lacking a substitute goalie or receiving an injury. Excellent repeat performance by Josef Sommer (aka Mr. Gerald Ducksworth)!",1314230400,,1228,5.43455497382199

841373,2,6304311834,"Now I am as big a fan of the first two Might Ducks movies as anybody else, they are classics I grew up watching over and over, and until recently I couldn't remember much of D3. Sadly now, I can't seem to forget it.

The cast is noticeably older, I mean really I don't think anyone can believe Aaron Lohr or Elden Henson (better known as the bash brothers) could pass for freshmen in high school. Emilio Estevez is absent from most of the film, seeing as how Bombay is no longer the coach of the ducks, and they have all received full scholarships to a prep school, that Bombay had once attended,  under a strict new coach. Of course Charlie(Joshua Jackson) being so close to Coach Bombay has a huge problem with this new coach, which deepens when he is no longer the captain of the team, and his teenage angst becomes increasingly unappealing and uncharacteristic.

Although there are some high points to the film, my favorite being Dean Portman(Aaron Lohr) and his penalty box striptease; overall this film is hard to sit through, filled completely with old jokes, and recycled scenarios. For some reason Luis has forgotten how to stop again, the cowboy is still roping people on the ice... even during games(which I'm pretty positive wouldn't fly) and I could almost swear Bombay gives Charlie the same exact speech that is given to him in D2.

I also find it hilarious that Scott Whyte appeared as Gunnar from team Iceland in D2, and in D3 he is Scott, the varsity team goalie who has a crush on Julie. I always knew he looked familiar.

The film had potential, but compared to the previous installments in their glory, D3 is a waste.

I will admit I appreciate the appearance by Paul Kariya.",1222646400,3,1696,4.5625

Not only do the Mighty Ducks now have to prove their worth to a school filled with snotty rich kids, but must face the varsity hockey team waiting to destroy their reputation.

`D3: The Mighty Ducks' released in '96 is a case of going to the pond, I mean well, once to often. It's not neccessarily a bad movie, it's simply a case of nothing new to offer after the first two movies.  The on and off the ice antics are old and tired and the youthful energy of the cast is definitely running on empty. It's time to hang up that jersey and move on.",1152230400,,696,4.387596899224806

Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?!

But there are a couple of changes for the Mighty Ducks, even for Charlie (Joshua Jackson), who acts like he did in the first movie. The movie begins with short clips from the first two movies, and most of the Mighty Ducks has now entered high school and now are playing hockey for Elden Hall. But the big change is that Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) will not be coaching the Mighty Ducks that are now the school's junior varsity team, because the junior goodwill games has named him director of player personal. And the new coach is Ted Orion (Jeffrey Nordling) who will not let them do anything they done turning childhood. When a girl asks Charlie to sign a pention to changed the Warrior name, Charlie names the following teams, the Indians, the Braves, the Redskins, and the Blackhawks. But more trouble happens, when Orion posts the postions the players will play, moving Banks to varsity team, and making Julie (Colombe Jacobson) the head goalie and making Goldberg back up and Goldebrg complains ""What am I, chopped liver?"". So he gives her junk food, and she gets sick during pratice, and coach orion says ""Julie the cat! What's the Matter, you ate a fur ball?"". During the first two peroids of the first game, Charlie and the other Warriors score a lot of goals on the thier foe and makes Julie bored, so she starts complain ""Come on guys, give me sommething to do"". And even sings ""Fulton scored, Fulton scores, I am really bored, Fulton's great, Fulton's great, a year ago he couldn't even skate"", after Fulton scores a goal.

841407,4,6304311834,"The Mighty Ducks.  Perhaps the best live-action series that has been put out by Disney to date.  In this, the third movie in the series we see the Ducks receive scholarships to the prestigious Eden Hall Academy.  At the same time, Coach Bombay has decided to move on and will be partaking in the Goodwill Games.  In going to Eden Hall, the team acquires a new coach who is not as pleasant as Coach Bombay was.  In fact, he could be best described as a nightmare.  At the same time the Ducks bump heads with the championship varsity team.  In the end the two square off in an excellent game of hockey.  Leading up to the game, many of the typical hyjinks take place.  Aside from the Ducks having their scholarhips on the line and other set-backs, the exchange of pranks between the two teams is simply classic.  In the climatic third-period of the game the Ducks will have to prove why they are that quack-tastic.  Will they do it??  I can't say, but D3 is a movie you don't want to miss.  Disney has done it again with another great movie that anyone in the family can enjoy, so pick up today as you won't be disappointed.",1037923200,10,1122,4.336538461538462

841409,5,6304311834,"First off, I must say this, I've never seen the first two Mighty Ducks movies and I'm not especially a hockey lover. But I must confess I thought this movie was terrific and fun! Mostly aimed for teenagers, this is a great movie to watch!
The whole team ""Mighty Ducks"" have won scholarships to prestigious Eden Hall: Charlie (Joshua Jackson), Goldberg (Shaun Weiss), Fulton (Elden Henson), Averman (Matt Doherty), Julie 'the Cat' (Colombe Jacobsen-Derstine), Russ (Kenan Thompson), Dwayne (Ty O'Neal), Luis (Mike Vitar), Ken (Justin Wong), Guy Germaine (Garette Ratliff Henson), Connie (Marguerite Moreau), and Adam (Vincent Larusso). But there are some changes for the team. First of all, one of the 'Basher Brothers' Dean Portman (Aaron Lohr) is not going to join them. But most important, their coach Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) won't be coaching them anymore. Charlie can't accept that and even more can't accept their seemingly harsh new coach, Ted Orion (Jeffrey Nordling). The 'Mighty Ducks' have a big game ahead of them against the Varsity team 'Warriors' who are going to be hard to beat. Will they be able to beat them and show them who's the best?
With plenty of suspense and humor, ""D3: The Mighty Ducks"" is certainly worth the watch. Terrific acting done by the whole cast, including the notable actor Joss Ackland who plays Hans, the good friend and mentor to the 'Ducks'. The suspense during the hockey games were sometimes pretty intense, especially the last game between the 'Ducks' and the 'Warriors'. As for the humor, the movie was hilarious, I was laughing most of the time!
A few of my favorites parts are when the 'Ducks' play pranks on the Varsity team and when Bombay gives his little 'speech' to the board members of Eden Hall. And a few of my favorite lines is:
Cheerleader: Cheerleaders only. Are you a cheerleader?
Linda: Do I look like an idiot?
Connie: This ninja stuff makes you look, I don't know, how would you say...
Guy Germaine: Ruggedly handsome?
Connie: Amazingly stupid.
Dwayne (while swinging a lariat at one of the Varsity members): It would be more fun for me if you ran.
For parents, the movie is rated PG for the reason that there are some bad words sprinkled here and there. Other than that and the game of hockey being pretty rough, it's pretty good! I can't wait to watch the first two movies! I hope they're as good as the third one! If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend it!",1010707200,8,2441,4.786729857819905
841410,5,6304311834,"i think that this has to be the best episode within the Mighty Ducks Triology!!!! The reason why i prefer this episode to the others is because there is more, faster hockey actually being played!!
The kids in the movies are just has funny, but they are just that little bit older, plus Germaine is much more cuter!!
but has anyone noticed that on Fulton Reed's Hockey Jersey, he has his name 'FULTON' on the back off his shirt rather than 'REED' which is his sirname, whereas others have their sirnames. Just wandering....",989884800,,522,4.623655913978495

I make my friends watch it with me, and they all love  it.  The only thing I found disturbing here, was that Joshua Jackson was  again the big star, I think more charachters like Gee Germaine and Adam  Banks should be in the spotlight more.  I must say, there is not one girl  that doesn't like a certain someone's stripping scence in the penalty box!
