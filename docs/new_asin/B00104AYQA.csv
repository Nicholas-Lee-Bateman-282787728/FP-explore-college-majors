3046081,3,B00104AYQA,"This is an OK movie, not a great movie. Considering the star power one might have expected better but it's not a bad movie, just not a great movie.
Frances Langford is a stunningly attractive woman and gives an excellent performance.
This is the first time I've seen Ozzie Nelson outside of Ozzie and Harriet and he wasn't as good here as he was in O&H though it was fun watching him outside that familiar role.
Jack Haley from Wizard of Oz fame plays his role nicely as does Rudy Valle. Both big stars from the era.
Art Linkletter doesn't show up until about the 60 minute mark of the movie. As the package blurb says Linkletter plays himself.
Overall not bad. The movie is very difficult to watch because of the poor transfer; the storyline is slow moving but overll enjoyable.",1333324800,4,779,4.492957746478873
3046082,1,B00104AYQA,"Who in the world does your movie write ups.  It is obvious that they have never seen this turkey.  It is one of those incredibly cheap films churned out in the 1940s to cash in on the popularity of radio at the time.  I am a movie buff, and have literally hundreds and hundreds of DVDs in my personal collection.  I had never heard of this flick until I purchased a set called ""50 Classic Musicals"".  To say it is among the top 100 movies of all time, means to me that the person writing those words had no integrity.  It reminds me of something handed in in high school by a student in grade 9 who used only his imagination and did not do any work.  I would check on this employee.  He is not doing his job!",1252800000,5,708,4.043165467625899

8236951,1,B00104AYQA,Booo!!! I was so excited to see whether they found the house!!! Why did you only put up one episode??!?!,1515542400,,104,4.25
8236952,1,B00104AYQA,I am really disappointed with your stunt. Must we find the house to find the missing episodes. One show does not a season make.,1514160000,,127,4.333333333333333
8236953,1,B00104AYQA,"offered first season, got hooked on house couple, epi 2 where is it? how many more times are we going to get offers from Prime for the season of the program and only get I episode Be truthful and explain that you are getting really p  d",1514160000,,236,4.0212765957446805
8236954,5,B00104AYQA,I was really enjoying the show then found out that episode 2 was not available  =(  Boo and shame on you!!!  This was a total teaser with a flat tire at the end. Not happy with you at all,1513641600,,187,3.7435897435897436
8236955,5,B00104AYQA,"Would love it even more if I could see episode 2. Would be nice to know if they got their house, & if that poor fellow ever made enough money for that chic he liked?",1513209600,,165,3.742857142857143
8236956,1,B00104AYQA,It is rather ridiculous to show episode 1 without having the concluding episode 2 available.,1512259200,,92,5.2
8236957,1,B00104AYQA,"One episode, fine. But this episode has a cliff-hanger! Did the Hunter's ever find their house? Did they win the Midland house? I had no luck googling the answer either. :(",1510963200,4,172,4.580645161290323
8236958,3,B00104AYQA,This 1955 tv show was way before my time. I enjoyed watching it on Amazon Prime and would watch more episodes if they added some to Prime. Thanks for making it available.,1509840000,2,170,4.34375
8236959,1,B00104AYQA,Totally Deceptive by offering a series but only delivering 1 episode.  Dissatisfied with this choice.  Like the show not the false description.,1497312000,7,143,5.454545454545454
8236960,1,B00104AYQA,"one episode not a series, its a hgorrbie joke about stealing someones house andcar, and to boot you neer find out if they get their house back,",1482710400,5,143,4.333333333333333
