8623220,5,B00GHJ3MUS,"My husband just watched the move on Daystar television network and he is running to Amazon to buy it. It was a God sent confirmation for him because although he is disable he wants to run ""walk"" the  5k in downtown and he  was getting discourage lately because of his physical condition.. but then the movie lines where filled with words from God. The movie talks about running the 5k in downtown and that was exactly what my husband has been trying to do...It was a confirmation from God. This movie is super awesome....! Planning to watch it next time with all the family.

8623222,5,B00GHJ3MUS,well done and believable.  excellent but natural teaching opportunities with the grandson.  Good acting.  Our 15 year old daughter enjoyed it as well.,1397520000,3,150,5.434782608695652
8623223,5,B00GHJ3MUS,"This is a good movie! ""Gramps"" has long prayed for his estranged daughter. One day he gets a phone call. She has financial problems and needs money. Gramps helps her financially and moves in to help with the kids, without telling the kids why he's there.
Gramps has admirable qualities that warms the relationship with his grandson in particular. There are a lot of great moments in this movie. I have lent my copy to a number of friends, and everyone came back saying they liked it. Worth buying and worth watching!",1393891200,5,516,4.619565217391305
8623224,4,B00GHJ3MUS,"I wrote the screenplay and played Gramps in the movie, which I also produced.  So my view should be taken with a grain of salt perhaps, or maybe the entire salt shaker. I am not going to critique my own film but rather wanted to share some of the reactions I got from people at the theater. The three major target audiences for this movie were  parents, grandparents, and teenagers.  Never did I dream this would be embraced by young kids. The most salient testimony came from an eight-year-old boy. He watched it at the theater in the afternoon, went back home and watched it twice more before he went to bed. I've never heard of such a thing. In another case, a grandfather wept because he received confirmation through this film that he was supposed to adopt his own grandson and raise him. I must have done something right - or perhaps better said - God did it through me. The production quality of this film is certainly not going to match up with a Hollywood blockbuster. The budget for this movie was less than the coffee budget for a major motion picture. But a couple of messages that need to be heard are contained within the framework of this movie.  My advice to you is to not buy this film unless you want something that educates at the same time it entertains. The plot is certainly not some rehashing of a formulaic script.  I only give it 4 stars because of my bias.",1393891200,4,1382,4.403921568627451
