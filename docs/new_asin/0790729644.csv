100910,5,0790729644,"This film deserved every Oscar it received (a rare occurrence) and will certainly be remembered as one of the decade's finest pictures.  Clint plays up his age and delivers a stark message on the prevalence and spread  of violence in our world.  Will Munny learns that some people are killers  at heart, and they can never escape from it.  Chilling and emotionally  devastating.  Clint and Gene Hackman give two of the best performances of  their extremely distinguished careers.",922233600,,479,5.051282051282051
100911,1,0790729644,"I bought this film expecting to watch an  exciting and a full action-packed story, and besides being a movie acted and directed by Mr Clint Eastwood, I said, this must be the best Westen movie ever made, but,  It was boring, Eastwood's character was weak and unappalling, and I had to  expend the whole Sunday afternoon watching this. There are much better  mexican westerns. The only actor that keeps afloat the movie is Gene  Hackman. I recommend you instead:  ""The Magnificent Seven "", for  me, this is the best Western ever made.",916012800,4,533,4.728260869565218
100912,5,0790729644,Despite the cruel violence you can feel the dirt under your nails in the beginning. While it is hard to have much moral sympathy for Eastwood's character he is after all dealing with the ultimate bad guys. I have this  movie on VHS and Laser Disc and am now ordering it on DVD. I consider this  the Das BOOT of westerns,915321600,,319,4.213114754098361
100913,5,0790729644,"""Unforgiven"" is a masterpiece, the achievement of Eastwood's career as director. I doubt anyone can direct a real western after this one. The whole american mythology created around the 1830-1890 period is  visited by Eastwood and exorcised. Heroes are no more than lousy  story-tellers, gunfighters must have glasses to shoot right and there  aren't good guys and bad guys anymore : there are only human beings like  you and me who kill for money or revenge. If the hero does survive in a  fight, it's only because he's lucky and not because he's the good one.  Eastwood created a crepuscular world much more impressive than Robert  Altman's movie about Buffalo Bill (with Paul Newman). If you should have  only one western in your DVD collection, buy ""Unforgiven"". And,  of course, the others Eastwood's movies as well !",914457600,3,822,4.9416058394160585
100914,5,0790729644,"Eastwood after decades in the business still has staying power in the business. With a strong supporting cast of heavy weights and new talent, Clint Eastwood demonstrates that substance is still in style. Eastwood  plays the part of William Munny to perfection. The last ten minutes of this  movies lines have ""classic"" written all over it.",914284800,,340,5.053571428571429
100915,5,0790729644,"This may be the best western ever made. It captures the cowboy spirit like nothing since ""Lonesome Dave."" The ""new"" Clint Eastwood (introspective, mortal, even compassionate) is making great movies, and this is one of the best.  END",896745600,,232,5.105263157894737
100916,5,0790729644,"This is a brutal, believable tale that at the same time is deeply moral, in a way that no melodrama can be.  It's about a temporarily reformed mad-dog killer who's tempted off the straight and narrow.  Some prostitutes have offered a bounty for the deaths of two cowboys who mutilated one of their number.
When people are beaten or killed in this movie, it has meaning.  Justice doesn't triumph, because that's not what this world offers.  For me, it's not nihilism but it's opposite that prompts this exchange between the apprentice killer and Clint Eastwood's character:
""I guess he had it coming."" ""We all got it coming, kid.""
The movie is a little slow to get rolling, and I don't quite believe some of the scenes of Clint as a sod-buster.  But when we see characters flinch at killing because they lack the nerve, we really understand what makes it possible for a cold-blooded sociopath- on either side of the law- to face down a crowd.  That makes it feel real, and the third act of the movie is the culmination of Clint Eastwood's career in westerns.  END",896140800,,1062,4.617021276595745

101061,3,0790729644,"It looks great. Costume, scenery, music, dialogue, etc look like a classic western, and the slow, steady pace feels thoughtful and patient, hearkening back to Eastwood's earlier work with Leone. Believable performances and decent effects make for a movie that is pleasant to watch. The characters make decisions that are questionable, making their motivations foggy and unclear. The dynamic changes in the characters make sense, but come from circumstances that lack both the suspense and the light-footed resourcefulness that comes with cowboys. Overall, this movie is worth your time if you're into westerns, but otherwise there are better examples of the genre, especially those starring the same man.",1513296000,,704,5.527777777777778

101087,4,0790729644,Good Flick!,1509840000,,11,5.0
101088,5,0790729644,"Unforgiven is the best western movie I have ever seen.  It rings true shot for shot, scene for scene.  I love just about everything in this film.  The hero is sometimes the villain Sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman) and the villain is sometimes the hero William Money (Clint Eastwood) depending on your point of view.

The characters are so rich and deep.  Little Bill maybe the big boss man sheriff but he is a horrible carpenter.  The same can be said of William Money being a terrible hog farmer, but also an outlaw to be feared.  Some things in life god intended for us to do more than others.  Even hired guns like English Bob have their faults lying to his own biographer to make himself look better.  The movie is full of characters with realistic human faults which makes the movie so believable.

You sympathize with the whores in this film who are treated as little more than meat.  When some drunken cowboy carves up the face of a young girl, for a tiny slight.  No justice was done and the poor girl received nothing while the tavern owner received all the compensation which was horses in this case.

The movie is unflinching in its brutality and authenticity of how the west really was.  This is the first film in ages to depicted what it is like to kill a man.  It is not something glorious that you see in the standard action movies but something you have to live with.  When William Money tells his young outlaw partner its a hell of thing killing a man you believe it down to your core.

Yet even deep down with all Wills faults he does right by his partners and ends up being a just human being and a good father to his children.  His story is one of sadness but also redemption and a hope that one day he will find salvation.

This isn't your modern day country music theme of celebrating the almighty pickup truck, being true to your first love, your dog and lovin your mumma.  Far from it.  There were brothels and whore houses.  Cowboys were more ruffian and scoundrels than good Christian folk. Life wasn't easy for anyone on the frontier.

Clint Eastwoods acting and directing are superb in this film.  Whenever I hear a list of top 10 movies of all time if this movie isn't on the list then it is hogwash.  I have seen the movie well over 20 times and yet when I see it on TV no matter where it is at in the movie I stop to finish watching the film.  That is the sign of a great movie.

This is a 5 star movie and probably the best western ever made.  This is one of those rare movies where the casting seems perfect for every character.  The final shootout is gripping and it glues you to the screen.",1509408000,,2627,4.3040816326530615

101091,5,0790729644,"Well, being a Clint Eastwood fan, once I learned this was coming out, I had to get it. Not only for the fact that it was a 4K, although a WB 4K, which may not be the best out there on the market, it had a ""Remastered"" Blu-ray. THAT is what I wanted to see for the most part and to compare it with the other Blu-ray released before. I found that to be superior to the original Blu-ray that has been out.
The 4K disc itself, well, little difference between it and the ""Remastered"" Blu-ray in package. Still, 5 stars from me for the movie and the newer Blu-ray version over the older one.

101115,2,0790729644,"We love nearly every single movie Clint Eastwood has ever made and have an extensive collection of Blu rays of his.

The movie gets 5/5 - the problem with this 4K UHD transfer is that it was most likely color graded using an LCD monitor rather than an OLED. The Unforgiven 4K UHD black levels (viewed on our LG OLED65B6P) are SO DARK that you can barely make out the characters faces in the nighttime saloon scenes, both at the beginning of the movie and especially the ending at night, in the rain. The daytime scenes, in contrast, are eye-poppingly wonderous! Our home theater monitor has been professionally set up.

ALL of our other 4K UHD content played back on our Panasonic DMP-UB900 (we currently have 34 4K UHD movies ) have been flawless and are properly color graded with rich black levels with the exception of Mad Max Fury Road 4K UHD  where the flames look like they're colored in by Disney cartoon artists.

Obviously (and sadly) Mr. Eastwood does not care about his heritage as a film maker as compared to almost all other film makers who CARE to be involved and actively participate in the telecine process. I guess Mr. Eastwood (along with Mr. Tarantino) figures his movies will always be available on the 'big screen' which, of course, is not true. Even the American Sniper Blu ray has some aliasing and banding in the sequence of the big shootout on the rooftops in the sand storm.

Scorsese, the Coens, Ridley Scott, Joss Whedon etc etc etc ALL care to participate in the telecine process because they realize that THAT will be their legacy, either Blu ray or, better yet, 4K UHD. Clint Eastwood has given short 'interviews' for various films but he chooses NOT to participate in how his LEGACY will be portrayed in Blu ray & 4K UHD. Very disappointing but, we can hope for a 'non rushed out for the 25th Anniversary' edition sometime soon to correct these incredibly inaccurate black levels in this 4K UHD release.

I believe that most critical reviews that praise the 4K UHD transfer are all watching on LCD monitors of some type, not OLED (which costs quite a bit more). But, if you don't believe me, just go to LG's OLED website and watch the video of Francis Ford Copolla gushing over OLED's superiority and how he wants his legacy to be on OLED technology.

Here's more from a CNET review of the LG OLED65B6P:
'Where LCD relies on a backlight shining through a liquid crystal panel to create the picture, with OLED and plasma, each individual sub-pixel is responsible for creating illumination. That's why OLED and plasma are known as ""emissive"" and LED LCD as ""transmissive"" displays, and a big reason why OLED's picture quality is so good.'

Back to Local Dimming Zones... OLEDs are 4K UHD capable (as are LED LCDs) but there is a major difference when it comes to 'local dimming zones' - each pixel (all 8,294,400 of them in an OLED) are individually addressed as 'dimming zones' which results in better color depth, black levels, shadows and all the other aspects that a cinephile (who cares only about hard media) demands (remembering that most LCD's have around 72 local dimming zones).

All modern telecines should be graded using OLED and, for the most part, I think they are. I believe that Warner Brothers rushed this 4K UHD out to cash in on the 25th Anniversary. Hopefully, sometime, they'll revisit this incredible movie and DO IT RIGHT!

To end, I know I'll get a lot of badmouth from the TV/Streaming LCD folks who will take personal offense to this review... I NEVER look at my reviews again after I post them.

Don't be disappointed when it doesn't look like ""Passengers"".  What I don't understand is, with that said, to this day, this is still the most expensive mainstream 4K movie out there. Need to justify that when its looks and sounds very close to the standard blu-ray edition. The movie itself still gets 5 stars, but all of my lunch money??

101162,5,0790729644,"It's just so dang good. I like a lot of Eastwood's stuff, but in my opinion, none of it compares to Unforgiven. I'm blown away by the few negative reviews I see on here where people are talking about the unredeemable violence. I suppose if you don't pay attention to anything any of the central characters say during the film it could seem that way, but Unforgiven isn't just people in hats killing each other and acting tough. It's a movie about the damage that violence does to people, not just the people that are killed and hurt physically, but also to the people perpetrating the violence. The toughest person in this film has nothing but misery to show for his years of being a tough guy. The lead character is a broken person because of the awful things he did when he was young. This isn't some silly oater where six-shooters hold 50 bullets and the lead man is some macho fantasy-fulfillment that people will wish they could be. The director has a huge list of those movies to hsi credit if that's what you're in the mood for. (Not that there is anything wrong with that).

Seriously though, just watch it. Even if you don't feel great at the end of the movie, it's a moving experience that will stick with you for a while.",1494892800,,1232,4.427312775330397

101178,1,0790729644,"I love Clint Eastwood cowboy movies but this one I found pretty stupid.  For one thing, Eastwood's character, William Munny, is a widower with two small children, living in the middle of nowhere not even being able to ride again without several attempts, decides to leave the two youngsters alone with no adult supervision on a trip that could get him killed.  This is especially true since he had been away from his gun fighting days for over 10 years.  Completely unrealistic!  The movie would have been better if they had a sheriff putting him in jail for child abandonment. (Just being sarcastic.)",1491868800,,601,4.805825242718447

101180,5,0790729644,"When I saw this film, in the theater, although it was a tale with neither heroes nor complete villains in which everyone operated and made their individual moves under the guise of heavy rationalization, I was stunned by how purposefully the genre was being brought down to earth, from Eastwood's initial presentation as a struggling pig farmer who has left alcohol addiction, at least at the movie's start, in the rear-view mirror, only to find himself raising children alone in an unforgiving environment, to the ease with which the dubious ""Scholfield Kid,"" an obvious ""pretender to the throne,"" next to Eastwood's experienced man of violence lures Eastwood in this one last dance.

As bounty hunters descend upon the town, under somewhat false claims, no matter how seemingly justified, if exaggerated, from ""English Bob,"" to Eastwood himself, we discover how cruel and merciless Hackman's morally undercut sheriff is, and even the rule of law as quickly exiled as a moral good. In the theater, when Eastwood is told of the fate of his friend, essayed by Morgan Freeman, now whipped like a slave, beaten to death, and hung on the porch of the saloon-come-whorehouse where the entire spectacle began as two callow cow-hands cut a woman's face, we see Eastwood take drink after drink, and his eyes change.

The coming climax when Eastwood intends to kill everyone in the room, despite his frequent assertions that he has changed, sent a ripple through the theater, as hollow laughter and applause set the audience up to enter their particular mode of redemptive violence, but very little redemption occurs. Eastwood's eyes gleam as he kills Hackman's sheriff right as the man said in true Fordian (John Ford) fashion, ""I don't deserve this; I was building a house.""

Eastwood replies with a blunt, terse, nearly Calvinist sentiment, ""Deserve's got nothin' to do with it,"" before blowing that man away.

In the stunning denouement, a writer, the sort who made terrorists, such as Jesse James (read T. J. Stiles biography, ""The Last Rebel,"" if that description strikes your ear wrong for the outlaw waging a one-man-war on the northern establishment of trains and banks, without giving any money to the poor as is so often wrongly claimed), into false dime novel heroes. In the end, Eastwood suffers greatly. His final scene, in which he cleans house, has been referred to as the greatest example of an actor directing himself since Orson Welles in ""Chimes at Midnight,"" or Chaplin in ""City Lights.""

The performances are quite near perfect. Eastwood receives his first acting and directing Oscar nod. Soon ""Mystic River,"" ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Memoirs from Iwo Jima,"" and an artist remade will follow. This is classic cinema.",1490227200,,2727,5.051111111111111

Eastwood, he of the minimalist-sneer school of acting, brings off the alcoholic gunfighter with sociopathic coldness.

101393,5,0790729644,"I remember Roger Ebert saying this movie was a sort of eulogy to the western. There is a bit of that, where Clint Eastwood isn't as good of a shot and hast trouble rustling his pigs.

Theres a were getting the band back together mentality when he rustles up his old friend for one last hurrah. This movie doesnt move as fast as other westerns, taking time to develop characters like the reporter, Saul Rubinek and English Bob are well developed. Maybe because the filmmakers main thrust is to give us a well developed villain in Gene Hackman.

Both men seem a bit real for westerns. Clint Eastwood isn't perfect, and says very un-cowboy things like how his wife cured him of wickedness. Although he supposedly was a stone killer back in his day, he utters this line several times like a schoolboy whos a little slow.
And although Hackman is an evil sheriff, its interesting how his pastime is building a retirement cabin for himself which he is proud to show to the reporter.

All of this is a set up though for the great confrontation when Eastwoods character comes to full fruition as a stone killer.  I loved that shot of the whiskey bottle tossed on the ground in the rain. When Eastwood appears in the bar at the end, he is the grim reaper and we know that Eastwood, the quintessential Hollywood cowboy has one last shootout in him and this is the one that will trump the other legends.",1470441600,,1391,4.486166007905139

101396,3,0790729644,"Men go to war over a cut-up whore. Thats the gist of a plot thats about as silly as it sounds, especially at the end when a previously decrepit character suddenly becomes invincible. Unforgiven is a movie produced by, directed by, and starring Clint Eastwood, so more power to him. He plays a cold-blooded assassin named William Munny recruited by a caricatural Kid to help him kill the cowboy who cut-up the aforementioned whore. But the story lacks in the way of tension, which such a concept needs in order to be effective, and often goes astray.

Clint and Morgan Freeman are so good together onscreen that you wonder why they didn't do more. Gene Hackman kills it, Anna Levine is great, and Dumbledore is awesome.

I'd imagine that to appreciate Unforgiven, you'd actually have to be fan of this sort of thing and not just of movies in general. This is Western that is done in the classic style. If you know what you're getting into here then you are in for a treat.

Clearly deserving of a full five star rating. I do have a few gripes though. First is that the character English Bob could've been worked into the story a little more. Seemed a little unnecessary to have him enter and then leave like that. Overall it's a good movie with great performances from Eastwood and Hackman. Richard Harris and the younger guy who played the kid were both good as well. Morgan Freeman seemed to be phoning it in though.",1457740800,,856,4.417721518987341

The more I learn the more I learn how much I don't know. As for film, I believe that this film would have not been allowed to be made during the Hayes Code years (duh) and even up through the eighties. I was blown away by this film that I waited years to see but it was worth the wait. The ending was so nontraditional for reasons that will spoil this film for you if you have not viewed it yet. Morgan Freeman did just as well a job as Gene Hackman in my opinion and that's a shame since he had to feel slighted. I loved the commentary also.

101615,5,0790729644,"Unforgiven is a Western film produced and directed by Clint Eastwood. The film tells the story of William Munny, an aging outlaw and killer who takes on one more job years after he had hung up his guns and turned to farming. A dark Western that deals frankly with the uglier aspects of violence and the myth of the Old West. The film stars Eastwood in the lead role, together with Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, and Richard Harris.

The movie breaks from traditional westerns wherein the characters are blurring the lines between heroism and villainy as well as man and myth. It overturns conventions, taking the man who is typically the hero and making him the villain, while transforming the traditional bad guy into a sympathetic protagonist. Aside from that,it was a compelling study of the shame and guilt that attends violence, of the rule of the mighty over the weak and of courage and cowardice which has been what Western movies are all about. In summary,the movie plays a moral balance and it deplores violence. Personally,it tries to break away and established what Western movies should have been all about. But nevertheless,the movie remains a classic entertainment. All did great in expressing the complexities of their characters that borders in between good and evil. In summary,this film is simply a winner and a masterpiece.",1451174400,,1341,4.96

101692,5,0790729644,"A dark tale of repentance, redemption, and ultimately damnation.  Eastwood guides us into seemingly contradictory feelings, a sort of cognitive dissonance between sympathy and unease with the actions of the main character.  On the one hand, we sympathize with Munny, the once great gunslinger who was now a dirt poor pig farmer who just wanted one more big job to secure a future for his two children.  But at the same time, we realize that his motives cannot be so pure.  He is knowingly betraying his wife's guidance to be a good man, and walking back on his own redemption and forgiveness.  Forgiven by society, by his wife, even by himself (to a point), and ultimately by God, he tosses it away and becomes the vicious killer he once was, all the while trying to rationalize and deny it.  As the story progresses, it becomes clear that Munny is not driven so much by noble motives; as Ned and the kid fall away after understanding they are not cold blooded killers and want nothing of this life, for Will it brings back his former glory... the old man wakes and the new is cast aside as he rejects redemption and accepts damnation in its stead.  Outstanding movie, in every way.",1448755200,,1182,4.6

101822,5,0790729644,"Clint Eastwood is, has been, and will always be, one of the coolest actors ever! First, He was the coolest cowboy, back in the day. A decade later, he was the coolest detective (Dirty Harry). For a few years, he beat people up with his pet monkey, maybe not the high point of his career, but I love those 2 movies. But not till Unforgiven, did we realize that he is an excellent actor, and he's proven that since. This is an incredible movie! Not a typical western (tell your lady that, maybe she'll watch too) incredible acting, incredible writing, incredible movie, Watch It!",1446940800,,577,4.5576923076923075
101823,5,0790729644,One of my favorite westerns,1446940800,,27,4.6
101824,5,0790729644,"I make it a habit to re-watch the ""Unforgiven"" around once a year for the purpose of rekindling my ability to ""smell"" the rain. Eastwood has always had the ability to generate strong emotional links between the story being played out on the screen and the individual members of the audience and I have been a fan of his acting and directorial efforts throughout his career. But, his work in the ""Unforgiven"" transcends all! I attribute it all to his ability to make me ""smell"" the rain throughout the piece.

I use four criteria in rating all movies that I view; Writing (original and screenplay), Production Values, Acting and Directing.

The writing, production and directing treatments of the ""Unforgiven"" portray a reality that is normally missed in all films as the writers and directors attempt to give the audience the story's messages. In the ""Unforgiven"", the audience is drawn into the story to such an extent that individual scenes flow, one to the next, in a seamless movement, almost rhapsodic in nature, with the environment of the story creating a similarly seamless backdrop. Therein lies the ability for the audience to ""smell"" the rain. The story line and directing make extensive use of rain as a mechanism to create a closness in nearly each scene that is palpable, hence being able to actually ""smell"" the rain along with many of the scents of the old west. Truly magnificently done!

But, it is the acting by William Munny (Eastwood) that keeps drawing me back to the film to refresh the human aspect of the overall story. The ""Duck of Death"", the dime novel writer, little Bill, the ""cut-up"" whore, the horse that resists mounting, a near-sighted gunman all contribute their piece to the story and the film but it is William Munny that the story unfolds around. Eastwood provides one of his most graphic role portrayals of his great career and no one in the audience doubts that Munny's threat to come back and kill everyone in the town would not actually happen if the townspeople do not comply with his final demands.

Best Picture Oscar along with Best Director Oscar were well deserved!! I would have given Eastwood the Best Actor Award as well!

Go invole yourself in the ""Unforgiven"" and relish in your own ability to ""smell"" the rain!!",1446940800,,2265,4.797435897435897

101849,4,0790729644,"Not your typical Clint Eastwood western. You will find the usual cowboys, shooting, muddy streets and even a lively brothel just outside of town. In addition though what you will find is a sincere struggle with their sense identity in all the major characters. It is this struggle that drives the film. Even the desolate landscape speaks to the struggle. Directed by Clint Eastwood, it is in my opinion one of his best efforts. I think you will enjoy it.",1446681600,2,454,4.6875

The emotions and alcohol are always a bad mix whatever the time period though so it is not hard to imagine how challenging it was to live back then in that part of the world. Standing up for friends regardless of the risks can be a daunting business but Mr Eastwood seems to know how to pull it off. I am an older person so I can relate to the times better than most but still it isn't easy to imagine that there were many who could do those kind of things and live to tell about it. So, in the belief that we are seeing the film from a viewer's position as opposed to actually living in the time period, I believe something of that nature could have actually happened.",1445904000,2,872,4.075581395348837

Little Bill, great name, the Hackman character is an almost entirely, but not completely, bad good guy. And the nasty little myopic killer turns out to be a human being after all and vows to never kill anyone again. The cowboys were cowboys, what can you say?  And the whores are the chorus and entirely good.  All the women are good.  Eastwood's late wife, clearly a saint, and the native american wife of Ned, the Freeman character, clearly long-suffering, patient and stalwart. And the children are all above average.  Big Whiskey could be Lake Woebegone,  but way rougher.  I just realized that I forgot English Bob, a totally bad bad guy.  So there goes my premise.

The story dragged on and on and was just not that entertaining. Sometimes great actors can't make a bad film less bad.,1445472000,,342,4.119402985074627

The story takes William Munny( Clint Eastwood), a converted by his wife drunken gunslinger, from his pig farm somewhere south of Big Whiskey, Wyoming on a quest to kill two cowboys who cut a whore who is offering a large reward to have the men who did it killed. Munny is conflicted about returning to his killing days, but as he says he needs the money. Morgan Freeman goes along because of loyalty to Munny. The very dark and mostly dreary story continues until the final shootout at the end. One of the taglines that has become memorable is ""Deserves got nothin' to do with it.""

I did truly love some of the scenes, but I found myself getting ""Eastwooded"" to death in a few places and that eroded greatly my enjoyment of the film as a whole. For example, there's the, ""Oh, no - I'm a dirt poor farmer-widower-single-parent-of-two and here I am pushing a pig through mud and oh, I'm so miserable and dirt poor and the father of two little'uns and my wife died and I can't even support my body enough to keep my face from ploughing headlong through this ""Instant Movie Mud"" and oh, did I mention my wife died?"" puh-LEEZ. That over dramatic mud scene was an insult to this viewer's intelligence. Even the mud looked like they opened up a big drum of ""ACME Movie Pig Mud."" Pigs were coming down with ""the fever"" on the spot and the little girl could diagnose it. And then there was the, ""You take care of your little sister, now, 'hear?"" as he rides off and leaves two barely-no-longer toddlers to mind the farm on their own for -- what was it? -- TWO WEEKS?! As Dr. Evil would put it, ""Rrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiggggggggt."" That's just the beginning of the film. There were some other real winners, but I'll keep this short.

102106,5,0790729644,"I love this movie and have ever since I saw it on its original theatrical run. I was never a fan of the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns. I preferred westerns like <i>High Plains Drifter</i> (which is my all-time favorite, just ahead of <i>Unforgiven</i>) that do something more with the genre.

Much has been said about <i>Unforgiven</i> as a deconstruction of the western, but I think it's also an exploration of personal narratives and identity. Are we the stories we tell about ourselves? Are we the sum of our actions? Are we the expectations of others? Are we a little bit of all of the above, or something else entirely?

Watching this movie as a 44-year-old reveals questions and insights about myself and life that the 21-year-old who first fell in love with this movie could never have seen. That's my favorite kind of movie, the movie that changes as I change, that gets more profound as I grow more curious.",1443916800,3,918,4.73125

102246,5,0790729644,"I watched this movie a few times since it was released in theatres so I guess you could call it a Long term review...  I have an infatuation with this movie.  I have found that as I get older this movie becomes a narrative on different parts of my life and I am able to empathize with the different characters in the story.  This Gem of a movie is just that, a multi-faceted gem.  Its a love letter to Mr Eastwood's past and his beloved Director of so many films we all have come to love.  I think Eastwood had to wait until he had experienced enough of life and its perils before he was able to make this film.  Every Star in this film was chosen correctly, let me write that again... EVERY Star was chosen correctly.  Many movies have a clunkiness to them because of their performances are so strong in other movies taht they etch themselves into our brains and we expect them to act a certain way.  Movies such as this one take those performances and use their range to surprise us with their acting.  Mr Eastwood is a director that not only asks for actors to step up their game and expects it, he makes them want to act at a higher level.  This movie is the Benchmark not only for westerns but for all modern reasonable budget films.  I say that because todays filmakers are applauded as Geniuses when most of the directors job is made so easy by Great editing, Special effects, 5-6 Producers and of course better trained actors.  mr Eastwood could have made this movie at any stage of the industry and it would have been just as good.  Take a film like Avatar, The Avengers or Gone with the wind and make them, 10 years out of their production either way and they will not hold up, this movie holds up no matter when it was made.  It is truely a Masterpiece in every sense of the word.",1441756800,2,1791,4.260355029585799

That said, the movie is well done, has a great cast and oddly, for a movie that explores violence, isn't that graphically violent, even during the scene when a gunslinger is being beaten.

No folding allowed in this film. Hackman plays the believable evil sheriff and exhibits very little of his hyperactive style that dominated the ""French Connection"". The scene where Clint is offered a ""free one"", could have been photographed better by using face close-ups more effectively.

102314,4,0790729644,"This is the last and most acclaimed of Eastwood's western's for good reason.  Unforgiven portrays violence in a very different light than most westerns.  By juxtaposing the failures of society to handle crime correctly with the sins of vigilantism, the narrative quickly slides into a darkness from which it never recovers.  Centrally, the story informs us about the impacts of previous sins (even when not perceived as such) on the community.  Eastwood brilliantly allows for these deeper ethical questions to pervade a thoroughly entertaining film.  Highly recommended.",1440720000,,571,5.517241379310345

102378,4,0790729644,"Many people dislike this movie and dislike it for the wrong reasons.  Poor editing has been one fault pointed out. Another is Eastwoods rather rigid manner of acting used to portray his character (Will), which is a critical comment on his acting rather than one made about the script.  Any criticism against the movie ought to focus on features of the script. Much of the dialogue seems contrived. The scripts wording and sentence structure seems to be an imitation of  the language-style the screenwriter has heard spoken in other movies portraying nineteenth century people living in the West. Script seems to suit Eastwood just fine. His character fits the laconic persona of him that has flourished over time.  Hackmans character, the antagonist, comes across as a spiteful individual. No exposition is offered for why Hackmans character (Little Bill) is such disagreeable individual.  A notable performance is achieved by the actor who plays the prostitute who is the victim of the violent assault. For her, not much dialogue to speak of. Times the camera is focused on her shows what she does with her face, the expressions or lack of such. A take-away about her could be that she fell in love with Will, which it seems she does. She offers herself to him -- a freebie. Among whores her status is diminished. Regarded no longer of value in her profession allows her to long for a change in her life. That change could occur through her being with Will. In love with Will, sensing she would be good for him, she probably had ideas of riding away with him. Such ideas never occur to him. In all likelihood what is said of her is extraneous to the story and the script. Its just interesting to think about nonetheless.",1438732800,,1721,4.761744966442953

102422,5,0790729644,"Despite my personal bias toward Clint Eastwood's ""The Outlaw Josey Wales,"" I can't argue that ""Unforgiven,"" his 1992 Academy Award-winner, isn't among the two or three last great Westerns Hollywood ever produced; and I can't argue that its Blu-ray presentation isn't pretty decent, too.  The ""however"" is that in this twentieth-anniversary Blu-ray Book edition, Warners don't appear to have done anything to improve upon the picture or sound, giving us the same audio and video encodes we got a few years earlier on BD; and this is despite the packaging saying it's ""newly restored.""  I guess the studio meant they ""newly restored"" the movie a few years earlier.  So, if you already own ""Unforgiven"" on Blu-ray, the primary advantage of this new release is the handsome and informative Blu-ray Book packaging.  Of course, if you don't already own the film in high def, this is certainly the edition to own.

""Unforgiven"" is producer-director-star Eastwood's and writer David Webb People's attempt to demytholigize the Western, to present the Old West on film as something closer to what it might really have been.  Thus, you will find no heroes here, nor any true villains.  The main character, played by Eastwood, is William Munny, a widower with two small children, living off the land in a little mud hole in the middle of the Kansas plains.  But it wasn't always so with Munny.  Some ten years earlier, he was a ""rootin', tootin' son-of-a-bitchin', cold-blooded assassin,"" a drunkard, a thief, and a murderer by his own admission.  But he found a new life in the bosom of a good woman who showed him the error of his ways and set him on a new and sober course before succumbing to smallpox on their prairie farm.

Now, life is tougher for Munny than ever before, and when a young gunslinger, the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), comes by offering to share a thousand-dollar reward with him if he'll help him kill a pair of cowboys, Munny goes for it.  But Munny insists he's a changed man, reformed, and is only doing the killing for the money; not like the old days when he would do it for pleasure.  And Munny especially wants to do the job when the Kid explains that the cowboys they're going after cut up a defenseless prostitute, and her fellow harlots are putting up the reward for the perpetrators' deaths because the law would do nothing to help them.

Munny hasn't been on a horse in years and can hardly handle a gun anymore, but that doesn't stop him.  He needs the cash.  More important, he sees the killing of these miscreants as a kind of redemption for him, a distorted good deed for a life of iniquity.  He hooks up with an old pal from his outlaw past, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), who has also forsaken the gun and turned to farming, and together the three men ride out like avenging angels, or knights errant, to right the wrongs of a harsh and uncaring world.

But, as I said, life is tough for Munny, and things are not so simple as their merely shooting two men dead and collecting their money.  The two cowboys they're after are holed up on a ranch just outside a little town whose sheriff, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), is a strict law-and-order man, a guy who believes that any means are worth the end.  Daggett is a bully and coward who commands respect with the help of a passel of deputies, and he administers his own brand of justice once he disarms a man.  Little Bill isn't about to have any bloodshed in or around his town.

Along the way we also meet a writer, W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek), an Easterner come West to find grist for his dime novels.  He's looking for gun-toting heroes, and if can't find them, he creates them.  Lately, he's spinning yarns around a phony British fop of a gunslinger who calls himself English Bob (Richard Harris).  Nothing is as it seems.

The movie depicts the West as a largely dirty, brutal place, at least the areas inhabited by Man, with the movie's characters all ordinary people with ordinary weaknesses.  Munny himself is neither a good bad man nor a bad good man; he is simply a man.  This is a deglamorized version of ""Shane,"" where not the fastest draw but the calmest demeanor and the steadiest hand wins the gun battle.  Likewise, Sheriff Daggett is no common heavy; instead, we see a person who truly believes in what he's doing to keep the peace, no matter how violent it may seem to us.

Some people who have seen this movie have said it also displays themes of antiviolence and women's lib, but these are only peripheral issues in a story that basically tries to proffer a different slant on a traditional genre.  And we must not forget the film's humor.  Though violent, often downright brutal, the filmmakers often imbue it with a lighthearted tone.  When somebody starts firing at Munny and Logan, it appears from the look on his face as though Munny may have been shot.  ""Did they hit you?"" asks Logan.  ""No,"" replies Munny.  ""I bumped my head falling off my horse.""

Yet for all its attempts at debunking the conventional Hollywood Western, ""Unforgiven"" remains an orthodox example of the breed.  It maintains Hollywood's strict ""Code of the West,"" where courage and loyalty reign supreme and the protagonist faces off with the antagonist in one big, final showdown.  William Munny may be older and more grizzled than Eastwood's seminal Western hero of several decades before, but, make no mistake, underneath it all he's still Sergeo Leone's ""Man With No Name.""

The movie's cinematography also works in the grand Western style, with gorgeous background scenery and vast, open vistas to ponder.  The leadoff shot of Munny's little cabin silhouetted on the prairie against a setting sun is itself worthy of brief meditation, as is the fine, simple musical score by Lennie Niehaus and the main musical theme by Eastwood himself.

Video:
As I mentioned earlier, the video encode appears to be the same one Warners used for their previous Blu-ray edition.  This means a VC-1 codec and a dual-layer BD50 to present the picture in its original aspect ratio of 2.40:1.  It's a fairly dark film, about half the action taking place either at night, in the darkness, or in the rain; and the high-definition transfer displays the detail in the darkness fairly well, with object delineation reasonably clean and clear.  Understand, however, that because of the overall duskiness of most of the film, the HD reproduction may not make every scene look much different from standard definition.  Anyway, the disc renders background shots and scenery beautifully and realistically, as are things like dusty trails and smoky barrooms, but where the high-def comes into its own is in close-ups, faces, and outdoor daylight shots.  I swear there are times you can see every leaf on every tree, although there are also times when things are a shade soft.  The Blu-ray's 1080p resolution sets off colors better than ever, with solid blacks providing a natural, three-dimensional appearance.

Audio:
As on their previous Blu-ray edition, the soundtrack again comes to us via lossy Dolby Digital 5.1.  Yes, I wished they had remastered it in lossless Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD Master Audio, but it was not to be.  Nevertheless, the Dolby Digital sounds fine, a wide frequency range producing a good deep bass and strong transient impact.  It is a pleasure to listen to the sounds of horses' hooves, birds, rain, crickets, and distant rolls of thunder rendered realistically.  While most of the sound continues to come from the front speakers in this 5.1 remix, the rear surrounds accomplish their job, too, enveloping the listening area in many environmental sounds of the day.  About my only minor criticism is that the upper midrange can be a tad forward and bright at times, although it doesn't have much effect on voices.

Extras:
""Unforgiven"" contains the same bonus items found on WB's previous Blu-ray edition, and they are an impressive lot.  First, there's an audio commentary with film critic and Eastwood biographer Richard Schickel, followed by four documentaries and a television show.  The best of the documentaries is a twenty-two minute item called ""All on Accounta Pullin' a Trigger"" that features comments by Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, and various crew members.  The second documentary, ""Eastwood & Co.:  Making Unforgiven,"" is twenty-three minutes, narrated by Hal Holbrook, and made at the time of the film's shooting in 1992; it seems more like PR hype than the first documentary, but it contains some useful information.  The third documentary, ""Eastwood...A Star,"" is sixteen minutes and chronicles the star's career; while the fourth documentary, ""Eastwood on Eastwood,"" is a sixty-eight minute examination of the man's life, career, and outlook on filmmaking.  Then, there's a classic, James Garner ""Maverick"" episode from 1959, ""Duel at Sundown,"" that features a young Eastwood in a supporting role.  These bonus items are perhaps a little much to absorb at one sitting, so you might want to go at them slowly.

The extras conclude with thirty-three scene selections; a widescreen theatrical trailer; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages; French and Spanish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Finally, because this is a Blu-ray Book release, the disc comes packaged in the back of a fifty-eight page hardbound book, filled with pictures and text illustrating almost every aspect of the film, its stars, and its production.

Parting Thoughts:
""Unforgiven"" is a delicate yet brutal balance of real West versus reel West.  If this seems contradictory, remember that the movie never strays too far in either direction to distract us from its primary purpose, which is to entertain.  It's no wonder the movie made more money than any previous Eastwood Western and won the Oscars it did, including Best Picture, Best Director (Eastwood), Best Supporting Actor (Gene Hackman), and Best Film Editing (Joel Cox).

Appropriate to its gritty purpose, the movie gets an R rating for vulgar language, violence, and sexual situations.  It's one heck of a good film.",1435276800,10,10094,4.908073070123748

102462,5,0790729644,"""Unforgiven"" (which is not the only film with this title) is the culmination of almost every western film Clint Eastwood has ever done. The film is a sort of stopping point for Eastwood within the western genre. And, because of these factors, it is a masterpiece. Eastwood's character, William Money , is reformed of all his wickedness as a once notorious gunslinger. But, within his character, as with many of us, lies dormant the potential for our old nature to resurface. He actually plays two characters, and how they unfold is what makes for classic cinema entertainment.

Eastwood, who also directed, puts a good amount of subtleties in the film that address questions about how people behaved and spoke in the old west. In some cases it's done with an ever so light bit of humour, enough to make you think about life in the 1800s long after the movie is over. Easily capable of subsequent viewings. I could spend hours writing about the film, but my words couldn't fully encapsulate the sheer brilliance of the film. Watch it in all is glory whenever you can.

102477,4,0790729644,"Ah, yes.  It all started a couple of weekends ago with a Dirty Harry marathon.  He had me at, ""Do you feel lucky, punk, well do ya?""  I've been bitten with the love bug ever since.  He always plays a loner (from the movies I've seen) and the strong, manly type, a man of few words, but wise words they are.

In Unforgiven he still plays the strong, silent type, where he personifies loyalty to his friends and gentleness to the woman who got cut up.  He's noble in his revenge and he gets down to business and even has compassion for someone he shoots.  This movie along with the Dirty Harry movies makes me want to see everything he's ever starred in or has directed.  I'm glad he's still alive and hopefully he has a few more movies left in him.  Every movie he's directed, that I've seen, I loved (and of Gran Torino's caliber).",1431907200,,831,4.2756410256410255

1,000 or more views still playing! But this is a classic western especially for the time it was made considering the junk hollyweird has
been putting out the last few decades. Eastwood and Hackman and entire cast performances are excellent. The ending is one of the
best ever made. I just watched again after I watched Pale Rider and Appaloosa which is just as good if not better. I read this movie
was made for 14 million and made 159 million and stayed in theater for over a year! most movies don't last a month now even though
they rake in millions they still are pure hollyweird garbage! I miss going and enjoying movies but they just don't make like this anymore
except for the rare occasion like Appaloosa. Too bad the talented and originality of Hollywood is vanishing before our eyes.",1430870400,,927,4.426900584795321
102485,5,0790729644,"""Unforgiven"" marked Clint Eastwood's entry into the canon of great directors.  His previous work hinted at a serious nature, that would never succumb to the lure of the easy thrill or cheap answer.  There had been great Westerns before, but they were all limited by their identification with that genre.  I recall one theater chain that would show a short ad before the main film, to remind the audience to keep quiet.  A boy was shown talking obliviously through the feature, which happened to be a Western, and one of his pronouncements was ""it's a typical good guys versus the bad guys, and all the bad guys die,"" which could sum up every Western ever made - until this one.

The characters in ""Unforgiven"" are difficult, complex, and utterly human in their failings.  We'd already seen countless bloody deaths in a brutal world of bad men; we've also seen the bad man trying to be good, who is nevertheless drawn back into his past against his wishes.  What ""Unforgiven"" showed us that was new, was the justification behind all this.  Richard Harris' dapper British gunslinger, who travels with his own biographer (had that ever been done before?  Not to my knowledge), is revealed to be a cold-hearted yet inept killer, as empty of honor as his biographer is of writing talent.  Gene Hackman's brutal sheriff is believable as the kind of man who would be needed to keep order in a lawless place.  We have the Scofield Kid, a boy trying to come across as tough in a man's world.  And we have William Munny, the brutal gunslinger who is still devoted to the dead wife who reformed him.

This last point bears repeating - what made ""Unforgiven"" unique in the genre was its emphasis on the lives and concerns of women.  In previous Westerns, women were portrayed either as homemakers, love interests, or prostitutes - but always secondary to the men, whose characters drove the action in most cases.  There were a few exceptions, such as ""Calamity Jane"" characters who were essentially men in female bodies.  ""Unforgiven"" introduces us right at the start to Claudia Feathers, a character so strong that she doesn't even need to make an appearance on screen.  As a force, she is still present in Munny's life to a large extent; although as the Morgan Freeman character points out, Munny wouldn't be participating in the murder-for-hire scheme at the center of the plot if his wife were still alive.  Later, Munny turns down a ""free one"" from one of the prostitutes, ""on account of his wife;"" the cynical Strawberry Alice's  response is ""he don't have a wife - at least, not above ground, anyway.""

The film's driving force is not the murder-for-hire, exactly, but what led to it - the brutal attack on a prostitute that resulted only in the two cowboys having to give several horses to the establishment's proprietor as compensation.  As Strawberry Alice says, ""we may have to let them ride us like horses, but we shouldn't have to let them brand us like horses.""  The issue is injustice - the sheriff doesn't see the two cowboys as ""bad men,"" only men who got a little carried away.  As it turns out, one of the men, ""Quick Mike,"" really is a bad man - a coarse, brutal lout with no respect for anything.  The other cowboy, ""Little Dave,"" seems genuinely sorry for what happened, and brings his own horse, ""the best of the lot - better than the ones I gave him"" as a personal gift to the disfigured prostitute.  When the other women get angry and drive him off, the camera lingers for a moment on Delilah, the expression on her face saying that maybe she would have liked her own pony.

It is in light of this that Munny's transformation at the end of the film shocks us - we knew he was a bad man, but something about the way the woman who reports Ned's death describes Ned's last words, of how ""William Munny blew up the train, killing women and children"" - there's something about hearing it in the third person, with the subject standing right there in front of her, that makes it particularly chilling.  The denoument establishes Eastwood's reputation, if there had been any doubt - not just by the character killing almost everyone in the room, but his words at the end, threatening to kill not just the man who shoots at him, but his family, his friends, and to ""burn his house down"" - we have no doubt that Munny has done this before, many times.

Beyond merely being a great film or even ""the greatest Western,"" ""Unforgiven"" effectively ended the Western as a pulp genre.  Never again can a Western be nothing more than ""the good guys versus the bad guys, and all the bad guys die,"" because now there are no more good or bad guys - the good guys and bad guys are the same people.  No Western that follows it, not even a remake of an older film, like the Coen Brothers'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Grit/dp/B0054NRPMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Grit</a>, can return to what, despite the requisite bloodshed, in retrospect was naive and innocent.",1430784000,2,5010,4.725287356321839

102593,5,0790729644,"I happen to be a big fan of the Western genre, but I am also a good judge of films as they stand in the opinions of the larger movie-going public.  While I can watch the Magnificent Seven and Once Upon A Time In The West every day of my life, I know that most people find them dated if not corny by today's cinematic standards.  Similarly, I can appreciate the epic-like stories many Westerns have adopted in recent years (Django Unchained, 3:10 to Yuma, and No Country for Old Men come to mind) and how that has undeniably made the genre more accessible and perhaps enjoyable to many looking for more than just shootouts and bar fights.  With this in mind, I can say there are very few Westerns that can be enjoyed by both the popcorn-eating and rootin-tootin' movie fans alike.  Unforgiven falls into that elite group.  The classic story line was most recently replicated in the movie ""Smokin' Aces,"" where a group of elite assassins all ride into town with hopes of collecting the bounty posted on a pair of protected cowboys.  The lines of good vs. evil are blurred throughout the film making the story more entertaining and more believable.  This is an easy film for anyone to turn on and enjoy but also a great film to watch again and analyze.  I feel like every time I watch this movie I flip-flop on who I think was the ""real"" good guy in the story.  I think that element alone would make it compelling to most, loved my many, and adored by some.  Overall this is a classic film and one everyone can enjoy.",1424044800,4,1514,4.413669064748201

It's about a regular old cowboy who is visited by this kid who tells him that these two men beat this woman and cut her up and they want to pay to have these men killed. It doesn't sound very appealing, but then you watch it and the story comes to life. You find out this regular old cowboy is not who he appears to be and nothing goes as planned.

Filled with amazing Oscar worthy performances from both Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman, this film will not disappoint you if you are a fan of the genre. But even if you are not a fan of westerns this film hits all the right notes as a perfect example of drama in the old west setting. Although this does take place in the western setting, it feels more of a story of regular characters who are just trying to get by and the things faced in this type of setting.

102664,5,0790729644,"Clint Eastwood made his fame a fortune through the highly entertaining ""spagetti westerns"" directed by the visionary Italian director, Sergio Leone.  During those films Eastwood's western persona was created - that is the skilled gunfighter/killer, bent on revenge, guns down those ruthless killers, who are far worst than himself, and who committed a great injustice towards Eastwood's character, justifying his brutality.  Those films were created in the early to mid 60's.  The ""Unforgiven""  is the final bookend of that character created so many years earlier.  Here, Eastwood, an aging killer in his early 60's, a pig farmer no less with two small children, has hung up his guns and given up his ""wicked"" ways for the love of his wife who had died from smallpox three years earlier.  Enter a smart ass kid, full of himself, calling himself kid something or another and a real killer, illiciting Eastwood's help to kill two cowboys who had brutally cut up a whore because she laughed at the size of his male member.  Needing money and not being able to shoot very well or even ride a horse, Eastwood secures the help of his old partner, Morgan Freeman, and the two join the kid for the killing.  Standing In their way is a sadistic sheriff played brillaintly by Gene Hackman in one of his best roles.  What transpires is both blood soaked and tender in a curious blend of conflicting emotions that explores the question, do we ever get beyond our past?",1417392000,3,1456,4.815261044176707

102674,5,0790729644,"This has to be one of the best Westerns ever made. Released in 1992 ,and at that time claimed to be the best Western made by anyone in the past 20 years. It won 4 Academy Awards in 1992,including Best Picture and Best Director. Clint Eastwood was 62 at the time it was released. By that time Eastwood had not only established himself as a great Actor and great Director;but the best of the best of the Western genre. He is a unique figure in the world of Hollywood. A self made success who went from being a popular TV star in the series ""Rawhide"" to become a leading actor,director and producer. When the movie industry gave up on the long popular Westerns;Eastwood went to Italy and Spain,teamed up with Sergio Leone and created the Spaghetti Westerns,They were so successful,the Western as a genre ,was changed and later other genres of movies were also changed by Eastwood's influence.
 In ""Unforgiven"",Eastwood and Morgan Freeman play retired,over the hill outlaws,who pick up their guns for a last time to collect a bounty offered  by prostitute friends of another prostitute who was severely disfigured in a Wyoming Old West town of Big Whiskey. Another great performance is by Gene Hackman,the local sheriff,who isunconventional ,brutal and crooked in all aspects of laws enforcement.
 ""Unforgiven"" became a Western classic immediately, and remains so even  today.",1416268800,,1372,4.952173913043478

102688,5,0790729644,"This film is by far the most mature of all the 'westerns' out there and a must have for fans of the genre.  This is a film that only a great star can have made after having had a great career.
The film concerns a former outlaw, played by Eastwood, who loses his friend and has to take out retribution on those who he thinks are responsible.  Morgan Freeman is great as Eastwood's friend, Hackman great as his ally/foe, and Richard Harris great as a representative of the haughty Europeans(Brits in this case) and their attitude to the new world.  Harris was a hired thug essentially, doing unspeakable things from a moving horse or moving train.
What is the grand payoff of the film is the ending.  Eastwood is the avenging angel, setting things right.  However, as he leaves the screen a voice reminds us that he was not just a naughty soul in the past but a really rotten individual, someone who should remain 'Unforgiven'...
So, you are brilliantly taken in one direction before being reminded of civilization, law, and why our 'hero' can never be righteous...",1414627200,,1063,4.632978723404255

Did he plant any grain?  Not sure how this lifestyle is sustainable or how a viral illness has spread to such an isolated cohort of pigs.  Still, Eastwood is his trademark sensitive, yet rugged cowboy who does not disappoint in the final vengeance scene even if it is perplexing why we need the out of place, plump writer character creating a distraction.",1407196800,,719,4.868852459016393

102763,5,0790729644,"There are few moments in the history of film more gripping than the final act of Unforgiven, beginning with the moment Munny (played by Eastwood) realizes that Ned is, in fact, dead, and takes the whiskey bottle from the hands of the Schofield kid without saying another word. There is a nihilistic thrill as William Munny embraces alcohol and firearms and rides back into town, something that taps the oldest parts of our reptile brain, accessing archetypal memories of heroes like Achilles, who did nothing particularly 'heroic' in the modern sense -- he was an (almost) indestructible killing machine, who sulked and retired from the killing field after Agamemnon took the slave he won in battle. He returned to it as an avenging angel, chasing down and killing the noble Hector after the Trojan prince defeated the Achaean's cousin Patrocles in single combat, mistaking him for Achilles when the frustrated young warrior, tired of watching the battle rage without him, donned the famous armor and helm belonging to the son of Peleus. In the same way, William Munny the infamous gunslinger who has 'killed everything that walks or crawls, at one time or another', retired from his days as an alcoholic killer after falling in love with the young woman who introduced him to the Bible, becoming his wife and the mother of his children, is enticed to return to the way of the gun after a wannabe-outlaw suggests they join forces to assassinate two men with money on their heads. Although the sweet-natured young prostitute who is mutilated by a drunken cowboy is certainly no Helen of Troy, the Schofield Kid no Odysseus, Ned Logan no Patrocles, Little Bill Daggett no Hector, and William Munny no Achilles, screenwriter David Peoples created a story with all the power and tragic grandeur of The Iliad, a myth of the American West that loosely and perhaps unconsciously derives from Homer's first masterpiece. But Unforgiven's raw, visceral power comes from the brilliantly-scripted dialogue and character development Peoples maps out. His entire story is a deconstruction of the mythologies of the Old West, where brave lawmen keep the peace, enforcing a rough justice in which Outlaws who choose to live by the gun die by the gun. In the character of the Big-city reporter we see the origins of these myths. He follows the cold-blooded English Bob, a deadly gunslinger who works for the railroads, faithfully copying Bob's tales of his own heroic gunfights. When the train arrives in Big Whiskey, however, the town run by Little Bill Daggett, the sheriff employs one of his typically inconsistent punishments, beating English Bob brutally for failing to give up his guns, in defiance of a town ordinance, when first asked by one of Bill's deputies. The reporter-biographer abandon's Bob to make Little Bill his new subject, who is very forthcoming about the failings of anyone but himself. His accounts of some of English Bob's exploits peel back the shiny surface of lies, to reveal a psychopath with a steady hand who worked for the railroads so he could murder Chinese laborers and slake his thirst for blood. Little Bill, played by Gene Hackman in one of my all-time favorite performances, is a complex character based on legendary lawmen like Wyatt Earp. His confidence and charisma inspires loyalty in his deputies and townsfolk, and the biographer -- played by Saul Rubinek in another standout performance -- believes he has finally worked his way up the food chain to find the sort of feared and fearless lawman he's been looking for. Bill pulls back the curtain on the realities of a gunfight, and avoids braggadocio in a manner that suggests he doen't need it. But Bills' heavy-handed and arbitrary punishments are the catalyst for all the bloodshed that follows. His view of law and justice are reflected in his attempts at home-building; his out-of-square walls, uneven floor, and leaking roof are not enough to convince him that his attempt at carpentry was a failure. And when the poor young prostitute has had har hard life made a thousand times harder by the cowboy who cuts up her face, Little Bill decides that the penalty will be a fine, a few horses, paid not to the injured girl, but to Skinny the brothel owner. This blatant injustice, and the fact that Little Bill views them as property no better than horses, inspires the women at the brothel to place a bounty on both cowboys' heads, despite the other man's attempt to stop his partner and disgust at what he did. Nevertheless, he will die unforgiven. The prostitutes will be unforgiven for who they are and what they did. Ned will die unforgiven, simply for riding with Munny. And when Munny rides back into Big Whiskey, no one is forgiven, least of all Daggett, who tortured, killed and displayed the corpse of Ned Roundtree, Munny's only friend. After wounding Bill, killing his deputies, and sending the rest of the posse fleeing into the night, Munny realizes Bill is alive and steps on a wrist before he can aim his pistol. He then points the shotgun into Daggett's face. ""I don't deserve this... I built a house..."" Little Bill rasps, staring into the double-barrel inches away. After emptying the bottle of liquor on the ride, William Munny seems more terrifyingly sober than we've yet seen him. In Eastwoods' inimitable whisper, he delivers the line that sums up the centuries of bloodshed that accompanied the settling of the American frontier: ""Deserves got nothing to do with it.""

102778,5,0790729644,"*** For a description of the plot, please see other reviews, as I do not intend to summarize it here. Unforgiven (1992) sports an all-star cast (Eastwood, Hackman, Freeman), who manage to give their best performances. Let's face it- westerns aren't the easiest movies to act in, yet these guys made it look easy. A bit long in duration, it still kept my interest. I'm a sucker for a good western once in a while. The setting and environments are well-done and breathtaking, and capture the film's essence. Unforgiven is one of the best western films ever made, though I think that True Grit (2010) is a bit better. This movie garnered its  share of awards, which were well-deserved. Overall, Unforgiven is solid entertainment for 2.5 hours. I appreciate the modern-day attempt at this often neglected genre. 9/10",1400544000,,812,4.884057971014493

So this will not be a review of the film because if you just want the film then you would probably buy a cheaper version.  This is about the Blu-ray Book format and how it is vastly superior to all other versions but only if you are a collector or someone who enjoys all the trivia that goes along with it.  I am one of those people.  It is very entertaining to sit down and watch the film and look at the book at the same time.  The behind the scenes information is so much fun and very enlightening.

Just like the dvd counterpart this one also has lots of extras including the Maverick episode where he played opposite James Garner (a classic). Well worth every penny. This has to be one of the best movies ever made if not at least the best western ever made. A bit different than most as it shows the consequences not just the acts. Everyone has to face his or her own demons, everyone has to take responsibility for their actions and the consequences that stems from them. A Great story from top to bottom with top tier talent (Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman)..you really will love this movie. if you like westerns or even if you are just a casual fan of the genre you'll love this movie.

One other thing that is realistic, you don't see in many movies are the fights. I've watched scenes in a movie, that I had liked until then, ruin the rest of the movie. Rocky is a good example of unreal fights. I was raised in a place that had been mining towns a few years before, and fought most of my life. I've never seen a man take a full shot to the face and maybe spin around, then come back into the fight. If I had ever hit someone with my best shot, that didn't at least go to their knees, I would have offered him my keys, all my money etc. I'm not saying I'm a bada-s, but as much as we fought you had to be able to hold your own, or give up your lunch money and anything else we wanted.

The body count isn't as high as in ""Josey"" but Unforgiven is probably grittier and more realistic.

102857,4,0790729644,"This is the best of Eastwood's westerns. This is the first one that I didn't feel like I was watching Dirty Harry's great grandfather or the return of the Highplains Drifter.  Of course that is my opinion and I'm entitled to it.  In this movie Eastwood has gotten the period mostly correct, not only in clothing but speech and how people felt, reacted, to and about things in the era in which the film takes place.  The ever increasing injuries to the Prostitute as the story gets told over and over, I think this was common at a time when word of mouth was the only way news traveled.  I believe it to be true that a lot of bad men were bad men when they were drunk and maybe not quite so bad when they weren't. I think very few movies have ever touched on how much alcohol played a part in making brave men. Not only the bad ones but the good ones too.  This movie deals with the act of killing someone like few westerns before it ever had. It's not glamourous to kill someone as Jaimz Woolvett's charactor discovered.  Eastwood's portrayal of Will Munny is, I think one of his best.  Gene Hackman's ""Little Bill"" charactor is a far account of how a lot of so called lawmen really were, and Hackman manages to really make you dislike ""Little Bill"".
  I'm a stickler for period correctness and it often means a lot to me when a director takes the time to get things as right as they can make it.  Eastwood did a really great job on this film, ""getting things right"" not just the period but his actors as well.
  Just so you know this is not a movie for young'ens or those offended by off color language.",1383523200,,1604,4.257425742574258

It involves well-worn themes from  like honor, revenge, family and the desire to get away from this violent world, and the characters are nothing particularly new either. There's certainly nothing wrong with this plot, and it has some fine lines and a few particularly affecting scenes, but it's nothing to get to overly worked up over. Still, the sheer craft displayed herein makes the film remarkable. The performances are all perfect, the score, while perhaps overly conventional, is powerful and emotive, the cinematography is consistently appealing and the period detail is utterly convincing. Again, this is a world we've seen before, but it's more fully realized than ever before, and it makes the film nearly mesmerizing even in the scenes where little is actually going on. Also, there's one scene late in the film, a firefight which is simply breath taking.

  ""ALICE

 That's all.  She didn't know
 no better.""
It shows a period in the American history that fast faded after the civil war: western justice, bounty hunting, extrajudicial executions and punishments.

His last western and the last he has to say on the subject. A must-have for any fan and any moviegoer.

102903,5,0790729644,"Unforgiven works so well because it is a convincing attempt at painting a realistic image of what it must have really been like to be a cowboy. Unlike westerns of the past where our heroes kill 20 dozen men and feel nothing, Unforgiven paints us a very different picture about the price you pay in your own soul for taking another man's life. Clint Eastwood struck gold with Unforgiven. The timing couldn't have been better in 1992 for a full scale engrossing western, and in the end Eastwood finally had his Oscars he had been dreaming about, even if he lost the nod for best actor. I am sure he wasn't too disappointed. Several actors here give possibly the best performances of their careers, and Gene Hackman won an Oscar for his portrait of the brutal town sheriff 'Little Bill Dagget'. This movie holds it's own along with classics like Dances with Wolves and The Wild Bunch. Maybe not as sweepingly epic as those films but just as good.",1371513600,,943,4.585798816568047

The sheriff, Little Bill (Hackman) gives them a punishment but the other women pool their funds to pay for bounty hunters. A young gun requests the help of a former outlaw Will Mummy (Eastwood) so they can collect the payment. However, because his deceased wife changed his ways, at first Will is reluctant. In need of money, he eventually heads off and brings along his old partner Ned (Freeman). After an initial conflict in the town of Big Whiskey, they kill the first one of their targets. Ned backs out and leaves the other two to get the second victim. After they do it, they find out Ned met trouble from the merciless sheriff. The young gunslinger gets cold feet and so an angry Mummy heads into town for the final showdown. Eastwood's character is interesting because he starts out trying to be good but he finally reverts back to his old ways. In this film it is difficult to tell who is bad or good.

I do have the film on a Standard Def DVD so, while this is not a side by side comparison, I do have the SD version to refer to.
The video transfer is not really bad.  There were no artifacts or mis colorization's, no aliasing or ghosting at all.  The warm color grading is hampered a touch by crushed blacks which take away some of the details in the video.  That said, I really didn't think there was much, if any, difference between the SD and this BR version.  The SD DVD was pretty decent to start off with so my guess is that Warner Brothers, in their continuing lazy way, simply reformatted the SD to the BluRay format without any remastering at all.

The audio is the bigger shame of the two.  Rather than a lossless audio like DTS HD 5.1 or PCM 5.1, Warner Brothers kept the same audio as the SD DVD which was DD 5.1 , a lossy audio.  While it is fairly clear and the audio levels are nicely balanced,  once one gets used to the lesser compression that lossless audio provides, when you hear the lossy compressed version, it does sound muffled in comparison.  The sub channel is not used in this film despite the thunderstorms because of this compression and the only time the rear channels are used discreetly is for the falling of the rain.

The price is right if you don't already have any version of this fine film, but if all you have is the Standard Def version, you will probably not notice much of a difference by going to this disappointing Blu Ray.

All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.
Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

You eventually see the tough, hard nosed character which Eastwood made so famous in many of his early films but not before you witness his character's many weaknesses and shortcomings.

What really drove me to get the Blu-ray version of the movie was to compare its video quality to that of the standard DVD format. I've noticed that not all Blu-ray movie disks are created equally. Just because a movie is on Blu-ray does not necessarily mean that the video quality will be significantly better than an upscaled standard DVD version that was created from a good master copy.  I was confused at seeing so many versions (and sales prices) of Blu-ray disks for the same movie but now I'm beginning to feel that the most important criteria is the quality of the master from which the Blu-ray disk was created from.

Fortunately, the version I purchased (marked with a release date of 2010) does have a superior video quality than the standard DVD copy I have and makes it a welcomed addition to my film collection.",1358294400,,1245,4.569506726457399

102971,5,0790729644,"If you are at all a fan of the Spaghetti Western, this film will likely knock your socks off. The themes, characters, acting, dialogue and story are all 5 star.

An old outlaw and gunslinger, William Munny is forced to confront the horrors of his criminal youth during a fever. He suffers the fever while reluctantly employed as a mercenary assassin at the behest of a group of prostitutes that did not receive justice at the hands of a small-town sheriff.

The Sheriff, is not utterly corrupt or wicked, nor is any character in the story. The shades of grey are true to life and the viewer can find revulsion and sympathy in the well-told stories of it's diverse characters. The film comes together after Munny's old henchman dies during an interrogation for a crime he did not commit. William takes the news rather calmly while collecting payment for the assassinations and then picks up the bottle of whiskey he had shunned since his youth. He figuratively becomes the angel of death in the best cinematic shoot-out of all time.

102981,5,0790729644,"It may be somewhat controversial to claim that Unforgiven is the single greatest Western, but most fans of the genre would agree that it deserves to be lauded as one of the best. Unforgiven manages to be both a traditional Western and a deconstruction of the traditional Western, such that it is as thought-provoking as it is suspenseful. Eastwood returns as a grisly anti-hero, much the same as his ""Man with No Name"" persona, in a familiar yet tainted setting. Those interested in Eastwood, Westerns, or otherwise fans of the grisly, brooding anti-hero archetype will enjoy this brilliant film. While Unforgiven takes itself quite seriously, it is sprinkled throughout with loving parody of the once-dominant Hollywood action genre.

Unforgiven is a must-see for fans of American cinema. With delightful performances from Hackman, Harris, Freeman, and Eastwood, this is a film worthy of its cast and its ambition. Both cerebral and visceral, Unforgiven comes with my highest recommendation.",1354492800,,992,5.318471337579618

102994,5,0790729644,"""Unforgiven"" is set in early 1880s Wyoming and captured the Oscar for Best Picture for 1992.  The movie also won three other Academy Awards.  At the start of the film, a prostitute is brutally attacked, and a bounty is offered by those in the brothel to anyone who can kill the assailants.  William Munny (Clint Eastwood) travels to Wyoming with Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) in hopes of collecting the bounty, but Big Whiskey sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) is set on stifling any attempts at revenge for the attack.

In addition to the first-rate cast, the cinematography was very good as well (""Unforgiven"" was nominated for an Oscar in that area, too).  The characters are complex and have mixed motives--there are really no good guys here, and this is definitely the seamier side of the Old West.  While certainly there were showdowns between good and evil in the Old West, the film is an entertaining reminder that there probably were at least some noir episodes in that time and place as well.",1344297600,,1008,4.797687861271676
102995,5,0790729644,"For a long time, I was what many would consider the average moviegoer. I wasted my money crappy movies often, just because of a star that I liked, or a premise that seemed interesting. As much as I hate to admit it, I did not like Westerns for the life of me. I saw Appaloosa when it came out in theatres, and ironically liked it, albeit only a little. I then saw 3:10 To Yuma, and what do you know, I loved it. Still do. Finally, there came a point where I had to ask myself what my problem was, why I refused to give other Westerns a chance. I eventually blind bought the DVD and decided to watch, not only one of the classic films collecting dust on my shelf, but one of the greatest Westerns ever made. Unforgiven is very well done. Certainly deserving of the recognition it has received over the years. I'm actually glad that this movie won Best Picture. Clint Eastwood is obviously well known for his portrayal of cowboys back when Westerns owned the air waves. I love how he came back in the early 90's to show them he hadn't lost his touch with a six shooter, or Schofield rifle, or shotgun, etc. He was perfect, and played the role exactly as I would expect. But his character went through a change that I was not expecting.

The movie progresses along at a slow pace, and calmly inches its way toward the thrilling conclusion. Throughout the film we hear repeatedly how much of a badass Bill Munny was back in his heyday. There wasn't much to show for it. When we first meet him he's falling all over his pigs. Later on down the line he gets a fever from a small beating and is asleep for three days. I started to think to myself that this guy needed to take his old behind back home before he got too deep into trouble. He was not in any shape to try to kill anyone. Slowly, but surely we meet the man. I'll leave it at that because it's nearly impossible to say more without spoiling anything. I'll just say that Clint's performance is enough to sit through this one, even without the fantastic supporting cast and subtle writing. Morgan Freeman was great as well. He played Bill's longtime friend and partner in crime, Ned. When a young man suddenly shows up on Bill's ranch asking him to help kill a couple of bad men for a bounty, Ned's place is the first stop Bill makes. Together Bill and Ned accompany the young man on this hit. I might as well call it a hit, instead of sugar coating it. Bill and Ned are assassins, hitmen. So they aren't very good men themselves. The young man, called ""The Schofield Kid"", is played by Jaimz Woolvett (a relatively unknown...to me anyway). He does great too.

The whole cast is really good. Gene Hackamn plays a real jerk of a town sheriff, named Little Bill, and Richard Harris has a short, but meaningful role as English Bob. I should also mention that the whores were well played as well. I feel bad calling them that, but that's what everyone else in the movie called them. I really liked this cast. Clint Eastwood is a hell of a director. The shots are really nice to look at. This isn't his most beautifully shot film, but this cinematography will impress nonetheless. If Sergio Leone's The Man With No Name Trilogy is even a fraction as good as Unforgiven, I cannot wait. I can rest assured that that was a worthwhile purchase, even for a non-Western fan like myself. I really look forward to seeing many more films in this genre hence forth. If you're like I was, and doubt you'll be interested in movies like this one, stop it. Just give Unforgiven a chance and see for yourself. I highly recommend this movie.",1342396800,,3573,4.371428571428571

102998,2,0790729644,"Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman play two retired wild west bounty hunters, back in their saddles to chase one last bounty after decades of silence. Agonizingly slow, its two leads take their sweet time collecting their belongings, mounting their horses and trotting at a leisurely pace across state lines, sharing less than a few sentences along the way. We gather that Eastwood was a shady character in his day, reformed by the love of a deceased wife, but he seems more like a caged animal than a redeemed spirit and we're never given much reason to pull for him despite the presumed change of heart. Though his beloved bride's spirit lives on in the couple's two young children, he barely acknowledges their presence before leaving them on their own for a month to randomly hunt a new bounty. Freeman tries to drag some character development out of him on the trail, but Eastwood holds onto it with an icy grip and piercing eyes, and there we sit for the rest of the picture. Gene Hackman is noteworthy for his portrayal of a smarmy, cocky town sheriff with a chip on his shoulder, but on every other count this is a western that misses with each squeeze of the trigger. Despite a few beautiful panoramas, the world feels stiflingly tight and compressed. Outside of Hackman, there's no fire and passion in the cast, even when Eastwood turns the page and transgresses to his wilder young persona. Finally, the atmosphere, crucial to all films of the genre, feels too clean and polished where it should be gritty and dirty. Much as I would have loved to see Clint don that familiar parka and revisit the days of his Sergio Leon sunrise, it's just not happening here.",1334880000,3,1669,4.680272108843537

Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris join forces in an effort to obtain the reward money. After the setting, the story is mainly about the confrontation within the trio and the sheriff and the values that emerge considering that the gun is mainly law.

103006,5,0790729644,"Unforgiven earned a #98 spot on the initial AFI top 100 listing and moved up to #68 in their 10 year anniversary revote. It well deserves this ranking, if not a higher one. The movie features stellar acting, amazing dialogue, gorgeous landscapes, and a compelling story of a gunfighter who is trying to ""do right"" and leave behind his previous life of violence.

Eastwood is only lured back into strapping on his guns because his children are near starving, and the cause is just - a prostitute was cruelly sliced up by a cowboy. He enlists friend Freeman to help him with his task. Hackman and Harris are superb as other gun-wearing characters in this investigation of motives and characters.

Every person here feels authentic and real. The Sheriff wants to keep the peace, but can be a bully in his task. He has a quiet home he's trying to build, and he enjoys sharing his experiences. Freeman's relationship with his wife, the gentle way he deals with Woolvett, how he handles the shooting scene, are all amazing to watch. In each case the watcher gets drawn into what is happening through the subtle dialogue and the character's actions, rather than with bland statements found in many other westerns.

It's interesting that I watched this back-to-back with Shane. I am still surprised that Unforgiven ranks ""worse"" than Shane on the AFI lists. They handle extremely similar topics - how an ex-gunfighter copes with a world that has moved on around him. But Unforgiven is full of rounded characters, of powerful dialogue, and of a world we can immerse in. When Eastwood returns home at the end, it's an extremely powerful moment, and there was a real sense of the transformation which had occurred over the course of the film.

Unforgiven also gets great credit for how well it involves women in the storyline. Many westerns seem to feel that women were non-existent in the West, only there to be stolen by ""wild Indians"" or to scream in horror as their menfolk went off to do some fighting. In Unforgiven, we get a range of very powerful female characters. The main group are the prostitutes, who take a stand against being treated like property and who end up having an impact with their actions. Even Freeman's wife gives a subtle yet powerful performance as the reluctant one left behind.

Well deserving of winning Best Picture, Best Director, and Supporting Actor for Hackman's Sheriff character. To me this is what a western should be all about. The challenges of living in a rough land, the challenges of dealing with the tumultuous societal changes that were going on, the clashes between different groups of people, and the rough, wild, fantastically beautiful scenery that it was all set in.",1329696000,,2707,4.812903225806451

David Webb Peoples adroitly exposes the cunning ways of evil, but it took a skillful director and powerful acting to keep the ridiculous Will Munny from being exposed for the completely selfish summation-of-all-stupidity he is. When watching ""Unforgiven"" be wise, be vigilant, and be wary of the company you keep or you get snakebit. This is no ordinary movie from the Hollywood mill; you must pay attention from the moment you see the solitary figure digging a grave under that tree until the moment the solitary figure returns in victory to stand over the grave under that stupid tree.  Now, if you get yourself snakebit, and your vision gets all blurred , and you don't know what you saw, look upon the Word to clear your vision, so you don't trip and fall into a grave.

 This movie has been classified as a Cowboy Western because it has cowboys and they carry guns, and as such it is excellent. But, it's also a morality play ending tragically when the flawed hero dies. What is his blind spot? Where is the wisdom in this apparently nihilistic movie? David Webb Peoples has a wicked talent for wrapping a mystery within the facts presented upfront and repetitively. When the mysteries of this movie are solved every scene adds meaning. Even the character's names and the cursed guns Will Munny uses to kill reveal something. A major theme of ""Unforgiven"" is immorality and immoral uses of money serving a will-to-power, thus Will Munny. David Webb Peoples loads up his story with moral themes overflowing, and then demonstrates something essential about perception.

 When it comes to physcological thrillers, the ""The Crying Game"" is a distant second to ""Unforgiven."" The physcological effects on audiences are more insidious. Discombobulated critics babble on about deconstructing western mythology, reconstructionist history, yada yada yada... and totally miss the simple old fashion moral wisdom of this movie. Slipping through moral defenses at their weakest points, the author manages to overcome the judgment faculties of a viewer's mind more effectively than alcohol and lust. Once that's accomplished, he's able to mask the lying murdering no-good evil enemy, Will Munny, as the downtrodden vulnerable underdog protagonist, and mask the tragically flawed hero, Little Bill, as the fascist pig antagonist beating and kicking famous murderers who show up in his town to murder. This movie is almost too funny to be credible, but Peoples and Eastwood managed to keep their experiment from blowing up their careers. If you can't discern the good from the evil, than you're left with a blinding fog of nihilism, and you are completely oblivious to the fundamental and recurring theme, a crescendo rising to a prophetic blast from Gabriel's trumpet; good men are warped, weakened, and destroyed by evil associations.  The innocent either understand this movie or hate it for its creepy and subtle disorientating duplicity and misdirection: a funhouse affect. The way this movie digs itself into a viewer's mind to warp his perception reminds me of the ""Ring;"" really creepy and considering the social implications, ""Unforgiven"" reaches the apex of horror. Have you seen zombie flicks? Well, ""Unforgiven"" is a successful demonstration of mind warping control over the walking dead, who christians call unforgiven. Until EWTN showed me the way, I was one of the walking dead, recognizing stupid but blind to wisdom.

 ""Unforgiven"" is as much of a comment on current day control of the masses by the various forms of media as it is a significant comment on moral ambiguity. The two subjects are related, because the enemy first appears at the open door, something always fills a vacuum, and nihilists place their faith in and seek answers from victorious strongmen who in turn look upon people as mere objects upon which they exercise and demonstrate their power. Never ridicule Nietzsche style self-willed ubermensches about the ultimate smallness of their power or ""they will turn and tear you,"" which is the full extent of their power.

 Western expansion may have been driven by a desire to escape control by others, but run as far as they may, men carry the seeds of their destruction with them; reminds me of the Edgar Allan Poe story,""Masque of the Red Death."" ""Unforgiven"" is epic in its scope, and once understood the viewer finds many pearls of wisdom. I'm not going to write a book here, but I will refer you to the bible and the catechism of the catholic church; good vaccinations against evil.

 The author concludes with a riddle concerning Mrs. Ansonia Feathers, that is worthy of a sphinx, in which you'll find the raison d'etre of the movie. We now know all too intimately. A fitting end to a funhouse ride. Clever.

 Enjoy the experience and savor all the fine details of a rooting-tooting philosophical shoot-out, but caution: be wise, vigilant, and wary of who you ride with, partner. Happy trails.",1315958400,,5084,5.048926014319809

Unforgiven (1992) won four Academy Awards (Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor, and Editing).  Directed by Clint Eastwood, this western stars Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, Richard Harris, Jaimz Woolvett, Saul Rubinek, Frances Fisher, and Anna Thompson.

Gene Hackman won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Little Bill Daggett.

There have been so many great reviews written, so I just want to give my thoughts on this movie.

The story itself is intriguing.  It's basically about two retired outlaws who come out of retirement to collect a bounty.  A group of prostitutes from Big Whiskey, Wyoming offer $1,000.00 to anyone who can kill two cowboys that had disfigured one of the prostitutes.  The local sheriff does not like what's going on, as he does not allow firearms or assassins in his town.

In Kansas, William Munny (Clint Eastwood) is visited by The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), who tries to recruit Munny to kill the cowboys.  Munny recruits his old riding partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman).  Together they head west to Big Whiskey, Wyoming.  Do they get the job done?  Watch to find out.

The atmosphere and feel of the Old West town was captured very thoroughly.  The scenery is breathtaking throughout the movie.  This DVD's clarity is outstanding.

The best acting comes from Gene Hackman, in my opinion.  He plays a mean and heartless sheriff very well.  Clint Eastwood is outstanding as well, as is Morgan Freeman, Jaimz Woolvett, Richard Harris, and Frances Fisher.  Really, EVERYBODY in the movie gives great acting performances.  EVERYBODY.  There are a lot of memorable lines spoken by many of the actors, particularly Eastwood, Hackman, Woolvett, and Harris.  I think Jaimz Woolvett's acting performance is exceptional as the ""Schofield Kid"".

One of the things I really like about this movie is the darkness throughout.  The nighttime scenes and the scenes in which it's raining remind me of film noir, only this movie is in color.  Really, it's modern day film noir.  I really like the musical score as well.  It's simple, yet highly effective.  It falls into the category of ""less is more"".

All in all, a great western movie that's a little different than typical westerns.  This one is more realistic, darker, grittier, and the characters have a lot of depth to them.  They definitely aren't shallow characters.  This is my favorite western of all time.  I highly recommend this film.",1284336000,3,2473,5.069651741293533

103054,5,0790729644,"I'm not certain how much I would like ""Unforgiven"" if I had never seen a Western before.  I suspect I would still consider it a masterpiece.  But approaching it from the perspective of decades of watching ""Cowboys and Indians"", I view Clint Eastwood's Oscar winner as one of the most important achievements in film history.

Eastwood created the Man With No Name personna in Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, masterpieces that changed the genre.  But Unforgiven elevates ""The Western"" to a level I think will never be approached again.  ""Unforgiven"" is to The Western as ""The Godfather"" is to the gangster movie.

In old Lone Ranger era Westerns the hero wore a white hat and dispatched bad guys in morally unambiguous gunfights.  By the end of John Wayne's career in cowboy pictures heroes weren't as clearly defined. In pictures like ""The Searchers"" and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" the heroes had skeletons in their closets. Then Leone's films made the West seem an even grittier, sweatier place, and there was more than a little anti-hero in the leading characters.  Still, gunfights happened quickly and the winner was always a dead-eye who could shoot the wings off a gnat at a hundred paces.  The losers of gunfights fell quickly and silently to their death.

In Unforgiven Eastwood gives us a vision we can imagine as closer to the truth.  His character William Munny was once ""a known thief and murderer, a man of notoriously vicious and intemperate disposition,"" as we're told in the opening title card.  We learn Bill Munny was once the most dangerous of a group of outlaws in hints that are given leading up to the climax.  But Munny has been changed by marriage.  His comely wife has died of smallpox, leaving him a poor pig farmer with two children.  He hasn't shot at a man in eleven years.  We can feel his struggle for redemption.  In addition to giving up his previous life as a criminal, he has stopped drinking and, when given the opportunity at a woman younger and prettier than him, he declines out of respect for his dead wife.

But Bill Munny's demons are old and powerful.  A group of prostitutes pool their money and spread the word that they'll pay a bounty for the death of a bad-tempered cowboy who cuts one of them. Jaimz Woolvett plays The Schofield Kid, who has heard of William Munny and how he was the meanest cold-blooded killer alive.  Munny initially declines the Kid's offer, but the Munny family is poor, and the prostitutes' bounty is tempting.

Bill rounds up old partner Ned Logan, played by the always brilliant Morgan Freeman.  You get the feeling that Ned wasn't as bad as Munny in the old days, but you also get the idea that Ned isn't as ""reformed"" as Munny.

Gene Hackman gives a superlative performance as Little Bill Daggett, the Sheriff of the town with the prostitutes.  In an early scene Daggett beats bounty hunter ""English Bob"" (played by the late, great Richard Harris) half to death, and vows to do worse to any other bounty hunter's seeking the ""whores' gold"".

Unforgiven re-writes the legend of the west.  Shifting shades of grey replace black and white.  The Man With No Name could shoot a gnat mid-flight, but William Munny takes shooting practice at a tin can with a pistol, misses several shots, then finally dispatches the can with a shotgun blast. The gunfight losers in old school westerns did their dying quickly and quietly, while a victim in this film dies slowly, in agony and begging for a drink of water.

In an expository scene halfway through Hackman explains to a hack writer (acting as a one-man Greek chorus and wonderfully played by Saul Rubinek) that the stories of famous gunfights that circulated among taverns and dime novels of the day were wild exaggerations made up by the survivors to make themselves look faster and deadlier and more noble than they really were.

Eastwood gives a master's class in film story-telling.  He tells us - then he shows us.  Every other Western appears a lamb-in-wolf's-clothing poser in comparison.  This film is the whole Wolf, and makes no apologies about it. If a greater Western than ""Unforgiven"" is ever made - I can't wait to see it.",1269216000,3,4163,4.746870653685675

103056,5,0790729644,"Clint Eastwood directs and stars in Unforgiven.  The 1992 movie is complex, it examines what is good and evil, the viewpoints of age and youth, finding courage, doing what is important while feeling guilt and yet finding redemption through change.

This is a Western set in Kansas and Big Whisky, Wyoming.  The opening scene is in Kansas and shows William Munny, a retired gunslinger, chasing pigs with his two young children, a girl and a boy.  Munny is also a widower and has to make do on his small farm.  He has sworn off gun-slinging and wild women to honor the love of his life, his wife who  died at age 29.  She turned his life around and though poor, he felt good about making up for his past life of violence, drinking and wild women.

A young man on a horse comes up to Munny.  He is the Shofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett).  He has a proposal to kill two cowboys that cut up a prostitute in Wyoming.  There is reward money of $1,000 and they can split two ways.  Munny initially refuses to help with the assassination, but realizes that it would help his children have a better future if he could afford to do something else.

After a few days he sets off with his best friend, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) also a retired gunfighter.  Ned reluctantly leaves his Native American Wife, ""Two Feathers"" to go along on the hit.  Two Feathers is near Munny's farm and agrees to check in on his children and help when they need her.

The trio get to the town of Big Whisky and find the Sheriff, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), enforcing gun control and using his power as he sees fit.  He had denied justice to the prostitutes who now want revenge and have secretly gathered the $1,000 reward money.

Thereafter the story keeps developing with twists and turns.  The mighty win over the weak.  It is a haunting story of life's and moralities ambiguity.",1266796800,,1853,4.474626865671642

103069,3,0790729644,"Wow.  Does this epic, award-winning Western look and feel like the real deal.  It's gritty, rugged, brutal, dirty, inhumane--yet tender and poignant when it needs to be.  You can't beat Clint Eastwood as both actor and director; fellow cinematic heavyweights Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, and Richard Harris give UNFORGIVEN plenty of star power.  And the story--a former bounty hunter coming out of retirement to avenge the disfigurement of a working girl--is as compelling as the day is long.  So what is it about UNFORGIVEN that so disappointed me, and continues to disappoint each time I pull up a chair to watch this very well-made film?

Dichotomy.  It's a trait we all possess, to some degree.  It's certainly present with Hackman's character as Sheriff Little Bill Daggett--a dedicated public servant on the one hand and brutal thug and bully on the other.  That's a character contrast that's believable; we can see, and understand, both sides of the coin Little Bill represents.  But Eastwood's character presents a whole new set of problems (for me, anyway).  Bill Munny is a quiet, soft-spoken, gentle widower with two young children.  From his mannerisms it becomes evident he wouldn't harm a fly; he reluctantly agrees to accept the bounty because he's so desperately poor, but approaches the job with dread and despair.  As this film moves to its violent climax the viewer is treated to such a transformation of Bill Munny that I was unable to suspend disbelief.  The wild-eyed, almost evil incarnate killer Munny became was simply too much--even after he was so savagely provoked.  Thus I was aptly disappointed in UNFORGIVEN, a great visual epic with too much to digest.

103072,5,0790729644,"When you get Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Richard Harris, and Morgan Freeman in one film you know you are in for a treat. This movie does not disappoint. Each of the actors does a superb job in each of his characters giving each incredible depth. Even Richard Harris' character is important even though he is only in a few scenes. Each of the characters both have their good traits and their evil ones. Eastwood and Freeman play reformed gunfighters turned farmers out to get one more bounty. The internal turmoil and conflict of going back to their old ways is played well by both. How violence has worn on each plays a central roll in the film. Hackman's character is the extreme law and order man who wants to control everything that goes on his town and will go to very violent means to make sure that he does.

Although this film is extremely violent in places, unlike a lot of other films it does an excellent job of showing the results of that violence on the perpetrators of that violence. They don't just walk away at ease with themselves.

The features on the blu-ray are pretty good but very dated. There is the behind the scenes feature, the interviews with the major actors, the voice over commentary, as well as a retrospective of Clint Eastwood's career up to that point. And that's the main drawback to the extras, they weren't updated for the blu-ray so they are about 15 years old.

103074,3,0790729644,"There are a plethora of reviews of the movie, but my review is mostly a comparison of the BD vs DVD version. I won't discuss its merits as a western, which is a classic and worthy of 5 stars.  This BD disk is 3 stars for its technical quality.

The BD version is worth buying if you don't own the 2 disk special edition, which has the better DVD transfer, and cost more, even after discounts! But if you own the better DVD version and are looking to own the best version for home viewing, hold on.

While the audio is crisp and clear, there is no magic in its mastering or imaging, its just clearer sound than the DVD.

The BD transfer is generally sharp, but there are moments so dull, I thought I was running the DVD version.  The high resolution of BD removes jaggies seen in diagonal lines and pixelation revealed by DVD resolution projected into a large HDTV, but this BD's colors are often washed out, and edges of objects blurred.  This lack of resolution is much worse in the night scenes including the finale scene, and is 80% less during daylight shots.  Some of the daylight shots do appear as blurry as the night shots. Unlike better BD out there, overall the background elements do not have more striking detail over the DVD. By comparison, a stellar transfer exists even in old movies.  If you are a fan of WWII airplanes, see the 1969 'Battle of Britain' or the classic 2001: Space Odyssey.

However, if you don't own the 2 disk set, this BD disk incorporates all the extras of the 2 disk set into one disk, and a better buy than the original DVD release.",1256169600,183,1570,4.367697594501718

103076,5,0790729644,"Briefly said - ""Unforgiven"" looks like a western, where two cowboys cut the face of a whore; whores seeking revenge, spread the rumor that they would pay a thousand dollar prize to any killer who would kill ""them"" cowboys; some killers could not make it and were repelled by the sheriff; but eventually killers killed those cowboys, the sheriff and his deputies. And the last man standing was of course William Munny, the killer, played by Clint Eastwood.
This is the description of the events, but ""Unforgiven"" is not about the events, it's not really a western either. This movie is about people, struggling to live some life and being always unforgiven for that. All of them had lost directions in their lives, all of them understand good and evil at some intuitive level of their own.
The movie does not depict honorable women, tough good fellows, witty winners, slick riders. Tough Little Bill is brutally tough, witty English bob lost miserably, and William Munny can hardly climb the horse.
This movie is a drama and only the final shoot out reminds about a western, but even this shoot out is depicted to be humanly slow, hesitant and dangerous. The final glance of William Munny is of course the famous glance of Clint Eastwood and yet again with the shadow of alcoholic agitation.
""Unforgiven"" is a true masterpiece.
At the end the idea of the movie is that people have to be resolute. When the common moral grounds are low the resoluteness becomes the honor, and the voyeurism of by-standers like the writer, who ""never had a gun"", becomes the utterly disgusting, ignoble.",1254268800,,1583,4.802197802197802

Watching it again in '09 after not seeing it for a few years was quite enjoyable.  In fact, this one seems to improve with age!  Truly a great film.",1253750400,,467,4.886075949367089
103078,4,0790729644,"Clint Eastwood managed to find a masterpiece of a script this time, and the brilliance of his directorship shone through. In this movie, the supposedly righteous sheriff turns out to be a brutal arbitrator, the violent, face-cutting cowboy an ordinary young man who committed a mindless crime, the celebrated ""English Bob"" a hollow underachiever and liar, and the seemingly fearless ""Schofield Kid"" a boastful but naive young man, the prostitutes a hive of hateful, vindictive beings. Eastwood plays William Munny, a supposedly reformed ex-killer and weak old man who, at the sheriff's slaying of the innocent friend accompanying him on his bounty, re-engaged in violence and vengeance and overcame even the sheriff and his deputies. In short, the one supposed to be the good guy turns out to be vicious and unconscionable, the otherwise insignificant (prostitutes) reveals themselves to be murderous, and then justice comes in the most unlikely source and form.

With a cast consisted of Gene Hackman, Richard Harris and Morgan Freeman, Eastwood got himself a movie teeming with such solid acting as to be hard to surpass in the film industry, alongside with his latter production of The Space Cowboys. This movie is also filled with supple nuances that withstand repeated viewing in appreciation of the finely crafted action sequences and cinematography. I enjoyed the little humors that Eastwood shared with the audience, such as him resorting to a shotgun for target practice after failing with a handgun, the exaggerated description of abhorring acts done to the prostitute that he describes to Freeman's character, the little standoff between Harris' ""English Bob"" character and Hackman's ""Little Bill"" character at the Barbershop, etc.

The Western that Eastwood depicts is an expansive and clean-aired one, and one could almost smell the fabric off his old jacket and the sogginess of that jail house in the rain, not to mention the wetness at W.W. Beauchamp's foot. With all the violence in this film, there is the irrepressible background premise of the human conscience, of what ought to be necessity and justice, and what truly are not.

The Blu-Ray transfer is beautiful and the sound is more detailed and dynamic. There is even a complete black-and-white episode of the 1959 Maverick TV show starring Eastwood included.

It gripped my attention within the first few minutes. The next thing I know, I was mainly focused on the concept of ""the good guys hunting down the bad guys for justice"" and I was satisfied with this concept as the film unfolded. As the film developed, I began to realize that this movie was not simply about good vs. evil or bad guys against good guys. Matter-of-fact, I really couldn't call anyone good or bad.

103085,5,0790729644,"I had not seen UNFORGIVEN for nearly a decade when I popped in my HD DVD the other night.  I'm not sure what made me decide to view it, but I'm very glad I did.  Despite all the other ""revisionist"" Westerns that have come since the time Eastwood's masterpiece won Best Picture at the Oscars...none have managed to equal it.

Recently, critics and audiences alike were saying that Eastwood's role in GRAN TORINO was the culmination of all his previous work and served as a commentary on it as well.  I was one of those people.  In TORINO, Eastwood's character achieves a kind of grace or redemption.  However, one could just as easily conclude that UNFORGIVEN was the final commentary on Eastwood's career, at least in Westerns, by Eastwood himself.  And let's put it this way...the film is well named.  Eastwood is suggesting that for those with killing in their blood, there is not redemption or grace.  Except, perhaps, the grace that comes with acknowledging who you are, no matter how terrible.

In the tiny western town of Big Whiskey, there isn't much to do back in 1880.  There's the usual general store, blacksmiths and of course, the local bar/cathouse.  Two cowboys from the big ranching organization that is the reason Big Whiskey exists at all come to visit the employees of the cat house, and when one of the ladies makes the mistake of giggling at one of the cowboys, he goes on a rampage and proceeds to cut up her face.  The hookers are outraged, and encouraged by their leader (Frances Fisher, in a remarkably fierce performance) scrape their savings together and let it be known to the world that have a reward for anyone who can kill these two cowboys and avenge this brutal act.

One who heeds this call is ""The Schofield Kid"" (Jaimz Woolvett), a young braggart with more swagger than experience.  His uncle was an old riding companion of William Munny (Eastwood), a ""retired"" killer...so The Kid looks up this legendary figure to see if he'll go with him on this manhunt.  Munny is a widower struggling to raise his two kids on a clearly failing pig farm.  His deceased wife had reformed Munny, turning him away from drinking and killing, and towards a calmer more ethical life.  However, Munny recognized that he could really use the money, and when The Kid exaggerates the extent of the harm caused to the prostitute...Eastwood uses this as a rationalization to leave his kids behind and join The Kid.  They also bring along Munny's old partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman)...another killer who has made an effort to settle down and change his life.
Back in Big Whisky, the sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman) is obsessed with keeping his town lawful.  He has outlawed all guns, yet he metes out justice with the casual cruelness of a psychopath.  A well-read, seemingly friendly and reasonable psychopath, to be sure.

UNFORGIVEN is over two hours long, and it allows the inevitable collision between Munny's gang and the sheriff's men to slowly brew.  We get to know Munny and Logan during their trek to Big Whiskey in scenes on horseback and around campfires that seem SO terribly clich&eacute;d...yet instead, they are full of dry humor, meaningful character development and beautiful scenery.  We get to know the terrifyingly bland ferocity of Little Bill as he spends a long, mesmerizing evening with English Bob (Richard Harris), an infamous gun-for-hire who has come to Big Whiskey to accept the prostitutes' challenge.  Bob has been accompanied by W.W. Beauchamp, a writer who is serving as Bob's sycophantic biographer.  Little Bill crushes the ego of one man (and his body too) and brings the other under his thrall.

In the end, there is much killing and it is in these murders that UNFORGIVEN makes its mark.  To say that the film strips the standard western theme of revenge of all its glamour would be to deny the film much of the credit it is due.  One scene in particular (I'll try not to spoil it) shows a killing that is as senseless and sad as any you're likely to see.  The person killed dies a slow, sad death...and those around him are frankly appalled at the squalidness of what has happened, including the killers.

As the film nears its conclusion, Munny observes: ""It's a hell of a thing, killing a man. Take away all he's got and all he's ever gonna have.""  On paper, this statement sounds true but not particularly brilliant.  Trust me, in the film, it resonates and pierces the heart.  Never has one line in a film so perfectly captured its own theme.  In UNFORGIVEN, when people die, we feel the consequences.  Wives that will never see their husbands again.  Guilt that will never be washed clean.  Words that can never be forgotten, even with the help of booze.  Simple pleasures of living a life that will never be enjoyed.  Dignity that will be forever lost.  Stains that will never clean.

The film holds such power, because Eastwood the Director holds total command of his tone.  He fully understands the standard development of a Western and seldom deviates far from it.  He shows that simply showing the events of a standard Western through the lens of what it REALLY would have been like strips away all the ""good vs. evil, white hats vs. black hats"" and leaves you in a murky world where all is shades of gray, and the ""good guys"" are just a breath away from being the ""bad guys.""  The film has a leisurely pace...it is not an action film.  The scenes of violence are quick and blunt.  But if you enjoy a film with a strong statement to make and a love of characterization...you'll appreciate UNFORGIVEN.  There are moments of wonderful humor, whether around Little Bill's efforts to build his own house or The Kid's efforts to be tough.  But for the most part, it is stark and bleak.  Never has being stuck in a rainstorm felt so miserable.  Yet the land is always beautiful, and it's easy to remember what would have drawn men to this part of the country...the promise that beauty held.

Everyone is outstanding in the film.  Richard Harris, for his few minutes on screen, is riveting in the way he absolutely does NOT blend in with everyone around him.  Woolvert strikes the right tone of annoying yet somehow sympathetic.  Morgan Freeman gives one of his best supporting turns in perhaps the most sympathetic character of the film.  Eastwood and Freeman sure have an easy, believable chemistry on film (see MILLION DOLLAR BABY).  Gene Hackman certainly deserved his Oscar for this film...what a toweringly great actor he is...yet he never seems to be acting.  He's one of the slyest performers we have, an actor who inhabits his characters with seemingly no effort, yet the results, even in poor films make him stand out.  And Eastwood gives a performance that is every bit the equal of his work in GRAN TORINO.  Over the years, some of his work as an actor and director hasn't always been great.  He's got a comfort zone probably shouldn't stray from (yet, as I say that, I remember how remarkably credible he was in BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY)...but when he's in the zone, his work is not only mesmerizing, it is iconic.  He has a face that is perfect for the modern western, whether that western takes place in 1880 Big Whiskey or in current day suburbia.  Eastwood is an American classic, and UNFORGIVEN ranks among his crowning achievements.

(I mentioned my HD DVD earlier...if you're watching this again someday, please try to treat yourself to the hi-def version if you can.  The scenery is absolutely spectacular.)",1249776000,8,7487,4.727623456790123

103088,3,0790729644,"There is no doubt in my mind that this is Clint Eastwood's best ever film effort and it is a testament to this movie's greatness that it has aged so well over the years and I'd wager will continue to do so for years to come.  The themes involved are timeless such as coming to grips with your true self, making sacrifices and hard choices for the good of your dependents, regret for life's past indiscretions, retribution/revenge and like in any true western justice meted out in dramatic fashion at the end as ""good"" triumphs over abject evil as personified in the form of sadistic sheriff Hackman.

This film is so great as well because it blurs the lines between what is good and evil and does man really have the right to mete justice when as Eastwood's character so aptly puts it: ""deserves got nuthin' to do with it.""  Did both cowboys deserve to die or was it just the unrepentent slasher for example?  How about Ned?  Many issues such as these are addressed in this movie and because it is not just the usual cut and dried western where the lines are clear this brilliant movie that engages the viewer on a more cerebral level makes this not only an excellent western but also a brilliant film regardless of genre to be enjoyed over and over again like a true classic should.

I've watched this film a few times and I never tire of doing so in contrast with say ""Silence of the Lambs"" which I watched recently and realised that it doesn't reward repeated viewing as much although I have to say I enjoyed it a lot when I first saw it for example.  This is why ""Unforgiven"" ranks among the top 5 films that I have ever seen.

The unfortunate thing though is the poor quality of the dvd.  The sound quality was okay at Dolby Digital 5.1 surround but the picture quality was very poor and certainly not commensurate with the sound quality.  The widescreen version side of the disc is the way to view it as the fullscreen side was pathetic as too much of the picture is excluded and for some reason the picture quality is even poorer for that side of the disc.  White spots and other imperfections appear on too many frames and the images are blurred way too often as well.

I haven't seen the Blu-ray release but as the 20th anniversary of this film is coming soon, I'd like to see a Director's cut version with anamorphic widescreen and much better restored picture quality with good special features released either in Blu-ray or standard or both versions to do justice to a cinematic masterpiece.

This film deserves a lot better medium than this very poor dvd version.  As for me, I'll wait in hope for a much improved 20th anniversary release.

Updated 23 Aug 2011:

Amazon won't let me review this separately so I'll have to do this here: the blu-ray release is a big improvement over the dvd I reviewed above as there are now special features to speak about like the making of documentaries as well as the documentaries on Clint Eastwood himself and I especially enjoyed the tv episode of ""Maverick"" with Eastwood playing the villain for a change.  The picture quality has also improved although not in all the frames as the night scenes by the campfires for example are still pretty grainy although for the most part the rest of the picture quality is pretty good.  The audio in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround is also better than on the previous dvd release although it is not reference quality.  One is left feeling that further improvement is still possible and who knows maybe we'll get a digibook version in the future that will do just that.

103091,5,0790729644,"This is the rare, modern western masterpiece that Hollywood seems otherwise incapable of producing anymore. The plot is spare. A notorious ex-killer, William Munny (Clint Eastwood), reformed by his now-deceased wife, is running an unsuccessful pig farm when he is recruited by an aspiring young gun, Kid Schofield (James Woolvet).

Kid wants Munny to join him to kill two ranch hands in order to collect a $500 bounty. The reward is offered by the prostitutes of a brothel.  One of the ranch hands has disfigured the face of one of their girls. Reluctant at first because of the memory of his beloved wife, Munny decides to join the Kid in order to collect the money in order to try to save his farm and provide for two children.  Munny then recruits his friend, former partner, and expert rifleman Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman).

Gene Hackman, as ""Little Bill"", the town sheriff of Big Whiskey, Wyoming where the crime took place is the formidable obstacle standing in their way.  He has already meted out his form of justice to the ranch hands and is not about to countenance someone else doing so.  This is vividly and violently seen in a cameo by Richard Harris who is the first bounty hunter to arrive.  Hackman's performance, combining his easy charm with a vicious ruthlessness is terrific.  He deservedly won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

The dialogue is simple and direct in the John Wayne tradition.  However, Eastwood's Munny is no Hondo out to tame the wild west.  He is a product of the dark side of his time and environment. The mood is dark (technically, sometimes the lighting is too dark).  At his age Eastwood is the perfectly grizzled cowboy and has an unforgiving, cold-eyed meanness that slowly reemerges as the movie progresses. It fully emerges in a breathtakingly violent, unrelenting brutality in the final scene in the bar at Big Whiskey where the prostitutes reside and ply their trade.

Woolvetz and Freeman are excellent in their supporting roles.  But this classic is dominated by the outsize personas of Eastwood and Hackman.  If you like the old cowboy movies, where the emphasis is on old west mores and not computer-generated pyrotechnics, you will treasure this movie as we treasure the old western mythology.",1246147200,,2256,4.884514435695538

103099,5,0790729644,"To clarify, I do not own this particular DVD.  This review concerns the movie itself.  Plot elements are vaguely revealed in this review, so don't read it if you haven't seen the movie yet.  There is a warning in the review before any potential spoilers are revealed.

People have called this film many things, dull, plodding, what have you, but they do not understand the point of it.  This film was never meant to be an action packed romp through a fictional western ideal.

This film deals with real men, imagined, perhaps, but real in their plight and manner.  Death is heavy subject matter, and this is perhaps one of the few movies that gets the point across.  There are no heroes in Unforgiven.  It is not a director's self indulgent pat on the back, either.  This film is as good as anyone ever said it was, and is by far, the most relevant story of violence told on the silver screen.  It is at times vulgar, distasteful, and flat out cold, but such was the life of this kind of man.  This was the reality of the myth, and no punches are held in laying that fact out for the viewer to observe.

After this point, I discuss plot.

There is an evolution throughout the film, where the viewer tags alongside the main character.  At first, he is innocuous, and one is lead to believe that perhaps the days are truly over, or maybe this man isn't so bad, after all.  Throughout the film, the journey follows him, and his fellow riders, as he is laid low by the plot, forcing the viewer to identify with him slowly.  You get to know his character as a man, as varied myths of the west are smashed to pieces in action and conversation around him.  Throughout it all, there is talk by many characters of just what a real killer truly is.

This man begins to grow on you, as others talk of killing, and even accomplish it, to their own ability.  Mention is made of his devotion to his wife, and the viewer is left to identify further with him, and begin to really like him, before the bottom falls out, and the man reveals the true colors of such a legend, and the monster is revealed.

The gunfight is sudden, and the killings are meant to shock.  Things are presented things actually are in such a situation.  The viewer watches as violence fuels this character to a bitter end for others, you can feel the adrenaline flowing in his veins as he steels himself after the fight, murdering the survivors and promising death to everyone who would oppose him, right on down the family line, starting with women and children.

He knows the use of fear and blood, and you can see him slump away on his horse as the moment leaves him, riding not into a sunset, but into a dark, wet, cloudy night, rain dripping off of his hat, hoping to leave town before his spell wears off of them.

This is a film about death, and the reality of death.  It does not color over the harsh reality of the men we like to idolize.  5 men killed at the end of this film feels like 500, it weighs on you, if you let yourself be absorbed by it.  This film does not idolize a gunfighter, it obsesses, it twists and writhes with the reality of the coldness and hate that is required of a killer, and the detached irrelevance of life after the act.

If you only see one western film in your life, make it this one.",1233619200,,3283,4.309951060358891
103100,4,0790729644,"UNFORGIVEN

**** Out of 5

Release Date- August 7th, 1992

Running Time- 131-Minutes

Rating- R

Screenplay- David Webb Peoples

Director- Clint Eastwood

Starring- Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, Richard Harris, Frances Fisher, Jaimz Woolvett, Saul Rubinek, Anna Levine and Gene Hackman as Little Bill Daggett

Unforgiven was Clint Eastwood's big return to the Western genre and is by considered by many as one of the all time greats of the genre and won four Academy Awards, which included best editing for Joel Cox, Gene Hackman for best supporting actor, best director for Eastwood and best picture and while Unforgiven is deserving of it's praise the movie isn't without it's flaws and quite honestly as much as I liked the movie it wouldn't make my top 5 Eastwood movies.

The screenplay by David Webb Peoples is quite solid with some really great characters. Unforgiven does feature plenty of action, but the movie is driven more by the characters rather than the action. The characters are all mostly well written for, but some aren't as interesting as others. None of the characters are boring or anything, but some work better than others. The script is well thought out and works on pretty much every level

Clint Eastwood won his first Oscar for Unforgiven and he delivers a very well made movie. As I stated even with the action, Unforgiven is much more driven by the characters and Eastwood does a great job at brining the script to life. His scenes are generally well paced and he delivers some great action, suspense and real life human emotions. The only problem I really had was the running time. I personally felt the 134-minute running time was a little overly long. While none of the scenes are filler scenes and they all add to the plot and to the characters I did feel a few minutes here and there could have been edited out and it wouldn't hurt the movie at all.

But regardless Eastwood delivers an excellent movie and the final act was nothing short of brilliant. The suspense level is excellent and while the shoot outs don't drag out, but they aren't too brief either and while the whole movie was well done I think the final act is where Eastwood really shines as director.

Besides directing and producing Clint Eastwood stars as William Munny and this might be the best character Eastwood has ever played or at least the most complex. The thing about Eastwood is he is a great actor in the sense that he's best known for that tough guy role and even in his lighter movies he still has that tough guy persona and you'll be hard pressed to find someone better at that role than Eastwood, but he doesn't have a lot of range as an actor. That isn't a knock against him since he's great at what he does, but in Unforgiven, Clint Eastwood shows more range than anything before or after this movie.

William Munny was a cold blooded killer who once married changed his ways and is seeking a sort of redemption. He knows what he's done in the past and he knows it was wrong, but what's done is done and in many ways William Munny is a broken man since the death of his wife. William Munny may not be as cool and entertaining as say Dirty Harry, but like I said he is the most complex of all Eastwood's characters. There was a lot of depth to William Munny and Eastwood really delivers a performance of a lifetime. We've seen characters like this before, but Eastwood as director and actor manages to make it seem fresh and different. Clint was nominated for best actor, but lost out to Al Pacino for Scent of a Woman, but I personally feel of all the nominated actors that year Eastwood was by far the best with a very complex character.

The supporting cast is excellent with Morgan Freeman as Ned Logan, who like Munny has done bad things in the past and is trying to put it behind him. Gene Hackman like always is great and was very deserving of his Oscar win, but I don't understand how Freeman wasn't nominated. Jaimz Woolvett as The Schofield Kid nearly steals the show as a wannabe gunslinger.

Like I said Unforgiven is a great picture and it's one of those movies as I think back to I like it even more, but still wouldn't place it in my top 5 Eastwood flicks. Unforgiven though is a really complex movie with excellent characters and like I said Eastwood is great at what he does, but doesn't have a lot of range, but here he shows all that range and more. William Munny is truly a great character and despite any problems I had with Unforgiven it comes highly recommended to Eastwood and Western fans.

The Blu-ray has excellent quality and makes the movie look like it was done recently and not in 1992. The extra features are great with some good behind the scenes, plus the documentary Eastwood on Eastwood, which is a must see for fans of the Iconic actor.",1233446400,,4794,4.544083526682135

103103,4,0790729644,"""Unforgiven"" is one of the many entries into THE American film genre. According to Clint Eastwood, the film's star and director, it ""summarizes everything I feel about the western."" And it is a fine western film, filled with fascinating characters, exciting gunfights, and beautiful choreography. The story itself is fascinating, though it is a bit slow and uneven in some places.
Clint Eastwood gives what is arguably his best performance as Bill Munny, a former gunslinger and cold-blooded killer, who's changed his ways, but agrees to collect one more bounty in order to support his two children. We see how violence can corrupt a human being, and how past demons can truly eat at him, and Eastwood plays this perfectly. Morgan Freeman, one of my all-time favorites, gives another terrific performance as Ned Logan, Munny's old partner. Gene Hackman is brutal, but also scarily likable, as the villainous Little Bill Daggett, the corrupt sheriff of the town. It isn't hard to see why he won an Oscar for his performance. The rest of the cast turn in solid performances as well, and help to keep the story both interesting and involving.
Overall, ""Unforgiven"" is a fine, if slow and uneven, entry into the genre with great performances and well-done gunfights. Fans of western and drama alike will find much to enjoy in this modern-day western.

103104,4,0790729644,"As far as grandiose Westerns go, this is about my favorite - along with McCabe and Mrs. Miller.  It's a story of two old retired gunfighters, long reformed in their ways, stepping back into the ring for one last hurrah of badness - assassination for hire.  The movie builds tension wonderfully, creates a magical vibe of reality (minus the rather cheesy acting of the young guy who plays the ""Scofield Kid""), is full of flesh-and-blood, fallible characters with whom you can empathize and whom you can hate - or be sickened by, or root for...  And best of all this movie has QUITE the payoff.  It WORKS.  Mostly Hollywood stinks.  Not here.  And frankly, Clint Eastwood rocks.  He plays his part to the T.

Okay, two more little criticisms:

1) The scene where Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood discuss sex and masturbation came out of left field and deflated the reality of the moment.  So cheesy.  Morgan to Clint, set in 1880:  ""Do you use your hand?""  WHATEVER!

2) The violence at points went a bit far for me.  Yes, it added to the drama and reality of the movie, but how many times does a guy need to get kicked in the bloody face?",1223769600,,1138,4.478048780487805
103105,5,0790729644,"""Unforgiven"" is a deconstruction of the classical Western.  There are no 'good guys', only different degrees of wrong.  The killings aren't idealized.  They are the filthy business that murder always is.  Eastwood's character, Muny, is a man with a troubled past.  He was a border raider in Kansas and Missouri during the Civil War although we never learn which side he was on.  All we know is that he was brutalized and committed atrocities.  His wife, however, tried to set him straight and he makes his life as a poor and simple farmer.

Temptation comes to him in the form of bounty money offerred for the killing of men who cut and scarred a prostitue in Little Whiskey, Wyoming.  The prostitutes couldn't get the law to arrest the culprits so they have raised money and, in so doing, they have taken the law into their own hands.  Muny, at the urging of a very young, very inexperienced wannabe gunfighter, complies.  The result is a series of brutal killings with one culprit shot to death while sitting in an outhouse.

The local sheriff, Little Bill, is, himself, a sadistic man and exacts retribution on Muny's little gang.  Muny, all veneer of civilization now completely stripped away, exacts bloody vengeance.  It's all so very satisfying which, I'm afraid, speaks volumes about our basic human nature.

This is, in my opinion, an excellent film.  Clintwood, as director, shows that his attitudes about who we are may very well parallel those of Sam Peckinpah, as in 'Pat Garret and Billy the Kid' and 'The Wild Bunch.'

103107,5,0790729644,"It's really no wonder it's taken me this long to finally see `Unforgiven'.  I've stated before that westerns were never really my thing, and it's not like Eastwood has a huge draw on me either.  He's serviceable at best in my opinion, only on rare occasions having his overly gruff mannerisms pay off with brilliance.  After the amazing year westerns in general had last year (`3:10 to Yuma', `No Country for Old Men' and `...Jesse James...' all making my top ten of the year) I figured that maybe I should research this Oscar winning classic to see if the films iconic status was justified.

Watching `Unforgiven' has really made me realize that you should never judge a film before you see it, because you never truly know what's in store for you.

`Unforgiven' opens with a sharp pain of brutality as two men victimize a woman.  When the sheriff doesn't do anything more than slap the men's wrists the women of the community put out a reward for the men's head.  William Munny, a former murderer turned caring father and widower, hears of the reward and, hesitantly, decides to pursue it in order to better take care of his two children.  Along with his former sidekick Ned Logan and an overly confident young gunslinger going by the name of The Schofield Kid, Munny makes his way into town with his horse and his gun and the smell of blood.

Eastwood really went all out with this production.  The overall feel of the film is very gritty and dark and adds weight to the moral that is brought to the full as the curtains close so-to-speak.  The film is violent, but in a repressed sort of way, allowing the majority of the film to ride on the anticipation of bloodshed and only truly rearing its head in short explosions of brutality.  This allows `Unforgiven' to become more than just an action film or a bloodbath but creates a film that is as deep and poignant as it is entertaining.

The acting is also golden here.  Morgan Freeman seems to just coast through his scenes, but his companionship with Eastwood is unmatchable.  He just has such a natural talent that even when he isn't doing anything exceptional he is still amazing.  Clint has never really sold it for me.  I was impressed with him in `Million Dollar Baby' because I felt as though he made his harshness work to his advantage.  He does that here as well.  Next to `Million Dollar Baby' this has got to be his finest performance.  Gene Hackman steals the whole show though as Bill Daggett, the ruthless sheriff.  His savagery is embellished by his sick sense of justification and that makes Hackman's character development nothing short of extraordinary.

In the end I'm pleased to say that `Unforgiven' stands up as worthy of the praise and attention it has received.  I can't say if it was the best film of the year (92 was such a fantastic year for film) but it most definitely ranks in my top ten and surely will stand the tests of time as one of the most effective westerns of all time, defining everything that makes the genre what it is.  I may not be an avid supporter of the genre as a whole, but when a western is done right it can be nothing short of amazing.  `Unforgiven' is done very, very right.",1218758400,,3181,4.528896672504378

103109,5,0790729644,"When I first saw this film, I have to admit I thought it was good, but not great.  Further viewings (including a recent one) have made me changed my mind and hang my head in shame.  This is one of the greatest Westerns ever made, and one of Eastwood's crowning achievements as a filmmaker and as an actor.

The film is uncommonly dark, even for an Eastwood film.  It starts off with a brutal rape scene, and ends with a shootout.  The cinematography is masterful, arguably the best in any Eastwood film.  Eastwood's character, Billy, is really trying to go straight after spending a lifetime of killing, whoring, and maiming.  His wife is dead, his farm is failing, and he's worried about his children.  He gets a chance to get some money, but he has to find and kill the people who raped and beat up(and got away with it) a prostitute at the beginning of the film.  Over the course of the film, Eastwood's quest becomes more brutal and darker, concluding in what has to be the best, most brooding scene in all of Eastwood's work.  The final scene takes place in the bar/brothel where the rape/assault took place.  The scene starts in a wide shot, then you see Eastwood's rifle make an entrance, but it's only his rifle.  It's a brilliant entrance, one of the greatest in Western movie history, and the concluding shootout is as menancing and as cruel as the West could be.

This film won Eastwood his first Oscar, and it's a film that deserved all its accolades.  Most Best Picture Oscar winners are rather safe and tame films, but this is one of the exceptions where an uncommonly dark film swept the awards.  It also rejuvinated Eastwood's career a bit.  He had just directed and starred in The Rookie, a film that is considered his worst film by mostly everyone, including fans (for the record, it's not that bad of a film.  Pink Cadillac is Clint's worst movie).  The Rookie was a box office and critical bomb.  So when this film appeared, it really brought Eastwood back, and he's been there ever since.  Unforgiven is considered one of the greatest Westerns ever made, and deservedly so.

For the record, buy the 2 disc special edition DVD, not the single disc edition.  The single disc edition (which is thankfully out of print) is a very poor edition, with an unremarkable, grainy transfer, no special features, and a bizarre scene selection menu that is impossible to navigate.  The 2 disc edition has an excellent transfer of the film, several excellent documentaries, including one where we see Clint making his vastly underrated 1997 film Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, and an episode of Maverick with Clint in a supporting role.",1215993600,4,2652,4.643776824034335
103110,4,0790729644,"Before I begin, I would like to give a disclaimer. Although I liked this film, I have only viewed it once and I am also I young man who has not seen many westerns. Therefore, it has not yet grown on me (as many previous reviewers have stated that it does) and also I have very little to compare this film to. With that said, on to the review...

My first impression of this film was that it was very well done. The plot of the film is thick and dark and has many parts, the main segment being the story of Will Munny (Clint Eastwood) and his companion Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman). Munny is a retired assassin in from Kansas who has decided to live a life of rationality in tribute to his wife, raising two children and working (and failing) as a pig farmer. One day Munny is confronted by a young assassin-in-training known only as ""The Schofield Kid"" about going to Wyoming to kill two cowboys who slashed a prostitute (there is a $1,000 reward put up by the prostitutes). The film, in an extremely summarized version of the extremely dense storyline, is the story of Will Munny struggling to come to grips with his haunted past.

Although I enjoyed the suspense of the film very much, there were two aspects of the film that I didn't particularly enjoy. The first was the constant use of shadowed lighting which spread shadows across the face of nearly every character in the movie and which made the film extraordinarily difficult to concentrate on. While I understand this technique is used in emphasis of the darkness of the film, I still don't think it added anything to the emotions running within the movie. The second was the use of Richard Harris' character, ""English Bob"". I didn't understand how his portion of the storyline was relevant to the rest of the movie other than to allow for an excellent soliloquoy by Gene Hackman inside the town jail. There were many more portions of the film that I did appreciate very much, especially the youthful enthusiasm of the Schofield Kid, who beautifully contrasts Will's bleak denial of his true identity with yearning for adventure.

I will probably watch this film again at some point, but even after one view, I strongly reccommend it for its dark and brutal storyline and excellent acting performances. Watch it several times if you get the chance, and let the film mystique grow on you.",1215907200,,2345,4.605263157894737

The ultimate episode of the western wilderness just before it turned so sour that your blood would curdle in your veins and your brain would either calcify into a heartless stone or liquify into a tasteless brew. The solitary cowboy is the real judge and executioner, in one word that last fatal justice maker that represents the final fate of all crooked minds that meet with their destiny in front of the barrels of his guns just before he shoots them dead with no remission, no suspension, no parole, ever and never. Fatal lethal fateful fate of a big bang death of a few trashy men who thought their violence was god's law to all others. And God came down from his heaven in the shape of Clint Eastwood and he struck them dead with the flashes of lightning of his anger. Just before these hooligans learned that women had to be respected, that plain justice, fairness and humanity require strength, righteousness and forwardness. With only one star in sight guiding their steps, the star that leads to Bethlehem and the birth of a really humane world founded on the salvation of the innocent and the damnation  of the guilty, and not the reverse. Probably the acme of western films, the final touch to be able to close a long line of inspiration that has to come to its end since the audience has now lost their innocence. When justified violence is the angry redeeming tool of gratuitous and pleasurable cruelty. But that's also the end of a myth, the myth that there is a salvation of the innocent and the weak in this savage world that could not even think of existing if it were not brutal.

Hackman's ""Little Bill"" is easily his most memorable character since Popeye Doyle in ""French Connection"" (Too bad he had to do a caricature of it a couple years later in ""The Quick and the Dead""). Cinematography, editing and most of the dialogue are also excellent.
My problem is with the plot. So Eastwood's Bill Munny, after arriving in Big Whiskey, has a dark epiphany of sorts in which he sees the harsh reality of death and the terrible consequnces of his murderous past. Yet he then almost casually goes through with the contract killings, even though he now knows that the account of the mutilation of the prostitute that he is supposedly exacting revenge for was exaggerated. To me, this makes all his dark visions and revelations meaningless; they had no effect. Despite all the pretensions of the script, in the end this becomes just another conventional western, with the ""good guy"" shooting all the bad guys. Despite all his character falws and all the nuances, in the end Eastwood is presented as just another avenging hero like his mid-seventies characters.",1204502400,,1215,5.0497512437810945

103121,5,0790729644,"Clint Eastwoods last ever western is one of the best ever made. Its not a typical Eastwood western as its take on violence and the results of violence is markedly different from the many previous westerns that Eastwood has been involved in.

Early in the film you quickly realise that this is something completly different. Eastwood's character William Munny can't even get on a horse. This scene is the first of many with a running black comedy element. Even without that element the film has other differences, such as the fact that a lot of the characters are very simple folk and as a result use simple language.

In 1992 this film was nominated for 9 oscars and won 4 of them. Gene Hackman who plays Little Bill Daggett (the town Sheriff) deservedly won the best supporting actor role for his performance. Like most films he appeared in in the late 1980's (Mississipi Burning being perhaps his best of the late 80's) Hackman's performance is memerisingly good and as I mentioned earlier in places there are some lovely black comedy moments.

We, the audience, are caught in the rain (which by the way makes you want to grab a blanket and light up the fireplace), and almost immediatly start forming opinions about the key characters including Eastwood who plays a somewhat dark character. The movie is nicely placed with a very predictable but enjoyable plot. As for the Blu-Ray aspect it is a 10 with one exception the movie is so ""bright"" at times the characters seem to become a part, or ""get lost"" in the natural shadows. Not sure if that makes sense but you will know what I mean when you watch the movie. The audio is stellar if not exciteable...you will not need surround for this one. The final gunbattle is again dark and clint seems to have no contrast to his environment.

103124,5,0790729644,"Clint Eastwood revisits his movie cowboy roots one last time in 1992's highly acclaimed ""Unforgiven."" Eastwood directs and stars as one William Munny, retired gunman and formerly notorious killer, now in unsuccessful retirement as a pig-farming widower with two small children. The opportunity to make some money comes in the person of the Schofield Kid, a young, cocky, and inexperienced gunman wanna-be headed to Wyoming to collect the bounty for a revenge killing in the small town of Big Whiskey. Munny goes along, and recruits his former side-kick Ned Logan (played by Morgan Freeman), also retired.

Big Whiskey is run by its tough-talking, preening sheriff, Little Bill Daggett, played with smooth menace by Gene Hackman. For Little Bill, the free ranging gunmen of an earlier era are meant to be a dying breed, and he runs out of town the first man who shows up to collect the revenge killing bounty (Richard Harris in a nice cameo).

Munny, Logan, and the Schofield Kid reach Big Whiskey and promptly run afoul of the sheriff.  The story is no dime novel, as Eastwood purposely deglamorizes the Western myth. Big Whiskey is barely a muddy wide spot in the road, easily run by a bullying sheriff with a big ego, who tolerates prostitution and the abuse of the prostitutes by ranch hands. Munny and Logan are well past their prime.  The final confrontation with Little Bill is fueled by whiskey and grief.

Eastwood's direction is spare and straightforward. The dialogue is laconic but authentic to the period. The cast, beyond the headlining actors, does a nice job of portraying the dreams and struggles of people in a small place. This movie is highly recommended as a masterpiece of Eastwood's movie-making art and as perhaps his last look at the movie cowboy.",1197244800,,1771,4.929530201342282

These old veterans, reluctantly, go back to their old ways after the girls of the cathouse put together a big enough ""steak"" to kill them.  Again, the movie had too much talk and not enough action.  The ending was an improvement, but by the time I got there I felt like I wasted my time.

103128,5,0790729644,"Unforgiven combines two major elements to make it the best Western ever made.  First is its brutally realistic depiction of violence and killing in the Old West.  Second is the situation of causing a reformed man to revisit the behavior of his past in order to survive.

There are no glorious killings in Unforgiven.  This movie lays to rest the notion of high-noon showdowns or fighting for honor.  Executions, ambushes, and agonizing gut-wounds are the staple methods of attack.  Alcohol, pride, and gold fuel most of the violence in the town of Big Whisky.  Most of the scenes with violence are very one-sided, further lending credence to this film.

The main character is almost certainly a wolf in sheep's clothing.  Through the efforts of his late wife, he has been able to eliminate his psychopathic tendencies, fueled for the most part by alcohol.  His sober days are blanched by regret and remorse over the people he has killed.  He is for all intents and purposes an unsuccessful farmer out trying to collect a bounty.  But when things go horribly wrong, he is forced to return to the behavior and actions of his past to survive.

103129,4,0790729644,"""Unforgiven"" certainly looks beautiful, especially in HD. And I admit it is a very good film with a lot of good points, perfect timing, excellent acting, good characters, the works. And it has a lot more nuance than westerns normally have.

But I will contend that ultimately it still boils down to the same old thing: admiration for a killer.

When William Munny, in the charismatic and handsome frame of Clint Eastwood, rides out of Big Whiskey in the end, saying that if anybody hurt the prostitutes for putting up the blood money, he will come back and kill everybody, there is pretty much not anybody watching who does not feel deep in his/her gut: ""my god, there is a MAN!"" You just can't help it, it's in our dark nature.

And you can even see this excemplified in the admiring and longing looks given him by the writer fellow and by the prostitute with the scars, as they watch him leave.

There is no way around it: it is gut-level admiration for a man who by his own admission has killed many innocent men, and women, and children, and who killed several more just minutes ago. And the film aims for it, it is where it gets its marketing power.

I am shocked that I've been unable to find any other reviewers (professional or amateur) who really question this. It is not a ""great wrong"", but there's certainly nothing beautiful about it, and it needs to be recognized.

In a documentary about Eastwood, the narrator says about Unforgiven: ""the sherif has tortured and killed Will's best friend. He has no choice but vengeance."" And that's the exact untruth to be uncovered. There is always a choice. Violence begets violence, and he who breaks the chain, wins.

Don't get me wrong, I am not villainizing ""the Clint"" here. His hyper-violent movie characters are merely reflecting an important aspect of human nature. I'm just saying it's an aspect we'd do well to look at some more.

Another way to express my problem with it: if you listen to the movie, it is clearly against violence. The characters say it many times. But if you look at the movie, it is clearly for it. The violence is presented in a way so it is enjoyable. A friend of mine said that the final big gun battle was ""like an orgasm"".

By the way, I'm just watching the documentary about the film, and DW Peoples (the writer) does say that the reason people think it's an anti-violence movie is that most other movies are ""pro-violence"" in the sense that if it is the good guy doing it to the bad guy, it's OK. But that reality is more complex, and that it's often difficult to pinpoint who's the ""good guy"" and who's the ""bad guy"". Which I think is wise. You'll notice that each participant in a fight always thinks of himself as the good guy.

I will concede that within the framework of a big, popular, Hollywood movie, this film is probably as far as we can currently go towards an anti-violence movie. If you'd made a movie like this and not made the violence seductive and aesthetic, it would instantly have lost 90% of its audience. At least.",1184889600,3,3025,4.513711151736746
103130,5,0790729644,"Clint Eastwood takes his place beside Western film-making legends John Ford (""The Searchers"") and Sam Peckinpah (""The Wild Bunch"") with this classic. Eastwood, in effect, questions the genre that made him the way John Wayne and John Ford did in ""The Searchers"" (through gritty realism). A big question you're left with at the end is ""Do these people(Europeans/Americans) really represent civilization or is there a bit more to the story?""
Great cast but even greater approach in the storytelling. ""Unforgiven"" is unrelenting realism and that is messy. Witness -- clumsy and near-sighted cowboys, outhouse assassinations, moral ambiguity, guilt by association resulting in a man's death, killing prompts remorse (and sometimes not). Essentially, very weighty matters translated to the spaghetti Western (thus showing Old West more like it was than most such films dare depict to their jingoistic audiences).
Eastwood parodies his ""Pale Rider"" character and the mythic man on the white horse through playing a domesticated gunslinger who can't properly mount his horse or stay on it that well. Gene Hackman plays the cruel yet personable and smiling sheriff who happens to be a lousy carpenter. Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris add to the exotic mix. Harris's British bounty hunter makes light of presidential assassinations, another example of the dark humor that pervades ""Unforgiven."" This film is not for laughs. ""Blazin' Saddles"" it ain't.

103134,3,0790729644,"Not a fun western. Much brutishness and grimness. No wisecracking colorful sidekick to provide comic relief. No promising union of hero and maiden at the end. No pat on the back for riding the community of desperados or crooked big wheels. No indian conflicts, dramatic train or bank robberies, nor exciting gold strikes. No wagon train hoedowns nor other pleasant social events. No Mr. nice guy whose tough when he has to be. The women are all mindless abused plain-looking whores, not glamorous dance hall queens, and are ultimately responsible for all the violence in the film. This is a message film. The main point seems to be to present a more realistic picture of life and violence in the wild west than the typical western and to deglamorize shootouts and gunslingers. Another message is  that alcohol(and by extension, some other psychoactive drugs) makes certain men violent or abusive. Eastwood's character was such a man.

  The plot surrounds conflicting ideas of the just punishment for the face slashing of a prostitute by a cowboy customer whose manhood she insulted. The saloon owner nearly decides to shoot the cowboy, but then decides to defer to the authority of the sheriff, ""Little"" Bill. Bill  initially suggests a whipping as being appropriate for the cowboy and his friend, who helped hold down the prostitute. But this doesn't satisfy the Madam, who demands a public hanging. The saloon keeper now demands a fine, payable to him, for damage to his ""property"". Bill finally decides on a fine alone. The prostitutes are incredulous at this sentence. To them this says the legal system regards them as mere property, equivalent to slaves or horses. Most viewers would probably regard a death sentence as too harsh, but a fine as too light. Perhaps Little Bill's original suggestion of a whipping would have satisfied the prostitutes after they witnessed it and there would not have been any more violence connected with the incident. This ""mistake"" left the prostitutes as well as most of the other town's people unsatisfied, and would ultimately cost Bill his life. The prostitutes offered a bounty for the heads of the 2 cowboys so as to achieve their idea of justice, and this initiates the rest of the action of this film. In a broader application, the complications surrounding this incident serves as a warning that even domestic insults and assaults can sometimes result in a cascade of revenge and legalistic injuries, jailings and murders, sometimes involving people quite unrelated to the original incident.

  This film showcases the injustices and ambiguities of vigilante justice and its perpetrators. The reformed ex-gunslinger drunk(Eastwood), who initially took up his weapons again only to make some money to help support his children and to satisfy the revenge wishes of others, eventually tranforms himself temporarily into a drunk vigilante who murdered those not involved as well as those involved in the death of his long time partner. This is but one of several incidents of unjust killings(including at least one of the cowboys involved in the slashing).

However, we have to balance this against the frequent shortcomings of legalistic justice, including the expenses involved, frequent mistakes, the influence of money, status, race and corruption, the frequent inability to identify, capture or convict perpetrators, the endless appeals and frequent dissatisfaction with sentences as too lenient or too harsh and being carried out far too long after the crime is comitted. Both have their pluses and minuses. The popularity of films where the hero eliminates the villain in a vigilante fashion suggests that vigilante justice, when done appropriately, is acceptable to many people and often preferable to legalized justice. However, the legal establishment is reluctant to legitimize it, except perhaps in self-defense cases, which are often subject to interpretation. It recognizes the gave dangers of too frequent use of vigilante justice, besides the fact that this seriously undermines its authority.",1182038400,2,4054,5.234206471494607

Extras include a 1959 episode of ""Maverick"" featuring a young Clint Eastwood - most certainly a lot sharper than seen before - this is one of the high points that add great value to this HD DVD in my opinion. Hours of other extras about ""Unforgiven"" and about Clint Eastwood and his career also accompany this HD DVD.

""Unforgiven"" isn't the ""best"" western I've ever seen, nor does it quite capture an authentic west so much as it captures a more ""studio-and-costumer"" west, but that's just me. It is a gritty western painted with vigilante justice of severe consequences, along with life-lessons, old-west style.

The performances were very nice - Gene Hackman played his character well, but I didn't quite ""get"" him...maybe a second viewing will do the trick. The story moves along a bit slowly, but plays out effectively. I didn't get ""lost"" in it, but I did like it.

The lightning is clearly a studio lamp, but the low, rolling thunder sets a nice dark mood.

103138,5,0790729644,"When talking about westerns you couldn't begin to muster a word without first mentioning Clint Eastwood. Eastwood didn't start the most popular genre in American cinema but he helped to romanticize the idea of a gunslinger with a heart of stone to people the world over with his ""man with no name"" series directed by Sergio Leoni.  My personal favorites of all the spaghetti westerns were his.  He continued this tradition when he stared directing westerns of his own like High Plains Drifter, Pale Rider, and the Outlaw Josie Wales to name a few.  He began to come into his own as not just an actor on screen but as a storyteller to.

The Unforgiven is Eastwood at his peak as a storyteller and his first real master piece as a director.  He sheds his badass, no fear, bent on revenge gunslinger persona that he made famous behind for a character with more depth.  A man with more demons and layers upon layers of baggage, fears and insecurities.  In this film Eastwood Plays William Muddy, an ex outlaw turned family man and pig farmer from Missouri.  William has a bit of a past that he has long left behind, mayhem, gambling, boozin' and of course killing folks.  His long dead wife cured him of those evils and he is just a simple yet inept farmer.  William has two youngins that he is struggling to provide for when a young gunslinger wanna be comes riding in, looking to team up with Muddy, to collect on a reward offered by a whore who was disfigured by two cowboys.

Muddy who is flat broke with children to tend to feels he has no choice and agrees to help find and kill these men but only if he can also team up with his old partner, Ned (Morgan Freeman). The three men soon find out this bounty has many more obstacles to over come besides just finding and killing these men.  The biggest being the Sheriff of Old Whiskey, Little Bill (Gene Hackman). Little Bill keep a tight hold on what goes on in his town and outlaws all fire arms in city limits.  He has little respect for assassins and hired guns and enforces his law with the most brutal of measures.

The thing that makes this film so different that the other Eastwood films is the depth of the characters, mainly Muddy played by Eastwood himself.  In the beginning he is old, out of shape and soft spoken farmer who hasn't even held a pistol in a decade.  He has lost all taste for killing and wants to leave the past where it belongs, in the past.  Muddy is not only regretful and ashamed of  his past but has become fearful of it as well.  On the servace he almost looks like a coward... but no, he's no coward.  Muddy is afraid of letting out the monster he was in his youth, knowing full well there is no turning back, if your gonna kill someone you have to be all in or all out.  His partners learn this the hard way when you set to kill a man, a bit your own soul dies with it.

The progression and transformation this character takes is amazing done and explodes in the films climax.  Eastwood took a huge chance gracing the film for an hour and a half before ever giving what the true fans want.  When Eastwood finally delivers with the goods its well worth the wait and you find out that he is meaner, nastier than you could have ever dreamed. This film has superb directing, writing, acting and pacing, nothing in this movie is off in the slightest and each character is more fleshed out and deep than any other western that I've ever seen.

This movie is about more than just badass gunslingers, this movie has a message about what killing does to a man and how few people have the stomach for it.  Even the badest of them all is kept awake at night from the horrors he's inflicted on others.

You will not find a better modern day western.  Even if you're not a fan of this genre you will enjoy this film immensely and walk away feeling satisfied.

The title of this move sums up Eastwood character to a tee...Unforgiven.  Not just by others but himself as well.  You can change yourself all you want but something you do in life will follow you and haunt you for the rest of your days.

It's ironic, but this film can be considered an anti-western, anti-violence film, because it depicts it in such a truthful and brutal way, which makes for a stark difference to the usual glorification of violence/gunplay seen in the Westerns of old.

The blu-ray transfer is just about perfect.  For the age of the film, it's quite beautiful, especially when you see the panoramic views and harsh beauty of the West the film represents.

This blu-ray disk is also loaded with extras...many featurettes about Clint Eastwood, as both a director and an actor.  There is also a full episode of ""Maverick,"" an old Western TV show, that features Clint Eastwood in one of his earlier performances.

It's gritty and its not afraid to show it.

It showed that not all heros are perfect and that there is weakness in even the strongest of men.  It even showed that even scumbags have a likeable side.  And, it even showed that sometimes a tough guy image is just a cover to hide vunerabilities.

The source is perfectly clean; all colors, as well as blacks, are pure and natural.  There is a drastic increase of detail from the standard DVD.  Every wrinkle on the actors faces shows up and in this film there are quite a few wrinkles to look at.  (High Definition never looks so real and stunning as when it is fed all the details of an aging face.)

Unforgiven was shot on film so slight and consistent film grain can be seen throughout and the picture lacks the same perfect clarity that can be found on digitally shot features.  But it is as good a reproduction of the film as it appeared in theatres as any I have seen.

Recommended to any fan of the movie who is considering upgrading their standard DVD of the film.

103145,5,0790729644,"Despite the fact he's one of the most respected actors/directors around, the films that I've seen him direct haven't really been that good for me. I despised Mystic River and I didn't get why there was so much love for Million Dollar Baby. However, most people will just end up saying ""well then watch Unforgiven"" so not being one to dismiss something outright, I thought sure, why not? Well I don't regret it one bit. While it's certainly a different western than others I've seen, that's kind of what makes it unique as well: a character-based study set in the West as opposed to outlaws tearing up the Wild West.

After being ridiculed by the size of his manhood, Quick Mike cuts up a prostitute named Delilah, leaving her face scarred. Quick Mike and his partner however get punished by the town sheriff, Little Bob, by giving up some of their ponies. Outraged at the lack of severity in the punishment, the mother figure Alice gets the other women to pool their savings and offer a bounty on the 2.

Reluctantly answering the call is William Munny, a pig farmer living with his 2 children. It's a different life for him and one he desperately needs since not only did his wife pass but he used to be a very ruthless killer once. Since the money's too good to pass up, he goes for it and along the way, he brings his buddy Ned, who's quite the sharpshooter. Only things don't go exactly as planned since not only is a no firearm policy heavily enforced but the 2 men are actually protected. For both this is not just a simple bounty and the whole thing plays out like a morality play with no clear winners.

One thing that first hits you about the film is how untypical of a western it is. Unlike, let's say, Tombstone, this town almost seems eerily quiet and without life. There's a stillness that's new to me and I liked seeing it. Reminded me of visiting my grandparent's cabin where it was just you and nothing else. It's also perfectly shot with very lush camera shots of valleys and the skies. Also, the film doesn't really have that huge gun shootout you often see. For some, it might be disappointing since gun battles are brief and not as dynamic as say, Open Range's is or other ones. It does set the film from most other ones since there's not really a melancholy but a certain relaxed feeling or a subdued feeling rather than big dynamic Wild West gunplay.

Acting of course is spot-on from Eastwood to Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman. While Richard Harris does do a great job in his scenes, the actual character can probably be taken out and it wouldn't do a huge blow to the film. It mainly shows what happens to people who try to go for the bounty or break the no firearm policy but it's not ultimately that important. Also, there's a young sidekick William and Ned take along with them that was so irritating I wish one of them would shoot him and say ""shut up already"". The pacing also might get people, since as I said, it's more subdued than the more energetic Tombstone was. Besides the might-be troublesome pacing and that annoying brat, the film's quite great regardless.

The film in a way isn't like most Best Picture winners where they're larger-than-life and big and epic but it's also well-made with surprising direction by Eastwood and a good message concerning guns. So far it's the best Eastwood film I've seen although I haven't seen Flags or Iwo Jima yet.",1169856000,2,3391,4.51628664495114

103154,5,0790729644,"'Unforgiven' is a magnificent piece of film-making, yet a dark and troubling study in violence and machismo... It revels in memorable statements of crudeness and cruelty... Munny sums it up best: ""Hell of a thing killing a man. You take away all he's got. All he's ever gonna have.""

Aided by Jack N. Green's cinematography and Lennie Niehaus's music, Eastwood gives the film an ensemble portrait of sorrowful beauty...

Clint Eastwood shows another face of the Old West... He is perfect as the unforgiven, the stone killer, whose eyes are full of brutally painful memories...

Will Munny (Eastwood) is a retired bad man desperate for the 'whore's gold' to save his shabby farm, two kids, and sick animals in the vast emptiness of the Colorado range... Munny had a monogamous devotion to the wife he'd lost, and is forced to confront his own past no matters how he tries to avoid it...

Eastwood is supported by some quite outstanding character actors whose performances are impeccable:

Gene Hackman plays Little Bill Daggett, the town sadistic sheriff who rules with an iron fist, forbidding anyone to carry guns across the town limits... He is a lawman cold as ice, who hates ""assassins and men of low character."" He also despises reward-chasers and tries to humiliate them, revealing their cowardice and indecision... In his judgment, he declines to punish a crime in a way that the hookers consider appropriate...

Morgan Freeman plays Ned Logan, Munny's longtime honest partner, who ensures the compassionate balance that keeps his friend from sinking in a self-pitying haze of recklessness and bitterness, but he also launches Will into one of the bloodiest shootout in that untamed place...

Richard Harris is English Bob, the egotistical gunfighter who desires to leave the hospitality of Big Whiskey behind him... He now lives off his publicity, and is followed everywhere by W. W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek), a writer of books, glamorizing the cover scene for purposes involving the market place...

Frances Fisher is Strawberry Alice, the outraged brothel's madam, who has raised, with a group of oppressed women she works with, a thousand dollars to anyone who punishes the two attackers who slash her working girl's face...

Jaimz Woolvett is Schofield Kid, the ignorant young rider who tries to make a name for himself... He shows up at Munny's place offering to split the reward, just for killing a couple of 'no good cowboys.'

Anthony James is Skinny Dubois, the owner of the bar and brothel, who pays good money for Delilah, and wants compensation...

Anna Thomson is the 'damaged property,' Delilah, the pretty prostitute whose disfiguration serves as the starting point for the story...

Nominated for nine Academy Awards and winning four major ones, ""Unforgiven"" becomes only the third Western ever to win the Best Picture Academy Award after ""Cimarron"" (1930/31) and ""Dances with Wolves"" (1990).

103156,5,0790729644,"Unforgiven is so good that its impression just might stay with you forever...that's the backbone of a real 5-star movie. Unforgiven is one of those movies that really deserves 5 stars among thousands that get it but don't deserve it. It deserved Best Picture of 1992 and rightfully got it.

In my recent review of this year's (2006) horror slugfest Slither, I asked what ranking those who gave it 5 stars would then give a real 5-star movie like Unforgiven. Here's some email feedback I got (colorful at times):

Someone said, ""Well you gave 5 stars to Justice League, Bugs Bunny and Tales From The Crypt."" And I responded,  ""Those weren't movies."" And someone else said, ""Well Slither was 5 stars 'in its genre.'"" And I said, ""Okay. That's fair...I guess...as long as the reader knows that your system is broken out by genre."" And the next guy said, ""Who are you to say what's 5 stars and what's not?"" And I said, ""Excellent point. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion.""

I could ramble on and debate this all day.

You see, therefore, in my humble opinion, Unforgiven is just one of those movies that has to make you question your own judgment on what you classify as ""the best""; it makes you Monday-morning-quarterback your decision to give a five star rating to some movie that simply put you in a good mood for the weekend versus the next one that came along that really deserved 5 stars.

Somewhere out there back in 1992, a reviewer's system was foiled that topped out at 4 stars. That reviewer finally gave in and added a fifth star to his system for Unforgiven. He upgraded a few pre-1992 movie's like Goodfellas and Silence of the Lambs with his new 5-star rating. But that silly reviewer is probably up to 10 stars by now in his system. So exemplifies the vicious cycle that we surely all want to avoid.

So I suggest this, fair reviewers: Lest we not be so liberal with our stars so we don't end up needing to add more stars to the point system in order to do justice to the movies that should stand alone at the top.

Unforgiven is definitely one of them.",1162425600,,2072,4.506666666666667

(Best Director, ""Unforgiven"" & ""Million Dollar Baby""), who also stars.

It also features two-time Oscar winner Gene Hackman (Best Actor, ""The French Connection"" and Best Supporting Actor, ""Unforgiven"") and

Oscar winner Morgan Freeman (Best Supporting Actor, ""Million Dollar Baby""). I've never been a big fan of westerns and never really had a desire to see this movie, until I got into the HBO show ""Deadwood"" which made me want to look back at some western films. Well, ""Unforgiven"" is a masterpiece on many levels...Not just as a western. As scripted by David Webb Peoples, ""Unforgiven"" opens as two men viciously cut a prostitute's face with a knife in the town of Big Whiskey. When the sheriff, Little Bill Dagget (Hackman) shows up he hands down their punishment. Give the owner of the house a few horses. Outraged, the prostitutes begin to offer men $1000 dollars to kill the men who did it. Jump over to Kansas and we meet Bill Munney (Eastwood, in one of his best performances), a former outlaw, who has changed his ways since getting married. But, now, his wife is dead and he's left with his two young children. One day, a kid (about 20) shows up at his house identifying himself as The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett). The Kid tells Bill about the prostitute's offer and asks Bill to be his partner; Bill quickly turns him down, but eventually changes his mind and rides out into the country to catch up with the Kid. Along the way, Bill stops at his old friend Ned's (Freeman) place and Ned joins him. The late Richard Harris co-stars as a killer-for-hire named English Bob, who's character pretty much could've been erased. Anyway, this movie is probably my third favorite film directed by Eastwood; It's right below Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby. This movie is entertaining, dramatic, and features Eastwood, Freeman, and Hackman giving some of the best performances of their careers. The chances of someone being disappointed with a film like this are very slim; this is just really one of the great movies of the last 20 years.

When Munny says ""I was lucky in the order, but I've always been lucky when it comes to killin' folk."" you know that's the reason he's survived and not that he has superhuman talent or quickness with a gun.

Also realistic is the way a gunbattle unfolds, where some of the people don't even fire, and one guy doesn't fire when he's safe and has a clear shot.  I read that nearly 1/2 of the soldiers in the revolutionary war didn't shoot at other soldiers.  The taboo of killing another human being was so strong that they would purposefully fire over the heads of the enemy soldiers instead of at them.  Some soldiers that were killed were found with many balls still in their muskets; they would act like they were firing but not pull the trigger and would have to ""reload"" to keep up appearances.",1139270400,2,1276,4.508695652173913
103171,5,0790729644,"In 1992 Clint Eastwood finally got around to filming Unforgiven, a script for which he had purchased the rights many years earlier. It is a thoughtful, uncompromising look at how violence begets violence; and that the traditional line between the good and evil is not as clear as it appears on the surface. For film buffs impressed by Oscar, the film won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Supporting Actor for Gene Hackman, who turns in one of his finest performances as the town sheriff Little Bill.

  This tale of retribution begins in a town called Big Whiskey with a drunken cowpoke named Quick Mike slicing up a whore named Delilah's face, after she giggles at size of his male anatomy. When the other prostitutes led by Strawberry Alice (Francis Fischer) go to Little Bill seeking redress, he lets the offending drover and his partner Davey off with a mild punishment that includes the price of a few horses. Incensed at this miscarriage of justice, the women take up a collection to establish a thousand dollar bounty for anyone who will kill the two ranch hands.

  Upon hearing of the blood money offered, a fledgling, young gunslinger calling himself The Schofield Kid arrives at the farm of William Munny (Eastwood), who is raising two children without a mother and struggling to make ends meet. The kid informs Munny he is seeking his services as paid assassin. Munny subsequently enlists his former partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) and the trio set off for Big Whiskey to snuff out the unsuspecting cowboys.

  During the long ride to their destination, it is poignant foreshadowing when Will reminds Ned of his wild days as remorseless killer. He vividly describes his ruthless killing of an innocent drover that weighs heavy on his conscience. Nevertheless, Munny reflects that his deceased wife forever ended his drunken, murdering ways with Ned reassuring him that, ""You ain't like that no more"".

  With intelligence supplied by Skinny the Saloon owner, Little Bill discovers that the whores are offering a reward for the two ranch hands. Acting swiftly, he musters his team of deputies and after nearly beating him to death, sends another bounty hunter named English Bob (Richard Harris) packing. When Will and his comrades arrive in town, the sheriff also inflicts a savage beating on him while he is too sick to defend himself. In spite of this setback, the trio manages to kill Mike's friend Davey in a heart wrenching sequence, which is enough to inspire Ned to forfeit his share of the bounty and head home. Unfortunately, Logan is captured and tortured to death by the sadistic Little Bill.

  Eastwood the director masterfully demonstrates how unglamorous a killing can be when Schofield shoots Quick Mike while he is using the outhouse. We learn the ultimate irony is that the kid, anxious to prove himself as a bad man, has absolutely no stomach for the taking of a life. Chillingly, it is Will, who after a few swigs of whiskey has no problem transforming back to the precision killing machine of his earlier days. When he discovers that Little Bill has taken Ned's life, Munny slaughters the sheriff, his deputies and the saloon owner who was foolish enough to display Logan's body in front of his establishment.

  This film is a masterwork of understanding the complexities of human behavior. Though Will Munny is supposed to be the unforgiving killer, he is the protagonist of the story. In a scene acted with near perfection by Eastwood, he wisely reflects to the kid, ""It's a hell of a thing, killin' a man. You take away all he's got an' all he's ever gonna have."" When Schofield attempts to justify his actions, he suggests to Will, ""Well I guess they had it comin"", to which Munny succinctly replies, ""We all have it comin kid.""

  Though he represents law and order, Little Bill is clearly the antagonist who blindly believes in his own righteousness. When he is gunned down by Will, he incredulously exclaims, ""that I don't deserve to die like this"". Ultimately, it is Munny who has the clearest sense of purpose and in the face of overwhelming odds, remains cool under fire. He teaches Little Bill his last lesson; that deserve has got nothing to do with it.",1136332800,4,4236,4.839335180055402

Instead, Clint Eastwood has produced, directed, and starred in a piece that is both incredibly sensitive and has some of the sheerest brutality I have ever seen in a film, Western or otherwise.

There is some grade-A talent, including Morgan Freeman as William Munny's (Eastwood) old partner in crime, Ned Logan.  Gene Hackman is Little Bill, a sheriff who runs his town like a moralizing despot, using bad means to achieve good ends. And the great Richard Harris plays an outlaw called English Bob, who runs into the bad side of Little Bill.

The story is about a group of prostitutes who put out a bounty of a thousand dollars for two cowboys who cut up the face of one of the women.  Munny leaves his solitary life to collect the bounty when a brash young gunfighter asks to partner with him.  The whores, eager to avenge their friend's disfigurement, do not know they are about to bring a demon, Death on a Pale Horse, down upon the town.

  Gene Hackman is great as the law man ""Little Bill"" Daggett, who has a dark side that is much darker than most villians that you'll find.

The fact that this movie won 4 academy awards including best director, best picture and best supportng actor (Gene Hackman) should make you watch it. Clint Eastwood directed and starred in this western with a great cast and a great moral. Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman, 3 of the best actors ever, now all past 50 years of age, are united in this masterpiece. That should also make you want to see it, because you see these absolutely extraordinary actors all in one extraordinary movie, together.

The film opens with a brutal scene, in which a man badly cuts up a prostitute in her face. He does this because she laughed at ""the size of his pecker"". The man and his accomplice are then released without any physical punishment with only a fine as their punishment by Lil Bill (Gene Hackman), the sheriff.

On top of it, the owner of the place doesn't care about the prostitute, and just cares about losing money because of one of the prostitutes' face. But, the other prostitutes can't live after what happened to their friend. So, they combine their money to form $1000.00 and place bounties on the two men's lives. But Lil Bill and his troops are prepared to stand their ground in their town of Big Whiskey.

And then come Ned (Morgan Freeman), William (Clint Eastwood) and Schofeild Kid. Ned and Will are partners that used to be killers. The Kid claims that he's a killer and acts tough. All of them need that money.

But Lil Bill is a corrupt sheriff and a violent man that ridiculizes anyone trying to kill the two men. Gene Hackman is absolutely brilliant and definitely deserved that academy award. He is a violent man that thinks that he can use this violence becuase he is a figure of authority. After beating up English Bob, a man trying to kill the two men for the money, Bill calls him the Duck instead of the Duke in a highly comical scene that is very memorable.

William is a troubled man, traumatized by his killings. He is scared of death and is a poor soul that misses his dead wife.

The movie is so excellent because of the cast, the character development and the execution of the movie. The characters are brilliantly made. Lil Bill is a corrupt man and usually is the vilain. William is the protagonist and hero of the movie but at times, you feel horrified by all of his murders in the past but do pity him also. He's a haunted man trying to change and erase all of the bad he has done. But in the end of the movie, he ends up needing to confront this and needs to decide whether to stop doing what he did or continue doing it.

Schofield Kid is a character that is a mystery. He acts all tough but deep down inside, he ends out being a puny little guy trying to disguise his real self for the whole movie and adventure.

Ned is brought to life by Morgan Freeman and seems the sweetest and most sensitive of the trio. And of course, you've just got to love the amazing Morgan Freeeman.

This movie is a masterpiece with an excellent moral and that needs to be seen. It is in my opinion the best western EVER MADE that is usually sad, funny at times and ends out being a unique and memorable film that should be purchased and rewatched and cherished forever. Movies like this are hard to come around so we should cherish it.",1120780800,3,3335,4.400974025974026

103187,4,0790729644,"Let me begin by saying that I enjoy Clint Eastwood movies.  It has been my observation that he doesn't make a bad movie.  I also appreciate his talent as a director; ""Mystic River"" is a masterpiece example of his skills in my opinion.  However, I have been puzzled by all of the accolades for ""The Unforgiven"".  For me it was actually a disappointment to watch after all of the advance praise I had heard.  It IS a good movie but I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more if I had seen the movie before any of it's reviews.

The basic story is that of some prostitutes that want revenge on a man who disfigured one of their co-workers.  The town's tough sheriff (played excellently by Gene Hackman) isn't going to do anything about it so the girls offer a reward for someone who will.  A young wannabe gunfighter convinces Clint Eastwood's character to come along and cash in on the bounty.  Along the way they pick up Eastwood's old pal played by Morgan Freeman.  The movie basicly ambles on from there to the ending.

 There is a lot of good acting and the movie does its' best to dispel the myths of the Old West by the many characters and incidents involved.  I guess that was the purpose of the movie but in the process of doing so, it seemed to want to displace excitement with boredom.  As a result, it slowed down the movie quite a bit without offering much in drama to replace the action.  Some might say I'm missing the point but I think of ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" as an example of an outstanding anti-war movie that still appealed to many for all the military action and drama that it offered.  Eastwood's character goes through the movie looking like he's overdosed on Valium.  His climatic finish seems only to have been accomplished by a change of depressants.

I said that this is a good movie and I did find a lot to enjoy.  For me the best scenes were those involving Gene Hackman.  His was the strong presence that good Westerns are noted for.  Although he came across as the bad guy, his role made this movie as good as it got.

I watched the Oscar ceremonies for 1992 and I cheered for Clint Eastwood to win the Best Actor award.  I was sorry that he didn't because it seemed like this might have been his last chance for the prize.  However, I knew that I was cheering for the actor and not for the role.  I think that the praise for ""The Unforgiven"" was largely for the man and not the movie.  Watch it and see for yourself.",1117411200,6,2445,4.318681318681318
103188,5,0790729644,"`Unforgiven' is an absolute masterpiece of film, and represents not only director and star Clint Eastwood's most mature work, but also the coming of age of the Western. It completely eliminates the simplex white hat/black hat, good guy/bad guy theme so common to Westerns. In its place, it gives us rich, fully drawn characters painted in the muddled shades of gray that characterize real life rather than the black and white of myth. And while it has abundant violence, it strips it of all of its glamour, and presents it as the stark horror that it is.

The film deals extensively with the disconnect between what we are, and how we view ourselves. William Munny (Clint Eastwood), a bad man reformed by the love of his now deceased wife, is haunted by his past of cold blooded killing. Even as he takes on a final job of assassination to save his failing farm, he continually tells himself and everyone around him, ""I ain't like that anymore."" His  companion, The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), is young, dumb, and owns a gun, and is blustering and cocky about what a deadly killer he is until confronted with the actual deed. English Bob (Richard Harris) fancies himself a sophisticated, refined, gentleman shootist, but is soon revealed to be little more than a mannered bully and crude killer. Little Bill (Gene Hackman), sheriff of Big Whisky, believes himself to be a tough but fair enforcer of justice, and believes that he is different - more righteous, than the toughs that he confronts. Yet Little Bill harbors a deeply sadistic rage that can be deadly, and just as ugly as any outlaw's deeds. Finally, the working girls that contract to kill the offending cowboys see themselves only as seeking justice, and are blind to the fact that what they really want is not justice, but vengeance.

`Unforgiven' reinvents how violence and killing are presented in Westerns. In the traditional Western, the villains are demonized to the extent that when they are killed by the heroes, we feel exhilaration and triumph, devoid of any of the inherent horror of the act. Not so in `Unforgiven', where each killing is felt like punch to the gut. When each character is shown in all their humanity rather than as a gross caricature, it is impossible for us to cheer their deaths. Eastwood's William Munny sums up the heart of the film when he says to the Schofield Kid, ""When you kill a man, you rob him of everything that he has, and everything he's ever gonna have."" In a final shoot out scene, Munny ties together the themes of the gruesome nature of killing and our self deceit about our natures, when a man he is about to kill says to him, ""I don't deserve this"", and he replies, ""We all deserve it,"" as he dispatches him.

`Unforgiven' stands as a landmark in the history of Western movies. Like John Ford's great film, `The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance', it explodes the myths and easy conventions of the genre, and presents us with complex moral questions rather than simple, pre-digested answers. It is well written, with brilliant performances, and beautiful cinematography - a masterpiece of its genre. If you are ready to see Westerns grow up, you must see this brilliant film.

103189,4,0790729644,"UNFORGIVEN is marvelous moviemaking.  Clint Eastwood's direction and performance are haunting, evocative and original.  Avoiding a lot of the standard western cliches, Eastwood has fashioned a dark character study in which one's past resurfaces and no matter how hard you try to justify it, the truth wins out, and once you've killed, it's not so hard to do it again.  Clint has assembled a fine supporting cast as well:  Morgan Freeman (who would later work with Clint and win an Oscar in ""Million Dollar Baby"") is fine as Ned, Clint's former partner who joins him for one ""last"" job; Gene Hackman won an Oscar for his portrayal of Sheriff Little Bill, whose moral code is singular and unquestioned; Frances Fisher (a former Mrs. Eastwood) as the rebellious prostitute who wants to mete her own kind of justice; Jaime Woolvetz as the young gunfighter who idolizes Clint and killing; Saul Rubinek as a writer who finds out the truth isn't always what it is said to be; and Richard Harris as British Bob, an English assassin with tales taller than the Sequoias.  Although I found the film to drag in places, it's finale is riveting and Clint is reminiscent of Dirty Harry Callahan in his showdown with Hackman.

103190,5,0790729644,"This is Eastwood's best film, a purely adult western epic. It is a gritty portrayal of the real west of the 1880's. Eastwood plays an aging reformed notoriously violent and alcoholic outlaw who has reformed due to the love and care of a ""good woman"" who has long since died. Widowed with children and down on his luck, Eastwood is tempted to ride again one more time for a money stake to help his family escape his failing economic situation. The story intially takes place in a fledging frontier twon called Big Whiskey, Wyoming. The film starts abruptly and violently as a cowboy defaces a prostitute, termed ""whore"". He and his less guilty and innocent partner are pardoned by sheriff ""Litle Bill"" who, in ironic contrast to once bad guy Eastwood, has a violent, spontaneous sadistic temper. The whores are taken back by the injustice and they place a bounty on the heads of the cowboys and that sets the stage for Eastwood's rentry into one last violent run with the aide of his longtime and also reformed colleague played by Morgan freeman. The two reformers killed and robbed many years ago and are rusty mechanical and with the business of committing violence that is slowly evident. Sparking Eastwood back to this mission is the young punk nephew, played by very well by Jaimz Woolvett, of an old friend who seeks out the legendary killer William Muney (Eastwood) to assist in killing the cowboys and collecting the bounty. And there is the seeds of your story, a reformed rusty old gunman with his veteran partner catching up to a young hot headed kid headed for a collision with Sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman). The ironic twist is that good guy Hackman can break into an abusive violent rage that Eastwood gave up in his past along with, perhaps the fuel that opened him to violence, alcohol.

The other irony is the introduction of a writer who folows, with limited loyalty, one legendary western folk heroe after another, writing stories that he later finds could be contrived or gross exagerations, which the writer even allows may be exagerated even when the real truth is known. Like many a true alcoholic, Eastwood can barely remember his past (reformed alcoholic comic actor Sid Ceasar wrote in his biography that he suffered blackout and couldn't remember his own best skits) but everyone else can as his past ; however incredible, was fact not fiction. This film is a sensitive portrayal of the wst and two different men, Eastwood and Hackman, ironically trying to live peaceful lives that collide violently due to circumstances. This is not an action film, although there is plenty at the end, but an adult look at life and death where killing is not easy, simple and without remorse and people simply don't die suddenly and disappear like in a Rambo movie.

The climax builds into over the last 30 minutes and the action suddenly accelerates as Eastwood is forced to take on a vengeance role, transforming to his past, as he contemplates his direct confrantation with Hackman, two men now with the equal potential for extraordinary violence. Some people miss the point of this film, thus it is worth watching at least twice. Individuals don't always react heroically to confrontation, as Hackman's Little Bill character points out during the early part of the film, and when confronted with a truely violent and notorious outlaw, you will see different reactions unfold, that although a movie, they are not too surprising.

The dialogue is vintage Eastwood, a lot said in a few words, and those lines are memorable such as when the kids says ""I guess he had it coming"", Eastwood responds, ""We all have it coming kid"".

Richard Harris is also excellent as ""English Bob"" and his encounter with Hackman early in the film helps reveal the true character of Little Bill, his good and efficient side and the uncontrollable temper that can erupt.

103192,5,0790729644,"""Unforgiven"" is no more a western than ""Citizen Kane"" is a biography. To reduce such complex films to such simple classifications would be to overlook everything important in them. ""Unforgiven"" is equal parts morality play, psychoanalysis, social critique and character study. But most of all, like ""Citizen Kane"", it is tragedy. It strives to show its central characters brought to ruin or death through tragic flaws: people doing horrible things not because they are evil, but because they cannot or will not overcome the worst of their natures. Eastwood's genius consists in his taking character flaws and turning them into moral flaws. This is the meaning of the title--what could easily have been called ""Unredeemed"" is transformed into ""Unforgiven"", because the rejection of redemption is unforgivable.

This extra insight is what makes the film great and allows it to transcend its genre. Prior to ""Unforgiven"", many westerns had already adopted the conventions of noire and showed anti-heroes unredeemed, riding off into the sunset, in no sense good men but generally none the worse for having killed others. In ""Unforgiven"", Eastwood shows us men who lose pieces of their souls every time they kill, and he doesn't shrink from applying this imperative to the anti-hero himself. Munny loses not only his old friend Ned, but the redemption that his wife had gifted him and that he had earned in turning his back on his past. This is the boldest statement that a man like Eastwood could make--as a director Eastwood figuratively disavows the characters that made him famous as an actor. This is no Man With No Name or Dirty Harry wreaking divine vengeance or cathartic retribution. This is a man who, in accepting his last bounty, kills unjustifiably, causes the death of a friend, and surrenders forever the right to forgive himself.

Eastwood would go on to make further films of incredible depth and stature. It is one of the most wonderful things to see a man, late in life, transformed from a one-note actor into a virtuoso director of subtle and almost infinite expression. ""Unforgiven"" is the first in a string of Eastwood triumphs, many of almost Shakespearean depth. But ""Unforgiven"" remains Eastwood's most well told story and richly deserves the boatload of awards that it harvested.",1114300800,7,2300,5.082010582010582

English Bob is not on the screen long but Harris puts in a tremendous, and very memorable, performance.  Hackman's Little Bill is haunting and you'd honestly have to say that Eastwood is nearly as good as his depiction of William Munney is subtle and flawless.  The ending blazes and Clint gets in a few top notch oneliners like, ""Anyone who doesn't want to die can go out the back.""  Ah, this film has been great every time I've seen it.

Was this one the last of the great westerns?  Yes ""Unforgiven"" certainly is wonderful, but hopefully it won't be one of the last of its kind.  There's still energy in this genre and I'm hoping that more movies like it are made in the future.",1107648000,,986,4.5
103195,5,0790729644,"I don't consider myself a particularly big fan of Clint Eastwood, at least as an actor. To me, he always seems to play the same kind of character in nearly every movie he's in. Occasionally, he'll find some fresh notes to play within his narrow range, but, despite his legendary status in Hollywood, I would hardly classify him as one of the finest actors of our time (although that probably won't stop Hollywood award shows from honoring him for Lifetime Achievement awards and such). That said, with the films that he's directed that I've seen, I'd dare to say that he might be a better director than actor. I have yet to see his most recent (and much-hyped) film MILLION DOLLAR BABY, but I was deeply sobered by his near-great MYSTIC RIVER (despite its total washout of a mystery plot), and, seeing this Academy Award-winning 1992 film recently, I was no less impressed by this film.

UNFORGIVEN is as de-glamorized a Western movie as you are likely to see. There is no real nobility to be found in any of these characters the way there was with, say, Gary Cooper's Will Kane in HIGH NOON. Eastwood's William Munny, for example, is not a hero, but a broken-down, desperate man who is trying to escape his troubled past. Visually, there are some beautifully pictorial shots of the wide open spaces of the plains bathed in (rather mild) sunlight, but most of the time Eastwood and cinematographer Jack N. Green light the proceedings in a doom-filled atmosphere that might come off as heavy-handed to some, but is totally befitting its theme: how physical violence can be violent to the human soul. On the level of action, there is no exciting buildup to the final showdown, and even as it occurs, there is no glamor to be found, no catharsis. Instead of exhilaration, there is a profound note of tragedy as this film ends. A lot of action movies make you believe that taking violent revenge on someone is a satisfying way of closure. In UNFORGIVEN, Eastwood makes clear that there is no real satisfaction to be found in any kind of violence, provoked or not. This is perhaps an important film to see simply as a startling corrective to all the soulless spectacles of violence that seem to be the trademark of action films these days, movies that make you cheer violence and gets you in a sadistic mood, whereas Eastwood stresses its ugliness, both physically and mentally.

UNFORGIVEN is helped immensely---for once---by Eastwood's own performance. Technically, he approaches his role in basically the same way he did with his Man With No Name performances in those Sergio Leone spaghetti Westerns---tough, gruff, distanced. This William Munny is not much of a stretch for him. And yet there is an extra weariness to his performance here; you get the sense that he is trying to resist his more violent impulses, that he is always trying to tell himself, ""I'm just here to get money, I'm just here to get money."" Eastwood also has one scene which seems to cut through his steely persona: as he is in the midst of a delirious fever, there is a real, poignant touch of desperate emotion in his voice as he exclaims that he sees his own late wife, among other delirium-induced visions. That one scene is perhaps the closest I've seen Eastwood as an actor approach some emotion other than just anger. The other performances are good, but Eastwood's, in its own way, is rather special.

UNFORGIVEN is admittedly a little plodding, but then Eastwood has never been one of those showboating directors who indulge in style for its own sake. He is more concerned with characters than with mere action here, and his deliberate approach to the material gives his themes room to breathe and grow in the mind of the receptive viewer. This is a powerful examination of the ugliness of violence, and it will certainly stay with you after it's over. Recommended.",1105142400,4,3846,4.7458893871449925

103197,5,0790729644,"In Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" (1992), there is no ethical code associated with the classic Western, no simple moral of good versus evil. It is an unromanticized depiction of the West in which every bullet - and every death - has meaning. ""Unforgiven"" is a culmination of the dark themes that director Eastwood has explored in ""High Plains Drifter"" (1973) and ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" (1976). He pays homage to the stark poetry of the Western while staking his own territory of uncompromised reality. The distortion of justice in ""Unforgiven"" is reminiscent of the tragic, wrongful hanging in director William Wellman's ""The Ox-Bow Incident"" (1943) - both films confront the horrible consequences of murder and how the killers must live with it. In his final Western, Eastwood shows that the genre can be given new life through provocative explorations of myth and legend, along with an intelligent script and sensitive direction.",1098576000,4,932,5.22

103199,5,0790729644,"In the twilight of Clint Eastwood's career an epiphany came to him.  The western types that he played in most of his films were essentially bad people.  This film is something of an atonement for those films.  His character, William Munney, after a life as a killer, is amidst his new life following the death of his sainted wife as an unsuccessful farmer.  Word comes to him that in a nearby town that a prostitute was mutilated by a some cowhands and a reward is being offered by her co-workers for the murder of the cowpokes.  Munney rationalizes taking up this offer by thinking that these boys are vicious and deserve to die and that doing so would not make him a bad man.  Before Munney can collect his reward, though, he has to get through the peace-loving sheriff, Little Bill, who will make sure nobody collects on the reward no matter how many beatings he has to administer.  The cynic could say that Eastwood made his bread and butter off violent western types and this is an attempt to cater to politically correct types.  I give Eastwood the benefit of the doubt here because this may be the best performance of his career and this film is so well crafted.  Gene Hackman is more than his equal as the sadistic sheriff.  The beauty of the western is that it is always being re-evaluated and this film stands at the top of the list of great westerns.",1095984000,3,1361,4.473684210526316
103200,4,0790729644,"Clint Eastwood's 1992 somewhat apologetic western on crime and justice in the Old West.  Although well acted with good direction, the film lags in its rather predictable plot and suffers from uninspiring action scenes.

The film starts with the senseless mutilation of a prostitute in the town of Big Whiskey.  Anxious to keep the peace, Sheriff Little Bill Dagget (Gene Hackman) asks the perpetrator to compensate the victim with several horses.  Humiliated and permanently disfigured, the prostitute isn't happy with the offer and raises a bounty for the death of her attacker.  With news of the bounty, widowed Bill Munny (Clint Eastwood) leaves his family behind to get some badly needed money. A retired gunslinger left with a delapidated farm and a bleak future for his two children, Bill Munny returns to his life of sin one last time.  He soon joins up with his old friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) who's also leaving his reformed life for one final reward.  On their way to Big Whiskey, Munny and Logan are joined by The Shofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvet), a young hothead who also needs the reward. When the characters arrive in Big Whiskey, they run into gunslingers such as English Bob (Richard Harris)and the impatience of Sheriff Little Bill.  Wanting to keep the peace at all costs, the sheriff will do whatever it takes to keep hired guns out of Big Whiskey.  An unexpected incident leads to a final confrontation between the main characters.

Eastwood attempts several things in this film with mixed success.  First, he attempts to break away from the reverse trends in westerns he himself helped form over 30 years before in Sergio Leone's action-packed films.  In those films, the West was depicted as a wasteland of shady characters who could be either villains or heroes depending on the reward: the theme was presented through symbolic action sequences as opposed to extended and unrealistic dialogues using action as only the filler scenes.  In this film, Eastwood sacrifices action for more character study found in some of the older westerns preceding Leone's: the main difference being that characters' motivations are treated with much more realism than those presented in such earlier films. In this film, Eastwood shows that all of the characters are flawed in various ways.  The bounty hunters don't really care if their cause is just as long as the reward is payed; they simply justify their motivations post factum.  The sheriff is a man with honest intentions and his actions, although perhaps varying between inadequate and extreme, are solely in the interests of the community.  All of the characters are victims of their environment who must cope with the realities they are presented with.  Even the actual victim in the film, the prostitute, is depicted as a person who suffered from the consequences of her own immoral profession as opposed to the actions of a deranged criminal.

Although this is a good film, I found it to be overrated and  actually less creative than Clint Eastwood's other great western, 'The Outlaw Josey Wales.'  I felt that the latter actually had more character insight and thematic depth than this film even though it didn't have as many stars.  In his attempt to be more sober in portraying the real West, Clint Eastwood seemed to fall in the same trap as earlier westerns by drowning the plot in over-the-top character/psychological studies of people who, realistically, weren't the types to intellectualize things too much. Although I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood's westerns, this is one which I haven't bothered to buy for the reasons cited: I think it tends to make a better rental.",1093219200,2,3648,4.976935749588138
103201,5,0790729644,"This motion picture is a realistic look at the way things were.  Gunfights were not fast draw contests out in the street at high noon.  The classic response, when told he had shot an unarmed man, ""Well, he should have armed himself,"" is close to the reality of the situation.  The motion picture has excellent acting and deserved academy awards.

The motion picture deals with the question of white slavery, i.e., holding women in bondage as prostitutes.  This practice continued into the 20th century.  Their pimp questions how they obtained money to hire gunmen, who are brought in to take vengence on two men they hold responsible for disfiguring one of the women (note that no punishment was meted out to the men, other then making them reimburse the pimp for the value of the woman - an indication of the prevailing attitude).

The gunmen are two paid assassins, coming out of retirement to earn some much needed money, plus a young man thinking to make a name for himself.  The story deals with tracking down their assigned targets, executing them (don't expect a fair fight, one gets whacked while sitting in an outhouse), and the aftermath.  Life will not be the same for the survivors, and the Eastwood character rides off into the sunset and back into obscurity.

Anyone wanting to study the real west, rather than the make believe usually presented, should watch this motion picture.  It is intended for mature audiences, so I would rate it PG-13.",1093046400,3,1458,4.792
103202,2,0790729644,"It's extremely common in fiction writing to have the characters undergo personality changes from the beginning of the story to the end.  This movie just takes that concept to its logical extreme, where every one of the three main characters turns out to be the opposite of what they first appeared to be.  It's just too predictable.  It's also just dull.  The whole ""English Bob"" storyline serves no purpose at all, I find it puzzling why a story would throw in what appears to be a main character, only to then shut him down completely and have him ridden out of town on a rail. It's to show how mean Gene Hackman's character is,  but it could have been done much better and with much less wasted time.  The writer who seems to be in the movie only for comic relief is another waste of time.  He's not really funny, just predictable.  Just another character undergoing personality changes, from naive writer to experienced opportunist.  And the ending wasn't nearly as satisfying as just about any other Eastwood film you care to mention.  It was too concerned with Clint's character's personal journey from responsible, hard-working pig farmer to whiskey drinking gunslinger to worry much about impact.  In short, it was like reading a very long novel where the whole climax is on the very last page of the book.  If we read a thousand page book, we need at least a 100 page ending, not something so quick as this.  Considering all the time that's been spent delving into every facet of Hackman's character, he wasn't really much of a player in the end.  Just another guy.  It had a real deus ex machina feel to it - they spent the whole movie showing Clint as an old (62 years old in  real life, and he looked it) pig farmer who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with a six shooter, then at the end, well, lets just say all that character establishment didn't have anything to do with the ending.  The only character development seemed to come from taking up whiskey drinking again, which improves one's reflexes and aim apparently.  There are the usual quotes, ""I don't deserve this"", ""Deservin' ain't got nothin' to do with it"", but after sitting through this long dull thing, they don't have the usual impact.

I have to agree with the others who have said that all the awards this movie gathered are more of a lifetime achievement award for Clint.  He deserves them for a lot of movies he's made, but certainly not this one.  This isn't nearly as good as Josey Wales, Pale Rider, etc.  The pacing is entirely fouled up, the characters are stock, almost cliched (especially Morgan Freeman), There's certainly nothing here that we haven't seen before on a hundred episodes of Gunsmoke.",1092009600,5,2694,4.627368421052632

But the emotion by itself is not enough to hold a film . The hero is tired , he is an outlaw , he accepts the challenge to rescue a little town in a nosthalgical mood who reminds too much to The Seven Samurais dramatic structure but in a twisted gaze . Because Kurosawa approach represents a sociological study of the epic spirit ; this movie goes in the opposite side . Eastwood is not convinced about anything , the dialogues intend to express deep reflections about a long time gone . The role of the young boy trying to grow up in this journey has been told many times before and with major virtues . Freeman is OK and Hackman is a villain too much predictable .

It is worth several viewings over a lifetime as is ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" with Clint Eastwood.

 However, I must admit that I have encountered friends/family that don't like this movie. However, it is usually that they don't care much for westerns and prefer other types of movies like romance movies. I have found that some women don't care for this movie and don't like it. This film is more of a film for men. The film is violent, but I didn't find it too graphic so I think it is okay for teenagers 13 and up. Most kids younger might find it boring.

He and The Schofield Kid are joined by Munny's old partner (Morgan Freemen) as they set out on their journey. The only thing that stands in there way is the sinister sheriff (Gene Hackman) of a small town

Unforgiven is a unique western in that where most westerns glorify violence and bloodshed, Unforgiven examines the psychological effects of violence, the finality of murder, and the fragility of life. One death, in particular, is drawn out and made quite unpleasant without being gratuitous. The film is meticulously paced, which allows the viewer to think and reflect on how easily violent acts can be committed and the impact they have on the perpetrator and those close to the victims. Munny is haunted by the ghosts of those he has killed. Having committed the act of murder, The Schofield Kid is horrified and disgusted with himself. Gunslinging isn't what it's cracked up to be.

David Webb Peoples's original screenplay allows the film's characters to develop and break free of their western clichs. Eastwood's character represents a deconstruction of his famed tough guy career. Eastwood sheds his ""Dirty Harry"" persona to play a man who has grown weary and regretful of the crimes and the murders he committed in his past. Jaimz Woolvett plays The Schofield Kid, a character who - on the surface - appears to be the formulaic cocky gunslinger; but is actually a richly developed character with many unseen truths. Gene Hackman, Morgan Freemen, and Richard Harris round out the superb cast.

Unforgiven's impeccable period detail greatly adds to the film's realism. The lack of vibrancy in the film's color palette and the heavy use of shadows greatly contribute to the state of the dismal characters and the heaviness of the subject matter.

Unforgiven is very much unlike Sergio Leone's bold and operatic westerns, which are wonderful films in their own right. Superfluous gun fights are not to be found here. It is a gritty western steeped in reality.",1091145600,3,2257,4.978779840848806

Man is aware of both good and evil but finally is caught up in evil and unless he is redeemed by the forgivness of God he will die in his sins. The title is very appropriate as the characters in the end are unforgiving and unforgiven. It is a powerful film in that there are certain aspects in the various characters the show they have a sense of what is good but they are unable of themselves to overcome the innate evil of the human heart. There are several classic lines in the film such as the moment the young gunslinger says to Eastwood's character ""He has it coming"" and the reply is ""We all have it coming"" The conclusion at the end is that both the man representing the law and the man representing the lawless are both damned. It is not a pretty picture of mankind but a true one and is the reason why the Son of God had to die on the cross that we might be forgiven. There is Evil in man, but goodness in God if we will turn to Him.

The plot is well covered by other reviewers.  A ... is attacked and disfigured by a couple of local cowhands, and the madam and her girls raise a bounty and hire Munny (Eastwood) and his sidekicks to kill them.  And, they do.

That's the gist of it.  The movie is earthy.  The bad guy, for example, is killed while using the outhouse.  An undignified end, which is exactly what he deserves.

No heroism here.  No shining knight on a white charger.  Instead, you get the feeling of realism, which is what director Eastwood was certainly after.

103212,5,0790729644,"After watching the western movie titled: ""Unforgiven"", it reminded me of a trip my brother and I made out to Nevada, to a place called Pioche. During the late 1800's, They say Pioche was one of the most ruthless towns in the West. It was a busy mining town and a war zone. If you visited, you ran the chance of being harassed or even killed. Murder wasn't uncommon in Pioche, Nevada. It was also common in many other colonial frontier settlements at the time. In my opinion, this was the true history of America's expansion into the West while drunk in corruption. The movie Unforgiven, will satisfy this assumption; It will testify about everything. There's no Hollywood glamour, or fake stereotypes in this movie. You will see things up close and personal. You will see the disease that plagued the territory.

103214,5,0790729644,"Redemption can only succeed if the past doesn't haunt the redeemed. Clint Eastwood stars as former outlaw Will Munny. Munny has changed his ways after meeting a woman who literally helped him turn his life around. Now she's gone and he's a struggling farmer with two small children desperate for money to fuel his last chance at staying honest and straight.
Munny decides along with his former partner (a marvelously understated Morgan Freeman)and a young kid to kill two cowboys that cut up a prostitute for a $1000.00 bounty. The only thing standing between him and the money is Little Bill (Gene Hackman who picked up an Oscar for Best Supporting actor)a brutal Sheriff. Munny doesn't know it but he's caught an express train to hell as the cold blooded killer he was comes to the fore again.
Unforgiven is as much about the inability to escape our past as it is about the violence and bloodshed that was later glossed over in the westerns of the 30's and 40's. Munny realizes that killing is a nasty business for both the killer and his victim. Despite his years of hard work and the saving grace of his wife, Munny could easily tip over into the abyss of alcholism and cruelty that dominated his youth. It's a marvelous portrayal and Eastwood, arguably, deserved the Best Acting Oscar as much as the directing and Best Picture Oscars.
This new 10th Anniversary edition has been digitally remastered and looks beautiful. The opening sequence is a good example of the care taken in the transfer. The smoke from Munny's house during sunset snakes gently against the bright orange sky. Eastwood and his collaborators (writer David Webb Peoples who also wrote Blade Runner and the underrated film science fiction adventure Solider with Kurt Russell)have fashioned a morality play as much about the present as it is about the past.
The cast is filled with Eastwood regulars but two particular performances shine aside from Eastwood and Freeman--Gene Hackman as the sadistic and brutal Little Bill and the late Richard Harris in a glorified cameo as gunfighting legend English Bob. Harris plays Bob as a dandy with a pistol until Bob encounters Little Bill. We then discover how much of his legend is myth designed to gloss over a nasty reputation and dishonorable actions.
The extras included are very good as well. There's a documentary called Eastwood on Eastwood which ran on one of the cable channels.  As a performer we get glimpses of Eastwood in early supporting roles (from his first movie the horrible horror film Revenge of the Creature with John Agar)to the television role that gave him enough fame to jump to Leone's A Fistful of Dollars in Rawhide. The clips provide a good summation of Eastwood's performing style over the years. It's also a canny if slightly self serving assessment on Eastwood's themes as a director and smart observations about the true quality of his uneven body of work as a director.
There's also an episode of Maverick featuring James Garner where Eastwood plays a character that could have been Munny when he was younger. He plays a cocky young gunfighter with an attitude (although Munny was much nastier based on comments from the characters in the film. Consider his portrayal a G rated version of Munny). It's a beautiful transfer of a classic black and white episode from television's Golden Age. When will Maverick and some of these classic westerns finally make the jump to DVD?
There's also a feature commentary by Time film critic Richard Schickel (although I would have much preferred Eastwood). A new featurette about the making of the film as well as the original featurette on the making of the film.

He is joined by his friend and former partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), and a wanna-be gunslinger named ""The Schofield Kid"" (Jaimz Woolvett). The three set out to Big Whiskey, Wyoming where a group of prostitutes are seeking revenge for one of their own that gets raped, and cut up extremely bad. ""Little"" Bill Dagget ( Gene Hackman)is the sadistic and corrupt sheriff of Big Whiskey, and is desperate to keep bounty hunters from collecting on the money that the prostitutes are offering. English Bob(Richard Harris), is a legendary gunfighter who rides into town, and is also looking to collect on the reward. English Bob just happens to be an old rival of ""Little"" Bill's, and Bill is looking to make an example out of him. But the real focus of the film is on Will Munny, and the conflict that he must face within himself. As the story unfolds, Munny tries to convince himself that his return to the life is just temporary. But the consequences of his actions, could last him a lifetime...
""Unforgiven"" is one of the finest Westerns ever made. Clint Eastwood succeeded on both sides of the camera with his role of William Munny, and his direction of the film. However, Eastwood is not the only reason for the film's success. The rest of the cast could not have done a better job. Morgan Freeman, Jaimz Woolvett, and Richard Harris all give amazing performances. However the standout performance of the film goes to Gene Hackman as the sadistic sheriff ""Little Bill"". It is one of the best performances of his career. The musical score is haunting as well as beautiful, and it really drives the film. The cinematography is amazing as well. Everything about the film is perfect. The film was winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director - Clint Eastwood and Best Supporting Actor- Gene Hackman.
I was overjoyed when the 10th Anniversary Edition DVD was released. The extras are worth the price alone. Disc 1 features a beautiful transfer of the film, as well as commentary from Eastwood and his biographer Richard Schickel. Disc 2 brings 4 outstanding documentaries which includes interviews with the entire cast, the making of the film, and a lot more. There is also an episode of the TV show ""Maverick"" co-starring Clint Eastwood. The movie was already a must have on its own.

103217,5,0790729644,"If I was forced to give one word reviews of everything else I everything else I read, see, hear or play from here on in, that is the one word I would use for Clint Eastwood's incredibly compelling western ""Unforgiven.""  To date, it is the most story driven, theme driven and character driven film I have ever seen, western or otherwise.  Beginning with an intense knife attack in a whorehouse and ending with a final, soul-wrenching showdown between Eastwood and Gene Hackman (who won an oscar for his trouble), the film never lets up on its sheer dramatic force or its provoking moral play on violence and its inevitable consequences.
Clint Eastwood plays a hog farmer named William Munny, now leading a relatively normal life after decades of being a feared and remorseless bounty hunter, with his loyal partner, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman).  But Munny now is down on his luck, with the farm struggling.  When a chance comes about for a $1000 bounty put up by angry prostitutes from Big Whiskey, Wyoming, Munny and Logan take up the offer, along with a green but eager fellow hunter (Jaimz Woolvett).  Meanwhile, in Big Whiskey, the town sherriff, Little Bill Dagget (Hackman) has put a ruthless lid on the bounty, and beats up an old rival who comes looking for it, English Bob (Richard Harris) who by the way shoots chinese men working on the railroad for kicks and giggles.
When I first learned ""Unforgiven"" was garnered with best picture and best director oscars, I thought it had something to do with Eastwood being the old vanguard that he is and not so much talent oriented.  I could not have been more wrong.  Eastwoods' direction is outstanding, building scenes of dynamic character development with the hand of a skilled craftsman.  Every extra, every flat and otherwise unimportant chracter shows real, human emotion on their face, which is something I have never quite seen on screen before. Eastwoods' direction is aided by excellent, oscar-winning film editing.  ""Unforgiven"" is a prime example of direction and editing working off each to mold scenes of true power, and give the viewer a real sense and feel for the surroundings.  And the film is beautifully shot in the stunning scenery near Alberta, Canada.  Filmmaking doesn't get much better than ""Unforgiven,"" and Eastwood is far more than just Hollywoods' old vanguard.",1067212800,6,2341,4.916243654822335

Unforgiven implies that violence will be the only path, if we don't just forgive and move on.

103221,5,0790729644,"That's how I would describe ""Unforgiven"" -- as hard as the title implies. It's a classic, no doubt, every bit as good as Eastwood's other great film, ""The Outlaw Josey Wales,"" maybe a little better.
It's taken me years to fully appreciate the power and accomplishment of this movie. Eastwood himself refused to make it until after he'd reached a certain age, and it takes a certain level of maturity to accept that this movie HAS NO HEROES, that it is about death and dying, that it is about a way of life that has long vanished ... a way that, in the hardboiled view of this movie, wasn't all that great to begin with.
""Unforgiven"" is one of the few successful films that has no sympathetic characters. Eastwood's William Munny is a criminal, a thug whose late-in-life recognition of his own dastardly deeds does not necessarily clear him of them (hence the title). His buddy, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) is no saint either, simply too old and guilt-ridden to live the outlaw life any longer. Likewise, the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett, and whatever happened to him?) is the cowboy equivalent of a punk, a gangsta wannabe with more mouth than guts (he's the only character in the movie to experience a moral revelation).
Which brings us to the ""bad guy,"" Little Bill Daggett, played with clear-eyed hate by Gene Hackman. What a complex character. The guy just wants to build a house and watch the sunset over his coffee. He can't hammer two nails into a board. He wants law and order in his frontier town, and he'll get it if he has to beat a man to death. He's cowardly -- once he's disarmed a man and surrounded him with trigger-happy ""deputies,"" then he lets fly with his fists -- but maybe he's just playing a dangerous game the smart way. And he is smart. Smarter than Will Munny, only not quite as lucky.
Let us not forget the prostitutes who set the plot in motion. Strawberry Alice seems to desire bloody revenge far more than Delilah, the girl whose face is slashed by the cowboys. All of the women in the film are hard, brutal, deceptive, obsessed with avenging themselves of the very livelihood that pays the bounty. Not a likeable or sympathetic character in the bunch.
Finally, there's English Bob (Richard Harris). Eastwood establishes that he's come to Big Whiskey for the bounty so subtly that, believe it or not, I missed it the first time I saw the movie. (Maybe it's a little too subtle -- no dialogue refers to his motivation.) English Bob gits the tar whupped out of him, but he's not a good guy, just a ""living legend"" whose legend has finally caught up with him.
There is a journey in the movie, but it's an anti-heroic journey with only one outcome: that Will Munny will actually lose his battle with his demons and commit murder in exchange for filthy lucre. (The character's name is not a coincidence.) Not exactly a healthy outlook on the human condition.
""Unforgiven"" is what certain critics mean when they describe a movie as ""dark,"" only here the description actually applies. It is dark, and it does not contain a glimmer of hope for anything or anyone. ""Deserve's got nothing to do with it,"" Munny tells Little Bill. And yet everybody in the movie gets exactly what they deserve ... including Will Munny, who's left alone with the demons of his past.
The movie is great precisely because of its pessimism; I don't know another way to put it. It is the death of the Western; it is also sad and moving, physically beautiful and vividly acted. Ten years ago, I sorta kinda felt ""Unforgiven"" didn't deserve the Best Picture Oscar. Now I sorta kinda feel that it's too good for it.",1065139200,7,3609,4.596899224806202
103222,5,0790729644,"Unforgiven is a modern classic and the best western in the last 30 years and perhaps one of the top five ever made. It ranks with Shane, Ford's calvary triology, Red River and The Searchers as a classic of the genre. All of Eastwood's experience in the genre, of which he is the last great star and this generation's John Wayen, comes to fruition in this beautiful realized film. It is classic in the manner of a Greek tragedy, of a man whose past has unleashed furies that cannot be ignored.
If there was a higher rating than five stars, I would give it to Unforgiven. Do not miss this film.",1064793600,2,592,4.342342342342342

THIS MOVIE WHINES, AND MOANS, AND GROANS THROUGH THE FIRST HOUR AND A HALF.

NEITHER NED NOR THE BOY HAVE THE STOMACH FOR THE JOB. AND THATS WHERE I HAVE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THIS STORY. IT HAS NO CREDIBILITY. I CAN ALREADY HEAR THE 'REBUTTALS' I KNOW THAT IS THE STORY. BUT LIKE A BLIND HOUND ""THAT DOG WONT HUNT!""

103225,5,0790729644,"Those who are fans of Clint Eastwood know that when Clint makes a movie, he is always saying something about what he feels a man should be.  ""The Unforgiven"" in many ways, is one of his best movies and one of the most visual in its depiction of what a man is, and especially, what a man was in the Wild West, and the transitions that man tried to make, sometimes successfully, and sometimes not.
His morality is pure in this film.  He is an ex-gunfighter who has seen the good way of the Lord, thanks to his wife.  He is in some financial difficulties, and so, he takes a job that is a ""kill for hire"" job.  The film portrays beautifully, the conflict within a man, as he faces the option of actually killing another man.  In several ways, Clint makes this point.
And while Clint and his partners get paid, it seems a very bittersweet ending as in the process, the great tragedy of the loss of his friend's life to torture occurred.  So little is known really about what makes a person do some of the things they do, and yet, Clint makes these almost ephemeral feelings come to life visually, in this film.
In some ways, perhaps Clint's very best film, ""The Unforgiven"" is not only a wonderful ""period piece"" but also, truly a statement on the character of people.",1060214400,2,1264,4.380341880341881

And that?s what The Unforgiven is: a winner. Hackman plays the sleazy and sadistic local sheriff of Big Whiskey, a town somewhere in the outback of Wyoming where the local prostitutes are determined to seek revenge on the guys who maimed one of them - and they've pooled their savings and have offered a bounty. Eastwood and Freeman, old partners, have retired but, down on their luck, they are persuaded by circumstances to take aim on the bad guys one last time. Then, when they meet Hackman's style of resistance, it becomes bigger than just a bounty hunt; it turns into the usual Eastwood confrontation: Good vs. Evil.

103227,5,0790729644,"By the time this film appeared (1992), Eastwood had already established himself as one of the most gifted directors. His talents behind the camera were first evident, and impressive, in Play Misty for Me (1971). Unforgiven received an Academy Award for best film, as did Eastwood for directing it. So many memorable characters which include Bill Munny (Eastwood), Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), Sheriff ""Little Bill"" Daggett (Gene Hackman), and English Bob (Richard Harris). What I find most interesting is Eastwood's willingness and ability to portray an old widow, far past his prime, who reluctantly agrees to accept an assignment to earn some much-needed money for himself and his family. Munny (obviously, no pun intended)  enlists the aid of his friend Logan. They are joined by the self-described ""Schofield Kid"" (Jaimz Woolvett) and proceed to a town under the absolute control of Daggett who, unlike Brian Dennehy's character Cobb in Silverado, can be personally quite appealing but is nonetheless every bit as formidable. (I shall never forget Daggett's dying words, ""But I'm building a house!"") In my opinion, the plot really is not especially important. The film's greatest strengths are found within the meticulous development of various characters, a process under Eastwood's sure direction which is gradual and both subtle and substantial. Perhaps the character of journalist W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) is necessary to expedite the exposition but he seems to add little else. However, all others among the supporting cast are essential.
Unforgiven can be categorized as a ""western"" but, in my opinion, it transcends that genre as it examines how the reality of an old man's vengeance is far more significant than the myth associated with his earlier adventures. Near the end of the film, ""Little Bill"" must deal with a Munny who is, not with someone who once was. The fact that Munny prevails reveals much about him...and perhaps about Eastwood and others who in later life, like Tennyson's Ulysses, ""strive to seek, to find...and not to yield.""",1059436800,7,2060,5.242424242424242
103228,5,0790729644,"What most strikes me about this film, given the fact it is essentially one of the best and most thoughtful westerns ever filmed, is the unexpected level of thoughtful comment it makes about the underlying effects of violence for everyone that encounters it. Clint Eastwood wanted to make this film his coda for what he thought was an accurate and faithful portrait of the west, violence, squalor and all. Of course, in so doing, he succeeds beyond all reasonable expectations. Clintwood plays the central character of William Munney, a reformed alcoholic ex-gunslinger who is miserably flailing about in vain as he attempts to continue along the straight and narrow path he has maintained to remain on since his reformation, and he is a flop as a dirt farmer, left alone to raise his two children after the death of his much-adored wife. When the notion of a way out is thrown unexpectedly in his lap, it takes him little time to recognize the opportunity as a lifeline must grab in his desperate circumstances. Unfortunately, it means he must regress to all of the horrors of a life his wife had originally rescued him from.
Eastwood is supported by one of the most creatively talented casts in recent memory, from Gene Hackman playing his protagonist, the corrupt sheriff Little Bill Daggett, to Munny's old trail companion Ned Logan, underplayed masterfully by a mostly stone-faced Morgan Freeman, to a egocentric young killer-wannabe, played convincingly by a youthful Jaimie Woolvett. Richard Harris is also excellent as an English gunfighter, as is Saul Rubinek as an over-eager and somewhat nave yellow journalist who aims to make his journalistic bones in the literary world by writing stories about Little Bill. Yet amid all the action and carnage, one of the most memorable (and profound) scenes in the film consists of a simple conversation between Eastwood and Woolvett, in which Eastwood wastes no words describing the horror of killing someone, thereby robbing the person of all he is and all he ever can be. In the electric silence that follows, one begins to realize what Eastwood is really talking about, and it isn't just about the wild frontier. Another comment later on to his protagonist Little Bob is similarly something one has to experience to appreciate in terms of its philosophical import.
Of course, Eastwood uses the camera to great cinematic advantage, employing every aspect of the local topography to shower us with both a mind-boggling backdrop by way of the landscape itself and an epic drama threading toward its fateful conclusion in the dust-filled trail ways and smoke-filled saloons native to the area. This movie must mark the last of a long series of progressively more sophisticated and memorable Eastwood epics portraying the west and its settling, for it is hard to see how he could improve on this film, which is certainly going to become a classic among western films. There is little doubt that this is a captivating, thought-provoking, and worthwhile movie, and one I am sure you would want to have in your library of films.

103229,5,0790729644,"Never a truer word has ever been said.  Undoubtadly the best modern day western, Unforgiven tells the story of William Munny (Clint Eastwood who also directed), a once ruthless gunslinger who, along with his old partner Ned (Morgan Freeman) and the nephew of one of his old partners (Jaimz Woolvett), are out to collect a bounty on the men who brutalized a prostitute in the town of Big Whiskey which is run by the sly, deceitful, and brutal sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman).  At first glance that seems to be the story of Unforgiven, but if you look closer there is something else there.  For years, Will Munny tried to deny what he was; a cold blooded theif and murderer and killer of women and children.  For years he tried to believe he was a changed man, but for all those long years there was something growing in this man, something that he couldn't outgun, his true nature.  The scene where he is laying there sickly after being beaten by Little Bill, when he tells Ned about his vision of the Angel of Death, he was seeing himself; and now he will be unleashed in Big Whiskey when he is pushed to his limit.  This is the incredible storytelling that most screen writers only wish they could come up with, and thanks to Eastwood's fantastic direction and incredible performances from him, Hackman, Freeman, and the late Richard Harris in one of his most colorful roles, make Unforgiven a true modern day classic.  It would win the Best Picture Oscar along with Best Editing, and Eastwood would earn an Oscar for Best Director while Hackman would deservingly win for Best Supporting Actor.

This west is a bleak moral vacuum, a place of anxious sized-obsessed men and violently determined women, where the creed of the cowboy gives way to the creed of the gangster. Villains aren't challenged to duels of skill, but slaughtered as they try to surrender. Virtually every man dies unarmed. The film could be enjoyed on a purely visceral level, but with its subplot about English Bob and his travelling 'biographer', screenwriter David Webb Peoples clearly has more in mind. His screenplay reflects on the Western as a myth-making genre, and suggests that the mythic conception of the American west is a fabrication woven from the exaggerated stories of braggarts and liars. His tale of Will Munny tells it like it probably was. It's a chilling world which has more in common with classical tragedy and the moral speculation of sci-fi.

This movie is simple, dark and yet highly complex in its superb script and the outstanding performances by all concerned.  Few westerns will draw you into the lead characters as this one does.  Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and the sorely missed Richard Harris all deserved awards for their collective performances.  What is a western without Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman!
The premise:
Welcome to Big Whiskey Wyoming, where in a small ""billiards"" saloon, a cowboy gets angry at a whore and, with the help of his buddy, cuts her face up.  The other ""women"" of the establishment, pool their money and start telling everybody that they're offering a reward to whoever kills these two young cowboys.  This is precipitated by Gene Hackmans character Little Bill, who essentially doesn't punish them for their crime.
Clint Eastwood plays William Munny, who in his earlier days was every bit one of the worst, meanest gunslingers in the west.  Some ten years prior to the events at the beginning of this fine film, William Munny met his wife Claudia, who turned this serious gunslinger into a family man, unfortunately for him and his little children, his wife died three years prior.  He is now a poor pig farmer, with two little children.
The son of one of his old riding buddies has heard about this reward and seeks out William Munnys assistance in tracking down these unpunished criminals.  After some hesitation, he seeks out his friend Ned, played by Morgan Freeman, one of the finest actors of our day.  The three of them head north to seek out the reward.
What follows is clearly a movie that while, for the better part is melodramatic; it is that melodrama that is gripping.  All those who received accolades for this fine film, richly deserved those accolades.
This exceptional film that graced the silver screen so beautifully and then the home theater, deserves a hallowed place on ones DVD rack and is perfectly well suited to repeated viewings.  I highly recommend this masterpiece to any and all, even those who may not find themselves interested in westerns will find this film highly compelling.  {ssintrepid}",1045353600,95,2195,4.932065217391305

Basically the lead, William Munny,is no different than the Man With No Name that Eastwood gave us in his hayday. We get to see life after gunfighting.
  Eastwood's Munny is an ex outlaw who goes out for one last run when a bounty is put on the head's of two cowboy's who one attacked a prostitute and cut her face. Morgan Freeman plays Ned Logan one of
Munny's partners who knew him befor Munny met his wife and changed his ways (In the beggining of the film we find out that Munny's wife has passed away).
  The bounty is placed by the working girls of Big Whiskey a small town run by a ruthless and very nasty sheriff named Little Bill played by Gene Hackman (Hackman would win an Oscar for the role). We see just how nasty Little Bill can be when English Bob (Richard Harris) wounders into town looking to collect the bounty.
  Eastwood showed real courage by not being afraid to show his charactor as both older and flawed.
  One of the best thing's about this film is that you get to see the human side of all the people involved. Littler bill building a house and Munny raising pigs show just how diverse the charactors are.
  This film won four Oscars including Best Film Editing, Supporting actor, Best Director (Eastwood) and Best Picture. Eastwood himself was also nomminated for best Actor.

103234,5,0790729644,"There are no heroes in Unforgiven.  Just the living and the dead.  Critics hailed this as a ""revisionist western,"" but if you look back over Clint Eastwood's entire career, you see that Unforgiven is just par for the course.  Eastwood's westerns have always been brutally violent, but unglamorously so.  From the vicious lynching that opens Hang 'Em High, right on through to Unforgiven, Eastwood has unflichingly looked at violence and seen in it our desperation to live.  He rarely has music over violence.  Punches are often soft and wet sounding, instead of always sounding like whipcracks.  It is brutal.  It is difficult.  It hurts.  So, while I don't sing the praises of this movie for any innovation, I do praise it for two things.  First, it embodies and summarizes Eastwood's examination of the Western and American violence.  Second, for the absolutely incredible performance of Gene Hackman as Little Bill Dagget.  Hackman's performance is one of the best pieces of acting ever captured on film.  David Webb Peoples' script is obviously a big part of that performance, but Hackman's portrayal of the man for whom brutality is a mere tool, who wants only peace, order, and to finish his house, is amazing.  His character is the only one that has figured out that being a dangerous man IS dangerous.  He is the only one of the dangerous men in this film to have found a way out.  Or so he believes.
This movie has a lot to say about America.  About the Western genre.  About our voyeuristic love of violence.  And it says it well.  It leaves you with much to consider.  That's much more than you get from most mainstream Hollywood fare.",1041811200,30,1646,4.76241134751773

103236,5,0790729644,"""Unforgiven"" is much more than a breathtaking Western, it's an amazing film altogether. With elements of drama and film noir, this is a picture that shows us that there are some demons you can never put to rest, no matter how hard you try.

 Clint Eastwood stars as William Munny, a once notorious and violent killer and thief. If Munny didn't like you, chances were that you wouldn't live long enough for him to tell you so. However, that was in the old days. Now, he's just a quiet and tired farmer who is a devoted father still in mourning of his dead wife. He's been straight for years and is trying to put all of his demons to rest, but you still get the feeling that no matter how hard he tries, he will always be haunted. An opportunity comes to him in the name of `The Schofield Kid.' He gives him a chance to be his partner and have him help on a bounty. Knowing that the money could help his family out, Munny finally decides to take the Kid up on the offer. He also brings with him Ned Logan; an old friend and partner. Little Bill Daggett is the Sheriff in town, and the thing he hates most are assassins. He will do anything in his power to take care of them and make sure they do not succeed on their killing. The last remaining part of the film stands out the most and is so well executed that it catches you off guard.

 This really is a great film and it surprised me like I would've never expected. I don't like Westerns all that much, but this isn't your typical Western. That is probably why I enjoyed it so much. There is so much story and character development. You really are able to sympathize with Munny, despite his dark and violent past. You want him to be able to get on with his life and forget the past, although you know deep down that things will never be put to rest, and agreeing to go on this bounty only increases the chance of Munny returning back to his old ways. This isn't a Western where the line between good guys and bad guys are clear and the storyline is simple; good guy kills bad guys and gets the girl in the end. No, you won't find any of this here. In this story there are no clear good guys or bad guys, just regular people. This is a real story with real characters that you can feel for. There is a huge issue of morality that takes place, which is something you don't see much in Westerns.

 Not only does Eastwood do a terrific job in acting, he also does an amazing job as director. He's a man with vision, and who more qualified to direct a film of this magnitude. I don't think the film would had been as successful had it been done by someone else. The cast is also outstanding. Morgan Freeman really does his role justice. Gene Hackman spreads fear inside of you as the mean and tough Sheriff. Richard Harris also deserves mention for his part as well. (He is sorely missed. He was a very gifted actor.) Everyone really did great in their roles and really knew how to bring the film together.

 This new DVD edition really does the movie justice. Though it may not have the most special features, the one feature that stands out the most is the new digital transfer that really makes the picture look crystal clear. The sound is also very impressive as well. Special features included are as follows: Audio commentary by Film Critic and Eastwood Biographer Richard Schickel, Eastwood film highlights, awards list, trailer, and 4 documentaries.

 ""Unforgiven"" is really a spectacular film that deserved the Academy Awards for ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Director."" And it is a true masterpiece in my eyes. I think anyone who is a lover of films should give this one a try. Remember, you do not have to be a Western fan to enjoy this, because I am certainly not one. Some people may be disappointed in the lack of action or shoot-outs, but the film is about so much more. It's about morals and trying to put the past to rest. It's also about accepting who you are and that there are some things you will never be able to change, no matter how hard you try. This will end up being one of my favorites in no time. I was very surprised, indeed.",1040947200,181,4096,4.3077922077922075
103237,4,0790729644,"Unforgiven you realize, a few minutes in, is not your typical westen. Nor is it your typical Clint Eastwood movie. And it probably surely isn't your typical Best Picture Oscar winner. Telling the story of Willam Munny (Clint Eastwood), a retired bounty hunter who goes on one last job, to kill the men who slashed a prostitute's face. Now doesn't that sound like a fun movie! Whoppee! Errr... Not really. Actually it sound's downright depressing. And it is. Along the way Willam meets up with his longtime partner played by Morgon Freeman. Together they set out to kill those above mentioned men. About this time we switch over to the late Richard Harris's character. Who also is after the reward money offered up by the town prostitutes for the killing of those men I've mentioned twice already. He isn't after them long as he gets beaten and kicked by the towns people, mainly thier crooked sheriff, Little Bill (played suberbly by Gene Hackman).
He isn't the typical bad guy, either, in fact he's almost good in comparison with other bad guys in other movies. All of this leads up to a spectacular climax with a showdown between Willam Munny and Little Bill. Unforgiven also convienently managed to snag 4 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (For Clint Eastwood's terrific directing), Best Supporting Actor (For Gene Hackman's marvelous Little Bill). All should see Unforgiven, whether all would enjoy it is another matter. But who can forget Little Bill's words ""I'm just trying to build a house!""",1037404800,2,1519,4.9375

I have liked some of his movies but have nenver made a habit of having to check out the latest Eastwood thriller at the multiplex.  Given that, it is even more remarkable that I really loved this DVD.  Unforgiven is a great film that deserved its Best Picture Oscar. Eastwood, Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman are all terrific in this movie about facing up to your past and the cost of violence to society.  Hackman won the Oscar for best Supporting Actor and watching the movie again just confirms what a great choice that was.  Everything about this movie is top notch- the acting, the writing, Eastood's direction.  This is the best western of the past twenty years and one of the best ten ever made.  The movie shines on this disc, it was a great transfer. The extras on this two disc set are delightful.  There is a classic Maverick episode featuring a very young Eastwood, along with some documentries and some other wonderful extras.  This belongs on any movie buff's shelf and would make a great gift for anyone who is aEastwood fan, a fan of westerns, or a fan of the movies.",1034985600,5,1155,4.488038277511961
103239,5,0790729644,"At the time of Unforgiven's release in 1992, Clint Eastwood was a movie icon with most of his most memorable films being westerns.  This film though would become his most acclaimed and honored movie.  It is a classic western tale of a man with a terrible past who struggles for redemption.  Mr. Eastwood plays William Munny who was one the most ruthless and cold-blooded killers of his day.  As the film opens, he is now just a lowly hog farmer who is widowed with two young children he can barely afford to feed and care for.  Along comes a young stranger known only as the Schofield Kid (played by Jaimz Woolvert) who propositions Munny to join him on a mission to avenge a prostitute who was beaten by some men.  Munny reluctantly agrees and the journey back into his former life is a revealing and sobering experience.  Along the way they join up with an old cohort of Munny's Ned Logan played by Morgan Freeman and a strange bounty hunter English Bob played by Richard Harris.  Gene Hackman is brilliant as a sadistic sheriff Little Bob with whom Munny has a final showdown that strikes at the heart of the film.  It reveals the impact that a violent life has on a person's conscience and soul.  The film won the 1992 Oscar for best film, best director for Mr. Eastwood (who won his second Oscar of the year as producer of the film) and Mr. Hackman won his second Oscar as best supporting actor twenty-one years after his best actor Oscar for the French Connection.",1034294400,3,1470,4.513207547169811

But this is a different and riveting movie, ably directed by Clint Eastwood and extremely well acted by all. The DVD sets has lots of extras and I really enjoyed the 20 minute or so feature on making the movie and the interviews with Clint and the rest of the cast. It was very interesting to see how they did some of the shots - even dispensing with horses in some scenes and perching the actors on stools to get some of the dialog without the movement of the horses.

103242,5,0790729644,"This film is the exact opposite of High Noon. In that movie, there was one hero anyway, well maybe 2 if you count Will Kane's wife when the story ends. At the end of this violent Western epic, everyone has blood on their hands. It tells the truth of violence, legal or illegal. There are no heroes when one is dealing violence and death. The entire cast is one of the finest ensembles ever brought together. It is surely the equal of the cast of The Wild Bunch, and maybe even superior. Gene Hackman is brilliant as the psycopathic bully of a Town Sherrif. Richard Harris is chilling as a murderous Bounty Hunter. He is traveling with his own personal so-called biographer who is writing his exploits for the pulp novels. Then there is Morgan Freeman, one of his finest most complex performances in his career as Eastwood's friend and partner in murder. In the end, though, this film is about Clint Eastwood. We first meet him as a sod buster farming the ruins of a life, caring for his two children and mourning his deceased wife. He can barely speak above a whisper he is so gentle and cowed. But we soon learn he is a man of violent past deeds of mayhem and murder. He admits to killing one of everything that ever walked on the earth and more. Hired on by a young wanna-be gun slinger, he and Freeman head off to avenge the stabbing, not fatal, of a prostitute on a frontier town. The film is incredibly violent, and matter of fact about it as well. It is filmed with a very dark palette, with dark night scenes and dimly lit interiors that add an almost palpable sense of the times. This is a great piece of cinema, and must be watched by anyone who is serious about American film as an art. In time it will surely be looked back on as a classic of world cinema as well.",1033084800,8,1775,4.317365269461078

103244,4,0790729644,"Any movie starring Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris has got to be good.  But I must admit upon first viewing of this movie I was initially a bit let down.  As I watched I had trouble coming to terms with my childhood western hero Clint Eastwood being an old broken down, retired killer that couldn't even mount his own horse.  The plot is the normal revenge plot in two different ways.
First, the aging killers (Eastwood & Freeman) team up with a young kid who is all talk to collect a bounty on two cowboys that cut up a local woman of the night.  But when Ned (Freeman) loses the stomach for the killing he rides away.  And his caught by the Sheriff Little Bill (Hackman) and beat to death.  Upon hearing this news William Money (Eastwood) decides that it is time to get drunk and revert to the his old ways.
It is here where we see the Clint Eastwood of old and the revenge style, lone wolf, western movie that made his career as he takes his revent on Little Bill and the town.
The movie picked up pace about mid way and my initial let down faded fast as I realized where the movie was heading and the fact that the beginning was needed to set up the great ending.  Once again Clint has turned in a classic western.
The characters portrayed in this movie feel very real.  You can connect with them and sympathize with them, even when they are killing folks or being killed.
A great movie and classic western!",1027123200,,1443,4.338289962825279
103245,5,0790729644,"Recently at the Maui film festival, Clint had a chance to talk to us about movies in general and Unforgiven in particular.
To get an academy award for best picture you have to convince first the critics then the academy.  By definition, this group of people are old timers whom have always lived within the system.
Demographs in part explains why Unforgiven was so well liked by the critic's, and just above average with everyone else.
What I understand Clint to be saying is that he was trying to achieve something revolving around the good guy marshal turning out to be the villain.  He said villains usually carried no baggage.  Gene Hackman was a frontier lawman; he had roots in the community.  For ""Gosh's sakes,"" he was building a house.
I have seen Unforgiven many times including one of Clint's personal prints.  In am sorry, I did not see it as being that great.  I have discussed this with many people and I think I know why.
First off at no time did we see the lawman as a good guy.  Nobody I talked to took the lawman as the good guy.  People from our generation do not automatically see the cops as good guys.  As soon as we are passengers in cars, we are taught to look out for cops and go for our seat belts on sight.  A lot like outlaws of old going for their guns.
It was Clint coming in to protect the helpless woman that was the knight is shining armor.  The fact that he was a bounty hunter had nothing to do with it.
Maybe Clint was in Spain when L.A. had its riots.  Or that kind of news does not make front page in Carmel.  In any case, the people he played to, saw a different movie than us.
They saw ""Popeye Doyle,"" Gene Hackman as a good guy until his villiness became overwhelming.  They were sitting there accepting this violence in the name of law and order until they had to realize they could not stomach it anymore.  Many of us made that decision a long time before Unforgiven.  Maybe they gave Hackman the award for that.
Wyatt Earp was accused of Police brutality in Tombstone.  He was paid to sneak up on people, hit them in the back of the head to knock them senseless, and then stick them in jail to sleep it off.  He collected fines before he let them out.
The boys were killed at the OK Corral over a misdemeanor, carrying guns within city limits.  Some of them may have even been unarmed when the shooting started.  Some were found unarmed after they were dead.
Lieutenant Bascom just out of West Point was promoted by the US army, when he executed Cochise's family and friends for a crime committed after Bascom held them in custody.
In a Western filmed near Carmel by Marlin Brando, Karl Malden plays a lawman with a lot of baggage, a wife and a kid, but we do not see him as a good guy.
Somehow, I did not see this Western as different.  Our Hero was hired to do a job.  He recruits a force of heroes, meets the helpless villagers.  Overcomes the evildoers.  Is thanked by the villagers.  Utters an oath as he is leaving that if anyone hurts the woman he will be back and get them.
Great Western, but people I talked to did not see at as very different from ordinary Great Westerns.",1026518400,,3126,4.302564102564102
103246,5,0790729644,"You can tell right away that this is not going to be typical Hollywood fare from the beginning.  Please take that as a compliment.  The story is about a group of prostitutes in a small Western town in the 19th century.  A customer with not a lot under the hood overreacts to his rent-a-mate's comment on this and slices up her face with a knife.  After the sheriff shows up and gives less than a slap on the hand for this offense, the ladies get together, pool their money, and get the word out that they'll pay a reward to the party that brings a more ""eye for and eye"" to the cutter and his companion.
Now it's not this original scene of violence that makes it special.  It's the portrayal of old Western life that does.  While the otherwise masterful ""Lonesome Dove"" has one of the most beautiful faces in movies in Diane Lane as it's prostitute, the ladies here are, for the most part, very ordinary looking.  More than that, they portray a weariness that shows that their life is not that easy.  In the hands of other Hollywood powers, the ladies would have been Charlie's Angels.
Cut to the existence of the movie's main character, played by Clint Eastwood.  He's a former outlaw and killer, reformed by his now dead wife, and faced with the responsibility of raising two children.  The only thing good that can be said of his home is that it's slightly better than the pen where he keeps the hogs he raises, and that's not saying much.  The Ponderosa it ain't.
What Clint Eastwood seemed to want to do in his directorial masterpiece is to turn everything he represented in his previous years of acting and turn in on it's head.  In scene after scene you anticipate the old Clint rearing back and wiping out half a town just to get an appetite up for breakfast.  But time after time we are surprised to see a man who can't even mount his horse properly, and can't hit a target with a pistol from ten feet away.  We see that all his lifestyle has led to is wretched poverty.
The movie grows on you the more you watch it, and the memorable characters have stood the test of time.  Morgan Freeman, as always, brings a knowing weariness in his role as Eastwood's partner.  Richard Harris has a terrific role as an English gunfighter who hires a writer to build his own legend, but has it totally taken apart by the sheriff of the movie's central town.  And Gene Hackman deserves his Oscar as the sheriff who is somehow portrayed as the bad guy when most of the other lead male characters are in the plot for the sole purpose of committing murder.  It is this challenge to our sense of what is right and what is wrong, and if there is sometimes even a difference between the two that makes this a Hall of Fame movie.",1026172800,3,2717,4.378486055776892
103247,5,0790729644,"This is great filmmaking. The acting of Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, Richard Harris and Clint Eastwood is as good as these four greats can get and they are supported by a highly dedicated cast. The screenplay is perfectly written with as much memorable dialogue as some of the greatest films ever made. Quite simply, this is one of the greatest films ever made.
The entire film draws a clear definition of William Munney as perhaps the evilest man to ever live and what we the audience sees is a person we can relate to on many levels. In Eastwood's character we see our own darkest sides, our own mistakes and the unintended consequences that unknowingly follow our decisions.
At the beginning we see a struggling man looking to avoid the ways of his past, something which he may have seen as the easy road at the time but now is or has been in his self administered rehabilitation with his farm and his children. Here the struggle may be too much to handle and he justifies his decision in returning to his old ways to make it through the impoverished times that have followed his wife's death. The psychology is not obvious in this film but runs far deeper than most films by a mile. We set the stage to see an efficient assassin that has turned around return to the world he did everything to avoid, and return he does.
The most incredible dynamic here is that Munney is the clear villain in perspective, but that Hollywood cliche is more blurred here than any other movie I have ever seen (even the Godfather). The man we essentially find ourselves rooting against (Hackman) is a man of the law but ironically we find ourselves caring for the killer played by Eastwood. He is an anti-hero in which we must question our justification in liking him. The idea of revenge seems as natural as breathing in this setting, so we cheer as this killer steps onto his stage one last time to show his would be contenders who is the baddest cowboy of them all. It is what Westerns are all about.
In addition, the film appreciates the beautiful North American landscapes like very few films do and does so with brilliant artistic photography and the soundtrack's emotional one string notes add to the raw style of the film. Eastwood's direction suggests a man who truly loves the Western and he is the king of that genre...sorry Duke.",1024963200,11,2326,4.580335731414868
103248,3,0790729644,"'Unforgiven' is a good story which is bogged down by too much manly talk.  Gene Hackman, of course, gives the best performance as a paranoid, dictatorial sheriff of the town of Old Whiskey.  After kicking English Bob unconscious, Hackman is at his absolute scariest.  But the scenes with Clint Eastwood are boorish and embarrasing.  The worst is when Morgan Freeman asks  Eastwood if he misses sex.  It is supposed to be funny, but is unnecessary and bad.  The film tries to make Eastwood, who was once an assasin,  look like some born-again saint.  Although it is plausable, I found it hard to believe because Eastwood was both the director and main actor.
The plot is about three assasins who are supposed to to kill one man.  This man has slashed a woman's face, but wasn't punished for it.  The film has some tense moments, espicially the final shootout between one man and an entire bar full of people (even though it was very unrealistic).  'Unforgiven' has a lot of talk about past shootouts and how once Eastwood was the best dualer of them all.  Then there is more talk about some other shootouts.  Some may find that interesting, but to me it was just boorish.  See it for Hackman's performance though.",1021766400,2,1212,4.677725118483412
103249,5,0790729644,"Although I don't like cowboy movies but this movie seen nice to me. It had some nice parts, some bad part and many different Motions. If I rate this movie it would be an R because there are some scenes that kids can't watch. Like sex, valence, starvation and etc. There are some ladies in the town for sex and they get money for that. Western films have always featured gunplay between the good guys and bad guys, but traditionally, it was kind of a softened violence. You shoot somebody, he falls down cleanly. No pain, no blood, and no real responsibility or consequence placed anywhere. When maverick director (Sam Peckinpah) arrived on the scene, he gave the world a taste of a Western movie most weren't ready for one where bullets actually hurt and spilled blood, and one where the killer often had to watch his dying prey struggle for a last breath. He plays Will Munny, an aging farmer who looks and sounds nothing like the heartless gunslinger he's reputed to be. Throughout the films, we learn bits and pieces of the Munny legend, but have a hard time ascribing it to this careworn man who can barely ride a horse now. ""I ain't like that anymore,"" he protests over and over again.
Directed by (Clint Eastwood). Eastwood puts in an excellent performance as the retired killer Muny, saved from his life of thievery and murder by his late wife. Now, he really trying to support his children with no income, he is tempted back to his killing ways by the detective offered by the women of a brothel, one of whom's number has been badly beaten and disfigured by a drunken ranch-hand.
 The film follows Eastwood as he wrestles with his desire to honour his wife's memory and his need to feed his children by returning to the killer that, he fears, is his true nature. Meanwhile word of the bounty has spread and the events spiral out of control as the sheriff (Gene Hackman) deals with the guns for hire that ride into town.
 While all the supporting cast are excellent Gene Hackman's Oscar winning performance even manages to eclipse Eastwoods as the brutal Sheriff. He beats one of the bounty hunters, English Bob (Richard Harris) almost to death and then explains to a journalist, in one of the film's stand out scenes, how men like he and Muny are so successful at killing. The mood moves from light banter to life threatening seriousness...and back again, with just one move of his head.
One of the greatest Westerns ever made? Certainly. Although the fact it's a western is really secondary. In truth it's a tale of the nature of evil and the nature of man.
Overall, though, this film is indeed worth of the accolades it received. One more I would like to offer, this is one of Clint Eastwood's finest performances ever. His acting is largely what makes Munny so real to us, and thereby makes the movie's message that much more powerful. But the entire cast is first rate, starting with Gene Hackman, who earned his second Academy Award for his work in this film. And, of course, the always excellent (Morgan Freeman) and Richard Harris, who has a couple of the movie's best scenes.  As I mention before this movie was great mostly for adults. It had more valences, killing each other badly.",1021507200,,3200,4.610526315789474

103251,5,0790729644,"There is no good and there is no bad in this movie. Compared to the great old westerns like Rio Bravo, this is completely different kind of a beast. There are no completely good characters and there are no completely bad characters in this film. Everything is grey. The movie is great ending to Eastwood's western roles. If I could ask one thing from mr Eastwood, that would be 'no more westerns, the Unforgiven was perfect'. I must say that this movie is not the best western - no - this is the best movie ever.
When I first saw this movie this was the first role I saw Morgan Freeman at after 'Robin Hood', after many succesfull movies I still consider this his best performance. As with mr. Eastwood, the role comparable only with the one in 'In the Line of Fire'. Gene Hackman in the role of the sadistic sheriff Little Bill makes the best performance that he has made on his long and succesfull career. To today their performance seems to last, great work indeed. As well as Eastwoods directing, well, maybe it suffices to say that he won the best picture and best directing Academy Award for the picture. What is shame, is that the he didn't get recoqnition of the acting performance, which was, to my opinion, best there has been.
In risking sounding chauvinistic, this is a man's movie. In saying of this I don't mean that a woman could not like this movie or even love it, I just feel that it appeals to men much more than women. There are no central roles for women in this movie. Though the women are in the midst of the actions of the movie, they are the driving force that make this movie to happen.",1017446400,,1612,4.376666666666667

It's dark and somber, there are very few gunfights and there is little of that catsup looking blood they used in the sixties ones. This is the anti-western. It makes you wonder why you liked these movies in the first place, these are dispicable people. That being said you still can't not admire Eastwood's charecter, as flawed as he is.
The movie bookends itself flawlessly, making you wonder what the whole point of it all was in the first place.",1014163200,,527,4.5
103253,5,0790729644,"Very much of what this movie has done for its director, its genre, and the world in general has already been said. I won't spend much time in rehash, except to say that it's easy to become cynical as to whether commercial entertainment is still capable of approaching, even getting within the same emotional nation of real human tragedy. Then you see a movie like this and realize that tragedy -- meaning the creation of a symbolic human story to provoke emotion -- can still be created after all. Simply the most deeply despairing and horrifically beautiful movie of the 1990's,at least that I've ever seen. Simultaneously it shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath with other westerns, with idealized plots and cornball heroism, and yet the power of this movie is magnified if you can compare it to archtypal westerns.
I'm not here to rehash the plot or the acting, I assume you've seen it. I wanted to speak against people who see it as politically correct, as anti-violence as a trend, or as self-betraying by the climactic scene. It's sad to watch people fail to understand that Clint Eastwood isn't repudiating his previous message when he exterminates the sheriff and everyone around him in the closing minutes. The entirety of the movie is about Eastwood's brief vision of a world with some meaningful concept of human worth and spiritual value, represented by his wife, dead before the story begins. The high point of Eastwood's character is the first time we see him, and from there he slides into damnation. Damnation is reflected by the sqaulor, amorality, and arbitrary injustice of the world around him, up to and including his enitre bounty hunt.
Eastwood's struggle to hold on to a self-vision, a memory of redemption, goes for the first two hours. When he chugs down the bottle of whiskey as the sun sets and goes of to avenge Morgan Freeman in the following scenes, Eastwood is as dead --physically reborn, viscerally alive, but spiritually dead -- as his victims, and he knows it, and is beyond caring. A movie about the relentless and brutal truth of human nature, and the fraility of attempts to transcend it. A movie of failure disguised as power, which destroys all the genre exercises which came before. And if you couldn't tell, deeply moving for me personally.",1012176000,15,2288,4.824427480916031
103254,1,0790729644,"This is probably my favourite movie in my collection, yet it is definitely the worst DVD.  Why?  Where do I start?  Firstly, the box clearly states that there are theatrical trailers - where are they?  There are numerous dark indoor scenes in the movie and there just isn't enough contrast to see the details, even if I turn the contrast all the way up (guess the details just aren't there on the DVD!).  The brighter outdoor scenes look grainy.  This DVD has absolutely no features worthy of mention.  It's just a bunch of text that contains a short bios on each of the 4 leading men, a 1 page production note, 4 movie suggestions (with not even a teaser or DVD cover shot of any of them) and a list of awards that it won.  It also has a pan-scan version on one side but honestly, who buys a DVD to watch in pan-scan???  No director's comments, outtakes, deleted scenes, documentary, photos, interviews, nuthin'.  Surely, a film as significant as this deserves a better treatment.  I am sure the quality of the original print is not like this so it must be the DVD transfer itself.  Could it be due to the DVD's age and the transfer process wasn't as developed back then?  Surely a re-release which amends these issues wouldn't hurt (on 2 discs and a nice leather case please).  Just hope we don't have to wait for the 25th anniversary of the film to see this.  ;)
Like I said, best movie in my collection, worst DVD I ever bought, very disappointing.
In short, if you love the flick, then you must buy it.  If you are a feature freak and/or an audio/video phile, you must steer (pun intended) clear.
Another thing worthy of mention which I don't see in many reviews is the theme music.  The haunting music as the ""intemperate disposition"" text scrolls up the screen at the end is one of the highlights of the movie for me.",1011484800,11,1824,4.42942942942943

Instead, Unforgiven takes time to tell its story and it saves the gunfighting until later.  This movie has to be one of the most realistic westerns that have ever been made.  It isn't like the westerns that come out today that have cowboys who look like they could be super-models, the movie actually tells and shows the viewer how the west really was, it was a struggle for suvival and it was a sad, ugly place.  The movie is about how a town prostitute is cut-up by a cowboy and how the other prostitutes hire Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Jaimz Woolvett to go and murder the two men who commited the crime.

Unforgiven is unlike many of Clint's other westerns in that it explores the pain and anguish of death, and the audience is also exposed. Younger and squemish viewers may not find the violoence appropriate, but it certainly is vital to the theme of the picture. For those who are interested in Eastwood's action (as seen in Dirty Harry et al), the ending with the big ""shoot out,"" where he declares he'll hunt down and kill any man's family, friends, and dog, if he tries to kill him may please, but overall the film is very melancholy, and certainly oscar material.",1007078400,,750,4.562962962962963

  Eastwood is William Munny, a retired gunfighter who accpets a job to kill two men who raped a prostitute.  Morgan Freeman is Ned Logan, his old partner who accompanies Munny and young killer Scofield Kid to the small town of Big Whiskey, where the targets are hiding.
  Richard Harris gives a small but memorable performance as a cocky, over-confident shooter who thinks he can out-fox the law.  but the best performance may be Gene Hackman, who portrays Little Bill, the town's corrupt sherrif who rules the area with an iron fist.
  Munny and friends do succeed in slaying the two rapiers, but not before Little Bill captures and kills Ned.  an outraged Munny and the Schofield Kid eventually pay Little Bill a visit.  the last sequence is bone-shattering.

103262,5,0790729644,"In a true sense, Clint Eastwood & writer David Peoples have created the first Anti-western in this tale of violence, vengeance and half-truths. Eastwood plays the anti-hero William Munny, once a vicious killer, now reformed eking out an existence for his two motherless children by pig farming. To save his children from this hapless fate he agrees to go on one last mercenary killing to avenge a prostitute whose face, eyes, ears and teets were cut up by some clients or so he's heard. But the truth of it is less than the fiction as the whore's story, like so many tales from the old west, is continually embellished. Urged on by the raging Schofield Kid, a haplessly poor-sighted lad who only dreams of the notoriety his killing might bring, Munny enlists the aid of Morgan Freeman, his old partner. Munny so rusty he can no longer aim well and so long out of the saddle he can't even stay on his horse, he heads out with the other two avenging or fallen angels to Big Whiskey to hunt down the killers for the promise of the whore's gold. Although some might consider the character insignificant, Richard Harris, as English Bob, the Duke (Duck) of Death, further illustrates the fallacy of the old west allure. Gene Hackman as the sadistic Little Bill Daggett, the sheriff of Big Whiskey, further blurs the lines between good and evil as the townspeople wince from the pain he inflicts on English Bob, Munny and finally on Ned Logan (Freeman). Frances Fisher, a lone voice crying in the wilderness, demands justice for the unfortunate girl and all women despite their station in life. Saul Rubinek as an old west biographer, is reminiscent of those mesmerized by car wrecks or burning buildings. A cub-reporter, only concerned for the most engrossing story, he hops from supposed hero to supposed hero never once looking beneath the surface of their stories. In his review, Leonard Maltin feels the movie drags in the middle, but the slow paced path the trio takes amidst the beautiful countryside, like the gentle but haunting score, only serves as the antithesis to the movie's impending violent conclusion. When I first saw this movie at the theater, I whispered to my companion ""this is going to win best picture."" It also went on to win Eastwood best director and Hackman best supporting actor. Whether you love westerns or hate them this film will satisfy you. There's no glamour in killing, but Munny (Eastwood), whether fueled by his sense of justice or just whiskey, marshals up the malicious character buried deep within him and perhaps buried deep within all of us. Finally, as this morality play draws to a close, we are asked the question why Claudia, Munny's deceased wife a woman not without prospects, ever ""loved"" such a desperate character. Perhaps he, like all the characters, had it coming. Just like we all do, even if we are unforgiven.

D Wood & J Mark see this as some allegory for America or banter that it's liberals playing conservatives.  They need to grow up just like the Western did.  For years Hollywood portrayed the Western as a pristeen fantasy place with white hats chasing after the black hats, but it's just not that clear cut except in their own little minds emphasis on little.  One moral they seem to have missed from Unforgiven is that although killing is a terrible thing to do, sometimes it's the only thing that you must do, but it's not the ONLY thing you should do.  I am sure these idiots would bring popcorn and raisinettes to an execution because they're just those types of people.  And those who find it slow (and you know who you are), you're probably under the age of 10 or at least mentally under 10 and can't see that it's more exciting to be lead down a prim rose path and then shockingly be pelted with individual or random acts of violence instead of your typical slasher movie with a spewing of blood every minute.  If you didn't wince from what Sheriff Bill Dagget did to the Duck or William Munny, you've never experienced pain.  Now don't get me wrong, I love the Lone Wolf & Cub series with its spew after spew of blood, but you really can't take them too seriously.  But if you want mindless blood spurting entertainment re-rent ALL the Friday the 13th or the Nightmare series -- leave the serious films to the Adults.",998697600,3,4286,4.673740053050398
103263,5,0790729644,"I love westerns, but this one goes far beyond any one I have ever seen. I suppose that most of us are used to westerns where the hero represent the cowboy knight in shining stirrups who saves the day at full personal risk and without reward, and never looses his cool. This film takes this myth and brings it down to earth.
It's a story about a legendary ex-cold-blooded-murderer, who returns to his old business for one last job. What brings him back to his old line of work is simply money - no ideal or heroic act. Throughout the entire story, the viewer's perception on ""who's the bad guy and who's the good guy"" is constantly changing, indicating a superb screenplay performed by a superb cast & crew.
Most of the film is slow and calm, but you can feel the tension building up for the last act, where the entire story takes a 180-degree turn (don't worry - I won't tell). If you'll pay attention, you'll notice that when the change occurs (and you'll notice it - I promise you) a wind suddenly starts to blow - an age-old motif for change.
The acting and directing in this film is superb, both by Clint Eastwood (Lead and Director), and by the wonderful Gene Hachman. The film won four Academy Awards, each of them fully deserved.

103267,5,0790729644,"Clint Eastwood held onto the David People's script for Unforgiven for over 10 years.  Knowing it was something special, he wanted to be mature enough, as both an actor and a director, to do it justice.  It was a wise decision.
Eastwood aged into the character of William Munny, chiseled, worn-looking, and I was quite surprised at how well he did with the role.  Munny is a haunted man, burdened with the memories of a violent past and the ghosts of many murders.  His denials ""I was drunk"" or ""I don't remember"" are belied by the guilty flicks of his eyes or the thousand yard stare when memory does come back ""remember that drover I shot...whose teeth came out the back of this neck?  He didn't do anything...."".  It is all there in Eastwood's face and eyes when later in the film in his fever delirium William Munny sees the Hell he fears is waiting for him for his sins.
Reformed by a beloved wife, now dead, and raising 2 children on a failing pig farm, Munny and his old partner Ned (Morgan Freeman) are lured out of retirement for one more killing for money.  But these old outlaws are different men now, older & tired and domesticated, and it seems unlikely they can do the job.  We, like their young gunsel partner, the Scofield Kid, can't see the legendary hell-raiser and killer Munny in this haggard old man.
I note that some were put-off by Unforgiven, expecting a Clint Eastwood type western.  Unforgiven really isn't a typical Western...it is more a character study wrapped in a meditation on violence.
The violence in Unforgiven is not stylized or glamorized.  When the gunfighter English Bob (Richard Harris) gets the living tar kicked out of him by the sheriff Little Bill Dagget (Gene Hackman), he doesn't pop-up all fine an hour later.  Instead he is layed-up in a jail cell, bloody, swollen, and in pain.  When Little Bill dishes out the same to Eastwood later, William Munny is out for days and is scabbed and scarred afterward.  When Eastwood ambushes a cowboy, he dies slowly, in thirst and in pain. When Little Bill starts in on Ned, we and he know that it will be a long night of torture and pain.  When the Scofield Kid shoots a man in the privy, he is sickened by it and so should we be.
Violence begets more violence.  From the initial cutting of the prostitute that sets it all in motion, to the beatings and shootings, the violence here only causes more violence and most of it out of proportion to the crime and most of it, even the sanctioned violence of the Law, has little or nothing to do with justice.
Gene Hackman's Little Bill Dagget is a sadistic bully with a badge, his amiable facade masks a ruthless and mean killer.  The bemused twinkle in his eye can turn to a savage taunt in an instant. He enjoys beating people just a little too much, and he has the town cowed under his benevolent tyranny.  Hackman is great and deserved his Oscar.
The only nod to the conventions of the Western is in the last act, but we are ready for it.  As  William Munny swigs the first whiskey he's had since his wife reformed him we watch him become distant, stronger, icier and resolved, the legendary stone-cold killer we've been hearing about throughout the movie is now before us and out for revenge.
The rainy ride into town and the total surprise of the laughing and confident posse-in-the-making, the cool malevolence... ""he better arm himself if he's going to decorate his saloon with my friend""... and the chaotic, awkward, chance and luck shootout that kills the guilty and the innocent indiscriminately, caps the theme of the film... ""deserve's got nothin to do with it"".  Violence is just violence, it is haphazard and unfair.  It isn't pretty and it isn't justice.
And killers leave death in their wake and go on to ""prosper in Dry Goods"".
This is a beautifully realized film with a great cast. Eastwood's direction is fine.  His pacing here is deliberate, but may be off-putting to those expecting a more action-oriented film.  This is a mature work, it improves on repeat viewings. Each scene fits to lay the foundation for the climactic confrontation,which is one of the best ever.  The dialogue is nuanced and revealing of character and motivation.  This is first-rate filmaking.",989712000,22,4219,4.630872483221476

103270,5,0790729644,"Clint Eastwood's career in Westerns has pushed the envelope, for the style of cinematography, the moral indifference of its hero, and the way that each one has taken the dominant paradigm of the Western and reversed it to say something significant about the genre.
Eastwood's character, William Munny, is as unremarkable a man as he has ever portrayed: a failed pig farmer who turned away from a life of robbery and murder for the love of a wife who died and left him with two children.  Nothing about him suggests the sort of unholy strength which is the one trait all his characters had in common.  It is fully possible to pity Munny as a broken man whose best chance for happiness passed with his wife's death, and whose children's future depends on him returning to his former life as a killer.  When he sets out with Morgan Freeman and Jaimz Woolvett, you wonder if he won't be killed within the first few seconds of a confrontation.
Over the course of the film, the events suggest no clear relationship between what people receive and what they deserve.  Even with the cowboys that maimed her dead, the prostitute that they scarred for life will never reclaim her beauty, and her employment at the bordello will be for the little wages she can get as a maid.  Morgan Freeman, who killed no one and gave up his wages for partial absolution of his guilt, is tortured and killed.  In the words of Eastwood's character, ""we all have it coming,"" it being misery out of proportion to our failures and sins in this life.
Arguably, the climax of this film is as powerful as any he has ever done:  the mild-mannered farmer of the past is replaced by a feral hardness as Eastwood drinks the first whiskey he has had since his marriage.  He rides into town, and finds Gene Hackman and his entire posse celebrating with Morgan Freeman's body on display in front of the bordello.  Like a force of nature, he kills them all in turn, which is not what should happen with the sheer weight of numbers against him.  As the sheriff gasps his last few breaths, he protests angrily that he didn't deserve it, and that he had built a house.  Eastwood restates the theme with a terse, ""Deservin's' got nothin' to do with it,"" and kills him for the cruelty that his job demanded of him.
Virtually every other Western, even if the hero dies in the end, reinforces some meaning for the hero's life; Josey Wales gains closure with his past, Shane died protecting the lives of other people, Will Kane stands up alone for the town that he believes in.  This film advances the dangerous idea that nothing needs to matter or make sense, and that hell has room enough for all of us whether or not we deserve to go.

As far as Clint Eastwood westerns are concerned, this was near the bottom of the barrell.  The story was difficult to follow and believe, and too pathetic for a western.  The whole movie lacked the teeth of Clint's other gritty westerns.  As far as modern Eastwood westerns is concerned, ""Pale Rider"" was better and that isn't saying much.  The ending is farfetched and the only good acting in it was done by Gene Hackman.  As far as an Eastwood movie, he's done much better.
The academy awards people began a sad trend of giving cheesy-boring movies best picture when they awarded ""Unforgiven"".

And I have to say hat's off to Gene Hackman who was beyond outstanding as Little Bill.  It was totally unexpected at least by me anyway.  I thought that Hackman was a terrible casting choice for a western sheriff but I was happy to be wrong.  To me his character was the most dispicable of the entire cast.  And he was the lawman.  'I guess you think i'm kickin' ya Bob'  Just histerical.
Clint's direction was perfect.  Subtle but poignant.  The scene where he and the kid had just killed the two protagonists was outstanding.  Viewing that open expanse put the indivduals burdens in the proper perspective in regard to how alone and singled out someone who commits murder must feel.

Instead all we have is an aged killer, notoriously known for his crimes, content to live the rest of his life on a small farm in the praries with his childern, wizened by the memory of his dead wife.  Gone are the days of shoot-em-ups at the O.K Corral with his friend, played by Morgan Freeman.  Gone are characters who are quick to pull the trigger.

Clint Eastwood has become probably one of the most gifted, thoughtful and quality directors around. This film is characteristically understated and overhwelmingly brilliant. Every scene has been carefully constructed, every shot has more intelligence in it than quite a few directors would invest in a whole film. Clint Eastwood could make the worst of plots seem quite plausible. With a solid story as told in Unforgiven, the direction of Clint and the great acting by all concerned, this film takes the genre into a completely new dimension.
The soundtrack too has been carefully thought out and uncharacteristically, for most directors, actually goes with the film.

In this sense, the film is a tremendous accomplishment for Clint Eastwood as an actor and a director. Eastwood plays a gun fighter whose career has largely subsided as the civilizing process has begun to displace the frontier mentality in the American West. Eastwood is hired by some prostitutes to settle a score with an abusive client. He and his party gun down the person but in the process they run afoul of the town's sheriff (masterfully played by Gene Hackman) who has legally sanctioned gun fighting of any sort. When Eastwood's partner is killed by the sheriff's posse, Eastwood returns to the town and single-handedly confronts them. The battle that ensues is somewhat unrealistic (Eastwood kills several men including the sheriff) but makes sense on a symbolic level. The untrammeled spirit of the frontier confronts its civilizing nemesis and wins even as it becomes an extinct phenomenon. The intense realism and Eastwood's subtle, understated performance are what make the film work. So much of the film is presented in a plain understated fashion, that by the time we get to the symbolic conclusion we still believe it is real.
After the gun battle, Eastwood pours himself a whiskey with his back to the door and his unloaded shotgun under his arm as the terrified survivors of the posse hide between buildings outside. When he is ready to leave, Eastwood shouts a warning that he will kill anyone he sees and if he is opposed, he will kill the individual and his wife. He leaves the bar, mounts his horse and rides off into the darkness in full view of the terrified posse.
Eastwood's departure is more than just a finale for the film. As he rides into the darkness he takes with him the individual will to settle disputes with violence. The defeated and humiliated posse survives with its mandate to expropriate the individual's recourse to violence. Eastwood may have won the last gunfight, but even he cannot prevent the elimination of private justice and the state's consolidation and ownership of violence.",980899200,,2144,4.941828254847645
103280,5,0790729644,This is the best western ever!  Clint Eastwood stars as a washed up old time outlaw turned pig farmer who is after a bounty from vengeful prostitutes.  He and Gene Hackman shine throughout the film and Freeman gives a respectable performance.  The final scene between Hackman and Eastwood is the highlight of the film.,977961600,,318,4.851851851851852
103281,4,0790729644,"It can be a little disconcerting, the sight of The Man With No Name tripping over pig s**t and falling clumsily off his horse.  But Eastwood is after more here than the heroic anonymity that that character afforded him.  No, his ""last"" Western (and I dare say this film proves that the genre is too flexible to be dead) deals with the nihilism of the old West, and the grey area between good and evil that the ""new"" kind of outlaw must deal with.  And how that outlaw is no longer a perfect, indestructible beast, but a man with tough choices to make.  Eastwood did a wonderful job putting all these issues up on screen.
Eastwood is a very interesting actor.  He really isn't technically proficient, and if he's given too much dialogue, he's liable to trample all over the reality of the moment.  But give him a chance to stare at you with those steely eyes, or answer a threat from an enemy with a simple ""Yeah"", and he'll knock you out of your boots.  He gives himself ample opportunities to work to those strengths here.
Gene Hackman, on the other hand, can put the fear of God in you with a twinkle of his eye.  I don't think this man has it in him to deliver a bad performance.  And here he gets to play the Gene Hackman role that defines all Gene Hackman roles.  His Little Bill is authoritative, fearless, feared, and especially charismatic.  Also good here are Morgan Freeman, although a tad underused in what amounts to a sidekick role, and Richard Harris as an English gunfighter whose legend may be purely mythical.  Unimpressive in the face of these acting giants is Jaimz Woolvett as the Schofield Kid.  I suppose his youthful bluster is expected, he being the new generation and all.  But his delivery felt a little too over-the-top, especially in a movie striving for realism.
I hesitate in praising this movie too much, for it didn't stick to its guns, so to speak.  I'm speaking of the ending, and I promise here not to reveal any spoilers.  Let's just say that if the object was to turn the Western on its head, then I don't believe that they chose the appropriate way to tie up the narrative.  That being said, what we have here is a highly suspenseful and rousing Western, albeit one where the good guys and the bad guys aren't so clearly delineated.",975715200,,2270,4.484184914841849
103282,3,0790729644,"The real star of this movie is Gene Hackman, who is in most of the scenes. I was disappointed in this movie, in that I had hoped it would have been the types of Clint Eastwood western I've always liked.  Instead, it is too preachy, and listening to Eastwood's character moralize about killing and violence was a bit too much.  What little action there was, however, was excellent. If one is viewing ""Unforgiven"" and expecting to see another ""High Plains Drifter"" or ""The Outlaw Josey Wales,"" they will be sadly disappointed.  Eastwood could have done better and made a western more true to his form.",975715200,4,599,4.685714285714286
103283,5,0790729644,"Overall Unforgiven takes a back seat to the Lorne Spaghetti westerns - The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly and Once Upon A Time In the West - but it does something that those didn't.  It brings in consequence.  The ""Kid"" realizing that there are consequences to taking a person's life.  So many movies today present violence with a ""fire & forget"" attitude.  It's shocking to see it so raw and to see the characters reacting to the violence: Freeman's character not being able to finish someone off and the ""kid"" deciding that he was finished with guns.  Eastwood's performance, particularly the last sequence, is startling.  It contrasts with his actions in most the movie.  We only hear that he was once a ruthless killer.  This makes it all the more potient.  Yes, he could kill anybody that got in his way.  His cold stare at Hackman just before he pulls the trigger will never leave my mind.  Now...as for the DVD presentation.  The sound is perfect.  Rain, horses, jingling spirs, gunshots, wind thru the grass, it's all there.  As for the picture it's a mixed bag.  The color occationally doesn't seem right.  People's faces are unnaturally pinkish and even purple.  At times there seems to be a double image or outline.  I was unable to watch it in the dark (perferred) because many scenes have areas that come off too bright and hurt my eyes.  Finally, the extras.  Or lack thereof.  Movie is a 4.5.  The DVD is a 3.5.  For those who said this movie isn't violent enough, I suggest you visit the Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Swartznegger section of your video store.",974592000,3,1569,4.625454545454545
103284,4,0790729644,"This movie had only one real negative that I can think of.  Personally, I found the profanity a bit much in some scenes.  That is really only a minor quibble.  I think I would have enjoyed it more on television.
On to the positives.  Eastwood's best film.  Clint gives a powerful preformance.  The running gag about Will Munny not being the man he used to be is turned heart-wrenchingly tragic in the film's most powerful scene.  Not to give away to much but it involves the prostitute under the tree.  The best scene in the whole film.
The Schofield Kid is also extremely well acted.  He manages to make his character at once humorous and infuriating.  His confontration with Morgan Freeman over shooting a hawk is on of the film's great plot twists.
Especially moving is the scene where Eastwood and Freeman snipe at their prey.  The effects of violence are well realized in this movie.  No glorification to be found here.
Gene Hackman gives a stunning protrayal of Little Bill Daggett.  How he manages to make him by turns hysterically funny and yet menacing I'll never know.  He earned his Oscar.
Extremely touching is the simple truth that for once a man changed.  William Munny was changed by a woman and her love.  I never found the explanation for her choice to love a man so given to violent distemper.  I could only marvel at it.  As I did with most of this movie.",973728000,,1374,4.538775510204082
103285,4,0790729644,"I enjoy some aspects of this movie.  I especially enjoy the evident craft that Eastwood endowed it with.  I enjoy Richard Harris's performance very much.  I like the symbolism (ie: William Munny's dead wife's name was ""Feathers"" and she is definitely Munny's ""good angel""), and I like the mystery of the ending...Mrs. Ansonia Feathers finds no more answers to her questions about her daughter's choice of man than the audience does.  We are left, with her, to ponder the nature on good and evil in human character.  I do not, however, agree that this is the best western ever made.  The movie that honor belongs to never appeared on the big screen and belongs to LONESOME DOVE.  Even if the object of the story is to present the American West in a coldly realistic fashion, richness in writing and characterization are not crimes as UNFORGIVEN seems to imply by the sterility of the writing.  LONESOME DOVE portrayed realistically the aspects of the American West, the cowboy, the gunfighter, prostitutes, etc; but filled the viewer with such empathy that it was a full, if bitter, experience as opposed to UNFORGIVEN'S unfortunate sense of emptiness and bewilderment.  I recommend UNFORGIVEN but not as highly as I would like to.",973036800,,1230,4.903381642512077
103286,5,0790729644,"For any fan of Eastwoods Spaghetti westerns, or anyone who simply enjoys a good movie, this is nothing short of a masterpiece.  Eastwood's character, a washed up aging gunfighter, could be any of his earlier characters from Josey Wales, High Plains Drifter, A Fistful of Dollars. Heck, it could even be Dirty Harry.  Seeking redemption, this anti-hero returns to the only thing he knows: whiskey and violence.  But the message comes through loud and clear that this answer leads nowhere fast.
This movie includes one of the great lines of Eastwood's career: ""It's a hell of a thing killing a man- you take away everything he's got- and everything he's ever gonna have.""
It also has outstanding performances from Gene Hackman and others.  Highly recommended.",972864000,,757,5.032
103287,5,0790729644,"Now this is a film. Eastwood's seminal Western should really have marked the end of the genre - 'Unforgiven' says all there is to say about a time that has been eulogised as some kind of mythical golden age throughout the history of Hollywood. The fact that he hasn't made a film fit to wipe the shoes of this 1992 classic since emphasises it's power: when 'Unforgiven' ends it feels as though something in the air has changed - as though an era has ended. This is moviemaking at it's darkest, starkest and most brutally honest. The resonance of Unforgiven carries greater weight because Eastwood's name is attached to it - the most famous cowboy of the silver screen, bar John Wayne, spends the first ten minutes of the film rolling around on his backside in a pigsty, and the last 30 minutes ranting deliriously while in a fever.  William Munny is no hero - he is the kind of ruthless killer that Eastwood would have blown away in a stylised hail of lightning-fast bullets in earlier films. Munny is an aged, poverty-stricken widower who is utterly ashamed of his violent past and briefly found redemption through love.  However, his wife is now dead, and the only way he can see to support his children is to take on one last bounty hunting job.  The fact that the wanted men are responsible for mutilating a prostitute seems to lend justice to the quest, and Munny succeeds in drumming up the support of his old partner, played by Morgan Freeman. Together with a young would-be gunslinger who is full of the bravado of youth, the three head for the hills and straight into the hands of Little Bill, the corrupt and sinister sherriff (played by Gene Hackman in Oscar-winning form), another killer from the old days. From their first meeting, a sense of impending doom casts its shadow over the film. We learn that the most effective killers are the ones who shoot their opponents in the back, or unarmed - the ones who keep a straight head, not the best looking ones who are fastest on the draw.  Eastwood, aided with a brilliant script by David Webb Peoples, constantly undermines the traditional values of the old Westerns. There is no clear cut sense of good versus evil or justice prevailing over malice. When the kid, clearly feeling greater remorse than he had anticipated after shooting one of the wanted men, and in an attempt to justify his act, says to Munny ""he had it coming"" , Munny replies ""we all have it coming kid"". And later Munny, describing what it is like to destroy another human being, however much they ""deserved"" it, says ""it's a hell of a thing killing a man, taking away all he's got - and all he's ever gonna have"". This is the crux of `Unforgiven' - death is final, irreversible, and comes to us all whether we deserve it or not.
Unforgiven is a beautifully shot movie.  The gorgeously evocative cinematography displays the colours of autumn at their most poignant and the descent into winter clearly mirrors the coldness at the heart of the film: vengeance must be bought, but at a high price -  their can be no redemption for the avengers, no satisfaction for the avenged. In fact nobody benefits from the terrible denouement, and all we are left with is the knowledge that, even when men do evil things for good reasons, the things they do are still evil.",972864000,,3290,4.596252129471891
103288,5,0790729644,"I've just finished seeing the film so many had urged me to over the years,and I can tell you this: it was worth it.
  In the recent years I've caught a glimpse of the nature of the movie here and there, and the main phrase that repeated itself was this movie is "" a requiem to the west"". I can say that I completely accept this notion ,for once I see it eye to eye with all those critics.
  It seems like a realistic movie, giving the feeling that things could've been the way they're presented. I feel like nobody's trying to fool me ,to sell me another fantasy about how heroic the life of men and women were back then .Instead ,I'm given something different than before, a new perspective from another angel of the events ,difficulties and problems people had to deal with in this life style.
  I admired the way the prostitudes were shown, not as objects ,but as human beings, though NOT in the eyes of most of the characters. I admired the character of Eastwood as the sphinkx who regained his old outstanding abilities as a gunman,and did what he had to do at the purifying endind scene.
  ""Unforgiven"" is not intended for one deed ,but for two. and that's ,too,TWO good reasons to watch this film .",972259200,,1205,4.37219730941704
103289,5,0790729644,"Gone are the lightning-quick reflexes, the heroic gunfighters and the clean death duels. Unforgiven strips all the myth and glory out of the western genre and we're left with a story that rings a bit more true than most other films of this genre.
Clint Eastwood plays William Munny, a retired killer determined to take on one last job to help support his family. As director of the film, Eastwood goes to great pains to differentiate this tale from the many other westerns he's made. The vicious gunfighters in popular lore are revealed most often to be drunken sociopaths who are usually more lucky than good. Munny knows the myths for what they are. He doesn't waste time quick drawing and spraying bullets around the room when careful aim and direct shooting are more likely to win the day...especially with half a bottle of whiskey in the belly and a nice helping of luck, that is!
Fine acting by Eastwood and co-stars Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman, coupled with a terrific screenplay and fine directorial effort also be Eastwood make this movie well deserving of the numerous Academy Awards it won.
This movie doesn't set out to nullify all the wonderful westerns that precede it, but it certainly succeeds at taking a fresh look at one of the more popular genres in American film.",971827200,6,1288,4.754464285714286
103290,5,0790729644,"Eastwood hands up his hallmark performance both as an actor and director in Unforgiven, a film that offers an unblinking examination of the myth of the old west.
There are no heroes in this film. Hackman, Eastwood,  Freeman, and Harris all portray reformed or semi-reformed  gunslinger/murderers, each of whom have found their own way to deal with  the dark pall their past acts set over their lives.
Everyone gets set on  a collision course when a young prostitute is savagely slashed by an irate  cowboy. She survives the attack, and the punishment handed down by Sheriff  Little Bill (Hackman)is so inconsequential that the other Bordello girls  (led by Francis Fisher) place a bounty on the head of the cowboy. Munny  (Eastwood's character) hears of the bounty after being contacted by a brash  young gunslinger the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), a relative of one of  Munny's former outlaw friends. Munny is eventually drawn into the murder  for hire scheme, with dire consequences for all involved.
Eastwood,  Freeman, Hackman, and Harris all hand up great performances with a  supporting cast that strikes just the right notes. There are no ""man  with no name"" characters in this film. No unbelievably brave  characters set against a dramatic western skyline. Instead, Munny is  plagued by guilt and regret, and spends more than a little time blaming his  wife's premature death on his past ways. Munny has to focus on the fragile  existence of his two small children on a failing hog farm to scare up any  enthusiasm whatsoever for this mission, and Eastwood's performance of  Munny's half heartedness in this regard is superb.
This film has been  criticized for its' ending, which has been said to give in to the very  western mythology that it was trying to de-bunk. However, I don't see it  that way. The violence and the threats of violence are gratuitous, but they  usually are when fueled by alcohol and grief. These scenes fold neatly into  the story line without hitting any false notes.
Easily one of the top ten  Westerns ever made (it's in my top five). Strong buy.",964742400,2,2085,4.902578796561604
103291,5,0790729644,"Unforgiven is surely Clint Eastwood's greatest achievement.  For Clint fans like myself, it has plenty of great lines to recite.  It is a morally troubling film in that the only character who really deserves to die is  Clint's character, William Munny.  The most compelling character is the  excellent Gene Hackman as Little Bill Dagget, the town sherrif, who while  he has a bit of a mean sadistic streak in him, is basically trying to keep  the peace in his town and will go to any lengths to keep things orderly.  One of my favorite parts of the movie is when he humiliates English Bob,  aka The Duck of Death, played by Richard Harris.  Jaimz Woolvet puts in a  good performance as the Schofield Kid, whose boasting masks his lack of  gunfighting experience.  Morgan Freeman is good as Ned, Munny's old  sidekick who tags along with Munny and Schofield but is tormented by his  inner doubts about what he is doing.  In a sad irony, he ends up dying for  the murders committed by his partners.  Also noteworthy is Saul Rubinek as  the parasitical writer who will latch onto any person who he feels will  provide him with a good story.  Eastwood's Munny is fascinating in his  transformation from clumsy pig farmer in the film's opening to a fearsome  avenging angel at the end as he rides off in the pouring rain to the sound  of the menacing music.
If you are looking for a rousing adventure  story, then Unforgiven will disappoint you, but if you want to see a moody,  complex anti-Western, then I highly recommend this film.",963014400,2,1530,4.615671641791045

She laughed at me and called  me a macho pig and two weeks later I was eating cold pizza alone in a  studio apartment with a sinkful of dirty dishes. Anyway.  Unforgiven is a  perfect combination of script and cast, a movie that never could have been  made even ten years before because Hollywood would not have allowed such a  complete debunking of a genre and because only an older Clint Eastwood  could have pulled off the hero/anti-hero's existential conflict.  Beautifully filmed, written, and acted, Unforgiven finally depicts the west  as it may have been, in razor contrast to Eastwood's previous westerns (all  entertaining, but never long on believability). Until Blood Meridian is  made into a movie (and God I hope that never happens) this is as close as I  imagine you would want to get to the west in the late 1800's, and if you  can take a little knife work and some cold blooded killings, this is a  wonderful movie with many subtle and not so subtle lessons about our common  humanity.",962409600,4,1194,4.641148325358851

103294,5,0790729644,"With ""Unforgiven"", director Clint Eastwood delivered his best film to date. The Oscars and countless other awards for this film were entirely merited.
Eastwood gives heroism and old Western clichees a  backseat and gives his movie a more realistic tone. He destroys the myth  that justice always triumphed in the good old west (one of the cowboys that  Eastwood shoots actually did not do anything wrong and Morgan Freeman is  sadisticly tortured though he did not kill anybody). The film is full of  strong, poetic imagery and the performances by Eastwood, Hackman, Freeman  and the supporting cast are all excellent. One should also not forget to  mention screenwriter David Webb Peoples (""Blade Runner"", ""12  Monkeys""), whose script is one of the finest in the history of the  genre.
""Unforgiven"" proved that many critics underestimated  Clint Eastwood. He showed that he is able to make a subtle, haunting and  intelligent film that is also entertaining.

Garnering three of the ""major"" awards is impressive and they are what make the film a  memorable and enjoyable experience.  Eastwood the director is in top form.  He has always displayed a steady hand in directing his stories and actors  and he doesn't disappoint here.  Nothing flashy but it is his understated  direction that leads this film to it's climax.  In less capable hands, a  director may be apt to moralize or preach.  Eastwood capably lets the story  (overlooked as an original screenplay) tell itself.  His turn as the lead  character -- William Munny -- is also an underplayed, nuanced part.  I  think it is one of his best acting jobs.  He carries a grim outlook and  those set, steely eyes convey all of the emotions the character feels.  In  a movie with so much else that is good, his performance is not to be  ignored.  Gene Hackman is outstanding in his portrayal of Little Bill  Daggett, the sheriff of Big Whiskey, WY.  His performance is both blustery  and low-keyed.  It is a credit to Hackman to know how to pull if off  effortlessly.  The movie itself is the real star.  It plays on so many  levels and gives a lot of shades of gray that really blow off the Westerns  of old.  There is no good guy in the white hat.  In fact, there is little  good to be found in the movie.  Most of the men and women are scoundrels or  people of ill-repute.
