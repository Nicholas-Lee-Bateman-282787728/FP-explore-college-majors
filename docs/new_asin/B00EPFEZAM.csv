5932630,5,B00EPFEZAM,This is a wonderful Colombian production.  I saw it on TV and had to buy the complete series.  It got here very quickly and in wonderful condition.  I was thrilled with the packaging and the quality of the DVDs.  I recommend this series that retells the saga of a Colombia that was able to rise above the violence and corruption of Escobar to rebuild this beautiful and kind South American country.,1403654400,,398,4.563380281690141

5932632,5,B00EPFEZAM,"I just completed the ""Pablo Escobar: Patrn de Mal"" marathon...I could not put it down! The series is based on the book ""La Parbola de Pablo"" by Alonzo Salazar and real events, i.e., the reign of terror brought about by drug cartel boss Pablo Escobar. There is artistic license with the portrayal of the film's characters, as is done in many historical series (think ""Rome"", ""The Tudors"", ""The Borgias"", etc). Locations and time are identified, events are supplemented with news reel clippings. Good and evil--the choices and battles between good and evil---exist among all of us, within each one of us, and this message is in the forefront of every story within the larger story. Despite the cruel reality of this painful and frightening part of Colombia's history, the beauty of Colombia---her people, her landscape, her architecture, her language and idioms, culture and flavor are proudly and gorgeously depicted. Bien hecho! Well done! Hats off to everyone involved in creating and producing this series!",1402185600,7,1008,5.152439024390244

5932634,5,B00EPFEZAM,"While it is true that Pablo Escobar did a lot of harm to the Colombian people it is also true he did good to others.
This series has a lot of details and will give you a good idea why Pablo did what he did.
His obsession of being in politics was what really made him more violent.",1399593600,,280,3.8448275862068964

5932644,4,B00EPFEZAM,"The series is extremely good.  Well done, awesome actors, you get hooked.  Unfortunately quality control is not something that seems to have been taken into consideration when the DVDs were produced.  I had to return it the first time I bought it because one of the DVDs was bad.  I bought another set to send to someone overseas.  The same thing happened only this time I cannot return it because it is no longer with me.  A shame because the series is outstanding.",1423440000,,466,4.554216867469879

5932654,1,B00EPFEZAM,"Besides of what other audience may think. I bough the series to avoid the trash transmitted by TV commercials and ads. But this DVDs are encoded so you need to watch an entire set of trash and trailers for other movies every time you insert a disc. 11 minutes of trash before you are able to start watching a chapter (No you cannot fwd, hit menu, nothing). And on top of that another commercial so you can start your own business selling the DVD's.",1416787200,5,448,4.345238095238095

5932659,3,B00EPFEZAM,"If you're looking at this product I'm assuming you know something about the show which is a solid 5 stars. This box set however has several problems. It is split into three parts, each containing 5 discs. The first set out of the three had problems with playback through a couple of episodes as if the discs were scratched though they looked damage free. It's a shame since the transfers themselves are of really good quality. The second set had previews at the beginning of the discs that couldn't be skipped - you can't even fast forward them! It's a pain since there are several of these adverts. Playback is excellent in set two and three however. For the price point there is a lot of material and this is why I decided to keep the product instead of returning. If you're a fan of the show, this is a good set but be prepared to be frustrated as you have to skip some of the episodes in the beginning. If you're familiar with the storyline this shouldn't be much of a problem.",1412294400,3,981,4.366120218579235
5932660,5,B00EPFEZAM,"Gran serie realizada en Colombia por el Canal Caracol!. Una de las mejores series de capos que han hecho ltimamente, la calidad de actores se ve reflejada en la serie y la historia de el Capo Pablo Escobar esta muy bien contada.  Recomiendo Mucho la Serie para saber un poco de como fue este tiempo en Colombia.
Great Series. It tells the story of the DrugLord Pablo Escobar. The Colombian Actors did a great job on this series.",1410739200,,428,4.487179487179487

8608012,5,B00EPFEZAM,"What I like about this show is that it shows Pablo Escobar from multiple perspective. His family, his country, his countrymen, the good guys, bad guys, why he did what he did, etc. It's so much better than Netflix's NARCOS which was told almost exclusively from the point of view of the DEA.

Pablo is a fascinating character, a man that can one day give you money to get that surgery you need, and the next day he blows up a bus to scare a country into submission.

Some critics of this series have complained that Escobar is being humanized. What do they expect? Escobar was a human being. Evil? Yes, to his enemies and innocent people he was evil, but not to his family and the people he cared about. Monsters are for comic books, in real life, there are no monsters, just people who sometimes do awful things.

Either way, this show is pretty entertaining, there are wonderful supporting characters. Like the religious sicario that quotes the bible and pulls the trigger.

Overall, this show is a lesson that time doesn't pay. That even once you have money, you have to protect it, you live in fear of being arrested, murdered, your own family can't get asylum in Germany because your corrupt government is playing games with their lives.  What the German's did to Escobar's family is unforgivable.",1491782400,,1302,4.643478260869565

8608017,5,B00EPFEZAM,"It's a great fascinating story. Pablo the hero against the corrupt governments of Columbia and the US Of A. It's only missing one thing and this is just my simple opinion. It misses a great actor like Robert DeNiro, James Gandolfini, guys who can be fun, happy and in a second, you're life is dead because they thought you crossed them. This guy is missing it. But I haven't read much, seen much about Pablo. Maybe this guy hit it. That being said, I think if they found someone like James Gandolfini, this show would've been a lot better.",1435708800,,539,4.454545454545454

8608019,5,B00EPFEZAM,"I'm an English speaker who got this to practice my Spanish, without knowing much about Pablo Escobar or the history of Columbia. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this series. It's my understanding that the story is slightly fictionalized, still, the scenery, props and costumes are accurate, and they give the watcher a real feeling for the time period. The lead actor's performance is amazing; he is dedicated to the role and from what I read all of his mannerisms are based on the real Pablo's. I hope this actor won some awards for this series!",1434326400,,564,4.707070707070707
8608020,1,B00EPFEZAM,"I was really enjoying the series until I started on the 3rd part...all of a sudden the sound was distorting so badly that I had no option but to turn the volume right down and switch on the subtitles so I could understand what was happening. I tried this on both my computers and also my home entertainment system but the issue was definitely with the DVDs. As annoying as this was (I bought the series so that I could watch it in Spanish!) I tolerated this for the first 3 DVDs of Parte 3, but when I came to disc 4 of Parte 3 the disc would not work AT ALL; not on my computer, not on my laptop, not on my DVD player.  So now I'm stuck so close to the end without being able to finish the series that I paid for - I'm sure I could find pirated copies of this series that would work (and have better quality) than this crap.  In short - don't bother wasting your time buying this version.",1431734400,,889,4.016949152542373
