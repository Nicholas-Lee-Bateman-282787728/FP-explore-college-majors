8394761,5,B003DD0IL2,As THE CIRCUS (as of 2014) has not been released on the Blu-ray format in a Region One edition I was delighted to find this import. The picture quality is excellent and much nicer than the last Warner Brother DVD release which is speeded because it comes from a Pal prepared format. The only Extras on the Blu-ray release is the inclusion of the Chaplin short A DAY'S PLEASURE and a short picture gallery. If you have an interest in this Chaplin gem and want the best possible visual copy currently available then have no fear about purchases this import. I also bought Chaplin's 1952 LIMELIGHT as a Blu-ray import and am delighted with it also.,1392422400,2,645,4.568965517241379
