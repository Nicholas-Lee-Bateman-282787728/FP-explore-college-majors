8308872,3,B001HL01UU,"This home-grown film started out, if I understand correctly, as a trial of new film equipment. What results is a happy, goofy, spooky romp through some very pretty country. The cast looks to be having an excellent time, and the script delivers some funny lines. It's a spoof of some well used horror themes, but with a good bit of originality. Good, darkly funny ending.",1474156800,,370,4.707692307692308
