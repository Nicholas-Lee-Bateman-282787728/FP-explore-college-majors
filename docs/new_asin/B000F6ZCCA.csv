8118222,5,B000F6ZCCA,"This DVD presentation on the life, theology and philosophy of Dr. Norman Vincent Peale was very well done. The man who was born the son of a Methodist Minister in the humble little town of Bowersville, Ohio grew up to influence modern Christian thought throughout the world. His congregation in New York City still thrives to impact all of us. I highly reccomend this documentary to everyone.",1348531200,,392,4.865671641791045
