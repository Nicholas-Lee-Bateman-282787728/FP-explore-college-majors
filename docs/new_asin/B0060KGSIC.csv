4912737,1,B0060KGSIC,"This movie was so ridiculous, the story, costume design, sets, special effects, I couldn't finish it, and I ended up paying close to twenty dollars for it. The saving grace of the movie is supposed to be the fight scene between Jackie Chan and Donnie Yen, which was prettty good, but could not come close to saving this movie from total absurdity. The story about a woman dominated world, and men having to rally themselves against women, because the queen was turning men into a transgender species was too much. And the costume design and sets were garish, and made this movie look like a kindergardener's coloring book. Unwatchable and I tried two seperate times to finish it.",1339113600,,679,4.762711864406779

4912739,1,B0060KGSIC,"This is a movie that is having an identity crisis and just can't decide what it wants to be....a movie about Amazonian women, silly romantic teenagers, martial arts or some kind of weird fantasy. They threw everything in this but the kitchen sink and it shows, what a mess. I could barely watch it until the end. The plot is silly and the acting definitely sub par. The only good part in it was the fight scene between Jackie Chan and Donnie Yen but it's not worth watching just for that. I hope that having Daniel Wu play a eunuch in this strange movie will not cloud my love for his acting ability and sex appeal in every other movie I see him in from now on...that was just WRONG. What were you thinking accepting this role Daniel? Just an all around waste of a movie. Save your time and money and watch something else.",1334534400,7,822,4.309677419354839

4912743,5,B0060KGSIC,"Well Go USA Entertainment has been releasing exciting and entertaining Chinese dramas that I always enjoy, not only because of their great stories, but also due to their marvelous production qualities and historical significance. So, it was quite a surprise to watch ""Blade of Kings,"" a delightful film in the realm of fantasy or fiction, which is quite a fascinating departure of everything else that I have seen from Well Go USA.

The movie opens with ""In the ancient land of the Amazons near China... where men where sold as slaves, with rings and bells around their necks. They were insultingly called `Dumbbells'."" And right we go to this colorful town ruled by Amazons, in which men are treated like money, and where a powerful evil empress (Yin Qu) is in charge. It is around this time, and in a confusing way, that we learn that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Rebels stole a powerful stone plaque that keeps the evil queen in power. We then learn that ""if the stone plaque falls into the hands of the Star of Rex, and he solves the riddle and finds the Excalibur, there will be trouble."" The Star of Rex, who we don't know at this point, is the ""only person left on the family tree from the previous dynasty,"" before the evil queen took power. The evil queen sends the 13th Young Master or The Enforcer (Charlene Choi) to rescue the plaque before it falls in the hands of the Star of Rex. As destiny has it, she has to team up with Blue Bird (Gillian Chung), a slave trader, as well as two acrobats from a travelling show, Blockhead (Bo-lin Chen) and Charcoal Head (Jaycee Chan), in order that they can find the Star of Rex. Trouble is, one of the two men - Charcoal Head or Blockhead - is the Star of Rex. In their pursue, they will be assisted by General Lone (Donnie Yen), who also wants to overthrow the evil queen and save the men from oppression.

""Blade of Kings,"" which is also called ""The Twins Effect II,"" is quite enchanting and a true joy to watch. It has beautiful landscapes, colorful cinematography, amazing martial arts and swords fights - some of the best that I have seen, perfectly choreographed --, and fantastic acrobatics - quite a feast for your eyes. In addition, legendary Jackie Chan plays a guest role that you will never forget. This film was released in 2004, so Chan still had his chops. The Blu-ray edition also includes the DVD version of the film, a making-of documentary, and more. (Hong Kong, 2004. color, 106 min plus additional materials).

4912744,1,B0060KGSIC,"This is the ""in name only"" sequel to The Twins Effect which is actually a fun romp with some great action scenes. This movie on the other hand is a complete mess.

The acting is awful. The script demands than everyone in the cast act like an idiot and make stupid faces. There's ridiculous scenes such as when a group of men grow breasts or when Donnie Yen (Who plays a character NAMED ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Why?) is struck with a love potion.

People may flock to this because Jackie Chan and Donnie Yen have a fight scene, but it's a waste. It is such a derivative copy of Donnie's fight with Jet Li in Hero, that it's face-palmingly stupid. Key scenes from that fight are copied shot for shot because the film makers couldn't be bothered to be more creative. The rest of it is choppily edited and shot too close.

There are much better Chinese films that deserve an unaltered US release like Wu Xia, Woman Knight of Mirror Lake, and the underrated Wind Blast. Releases like this one just continue to give the false impression that Asian films aren't worth the trouble of bringing to the US.",1329091200,15,1104,4.482587064676617
4912745,4,B0060KGSIC,"I still have the original Hong Kong all region, 2 disc special edition of this film originally titled ""The Twins Effect II"". I never thought it would see the light of day in the United States. The film came out in 2004. It is not a sequel at all to the action packed ""The Twins Effect""; which was butchered when it was released here as ""The Vampire Effect"". They (not Well Go USA by the way) changed the opening, changed the music, and cut a lot of the film out; ridiculous. Hopefully, Well Go USA leaves this film intact and doesn't butcher it. The Hong Kong dvd looks great upconverted to 1080p so I expect the blu-ray to look incredible. There is a nice fight scene with Donnie Yen fighting Jackie Chan in a temple. The gorgeous Twins are always fun to watch. They have some decent fighting scenes too. Daniel Wu is in the film as well. This is a day one purchase for me. If you enjoy quirky, fun and exciting Hong Kong action films with big Hong Kong stars then definitely purchase this blu-ray. Jackie Chan's son Jaycee Chan is in this film before his tremendous work in the film ""Invisible Target"" with Nicholas Tse, Wu Jing and Shawn Yue. Jaycee does a good job in this film too. I still watch this film today and will enjoy the blu-ray as well. Thank you Well Go USA.

4912764,4,B0060KGSIC,"Geez...all the stupid 1 star reviews are ridiculous and absurd. I agree this is not the best of action films and I don't think it was meant to be, but it was still enjoyable, watchable & funny. When it's a film with the Twins in it, you know not to take it serious but can always count on a good laugh. Of course not a Twins fan would know this. I've seen bad films and I can honestly say this is not one if them. I loved it the first time watching this, of course I knew what I was getting into when I put this on. I think the action sequences were good, and a lot of funny moments to keep you laughing and interested. So don't go into this with high hopes of an all out action packed film and you'll probably enjoy this more.",1423958400,5,727,3.9523809523809526

4912768,1,B0060KGSIC,"This was painful to watch...
Never did I think I would see Jackie Chan or Donnie Yen participate in a fight scene where they would rely so much on cheesy special effects and slow motion. Skip this movie. It will make the Superman IV effects and fight scenes better by comparison.",1392681600,,279,4.490196078431373
4912769,3,B0060KGSIC,"The fight scenes are too weak, except for the fight between Donnie & Jackie.  The fights looked too choreographed. Also, the movie looked like a TV show, not like a movie.",1387238400,,171,4.516129032258065
4912770,4,B0060KGSIC,"It's hard to resist the highly imaginative visual effects, fantastic sets and costumes, the spectacular martial arts of Donny Chen and Jackie Chan, and a gorgeous but super-evil sorceresse and her equally evil henchman.

All of the characters are endearing, funny (except for the evil ones!), and played with abandon to the spirit of this film which is good clean fun, and pure fantasy. Okay so it's also silly, but it's a lot of fun. Donny Yen looks great for his age (born 1963, full hair dye job) and so does Jackie Chan who I normally can stand, but his appearance is thankfully brief and restricted to a singlw spectacular fight scene.

The men are all handsome, the women are all very beautiful, direction by the famed Patrick Leung competent, and, yes, the story-line stinks, but is made whole in this wonderful little nursery tale brought to life.",1374537600,3,855,4.77027027027027
4912771,1,B0060KGSIC,"I have to agree with several other reviewers.  I bought this movie after seeing the trailer on another DVD and it looked quite good.  However, my wife, daughter, and I could not sit through the first 10 minutes of the moview without laughing out loud due to how bad the sets, acting, special effects, and the dialog was.  Then we had to stop because it wasn't getting any better.  I wish I could get my money back for this film but that would be spending too much effort on it.",1367539200,,477,4.266666666666667

4912776,4,B0060KGSIC,This is another well made product in the kung fu genre. Chinese filmmakers have improved their product and this is a good example.

4912777,1,B0060KGSIC,To start with I LOVE Chinese/Korean/Japanese/Thai cinema.  I have more than 300 titles and I made the BIG mistake of buying Blade of Kings.  I am a huge Donnie Yen fan so I had no doubt that I would buy this Blu-Ray as soon as it came available.  BIG MISTAKE!  To begin with the two female leads were terrible.  As was Jaycee Chen.  Just don't mistake and get this film.,1340841600,,370,4.214285714285714
4912778,1,B0060KGSIC,"Within the first 10 minutes, I heard unfunny comedy, and I saw men that looked like proud doofuses and idiots, lots of bad acting, and then really atrocious special effects (especially with fighting and flying around).

Yeah, I've seen some bad low budget asian films, but this film looked like that it mighta had a decent budget, but just had bad story writers, bad directors, and a terrible special effects crew. Nothing really improved after watching about another 25 minutes so I had to remove this vomit-inducing, brain-hemorrhaging, eyesore of a film before I just get mad and accidentally break something.

I'd rather watch ""Glee.""

4912779,4,B0060KGSIC,"If you took a tale like ""The Dragonslayer"" & made it into a martial arts flick, this is what it would be. Is it high drama? No! But it is a cute story of love conquering evil, redemption winning the day, and a somewhat simple but lovely boy giving up a kingdom for a beautiful girl. So, it may not be the best film ever, but it is an amusing one, and for that, I can say it's worth seeing once.",1339718400,3,394,3.876543209876543
