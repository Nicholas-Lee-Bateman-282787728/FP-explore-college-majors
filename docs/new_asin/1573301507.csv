191887,1,1573301507,"I really liked her earlier video ""(Here is) Mariah Carey"". So I bought this DVD with huge expectation. But...(sigh) this one is simply disappointing. Mariah was changed in some ways especially in appearance, I  think. In most concerts here she seemed she tried to make them underwear  fashion shows and she danced like a third-rate stripper. I was watching  this DVD with my parents and totally embarrassed by her sultry look and  suggestive dances. She is so mean now. (Mariah, wake up and look around  yourself!) And I don't understand why the title is ""Around the  World"". Are there only four countries in the world? I don't think so.  One more BIG problem with this video is many songs including ""My  All"" and ""I'll Be There"" were edited inappropriately to make  them very short(running around just 1 to 2.5 minutes). In particular,  ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"" with Olivia Newton-John was cut so  awkwardly(even make me laugh). I really don't understand this kind of  reckless editing. Consequently, you'd better think over and check carefully  about buying this DVD.",926467200,6,1072,4.988700564971752
191888,1,1573301507,Very poor sound quality. Not worth the dollars I spent on it. I am sure there are better Mariah Carey DVDs out there. I hope I find one soon because she is my favorite performer.,1375574400,,178,4.114285714285714

191890,1,1573301507,"Mariah Carey - Around the World is not even a full-length concert, some of the songs are not completed and the intimate conversations with her friends are boring. Mariah even lip-synch's on some of the tracks and her dancing is not great. The only performance I liked was her duet with Trey Lorenz on I'll Be There. This is Mariah's worst concert DVD ever! Don't buy it because it is just segments of live performances, a disappointment.",1210982400,,437,4.688311688311688

191894,4,1573301507,"Fans of Mariah are also critical of this DVD, and I am well aware of its shortcomings. The primary concern here is that they wanted to film Mariah literally ""All Around the World"", and the results are less than spectacular. I also had a problem with the song selection and the portions of stage banter they decided to include (Mariah in Australia for example - a huge portion of dialog wasn't very interesting even if you ARE a Mariah fan).

The standout was definitely her performance of ""Fantasy"" with the ODB bit thrown in - some nice choreography here and Mariah actually dances. Its amazing to think she used to be this skinny! Also of importance is the performance with Olivia Newton John singing ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"". I'm in no way a fan of this overwrought song, but here it sounded pretty good and you can see the two genuinely like each other.

But really, you shouldn't be getting this for the concert. What you should be looking forward to is owning the rare video for ""The Roof"" (a criminally underrated track off her ""Butterfly"" album). In fact, the entire DVD is from the 1997 ""Butterfly Era"", so you have the remaining videos (""Butterfly"", ""My All"" and of course the amazing ""Breakdown"" all included here). ""The Roof"" has NEVER BEEN ISSUED on DVD before, and wasn't aired much on TV either, so this is the only way to own it. I would say, this ranks as one of the best Mariah videos ever, so get it now.

I still think the ultimate Mariah DVD is the 2007 release of her 1992 MTV Unplugged Concert, but considering the extras on this DVD, you can't quite go wrong. Highly Recommended.",1196812800,,1606,4.550173010380623
191895,5,1573301507,We did when we bought all those Mariah albums.  I think we deserve better when it comes to Mariah performances on Dvd.  I mean they still haven't released The First Vision on dvd yet I don't think they ever will.  This concert has so much bad editing.  Let her sing one song all the way through at least once.  The only reason I gave this dvd five stars is because of the exclusive music videos.  The Roof and Breakdown are classic.  Swimming with the dolphins was also very cute.,1151366400,2,480,4.325842696629214
191896,1,1573301507,"1. As a Mimi fan, this DVD show bad perfomences of her (with Olivia NJ very bad video) its obvious she has much better perfomences aruond the world.

2.the vidios are cut in the muddle

3.some vidios are changed in the middle to another performences - how can i enjoy half a show?? its wired and dissaponting to see that.

4. I saw much better performences on internet sites and I am sad to waist 13$ on a bad DVD like this one.

5. I also orderd Medison Squere Garden DVD and he was amazing! so I have a way to compere between a good DVD and a bad one.",1137369600,6,553,4.0
191897,3,1573301507,"I just finished watching this and would agree with a couple of previous reviewers.  First of all the concert portion (only 45 mins) to me was disappointing.  I've seen her in concert and that was WAY better than this presentation.  Not to dis Mariah but what was up with your hair in most of it?!? Her hair was like a cavewoman.  There is an invention and it's called a brush.  Terrible job by the stylists on that as well as some of her wardrobe choices.  I agree with the horrible editing others of stated.  Some of the audio as well is also disappointing.  I hear some odd crowd noises at times when I should be hearing Mariah.  Also this is hardly around the world, seems most of it focused on Australia, Japan, and New York.  There were too many ""fluff"" pieces that could have added up to more actually singing performances which is what I paid for.  I don't really care for her dogs, swimming with dolphins, etc.  Just sing and dance baby.  Highlights for me were Fantasy, Whenever you call, Honey, the videos of The Roof, My All, and especially one of my favorites--Breakdown saved this DVD.  I hope she releases a better DVD like a compilation of her full concerts (like 2 hrs) and videos--(I can't find that Sweetheart video which has been absent from any DVD thus far).  They need to do a presentation along the lines of Janet Jackson's concert DVDs.  I would instead of this DVD recommend another called Mariah's #1's.",1121472000,4,1429,4.5234375
191898,5,1573301507,"mariah carey's so awesome.

ok . for this people who 're so blind.

 1. she sings live OK. i was there at the concert when it happened. and i know it live NOT fake. so don't show your waste brain and told everyone else it fake.

  2. even if it called "" Around the world "" .it doesn't mean she gotta go to every country,does it. NOBODY EVER GO TO EVERY COUNTRY even YOUR GRANDMOM and GRANDPA.

191901,3,1573301507,"Mariah is great, and she's one of my favorite singers. Although I'm a 70's music fanatic, but I admire her style. The DVD shows Mariah on different concerts around the world. It could be a great selection, but the video cuts make it below average rate. The sound is good, and well divided using a dolby 5.1 system, and the picture is also good. The bonus video clips are excellent. I think her DVD #1 is a better purchase.",1030233600,3,422,4.3544303797468356

I have this DVD and everytime I watch it I never get bored. You can NEVER get bored with this fun-loving concert of Mariah's and you get to know what she's REALLY like, which is completely down-to-earth, so pay no attention to the rumours the media spreads about her because they are totally FALSE!!!!!! Amid all the fun you have when you watch this concert, you get to know what a great person Mariah is and she's not concieted or fake at all! People who hate her are just insecure and jealous of her!!!!!  Mariah Carey is the best and her Around The World concert rocks!!!!!",992304000,4,707,4.48062015503876
191904,4,1573301507,"Around The World is a somewhat messy collection of live appearances made by Mariah. Not to say the video isn't good, but it would have been nice to see a full concert, instead of performances from around the world. It would be nice to have the Rainbow Tour on VHS/DVD. Anyway, she sings a lot of her hits here, and there is also some bonus videos on the VHS, Butterfly and Breakdown, which are worth the price of this video alone. However once again DVD gets more extras, with extra videos for the two I listed, and as well My All and The Roof. Anyway this is a nice collection of live performances, but Mariah we are waiting for one of your tours to be released on video!",990316800,,672,4.2578125
191905,5,1573301507,"This dvd is awesome. It has footage from Mariah's concerts from all over the globe (even Australia) where I am from.

With all of her biggest hits, 4 extra video clips, a discography, biography, instant chapter access, 3 languages(english, french and spanish), interactive menus, dolby stereo, dolby digital 5.1 surround sound and digitally mastered. You will really enjoy such songs as ""Whenever you call"", ""I still believe"", ""I'll be there"" and ""Hopelessly devoted to you (with Olivia Newton-John)"". Australian fans will no doubt cherish this dvd as it has footage of the only Mariah visit ever made down under!

If you are think  about buying this DVD, please think no more because this is one DVD you can  not miss out on. I promise you will love this DVD if your a Mariah Carey  Fan, it is just so cool. Plus you get about four extra videos on the DVD  which are: Break Down, Butterfly, My All and The Roof. So what are you  waiting for, go buy it.

191915,2,1573301507,"I saw this video on VH1 and I Thouht:""This should be the tv version"", 'cause it was too short and the songs and footage were uglily edited. Then I bought it and what was my surprise?: The same  version. I love Mariah a lot and I admire her for her voice singing live,  that's why I don't understand why she doesn't sings Fantasy and Honey live.  One of my fave songs is Whenever you call and the editor(Sanaa Hamri)  practically killed it by pieces and put all the chattering of the people  from 'around the world' in it, the same with Hopelessly devoted to you, my  all and I'll be there. I think mariah looks very good with most of  hairstyles, but with that kind of Afro she seems to be 4 a.m. and awaked by  surprise. I think the only one guilty here is the editor and the only song  saved from him is ""I still believe"" the rest is all damaged. And  one last thing:Why only two bonus videos on vhs? Do we -vhs users- smell  bad? Why dvd comes with 4? That's not fair.",946252800,9,971,4.13903743315508
