I found the film had more the feel of an A flick in terms of the way it was shot and I never found myself saying geez, I wish they had more money budgeted to pull this or that off. It wasn`t a problem. It had a slick feel to it and it had to be dark in spots as the
whole story is a forbidden after dark tale. Out of the shadows at the latest of hours the kinky clientele march forward repeating their nightly ritual.  Fledgling reporter Monique Parent gets sucked into this dark world at first in search of a story. A chance for her to become the next big thing, maybe. But it gets complicated. The evil millionaire who she is undercover ( essentially) to ruin and expose is really a pretty good guy. Now in love with the target who besides legitimate ventures runs this underground club she realizes she must betray either her lover or her bosses. Julie Strain wears a number of hats in this one. She is Monique`s guide to the world of S& M initially. Later Julie fills in as a guest Dom ( sort of) when the scene needs to get to another level. Finally she introduces Monique Parent to some intense girl on girl love ( in a very long scene). The movie  has a very dark feel to it and it might put some off. Aside from Monique modelling outfits for Justin and the joking that ensues this movie is a very serious film. Most B Movies are readily available for convenient put downs but Dark Secrets is pretty good. If you are there for the kink it really delivers. If you want a story we have that as well. Not a lot of big name stars, doesn`t need it. Once you get used to the reality presented here I think you will like it, worth 4 stars.",1380499200,,1785,4.053824362606233

It is a slow drawn out nothing movie with little to offer. I am glad I got rid of it.",1353715200,,194,3.731707317073171
7869020,2,630437531X,"I have no real clue what this movie is about, but Julie Strain & Monique Parent in the rain *almost* make up for it.",1013040000,3,116,3.875
7869021,1,630437531X,"the graphic is blurry and fuzzy. The plot is extremely stupid and hard to understand what's going on and don't know what's the point of the movie. Little actions, and the music is terrible. The good lesbian theme at the end(last less than 2 minutes) is captured in a dark rainy day and the graphic is really horrible, unable to show the details. I won't recommend to anyone, i bought it and watched it, and has to fastfoward several parts. After i viewed it i have the intention to throw it away!",985651200,3,496,4.4021739130434785
