Difference is, Live In 99 is the full show; this is edited down to maybe half of that release AND they resequenced the songs to where they are completely out of order from the way there were performed. Example: George doesn't open with Bad To The Bone on Live In 99 but does here. It looks stupid here because he is already sweaty whereas on Live In 99, he opens with Be Bop Grandma and is dry as a bone. Be Bop Grandma appears about halfway through this release, so for him to start out soaking wet and be dry halfway through the show, it's just so inconsistent as to be stupid. The performance is great, but skip this and get the real deal for maximum enjoyment.",1206057600,20,808,4.219354838709678
