7921499,2,B00004RYAW,"Two terminal cancer patients (Til Schweiger and Jan Josef Liefers) in a stolen car with stolen money embark on a crime spree while on their way to see the ocean before they die.

Lets see, Pulp Fiction came out in 1994 and this German film was released three years latersounds about right.  Tarantino is merely the most obvious reference in this movie, which is no doubt meant as an homage to the kind of nerdy, pop culture-conscious American crime aesthetic that he inspired, but instead merely invites unfavorable comparison with a  number of superior films.  For writer / director Thomas Jahn, cool always seems to trump logical or plausible, but cool for the sake of cool is never cool, so his movie is not very cool.  Nevertheless, it was the highest grossing film in Germany the year it was released.  Germans are not cool.",1486944000,,829,4.722222222222222
7921500,3,B00004RYAW,Has a few ironic twists - a bit dated and the attempt to make Til Schweiger's character sympathetic doesn't quite hit home.,1456531200,,123,4.636363636363637

7921502,5,B00004RYAW,"It comes with subtitles, I can only attest to the English ones, I haven't checked for others.  The packaging was brand new, and for the price, it must have been.  A great purchase.",1363132800,,180,4.424242424242424
7921503,1,B00004RYAW,"I love this movie and was really exited when I found it on Amason. Unfortunatelly, when it came, I found out there are NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES! So, unless you are fluent in German, don't get it!",1327190400,6,191,4.333333333333333
7921504,5,B00004RYAW,"Star of many German movies, Til Schweiger appears in Knockin' on Heaven's Door as Martin Brest who is diagnosed with a brain tumour and given very little time to live. In hospital Martin meets Rudi Wurlitzer (Jan Josef Liefers). Together they embark on an escapade with a stolen Mercedes containing a million marks (old 1997 money) and being chased by the policew and two thugs.
The movie is fun to watch, seeing Martin and Rudi get in and out of their close calls and seeing the thugs and police stumbling behind.
There are various extras on the DVD in German along with commentaries in German. The movie itself has optional German audio or dubbed English. Subtitles are available in both languages.
The movie is a decent way to pass an hour and a half on a windy winter afternoon. (86 minutes).
Enjoy.",1327190400,2,803,4.661971830985915
7921505,5,B00004RYAW,"I've watched this movie for many times since 1997. It is really an eye opener for me and for many other people whom I know, who watched it. If you've seen the Bucket list and liked it, you'd fall in love with this one. A lot of fun, and a lot of things to think about. I don't know why this movie hasn't been considered to get into top-100-best-movies-ever list.",1295654400,6,362,4.185714285714286
7921506,5,B00004RYAW,"I first saw the movie in Munich, then found a copy dubbed in English with Polish subtitles.  Two terminally ill men, one with only days to live, meet in a hospital.  They want to see the ocean before they die, so they steal a car from the hospital parking lot.  The car belongs to gansters, and has a million dollars in the trunk.  The plot involves the gangsters tracking the two down as they drive toward the sea. The story is both funny and tragic, with a three-tissue ending.  This movie really should be issued in Region 1 format with subtitles.",1247875200,,550,4.405940594059406
7921507,5,B00004RYAW,"It is a great movie, but it does not have English audio or subtitles. Til Schweiger and Jan Josef Liefers performances are wonderful and the story is touching.",1196294400,3,159,4.714285714285714
7921508,5,B00004RYAW,"A little bit like ""Lock, stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" with less people involved in the story. Great movie if you can watch it. The German only made it a bit difficult for me!

Once the major downfall I found with the film was the lack of subtitles on the copy that I had purchased. This time I gave it a 5 star so people might actually look at it, one. Two, because the film itself was a 5, and this region 2 version may have the one thing I had missing.

*I do not own the DVD listed here on amazon, but this is the only copy I have ever seen with English language listed on it.",1192752000,4,582,3.9237288135593222
