8646068,1,B00IXO6VNA,"...this DVD was promoted as being the full network broadcast but it's not which is hugely disappointing. If you're a Dale Earnhardt, Jr. fan this DVD is a must own.",1416182400,3,164,4.5
8646069,5,B00IXO6VNA,Great job at reproduction of an outstanding moment in racing.  Good selection of what was presented.  No problems with viewing.,1403654400,,127,5.3
8646070,3,B00IXO6VNA,Just want to make everyone aware that purchases this DVD that it is not the complete race.  It skips a major portion of the middle of the race after the rain delay and picks back up about Lap 138 to the end.,1399507200,7,207,3.9285714285714284
8646071,5,B00IXO6VNA,"I adore this DVD!  This race was a great one, and having it captured on DVD is fantastic.  I have not owned it for very long, but have watched it and relived all the emotions all over again numerous times.  A Great addition to any DaleJr. Fan collection.",1399507200,,254,4.25
