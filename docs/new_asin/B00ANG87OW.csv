8554672,5,B00ANG87OW,"Combat Hapkido is the perfect system, if you don't want to concern yourself with high flying kicks and gimmicky ""street"" self-defense series. This is a professional curriculum put together in a logical manner by a man who has over 40 years of direct experience practicing and teaching these techniques. I have been to a couple of they seminars he offers which are great supplements to his video DVDs, I suggest you visit their website and learn more! I am very sold on the Combat Hapkido system!",1370563200,3,495,4.767441860465116
