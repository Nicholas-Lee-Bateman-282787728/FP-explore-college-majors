8410514,4,B003ZK3U90,The topic of adult CODAs is a tough one for some. This movie was the first time I was welcomed into the world of children of deaf adults in an honest and open insightful way. The rawness of this topic is penetrating and I am thankful for the opportunity to try to understand the life of a CODA from their own perspective.,1473033600,,321,4.193548387096774
