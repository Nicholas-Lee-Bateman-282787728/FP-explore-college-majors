The author gives a good overview of Sony Vegas, and as a beginner learning this complex editing program, I did pick up some useful techniques. Ms. Schlumpf knows her way around the Vegas interface and shows the viewer how to use most of the nuts & bolts features, along with some more advanced applications.

The most significant problem with the disc set is that the lessons are not broken down into user-selectable chapters. In other words, each of the two discs is recorded as one long chapter and I found myself needing to write down time references to find sections that I wanted to watch again. It would have been nice to have each tutorial independently accessible from the menu, or at least have a printed guide with the start times of each chapter listed.

Another nitpick is something that I've often seen in these types of tutorials and it bothers me every time: the presenter simply being unprepared. By this I mean that the presenter wastes time by hunting through files on her computer screen to locate what she wants to show the viewer. I'm willing to put up with that in a free online tutorial, but when paying money for instructional material, I expect a bit more preparation on the part of the author.

Had it not been for these two complaints, I would have given the set five stars. I would still recommend it; just be patient while she searches and keep a pencil handy when viewing...",1265155200,4,1635,4.6116838487972505
