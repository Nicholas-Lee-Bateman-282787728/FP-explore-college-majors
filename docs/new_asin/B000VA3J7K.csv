2934173,5,B000VA3J7K,"We are only on the 4th. of the 14 discs in this collection just thrilled we are able to view so many episodes that are not available in the U.S. video collections. We purchased Dad's army as a collection several years ago and just loved the humor. The cast members work so well together, just classic comedy at its best. We had no idea we were missing so many episodes until I came across this box set on Amazon UK. We had purchased a region free player online recently in order to view our favorite British programs not available in the U.S.. What we did not know was how so many of the episodes were missing from ""our"" version. We have enjoyed so much the antics of these War time heros just glad to see all we have missed.",1347840000,16,725,4.223021582733813

2934183,5,B000VA3J7K,"I purchased this set because I read it was one of top ten TV shows ever made.  And I have to say that just love it.  Quite often I find myself laughing out loud.  The series was filmed in the late 60s early 70s and the first two seasons were in black and white, which did not bother me.  The series takes place during WWII when the British Government asked all available to join the Home Guard.  A sort of first line of defense should the Germans ever make a land attack in England.  As all the younger men were serving in the Armed Forces the Home Guard was made up of mostly older men well past their prime but still endowed with great pride and resolve always giving their 100%.  It may take a couple of episodes to get use to the strong English accent some of the characters but it is well worth it.  I can clearly see why this show was voted as one of the top ten ever made in England.  They say that the reruns are still being shown today that is how good it is.  The writing, the actors and the sets all come together to make a timeless classic war time comedy about England during WWII.",1451260800,3,1094,4.093896713615023

2934186,5,B000VA3J7K,"Watched some episodes in the late 70's on PBS and am delighted to now have the whole series.  Disk 1 had 1 spot where it froze and I have contacted Amazon for a replacement.  The series is a delight and brings back many memories of similar characters in my service days.  You will need a player that plays PAL dvd's or blu-rays to watch this, it is not available in an NTSC version to my knowledge.  The occasional old ditties that accompany the presentation are priceless and I particularly enjoyed the special features that accompanied so many of the discs which described the characters and their personalities.  Presently I am viewing these with a very sharp 93 year old vet who was stationed in England at times though he was at the D-Day invasion and the Battle of the Bulge and he is also enjoying these.  One other nice feature is that you can show the captions which closely follow the spoken word but not precisely.  This feature would not only help those who are a bit hard of hearing but also for those of us who may miss a particular phrase due to the slight differences between British and American speech.",1433548800,5,1120,4.514851485148514
2934187,5,B000VA3J7K,"This is an immensely funny British sitcom. I went so far as to buy a region-free dvd player just so I could watch it. Can't wait for the remake to come out. I'd write more, but the other reviews pretty much say it all.",1427068800,2,218,3.977272727272727
2934188,5,B000VA3J7K,I bought this for my wife and she is thoroughly enjoying it. She had seen many of the shows on PBS but there are many which she had never seen before.,1425168000,,150,3.870967741935484
2934189,5,B000VA3J7K,"I originally bought the selected series version of Dad's Army. It was region 1 so I didn't need a region free DVD player. It didn't get a lot of good reviews but I decided to buy it anyway on a whim. I fell in love with these patriotic puffs who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag soaked in water. The harder the men try to worse they get. Sometimes it's out load laughter. Of course you have one of U.K.'s premier writers, David Croft, at the helm of the series. When I learned about Dad's Army having a complete collection of many episodes I had to have it. I could have gotten a cheap region free DVD player but I learned long ago that a Blu-Ray DVD player enhances regular DVD's  so much that there was no question the direction I was going. I shelled out a couple hundred for a Sony region free DVD player plus the cost of the Dad's Army complete series. What fun.
I don't want to mislead the picture perfect crowd. The picture quality isn't great. Even though the series started in 1968 many of the first episodes are in black and white. The very first episode starts out with a poor quality picture but then it improves to very good. So far the series shows a very good picture quality. A wonderful feature is it has English subtitles. This is very helpful when trying to understand the Queens English. Basically the series is about the British home guard during world war II. A group of senior men formed into a fighting unit( joke) to protect the homeland while the regular army deals with Adolf. If you like, Are You Being Served, Allo! ,Allo! and other Dave Croft funnies you'll like Dad's Army. The inconvenience is that it is region 2.",1424822400,5,1657,4.3624595469255665
2934190,5,B000VA3J7K,"The old boys have still got it! The petty pomposity of the lower-bourgeois Mannering, the untroubled comfort of the aristocratic Wilson, the solid but dithering Jones, the thumb-sucking Pike and the mean and malicious Fraser...all classic comic characters that bump into each other and keep this classic comedy alive as the years pass.",1420329600,,335,5.339622641509434

2934192,5,B000VA3J7K,"Dad's Army is fantastic. Captain Mainwaring would have had the twits at the BBC, who decided they didn't want to do business with the rest of the world and made these DVDs Region 2, taken out and shot. Hodges would have done even worse... perhaps forced them to live out the term of their natural life as vegetarians. Luckily, even the poor business decisions of those giving orders at the BBC, ""fools"" as Frasier would call them, can be easily circumvented by those who do not panic. I'm delighted to have these DVD treasures and to put them to good use. Dad's Army really does remind us that there always will be an England, I'm not sure it gives us much confidence in those giving orders at the top though.",1419811200,4,709,4.461538461538462

It took us a month to watch the whole series (watching 2 to  3 episodes a night) and we enjoyed it immensely.  You get a real feeling of what it was like ""back in the day"" when England was being bombed and there was a Gerry around every bush.  Lighthearted fun, but you still get a sense of what it must have been like during the War.  I recommend this wholeheartedly for the whole family!!!!!",1391385600,3,467,4.202247191011236

2934200,5,B000VA3J7K,"Here we are more than 45 years on from when this series was first broadcast on BBC television in  the UK.. Series after series was made, and each one unique and funnier than the last. Stupendous wit, timing, and hilarious antics. Only the British can laugh at themselves, match a poignancy with the humour, and make a dangerous time very watchable, and funny. I grew up watching all the series, and seeing them again in this wonderful almost complete collection, brings back so very many memories. They do not date....because they were so rich and magical. Actors, talented and well remembered, most are all gone, but the memory of  them and a polished comedy series will continue to live on....and the proof of its success, brilliant writing and superb delivery, is that many lines are still quoted and used in everyday speak in Britain.  ""they don't like it up 'em ""!  Bravo Amazon for making this compilation available in the US.",1381449600,3,932,4.770186335403727
2934201,5,B000VA3J7K,"Nice casing and contains all extant episodes (All but 3 episodes of season 2 were lost.)  A situational comedy about those men too old or classified as unfit for British service in WWII.  When German invasion threatened, they formed the Home Guard, which was tasked with local watch and defense, as well as low priorties the regular military was too busy to deal with; prison camps, downed pilots, local patrols...etc.  The series treats the war with more respect than some series do, focusing the humor on the aspirations and characters involved in the platoon.

Arthur Lowe does an outsanding job as the pompus, old fashioned Captain, who underneath really cares about his men and his country.  His sargent is a public school gentleman and his corporal is an ancient veteran from the late 19th century British campaigns in North Africa.  The comedy includes it's fair share of visual humor occasionally boardering on slap-stick.  But the mainstay of the content comes from watching how these odd characters interact as they try to implement their various missions.

This series translates well from Britian to the U.S, in part due to America's familiarity with WWII, and in part because the writer's realized the younger British audience of the 1970's might not be familiar with all the slang of the period and took care that visuals and reactions helped clarify what was meant.  Besides, character comedy always translates well.",1373932800,11,1431,5.05531914893617
2934202,5,B000VA3J7K,"The series was made by the BBC over a time span of several years. Many of the early films and tapes were lost or wiped after being reduced to black and white film. Now the collection has been put together to give us a collection of as much as possible of the several series, and even to regenerate colour from the black and white copies of the tapes that were wiped to film.
This a magnificent collection that does reflect the title 'The Complete Collection'.

The company in the UK who sell this gave excellent service and delivered the 14  DVD collection in a week from order.

The collection is a triumph and a tribute to those Home Guards.",1370044800,7,643,4.38655462184874

8217618,5,B000VA3J7K,"One of the most beloved sitcoms ever made, practically an institution in the UK, is sadly unknown here in America. Why it never aired across the pond is a mystery, because DAD'S ARMY is a hoot from beginning to end! The first season premiered in 1968, 50 years ago as of this writing. It hasn't dated one whit, however, due to both the excellence of the original scripts (by Jimmy Perry and David Croft) and the fact that it was a WWII period piece from the git-go. (Americans can think of it as a cross between HOGAN'S HEROES and The GOLDEN GIRLS, but much better than either of them.) I began watching at first almost by accident, then compulsively. Soon I was hooked; it went from completely obscure to one of my favorite television comedies of all time in a matter of weeks.

The humor is broad and character-based. The characters are appealing and vividly defined: Mainwaring, Wilson, Jonesy, Frazer, Godfrey, Walker, Pike, Mrs. Pike, Hodges, the Vicar, the Verger, etc. I know all their marvelous catchphrases by now (at least half a dozen of them), and am familiar with all their goofy idiosyncrasies. The brilliant ensemble cast, so iconic in Great Britain, began as strangers to me and now they're like old friends: Arthur Lowe, Clive Dunn, James Beck, John Le Mesurier, John Laurie, Ian Lavender and Arnold Ridley, among others. Though I'm a latecomer to DAD'S ARMY, ""better late than never"" I always say! I had to purchase a region-free dvd player to view this series, but it was worth it. As the Brits used to say, good show! A very good show, indeed.",1518048000,3,1563,4.663043478260869
