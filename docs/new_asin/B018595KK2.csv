7539558,3,B018595KK2,"First of all, I was surprised that this dvd used a Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtrack.  Kind of antiquated.  The storyline was good, but there were too many gaps and things left unexplained.  I am not sorry I watched it, but I may donate it to the library.  I was disappointed because it could have been such a good movie.",1487808000,,316,4.305084745762712

7539573,5,B018595KK2,"I found this to be a delightful Christmas movie.  I love Haylie Duff movies.  She just has this real genuine quality to her no matter what role she is playing. I read some of the reviews and saw that people had problems viewing this DVD, and I experienced none.  I would order a Prime DVD again. I did use the DVD drive on my computer to watch.",1480118400,5,344,4.104477611940299

7539575,5,B018595KK2,"In the small town of Wilsonville is a cozy haberdashery - let's get specific, a hat store - called Hats Off to Christmas wherein the cordial staff answer the phone like this: ""It's always Christmas at Hats Off to Christmas."" I think that's kind of cool. For ten years Mia Winters (Haylie Duff) has worked for its proprietor Michael (Jay Brazeau), and she's pretty much taken over the day-to-day operation of the place. Mia thinks she's about to be promoted to an upper-management position. You can picture her chagrin when she learns that her boss is actually giving the job to his son Nick Bowers (Antonio Cupo). It stings even more when Nick, a fancy pants business consultant from New York, lets slip that he doesn't even want to be there, that he much prefers his jet-set big city life. But the family business is floundering, what with the recession and the increased competition. Michael thinks his business-savvy son can turn things around.

Sucks for Mia that she's tasked with training Nick for the job she'd so badly coveted. Antonio Cupo plays Nick much the same way as he did his part in Love at the Thanksgiving Day Parade. That is, a sleek executive who initially comes off as haughty but has hidden potential. But it's a given that there's turbulence ahead in Mia and Nick's interactions.

Mia is a single mom to Scotty (Sean Michael Kyer), a wheelchair-bound 9-year-old with a spinal injury incurred from an accident 18 months ago, the same accident that killed his dad. Mia is very protective of Scotty, so imagine her paranoia when her new ""employee boss"" takes a liking to him, even offers to help him with the pumpkin carving contest and the soap box derby. Mia doesn't want Scotty to get too attached to Nick because she has doubts about Nick's dependability and, also, wasn't Nick adamant that he wasn't staying in Wilsonville? Well, it's a Hallmark Christmas movie. Everything will probably work out.

Hats Off to Christmas is a few years old now, enough time for Hallmark to put it on steady rotation come the holiday season. And it's become a yearly viewing tradition in my household. I'm sure I'd seen Haylie Duff in other movies before, and probably on Hallmark, at that. But it's this movie that I associate her with the most. I'm not even sure why. It's a typical Hallmark picture; you see everything coming. The script doesn't call on her to do anything special or unique. I guess it's that she's so naturally likable. Haylie Duff is a sweetheart. As far as Hallmark's stable of leading ladies goes, I put her up there with Autumn Reeser (my favorite!), Danica McKellar, Candace Cameron Bure, and Lacey Chabert (I'm undoubtedly leaving out some names). But Duff is the engine of this movie, and we're with her each step of the way. As for her leading man, while I haven't seen Antonio Cupo in a lot of movies, I like him fine. Maybe it's because despite the GQ outfits and the slick hair and the snooty metropolitan attitude, he does have a sense of humor about him. There's a cute running gag that may go under the radar but it gave me some chuckles and it involves Nick forced to wear an assortment of goofy Christmas hats while working in the store (gotta promote the stock, right?). Cupo and Duff make it work A cozy hat emporium like Hats Off is right up my alley; I love little shops brimming with that personal touch and that small town feel. And if it's staffed with people like Mia, then all the better. Listen, I wouldn't sweat Mia's bad situation. To repeat, it's a Hallmark movie, so you can bet it ends well and that you're in for some chuckles and unsubtle heart-tugging moments. Maybe that guy Nick becomes more human, maybe he has his eyes opened regarding the awesomeness of living in a small town. As for Mia, maybe, with Nick's help, she can whip Hats Off to Christmas back into shape. Mia and Nick, haberdashing away.",1479859200,2,3867,4.634110787172012

7539582,1,B018595KK2,I bought this expecting it to be the Hallmark movie.  I now realize the movie I recieved is a bootleg item.  It makes no mention of Hallmark on the DVD and it is from a company in Australia.  After further research I realized that Hallmark never released it to DVD.  Very upset that I am out $20 and the quality is so poor.  It's very fuzzy when it plays.,1477958400,,355,4.086956521739131
