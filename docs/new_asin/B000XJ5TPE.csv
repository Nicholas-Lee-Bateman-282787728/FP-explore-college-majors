3002745,5,B000XJ5TPE,"I thought this movie was a wonderful introduction to the Apollo moon landings, really showing the human side of the experience and providing a wonderful general overview of the achievements. I saw it on the movie screen and highly recommend it.

I also really liked the book of the same title, by C. Burgess and F. French, that not only covers the early Apollo flights, but also delves into the preceding flights, and what the Soviets were up to at that time. In the book, I learned about the early lives and early flights of these astronauts, and what it was like to be in the moment of flying the missions. In the movie, I learned what these guys look like today, and how they feel reflecting back on their experiences. Both movie and book were perfect for their medium, and great accompaniments to each other.

Highly recommend both book and movie, and suggest experiencing both!!!!!",1194912000,49,886,4.673076923076923
3002746,5,B000XJ5TPE,"The truth is, everyone should have seen this in a theater on a LARGE screen (IMAX would have been ideal). This film is so breathtaking and beautiful, replete with never-before-seen footage that will mesmerize you. I saw this with an audience that was cheering at the end!! It's that great, and will very likely be a staple of classrooms everywhere - the filmmaking is first-rate and is probably the best work of its kind. The historical value of this project can't be overestimated since most of those who walked on the Moon speak warmly in interviews (looking into the camera) of what it was like. Don't think twice: buy this - it is absolutely essential viewing.",1194825600,25,664,4.732758620689655
3002747,5,B000XJ5TPE,"During his State of the Union address in 1961 President John F. Kennedy challenged the nation, ""before this decade is out, to land a man on the Moon and return him safely to the Earth."" Despite all the turbulence of the 1960s (Vietnam, three assassinations, the civil rights movement, etc.), on July 20, 1969 Neil Armstrong stepped off his lunar module ladder and onto the moon --240,000 miles away--with the unforgettable words, ""that's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."" This remarkable documentary covers much but not all of the Apollo program, which ran from 1961 to 1975 and in six missions landed twelve people on the moon (the last in 1972 with Apollo 17). It focuses especially on the first lunar landing with Apollo 11, and the catastrophe of Apollo 1 and near-catastrophe of Apollo 13. In addition to the sheer magnitude of the scientific and technical feat, the film captures the deeply human drama, the truly global celebration, and even the spiritual impact that the lunar landings had on the astronauts. The film draws heavily upon NASA archival film footage, much of which has never been seen before, and reflections by all of the surviving astronauts, save the reclusive Neil Armstrong. This might be the best documentary film of 2007.",1190592000,14,1269,4.906976744186046
3002748,5,B000XJ5TPE,"""In the Shadow of the Moon"" is a documentary created by Ron Howard's Imagine Pictures, the group that made ""Apollo 13"". It combines documentary footage and on-camera interviews with most of the surviving Apollo astronauts, to tell the story of Apollo, and to give the astronauts a forum for reflecting on the experience of having been to the Moon.

The film is superbly put together, as you would expect. The archival footage is lovingly remastered, but the filmmakers resisted the temptation to tart it up: the scratches and, in one case, a clump of dust on the projector, are there for all to see. Most of the footage is familiar, but some I'd never seen before

Most of the surviving Apollo astronauts appear in the film; I missed only Fred Haise and Neil Armstrong. The astronauts' personalities come across very strongly - from taciturn John Young, to jolly Al Bean, to the introspective yet cocky Eugene Cernan. All of them have interesting things to say.

If you're not familiar with the Apollo program, or if you're a young woman or young man and all that Apollo stuff is something that your parents or grandparents natter about, you owe it to yourself to see ""In the Shadow of the Moon"". Project Apollo was something unique in all of human history, a very special moment in the life of our nation and of our species. NASA did a very difficult thing, and did it superbly well; but even more important, those 12 men who stood on another world and looked back on our Earth, have things to say that are interesting and enlightening and important.

If you're a fan of the Apollo program, ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" won't present much that is new. You've probably seen most of the archival footage already, and heard the astronauts say very similar things at one time or another. But Imagine has told that familiar story very well. And most importantly, the in-depth interviews with the astronauts give us an historical record of their thoughts as they approach the end of their lives. All of those men are in their 70s or 80s. Soon, they won't be with us any more. Their achievement will reside in the history books, distant, something experienced by someone else long ago. But thanks to films like this, those men will still be able to tell us and future generations what it was like and what it meant.

Some day, a man or woman - perhaps someone not yet born - will stand again at Tranquility Base. And when that happens, it will be thanks in large measure to artists like Ron Howard, who will have helped to keep the dream alive.

In summary: I liked the movie. Go see it. It's a good movie.",1189728000,11,2599,4.5665236051502145
3002749,5,B000XJ5TPE,"I saw a preview of the movie at a NASA facility.  It was great!  Unlike many of the ""talking head"" documentaries that populate the space science genre, this film captures the sense of adventure, the wonder, the excitement of the Apollo mission series.  There is plenty of humor, too, and lots of never-before-seen footage.  Being old enough to remember those days, all of the emotions and excitement came rushing back to me.  If you've ever wanted to share with your friends and family what those days were like, this documentary will do it.  I intend to buy this DVD as soon as it is available!",1189036800,9,595,4.619047619047619
3002750,5,B000XJ5TPE,"This was the official opening film at the spectacular True/False Film Festival in Columbia, Missouri in March of 2007.  I decided I would give the film a shot, though space documentaries had never been a favorite of mine.  This amazing piece of historic documentation proceeded to blow all of my preconceived notions into pieces.  Not just in a filmic sense does this work break the mold, but in its ability to utterly recreate the American, and yes worldwide, pride that humanity possessed when the moonlanding occurred.  My heart was bursting and my eyes welled with happiness as I experienced the closest thing I had felt to patriotism in a very long time.  It was not strictly a red-white-blue patriotism, though it was certainly there, but rather a joy of being human.  It reminds us all of the hope we once had and lost.  It tells us to repossess that capacity for hope from the cynicism, the chaos, and the shattered illusions around us, and once more, reach for the stars.",1186790400,5,980,4.729411764705882
3002751,5,B000XJ5TPE,"I was fortunate to be invited to preview this film in April of 2007 while attending the International Space Symposium in Colorado Springs.  Buzz Aldrin, at age 77, flew in to introduce the film to an audience of space professionals involved with planning our manned mission to Mars.  Buzz is full of energy, sharp, creative, and humorous and still an avid champion of space exploration.  He is a true national treasure.
The film was remarkable!  It was full of personal and never before told stories shared by our first moonwalkers talking directly to the camera with no scripted questions...just personal moments of their unique experience in Space.  The film was entertaining, full of high quality film clips recorded years ago as historical documentation of astounding achievement.  The editing of this natural and unscripted story telling by each of our most memorable astronauts flowed so precisely that I forgot it was a documentary.  The high quality theatrical sound of firing red hot rocket thrusters and the sounds of fearful and critical life or death minutes at Mission Control had the audience gasping with relief when the exact moment of success and salvation for these dangerous missions were achieved.
I cannot say enough to convey the experience of this film.  We all left the theater realizing that the moon landings were the greatest achievements of the American spirit in the Twentieth Century.
I was 19 years young when I first felt the pride of our first moon landing.  I arrived home on leave from Marine Corps boot camp, at the peak of the Vietnam War, just an hour before Neil Armstrong stepped out of the Lunar Landing Module.  I have a photo of myself standing next to our television and still dressed in my uniform as I did not want to change clothes and miss a moment of that moon landing.  The live image of the moon landing can be seen clearly on the TV screen captured in my photo.  Unfortunately I will be 77 years old, at the earliest possible date, to feel that kind of national pride again....when we put our first team on the surface of Mars.  Our nation needs strong national leadership to make the first manned mission to Mars a reality...this film reminds us of all these things.",1185408000,30,2219,4.792650918635171

There's a sensation of getting a 'behind the scenes' view of the space project with insight unavailable available elsewhere. Hearing he astronauts own stories is so powerful.

I was a teenager when it began and was fortunate to watch it on TV when our astronauts landed.  It was only TV then, no internet, no cable news.  You got what the media reported.  The astronauts voice exchange was cool and scientific.  Things took place that weren't always broadcast word for word,and here you get a collage of what these men were thinking, and what they feel now.  It makes you wonder how this technology of 50 years ago ever could put a man on the moon, which has yet to be duplicated by any other country.",1460851200,,609,4.392857142857143

3002880,5,B000XJ5TPE,"I was inspired to post this review after watching the Blu-ray version of In the Shadow of the Moon.

On top of mesmerizing interviews that pack deep emotion, spectacular footage, and my tear-filled emotions reliving my awe and wonder at watching the Apollo 11 landing as a kid, this film provided a special gift that gives me goosebumps to think about.

Starting frame 1:11:49 there is a fast moving dust storm on the Moon's surface! It occurs immediately after Buzz Aldrin makes the following statement:

""Here we were, on the surface, and I knew this is what people were watching. More people were watching us than had ever watched two humans being before in history, and yet we're further away! Not just in distance, but in things we've got to do to get back home. We've got to do some difficult things to get out of this desolate place, and get back home again."" (Buzz Aldrin)

I'm providing this quote, because if my time of 1:11:49 is slightly different from your Blu-ray player (or perhaps different because you have a DVD player; I really don't know if the time is from the disc itself or a result of the Blu-ray software), you can locate the footage. The dust storm happens in the five seconds immediately following the above quote by Buzz Aldrin.

This dust storm is brief, just five seconds, but wow, it is FAST MOVING. I'm still frantically Googling lunar atmosphere and dust storms to try and make sense of what is shown in this original footage! It appears from my investigation it MIGHT be the result of charged dust. Moon conspiracy theorists, sorry to disappoint you, but this fast and rolling dust movement looks like a very scientific phenomenon that could NOT have been produced in a 1969 studio! This is definitely a real phenomenon, perhaps of charged dust particles perhaps interacting with gasses and solar radiation, or some other atmospheric disturbance. (Yes, the Moon does have a thin atmosphere.)

The Earth is at the top center of the frame, the American flag is at the bottom. To the upper left, a cloud of what looks like that fine lunar dust (that is almost like talcum powder) swirls quickly in a tumbling manner, until disappearing into the left of the frame. This happens over the course of five seconds, so you better have good rewind and freeze frame capabilities.

I'm watching it again, and just noticed starting at frame 1:11:59 through frame 1:12:02 (three seconds), as the camera is panning left, in almost the center of the frame, there is more dust movement that emerges quickly like a swirling vertical ""dust devil"" (like you see in the desert). Like the other dust movement, it has a ""white smoke"" effect, likely due to the fine powder on the lunar surface. I'm getting a sense that maybe there is more atmospheric activity on the lunar surface than meets the eye. Fascinating. I'll have to watch the entire video again more closely!

This was a major bonus for me, because it helps me understand the dynamics of the Moon's surface.

I highly recommend this video as awesome even without the dust storm, but for me, spectacular because that footage captured a phenomenon that, five seconds one way or another, would have been completely missed. I will see this video again, and if I catch anything else, I will update this review accordingly.

Updates:

The reason I ordinarily don't like Blu-ray is because (a) I cannot bookmark my place; and (b) when I stop it, there is no memory of where I left off, but on starting it again, I must remember where I left off (and fast forward to the place, or select the closest scene). This has been a major hassle. I always suspected the expertise of the Blu-ray disc creator determines if these basic bookmark and save features are activated by default (whereas with DVD, apparently the software used to generate the DVD by the manufacturer activates these features by default).

The good news is someone knew exactly what they were doing in mastering this Blu-ray disc, so that the bookmark and save where you left off features are activated by default! I absent-mindedly stopped the Blu-ray disc and removed it. Later when I popped it in, the disc immediately started where I left off. Then I realized ""isn't this a Blu-ray?"" and had to double-check the packaging. Then I noticed that I could create bookmarks, a feature normally not active with Blu-ray. Very nice.

The conspiracy theorists who believe we never went to the Moon are uneducated fools. I pity their lack of deductive reasoning skills, because they are living a lie. Advanced photography forensics software that is considered accurate as human DNA analysis in scientifically determining authenticity of photographs or videos of crimes -- as real or fake -- have conclusively authenticated NASA's lunar photographs and videos taken during the Apollo missions. (References: Google these keywords: photography forensics analysis moon landing.) The results of photography forensics software analysis is accepted by government security and law enforcement agencies worldwide in authenticating video or photographs containing individuals committing crimes whose attorneys may argue tampering of the photos or footage to ""frame"" their client. The analysis uses mathematics and physics to analyze shadows, pixels, and anomalies down to atomic granularity which could reveal forgeries. The Hasselblad cameras used during the Apollo mission were specifically designed to make forgery detection mechanically conclusive even in 1969, giving modern forensics textbook photographs and videos to test photography forensics analytics software. Hasselblad technology which produced scientifically accurate photos and videos decades ahead of its time, has driven the final nails in the coffins of conspiracy nuts claims the Apollo mission footage and everything photographed was filmed in a studio.",1383264000,,5835,5.034196891191709

The beauty of nature and the strength of the human spirit moves me.  The music that starts this film touched my heart so much that tears ran down my check just listening to Mike Collins and Charlie Duke. Truly the music is a character in and of itself.  This is one of the most artistic documentaries about the Apollo missions that I've seen (and I've seen almost every one made).  You are taken up close to these old men.  You are looking into their eyes and their very souls.  Then you see them as young vibrant men.  And you see how much they've changed...and how much they have not changed.  This documentary takes you into places in the hearts of these astronauts you might never go unless you knew them personally.  (The additional film and the commentary cut are must see pieces as well.) Astronaut Gene Cernan is one of my favorites (read his autobiography Last Man on the Moon for a great  read!) and listening to him open up so expressively touched my soul.  They all dug deep to give the viewers a huge piece of themselves.

When I say ""personal stories"" I mean what they were thinking when an alarm went off on Apollo 11, what they thought of their fellow astronauts, what it's like to be on the moon, the words of the president's pre-recorded speech that would air if the first men on the moon were unable to take off from the moon, who first urinated on the moon, and drawings their kids stowed away in their belongings on the rocket.

It was great to capture interviews with the Apollo astronauts while we have them with us.

Potential buyers should be aware that this film is essentially a collection of sentimental (and somewhat tired) piecemeal memories of a handful of astronauts in their twilight years. There is barely a hint of the mind-boggling technical and scientific obstacles that were confronted and overcome by legions of seriously gifted engineers and scientists. The fact that considerable 'filler' is devoted to re-looped footage of SaturnV rocket exhaust without the merest mention of the name of Wernher von Braun bespeaks itself of bias or triviality.....

Lest anyone think that `anti-space' sentiments are behind this criticism, let me say that I toured NASA facilities at the height of the space program, and stood downwind of a Saturn V during launch, and felt (and smelt) the indescribable power of it. No one in their right mind would make a documentary of the immense achievement of getting to the Moon without even a hint of the staggering technical challenges behind the development of even this titanic booster alone..... and similarly, all the other unmentioned heroes in the other disciplines whose creativity and persevering grit represent the real triumph of the Apollo program.

Nova's 'To the Moon"" of 1999 is still a vastly more impressive and informative documentary. On a more technical level, 'Moon Machines' is recommended.

3002937,5,B000XJ5TPE,"I watched this movie, twice, when it was in the theaters and wanted to see it again after Neil Armstrong's death. Awesome is not too strong a description for it. There is some science, a history of the project, and lots of amazing visuals, but the heart of the movie is the personal experiences of the men who traveled to the moon during the short window of time that the journey was deemed worthy of resources. All of those men are old now, but their memories are vivid. Watching In the Shadow of the Moon brings back the excitement of those Kennedy inspired Apollo missions, which spanned most of the socially turbulent 1960s, and makes me wish that space travel could still be on our national agenda. The moon landing was meant to one-up the Soviets, but at least for a while people all over the world felt connected to and enthusiastic about the achievement.

Neil Armstrong didn't seek celebrity after being the first person to walk on the moon, and he didn't participate in the making of this movie, but he's remembered with fond amazement by the other astronauts and is seen in old video footage. All of the astronauts that did participate had fascinating things to say about the moon landing program, but Mike Collins, who never actually got to the surface of the moon himself, stands out with witty down-to-earth insights and self-depreciating humor.",1347062400,3,1359,4.734177215189874

3002940,3,B000XJ5TPE,"First, the good:

A number of the surviving moon-traveling astronauts are interviewed. They are great on camera, adding information, humor and insight to what it was like to do what they did. Mike Collins in particular has an incredible sense of underplayed humor, in a very ""who, me?"" fashion... while at the same time being classy and informative. All the astronaut interviews were interesting and enjoyable to listen to.

While there wasn't a lot of mission footage, what there was of it was nice (would have preferred more).

Now, the bad:

I didn't buy this to get the usual ""social lecture"" about Vietnam War and Woodstock, etc... The director felt compelled to spend time on that, perhaps some people want or thrive on juxtaposing pictures of social unrest with the Apollo missions, but I'm not one of them. Way too many scenes of firebombing Vietnam. If I want a Vietnam War documentary, I'll buy one, thank you.

The interviews with the astronauts were completely jumbled together, mixed with mission footage. This left me constantly trying to figure out what footage was I seeing. Hypothetical example: they'd interview Mike Collins (Apollo 11), then show footage from Apollo 15, then interview John Young (Apollo 16), then show footage from Apollo 11. Seems like the only thing driving the order was ""artistic license"".

One goof: the film states after Apollo 13 there were 5 successful landings. Let's see, 14, 15, 16, 17. Any way I count it, that comes up as four.

One quibble: The director chose to zoom in very tight on the astronauts' faces for the interviews. On a big-screen TV set, you can count their skin pores. I don't personally like this ""up close and personal"" videography style, back off a little, at least where I can see the whole face at one time.

And, a truly poor finish... having the different astronauts comment on ""moon landing hoax"" theories. I know there's still some ignorant people that choose to believe that, but why include such nonsense in this video? Even in a ""refuting"" way, it's not worthy of being addressed. Perhaps we should have had them share their views on astrology or whether the earth is flat as well.",1338508800,33,2158,4.829268292682927

Neil Armstrong's absence is conspicuous and disappointing, as his words upon first setting foot on the lunar surface have become so synonymous with the triumphs of the program, but his peers offer plenty of insight and more than a few fascinating tidbits about the hours leading up to their days in history. As always, the astronauts' testimony is honest and revealing - in their twilight years, these guys have nothing to hide - and proves just how risky the idea of space travel really was in that era. The archival footage of each mission is still amazing, beautiful, silencing material, but almost all of that has been seen ad infinitum by this point and the few scraps of unseen film that were dug up for the production aren't anything worth writing home about. It's a subject I'll never tire of, and hearing the story of its inception told from the men who lived it is a rare opportunity. I just wish it were more in-depth and probing, because in the end it's basically reshuffling a very familiar story in a slightly original way.",1331164800,,1176,4.631578947368421

All we knew then was what Walter Cronkite reported.

3002944,5,B000XJ5TPE,"Made in the style of Band of Brothers (but without the use of any actors) this documentary film is both a record of historical importance and an overview of personal reflection on my part. I remember watching in awe as I'd get home from school and see a rocket blasting-off into space and men talking to 'mission control' and those beeps that made it all seem so technical. A time made for boys. Men escaping from the earth.

New for me since that youthful age is the deaths of the crew who never took-off. The fabled first earthrise photograph was also beyond my years but the beauty of it all struck me then as it does now. Power, raw awesome power so plainly visible is so magnetic to watch. Man riding a female rocketship 'they rode her to the moon' is the language of ultimate release. Away from it all.

Also apparent to me now is the importance of the personalities involved. Of course the ultra-cool Neil Armstrong gets the accolades for guiding the vehicle to landing and taking that first step on the moon but the characters of all the individuals made it all happen as much as the scientific and technical developments.

My fifty years on this planet have given me an appreciation of language which gets richer as I get older. Some of the astronauts make no apology for using Biblical language 'another heavenly body' in Armstrong's own pre-flight words, as well as an Old Testament quote used on that first mission to the moon (without landing on it). They also 'set sail for the moon' and most movingly describe a view of earth 'hung in the blackness of space.' And all agree that Neil Armstrong's immortal words as he took the first step away from our world as perfect for the moment and eternity: 'one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.'

I have visited Houston, seen the Apollo rocket lain serenely on its side and even 'mission control' monitoring satellites was entered and duly photographed back in the mid 1980s. It was the size that struck me - how small the crafts were! Though appreciating the enormity of the achievement and now understand a progression for me from viewing live as a boy, making Airfix models, seeing the real thing and now in the comfort of home re-living the triumph of human achievement. It is the ultimate travel experience. Exploration, extreme danger and deep personal development. Touching the stars. One step at a time.",1329091200,,2381,4.648456057007126

If you were there or not (I was not), this film does just an incredible job of captivating its watcher with the marvel of such a feat.  Beyond the summit of Everest, beyond the construction of the pyramids, this film represents the epitome of humankind.  In a time when nothing seems certain, when our country seems to have fallen from grace, this film serves as an excellent reminder of what made the United States what it is today.  I watched it today and I was proud to be an American.  The film has an excellent format that summarizes the Apollo space flights into a 1:40 minute movie.  Not every detail was hit upon, but overall it does a great job.  I was most impressed by the humanizing of the experience through the astronauts.  Hearing heartfelt, first-hand accounts of what it was like to be there, the thoughts and emotions, is both mesmerizing and confounding.  I couldn't imagine what such an event would be like, how it would change you.  As a professional pilot and an amateur astronomer, I was so glad to hear my thoughts reaffirmed towards the end of the film.  We live in the Garden of Eden.  I don't care if you buy into that mentality or not, it's just how I feel after studying the universe for several years.  In my opinion, this is a mandatory watch.

This is a movie about human beings, their need to explore the unknown, and their sense of place on earth, in space, and in the universe. Many of the astronauts talk with an almost religious overtone to their experiences in space, yet it is not religion as practiced on earth. It is more of a raw spiritual reflection that is powerful and thought-provoking. Whether a viewer was alive during the Apollo missions or has simply learned about the U.S. space program in school, there is much to learn from the astronauts reflections 40 years after their accomplishments. This is not Ron Howard in his classic masterful storytelling mode but rather Ron Howard masterfully facilitating all of the people who crafted the story themselves, from the astronauts to the people who spent so many hours in the archives to get just the right pieces of historical footage to complement the astronauts recollections. I have given this DVD to all of my relatives, those who watched Apollo live and those whose young lives are developing today, to give inspiration from real people reflecting on real events.",1316908800,,1251,4.796296296296297

I also learned, to my disappointment, that decisions made in Washington, D.C. have a profound effect on every program and often the effect is negative.  Many of the public outcries about unnecessary spending in both the defense and science and space programs are a direct result of the political decisions made by very uninformed elected officials.

You will feel fortunate to be a human living on our oasis of a planet.  The candid thoughts by the astronauts and other NASA staff are perfectly illustrated; the soundtrack causes a vortex of emotion.

They describe the ""jewel of the Earth"" the way they have seen it from the deep space, and the Moon as the ""most beautiful desert ever."" This movie made a very deep impression on me.

Man's journey to the moon seriously got underway when President Kennedy said:

""We choose to go to the moon.. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.""

NASA was implementing plans to return to the moon until President Obama canceled the Constellation program and America's return to the moon.

Obama's NASA budget perfectly captures the difference in spirit between Kennedy's liberalism and Obama's.

Kennedy's was an expansive, bold, outward-looking summons. Obama's is a constricted, inward-looking call to retreat.

The individual astronauts accounts and feelings make it so much more than just a documentary.  The music also is so beautiful and touching.

I have been watching space documentaries for as long as they have been made and while this one differs by including some personal thoughts of the three astronauts, in particular, Michael Collins, whose excellent book ""Carrying The Fire"" I read some thirty years ago, there was little in the film that was worth the purchase price.

3002985,5,B000XJ5TPE,"Perhaps the best example of a BHAG (the term, ""Big Hairy Audacious Goal,"" was popularized by Jim Collins) is President John F. Kennedy's famous address to the U.S. Congress on May 25, 1961.  He inspired the nation with these words, ""First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.""

Kennedy didn't live to see that audacious dream realized, but on July 20, 1969, the whole world watched as Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon.  Since then ""put a man on the moon by 1970"" has inspired thousands of leaders to put a short-term target on the wall--and, in bold faith, blast off.  For faith-based organizations, I prefer the term ""Big Holy Audacious Goal.""

So I was energized once again with that profound BHAG while at a client's senior leaders retreat in the Colorado mountains recently.  One evening, we sat mesmerized by the stunning DVD, In the Shadow of the Moon, Ron Howard's documentary of the 12 American astronauts who walked on the moon between 1968 and 1972.

This extraordinary 110-minute film has teachable moments in almost every one of the 20 management buckets from my book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mastering-The-Management-Buckets-20-Critical-Competencies-for-Leading-Your-Business-or-Non-profit/dp/0830745947/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mastering The Management Buckets: 20 Critical Competencies for Leading Your Business or Non-profit</a>.  The Results Bucket: check.  The Strategy Bucket: bull's-eye.  The Systems Bucket: 15 astronauts owned 15 segments of the mission. The Crisis Bucket: ""Houston, we have a problem.""

The film is absolutely rich in memorable moments in the Team Bucket.  Then there's the People Bucket with often hilarious and poignant illustrations of the four social styles, including analyticals (Armstrong) and expressives (James Lovell).  This massive, visionary expedition would have failed miserably without monumental achievements in the Delegation Bucket.  There's a lot more.

Besides the exquisite cinematography and the dramatic explosions (they had lots of failures enroute to the BHAG), the insights shared by the aging and straight-talking astronauts (it was filmed in 2008) were remarkable, often funny and frequently breath-taking.

If you're interested in the Apollo missions at all, this is the best place to start, hearing about them directly from the men who flew the missions. They describe the complete program, from the X-15, through the gemini and mercury space programs, and finally the Apollo missions. These are not dry, boring interviews, but spoken with humor, wonder, and in the case of the deadly Apollo 1 fire, a lasting horror, grief and anger is still palpable in these astronauts as they discuss the details of the accident. If you want to meet real heroes, start here. Once you see this film and get to know the astronauts, any other movies will make much more sense.

For an entertaining semi-fictional movie about the Apollo-11 mission, I also highly recommend The Dish, about the Parkes Observatory Antenna in Australia, during the Apollo 11 moon mission. Parkes relayed the first TV images from the moon to the world, and is still in operation today. The ensemble cast does a great job, bringing a warm human touch to what is usually considered a dry, dull footnote in history.

The Apollo footage is amazing. (I was confused by the description that said 'Full Frame' on the back of the box; I soon found out that the interviews are in wide-screen but the footage is full screen). On a HD television it feels like you are almost there (though the movie is not in HD, the DVD is very high quality).

The beauty of this film is not just in the footage but in the insight the Astronauts give. They talk about the missions, their thoughts and fears, and more importantly their hopes. Jim Lovell remarked that from the moon you can hide the entire earth behind the tip of your thumb - all your problems, worries, friends, family, businesses, etc - all behind your thumb. Basically saying that all of our petty disagreements should be overshadowed by the fact that we are very unique and very fortunate to be able to live on this utopia. Other astronauts commented on their own epiphanies as well.

Philip Sheppard composed the music for this documentary...I went out and bought the album soon after I viewed the movie....This is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard.

Along with the film comes a slew of special features: An hour of out-takes, full movie commentary (very insightful to film buffs and space buffs), a feature on how the music was made for the film, etc, etc...

'In The Shadow Of The Moon' should be required viewing in all public/private schools. It is not just a documentary on the NASA moon missions but a movie about how unique and precious the planet earth is and how fortunate we are to live on it.

Alan Bean is perhaps the most entertaining commentator. He spoke candidly of being afraid, and of realizing that death exists outside the capsule. Were the window to pop out, he would be dead in a second. Buzz Aldrin spoke not of fear of the flight itself, but a constant worry that something could go wrong, after which there definitely would be something to be afraid of. Lovell spoke of conquering his emotions after the Apollo 13 emergency situation first hit.  Buzz Aldrin spoke of the lifelong challenge of living up to his reputation as a moon-conqueror. Gene Cernan and Charles Duke spoke of spiritual and religious experiences after their flights. Duke became a born-again believer in Christ.

A segment is shown of Walter Cronkite's reporting of the Apollo 11 flight, and his emotional reaction when Eagle touched down on the moon. There are also clips shown of 1960's events, such as the JFK speech that started the race to the moon, the race riots, the Vietnam War and the antiwar movement, etc. Some of the astronauts note that their colleagues were in Vietnam, and they would've been also had they not been astronauts. Michael Collins commented on a speech that President Nixon was to give had the astronauts been stranded on the moon: ""Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin know that there is no hope for their recovery, but they also know that they have brought the world together.""

Gene Cernan gave a parting shot to the Apollo-moonlanding-deniers: ""I was there, I made the footprints on the moon, and no one can take that away from me.""",1246147200,3,1723,4.955017301038063

3003015,5,B000XJ5TPE,"Words almost fail me in trying to describe how good, and more so, important this historical document really is. This was a very rare appearance of every living astronaut who walked on the surface of the Moon (with the notable absence of the first, Neil Armstrong) including Gene Cernan,  Jack Schmitt, John Young, Charlie Duke, Dave Scott,  Ed Mitchell, Alan Bean and Buzz Aldrin. In addition, Jim Lovell, the only man to travel twice to the Moon without landing (Cernan and Young also went twice) as well as Apollo 11 Command Module Pilot Mike Collins appears as well. They give a very human description of what they experienced and felt about their history-making experiences.
It is important to remember these men were educated to be pilots of high performance aircraft in addition to engineering, astronautics and computer science.  People like this frequently are not good at communicating with those who are not like minded but it is interesting that most of these men were able to be able to express their very intimate feelings about what they experienced.
A few comments:
First of all the restoration of the films from the 1960's and 1970's was absolutely amazing. The colors are fresh and sharp. It looks like it was filmed yesterday. Prior to this, NASA films tended to be of pretty poor quality.
Secondly, I am disappointed that Neil Armstrong did not appear. I realize that before he flew the mission he studied how Charles Lindbergh dealt with fame, ending up with the tragedy of having his baby son kidnapped and murdered, plus disgracing his reputation by associating himself with racist and antisemitic movements. Armstrong felt that he had to make a choice between becoming a known public figure or keeping out of sight, so he chose the second because the first had too many dangers associated with it. I guess that if he had to be one or the other, he made the right decision, but I think a rare document like this deserved his participation.
Third, I am somewhat disappointed that John Young did not appear more. He is actually the most accomplished astronaut of the Mercury-Germin-Apollo-Space Shuttle era, having piloted every type of American spacecraft except for Mercury. Everyone says he has a brilliant engineering mind, and not only that, but he also mastered the lunar geology, unlike other Apollo astronauts, and did a masterful scientific job on Apollo 16 but as I pointed out before, he probably doesn't communicate as well as the others to the general public.
I also would have liked to hear more from Dave Scott. His gigantic contribution to Apollo was his understanding the importance of the scientific work, going beyong the ""gee-whiz"" aspects of the first landings, and he also did outstanding scientific work in Apollo 15, the first to use the Lunar Rover which allowed for far more geological work to be done on the missions.
I would have liked to seen more of the work that was done on the Lunar surface by the astronauts and what they thought of this aspect of the missions, but there is little of this. Most of the program dealt with the problems of getting to the Moon and then back home, but I just can't enough of the scenes on the surface. As I said above, these restored films are so much clearer than the old NASA films so I would have liked to see more.
Finally during the rolling of the ending credits, it was decided to have several of the men refuting the idiotic conspiracy theories claiming the landings were faked (odd how the USSR, which bitterly opposed the US at the time due to Cold War tensions never made such a claim!). I believe that this was not necessary, merely dignifying those unscrupulous people who peddle this nonsense.
Having said all this, I think every one in the United States , and then everyone else around the world should see this film and realize what great things can be accomplished by many people working together as a team. The only comparable recent historical event that was like this was the victory by the Allies in the Second World War, but the difference being that Apollo was done in the name of peace.",1242604800,,4093,4.745786516853933

3003041,5,B000XJ5TPE,"I have a clear and vivid memory of Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon because my brother made sure I would.
I was seven years old at the time. My brother, Daryl, a decade older than me, said, ""You have to watch this and remember this. This is history."" So I watched closely and made sure to remember; as did billions of other people around the world on July 21, 1969.
That wonderful historical moment and the hard work that led up to it is beautifully captured in the new documentary, In the Shadow of the Moon. Directed by David Sington, this film understandably won the audience prize at the Sundance Film Festival because it leaves viewers cheered and inspired.
It was rather astonishing to hear in the film President John F. Kennedy propose, almost promise, that America would be on the moon by the end of the decade. He acknowledges that the technology, and even some of the metal alloys, had not yet been developed, but assures the nation that these things will be discovered, and the job will be done.
It made me think of Proverbs 29:18 - ""Without a vision, the people perish"" (KJV). The sixties were a difficult time in the US -- war, assassinations, social upheaval - but the space program provided a vision of accomplishing great things.
God knows that we need big dreams. It can be too easy to become consumed by the petty details of life -- household chores, meeting budgets, running errands - which must be dealt with, but we can not believe those details are life. We need to be reminded that there are bigger things to be accomplished.
If you are a part of a church, you need to deal with the painting, the carpet and the tile. These are all good things. But you need to be dreaming about bigger things. Some scoffed at JFK's goal to reach the moon in less than a decade. It seemed impossible. But it could not have happened if it hadn't been proposed.
Congregations need to dream big dreams. Could we have a thousand people in our congregation? Could we support a Spanish language congregation that would be healthy and strong? Could we double, triple, quadruple our missions budget? Great things cannot happen without a great vision. And God's vision is greater than our own.
The heart of the film is the interviews with the Apollo astronauts. Most of these men are in their seventies, before long many of these men will be gone. So it is valuable to record their unique experiences.
Neil Armstrong, noted for his reclusive nature, is not interviewed, but he is well represented in news reel footage and the anecdotes of other astronauts. Armstrong's crew mates, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, provide a fascinating picture of that first moon landing and the experience of being truly alone in space (though Collins says he never felt lonely).
An interesting coda in the end credits is a response of the astronauts to those who say that there was no moon landing, that it was all a hoax (a la Capricorn One). They scoff at the scoffers, postulating that such a lie could not have been kept quiet by so many people. One of the astronauts (John Young?) wonders why, if it was a fraud, they had to make so many fraudulent trips.
(Not mentioned in the film, the incident of Buzz Aldrin punching a moon launch skeptic in the nose. The punchee sued Aldrin, but the judge quickly threw the case out of court. This led one wag to say that Buzz Aldrin is the only person of whom it can be said that walking on the moon is the second coolest thing he ever did. Not that I would ever advocate such violence.)
Another astronaut notes that around any great historical event, conspiracy theories will abound. There are people who believe that the German Holocaust of the Jews never happened or that planes couldn't have taken down the World Trade Centers. No amount of evidence will convince these people otherwise.
Jesus recognized the stubborn nature of people. He performed miracle after miracle and yet most people of His time still doubted him. But He knew that skepticism would persist even after His resurrection. In the parable of Lazarus and the rich man he said, ""If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead."" (Luke 16:31, NIV) There is vast evidence that the Bible is a reliable historical document, that Jesus was raised from the dead and that the world was created with intelligent design. But doubt will persist because admitting these truths would mean changing one's life.
It was interesting that toward the end of the film several of the astronauts confess that being in space made them consider the magnificence of the earth and space and the necessity of believing in a Creator. In fact, Charlie Duke in the film tells about how shortly after his trip to the moon he received Christ as his Lord and Savior. He says that though his trip to the moon was a great three day adventure, his adventure with God is forever.
It is unlikely that any of us will be able to walk on the moon any time soon. But we will all be able to have the adventure of walking with God.",1227916800,2,5057,4.570484581497797
3003042,5,B000XJ5TPE,"""In the Shadow of the Moon"" is a first rate film that highlights the national effort to put a man on the moon before the end of the decade of the 1960's.  It chronicles the early failures and the few successes as NASA experimented with rockets.  Using interviews with the surviving astronauts and archival film footage, much of which has never been seen before, the film follows the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs.  It is a captivating film and the interviews with the astronauts, a risky venture since it had the potential to be boring and self-serving, is actually extremely interesting, funny, and heart-warming.  I first saw this film at the RiverRun International Film Festival in Winston-Salem, NC and the film's director and producer were on hand.  Strangely enough, they were British filmmakers who were interested in the race to the moon and gained unheard of access to NASA's film footage and access to the astronauts who were so willing to tell the true story behind mankind's greatest voyages.  The film was later bought by Ron Howard for its theatrical release but, other than giving himself production credit at the beginning of the movie, Ron changed nothing in the film (a wise move on his part).  I highly recommend this film to anyone with a remote interest in the space program, in American history, and who would simply just like to be entertained and/or remember back to a time when the whole world looked up with wonder and amazement.",1227484800,,1461,4.843373493975903

3003045,4,B000XJ5TPE,"This documentary had some fantastic footage in it, and featured a very personal look at many of the astronauts who went to the moon. Overall, that is a very exclusive club: only about a dozen men ever did it in the history of the world and just eight or nine ever stepped foot on it. Most of them are still alive and they discuss their adventures, insights and personal feelings here.

One gets the feeling that the rest of us will never know exactly how beautiful the moon is except to take the astronauts' words about it, because even the pictures on this DVD can't convey that. It just looks dull and gray, but the men say it was spectacular. I believe them.

Since this documentary is about 100 minutes long, you get a lot of information. You also get reminded how close two of the three men who went up on that historic first walk on the moon came to not making it home alive.

A glaring absence in this documentary - through no fault of the film-makers, is the most famous astronaut of them all: Neil Armstrong, the first man to step foot on the moon! Apparently, he did not want to be part of this film. One of the astronauts, near the very end of this documentary, mentions something briefly about Armstrong being somewhat of a ""recluse"" now and it ""being understandable with what he's gone through."" From what I've read, a lot of people have tried to make money off him in shady ways and so now he's withdrawn from the public spotlight. Still, not having his thoughts on this historic mission is a real loss to this film and makes this story seem incomplete.

After a slow first half hour, this really picks up when we travel along with Armstrong's Apollo 11 crew. Seeing slow-motion pictures of the lift-off and great shots of the earth are just awesome. The worldwide reaction to the success of this mission will bring a tear or two to your eyes.

3003050,5,B000XJ5TPE,"In the shadow of the moon is an accomplishment in that it holds one's attention even if one knows the outcome of the story.  This always struck me as one of the great attributes of Ron Howard's ""Apollo 13"" in that we all knew what happened, to varying degrees of specificiality, and yet it was still dramatic and compelling.  ""In The Shadow of the Moon"" accomplishes much the same in more of a documentary way.  The film is compelling and captivating and not just because of the story that is and was the Apollo program.  A film of this sorts runs the huge risk of being cheesy and over stated.  It also runs the risk of telling nothing new other than the facts, most of which those who would see the film would know.  Instead ""In the Shadow"" tells the basic story for those who do not know the history of Apollo, and yet gives Apollophiles something satisfying.  For me it was the perspective that comes with distance in time. We are now almost 40 years since ""we"" went to the moon, and the power the experience had for those who went, magnifying the memories for those of us who watched and remember, speaks of the greatness of the endeavor.  All of the astronauts were changed for their going.  I remember the crew of Apollo 12, if my memory is correct, speaking about when one ""returned from the moon,"" not physically but emotionally, as being the time when one didn't think about the experience.  Judging from ""In the Shadow,"" most or all of the astronauts never fully returned.  Even as they traveled, explored, and brought back rocks and soil, they seemed to leave a part of themselves behind.

3003052,4,B000XJ5TPE,"""Awesome"" and ""awe inspiring"" have become hackneyed clichs, but they truly apply in the case of this riveting documentary.  ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" chronicles the Apollo space program, which audaciously planned to land a man on the moon within a 7-8 year time frame.  We now all know they succeeded but it is easy to forget or take for granted the enormity - and dangers - of the task set before us.  America galvanized behind John F. Kennedy's goal to land a man on the moon before the end of the 1960's decade.

The film is a blend of ""talking heads"" from various ex-astronauts, now clearly in the twilight of their lives, and documentary footage from the 1960's.  As the Eagle spacecraft lands in July 1969 and Neal Armstrong sets foot on the lunar surface, it's hard not to tear up in pride, in pride for what America was able to accomplish.  You see how the entire world rejoiced in this triumph and identified with it, hearkening to  time when it seemed that everyone else in the world did not hate  or resent Americans.

Another undercurrent is the spiritual epiphany that the moon trips induced in many of the astronauts.  The view of the bejeweled earth from outer space gave some of them a new sense of wonder, awe, belief in God and a vision of stewardship over our planet.

A gaping omission is the absence of any comments from Neal Armstrong, who apparently is a committed recluse.

The notion of watching a documentary about the Apollo Space program may sounds as dull as reading transcripts of the Federal Reserve Board, but I assure you, you will NEVER be bored!",1220227200,6,1582,4.570921985815603
3003053,5,B000XJ5TPE,"This is an incredible documentary about true American heroes, a time when we dreamed, and a true story about going to the moon simply because we believed we could do it.  Well written, directed and produced this movie has amazing footage that tickles the imagination.  The backdrop for this drama was the cold war, Vietnam and  a country going through major growing pains.  The US space program was frequently the one bright unwavering beacon of hope through the turbulent 60s and early 70s.

In all the time that we have been on the earth with over 6 billion alive today and many more billion who have lived, we have only put 12 humans on another world.  It gives goose bumps to think about what these men have seen and done.

I have met very fortunate to meet several of these men in person.  Each one is different and yet they all share great desires, passions and dreams. Their commitment to excellence is unquestionable. Today, excellence still exists, but it isn't respected like it was then.  We can learn much from this movie and these amazing human beings.

The only other film that rivals it is the Discovery Channel's ""When We Left Earth."" That particular film covers the entire Mercury-Gemini-Apollo era as well as the space shuttle era, however. ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" displays terrifically digitized NASA films--more brilliant than I've seen before--as well as commentary from the aging veteran astronauts who flew the missions to the moon. Curiously missing, however, is the reclusive Neil Armstrong (who appears in ""When We Left Earth""). It's no big deal, though, as the others take up the slack. Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin, and Alan Bean are particularly entertaining. Jim Lovell, Gene Cernan, Edgar Mitchell, Dave Scott, John Young, Harrison Schmitt, and Charlie Duke (who, as Apollo 11's capcom, offers valuable insight into that mission) round out this brilliant crew of space veterans.

All of the emotions of being there is brought home in these interviews with the men who made the flights.

John Young, Edgar Mitchell and David Scott also evoke emotional responses but in a vastly more subtle and understated manner.  I could have done without Aldrin and Cernan, both of who continue to exhibit tremendous self-regard all these decades.

3003070,5,B000XJ5TPE,"When we think of the 1960's today we so often think of the assassinations, the race riots, the Vietnam War, the Beatles, etc. We often forget this was also the decade of the race to the moon. In 1961 the Russians officially launched the space race by launching the first human into orbit soon followed by a 15 minute manned flight by the U.S. The newly elected president of the United States, John F. Kennedy laid down the gauntlet by challenging our country to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade, at that time a more than ambitious (some thought impossible) goal. This film is the story, in the APOLLO astronaut's own words and incredible archival footage of how the U.S. became the first to land on the moon. As Roger Ebert says, we tend to focus on the accomplishment and not on the journey. This is about the journey as well as the incredible achievement. The clips, many seen on film for the first time, especially those walking on the moon's surface, are spectacular. This is a story that should be seen by everyone, especially those who did not grow up in the sixties. We may have forgotten that the first three astronauts were killed in a fire on the launchpad that could have stopped the whole mission dead in its tracks. These are the only men in the history of our planet who have seen earth from another celestial location. One final note. This was an achievement that united, literally the whole world. As the astronauts traveled the world afterwards, they were struck by the fact that everywhere, people referred to the achievement as 'WE' did it, not you did it. It was something that everyone was proud of, regardless of their country. How different that seems from the world culture today. Is there anything we could conquer today that could unite the world into saying WE did it. You will not be disappointed in watching this great film. [...].",1213401600,3,1874,4.563798219584569

3003073,5,B000XJ5TPE,"This excellent and exciting documentary traces the growth of America's Apollo space program, from its early inception until the last manned moon mission in 1972.

Before his assassination, President Kennedy challenged Americans to put a man on the moon and bring him home safely.  Few realistically thought that this lofty goal could be achieved, but the people at NASA embraced this challenge and worked tirelessly to make it reality.  America was also in a space race with the Soviets, and they had already put a man in orbit.  America needed a response from its own program; something that the Soviets could never hope to match.  Apollo was that response.

The DVD begins with the selection of the original Apollo astronauts.  These men, in the words of one of them, went from ordinary pilots to heroes literally overnight.  The Gemini program put the first American into space, but the goal was still to reach the moon.  The first Apollo spacecraft, Apollo 1, suffered a tragic fire during testing, and all three astronauts aboard were killed.  Many of the other astronauts openly wondered if this would be the end of the program; it was not.  Training continued in preparation for landing on the moon.  Apollo 8, piloted by Jim Lovell, orbited only 60 miles above the lunar surface but did not land.

The stage was now set for Apollo 11, set to lift off in July, 1969.  Two other crews were also training simultaneously.  The entire world watched as Apollo 11 lifted off in the July heat and began its historic voyage.  After three days, the crew of three was ready to land on the moon.  The DVD has footage of Walter Cronkite describing the landing as well as a professional baseball game being interrupted to let the crowd know about the historic event.  Neil Armstrong descended down the nine steps from the lunar lander and uttered his famous ""One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"" sentence.

The fateful mission of Apollo 13 is also described in the documentary.  Again, Jim Lovell was in command of the mission.  This time, however, disaster struck.  An accident occurred when the oxygen tanks were stirred, causing a terrific explosion which crippled the spacecraft.  Many thought that the astronauts would not make it back, but the men at NASA never waivered in their belief. Despite overwhelming odds, the people at mission control were able to bring the astronauts back safely.

This is simply an awesome documentary.  Only 12 American men have walked upon the the surface of the moon, and they remain the only human beings to have stood on another world.  Many of the astronauts who flew on the lunar missions have been interviewed for this documentary, and their stories and insight put the viewer right on the moon with them.  The actual footage from the missions is included as well.  I was only 4 years old when Apollo 11 landed on the moon, so I have very little recollection of the actual experience.  But this great documentary brings everything back as if it happened only yesterday.  I plan to show this DVD to my three young children so they can experience what the children of the 60s were able to see.

I give this DVD my highest recommendation.  12 have been there; will there ever be another?",1212105600,2,3236,4.764388489208633

3003075,5,B000XJ5TPE,"I'm a space nut. So, at first, I'm thinking, ""This is pretty familiar stuff.""

I had often imagined what liftoff felt like, but then I heard astronauts describe it. Mike Collins: ""I'd describe it as a nervous novice driving a wide car down a narrow alley. You know, you've gotta make corrections. You're not quite sure. You zig this way, and I mean... and what it is, is those big motors underneath, gimbaling, you know, swiveling back and forth to keep you in balance ... and the gimbaling of the motors, you feel in the seat of your pants. And, thinking, 'Gee, that launch tower is just a few feet off to one side. I hope this sucker isn't gonna gimbal over in that direction too much.'""

I thought I knew all about the 1202 and 1201 computer alarms that almost aborted the first moon landing. The on-board computers were overloaded. I knew why mission controllers said, ""We're go on that."" But I never knew how the computers got overloaded until Buzz Aldrin explained it in this film: ""Being Dr. Rendezvous, no matter what the checklist said, I was gonna leave the rendezvous radar on and active... So the landing radar is feeding information, the rendezvous radar is, and evidently that combination was not anticipated by the guys at MIT.""

The astronaut interviews pull you into the experience of going to the moon -- and more importantly, of returning safely to the earth. Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean:

""Since that time, I have not complained about the weather one single time. I'm glad there is weather. I've not complained about traffic. I'm glad there's people around. One of the things that I did when I got home, I went down to shopping centers, and I'd just go around there, get an ice cream cone or somethin', and just watch the people go by, and think: 'Boy, we're lucky to be here. Why do people complain about the earth? We are living in the Garden of Eden.'""

I'm a DVD nut, too. I tend to listen to all the commentary tracks, and watch all the extra features. Even if you don't do that, on this DVD, be sure to watch the ""Bonus Interviews & Stories"" in ""Special Features."" It's about an hour of additional material that was cut from the movie, and it's solid gold.

Excellent movie. Excellent DVD.",1211155200,10,2217,4.557788944723618
3003076,5,B000XJ5TPE,"Space exploration enthusiasts will want more, and are rewarded with an excellent ""out takes"" section on this disk that is as good as the feature presentation itself.  This is obviously a labor of love, and it's very lucky for many of us who witnessed the moon landings that the producers were able to capture the words and memories of this handfull of men who journeyed to our nearest alien world.  While all of the astronauts who contributed interview time do a great job, I think Michael Collins of Apollo 11 brings the most interesting and human view to this great adventure.  Highly recommended, and worth every penny!",1211155200,3,622,4.794392523364486
3003077,5,B000XJ5TPE,"""In the Shadow of the Moon"" is one of the best documentaries ever made about the space program. Masterfully combining vintage footage with new interviews with Apollo astronauts, the filmmakers deftly explore the history of the lunar program, focusing on Apollo 11, but giving appropriate coverage to other significant events (Apollo 8, Apollo 13, the value of the lunar rover on later missions, etc.) as well.

I had seen most of the vintage footage before, although the filmmakers found some fantastic archival footage of the astronauts (including some great pre-Apollo footage). The difference in this project was the dexterity that the clips were woven together with: it is a clearly superior effort, and one of the best documentaries I have seen.

As wonderful as it is to see the footage from Apollo, the best part of the film is by far the insightful interviews with the Apollo survivors (sans the stoic and reclusive Neil Armstrong). The filmmakers spent two days with each of the astronauts interviewed, giving them a great deal of material to edit, and to say that the finished product is masterful is an understatement. I was especially fond of the interviews with Mike Collins and Alan Bean, and I loved the contrasts between the personality types involved. If anyone needed proof that John Young is one of the most laconic, yet witty, astronauts in NASA history, the proof is here. Likewise, Buzz Aldrin still comes across as the hyper-intelligent ""Dr. Rendezvous"", though more relaxed with age. All the astronauts are clearly very bright, keenly insightful, and give perspectives that are extremely interesting from the vantage point of almost 40 years of reflection: I was especially taken by Bean's comments that he hasn't complained once about the weather since he returned to earth. This and the other insights from Bean late in the film are golden.

The film has many extras including unused scenes, and a fascinating commentary track: I highly recommend all the extras. The film is nearly perfect, and provides both those very familiar with spaceflight and more casual viewers information through clever editing, interview footage, and occasional captions, including translations of sometimes difficult to understand exchanges between the spacecraft and Houston. The film is meticulous in accuracy, and an explanation of all footage substitutions are thoroughly explained in the commentary. So devoted to accuracy is the film that I noted only one extremely minor error in the film, when the term ""REFSMMAT"" was translated as ""azimuth"" in a caption. (This, obviously, has no value to viewers.) For a documentary of this scope and complexity, that is an amazing achievement.

I highly recommend ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" to everyone, and I thank the makers of this brilliant film for bringing it to us, and I thank the astronauts for participating in this truly worthwhile endeavor.",1211068800,11,2902,5.154989384288747

That said, I watched this video after I had watched the Apollo 13 DVD, the one with real life dialog with Gene Krantz and Jim Lovell.

The music is beautiful and really adds to the experience.

Overall, my favorite NASA dvd is the Nova ""To The Moon"", but this might overtake that.  Very heartfelt.  I now love Michael Collins, almost as much as my hero, Jim Lovell.

In Special Features section dealing with Gemini program there is a few seconds b/w shot of both John Young and Michael Collins inside the Gemini 10 capsule, both are spacesuited. I never ever saw the Gemini 10 interior footage before. To be sure I stopped the film several times to check my identification and it is beyond any doubt it's really very rare Gemini 10 interior footage.

Now, see the real men behind the space helmets and learn more than ever what it was like to fly to the moon.  You simply won't believe how ""human"" these now aging astronauts are - how emotional their storytelling is, how grateful they are for having the opportunity, and how descriptive they are in their personal recollections.  This is not a film about patriotism or the United States vs. the U.S.S.R.  It is a film about the human spirit and the wonder of exploring space, the moon, and the unknown.  I am touched by each of the astronauts as they tell their stories and I'm sure you will be as well.

What's great about this film is how beautifully it was put together.  It's a wonderful mix of footage from the missions (which looks better than ever) and interviews with the astronauts as they tell their stories. A terrific surprise is the musical score which in a word, is perfect.  If you're a fan of Horner's score for ""Apollo 13"" you will definitely love this music.

Do yourself a favor and add this dvd to your library.  You won't be sorry.

One side note - The additional interviews with the astronauts in the special features section are great.  Each man goes into a bit more detail into some of the other happenings of not only the Apollo program, but Gemini as well.  My only beef with these extra interviews is that the video/picture did not get the same treatment as the film.  It doesn't look like the editors did any color correcting so don't fret if all the sudden Charlie Duke looks really bright and washed out and Dave Scott looks like he's sitting in a dark room.

Juxtaposing film of the 30-something test-pilots turned astronauts, with the nearing 80 year olds now reflecting back puts a new perspective on Apollo.  Michael Collins' and Alan Bean's reflections are quite folksy.  Edgar Mitchell and Gene Cernan share the spiritual impact their missions had on them.

It is especially interesting to compare Jim Lovell relating the story of an atheist suing NASA over Apollo 8's crew reciting Genesis on Christmas Eve (on man's first journey beyond Earth orbit), to Cernan's realization upon looking up at Earth that God was bigger than religion (on man's last journey beyond Earth orbit).  The spiritual impact of traveling so far from Earth cannot be discounted.  Edgar Mitchell similarly shares a deeply personal spiritual experience.  Also poignant is John Young's comment after observing the changes in pollution in the Earth's atmosphere over his 20 years of spaceflights to people's seemingly petty concern over $3 a gallon gasoline.

The style is fairly typical of modern documentaries.  Silent close ups of now wrinkled faces combine with the astronauts' voice overs of documentary footage humanize these men.  No longer supermen, shown on TV and traveling the world, now they are ordinary men with extraordinary stories.  Who will carry the fire once they are gone?

Simply put, 24 men have traveled beyond Earth orbit.  Only they have seen the Earth as a full orb in space.  Six of those men have passed away.  The remaining grow old.  This is chance to hear them speak about how they played a part in history, and how it affected them.  It is not to be missed.",1206835200,2,1756,5.02076124567474

But this documentary from Ron Howard seemed fresh and original to me, in part because it focuses on the human side of the Apollo program. While it includes some breathtaking never-before-seen footage from NASA, it features the astronauts talking about what it felt like to walk on the moon, what it was like emotionally and physically during their experiences. Both familar and new footage is shown as they relate their stories. Very moving, very engaging, not hardware focused.",1206403200,5,615,4.923076923076923

The astronauts themselves tell the story in their own words, and there's no CGI or special effects -- it's all genuine NASA footage.  The story is by turns moving, poignant, thrilling, and (with the Apollo 1 fire) tragic, and it will have you on the edge of your chair for two full hours.

3003119,5,B000XJ5TPE,"This may be the only DVD I've purchased that offers deleted scenes that are just as good as the final film. In fact, there is nearly an hour's worth of unused footage offered as a bonus feature, and your interest in seeing these eighteen clips will depend on how much nostalgia you feel for the space race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union that lasted from 1957 until the early 1970's. Spurred on by John F. Kennedy's commitment for us to land a man on the moon before the end of the 1960's, NASA developed the Apollo program, which is the focus of this superbly produced 2007 film. British documentarian David Sington was able to record on-camera interviews with ten of the 24 astronauts who either landed or orbited the moon, the only people ever to walk on a separate terrestrial body. All of them are well into their seventies, but their exclusive memories appear clear and full of fascinating, often quite personal insights into what it was like.

Sington smartly eschews a straightforward timeline approach of the separate missions in favor of a holistic view of what it takes to get to the moon and then to return to Earth. By consolidating the men's comments into the discrete phases of a mission, he is able to elicit pertinent insights that reflect upon each another rather than a dryer historical record of their achievements. This is most definitely a film focused squarely on the human element in these risk-taking missions. Interspersed with their comments is a treasure trove of archival footage that looks amazingly fresh within this context. All the retired astronauts provide great stories and personal insights, although two stand out for me. One is Michael Collins, Apollo 11's Command Module Pilot, who is especially articulate and meditative in his recollections as the one in the orbiter as the other two were making history on the lunar surface. The other is the avuncular Alan Bean, Apollo 12's Lunar Module Pilot, whose Southern drawl and folksy charm bring a natural humor to his memories (It's not surprising to find out that he strayed the furthest from the space program after his mission and became a painter.)

Of the remaining fourteen astronauts, six have passed away, and the remaining eight were not available. The most conspicuous absentee is Collins' enigmatic crewmate Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, known to be hesitant about recognizing his place in human history. Complementing the interviews and archival footage is Philip Sheppard's stirring musical score, which punctuates the drama of the missions without overwhelming the visual aspect. Even though there are plenty of films about the real-life adventures of the space program - Philip Kaufman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Right-Stuff/dp/B000092T6N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Right Stuff</a>, Ron Howard's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apollo-13/dp/0783219695/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apollo 13</a>, the miniseries&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-the-Earth-to-the-Moon/dp/B000A0GYD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From the Earth to the Moon</a>&nbsp;co-produced by Howard and Tom Hanks, numerous IMAX features - this one is truly essential viewing for the simple reason that it captures the still-vivid memories of the surviving astronauts in an impeccably produced format. As an amusing denouement over the end credits, each of the interviewees comments on the conspiracy theories claiming the Apollo missions were all an elaborate government hoax.

The extras on the 2008 DVD also make for essential viewing. Given the film's 110-minute running time, much had to be left out, including fascinating thoughts on the political implications of the raging Cold War, the competitive heat generated from the Soviet Union's Sputnik program; Apollo's predecessor, Gemini; the importance of the Apollo 9 and 10 missions, and more personal memories. My favorite is Bean's hilarious recollection of a user manual attached to his spacesuit that was filled with pictures of Playboy bunnies. Separately, Buzz Aldrin facetiously admits that he may not have been the first man to walk on the moon, but he was the first to urinate there. Naturally, the audio commentary has to be comparatively less interesting, but Sington, along with film editor David Fairhead and archive producer Chris Riley, provide intriguing insight into their meticulous approach and staying true to the source material. There is an eleven-minute short, ""Scoring Apollo"", that goes into the making of Sheppard's music, as well as a six-minute interview with Ron Howard, who has no involvement in the film but feels passionate about its craftsmanship and emotional impact. The original theatrical trailer is also included.",1206144000,3,4848,5.638356164383562

3003123,5,B000XJ5TPE,"Of all mankind's technical achievements, none comes close to landing a man on the moon. This amazing British documentary, made by Apollo 13 director Ron Howard, takes us back 40 years to a time when the world watched in awe as Apollo 11 made that perilous journey to the moon. 'In the Shadow of the Moon' is a truly remarkable documentary, with the astronauts telling the story and superb NASA film from the moonshots bringing their words to life - back to life for those of us who watched it the first time. Like the 'Apollo 13' movie, Howard brings an unerring sense of confidence and suspense to his work. The descriptions and close-ups of the Apollo rocket lifting off are still some of the few truly sensational movie images available; Howard also gathers together the very best and most historic film shot on the moon.

Are you too young to have lived through it? See it for the first time and fly with the astronauts. Were you there when it happened? See it brought to vivid life as a piece of history more dramatic than fiction unfolds before you. And listen to the well chosen words of those walked on the moon, and saw our world with a different, more contented perspective.

Two tips. Watch it on the biggest screen you can. And read Andrew Smith's book 'Moondust' afterwards - it's the perfect accompaniment. True five star entertainment.",1205798400,10,1350,4.644351464435147

3003127,5,B000XJ5TPE,"The Apollo moon landings of the late 1960's and early 1970's have been the subject of countless documentaries over the nearly forty years since they occurred. Of all of them, only two films have captured the spirit of Apollo and of the men who took the journey. One of them is Al Reinert's 1989 masterpiece For All Mankind. The other is this film: In The Shadow Of The Moon. And this film easily rivals For All Mankind for the position of best Apollo documentary.

This film takes the idea behind For All Mankind and takes it to the next level. For All Mankind showed us the astronauts as they were then with narration from interviews. In The Shadow Of The Moon, as I wrote, goes the next step further. It shows the astronauts not only as they were, but as they are now. The difference is often times amazing. To go from young fighter pilot to being one of the few men to have left our planet must have been an amazing journey as the film shows and these men prove it. Like For All Mankind, their narration and appearances are the heart and soul of the story being told.

The body of the story is the footage. Where as For All Mankind brilliantly combined all the footage into one large mission, this film doesn't to a degree. It shows us highlights from the program including Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 and then makes a conscience effort not to confuse missions together. This allows for clarity that many have complained about being missing from For All Mankind. But this clarity also allows for something else as well. It allows for depth in story.

While the film is always the star of a DVD release, the special features on the DVD are also terrific. From Ron Howard's introduction to the audio commentary (which offers some insight on the footage and its source) to the featureate on Phillip Shepherd's score, one gets to feel the passion the filmmakers have for the subject and the film. They do what special features are supposed to do: offer a supplement to the film.

To be frank, In The Shadow Of The Moon is an amazing piece of work. Not since For All Mankind as a film of any size, shape, or form captured the spirit of Apollo. This is a film about a dream, the men who lived it, and its legacy not only for them but for us as well. I beg you to see this film. Only after that and viewing For All Mankind can one understand not only the legacy of Apollo but our need to explore Space.",1204502400,5,2393,4.358744394618834
3003128,4,B000XJ5TPE,"This is a very well-made, enjoyable and enlightening documentary about the Apollo Space program.  What makes it so watchable is the combination of breathtakingly beautiful footage from the launches and landings and of the moon and the earth from outer space with very intimate and revealing interview footage with the surviving astronauts.  Some of their observations and memories are quite funny, others thoughtful and challenging, and others contain hints of sadness.  It begins with John F. Kennedy's promise in 1961 that we would go to the moon before the decade was out, spends a lot of time on the first successful moon landing of Apollo 11 in 1969 and ends with the final mission of Apollo 17 in 1972.

There is very little here about the future of the space program or about subsequent NASA missions, or anything to address criticisms of the Apollo program.  Over the credits there are a few amusing clips from the astronauts' incredulous responses to the conspiracy theories that claim we never actually landed on the moon.  This is not, however, a puff piece -- the film does not shy away from presenting tragic mistakes and missteps in addition to the successes of the program.  One minor criticism is that while it is repeated several times in the film that the Apollo astronauts were on scientific missions, there is very little in the way of explaining what scientific benefits resulted from the program (apart from the development of the technology to get to the moon in the first place).  Still, that really would require a different film with a different focus.  The heart of this story is really the astronauts themselves, what their thoughts were upon entering the program and how they remember their experiences and how their perspective has changed as a result of having seen the earth from above.  On that subject, this makes for a very powerful and intriguing documentary, and I find it hard to imagine that anybody would not find it both entertaining and provocative.  I saw this first in a theater with my children, and all of them (with the exception of my 5 year old, who fell asleep in the theater but seemed to have been liking it to that point) loved it and found it to be a very engaging film. (The PG rating seems based on a few mild expletives, and the inclusion of a few historical references to some disturbing events such as the JFK assassination and the tragic accident during a simulated countdown on the first Apollo spacecraft).",1204416000,5,2468,4.797169811320755

They tell what it was like going to the moon. They share their sense of awe. They savored the beauty of the moon's desolation, yet understood it to be a hostile place. Death was inches away. There were some deep religious convictions as a result. They all returned with an appreciation of our fragile earth, a tiny oasis floating in the void. Fear was negligible, but Michael Collins was concerned whether Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin could fly the Eagle back to the command module after their stay on the moon's surface. These old guys have a sense of humor. Armstrong chose not to be in the film.",1204156800,2,773,4.649635036496351
3003150,5,B000XJ5TPE,"The best way to pay tribute to this film and the legacy of Apollo, is to buy an extra copy of this DVD and send it to our elected Representatives in Congress.  Enclose a note that says something like, ""PLEASE support NASA's plans for further exploration of the Moon and Mars by U.S. astronauts.  Let's return to the Moon as soon as possible, and establish a permanent lunar base, followed by a landing on Mars before the end of the next decade.  To help in the effort, I will gladly contribute to a special NASA R&D fund on my Federal tax return.""

It's been 38 years since the first lunar landing by the Eagle during the astonishingly successful mission of Apollo 11.  The last, Apollo 17, three and half years later, barely made the headlines.  There is so much more to learn about our Solar System and the Universe.  Why have we not progressed in all this time in our ability to explore the Moon, and what is stopping us from a manned expedition to Mars?

What great inspiration did we have back then during the Apollo era that we have somehow lost in the years since?  Are we no longer inspired to continue mankind's efforts to go where no man has gone before?  All it takes is the political will fueled by our national pride to lead the world in technological achievements.  We still have the best Engineers and Astronauts, and hundreds of thousands of aerospace workers ready to make it happen.  What we could achieve in another 38 years could be done in half that time with the resources we already have to take exploration of our solar system to the next logical step.  Yes, it will be costly, but no more so than the last several years protecting our oil interests in the Middle East.

Watch this DVD and find out from the pioneers of lunar exploration that so long ago demonstrated what it takes to have ""the right stuff"".  There are many, hundreds more, astronaut explorers ready and eager to continue where the Apollo astronauts left off beginning with further exploration of the Moon.

3003152,5,B000XJ5TPE,"""In the Shadow of the Moon"" is the story of the men who traveled to the moon and back 1968-1972, told in their own words and through archival footage of the Apollo space program, the lunar missions, and the world that watched as Neil Armstrong made ""one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"". This includes a history of the Apollo program as it tried to meet President Kennedy's Cold War challenge to put a man on the moon by the decade's end. But the film focuses on the Apollo 11 mission, the first to land on the moon, and succeeds in bringing the experiences of both the astronauts and the anxious public in 1968 in full force to modern audiences.

Like many adult Americans, I have seen more than a few documentaries about the Apollo program. But ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" takes a different approach. There is no narration. This is about the experience of traveling to the moon, as shared by the few living humans who did it. Retired astronauts Mike Collins, Buzz Aldrin, Alan Bean, Jim Lovell, Edgar Mitchell, Gene Cernan, Harrison Schmitt, John Young, Charlie Duke, and Dave Scott, now in their 70s, give us the blow-by-blow of what they did and how they felt as they risked their lives to further human achievement four decades ago. Insight and good humor are in abundance. I don't think these men have ever given public interviews this personal or detailed before. They make their experience accessible.

Director David Sington, with the help of editor David Fairhand and assistant director Chris Riley, has pieced interviews and archival footage together so that we grasp the experiences of the astronauts on their historic missions and the excitement of the folks who were watching back home. Though the film follows Apollo 11, other Apollo astronauts talk about their experiences at parallel points in their missions, so the film spans the entire Apollo program. Its troubles are discussed as well: the 1967 deaths of 3 astronauts and Apollo 13's narrow escape. My only criticism is that it isn't clear which astronauts were pilots vs scientists by profession or what their expertise were, as they all seemed to back up each other's missions in Mission Control.

The DVD (ThinkFilm 2008): You have the option of watching the movie with an introduction by Ron Howard (1 1/2 min), who promotes the film but had no part in making it. Bonus features include a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min), 18 Bonus Interviews & Stories, worthwhile if you want to hear more from the astronauts, a couple featurettes, and an audio commentary. ""Ron Howard: Inspired by Apollo"" (6 min) explains what attracted him to the film. ""Scoring Apollo"" (11 min) interviews composer Philip Sheppard about the music. The feature commentary is by director David Sington, editor David Fairhead, and archive producer Chris Riley. This is a constant and informative commentary which explains all of the archive footage and comments on that and on the film's themes.

3003153,5,B000XJ5TPE,"Admittedly, I walked into ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" with a bit of trepidation; it would seem that the NASA legacy has already been milked for all its worth, from a slew of hit feature films (""The Right Stuff"", ""Apollo 13"")and popular IMAX documentaries, to highly lauded TV fare (""From the Earth to the Moon"").

But somehow, director David Sington has managed to take this very familiar piece of 20th century history and infuse it with a sense of joyous rediscovery. In the process, it offers something rarer than hen's teeth these days-a reason to take pride in being an American.

The premise is simple enough; surviving members of the Apollo moon flights tell their stories, accompanied by astounding mission footage(some previously unseen). There are a few of the ""tumultuous 60s"" clichs tossed in (clips of student demonstrations, political assassinations, etc) but they remain onscreen just long enough to provide brief expository reference. The film is beautifully scored (Philip Sheppard) and edited (David Fairhead).

The term ""hero"" is glibly tossed about with reflexively wild abandon in our post 9-11 world; but as you listen to these astronauts recount their extraordinary experiences with such eloquence, fierce intelligence and self-effacing candor, you realize that these people truly do represent our best and our brightest, they are ""heroes"" in every sense of the word.

It's interesting to hear the astronauts expound on the pragmatic geo-political perspective that results from being in a position to ""blot the entire earth out with (your) thumb"", as one gentleman puts it. Several marvel at how truly fragile the Earth looks hanging ""like a jewel"" in the vast blackness of space; one interviewee ponders incredulously as to ""how we can worry more about paying three dollars for a gallon of gas"" than we do about attending to the health of the planet. I lost count of my ""amens"" halfway through the film.

This is also the first time (to my knowledge) that these men have been given a public forum to extrapolate at some length on the profound spiritual, metaphysical and philosophical questions that arise following such literally out of this world experiences as walking on the surface of another planet; it's fascinating and extremely moving at times.

""In the Shadow of the Moon"" is a perfect tonic for the Bush blues. It reminds us that there was a time not too far gone when the rest of the world looked to this country for inspiration; a time when people were NOT ashamed of hailing from the great state of Texas, because it was then better known as the home of Mission Control.",1203033600,7,2607,4.967889908256881
3003154,5,B000XJ5TPE,"By now we've taken the achievements of space for granted. In some ways our world, even our universe, has become smaller and bigger at the same time. What makes David Sington's `In the Shadow of the Moon' so wonderful is how it relaunches our awe for those incredible moments when a handful of men actually reached the moon. The film rekindles those memories when a few astronauts found themselves walking upon and discovering a completely different heavenly body as no time before or since.

Using '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Right-Stuff/dp/0790731541/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Right Stuff</a>' they interview several of the astronauts who reached--or nearly reached--the moon from 1968-1972; the documentary is mesmerizing for its close-up shots from liftoffs to moon landings. Interspersed are relaxed and frank discussions by the aging men who brought our native satellite back home to the whole world. Unsurprisingly, their memories are vivid and detailed. Surprisingly, there's so much more terrain covered on this endeavor than previous movie visits. Some of the documentary shows the world's reaction to those marvelous moments.

Too many details should never be divulged, for that's an insult to the heart. But in general terms, we get recollections of how these men reacted to their experiences. Without deception or evasion, they recall palpable danger at every turn and the inner workings of fear, awe, and decisiveness which met their challenges. Putting things in perspective, Michael Collins reflects that the moon looked like an ""inhospitable, hostile, scary, place"". Many anecdotes fill us in on the behind-the-scenes drama at NASA. Even the mundane details are fascinating.

There are many advantages to seeing this film in the theatre, but it's still great for home viewing, especially for those with HD or widescreens. The close-up shots are ample and sometimes vertiginous. Philip Sheppard's often changing and rapturous score works like Sington's directing and David Fairhead's editing to bring the glory of the past all back home.

Reaction can be like one astronaut who relates that his father was born just days after The Wright Brother's flight, and he reflects his father couldn't believe we were going to the moon, while his young son was far less impressed. Maybe like Apollo 11 itself, `In the Shadow of the Moon' can reunite everyone of every generation and renew their perspective on a breakthrough that we all too easily and too often dismiss as pass.

(Admirably, they keep the presentation tight, but the ""Bonus Features"" are excellent.  Even when they're not essential, they're always interesting.  There's over an hour of extra material [so it's not correct to say these are merely ""Deleted Scenes""].  Besides a short interview with Ron Howard, there's a twelve minute segment on Philip Sheppard's creation of his exquisite score and plenty of other anecdotes to spare.  Portions elaborate on the astronauts first role in The Cold War, and others continue to keep us marveling, especially Jim Lovell's testimony about the harrowing Apollo 13 journey.  There are plenty of fascinating features.)",1202947200,179,3182,5.462321792260693
3003155,5,B000XJ5TPE,"This is by far one of the most well-done, passionate, and emotional documentaries on the subject.  Despite its limited theater release, we were able to see it in a local theater, and never have I felt two hours go by so fast.

Far from the typical, boring documentary, the movie beautifully intertwines technical details of the Apollo missions with stunning footage and first-hand accounts from the astronauts.  One moving scene is the astronauts' response to the conspiracy theorists and critics claiming they never landed on the moon.

For those viewers with minimal knowledge about the space program, this is still easy and entertaining to watch.  The more knowledge a viewer brings to this film, the even better the experience will be.  The background music is also incredibly fitting and is a great contribution.  I look forward to buying this film as soon as it is released.",1202601600,5,880,4.986301369863014
3003156,5,B000XJ5TPE,"I thought this was an excellent documentary.  It features lots of rarely before seen archival footage of the program.  The interviews with the astronauts also do a great job in bringing out their personalities and let the viewer see that these are real people.  My main comment is that you'll get a lot more out of the film if you have at least a basic working  knowledge of the Apollo program (the film is only 100 minutes long, so they can only cover so much material).

I was also disappointed not to see Neil Armstrong interviewed for the film.

A great companion to this movie would be the book ""A Man on the Moon"" by Andrew Chaikin.",1202515200,9,638,4.410256410256411
3003157,5,B000XJ5TPE,"The new documentary about the push to land a man on the moon during the 1960's, ""In the Shadow of the Moon,"" does something that few movies I've seen the past few years dare to do:  It shows emotions like patriotism, faith, and brotherhood without sentimentality; it left me feeling proud of what we as a nation can accomplish.

Relying on the first person narration of the surviving Apollo astronauts (with the notable exception of Neil Armstrong), the voices relating the journey to the moon are humorous, intelligent, and at most times, touchingly humble.  (At one point in the film one of the astronauts, in his 70's now, grins like a little boy and says that whenever he looks up at the moon he can't help but shake his head and say, ""I was up there."")

""In the Shadow of the Moon"" uses remastered film and never before released shots of the space program and is dazzling to watch, but it's the voices of the men themselves which makes this such a compelling film.  At one point, Michael Collins relates how when he, Armstrong, and Aldrin returned from the first manned mission to land on the moon, people all over the world would greet them shouting ""We did it.""  It was truly a global accomplishment, one felt with pride by people around the planet, and ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" recaptures that feeling powerfully.",1202428800,9,1324,4.6127659574468085
3003158,5,B000XJ5TPE,"I saw Shadow at one of the special screenings for NASA employees, at Kennedy Space Center, and it was undoubtedly one of the most moving experiences I've ever had.

Before the movie, our Chief of Staff introduced it with a speech about how people wonder if our best days are behind us, if we're even capable of what we're planning, of reaching out and going to the moon again, to Mars, out to other places... he said that now we need to act to honour the legacy that the original astronauts left us, that he believes that we have what it takes, that everyone on-center is proud and has full faith in the NASA family as a whole. Everyone in the audience kind of sat up straighter, straightened their clothes, etc.

Post-movie, we all applauded and then just sat there silently. It was one of those moments of eerie solidarity that you just feel. Call it cheezie if you will, but it's feelings like that that give me faith in the whole thing. Hell, in the movie the astronauts mentioned the same things, that they knew they could rely on the work that each of us had done because we were all driven and all together.

It's that kind of feeling that will take us back to the moon.",1200009600,8,1177,4.365296803652968
3003159,5,B000XJ5TPE,"It makes such a refreshing change to see a documentary that is not out to make a scandal, reveal a conspiracy, or trick people into making fools of themselves.
This is a real treat, to watch a straightforward telling of the conquest of the moon, not from the technical perspective but from a very human perspective, using a combination of NASA photography, period newsreels, and most crucially, interviews with the surviving Apollo astronauts, with the exception of the notoriously reclusive Neil Armstrong.
There are no tricks being used here in the telling of the tales - just fantastic lingering shots of the moon as seen by the astronauts, and their very personal memories, told with candour and warmth.  We learn how human they felt - the `right stuff' persona is taken off for a moment, and we see just how in awe they were - and still are- of what they were part of.  This is all put in perspective of not just the space race of the 60's, but the Vietnam war which some felt guilty to be exempted from.
On a lighter note, we learn who was the first astronaut to pee on the moon, and the nervous moment when the moon land speed record was broken in the lunar buggy - at a breakneck speed of 18 kmh...
It's hard not to be a little moved by the stories being told, and the iconic shots of earthrise and the surface of the moon will blow you away, as the unhurried pace draws you through the events leading up to and during the landings.
Highly recommended.",1199836800,90,1460,4.4440298507462686
3003160,5,B000XJ5TPE,"This film is one of the best I've ever seen on Apollo.  It's all the astronnauts themselves telling the story of what it was like to go through this experience, illustrated by some of the cleanest and most unique clips you'll ever see.  One of my favorite bits - they've actually found footage shot of Charlie Duke at his workstation during the conversation he's having with Armstrong and Aldrin as they're landing - the famous ""bunch of guys down here turning blue"" bit.  You finally get to see the Mission Control guys finally exhaling!  Also, Buzz tells a very funny story about why he paused on the LEM ladder on his first stop down. . .

I saw the film twice, expecting to be bored the second pass through a documentary, but instead found myself even more intrigued and more interested.  Every space buff should have this, particularly if you want to nkow what it was like to be where these men stood.

I saw it twice and teared up both times.  I remember it like it happened yesterday, plus I have more fond memories since my dad has written his memories down to pass on to us.

It is a fantastic film.  You can get a documentary anywhere, this melds the human side with the facts to create the best ""moon"" film I have ever seen.

I saw a smaller doc called ""The Wonder on it All"" at the Newport Film Festival, and found it to be much more of an emotional experience.  I felt like I really got to know the first astronauts, where Shadows left me feeling a lot less of a complete experience.  If you are at all fan of the subject of the moon visits, make sure to see Wonder (not sure when it is out on DVD) and after that, Shadows will just leave you more hollow.",1197676800,24,603,3.958677685950413

I was stunned, although I lived through the experience having known most of the participants in Houston, TX., and felt that I knew ALL about it. It is as though all of these men, now of an advanced age, feel freed up to give us their very deep and real feelings on an unforgettable experience.  The thoughtful reminiscences of the 'Moon Walkers',and one Command Pilot on the Dark Side alone,Michael Collins, were unexpected, humorous, spiritual,and fascinating. Collins echoes his book, CARRYING THE FIRE, in his descriptions of the selection process, training, comments on his colleagues,and wry assessments of the whole process.

But there are 2 things that make this an absolute must-have.  First, much of this is footage that hasn't been seen since it was broadcast live.  Most documentary footage of the actual Apollo 11 landing, for example, has been cobbled together from existing Public Affairs releases, and some key moments of audio have been cut.  I remember when it happened, and this is the first time since that I've seen it as it was broadcast.  Second, this is probably the last time we'll get a retrospective from those few still alive who actually walked on the moon - not just romance and sea stories, but reflections on their shared experience, seen through a perspective that only comes with age and nearly 40 years' separation from the events.",1197504000,9,871,4.735099337748345

3003167,4,B000XJ5TPE,"This is probably the first and perhaps the last time that the Apollo moonwalkers will be interviewed about the deeply personal and overwhelmingly emotional side of their voyages to the Moon. ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" is NOT intended to be a techo-geek, nuts and bolts documentary about America's lunar flights from 1968 to 1972. If you want that...... there's many other excellent documentaries availiable that will fulfill that purpose. The wonderful thing about this movie is that for the first time, you get to see the Apollo astronauts let their hair down and share on camera their innermost emotional secrets and personal experiences from their trips to the Moon. Yes, many of the Apollo astronauts describe their flights as being a very spritual and perhaps a very ""religious"" experience. They tell you how it turned their lives upside down and tore some of their lives apart. A couple of them nearly went insane and couldn't cope with daily living after they came back to Earth. That's the simple fact of the matter it has every reason to be included in this film, whether you are a spiritual, religious person or not. You will hear the Apollo Astronauts confess personal anecdotes that you never heard from them previously..... just as if they were sitting in your own living room chatting with you about their lunar adventures.

It's that great, and will very likely be a staple of classrooms everywhere - the filmmaking is first-rate and is probably the best work of its kind. The historical value of this project can't be overestimated since most of those who walked on the Moon speak warmly in interviews (looking into the camera) of what it was like.

3237244,5,B000XJ5TPE,"During his State of the Union address in 1961 President John F. Kennedy challenged the nation, ""before this decade is out, to land a man on the Moon and return him safely to the Earth."" Despite all the turbulence of the 1960s (Vietnam, three assassinations, the civil rights movement, etc.), on July 20, 1969 Neil Armstrong stepped off his lunar module ladder and onto the moon --240,000 miles away--with the unforgettable words, ""that's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."" This remarkable documentary covers much but not all of the Apollo program, which ran from 1961 to 1975 and in six missions landed twelve people on the moon (the last in 1972 with Apollo 17). It focuses especially on the first lunar landing with Apollo 11, and the catastrophe of Apollo 1 and near-catastrophe of Apollo 13. In addition to the sheer magnitude of the scientific and technical feat, the film captures the deeply human drama, the truly global celebration, and even the spiritual impact that the lunar landings had on the astronauts. The film draws heavily upon NASA archival film footage, much of which has never been seen before, and reflections by all of the surviving astronauts, save the reclusive Neil Armstrong. This might be the best documentary film of 2007.",1190592000,14,1269,4.906976744186046
3237245,5,B000XJ5TPE,"""In the Shadow of the Moon"" is a documentary created by Ron Howard's Imagine Pictures, the group that made ""Apollo 13"". It combines documentary footage and on-camera interviews with most of the surviving Apollo astronauts, to tell the story of Apollo, and to give the astronauts a forum for reflecting on the experience of having been to the Moon.

The film is superbly put together, as you would expect. The archival footage is lovingly remastered, but the filmmakers resisted the temptation to tart it up: the scratches and, in one case, a clump of dust on the projector, are there for all to see. Most of the footage is familiar, but some I'd never seen before

Most of the surviving Apollo astronauts appear in the film; I missed only Fred Haise and Neil Armstrong. The astronauts' personalities come across very strongly - from taciturn John Young, to jolly Al Bean, to the introspective yet cocky Eugene Cernan. All of them have interesting things to say.

If you're not familiar with the Apollo program, or if you're a young woman or young man and all that Apollo stuff is something that your parents or grandparents natter about, you owe it to yourself to see ""In the Shadow of the Moon"". Project Apollo was something unique in all of human history, a very special moment in the life of our nation and of our species. NASA did a very difficult thing, and did it superbly well; but even more important, those 12 men who stood on another world and looked back on our Earth, have things to say that are interesting and enlightening and important.

If you're a fan of the Apollo program, ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" won't present much that is new. You've probably seen most of the archival footage already, and heard the astronauts say very similar things at one time or another. But Imagine has told that familiar story very well. And most importantly, the in-depth interviews with the astronauts give us an historical record of their thoughts as they approach the end of their lives. All of those men are in their 70s or 80s. Soon, they won't be with us any more. Their achievement will reside in the history books, distant, something experienced by someone else long ago. But thanks to films like this, those men will still be able to tell us and future generations what it was like and what it meant.

Some day, a man or woman - perhaps someone not yet born - will stand again at Tranquility Base. And when that happens, it will be thanks in large measure to artists like Ron Howard, who will have helped to keep the dream alive.

I decided I would give the film a shot, though space documentaries had never been a favorite of mine.  This amazing piece of historic documentation proceeded to blow all of my preconceived notions into pieces.  Not just in a filmic sense does this work break the mold, but in its ability to utterly recreate the American, and yes worldwide, pride that humanity possessed when the moonlanding occurred.  My heart was bursting and my eyes welled with happiness as I experienced the closest thing I had felt to patriotism in a very long time.  It was not strictly a red-white-blue patriotism, though it was certainly there, but rather a joy of being human.  It reminds us all of the hope we once had and lost.  It tells us to repossess that capacity for hope from the cynicism, the chaos, and the shattered illusions around us, and once more, reach for the stars.",1186790400,5,980,4.729411764705882
3237248,5,B000XJ5TPE,"I was fortunate to be invited to preview this film in April of 2007 while attending the International Space Symposium in Colorado Springs.  Buzz Aldrin, at age 77, flew in to introduce the film to an audience of space professionals involved with planning our manned mission to Mars.  Buzz is full of energy, sharp, creative, and humorous and still an avid champion of space exploration.  He is a true national treasure.
The film was remarkable!  It was full of personal and never before told stories shared by our first moonwalkers talking directly to the camera with no scripted questions...just personal moments of their unique experience in Space.  The film was entertaining, full of high quality film clips recorded years ago as historical documentation of astounding achievement.  The editing of this natural and unscripted story telling by each of our most memorable astronauts flowed so precisely that I forgot it was a documentary.  The high quality theatrical sound of firing red hot rocket thrusters and the sounds of fearful and critical life or death minutes at Mission Control had the audience gasping with relief when the exact moment of success and salvation for these dangerous missions were achieved.
I cannot say enough to convey the experience of this film.  We all left the theater realizing that the moon landings were the greatest achievements of the American spirit in the Twentieth Century.
I was 19 years young when I first felt the pride of our first moon landing.  I arrived home on leave from Marine Corps boot camp, at the peak of the Vietnam War, just an hour before Neil Armstrong stepped out of the Lunar Landing Module.  I have a photo of myself standing next to our television and still dressed in my uniform as I did not want to change clothes and miss a moment of that moon landing.  The live image of the moon landing can be seen clearly on the TV screen captured in my photo.  Unfortunately I will be 77 years old, at the earliest possible date, to feel that kind of national pride again....when we put our first team on the surface of Mars.  Our nation needs strong national leadership to make the first manned mission to Mars a reality...this film reminds us of all these things.",1185408000,30,2219,4.792650918635171

3237377,5,B000XJ5TPE,"I was inspired to post this review after watching the Blu-ray version of In the Shadow of the Moon.

On top of mesmerizing interviews that pack deep emotion, spectacular footage, and my tear-filled emotions reliving my awe and wonder at watching the Apollo 11 landing as a kid, this film provided a special gift that gives me goosebumps to think about.

Starting frame 1:11:49 there is a fast moving dust storm on the Moon's surface! It occurs immediately after Buzz Aldrin makes the following statement:

""Here we were, on the surface, and I knew this is what people were watching. More people were watching us than had ever watched two humans being before in history, and yet we're further away! Not just in distance, but in things we've got to do to get back home. We've got to do some difficult things to get out of this desolate place, and get back home again."" (Buzz Aldrin)

I'm providing this quote, because if my time of 1:11:49 is slightly different from your Blu-ray player (or perhaps different because you have a DVD player; I really don't know if the time is from the disc itself or a result of the Blu-ray software), you can locate the footage. The dust storm happens in the five seconds immediately following the above quote by Buzz Aldrin.

This dust storm is brief, just five seconds, but wow, it is FAST MOVING. I'm still frantically Googling lunar atmosphere and dust storms to try and make sense of what is shown in this original footage! It appears from my investigation it MIGHT be the result of charged dust. Moon conspiracy theorists, sorry to disappoint you, but this fast and rolling dust movement looks like a very scientific phenomenon that could NOT have been produced in a 1969 studio! This is definitely a real phenomenon, perhaps of charged dust particles perhaps interacting with gasses and solar radiation, or some other atmospheric disturbance. (Yes, the Moon does have a thin atmosphere.)

The Earth is at the top center of the frame, the American flag is at the bottom. To the upper left, a cloud of what looks like that fine lunar dust (that is almost like talcum powder) swirls quickly in a tumbling manner, until disappearing into the left of the frame. This happens over the course of five seconds, so you better have good rewind and freeze frame capabilities.

I'm watching it again, and just noticed starting at frame 1:11:59 through frame 1:12:02 (three seconds), as the camera is panning left, in almost the center of the frame, there is more dust movement that emerges quickly like a swirling vertical ""dust devil"" (like you see in the desert). Like the other dust movement, it has a ""white smoke"" effect, likely due to the fine powder on the lunar surface. I'm getting a sense that maybe there is more atmospheric activity on the lunar surface than meets the eye. Fascinating. I'll have to watch the entire video again more closely!

This was a major bonus for me, because it helps me understand the dynamics of the Moon's surface.

I highly recommend this video as awesome even without the dust storm, but for me, spectacular because that footage captured a phenomenon that, five seconds one way or another, would have been completely missed. I will see this video again, and if I catch anything else, I will update this review accordingly.

Updates:

The reason I ordinarily don't like Blu-ray is because (a) I cannot bookmark my place; and (b) when I stop it, there is no memory of where I left off, but on starting it again, I must remember where I left off (and fast forward to the place, or select the closest scene). This has been a major hassle. I always suspected the expertise of the Blu-ray disc creator determines if these basic bookmark and save features are activated by default (whereas with DVD, apparently the software used to generate the DVD by the manufacturer activates these features by default).

The good news is someone knew exactly what they were doing in mastering this Blu-ray disc, so that the bookmark and save where you left off features are activated by default! I absent-mindedly stopped the Blu-ray disc and removed it. Later when I popped it in, the disc immediately started where I left off. Then I realized ""isn't this a Blu-ray?"" and had to double-check the packaging. Then I noticed that I could create bookmarks, a feature normally not active with Blu-ray. Very nice.

The conspiracy theorists who believe we never went to the Moon are uneducated fools. I pity their lack of deductive reasoning skills, because they are living a lie. Advanced photography forensics software that is considered accurate as human DNA analysis in scientifically determining authenticity of photographs or videos of crimes -- as real or fake -- have conclusively authenticated NASA's lunar photographs and videos taken during the Apollo missions. (References: Google these keywords: photography forensics analysis moon landing.) The results of photography forensics software analysis is accepted by government security and law enforcement agencies worldwide in authenticating video or photographs containing individuals committing crimes whose attorneys may argue tampering of the photos or footage to ""frame"" their client. The analysis uses mathematics and physics to analyze shadows, pixels, and anomalies down to atomic granularity which could reveal forgeries. The Hasselblad cameras used during the Apollo mission were specifically designed to make forgery detection mechanically conclusive even in 1969, giving modern forensics textbook photographs and videos to test photography forensics analytics software. Hasselblad technology which produced scientifically accurate photos and videos decades ahead of its time, has driven the final nails in the coffins of conspiracy nuts claims the Apollo mission footage and everything photographed was filmed in a studio.",1383264000,,5835,5.034196891191709

If you love anything to do with The Space Race and those heroic men who flew machines out into the vastness of outer space, you will ADORE this movie!  By nature I am an emotional person.  The beauty of nature and the strength of the human spirit moves me.  The music that starts this film touched my heart so much that tears ran down my check just listening to Mike Collins and Charlie Duke. Truly the music is a character in and of itself.  This is one of the most artistic documentaries about the Apollo missions that I've seen (and I've seen almost every one made).  You are taken up close to these old men.  You are looking into their eyes and their very souls.  Then you see them as young vibrant men.  And you see how much they've changed...and how much they have not changed.  This documentary takes you into places in the hearts of these astronauts you might never go unless you knew them personally.  (The additional film and the commentary cut are must see pieces as well.) Astronaut Gene Cernan is one of my favorites (read his autobiography Last Man on the Moon for a great  read!) and listening to him open up so expressively touched my soul.  They all dug deep to give the viewers a huge piece of themselves.

Speaking as an astronomy buff, you won't learn much about how a rocket works or sciency things about the moon, etc. What you will get is a ton of awesome historical footage (ALL authentic from NASA) and 110 minutes of personal stories from the only men who ever walked on another world. When I say ""personal stories"" I mean what they were thinking when an alarm went off on Apollo 11, what they thought of their fellow astronauts, what it's like to be on the moon, the words of the president's pre-recorded speech that would air if the first men on the moon were unable to take off from the moon, who first urinated on the moon, and drawings their kids stowed away in their belongings on the rocket. The speakers are phenomenal.

It was about the same time we were preparing to launch the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) to the moon to prepare for future manned missions there. It was great to capture interviews with the Apollo astronauts while we have them with us. They are much older now, and with Neil Armstrong's recent passing, there will be less and less as time goes by. This is definitely a movie you can reminisce about the days of the late 1960' to early 1970's as the astronauts reflect about their voyages. Did they really land on the moon or was it a hoax.

3237433,3,B000XJ5TPE,"There is no 'meat' here......

Potential buyers should be aware that this film is essentially a collection of sentimental (and somewhat tired) piecemeal memories of a handful of astronauts in their twilight years. There is barely a hint of the mind-boggling technical and scientific obstacles that were confronted and overcome by legions of seriously gifted engineers and scientists. The fact that considerable 'filler' is devoted to re-looped footage of SaturnV rocket exhaust without the merest mention of the name of Wernher von Braun bespeaks itself of bias or triviality.....

Lest anyone think that `anti-space' sentiments are behind this criticism, let me say that I toured NASA facilities at the height of the space program, and stood downwind of a Saturn V during launch, and felt (and smelt) the indescribable power of it. No one in their right mind would make a documentary of the immense achievement of getting to the Moon without even a hint of the staggering technical challenges behind the development of even this titanic booster alone..... and similarly, all the other unmentioned heroes in the other disciplines whose creativity and persevering grit represent the real triumph of the Apollo program.

Nova's 'To the Moon"" of 1999 is still a vastly more impressive and informative documentary. On a more technical level, 'Moon Machines' is recommended.

PS. Some of the most interesting footage is in the Special Features...... probably not the best endorsement for the overall product.",1348444800,10,1503,5.302521008403361
3237434,5,B000XJ5TPE,"I watched this movie, twice, when it was in the theaters and wanted to see it again after Neil Armstrong's death. Awesome is not too strong a description for it. There is some science, a history of the project, and lots of amazing visuals, but the heart of the movie is the personal experiences of the men who traveled to the moon during the short window of time that the journey was deemed worthy of resources. All of those men are old now, but their memories are vivid. Watching In the Shadow of the Moon brings back the excitement of those Kennedy inspired Apollo missions, which spanned most of the socially turbulent 1960s, and makes me wish that space travel could still be on our national agenda. The moon landing was meant to one-up the Soviets, but at least for a while people all over the world felt connected to and enthusiastic about the achievement.

Neil Armstrong didn't seek celebrity after being the first person to walk on the moon, and he didn't participate in the making of this movie, but he's remembered with fond amazement by the other astronauts and is seen in old video footage. All of the astronauts that did participate had fascinating things to say about the moon landing program, but Mike Collins, who never actually got to the surface of the moon himself, stands out with witty down-to-earth insights and self-depreciating humor.",1347062400,3,1359,4.734177215189874

Ron Howard did a great job highlighting the past and including the passionate interviews with those on the Apollo missions. I showed the documentary to my 7th grade class, as a part of an Astronomy unit, and EVERY student paid attention and COMPLETELY enjoyed the documentary. On the last day of viewing, there was unanimous round of applause!! Great buy! Great price and timely delivery. :)",1338768000,,496,4.916666666666667
3237437,3,B000XJ5TPE,"First, the good:

A number of the surviving moon-traveling astronauts are interviewed. They are great on camera, adding information, humor and insight to what it was like to do what they did. Mike Collins in particular has an incredible sense of underplayed humor, in a very ""who, me?"" fashion... while at the same time being classy and informative. All the astronaut interviews were interesting and enjoyable to listen to.

While there wasn't a lot of mission footage, what there was of it was nice (would have preferred more).

Now, the bad:

I didn't buy this to get the usual ""social lecture"" about Vietnam War and Woodstock, etc... The director felt compelled to spend time on that, perhaps some people want or thrive on juxtaposing pictures of social unrest with the Apollo missions, but I'm not one of them. Way too many scenes of firebombing Vietnam. If I want a Vietnam War documentary, I'll buy one, thank you.

The interviews with the astronauts were completely jumbled together, mixed with mission footage. This left me constantly trying to figure out what footage was I seeing. Hypothetical example: they'd interview Mike Collins (Apollo 11), then show footage from Apollo 15, then interview John Young (Apollo 16), then show footage from Apollo 11. Seems like the only thing driving the order was ""artistic license"".

One goof: the film states after Apollo 13 there were 5 successful landings. Let's see, 14, 15, 16, 17. Any way I count it, that comes up as four.

One quibble: The director chose to zoom in very tight on the astronauts' faces for the interviews. On a big-screen TV set, you can count their skin pores. I don't personally like this ""up close and personal"" videography style, back off a little, at least where I can see the whole face at one time.

And, a truly poor finish... having the different astronauts comment on ""moon landing hoax"" theories. I know there's still some ignorant people that choose to believe that, but why include such nonsense in this video? Even in a ""refuting"" way, it's not worthy of being addressed. Perhaps we should have had them share their views on astrology or whether the earth is flat as well.",1338508800,33,2158,4.829268292682927

3237439,4,B000XJ5TPE,"A quick-hit recap of NASA's Apollo missions in the late '60s and early '70s, as remembered by eight of the men to actually reach the moon. Neil Armstrong's absence is conspicuous and disappointing, as his words upon first setting foot on the lunar surface have become so synonymous with the triumphs of the program, but his peers offer plenty of insight and more than a few fascinating tidbits about the hours leading up to their days in history. As always, the astronauts' testimony is honest and revealing - in their twilight years, these guys have nothing to hide - and proves just how risky the idea of space travel really was in that era. The archival footage of each mission is still amazing, beautiful, silencing material, but almost all of that has been seen ad infinitum by this point and the few scraps of unseen film that were dug up for the production aren't anything worth writing home about. It's a subject I'll never tire of, and hearing the story of its inception told from the men who lived it is a rare opportunity. I just wish it were more in-depth and probing, because in the end it's basically reshuffling a very familiar story in a slightly original way.",1331164800,,1176,4.631578947368421

3237441,5,B000XJ5TPE,"Made in the style of Band of Brothers (but without the use of any actors) this documentary film is both a record of historical importance and an overview of personal reflection on my part. I remember watching in awe as I'd get home from school and see a rocket blasting-off into space and men talking to 'mission control' and those beeps that made it all seem so technical. A time made for boys. Men escaping from the earth.

New for me since that youthful age is the deaths of the crew who never took-off. The fabled first earthrise photograph was also beyond my years but the beauty of it all struck me then as it does now. Power, raw awesome power so plainly visible is so magnetic to watch. Man riding a female rocketship 'they rode her to the moon' is the language of ultimate release. Away from it all.

Also apparent to me now is the importance of the personalities involved. Of course the ultra-cool Neil Armstrong gets the accolades for guiding the vehicle to landing and taking that first step on the moon but the characters of all the individuals made it all happen as much as the scientific and technical developments.

My fifty years on this planet have given me an appreciation of language which gets richer as I get older. Some of the astronauts make no apology for using Biblical language 'another heavenly body' in Armstrong's own pre-flight words, as well as an Old Testament quote used on that first mission to the moon (without landing on it). They also 'set sail for the moon' and most movingly describe a view of earth 'hung in the blackness of space.' And all agree that Neil Armstrong's immortal words as he took the first step away from our world as perfect for the moment and eternity: 'one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.'

I have visited Houston, seen the Apollo rocket lain serenely on its side and even 'mission control' monitoring satellites was entered and duly photographed back in the mid 1980s. It was the size that struck me - how small the crafts were! Though appreciating the enormity of the achievement and now understand a progression for me from viewing live as a boy, making Airfix models, seeing the real thing and now in the comfort of home re-living the triumph of human achievement. It is the ultimate travel experience. Exploration, extreme danger and deep personal development. Touching the stars. One step at a time.",1329091200,,2381,4.648456057007126

If you were there or not (I was not), this film does just an incredible job of captivating its watcher with the marvel of such a feat.  Beyond the summit of Everest, beyond the construction of the pyramids, this film represents the epitome of humankind.  In a time when nothing seems certain, when our country seems to have fallen from grace, this film serves as an excellent reminder of what made the United States what it is today.  I watched it today and I was proud to be an American.  The film has an excellent format that summarizes the Apollo space flights into a 1:40 minute movie.  Not every detail was hit upon, but overall it does a great job.  I was most impressed by the humanizing of the experience through the astronauts.  Hearing heartfelt, first-hand accounts of what it was like to be there, the thoughts and emotions, is both mesmerizing and confounding.  I couldn't imagine what such an event would be like, how it would change you.  As a professional pilot and an amateur astronomer, I was so glad to hear my thoughts reaffirmed towards the end of the film.  We live in the Garden of Eden.  I don't care if you buy into that mentality or not, it's just how I feel after studying the universe for several years.  In my opinion, this is a mandatory watch.

This is a movie about human beings, their need to explore the unknown, and their sense of place on earth, in space, and in the universe. Many of the astronauts talk with an almost religious overtone to their experiences in space, yet it is not religion as practiced on earth. It is more of a raw spiritual reflection that is powerful and thought-provoking. Whether a viewer was alive during the Apollo missions or has simply learned about the U.S. space program in school, there is much to learn from the astronauts reflections 40 years after their accomplishments. This is not Ron Howard in his classic masterful storytelling mode but rather Ron Howard masterfully facilitating all of the people who crafted the story themselves, from the astronauts to the people who spent so many hours in the archives to get just the right pieces of historical footage to complement the astronauts recollections.

I also learned, to my disappointment, that decisions made in Washington, D.C. have a profound effect on every program and often the effect is negative.  Many of the public outcries about unnecessary spending in both the defense and science and space programs are a direct result of the political decisions made by very uninformed elected officials.

We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.""

NASA was implementing plans to return to the moon until President Obama canceled the Constellation program and America's return to the moon.

Obama's NASA budget perfectly captures the difference in spirit between Kennedy's liberalism and Obama's.

1.  Just to correct a point made by many reviewers: Ron Howard did not make this film.  Kudos to the English director, David Sington, for this moving tribute.

2.  The music is superb.  Rarely can music said to be perfect.  It is, in this case.  Composer Sheppard's score is magnificent.",1291507200,3,388,4.6716417910447765

Being 13 when this occurred, this film just grabbed me on a gut level -- I cried almost the whole way through.  The individual astronauts accounts and feelings make it so much more than just a documentary.  The music also is so beautiful and touching.

I have been watching space documentaries for as long as they have been made and while this one differs by including some personal thoughts of the three astronauts, in particular, Michael Collins, whose excellent book ""Carrying The Fire"" I read some thirty years ago, there was little in the film that was worth the purchase price.

If you're interested in learning a few new facts up close and personal with these guys, who are still and always will be my heroes, rent this movie before buying it.

3237482,5,B000XJ5TPE,"Perhaps the best example of a BHAG (the term, ""Big Hairy Audacious Goal,"" was popularized by Jim Collins) is President John F. Kennedy's famous address to the U.S. Congress on May 25, 1961.  He inspired the nation with these words, ""First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.""

Kennedy didn't live to see that audacious dream realized, but on July 20, 1969, the whole world watched as Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon.  Since then ""put a man on the moon by 1970"" has inspired thousands of leaders to put a short-term target on the wall--and, in bold faith, blast off.  For faith-based organizations, I prefer the term ""Big Holy Audacious Goal.""

So I was energized once again with that profound BHAG while at a client's senior leaders retreat in the Colorado mountains recently.  One evening, we sat mesmerized by the stunning DVD, In the Shadow of the Moon, Ron Howard's documentary of the 12 American astronauts who walked on the moon between 1968 and 1972.

This extraordinary 110-minute film has teachable moments in almost every one of the 20 management buckets from my book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mastering-The-Management-Buckets-20-Critical-Competencies-for-Leading-Your-Business-or-Non-profit/dp/0830745947/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mastering The Management Buckets: 20 Critical Competencies for Leading Your Business or Non-profit</a>.  The Results Bucket: check.  The Strategy Bucket: bull's-eye.  The Systems Bucket: 15 astronauts owned 15 segments of the mission. The Crisis Bucket: ""Houston, we have a problem.""

The film is absolutely rich in memorable moments in the Team Bucket.  Then there's the People Bucket with often hilarious and poignant illustrations of the four social styles, including analyticals (Armstrong) and expressives (James Lovell).  This massive, visionary expedition would have failed miserably without monumental achievements in the Delegation Bucket.  There's a lot more.

Besides the exquisite cinematography and the dramatic explosions (they had lots of failures enroute to the BHAG), the insights shared by the aging and straight-talking astronauts (it was filmed in 2008) were remarkable, often funny and frequently breath-taking.

If your learning style is more listener than reader, you'll appreciate this DVD, which is perfect for a staff retreat, a staff training day, a department Hoopla! Bucket event, or even a Friday night at the movies family celebration at home. Enjoy, learn and be inspired!",1274400000,2,2633,5.730077120822622
3237483,5,B000XJ5TPE,"This engaging series of interviews with Apollo astronauts is the next best thing to sitting down with them in your living room. If you're interested in the Apollo missions at all, this is the best place to start, hearing about them directly from the men who flew the missions. They describe the complete program, from the X-15, through the gemini and mercury space programs, and finally the Apollo missions. These are not dry, boring interviews, but spoken with humor, wonder, and in the case of the deadly Apollo 1 fire, a lasting horror, grief and anger is still palpable in these astronauts as they discuss the details of the accident. If you want to meet real heroes, start here. Once you see this film and get to know the astronauts, any other movies will make much more sense.

For an entertaining semi-fictional movie about the Apollo-11 mission, I also highly recommend The Dish, about the Parkes Observatory Antenna in Australia, during the Apollo 11 moon mission. Parkes relayed the first TV images from the moon to the world, and is still in operation today. The ensemble cast does a great job, bringing a warm human touch to what is usually considered a dry, dull footnote in history. Having lived through those days, I can say the film is idealized a bit, but is not far off from what that time was really like.

3237488,5,B000XJ5TPE,"'In The Shadow Of The Moon' is the best documentary on the Apollo program that I have ever seen. It combines actual footage from the Apollo missions with interviews with many of the Apollo astronauts.

The Apollo footage is amazing. (I was confused by the description that said 'Full Frame' on the back of the box; I soon found out that the interviews are in wide-screen but the footage is full screen). On a HD television it feels like you are almost there (though the movie is not in HD, the DVD is very high quality).

The beauty of this film is not just in the footage but in the insight the Astronauts give. They talk about the missions, their thoughts and fears, and more importantly their hopes. Jim Lovell remarked that from the moon you can hide the entire earth behind the tip of your thumb - all your problems, worries, friends, family, businesses, etc - all behind your thumb. Basically saying that all of our petty disagreements should be overshadowed by the fact that we are very unique and very fortunate to be able to live on this utopia. Other astronauts commented on their own epiphanies as well.

Philip Sheppard composed the music for this documentary...I went out and bought the album soon after I viewed the movie....This is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard.

Along with the film comes a slew of special features: An hour of out-takes, full movie commentary (very insightful to film buffs and space buffs), a feature on how the music was made for the film, etc, etc...

'In The Shadow Of The Moon' should be required viewing in all public/private schools. It is not just a documentary on the NASA moon missions but a movie about how unique and precious the planet earth is and how fortunate we are to live on it.

Alan Bean is perhaps the most entertaining commentator. He spoke candidly of being afraid, and of realizing that death exists outside the capsule. Were the window to pop out, he would be dead in a second. Buzz Aldrin spoke not of fear of the flight itself, but a constant worry that something could go wrong, after which there definitely would be something to be afraid of. Lovell spoke of conquering his emotions after the Apollo 13 emergency situation first hit.  Buzz Aldrin spoke of the lifelong challenge of living up to his reputation as a moon-conqueror. Gene Cernan and Charles Duke spoke of spiritual and religious experiences after their flights. Duke became a born-again believer in Christ.

A segment is shown of Walter Cronkite's reporting of the Apollo 11 flight, and his emotional reaction when Eagle touched down on the moon. There are also clips shown of 1960's events, such as the JFK speech that started the race to the moon, the race riots, the Vietnam War and the antiwar movement, etc. Some of the astronauts note that their colleagues were in Vietnam, and they would've been also had they not been astronauts. Michael Collins commented on a speech that President Nixon was to give had the astronauts been stranded on the moon: ""Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin know that there is no hope for their recovery, but they also know that they have brought the world together.""

3237512,5,B000XJ5TPE,"Words almost fail me in trying to describe how good, and more so, important this historical document really is. This was a very rare appearance of every living astronaut who walked on the surface of the Moon (with the notable absence of the first, Neil Armstrong) including Gene Cernan,  Jack Schmitt, John Young, Charlie Duke, Dave Scott,  Ed Mitchell, Alan Bean and Buzz Aldrin. In addition, Jim Lovell, the only man to travel twice to the Moon without landing (Cernan and Young also went twice) as well as Apollo 11 Command Module Pilot Mike Collins appears as well. They give a very human description of what they experienced and felt about their history-making experiences.
It is important to remember these men were educated to be pilots of high performance aircraft in addition to engineering, astronautics and computer science.  People like this frequently are not good at communicating with those who are not like minded but it is interesting that most of these men were able to be able to express their very intimate feelings about what they experienced.
A few comments:
First of all the restoration of the films from the 1960's and 1970's was absolutely amazing. The colors are fresh and sharp. It looks like it was filmed yesterday. Prior to this, NASA films tended to be of pretty poor quality.
Secondly, I am disappointed that Neil Armstrong did not appear. I realize that before he flew the mission he studied how Charles Lindbergh dealt with fame, ending up with the tragedy of having his baby son kidnapped and murdered, plus disgracing his reputation by associating himself with racist and antisemitic movements. Armstrong felt that he had to make a choice between becoming a known public figure or keeping out of sight, so he chose the second because the first had too many dangers associated with it. I guess that if he had to be one or the other, he made the right decision, but I think a rare document like this deserved his participation.
Third, I am somewhat disappointed that John Young did not appear more. He is actually the most accomplished astronaut of the Mercury-Germin-Apollo-Space Shuttle era, having piloted every type of American spacecraft except for Mercury. Everyone says he has a brilliant engineering mind, and not only that, but he also mastered the lunar geology, unlike other Apollo astronauts, and did a masterful scientific job on Apollo 16 but as I pointed out before, he probably doesn't communicate as well as the others to the general public.
I also would have liked to hear more from Dave Scott. His gigantic contribution to Apollo was his understanding the importance of the scientific work, going beyong the ""gee-whiz"" aspects of the first landings, and he also did outstanding scientific work in Apollo 15, the first to use the Lunar Rover which allowed for far more geological work to be done on the missions.
I would have liked to seen more of the work that was done on the Lunar surface by the astronauts and what they thought of this aspect of the missions, but there is little of this. Most of the program dealt with the problems of getting to the Moon and then back home, but I just can't enough of the scenes on the surface. As I said above, these restored films are so much clearer than the old NASA films so I would have liked to see more.
Finally during the rolling of the ending credits, it was decided to have several of the men refuting the idiotic conspiracy theories claiming the landings were faked (odd how the USSR, which bitterly opposed the US at the time due to Cold War tensions never made such a claim!). I believe that this was not necessary, merely dignifying those unscrupulous people who peddle this nonsense.
Having said all this, I think every one in the United States , and then everyone else around the world should see this film and realize what great things can be accomplished by many people working together as a team. The only comparable recent historical event that was like this was the victory by the Allies in the Second World War, but the difference being that Apollo was done in the name of peace.",1242604800,,4093,4.745786516853933

3237537,5,B000XJ5TPE,"This documentary by Ron Howard was a wonderful tribute to the men who made the Moon landings. This is a great complement to documentaries that primarily focus on the technical aspects of the US Space program, this documentary presented the human side of how the Apollo astronauts felt as they flew into history. I was moved by many of the profound insights made by the astronauts' own comments about their hopes, concerns, and fears. It is clear that what these men experienced during the Moon missions is still having a profound affect on their lives today.",1229558400,,558,4.822916666666667
3237538,5,B000XJ5TPE,"I have a clear and vivid memory of Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon because my brother made sure I would.
I was seven years old at the time. My brother, Daryl, a decade older than me, said, ""You have to watch this and remember this. This is history."" So I watched closely and made sure to remember; as did billions of other people around the world on July 21, 1969.
That wonderful historical moment and the hard work that led up to it is beautifully captured in the new documentary, In the Shadow of the Moon. Directed by David Sington, this film understandably won the audience prize at the Sundance Film Festival because it leaves viewers cheered and inspired.
It was rather astonishing to hear in the film President John F. Kennedy propose, almost promise, that America would be on the moon by the end of the decade. He acknowledges that the technology, and even some of the metal alloys, had not yet been developed, but assures the nation that these things will be discovered, and the job will be done.
It made me think of Proverbs 29:18 - ""Without a vision, the people perish"" (KJV). The sixties were a difficult time in the US -- war, assassinations, social upheaval - but the space program provided a vision of accomplishing great things.
God knows that we need big dreams. It can be too easy to become consumed by the petty details of life -- household chores, meeting budgets, running errands - which must be dealt with, but we can not believe those details are life. We need to be reminded that there are bigger things to be accomplished.
If you are a part of a church, you need to deal with the painting, the carpet and the tile. These are all good things. But you need to be dreaming about bigger things. Some scoffed at JFK's goal to reach the moon in less than a decade. It seemed impossible. But it could not have happened if it hadn't been proposed.
Congregations need to dream big dreams. Could we have a thousand people in our congregation? Could we support a Spanish language congregation that would be healthy and strong? Could we double, triple, quadruple our missions budget? Great things cannot happen without a great vision. And God's vision is greater than our own.
The heart of the film is the interviews with the Apollo astronauts. Most of these men are in their seventies, before long many of these men will be gone. So it is valuable to record their unique experiences.
Neil Armstrong, noted for his reclusive nature, is not interviewed, but he is well represented in news reel footage and the anecdotes of other astronauts. Armstrong's crew mates, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, provide a fascinating picture of that first moon landing and the experience of being truly alone in space (though Collins says he never felt lonely).
An interesting coda in the end credits is a response of the astronauts to those who say that there was no moon landing, that it was all a hoax (a la Capricorn One). They scoff at the scoffers, postulating that such a lie could not have been kept quiet by so many people. One of the astronauts (John Young?) wonders why, if it was a fraud, they had to make so many fraudulent trips.
(Not mentioned in the film, the incident of Buzz Aldrin punching a moon launch skeptic in the nose. The punchee sued Aldrin, but the judge quickly threw the case out of court. This led one wag to say that Buzz Aldrin is the only person of whom it can be said that walking on the moon is the second coolest thing he ever did. Not that I would ever advocate such violence.)
Another astronaut notes that around any great historical event, conspiracy theories will abound. There are people who believe that the German Holocaust of the Jews never happened or that planes couldn't have taken down the World Trade Centers. No amount of evidence will convince these people otherwise.
Jesus recognized the stubborn nature of people. He performed miracle after miracle and yet most people of His time still doubted him. But He knew that skepticism would persist even after His resurrection. In the parable of Lazarus and the rich man he said, ""If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead."" (Luke 16:31, NIV) There is vast evidence that the Bible is a reliable historical document, that Jesus was raised from the dead and that the world was created with intelligent design. But doubt will persist because admitting these truths would mean changing one's life.
It was interesting that toward the end of the film several of the astronauts confess that being in space made them consider the magnificence of the earth and space and the necessity of believing in a Creator. In fact, Charlie Duke in the film tells about how shortly after his trip to the moon he received Christ as his Lord and Savior. He says that though his trip to the moon was a great three day adventure, his adventure with God is forever.
It is unlikely that any of us will be able to walk on the moon any time soon. But we will all be able to have the adventure of walking with God.",1227916800,2,5057,4.570484581497797
3237539,5,B000XJ5TPE,"""In the Shadow of the Moon"" is a first rate film that highlights the national effort to put a man on the moon before the end of the decade of the 1960's.  It chronicles the early failures and the few successes as NASA experimented with rockets.  Using interviews with the surviving astronauts and archival film footage, much of which has never been seen before, the film follows the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs.  It is a captivating film and the interviews with the astronauts, a risky venture since it had the potential to be boring and self-serving, is actually extremely interesting, funny, and heart-warming.  I first saw this film at the RiverRun International Film Festival in Winston-Salem, NC and the film's director and producer were on hand.  Strangely enough, they were British filmmakers who were interested in the race to the moon and gained unheard of access to NASA's film footage and access to the astronauts who were so willing to tell the true story behind mankind's greatest voyages.  The film was later bought by Ron Howard for its theatrical release but, other than giving himself production credit at the beginning of the movie, Ron changed nothing in the film (a wise move on his part).  I highly recommend this film to anyone with a remote interest in the space program, in American history, and who would simply just like to be entertained and/or remember back to a time when the whole world looked up with wonder and amazement.",1227484800,,1461,4.843373493975903

He said that it was very accurate and that it gives so much ""behind the scenes"" information.  He wanted our whole family to watch it because it helped us understand the work that he did while at NASA.  If you have an older family member who worked for NASA or followed the space program closely, this will make a great gift!",1227052800,2,477,4.266666666666667
3237542,4,B000XJ5TPE,"This documentary had some fantastic footage in it, and featured a very personal look at many of the astronauts who went to the moon. Overall, that is a very exclusive club: only about a dozen men ever did it in the history of the world and just eight or nine ever stepped foot on it. Most of them are still alive and they discuss their adventures, insights and personal feelings here.

One gets the feeling that the rest of us will never know exactly how beautiful the moon is except to take the astronauts' words about it, because even the pictures on this DVD can't convey that. It just looks dull and gray, but the men say it was spectacular. I believe them.

Since this documentary is about 100 minutes long, you get a lot of information. You also get reminded how close two of the three men who went up on that historic first walk on the moon came to not making it home alive.

A glaring absence in this documentary - through no fault of the film-makers, is the most famous astronaut of them all: Neil Armstrong, the first man to step foot on the moon! Apparently, he did not want to be part of this film. One of the astronauts, near the very end of this documentary, mentions something briefly about Armstrong being somewhat of a ""recluse"" now and it ""being understandable with what he's gone through."" From what I've read, a lot of people have tried to make money off him in shady ways and so now he's withdrawn from the public spotlight. Still, not having his thoughts on this historic mission is a real loss to this film and makes this story seem incomplete.

After a slow first half hour, this really picks up when we travel along with Armstrong's Apollo 11 crew. Seeing slow-motion pictures of the lift-off and great shots of the earth are just awesome. The worldwide reaction to the success of this mission will bring a tear or two to your eyes.

This film, a legacy to the Apollo program and the brave men who ran it, should be in every schoolroom. It would make history a lot more interesting to students.",1226707200,3,2019,4.431266846361186

3237547,5,B000XJ5TPE,"In the shadow of the moon is an accomplishment in that it holds one's attention even if one knows the outcome of the story.  This always struck me as one of the great attributes of Ron Howard's ""Apollo 13"" in that we all knew what happened, to varying degrees of specificiality, and yet it was still dramatic and compelling.  ""In The Shadow of the Moon"" accomplishes much the same in more of a documentary way.  The film is compelling and captivating and not just because of the story that is and was the Apollo program.  A film of this sorts runs the huge risk of being cheesy and over stated.  It also runs the risk of telling nothing new other than the facts, most of which those who would see the film would know.  Instead ""In the Shadow"" tells the basic story for those who do not know the history of Apollo, and yet gives Apollophiles something satisfying.  For me it was the perspective that comes with distance in time. We are now almost 40 years since ""we"" went to the moon, and the power the experience had for those who went, magnifying the memories for those of us who watched and remember, speaks of the greatness of the endeavor.  All of the astronauts were changed for their going.  I remember the crew of Apollo 12, if my memory is correct, speaking about when one ""returned from the moon,"" not physically but emotionally, as being the time when one didn't think about the experience.  Judging from ""In the Shadow,"" most or all of the astronauts never fully returned.  Even as they traveled, explored, and brought back rocks and soil, they seemed to leave a part of themselves behind. ""In the Shadow"" opens the window into how the men were changed in the accomplishing of this great feat and in so doing, tells how humanity was changed now that we live in a time when humanity went to the moon.",1221004800,,1810,4.47112462006079

I think it is so wonderful that all of the men that went to the moon are still living and could provide this insightful information.  Please watch this, you won't be disappointed.",1220659200,2,513,4.3125
3237549,4,B000XJ5TPE,"""Awesome"" and ""awe inspiring"" have become hackneyed clichs, but they truly apply in the case of this riveting documentary.  ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" chronicles the Apollo space program, which audaciously planned to land a man on the moon within a 7-8 year time frame.  We now all know they succeeded but it is easy to forget or take for granted the enormity - and dangers - of the task set before us.  America galvanized behind John F. Kennedy's goal to land a man on the moon before the end of the 1960's decade.

The film is a blend of ""talking heads"" from various ex-astronauts, now clearly in the twilight of their lives, and documentary footage from the 1960's.  As the Eagle spacecraft lands in July 1969 and Neal Armstrong sets foot on the lunar surface, it's hard not to tear up in pride, in pride for what America was able to accomplish.  You see how the entire world rejoiced in this triumph and identified with it, hearkening to  time when it seemed that everyone else in the world did not hate  or resent Americans.

Another undercurrent is the spiritual epiphany that the moon trips induced in many of the astronauts.  The view of the bejeweled earth from outer space gave some of them a new sense of wonder, awe, belief in God and a vision of stewardship over our planet.

A gaping omission is the absence of any comments from Neal Armstrong, who apparently is a committed recluse.

The notion of watching a documentary about the Apollo Space program may sounds as dull as reading transcripts of the Federal Reserve Board, but I assure you, you will NEVER be bored!",1220227200,6,1582,4.570921985815603
3237550,5,B000XJ5TPE,"This is an incredible documentary about true American heroes, a time when we dreamed, and a true story about going to the moon simply because we believed we could do it.  Well written, directed and produced this movie has amazing footage that tickles the imagination.  The backdrop for this drama was the cold war, Vietnam and  a country going through major growing pains.  The US space program was frequently the one bright unwavering beacon of hope through the turbulent 60s and early 70s.

In all the time that we have been on the earth with over 6 billion alive today and many more billion who have lived, we have only put 12 humans on another world.  It gives goose bumps to think about what these men have seen and done.

I have met very fortunate to meet several of these men in person.  Each one is different and yet they all share great desires, passions and dreams. Their commitment to excellence is unquestionable. Today, excellence still exists, but it isn't respected like it was then.  We can learn much from this movie and these amazing human beings.

""In the Shadow of the Moon"" displays terrifically digitized NASA films--more brilliant than I've seen before--as well as commentary from the aging veteran astronauts who flew the missions to the moon. Curiously missing, however, is the reclusive Neil Armstrong (who appears in ""When We Left Earth""). It's no big deal, though, as the others take up the slack. Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin, and Alan Bean are particularly entertaining. Jim Lovell, Gene Cernan, Edgar Mitchell, Dave Scott, John Young, Harrison Schmitt, and Charlie Duke (who, as Apollo 11's capcom, offers valuable insight into that mission) round out this brilliant crew of space veterans.

John Young, Edgar Mitchell and David Scott also evoke emotional responses but in a vastly more subtle and understated manner.  I could have done without Aldrin and Cernan, both of who continue to exhibit tremendous self-regard all these decades.

In 1961 the Russians officially launched the space race by launching the first human into orbit soon followed by a 15 minute manned flight by the U.S. The newly elected president of the United States, John F. Kennedy laid down the gauntlet by challenging our country to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade, at that time a more than ambitious (some thought impossible) goal. This film is the story, in the APOLLO astronaut's own words and incredible archival footage of how the U.S. became the first to land on the moon. As Roger Ebert says, we tend to focus on the accomplishment and not on the journey. This is about the journey as well as the incredible achievement. The clips, many seen on film for the first time, especially those walking on the moon's surface, are spectacular. This is a story that should be seen by everyone, especially those who did not grow up in the sixties. We may have forgotten that the first three astronauts were killed in a fire on the launchpad that could have stopped the whole mission dead in its tracks. These are the only men in the history of our planet who have seen earth from another celestial location. One final note. This was an achievement that united, literally the whole world. As the astronauts traveled the world afterwards, they were struck by the fact that everywhere, people referred to the achievement as 'WE' did it, not you did it. It was something that everyone was proud of, regardless of their country. How different that seems from the world culture today. Is there anything we could conquer today that could unite the world into saying WE did it. You will not be disappointed in watching this great film. [...].",1213401600,3,1874,4.563798219584569

3237570,5,B000XJ5TPE,"This excellent and exciting documentary traces the growth of America's Apollo space program, from its early inception until the last manned moon mission in 1972.

Before his assassination, President Kennedy challenged Americans to put a man on the moon and bring him home safely.  Few realistically thought that this lofty goal could be achieved, but the people at NASA embraced this challenge and worked tirelessly to make it reality.  America was also in a space race with the Soviets, and they had already put a man in orbit.  America needed a response from its own program; something that the Soviets could never hope to match.  Apollo was that response.

The DVD begins with the selection of the original Apollo astronauts.  These men, in the words of one of them, went from ordinary pilots to heroes literally overnight.  The Gemini program put the first American into space, but the goal was still to reach the moon.  The first Apollo spacecraft, Apollo 1, suffered a tragic fire during testing, and all three astronauts aboard were killed.  Many of the other astronauts openly wondered if this would be the end of the program; it was not.  Training continued in preparation for landing on the moon.  Apollo 8, piloted by Jim Lovell, orbited only 60 miles above the lunar surface but did not land.

The stage was now set for Apollo 11, set to lift off in July, 1969.  Two other crews were also training simultaneously.  The entire world watched as Apollo 11 lifted off in the July heat and began its historic voyage.  After three days, the crew of three was ready to land on the moon.  The DVD has footage of Walter Cronkite describing the landing as well as a professional baseball game being interrupted to let the crowd know about the historic event.  Neil Armstrong descended down the nine steps from the lunar lander and uttered his famous ""One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"" sentence.

The fateful mission of Apollo 13 is also described in the documentary.  Again, Jim Lovell was in command of the mission.  This time, however, disaster struck.  An accident occurred when the oxygen tanks were stirred, causing a terrific explosion which crippled the spacecraft.  Many thought that the astronauts would not make it back, but the men at NASA never waivered in their belief. Despite overwhelming odds, the people at mission control were able to bring the astronauts back safely.

This is simply an awesome documentary.  Only 12 American men have walked upon the the surface of the moon, and they remain the only human beings to have stood on another world.  Many of the astronauts who flew on the lunar missions have been interviewed for this documentary, and their stories and insight put the viewer right on the moon with them.  The actual footage from the missions is included as well.  I was only 4 years old when Apollo 11 landed on the moon, so I have very little recollection of the actual experience.  But this great documentary brings everything back as if it happened only yesterday.  I plan to show this DVD to my three young children so they can experience what the children of the 60s were able to see.

I give this DVD my highest recommendation.  12 have been there; will there ever be another?",1212105600,2,3236,4.764388489208633

3237572,5,B000XJ5TPE,"I'm a space nut. So, at first, I'm thinking, ""This is pretty familiar stuff.""

I had often imagined what liftoff felt like, but then I heard astronauts describe it. Mike Collins: ""I'd describe it as a nervous novice driving a wide car down a narrow alley. You know, you've gotta make corrections. You're not quite sure. You zig this way, and I mean... and what it is, is those big motors underneath, gimbaling, you know, swiveling back and forth to keep you in balance ... and the gimbaling of the motors, you feel in the seat of your pants. And, thinking, 'Gee, that launch tower is just a few feet off to one side. I hope this sucker isn't gonna gimbal over in that direction too much.'""

I thought I knew all about the 1202 and 1201 computer alarms that almost aborted the first moon landing. The on-board computers were overloaded. I knew why mission controllers said, ""We're go on that."" But I never knew how the computers got overloaded until Buzz Aldrin explained it in this film: ""Being Dr. Rendezvous, no matter what the checklist said, I was gonna leave the rendezvous radar on and active... So the landing radar is feeding information, the rendezvous radar is, and evidently that combination was not anticipated by the guys at MIT.""

The astronaut interviews pull you into the experience of going to the moon -- and more importantly, of returning safely to the earth. Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean:

""Since that time, I have not complained about the weather one single time. I'm glad there is weather. I've not complained about traffic. I'm glad there's people around. One of the things that I did when I got home, I went down to shopping centers, and I'd just go around there, get an ice cream cone or somethin', and just watch the people go by, and think: 'Boy, we're lucky to be here. Why do people complain about the earth? We are living in the Garden of Eden.'""

I'm a DVD nut, too. I tend to listen to all the commentary tracks, and watch all the extra features. Even if you don't do that, on this DVD, be sure to watch the ""Bonus Interviews & Stories"" in ""Special Features."" It's about an hour of additional material that was cut from the movie, and it's solid gold.

Excellent movie. Excellent DVD.",1211155200,10,2217,4.557788944723618

While all of the astronauts who contributed interview time do a great job, I think Michael Collins of Apollo 11 brings the most interesting and human view to this great adventure.

3237574,5,B000XJ5TPE,"""In the Shadow of the Moon"" is one of the best documentaries ever made about the space program. Masterfully combining vintage footage with new interviews with Apollo astronauts, the filmmakers deftly explore the history of the lunar program, focusing on Apollo 11, but giving appropriate coverage to other significant events (Apollo 8, Apollo 13, the value of the lunar rover on later missions, etc.) as well.

I had seen most of the vintage footage before, although the filmmakers found some fantastic archival footage of the astronauts (including some great pre-Apollo footage). The difference in this project was the dexterity that the clips were woven together with: it is a clearly superior effort, and one of the best documentaries I have seen.

As wonderful as it is to see the footage from Apollo, the best part of the film is by far the insightful interviews with the Apollo survivors (sans the stoic and reclusive Neil Armstrong). The filmmakers spent two days with each of the astronauts interviewed, giving them a great deal of material to edit, and to say that the finished product is masterful is an understatement. I was especially fond of the interviews with Mike Collins and Alan Bean, and I loved the contrasts between the personality types involved. If anyone needed proof that John Young is one of the most laconic, yet witty, astronauts in NASA history, the proof is here. Likewise, Buzz Aldrin still comes across as the hyper-intelligent ""Dr. Rendezvous"", though more relaxed with age. All the astronauts are clearly very bright, keenly insightful, and give perspectives that are extremely interesting from the vantage point of almost 40 years of reflection: I was especially taken by Bean's comments that he hasn't complained once about the weather since he returned to earth. This and the other insights from Bean late in the film are golden.

The film has many extras including unused scenes, and a fascinating commentary track: I highly recommend all the extras. The film is nearly perfect, and provides both those very familiar with spaceflight and more casual viewers information through clever editing, interview footage, and occasional captions, including translations of sometimes difficult to understand exchanges between the spacecraft and Houston. The film is meticulous in accuracy, and an explanation of all footage substitutions are thoroughly explained in the commentary. So devoted to accuracy is the film that I noted only one extremely minor error in the film, when the term ""REFSMMAT"" was translated as ""azimuth"" in a caption. (This, obviously, has no value to viewers.) For a documentary of this scope and complexity, that is an amazing achievement.

I highly recommend ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" to everyone, and I thank the makers of this brilliant film for bringing it to us, and I thank the astronauts for participating in this truly worthwhile endeavor.",1211068800,11,2902,5.154989384288747

That said, I watched this video after I had watched the Apollo 13 DVD, the one with real life dialog with Gene Krantz and Jim Lovell.

The music is beautiful and really adds to the experience.

Overall, my favorite NASA dvd is the Nova ""To The Moon"", but this might overtake that.  Very heartfelt.  I now love Michael Collins, almost as much as my hero, Jim Lovell. The only negative thing about this dvd is the glaring non-participation of Neil Armstrong.  Why he wouldn't want to be part of this amazing project is a mimystery.

I have to say that they must have seen ""For All Mankind""
that came out years ago and i feel they have added to that great doco
the joy of what happened as unreal as it does seem from our time
is something that never leaves me
When i look at the moon with my 4 year old son and say people
have been there and he looks at me and says can we go to
and i can say yes yes we can go
I think its fantastic that the one thing the Americans did
back then still shines out saying look where we have gone.
And where can we go
They were the first and only people to see the earth from a distance
sure they are all white American males but to hear how it feels
from that distance for them regardless of where they came from

The music alone is truly memorable,understated but emotionally powerful. The fact that these missions,all of them,were successful in the technical sense by bringing all of the Apollo astronauts back home safely is a magnificent human achievement and ushered in the technological developments of the 1970's.

The accompanying materials are beautiful, I'd just like to point out two footages - one is a very long S-IVB staging footage with Earth horizon coming into the empty S-II cameras view (I never saw THIS that long) and the second one is - at least for me - absolute rarity. In Special Features section dealing with Gemini program there is a few seconds b/w shot of both John Young and Michael Collins inside the Gemini 10 capsule, both are spacesuited. I never ever saw the Gemini 10 interior footage before. To be sure I stopped the film several times to check my identification and it is beyond any doubt it's really very rare Gemini 10 interior footage.

3237598,5,B000XJ5TPE,"Hopefully you've seen ""Apollo 13"" and the ""From The Earth To The Moon"" series.  Now, see the real men behind the space helmets and learn more than ever what it was like to fly to the moon.  You simply won't believe how ""human"" these now aging astronauts are - how emotional their storytelling is, how grateful they are for having the opportunity, and how descriptive they are in their personal recollections.  This is not a film about patriotism or the United States vs. the U.S.S.R.  It is a film about the human spirit and the wonder of exploring space, the moon, and the unknown.  I am touched by each of the astronauts as they tell their stories and I'm sure you will be as well.

What's great about this film is how beautifully it was put together.  It's a wonderful mix of footage from the missions (which looks better than ever) and interviews with the astronauts as they tell their stories. A terrific surprise is the musical score which in a word, is perfect.  If you're a fan of Horner's score for ""Apollo 13"" you will definitely love this music.

Do yourself a favor and add this dvd to your library.  You won't be sorry.

One side note - The additional interviews with the astronauts in the special features section are great.  Each man goes into a bit more detail into some of the other happenings of not only the Apollo program, but Gemini as well.  My only beef with these extra interviews is that the video/picture did not get the same treatment as the film.  It doesn't look like the editors did any color correcting so don't fret if all the sudden Charlie Duke looks really bright and washed out and Dave Scott looks like he's sitting in a dark room.

The behind the scenes section on the creation of the musical score is lots of fun.  It was great to see how the wonderful orchestrations were composed.",1207180800,3,1821,4.48936170212766

3237601,5,B000XJ5TPE,"Many of us have seen various programs and documentaries on the Apollo program, but there is something different about ""In the Shadow of the Moon"".  Juxtaposing film of the 30-something test-pilots turned astronauts, with the nearing 80 year olds now reflecting back puts a new perspective on Apollo.  Michael Collins' and Alan Bean's reflections are quite folksy.  Edgar Mitchell and Gene Cernan share the spiritual impact their missions had on them.

It is especially interesting to compare Jim Lovell relating the story of an atheist suing NASA over Apollo 8's crew reciting Genesis on Christmas Eve (on man's first journey beyond Earth orbit), to Cernan's realization upon looking up at Earth that God was bigger than religion (on man's last journey beyond Earth orbit).  The spiritual impact of traveling so far from Earth cannot be discounted.  Edgar Mitchell similarly shares a deeply personal spiritual experience.  Also poignant is John Young's comment after observing the changes in pollution in the Earth's atmosphere over his 20 years of spaceflights to people's seemingly petty concern over $3 a gallon gasoline.

The style is fairly typical of modern documentaries.  Silent close ups of now wrinkled faces combine with the astronauts' voice overs of documentary footage humanize these men.  No longer supermen, shown on TV and traveling the world, now they are ordinary men with extraordinary stories.  Who will carry the fire once they are gone?

Simply put, 24 men have traveled beyond Earth orbit.  Only they have seen the Earth as a full orb in space.  Six of those men have passed away.  The remaining grow old.  This is chance to hear them speak about how they played a part in history, and how it affected them.  It is not to be missed.",1206835200,2,1756,5.02076124567474

While it includes some breathtaking never-before-seen footage from NASA, it features the astronauts talking about what it felt like to walk on the moon, what it was like emotionally and physically during their experiences.

The astronauts themselves tell the story in their own words, and there's no CGI or special effects -- it's all genuine NASA footage.  The story is by turns moving, poignant, thrilling, and (with the Apollo 1 fire) tragic, and it will have you on the edge of your chair for two full hours.

3237616,5,B000XJ5TPE,"This may be the only DVD I've purchased that offers deleted scenes that are just as good as the final film. In fact, there is nearly an hour's worth of unused footage offered as a bonus feature, and your interest in seeing these eighteen clips will depend on how much nostalgia you feel for the space race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union that lasted from 1957 until the early 1970's. Spurred on by John F. Kennedy's commitment for us to land a man on the moon before the end of the 1960's, NASA developed the Apollo program, which is the focus of this superbly produced 2007 film. British documentarian David Sington was able to record on-camera interviews with ten of the 24 astronauts who either landed or orbited the moon, the only people ever to walk on a separate terrestrial body. All of them are well into their seventies, but their exclusive memories appear clear and full of fascinating, often quite personal insights into what it was like.

Sington smartly eschews a straightforward timeline approach of the separate missions in favor of a holistic view of what it takes to get to the moon and then to return to Earth. By consolidating the men's comments into the discrete phases of a mission, he is able to elicit pertinent insights that reflect upon each another rather than a dryer historical record of their achievements. This is most definitely a film focused squarely on the human element in these risk-taking missions. Interspersed with their comments is a treasure trove of archival footage that looks amazingly fresh within this context. All the retired astronauts provide great stories and personal insights, although two stand out for me. One is Michael Collins, Apollo 11's Command Module Pilot, who is especially articulate and meditative in his recollections as the one in the orbiter as the other two were making history on the lunar surface. The other is the avuncular Alan Bean, Apollo 12's Lunar Module Pilot, whose Southern drawl and folksy charm bring a natural humor to his memories (It's not surprising to find out that he strayed the furthest from the space program after his mission and became a painter.)

Of the remaining fourteen astronauts, six have passed away, and the remaining eight were not available. The most conspicuous absentee is Collins' enigmatic crewmate Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, known to be hesitant about recognizing his place in human history. Complementing the interviews and archival footage is Philip Sheppard's stirring musical score, which punctuates the drama of the missions without overwhelming the visual aspect. Even though there are plenty of films about the real-life adventures of the space program - Philip Kaufman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Right-Stuff/dp/B000092T6N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Right Stuff</a>, Ron Howard's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apollo-13/dp/0783219695/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apollo 13</a>, the miniseries&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-the-Earth-to-the-Moon/dp/B000A0GYD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From the Earth to the Moon</a>&nbsp;co-produced by Howard and Tom Hanks, numerous IMAX features - this one is truly essential viewing for the simple reason that it captures the still-vivid memories of the surviving astronauts in an impeccably produced format. As an amusing denouement over the end credits, each of the interviewees comments on the conspiracy theories claiming the Apollo missions were all an elaborate government hoax.

The extras on the 2008 DVD also make for essential viewing. Given the film's 110-minute running time, much had to be left out, including fascinating thoughts on the political implications of the raging Cold War, the competitive heat generated from the Soviet Union's Sputnik program; Apollo's predecessor, Gemini; the importance of the Apollo 9 and 10 missions, and more personal memories. My favorite is Bean's hilarious recollection of a user manual attached to his spacesuit that was filled with pictures of Playboy bunnies. Separately, Buzz Aldrin facetiously admits that he may not have been the first man to walk on the moon, but he was the first to urinate there. Naturally, the audio commentary has to be comparatively less interesting, but Sington, along with film editor David Fairhead and archive producer Chris Riley, provide intriguing insight into their meticulous approach and staying true to the source material. There is an eleven-minute short, ""Scoring Apollo"", that goes into the making of Sheppard's music, as well as a six-minute interview with Ron Howard, who has no involvement in the film but feels passionate about its craftsmanship and emotional impact.

3237620,5,B000XJ5TPE,"Of all mankind's technical achievements, none comes close to landing a man on the moon. This amazing British documentary, made by Apollo 13 director Ron Howard, takes us back 40 years to a time when the world watched in awe as Apollo 11 made that perilous journey to the moon. 'In the Shadow of the Moon' is a truly remarkable documentary, with the astronauts telling the story and superb NASA film from the moonshots bringing their words to life - back to life for those of us who watched it the first time. Like the 'Apollo 13' movie, Howard brings an unerring sense of confidence and suspense to his work. The descriptions and close-ups of the Apollo rocket lifting off are still some of the few truly sensational movie images available; Howard also gathers together the very best and most historic film shot on the moon.

Are you too young to have lived through it? See it for the first time and fly with the astronauts. Were you there when it happened? See it brought to vivid life as a piece of history more dramatic than fiction unfolds before you. And listen to the well chosen words of those walked on the moon, and saw our world with a different, more contented perspective.

3237624,5,B000XJ5TPE,"The Apollo moon landings of the late 1960's and early 1970's have been the subject of countless documentaries over the nearly forty years since they occurred. Of all of them, only two films have captured the spirit of Apollo and of the men who took the journey. One of them is Al Reinert's 1989 masterpiece For All Mankind. The other is this film: In The Shadow Of The Moon. And this film easily rivals For All Mankind for the position of best Apollo documentary.

This film takes the idea behind For All Mankind and takes it to the next level. For All Mankind showed us the astronauts as they were then with narration from interviews. In The Shadow Of The Moon, as I wrote, goes the next step further. It shows the astronauts not only as they were, but as they are now. The difference is often times amazing. To go from young fighter pilot to being one of the few men to have left our planet must have been an amazing journey as the film shows and these men prove it. Like For All Mankind, their narration and appearances are the heart and soul of the story being told.

The body of the story is the footage. Where as For All Mankind brilliantly combined all the footage into one large mission, this film doesn't to a degree. It shows us highlights from the program including Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 and then makes a conscience effort not to confuse missions together. This allows for clarity that many have complained about being missing from For All Mankind. But this clarity also allows for something else as well. It allows for depth in story.

While the film is always the star of a DVD release, the special features on the DVD are also terrific. From Ron Howard's introduction to the audio commentary (which offers some insight on the footage and its source) to the featureate on Phillip Shepherd's score, one gets to feel the passion the filmmakers have for the subject and the film. They do what special features are supposed to do: offer a supplement to the film.

To be frank, In The Shadow Of The Moon is an amazing piece of work. Not since For All Mankind as a film of any size, shape, or form captured the spirit of Apollo. This is a film about a dream, the men who lived it, and its legacy not only for them but for us as well. I beg you to see this film. Only after that and viewing For All Mankind can one understand not only the legacy of Apollo but our need to explore Space.",1204502400,5,2393,4.358744394618834
3237625,4,B000XJ5TPE,"This is a very well-made, enjoyable and enlightening documentary about the Apollo Space program.  What makes it so watchable is the combination of breathtakingly beautiful footage from the launches and landings and of the moon and the earth from outer space with very intimate and revealing interview footage with the surviving astronauts.  Some of their observations and memories are quite funny, others thoughtful and challenging, and others contain hints of sadness.  It begins with John F. Kennedy's promise in 1961 that we would go to the moon before the decade was out, spends a lot of time on the first successful moon landing of Apollo 11 in 1969 and ends with the final mission of Apollo 17 in 1972.

There is very little here about the future of the space program or about subsequent NASA missions, or anything to address criticisms of the Apollo program.  Over the credits there are a few amusing clips from the astronauts' incredulous responses to the conspiracy theories that claim we never actually landed on the moon.  This is not, however, a puff piece -- the film does not shy away from presenting tragic mistakes and missteps in addition to the successes of the program.  One minor criticism is that while it is repeated several times in the film that the Apollo astronauts were on scientific missions, there is very little in the way of explaining what scientific benefits resulted from the program (apart from the development of the technology to get to the moon in the first place).  Still, that really would require a different film with a different focus.  The heart of this story is really the astronauts themselves, what their thoughts were upon entering the program and how they remember their experiences and how their perspective has changed as a result of having seen the earth from above.  On that subject, this makes for a very powerful and intriguing documentary, and I find it hard to imagine that anybody would not find it both entertaining and provocative.  I saw this first in a theater with my children, and all of them (with the exception of my 5 year old, who fell asleep in the theater but seemed to have been liking it to that point) loved it and found it to be a very engaging film. (The PG rating seems based on a few mild expletives, and the inclusion of a few historical references to some disturbing events such as the JFK assassination and the tragic accident during a simulated countdown on the first Apollo spacecraft).",1204416000,5,2468,4.797169811320755
3237646,5,B000XJ5TPE,"Michael and I saw this documentary about the Apollo program. The surviving astronauts, in their 70s, speak their minds. This is the first time they seemed like real people. They tell what it was like going to the moon. They share their sense of awe. They savored the beauty of the moon's desolation, yet understood it to be a hostile place. Death was inches away. There were some deep religious convictions as a result. They all returned with an appreciation of our fragile earth, a tiny oasis floating in the void. Fear was negligible, but Michael Collins was concerned whether Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin could fly the Eagle back to the command module after their stay on the moon's surface. These old guys have a sense of humor. Armstrong chose not to be in the film.",1204156800,2,773,4.649635036496351
3237647,5,B000XJ5TPE,"The best way to pay tribute to this film and the legacy of Apollo, is to buy an extra copy of this DVD and send it to our elected Representatives in Congress.  Enclose a note that says something like, ""PLEASE support NASA's plans for further exploration of the Moon and Mars by U.S. astronauts.  Let's return to the Moon as soon as possible, and establish a permanent lunar base, followed by a landing on Mars before the end of the next decade.  To help in the effort, I will gladly contribute to a special NASA R&D fund on my Federal tax return.""

It's been 38 years since the first lunar landing by the Eagle during the astonishingly successful mission of Apollo 11.  The last, Apollo 17, three and half years later, barely made the headlines.  There is so much more to learn about our Solar System and the Universe.  Why have we not progressed in all this time in our ability to explore the Moon, and what is stopping us from a manned expedition to Mars?

What great inspiration did we have back then during the Apollo era that we have somehow lost in the years since?  Are we no longer inspired to continue mankind's efforts to go where no man has gone before?  All it takes is the political will fueled by our national pride to lead the world in technological achievements.  We still have the best Engineers and Astronauts, and hundreds of thousands of aerospace workers ready to make it happen.  What we could achieve in another 38 years could be done in half that time with the resources we already have to take exploration of our solar system to the next logical step.  Yes, it will be costly, but no more so than the last several years protecting our oil interests in the Middle East.

Watch this DVD and find out from the pioneers of lunar exploration that so long ago demonstrated what it takes to have ""the right stuff"".  There are many, hundreds more, astronaut explorers ready and eager to continue where the Apollo astronauts left off beginning with further exploration of the Moon.  The time has come again to take the ""next"" small step for man, but a giant leap for mankind.",1203724800,2,2091,4.506631299734748

Even though this is only a standard DVD, it plays and looks like and HD DVD.  The directing and interviews in this film are top-notch.  The DVD also includes and additional hour of interviews so you'll get 2 1/2 hours of priceless material on Apollo.  Highly recommended.  Price is unbeatable too.",1203379200,15,433,4.706666666666667
3237649,5,B000XJ5TPE,"""In the Shadow of the Moon"" is the story of the men who traveled to the moon and back 1968-1972, told in their own words and through archival footage of the Apollo space program, the lunar missions, and the world that watched as Neil Armstrong made ""one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"". This includes a history of the Apollo program as it tried to meet President Kennedy's Cold War challenge to put a man on the moon by the decade's end. But the film focuses on the Apollo 11 mission, the first to land on the moon, and succeeds in bringing the experiences of both the astronauts and the anxious public in 1968 in full force to modern audiences.

Like many adult Americans, I have seen more than a few documentaries about the Apollo program. But ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" takes a different approach. There is no narration. This is about the experience of traveling to the moon, as shared by the few living humans who did it. Retired astronauts Mike Collins, Buzz Aldrin, Alan Bean, Jim Lovell, Edgar Mitchell, Gene Cernan, Harrison Schmitt, John Young, Charlie Duke, and Dave Scott, now in their 70s, give us the blow-by-blow of what they did and how they felt as they risked their lives to further human achievement four decades ago. Insight and good humor are in abundance. I don't think these men have ever given public interviews this personal or detailed before. They make their experience accessible.

Director David Sington, with the help of editor David Fairhand and assistant director Chris Riley, has pieced interviews and archival footage together so that we grasp the experiences of the astronauts on their historic missions and the excitement of the folks who were watching back home. Though the film follows Apollo 11, other Apollo astronauts talk about their experiences at parallel points in their missions, so the film spans the entire Apollo program. Its troubles are discussed as well: the 1967 deaths of 3 astronauts and Apollo 13's narrow escape. My only criticism is that it isn't clear which astronauts were pilots vs scientists by profession or what their expertise were, as they all seemed to back up each other's missions in Mission Control.

The DVD (ThinkFilm 2008): You have the option of watching the movie with an introduction by Ron Howard (1 1/2 min), who promotes the film but had no part in making it. Bonus features include a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min), 18 Bonus Interviews & Stories, worthwhile if you want to hear more from the astronauts, a couple featurettes, and an audio commentary. ""Ron Howard: Inspired by Apollo"" (6 min) explains what attracted him to the film. ""Scoring Apollo"" (11 min) interviews composer Philip Sheppard about the music. The feature commentary is by director David Sington, editor David Fairhead, and archive producer Chris Riley. This is a constant and informative commentary which explains all of the archive footage and comments on that and on the film's themes. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.",1203120000,4,3017,4.865758754863813
3237650,5,B000XJ5TPE,"Admittedly, I walked into ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" with a bit of trepidation; it would seem that the NASA legacy has already been milked for all its worth, from a slew of hit feature films (""The Right Stuff"", ""Apollo 13"")and popular IMAX documentaries, to highly lauded TV fare (""From the Earth to the Moon"").

But somehow, director David Sington has managed to take this very familiar piece of 20th century history and infuse it with a sense of joyous rediscovery. In the process, it offers something rarer than hen's teeth these days-a reason to take pride in being an American.

The premise is simple enough; surviving members of the Apollo moon flights tell their stories, accompanied by astounding mission footage(some previously unseen). There are a few of the ""tumultuous 60s"" clichs tossed in (clips of student demonstrations, political assassinations, etc) but they remain onscreen just long enough to provide brief expository reference. The film is beautifully scored (Philip Sheppard) and edited (David Fairhead).

The term ""hero"" is glibly tossed about with reflexively wild abandon in our post 9-11 world; but as you listen to these astronauts recount their extraordinary experiences with such eloquence, fierce intelligence and self-effacing candor, you realize that these people truly do represent our best and our brightest, they are ""heroes"" in every sense of the word.

It's interesting to hear the astronauts expound on the pragmatic geo-political perspective that results from being in a position to ""blot the entire earth out with (your) thumb"", as one gentleman puts it. Several marvel at how truly fragile the Earth looks hanging ""like a jewel"" in the vast blackness of space; one interviewee ponders incredulously as to ""how we can worry more about paying three dollars for a gallon of gas"" than we do about attending to the health of the planet. I lost count of my ""amens"" halfway through the film.

This is also the first time (to my knowledge) that these men have been given a public forum to extrapolate at some length on the profound spiritual, metaphysical and philosophical questions that arise following such literally out of this world experiences as walking on the surface of another planet; it's fascinating and extremely moving at times.

""In the Shadow of the Moon"" is a perfect tonic for the Bush blues. It reminds us that there was a time not too far gone when the rest of the world looked to this country for inspiration; a time when people were NOT ashamed of hailing from the great state of Texas, because it was then better known as the home of Mission Control.",1203033600,7,2607,4.967889908256881
3237651,5,B000XJ5TPE,"By now we've taken the achievements of space for granted. In some ways our world, even our universe, has become smaller and bigger at the same time. What makes David Sington's `In the Shadow of the Moon' so wonderful is how it relaunches our awe for those incredible moments when a handful of men actually reached the moon. The film rekindles those memories when a few astronauts found themselves walking upon and discovering a completely different heavenly body as no time before or since.

Using '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Right-Stuff/dp/0790731541/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Right Stuff</a>' they interview several of the astronauts who reached--or nearly reached--the moon from 1968-1972; the documentary is mesmerizing for its close-up shots from liftoffs to moon landings. Interspersed are relaxed and frank discussions by the aging men who brought our native satellite back home to the whole world. Unsurprisingly, their memories are vivid and detailed. Surprisingly, there's so much more terrain covered on this endeavor than previous movie visits. Some of the documentary shows the world's reaction to those marvelous moments.

Too many details should never be divulged, for that's an insult to the heart. But in general terms, we get recollections of how these men reacted to their experiences. Without deception or evasion, they recall palpable danger at every turn and the inner workings of fear, awe, and decisiveness which met their challenges. Putting things in perspective, Michael Collins reflects that the moon looked like an ""inhospitable, hostile, scary, place"". Many anecdotes fill us in on the behind-the-scenes drama at NASA. Even the mundane details are fascinating.

There are many advantages to seeing this film in the theatre, but it's still great for home viewing, especially for those with HD or widescreens. The close-up shots are ample and sometimes vertiginous. Philip Sheppard's often changing and rapturous score works like Sington's directing and David Fairhead's editing to bring the glory of the past all back home.

Reaction can be like one astronaut who relates that his father was born just days after The Wright Brother's flight, and he reflects his father couldn't believe we were going to the moon, while his young son was far less impressed. Maybe like Apollo 11 itself, `In the Shadow of the Moon' can reunite everyone of every generation and renew their perspective on a breakthrough that we all too easily and too often dismiss as pass.

(Admirably, they keep the presentation tight, but the ""Bonus Features"" are excellent.  Even when they're not essential, they're always interesting.  There's over an hour of extra material [so it's not correct to say these are merely ""Deleted Scenes""].  Besides a short interview with Ron Howard, there's a twelve minute segment on Philip Sheppard's creation of his exquisite score and plenty of other anecdotes to spare.  Portions elaborate on the astronauts first role in The Cold War, and others continue to keep us marveling, especially Jim Lovell's testimony about the harrowing Apollo 13 journey.  There are plenty of fascinating features.)",1202947200,179,3182,5.462321792260693
3237652,5,B000XJ5TPE,"This is by far one of the most well-done, passionate, and emotional documentaries on the subject.  Despite its limited theater release, we were able to see it in a local theater, and never have I felt two hours go by so fast.

Far from the typical, boring documentary, the movie beautifully intertwines technical details of the Apollo missions with stunning footage and first-hand accounts from the astronauts.  One moving scene is the astronauts' response to the conspiracy theorists and critics claiming they never landed on the moon.

For those viewers with minimal knowledge about the space program, this is still easy and entertaining to watch.  The more knowledge a viewer brings to this film, the even better the experience will be.  The background music is also incredibly fitting and is a great contribution.  I look forward to buying this film as soon as it is released.",1202601600,5,880,4.986301369863014
3237653,5,B000XJ5TPE,"I thought this was an excellent documentary.  It features lots of rarely before seen archival footage of the program.  The interviews with the astronauts also do a great job in bringing out their personalities and let the viewer see that these are real people.  My main comment is that you'll get a lot more out of the film if you have at least a basic working  knowledge of the Apollo program (the film is only 100 minutes long, so they can only cover so much material).

I was also disappointed not to see Neil Armstrong interviewed for the film.

A great companion to this movie would be the book ""A Man on the Moon"" by Andrew Chaikin.",1202515200,9,638,4.410256410256411
3237654,5,B000XJ5TPE,"The new documentary about the push to land a man on the moon during the 1960's, ""In the Shadow of the Moon,"" does something that few movies I've seen the past few years dare to do:  It shows emotions like patriotism, faith, and brotherhood without sentimentality; it left me feeling proud of what we as a nation can accomplish.

Relying on the first person narration of the surviving Apollo astronauts (with the notable exception of Neil Armstrong), the voices relating the journey to the moon are humorous, intelligent, and at most times, touchingly humble.  (At one point in the film one of the astronauts, in his 70's now, grins like a little boy and says that whenever he looks up at the moon he can't help but shake his head and say, ""I was up there."")

""In the Shadow of the Moon"" uses remastered film and never before released shots of the space program and is dazzling to watch, but it's the voices of the men themselves which makes this such a compelling film.  At one point, Michael Collins relates how when he, Armstrong, and Aldrin returned from the first manned mission to land on the moon, people all over the world would greet them shouting ""We did it.""  It was truly a global accomplishment, one felt with pride by people around the planet, and ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" recaptures that feeling powerfully.",1202428800,9,1324,4.6127659574468085
3237655,5,B000XJ5TPE,"I saw Shadow at one of the special screenings for NASA employees, at Kennedy Space Center, and it was undoubtedly one of the most moving experiences I've ever had.

Before the movie, our Chief of Staff introduced it with a speech about how people wonder if our best days are behind us, if we're even capable of what we're planning, of reaching out and going to the moon again, to Mars, out to other places... he said that now we need to act to honour the legacy that the original astronauts left us, that he believes that we have what it takes, that everyone on-center is proud and has full faith in the NASA family as a whole. Everyone in the audience kind of sat up straighter, straightened their clothes, etc.

Post-movie, we all applauded and then just sat there silently. It was one of those moments of eerie solidarity that you just feel. Call it cheezie if you will, but it's feelings like that that give me faith in the whole thing. Hell, in the movie the astronauts mentioned the same things, that they knew they could rely on the work that each of us had done because we were all driven and all together.

It's that kind of feeling that will take us back to the moon.",1200009600,8,1177,4.365296803652968
3237656,5,B000XJ5TPE,"It makes such a refreshing change to see a documentary that is not out to make a scandal, reveal a conspiracy, or trick people into making fools of themselves.
This is a real treat, to watch a straightforward telling of the conquest of the moon, not from the technical perspective but from a very human perspective, using a combination of NASA photography, period newsreels, and most crucially, interviews with the surviving Apollo astronauts, with the exception of the notoriously reclusive Neil Armstrong.
There are no tricks being used here in the telling of the tales - just fantastic lingering shots of the moon as seen by the astronauts, and their very personal memories, told with candour and warmth.  We learn how human they felt - the `right stuff' persona is taken off for a moment, and we see just how in awe they were - and still are- of what they were part of.  This is all put in perspective of not just the space race of the 60's, but the Vietnam war which some felt guilty to be exempted from.
On a lighter note, we learn who was the first astronaut to pee on the moon, and the nervous moment when the moon land speed record was broken in the lunar buggy - at a breakneck speed of 18 kmh...
It's hard not to be a little moved by the stories being told, and the iconic shots of earthrise and the surface of the moon will blow you away, as the unhurried pace draws you through the events leading up to and during the landings.

3237657,5,B000XJ5TPE,"This film is one of the best I've ever seen on Apollo.  It's all the astronnauts themselves telling the story of what it was like to go through this experience, illustrated by some of the cleanest and most unique clips you'll ever see.  One of my favorite bits - they've actually found footage shot of Charlie Duke at his workstation during the conversation he's having with Armstrong and Aldrin as they're landing - the famous ""bunch of guys down here turning blue"" bit.  You finally get to see the Mission Control guys finally exhaling!  Also, Buzz tells a very funny story about why he paused on the LEM ladder on his first stop down. . .

I felt like I really got to know the first astronauts, where Shadows left me feeling a lot less of a complete experience.

I was stunned, although I lived through the experience having known most of the participants in Houston, TX., and felt that I knew ALL about it. It is as though all of these men, now of an advanced age, feel freed up to give us their very deep and real feelings on an unforgettable experience.  The thoughtful reminiscences of the 'Moon Walkers',and one Command Pilot on the Dark Side alone,Michael Collins, were unexpected, humorous, spiritual,and fascinating.

Most documentary footage of the actual Apollo 11 landing, for example, has been cobbled together from existing Public Affairs releases, and some key moments of audio have been cut.  I remember when it happened, and this is the first time since that I've seen it as it was broadcast.

If you want that...... there's many other excellent documentaries availiable that will fulfill that purpose. The wonderful thing about this movie is that for the first time, you get to see the Apollo astronauts let their hair down and share on camera their innermost emotional secrets and personal experiences from their trips to the Moon. Yes, many of the Apollo astronauts describe their flights as being a very spritual and perhaps a very ""religious"" experience. They tell you how it turned their lives upside down and tore some of their lives apart. A couple of them nearly went insane and couldn't cope with daily living after they came back to Earth. That's the simple fact of the matter it has every reason to be included in this film, whether you are a spiritual, religious person or not.
