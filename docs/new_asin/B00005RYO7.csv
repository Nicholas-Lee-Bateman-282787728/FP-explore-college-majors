With the incredible body Erica has, I'm surprised she never became a playmate.",1133481600,2,257,4.863636363636363
7952956,5,B00005RYO7,"I should know because I made it.
Here's a little story:  there's this one sequence where a couple of the cheerleaders are getting it on in a shower.  My first cut was the most erotic scene the folks at Playboy Enterprises had ever seen.  Everyone told me how sexy it was.  When Hef saw it he had a cow.  I got this memo from him telling me to tone it down.  ""I'm not Larry Flynt!"", he exclaimed in the note to me.  Naturally, I kept an uncut copy on my Avid for my personal archives.  Needless to say, that when anyone wants to know what this movie really looked like, I show them my earlier unsanitized version.
Nevertheless, the film is really good, despite the pathetic protestations from Carmen Electra that she wouldn't take off her clothes and the goofy music video, which I was forced to include.",1090022400,7,803,4.378378378378378
7952957,2,B00005RYO7,"When I bought the DVD I thought I was going to see some of the desirable fantasies a man can have. And there are.
But after watching it I deduced this movie was made for women instead of men, the fantasies seem made more for lesbians, the movie it's only 50 minutes long and the fantasies are too long. I think there are too many fantasies.
I was dosappointed with the appear of Carmen Electra, every time she appears in a movie she looks like an innocent-shy-teen girl. And of course the song and the video are bad.
Definitively, this isn't the best movie of Playboy.",1089849600,2,568,4.367924528301887
