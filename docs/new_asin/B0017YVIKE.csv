8267835,2,B0017YVIKE,"WHY SHAKESPEARE? is a short documentary presented by the National Endowment for the Arts. The purpose of the DVD is to illustrate the importance of reading, studying, and performing Shakespeare's works. There are a few short clips with famous actors, lesser known directors, younger people who have started their own theatre groups, and a few students. Each gives a short snippet about how the works of Shakespeare have affected their lives. There are also several segments where one of the interviewees recites a passage from Shakespeare.

There are some that are mistaken and seem to believe this documentary is supposed to be a basic look at Shakespeare or his works. That is not what this DVD is. It is intended to be a tool to illustrate why people (particularly students) should read, study, and perform Shakespeare and in that intention it fails miserably.

Originally sent out to schools and educators free as part of the Shakespeare in American Communities program. I was under the impression that the DVD should be used to show to students as a tool in illustrating the importance of Shakespeare. However, it's also been suggested that the DVD be shown to school officials and administrators to illustrate why they should develop or continue to support theatre education, particularly Shakespeare. Whatever the case, the DVD is incredibly boring. I work with middle school and high school students and most would be bored as a lazy crocodile within three minutes. The most interesting part about the DVD, and really the only one that most students might get a basic understanding of why Shakespeare is important is the 30 second segment that displays all the various names and places that have been taken from Shakespeare; from street signs to restaurants, to storefronts. As for school officials and administrators, there is very little in here that would sway an official one way or the other. The most interesting part of the whole DVD are the extra interviews in the special features, but most officials (and other people) don't have time to sit through a bunch of interviews which is sad because some of these interviews are very insightful and at times extremely engaging and a few even moving.

WHY SHAKESPEARE? is a DVD that school libraries should probably have on hand and English teachers might want to watch it (particularly the longer interviews) to perhaps use as a segment in class. Other than that, you'll have to answer the question yourself.",1270771200,,2469,5.002433090024331
