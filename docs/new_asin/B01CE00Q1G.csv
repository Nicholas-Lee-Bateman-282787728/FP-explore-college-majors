7680409,3,B01CE00Q1G,"First off, my rating is for the movie itself and not the form it came in.  A bunch of people have rated these new copies of the XMEN movies with 1 star because they think that it supposedly says on the back cover that it's a two disc edition but when opened, it's only one disc. THIS IS FALSE. The new slipcovers and the case itself say bluray+digital.  I read both the slipcover and the case artwork (even the fine print) and nowhere does it say it's two discs.  Digital copies are exactly that. Digital, not physical. You do get two copies of the movie but not on two discs.  First copy is a physical disc, second copy is a code to redeem the movie for free on VUDU.com.  I'm not sure why this is so complicated for some to understand.

Now for the movie itself: if XMEN Days of Future Past had not completely rewritten the past, I would have given this movie 1 star.  At the time, this was the worst third sequel EVER in my opinion. XMEN and X2 were both brilliant so The Last Stand was a HUGE disappointment.  But now, since Bryan Singer has taken back over, I can give this movie a solid 3 stars as it is just another step in the story that doesn't end with nearly everyone being murdered by evil Jean Grey/Phoenix.  Still my least favorite one, but I can deal with it now.

I would never watch this movie as a stand alone, like I would with any of the other XMEN movies (the Wolverine movies are not included in this as they both suck) but when I decide to have an XMEN marathon, The Last Stand will be included in the marathon now.",1469404800,9,1538,4.183050847457627

8752765,4,B01CE00Q1G,"The Last Stand is one of the weaker films in the X-Men series and I mostly purchased it to complete my collection. I'm writing this review to provide some details on the edition I received so any Blu-Ray collectors out there will have a better idea of what to expect. While the box art provided by Amazon is correct, I also received a Slip Cover (or O-Ring if you prefer) featuring Storm. A pleasant surprise since I wasn't expecting a slipcover. Good purchase in my opinion.",1501718400,,475,4.534883720930233
