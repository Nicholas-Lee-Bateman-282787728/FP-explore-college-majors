8299575,5,B001EUSY9E,"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Seriously, look at the cover, read the title, and imagine a budget of nothing. And yet it really is THAT good!
As a huge bonus, pun intended, if large bodacious breasts excite you, and general insanity mixed with bad
acting and bad special effects make you a very happy camper, this is the movie for you.

This is one of those movies where you wonder what the makers were smoking when
they thought it up, and made it, but all in all I loved it and I can't wait to watch it again.

And again, but to paraphrase Monty Python this time, one of the lassies has seriously
""huge tracts of land"" and she isn't afraid to ""use them."" Oh hell yeah...",1445817600,,696,4.102941176470588
8299576,1,B001EUSY9E,"You know those people who are sooo not funny that they think they're funny. But actually, they're just not funny. They made a movie. It's a mashup parody of the 80's movies Teen Wolf and Hot Dog where any charm and humor was replaced with a disturbing amount of underlying desperation to be liked, and jokes that were not only horribly constructed, but painfully delivered. Out of the 12 people who started watching this, only 3 made it to the end. This movie brought me and my friends from hopefulness, to boredom, to annoyance, and finally this weird mixture of dislike and pity. There are some entertaining and imaginative low budget B-Movies out there. But this isn't one of them. The only thing they got right was that the token hot chick was actually hot. Of course you're reading this right now on the internet, so you should already know how to find that stuff without having to suffer through watching what I can only describe as a cry for help. I'm guessing they tried too hard to make a campy ""It's so bad that it's good"" movie and overshot into just plain bad. Seriously, I watched the whole thing because I was the one who suggested it and I really wanted to give it a chance to redeem both myself and it. But it just left me feeling kind of sad and dirty. Whatever money the people who made this movie spent on it should have been spent on therapy instead. If you want to watch it, try to watch it by yourself first. Don't let this movie cause your friends to ban you from picking out movies for 6 months like it did to me.",1423440000,,1537,4.358885017421603
8299577,4,B001EUSY9E,Ski Wolf is a blast.  Throw in a hilarous performance by Trent Haaga and you have another LBP classic.,1414022400,,102,4.368421052631579
8299578,5,B001EUSY9E,"LBP combined 80's camp movies like Ski School and Teen Wolf and made a great fun movie. It's not Shakespeare. It's just fun. They are called Low Budget Pictures for a reason. And they don't try to hide the fact. These guys have made a ton of movies. All with low budgets. If you just want to be entertained and have fun, this is the movie for you (as well as anything by LBP).",1365033600,,376,4.094594594594595
8299579,5,B001EUSY9E,"For anyone who is famaliar with LBP aka Low Budget Picture's, you know what kind of crazy goodness is in store with Ski Wolf. It's one part Teen Wolf, one part Ski School,and one part Chris Seaver. Which means its hilarious and entertaining all the way through. The writing is great, the acting is great, and the music is catchy. Also included in Ski Wolf is Independent Movie God Trent Haaga. He makes his return after about 8 years since the last LBP movie he was in Mulva Zombie Ass-Kicker.

I suggest everyone check out Ski Wolf and LBP in general. I own about 85% of LBP's library of films and there isn't one that I regret buying. So if your into Independent Movie's, Great Writing, or just plain fun movies that arn't really like anything else being made these days, check out Low Budget Pictures and Chris Seaver.",1258761600,4,821,4.510067114093959
8299580,1,B001EUSY9E,"This is one of those amateur efforts that make you wonder who in their right mind would put up the money to make such an unmitigated piece of crap.
The actors look like they were recruited off the street and they spent most of the time acting silly and making faces. You get a clue of what to expect during the opening credits when you see that the name of the production company is LOW BUDGET PICTURES.
The plot is loosely and ineptly copied from several movies where ""Uncle Billy"" is in danger of losing his ski resort to the obnoxious villain and it's up to Ski Wolf to save the day. Ski Wolf being Uncle Billy's nephew who was bitten by a wolf.
This is strictly an amateur production that I watched free online out of curiosity.(After seeing it consistently being listed on Amazon for $20.00)
It's definitely not worth $20.00 or even .20 cents
There is one brief scene in the middle of the movie where a girl appears topless. Check out HOT DOG - THE MOVIE, it's head & shoulders above Ski Wolf.",1247788800,5,998,4.370967741935484
