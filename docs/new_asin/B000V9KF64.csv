8217523,3,B000V9KF64,"I like Jackie Smith and Tyne Daly but this movie, I didn;t enjoy at all. I gave this dvd away because it's not interesting enough to be added to my collection. Tyne Daly had a small part and she looked like a hooker.",1403568000,2,216,4.046511627906977
8217524,3,B000V9KF64,"Highly emotional drama starring Jaclyn Smith and five-time Emmy award winner Tyne Daly, Three Secrets is a great modern-day remake of the classic film from the 1950s.

After a plane crashes in a remote mountain range, there is doubt as to whether or not there are any survivors. But soon the desperate voice of the sole survivor, an 8 year-old boy, can be heard over the downed planes radio.

As a daring rescue attempt gets underway to save the young boy, 3 different women hear of the dire case through the news and race to the spot where the rescue is in progress. Each one of them gave up a baby years before and believe that this newly orphaned boy may be their son.

Stellar performances from a great cast make this engaging and compelling human drama impossible to resist.",1391644800,2,779,4.55
8217525,4,B000V9KF64,"Jaclyn Smith and Tyne Daly are two of my favorite actresses and I was looking forward to seeing this film to see them together.  Well Tyne may figure prominently on the cover but she is barely in the film.  The film is a typical tear jerker, soapy kind of Lifetime film that has some decent acting and some interesting insights into human nature.  I doubt that it will be anyone's favorite film but it is a decent night's entertainment.",1229299200,6,436,4.493670886075949
8217526,5,B000V9KF64,Although Tyne Daly has a extremely small part in this movie the storyline and plot are well acted and provide somewhat of a twist in the story line.,1198713600,8,148,4.321428571428571
