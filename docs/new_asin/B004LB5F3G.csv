8434166,3,B004LB5F3G,"As in his other DVDs, it is meant to be sensual, not sexual.  Alyse is a young woman, who could easily be the college student next door.  At least the photographer, in this DVD, has stopped using the flash outdoors, which detracts from the video, which is taken by a different person.  She is attractive enough, so some will find it interesting.  And to answer the question on many minds, yes, the 'money shot' is there.  If one has insomnia, the slide show portion is for you.  On one of the interior slide shows, it seems as if about a dozen shots are endlessly recycled.  And on one of the outdoor shots, I doubt many want to see a model as if she is 300 feet away from the camera.  The DVD is neither compelling nor repelling.",1519603200,,730,4.2773722627737225

8434170,5,B004LB5F3G,"I have gotten seven of these ""David-Nudes"" DVD's, but I think this one may be my favorite, Alyse is just too sweet, she has a certain kind of charm & is very energetic, she would be easy to fall for, also she has a great body, everything is perfect on her, I couldn't find a single flaw, we also get some great music to, it is clear that David is a fan of jazz music which makes it all the more fun to watch, also this one is a bit longer than the others, it should say 1 hour, not two, none of the ones I got are two hours, most are between an hour or hour & a half, still this is one of his best ones along with Rory, Aimee Addison, Stacey, & Cami.",1394755200,,650,3.786764705882353
8434171,4,B004LB5F3G,"Selection menu was fairly easy to use for selecting the chapter where you want to start.  DVD is just over 84 minutes in length, not the 2 hours on the video jacket. The DVD returns to the chapter selection menu at the end of the last chapter. Overall the photography was good and it appeared like a good tripod was used when filming the video portion of the DVD.",1307491200,2,363,4.260869565217392
