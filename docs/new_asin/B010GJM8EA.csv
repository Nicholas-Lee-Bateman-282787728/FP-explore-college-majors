7310903,2,B010GJM8EA,"One of the best Psychological thrillers ever made with little bit of Horror mixed in
Brilliantly Directed by British Director Jon Amiel
aswell as an excellent cast,
Sigourney weaver plays serial killer expert Dr Helen Hudson who
helps Inspector M.J. Monahan (Holly Hunter) help catch a serial killer, Peter Kurtin ( William McNamara)
Great performance by Actor William McNamara
who's committing brutal Murders in the San Francisco area copying some of the most infamous mass murderer's in History
The Boston strangler, the Hillside strangler, Son of sam, Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy
one of the best if not the best Psychological thriller of the 90's
lots of suspense all the way through the film
tragically this film has never got the respect it Deserves since it's first Blu-ray release about 4 years ago
originally owned by Warner bros, but now has been reissued by 20th century fox on blu-ray again this year
and very unfortunately no new special features
it would've been Great to get new retrospective interviews with
Director Jon Amiel, Sigourney weaver, Holly Hunter, William McNamara, Harry connick Jnr
about their recollections working on the film
but tragically no
the only extra that's on this new blu-ray version is the same extra that was on the previous Warner bros Blu-ray release
which was a DVD commentary track by Jon Amiel which i've listened to while watching the film
and i tell you the commentary is pointless not worth listening to at all
there's alot of pauses so Jon Amiel does not explain the making of the film throughout the commentary
he does not talk much about the casting at all
mostly what he talks about is how he filmed the scenes, Different camera angles etc
so after 30mins the commentary did get boring and waste of time listening to it
especially if there was alot of pauses which there was, very pathetic
it sounded like he wasn't interested doing the commentary
if that being the case then why did he agree to do a commentary at all, makes no sense
so very unfortunately the only extras you get is the old dvd commentary and the usual Theatrical trailer
but the HD transfer is very Good thou, nice sharp & clear picture quality in 2:40:1 ratio
and the sound quality is the same 5.1 mix
so probably the same HD transfer as the 2011 Warner bros blu-ray i think
much better quality than the old dvd version for sure
but whether you buy the old 2011 warner bros blu-ray or this new 2015 reissue by 20th century fox
it makes no difference in the quality both versions have the exact same content
5 stars for the film, 1-2stars for this new blu-ray reissue. only worth $5 or less",1441324800,4,2615,4.699346405228758

7310924,5,B010GJM8EA,"I was so anxious to receive a DVD copy of this! I have been replacing my old video tapes lately and when I saw Amazon had a copy of one of my all-time favorite thrillers, I just had to order it. The movie is very edge-of-your-seat, white-knuckled suspenseful! Of course, with a cast of Holly Hunter and Sigourney Weaver in it, it is a quality story-line too. It even has Harry Connick, Jr. in one of his first acting roles and he does a great job! I highly recommend this for all you thriller fans!",1475107200,,498,4.252631578947368
