ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES-- People in a small town near a swamp start mysteriously disappearing, so a game warden investigates reports of strange creatures lurking in the murky waters. Scripted by Leo Gordon, a favorite of Roger Corman, who was this film's executive producer. Low budget mediocrity with typically poor special effects. (Remade in 2008.)

BRIDE OF THE GORILLA-- Good cast is squandered in this so-so story of a jungle plantation owner who is transformed into a gorilla by a voodoo curse. Playing a native here is Martin Garralaga, the original Pancho Gonzales in the Cisco Kid movie series.

EEGAH-- Film's director Arch Hall Sr. appears with his son in this ludicrously bad tale of a 7 foot tall prehistoric caveman (Richard Kiel of 007 ""Jaws"" fame) on the rampage in Palm Springs, California.

THE GIANT GILA MONSTER-- Macro-photography at its worst. Oversized lizard terrorizes a Texas town but meets its match in a teenaged car mechanic. Texas radio DJ Ken Knox plays a Texas radio DJ.
