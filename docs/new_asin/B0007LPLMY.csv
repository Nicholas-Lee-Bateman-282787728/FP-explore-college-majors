2217721,5,B0007LPLMY,"there is no doubt that this movie is the best and most funny movie of all time. trey parker and matt stone are the coolest people. this movie is so funny, i was starting to tear after scenes. the pupets are so funny, and then along with the voices of trey parker and matt stone, make it the funniest movie of all time!",1097452800,4,318,4.063492063492063
2217722,4,B0007LPLMY,"In the process of letting the air out of some VERY inflated egos, Parker and Stone have delivered a film that is a better homage to Gerry Anderson's Supermarionation films and TV shows than the embarrassment that was the Thunderbirds movie earlier this year. The puppet work is both amazingly good and deliberately cheesy at the same time, a combination that works perfectly.

The deadly seriousness with which our society elevates actors to ""expert"" status in every field imaginable _needs_ lampooning, and I loved every bit of Team America's satire. That the film wasn't quite vicious enough in this regard was a minor disappointment to me, but given the insanity that celebrated Michael Moore's nonsense this past summer, Parker and Stone probably went as far as they could. (Maybe it's me - I mean, how much more could I really ask them to do with Michael Moore than what they did?)

The state of Broadway needs an entire Parker/Stone film devoted to it, so I wanted to see more on this subject than the one (brilliant) song in the movie. I really think the movie needed at least one more song somewhere in it - the songs from this team are always great. But all this, I suppose, is a good sign for this movie: I wanted more of everything. ""Leave 'em wanting more"" is an old show-biz axiom, and Team America left me hoping Parker and Stone will be in show biz for a good long time, so they can deliver more.",1097452800,7,1411,4.573122529644269
2217723,5,B0007LPLMY,"High school and college guys (and those of us with a little high school lingering inside) are clearly the target market for this movie. This crowd will enjoy Team America just because it's so over-the-top funny, irreverent, gross and crude--at first blush apparently joining the endless parade of empty teen ""comedies"" trying to top each other in crudeness.

But folks! Wait! This is crudity with a message!

And boy, what a message.

Buried underneath the explosions and expletives is a very intelligent summation of the Way the World Is. Yes, America isn't perfect (a hilarious opening scene in Paris deftly portrays this)--but is there something else to consider besides Our imperfection? Yes Michael Moore, there is another side to this equation, and Stone and Parker--bless 'em--give it to us, and it's messy but truly original, and yes, even brilliant. The sections of the film featuring North Korea's delusional dictator are perfect.

I left high school--and college--a long time ago, but I can imagine what it must be like to be a kid in today's frozen politically correct climate. No matter what you say, you're gonna' break someone's rules-and what's more, the rules aren't written down anywhere. I can also imagine what a release it must be to sit in a dark theater and finally be able to safely and completely let go of every possible politically correct sacred cow, and just laugh. Nearly every one of those smug, self-righteous, self-appointed arbiters of ""What's Right"" get whacked good in this movie. Man, that feels good.

In the end, Stone and Parker give ""the rest of us"" a voice. After having to endure the baffling silliness of watching half of America take Michael Moore's work of 911 fiction seriously; and the ludicrous claims of ""a chill wind"" from the likes of Tim Robbins, it's great fun (and even a little satisfying) to watch both Moore and Robbins ""get theirs"" in this movie. I loved this film. I'm not sure what kind of politics this move represents-perhaps some new hybrid. (I thought my political leanings were undefinable until Stephen Stanton on techcentralstation.com labeled misfits like me ""South Park Republicans."") If you're a common sense, hard-working American proud of Us, even with all Our faults (and you're not easily offended), you may enjoy this movie too.

In fact, I loved it so much, I'm gonna' go see it again. Take that, Michael Moore.",1097280000,13,2388,4.972431077694235
2217724,5,B0007LPLMY,"I have seen an advance showing of this movie, and if you are easily offended, you should not go. If you love Trey Parker and Matt Stone, this will not disappoint. I have never seen such politically incorrect, tasteless, crude, rude and disgusting behavior from puppets in my entire life, and I hope to do so again, and again, and again. I cannot give away a single ""plot"" point, you simply must see this movie yourself. I haven't laughed this hard at anything since ""Harold and Kumar go to White Castle"" came out. The best part of the movie, of course, are the ""throwaway"" songs throughout the movie, (especially whenever Team America launch their vehicles into action) listen carefully to the lyrics, even in this day and age, completely shocking. Keep up the good work, Trey and Matt. I still love what they do. And yes, I own ""BASEketball"" and paid full-price for it.",1097280000,7,870,4.6558441558441555
2217725,4,B0007LPLMY,"The White House, upon seeing only the previews for this film back in August, issued a statement saying it was wrong to release a film that mocked the current War on Terror. Catching this in a sneak preview, I can confirm that it does mock the United States' occasional arrogance regarding international policy.

Of course, it also mocks Korea, the Kama Sutra, the Screen Actors Guild, the TV show ""Thunderbirds,"" Jerry Bruckheimer films and the sad state of the Broadway musical.

Though not a great film - and not really trying to be, ""Team America"" is really, really, really, really, really, really funny.

Because it's a parody, I'm not sure exactly how to highlight its key points except to give a list of jokes that I found funny, and I don't really feel like spoiling them for other viewers. Oh, OK, I'll list a couple. There's a great, instant-classic sex scene. A great drunken-puppet scene. A great puppet speech. A great puppet obscene confession. And there are four great songs, performed by puppets.

For an action movie, ""Team America"" is actually pretty good, and the plot is easier to follow than a lot of the latest action movies.

And the idea that an actor would be able to find his place on a covert military force is sorta inspired.",1097280000,6,1252,4.698630136986301
2217726,5,B0007LPLMY,"I have not laughed this hard for a long time.  The geniuses, Parker and Stone, from South Park deserve an Oscar.  AND OUCH do they GIVE it to all the liberal Actors out there and I mean they REALLLLLY make fun of the Michael Moore's, Sean Penn's, Susan Sarandon's, Jeneane Garfolo's and Tim Robbins. Unmerciful, Savage, Intellectual Ridicule of these self righteous liberal lunatics....The AUDIENCE LOVED every minute of IT to.  Many WHOOPS, CLAPPING, WHISTLING AND HOLLARING..during the Actor Roasting Scenes. Its about time somebody ridiculed those Hollywood EGO's.(Its all over the Internet that Sean Penn Apparently is NOT amused LOL and wrote Stone and Parker a letter about it telling them as much..see Drudge Report for copy of letter)They weren't the only ones that got savaged by Stone and Parker in this film.  There is something for everyone. There was laughter every two minutes I swear it throughout the whole film!  The music, the vicious satire of Bruckenheimer Films, The infamous Doll Sex Scene....Nonstop laughter. It goes on and on.  A comic masterpiece. I pray it does 300 million dollars at the box office it deserves it. I'm GOING AGAIN! DOWN WITH the Film Actors Guild. Team America..(blank) YEAH! ROFL",1097280000,23,1225,5.069651741293533
2217727,5,B0007LPLMY,"I just saw the sneak preview of this film, and I, along with everyone else in the theater, did not stop laughing for more than 45 seconds at a time. From the brilliant songs (the one mocking 'Pearl Harbor' comes to mind), to the complete and utter absurdity of everything that was on screen, this will go down as a work of genius.

What one might not expect, though - or in today's climate of lunatic snowflakes, what one might willfully disregard altogether - is that the movie clearly loves the country as well, and for many of the very same things it pokes fun at - from politics to music to cinema cliches.  Parker & Stone understand that love and criticism go hand-in-hand;  that you can - indeed MUST - have both at the same time, without resorting to the sort of destructive, divisive, self-loathing attitudes prevalent among so many juvenile twits out there today.

The creators of South Park have brought their irreverent view of the world to the issue of international terrorism. What makes it so funny is it is done with The Thunderbirds style puppets and parodying the disaster rescuing feats of that show. Here, as Team America, they take down terrorists and North Korean dictators in the most visceral ways. Given they're puppets, this is mostly very amusing. So too is everything else they do; partying, vomiting and having sex. It is all so ludicrous and so very funny. Its also refreshing to see such a rejection of political correctness.

And predictable. The directors make overtures to liberalism, as with their jokes about homosexuality which focus on scat rather than on anything truly funny, but the depictions of Kim Jong Il are nothing but cameos. And it is impossible to tell what political allegiance the makers have. In my opinion none, which makes the movie nihilistic and flippant about serious subjects, like the USA's unending interference with other nations and their increasing vandalism.

2217909,1,B0007LPLMY,"Lemme just start off by saying that the movie itself is amazing, fantastic, and highly recommended by me. In my senior year of high school, I would watch Team America twice a day on VHS on a clunky old TV in my parents basement and sometimes spend entire afternoons in that basement and stay up late on summer nights watching it. The point is, I love this movie and it means a lot to me. Because of this, I've been anticipating an American Blu-Ray release of Team America: World Police for a while now, so the second I saw that Amazon was offering pre-orders, I jumped on it and excitedly dropped 10 bucks on the Team America Blu-Ray without a second thought. The Blu-Ray release for the South Park movie is one of the best (if not THE best) Blu-Ray transfers I own, and therefore I was REALLY excited for the Team America Blu-Ray release.

I eagerly waited for the October 13th release date for two and a half months and as the day got closer, my excitement grew and grew. However, a week before the release date, I got an email from Amazon saying that they didn't have the item in stock and it would take them some time (possibly up to 6 months) to finally acquire it. I was okay with waiting for a bit since I was so excited for the release. Then after waiting a month after the release date, I FINALLY got an email from Amazon saying that they had the friggin thing in stock and would be shipping soon. Then within that same week, the package finally shipped. Two days later, I came home from classes and saw the smiling Amazon package on my doorstep, and I was happy as a clam.

However, my joy was short lived after I popped the Blu-Ray into my PS3. The first thing I noticed was the very plain, cut and dry menu. It was just a still photo of the cover of the Blu-Ray with the puppet holding the riffle in front of the explosion. There was no music, and there were only three options at the bottom of the screen: ""PLAY MOVIE"", ""SET UP"", and ""SCENE SELECTION"". I was disappointed to see that they had removed the bonus features from the special edition DVD, but this could have been forgivable as long as the picture quality on the Blu-Ray is good

When I hit play (with no fun transitions from the menu into the film) and the Paramount logo came on screen, my heart sank. It looked to be of the same (if not worse) quality as the DVD. Like seriously, I don't know if I have ever seen such a terrible looking Blu-Ray before. There was what almost looked like an intentionally added layer of grain to the picture that looked TERRIBLE. Seriously, the quality of the Blu-Ray wasn't too far off from the quality of the VHS that I watched twice a day in my parents basement. As I watched the first 8 minutes, my heart continued to drop as I saw that even the Netflix copy had better quality than the Blu-Ray. To be fair, there are a few shots sprinkled throughout the film that do not look *too* bad, but overall the picture quality is really not good...at all.

Honestly, I'd just stick with the DVD and entirely avoid the Blu-Ray release. You're not missing out on anything. The picture quality on the Blu-Ray is the same on the DVD (if not the same on the VHS), and you get bonus features on the DVD.

Shame on you, Paramount. You guys are better than this.

(Also, I feel it is worth noting that the unrated cut is not included on this release, only the theatrical cut. This doesn't bother me, as the cut I'm used to is the theatrical cut that was on the VHS, but it might bother others who prefer the unrated or who are used to it)",1448236800,8,3536,4.2859281437125745

I don't understand why studios bother releasing bare-bones editions of discs that already have preexisting content. I get that they don't want to spend money on a new transfer.

The movie features a team of elite commandoes known as team america taking down problems across the globe.  Lots of satire about current state of affairs and military.

I ceaselessly ask myself:
Great Movie or,
Greatest Movie Ever!

If you can get past the puppet sex and the offensive language, this movie carries a deeply philosophical message about the role and responsibilities of a World Super Power in an increasingly shrinking and connected world.

Regardless of the amazing fact that this movie uses no CG and that every action sequence was filmed live, and that every set was painstakingly created by some of the most crafted miniature artists in the World, and cast with the World's most skilled Marionette puppeteers (Yes, Big Budget!).
(And it conjures up images of the 1960's Thunder Birds!)

2217950,5,B0007LPLMY,"As this movie was made by the creators of ""South Park"", the vulgarity of it was logically expected. It did not disappoint in that sense.

But it was also a clever satire of many things, including many blockbuster movie clichs, pornography (could anyone really be excited by genital-less marionettes having sex?), musicals, left-wing ideology and its willingness to turn a blind eye to evil as long as it's anti-American, and a number of pompous egotistical Hollywood celebrities who wallow in their own importance-mentioned by name! This does largely explain why the movie used marionettes; what better way to depict real people while avoiding legal complications? The plot is of course very standard for an actioner, and need not be repeated, though a few surprises-nay, shocks-are thrown in.

Overall, highly recommended, but not for the kids or the squeamish. Any movie that manages to get a rise out of the grandstander extraordinaire Sean Penn deserves all the praise it can get!",1430092800,,984,5.14375

Didn't the Germans do something similar to a different group of people during World War 2? This is truly the most disgusting, violent, liberal-hating, (way beyond bashing), stupid movies I hope to ever see in my lifetime! It's certainly beyond satire or cathartic violence! What's so amusing about a bunch of American fools blowing up some of the world's most important cultural landmarks, or showing scenes of torture in prison?

The gruesome violence at the end of this movie, where every liberal actor and actress in Hollywood is brutally killed, with guts flying every which way, makes it extremely inappropriate for anyone who is not sadistic! I'm a middle-aged adult, and I had to look away from the screen!

Forget about the sex scene, its less than 30-seconds, and certainly not worth the price of admission. Nor has it anything to do with the story line! It's just a ploy for the curious to shell out their hard earned money to purchase a movie ticket.

I felt like walking out towards the end to make a political statement to the audience, but instead I resisted in order to write a thorough review.

2218038,5,B0007LPLMY,"I'm going to skip the portion that would usually gauge how politically correct this film is...in fact, I apologize for even bringing it up.

This movie is stupid. It's blunt-force trauma satire, the way only the creators of South Park could do.

You don't see a lot of movies shot using puppets...and within the first 10 minutes or so of Team America you quickly learn why. It's unique and self aware nature makes the awkward movement acceptable and even funny at times, and the inherent 'shittyness' of the quality in general can be easily forgiven depending on whether you like this type of satire.

This film is incredible polarizing; if you don't hate it then you will probably love it...I know, that's a BS statement and a cop out, but it's true.

When I saw this in theaters...people laughed, and people left. My opinion in this post-9/11 world is that it's healthy to cope with comedy...but for many, perhaps, it's too soon and the film takes it too far.

I don't care, because ultimately the first time the audience heard that ""Team America"" theme song...people were practically crying. I'm not sure I've ever seen people laugh that hard in so called ""smart"" comedies.

2218084,3,B0007LPLMY,"If you are a fan of ""South Park"", you'll enjoy ""Team America: World Police"". Done by Trey Parker & Matt Stone, ""Team America"" is like a warped version of the old ""Thunderbirds"" puppet-cartoon thing.

""Team America: World Police"" deals with a special ops fighting unit that travels to hot-spots around the world stopping terrorists. As the movie opens we see them destroy most of Paris while stopping a terrorist before he can set off his Weapon of Mass Destruction. Unfortunately, Team America loses one of their own during the operation, and they have to find a replacement. They recruit Gary, an actor currently starring in a Broadway play. Hoping to use Gary's acting skills to infiltrate a terrorist cell, Team America wants to learn who is behind all of the terrorist activity. We soon learn that North Korea's Kim Jung-Il is supplying the terrorists with their weapons, and it's up to Team America to stop him.

There are some truly laugh out loud moments in this movie, and like Parker and Stone's animated TV series, nothing is scared in this film. Hollywood celebrities, politicians, country music, various stereotypes, action movie clichs....you name it, it gets skewered. The use of marionettes is...different, and I will say there are a few times where the puppet action got me to laugh, but after awhile that joke gets kind of stale, and while watching the hour and forty minute film, I kind of wished they had either gone live action or pure animation. I think the running time really hurts this movie, as it just feels too long. If they had trimmed this up to 80 minutes, I would've given it a much higher rating, but by the 90 minute mark I was watching the counter on the DVD wondering how much longer it was going to run.

I will say that like the ""South Park"" movie, one of my favorite parts of the film is the music. I think the biggest laugh I had in the movie was when you first hear ""America (F*** Yeah!)"". And the Alan Jackson-like country song about the cost of freedom was spot-on hilarious. I'm not sure I would recommend a purchase of the DVD as I'm not sure how often you'll go back to re-watch, but it's worth at least rental for fans of ""South Park"".",1404864000,,2181,4.6015424164524426

Because no one other then those two guys could get a major studio to back a 32 million dollar puppet film with  ""old school"" marionettes.  That's genius.

The funniest movie of all time makes much fun of America-centric thinking, foreign stereotypes, outspoken liberal actors and liberal use of advanced weaponry, short despots who have troubre speaking correct Engrish, and fellatio as patriotism.

Team America is a wonderful musical! And I don't like musicals! Everyone Has AIDS (AIDS-AIDS-AIDS-AIDS-AIDS), The Montage Song, Pearl Harbor Sucked, Freedom Costs a Buck O Five, Ronery, America, F*** Yeah, all contribute to a memorable soundtrack you can really sing along with.

The puppet gags are hilarious, from a kung-fu fight to an actor's amazing physical metamorphosis to a terrorist, from unrated puppet sex (why you must choose the unrated version) to Gary's impressive capacity for vomiting.

If it all sounds like one big over the top action movie, there are still plenty of scenes displaying intense human emotions. There's a love triangle (rhombus actually), and characters deal with doubt, loss, jealousy and being molested by the cast of Cats.

It successfully parodies everything in the action movie genre, makes pointed-but-not-overt social commentary, has some of the best one-liners you could ask for, and does it all with marionettes in lavishly constructed sets that have numerous hilarious touches as well. I first saw it when it came out, and own a copy on DVD, but we were out of town and wanted to share it with some friends so we bought this copy.

It is worthy of multiple views and has even managed to stay relevant although it's 10 years old.

Say what you will about Stone and Parker and their brand of comedy (I happen to enjoy it). But do yourself a favor and check out this movie, just for the fact that it's brilliant puppeteering. It's very precise and almost too lifelike- to the point that they intentionally throw in awkward fight scenes and such, to remind you of the fact that you're watching puppets and not real actors.

I've been waiting for this to come out on Bluray for WAAY too long. So glad that it finally has! The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because apparently there are no extras (the DVD extras are fantastic, I love all the ""making of"" stuff - it makes you appreciate what a complicated endeavor this was).

2218227,5,B0007LPLMY,"This is quite possibly the funniest movie to come out since the glory days of Mel Brooks, Monty Python, and the Zucker brothers. Matt & Trey (the creators of South Park) are at their absolute finest in this amazing satire. This movie has all of the brilliant elements of South Park, but it takes them all to the next level. This movie has its fair share of bathroom & bedroom humor, but all of the jokes revolving around these two subjects are well placed & are part of the satire. Most importantly they don't overwhelm the movie by going non-stop like say ""Superbad."" However, as you would expect with Matt & Trey, the make fun of anything and everything: Muslim stereotypes (they are making fun of the stereotypes people have about muslims, not muslims themselves), foreign dictators, Hollywood celebraties, certain action movies, and it even parodies typical bathroom & bedroom humor itself.  In many aspects, Team America could be considered a musical because all of the songs that are sung are absolutely hysterical. The last time I laughed this hard at a song was when I heard ""White & Nerdy"" by Weird Al Yankovich. Lastly, this movie features puppets, which bear the brunt of the jokes (if it were done by a pupppet), but that shouldn't deter you from watching this movie at all, seeing as the technical aspects are done to perfection.

However, with a movie with this much adult content, I have to put in a disclaimer: do not watch if you are offended by lots of f-bombs or very crude sexual humor.

2218232,5,B0007LPLMY,"Okay, this is not the sparkling wit of the Algonquin round table. And yes, it does veer toward the kind of gross, pre-teen humor that puts off a lot of people, including me.

But boy, this is one funny movie. It begins in what the filmmakers describe as ""every American's image of Paris""- a city block containing every major tourist attraction in the city- and from there it turns into the ultimate Jerry Bruckheimer movie... if Jerry Bruckheimer made movies with puppets. If you were a kid in the 1960s who grew up with shows like FIreball XL5, Supercar, and Thunderbirds Are Go, you'll laugh with recognition at the characters who populate this movie. What makes it work is that the filmmakers play it perfectly straight, honoring every cliche of those great TV shows (and the Bruckheimer movies) while having their marionettes indulge in wild sex and the kind of bloody violence that would never have passed muster on a 60s kiddie show.

Where it really works for me is the broad parodies of contemporary culture and world affairs. There's a viciously funny parody of ""Rent"" that features the lead singing a song called ""Everybody Gets Aids"". Mean? Perhaps. But a great send up of what's become a theatrical cliche. And it's nothing compared to the shots the movie takes at Hollywood and politicians.

I would like to think that writers were downloading the story line from Darth Cheney's darkest fantasy.

On the political side, this movie pokes fun at both sides of the aisle and can be appreciated by liberals and conservatives alike. This was created during the infancy of the ""War on Terror"" and pokes a lot of fun of the events happening at that time, as well as Cold War 1980's Pro-American Hollywood films, and 80's style film making in general. The soundtrack is also hilarious. Written and often sung by Parker himself, it's riddled with humor.

2218240,1,B0007LPLMY,"I might have liked this movie when I was around 16 years old. You know, that time of life when you still think a fart is funny, but you're moving on to more ""hard-core"" humor that you are sure that your parents secretly like. Overkill, quite literally, is hilarious because you're mature enough to see how violence can be comedy if it's ironic. Yeah, farts are funny, but someone vomiting his brains out is some next-level stuff. Sure, saying ""penis"" makes you crack up, but d*ck and p*ssy along with a lot of graphic sex talk puts you in with the big boys. Of course, if it's all done with marionettes then it looks SO crazy hilarious that anything goes. Graphic violence, sex, language... whatever... takes you up a few notches into a new level of maturity that gets you ready for even more.

I ""get"" this movie. It's irony. It's pop culture taken to the extreme. And if I were still a punk kid who didn't know that this stuff can really mess you up, then I'd give it a five star and start looking for more. But I've already been through that crap and it didn't help me in any way. This kind of stuff teaches you to laugh at the wrong things -- stuff that, at first, you're not sure why it's funny.

2218243,2,B0007LPLMY,"Team America: World Police (2004) is Trey Parker and Matt Stone's ambitious attempt to create an R-rated comedy composed of puppets and marionettes. Like the South Park Movie, Team America is a satire on American politics. And like that movie, it is simply not funny. In most cases, it's not even good.

That's not to say Parker and Stone don't deserve credit for trying something new. In fact, Team America tries to be everything: a satire on the Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer blockbusters, a swipe at the bloated action epics of Michael Bay, a comical reflection of jingoistic patriotism from Bush-Era America and a vilification of liberal Hollywood celebrities. And yet, with the exception of the first, TA fails in its supposedly satirical message and delivery of jokes.

Many fans have compared Trey Parker and Matt Stone to the iconoclastic comedy troupe Monty Python. I beg to differ. Python were a group of sophisticated intellectuals whose mixture of cerebral humor, political incorrectness and witty dialogue helped produce seething, intelligent and increasingly relevant television episodes and movie satires. Parker and Stone are two practical jokers who think that going after virtually everybody is equivalent to smart satire. No, it does not, especially in a frustratingly haphazard movie like this.

And what a frustratingly haphazard movie this is; an audacious idea that falters in uneven execution. The opening sequence, where Team America assault the terrorists and, in turn, annihilate Paris, is extremely funny and perfectly executed, both exciting in its action and mocking of the Bruckheimer productions that Parker and Stone are going after. The sequence where Gary tries to uncover terrorist information in Cairo and is caught in a car chase between the terrorists and Team America is both a loving homage to the Mos Eisley scene from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars/dp/B0006VIE4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars</a>&nbsp;and an effective jab at the gung-ho American politics of movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Top-Gun/dp/B0002WZTOI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Top Gun</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo/dp/B0015XHP4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo</a>&nbsp;movies.

And yet even with these two or three great sequences, the movie doesn't work. Team America is an irritating blend of unfunny jokes (""Matt Damon"", showing loyalties via oral sex, the body part speech in the end), uninteresting puppeteering, mediocre screenwriting (you know this movie's in trouble when it needs to sing about Michael Bay to kill some time) and the longest vomiting scene of all time, which would be funny if it wasn't so tedious. Oh and there's a puppet sex scene. Ha ha ha. Not.

This also leads to another problem with TA: the liberal Hollywood celebrities. Why are they in the movie? Why are they portrayed as villains? To be made fun of? That's it? That's not satire; that's grade school mockery. Instead of just mentioning it, why didn't Parker and Stone use Sean Penn's visit to Iraq as a political motivation for aligning themselves with Jong II? That would have given the movie's satirical message a greater edge and the movie more bite. And, sure, there is a subplot where Gary idolizes Alec Baldwin and is shocked to see him revile Team America as the scum of the earth. But it's never fully realized. The actor caricatures seem to exist to be made fun of and that's it. Just because you poke fun at something doesn't mean it is good satire. Yes, it's funny. Ha ha ha. But as satire, it's childish.

It's unfortunate that so much talent was wasted on such a feeble movie. Besides Parker and Stone, the movie was photographed by Bill Pope, who did cinematography for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Army-of-Darkness/dp/B000ICXQOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Army of Darkness</a>(1993) and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matrix/dp/B000OPPBEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matrix</a>&nbsp;movies and the music was composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, who is also the conductor of several Metal Gear Solid video games; to speak little of the puppet operators, who had their talents squandered due to a lackluster script.

TA deserves praise for being bold and trying to be creative. It's just too bad that the script couldn't deliver the goods. For a pair of supposedly iconoclastic comedy writers, it's depressing that the best jokes Parker and Stone could come up with involve hammers, oral sex and vomiting.

2218263,3,B0007LPLMY,"Team America: World Police Uncensored and Unrated (2004)
This film is everything I expected to be since it was created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. It's very obscene, vulgar, witty, grotesque, purposely cheesy, and humorous. I hope young children do not come across this movie and watch it. It's very violent and sexual. It's definitely for a mature audience. The scene where Gary and Lisa have sex was so long and over the top, which made the whole thing funny, but I found it gross at the end. Also, the scene where Gary is drunk and depressed outside of the bar is gross. Was the length of that scene necessary? I get it: he can't hold his liquor. But that's Trey Parker and Matt Stone humor. How could I expect less? This movie does well in targeting everyone surrounding the involvement with the 9/11 terrorist attacks, such as the celebrity activists, etc. This movie took a serious issue and tainted it all with sarcasm. I think it wouldn't have worked with anything but puppets. The puppets were the key to making this work. They made everything silly and satirical. The fight scenes reminded me of MTV's Celebrity Death Match. The first, I guess you would say: fist fight, was funny due to the limited mobility of the puppets. I found it funny that Team America kept using the word valmoriphication to embellish the transformations of Gary and the limousine. The soundtrack, pure filth/knock offs, but I find some humor in it. The funniest song was Montage. I liked that one. All the others are crude and offensive. Nice job with the patriotic country songs though. The battle scene with the Koreans in the jets over the water reminded me of some scenes in the SpongeBob Square Pants series. They were created the same way. A few details of the movie can be referenced back to South Park. Details such as, the puppet of Matt Damon saying only his name like Timmy does in South Park. My overall rating for this movie on a scale from one to ten is three. I didn't think it was that hilarious as it was meant to be, just clever.",1282435200,,2036,4.565573770491803

2218265,5,B0007LPLMY,"This brilliant movie starts with a bang as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre explode. And then it just gets funnier and better. The puppets appear quite human so there's no problem with the ""suspension of disbelief"" whilst the heroes are fallible but likable.

Spectacular cinematography abounds in the Panama Canal scenes and in Egypt where the Great Pyramid and the venerable Sphinx suffer the same fate as the Eiffel and the Louvre. The HQ of Team America at Mount Rushmore also sticks in the memory.

Gary acts in a Broadway musical when the Team approaches him for help. One of the most arresting scenes shows Gary singing lead in a rendition of the hit song&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Everyone-Has-AIDS/dp/B00031TXTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Everyone Has AIDS</a>. The camera catches some well-dressed, nuanced members of the audience shedding an elegant, politically appropriate tear or two. Priceless!

Things turn even more hilarious with the appearance of the Film Actors Guild (FAG), led by the silver-tongued Alec Baldwin. His speech, interrupted by rapturous desk-thumping by the assembled FAG-ers that include Susan Sarandon, Sean Penn, Jeanine Garofalo and a particularly DUH Matt Damon, is something to cherish. The comments to the media by some of these esteemed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/celebrities/dp/0471706248/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">celebrities</a>&nbsp;are equally side-splitting.

Then there is of course the intercourse, a passionate scene between two attractive teamsters, giving new meaning to Leonard Cohen's album title&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Various-Positions/dp/B000002AZX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Various Positions</a>. This is just a short interlude; I didn't find it particularly shock- or noteworthy. In the grip of passion, all sorts of things happen.

Kim Jong Il is definitely a star of the movie with his cute accent and his banally evil personality. I caught myself entertaining thoughts of sympathy for Kim as he fed Hans Blix to his pet sharks. And the feeding itself reminded one again of the awesome savage power of nature. ""Brix"" (as Kim called him) learnt a lesson for trying to impose his silly western cultural norms on the beloved leader of North Korea. What arrogance to attempt such a thing!

In the meantime, the porcine propagandist&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Moore/dp/B000GG4GIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Moore</a>&nbsp;has caused great damage at the Mount Rushmore HQ by blowing himself up with a suicide jacket. But when things look bleak, Gary returns as the hero. Kim is entertaining the FAG celebrities plus delegations of dignitaries from around the globe. This is to distract them while his minions are preparing to set off 230 major bombs around the world.

Just in time Gary frees the team, then uses his skills as an actor and orator to deliver an eloquent speech that completely upstages Alec Baldwin, the master of ceremonies. The detonation of the bombs is averted and a fight to the death ensues between the Team and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hollywood-actors/dp/0767919025/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hollywood actors</a>. A particularly sleazy looking Sean Penn meets his end at the fangs of a big black kitty cat, Sarandon is sliced in two and the others are shot in riveting gun battles.

My only complaint is that I sorely missed Parker and Stone's most lovable characters, the Canadian master comedians Terrance and Phillip, whose movie Asses Of Fire contributed so much to making the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/South-Park-Bigger-Longer-Uncut/dp/B000022TSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut</a>&nbsp;so unforgettable. A bit of Terrance and Phillip's flatulence would have made this little gem even funnier.

Easily bored, I don't like long movies. I am pleased to report that Team America: World Police holds the attention throughout.

2218271,5,B0007LPLMY,"My kids were just at the wrong age, too young, for me to have gotten into South Park, so ""Team America"" was kind of a revelation to me. The movie is vulgar, politically incorrect and oh so crude. But it is also a very smart combination of writing, smart puppeteering and topical satire that is just has to be seen to be believed.

Team America is a group of star-spangled fighters who take on terrorists. They tend to be a little quick on the draw, and often cause more damage to those they want to save than the bad guys. The opening scene, in which the team blows the living hell out of Central Paris, sets the stage for the rest of the film.

It's hard sometimes to know with Trey and Stone where satire ends and crude ethnic stereotyping begins. One American character bluffs his way past a couple of Arab guards by repeating variations on ""Durka durka."" Is this making fun of the America belief that foreign culture and language is so easily adopted?  Or that Arabic is barbaric nonsense? Hard to say. Then there is the film's portrayal of many of Hollywood's leftist artists as terror-pandering loons. Alec Baldwin comes in for a particular savaging, but then so do Susan Sarandon, Janeane Garafalo, Matt Damon and many others. Trey and Stone are notoriously evenhanded in targeting left and right, though I have to say that the right gets off rather easy in this film. It's a choice being portrayed as narrow-mindedly militaristic v getting your head blown off.

Anyway, Team America finds its way to North Korea, where lead bad guy, Kim Jong Ill, is the terrorist puppet master who pulls the metaphorical strings of terrorists around the globe. Sometimes I wonder whether the real Kim, already on the downslope of the sanity slide, would see this movie by itself as a pretext to harry the West. Let's hope that never happens. In the film, he is a sadistic crime master with a ""ronery"" (lonely) heart of gold. His signature song, ""I'm so Ronery"" bewails his lack of company at the top, while making uncomfortable fun of the East Asian pronunciation. It's this kind of combination hi- and low-brow humor that make the film irresistible and enchanting for nearly every taste..

For a kid like me who grew up in the 60's with shows like ""Fireball XL-5"" that feature the hop-skip motion of puppets, this film was a great nostalgia trip. Even a 6-year old kid in 1962 watching characters flop into their jet pilot's seats knew he was watching something bizarre and memorable. ""Team America"" ramps up the inanity of the puppeteering technique, inserting all manner of violence and sexuality that the producers of ""Fireball"" could never have imagined. Trey and Stone pay tribute to the genre while mercilessly exploiting and expanding it. The film's music adds greatly to the sense of irreverent fun. A love song between two characters (""Pearl Harbor sucked, and I love you"") trashes Ben Affleck and takes a swipe at smarmy movie love songs.  The film's theme song is not only rude, violent and jingoistic, but has a country flavor that fits right into the ""I'm proud to be an American"" genre of contemporary popular patriotic music.

Team America is not a film for the gentle or pious. Church folk - stay away! But if you have a certain kind of twisted humor, can stand watching puppets blowing each other away with automatic weapons and explosives, and don't mind watching naked, articulated puppets engage in every graphic sexual situation imaginable, then put this film on your cinematic bucket list.

Should you pick up or watch ""Team America""? F-yeah!",1258675200,2,3557,4.753646677471637

2218273,1,B0007LPLMY,"In brief, this movie was jejune and tedious to watch. It was also cowardly in its cartoonish portrayal of Islamic terrorists, as it takes no ""balls"" (in the parlance of this ilk of film) to treat a genuine ideological threat as a sock puppet of another, more tractable and less serious threat (I will not give away their plot, but one can read other reviews to get the relevant details). In doing this, the film follows a long line of others that very deliberately fail to confront head-on the roots of Islamic terrorism. To excuse the film on this score because it is meant to be a satire would be wrong, as the best satires, subtly and indirectly of course, nail the truth (and in particular do not try to tidy it up in an equivocating fashion). But ""Team America"" dutifully misses all targets of interest and import; in this opinion I stand at variance with many of the other reviewers, which is unfortunate. Parker and Stone reveal themselves to be as craven as the left-wing actors they insipidly parody. This film fails at every level as a satire, and at best reaches the level of vulgar parody. And by vulgar here I do not simply mean coarse (though it was, but I have no problem with that per se), but rather popular.

Finally, some technical comments: 1) The super-marionation was initially interesting, but its novelty wore off after a few minutes. Moreover, it seemed to have less power here (where it was used in part as a homage but more as a post-ironic sight gag) than in its original, earnest applications (e.g., ""Thunderbirds""). 2) I was extremely frustrated with the poor quality of the puppet mimicry of the Hollywood actors; and so we were deprived of even the simple pleasure of adept caricature (which was my motivation for having purchased this film), with the Kim Jong Il puppet being a notable exception. The other ""famous faces"" puppets looked like caricatures of people, just not of those that they were supposed to be caricaturing. 3) I cannot stand Trey Parker's voice-work, and here you are glutted with it.

My recommendation: If you are a poorly read 17-28 old who considers himself a hip political realist because he enjoys watching ""South Park"", then you might similarly enjoy this attempt at ""balanced"" post-9/11 satire. If not, you'll likely recognize it within minutes (or less) as stunted, pseudo-satirical dreck.",1248134400,3,2351,4.788177339901478
2218274,4,B0007LPLMY,"""Team America World Police"" is a political satire from Trey Parker and Matt Stone about their perceptions of America's role as the world's policeman. Made with ""Thunderbirds"" style marionettes, the plot springs from the destruction of much of Paris while pursuing terrorists, where an elite U.S. counter-terrorism group loses a member; the replacement turns out to be an actor with a boatload of emotional baggage. Before long North Korean crackpot Kim Jong-il plots world destruction with the help of the Film Actors Guild, lead by Alec Baldwin. An assortment of leftist actors sympathizes with Kim and believes everything to be America's fault. Satire can be the best indicator of reality; certainly this is one of those times as the film satirizes the arrogance, nave, and simplistic attitudes so prevalent in the chic Hollywood political activist circuit.

The film is somewhat libertarian in attitude, as it mocks elements from all political factions from Derkaderkastan to Hollywood. By far most of the venom here is directed at the far left Hollywood elite, with special treatment reserved not only for Baldwin, but Michael Moore (who is referred to as a ""giant socialist weasel,"" and who blows up Mount Rushmore), Martin Sheen and Tim Robbins (who are North Korean guards), Sean Penn, Susan Sarandon, Janeane Garofalo, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Danny Glover, Peter Jennings, and others. The actors meet fates appropriate for the film, with Glover and Penn being eaten by house cats, for instance.

The United Nations, as impotent in this film as it is in real life, is also rightfully mocked. The U.N. sends the useless Hans Blix to inspect Kim Jong-il's property, and Hans is quickly eaten by Kim's sharks. Kim gets to sing a ballad about loneliness that is the musical highlight of the film, although I loved the battle preparation song complete with the line ""we're gonna' need a montage"" almost as much.

As you might expect from Parker and Stone, the film is frequently tasteless (e.g. extensive marionette vomiting) and is very politically incorrect. I am by no means a fan of ""gross out"" humor, and while some of the gags could have been dispensed with, the satirical points made by Parker and Stone are completely legitimate. Unsurprisingly some of the people caricatured in the film were unhappy with the skewering they received. Penn wrote a hostile and profane letter to Parker and Stone as a result, which seemed to prove that he can dish it out but can't take it, although Clooney was more mature and claimed that he would have been insulted had he not been parodied in the movie.

The film is refreshingly independent and did well at the box office (grossing approximately $51 million), which provides hope that more films not beholden to the uber-left Hollywood mentality will be greenlighted in the future. While ""Team America"" is nowhere near perfect, it does have many funny moments interspersed with the gratuitous grossness, and most importantly of all, effectively skewers its targets, which was the point in making a satire in the first place.",1242604800,,3075,5.047244094488189

2218295,5,B0007LPLMY,"This film was really, and I mean really hilarous!  I keep watching it constantly and I almost have the quotes in my head by now!

WARNING, POSSIBLE SPOILERS:

It first starts off in Paris, Osama bin Laden and his gang of terrorists are trying to blow Paris up.  But then Team America or TA for sort, shows up.  TA while fighting the terrorists are the ones blowing the Effel Tower up along with other monuments.  After Carson proposes to Lisa, his life is suddenly cut short when a terrorist kills him.

Meanwhile the plot goes to New York, where a very talented broadway actor named Gary, is hired by the TA leader Spotswoode, to work as a spy to get info out of the terrorists in Cairo.  Everyone seems to like him, except Chris, who for some reason mistrusts actors.  They succed in killing the Chechinans, but it's not really the Chechnians who are in charge, the real villian here is Kim Jong Ill, better know as the strange leader of North Korea.  He's planning to blow up the world and even manipulates a group of actors and actoress lead by Alec Balwden.

On a more romantic note, Gary falls for Lisa, who is afraid to give her heart away in the fear of lossing someone she loves again.  They consitmate their love, which I have no idea how they made the puppets have sex.  Gary too is dealing with a lose from long again, his older brother, who was beaten to death by gorillas.  Meanwhile, Sarah too likes Gary, and Joe likes Sarah.  But Gary quits the team after finding out that they didn't stop anything really.  And when the terroirst fired back by blowing up the Panama Canal.

Then matters become worst when TA are captured by Kimmy (it's a nick name, don't ask)  Well Kimmy even sings a song about how lonely he is and how there are people in the world that are less smarter then he is.  Well anyways, it's now up to Gary, with the help of Spotswoode, to take on Kimmy and his allies, and save the world.

This movie should have gotten a better review!  But anyways, they have parodied this movie after the invasion of Iraq obviously!  And they even put in a parodied country song, and a tribute to how Pearl Harbor, the movie, sucked.  I recommed this to South Park fans such as myself!  But I don't recommend it to close-minded people or children.",1201132800,3,2265,4.402409638554217

This movie stinks of a neutralizing political calculus designed to offend everyone by equally glib measure. Team America is a special force designed to take down terrorists wherever they are by mindlessly firing guns and rockets anywhere around them. The joke: Team American destroys the village to save the village. Savor the sweet creamy humor of that, because the joke lasts for the entire length of the film. There are a few other jokes, though. Puppets are horribly imprecise actors, especially when directed by people who loath puppetry. Also: Actors are puppets, to be lured to Pyong Yang under ridiculous auspices and employed to fight Team America without any reason. Ha Ha. Arabic is a gibberish language that sounds mostly like ""hakalaka laka haka.""

It's not that the whole film is a waste. There are some funny musical numbers, namely ""America, F*ck Yeah"" -- a direct hit, especially when they play a down-tempo version of it in the second act when it looks like TA is done for. Also, Kim Jong Il's ""I'm So Lonely"" is pretty good.

My point is this: Team America could have been a very good one-minute Super Bowl commercial. Stretched out to full-length and full-price, it's just horrible. If you don't feel cheated at the end of this film, you may be a card-carrying moron.",1199577600,4,1405,4.773662551440329

Team America (""America, f*ck yeah!"") roots out evil wherever it be simultaneously leaving confusion and destruction in its wake. Not too hard to see a pointed criticism here. But lest the hawks feel picked on, the doves get theirs too - in spades. No one is spared. This film won't make much sense to most people in 20 years, but it does now.

Oh this movie is far from politically correct (as with just about all of the Parker and Stone creations) but it is outrageously funny and entertaining.

While I had been avoiding buying things in the UMD format initially, the release of the Slimline PSP with it's ability to output to TV via the add-on cable had me going back and buying some favorites for viewing on the PSP with the thought being that I could at least watch the same movies on the bigger screen if I desired.

This is one of those movies that I'll get in just about every available format as I can't help but watch it when I catch it on the TV and then get irritated by how censored the movie is and how badly it's chopped up for insertion of commercials and such.

I really don't know why they decided to use hand puppets for the characters.  Their faces are expressionless for the most part, and it gives off a really creepy vibe, which I don't think was the intention.  The film is a bit dated already, as many targets of its satire are not newsmakers anymore.  Many in the future will watch this film in utter bewilderment, as they will not have the context to understand it, because all of its satire is topical.  Of course, there are gross out jokes (it wouldn't be a Trey and Matt if there wasn't).  I did like some of the satire.  There's a very funny moment at a meeting of ""FAG"" (really childish name) where the Janeane Garofalo hand puppet says ""we should be allowed to read news headlines and pretend they're our own words"".  Janeane recently appeared on Bill Maher's show, and she said ""Bush is the new Saddam"".  This was an actual headline from a Canadian newspaper recently, so I thought the sequence was rather amusing.  In fairness to Janeane, she doesn't do this all the time, but it's still worth noting.  But too often these incisive satiric moments like that are few and far between, and the film relies on gross out humour, bad jokes, monotonic dialogue, and just lazy writing.

2218304,5,B0007LPLMY,"I think it was Trey Parker who was interviewed a few years ago and said, regarding his politics, ""I hate conservatives but I f****** HATE liberals!""

On the one hand, you've got crazed Americans in red-white-and-blue jets destroying various world landmarks while chasing Osama bin laden look-alikes; on the other hand, the sneering directed at Hollywood and liberals in general (""...and they act all corporation-y..."") is far more visceral and emphasized.  Recommended to anyone on the right, and if you're on the left, you'd probably better skip this one.

James Taranto remarked on opinionjournal a few weeks ago that ""Team America"" is the only even partially pro-Global War on Terror movie made.  That got me thinking.  *I* certainly can't think of another one, but I can think of several anti-GWOT films (""e.g., ""Valley of the Wolf"") with a slough more of them right around the corner (e.g., ""Redacted"").

While watching this movie, I spent a good deal of time trying to figure out where exactly the comedy lies. What was I supposed to be laughing at? The dialogue isn't clever, but rather predictable and clichd. The characters are either stereotypes or archetypes drawn so broadly as to not even resemble anyone remotely life-like.

Nothing in the film was shocking or surprising. Even the sudden bursts of profanity had a ho-hum quality after watching South Park. The much talked about marionette sex scene was simply stupid and I can't believe it got so much press.

I'm somewhere to the right of Vlad the Impaler, so the old right-bashing left-bashing arguments so beloved of South Park Republicans (mostly libertarians) don't carry much truck with me. Rightist hypocrisy and false braggadocio are on full display here, along with over-the-top chuckle-headed nationalism an inch deep and an ocean wide filled with the tears of sentiment and absent boarders of reason. On the flip side, self-righteous Hollywood poltroons are given their full display, and no gasbag disappoints. What is more remarkable is how little the caricature of the puppets differs from the actual spew of their objects. Perhaps that is funniest of all.

This film makes full use of the liberty of comedy, employing and invoking the ancient rights of jesters everywhere to have no sacred cows. If you think of the film seriously, there is absolutely no way you can not be offended. If you enter into the Rabelaisian world of suspension of disbelief and watch the puppets become the morality play within the interior of the melodrama becomes evident. The admonition ""That which stimulates our senses but at the same time does not elevate our morals is pernicious"" is defeated by the exquisite combination of Rabelais, Satire, Machiavelli, and explosive plasticine.

Frankly, NOBODY gets off scott free in this movie---except, perhaps the cockroach who plays Kim Jong Il.

When it's mimicked by a puppet, anyone's behaviour looks stupid. Parker/Stone have little patience for the stupidities of our time (but you knew that already).  Using puppets let them give everyone their satirical lumps in one fell swoop.

This is a very witty parody on the war in Iraq, foriegn policy, the attitude of the American people, the attitude of the rest of the world toward the USofA, and of course know-it-all celebrities. All the while done with puppets with visible strings intentionally made to look so cheesy that one cannot help but be thoroughly entertained despite how seriously one's political views may be. Every action movie, every stereotype, and every possible political point of view is the target of ridicule here.
So this movie is not for everyone. It is not for the easily offended. As expected from Parker and Stone there is wonderfully crude and deliciously politically incorrect humor.

2218325,5,B0007LPLMY,"THE PLOT:

When terrorists appear with WMDs, you can count on Team America. With the squeeze of a trigger, the destruction of international landmarks, and their theme song blaring, ""Team America, #$%&@ , Yeah"" our heroes prove that America will always be there to help-sorta.

Knowing Team America must infiltrate the terrorists cell, they recruit Gary Johnston, a rising broadway star. But after a failed attempt, Gary leaves, his self-confidence in shreds. Now Team America must guess where the next attack will take place.

As evil mastermind Kim Jong Il sets in motion his international terrorist plan, Gary must now decide whether to give up and allow his loved ones to die or buckup and try to save the day, Duh?.

MY TAKE:

It's not often that I get to say that a film is both thoroughly despicable and very enjoyable. The words that spring to mind when describing ""Team America: World Police"" are raunchy, filthy, crude and offensive, but also witty, hilarious, fun and ""must see"" for some.

This non-partisan film skewers both sides of the political fence and will wreak havoc with the Moral Majority. I've rarely heard such ribald language off of a golf course. What also distinguishes this film from many other twenty and thirty something films is the most explicit puppet sex ever put on film. I almost felt dirty when I laughed until I cried.

What will save this film from being relegated to a dusty DVD bin is the witty and intelligent writing by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of ""South Park."" Not only is this film well balanced with a perfect blend of humor, cheesiness and drama, but the writing skill it takes to mesh all these into a seamless film that is both offensive and wildly entertaining is remarkable. Another saving grace is the puppets. One can get away with much more with puppets, especially marionettes. Their expressive eyes and facial features create just enough realism for emotional expression, but their movements (and thank goodness, their lack of anatomical correctness) separates them from animation and other mediums that strive for realism.

I would NOT recommend this film to those with easily offended sensibilities, nor those under the age of 17, but for ""South Park"" fans and for those who fall between the ages of 18-51, this film is a must see.",1168473600,5,2304,4.85969387755102

2218329,4,B0007LPLMY,"Team America: World Police is a madcap concept: lampoon America's current war-frenzied culture with marionettes.  Who would possibly want to watch such a film?

On the film's surface, the very appearance of the marionettes, being pulled by someone else's invisible strings, seems to have some symbolic value.  Or maybe they just thought it would be funny to have puppets do things that no puppets should ever do.

The movie also a throwback to Thunderbirds, a futuristic series produced in 1965 that heavily utilized ""supermarionation,"" which used marionettes suspended and controlled by thin wires. In that series, the marionettes were played with deadly seriousness, despite the fact that they were, you know, puppets. You have to ask why creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone would want to use a technique few people remember from the sixties...unless they were making a statement about an era that also happened to involve an unpopular war. Ahem.

It's very easy to dismiss Team America as farcical garbage, a lewd, violent attack on every sacred crow conceivable.  And on the surface, Team America can be appreciated for that alone: a conservative organization that espouses American values with unabashed patriotism sends Team America to blow up bad guys while destroying the homes and artifacts of the people they're trying to save; a liberal nutjob (Michael Moore) turns into a suicide bomber; Kim Jong Il really IS part of an axis of evil manipulating terrorists to blow up the world; actors with no experience in warfare speak out about the war, forming the Film Actors Guild (FAG); and a struggling actor named Gary is recruited from a Broadway musical that sounds suspiciously like Rent. Nobody is safe in Team America.

But anyone who watches South Park knows that Parker and Stone are far shrewder than their ""supercrappymation"" might lead one to believe.  They are the deconstructionists of our age, fearlessly criticizing hypocrites everywhere, whatever their political, global, or religious affiliation might be.  Only these two would compare a Middle-Eastern bar to the cantina from Star Wars...because frankly that's about the most exposure Americans have ever had to Middle-Eastern cultures.  Heck, even the title ""World Police"" is laden with assumptions about America's global responsibility or lack thereof. Even Matt Damon, whom Parker and Stone think is actually a pretty cool guy, gets turned into a monosyllabic thug.  Trust me, he got off easy.

They never let you forget that this is all done with puppets too: real black cats are substituted for panthers, puppets slap each other helplessly in some pathetic approximation of a fist-fight, and two opponents slow down and spin in the air as they face off, Matrix-style...all with the help of their marionette strings. And I don't need to mention what the puppets do to/with each other in the bedroom...
 There are also parts that are a little dated.  Yes, making fun of Ben Affleck in Pearl Harbor is always fun, but it dates the film.  Rent's also an easy target...but does anyone really care that much about Rent to make fun of it?

Team America mows down anything and everything with a no holds barred approach. If you take yourself a little too seriously, chances are you'll find this movie offensive or irrelevant.  But if you aren't afraid to laugh at the inanities of the modern world, as viewed through the seriously warped lens of big-budget action movies, then you'll probably enjoy Team America: World Police as a hilarious romp through a decade our descendants will most assuredly find amusing.",1167955200,3,3582,5.095726495726495
2218330,1,B0007LPLMY,"I guess it helps if one is a ""South Park"" fan.  I've never been.

Still, I was ready to give this every chance in the world to make a comedic, satrical, sarcastic, perceptive socio-political take on our modern times, even with cheap production values, even cheaper looking puppets, and little if no imagination or funny jokes from the beginning 10-15 minutes.  As this film ain't no 4 hour deal, finding nothing remotely interesting, let alone humorous or clever in the first quarter or fifth, I was amazed how just plain unimaginative and boring this was.

A film has to be really bad from the beginning for me to start fast forwarding within the first 20 minutes.  Usually by that time, I'm either willing to stick it out, or just give up.  This movie had neither quality.  By 20 minutes, my mind had thought of a hundred or so better uses of my time than this.  I skipped ahead only to find that to the end, there was no real brain food here.

While South Park has (deservedly so or not) a reputation for taking real chances, why I asked, was this all so lame?  Was it just the crap visuals, the various flat jokes, or something much deeper?  For while neo-libs have embraced South Park the TV series for its innovations and anti-establishment ramblings, while this movie seems a big screen attempt at the same, the corporate influence and underlying neo-con truth of the South Park folks takes over.  A quick buck.  Capitalism at its worst.  In movie form.  Yee-hah.  Blah...

What's most disturbing is that while this is supposedly supposed to be an indictment of sorts of blind patriotic American zeal and over-indulgence and arrogance, it ends up strangely justifying that very premise, and promoting it.  And while there is an overall criticism of recent US foreign policy, the ""bad guys"" still end up the same old ""bad guys"" as official US corporate media has sold us all along.  This makes the whole exercise lack not only sarcasm and satire, but right-on humor as well.

I had looked forward to seeing this, even though I hate South Park.  I had hoped that those folks would really let loose here, and the shame is that most people who'll end up liking this, will like it only for its South Park connections, but not for what the movie really is, or is all about.

A lot I'd bet will even take the final messages this delivers as somehow validating their faith in their seemingly leftist ideals.  The disappointing thing is that it does the exact opposite.  The creators of this obviously do not understand exactly what they're trying to present except to try to cash in on South Park trendy anti-establishment underpinnings.  Then again, I never thought South Park the series did (or does) that either.

The only decent thing about this bore-fest is a few slightly humorous self-referential PUPPET jokes.  Otherwise, it is not visually compelling or innovative, most of the humor and the social and political elements tend towards the far right view of modern day reality, and one mostly fast-forwarded viewing of this was enough for me to dismiss this as nothing more than a wasted use of some seemingly real talent here and there.

Again, as in most bad movies, the problem here is the writing.  I guess if you can get through the first 20 minutes or so without your mind wandering, you might get through the rest, then put watching this over again off for another decade.  I can't imagine any but a die hard and rich DVD collector actually wanting to own this.  It's basically just plain boring, what else can I say?

I wonder if the puppet presentation was cheaper than a decent animated and CGI rendering, and if so, there's another problem. This is cheap schlock which doesn't even seem to understand or comprehend its own preachings, and done seemingly on a shoestring budget.  This film never goes far enough, never.  It was evident in the first 15-20 minutes, and the disappointment throughout only reinforces that.

I wouldn't buy this at any price.  I wouldn't even want it free.  It's bad and boring from beginning to end.  There may be a short 10-15 South Park film here.  Stretched out to feature length, it is a way overlong and unenlightening, unfunny waste of time.",1167868800,22,4194,4.685362517099863

It is utterly amazing how often the satire is dead on the mark and how very close the dialogue and plotting is to the real big screen thrillers that it mocks.  If you pay attention you will notice  whole lines that are stolen right out of other films [such as Armageddon].  The last half of the movie plays like an impeachment of liberal Hollywood, painfully skewering various left leaning actors without mercy and finding creative ways of killing off each of their stand-in puppets.  Most of the celebrity puppets are dead ringers for their real selves [particularly Sean Penn]. It's hard to imagine that these film makers would have any friends left in Hollywood after the way they toasted tinsel town.  It's hard to imagine there are many from the other side of the aisle that would stand and cheer either, considering the distasteful jokes and unimaginably gross hyjinx.

It's all real fun and amusing.  However, it is the sickest, foulest, filthiest, most crude movie I have ever seen.  My mind's eye may never come clean.  This thing goes way beyond the normal gross-out teen comedy to nearly nudy-picture material.  Who would have ever thought that marionettes could be so vile and potty-mouthed and just plain disgusting?  I will never be able to watch a puppet show again; it would just be too painful.

Unfortunately, Trey Parker and Matt Stone seem to be addicted to vulgarity, and the flurry of f-words in their theatrical films would have made Richard Pryor blush. The few clever satirical points they made were overshadowed by the foul language, graphic sex, and gratuitous violence that was peppered all over the film. I was particularly turned off by the ridiculously long puking scene, as well as the homosexual encounter between Gary and his boss.

The fact that Matt and Tre are somewhat conservative in their outlook is, I think, due to their anti-establishment posturing, and in their little corner of the world (the entertainment industry) being liberal is definitely part of the status quo.

2218368,4,B0007LPLMY,"Team America - World Police is a very funny, yet immature movie. The film is an idea that hatched from the creators of South Park (Trey Parker and Matt Stone), and follows the same slap stick comedy that South Park is known for. The thing that really separates this movie from others in the slap stick genre is the fact the entire movie is done with puppets. The use of puppets takes this movie to a different level of funny. To add to the hilarity of the puppets movement are the songs, these songs are perfectly placed to keep the laughs going throughout the entire movie. The following conversation has to be the funniest of the movie:

Lisa: Promise me you'll never die.

Gary Johnson: You know I can't promise that.

Lisa: If you did that, I would make love to you right now.

Gary Johnson: I promise I'll never die.

The scene directly after this is of the two puppets, Lisa and Gary, making puppet love. That line coupled with the puppet love sequence is just hysterical. The ending of the movie is also a great sequence, the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G.), is used a lot, but only by the acronym. The last story that is used by Gary to win over the crowd is one that Gary picked up in a bar, with a few slight altercations, is one of the funnier, yet vile and inappropriate, dialogues that I have ever heard. Overall I do think this movie is aimed at a younger demographic and that many adults, such as my dad, would deem this movie as unwatchable.

The movie definitely deserves its R rating due to the excessive language and puppet violence. Although the language can be a bit much at times, it is something that South Park is known for and Trey Parker and Matt Stone seem to duplicate the South Park style.

2218373,5,B0007LPLMY,"This brilliant movie starts out on an inspiring note, with the destruction of the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. And then it just gets funnier and better. The puppets appear quite human so that there's no problem with the ""suspension of disbelief."" The heroes are quite fallible but very likable.

There's some spectacular cinematography in the Panama Canal scenes and in Egypt, where the Great Pyramid and the venerable Sphinx suffer the same fate as the Eiffel and the Louvre. The Mount Rushmore scenes, (HQ of Team America) are also impressive.

Gary is an actor appearing in a Broadway musical when the Team approaches him for help. One of the most gripping scenes is Gary singing lead in a rendition of the hit song Everyone Has AIDS. The camera catches the emotional audience as some individuals shed an elegant, politically appropriate tear or two. Priceless!

Things turn even more hilarious with the appearance of the Film Actors Guild (FAG), led by the silver-tongued Alec Baldwin. His speech, interrupted by rapturous desk-thumping by the assembled FAG-ers that include Susan Sarandon, Sean Penn, Jeanine Garofalo and a particularly DUH Matt Damon, is something to cherish. The media comments by some of these esteemed celebrities are equally hilarious.

Then there is of course the intercourse, a passionate scene between two attractive teamsters, giving new meaning to Leonard Cohen's album title Various Positions. This is just a short interlude; I didn't find it particularly shock- or noteworthy. People do get up to these types of trick in the grip of passion.

Kim Jong Il is definitely a star of the movie with his cute accent and his banally evil personality. I caught myself entertaining thoughts of sympathy for Kim as he fed Hans Blix to his pet sharks. And the feeding itself reminded one again of the awesome savage power of nature. ""Brix"" (as Kim called him) learnt a lesson for trying to impose his silly western cultural norms on the beloved leader of North Korea. What arrogance to attempt such a thing!

In the meantime, the porcine propagandist, also known as Michael Moore, has caused great damage at the Mount Rushmore HQ by blowing himself up with a suicide jacket. But when things look bleak, Gary returns as the hero. Kim is entertaining the FAG celebrities plus delegations of dignitaries from around the world. This is to distract them while his minions are preparing to set off 230 major bombs around the world.

Just in time Gary frees the team, then he uses all his skills as an actor and orator to deliver an eloquent speech that completely upstages Alec Baldwin, the master of ceremonies. The detonation of the bombs is averted and a fight to the death ensues between the Team and the Hollywood actors. A particularly sleazy looking Sean Penn meets his end at the fangs of a big black kitty cat, Sarandon is sliced in two and the others are shot in riveting gun battles.

My only complaint is that I sorely missed Parker and Stone's most lovable characters, the Canadian master comedians Terrance and Phillip, whose movie Asses Of Fire contributed so much to making the South Park Movie so unforgettable. A bit of Terrance and Phillip's flatulence and coprofilia would have made this little gem even funnier.

Easily bored, I don't like long movies. I am pleased to report that Team America: World Police is just the right length. No scenes are superfluous or too lengthy, and the action sequences are all in the right places. I think it is going to become a cult movie like The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The best songs are the aforementioned Broadway number and Kim's I'm So Ronery ...

Team America: World Police has a progressive and subversive message that ought to please everybody across the political spectrum, from the leftist moonbat to the conservative fruitcake and all people with a sense of humour inbetween. The Gnostic nature of Gary's speech with which he wins over the audience of worldwide dignitaries, is particularly striking. Underneath all the vulgar references to reproductive and other organs, there is a profound message to people who like to ponder these things.

I also strongly recommend Stone and Parker's South Park TV series, the movie South Park: Bigger, Better, Uncut and the CD Chef Aid. This talented duo's talents and wicked sense of humour are quite unmatched in popular culture today.",1149897600,,4364,4.923809523809524

Team America a thunderbirds like crew of police who are determined to destroy terrorism from the Muslims.

To most people this would be considered to be a racist attack on Muslims but that's not the case, it is merely a poke of fun at the way people look at Muslims since the start of the war and that is shown by how they speak in the movie because after all they are from ""turka turkastan.""

The Team itself are puppets worthy of Thunderbirds and it is very comical how they walk and did i mention the puppet sex scene? yes you heard me right a puppet sex scene which will have you roaring with laughter(That was when the wee came out).

It's just like the folks who accuse Fox News of being biased in favor of Republicans as if no bias ever existed before one little 10-year old cable news station popped up.

The movie does hit on some great points: liberal actors who pretend to know of an existence outside of their backyards, but actually know squat; and the phenomena of believing a leader's word when they say they have nothing that could kill us even while forbidding us access to search.

As far as the movie itself, I think it sucks. It's over the top in every way. There is one scene where one of the puppets vomits for an entire minute. Not funny in the least.

While I enjoyed the goofiness of this movie, the reason people should buy this DVD has to do with the extras on it.  Unlike most DVD's which have deleted scenes, or actors talking about their characters-- this movie had DVD Bonus Features which showed the actual set design problems, filming techniques used, and the thought that went into the design of the puppets.  It was very informative for people who wish to work in the film industry or just movie lovers who want a true feel for what it takes to film a movie (even one with puppets)!

This movie was fun in a dumb sort of way-- just as a satire should be.  It riffs on Hollywood liberals, action flick dialogue, and its depiction of North Korea's leader Kim Jung Il is a hoot.  It is funny to see how many people opposed this movie when it came out (Hollywood liberals, the North Korean government, etc.).

Indeed, comparison to Superthunderstingcar, the still breathtakingly brilliant 5-minute Dudley Moore and Peter Cook sendup of Thunderbirds from the mid-60s only heightens the film's shortcomings. Even the songs are at best only mildly amusing compared to the relentless comic genius on display in South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.

It's not quite as funny as Matt Stone and Trey Parker's ""South Park,"" but it definitely takes some wonderful shots at worldwide politics, the French, and the countless, mindless idiots from Hollywood who think that everyone should think their way.

The premise is simple, Team America travels the world stopping evil, whether it be Bin Laden or, as in this flick, Kim Jong Il.  They do so by literally blowing up everything in their path.  As the story unfolds, the team is duped by Kim Jong Il into seeking out multiple terrorist threats while he convinces the Film Actors Guild(F.A.G.) that he is actually seeking out world peace.  The F.A.G., headed up by blithering idiot Alec Baldwin, easily fall into his trap, not to mention the bulk of the world's leaders.  Meanwhile, at the Team America Headquarters inside Mount Rushmore, Michael Moore attempts to shut down their operations.

As all of this is going on, we are given countless humorous and smart shots at Hollywood and politics.  The comedy is both bitter and cutting.  Also, as with the ""South Park"" movie, we are given a few nice songs, most notably Kim Jong Il's ""Ronery"" song and the hilarious Team America theme.

Tolerance is always being screeched about by the schmucks in Hollywood, yet when they become the focus of smart humor, they get angry.  Perhaps they are the ones who need to learn a little about tolerance.

2218395,2,B0007LPLMY,"I once found a batch of anti-Soviet/anti-Communist California heavy metal albums issued by an obscure California label during the Reagan administration, which were funded by the FBI or CIA. This film may be another such project. Brilliantly filmed considering its intentions, clever in its tribute and debunking of ""Thunderbirds"" and grotesquely viotriolic about liberal Hollywood actors by decapitating and eviscerating bloody puppets of actors whose actual names, faces and voices are employed, Parker and Stone get extremely ugly and vicious here. A lot of actors are pompous and insufficently informed, but several of the victims here are not - and it should be noted that conservative actors, one of whom actually became president to enact his limitations and another who headed an organization that probably turned the 2000 election (the NRA), are unscathed in this work. I believe Alec Baldwin's brother is making Christian slasher films now, for instance. Given a choice of uninformed windbags, I'd take the liberal actors over the governing officials presently holding power; at least they don't run for office for, as Martin Sheen just said, ""I'm not qualified"". ""Team"" is also rascist, homophobic, misogenist, gross and even putrid, with the occasional twitch of the pinkie towards irony - 'just kidding' as a lame excuse for the offenses. Of course, Parker and Stone spare themselves - their film takes an elephantine point of view on global matters that pompously ridicules most of that world; anyone who disagrees is just dumb or worse a bomb-vested terrorist, like the Michael Moore puppet here. It would be a better film and might have more impact if it wasn't a sledgehammer in a too-small ironic glove. Randy Newman's song ""Political Science"" managed to do it all right in three minutes.

2218399,1,B0007LPLMY,"Is ""Team America"" a de facto propaganda film on the Iraq War and Bush administration's foreign policy for adolescents (and those of us with adolescent humor)?

It is certainly not a Leni Riefenstahl film or a Soviet style propaganda film by Dmitry Vasiliev. It is much funnier (which isn't hard since generally the Nazis or Soviets were not the funniest film makers to go down the pike). It also pokes fun at the Bush military.

On the other hand effective contemporary propaganda works far better if it appears to be even handed and incorporates humor. It does not have to be state sponsored but works well within the current corporate system of appropriating values for career advancement.

It is well known from interviews that the political stances of Parker and Stone are pro Bush. They poke a quick jab at the military's overzealousness. They then spend the rest of the film making inane jokes aimed at those critics of the Iraq war incorporating stunning political inaccuracies and not so subtle pro Bush cheerleading.

For those many still in denial over the reprehensible Bush Administration's crimes on the Iraq war (and other vital issues) or do not believe that propaganda is a fundamental force in the USA (and also not a conspiracy), I'd recommend Control Room and ""Uncovered - The Whole Truth About the Iraq War"", the award winning DVD ""Manufacturing Consent - Noam Chomsky and the Media"" and ""The Corporation"" (which overall, though tragic, is much funnier than ""Team America"").",1143158400,11,1494,4.964

As a true propaganda film, it pretends to be even handed, but with astounding politically naivety that generally elevates the right wing media generated Bush myth.

Parker and Stone are at their funniest however when they are skewering the beliefs of mainstream America.

Throughout the movie, Team America faces opposition at home in the form of a group of concerned hollywood actors known as the Film Actors Guild (FAG). Fear not though, liberals, because the conservative camp gets its share of lampooning as well.

This is because Alec Baldwin is the leader of the Anti-America group F.A.G.S (I can't remember what it stands for) and included in his group are Sean Penn, Susan Surandon, Tim Robbins, Danny Glover, Matt Damon, Helen Hunt, and a special ""gut-busting"" guest appearance by Michael Moore.  I loved it when Baldwin says ""The world needs people who understand politics, and that is us, F.A.G.S"".  Also, like South Park, alot of the humor is random and it contains some VERY EXPLICIT language and one VERY EXPLICIT sex scene...which is very disgusting and perverted...but still hilarious, since well, they are puppets.

One thing that made me start to respect this movie was the behind the scenes portion.  It included an hour or 2 of how they built the props for this movie.  The props were beautiful, and the designers put extreme effort into making it look so real.  Even the puppets were pretty realistic, and they were 3 FEET TALL!!  Crap, I thought they were only a foot tall when I first watched it.

Overall, if you love South Park/Family Guy humor, this movie is for you.  And if you love your beloved country America, you will watch this movie.  EnJoY!!!!

2218413,2,B0007LPLMY,"An animated film featuring marionettes rather than cel drawings and computer-generated graphics, ""Team America: World Police"" is that rare movie satire that leans Right rather than Left in its politics - although the sheer vulgarity of much of the imagery and dialogue may make it as detestable to conservatives as it is to liberals.  In a way, I have to admire a film that isn't afraid to offend people on either side of the political spectrum, but ""Team America"" simply isn't a very good film, offering little in the way of intelligent satire or pointed humor.

Written by Trey Parker, Pam Brady and Matt Stone, and directed by Parker, ""Team America: World Police"" involves a group of highly trained youngsters who battle the forces of global terrorism in the name of the good old U S of A.  Gary Johnston is a highly successful Broadway actor whom the organization recruits to go undercover and infiltrate terrorist cells in the Middle East.

The makers of ""Team America"" certainly show guts in being willing to exploit this sensitive subject for comic purposes, but they really go over the top in portraying Leftist Hollywood celebrities such as Alec Baldwin, Sean Penn, Matt Damon, Tim Robbins, George Clooney, Helen Hunt, Danny Glover, Ethan Hawke, Susan Sarandon and others as actually being on the side of the terrorists.  Heck, they even have Michael Moore blowing up a building as a suicide bomber.  It's one thing to attack these people for their politics, but it's quite another to portray them as sympathetic to mass murderers.  It also makes for lousy satire because it lacks the truth and precision satire needs to be truly effective.  It would be no less wrong if a liberal filmmaker were to do the same with the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly and others.  The targets also seem lightweight and skewed.  Why not go after the politicians who actually create and implement the policies that directly relate to global terrorism rather than a bunch of mouthy celebrities who really have little effect on what goes on in the world?

Still, this might have been palatable if the film at least had managed to be funny, but ""Team America"" really doesn't provide much in the laugh department.  The romantic relationships between the main characters are trite and silly, and the voiceover imitations of the real-life characters are poor in the extreme.  I guess this film works if you have an interest in incredibly graphic puppet sex, marionette projectile vomiting and the gruesome dismemberment and killing of some of filmdom's most famous celebrities.  Otherwise, I can't see much reason for watching it.

The Right might still manage to get an effective satire together someday.  But ""Team America"" sure isn't it.",1139356800,6,2745,4.947712418300654

Parker and Stone even topped Mel Brooks flatulent cowboys with a scene of the hero blowing chunks in an alley for so long, that I went from laughing, to being slightly bored, to laughing all over again.  This made the recent conceit that their TV show, ""South Park,"" was a conservative show making fun of liberals, into total nonsense.  No one was safe from a good sharp barb.  Macho Hollywood movies, liberal movie personalities, conservatives who seem to want constant warfare and be thanked for it were all sent up.  The closing theme song sounds like it should be played at football games, with it's vulgar patriotism, although it would probably offend some self-proclaimed patriots.  Toby Keith, are you listening?

I am one of those people who love the minds of South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, who you can tell the voiceovers are the same in the movie as the show if you listen carefully.

  My only complaint is with the DVD. I am part of the 95% of America that does not own a widescreen tv. So, considering the unrated version comes ONLY in widescreen, I had to live with the extra-wide bars, bars that even appear on widescreen tvs. I chose to live with that due to the unrated appeal. However, I was dissatisfied with my choice, as the unrated version is minutely different from the theater, full screen version. It only extends the controversial puppet ""love"" scene in a comedically gross way. THATS IT

  So, if you are like me, stuck with a regular tv, get the full screen version. It has all the same special features, same GREAT movie, and you won't have to live with those huge black bars on the screen.",1135296000,4,1036,4.369791666666667

Where things really fell apart was the sex scene with Lisa and Gary.  While marionette sex was pretty funny to watch at the beginning because of the obvious humor associated with making puppets move in strange positions, the creators quickly gave the Kama Sutra a run for its money, using every position and type of sex imaginable.  I was surprised by the golden shower, and another scene which I will not discuss, but the sexual defication was just completely disgusting. I cannot believe someone would put that in a movie, unrated version or not, marionettes or not.

 My advice is, that if you plan to buy the movie, buy the R rated version.  The unrated version adds nothing, unless you are into watching pupptets have bizarre sex.  If there are any kids in your house, be sure NOT to buy the unrated version. The movie has a superhero kind of appeal on the package and it looks like a movie which kids would throw in the DVD player if it was in the cabinet with the rest of the DVDs.

2218440,5,B0007LPLMY,"I was a fan of South Park a few years back, and the South Park movie was really the peak of the series popularity.  I used to love it, but slowly stopped watching it as the series really did run out of ideas a little.  Then I heard about Team America, as soon as I knew it was directed by Matt Stone & Trey Parker I had to watch it, and it doesn't dissapoint.

First thing to say is like South Park, the soundtrack is brilliant, I was literally pi**ing myself with laughter after hearing the theme tune the first time.  In fact you could get the soundtrack and laugh at that almost as much as the film.  The puppeteering is great and funny at the same time, the jokes are obviously a little childish, but if like me you laugh at that kind of thing, you'll enjoy this.  Other highlights are the undercover disguise, if you've seen it you'll know what I mean, but best of all is the puppet sex scene, you have to see this it is hilarious.

I see a lot of negative reviews below mine and i'm not really sure why.  As a non American I laughed especially at the opening scenes in Paris, as that is exactly how much of the rest of the world perceive the American Army.  Im not dissing America, in fact I love America but you have to laugh at the portrayal of America as shoot first ask questions later.  Basically if you liked Trey Parker & Matt Stone's stuff before you will love this, South Park style comedy, but with a political background (albeit jokingly).",1134086400,4,1456,4.242753623188406
2218441,2,B0007LPLMY,"TEAM AMERICA: WORLD POLICE is a film that'll be enjoyed by those with a penchant for the crude, rude, and socially unacceptable (not surprising since it was made by the creators of SOUTH PARK, Trey Parker and Matt Stone). And although I sometimes enjoy scraping the bottom of the film noir barrel, here the jokes were a bit too crude, rude, and socially unacceptable to be laughable. In fact, I only chuckled a few times.

What impressed me about the movie, though, were all of the marionettes (hundreds of them), the elaborate miniature sets, and the `I'm So Lonely' song sung by the Kim Jong Il puppet. You'll note that none of this has to do with the comedic script, too.

Making a good comedy-even a cheesy one like this-often requires gag jokes and good dialogue. And although there were tons of gags pulled off in the film (from watching puppets ""do it"" doggy-style, to having Kim Jong Il act like a gangster rapper), the dialogue was pure rubbish. I realize that it was making fun of action flicks, Americans and American actors' egocentricism, and just about every other world political state out there, but there needs to be some sort of reasoning to these things that gives the film structure. And this movie completely lacked any kind of coherency.

The other bad part is that none of the ""characters"" are memorable. Can anyone tell me the names of the Team America team without watching it again? I can't. And they are what the film is supposed to be about.

But, again, if you like watching such things as SOUTH PARK, you'll probably enjoy this movie on the same brain-numbing level.",1134086400,7,1596,4.669039145907473

Amazingly, except for their parody of ""Rent"", the entire film was way too serious and straight and the novelty of having marionettes wore off after a few minutes. I was bored. I sped through the end. Sorry.

It's tough because: a) You need a dirty word thesaurus to avoid filing a review with more expletives than an Andrew Dice Clay rant, and b) It's hard to work when you're constantly giggling to yourself incessantly.

""Team America: World Police"" is the anti-blockbuster. The characters are marionette puppets whose strings are in plain sight because it's funny. The voice-overs don't sound anything close to the celebrities and politicians they're representing, because it's funny. But much of the dialogue--with the exception of the cursing--could be pulled straight from any Jerry Bruckheimer film...because it's funny.

""South Park"" creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker offend everyone in ""Team America""--foreign and domestic leaders, conservatives and liberals, outspoken Hollywood mouthpieces and...outspoken Hollywood mouthpieces. But one thing they are clearly critical of is the United States foreign policy mentality of kick ass now, ask questions later. If there's a hell, Parker and Stone will be living in the penthouse.

But let's talk about the puppets. The marionettes look slick. When they speak, the movements of their mouths fluidly match their words. In other words, they put Milli Vanilli to shame. And the stuff that they can't do without herky jerky silliness, namely Kung Fu fighting and love making, comes off as so hilarious that it's almost too bad all movie actors couldn't be replaced by puppets.

Team America is a no-holds-barred freedom fighting force that's called in whenever there's an international emergency. They live in Mt. Rushmore, drive souped up super vehicles and wield rocket launchers. The team is led by Spottswoode, a debonair smooth talker with an ambiguous sexual preference. When one of the team members is killed by terrorists (who speak a broken record of ""Jihad bakakakaka""), Spottswoode recruits Broadway thespian Gary Johnston to ""act"" his way past the terrorists and infiltrate their treacherous network. Unbeknownst to Team America in the beginning, North Korean leader Kim Jung II, is secretly supplying terrorists with WMDs. Kimmy is probably the most hysterically rendered---and most un-PC character. I can't give out more information without committing a hate crime.

While Team America takes out their targets, they also take out many people and international treasures that aren't their target, a.k.a collateral damage. They take out the Eiffel Tower, the Sphinx and thousands of innocent puppets. And when they do, they draw the ire of the Film Actors Guild (an acronym I don't need to dwell on...but one that ""Team America"" does). An obviously spoof on the Screen Actors Guild, it comprises Alec Baldwin, Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon and other celebrities who use their notoriety as a political soapbox. Of course, now, actors are using their notoriety as a soapbox to speak out against ""Team America"" in some sort of ironic countermeasures. Confused? Me too.

If you don't know anything about ""Team America: World Police,"" when you step into the theater, you'll be like a rich kid on Christmas morning. You'll get every damned thing you want, from hot puppet sex to gory puppet deaths, playful songs with illicit lyrics and more. No strings attached.",1132444800,6,3295,5.302681992337165

The basic STORY is that Kim Jong Il is plotting with terrorists to destroy the world; His plan includes enlisting many Hollywood actors (because of there terminal naivete, thinking that he will bring peace) to help him. Hey that's actually half way plausible-Hollywood loves dictators and murderous thugs like Castro; but this is not a serious movie; it basically makes FUN of everything and every one (poor Matt Damon). The movie is worth it alone, just to see how the Hollywood stars, puppets, meet there demise in such funny ways. I must also say the weird sex scene in this movie is totally disgusting and disturbing and well very funny-but not for kids. And You have got to see the scenes where team America misses there mark when firing at terrorists with missiles, just HILARIOUS. Also the way the puppets move around is crawling around on the floor funny and when the puppet's are in real scenic places, well, its just too funny.

At times of stress sometimes what is needed is some relief through our funny bone.

Of course the guys who created this movie pushed the envelope.  That is their style.  There is something for everyone to get offended at.  Unfortunately their wit will be lost on some folks, but it wasn't on me.

The depiction of the Hollywood loudmouths that think they could run the country better than our elected officials, yet most of them don't have a college degree was probably the most amusing for me. But I also enjoyed the blowing up of Michael Moore, the blowing up of France, the broadway show rendition, the puppets themselves and the props.

The first thirty minutes of the film was great since it not only had the Thunderbird feel but with more edge and more hard core on the action sequence.  The film then subsequently faded and dragged on with the story meandering on around the lead character.  I was most disgusted with the love scene since it was irrelevant to the film but felt it was created just to turn people off.  I could do with vulgar but it was also crude for me and very repulsive.

Overall a very credible effort from the makers since it is really hard work putting together a feature length film with marionettes but their jokes and treatment may work fine with a thirty minute cartoon, it became quite unbearable when it went beyond an hour.",1128297600,5,944,4.365714285714286

2218485,2,B0007LPLMY,"I'm a big fan of South Park, but Matt Stone and Trey Parker's films are really running out of gas. The puppetry and sets in Team America are pretty spectacular, but Stone and Parker's usual themes of bashing celebrities, raunchy sex and huge volumes of bodily function humor are wearing very, very thin.

A lot of reviewers are getting just a bit too hysterical about the actor bashing in Team America. They're overreacting. Stone and Parker are hardly the shiniest pennies in the pile when it comes to satire. The Simpsons' writers, for example, satirize their subjects with much more wit and intelligence and that show is now in its 16th season. Parker even all but admits in one of the DVD's extras that he has a blanket hatred of all actors. It's pretty telling that none of the actors bashed in Team America got into much of a snit over their portrayals. Parker and Stone, while having some talent, are pretty nasty and unpleasant people and I'm sure that the actors satirized in Team America recognize that and take their criticism for what it is.

The only reason why I'm criticizing the actor bashing at all is that Stone and Parker keep using this and other themes in every single film they make. They're always bashing Hollywood (especially Alec Baldwin). They always have graphic sexual content. There's always enough foul language to make George Carlin blush. And there is always an abundance of toilet humor, including urination, defication, vomiting, farting, etc. Now I certainly don't mind these things if they're done with some originality -- Bigger, Longer and Uncut's first half hour was hysterically funny. But there's no originality in Team America's vulgarity. The flatulence scene in Blazing Saddles was inspired. The zipper scene in There's Something About Mary was hysterical. However, the humor in Team America is just tired rehashing.

Maybe, in a strange way, Parker and Stone are funnier on South Park because on television -- even cable television -- there are some limits on content. In that medium, the two have to use more imagination and more true wit to get around the censorship to make their point. In Team America, however, Parker/Stone aren't subject to these restrictions. As a result, they think that flat-out vulgarity with no originality or wit alone will make the audience laugh. This time, it just doesn't work.",1127692800,9,2356,4.9294710327455915

One of the factors here were that we can see the strings that gear the flick's marionette puppets. You get used to that rather quickly. A group of anti-terrorist world fighters lure celebrity Gary Johnston to join forces with them to stop future terrorist attacks. They eventually end up battling the notorious North Korea's head dictator Kim Jong II (just this dork's voice alone makes you want to kick him the face). Several twists and unexpected scenes. Without a doubt, the most memorable (or most morbid scene) depending on the way you think was the sex scene between show biz celebrity / performer Gary Johnston (voice by Trey Parker) and fellow Team America agent Lisa (voice by Kristen Miller). Almost surprised they didn't bring in handcuffs, a donkey or the bathroom sink. Also, most of the tunes in this feature pretty much sucked, except for two.

2218489,2,B0007LPLMY,"The first half hour of the first South Park movie was one of the funniest half hours I have ever seen on film.  It had me laughing so hard I hurt my ribs.  Team America had a lot to live up to.

There are some big laughs in this one too.  The single funniest laugh is during a love scene between two of the Team America members, where these puppets are doing everything to each other short of getting out the whips and chains.  At first the scene is just funny, but then it gets so stupid and hysterical.  I'm not going to tell you what they do to each other.

It has to be difficult to maintain the energy and humor over a full length movie.  The first South Park movie couldn't do it, but gave us an amazing beginning.  This movie doesn't rise to those heights, ever.  Despite having maybe about a dozen really funny parts in it, it really didn't keep me entertained enough to give it a rave review.

One thing I give it credit for is being completely ""politically incorrect"".  It is the most right wing comedy ever made, and any reviewer who claims otherwise is lying.  To say that this is even handed or middle of the road is just a flat out lie.  It is as right wing as it can be, to the point of ridiculing every left wing actor they can think of and describing them all as fags.  This movie is Newt Gingrich on ecstasy.

I don't care.  Comedies are supposed to make you laugh, so who cares what political position they take.  It had me laughing out loud a bunch of times, but overall I can't really give it more than about 2 stars.  Maybe 2 1/2.",1127174400,6,1552,4.147651006711409

on the upside, the movie features lots of puppet violence, explosions, and a sort of graphic marionette sex scene (i mean, it's as graphic as a sex scene can be when it features dolls with no genitalia). and kim jong il's solo ""i'm so ronery"" is hilarious. overall, though, watching this movie made me feel embarrassed on behalf of stone and parker. if you want to watch a movie by the talented creators of south park, rent orgazmo. orgazmo is awesome.",1126828800,7,1273,4.534782608695652

Parker and Stone can also be given marks for originality by the whole theme of the movie which is a spoof of action movies using marionettes a la Gerry Anderson.  The bad side is the same thing that made the South Park movie disappointing.  The fact that they milk one joke over and over again for 90 minutes.  In South Park it was cutesy cartoons swearing, in Team America it's puppets swearing, killing one another, etc.  A puppet using the F word is a pretty dang funny idea the first few times you hear it, but grows stale very fast, like back in school when you'd ask some chick if she wanted to join the Pen15 club.  It's got it's share of clever sequences like the Montage spoof.  The Team America theme song is  a funny spoof of the kinds of theme songs you'd hear in 80s cartoons like GI Joe.

The writing did have potential to be effectively witty, but it fell flat in the medium of marionettes they chose. Choose any other medium; cartoons, stop action puppets, CGI animation or even live action. Any of those would have worked beter than these crude, simplistic marionettes. Let's face it, I'm not going to empathize with these nondescript pieces of plastic. It's just not that clever. Even as marionettes go, these were badly designed and badly operated. I think true professional puppeteers will hang their heads in shame at this movie.

This movie was surprisingly tame and unimaginative for an unrated and uncensored movie. Cut out a couple brief scenes and bleep out the obscenities like in South Park and you've got a PG-13 movie.

The topics of terrorists, jingoistic conservatives and Hollywood liberals have been dealt with many times over in the South Park series and movie. This is a stale rehash of those topics. They can work in a 22 minute TV show with characters we care about, but not when stretched into a 98 minute movie with puppets we don't care about.

The South Park guys employed some worn out topics and a bad medium when they made this movie. This is about the only outright clunker they've produced.

A pretty naive viewpoint (and I assume that Trey Parker and Matt Stone have some lame justification for their own status as opinionated entertainers).

That said, however, TA is one of the funniest films I've ever seen, and a remarkable technical accomplishment, right from the brilliant opening shot.

This has got to be the most obviously ridiculous snipe hunt in video history.

Now, I'm the first one to agree that there's a Hell of a large liberal minority in Hollywood. As a VFW Lifer, I'm the first one to agree that much of what comes out of Hollywood - even now, with the post-9/11 hysteria that has the US jumping every time a bus backfires - is VERY liberal, and very patriotism-bashing.

BUT, it's nowhere near as virulent as this farce would have us believe. AND, while I love what it does to Michael Moore, I'm not sure Alec Baldwin or Susan Sarandon are anywhere NEAR as evil, self-serving, or just-plain-gullible as these guys make them out to be.

The main problem with the movie is that, unlike South Park, it is in fact full-time exasperatingly stupid and bullying.

Sad to say, but the creators of South Park have become what they profess to hate.  There is nothing that they enjoy more than graphically killing off celebrities who have the temerity to offer political opinions.  Yet now we have Stone and Parker, as celebrities, bloated with entitlement to set up straw men to mow down.  With their present celebrity status, their opinions are becoming more obnoxious than humorous, more bullying than incisive.

Caricaturing celebrities is one thing, but grossly misrepresenting anti-war opinions is another.  Parker and  Stone rather shamefully depict anti-war people (in this case a collection of anti-war celebrities) as not only against the war, but as actively fighting for North Korea against America!  This message is pretty much in line with the neo-cons straw man approach: character assassination for simpletons.  The net effect is to make the pro-war crowd feel good about themselves, fostering a belief that being against the war is traitorous.

Too bad.  I hope in the next movie they kill off the most bloated and opinionated celebrities in George W. Bush's America: themselves.",1124668800,11,1429,5.219298245614035

The action flick satire is brilliant, especially as Team America sets off on mayhem and destruction in the name of police work, often causing more damage than the bad guys were going to do!  Your take on the war commentary will most likely depend on your personal views.

I'm rating this film high because I admire it and I think there is an audience for it out there, but on a personal level, I thought it was drawn out just a bit too much.  It might have been better as an extended skit or a smaller bit, not a full length feature film.  South Park is superior humor and modern political/cultural commentary, in my opinion.",1124064000,3,1092,4.640625
2218531,5,B0007LPLMY,"This is one of the stupidest funny movies out there.  When I say stupid funny for se ""Kung Pow"" not ""Office Space"" type funny.  The movie is a superficial political satire, no deep thoughts at all.  I can see that some of the far left might find it too harsh, since Matt and Trey did blow up their hero Michael Moore.  I am moderate left, myself.  Yup, America is an aggressor today, so were the British and French when they were superpower protecting their own financial interests.  History always repeats itself in different situations.  I thought it was great that they also made fun of actors and actresses, whom many never went to college, but seem to know more then everybody else in world politics and economics' working.

Kim Jong Il should win the Oscar for male supporting cast; he is ridiculously hilarious, like 911x1,000 of Saddam Hussein in South Park the Movie.  The puppet acting is one of the best and facial definitions are done very well.  The scenes are done very well, but don't believe that the Eiffel Tower is next door to the Arc de Triomphe, etc.  The movie is actually quite short and moves very fast.

There is no need to analyze the plot or storyline here, since it is for pure laughing entertainment.  No need to get all up tight here also.  Great for a rental and even good enough to own.",1123977600,5,1318,4.506329113924051

I loved the idea, however, of making a Marionette movie wiht plenty of explosions and setting things set on fire, but the movie just left me unmoved.  It was flat, forced, and not at all funny.  I was expecting Trey and Stone to take the low road for most of the movie, but I was expecting some cerebral humor.  It just doesn't live up to South Park.",1123718400,25,509,4.489130434782608

Neither the Bush government nor the Israeli government face any substantial critical commentary, while Arabs are represented on the whole as brainless psychopaths and anti-war activists as not much better.

I must say that I am/was a fan of South Park, and I even laughed at Orgazmo.  But this was not funny, indeed I'd be surprised if anyone bar the more jingoistic sections of American public found it so.  I really can't see the joke in it.",1123545600,13,661,4.7043478260869565
2218534,4,B0007LPLMY,"If you're a South Park fan, then you'll likely get a kick out of this movie. Parker and Stone have done another good job of combining harsh satire with awkwardly moving characters to create a no-holds-barred politically incorrect comedy. I think it's fair to say that everyone in this movie is insulted at some point, although the self-righteous Hollywood crowd gets special treatment from the directors, along with the tyrannical dictator of North Korea, Kim Jong-Il.

What was particularly impressive about this film was the ""acting"" and facial expressions on the puppets. The design of these figures was very well-done and are an integral part of the movie. Also very funny and creative are the songs written by Parker and Stone, which are as important to this movie as the music is for South Park Uncut.

The extra features included with this DVD are also quite interesting. Particularly noteworthy is an interview with the designers of the Kim Jong-Il puppet who talk about how they created the face and even the process they went through to pick his eyeglasses.

The language and subject matter are quite colorful, so I would not want my kids in the room while ""Team America"" is on...adult audience only!",1123113600,4,341,4.762711864406779
2218538,5,B0007LPLMY,"You are in for a wild ride with this bullet ridden, gory, riotously funny and politically absolutely uncorrect puppetshow, where a gung-ho team of tough-as-nails cops seriously kicks the butts of terrorists and their celebrity supporters. Trey PARKER and Matt STONE, the men behind the infamous SOUTH PARK animated TV series, have created a true masterpiece, which can be enjoyed on a variety of levels.

Yes, there is lots of very rude humour - all stories you have heard or read about are true. There is indeed an XXX rated sex scene in it (surprisingly graphic, and while watching it was easy for me to see why this particular scene had to be recut several times in order to avoid a NC-17 rating for the movie's theatrical release; this DVD however is the uncut version and so a warning is possibly in order: some brief parts of that scene are of a nasty nature, yes, even though it is with puppets). And the dialogue is so over the top explicitly offensive, there is an almost poetic quality to it.

What struck me most however was how much effort went into TEAM AMERICA. Clearly a work of love of all involved, the movie and its ""characters"" never look cheap. There are lots of very large and incredibly detailed miniature sets (my favorite being KIM Jong-Il's palace). In fact the film has the look and feel of a multi-million dollar action extravaganza. And granted, you will love the puppet characters. Not only are they exceptionally well characterized (you will even find yourself rooting for KIM Jong-Il, when he croons his ""I'm so ronery"" song), their acting (so to speak) is very convincing. These puppets have facial expressions (the filmmakers used animatronic devices to move lips, eyes and eyebrows) and lip movements match the dialogue. In fact, there are not so few real life actors, whose acting is more wooden than that of those puppets.

Dialogue is also great. Granted, there are some weak jokes (e.g. KIM Jong-Il having difficulties pronouncing ""inevitable"" and a returning gag to the effect of ""It will be 9/11 hundredfold."" - ""That's 9100.""), but the movie is full of memorable lines, my favorites being ""I've got five terrorists going southeast on Bakalakadaka-Street!"" and ""Hey terrorist! Terrorize this!"", followed by a lethal bullet. The excellent soundtrack adds immensly to the fun - the aggressive ""America! F**k yeah!"" team hymn, a nice country ballad appropriately titled ""Freedom isn't free"", the aforementioned ""I'm so ronery"" and a self-referential one called ""Montage"" (acccompanying a ...well, montage of puppet character Gary during shooting and martial arts practice), to name but the best.

I mentioned earlier that TEAM AMERICA can be enjoyed on a variety of levels. First of all it is a fine action comedy in itself. You will also have fun guessing all the various movie references, which range from James BOND flicks, the 1960ies THUNDERBIRDS TV series, big budget actioners of the Jerry BRUCKHEIMER variety to KILL BILL VOL 1.

Unsurprisingly, in a movie concerning the war on terror, there is a political subtext. Sure, one could argue that is nonsense in the given puppet context, but I think otherwise. There are a few scenes which are definitely not funny, but rather frightening and moving (e.g. the floating ""corpses"" after the attack on the Panama Canal). We also see the leader of a rogue state harbouring and arming terrorists and - like in real life -the UN is a powerless papertiger (cf. the dialogue before UN weapons inspector Hans BLIX is fed to the sharks). Contrary to what many critics wrote about TEAM AMERICA the film does not ridicule the war on terror - on the contrary. Amidst all the puppet violence and sex, the fun and the jokes (and despite the abundant collateral damage TEAM AMERICA creates) the movie clearly shows that the war on terror is worth fighting.

TEAM AMERICA is presented in an outstanding DVD edition, excellent in all technical aspects and loaded with great extra features. The making-of featurettes are among the best I have ever seen. It is hugely interesting how they built the large sets, designed the puppets, made the costumes, operated the marionettes and did the impressive stunts (one featurette is about the miniature pyrotechnics). It took lots of research for many aspects, particularly for the interior of KIM Jong-Il's palace. Trey PARKER and Matt STONE comment on their movie. In my view they both seem even now a bit surprised how their project evolved and became bigger and more elaborated as they went along with the film. And again, it is amazing how much effort went into the movie. For instance, the prop man had to create four different designs of the glasses the KIM Jong-Il puppet wears!

There are also some deleted scenes (I really wonder why they did not enclude the martial arts fight between Gary and the North Korean soldiers in the final cut of the movie, as it looks very cool) and animated storyboards. Two trailers of the film are present as well, as are three for other releases (the LONGEST YARD remake, COACH CARTER and the fifth SOUTH PARK season).

Simple. You have marionettes...wait,I don't think I can get away with mentioning what Parker and Stone do with them here. You just won't believe it.

2218540,4,B0007LPLMY,"You may disagree with me, but 'Team America -- World Police' is NOT the best thing Trey Parker/Matt Stone have ever created.  It is still Eric Cartman, or any characters in 'South Park' which should be called their best, but, well, like most reviewers before, I find 'Team America - World Police' mostly funny.

I said, 'mostly,' for some parts are definitely unfunny, but I'll talk about it later.  Inspired by a UK cult TV show 'Thunderbird' made in the 60s, the self-appointed marionett rescue team save the world from the terroists.  Of course, that's a satire, and the target is the current US policy, but Trey Parker doesn't stop there.

[MAKING FOOL OF ... EVERYTHING]  Yes, don't think about the politics.  Michael Moore (I mean his lookalike puppet) appears, but the purpose of his inclusion here is, it seems, not political but very personal, as if Trey Parker (who was briefly in 'Bowling for Columbine') has some grudges against him.

Anyway, 'Team America' makes fool of the right, the left, or everything it thinks deserves bashing.  The film's story itself is mocking Jerry Bruckheimer films, in which an all-American boy is made an all-American hero after many struggles (read actions) and some pains (read booze) before he gains the big prize (read love, or a chick).  Which means the film includes a 'love scene' of the marionetts, of which reality would be embarrassing to some.  And you can hear a song stating the quality of one Micheal Bay film and the acting abilities of Ben and Cuba.

[HOLLYWOOD STARS] And what is most daring (and outrageous) is the special appearances of the Hollywood celebrities, who are, according to the film, too politically aggressive.  It's easy to imagine that Trey Parker doesn't like those actors who express their views on politics in the programs like 'Crossfire' or the magazines like 'Rollingstone.'  Unfortunately, however, this is the least satisfying part for me, because, quite frankly, these marionetts just don't look like the real counterparts.  Alec Baldwin looks more like his brother Daniel, and other lookalike puppets are no better.  (Interestingly, George Clooney's puppet appears, but he receives comparatively better treatment among the final action scene, in which those ""celebrities"" turn baddies and meet nasty fate.  And Clooney is a known 'South Park' fan, and appeared there.  Maybe Trey Parker didn't bring himself to treat him bad, even a puppet.)

Technically, however, the marionettes of the main characters  are fantastic (especially those of 'Lisa' and 'Gary'), with their subtle facial expressions which look often so uncannily real.  And also very impressive is the national leader of North Korea, where this film would be banned forever with good reasons.

I enjoyed watching 'Team America' though it often goes too far, and still I like 'South Park' better, both TV series or the filmed version.  And surely 'Team America' has political aspects, but you don't have to offended with them.  It's just a comedy -- a comedy to which nothing is sacred.  Enjoy it as such if you can.",1122681600,6,3066,5.023762376237624

Most everything concerning the war on terror is ridiculed:  terrorists, the military, war protestors, intelligence, WMD.  Private contractors and the president are spared.  The humor works because the movie takes everything to a ridiculous extreme.  Team America destroys the cultural icons of every country they enter.

The first part was actually done very well and was funny in parts, especially the way-over-the-top sex scene.

The essence of comedy is exaggerating the truth. But this fraudulent comedy exaggerates lies. That's the difference between free speech and propaganda. This is propaganda.

In particular, individual film stars and directors who campaigned against Bush were dishonestly characterized, and basically lied about. These jerks were portraying anti-Bush campaigners as pro-terrorist and pro-North Korea. This is simply trying to put over a lie, masquerading as satire. NO Bush supporters were even mentioned, no less lampooned. I hope all of the misrepresented people are suing these lying writers' butts off. This is like something that PRAVDA or TASS would have produced during the Soviet era. I popped and trashed the DVD even before it was over. I WANT MY MONEY BACK.

2218554,5,B0007LPLMY,"(This review was written in front of a live studio audience.)

Have you ever been in the awkward situation of having to explain a joke to someone, at a party or some such? Whether it's because they're too stupid to follow a Neanderthalically simple premise or just too drunk, blatant, hit-you-in-the-face satire fails to make an impression because you aren't literally hitting them in the face yet. I say yet, because this situation is infuriating if you've ever been in it. Your two options: endure the painful cries of ""I don't get it"" and ""why is that funny"" and ""look at me, I'm a lamp,"" or actually explain and simultaneously ruin the joke for them.

You know, it's frankly amazing to me the sheer number of people who honestly don't ""get"" this movie. Just saying so makes part of my brain do a double take at myself, wondering if I'm just a ""feelm"" snob or if everyone else is just an idiot.

Then I come to my senses. Everyone else is just an idiot.

Let's see, what are the main complaints about Team America: World Police surfacing like raw sewage in the tank that is Amazon?

1.) ""The satire isn't ""deep"" enough, or completely nonexistent."" Why? Because it isn't rendered in Swiftian prose style and swaps some subtlety for the occassional PENIS joke? Well, whatever. If it existed (which would be hilarious), I'd recommend the Team America novelization for you more ""literate"" bitchers.

Perhaps the junior novelization.

2.) ""The LANGUAGE ruins it!"" No it doesn't. You're just uptight.

3.) ""This is not a movie your kids should watch! I was fooled by the presence of puppets on the cover which my mind equated with harmless children's fare because I'm an uninformed idiot on par with the very people this movie is making fun of some of the time. Oh also, the title had 'America' in it so I thought it would be edutational for my children. Shame on Matt Stone and Trey Parker for being so deceptive!"" Honestly, are you just living under a rock with a computer hooked up to the internet? Good lord.

4.) ""The puppet sex scarred me for life and this movie should have been rated XXX."" It was strange and nonsensical and lighter than the softest softcore porn. Given that puppets possess no genitals, which seem to be the deciding factor when it comes to rating film based on sexual content (the degree to which they are shown), any perceived pornography in the infamous puppet sex scene was filled in by your already-corrupted mind or that of your teenager who ""shouldn't be watching this movie in the first place."" So yes, you/they are no longer innocent and have not been for quite some time. Also, you're a freak for enjoying it enough to call it porn instead of a F*CKING JOKE.

5.) ""The 'plot' is insipidly boring, predictable, and almost nonexistent! I turned it off after 30 minutes of fast forwarding at 300x on my DVR!"" Apparently, one can't get away with making boring, predictable crap if they are not Jerry Bruckheimer or Michael Bay and doing it in complete seriousness.

6.) ""This movie is part of a vast right- (or left-) wing conspiracy and should be crucified and burned as the free speech-masquerading propaganda it really is, and anyone reading this can rest assured that should I bully my way into becoming president/dictator of this great nation I will do just that to anything I disagree with!"" Gee, I'm sorry you're a delusional reactionary fool with no sense of humor, who, for whatever reason, is renting or buying comedies with clear political substance. Did you just pass out before the ""big explanation"" at the end? Moreover, if you stayed awake, did you NEED that explanation but fail to understand it regardless? Actors and anti-Bush campaigners are not portrayed as ""pro-terrorist"" by this movie by anyone but you and your worrying brain. They're simply portrayed as ignorant p*ssies who don't know any better.

To summarize, why do people hate this movie? They didn't get the joke.

And they never will.

If you are conservative, you will be equally offended by the way this film makes American foreign policiy look like ape-posturing and tears what we think of as American culture (Walmart, NFL, Burger King, etc.) a new ace hole.

2218564,4,B0007LPLMY,"First of all and as it is announced on the cover of the DVD, this movie comes directly from the creators of `South Park'. So you can expect to see in this movie the same humor and irreverent jokes that gave fame to the show. The idea for this movie came up as a way to make fun of the Jerry Bruckheimer films, in which everything is action and we get to see things exploding all the time, and in the most crucial moments of the film, action is interrupted with a sentimental thing; well, all those things are here and believe me, you'll never see a Jerry Bruckheimer film the same ever again (if you get Parker and Stone's sense of humor) The idea of using puppets came from the creator's hate to actors, something they explain in the additional documentaries on this DVD.

The story opens with Team America saving France from a terrorist attack with a weapon of mass destruction, one the members dies and it is time for them to find a replacement: an actor (wait till you listen to the reason, hilarious)

From the very beginning the movie surprises with the level of detail of the scenarios and the characters, the production is unbelievable. Also we get to see that behind all the fart jokes and the simplest humor, there is always a sharp critique to the so called `American way'. Team America decides what's best for the world, even if that implies destroying every place they visit. Also the `Film Actors Guild' takes its share of critique, actors trying to pose as figures of influence are not an invention of these guys (Matt Damon is simply one of the funniest characters in this film); Michael Moore is also present in a fatal moment for the team. But the most interesting thing is to see Kim Jong Il portrayed as the villain (the song he sings is one of the most memorable moments of the movie); it is told that he is an avid movie collector, it would be interesting to know if he owns this movie and his opinion about it, but hey, these are the same guys that gave Jesus Christ a TV show! Can we expect them to respect someone? I don't think so.

The musicals are present (even Broadway appears on the movie), the way the use the dramatic music is amazing (check it out when Gary vomits) and makes these moments even funnier, the dialogues are crazy (the foreign characters don't talk a thing and instead say things like `Ping pong' or `Derka derka muhamed ali') and the voices are as funny as the ones in South Park (most of them performed by Trey and Matt)

The awkwardness of the puppets is the best humor resource used in this film, the way the puppets walk is way too funny (and this is done intentionally), the characters pointing at things and then missing, the `help signal' Gary has to make when he is in danger, all of those are quite simple things that will make you laugh it up.

The movie is presented with English 5.1 surround, English and French 2.0, subtitles in English and Spanish. The documentaries included in relation with the making of the movie complement perfectly and explain the reasons behind the making of this movie and the whole creative process.

The most amazing thing about the movie was that it actually had a storyline which was quite complete and didn't leave any blanks which some movies tend to do. Second, it had some twists that kept you hooked. It was a great idea to make the Film Actors Guild (FAG) act on the side of the bad guys.

If you're a South Park fan, don't think that this will automatically mean you'll like this movie.  South Park is fast moving with some depth and wit.  This film, despite being 3D puppets, is flat and wouldn't know wit if it blew it up (which happens a lot in this movie).

Trey Parker gives voice to Gary/Joe/Kim/Blix/Carson/Drunk/Damon/Robbins, with along singing, directing, and being crew on this film. Matt Stone only has 2 characters Chris/Matt Damon. But there are other characters that are not voiced by Trey or Matt, Lisa (voice of Kristen Miller), Sarah (voice of Masasa), Spottiswoode (voice of Daran Norris) , I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E./Chechnyan Terrorist (voice of Phil Hendrie) , Alec Baldwin (voice of Maurice LaMarche), French Mother (Chelsea Magritte) , Jean Francois (voice of Jeremy Shada) , Samuel L. Jackson (voice of Fred Tatasciore) . There are more characters/voices that were not credited, and the best website I can think of to check them out is the Internet movie database. The set up is that a puppet named Johnny Carson is killed in action, just moments after asking his girlfirend, Lisa to marry him. The main boos, or the boss Mr. Spottswoode, spots an actor named Gary Johnson in a play that is a musical named Lease, where Gary has a song titled ""Everyone has aides"".

2218584,1,B0007LPLMY,"Witless, insipid ""satire"" is about as subversive as Samuel Huntington.

A few chuckles here and there, but the political message (and there is indeed a message, make no mistake) is paternalistic, fawning, almost fascistic: the state will ""protect"" you from the monsters under your bed, and those who disagree are ""aiding the enemy"".  It will accomplish this through the cleansing power of violence, which in turn will rid the world of violence.  Or something.

Definitely a goofy idea, and definitely worth satirizing; unfortunatley, that's not what they did.  They suggested rather a ""middle way"" between limousine liberalism and ultra-nationalism, as though Alec Baldwin represents the extreme left-wing of the political spectrum.

Only in America.

Without belaboring the point, the film's thesis shares more than a little in common with philosophy of Kim Jong Il, although the confused lads responsible for this mess were probably unaware of this at the time.

Should appeal to teenagers and those who get their news from CNN, but people looking for something with teeth/intelligence/daring  would be advised to look elsewhere.

Does anyone else remember when satirists used to challenge authority instead of embracing it?",1120521600,10,1226,5.439153439153439
2218585,5,B0007LPLMY,"I was slightly disappointed the first time I saw this film - probably because I was so hyped up about it, having heard so many people talk about how hilarious it was.  My second time through it, though, everything clicked.  Team America: World Police is juvenile and disgusting, yet sharply pointed satire that goes out of its way to be offensive - in other words, it's hilarious, and yet more proof of Trey Parker's genius.  Parker and Stone do things no one else would ever dream of doing - or even be allowed to do.  It's a film I know I know I will enjoy watching time and time again for years to come.

Hilarity aside, the audacity of making such an elaborate film using puppets is almost mind-boggling.  Parker and Stone probably had little idea of what they were getting into, yet they stayed the course, brought together a tremendous team of individuals who, as the special features make obvious, relished the chance to take the art of puppetry to new heights, and created something that is really quite amazing.  It's uncanny how life-like these puppets are - I daresay Alec Baldwin, for example, is much more wooden in real life than is his puppet in this film.  These aren't just wooden characters dangling on strings; each puppet's head is filled with animatronics that control his/her expressions with uncanny precision.  The puppet fights are hilarious, but nothing's funnier than watching Gary give ""the signal"" as his first mission with the elite American fighting force goes south.

As with everything Parker and Stone do, there's actually a point behind all of the humor.  Though their detractors would never admit it, these guys actually do have a handle on what is going on in the world - and within America.  If you've ever seen South Park, you know how quickly they manage to exploit the big issues of the day.  No one is safe from these guys' political humor, but the Left does tend to suffer the brunt of the satirical attack in this film.  (Those who say Parker and Stone are suddenly outright conservatives have obviously forgotten their short-lived series That's My Bush - which was the only unfunny thing they've ever done.)  Team America itself takes America's military might to obvious extremes, as when they pretty much destroy Paris in order to stop WMD-toting terrorists (of course, no one seems to consider the fact that the terrorists would have destroyed Paris to an even greater extent themselves had their plan succeeded).  Alec Baldwin's ilk, though, suffers most because they have two Stone/Parker targets on their back.  One, they are soporific liberals who would stop terrorism by sympathizing with the enemy and commiserating with their extreme anti-American views over tea and crumpets; two, they are actors and I think Parker and Stone really mean it when they say they hate actors - it's one of the reasons they chose to make this movie with puppets (plus, one of the original inspirations for the project was the idea of doing a parody of today's action films).

I don't think I need to describe the movie, really.  Kim Jong-Il (even though he does sound a little too much like Eric Cartman, at times) is a great character, of course, but you probably know all about the film's story by now.  It is true that Parker and Stone push the envelope (actually, they just tear it all apart and rush right on past it) at times - especially in the puppet love scene and the vomiting scene - probably just to prove how much they can get away with, but you just have to expect that sort of thing from these guys.  It's one of the things that makes them Parker and Stone.  Let's not forget the songs, either.  From the heart-pumping theme song to Kim Jung-Il's loneliness lament, Team America World Police features a great soundtrack (be sure to go all the way through the final credits in order to hear a final little snippet from Kim Jung-Il).

If you're easily offended, you'll probably be holding your nose higher and higher as you watch this film (even while those around you are bent over holding their stomachs with laughter) - but that's okay because the rest of us need someone to hold our popcorn while we struggle to regain our breath.",1120435200,3,4181,4.703703703703703

2218588,4,B0007LPLMY,"Firstoff, I agree with the reviewer that said basically ""No **** this isn't a kid's movie."" I'd like to add that, even if you didn't know about Southpark etc, who the hell takes little kids to see a movie called ""Team America: World Police""? Did these people even bother reading the title? Or did they just see puppets and without using any mental capacity at all jump straight to ""puppets... -> kids!"" Oh, and newsflash, puppets aren't to today's kids as they were to  you as a kid anyhow.

Anywho, as the title states, I found this movie to be quite funny but goes too far in places. I don't mean too offensive by quality. I mean by quantity. Off the head example... ""America, F**K YEAH!!!"" is pretty much all you need to get that point across in that song. The rest (while potentially funny) is going to just be filler. The ""when we come for you"" part was funny, but the whole ""Lick my butt and suck on my balls"" is redundant. We already got the point (and cracked up), but thanks.

This is common with offensive/funny shows/movies though. It's hard to walk the line without teetering to either side. It didn't keep me from liking it in this case though (obvious by my review). I was laughing through most of the movie even if it was sometimes psuedorandom laughter stemming from previous moments in the movie. (I loved when the guy ""acts"" his way into a terrorist hideout. That was great.)

If you're easily offended by crude jokes, don't watch this. If you don't like your beliefs being satired, don't watch this. And, while the title should make it clear for many of you your beliefs are going to be made fun of, be sure even if the title sums up your opinion of politics, you're still going to be made fun of. That's one of the things I like about this: it's equally irreverent to everyone. If you like or can ignore crassness and still enjoy yourself, this movie will probably have you in tears.

I'll put it this way: I wouldn't call my grandmother (upper 60's) a prude or prissy by any means... but I would say she comes off as... aristocratic. She told me she saw this movie over the internet one day and I immediately thought ""Oh God... >.<"" only to be surprised with ""It was extremely humorous. It was a bit... crass in places... but I enjoyed it.""

This movie is intelligent in it's satirical portrayal of worldly  and everyday events. I was crying I was laughing so hard at times. The puppeteering is brilliant and the characters are perfectly stereotyped.

And the funny thing is, it works!  The very first scene starts with what looks like cardboard cut out landscape and a horribly acted puppet and I was like OH MY GOSH this is gonna be horrible, only to have the scene pan back and open up to a vast view of (an Americans view) of Paris, and was wow'd immediately by the detail placed into this movie....

Oh yeah, and by the way, the movie is HILARIOUS!  Its good to finally see Trey and Matts original version in this uncut and unrated version and gotta say this is some of the most hilarious visual and verbal comedy there is, and this rates right at the top of funniest movies of the year.

There were also quite a few complaints on the scripting of the film. Keep in mind this film was supposed to be a parody of itself. Then entire movie was shot and made to mimic one of those awful Jerry Bruckheimer (or however you spell it) movies that follow the same formula over and over again. ex. The Rock, Con Air

Also, in response to the idiot that was defending Hollywood actors I have a statement. Hollywood actors are actors, not politicians. The only reason people listen to them is because the media gives them that power. These people don't have the qualifications to consider themselves as experts in global issues. They are just a bunch of hippies whose ideals are unrealistic and shallow. What I find hilarious about Hollywood is that if one idea becomes even remotely popular there, everyone seems to latch onto it for dear life. Of course I'm speaking in generalities, because I'm sure there are a few actors in Hollywood that are decent human beings.

Anywho, this movie was great. It made fun of all points of view, which is what I believe was intended.

This film is a distillation of the inane, the stupid, the ignorant, and the bigoted insular idiocy of our society, precisely the characteristics of American society that bring about Anti-American terrorism in the first place. So what do we do with that distillation?  Just enjoy it.  Like the emporer Claudius said (as played by Derek Jacobi) let all the poisons that lurk in the night hatch out!! Let the poisons of nationalism, fear and crude understanding of the outside world just rise to the surface. Whether Parody or Policy that's all we have.

More attention is given to the left than I expected, but there is some truth in how the F.A.G. confuses their celebrity status for an expertise in international politics and economics.

I thoroughly enjoyed the main character's broadway performance (AIDS!) and the final showdown between Team America and the celebrities.  Team America dispatches the celiberals in a disgusting yet hilarious fashion after they make their escape from Kim Jong-Il's fortress.

2218608,4,B0007LPLMY,"Team America is a crude, bizarre and militantly un-PC look at the War on Terror. The technique of the film, using puppets whose strings are clearly visible throughout the movie, is a study in itself. The obvious suggestion, whether intended or not, is that all of the players in today's global situation, from terrorists to gung-ho American military types to peace activists, are basically puppets acting out mindless roles. Despite its humor, Team America presents an extremely cynical view of the world. Nor is it, contrary to the opinions of some critics, without a clear-cut ideology. While both the ultra-macho Team America and the left wing peace activists are sharply satirized, the film clearly comes out in favor of Team America, who end up saving the world. The hero, actor Gary Johnston, delivers a crudely funny speech at the end which actually presents a surprisingly coherent, and nearly persuasive justification for American foreign policy. In fact, I would have to say that it is the best defense of this policy that I have seen or heard thus far, though I should confess I am no fan of Bush and recent wars. This gives me a grudging admiration for the movie --that in the midst of its absurdity and gross-out humor, it actually does a better job of explaining current military policy than our so-called leaders and most of the mass media. To summarize, without using the film's obscene language (which would be unprintable in any case), the argument is that America is violent, responsible for much destruction (in the movie, Team America blows up, among other things, the Eiffel Tower and the Sphinx) and basically amoral, but the terrorists who it opposes are far worse. Where this film succeeds in defending this rather simplistic doctrine, while politicians and media columnists fail, is the extent to which the movie scours its heroes. Instead of John Wayne and American Flags waving to the sound of sappy patriotic music, we get a bumbling military team headed by a closet homosexual, while the patriotic music in the background is a vulgar rock and roll number.

  Team America does have notable weaknesses. The left-wing Hollywood actors (who belong to the Film Actors Guild, or F.A.G. --Team America is hardly above high school humor) are parodied beyond any degree of credibility. They are essentially portrayed as idiots who can barely speak a full sentence, while Michael Moore turns out to be a bomb-wielding terrorist. This complete lack of any subtlety betrays a lack of confidence and imagination on the part of the filmmakers. There are certainly enough valid ways to satirize self-righteous Hollywood activists without parodying them beyond all recognition.

  One thing that is interesting about Team America is that it ends up subverting its own position (which, for all I know, may have been the filmmakers' real intention). While it does make a strangely convincing argument that the world needs the kind of shoot-now-ask-questions-later sort of heroes portrayed in the film, it also provokes some seriously subversive questions, at least for anyone who is able to think beyond the South Park mentality of the movie's surface. If the spirit of Team America is akin to the actual soul of modern America, what does that say about how far we have strayed from the ideals upon which this country is supposed to be based? Some critics, such as Roger Ebert, have attacked the movie's nihilism. As I see it, the film is actually reflecting a nihilistic spirit that is very much a part of today's political landscape. If a cartoonish movie, seemingly aimed at teenagers, comes closer to revealing the true nature and intentions of our leaders, uttering truths that more serious commentators would never dare to, isn't that something that needs to be addressed? If a violent, amoral nihilism lies at the heart of today's society, we should not blame moviemakers for showing it to us. Team America, if nothing else, does us a service in this regard. Plus, to be honest, it's just plain funny.",1119052800,5,4021,4.985096870342772
2218609,5,B0007LPLMY,"Apparently not. Matt Stone and Trey Parker have always been geniouses at making the most offensive, pushing the envelope comedies ever. My favorite genre of movie is comedy. My library may not be strong, but trust me, I have seen just about every comedy ever made. The one star reviewers say that the jokes are old and out-dated. I was wondering, did you and I see the same movie? I have never seen or heard these jokes anywhere else. if anyone can tell you that accurately, its me.

This movie is hilarious. Its got great satire and bashes whatever it can. Some people say it lets conservatives off the hook and focuses mainly on bashing liberals. Well, you know what? Matt and Trey have been making fun of conservatives longer than liberals. If any of their creations prove that, it is definately the South Park movie. That was thier conservative bashing movie, now this one is the liberal bashing movie. I won't explain the story, because a lot of people have already written reviews which explained it, so go read thier's if you really want to know what its about.

The movie generally pokes fun at the film actors guild, or F.A.G. It makes fun of all the actors who try and act all ""liberal"" and protest the war. The most noticeable among others, is Michael Moore. Well, all I can say about that is, I am glad somebody had the balls to make fun of Michael Moore, because he is really f**king annoying with his stupid pointless movies.

The movie is funny, in general. And the plot isn't very bad either. I just don't like the whole romance thing thrown in here. its kind of gay. Then again, in one of the special features, Matt Stone did say, ""I am very shocked to see that our crew is so focused on making this movie. Just a gay little script we wrote, and to my suprise, everyone is taking it so seriously.""

Which brings me to my next point: Special Features. There are a lot of them to keep you busy, and are in fact, pretty imformative and interesting as to what it took to make this movie.

They make fun of just about everyone and everything as we witness the brash, macho antics of Team America during its pursuit of terrorists, weapons of mass destruction, and the hilariously-portrayed North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Il.

People of both liberal and conservative persuasions will find a great deal to laugh at in this film, while the only people liable to not be laughing are the various Hollywood stars who come off looking like know-nothings and self-important losers.  Alec Baldwin in particular has earned the ire of Parker and Stone, culminating in an exploding-head sequence that left me rolling on the floor.

Like ""South Park"", this movie is NOT for kids.  It's foul-mouthed and graphically sexual (yes, Supermarionettes can be sexual!  Just watch!!) with an endless downpour of gratuitious violence.  But then, that's the point, as the creators themselves concede in the special features when discussing the genesis of this script and its journey to the silver screen.

2218620,4,B0007LPLMY,"If you're tired of the seemingly endless parade of tired genre films, adaptations, and remakes coming out of Hollywood these days, Team America: World Police may be just what you need to shake you out of your bad movie-induced slumber.  Coming from Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the twisted minds behind the enduring classic that is South Park, Team America is a bloody, profanity-laced, sexually perverted comic romp of a movie, the kind sure to offend prudes and morality police everywhere.  Not to mention, all the filth, violence, and depravity that this movie contains (and there's plenty of it) occurs against the backdrop of the grandiosely titled War on Terror, as we witness the enduring struggle between America and its enemies played out on the world stage.  Yes, Trey and Matt have devoted an entire movie to delivering their own skewed take on the battle that has captivated Americans for almost four years now.  And they've done it all with a cast consisting entirely of marionettes.

Arrayed on one side is Team America, standing alone to police the world and defend freedom from the fanatical terrorists who seek to bring down civilization.  Their skills are unparalleled, and they're aided by a vast array of special ""valmorphanizing"" weapons and vehicles.  Consisting of a former All-American quarterback, an empath, a psychologist, and of course the finest martial artist Detroit has to offer, Team America is an elite group made virtually unstoppable by the guidance of their no-nonsense supervisor Mr. Spotswood and the omniscient supercomputer I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E..  They travel the world seeking out their enemies wherever they may hide, and causing lots of nifty explosions in the process.  Sure, the French and the Egyptians may not appreciate Team America's efforts too much when they blow up the The Louvre and the Eiffel Tower in the former country and the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid in the latter, but hey, somebody's got to take responsibility for keeping the free world safe.

After a member's death in the movie's opening sequence, Team America is forced to look outside the group for help, and Spotswood manages to find them the perfect weapon: Gary Johnston, a ""maverick renegade"" of a Hollywood actor with a degree in theater and world languages that will enable him to infiltrate the deepest corners of the terrorist underworld.  Gary is such a convincing actor that his made-up tale of suffering at the hands of the American infidels brings tears to the eyes of even the most hardened terrorists.  And while he initially doesn't want the guilt, shame, and responsibility that come with his position, by the end he's undergone such a transformation that he's willing to service his boss in the name of freedom.

On the other, darker side of the equation is Kim Jong-Il, the diminutive Korean dictator plotting a terrorist strike that will be equal to 911 times 2,356 (do the math).  Parker and Stone really did their homework when it came to portraying Kim (they confess to being fascinated by him in the DVD's special features), and what comes out is sort of a combination of Eric Cartman, Josef Stalin, and a bulk-rate James Bond Villain, with the accent of the Chinese restaurant owner from South Park.  Kim cuts a menacing figure, and clearly has no qualms about cold-blooded murder, but as we learn in one of the greatest songs in movie history, he's really just ""ronery"" (i.e., lonely) and smarting from a lack of respect.  In other words, he's the kind of movie villain you love to hate, only a lot funnier than most.

Perhaps even more ominously, though, Kim has enlisted the aid of ""secret weapon"" Alec Baldwin and his parnters in the Film Actors Guild (in case you can't figure out the acronym, it's prominently mentioned and displayed on numerous occasions).  Led by Baldwin, the Guild is composed of the kind of people who truly understand global politics, namely famous movie actors who can read newspapers and then repeat what they've read as though it's their own opinion.  World-class whiner and useless troll Michael Moore even makes an appearance as a hot dog-waving, mumbling domestic terrorist.  Unfortunately, Kim's devious mind formulates a fiendish plan to use the Guild to further his plans to throw the world into chaos, and only Team America can stop him.  But first, Gary & Co. have to overcome the dark secrets, resentments, and hidden and unrequited loves that threaten to tear them apart.

So, what works in Team America?  Fortunately, just about everything.  South Park long ago revealed Parker and Stone as insightful social critics as well as top-notch filth merchants, and Team America ultimately proves to be a fast-paced and consistently hilarious examination of world politics when it's not brilliantly spoofing the action-movie genre.  South Park has seen Parker and Stone generally leaning to the right of center of the American political spectrum, but they've also show a willingness to take the piss out of anyone's deeply held beliefs, and this movie is no exception.  Those on the left, those on the right, and those who just plain hate politics should find a lot to laugh at here.

Early on there's plenty of mockery of American ignorance and arrogance: Gary's ""transformation"" into an Arab terrorist consists of little more than sticking some dark hair plugs on his face; the Panana Canal is described as ""2,193 miles south of the real America""; team members gleefully blow up priceless buildings and monuments and expect the natives to be grateful.  There are also some transcendently stupid parodies of the trite jingoistic anthems that sprung up in droves after the September 11 attacks (""Freedom Costs a Buck-Oh-Five""; ""America, F*** Yeah."").  About halfway through, though, the movie shifts gears and launches into a sustained assault on the ""elites"" of Hollywood and the U.N..  Of course, since Stone was once quoted as saying ""I hate conservatives, but I really f***ing hate liberals,"" this should come as no surprise.  In one rather telling moment, famed weapons inspector Hans Blix exemplifies the impotence of international governing bodies when he tells Kim that refusal to disclose North Korea's weapons program will result in an angry letter from the U.N..  And of course, there are countless sendups of the ignorance of Hollywood liberals, with Tim Robbins babbling incoherently about corporations and Matt Damon saying nothing more than his own name.

Now, none of the above would matter if Team America weren't an uproariously funny comedy, but it succeeds wildly on that score as well.  The political humor often takes center stage, but there's still more than enough of the explicit banter and graphic imagery that fans of Parker and Stone have come to expect.  The sex scene between two marionettes has gained much of the attention that this movie generated, and rightfully so: at about two minutes in length, performed to the tune of an appropriately wretched power ballad and filled with positions that are just plain wrong, it's more than worth getting the uncensored edition for.  If you're weak of stomach you may want to take a bathroom break during the extended vomiting scene, though.

An any rate, by the time Team America ends with a brutally funny and surprisingly accurate summation of America's role in the world that's far too explicit for me to repeat in this space, it's clear that we have a comedy classic on our hands.  In an age of rampant political correctness and the looming threat of censorship from the sorry likes of the Parents Television Council and similar busybodies, it's good to see someone (or someones) pushing the limits of good taste and creating something intelligent and truly funny in the process.  Increasingly sanitized and enstupidated fare may be the norm coming out of Hollywood now, but in such a climate films like this one only stand out even more.

'Everybody', it turns out, mostly includes Kim Jung Il. (One would expect the easier target, Bush, to at least show. No such luck.) Since it is difficult to properly ridicule the North Korean dictator, whose evildoings are only vaguely familiar to the American audience, the burden of satire turns to the supposedly univeral Asian tendency to mispronounce all 'L's as 'R's. (I so ronery. I have pran.) For nearly half an hour, what seems to be the bulk of the movie is spent repeating that one joke--200 times or so, and the joke goes from old to sadistic to simply tiring. The last third of the plot consists of head explosions and dismemberments, in their full bloody glory, of anti-war Hollywood stars, one at a time. These scenes may succeed in entertaining either middle schoolers who consider any form of cruelty the highest form of funny, or right wingers who attain to masturbatory revenge on all Bush critics. It is disturbing to see the creators of South Park-and not Bill O'Reiley-equate all criticism of Bush with terrorist membership. Making fun is one thing, misinforming people about an honest cause is another. (In a public letter, Sean Penn shrugged off the ridicule, but invited the creators of the movie to join him on a trip to war zone countries. Witnessing real people getting their guts blown to pieces may not be that funny, after all.)

How did I know the F-bomb would go off every other line?  However, I found myself chuckling, laughing, and then rolling on the floor with mirth.  What a takeoff on the obligatory movie skin scene, hilarious.

Any film that lumps Michael Moore, most of the Hollywood actors of liberal persuasion, and France together with Muslim extremists and Korean Dictators has to be commended.

2218637,5,B0007LPLMY,"After seeing this, you may be somewhat surprised that creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone were able to avoid getting the Salman Rushdie treatment from the forces of international jihad in response to their 90 minutes addressing Islamofacism. The whole thing is a puppetpalooza as the entire film is composed of puppets who are able to do everything that real people do including projectile puking. There's not much of a superficial South Park feel to this film as the plot more closely resembles the old Maxwell Smart vehicle, ""The Nude Bomb"" than anything offered weekly on Comedy Central.  The Mission Impossible backdrop goes so far as to even have a even a master computer named ""I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E."" and a Mount Rushmore command center for Team America.

Yet, the satire will be quite familiar to those who watch South Park and more amazing than anything one can readily imagine.  The war on terror is a great vehicle for these guys to make fun of just about every one on the planet (humanity can be broken down into the simple framework of a--holes, p-ssies, and dicks here).  There are silly songs and killer lines throughout.  Their send up of the play ""Rent"" is one early example.  Now it's entitled ""Lease"" and the theme song is ""Everyone has AIDS"".  We hear such lines as ""come on everybody we've got quilting to do."" More jingles like, ""America: F--- Yeah!"", round out the film and it becomes the Team America theme song.

Obviously, any story these guys tell is just a surface mechanism for them to ostentatiously display their unworldly wit which is just fine with me. The gratuitious romantic plotline is present; although, the resultant puppet sex is something beyond description and is more like something from a German scat trailer than anything you'd see from Sandra Bullock or Keanu Reeves.

Overall, I found Team America/World Police to be masterful. The Screen Actors' Guild is now called the Film Actors Guild which lends itself to the uproarious acronyn of F.A.G.  It is led by the king poseur himself, Alec Baldwin (who, by all rights, should be a Canadain citizen by now).  Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, and Jeanne Garafalo also figure in heavily.  They are all self-righteously opposed to Team America and become the unwitting dupes of the terrorists and the totalitarian dictator of North Korea...much as they have in real life.  F.A.G. is quite similar to the Hollywood organization, ""Not in Our Name.""  Parody becomes dangerously close to reality in this film.

My favorite part was the skewering of the fat b-stard, Michael ""Giant Socialist Weasel"" Moore.  He turns into a suicide bomber which is something that many of his ideological opponents would have wished upon him years ago.

The portrayal of Kim Jong-il is nearly equal to that of Parker and Stone's 1999 efforts with Saddam Hussein. He's a singing, screaming, plotting dictator right out of Austin Powers.  It's great fun and might be the only punch that the world ever lands upon the North Korean menace.  I'm grateful to the makers of Team America and hope that they create a follow up at least half as politically damaging as this one was.",1117929600,5,3133,4.888468809073724

Team America is about the ""World Police"" and their relentless pursuit of WMD's.

2218652,4,B0007LPLMY,"If the sight of marionettes having sex offends you, then Team America: World Police has done its job, and what a job. A silly spectacle from the South Park guys rifling on everything from Jerry Bruckheimer films to world politics, Team America effectively turns every cliche and genre on its termite-infested ear.

You want action? Team America delivers. You want romance. Team America delivers. You want to see Susan Sarandon tossed from a skyscraper? Team America doesn't just deliver, they deliver air mail. Creators Trey Parker, Matt Stone and co-writer Pam Brady don't have any one target on their radar. They toss as many poison pens as possible at the screen.

Team America, with it's gorgeous, detailed miniature sets captured in all their widescreen glory by Bill Pope, is the film equivalent of something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue. Resurrecting the 1960s camp of Gerry Anderson's Super-Marionation series as The Thunderbirds, Stingray and Fireball XL5, Team America adds an exaggerated new spin to the convention.

The filmmakers literally borrow dialogue from other blockbuster films, which in context sounds more authentic coming from a marionette, and then add a blue streak guaranteed to make members of the ratings board swallow their gum.

What emerges is a film that takes itself very seriously, at least in the first half. The filmmakers understand the films they are spoofing are already preposterous and pretentious, so instead of playing into that trap, they work around it. Even at its most outrageous, Team America plays it straight. Even the musical numbers, oh yes, there are musical numbers, are presented with utter conviction.

Like their destructive heroes, the filmmakers take no prisoners. They shamelessly take on everyone and everything, leaving no sacred cow un-tipped in their pursuit for a laugh. Their wood creations aren't just joints and wires, they have emotions and back story. The film's larger-than-life villain ponders his lonely existence, while the film's reluctant recruit, a Broadway actor named Greg Johnston, is still recovering from an unexpected family disaster.

Johnston is brought into the fold of Team America: World Police after their leader is killed by a terrorist in Paris. Team America may have leveled Paris in the process, but at least the charred streets of the City of Lights are safe again. Not so for the rest of the world, when evil despot Kim Jung II advances on his equally evil plans, forcing the Team to recruit Johnston to portray a terrorist and infiltrate the movement. The logic behind this decision is so insane it seems logical.

South Park still remains one of the funniest, bravest and most relevant shows on cable, and creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone continually prove their well is far from dry. Their first feature, Bigger, Longer and Uncut, viciously skewered censorship, effectively arguing through the mouths of foul mouthed fourth graders the people who hand out movie ratings are more concerned with sex than violence.

True to form, Team America, which depicts enough mindless violence and crimson paint to fill several Michael Bay films, ran into trouble because of a simulated sex scene between marionettes. So the lesson we take from this is blowing off a head is okay, but engaging in a sex act using the same word is not. Parker and Stone were tailor made for the ratings board, two overgrown frat boys who not only dare to push the envelope, they shove it into a paper shredder and make up their own rules. The filmmakers may revel in toilet humor, but at least they give us a courtesy flush.

The sex scene aside, Team America is top heavy with naughty bits guaranteed to either tickle your funny bone or snap your spine in half. The filmmakers understand the inherent humor in making a big-budget action film with marionettes, and when faced with the intrinsic limitations of the medium, use them as part of the gag. You can't help but laugh at the absurdity that these slow moving, limited-motion marionettes are the stars of an action film. At least their emotions are in check.",1117584000,5,4114,5.0293685756240825

It's like watching a couple of 15-year-old boys under the influence of pure Id who have gotten hold of their little sister's Barbie collection, and gone hog wild.

The film not only lampoons action movies, it takes no prisoners in its treatment of loud-mouthed Hollywood liberals like Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Alec Baldwin, and George Clooney--all actors I enjoy watching, by the way--who present themselves as experts on world politics and in this movie become dupes for uber-Terrorist Kim Jong Il, spouting pabulum about ""corporate America,"" and ""environment.""

2218656,3,B0007LPLMY,"This is by no means a bad movie. While this has a pretty decent storyline, it is too silly in some respects to be considered a credible movie.  Furthermore, there is a bit too much offensive material to make this movie accessible to everyone.  It is true that someone will most likely always be offended by some movie, but this movie carries it just a bit to the excess.  What makes the offensiveness worse is the fact that this is a movie that stars puppets.  It isn't even real characters.  When you associate puppets and cartoons, you see them as fictional characters living ultimately in a very fictional world.  Therefore seeing puppets in a real atmosphere doing human things makes this movie unbelievable to some extent. Of course, it is important to remember this movie was created by Trey Parker, the same person responsible for the incredibly risque SOUTH PARK, which also takes cartoons to never before experienced teritorry with excess of sexuality, cussing, and etc.

This movie aims itself towards teens naturally because adults aren't going to be into puppets yet with its raucious themality (esp. an over-explicit sex scene), it isn't for younger children. It is an odd situation.  The story line, anybody has to admit, is somewhat funny, though a bit over the top.

2218657,4,B0007LPLMY,"People are taking this film too seriously. It was completely Apolitical. The films main targets appeared to be hysteria, self-importance, pumped up aggression, mindless blockbuster entertainment, and the human propensity for thinking what everybody else thinks because it's less daunting (and more self-righteously rewarding) to do so.
There was a long overdue attack on the deluded mindset of certain celebrities who - not content with being idolised, paid more than many third-world countries entire economic budgets, fortunate enough to do a job that's not back-breaking but interesting and exciting - presume to tell the rest of us (mortals) how we ought to think. How it must hurt to see their ego's punctured using the very medium that inflated it.
The film was not homophobic either, it merely ridiculed the piety of those who like to wear their 'compassion' on their sleeves (or their lapels to be more accurate). Of course Aids charities need highlighting, but we have tons of celebrities here in Britain who would hardly lift a finger for a starving third-world child, or dying cancer patient, but fall over themselves to attend red-ribbon events - with every two-bit fame junkie declaring; 'I've lost so many gay friends', as if this transparent (and probably exagerated) declaration about their social circle were somehow cast iron evidence of possessing a maverick free spirit.

To give you an idea of the type of humor, it's fair to compare it to Mike Myer's Austin Powers movies.  If you liked Austin Powers, you'll probably like Team America, but it's not for kids or seniors - or normal people.  It has about an order of magnitude more filthy language and sexual humor, not just inuendo.  Yes, much of the humor is sophomoric (perverse and repulsive), but there is also much very funny satire, and the whole thing is ridiculous because they're just puppets, and that made me and the whole audience laugh as much as anything.  Much has been written about the film being homophobic; that's just nonsense, propaganda put out by Hollywood types who are offended by the very funny satire poking fun (violently) at the puppet versions of their friends Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, Matt Damon and others.  The movie also lampoons right-wing secret government agencies, and the whole homophobic thing is about homosexual acts of the head of the agency - to me it seemed pro-gay.

There are ethnic stereotypes that were last used when Jerry Lewis was young, and some slipping actors that are grateful to have their names mentioned on screen.

I don't really care what the political leanings are of Trey Parker, who makes fun of everybody on all sides.  What really makes this film, though, is the puppets.  I have never seen a puppet movie like this before.  An action movie a la Bruckheimer with puppets is hysterical, as the puppets can only dangle and crash into each other during fight scenes.  The sex scenes are shockingly funny, too.

There is something here to offend everybody.  It's not for every movie goer, and definitely this is not a family movie.  But I enjoyed it, and it is now one of my guilty pleasures.

The DVD has some wonderful ""making of"" scenes, showing how the puppeteers made the film come to life.  Watch closely for the ""found objects"" in the various locales, such as dollar bills used as palm leaves.",1117324800,,854,4.633333333333334

2218663,3,B0007LPLMY,"Much of the ""Team America: World Police"" discussion has focused on its politics. Some have called it pro-war, others anti-war. Some have called it both. The creators insist it's neutral. In the end it seems the movie will confirm whatever political bias one has going in.

However, something else is more important: ""Team America"" isn't funny enough to live up to the hype. The sheer novelty of an all-marionette cast is certainly worth some humor points, but ""South Park"" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone don't come near the standards set by much of their previous work.

The plot of the movie is amusing if not dynamite. The culturally insensitive Team America goes around the world, blowing up monuments without regret in their search for WMD, and in the end our heroes save the day for real...kind of. The Film Actors' Guild (F.A.G.) is a group of liberal douche-bags, but its members are clearly provoked by the destruction of the Eiffel Tower, the Great Pyramids, etc. F.A.G. members include Alec Baldwin, Sean Penn, Janeane Garofalo, Martin Sheen, Tim Robbins and Samuel L. Jackson.

Sure, there are some killer jokes here and there. But most of the best scenes have already been released via commercials, clips ([...] had several lengthy scenes) and reviews. And stupidly, the creators posted all the song lyrics online, taking away perhaps the movie's strongest element. ""Everyone has AIDS"" and ""Ronery"" are sure to become classics (the latter track, sung by Kim Jong Il, is somewhat racist - the lyrics use as many ""L""s as possible, which Il sings as ""R""s), but by the time fans get to the theater nothing is left to the imagination.

Except, that is, the mythical puppet sex scene. Reportedly, it took several tries for the filmmakers to avoid an NC-17 rating. In interviews they've claimed it's just what every kid does with dolls growing up. After all, the marionettes' joints and strings show.

This argument holds true - for those whose childhood dolls had hard nipples. Despite knobby groin areas, the scene is not enough ""puppet"" and too much ""sex"": the characters try plenty of odd positions, but no hilarious awkwardness, like that of the dolls simply walking, comes through.

The scene could have been much funnier, even without the upside-down acrobatics. The audience waits for strings to get tangled, or for wooden thumping sounds, but all it gets is relentless puppet pile-driving with cheesy background music. Funny? Yup. But not gut-bursting.

That, sadly, is true of the whole movie. If something is hilarious, much of the audience has already heard about it. What's left is worth seeing, but no one leaves with sore cheek muscles from laughing so hard.

Essentially, see ""Team America: World Police,"" and do as little prior research as possible. Expect a good laugh, but it's not a film anyone will remember a decade from now.",1117324800,3,2857,4.949895615866389

2218665,5,B0007LPLMY,"I have mixed opinions on Trey Parker's movies.

I love Cannibal the Musical.

I thought the South Park movie was boring and tame compared to the TV show. I am already not much of a South Park fan (except for the hilarious Mr. Hanky The Christmas Poo episode) but the movie didn't go very far into outrageousness as the TV show did.

Orgazmo is a film I could take or leave.

Baseketball was just plain awful.

Trey Parker was funny in the uneven Tales From the Crapper (A Troma not Trey Parker film).

I didn't know what to expect with this but it is now by far my favorite Trey Parker related film.

When this film came out, I heard an interview on the Drudge Report and learned that Trey Parker and Matt Stone are extreme conservatives, as I am also. They said they most agreed with the Libertarian party which I do as well.

My assumptions before then were that Parker and Stone were probably liberals and that a film on the war on terror would be from that perspective. Luckily, my assumptions were wrong.

This movie really appeals to me for the fact that the villains in this film are the Socialist Hollywood Leftists (who are being used by North Korean Leader Kim Jong Il). It is great seeing the Michael Moore puppet holding hot dogs in both his hands and mustard stains on his shirt presented as a suicide bomber against America.

The only criticism I have of this Unrated DVD is the additional puppet sex scenes not in the theaters. In this version not only do the puppets have all kinds of sexual acts and positions but they also urinate and defecate on each other. I am all for pushing the limits to extremes on unrated director's cuts but in my opinion, it was out of character for the two Team America members that had fallen in love. If Parker and Stone really wanted to push bad taste by showing puppet scat sex, I feel they should have worked it in someplace else in an unrelated scene. Maybe by expanding the Michael Moore puppet's role a little?

The puppets are absolutely incredible looking as well as the sets. This movie is also a full blown action movie (seriously) and was designed in the same way as a full-blown action movie would be by Bill Pope who did the same for the (hugely overrated) Matrix movies. The only difference being the scale of the sets, ""actors"". etc. A lot about this and the main techniques are presented in the extra features of the DVD.

It is also full of Trey Parker songs which also even top those in Cannibal the Musical. We even have Kim Jong Il singing a sentimental song of how he is ""ronery"" (lonely).

I also thought the speech on the 3 types of people was exceptionally funny. You will need to watch to learn more about this.

Watch this movie. Great humor, songs, action, puppets.

If you hate the Socialist Hollywood Left, you will especially appreciate this movie!",1117238400,2,2826,4.460194174757282
2218666,4,B0007LPLMY,"The creators of South Park  do it again and make one of the crudest and funniest movies you'll see. Not sure how Roger Ebert or anyone could just dismiss it with one star.

I'm a Matt Damon fan but when he did that it always got me to laugh out loud. Plus they turn Alec Baldwin into the world's greatest actor that no one can out act.

  I never thought a movie with puppets could be so damn funny. Even the song (Pearl Harbor Sucked but I love you) was pretty funny. Well the song went something like that. The song knocks Ben Afflick's acting skills. Even the Team America theme song is uncalled for. ""America ""F"" YEAH!"" It also offers a crude and disgusting but also hilarious sex scene.

2218667,4,B0007LPLMY,"Alot of people will dig this movie. It's accessable to mainstream audiences whether or not they get beyond the surface humor that might have linked ""Team America"" back to ""Baseketball"", but it's also damn smart on so many different levels. There's the obvious connotations of the marionettes, but they've done so much more than strip bare the Hollywood blockbusters that too many people can watch with a straight face while the rest of us stand outside the theater gagging; they've displayed the cheesiness that seeped out of michael bay movies into the modern American mentallity. During no other 20th century war has cliche fiction had so many striking similarities to our hero-enemy soap opera ideas of what liberty is. The whole election revolved around winning over public sentiment by making the war out to be a) symbolic of the liberty that founded America or b) a percieved personal attack by your dreaded antagonist. And why do politicians and the media make everything about ideas and symbolism instead of telling us the facts and letting us use our own God-given minds? The same reason we poured millions of dollars into seeing ""Pearl Harbor"". Team America isn't about personal stance for the most part; it's a play of what we might spend alot of money seeing in the theaters if we're the same people who buy into the idea of a world that revolves around an unrealistic good guy vs. bad guy (pick your hero first) plot.  Although Try and Matt are little more than ""clost righties"" as Rolling Stone just had to add for the sake of a petty slap at the right, the point of the movie isn't about who wins or loses, but rather how you play the game. This is best represented in the ingenious suicide bombing scene. While the hippocrasy of left-wing hollywood would lead us to believe that their hatred of the people who kill terrorists is equal to the terrorists hatred of left-wing Hollywood, only in the mind of a stereotypical republican would Michael Moore be capable of taking any action himself on anything (ever wonder how many of the poor people in ""Roger & Me"" could fit inside his mansion?), let alone literally becoming the terrorist they've made him out to be. There has, however, been alot of debate over whether this is a left or right (more commonly right) statement, and those people picked up on the final speech, but kind of missed the overall point. In the end, they finally came out and said that liberals need to allow war because it's saving their lives and allowing them to whine, but most of the movie was a satire of sleazy modern politics as a whole. I've heard people saying that the creators are liberal because they appeared in ""Bowling for Columbine"" (because they grew up close to Columbine geniuses) and swear alot (and that's the kind of prejudice that brought about this movie), and all I can say to those people is if your ideas are defined by those type of categories, then this movie is definately targetted at you. But is the patriotism of the right really reminiscent of the hot blooded Reagan-era action flicks this film spoofs? Is the media role-playing of the left the result of Hollywood refusing to leave childish namecalling and immature ideology to elementary school playgrounds? Well, it's never seemed so familiar and never felt so much like there's been a mudslinging contest with the tactics and wit of a simple puppet show going on right under our noses.",1117238400,2,3411,4.7521079258010115
2218668,2,B0007LPLMY,"That says it all right there, if you are unfamiliar with the now infamous landmark of the Comedy Central channel on cable, 'Southpark' are basically poorly drawn children characters that curse and make bodily function jokes at each other all day. The aim of it's creators is to basically smash every barrier of good taste and offend every group in society that they can, but where do you go from there? Team America functions along the same lines. The puppets in here are amazingly filmed, and I would recommend you see the way they look on screen. However, only see this film if you are a liberal and have a healthy sense of humor. There are a lot of infantile jokes, gross out humor and some very, very offensive material, often in poor taste. There's plenty of harsh language and this film is definitely not for children. I don't offend easily, but I even turned away during the puppet making love scene, in which they mimic all sexual positions and then go too far I feel, in showing the puppets deficate and urinate on each other. The premise of the film is obviously poking fun at Bush and the war on terror and a thinly veiled way of saying that we often poke our nose in other countries affairs. No one is left unoffended in this film. I would mainly say that if you like that Southpark

Another highlight: Kim Jong Il's musical number.  In fact, all the songs were dead-on parodies.  You really have to pay attention to pop country anthems to nail them the way Parker and Stone did.

2218673,5,B0007LPLMY,"Matt Stone and Trey Parker are among some of the most clever and most savage satirists working today. Every week on their crudely animated TV show, South Park, they skewer sacred cows like religion, politics and dominant figures in popular culture. Their feature film debut, South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, was a brilliant attack on rampant nationalism and the hypocrisy of the MPAA movie censors. Stone and Parker are back with another ingenious effort, Team America World Police, an action film done with puppets in the tradition of the classic Thunderbirds TV show.

Like any good satire, Stone and Parker play it completely straight, never winking at the audience. Satire that works is almost always misinterpreted and rarely appreciated when it first comes out. Case in point: the South Park movie which wasn't the mega-blockbuster that the studio had hoped but has since developed a loyal cult following. I can see Team America heading the same way. One of the things that makes this movie so funny is that it goes after targets so in need of being satirized.

The Unrated Version of this movie features a slightly longer, more disturbingly explicit puppet sex scene, which, not surprisingly, did not pass the MPAA censors.

""Team America: An Introduction"" has Parker and Stone introduce the members of the team. They mention that this movie was a conscious decision to take a giant step back, technology-wise, and a response to the excessive use of CGI in contemporary action movies.

""Building the World"" takes a look at the ambitious sets built for this movie. Production designer Jim Dultz had to recreate a believable Bruckheimer-esque world. The scale is truly impressive as is the amount of detail.

""Crafting the Puppets"" features puppet producer Edward Chiodo who talks about how he helped realize Matt and Trey's vision. We are taken through the design process (size, sculpting, etc.), how they are put together and so on.

""Pulling the Strings"" is a brief look at the art of puppeteering and how the film's puppeteers tried to achieve everything Matt and Trey wanted, including large scale action sequences with many puppets on camera at once.

""Capturing the Action"" takes a look at the film's director of photography, Bill Pope (who worked on The Matrix movies). He talks about applying normal action film camera moves to this movie and how he had to adjust said techniques for a smaller scale.

""Miniature Pyrotechnics"" shows how they pulled off some of the great looking explosions in camera and with no CGI.

""Up Close with Kim Jong-Il"" features Matt and Trey talking about why they cast the notorious North Korean dictator as the film's villain. In their research, they found out that he is huge film buff and hope that he gets to see this movie.

Also included are ""Dressing Room"" and ""Puppet"" tests that are essentially demo reels trying out certain moves and actions with the puppets.

There are ten ""Deleted/Extended Scenes and Outtakes"" totaling six minutes. One of the highlights is a funny bit with Team America's commander talking about his hatred of Winnie the Pooh that should not have been cut.

""Animated Storyboards"" showcase the drawings created to plot out and frame six scenes from the movie.

Finally, there are two theatrical trailers.",1117065600,3,3282,5.0

If you judge a film by the amount of copious fluids you excrete from your person then ""Team America-World Police"" is an outright masterpiece.  All kidding aside, this was the funniest film of 2004 and will inevitably achieve classic status.  This is probably the crowning moment of Parker and Stone's repertoire.  The beauty of this film is that I know both liberals and conservatives who are just as effusive in their fervor for this film.  The film's targets, global politics, Hollywood activism, high-voltage action films to name a few, are skewered brilliantly.  The puppets are stunning and expressive.  The miniature sets and visuals are breath-taking.  Like other Parker and Stone ventures the film has a great song score.

But if you're among that blessed throng that can't abide the self-righteous blather of either side - you'll love this film. Seeing the movie in theaters twice, the first time on opening night, it was truly gratifying to see the massive number of liberal hipsters thoroughly waylaid by the film's content. When Michael Moore exploded, I was one of only three or four people that applauded loudly. The rest of the audience was in a sort of stunned silence. The new, younger right of center folks, who have little regard for church, but even less regard for the frenzied-religious-like orthodoxy of the left will love this film. For some that see this as an implicit jab at W. Bush - you are wrong. Parker and Stone have never implied anything. They are quite obvious with their contempt. That is why Michael Moore, Alec Baldwin, Janine Garafalo and others make an actual appearance in the film and George Bush does not. (Garafalo apparently cried upon learning she had been lampooned and shot in the face in the Team America - one of the most visceral and violent, immediate and pleasant death scenes in modern cinema) Stone and Parker are certainly no fans of Bush...but they ""really fu*king {seem} to hate"" those that appear in the film, if only when they change shape from actor to activist. In the Team America cosmos it is obvious Parker and Stone are not Pu**ies, or A**holes. They're dicks. And their movie is a rare kind of thing in today's Hollywood.",1116979200,6,1730,4.77

I was suprised that I actually liked this movie. I figured it would be funny since it came from the guys behind South Park, but I didn't think puppets could be this funny. From the extremely cheesy music to the soap opera acting of the puppets, you will be cracking up throughout the whole movie. This movie pokes fun at conservatives more so than anything, but it also takes a lot of jabs at hardcore celebrity liberals, which is also very funny. This movie is dripping with satire. I bet if I went back and watched it again I would find another joke that has some satirical message behind it about our government.

If you're a conservative you might not like how this movie throws the facts right out there and then makes fun of them, but hopefully it would make you realize the absurdity of some of the conservative ideals. I think the same can be said for liberals, even if Matt Stone and Trey Parker are just making fun at their devout practice of freedom of speech.

2218679,5,B0007LPLMY,"(If you don't know why I signaled out this movie for the title of my review, watch this film and listen to one of the songs & you will see why).

""Team America: World Police"" is the brainchild of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of ""South Park"". Right from the first scene, Stone and Parker's touch is extremely evident: this film is offensive, vulgar and disgusting, but at the same time, it's so repulsively funny. Granted, I've never seen an episode of ""South Park"", but if it's anything like this movie, I think I'll enjoy it.

""Team America: World Police"" tells the story of a special police force that is bent on protecting America, even if it means destroying the Eifel Tower. (And did I mention all the characters are puppets?). When their M - like boss Spotswood learns of an attack put together bu various terrorist organizations,, he recruits Broadway star Gary Johnston to help the team by going the fictional Middle Eastern city Durka Durkastan and infiltrating the terrorists and saving the world,. The plan works flawlessly (and hilariously), or so it seems. Gary and his teammate Lisa fall deeply in love with each other, culmianting int he much publicized sex scene (which is longer thanks to the unrated version). They soon learn that the attack is far from over, and has been planned by North Korean dictator Kimg Jong Ill (who is hilariously). There are some very funny moments included in this film, including:

-A two minute vomiting sequence that  is truly gross but extremely hilarious.

-A retarted Matt Damon (one of the many liberal celebrities that are lampooned in this movie.

-The sex scene (like you didn't see that coming).

-The scene where Gary needs to prove his trust to Spotswood.

Perhaps the funniest aspect of the movie, however, are the songs. These includce the theme song, ""Only A Woman"", ""Freedom Isn't Free"", ""The Pearl Harbor Sucks Song"", ""You Are Worhtress Arec Barrwin"", Ill's ""I'm So Ronery"", ""Montage"" and the uproraious ""Rent"" sendup (however, I find it a little disturbing that, for the dvd release, they left in the line ""the pope has got it and so do you"" in the wake of the tragic passing of the pope).

  I noticed myself wanting to laugh a lot more than I actually did, but when I laughed, I nearly peed my pants. The music in this movie is hilarious, with the soft guitar and an F-Bomb dropped in the middle. ""I Miss You and Pearl Harbor Sucked"" is probably the most random song, but one of the funnier ones.

The film itself it beautifully shot, with gorgeous set pieces, amazingly creepy puppets, great editing, a fabulous script, and some of the funniest, most toe-tapping, and flat-out wrong songs ever written.  Who could've guessed a puppet action movie could be so well done?  Leave to the 'South Park' guys to pull it off in spades.

Usually featurettes totally suck, but here they are well produced, informative, and any time Parker or Stone are on screen they're funny.  But these extras really show how much time, effort, and dedication went into making this silly little puppet movie.

Parker and Stone are criminally overlooked satirists.  All their detractors concentrate on is their overt crudeness, but lying just below the surface, in just about everything they do, is a serious message about how screwed up our world is.  They do a fabulous job, albeit with tons of poop jokes and curse words, satirizing everything from foreign policy to silly celebrities.

2218693,4,B0007LPLMY,"I was trying to figure out if Trey Parker and Matt Stone were mainly going after George W. Bush or Alec Baldwin in ""Team America: World Police,"" but it turns out their real targets were Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer (the song ""'Pearl Harbor' Sucked and I Miss You"" was a big clue).  You think that the Bush doctrine of military intervention is being lampooned, but the guy on the suicide mission wearing the dynamite belt is Michael Moore and there are almost as many liberals killed by Team America as there are terrorists (but I might be wrong on that score as I gave up counting dead bodies in movies ever since ""MAD"" did the bit about Clint Eastwood in ""Where Eagles Dare"").

The movie starts off with its best sequence as Team America shows up in Paris to save the City of Lights from terrorists with a weapon of mass destruction.  Team America succeeds, but pays a price as one of their members is killed.  Also, there is some collateral damage, but the important thing is that the terrorists were stopped so everybody should just shut up and be grateful (not necessarily in that order).  What we then have is the introduction of the new team member and a whole bunch of standard action movie scenes, only acted out by marionettes following a script written by Parker, Stone and Pam Brady

What I can do is assure you that you will be offended by ""Team America"" at some point during this unrated and uncensored version (I can totally understand why the movie was heading for a NC-17 rating on the basis of two shots during the semi-infamous marionettes having sex scene).  But it is not Parker and Stone unless they go too far and that is certainly preferred to not going far enough (for proof, watching ""Saturday Night Live"" the next time it is on).  So there are moments when you will laugh yourself silly and other moments where you need to worry about what will come flying out of your mouth if you are not carefully given the visual inspiration provided by the film.

Probably the only person who comes out looking good in this movie is Gerry Anderson, the guy who came up with ""Thunderbirds"" using the process of ""Supermarionation,"" which gets the big screen treatment here (unlike, ironically, the recent ""Thunderbirds"" theatrical film).  There are some good gags based on treating the puppets like puppets, but the main laughs come at the expense of the action film genre.  You cannot get through the opening titles without having a bunch of explosives and while there are plenty of funny songs the use of heroic music to pump up the fake bonding moments and emotional travails are actually funnier.  I also liked the juxtaposition of interpersonal revelations with explosions as the team finally sorts out who likes whom.  This is not as great as ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut,"" but it is the closest that Parker and Stone have come to date, which would be one of those good things you hear about from time to time.

The cinematography is by Bill Pope, who shot the ""Matrix"" films but is a fan of ""South Park"" and tired of shooting blue screens.  The production design by Jim Dultz, the art direction by John Berger and Tom Valentine, and the set direction by Fontaine Beauchamp Hebb and Richard C. Walker is pretty impressive for a puppet movie and the featurettes will get you to go back and pore over the movie scene by scene to see what interesting things you can spot in this 1/3 scale world.  That will serve you a lot better than trying to figure out the impolite politics of this film.  I am toying with the idea that maybe the film is an attack on the Bush Administration by embracing the use of force and killing all the activist actors.  Or maybe Parker and Stone just do not like actors.  They certainly do not like Kim Jong Il, but then who does?",1116633600,8,3783,4.561299852289513
2218694,2,B0007LPLMY,"Parker & Stone were hilarious with South Park Bigger, Longer & Uncut and went over the top with profanity and attacks on celebrities and politicians.  Unfortunately, this film is technically creative with the puppets but otherwise an over the top experiment with crudeness and a very weak story.  The moments I found humorous were few and far between.  Caught myself falling asleep several times (despite coffee).  With all the hype this movie received, and the long delay before DVD release, I expected far more.  This one is going to the used bin.  Agreeing with other reviewers, this is definitely not a family film (not that I ever thought it was).",1116547200,6,652,4.881818181818182
2218695,4,B0007LPLMY,"This is about the best that sophomoric humor gets. You know all the basics by now: it's marionettes, bumbling fighters for some kind of justice, and R-rated for - well, for lots of good reasons.

It's also insanely funny. This is decidedly a product of Pres. Bush II, and generally lampoons the West Man's Burden that the US has taken on itself. It also ribs just about every stereotype around, using both its musical pieces (""Lonely"" and ""Montage"" had me rolling) and its send-ups of dozens of other movies. Those included the original Thunderbirds TV show, Charlie's Angels, The Karate Kid, James Bond, The Matrix, and bunches of others. I couldn't always pick out a specific film being lampooned, but the mood was familiar and true whether or not I knew what it satirized.

Two facts really stuck out in watching this. First was how well the puppets and scenes (wait for Il's panthers!) were put together. Second was that appreciation of the crude humor (gross-outs, homophobia, and all) split my viewing room down the middle, male vs. female. I spent a fair bit of time trying to explain why the country-western lyrics were so riotous. Have you ever tried to explain a joke? It was one of those, but bad.

It's the best ""adult"" potty-humor animation since those scenes in Flesh Gordon. If you believe that even more time should have passed since then, skip Team America. If you're willing to sink to its level, though, it can be a lot of fun.

If you think this film is a political satire, you're going to be disappointed because its political commentary is about on the same level as a Dirty Harry movie.  Sure, it takes some quick whacks, but that's about it; even South Park episodes explore issues to a much greater extent.",1116547200,,365,4.6
2218697,2,B0007LPLMY,"This movie proves once again that Trey Parker and Matt Stone just don't have the chops for a feature length movie and should really consider hiring a professional screenwriter if they're serious about this.  Like the South Park movie, Team America was very funny, when it was funny.  Unfortunately, the rest of the time it was mired in obvious filler.  The movie started out with a bang, the puppet movements were funny, and it's send-up of current events was right on target.  Too bad it had to go downhill from there.

It begins when Team America flies to the rescue in Paris, protecting its innocent citizens from terrorists.  Naturally, Team America does more damage in their rescue than the terrorists probably dreamed of doing.  One of the Team is killed and must be replaced, so they recruit an up and coming Broadway actor to use his acting skills to fight for freedom.  The shot at Hollywood gets even more obvious when the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G.) teams up with Kim Jong Il to stop Team America, who have been savaged by the media and made to look like the bad guys.  Kim Jong Il's character is hilariously heartless and evil, and his ""accent"" of mispronounced L's and R's is definitely un-PC.  Otherwise, all the humor in this movie is visual, from the Team America hideout in Mount Rushmore to the sex scene that goes just a little too far.

The ingredients for a first-class comedy were all here.  Unfortunately, they weren't tied together very well, and the movie is merely mediocre, filled with ""drama"" scenes that just aren't funny and a few mildly humorous songs, though blessedly fewer than in the South Park movie.  South Park fans will get a few chuckles, if they can stay awake for them.  My advice:  rent it if you really must see it.",1116547200,6,1758,4.644012944983818
2218698,3,B0007LPLMY,"It was a film.  Yes, the puppets were original, but it pretty much contained the same worn-out and at times over-hyped humour other ""satires"" use.

Some things in the film were funny.  The characters are all parodies of major action film stereotypes:  the jock leader, the hardheaded brawler, the sensitive agent, the smart-and-pretty agent, and the oddball one who has 50 zillion other skills the rest of the team needs. It worked.

Trey and Matt aren't afraid to take chances.  Cool.  They're also equal opportunity offenders.  No political group is safe; Team America represents the current cowboy administration while the Film Actors Guild represents the peacenicks.  Race, nationality, sexual orientation... nothing is safe from humour.

But aside from the fact everything was done with puppets, there just isn't anything that separates this film from the other satirical action films out there.  I just wasn't impressed, don't see what all the hype is about.  Satire with puppets.  Wow.

Yeah, I'm giving it three stars.  Smart, edgy, and creative.  But not so much that it stands out as something worthy of five stars.  Oh, and some of the toilet humour is just old.

2218699,5,B0007LPLMY,"This movie is crude, rude, politically incorrect, but hell yeah, a whole lot of fun! Well, what do you expect from the makers of South Park?

The setting of the movie is Today - in the wake of 9/11 and of transnational terrorism. Team America's the world police, equipped with ""Thunderbirds""-like firepower and fancy transportation, whose mission is to strike at terrorists around the world. And what more, the main baddie's North Korea's Kim Jong Il and his band of middle eastern terrorist posse with WMD... hmm... a little too close to reality for comfort?

This film is so full of itself/America that it gets most of its laughs from there. From location settings that takes reference point from America, to the current inane insensitivity of American forces on foreign soil, to pointing fingers at bad Intelligence, it is all insane fun from the beginning when pandemonium strikes, that you start to wonder who actually does more damage - Team America, or the terrorists themselves.

Another highlight of this movie is the songs! When you first hear the Team America Theme, with it's ""America! F* YEAH!"", you know you'd had better pay attention to the lyrics of songs to come, some of which pokes fun at Pearl Harbour, pokes fun at film-making (the use of montages), and you even have Kim Jong Il doing a solo number! As with most slapstick comedies, sometimes you just gotta spoof some classics, which includes Star Wars, Matrix and Top Gun. Also, if you enjoy MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch, then you'll also enjoy the numerous fight sequences in Team America, which is just as creative in its decapitations, and as bloody.

Another infamous scene that got a lot of attention, was the sex scene between 2 lead puppets. It's no holds barred, puppetry porn. Whatever positions you can think of, it's mimicked on screen. Moreover, the conversational dialogue that led them to making love, is totally inane.

Look out for appearances by familiar Hollywood faces, and political figures like Hans Blix, Tony Blair, etc, used without their kind permission more like, as they're put in really bad, but hilarious, light.",1116547200,,2113,4.940845070422535

Even though the satir of america being the world's police is absolutely hilarious and well done, the real joy of this movie comes from the scenes and references to the play ""Cats"", the satire of their play ""AIDS"", the musical score, the lines from famous classic movies, and the list goes on.  If you can catch the many literary references thrown around in this movie, you can understand why its funny and why the writers threw them in.

While I may be a ""fanboy"" of matt stone and trey parker ever since their first movie ""Cannibals! The Musical!"", I can honestly say that this movie is much funnier for well cultured and read people than people who just like fart and poop jokes.

The movie is a kind of serious funny that many do not get, or even like for that matter.  There is also alot of dark comedy, and because dark comedy is not for everyone, not everyone will like this movie.

2218707,3,B0007LPLMY,"Christ. Am I getting old or just not falling for the same old d*ck and fart jokes...I bought 2 DVD's yesterday. Both on the opening street date 5/18/05...one was the 'Seinfeld' Season 4 boxset and the other was 'Team America'. First off, I'd like to say I love and I do mean this, ""LOVE"" Matt Stone and Trey Parker's collective sense of humor...if I were a chick, I'd probably try to have sex with or befriend one or the both of them just so I could stick around and laugh my ass off all the time. There's no doubting that both Matt and Trey are extremely talented, and I do mean ""EXTREMELY"" talented, (I would have never guessed South Park would have lasted this long and they seem to have an inexhaustible supply of new and original ideas to keep the show fresh.).

However, this movie...'Team America: World Police' is not all that funny. There were some funny moments in it, but for the most part I just sat through it ""waiting""...""For what?!?"", you might ask...well, for me not to think that what I was watching was not a piece of crap. Unfortunately, this thought never crossed my mind and ultimately I was left feeling...nothing.

Sure, this movie is vulgar...and sure, that vulgarity is meant to be really funny...but it's not. For example, the ""Unrated"" sex scene...I 'image' search the internet all day long some times looking for photos I can use in my Photoshop cartoon Skipper Clipper, which can be found at 'The Holy Temple of Shue' website via a link on the opening page. It's listed under most search engines so try and find it if you want to read and see what I'm talking about, but I digress...the sex scene...this should have been funny to me, but I've seen so many photos and videos of real people cr*pping and peeing all over each other that, to see puppets do it, well, it's not really that big of a deal. I can see where someone who's never seen these type of things might think it's funny, just because they've never been exposed to it and think it's a very bizarre behaviour not really practiced by anyone except perverts and sick-minded people...which, I guess for the most part, is true, but it's also a very ""real"" subgenre of traditional sex...much like the fetishes of people who like to masturbate to videos of chicks getting kidnapped in the woods, raped, and then put through a wood chipper or skewered on a log and roasted like a pig. This too, is a very ""real"" subgenre (...) to traditional sex, and although it's very bizarre behaviour, it's hardly funny, even for puppets.

I was soo disappointed at this movie...and I really, really was waiting for a long time for it to come out on video so I could see it. Anyway, it has nothing to do with the production values, all of the puppets and the world they inhabit are very believable down to the tinest of details, but my irritation did not come from the production value...it's in the humor.

One thing I've learned from listening to drunken idiot rednecks coming out of Wal-mart at 1 o'clock in the morning and shouting obscenities in the parking lot and that's, putting c*ck or balls or (...) in front of words or each other is not enough to be funny. It's repetitive and annoying, and coming from drunken rednecks or angry hispanic welfare moms it's close to unforgivable ignorance. Anyway, that's what this movie is...98 minutes (give or take) of crude sexual humor and foul language which makes no sense.

The actual story is okay and gets it's point across (i.e.-America's military will destroy any historical landmarks or mass quantities of other humans in the name of Freedom in order to achieve an objective whether it be a handful of terrorists or an oppressive leader who cannot be controlled by the U.S.).
I already knew this, so this and all of the other political view points (such as the political activist actor's guild F.A.G.) are old to me which leaves only the humor to carry the movie, which isn't all that funny considering that the ninth season of South Park is the most hilarious yet.

Anyway, I understood the movie, I understood the humor, I just didn't like either and I will be getting rid of my DVD tomorrow, however, I am keeping the 'Seinfeld' 4th season boxset. I've got nothing but good things to say about it. It's hilarious.

2218708,5,B0007LPLMY,"Parker and Stone will someday be acknowledged as two of the finest social critics this country has ever possessed. They rank alongside Hunter Thompson and probably even Mencken with their brilliance and justifiable curse-on-all-houses attitude. As far as the current ""crisis"" goes I'd stick this film with the incredible 9/11 front page The Onion did a few years back. That should have gotten a Pulitzer. Stuff like this movie makes one realize that the Real America, the America that's half lovable pirate and half terrible angel, the cranky, iconoclastic down-to-Earth America that tells both the religious right and the politically correct left to go to hell, is alive and well. This is the America that should serve as the shining example to the rest of the world. This is one of the most genuinely patriotic movies I've ever seen. I salute it.

Only Parker and Stone would make everyone in this situation look like an imbecile, from Michael Moore, to any hyper-patriotic opportunist country singer, to nitwit Hollywood stars, to...well, nobody's left out except, astonishingly, the White House. Maybe they saw that as too cheap and easy. They consistently point out that the problem with the United States of America isn't the Left or the Right, it's both--a whole lot of really stupid people of all stripes. For those who think they take a traditional kind of lefty stand on some things pay close attention. Team America trashes Paris icons but the suitcase nuke they prevent going off would've killed a hell of a lot more puppets. Another puppet casually blows everyone away with a chain gun in a coffee house except the staff and band. Don't make any of this movie too easy for yourself. They're P.O.ed about some of the response to 9/11 but, like me, I think they're extremely P.O.ed about 9/11.

As a marionette film this is great too (as symbolism it's astounding!). They did a fantastic job with the sets, the miniatures, and so on. This'll rank as one of the all-time classics in that arena. Again, that's typical of these insanely multi-talented guys. The songs weren't as awsome as in the South Park Movie (one of the best movie musicals since The Sound of Music or West Side Story) but this wasn't really presented as the musical that the earlier film certainly was.

2218714,5,B0007LPLMY,"The creators of South Park Trey Parker and Matt Stone made a film that is an odd theme to it: serious action and romance but it involves puppets with very visible strings. So of course it ends up becoming funny on that basis and on another basis due to the film itself. Some parts maybe aren't as funny but more often than that it hits its mark.

There's Middle Eastern terrorists in Paris and Team America, a force assigned to protect America although maybe not officially comes to the rescue. Only they end up causing more damage than the terrorists do and they lose one of their members. It's believed that Kim Jong Il, North Korea's dictator is going to strike but they don't know where.

So they hire Gary, a Broadway actor who's starring in Lease, a spoof of Rent(with its big closer ""Everyone Has AIDS""). They hire him to infiltrate terrorist headquarters and find out their plans.

As for the film's famous puppet sex scene, it's funny looking at it cause it looks funny but there's 2 sex shots that kind of ruins it and turns it from being funny to just weird and gross. It's funny that people got so riled up about it since the puppets don't even have ""parts"" besides the woman who's got breasts. It's more of the implied nature of the position/sex act which riles up people. Maybe you've done something they've done, who knows.

The violence is slightly over the top, only cause you're looking at puppets. One puppet gets the top half of his head kicked off while panthers(they're actually real live cats) starts snacking on a puppet's neck and taking the head with it.

One great aspect of the film is the songs. It's got characters singing them or just part of the soundtrack but you got the aforementioned ""Everyone Has AIDS"", the Team America theme ""America(F*** Yeah!)"" and Kim Jong Il's ballad ""So Ronely"". He doesn't really pronounce words clearly so that's actually lonely or when he says Arec Ballwin instead of Alec Baldwin.

Like the title says, there's humor here that is so blatantly offensive you'd be shocked yet you'd laugh with everyone else and be like ""hey wait a minute that's offensive! <another funny scene, you laugh> why did I laugh at that again? Isn't it gross?""",1116288000,,2199,4.625641025641026

""freedom isn't free"" is based off a parody version of an alan jackson song in the ""ladder to heaven"" episode;  ""montage"" was featured in the ""asspen"" episode first.  in short, if you've seen everything matt and trey did for south park, you've seen everything in this film.  the dialog suffers as it's obvious that trey and matt did most of the voices, and as such that aspect of the movie quickly becomes monotonous.  ""team america: world police"" isn't as shocking or hilarious as many critics would lead you to believe.

oddly enough, the vast majority of this film consists of liberal bashing.  in a time as serious and dangerous as the one we are in now where conservatives are the ones bungling everything they can get their hands on, it's kind of odd to see a film that portrays such destructive, negligent meatheads as bumbling, likable goofballs while those who are only guilty of having an opinion are the ones disemboweled in the end.  it's well known that matt and trey are right-leaning libertarians, which kind of makes sense as to why they hit the likes of michael moore and alec baldwin especially hard.  you'd think that a movie titled ""team america: world police"" would focus more on savaging the reckless, ""let's go get em!"" attitude of bush and his cronies than people who oppose his insane policies.  yeah, let's kill those whiny, annoying liberals who are only marginally influential and communicate their ideologies through peaceful means rather than the greedy plutocrats who wield the actual power to make war!  flag-wavers and republicans made very little noise about this movie because of this fact.

to be fair, a lot has changed in iraq and in foreign policy since this movie premiered.  nobody knew for sure at the time this movie was made that bush would stay in office, the search for WMDs would end, that an iraqi election would make little to no difference, that osama bin laden would still be alive, and that a majority of the public would eventually feel that entering iraq was a mistake.",1115942400,8,2278,4.778061224489796
2218720,4,B0007LPLMY,"hi, i am a devout trey parker/matt stone fan and was very excited when this movie came out.  i had a great time watching it and would probably give it a B to a B+, like 86.5% or something.  its not really as funny the whole way as a lot of my favorite funny movies like Dirty Work, Almost Heroes, or B movies like Cool As Ice (by Robert Van Winkle aka Vanilla Ice).  It has funny parts my favorite being Kim Jong Il's panthers which are just some confused kittens with panther sounds in the background.

but what i really, really love about this movie is the soundtrack.  i listen to it on a regular basis and probably will for the forseable future.  its fun, its funny, and it really hits on political crap and stereotype crap.  for example now when its 2:00 am on a monday morning and i have a term paper due the next morning i listen to ""montage"" for inspiration.  then when i think of my current girlfriend who i don't really care about i listen to ""only a woman.""  my favorite part of that track:

""and on saturdays when i've been partyin' hard

and its four in the morning and i'm on my fifth tab of E

that's the only time i don't really care if you are woman!!!""

i'm pretty excited to see the unrated stuff, i heard there's puppet penetration, urination, and defecation.  'bout f-in' time.  i guess if i was cool and lived in a big city they've been playing the unrated version in small moviehouses since it came out.  oh well, i'm in iowa.

2218721,4,B0007LPLMY,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone are two overlooked geniuses. They use surface innocence to convey biting satires, political messages, and yes some bathroom humor. Their South Park series is one of my favorite shows of all time. I don't think there is one unsatisfactory episode to me, and when they came out with that movie, I again was not dissappointed. In fact I never loved the series or the characters more. Then, i heard their new plan. To use another representation of innocence, puppets, and completely tear things apart. From the first preview I was highly anticipating the movie, and I went into the movie and basically cried for an hour or so I was laughing so hard. This is easily one of the funniest movies i have seen (for reference, other movies i find funny are: shrek, austin powers 1-2, monty python anything, finding nemo, and anything witty).

So why the four stars instead of the 5? well, as much i love the tastelessness of the Dynamic Duo, they sometimes carry it to levels in this movie that aren't just unfunny, but unnecessary to the whole of the movie. Usually everything has some type of purpose, but there was a lot of unnecessary jokes and scenes where i was left wondering why did i just see that.

But overall my reccomendation is to watch it, as long as you aren't some uptight person who can't laugh at something. Keep in mind that it is not too offensive in my eyes because they make fun of everyone. All races, religions, political beliefs: nothing is safe.

The songs are funny, the politics are Parker and Stone's usual 14-year-old pseudo-nihilism, though they don't make ANY effort to lambast the right wing with the same tenacity that they do Tim Robbins and Sean Penn.

2218728,3,B0007LPLMY,"I was lent a copy of Team America: World Police for the weekend, and just finished watching it. It's a marionette movie, which I've never seen before, and it's from the occasionally funny creators of South Park.

Move premise: Team America is a not-so-super-secret team of do-gooders, acting to thwart terrorism around the globe. In the opening sequence, a member of the team is killed in an operation in Paris, and a new member is recruited, an actor in a popular Broadway show. The terrorists' plans are still in play, and the team must defeat the terrorists, and their evil mastermind, and save the world.

At heart, this movie is supposed to be a satire. The movie's creators do delight in skewering everyone and everything in sight: the left and right wings, American blindness to how their actions are viewed by those abroad, and several well-known film actors. The efforts do fall short of satire, however; satire should carry that feeling of...subversiveness, and instead you just get the sense that the characters are blundering through life, Clouseau-fashion.

The movie is funny at times, though be forewarned as the humour is crude and bawdy and did I mention crude? Puppet sex had me laughing out loud! Don't be showing this movie to kids; there's a reason it's rated ""R"". There's no true intellectual humour here, as one would hope with a satire (and one would get with a satire such as Dr. Strangelove).

I should mention that the opening sequence rubbed me the wrong way a little bit, especially after having read Is Paris Burning? recently. The City of Lights deserves to be treated with more care, and certainly should be portrayed more accurately.

This would be one of those ""see on an airplane"" movies, but the odds of this happening are pretty much nil.",1115510400,2,1775,4.8256578947368425

2218730,4,B0007LPLMY,"Parody has the purpose of imitating in detail to achieve humor or to mock.  Sometimes mockery is frowned upon, if the sole purpose is to hurt the individual through ridicule.  This ridicule is also a source of laughter, as it could also be a form of criticism.  The criticism is to express a discontent with what has been expressed prior to the parody.  Thus, parody is essential for free speech and the freedom to express ones own thoughts and ideas.  Team America: World Police pushes the envelope in regards to parody, as it pokes fun of the American tapestry under the Bush administration's era with the help of puppets.

The first half of the film provides hilarious outtakes from notions and similar events that have taken place in the world, and the perceptions of Americans throughout the world.  The film begins in Paris where some terrorists, Middle-Eastern looking puppets, plan to strike Paris with Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  Fortunately, or should the Parisians say unfortunately, Team America arrives to save the day while also succeeding in blowing up the Eiffel Tower and the Triumph Arch.  This is a funny, yet a bloody event while Team America blows away the terrorists without consideration for art or history in Paris.  This is a view many outside the United States have of Americans, uncultured and with poor knowledge of history.  And to balance this out, the filmmakers make fun of other nationalities through caricature.

One of the outcomes of the Paris event led to the death of one of the members of Team America.  Consequently, the leader for Team America, Spottswoode, decides to recruit Gary Johnston, a Broadway actor, who currently performs in the musical Lease, which has an obvious hint towards the musical Rent.  Spottswoode believes that they need Gary's acting skills to get close to the terrorists, as Gary graduated from Iowa University summa cum laude with a double major in theater and world languages.  The recruiting process includes convincing Gary to join Team America, which in itself provides an amusing scene where Spottswoode tries to induce fear in him.  However, it does not affect Gary who goes to Washington D.C. to ponder his decision among the war memorials of fallen men and women.

Through the second half, the story increasingly turns away from parody toward what seems to be a MTV production that tries to rely on the shock value of things while heavily borrowing from other sources.  Much of this is amusing in a cruel way.  Some examples of the borrowing turn up when Team America arrives to Cairo, Egypt where Gary enters the terrorists' bar.  This bar has strong resemblance with Jabba the Hutt's place in Star Wars: The Return of the Jedi (1983).  Another amusing scene appears when Gary first arrives to the Team America headquarters in Mount Rushmore, which seems more like the first episode of a new season of MTV's Real World.  A final example is the North Korean president, Kim Jong Il, who seems to be more like a James Bond villain who terminates the Swedish Top UN weapon's inspector Dr. Hans Blix through feeding him to sharks among many other things.

Freedom of speech brings filmmakers such as Trey Parker a certain level of social responsibility.  This notion seems to have been utterly crushed in the film, as Trey Parker and Matt Stone throw their characters into explicit violence and sex.  Yet, these scenes are not what are most offending in the film. Several ideas surface throughout the film; however, the director Trey Parker and writer Matt Stone never even try to explore any of these ideas.  They simply spew out their discontent in an extremely hostile, yet comical manner, which leaves the viewer with unfinished thoughts of violence and intolerance toward different thinkers.

One major part of the film is the use of numerous known film stars such as Matt Damon, Sean Penn, and Alec Baldwin.  These stars join under Baldwin who is the leader for the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G.), which Parker and Stone seem to use suggestively in a prejudicial jovial manner.  The sole purpose of the actors appears to be for target practicing, as Parker develops a full out assault on them by killing them in various gruesome ways.  This suggests that is ok to threaten or even exercise violence towards those that freely express themselves, which goes against the notion of freedom.

Maybe Parker thought that the idea of using puppets would limit the ideas and thoughts that he provided in the film, as the strings control puppets.  This might be a symbolic gesture toward how people are being manipulated; yet this idea was never fully developed.  Jan Svankmajer's film offers strong and bizarre material through puppets and clay, yet his films are thoughtful in regards to society even though disturbing.  Nonetheless, the discontent is obvious, to point of nihilism, which Ebert even concluded in his review.  This nihilistic attitude does not seem to bring anything more than a parody of itself, as the film unfolds, which gradually increases in meaninglessness.  As mentioned before, the parody, or spoof if you will, seems to evaporate, as Parker and Stone ultimately turn this venture into a cavalcade of shocking scenes for an ever increasingly desensitized audience that will find it funny in the same way a bully muses over his or her victims.  In essence, Team America: World Police begins as a parody that eventually drops the thought it had to embrace and becomes the very same thing that it tries to ridicule.

Yet, the film also has a different side where the creators of South Park are able to cause sidesplitting laughter through shocking puppetry with ruthless abandon.  This can only be allowed in a society where freedom allows it.  Many will find this film repulsive while others will deem it generously entertaining.  One great thing comes through this film, which is the exchange of ideas, a dialogue if you will.  In this dialogue people with different convictions first begin to scream, as they try to out scream each other.  Hopefully, both sides realize that screaming does not work, and they lower their voices in order to hear each other out.  Maybe, some are hurt in the process, but so are soldiers in war as some of them fight for the right of the first amendment.  War is not something new and neither is the idea of world peace.  Maybe people need to find some humility through humiliation before people will know that no one is above any idea, and all ideas must be considered for peace to have a chance.",1115251200,10,6525,4.8748866727107885

2218734,5,B0007LPLMY,"What's wrong with all of the ""1-stars"" that this film received by my fellow reviewers and the elite media is a blind adherence to political propaganda. The naysayers of Team America say that, among many things, that the neo-conservatives get a free ride, Kim Jong Il doesn't look half as vile as the Hollywood actors guilty of ""having opinions,"" etc. They ignore the fact that the team receives commands from a computer which is an obvious play on Karl Rove/Dick Cheney and their roles in the administration. There are many situations where Parker and Stone parody the right.

If these critics could take off their PETA t-shirts and Green Peace membership personas for 2 seconds, they could see that the movie is actually quite funny. The songs are extremely well-done and the movie not only satirizes current events, but Hollywood and many high-key films (Star Wars, Pearl Harbor -- which sucked horribly --, and others). The parody is well done and while the jokes and dialog can be very childish, the fact that it's coming from a puppet with inherent irony in seemingly simple statements is astounding.

Again, if you can remove yourself from PETA for an hour and a half (and while you're at it, have a nice steak) you will find the hilarity that is Team America.

And as an end-note, while Team America has many conservative overtones, the main parody of the movie, the U.S. military as world police, is an attack on the so called neo-conservatives. They are depicted as non-caring and simple. I'm a Bush voter and was able to see the satire, and even humor, at that side of the debate.

If you're going to complain about the single conservative-toned film which also takes shots at it's own mistakes in public policy, you might want to go see any other Hollywood film with an abundance of comfortable political overtones that may satisfy your desire for the easy, non-challenging road your life has already taken you. For Green Peace and PETA members, The Day After Tomorrow won't challenge any of your dear political point of views and will be sure not to cause you to think about anything outside of your comfortable and blind political allegiances.",1114387200,44,2156,4.803234501347709

2218739,4,B0007LPLMY,"I saw this film in theaters out of curiosity factor. I didn't know if I could sit through a 90+ minute film of puppets, but this surprised me with its humor and catchy songs. Trey Parker and Matt Stone really outdid themselves with this one. They achieved a near brilliant film...with only a few minor objectionable and possibly offensive scenes.

Perhaps the biggest controversial scene that required to be cut was the sex scene. Even though it is laughably funny the MPAA demanded cuts to this scene or risk an NC-17 rating, I do understand their decision. If parents brought their children thinking this was a ""kid's movie""...the sex scene would have raised some uncomfortable questions from their children. Its a raunchy and funny scene that adults will get a kick out of. There is another scene that I wasn't sure if it was a parody of how Americans reacted to the Monica Lewinsky scandal (especially since we now know that Clinton was trying to go after Osama but Republicans in Congress claimed he was merely using Osama to distract Americans from ""the real problem""--i.e. sex). The scene is funny, but it wasn't clear what the point was...other than to be as offensive as they could be.

For me, the reason I detract a star is because I thought the vomiting scene went on too long and it was disgustingly tacky. I thought that scene would never end, as just when you think the puppet couldn't vomit any more, out comes another spew. Judging the laugher I heard in the theater, I guess for some people, the puppet could vomit for 30 minutes and still be funny, but I stopped laughing after the second time.

I love the skewering this film does at the likes of Jerry Bruckheimer films (with a song about why the film ""Pearl Harbor"" sucked--which was so true), our nationalistic and macho aggression (with the song ""America, F*** Yeah!""), the musical ""Rent"", evil dictators (I'm sure this film is banned in North Korea, with the Elmer Fuddish Kim Jong Il lisping ""I'm so Ronery""), and most of all, pretentious Hollywood actors and their causes (watch out Sean Penn, Janeane Garofalo, Alex Baldwin). Everyone gets a deserved kick in the pants...conservatives and liberals. Who would be offended more by this film? I would put money on conservatives, since this film flaunts raunchiness in their faces (with the sex scenes and profanities). This film is a great satire about America as it was in 2004. I left the theaters still laughing with one song stuck in my head (the hard charging and macho ""America, F*** Yeah!""). If you enjoy satire and don't get easily offended, buy this dvd and get the soundtrack as well. You'll be surprised how a movie about puppets can entertain and still make a point. The biggest point being...aren't we all puppets playing by someone else's hands (manipulation)? We need to cut the strings of our attachments and avoid both extremes...for they both have agendas more sinister than we realize.

2218742,5,B0007LPLMY,"When I first heard of this movie, I thought it would be just another try-hard Thunderbirds imitation. Oh, how wrong I was! How very wrong! Puppets, yes. Kids, definitely not.

The basic story follows an actor in his new life as a member of Team America, (the other member was killed in Paris). The Team are on the case of North Korean Kim Jong Il, and his plot to destroy the world, with the assistance of Alec Baldwin and the Film Actors Guild, (FAG).

In the process, this film offends just about everyone, while following the violent and ludicrously funny exploits of Team America. This movie takes puppets and comedy to whole new levels in violence and sensuality, (if you can call it that). The laughs just keep coming relentlessly. Kim Jong Il's serenade about being so lonely is funny, and that is about as sensitive as it gets.

The rest is in-your-face satire that is not too subtle, (a sledeghammer comes to mind). It is gratuitously violent, which just adds to the mayhem and laughter, and there is a fair amount of vomit as well. Refined culture is not a big thing for this movie as it pokes fun at just about everything and everyone.

There were gasps, but there were a lot of laughs (I saw it in Santa Monica).  The house wasn't full, but I realized that this movie will probably do better when it hits DVD and the stigma of being seen going to it won't be as bad.

Kind of like porn.

Like some of their best stuff, the creators of TEAM AMERICA are very hit and miss.  But when they hit, it's into the stratosphere.

Rarely have I seen a movie that manages to make fun of so many things to so many people.  There's bound to be at least one thing that will offend anyone reading this, but you'll probably have a couple really hard laughs at other scenes.

They've taken the ridiculous medium of puppetry (remember the THUNDERBIRDS from childhood?) to play out a brainless Hollywood action film, but they've also satirized the brainless Hollywood A-list of celebrity/activists (including ""the greatest living actor of all-time, Alec Baldwin"").  The constant barrage of bad language detracted from the overall film--but these are the mind behind ""South Park,"" so there you go.

I have a feeling the film will be more successful as a DVD: everyone's curious to see what was left out the first time around--especially of that notorious puppet sex scene!",1112659200,7,1372,4.628099173553719

However, beyond the puppets and model aircraft, this show is nothing like a Gerry Anderson kids' show. The humor ranges from making fun of poor quality movies and bad acting to slamming extreme political views on both the right and left, and does a great job throughout the entire range.

However, those few scenes that left me and the rest of the audience cringing or silent were far outweighed by the ones where we laughed very loudly and for quite some time. Examples of some great moments are:

-A whole song devoted to how bad the film Pearl Harbor was, how it missed the significance of that tragic event, and what a mediocre actor is Ben Affleck.

- The awkardness of the puppets. Gerry Anderson used to go to great lengths to hide how funny it looked when the puppets walked, but Parker and Stone closely show you just how awkward the puppets are when walking and doing other human activities (e.g., having sex), to great comic effect.

- Team America is eager to do good, but they ""break"" a lot of stuff doing it, often doing more damage than the bad guys they are chasing.

- The song during the closing credits. It's hilarious, so be sure to stay through the credits and keep your ears open.

2218752,5,B0007LPLMY,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone have a unique ability to blend the nuanced with the obvious, to mix cerebral humor with cheap sight gags and fart jokes.  If this appeals to you (watch an episode of ""South Park"" if you are unsure), and you don't mind having your sacred cows slaughtered and made into taco fillings, this film is a must-see --for repeated viewings.

Mad dictator Kim Jong Il plans to subvert Hollywood and become the megaproliferant of the stars.  Who can stop him? Only Team America, a gang of ultra-right wing marionettes who think Rush Limbaugh is suspiciously liberal.  But don't fret, conservatives: Hollywood pinkos and Michael Moore take a beating, too.  Nothing is sacred to Parker and Stone.

Puppets were a mad choice for a medium, but they are done hysterically.  I don't know what had me laughing more, the whiskey glass soldered to the team leader's hand, or the thought of the splinters and friction fire from marionette sex!

The sound track alone makes this film worth it.  ""Freedom isn't Free"" could have been a real country hit and Kim singing ""I'm so ronery"" had my wife blowing her cola out her nose in the theater!

If you are straight-laced, have a poor sense of humor and can't admit it, or can't laugh at yourself, this may not be you're film.  If you've got a slightly warped sense of humor, you'll love this!",1111536000,175,1344,4.6525423728813555
2218753,5,B0007LPLMY,"""Without doubt, one of the most hysterical parodies ever!""

Given the current world political climate, Trey Parker and Matt Stone hit the ball right out of the park with this film.  I haven't laughed so hard so frequently in a theater in years!  This was simply amazing.

The sheer goofy look and movement of the deliberately low-tech puppet bodies, combined with their high-tech heads and incredibly elaborate sets, makes for some truly classic moments.  When the World Police thoughtfully swoop down to take out a handful of terrorist, while simultaneously destroying much of the surrounding city in the process, you can't help but laugh at the irony.  Can you say ""collateral damage""?

And the overly extended scene of the two lead puppets engaging in the obligatory sex scene had me laughing so uncontrollably that I thought they'd have to take me out of the theater on a stretcher.  Oh my Lord was that funny.  It was one of those rare movie moment that had me laughing days later just thinking about it.

Not only do Parker and Stone mercilessly poke fun at the silly, over-the-top nature of certain Hollywood filmmakers like Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay (e.g., his nearly unwatchable ""Pearl Harbor""), but they also take the public personas of world leaders like North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il and practically feed them into a wood chipper. How this film didn't spark an international PR incident with North Korea is just astounding to me.

What makes their political edge so refreshing and sidesplitting is they're willingness to take on everybody, rather than merely bolstering a right- or left-wing view.  And the merciless way they go after Hollywood celeb-activists was profoundly funny.  Too often I've been sickened by the overly simplistic mentality that comes from the mouths of certain actors when they use their status as public figures to comment on the world affairs.  Parker and Stone portray acting notables like Penn, Baldwin, Robbins, Sarandon, and Garofalo as complete idiots, who are as easily herded about by Kim Jong-Il as so many sheep.  Matt Damon is practically a troglodyte who is so stupid that all his brain can manage is to say his name over and over again.

Like ""South Park Bigger, Longer and Uncut,"" this film has numerous musical numbers that are used to punctuate the humor of various scenes.  The song ""America, F**k Yeah!"" once again practically had me on the floor, especially when it was uses a second time but with a much slower beat. The level of adult humor and vulgarity here will probably not make this film suitable for small kids, and much of the political edginess may be lost on most teenagers.  But if there were a category for ""Best Comedy Film,"" Parker and Stone would both win an Oscars, hands down!",1111536000,57,2763,4.8927038626609445

2218757,5,B0007LPLMY,"""Team America's"" brilliance was largely overlooked when it hit theatres last fall, which is somewhat ironic considering that pre-election political controversy turned Michael Moore's similarly themed, but farmore one-sided documentary into a $100 million-plus hit just months earlier.

""Team America"" is an equal opportunity offender.  Scewering everything from republicans to democrats, Hollywood to outspoken, but poorly informed know-it-all, know-nothing movie stars (hey, who asked you?), and bad movies to big-budget bad movies; ""Team America"" lets no one off easy.

Did I mention the whole thing is done with puppets?

If I had you on the hook and  hearing that made you forget all the good things I just said, and you are now suddenly asking yourself just how smart and topical an action flick staring all puppets can be, you are probably not alone.  This skepticism is no doubt what kept people away from this movie in theatres.  Its a grown up movie in kids' clothing.  The marketing was probably to blame, but how do you market a puppet movie to grown ups?

Their loss.  The fact is this movie wouldn't have been successful had it been done with actors.  Sure, the script would still rank with the best of the year, but I don't think any real actor could pull any of this off.  The movie's charm lies in watching these string-controled, walking (kind of) and talking (not to mention screwing and killing) parodies of overly macho movie action heros, preachy celebs and opportunistic politicians.  If it wasn't going to be a cartoon, it had to be puppets.  Not to mention some moments are just so outlandish and over the top that an actor, not only would never be capable of doing any of this, but would never be as funny doing it (example: the puppets attempting to point at things or touch one another... God, I'm laughing just thinking about it).

This is really a retread of sorts for creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, since their fans will recognize almost everything here from the humor, to the voices, to the social commentary is all ala ""South Park.""  But just as ""South Park"" continues to evolve into something much better and smarter than the one-note joke of vulgar cartoon kids it began as, ""Team America"" takes the duo to a far-higher creative level; both in terms of their skill as film makers (some shots are truly breath-taking and well staged; the how-did-they-do-that(with puppets, nonetheless) factor in this movie is huge) and their genius as writers and comics.  Much of this has to be seen (and heard) to be believed.  Even the songs, as in the ""South Park"" movie, despite their sometimes vile and vulgar lyrics, can rival anything in a ""real"" musical. (""Montage,"" although previously featured on ""South Park,"" is a perfect example of the duos writing skills and observational and sarcastic humor.  It's not the funniest or most profane song of the film, but it sums up these guys perfectly.  ""America, F--k Yeah!"" perhaps sums up the movie's attitude best:  sarcastic and critical, yet humorous and light-hearted)

Everyone who wrote this movie off as childish and dumb based on the previews is missing out on something much smarter than they could possibly predict, especially if you've been looking for something that calls out all the politicians, soap-boxing celebs who think because they make movies or music the world cares to hear what they have to say (they have the same info. we do, read the same newspapers, what makes them more educated on matters of church and state?), and makers of crapy but expensive movies all at once.

It doesn't take sides, it just tells it like it is.  Many will be offended one moment and be nodding in agreement the next.  And don't get me wrong, ""Team America"" is not preachy or too serious.  It is a comedy.  A satire.  And an action flick.  It is just one that happens to include scenes in which Michael Moore is exploded, two characters run through every sexual position imaginable, and the hero pukes for what feels like five straight minutes.  But they can do that because they are puppets.

This cult-film-in-waiting will do gangbuster business on DVD.  And the idea of an unrated version with extras has fans salivating.

""Team America"" is hands-down the funniest and smartest movie of the year.  It is also a guaranteed pleasent surprise for anyone doubting just how great a puppet movie can be.",1110931200,8,4379,4.865047233468286

This movie was f**king hilarious, no joke kids, it's a gut buster.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll cringe all the way through this movie.  Mat and Tray have managed to make yet another outrageously funny flick.  There were times I was in danger of peeing myself and other times I was just kind'a ashamed for laughing.  I couldn't believe the stuff they got a way with in this movie, not to mention what they were making the puppets do.  I mean it's not every day you see puppets having sex, and lots of sex at that ( you'd be surprised at how many positions you can get a puppet into).  I'm sure Pinocchio never got wood like these string danglers, and I'm sure the people at the Jim Henson Company never thought puppets could be so......um......... saucy.  It's got every thing you need to laugh and feel dirty all in one 2 hour fart joke.

 Now if you're looking for a serious peak into the realm of world politics and America's worldly tactics, then go watch CNN or the O'Reilly Factor.  If you're going into this movie I warn you to leave your tight a** political agenda at the box office.  If you're not a fan of the South Parks boys, or you take US and World politics too damn serious then this movie is going to piss you the f**k off.  If you do not have a sense of humor this movie will destroy you and you will leave up set and damaged and ""If you can't take a joke, then go the f**k home"".",1109116800,,2445,4.37250554323725
2218774,5,B0007LPLMY,"I... can't say enough good things about this movie. This film has to be the funniest film i have ever seen. It's worth seeing just for the soundtrack which is nothing short of perfect. Matt and Trey have a unique way of putting a film together that you could not expect from any other movie-makers. I just hope that when the DVD comes out they will put enough extras in that will make people buy it on impulse so that they can see it.. and die laughing. I'd like to add that i have been a fan of south park for 2 years and own series 1-4 and can't wait for series 5 to come out, so i can relive those hilarious episodes (towlie, anyone!) I have seen every south park episode up to 814 and i am looking forward to series 9 which airs on March 9th. Also, i'm 14 and i can't see why people say that ""you must to be 17 to see this movie"" why?

Look how much i care, Stan, see, look at my face, this is how much i care.

Sorry, i just had to get a south park quote in there somewhere :)

Anyway, if you are not offended by south park you will love this movie.",1108944000,,1054,3.9158878504672896
2218775,4,B0007LPLMY,"Anyone that watches South Park know that Trey Stone and Matt Parker like to make adult political satires based on pop culture and contemporary politics with a no-holds-bar style of bashing.  Team America: World Police is not any different.

In Team America, the patriotic soldiers of freedom (Namely, Team America) are depicted at reckless, overreacting, over-destructive soldiers despite their good intentions of protecting people.  In the first scene, they blow up Paris while trying to stop four terrorists, later they do the same in Cairo.  Kim Jong Il and the terrorists are portrayed in stereotypical fashion of Middle Eastern/Islamic males with turbans on their heads, spouting off idiotic sounding jibberish (""Durka, Durka!  Muhammed Jihad!!"").  Kim Jong Il is quite comical in his role as he kills Hans Blix, hosts a peace rally and even breaks into song at one point.  The Hollywood celebs are depicted as... well, wusses.  People, that prefer to blame those who fight terrorism, rather than the terrorists themselves and even band together with Kim Jong Il to stop Team America.

Now believe it or not, but this all serves a purpose to explain a sort of ""balance"" in the world between those who fight terrorism, those who sue for peace and those who oppose peace.  It's rather interesting, but this is a review, not a political commentary.

Now politics aside, this movie is not for anyone under 17.  The jokes are rather crude, involving drunken vomiting, an explicit sex scene, blown up bodies, animals eating corpses, shark attack... all involving puppets.  Which makes it rather humorous in some areas, especially with the ""Kung fu"" fight scenes.  The puppet works is done extremely well in some scenss, but horribly done in others, which is supposed to make it funny.

Team America was extremely funny when I first saw it in theatres.  I hit the floor laughing when Michael Moore... well, you'll just have to see.  However, the 2nd time around, it wasn't all that funny, especially after the tsunami incident in Asia.  It's mostly shock humor that loses it's taste to the general audience after the first showing.  Nonetheless, I still enjoyed this movie emensely and I recomend it to anyone that desires to see another side of the political spectrum.

Be forewarned, this movie will probably offend you no matter what political idealogy you follow.  But do not let that ruin the experience.",1108944000,,2407,5.012594458438287
2218776,5,B0007LPLMY,"If you haven't been keeping up on current world issues or have lived under a rock for the last 10 years, this movie is not for you. If you thought of bringing your kids along, because it has puppets, don't. If you have an open mind, and are not offended by crude humor, puppet sexuality and violence, and severe stereotypes, this movie is brilliant.

If you are a fan of South Park you will feel right at home. This movie delivers the same one liners you come to expect in an episode of South Park. The movie pulls no punches and takes jabs at celebrities big and small.

The music deserves its own review. The music in this movie made me laugh harder than I ever have before in my life. Seriously. The Team America theme song is pure genius.

If you are sensitive about the current situation with terrorism and the way we tend to handle it with our current situation, this movie may not be up your alley. If you can see the humor in all of it and feel like a good laugh, run, swim, fly, do whatever possible to go see this movie.",1108857600,,1030,4.218274111675127

I still can't believe how hard I laughed at this movie. I missed huge chunks of it, as I tried to get myself under control. This is EASILY the funniest movie I've seen in the last 10 years. The only movies that I can think of that hold a candle to it are ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Blazing Saddles"".

If you're easily offended, don't even bother. You may spontaneously combust. It's that bad.

2218778,3,B0007LPLMY,"Team America: World Police is as stupid as it promises to be. In the interest of full disclosure, I generally enjoy the cable TV series South Park, but Matt Stone and Trey Parker seem to miss the mark with their movies.

The problem with Team America, I think, is a simple one. When Parker and Stone do movies, they aren't limited by the stricter mores of television. While their stuff usually has some good seeds, they rarely develop into anything in their films as it's much easier to issue a string of curse words. If that were to happen once or twice in the movie, it could be funny. When it happens every five minutes, it gets old.

For all of the flaws though, there are some great moments. The music is full of foul words, but hilarious, and the highlight of the soundtrack has to be Kim Jung Il - - yes, the North Korean dictator - - singing ""Lonely"". Since the characters are marionettes, their movements have much of the same funny, fake quality as those in the South Park series. Parker and Stone capitalize on this at crucial moments in the plot, creating automatic comic relief. The creators also use computer animation, sometimes subtly, to make the characters seem more real when they want to.

I'm not trying to be too serious in picking apart the movie as it should be clear that it's not going to be up for Academy Awards. But Parker and Stone have a gift for making an audience laugh and they have a unique perspective on the world. The movie uses the same technique as the South Park series of making enemies of both sides of a debate: The movie opens with the Team obliterating the heart of Paris. So, from the beginning, the movie is a commentary on America's ignorant use of power and insensitivity to other cultures and customs.

At the same time, some liberal ambassadors of Hollywood and New York City aren't spared. The Screen Actors Guild becomes the Film Actors Guild (apparently so the acronym can spell the word FAG,) and is headed up by none other than Alec Baldwin. Most of the celebrity marionettes meet extremely violent ends as they square off against the Team in their quest to rule the world. In one hilarious moment, Michael Moore blows himself up, taking Team headquarters with him, as he becomes a martyr for peace.

This is one to rent, in my opinion, but it's definitely good for some yucks if you at all like the Parker/Stone sense of humor.",1107993600,9,2385,4.524361948955916

2218780,5,B0007LPLMY,"A lot of reviewers have complained that the puppet work in this film was so obvious that it distracted the reviewers from the plot.  Frankly, I liked the way the director made sure the audience understood these weren't animations or CGI's. The director was working in a medium that hearkens back to the obviousness, simplicity, and, yes, childishness, of Punch & Judy, Howdy Doody, and Kukla, Fran, and Ollie.

The plot wasn't any dumber that an 007 James Bond flic and the lashing the writers gave the Left, the Right, and  International Terrorism was in perfect harmony with young, bright, clever minds who see hypocrisy and danger in every political posture. Honestly, I found Team America's message easier to accept than Michael Moore's recent stuff.

I really liked this film and I thought the production values--  expensive sets, great musical numbers, clever work with marionettes' clothes, facial expressions, and ""intimate"" connections-- showed the producers weren't  working on the cheap. And, I laughed a lot. A whole lot.",1107907200,16,1033,5.155688622754491
2218781,1,B0007LPLMY,"The problem with this film is not that Trey Parker and Matt Stone have taken a politically-incorrect stance in this film, that they attack popular entertainment figures, or that they are offensive and use stereotypes - these are all excusable with a good script. Sadly, contrary to everything said about this movie, the jokes are repetitive (think scene after scene of the same gags being wheeled out, puerile physical humour and bland, childish satire which misses the mark), and the puppets are poorly animated, often the source of ""look how jerkily they move"" comedy, which fails to impress. The problem with this movie is not that their understanding of world events is shallow and trite, and that they utterly miss the chance to make the audience think, or to use clever metaphor or satire, so much as that the jokes are universally bad. Worth watching only because it's popular and over-hyped; then to fight the corner of far funnier comedies which go unnoticed.",1107820800,7,968,4.9447852760736195

2218783,5,B0007LPLMY,"This brilliant movie starts out on an inspiring note, with the destruction of the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre (Voila and Adieu). And then it just gets funnier and better. The puppets appear quite human so that there's no problem with the ""suspension of disbelief."" The heroes are quite fallible but very likable.

There's some spectacular cinematography in the Panama Canal scenes and in Egypt, where the Great Pyramid and the venerable Sphinx suffer the same fate as the Eiffel and the Louvre. The Mount Rushmore scenes, (HQ of Team America) are also impressive.

Gary is an actor appearing in a Broadway musical when the Team approaches him for help. One of the most gripping scenes is Gary singing lead in a rendition of the hit song Everyone Has AIDS. The camera catches the emotional audience as some individuals shed an elegant, politically appropriate tear or two. Priceless!

Things turn even more hilarious with the appearance of the Film Actors Guild (FAG), led by the silver-tongued Alec Baldwin. His speech, interrupted by rapturous desk-thumping by the assembled FAG-ers that include Susan Sarandon, Sean Penn, Jeanine Garofalo and a particularly DUH Matt Damon, is something to cherish. The media comments by some of these esteemed celebrities are equally hilarious.

Then there is of course the intercourse, a passionate scene between two attractive teamsters, giving new meaning to Leonard Cohen's album title Various Positions. This is just a short interlude; I didn't find it particularly shock- or noteworthy. People do get up to these types of trick in the grip of passion.

Kim Jong Il is definitely a star of the movie with his cute accent and his banally evil personality. I caught myself entertaining thoughts of sympathy for Kim as he fed Hans Blix to his pet sharks. And the feeding itself reminded one again of the awesome savage power of nature. ""Brix"" (as Kim called him) learnt a lesson for trying to impose his Euroweenie nuancy boy stuff on the dear leader of North Korea. What arrogance to attempt such a thing!

In the meantime, the porcine propagandist, also known as Michael Moore, has caused great damage at the Mount Rushmore HQ by blowing himself up with a suicide jacket. But when things look bleak, Gary returns as the hero. Kim is entertaining the FAG celebrities plus delegations of dignitaries from around the world. This is to distract them while his minions are preparing to set off 230 major bombs around the world.

Just in time Gary frees the team, then he uses all his skills as an actor and orator to deliver an eloquent speech that completely upstages Alec Baldwin, the master of ceremonies. The detonation of the bombs is averted and a fight to the death ensues between the Team and the Hollywood actors. A particularly sleazy looking Sean Penn meets his end at the fangs of a big black kitty cat, Sarandon is sliced in two and the others are shot in riveting gun battles.

My only complaint is that I sorely missed Parker and Stone's most lovable characters, the Canadian master comedians Terrance and Phillip, whose movie Asses Of Fire contributed so much to making the South Park Movie so unforgettable. A bit of Terrance and Phillip's flatulence and coprofilia would have made this little gem even funnier.

Easily bored, I don't like long movies. I am pleased to report that Team America: World Police is just the right length. No scenes are superfluous or too lengthy, and the action sequences are all in the right places. I think it is going to become a cult movie like The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The best songs are the aforementioned Broadway number and Kim's I'm So Ronery ...

Team America: World Police has a progressive and subversive message that ought to please everybody across the political spectrum, from the leftist moonbat to the conservative fruitcake and all people with a sense of humour inbetween. The Gnostic nature of Gary's speech with which he wins over the audience of worldwide dignitaries, is particularly striking. Underneath all the vulgar references to reproductive and other organs, there is a profound message to people who like to ponder these things.

I also strongly recommend Stone and Parker's South Park TV series, the movie South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut and the CD Chef Aid. This talented duo's genius and wicked sense of humour are quite unmatched in popular culture today.",1106956800,11,4377,4.917344173441735

It is low brow, extremely crude, and in-your-face. The use of puppets is nothing short of genius.  They are done very well, yet Matt and Trey take time to mock the limitations and nuances of puppetry.  This whole movie uses chiches and stereotypes to the fullest and to hilarious effect.  NOBODY is spared.  Actors get bashed.  Politics gets bashed.  The right gets bashed.  The left gets bashed.  Not a single soul is spared.

On a side note, its too bad people let their politics get in the way. A lot of people have expressed outrage that Stone and Parker would DARE make fun of Michael Moore and liberal Hollywood. Bash the right, fine, bash the left... watch out!! I find this amusing and irritating at the same time.  I think its all fair game, and for those uptight people out there, NO, this movie is not a conservative Bush-loving re-election vehicle. That is ridiculous.

The USA needs to learn that there is a world outside North America and that world generally classes Americans as gung-ho morons.  And the rest of the world generally do not class actors as potentially powerful political figures....?!?

Your ignorance of other cultures, your gung-ho attitude to everything and your belief that ""The American way"" is the only way.

I don't know whether Trey Parker & Matt Stone are pro-war or anti-war, they seem to be just anti-idiot to me.  Unfortunatly for you, you are percieved by the rest of the world as Idiots.

2218791,5,B0007LPLMY,"TEAM AMERICA is the foulest, dirtiest, most rude and obnoxious and ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS movie I have ever seen.  The great thing about the film is that it is absolutely heedless of who it offends or takes shots at.  And believe me, it has something offensive for everyone.

In short, it details the misadventures of a group of anti-terrorist Americans, working out of a supersecret  homebase in the middle of Mt. Rushmore.  These gung-ho heroes hunt down terrorists wherever they find them.  In the opening sequence, the team descends on Paris to wipe out some terrorists with a WMD in a briefcase.  While they DO take out the terrorists, they also manage to destroy the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and the Arch d Triumphe.  Certainly they do more damage to Paris than the bomb in the suitcase.  Later, they destroy the Pyramids and the Sphinx stopping another group of terrorists.  The point is obviously that these deeply right-wing nuts are alienating the world, blundering into situations without regard for consequences, etc. etc.  So, we think the movie is bashing the supposedly extremist Bush-administration.

But then, when we learn the Kim Jong Il of North Korea has a huge plan for basically disrupting all of civilization (mostly so he gets a little attention), the tables turn - very pointedly making fun of all the celebrities and their peace-mongering.  Alec Baldwin, Tim Robbins, George Clooney and on and on are shown as knee-jerk liberals who can't even make a cogent case against Team America...except to say something about ""big corporations.""

So the creators of the movie play fair...everyone is skewered.  Although I would have to say that in the end, the left wing is more soundly skewered, primarily because all the celebrities are dispatched in the most horrifically violent and amusing ways possible.

Among other joys are the most lengthy and graphic projectile vomiting in film history (giving Monty Python's The Meaning of Life a run for its money), a very graphic sex scene, and some wonderful songs that make fun of everything from Michael Bay's PEARL HARBOR to the current wave of country-western pro-American songs.

Oh, and of course, it's all done with puppets.  This makes virtually every clich the movie indulges in very funny instead of clichd.  (Hey, he's giving a clichd ""rah-rah"" speech...but he's a puppet, so it's funny.)

My wife and I (both in our early 40s) had tears running down our faces during much of this movie.  It's so over-the-top, so shocking and yet so right on the money about most of the subjects it pokes fun at.  To really enjoy it, I think, you have to have some idea of current affairs.  If you don't understand that during the last election, a big group of celebrities worked really hard to prevent Bush from being reelected, you might wonder why all these celebrities go to North Korea.  If you don't know who Hans Blix, the UN weapons inspector, is...you won't understand the scene he's in.

Also, folks, please don't take little kids to this.  It's packed with so much cussing, so much racist humor, so much graphic sex and so much adult humor (in the best possible sense), that I really think a 10-year old might be scarred for life!  But if you're an older teen or an adult with a strong stomach...have a great time.  This movie is certainly in my top 5 movies of 2004, and in my top 20 best comedies of all time.

From their description of pre-war Iraq to the speech at the end, they make it clear that yes, the war could have been handled better, and no, Iraq isn't a flowering paradise now that we've stepped in, but overall we're still the good guys and Iraq is still better off now than it was before. And amidst all this highbrow political humor, there's a generous serving of slapstick and bathroom humor to balance things out. At some points, I laughed so hard that I had tears in my eyes.

Much like the original Thunderbirds series, this is a bit of a poke at a few movies, Thunderbirds / Star Wars I picked up on easily, theres probably more.

The movie like I said is a lot like South Park, even the same SP voices are heard all through the film. I have to say, I expected Trey and Matt to come up with somethign absolutly hilarious with this film. Sure, it did have a great speach at the end, and a funny love making scene with 2 of the puppets, but I truely think they couldve made it a much funnier movie, cause at times, it was...well, almost like a serios movie!!! I don't know if thats a compliment or insult to Trey?!

Overall, it's an ok film, I hope when it's on DVD there is tonnes of bonus features that will get my thumbs up to buy.

Update: 7th June 2005

I've just watched TA on DVD and it looks and sounds great. I kind of missed the point that it was meant to be an action film more then comedy, so i guess i was in a state of miss interpreting on my first reveiw. The movie is fun, but I still find it a 3 and half star comedy. I understand now that it had a huge production and wasn't the easiest of films to make, but i do agree with something Trey and Matt say in the bonus features, it was definitly time to make a movie that didn't use CGI and go back to an old school process, and i couldn't agree more.

The extras are a bunch of featurettes, ranging from storyboaring, intervewis, behind the scenes etc, plus the usual trailers, and some deleted scenes that arnt hard to work out why they where cut out. But i'm a bit disapointed, I thought Try and Matt would have some ideas for hilarious extras, like interveiws with the puppets, or an actual deleted Jabba The Hut scene that Trey is always going on about as a joke whenever he can. And i'm very suprised there is no audio commentary.

Still a good movie to own, gonnah be interesting watching it from now on and looking for little props made of things lying around the house!",1104278400,2,2231,4.257683215130023
2218801,5,B0007LPLMY,"""Team America - World Police"" is a dangerous movie!  Within the first 20 minutes, I had to step out of the theatre and into the lobby to rest.  My head hurt from laughing, tears blurred my vision, and my runny nose nearly sufficated me.  I survived the rest of the movie but now I'm having flashbacks, laughing outloud at random times during the day.  Strangers move away from me.  Friends and colleagues are worried about me.  This movie is dangerous!

To C. Shea (and other uptight reviewers here)... loosen up!  It's political satire.  Team America is not anti-Bush nor pro-Kerry.  It's anti-everybody.  If you would have watched it through and with an open mind, you would have seen liberals and conservatives bashed equally.  Political correctness was nowhere to be found and it's great!  We live in ""America"" where we should be able to laugh at ourselves outloud.  Although exaggerated, there's a lot of truth here.  Good or bad, the fact remains the USA is the ""world police"" these days and you're in denial if you think otherwise.  Sounds like you have a guilty conscious and/or extreme insecurity.  Being the American ""patriot"" that you are, you might want to work on your English language/writing skills.

Anyway... I came on Amazon.com today in hopes that ""Team America - World Police"" would be out on video.  It's not available yet but I'll be waiting impatiently until it is.  I guess I should order an oxygen tank at the same time.",1103760000,8,1445,4.77327935222672
2218802,2,B0007LPLMY,"I went and saw this film opening night with some friends let me tell ya this ain't that funny.  Team America is another ""Creative"" film braugh to you by the creators of south park.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone are really great writers/Directors and my question is WHAT WENT WRONG!  This movie had some laugh and gags(i.e the scene were the main character is vomiting for about 1 minutes or so) and that's it.  Sure this movie is crude but hey what were you expecting it's from the creators of South Park.  Now the plot is pretty funny but trust me it's not.  I have a sence of Humor and everything but I didn't find this film all that it was cooked up to be.

Trey Parker and Matt Stone should just stick to South Park.  This is probably one of there worst films IF you rank it up with all there other films(Orgazmo, BASEketball).

I thought South Park Bigger, Longer and Uncut was funnier then this.  Now overall If I had to choose Trey Parker and Matt Stone's best film it would have to be Orgazmo, hands down.

Overall the crude Humor, explicet language and the toilet humor may be funny for certain people and ages and for some not but for me they just tried to make this junk over the top which they shouldn't have cause near the end of the film where the character uses his Speech to save America it was just...not funny..

Overall I give it a 2.0 out of 5 stars

Shame on you Guys you know better then this.  I also wanna point at this film is worst then South Park as the use of Profanity is over the top and lots of explicit violence and gore(mainly near the end of the film)makes this one of the most overthe top Puppet films ever..Not to mention the Sex Scene which was originally 2 minutes or so I heard that got it's NC-17 but still this ""toned down"" version is still as bad as the way the creators wanted it to be.

Not a good film but if you wanna check out a really great film by these guys then check out Orgazmo which is a really funny film.

After I had dried my eyes from the tears of laughter; after the 'theme song' with its catchy headline (""America, f... yeah, got to save the m.....f...... world"") had finally stopped bouncing around in my head; after I managed to stop chuckling quietly, or not-so-quietly, occasioning my wife and daughters to look at me oddly and shaking their heads; after sleeping over it for a night...I finally asked myself whether it was really necessary to be quite as vulgar to get a point across: whatever that point may have been.

The answer, I decided, was 'yes', for, in its contrast with the piss-takes on the universe of Hollyweird movies and the merciless and welcome satire on the theme of actors-and-other-insignificants-turned activists, it makes a serious statement, more profound than any learned discussion is ever likely to produce (or me, writing this!). Tray Parker made it explicit it in an interview with 60 Minutes: ""Society is our only hope"".

Indeed. And society consists of human beings, most of whom have a definite element of vulgarity. I wonder if it isn't true to say that _everybody_ has a core of vulgarity, even if it's covered up by the layers upon layers of thin and fragile veneer. American society evidences this vulgarity more openly than many others, though that isn't an indication that it actually _is_ more vulgar than, say, some of those European nations, who consider themselves more 'refined' and 'cultured'.

The final speech by the actor 'Gary', in front of an assembly of 'world leaders' captivated by the vapid utterances and platitudes of 'Alec Baldwin' (Parker-and-Stone's satire is without mercy or fear) is a vulgar, graphic and utterly to-the-point summary of the essence of Amercian society, what it stands for and against; on those who stand against it; and on the fundamental substance of the 'War on Terror'.

TA:WP not a movie for the faint-hearted, and it has a truly disturbing sequence (and I don't mean the one with the puppets having sex, and at some length) that had the audience dead-silent. But Gary's final verbal show-off against 'Alec', with its extensive and extended use of genital and anal metaphors, was a profoundly patriotic (and screamingly-funny) tirade that surely must go down as one of the most outrageous monologues in film history.

2218804,4,B0007LPLMY,"First, this movie is hilarious.  Simply put.  You will laugh...very loudly.

Second, the filming of this movie is perhaps one of the best viewings of puppetry I've ever seen.  It had Bill Pope from the three Matrix movies, so you know there was a lot of talent on this.  After 5 minutes you will forget that they are puppets...how they landed many of the expressions is beyond me!

Third, this movie will not ""change"" your political leanings in any sense.  I'm a fairly liberal guy, and very much an active discusser of global warming and things that I feel there is much to think about.  But even I can laugh at the absurdity with which Hollywood and politics in general presents issues like candy being fed to the masses.  Matt and Trey do a great job of handling this, and handling the emotions we've all gone through (those of us in the USA) in the past few years.

Finally, I have to say this movie was a breath of fresh air in comparison to the once great ""South Park"", for many years my favorite show, which has become so muddled in lack of plot and heavy-handed libertarian leanings (which I generally agree with) that, with the exception of certain new episodes, has nearly driven me away.

Yeah, the puppet sex is a little out there (didn't stop me from laughing however) and the puppet barfing scene is goes a little far, but hey, would they be Trey Parker and Matt Stone if they didn't go too far?

I laughed so hard through this movie (both times I saw it) that I got a headache.  I've never been so happy about a headache in my life.

2218806,5,B0007LPLMY,"In its own way this movie is quite amazing, when i saw the first trailor for this movie it was an immediate must see for me, especially with Trey Parker and Matt Stone behind the whole thing (creators of southpark) and doing most of the voices. From the very start of this movie it had the audience errupting with laughter. Starts of in the usual action genre way, the terrorists try to blow up a city in France but are stopped by the good guys 'Team America World Police'. The first scene is quite perfect it lets you know what to expect later in the film, immediately launches into a bloody affair with a lot of humour, no man alive could leave their seat after that one unless you were deeply offended.

This movie is deffinately not for the weak stomach, shows a lot of rather desgusting scenes some maybe a little over the top but they are hilarious including some very wild sex scenes. They have done a great job with the puppet work but didn't try to make it to detailed in several scenes they made the walking or pointing look dodgy but on purpose, the movie wouldn't be the same without them.

I have seen a few other puppet based movies, all were extremely crap quite boring with no humour, I knew that Team America was not going to be alike right from the time i saw the trailor. The movie includes good explosions some cool sets in which they placed the puppets and maybe a little too detailed blood scenes which didn't bother me but could well bother some others.

The movie is very offensive to quite a lot of people includes a lot of recognised people including Michael Moore, Alec Baldwin, Sharon stone, Matt damon and leader kim jong I1. The movie greatly makes fun of the actors movie guild calling the guild f.a.g and most of the recognised people who like to work against America.

One of the most hilarious films of our time if you don't like south park you might not want to watch this, a deffinate no-no for any children the movie will ruin there minds, but if you are in for a real laugh go and give the movie a go.",1102291200,,2039,4.343832020997375

2218810,2,B0007LPLMY,"South Park was an excellent creation by Trey Parker and Matt Stone.  The creators of South Park took their success a step father and created South Park the Movie.  These are superb works in my mind, but Team America may have gone a step too far without enough careful planning.

There are a few funny parts in the movie although I feel the comedy is geared towards an immature crowd, and how can the creators appeal to an immature crowd when the movie is rated R.  Only an immature crowd would be amused by long sex scenes with dolls, Gary's five minute vomit scene, and people with speech impediments.  Team America was intended to be a comedy and was also intended to be politically incorrect and offend a lot of people.  It succeeded in doing this however did not offend me.  The producers relied on the maturity level of the viewer to be low in order for the intended comedy to work.

The rating system for movies that come out have very strict guidelines that have to be followed.  Due to Team America, I believe there should be another rating in between R and X.  Team America deserves the R rating it got but compared to other movies who have received an R rating, Team America should be worse.

I was truly disappointed in the movie.  When previews began I was excited to see Team America thinking it would be ten times better than any South Park.  I believe that a single half hour episode of South Park has the same amount of comedy as this movie showed.  A person who enjoys South Park has a better chance of enjoying this movie than someone who does not like South Park.

If you feel that watching dolls on strings prance around, fake buildings exploding, long doll sex and vomit scenes and speech impediments are absolutely hilarious, then Team America: World Police is a movie for you.",1101772800,5,1799,4.492307692307692

2218812,4,B0007LPLMY,"Except perhaps for The Passion of the Christ, I can't think of a film I've seen that is more deserving of its ""R"" rating than Team America: World Police. There is plenty in this movie to offend everyone and I strongly encourage those who are offended by, well, everything you can imagine that's offensive (and some creatively offensive stuff you haven't imagined yet), to skip it. However, for those who process the world as I do -- a little off-key and out-of-focus, then the absurdity of the film results in one of the most ironic celebrations of uniquely American freedom of expression I've ever witnessed. (I'll get back that in a minute.)

Again, before you interpret what I'm saying as encouragement to see the film, let me repeat once more that it is filled with sophomoric goof-ball stupidity (probably only enjoyed by fans of Three Stooges and South Park) and content guaranteed to offend you and anyone else who is straight or gay or of any ethnic background or gender. It wallows in vulgarity, crudeness and violence and sex (involving puppets). You will likely hate it and wonder why I had anything positive to say about it. But I do, and not because it is said to be ""anti-Michael-Moore."" Indeed, it's been said that right-wingers will love the movie because it mocks Michael Moore, Alec Baldwin and the whole pretentious Hollywood leftist cartel. And while the movie does those things (to put it mildly), there is no way the right-wingers I know will love a film skewering American foreign policy as one characterized by a doctrine of blow-up first, ask questions later (nor, for that matter, will they be receptive to a running joke about multiples of 911). This is not a film that will please the anti-Michael-Moore crowd despite the graphicallly pleasant way the marionette version of Moore, a suicide bomber, is blown to smithereens (and this is one of the less-puppet-violent scenes in the film).

At its core, the movie is less a political polemic than it is a chomping satire of Hollywood action films -- of boilerplate plot lines, cinematic devices, big-time genre directors, musical scores and, in hilarious fashion -- the use of montages to communicate in a couple of minutes how the central character is transformed from inexperienced into expert. There are so many baseball-bat-to-the-head slams at Hollywood cliches, it is impossible to keep up with them. A wonderful example of the depth of the filmakers' Shermanesque approach to torching Hollywood is a song that compares how much the singer loves someone to how bad the film Pearl Harbor was. And, if you sit through the entire ending credits, you'll be treated to a short ditty called, ""You're Useless, Alec Baldwin."" Members of the Film Actors Guild (FAGs) are portrayed as unwitting puppets (metaphorically and literally) of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il who is one of the funniest characters in the movie.

Again, while I encourage you to skip seeing it if you're the least put-off by, say, the longest vomit-scene in movie history, this film is a celebration of a brand of artistic freedom that is uniquely American and, frankly, hard to understand by others. I say this because it is a big-studio, big-time production that is clearly intended to be hugely profitable by pandering to those who like to drink crudeness at a firehose, where profit motivations far outweigh the chances that all involved with the movie will likely have a death-sentence issued on them by some fundamentalist cleric somewhere. As this film is viewed around the world, the international audiences will both laugh ""at"" the stereotypically American xenophobe, portrayed as trigger-happy cowboys who will blow up the Louvre in order to kill four terrorists. Still those international viewers will be unconsciously (or perhaps knowlingly) confronted by the extraordinary fountain of creative freedom that allows such work to be produced and released in the U.S.",1101513600,2,3925,5.016871165644171

Our heroes are out to save the world from militant Muslims and the Communist terror of Kim Jong Il---and the naive actors like Sean Penn, Alec Baldwin, and Helen Hunt who stand in their way.  The terror masters manipulate the Hollywood crowd to unwittingly further their evil plans.  And no, this film is not even slightly politically correct.  Everyone may be offended.  Both the religious right and the goofy left will find things to appall them.  The vulgar language and wild sex scenes (yes Virginia, puppets do indeed enjoy sex!) will definitely get your attention.

Team America's irreverent and insightful look at today's terrorist threat makes it well worth your time.  Ultimately, it not too subtly argues that the terrorists must be opposed by violence.

It's no wonder that actors and politicians are handled the same way in Team America; they're all such great actors! I think a movie like Team America is necessary in the world today. The world needs to watch this movie to see how ignorant Americans really are. We are the Mountain Dew chugging, ""bad guy"" killing, foul-mouthed capital of the world... and we're proud of it!

2218816,5,B0007LPLMY,"To think, I almost missed this movie at the box office.  My excuse was something like ""puppets?"".  If anything, puppets have always caused me that queasiness many get from clowns, or the movie Deliverance for that matter.  I couldn't see how puppets...i'm sorry, ""marionettes"" could make for a gripping action/comedy.

How wrong I was.

The creators (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) who busted our guts with paper cutouts (as in South Park) have once again opened up a new front for their sometimes political, often insightful, and always hilarious expression.  In the first 10 seconds of the movie any pretense or prejudice I had around puppets immediately evaporated.

Team America: World Police is a hyper-dramatic odyssey set in modern times.  The movie follows a crack team of American Commandos in their pursuit of ""terrorism"".  The protagonists are good natured and simple to the point of absurdity, the antagonists are evil to the point of absurdity.

What a fantastic way to make a point.

And that they do.  This movie is rife with micro-lessons/criticisms on everything from world politics, to popular culture.  In the creators typical style, they push every character to their absolute extreme, then lay them against a background of total chaos.  What you get are puppets laying waste to every national treasure they end up in a firefight in, then claiming ""everything is OK, you're all safe, we got the terrorists"" while the broken Eiffel Tower is laying on top of the Arc De Triumph in Paris against a smoldering backdrop of the Louvre.  Good times.

I would be wary of anyone that didn't find this movie hilarious (or at least very entertaining).  For those of you that haven't seen it yet, you have something to look forward to.  For those that have, consider seeing it again, I did, and found it to be (in many ways) funnier the second time around.

2218818,5,B0007LPLMY,"""Team America: World Police"" is the new movie from Matt Stone and Trey Parker. If you never heard of them before, they are the creators of ""South Park."" That is an animated show, that started off with small pieces of construction paper. This one could also be considered an animated movie, except it is done with puppets. Everyone and everything is part of this puppet world, and although the movie is about the war on terrorism, it never touches the government. There is no puppet version of President George W Bush or Saddam Hussain. This movie hits the war from the point of the actors that really think they could make a difference. Actors like Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and even Micheal Moore, who actually causes all of the trouble. The villan is even the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Il, who is using this actors in order to lead the terrorists to victory. Matt Stone and Trey Parker are the funniest people around right now, and everything about this movie is funny, and raunchy. The commericals don't really have anything funny, but that is because everything that is funny can't be shown on television. Everything that we think is funny, is funnier because of the puppets. They fight by bumping into each other, they could be in a serious scene, and then they walk away, but the way they walk into straight, or proper at all. You could do whatever you want with puppets. You could fill them up with as much fake blood as you want, or even liquid that looks like vomit. But, it's alot of work, and I don't think that they would ever try to do it again.

The movie begins in Paris, and the terrorists have plotted a bomb. Luckily, Team America is ready, and they go to Paris to destory the terrorists, while also destorying Paris. They stopat nothing to defeat evil. They meet in Mount Rushmore, led by Spottswoode, and there is Carson, Lisa, Chris, Joe, and Sarah, and just as Carson proposes to Lisa, he is shot and killed by a terrorist. With the loss of Carson, they must replace him with somebody who could pretend to be a terrorist, so they hire Gary, a Broadway actor, who is known for the hit song ""Everyone Has AIDS."" He doesn't want the job, but when he realizes that ""Freedom Isn't Free"" he takes it. He dresses up as a terrorists, filled with facial hair, and heads over to the Middle East. But Kim Jong Il is really the villan, and he is using the Hollywood actors to get the terrorist activity around  the world. As Lisa doesn't want to get attached to another person for fear of losing him, strife comes to the Team America headquarters. What makes things worse is the headquarters gets hit with a bomb, and the Team America gang gets captured, and it's up to Gary to save the day.

As I said, everything is funnier when it is done with puppets, and sex is not an exception. There is a hilarious graphic puppet sex scene that takes about forty five seconds long. It was edited a few times, so hopefully on the DVD we could see everything. This movie is not a movie where Matt or Trey voice their beliefs about the war, but it is a movie that is about them thinking that actors think they are better then everybody else, and that they know more. I love what they do to them, and I love all the movie references. I'm sure somethings went over my head, and that means other people too, but you have to always pay attention during this movie. Even the song lyrics have comedy in them, and I love the lament of Kim Jong Il. It fits it perfectly. ""Team America: World Police"" is a great movie, and it is the funniest of the year. Matt Stone and Trey Parker are geniuses.

And remember. . . America! F**k yeah!

ENJOY!

2218819,5,B0007LPLMY,"This movie may just be the funniest movie I have ever seen. Even though the last twenty minutes were aa bit glib, the rest was absolutely hysterical. Clever humour, hillarious songs, great lines, and fabulous puppet acting make this movie one of the funniest movies ever.

The most intriguing part however, as some patriots might not notice, is that the main spoof in the movie is how we take such pride in our country and our strong beliefs, and lies, about terrorist organizations. I, however, am quite the total opposite of a patriot, so I quickly noticed this effect. The greater thing about this movie is that Matt and Trey took all the things we were told terrorists had (i.e. Weapons of mass destruction) and showed how it would have been if all of this was true.

And the puppet sex scene: 6 stars.",1099526400,4,806,4.590277777777778
2218820,3,B0007LPLMY,"Team America: World Police did not look like a movie that would be very good to see.  The trailers for the movie were obviously un-funny, due to the fact that most of the funny content is too obscene for preview material.  I was unsure about seeing this movie.  I liked the South Park movie, but could I stand sitting through an hour and a half of puppets.  I wasen't sure until I heard three words:  Puppet Sex Scene.

T.A.W.P. is basically making fun of America's foreign policy of trying to police the world.  Everytime the World Police try to stop a terrorist, they end up destroying more in the country that they are in, than the terrorists would have, i.e. destroying pyramids in Egypt when trying to stop terrorists.

The movie does a fair job of poking fun at both liberals and conservatives.  The people that got made fun of the most were Kim Jung Il, and a Hollywood actors group, Film Actors Guild (F.A.G.)  Alec Baldwin, George Clooney, Tim Robbins, and Liv Tyler get made fun of big time and also get killed.  Along with the pig Michael Moore, whom Trey Parker portrays as a incredible fat guy holding two hot dogs with ketchup and mustard stains all over his shirt. GREAT!!

The movie itself has a decent plot, but the funny parts are spread out too far and there is a lot of not funny talking in between.  The best part of the movie is, by far, the puppet sex scene.  I don't know if I have ever laughed so hard in any part of a movie as I did watching this sex scene.  And this scene had to be cut down so that the movie would not receive an NC-17 rating. I can't imagine what was cut out.  Another highlight of the film were the songs.  The ""theme"" song for Team America was entitled ""America - F*** Yeah!"" and was it a catchy song.  Also Kim Jung Il""s ""Ronley"" song and the song that tells how much freedom costs ($1.05) are also hilarious.

My overall opinion is that Team America: World Police is definately worth seeing one time.  The second time would probably get old and tiresome, due to the fact that most of the jokes are heavy on shock value.  It is not the funniest film of the year, but if you are a fan of South Park or Stone and Parker's humor, you will definately like this movie.  And watch out for Stone and Parker.  They are making a heavy case to be this generations Mel Brooks, by becoming the new kings of the spoof.",1099526400,2,2354,4.3
2218821,4,B0007LPLMY,"The ideas in this movie were so intelligent.  I actually didn't laugh as much as I thought I would because it was really quite thought-provoking. The sets were incredible...every one of them had to be specially built in miniature for the marionettes, which in part caused Parker and Stone to lament that they would never again do a puppet movie.  We are lucky they made this one.  If they had made a movie which was more in their element (animation), it probably would have flowed a little more smoothly, which was a small flaw, I thought, with Team America.

The celebrities who were ridiculed in this movie a) are grown-ups and can handle it and b) frankly deserved it.  Thank you, Matt and Trey, for finally letting us laugh at the Hollywood elite.  Time and time again, we have to watch them spouting whatever ignorant and badly worded agenda they have in the most inappropriate places (the Academy Awards, a daytime talk show with unsuspecting guests, etc...).  It's not merely ""having opinions"", as another reviewer suggested, that makes these celebrities such juicy targets.  It's the annoying and frequently obnoxious way they choose to voice their said opinions.

I'm a sucker for music, and the songs are well-written and darkly funny.  Even the background music perfectly underscores the action and love scenes.  It just shows how important the music is to the overall punch of any movie.

Make sure you support these guys!  I doubt that the Hollywood crowd will be doing much for these two, being that Parker and Stone pummeled them so thoroughly.  I will be purchasing the soundtrack and DVD, when it comes out.",1099353600,4,1624,4.836956521739131
2218822,4,B0007LPLMY,"South Park creators Parker and Stone have outdone themselves with this puppet show inspired in it's appearance by the wonderful Gerry Anderson ""Supermarionation"" TV show from the 1960's, Thunderbirds (available on DVD if you've never seen it). However, beyond the puppets and model aircraft, this show is nothing like a Gerry Anderson kids' show. The humor ranges from making fun of poor quality movies and bad acting to slamming extreme political views on both the right and left, and does a great job throughout the entire range.

The only flaws in this film seem to come in the same area that is a problem in some episodes of South Park, which is that there is no self-restraint at all and some jokes are just crude or gross without being particularly clever or funny. However, those few scenes that left me and the rest of the audience cringing or silent were far outweighed by the ones where we laughed very loudly and for quite some time. Examples of some great moments are:

 -A whole song devoted to how bad the film Pearl Harbor was, how it missed the significance of that tragic event, and what a mediocre actor is Ben Affleck.

 - The awkardness of the puppets. Gerry Anderson used to go to great lengths to hide how funny it looked when the puppets walked, but Parker and Stone closely show you just how awkward the puppets are when walking and doing other human activities (e.g., having sex), to great comic effect.

 - Team America is eager to do good, but they ""break"" a lot of stuff doing it, often doing more damage than the bad guys they are chasing.

 - The song during the closing credits. It's hilarious, so be sure to stay through the credits and keep your ears open.

In spite of its flaws, this is one of the sharpest comedies to come along in a while. See it while you can or buy the DVD when it comes out. Hopefully it will have additional funny extra features. I'd love to see outtakes from this film!",1099353600,,1928,4.514367816091954
2218823,4,B0007LPLMY,"MOVIE:  Trey Parker and Matt Stone create a genre within themselves and this is their latest addition.  What this movie basically is, is a spoof of big budget action movies and politics.  The whole movie is laugh out loud.  Whether it was the rebellious actors of the Film Actors Guild (...) teaming with Kim Jong Il or the many spoofs put on action movies. There is an entire montage scene and with it is a song that describes what a montage really is. An entire song is dedicated to Michael Bay and how he screwed up with Pearl Harbor. Then there is puppet sex, oh so hilarious puppet sex. The movie feels a lot like South Park, but it's different enough to hold on its own. Every joke in this movie is laugh out loud funny. I only recount having one or two moments to catch my breath. Every time Team America comes flying out in full force, the Team America theme song plays along, ""Team America, F&%K YEAH!"" Then there's the aspect that they actually got Harry Gregson-Williams to do the score of the movie so it actually sounded like an over-produced action movie. The political references come flying in one after another, and so do the movie references.  Every action movie cliche is addressed here and will have you laughing.  What really makes it funny is the stiff limited movement these puppets have. When the main character fights Samuel L. Jackson it's the funniest thing I have ever seen. The shootouts are hilarious and so is Kim Jong Il who has a solo of singing ""Lonely, I'm So Lonely"".  Absolutely hilarious, is how they make fun of America's ""intelligence"", which is depicted in the movie as a computer that sounds like a teenage stoner.  ""There's no I in Team America"" says the head of operations, (long pause), ""Umm, yeah there is"", says intelligence.  The list goes on and on of what they make fun of, including the depiction of various races and origins like Muslims, Asians, and Hispanics. The movie is a mess, the jokes come flying in hard and fast, it's rude, it's crude, it's one of the funniest things I have ever seen.

ACTING: One of the movie's main continuing joke is actors, so naturally they use puppets instead. Most of the voices are done by Matt and Trey, a lot you will recognize from South Park, but still oh so painfully funny.

BOTTOM LINE: This is one of the most entertaining movies ever made. If you think of this as just plain potty humor you are mistaken. So many political aspects of our world are attacked within the spoofs and satire, same goes for Hollywood. Very original and smart is what this movie is under all the outrageous stunts and scenes. You will be dead tired after this movie from laughing so much, and you will be laughing at it for quite some time after you walk out of the theater. By no means a work of art, but a brilliantly and comically crafted piece of pop culture entertainment.",1099180800,2,2850,4.525291828793774

However, what is most offensive was how it lets Neoconservatives completely off the hook.  The inept World Police take all their orders from a computer, rather than a venal Bush-like weasel.  In fact, Kim Il doesn't come off half as evil as the Hollywood celebrities; who are guilty of having opinions.  For this the filmmakers blow their heads off.  Cute.  This film has no audience because it jumps into an issue in which real lives are being lost, and plays the whole situation for cheap nihilistic laughs.",1099180800,17,673,4.512396694214876

Conservatives should get a big kick out of this script, they really ripped a bunch of blow hard stuck up know it all whinny stupid Hollywood liberals and it was funny as hell.

If you're not a prude you'll find the puppet sex footage incredibly funny, if you're the type that gets offended by twisted minds then the sex and violence will be over the top (even though it's just puppets) and you should just avoid the movie, you won't get it or won't like it.

2218829,4,B0007LPLMY,"I can't believe how much some reviewers have missed the point totally of this movie.
Firstly the puppet work has laughably been called 'cheap'.  It's based on the work of Gerry Anderson who created Thunderbirds, Stingray and Joe 90 among others.  The puppet work in these 60's shows was 'cheap'.  It's like critising a Fellini homage for being filmed in black and white.
Secondly, the destruction of the sites of Paris and Egypt for a few terrorists wasn't just 'dumb violence'.  Wasn't the treasures of Iraq and Afghanistan reduced to rubble in search of the same goal?
It's supposed to be funny people!  Either you 'get' Matt & Trey or you don't - and I can appreciate why a lot of people do not like their somewhat ascerbic take on the world - but at least have enough of the grey cells to understand what they're trying to achieve without missing the point by a mile!
The actual plot about Team America trying to stop terrorists exploding bombs in major world cities does become bogged down in it's own politics towards the end as they try to lampoon just about everyone with a vested interest in world peace or world domination.  You do get the feeling, particularly in the last act, that Matt and Trey were making it up as they went along and adding and changing ideas ad hoc.  I feel that this confused the plot somewhat and perhaps made for a messy finale.
Overall though this is a few notches above 'Cannibal', 'Orgazmo' and 'Baseketball' and should be enjoyed by all fans but is unlikely to find new converts.

It's extremely politically incorrect and hilariously funny.  Even if you're not a big South Park fan, this is a movie you will enjoy.  The characters are so funny.. I mean, who DOESN'T want to see a puppet of North Korean Dictator, Kim Jong Il, sing ""I'm So Ronery""?  It's classic.  The political satire is excellent.  The point they're trying to get across is that actors should quit trying to use their clout to persuade the world into adopting their way of thinking, politically speaking. Just because you have tons of money and starred in last summer's box office hit, doesn't mean you know anything about politics.  I totally agree with the main theme of the movie and found the characters tremendously entertaining.  Anyone who finds this movie offensive must have forgotten that the foundation of our nation is that everyone has the legal right to speak against your government... Be it a protest..

The marionettes jerked and moved awkwardly, but I think Trey and Matt did this on purpose, and it made it that much funnier. They've mentioned many times that they loathed working with puppets, and you can tell they took the easy way out many times. I'm all for that, though, it makes it funnier. Someone was wondering why Pres. Bush wasn't in the movie at all. WAKE UP, MAN. They didn't need Bush. He was completely represented by Team America.

Yeah, people are right when they say that if you like ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" you'll enjoy this one.  The most perverted and profane satire since SPBLU made its way into theaters over five years ago, easy.  It's just fortunate that Trey and Matt's projects are so appropriate for the times.  Of course, that is exactly what also dates their material, but that's a small quibble.

The visuals are meaty and expensive, the songs are laugh-out-loud funny (""But what would yew dew..."" ""Team America, f--- yeah!"" ""I'm so ronery"") and above all the puppetry is craftsmanlike.  Those who can't get into the gross-out humor (endless vomiting scene) will appreciate the technical aspects of it, if for nothing else (the puppet sex scene, hehe).  Listen, that scene was hard to pull off, you  know.  But Trey nails the look of it with those quick dissolves.  It had me in stitches.

Bottom line: this should've been released during the summer, alongside ""Fahrenheit 9/11"".  Because they both have Michael Moore in them.  Hehe.  If this type of gross, violent, profane puppet film tickles your fancy, then definitely check out Peter Jackson's stellar achievement ""Meet The Feebles"".

2218834,4,B0007LPLMY,"I must first note that I DID probably laugh harder at Team America than I ever have at any other film.  It's the most juvenile thing you'll ever see, but really hilarious and surprisingly technically sophisticated.  The parody songs in particular are sheer genius.  You may go in expecting to be offended, but as it turns out, it's so omni-offensive that, unless you're particularly uptight, it's difficult to be actually offended by any of it, even things that in any other context you'd find utterly horrifying.

So why only four stars?  Well, as funny as it was, there were some things that could have been a lot funnier.  Sorry, right-wingers, but the lambasting of liberal ideas was a lot less sophisticated than that of conservative ones.  I don't have a problem with seeing my own beliefs skewered, but Stone and Parker seem to have been struck with a singular lack of creativity in this regard.  Satire has to bear some relation to reality; otherwise, it isn't effective satire, since it's not actually criticizing anything.  Michael Moore as a suicide bomber?  Please.  He's a ripe target for mockery, but that's pretty far off the mark.  I suppose it's probably just that leftist philosophy is less loud and obvious than its right-wing counterpart, but it requires some actual subtlety to mock effectively.  Also, I don't know whether it was just a failure of nerve or if they're carrying water for them or what, but the conspicuous absence of the Bush cabal is disappointing.  Clearly, there was lots of wasted potential for hilarity there.  Finally, although the theory of the three different types of people is funny, you get the distinct impression that Stone and Parker are actually SERIOUS about it, when the fact is, it's pretty moronic as actual sociological analysis.

Still, the positives of this film outweigh the negatives by a great deal.  We could all use a laff or two in these dark times, and Team America provides them in spades.",1098489600,6,1956,4.861027190332326
2218835,4,B0007LPLMY,"I am a huge fan of Trey Parker.  In many ways, I consider him to be, along with his partner Matt Stone, a maverick force in American comedy.  His personal vision is original and his satire is fearless.  His humor is often topical and I almost always find myself nodding in agreement with his iconoclastic insights.  With ""Team America,"" I think Trey made a few mistakes.

The main strength of ""Team America: World Police"" lies in its perfect parody of Bruckheimer action pictures.  To see this idiom done with puppets really exposes its innate stupidity.  Here, Parker triumphs once again.  Parker's score is absolutely hilarious, as always.  We get a G.I. Joe-like Team America theme song (""Freemdom is the only way, yeah...""), a sappy patriotic country ballad, Kim Jong Il's rendition of ""I'm so Ronrey"", and an opining lover's lament in which the lead compares how much he misses his girl with how badly Michael Bay missed the mark when he made the movie ""Pearl Harbor.""  Very funny stuff.

As far as the political content is concerned, I say it is hit and miss.  The representation of the U.S. as a team of self-rightous, freedom fighting, blowhards is very apt.  The running gag of Team America destroying world treasures in their hunt for terrorists is a scream.  However, as much as I am all for the ridicule of self-important celebrities, I found Parker's portrayal of Liberal Hollywood as anti-American ""*ussies"" in cahoots with the terrorists to be extremely misguided.  I happen to think that anyone should feel free to speak their minds whether they have an audience of one or of twenty million.  Just because Sean Penn is an actor doesn't mean that his opinion is worthless.  To suggest that he is naive or even insincere in his political beliefs is just disingenuous and, therefore, not very funny.  By making a movie in which he criticizes celebrities for making political statements, isn't Trey Parker committing the very same crime he is charging to other celeb's?  Isn't that a political statement?  In fact, this film is filled with political statements.  The final assertion, that pacifists are unrealistic *ussies and that ""dangerous"" people actually need a good ass-kicking, is just not productive.  Many people throughout the world consider George Bush to be a dangerous person.  This kind of reasoning, or lack thereof, just gives justification to the actions of terrorists.

All that aside, I give ""Team America"" four stars because it is a damned good movie.  I still think Trey Parker is one of the most important comic minds of the last twenty years.  Definitely check this one out.",1098403200,6,2609,4.913043478260869

~REVIEW~

Originally, this was intended to be a ""That's My Bush!"" movie (You never heard of ""That`s My Bush?""  Only devoted fans have heard of this short-lived sitcom...all 20 of them), but then South Park-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone decided to change its premise entirely and follow the path of Jim Henson.  Thus the two creators produce this off-beat, political action knock-off that is ""Team America: World Police.""  Whether it was paper animation or live-action, oh hell, Matt and Trey could even make claymation exercise session using a man's unmentionables,  I support and watch whatever wild idea that come out of their demented, creators' flawed minds 100 percent, because I knew it would work to entertain me.  However, in the case of this marionette movie-making experience, this might've change my mind.  This movie didn't entertain me, because it doesn't work.

What IS Team America?  It's a ""Thunderbirds"" rip-off group of young American normies with distinct abilities that goes off against terrorists around the world, while ""accidentally"" wrecking havoc from the countries by their own actions.  There's Joe, the arrogant action dude with a distaste for actors; Sarah, the  second-only-to-hottest chick with whimsical psychic powers; Chris, the quarterback gun'n jackass; and Lisa, the blonde beauty  on gathering information.  After losing a fellow member in the last battle, the boss of TM recruited an up-and-coming Broadway actor, Gary, to join for the cause.  After much hesitation (and glaring at Lisa more than once), the main character finally agrees to join, and goes on a team mission to find out what the terrorists are planning, and stop them for doing the Big Bang.  Add some hidden love-interests, potty mouths, and a North Korean Dictator as the main villain, this is made for big action storyline goodness...sort of.

The story is linear, but I believe that's was intentional by the creators, only the bring in more hysterical chuckles of cruelty (like Matt and Trey has always delivered with their work).  Believe me, this puppet film is more f'd up than that Chinese puppet cinema of gorefest about some warriors finding a sacred stone (Sorry, fanatics, I have not seen ""Meet the Feebles"").  The writing in ""Team America"" is so obscene and mature that it has its moment of irksome laughter and upsetting parents.  It's also quite clever, like in the one scene where some celebrities team up to form as an association to stop Team America by the name of ""Film Actors' Guild"" which can be an acronym as...well, I can't say it here, but it's quirky.

This is, by far, one of the best technical-looking puppet films I've seen.  From the well-made human designs to the scenery the movie's lo-cals are, I was impressive by how it looks and how it interacts with things with special effects (explosions, decapitations, etc.)  The beauty of its design, however, comes with a severe flaw to the work in which the creators produced.  Despite its sardonic ""no-strings-attached"" comedy, the puppets leave A LOT to be desired in the physical humor department.  The best they can do is wobbling around when a battling against enemies like a spastic dancer for CATS, puppet sex (yes, there is a puppet sex scene, and a long one, I say), and vomiting, which was the funniest part in one scene in the film when Gary was drunk and then he threw up...again...again...and AGAIN (Toilet humor, yes, but still effective funny stuff).  Other than those, it wasn't physically over-the-top or breaking new ground compare to Trey and Matt's best work.  And I liked some physical humor.

Like South Park: BL&U, ""Team America"" includes many musical numbers; the pinnacle would be the movie's theme, ""America!  **** yea'!""  But unlike that mentioned movie, the songs here aren't completely memorable and they are not going to make me go out and buy the soundtrack.  What bothers me more, comparing to the mentioned movie again, is that ""Team America"" is so weak to watch.  It's crazy and overkilling on the profanities, and I expected that (maybe too well).  Come on, Trey and Matt, give me something new to laugh at.  Even with the morals and hidden messages the movie subjects, it didn't affect me too much since I wasn't interested.

THE FINAL WORD: Boring.  I wanted to give it a good grade, I really do; this is from the creators of my favorite show, darn it!  But watching ""Team America"", to me, is like watching a wooden copy of Matt and Trey's greatest cinema.  I like the production value, but that's all I can say for positives.  Fans of dark puppetry, or a South park fan with curiosity, should try to catch it and enjoy it by its novel idea.  But for fans looking a different taste of gag from what they already saw, watching this dummy movie can make you look like the dummy.",1098230400,8,4989,4.890476190476191

2218842,5,B0007LPLMY,"Yeah, that's right i think that this movie has the potential to be the best movie that I have seen all year, and I see a lot of moives. This movie has terrific, but offensive humor, a story that you proboly won't find in any other R rated puppet movie, and hysterical and eye opening visuals. Yes, matt and trey tried to make the movie funny by showing the puppet strings, but I just think that it adds to the humor part of the movie. This movie is great, it has great music that i am sure Matt and Trey wrote and sang, and great lines in it, like there are three kinds of people.....(not appropriote). I would like that this movie should have recived an NC-17 rating, but then again i am glad it didn't becuase then I would not have been able to see it, due to me being only 15. All the people say it is not for people my age, but I went with my dad and we where just fine. I think this film has nothing to do with what age you are, it is how mature you are. If your going to go out and have sex with puppets and shot people because you saw this in the movie, you proboly shouldnt see it. It is rauncy and rude and they say the F word more than 100 times, but you get that at school, so why not pay 5 bucks and get a laugh along with it. In conclusion I love this film, I f you liked SOuth Park you will love it too, it is a movie to be enjoyed by everyone, just go into it knowing that it is all just for humor and not to be taken seriously. I seriously doubt Kim Jong sings songs about how he is lonley, and other stuff like that. It all is for fun.",1098144000,2,1552,3.853125

If anyone has watched any interviews they have did about this movie then you would know that they mention that not everyone should see this movie. Every one of there movies has cursing and some type of bizzare sexual humor. i have seen some reviews about how south park is better and i to think it is better but not because of the words and content. mainly cause i enjoy watching the cartoon kids more then watching puppets. yyou need to remember south park is on television and can only go to certian limits but when matt and trey go into the movie world they go all out.",1098144000,,842,4.369426751592357

  Before I wrote my review, I decieded to check out what other people thought and it was as shocking as the movie.  Review titles like ""Neocons will love this movie,"" and ""HATEFUL, NAZI-LIKE, PROPAGANDA FILM"" soar like giant flags of stupidity.  Just because this movie makes fun of Michael Moore, Alec Baldwin, and other actors who think their opinions matter, doesn't mean that its anti whatever those guys are.  I'll admit I'm not an expert on politics, but when did conservitives start supporting gratuitous violence, language, sex scenes, and America bashing?  The title of the movie makes fun of Americas' believe that the world is theirs, America gets its intelligence from a retarted computer, and in order to stop a terrorist from blowing up a city with a bomb, America blows it up with missiles. I don't know what's worse, the fact that people can watch two things and only see one of them, or that someone actually looks to puppets for political guidance.

I never had such a fun time being politically incorrect as I did watching `Team America'! I laughed until I cried, throughout the film. With one-liners that you'll quote everywhere you go & songs that are so funny...it will make you want to buy the soundtrack twice! You feel stupid walking into the theater to see this movie, but you'll walk out feeling like a patriot.

The DOWNSIDE: There are some jokes that drag on too long, like the puppet sex scene. But you can't expect a movie to be PERFECT...that's just stupid. Many jokes go into great details about 'the birds & the bees'. So don't bring any child into 'Team America', that doesnt know about sex. (Unless you feel like answering a LOT of questions after the movie.) This movie was made for teens, but written for adults. And sometimes vice versa. Before taking anyone under the age of 15 to this movie...remember this: it's R for a reason.

Supposedly everyone should be offended by this movie.  But aside from the overuse of the f-word, and the very odd sex scene, the only conservatives who will be offended by this movie will be the church ladies.  The skewering of Hollywood celebrities and their silly pacifist views will offend liberals; the more leftist, the mroe offended they will be.

I could only rate this 4 stars as I have little interest in watching it again.  I loved it the first time, but I have no desire to see it again, save for maybe adding the unedited DVD to my collection when it is released.

This is the most spot on action satire I have ever seen. There are also very catchy songs in this movie as well. I should tell you that this is not a movie you bring the whole family to, but once again if you watch ""South Park"" you should know that.

2218850,5,B0007LPLMY,"Well, I took all three of my kids to see both ""Team America"" and ""Shark's Tale"".

""Team America"" was the better movie by far!  The kids loved the movie!  Shark's Tale was dull and banal by comparison.

Team America is not getting a great box office so far, probably for the same reason that ""Office Space"" missed the mark when it first came out.  People like to see comedy movies with their families, and most people are just going to be really squeamish about taking kids to an ""R"" rated comedy, especially one with an openly advertised excess of gratuitous sex, bloodshed, and profanity, albeit with puppets.

Nevertheless, the movie is hilarious.

I came to the realization at the end of this movie that the producers of ""Team America"" didn't really bash both liberals and conservatives equally, as many critics' reviews have stated.  In fact, the movie, whether intentionally or not, could almost be a recruiting film for the neo-con philosophy (an earlier review here already picked up on this fact).

Remember, in our wacky two party system, single-issue groups are forced to join either one party or the other, or risk becoming irrelevant.  Just because the Republican Party generally encompasses both neo-cons and Christian conservatives doesn't mean that the two philosophies actually have anything to do with each other.  Stomping all over the sensibilities of one segment of the Republican Party (the Christian conservatives) doesn't mean that the neo-cons are also getting their just deserts.

Yes, in the process of fighting terrorism, Team America accidentally send a rocket exploding into the Eiffel Tower (which then falls over and crushes the Arc d'Triomphe), deliberately blow up the Louvre with another rocket (a terrorist ran in to hide), and later also manage to unintentionally demolish several of the most famous Egyptian landmarks - the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Sphinx, and the Great Temple of Ramses II at Abu Simbel.  All, but who cares, it's just some collateral damage; the good news is that the terrorists are wiped out!

A Michael Moore puppet appears as a suicide bomber working for the terrorists, and blows up Team America's headquarters at Mount Rushmore.  The movie ends in a blood fest, as puppet versions of every one of the major Hollywood liberals who spoke out against the war in Iraq get shot, eaten by cats, burned to a crisp, or cut in half.  All the while, the theme music ""America,... (...), YEAH!"" is blaring away.

I suppose you could say that on a higher intellectual level, all of this is just so over the top that it's really a terrific satire of the neo-con philosophy, but it sure is really, really hard to distinguish such high level satire from pure and simple fulfillment of the ultimate in neo-con fantasies.

Another reviewer mentioned that this was a pretty shallow movie.  Actually not, if you look, you can spot numerous takeoffs of various Hollywood movies and other entertainment moments.  There's the Cantina sequence from the first Star Wars movie (""A New Hope""), the opening Jedi Knight scene from ""Phantom Menace"", bits of the huge swordfight from ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"", the bug crawling out of the Kim Jong Il puppet from ""MIB"".  Not to mention an entire song devoted to trashing the movie ""Pearl Harbor"".  I'm sure there are more that I've missed.  Can you spot them?!!

There's plenty of making fun of gays too!  Gary, the actor puppet sings a song ""Everybody has AIDS"" during a Broadway play.  An Alec Baldwin puppet is in charge of F.A.G. (Film Actors' Guild - the real life version is the Screen Actor's Guild) and there is one sequence where he and his liberal Hollywood cohorts are chanting, ""F.A.G.'s can save the world!"" (or something like that).  There are those scenes where Spottswood makes Gary give him oral sex before he will let him come back to Team America, and then repeatedly announces this happening every chance he can get.

I won't mention the puppet sex and extended puppet vomit scenes, since they've already been mentioned extensively. Oh, yes, there were two extended treatments of explaining Global Politics and the Meaning of Life (...)  Come to think of it, it turned out to be a pretty dead-on summary of the neo-con philosophy.

Anyway, I don't generally have any problems with talking about issues of profanity and sex with my kids, nor do I have concerns about them being able to keep these issues under control.  I realize that's not true for everybody, so you should think about it before you take them.  I sure thought about it.  The more unfortunate aspect about this movie is that I actually had to explain to the kids afterwards that all this business of Kim Jong Il and nuclear weapons and terrorists wasn't just a joke, it was for real.  But at least now they know.",1097971200,6,4773,4.830258302583026
2218851,4,B0007LPLMY,"I watched TEAM AMERICA more out of curiousity than anything else.  I had heard that the movie made fun of everything from the war on terror to the Hollywood establishment. I had also heard about a puppet sex scene (which almost garnered the film a NC-17 rating) and that the film was full of foul language. I must say I was kind of surprised about how funny the movie actually is.

TEAM AMERICA is about a group of five warriors from different parts of the country joined together to fight the War on Terror. The movie opens in Paris, France as we see much of the carefree happiness that the city has to offer.  A young French boy skipping along while eating a chocolate popsicle bumps into a Middle Eastern-looking man carrying a briefcase with flashing lights. The man stares him down and the child runs to his mother and tells her what he sees. They turn to leave and moments later Team America bursts onto the scene.  Team America succeeds in killing the terrorists and capturing the WMDs, but they also knock down the Eiffel Tower and have one of their own killed.

Team America learns from I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E. (the group's super-duper computer) that terrorists are plotting a major world-wide attack 1,000 times the size of 9/11.  Their mentor, Spottswoode, knows they don't have a chance unless they can get an actor to join their team (that's right, an actor). So, he sets forth and finds the best actor in the world, Gary Johnston.  He brings Gary to the Team's hideout in Mt. Rushmore and tells him what's at stake. Gary joins the team, but upon learning after a successful mission that his involvement with the team possibly caused other people to be killed, Gary quits the Team and hits rock bottom (literally, after passing out in his own vomit).  With Gary's departure, the Team is left without an actor and they don't have a chance.  Michael Moore and all the members of F.A.G. (Film Actors' Guild) unknowingly assist the leader of the massive terrorist takeover, Kim Jong Il, as he prepares for world domination.  Only Gary Johnston can save the day, but only if he proves to Spottswoode that he is dedicated to the team.

I was suprised at how humorous TEAM AMERICA is.  I was a little offended by all the foul language and felt it was overdone, but like the unnecessary sex scene that might have been the whole point. TEAM AMERICA has two major targets in the movie:  the war on terror and the Hollywood establishment.  The humorous jabs at the War on Terror are evident from the movie's opening scene in Paris and don't let up until the very end of the film.  As the only superpower in the world and the leader of democracy, we have a duty to ""police"" the world persay. However, no matter who we help (because we can't help everybody) somebody else is going to hate us because we didn't help them or because we helped their enemy.  Sometimes we overstep our duty and are careless. This is parodied in the movie and in a hilarious way.

The second biggest target in the movie is the Hollywood establishment.  Hollywood is a powerful place and having been the center of the dream factory for almost a century, it's no wonder that many of the people who become stars think they are the kings and queens of the world.  As Bruce Campbell wrote about in CHINS THAT KILL, Hollywood is a land filled with spores. The spores cause people to not think logically and normally.  Even the most innocent and well-guarded can fall victim to the spores.  The spores destroy all that is good, right, and true. Anyway, it's amazing that people who dropped out of high school and just because they make a few movies, think they have the right to ""rule"" the world.  This mentality is parodied to perfection in TEAM AMERICA.  Alec Baldwin (who recently chastised his younger brother Stephen for becoming a Christian and Republican) is perhaps made fun of the most as the leader of F.A.G., but Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Michael Moore, Liv Tyler, Matt Damon, and a handful of others are also parodied.  All of the actors who actually make it into the film are people that have made political statements over the past several years, but really aren't that knowledgeable about anything.  Like the unnecessary foul language and sex scene, much of what Hollywood does is useless and pointless.

Anyway, this isn't a movie for kids. It isn't a political movie either, making fun of two extremes on both sides. However, it is interesting that there are more conservatives who seem to enjoy the film than liberals. If you're looking for something that's crude, but hilarious and is a little different, TEAM AMERICA is for you.",1097971200,4,4623,4.66256157635468

Didn't the Germans do something similar to a different group of people during World War 2? This is truly the most disgusting, violent, liberal-hating, (way beyond bashing), stupid movies I hope to ever see in my lifetime! It's certainly beyond satire or cathartic violence! What's so amusing about a bunch of American fools blowing up some of the world's most important cultural landmarks, or showing scenes of torture in prison?

The gruesome violence at the end of this movie, where every liberal actor and actress in Hollywood is brutally killed, with guts flying every which way, makes it extremely inappropriate for children, or anyone who is not sadistic! I'm a middle-aged adult, and I had to look away from the screen!

Forget about the sex scene, its less than 30-seconds, and certainly not worth the price of admission. Nor has it anything to do with the story line! It's just a ploy for the curious to shell out their hard earned money to purchase a movie ticket.

2218857,4,B0007LPLMY,"I'm a fan of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. I really liked South Park The Movie and BaseketBall but think this film was just not as funny as the reviews here seemed to me to indicate it would be.

The story is a political satire similar to what you might find with South Park TV shows. Team America is a special operations unit that goes around the world fighting evil in general and terrorists in particular. Stringed puppets act the entire film. Marionettes. You know, like Pinocchio. Like I said, this movie is a political satire and I'm thinking Stone and Parker chose puppets over cartoon characters for a reason.

If you follow Talk Radio (like Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity) you'll be better able to understand what this film is talking about. If you only get your viewpoints from TV ""news"" shows then you might miss some of the references or be left wondering why certain groups/people are portrayed as they are (like politically outspoken Hollywood actors of the Film Actors Guild - F.A.G.). By the way, if you're a Communist/Socialist/Liberal you probably aren't going to like how the Left is exposed in this film. On the other hand if you're a Communist/Socialist/Liberal you probably aren't going to go see a movie called Team America. This is not Fahrenheit 9/11.

Pros:

No Token Black Actors. (I get tired of seeing Blacks thrown into a film just to placate racist special interest groups. Kudos to these guys for not knuckling under to Political Correctness.)

Great Puppet Animation. The sets are detailed and the action is smooth.

Good Story and Moral (as usual with these guys). If you watch alot of South Park you know what I mean.

Some Good Chuckles. There was even applause in the theater at some points during the film.

Cons:

None really except that it wasn't ""as funny"" as South Park or BaseketBall were to me.

Here's how I'd rate it:

No token Blacks: 5 Stars

Puppet animation: 5 Stars

Story/Moral: 4 Stars

Laughs: 3 Stars

If you like South Park then you'll like this too. But I'd see it more for it's refreshingly pro-America point of view (rare in a Hollywood film these days) then for the laughs.",1097971200,14,2130,4.672922252010724
2218858,5,B0007LPLMY,"Wow, This is a hilarious movie, probably one of the funniest
American movies I have ever seen. Bringing in the use of puppets as used by other series like ""The Thunderbirds"" , Matt Stone
and Trey Parker have hit gold with this movie. Wow where do I start.

Originally Trey Park and Matt Stone were set to direct a spoof
of ""The Day After Tommorow"" but that plan was soon removed.

They then decided to make ""Team America World Police"" released
by Paramount.

This is a movie that is undergoing such buzz in Hollywood and has gotten worldwide attention among movie fans, clearly this is a movie that is unique.

Matt Stone and Trey Parker have done what other directors have failed to do in the last few years, used a funny movie to create great satire centering on todays corrupt politics, and worldview ,not to mention our  over emphasis fear on ""Terrorism"" and American ideals.

The movie main plot is that a group of Americans are part of a secret police that well polices the world under the name ""Team America"" lol Well they hunt down terrorist like Osama Bin
Laden and others while acting as diplomatically incorrect as possible.

The scene which spoofs Hans Blitzer a weapons inspector against Korean Dictaor Mr. Cho is hilarious. While Matt and Trey obviously are not trying to make a political movie,
they obviously gives us their interpretation of what not only goes on in the mind of a terrorist, but the corrupt and often  nonexistent plans that the US has in getting these terrorist.

Speaking of which the first frame of the movie is pure comedy as the Team America within a span of five minutes are able to track down Osama Bin Laden, something the poor and disorganized Administration of George Bush and the military has failed to do since September 11

Of course theirs spoofs of movies like the Matrix with the Team America often battling with hilarous, over the top martial arts kicks and punches, but its all done with such lack of precision that you cant help but die laughing at the screen.

The movie while undergoing tremendous success at the box office and praise from fans, has gotten many cheapshots from many so called professional critics who are anything but professional.

Roger Ebert said the movie was nihilistic , lame and that Trey and  Matt'ss attempt was to make fun of ""anyone who cares about the war"" like Sean Penn.

Yet Ebert doesnt mention that spoiled celebrities like Sean Penn and Alec  Baldwin  who say they ""care"" about the war have an agenda and are using the war to clean their image.

Richard Roper on the other hand, gave a great review, calling it a  great piece of satire and that he enjoyed the jokes.

However, Trey and Matt also give a nice ode to the troops
in America by the song delivered ""Freedom isn't Free"".
Freedom is not free many Americans died for our Freedom
and we should never forget that, if it wasn't for the sacrifices
of others, we wouldn't have the world we have today.

Overall though , ""Team America World Police"" from the creators of South Park is absolutely  funny that has to be seen over and over again.

I can see a couple of months down the line that DVD release of this movie like Fahrenheit 911 is sure to be a huge hit, so see this funny movie now.",1097971200,7,3233,4.547495682210708

The first few moments of the movie seemed promising, but after the first fourth of the movie, things went downhill, relying on recycled crude jokes.  I expected the humor to be potty-level, but it never elevated above that.  Nor was their depth to the humor, as there is in the Simpsons or The Family Guy.  In fact, this movie is worth flushing down the toilet.

Good aspects of the movie: The set was creative, and it was an interesting and ambitious idea to use puppets instead of real actors or animation.

I also recommend along with another comment-er that if you still desire to view this movie, that you rent the movie and not pay to see it at a theatre--and split the cost of the rental with friends, because otherwise you may still regret that you paid too much!",1097884800,8,1004,4.575418994413408
2218861,3,B0007LPLMY,"As a staunch liberal, I was a little nervous about going to see ""Team America"" when I heard from some critics that it had a right-wing bias (that shocked me when I first heard it, considering the title of the movie).  However, since I loved ""South Park"", I decided to try and watch the movie with an open mind and, most importantly, try not to take anything seriously.  What I saw was an original, marginally offensive, and occasionally amusing comedy that was unfortunately well below the level of the ""South Park"" movie.

""Team America""'s best laughs come in the first couple minutes, when we see the puppets in action for the first time.  The Middle Eastern stereotypes are hilarious, as is the ""patriotic"" background music as Team America battles the terrorists.  In fact, the songs throughout the film are good.  There's an absolutely hilarious puppet sex scene, and the Kim Jong puppet is consistently funny (he resembles Cartman).  Most surprisingly, ""Team America"" works somewhat as a straight-ahead action picture, since it never takes itself seriously and has plenty of puppet-filled action.

However, I had qualms with the movie, and mostly with its satire.  The first time the movie made fun of the liberal Hollywood activists, it was funny, but to my disappointment this became a major plot point (by the end, the Hollywood liberals are basically in league with the terrorists).  I consider myself a good sport- I chuckled when puppet Michael Moore decided to suicide-bomb the Team America center- but the idea of Hollywood liberals actively working against the country is a joke that wears thin fast (exempting puppet Matt Damon, who is consistently funny).  Also, the film really bogs down in its final half hour; by that point, the novelty of the puppets had worn off, and more jokes were falling flat (although there is a funny speech at the end).

I myself had mixed feelings about ""Team America"".  It's funny, but not nearly enough.  I'm not sure what the audience for the film could be.  Conservatives will find it too raunchy, liberals will be downright offended, comedy fans may not find it funny enough, and action fans won't like how little it takes itself seriously.  I guess I could recommend it to curious ""South Park"" fans, but I think overall ""Team America"" is more deservant of a rental than a movie ticket price.",1097884800,6,2343,4.878787878787879
2218862,5,B0007LPLMY,the funniest movie this year.  if you don't like it you are a political nut from either side.  I have heard complaints that this movie doesnt go after bush or the white house and nails the actors.  there are already 100000000 movies bashing bush and no one says anything about these retarded actors.  I happen to be liberal and I think this movie is hilarious.  this movie is better then citizen kane and has a more poinent message then schindler's list.,1097884800,7,454,4.555555555555555

2218864,5,B0007LPLMY,"I was skeptical when I went to see this movie, but after seeing it I couldn't stop laughing.  Trey Parker delivers in this comedic masterpiece.  Kim chong il  is the most hilarious character in any movie I've ever seen, and the puppet sex scene is enough to make any movie a classic.  Please go see this movie and support the creators so they can make more hilarious works of cinema",1097884800,5,382,4.414285714285715
2218865,4,B0007LPLMY,"Any film that has the White House publicly denouncing it has to be big, doesn't it? Leave it up to Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the consistently irrelevant South Park series on Comedy Central, to set off not only the radical politically-oriented activists of Hollywood, specifically Sean Penn who wrote an op-ed basically saying ""f--- you"" the film's creators, but the current administration at well. Though one has to agree with the White House's statement that the current war on terrorism is far from what one would call a comical matter, perhaps they were more irked about the look-alike of Bush in the film's poster. Whether they like to admit or not, many view President Bush this way, whether it be his supporter or detractors, and with Election Day less then three weeks away, perhaps its best if we all take some time off, relax, and divert our minds away from the current political climate if only for two hours.

The story for Team America: World Police is a comical take on the current war on terrorism and how both sides of the political spectrum have viewed it since September 11th. Team America, the governing police force of the planet dedicated to bringing terrorists to justice any which way possible, learns, thanks to their computer network known as I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E., that a group of Middle-Eastern terrorists, under the control of communist dictator Kim Jong Il unbeknownst to the crime force, has gotten their hands on weapons of mass destruction, which they plan to use to bring chaos to the world. In order to stop them before they enact their devilish plan, Team America recruits a rising Broadway actor Gary Johnson, quite possibly the best in the business (with the exception of his hero, Alec Baldwin), to disguise himself as a Middle-Eastern terrorist and infiltrate the secret organization to unlock their plans. It's a race against time to stop the power hungry Kim Jong Il and bring an end to his fiendish plot before every country on the planet is brought into what he calls ""the perfect balance"". The story for Team America: World Police fails to exist, or at least longer then first thirty minutes of the feature, but, as was case with South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, the audience its intended for doesn't care that much as long as the film makes them laugh, which its sure to do, in one sick twisted way or another. Though Trey Parker and Matt Stone do take their jabs at the ""arrogant"" jerks of the world's police force, their true black vendetta seems to be squarely with the radical liberal activists in Hollywood. If you hate any one of these hippies, or you just enjoy seeing puppets blown up, this is definitely a must-see film, for the last twenty minutes at least. Here's one question to ponder though: What the Hell did Matt Damon do to piss these guys off? Michael Moore is understandable (besides being a socialist whiner, he apparently placed a cartoon in Bowling for Columbine that was made to look like it was done by the South Park guys, which it wasn't) but Matt Damon? How about them apples?!

Another conventional concept Team America lacks is a generalized cast make-up - there may be a specific cast list on IMDB but considering it's a lengthy roster of individuals who few, if any in the general populous, know anything about, it isn't worth wasting ink over. But ditching cinematic canon isn't a new development for the South Park creators, so it isn't surprising for them to make their project work in spite of that clear fact. Gary Johnston, one of the best actors in the world, one who hides a dark secret he has kept since childhood, is the landmark hero of Team America and lampoons the basic ""Ben Affleck-esque"" heroes presented in the Bruckheimer extravaganzas such as Pearl Harbor (a film so bad the film dedicates a song to it) and Armageddon. There was one particular scene, more actually but in an effort to not give away too much we'll narrow it down to one, will have many people wrenching. At the beginning of the movie, Gary is discovered by the head of Team America in a Broadway stage show known as ""Lease"". ""Lease"", a take on the Broadway musical ""Rent"", features the song ""Everybody has AIDs"", and while it was intended as off the cuff humoristic take on the homosexuality of Broadway actors, it bordered on the line of  complete insensitivity and wasn't necessary. Sarah, whose finance is killed by a Middle-Eastern terrorist while on a mission in Paris, France, is the foxy team member that falls head over strings for Gary, though she desperately tries to fight it early on. The scene that will be talked about the most, whether it be at the water cooler or the high school lunch room, is the one that was under the most scrutiny when it was presented to the MPAA for the film's rating decision. There's no simple way to describe it other then to say it will either have you rolling on the floor laughing or racked with disgust. Just be forewarned, if you don't enjoy seeing puppets, or the more politically correct term would be the mechanically impaired, bang each other every which way for what seems like the longest twenty seconds in cinematic history, once you hear the words ""I promise you I will never die"" come from Gary's mouth, better cover your eyes quickly before being scarred for life. Chris, a no nonsense martial-arts expert, gives Team America the seriously needed attitude adjustment it deserves (""Let's make this interesting ... You lose!"") and kicks major marionette butt in the process. Kim Jong Il, the vicious North Korean communist dictator, works extremely well when he's on screen, almost all of his scenes are gut-busters (both literally and figuratively), but he does have his fair share of problems. Specifically, the main problem is that he doesn't get as nearly enough screen time as he should. He's quite possibly the funniest character in the entire film, possibly because he sounds so much like Cartman from the South Park series, but only makes appearances sporadically throughout the feature. Granted this film is suppose to be about the heroes of Team America but with a villain as incomprehensible as Kim Jong Il, why not focus on him more? One can only hope more will appear in the unrated edition of the film's DVD release six months from now.

Overall, Team America won't persuade anyone to vote for a particular candidate this November, which, if you're from a swing state, you're pretty much sick of both by now, but whether you're a ""right-wing nut job"" or a liberal ""wiener"", you'll find something to laugh at in this film, one side more then other. On the last episode of 60 Minutes, you know - the program that faked the Bush National Guard memos, Andy Rooney, for what seems like the first time in years, actually made sense when he stated that those who haven't decided who they are going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election by now are idiots. Though that may seem harsh, in essence, he's right and an impertinent comedy such as Team America: World Police should have no profound effect on anybody's political affiliation. As Trey Parker and Matt Stone themselves said upon releasing this film, if anyone comes out of this film, or a Michael Moore documentary, basing their political decisions on what they have just seen, they shouldn't be voting. This film is for pure entertainment purposes only and should not be taken seriously by anyone with a brain, let alone some decent common sense. Let's be frank - Team America: World Police is in no way shape or form a feature that should ever be viewed by children under the age of fifteen even with the consent of parents. There's enough foul language, vomit, excessive violence, and puppet sex to make the most immature high school flunky blush. The film, as irrelevantly hilarious as it may be at times, has its share of problems that make it far from being one of the best films of the year, let alone one of the top-rated comedies of the season. Team America seems to be betting too much on a one-trick pony - whether it be blowing everything up in site with as many big explosions as possible or doing stupid things, such as martial-art fighting, involving marionettes. What seems humorous at first eventually becomes amusing then cute ultimately falling into the area of just flat-out annoying and this is only after about forty minutes. Though it does work out in the end, this film should never have made into theaters and would have been bettered suited to a special presentation on either Comedy Central or HBO, and perhaps cut down by about thirty minutes. The parody of modern musicals may have worked brilliantly for South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut but it doesn't here almost at all. Though some of the songs are worth a few chuckles here and there, namely Kim Jong Il's ""I'm so Lonely"" (the online R-rated clip version was way better), they don't do anything for the film and really drag the film down. Bottom-line, if enjoy seeing mind-less peace-harping losers such as Michael Moore, Martin Sheen, Tim Robbins, Danny Glover, Helen Hunt, Matt Damon (""Matt Damon!""), and others getting smashed, bashed, and blown-up in anyway possible then this is the worth the price of at least matinee performance alone. With only three more weeks until four more years, take some time off from back-breaking political labor to relieve pressure from those infuriating fanatic left-wing activists.",1097884800,2,9425,4.787469287469287
2218866,5,B0007LPLMY,"if there is one word to describe this movie  - that will be ""amazing"". I mean amazing in every aspect - creation of canvas, puppetry, music (especially this one), photography and screen play. This is a riot of imagination - using puppets is not a new concept but the level of details that has gone into the sets is startling. The biggest consideration has been the attitude of the puppets they are so close to original population that is mind blowing. The theme song "" America Fu...k Ya"" is so appropriate.

This a story of a special American forces called Team America fighting terrorists and the spread of now infamous WMD. Their ideas are novel but sometimes the methods are little crude and insensitive. KIM Chong-il is the primary villain and his charater is more than just hilarious - he is really a rebel without a cause -  a lonely fellow with nothing better to do. You will laugh laugh & laugh.  It also portrays the Hollywood stars and Michael Moore in a different light. The great thing about the movie is that it is not biased from the right or left and has been able to follow a middle ground.

Just one of the point  - I believe sometimes there is too much unnecessary slang which could have been replaced with more wit other than that nothing to complain about.",1097884800,5,1276,4.5021645021645025

2218871,5,B0007LPLMY,"First of all, this is completely inappropriate for children, teenagers, grandparents, or anyone who is offendable.

Many people who have tried to watch South Park can't get past the language, vulgarity, and political incorrectness.  But those who can recognize that Trey Parker and Matt Stone are masters of the art of satire -- politics, culture, and cinema.  This film will be regarded by South Park fans as their best work to date, and by SP critics as their worst.

I thought the story worked best as a puppet show rather than live-action or computer-animation.  Every time the story would get cliched or too serious, the puppet action (sometimes done badly on purpose) would bring the house down.  They build up to the first street fight in Paris, and the puppet fighting looks like two guys doing the lambada.  The much-hyped sex scene resembled a Ken and Barbie porno.  They introduced panthers in a North Korean palace scene, which were played by ordinary housecats who tore up two of the ""Hollywood Left"" puppets.

As with most episodes of South Park, they ridicule both Left and Right, with the Left catching sharper elbows.  The Hollywood Left is represented by the ""Film Actors Guild,"" and the soundbites from the actors feature their names and the guild's acronym on the chyron bar across the bottom of the screen.  Michael Moore is a slob turned suicide bomber, while Alec Baldwin and the other actors are tools of the terrorists.  The overall point of the satire: America and the political Right need to be less arrogant and ham-handed in dealing with the rest of the world, while the anti-war crowd and political Left need to defend America's greatness and not give aid and comfort to those who seek to destroy it.

This is one of those movies that if you like it the first time, you'll want to see it three or four more times and then purchase the DVD.

Hehheh, hehheh. Now that's just really funny calling someone a fag. NOT. Well maybe if you're a teenage, homophobic boy.

It is interesting to note that the only real people in the film are Michael Moore, Hans Blix, North Korea's Kim-Jung-Il and a host of progressive actors protesting the US war in Iraq. Seems that many in need of roasting were left out of the film: O'Reilly, authors of Patriot Act, proclaimers of the Christian right, etc. Perhaps what is really scary is that the film censored out any real right-wingnuts because they were scared or Parker and company have become O'Reilly ""undecided"" ditto heads. It's truly a film worthy of Fox-downed TV.

And, saying that something is funny because it is satire, does not make it so. Lampooning progressive actors who are speaking out against a current war was simply a humorless cheap-shot. But perhaps that's the point, the whole thing is meaningless. This movie is a sell-out to the almighty buck, not satire but nihilism at its finest.
