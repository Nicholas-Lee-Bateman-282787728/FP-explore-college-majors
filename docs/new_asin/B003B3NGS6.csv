4104962,5,B003B3NGS6,"I work at Silver Hill Hospital and Joey was kind enough to loan us a copy to preview last fall. The individuals featured in the movie share their moving stories with strength, humor and incredible insight. Joey has created a wonderful film that helps people realize it's not only ok, but also healthy, to talk about mental dis-ease.

4104964,4,B003B3NGS6,"As a sufferer myself, I thought it was done very well. It had many sad and many happy moments.  It was very real and honest. I would like to have others I know to view it. I guess every persons symptoms of clinical depression are different but I was surprised by the way it manifested itself in Joey. It might have been helpful to know besides therapy how he and the others are treated.  I mean what medications possibly.  But overall I was so glad it was made.

4104983,4,B003B3NGS6,"As a caretaker of an untreated bipolar spouse that refuses treatment - it helps others understand. I do wish there was a bit more about modern treatments and medications and the importance of constant therapy. For those of us without the resources of a famous actor, the collateral damage is life threatening. Amazon loves me during the manic episodes because i have to order 4 more phone chargers every other day as they go missing, along with all the books about mental illness - so i end up renting kindle versions or viewing Amazon videos. Computer and camera batteries disappear, as well as SD cards... to say nothing of the relationships and friends and effect on our business. Such a beautiful woman, such a brilliant creative mind, but this disease destroys all her accomplishments every 2 years - i will seek out and share every possible resource.

4104989,4,B003B3NGS6,Interesting documentary that gives a good overview on mental illness and the stigma attached to it in our society. More people need to see this so that the ignorance about mental illness in this country will start to fade away.

This film gave us wonderful insights into the many facets of mental health disorders and how we tend to hide them and pretend they don't exist.  We are trying to set up a screening in our community.  Mr. Pantoliano's own journey, his self realizations, regardless of how painful, embarrassing or destructive opened the eyes of everyone I have shown the film to.  Mental illness crosses all boundaries and borders.  It affects everyone, either directly or indirectly and I applaud Mr. Pantoliano's courage to take his story public and to allow others to do the same.  We hear bits and pieces of these realities, but this is the first time I was able to begin to comprehend the horrors of different types of mental health disorders.

4104999,5,B003B3NGS6,"I just received this earlier today and I must say it is one of the best documentaries on mental illness that I ever viewed. It is very engaging and thought provoking without becoming overly verbose or technical. The people involved are very easy to relate to and the fact that they vary in age and backgrounds is a big plus as well.  It has the feel of a ""good talk amongst friends"". Well done, Mr. Pantoliano!",1370304000,2,410,4.394736842105263

4105002,4,B003B3NGS6,I would recommend this movie! It is very insightful. The families are able to speak truthfully to their family members with mental illness!

4105003,4,B003B3NGS6,I purchased this documentary as material for 2  Social Work classes which I teach at a local university. It is a great contemporary approach to to mental illness. The students were able to relate to some of the participants at a much better level than to dry discussion in a textbook. I plan to use it again next semester.,1356307200,,322,4.4576271186440675

4105005,1,B003B3NGS6,"I am a professor of psychology and wanted to use this video for class.  The case studies are real and the people honest and articulate.  However, the video is edited in a way that is really disappointing.  There is no time to really stay with anyone person in a conversation.  It is as if the editor thinks we are all afficted with ADHD!  Even reality shows are slower! Not worth it for class.  Maybe for your personal video library.",1337385600,8,433,4.417721518987341
4105006,5,B003B3NGS6,Joe describes his own struggle with depression and its relation to his acting career. He tries to break down the stigma by emphasizing that depression is a brain disease and interviewing different people. A worthy watch.,1336435200,,220,5.138888888888889
4105007,5,B003B3NGS6,Showed to my teen group for kids with mental illness and they loved it! Great dialogue after we watched this so I am pleased with it and will continue to use with future groups and teens struggling to deal with their diagnosis.,1335916800,3,227,4.428571428571429

4105009,4,B003B3NGS6,"This documentary was an insightful journey into the minds of individuals living with mental illness.  Watching each story reminds you that ""brain dis-ease"" can affect anyone, at any age, at any time.  Joey is helping to bring a face to mental illness and giving people an outlet in which to share their struggles with brain dis-ease.  Keep up the good work, Joey.  You are helping to eliminate the stigma that people with mental illness experience which is instrumental in helping people come out of the shadows to get the help they need.",1330128000,,538,4.815217391304348
4105010,5,B003B3NGS6,"This is such an important documentary, helping people understand mental-dis-ease. Joe Pantoliano is so brave to share his story, as is everyone else with their stories.
I would love to see High Schools showing this moving documentary to their students, helping kids that may have mental-dis-ease not feel so alone and for students that don't, help them have compassion and an understanding of their pain.
It's so easy to be kind and do the right thing, reach out, make someone smile.
Joey Pants, your documentary is a GIFT! Bravo.",1327449600,2,530,4.966292134831461
4105011,5,B003B3NGS6,"I purchased this doc on the DVD format.  It is an amazing, sometimes heartbreaking, always life affirming work.  Rather than talking heads, it is a conversation.  It's the sharing of a story.  It's a response of ""no kidding me too. That's my story too."".

I will be buying this again on download.  I encourage everyone to buy this documentary.  I gave my dvd copy to my therapist to share with all his other patients and coworkers.  Because they need to hear these stories.

""it's about progress, not perfection."" read one of the lines.  And yes mental disease most certainly is about the slow painful progress of getting better, of fighting the good fight, of trying to be healthy, and doing the best you can everytime you can.

You see, I am a diagnosed bipolar and in treatment. So this is my story, my struggle, ultimately my success. No kidding, me too!",1326672000,2,858,4.6158940397351

Please get this movie- it just might save a life.",1321488000,8,357,4.144927536231884
4105013,5,B003B3NGS6,"Recently I set out online to promote my story about the stigma of mental illness... I came across ""Joey Pants"" facebook group NKM2, then found this movie online. I was blown away by Joe's and all the people involved candor and openness. I love Joe as an actor, which makes it even better to see someone I respect and can identify with, out there too. As I put myself and my illness out there, I now know I'm not alone thanks to this movie and every one's efforts... I know how hard it is to make a film like this and I applaud everyone involved!

4105014,5,B003B3NGS6,"No Kidding! Me 2!! is a documentary done by Joe Pantoliano (Ralphie from The Sopranos) on mental illness and the stigma that surrounds it. Joe brings together five other people with mental illness (he himself has clinical depression) to talk about their illnesses and experiences they've had such as dealing with any stigma. Not only that, but the families and friends of the individuals are also involved with discussing their POV of their loved ones mental illness. In addition, several doctors and mental health officials (such as a psychiatry professor) are also talked to and interviewed throughout the documentary. One of the best things is that it's explained at the end in a ""Where are they now"" kind of thing about how life has gone for the participants. Thankfully, most of it is good news to one degree or another.

The main mental illnesses the documentary focuses on are clinical depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, ADHD, Bipoar, and paranoid schizophrenia.

One such person, Casey, mentions at point how she went to get stitches after a case of self-harm. The doctor found out it was self-inflicted, stitched her up without anesthesia and without saying another word to her. Another discusses his suicide attempt by jumping from his ninth floor window. It's a very frank and opened discussion on the pain people with mental illness suffer through, all too many times alone for far too many people.

The people involved are very frank and honest about their illnesses and experiences. Which is great because this was one of Joe Pantoliano's goals and reasons for doing the documentary. He wants to get honest talk and the truth out there on what it's like living with mental illness. The only way to fight the stigma that surrounds mental illness from those who are on ""the outside looking in"".

Sprinkled throughout the movie also are a few statistics on mental illness such as 1 in 4 Americans suffer from at least one disorder.

One thing I wish they would have done would have a little more variety in what the people had.  I guess what I'm saying is that I just would have liked seeing more lesser known and/or just as stigmatized mental illnesses represented. Say, Borderline Personality Disorder or Social Anxiety Disorder. You know, just ones that are far less ""accepted"" (for lack of a better word) and well known. Or maybe, the ones you never really hear much about but can (and often are) just as debilitating.

It's a well done documentary and not just because it's a topic near and dear to my heart. Perhaps you're a person looking to check out some documentaries because you'd like to check out the genre or maybe you're just simply looking for a new one to watch. Or maybe, you fit one of the two above and you want to get a glimpse into what mental illness is REALLY like for those with one or more or their family and friends or perhaps you want to know you aren't alone.

Whatever you're reasons might be, No Kidding, Me 2!! is a good choice to pick up. I would suggest it to anyone who is looking for a good documentary to watch.",1305936000,6,3069,4.723364485981309
4105015,5,B003B3NGS6,"Love ya, Joey! and by the way, No kidding, me too!!
""No Kidding! Me 2!"" is a very good documentary, that gives us people with a ""Mental Illnes"" diagnosis a look at others who, through no fault of their own have also found themselves in similar circumstances.
Many of us, like Joe, have come to our diagnosis later in our lives, but have suffered for years without really knowing why...if we can really figure out why.
I am currently getting ready to graduate from my local day rehab program, am finishing up my internship for my certification to become a Peer Support Specialist and hope to take my state boards in August.
I hope that Joe and NKM2 can produce more outstanding material to show that we are all just people with a disease that needs to be addressed as what it is a disease that we certainly didn't ask for and certainly don't want to be stigmatized for.
Dorothy Hamill was a guest speaker here, and she told us that when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, that there wasn't enough that people could/would do for her. But when she was diagnosed with Major Depression, there was like no communication at all.

4105016,5,B003B3NGS6,"This is a great doc.  It informs, but does not preach.  It reveals, but does not accost.  It entertains!
It handles a delicate subject with maturity, poise and honesty and succeeds at bringing an in-depth awareness without being heavy-handed.  Praise for Joey Pants for his courage and honesty and commitment.
This is a great documentary to own and share not only for those who are familiar with mental illness but also for everyone - it helps inform the whole insurance/medical debate in a purposeful and progressive way and offers comfort and understanding to those facing the challenges of dis-ease.",1300752000,5,602,5.05050505050505

He himself suffers from bipolar disorder....and there is so much sadness in the fact that he was unable to come ""out of the closet"" and share his experiences for a long time...like so many others with MH problems.  It impacted on his family and his work, and his whole life in general.

There is no shame in having a mental illness and I would recommend this to anyone with an issue or anyone who KNOWS someone who needs help!! It's out there!!",1292889600,6,668,4.6923076923076925
4105018,5,B003B3NGS6,Joey attempts to stomp the stigma of brain disease with this engaging and often humorous documentary. The movie introduces the viewer to several different people who have struggled with mental illness and who are managing their illnesses.,1288828800,5,238,5.45945945945946
4105019,5,B003B3NGS6,"This documentary is powerful, well done, and a must have. Get it now. Share it with others.

This documentary does on a large scale what I've been trying to do all my life in my one man crusade. Growing up being diagnosed ""hyper kinetic"", and later ADHD,  I also went through bouts of severe depression. I went from being drugged-down to be more ""normal"", to being sidelined in just about every way. I've never felt diseased, or ill. I've always felt different, but I always knew I was smarter than most of my classmates. I did my homework and have been trying to tell people that people like me also come with many gifts -- and I believe the gifts to be more numerous than the detriments. Until coming across Joey's amazing organization and work, I kinda always thought I was on my own in that regard.

There can be no more important topic to address, and Joey has made this his life passion. Stomping the stigma, and making brain dis-ease cool to talk about is crucial to allowing the vast majority of the population able to be real with themselves and everyone else. Joey is addressing something that everyone else was afraid to touch, most people try to hide, and everyone wants to be open about, and he does it masterfully.

Everyone has, or knows someone who has been touched by a form of 'mental illness'.  The film, and Pantoliano go to great lengths to remove the stigma associated with these kinds of troubles.  The message of the film is even more important as thousands of injured veterans from the Irag and Afghanistan wars begin to come home.  Many of these vets need our help and compassion.  It is critical for the physical and moral strength of our nation that wew help them, and anyone else who has been labeled as 'damaged goods due to mental illness'.  Buy the DVD and pass it on!  Great job Joey Pants!",1283731200,9,707,4.563492063492063

8393394,5,B003B3NGS6,"I suffer from depression at times. If you've never had or lived with chronic depression, you have no idea what our lives are like. Joe writes, in a comical way, his impression from having a mental disorder himself-what it is like. The need to be able to talk about it,  without being labeled ""crazy"". He encourages ANYONE who has any type of mental disorder to get medical advice. He also points out that, we all would be surprised to know there are many people who have the same problems that you and I  do! Many, many more than one would think.....thus the title of the book. It is a good read. I highly recommend it.",1484006400,,619,4.373913043478261

8393396,3,B003B3NGS6,"A great film about the stigma of mental illness and the need for society to treat the mentally ill with respect. The content of the film was very good and made some significant points about how society, the medical community and the insurance companies treat the mentally ill compared to those with other medical conditions. The editing of this film was choppy, which was surprising since the film was written and directed by actor Joe Pantoliano, and was distracting to the content. However, anyone working in mental health or the medical community should view this film to get a better understanding of the impact the negative stigma has on those inflicted and how it prevents many from seeking treatment.",1477353600,,707,4.949579831932773
