8501794,5,B006OBC5D4,Great video.  Mr. Austin is obviously a talented smith (and he has a striker).  I have watched this several times.  If you have never tried to forge an axe this is a great place to start learning.,1458864000,,196,4.243243243243243

8501796,5,B006OBC5D4,Seriously I can't put into words how excited I am to make one of these axes! And this DVD lays it out step by step.,1404432000,,115,3.64
8501797,5,B006OBC5D4,"Clear and concise instructions, fantastic job of recording hard-to-shoot material. The section on forge welding the eye was impressive. Looking forward to seeing more videos from this author.",1360108800,,191,5.857142857142857
8501798,5,B006OBC5D4,"Mr. Austin put a lot of care into this video. The process is clearly demonstrated and explained. The axe being worked on is frequently put next to a finished example to help explain what is being done. Measurements and tool sizes are frequently given.  Austin' s axe design is based on a study of historical axes rather than just made up, and it is beautiful. He has a striker to help him throughout the video and this project looks like it would be difficult to do alone, so spouses and friends of blacksmiths get ready to pick up a hammer if your blacksmith watches this interesting and inspirational video!",1356912000,2,609,4.587155963302752
