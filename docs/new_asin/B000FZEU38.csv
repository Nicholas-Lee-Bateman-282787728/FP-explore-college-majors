2593747,3,B000FZEU38,"OK, Basically the movie was entertaining but it was more like a movie of the week on TV. The acting was pretty weak. And there was an undertone of a gay theme. Unfortunaetly it didn't to be there. It had no impact in the movie at all.",1185494400,,234,4.0
2593748,4,B000FZEU38,I really liked this movie. I'm very glad I purchased it. I have watched most of the movies dealing with asteroids and I feel this movie was equal to the best of them. And it was nice to see gay heroes in a movie that was not a gay movie. They just happened to be gay. Very cool!,1183593600,4,278,3.810344827586207
2593749,5,B000FZEU38,"I really liked this movie because of the gay theme and positive story. There are many ""mainstream"" movies out there with gay characters that are not positive at all. This story shows the gay men in a positive way and doing something with purpose. What it also shows is how the military discharges men and women, and in this case men who are gay because they are gay. The main character was sick of ""living a lie"" within the military and came out. It was then that they discharged him. You can be hetrosexual and advertise it to everyone, but let someone say that they are gay and they are discharged from the military. Granted this is a B thriller movie, but in my book it is A+. I recommend everyone seeing this movie. If for nothing else, to see a gay positive movie that does have a happy ending.",1178668800,10,799,4.333333333333333
2593750,2,B000FZEU38,"Made for the gay Here! cable network, the opening scenes of Deadly Skies show the principal characters in a gay relationship that is then not referenced again as the drama unfolds.  Other countries (Canada, UK) have a shorter film without the gay scenes.  Like Dante's Cove on the same network, the gay scenes are, I guess, suppose to excuse the limited scope of the plot and the acting.  Unfortunately they don't.",1171756800,5,414,4.802816901408451
2593751,3,B000FZEU38,"Well, I liked the story idea. Two meteors are heading towards Earth and one, the sneaky one hiding behind the first, is on a collision course with our Planet! Will anyone listen? No, of course not. Except one scientist who resigned from the military, coming out as a gay man in the process. Yes, there still isn't any place for a gay man in the service...but all is not lost, he will still have his chance to save the day. And the Earth. A nice thought. The acting was fair. The two actors playing gay were a touch awkward with each other, though very handsome. I wished fervently for more obvious intimacy between them, after all they are seriously involved, right? Well, at least an attempt is being made to have a heroic gay couple. Both actors are very mascluine, not parodies, for once. I only wish they were more comfortable with each other. So it depends what you like.",1171238400,7,876,4.48125
2593752,1,B000FZEU38,"What a ripoff!  I had been seeing the trailer for ""Deadly Skies"" on several other dvds I'd rented.  The main reason a wanted to see it was for the gay twist to the storyline.  I rented it at my local video store.  Not only did they cut out all of the gay scenes, They added an extra scene at the end to make it look like Antonio Sabato Jr. and Rae Dawn Chong were getting together. It wasn't a bad movie, but I rated it one star for the deception!",1158796800,10,447,3.933333333333333
2593753,3,B000FZEU38,"Who can tell why this film was made? FORCE OF IMPACT (aka DEADLY SKIES) was apparently made for TV though it seems highly unlikely that it was ever screened. Not that the story itself is a problem: giant asteroid is sailing toward the earth with the potential of destroying the planet unless someone is smart enough to out guess the logistics.  In this film the smart one is Rae Dawn Chong in a role she can sleep walk through.  The government is not eager for her company to employ its 'better than government issue' strategies:  Rob LaBelle and Michael Moriarty have a great time being mean.  But it is Rea dawn Chong who remembers a terrific mind in the form of Antonio Sabato, Jr. who can save the planet....

And that is where the difference lies - Chong encounters Sabato and his lover Michael Boisvert in flagrante in a completely nude sex scene that is as sensual as any found in the movies.  Nothing much is made of the reason for Sabato to be gay and that is good: he just happens to be a gay man in a healthy relationship, and the chemistry with Boisvert is definitely there.  But that is about all we get, other than an opening scene when two beautiful young au naturel women make it in a swimming pool while a mini-asteroid collides in the water.

So it is another routine space age flick, but add to the salad the eye candy offered, and it is almost worth sitting through the movie!  Pretty people help keep this one afloat.  Grady Harp, September 06",1158451200,2,1464,4.42910447761194

2593778,2,B000FZEU38,"This film is laughably low-tech and most of the acting is very inadequate. However, if you can suspend your disbelief, it's not a total letdown. At least there's nice eye candy in it.",1403481600,,183,4.575757575757576
2593779,3,B000FZEU38,The story is pretty much nothing new but it is well told. Have to admit I was surprised the movie opened with the two male stars romping around buck naked in bed.,1395100800,,162,4.09375
2593780,4,B000FZEU38,this drags so much but  it is still a good way to spend a evening nude scene could have done with out but the acting is good and the movie fills a empty void with joy,1394582400,,166,3.611111111111111
2593781,3,B000FZEU38,There was an audio problem where everything was echoed but it was easily ignored the story was pretty good of the movie was higher budget it could have been a lot better,1389052800,,169,4.3125
2593782,4,B000FZEU38,"The movie itself is a cliched filled low budget TV disater flick. That being said, it was worth the money I spent. One way it was different than most of these movies was the love story. The hero was gay instead of straight. Also, the visual effects were horrible. The original Star Trek had better effects. Despite this,or maybe because of this, I enjoyed the story. I must admit I have a waekness for B movies. It was MST3K worthy in its B-movieness.",1340064000,,451,4.445783132530121
2593783,5,B000FZEU38,"Well I guess I am a sucker for a guy in uniform.  Thought this movie was well performed and interesting to watch. Although the story line has been played more than once, the fact that the key men are gay and a couple made me interested even more.

I guess all I can say about this movies is that its alot like the movie ""Asteroid"" but the main characters are portrayed gay instead of str8.  Scientist gets ignored and she finds someone else to help her with finding a solution.  But what I likes about it is the characters are portrayed gay and I like that.  So I watched this movie and bought it as soon as I finished.

It helps that the main character is Antonio Sabato Jr. (He's hott) and Rae Dawn Chong (New to me but he's FINE!)

A movie I would recommend to watch if your into military guys and some romance along the way.  I guess Just a sucker for a guy in uniform.  LoL",1292976000,,878,4.117647058823529
