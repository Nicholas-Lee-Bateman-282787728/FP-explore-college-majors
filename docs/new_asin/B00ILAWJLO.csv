6281432,3,B00ILAWJLO,"Great Set list and good performance, but video production suffers. Some cameras are 4x3 stretched to 16x9. Stereo sound is highly compressed and low in volume. Appears to be a low production that was done by a band on a budget, but still good to see the brothers do this tribute to the first band.",1399161600,27,297,4.418181818181818
6281433,5,B00ILAWJLO,I couldn't help myself. This set just crushes it. Any Allman Brothers fan would be proud to own this disc.,1399161600,3,106,4.35
6281434,5,B00ILAWJLO,"There's enough about the description of this to make you skeptical: when you read they're playing the first two albums, you might fear that it's merely a faithful recreation of what you heard 40 years ago. But that's not the case. On the prior Beacon DVD the band seemed to hew to the original solos too much, but that's not the case here. The years have made a difference in terms of the comfort with the material and the chemistry in the band. It's looser, less formal, and the performances here are clearly a product of THIS band, not the one from 1971.

That means that the solos are different, the interludes are different, and it's a new experience.

Revival not only builds in the snippets of ""Joy To The World"" you remember from Fillmore East, but it's a major springboard for variations. And Elizabeth Reed is stunning; a really great bass solo (with Derek Trucks looking on appreciatively as it happens) followed by the bass player sitting behind Butch's drum kit while Butch mans the tympani, and we get to see an interlude of four drummers going at once.

I won't hesitate to review with two or three stars on Amazon. This one gets five: It's really splendid. Don't hesitate for a moment.",1398988800,51,1200,4.598130841121495
6281435,3,B00ILAWJLO,Hope this is fixed and called back for corrected copy. otherwise it's the Allman Bros. so you can't go wrong,1398902400,5,108,4.45
6281436,5,B00ILAWJLO,"This was an incredible show, captured with a good sound mix and good quality video.  Stereo sound is great.  Cannot say about 5.1, as I don't have the system.  If you are a fan of the first two albums, this is the best!  The intensity that I have heard from several of the 40th anniversary shows was very high, throughout the entire Beacon run.  If you don't have CD's of the shows that Clapton was a guest, buy them from the Allman Brothers web site!",1398816000,11,451,4.258823529411765
6281437,5,B00ILAWJLO,"I got my copy by pre-order and just viewed it for the first time last night.  It was recorded at The Beacon Theatre in New York on March 26, 2009, which was the exact 40 year anniversary to the day from when the band first played together.  The Allman Brothers Band runs through their entire first two records in the same song order, adding Statesboro Blues as an encore.  All other nights at The Beacon that year included guest artists, which would present an array of licensing and legal issues.  Most likely this is the reason those shows have not seen an official DVD release.  The Allmans performed by themselves on this evening with no guests.

To a long-time fan like myself, this is easily the hottest video documentation of The Allman Brothers Band to date.  The songs are familiar of course to any fan, as the first two records contain at least half of the band's greatest songs.  And the performances here are astounding.  Improvisation comes long and hard, the band's stunning jazz/rock muscle in full view throughout.  Revival is a version like you've never heard, they expand on it so ingeniously that the song is nearly unrecognizable until they break back into the chorus.  Please Call Home is earthy and soulful, Gregg Allman singing like only Gregg Allman can.

If you're looking for a truly smoking and classic rock DVD..............look no further!",1398643200,94,1368,4.799145299145299
6281438,2,B00ILAWJLO,"Without a doubt, Sweet Melissa is the favorite Allman Bros. song....How could they leave it out ?  No Sweet Melissa, I'm not interested",1398643200,4,135,4.869565217391305
6281439,5,B00ILAWJLO,"Do not put any faith in the negative reviews. This is a GREAT video of the Allman Brothers 40th Anniversary show. The video quality is fine; it does not detract from the overall experience. A true ABB fan appreciates the first two albums played in order, start to finish.
Highlights include an incredible ""Revival"", featuring an unreal solo by Derek Trucks, followed by an almost-as-good solo by Warren Haynes. As usual, they stretch out Elizabeth Reed, with a great set of bass/drum solos. Meanwhile, Gregg sounds great right throughout.
Don't place ant credence in the 1,2, 0r 3 star ratings. They are fake news.",1497916800,,614,4.913461538461538

And I had forgotten just how strong the songs are - it's not just brilliant execution of lame material, it's passionate playing and singing of great material.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that the recording itself doesn't do as good a job of showcasing the band as it could.  I have other concert DVDs where the instruments are more clearly separated and spread about the sound stage.  (So I listened to it via headphones and that took care of that.)

6281472,2,B00ILAWJLO,"The performance itself is OK, not their best by a long shot. The band is clearly laughing at all their own mistakes throughout the performance. Gregg, who appears to be in very good form, seems disgusted with them. I suspect that there might have been some ""celebrating"" of the anniversary back stage prior to taking the stage. The band even ends the encore a verse early with Gregg desperately trying to sing the verse while everyone else is making ""big rock finish"" noises, oblivious to the mistake.

The high point musically is Oteil's spotlight at the end of IMOER, and even that is ruined by the idiot bongo player who simple will not leave a hole for anyone all night. Wish he'd stayed with Spyro Gyra. The Allman Brothers would have been so much tighter rhythmically with just one drummer and no bongo player. The three marginal percussionists all banging away results in the distruction of the pocket in nearly every song, and it's extra evident on this disc.

I would give only one star for the audio mix, which also seems like bongo boy must have had a hand in. It's the worst audio of any DVD I own. Can't hear the guitars, bass, or keys much at all, and the vocals are thin and not up front. This is a DVD that one buys only as an historical milestone, not for pure enjoyment. I watched it once and will never watch it again. Pity.",1443484800,3,1343,4.455284552845528

6281480,5,B00ILAWJLO,"Stunning, amazing and in reality 'just another' stellar show by the band. Derek Trucks and Warren Haynes guitar work varies from blistering to sonic molasses and Gregg's voice shares the ache of a 1000 hopes lost, love won and run, and the blues run deep in every way. This show was to commemorate 40 years since Duane's passing and its a wonderful testament to the taken-too-soon slide master.

What keeps this at three stars: 1) As others noted, not exactly great quality video or audio. Expect better in 2014.  2) The big deal about the 40th anniversary run was the great number of guests that played with the band. Unfortunately, none of these guests are on the DVD. A big disappointment. I'm fine with that, but why is so much emphasis of this put on the product description if the DVD itself doesn't feature any guests with the band?",1421884800,10,620,4.486725663716814

6281535,4,B00ILAWJLO,"The editorial review, however, is incorrect. March 26, 1969 marks the date of the jam that led to the formation of the Allman Brothers. What is incorrect is the personnel listing. Gregg wasn't there. It was the other 5 original members (Duane, Dickey, Butch, Jaimoe, and Berry) with Reese Wynans (later famous for being in Stevie Ray Vaughan's band).  Gregg came later, at Duane's insistence, because nobody really sang or wrote (although obviously, Dickey would do both later).",1406678400,,478,5.128205128205129

6281538,5,B00ILAWJLO,"A fitting tribute to Duane Allman and Berry Oakley.  Derek Trucks, Warren Haynes, and Oteil Burbridge filled their and Dickey Betts shoes very well.  While these songs were played in sequence as they had been on the original albums, they were not note per note renditions.  Many were extended jams and played as one would expect at any Allman Brothers concert.  Statesboro Blues was also a fitting encore.  It is too bad that Dickey Betts is no longer speaking to his former bandmates.  Maybe the fact they included his songs will heal the rift.",1406073600,2,545,4.74468085106383

I felt the sound mix could have been better but overall the sound in 5.1 is good. I agree the stereo mix is not that great, flat and not dynamic as the 5.1 mix sounds. The guitar playing is top notch from Warren and Derrek, the filming seems to mostly focus on them. Overall I am happy this concert was put on DVD as I missed their final tour despite being in the USA recently. I am hoping more footage from this tour will come out such as the footage with Clapton and other guests.",1402790400,,609,4.126050420168068

6281557,3,B00ILAWJLO,"Since this was a show in which they covered the original band's first two albums, it felt more like a tribute band than this version of the ABB.

6281563,3,B00ILAWJLO,"This is Allman Brothers Band thus I believe that they are better than 80% of the bands out there even on their worst day.  We all agree that At Fillmore East is probably one of the greatest live recordings of all time.  I've also been digging the One Way Out Live At Beacon Theatre live recording (released in 2004) which showcases a renewed Allman Brothers Band with the Trucks/Haynes combo.

This DVD, however, falls slightly short in terms of performance compared to the two recordings mentioned above.  I fully appreciate that they intended to play the first two albums in sequence as a tribute to Duane Allman, but perhaps there was a better way to arrange the setlist to keep the interest of the viewer/listener.

In terms of audio and video quality, I can't complain much.  It is in DVD and not Bluray format, so obviously I'd have preferred a Bluray version, but the DVD is not bad by any means.  A slight criticism would be the camera work on the DVD.  I'm no videographer, but the camera angles seem a bit dated to me and doesn't approximate the feeling of 'being there'.

Conclusion:  While I appreciate the band's sentiment in honoring Duane Allman by playing the first two albums in sequence, it is let down by a performance which often stays within the boundaries of 'good' but rarely risks it to push the performance to 'exceptional'.  Still worth a buy if you're an Allman Brothers Band fan.",1399766400,12,1407,4.633064516129032

This is a disc I'll enjoy much more while playing in the background than I will while focusing on it as a visual experience.  Also, while I love the classic setlist with the first two albums played back-to-back, the current iteration of the ABB is just as much about newer tunes and somewhat obscure covers as the classics, and those are simply missing (by design) from this set.",1399248000,4,533,4.9

The band is really tight, great sound quality.  Maybe in the future they will release the entire thing, that would be a monster release for sure.

Not sure who was the brilliant guy behind the production, but they killed the concert with this pissed poor production. As estated above by another reviewer, some cameras are 4x3 stretched to 16x9. Sound in 2009 should be far better than that, period...
Warren, Derek your own concerts are far better recorded, why let an a$$ ruin this wonderful night with bad decisions about how we should watch a concert, if you filmed in 4:3. just leave it in 4:3, who cares? But why stretching the image? That is simply ridiculous, an unnaceptable, do you really believe that anybody will believe that a drum is an oval? Maybe in Mars!!!",1399248000,32,690,4.758333333333334
