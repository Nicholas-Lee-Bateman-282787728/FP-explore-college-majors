16298,5,0767839129,"Well, the opinions for Luc Besson's latest movie--The Messenger are so extreme. Some said that it is wonderful,impressive but some said that it is aweful. I'm not surprised that Luc Besson's movie would arouse so many  controversies for his work is so innovative.  Whenever an artist wants to  deal with history in his work, he will face a singnificant problem--the  accurancy. Some argue that to be loyal to history is very important but to  me art is art,history is history(To me movies are Art).If art work reveals  nothing more but merely presents the history once again,why do we call that  Art?So,some changes or some polishment of history events in movies is  acceptable or even necessary as long as it dosen't go too far. All I want to  know is how Luc Besson would portray Joan. Luc Besson,of course, has read  many books about Joan. Do you think that he did not know how Joan was  described. He knew,of course. Then why did they still portray Joan in this  way?What did the director want to tell us?Making amendments to history is  not a big deal but the motive of doing such amendments is what I concear  most.  Remember the name of the movie is""The Messenger !Is Joan  really a messenger?That was what Luc Besson wanted to explore. And his Joan  is not longer carrying a divine image. She is just a human. A human can never  be perfect. So somtimes Joan will be fierce,weak,confused and proud. Some may  not like this image of Joan. They may think that it ruined the heroine. For  centuries Joan has been portrayed by history, books, legends,  sculptures,literature and paintings as divine,virtuous,gentle and  brave. Finally it became a fixed image of Joan. People can hardly accept  others .Luc Besson's Joan of Arc did explore a new field for the  interpretation of the maid of Lorraine. It smashed the virtuous,  perfect,divine image of conventionally protrayed Joan. It is innovative and  his Joan is much more humane. Then why must his Joan be so  fierce?Actually,the image of Luc Besson's Joan of Arc was shaped to serve  the themes of the movie. The second theme is satire against  battles.""And the battle of our pride,greed and hunger deep  inside"".Remember what Joan said in her last confession?She said she  was just like all the others who believed that they are allowed to do  anything when they fighting for their ideals. She said she was proud,she was  selfish and  cruel.""Fierce"",""Proud"",""Selfish"",and  ""Cruel"" are simply descriptions about all human being. In  fact,robbery,murder,rape are no longer crimes or sins under  nationalism,patriotism and for those who are religionists in our world. We  believe that we can hurt others,start battles when we are fighting to  achieve certain ""high goaling""...The battle scenes may not be as  good as those in ""Braveheart"" but it carries a much deeper  meaning that ""Braveheart"" did.  Some said that Milla Jovovich  acted badly. I think she clearly understood what Luc Besson wanted to  present and how his Joan of Arc should be like. So she did her best to fit  her role--Joan of Arc as a simple,talented,brave girl. And she acted pretty  well. Even much better that she did in ""The Fifth Element"".I  don't mean that her performance was perfect. But on average her performance  ws great,impressive and convincing. She impressed me so much that I could  feel glorious with Joan at the coronation of Charles 7th. I was shocked and  touched by her acting when Joan's stong belief, self-esteem were  challenged,denied and finally collapsed when facing the God(I don't think  the word conscience is suitable enough for the role of Dustin Hoffman. It  should be a mix of God and a representative of the war deep inside Joan's  heart).Milla's green eyes were always shown with unbreakable confidence and  will. She was so mighty and heroic when she was in her armour,riding a horse  and waving her banner. Her performance is wonderful. For those who could not  accept such an interpretation of Joan of Arc would not, of course,enjoy her  performance. Never mind. Every individual is unique. Everyone has got a  particular image of Joan of Arc in his mind. And I am glad to see that so  many controversies over this film because only good film can arouse as many  differential says. I do think that The Messenger is the best Luc Besson has  ever produced. I've seen it 8 times in the theatre without getting bored. To  me,it is really a masterpiece!",950572800,,4413,4.871794871794871
16299,5,0767839129,"This is the best historic movie i had ever seen. This movie was a huge success both because it has a numerous and popular cast (Milla Jovovich, John Malkovich, Dustin Hoffman) and because it is well directed form an  also popular director Luc Besson. When someone is watching this movie,  instantly remembers a similar movie that had also a huge success. I am  talking of course about ""Braveheart"". We all known that this movie had won  several academic awards and I am looking forward to see ""Joan Of Arc""  winning academic awards too.",950572800,4,536,4.720430107526882
16310,5,0767839129,"Very realistic portrayal of Joan considering all the evil and greed from the French and  English. I've watched many portrayals of Joan and her agony. A Girl chosen, a teenager with a very heavy load.

I personally recommend Mark Twain''s book, Joan Of Arc. Joan captivated Twain such that he spent 7 years in France researching Joan's life. The most interesting narratives concerning her trial were taken from the trials transcripts. I don;t believe anyone can truly understand her brilliant, eloquent, defense for her cause and herself in language that seemed to be written for the bible, unless you read his book. You will actually stand up and cheer.",1508198400,,653,4.981651376146789

16313,4,0767839129,"This film from 1999 already in some ways feels like the product of another age.  Using only practical effects, no CGI, it tells the story of Joan of Arc and her quest to liberate France.  Was she a saint anointed by God to save France, or a delusional young woman, the film offers no easy answers.

I enjoyed it both as a historical war film complete with sieges and brutal battles and as a character study of St. Joan.  I'm no expert and can't really speak to the historical accuracy of the film but I do want to praise Milla Jovovich's acting.  She conveys a woman who is simultaneously driven and committed, with no uncertainty or doubt but who is also completely out of her depth.  She's no superhero, she makes mistakes and disregards reality too much, she almost defies reality by strength of will, but can't quite.  One great scene opens with a close up on Joan gasping, it pans back to show her holding her banner, standing defiantly before an enemy castle.  It's only after a minute that someone comes by to point out she has an arrow in her leg.  Joan seems to notice if for the first time...

It has flaws, but a lot of them are due to the filmmaker not wanting to offer us easy answers.

Great performances from John Malkovich and Dustin Hoffman round it out and make it an enjoyable historical epic.",1505952000,,1312,4.425

16329,5,0767839129,"Loved how actor Paul Brooke went from his priestly duties (The Messenger - 1999) of hearing the 2 or 3 times a day confession of young Joan of Arc, to auctioning off the Phantom of the Opera's (2004 film) glass chandelier in Paris, France in 1919.  Paul Brooke is the KING of opening scenes.  He was the star of the opening scenes in both films.  Very distinctive voice.
I liked how Joan of Arc went from hearing the voices of Saints: Margaret, Catherine, and Michael
to Christine's hearing the voice of the Angel of Music (The Phantom).

I like how THE MESSENGER unspokenly links the Burgundian wolves to the Benjamite wolves of Book of Judges chapters 19-21.
Both the Burgundians and Benjamites were known for rape murder (or) gang rape murder.  In the attack on Domremy(Doe Ray Me), a pack of black wolves leads the charge, as young Joan investigates her burning village. Joan's sister is then rape murdered (or murdered, then raped).

This film has (in my opinion) the best burning at the stake scene of all the Joan of Arc films.
And it quite clever how the film depicts Joan as receiving confession (night by a priest or bishop), but by her own conscience, played by actor
Dustin Hoffman.

This film does not give much attention to Isabelle Romee or Jacques d'Arc (Joan's parents).  If you want to see extensive footage on that you must watch the 1999 TV miniseries Joan of Arc.  Powers Boothe plays a very DARK (d'Arc) Jacques d'Arc - a d'Arc Vader sort of role.  But be sure to get that in DVD and not VHS because the VHS leaves out extremely important scenes such as Jacques d'Arc (Joan's dark father) attempting to snuff out the life of the newborn baby Joan.  You also would miss on VHS the ending scene where Jean d'Metz takes Joan's banner back to Doe-Ray-Me after her death - where you see her parents reaction to the news.

This film is properly rated R because of the rape/humping/murder scene of Joan's sister Catherine, for strong language: ""F"" word used extensively, and for other graphic battle scene violence.

There is more comic relief in this film about Joan than others I have seen (Joan of Arc - TV miniseries 1999; Joan of Arc - Child of War, Soldier of God - 2005; classic Joan of Arc (????) starring Ingrid Bergman).

If you watch the VHS version of The Messenger, you miss out on a couple things.  You miss out on the nuns inspecting Joan for proof of virginity.
You also miss out on Charles VII considering each of his 3 military captains for one to sit on the throne as himself to fool Joan.
You miss a view other scenes as well.",1492560000,,2561,4.512987012987013

16346,3,0767839129,"I saw this film once and once was enough. As a secular free-thinker but  Catholic as a child I was taught Jeanne was a saint. Even now, she remains a puzzlement. ntil lately, I could find no objective books about her until I found a book by Frances Gies and other sensible historians (not dramatists) who presented this heroine in a most objective and respectful historical account. Hero tough, unshakeable faith in what she believed  caused her to go to crown Charles the dauphin as Charles VII of France, and to accomplish this she will have to lead an army and raise the siege of--and defeat the English in--Orleans. On that pathway she carried a banner and inspired thousands by proving herself. The film title Messenger does not suit her; more likely it should have been titled The Battle Within. If Jeanne had behaved in real life as she did in the film she would never been put at the head of an army--in fact Robert de Baudricourt would never have outfitted her to go to war but sent her home under guard. Milla Jovovich did a great job of playing a hysterical schizophrenic, not Jeanne D'Arc.

In the 1400s medieval males, essentially the English army, believed women who were with soldiers were prostitutes. In most of the films about her she was were portrayed, (though erring on the side of religious mysticism)  her as someone with, along with excessive piety, still had some common sense, a very loving, confident, and brave girl (she begins her ""assignment"" at age 17) with no riding or battle experience, is illiterate, and of the people, she never forgets the goal, in short, a believable leader. In The Messenger if it was meant to be analytical they miss the mark by a mile. She is portrayed as a hypertensive, hysterical, half scared Jeanne who, when finally realizing she is doomed to a horrid death, sees her ""conscience"" or some Guy in Black, come into her cell and tell her in effect that she got the wrong message and the joke is on her. As other reviewers who share my disappointment in this film have stolen my thunder and I applaud them for it, I will not repeat what is already intelligently opined.

But when I saw Dustin Hoffman come barging into her already doomed condition, playing what seemed a Bad Guy, or a spoiler,the ""devil"" or god or a conscience, some unnecessary addition, it really made me shake my head. Years later, after reading the IMDB-presented dialogue  between Jeanne and Hoffman on line, telling her she never heard anything she didn't want to hear, I was plain disgusted. Sure, Hoffman was a good actor in a cameo role and can do no wrong EXCEPT agree to appear as this creepy guy who symbolizes something sinister. Well, I knew why I had stopped watching the movie: because at is precisely where it should have ended  Because that would have added everything up just fine. We all know from history the trial was rigged and that she was burned at the stake: her decision to resume male attire was her downfall--she was attacked by guards when she wore women's dress designated h er as relapsed. She was a true innocent in real life and did what she believed and was portrayed woefully wrongly. What a shame, they got Jeanne all wrong for the sake of titillating entertainment.",1471564800,,3229,4.644483362521892

16361,1,0767839129,"Where to begin, where to begin.  First, Jeanette had three older brothers and a little sister.  Jeanette's sister, Catherine, died giving birth to a child, not as depicted in this film.  Second, Jeanette first heard the Voices in the garden by the house, then she saw a bright light.  The Voices identified themselves as St. Michael, St. Catherine, and St. Margaret.  Jeanette repeatedly tried to save English lives.

The story of Jeanette (""Little Joan""), a 5'2"" teenager who led the armies of France inspired by Voices and was burned at the stake would make a marvelous movie or musical.  Whether she was a saint or delusional, the movie could balance the depiction and let the viewer decide.

But what this movie does not capture and what needs to be captured is the pathos of this small, teenage girl abandoned by her country, surrounded by enemies, fighting for her life.

Having said all of that, this is a Movie, not a Theologian examination, and in my experience with writers, directors, and producers  often know little of history, or theology. Their goal is entertainment, drama, and creativity. Over the agegis the stories  of such events have changed any number of times, and misunderstanding that regardless of religion the churches tend to recreate and wright out anything they  think may damage their saints. In recent decades the story of ""Joan of Arc"", (incidentally Her surviving signatures are all spelled ""Jehanne"" without surname) have been slaughtered and changed. Never the less, the vast majority of movie goers probably have never read the books of saints, and go out to the movies to see a good action film.
Personally, though I liked the movie, despite that it was short, and left a good deal of ""Jehanne's"" story was not even mentioned in this film, it was filled with action, and somewhat exciting.

Milla is terrific, as is Besson's direction. You love the way this film moves. Not only is it a great action story, but it is appealing in the way Joan slowly gains the recognition, admiration, and finally idolization of her male Knight partners in battle, exhibiting heroism and absolute unrelenting determination. For me, it is set aside from all those other Joan movies exactly because we are kept guessing as to whether Joan is mentally disturbed, entrusted on a path from God, or maybe a little of both. The supporting characters are believable, and the acting is great, especially from the fantastic Malkovich. I give this a big ""thumbs up"" (missing you Eber).

16438,4,0767839129,"I've seen a lot of Joan of Arc movies--I herd voices telling me this one was probably the most down to earth!

I wasn't sure whether to buy this movie or not, but after watching it--taking a chance it might be good--I was (thoroughly and pleasantly) surprised. Certainly, this rendition of Joan's story isn't your usual, bubbly, gushy, lathered on glop of over acted piety, that inevitably leaves the viewer feeling sandblasted, empty, and wondering why the pope himself doesn't hear voices too? Perhaps his eyes aren't as dreamy as Leelee Sobieski's. The Messenger is a hard--gritty--rendition of the French peasant girls rise to glory and her premature death by execution. And while its Joan (Milla Jovovich) doesn't have a soft tear stained face that could melt every Burgundian heart in the room at her hearing, Jovovich's insane expressions convincingly convey the pain, internal struggles, and feverishly pitiable attempts of a simple farm girl as she stumbles to weed out the reality of what she sees from the imagined. I easily found myself laughing with Joan's captains as the spunky French girl, with a fuse as short as the bob haircut she sports, charges recklessly into battle, like a whirlwind. While the musical score isn't anything to go scouring youtube for in the hopes of downloading, it doesn't fall completely flat (just into the background),The Messenger's cinematography is excellent, with diverse camera angles, shot that make every scene feel extremely real, and acting to bring down the chapel; not to mention a stunningly vivid burning at the stake finally that leaves us feeling as seared as Joan. I would definitely recommend this film, even though it is not considered as historically accurate as 1928 French film, it's an all together less staged take on the story of Joan of Arc.",1412553600,5,1810,5.033333333333333

Would we not have a beautiful French world in grace and honor without Joan of Arc?  A woman, can make or break a country. Yet, it is the folly of man to bring us to that very moment. Heed then, the possibility that she ""was"" experiencing a deep rooted or subliminal communication. From where else? Our heaven, her heaven or your heaven...and, what plane of dimension would that be then - if, it were from any of those resources?

Overall, it was inspiring and it too displayed the myopic view of where the world thought a woman's place was. And, how not unchanged it is today. Irony though...her name and history was canonized, nevertheless. Bravo!",1391904000,,1026,4.726256983240224

16470,1,0767839129,"This movie is dreadful, just dreadful.

From the opening shot of the map, crawling with animated blood, to the contemporary vulgarisms,(""Now, that's what I call a miracle!"") director Luc Bresson shows us the sensibility of a circus owner in his telling of the rural French genius who helped re-unite France only to be literally sold-out to a powerful man with a grudge, a man who used her claims of hearing the voice of God against her so that he might have her killed in a most torturous way.
Bresson gets utterly wacky performances from a cadre of actors (Malkovich, Dunaway, Hoffman, Karyo, Jones... ) that looks impressive on the page, but winds up just making the viewer (well, me) just... embarrassed for all involved. Jeanne/Joan acts equally unconvincingly and affectedly, as if starring in a high-school production of ""Girl, Interrupted.""
Her take-your-meds, sputtering announcements do not portray her as a vessel of the devine as much as a
a kid trying to get out of doing a book report. The scenes of rape, post-mortem and of an accusing Jesus are not weird or trippy.

16486,4,0767839129,"Reading through these reviews, I think what a lot of people really wanted to see, was a documentary. So yes, I must say straight away, that there are a lot of historical inaccuracies in this film both with regards to 'Joan' and her life, and also with the general story, costumes/weapons, etc.

By all accounts 'Joan' was not the crazed character that she appears in this film, instead being more quiet, pensive and humble, but I did find the fanaticism to be an interesting take on her; especially considering all the frustrations of being a low-born woman,obstructed by hierarchy and the male society as well as frantically trying to come to terms with these visions (something that becomes more apparent near the end of the film). Perhaps the director took it too far and she becomes seemingly a bloodthirsty zealot, but such fanaticism created a dynamism about the film which did help translate some of the emotion and passion to the viewer. I also enjoyed the visions that she suffered in the film despite them being inconsistent with those documented historically, as they did have the impact of making one think about all of the possibilities and whether 'Joan' could perhaps have merely saw what she wanted to see (even if such a conclusion (as would perhaps be logical based on this film)does not seem coherent with her own written accounts). So yes, it was nice to have a thinking point. Beyond this, the actual film was fairly slick, with great action scenes,evocative and impressive visuals, and a strong soundtrack. The performance of 'Joan' was strong, if not a portrayal that everyone would have wanted.

In conclusion, if you're expecting a strictly accurate telling of the life of 'Joan', maybe you should give this a miss. For others who fancy seeing a thought-provoking yet action-packed and punchy film, this one may be worth seeing.",1378166400,,1853,4.898089171974522

Ultimately, the movie isn't the most historically accurate movie, but it does get most of the major points correct and the battles take place in the correct order.

The Messenger is a much better film than The Fifth Element - the photography and scenery is fabulous, and the supporting cast is perfect. Fay Dunaway, John Malkovich, Dustin Hoffman... it's just great.

Perhaps the scene I like best of all the large-scale battles is where Joan takes an arrow, and we look right into her face as she falls 20-30 feet off a ladder, into the arms of the men below. Maybe it's not great acting, but she definitely placed a lot of trust in her cast mates.

So insane, in fact, that this character of Joan was completely unable to have a normal conversation with anyone.  None of the other characters in the film have even a smidgen of respect for her.  The closest thing to respect would be amusement to the fruits of insanity to have one's way.  One goes away with the feeling that not a single worthwhile human value was in place.  A story of a traumatized and visibly very insane woman inducted by the elite of the time as a useful fool and then completely discarded in her time of need after literally saving France and restoring the crown.  To add insult to injury, Jesus was depicted as demonic and hideous with bulging eyes, looking like he was in drag, covered in blood, and frightful. A brutal murder-rape was ""added"" to the story to make it known that Joan was not speaking to saints or doing God's work but a severely traumatized, very immediately visibly mentally ill person who ultimately chose her own death to appease her delusions.

The movie completely transforms and warps Joan's childhood. There was no attack on her village and she never witnessed her sister getting raped that part is clear. As for the giant spinning propellers,although they might make for an awesome scene, are completely false to the times of which the period is placed. The las and most important falsehood given in the film is the way we view Joan herself. In the movie we witness her as the extremely hot headed border line luney bin character. Where as it is reported many times in history that she was calm and actually quite most of the time. By the director changing Joan's childhood it makes it seem as if most of the reason Joan is doing this is for hidden revenge. Although all these are pretty heavy crimes against history they do manage to add some historical accurate details into the film. The use of muder holes and other siege weapons (trebuchet, siege ladders, siege towers) all of these are well displayed within the movie. So if your going to buy this film it comes down to what you want in this movie. If your an action packed awesome fight scenes kind of person you'll love the movie for what it is.

16514,4,0767839129,"This film has a rather original - and perhaps not always convincing - take on the character of Joan of Arc, played here by Milla Jovovich as being somewhat shrill, or even hysterical at times. One reviewer wondered whethe she was really a Saint inspired by God (but then why would God necessarily take the French's side?) or whether she was ""plain bonkers"". Luc Besson, often original - regardless of whether tou likeor not what he does (and a lot of people tend to not like it - seems to have gone for some mix of the two.

This tends to somewhat summarize LUc Besson, his style, and this film in particular. It is spectacular all the way, from the battle scenes - as gory and ""realistic"" as you might expect - to Jeanne's ""voices"", pictured as if in some kind of fantasy or even a horror film. You like it very much or you dislike it just as intensily, or, you like perhaps some of it - the battle scenes are rather good, although they may perhaps feel a bit ""overdone"" -(and ""over gory"" in particlar), but then this is about personal preferences and since none of us were actually there, it's rather difficult to objectively appreciate whether scene A or scene B is ""realistic"" or not.

Now, to what extent is this film historically accurate? Here also, reviewers have tended to go to extremes. In fact, the film is generally more accurate than the average film we are used to watching, whether Troy, Brave Heart, Gladiator, Robin Hood (both the older version with Kevin Costner and the one with Russell Crowe), Kingdom of Heaven. However, everything is definitly NOT historical. The Director has taken a number of liberties, as Directors always tend to do. For instance, the beginning of the film, where the farm of Joan of Arc's parents is attacked and her sister gets into trouble, to put it mildly, is one of these inventions. Is it a howler? Not necessarily, unless who require each and every of your films that take place in Antiquity or during the Middle Ages to be as historical accurate as possible, but in such a case, there are hardly any that you will really like. On the other hand, there are also a lot of cases where Luc Besson has stuck to the historical record as much as possible.

After the ways in which the ""wicked English"" were rather mistreated in both Brave Heart and the Patriot (Mel Gibson in both cases, I'm afraid), some reviewers have been wondering whether, yet again, the English were being somewhat portrayed and caricatured as ""the baddies"", and were somewhat annoyed at it. In particular, some may have wondered whether depicting the English as insulting Joan and treating her as if she was a witch while also behaving as what could be seens as a cowardly manner, was not tainted with some unpleasant undertones of rench nationalism. This is, of course, a film done by a French Director, something than could fuel such a suspicion until one remembers how superstitious people were in the 15th century and on both sides (and how superstitious most of them were well before and well after). A young and (supposedly) inexperienced maiden leading to war seasoned warriors was simply unheard of at the time. That she was successful and brought victory a couple of times at Orlans, where the six months old English siege was finally broken, and went on to win a convincing victory at Patay and to escort the Dauphin to be crowne in Reims with her army, could only be a tremendous boost to the flaging morale of the French, who were clearly losing the war before her arrival, and, on the contrary, make the English wonder if the she was not Heavenly inspired, since all her enterprises seemed to be successful.

Besides, for those who might still doubt and wonder whether the Director is being biased, it is possible to check through the sources. Jeanne, regardlss of whether she was ""inspired"" or not, clearly presented a HUGE problem for the English Kingdom of France and the Duke of Bedford in particular, simply because some, in both camps, could believe that she was inspired by God, and therefore successful. This is alo why some much effort was put in by the English, once she was captured by their Burgundian allies, into having her handig over to them. The English could not afford to have her ransomed by the French because she had become a symbol. Moreover, they needed to destroy this potent symbol, hence her trial for witchcraft and her execution in Rouen.

The most interesting question of all is, of course, whether she really was ""inspired"" or not. The French Dauphin (an excellent John Malkovitch) and, even more so, his stately and scheming mother-in-law Yolande of Aragon (an excellent Faye Dunaway) certainly chose to believe so, and it clearly suited their interests. The Catholic Church made her into a Saint, but only in 1920. The French have made her into a national heron and she is now one of the symbols of the Far Right nationalist party in France. Interestingly, some revisionist French historians - but not Luc Besson who did not take this kind of risk - have wondered about who she was exactly and whether she really was ""divinely inspired"" or not. The starting point here is that it is highly unlikely for this young teen-ager to have really been a little sheperd girl for at least three reasons. She knew how ro ride. She wore armour and seems to have also known how to fight. She also has no problems in making herself understood at Court once she arried at Bourges, at a time where country folk in France spoke a wide range of dialects and languages - as opposed to Court French.

From there, you can start imagining all sorts of conspiracy theories, one of them being that she might have been a bastard half-sister of the Dauphin soon to become Charles VII and that thewhole thing was set up by Yolande of Aragon who knew of her existence and might even have been in charge for her upbringing.

Finally, another strong point in this film is the cast of characters. Some have liked Mila's performance. Others have hated it while still others have excused her by saying she was just doing what she was told and that is why she sounds and often appears shrill and hysterical. Granted, she was not, at the time at least, the best or the most professional actor you could think of but she coul have done a lot worse. Other actors are probably much better in their roles, such as Vincent Cassel playing a yound Gilles the Rais or Tcheky Karyo in the role of Dunois, commander-in-chief of the Fenech army and the bastard son of the Duke of Orleans (and therefore the cousin of Charles, future Charles VII). The other actors playing the French captains are rather good also, in particular La Hire, historically known for always swearing and who, to avoid being told of by the young girl, did a huge effort not to swear when she was around, or Jean Poton de Xaintrailles, or the duke of Alenon. These hard and seasoned captains all somehow deferred to Jeanne, however grudgindly, and this is also rather surprising and interesting coming from them. All had much more experience than her. Some were even royal kins. Most behaved more like mercenaries, or at least warlords, happy to kill, burn, loot and rape, but their all obeyed her commands, at least to a certain extent. In itself, this is yet another hint that there was something extremely unsual with Joan of Arc, whatever version you chose to believe.

So, at he end of this long review, and despite its limitations - I should have also mentioned the piece where Joan wrestles with her conscious played by Dustin Hoffman as being possibly the worst of the whole film - I believe this very entertaining and spectacular film, which is also more conventional that it may look and feel, is just about worth (a slightly generous) four stars.",1339891200,2,7751,4.648431801604668

16516,1,0767839129,"My daughter was assigned this particular version by her professor, so I watched it, increasingly reluctantly.  The movie was badly made, revolving around the bizarre behavior of an apparently lunatic Joan, played by the director's wife. Incredibly cheesy acting, which is surprising, given the many quality actors and actresses who appear in the movie.

However, the main problem with the movie is the thrust of Besson's portrayal of Joan, which goes against the copious first-hand sworn testimony of her neighbors, friends, soldiers, confessors, and acquaintances at Joan's rehabilitation trial after her death. She was known by all to be a sober, steady, stable individual of great self-possession, who inspired great respect, admiration, and deference by all, especially the rough, no-nonsense soldiers who followed her.  Thus, soldiers sent to bring her to the King, intending to throw the peasant girl into a ditch, were won over on the way back to the king with their distrust turned to great respect. And too many other accounts like this to mention here. She won love and admiration by something other than magic tricks--by her character, demeanor, strength, and goodness. That's in the historical record.

The movie never makes it clear why anyone would have wanted to follow its portrayal of Joan, which inspires revulsion rather than love and admiration. The depiction of Joan's ""Voices"" is especially pejorative and is contradicted by Joan's own recorded words at Poitiers when examined by King Charles' representatives, at the trial of condemnation at Rouen, and the testimony of many witnesses at the rehabilitation trial.  That she was the victim of demented visions is not born out by the actual record. This isn't to claim that what she said is true; simply that the content of what she says she saw and heard are nothing like Besson's fabrications.

Many different interpretations of who Joan of Arc was are possible. But to be remotely honest, they have to respect the basic facts that are right there in the historical record, available to anyone with a minimal effort. Besson did a hatchet job on Joan of Arc, and not a very skilled one at that.  I don't recommend this movie as deserving even casual attention.",1338076800,5,2232,5.098630136986301
16517,1,0767839129,"I was so upset after watching this film, I had to write a review somewhere to caution people not to watch it.  The old silent version is the best I've ever seen of St. Joan, and the other '90s version with Leelee Sobieski did a much better job of showing St. Joan's human struggles as a young girl responding to the call of the divine, but used by and eventually abandoned by earthly powers.
Okay, here are my issues with this depiction of the saint's life:

1) The rape scene she witnessed with her sister.  This appears nowhere in the stories of her life.  Yes, we have very little hard facts to go by, but this fabrication made it look like Joan was motivated by revenge for her sister's murder and rape, rather than a holy calling.  The rest of the film for the most part supports this view (Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of her ""Conscience,"" for instance).
2) The scenes where, after her sister's funeral, Joan refuses to make the sign of the cross, and then removes a chalice of wine from the church's tabernacle, makes the motions of consecrating it, and then pours it down her throat after shouting ""I want to be with you NOW!""  There are two ways you could understand this behavior:  From a secular perspective, she totally lost grasp of reality after her sister's death.  From a faith perspective, this is complete heresy, not to mention silly misrepresentation of Catholic communion.  There would never have been a chalice of precious blood in the tabernacle (only the Eucharist, the hosts that have been consecrated at mass).  If someone ever performed any behavior like this, they would never be canonized as a saint in the Catholic Church.  Period.
3) The trippy scenes of her visions, where she encounters a slightly creepy Christ figure, and not St. Catherine, St. Margaret, and St. Michael the Archangel.  I don't even know where to start with Dustin Hoffman's character.  When I first saw him, I thought he was depicting Satan tormenting her in prison (his behavior certainly seemed more in-line with this analysis, although the credits list him as her ""Conscience"").  Then at the end, he hears her confession and then absolves her of her sin!  We know St. Joan was confessed (by an actual human priest) and received the Eucharist, because we have the priest's testimony.  Another inaccuracy:  They show her finding her sword in a field, and her ""Conscience"" has her consider all the possible ways that what she interpreted as a sign from God could actually have been just random chance.  While it is good to be cautious with interpreting signs, and should be discerned under the guidance of a trusted spiritual director, it is one of the basic elements of her biography that she found her sword in a chapel (I believe it was under a statue of St. Catherine).
5)Her death scene, where she is screaming as she burns at the stake, while some random person in the crowd waves a cross about, is very disturbing.  Yes the reality of someone being burned to death at the stake is pretty unnerving, but there seems to be something almost mocking about the cross, and her behavior looks more like despair than holy resignation (I know, I could never muster holy resignation while being burned... which is why I'm not a saint).  In her biography, St. Joan asked that someone lift up the cross that she might see it as she died, and her last word as she burned was ""Jesus.""

There were a few good moments in this movie.  I like that they show her repeatedly insisting that the army sends messages asking for the surrender of the English.  I like the scene where she rides across the field of battle to do this, prays for an end to bloodshed, and then the English turn away without fighting.  I like how they depicted her discovering the Dauphin in disguise.  But for the most part they made her seem like a raving lunatic.  It was a patronizing film told like the perspective of someone who does not believe in miracles, taking what I will admit is one of the more bizarre and mystifying saints' lives, and looking down on the ignorant peasant girl with a bit of spirit who got a little too much religion which made her an easy pawn for the political powers of her day.  Read the transcripts from her trial and you see a clever and faith-filled woman who is clearly grounded in reality.  This film is a gross oversimplification to the point of obfuscation of the real story of an incredible saint.",1336521600,11,4402,4.616174582798459

16519,4,0767839129,"Let's get a fact straight first: We know very little about Joan of Arc, anybody who pretends they know her story and even her personality need to go back to the controversial historical records there is of her. Most of them are non-contemporary records, meaning they've been written way after her supposed death (imagine recounting WW2 40 years after it happened). Those records are also tainted by the era and personal beliefs of their authors.
Beware of the figure that has been created by the Church and the governing bodies of France over the centuries, France and England had been at war often and endlessly, heroic figures are part of the propaganda efforts. Even today her figure is used by very patriotic groups in France. By the way, I'm French.

This is why some reviewers totally miss the point of the movie, this is not a historical movie, this is the exploration of a mythical character. And as such, it's a great movie. What could be the psychological profile of an individual convinced she's been called by God to wage a war? Does that ring a bell for anyone in our times of religious fanaticism surges?

Lets get a few things straight about this... 'it was far out on the speculation side.'

The scene she fell asleep on.

1. Her Sister Catherine must of been 'Saint Catherine' in a different war, and it was her training, and that is how she got to hate the English so much.  What child would not be terorized by such an event! Heck I was terrified,  and felt the same feelings. Who wouldn't? Comrade? English didn't say those kinds of terms in the 15th century. It was another time. Call it another dimension. It was told she had special training from St Catherine. I told you its far out there.

The horror of war...
2. The film making was so surreal it puts you right into the battles like nobody else could ever do. She even had visions  of Jesus and her after they retook the Tourelles saying 'what are you doing to me Joan'..and she was horrified about that.  The one thing that the original did not show was the Miracle at Patay!!!!!!!!!! Brilliantly done. She was on her white horse alone in front of the whole English Army and she scared them away!!!! An amazing bit of history for the English. Maybe the most embarrassing.

Joan finally understood that faith in God will move those mountains at Patay and no killing needed to be done.
 And there you shall see the miracle I was sent to make.
 OOOHHHH I loved every minute.

3. Dustin Hoffman is Jesus in her cell. More Speculation that I enjoyed. Bottom line is she has to be forgiven. Who isn't afraid of death? Even though she was actually tricked, she was told she would ""be saved"". She was later told in the original version with Ingrid that she did a very bad thing but the difference was they forgave her.  Her insisting to be confessed before the fire was great.  And who else to do it but the High Priest himself: Our Savior Jesus Christ.",1329609600,,1942,4.373259052924791

There was no rape scene (of her sister), and Joan was never without conviction regarding her supernatural experiences---and she used this quality well, being actually in command of the entire French army. Motivated by the Holy Spirit, she was never hysterical as is Milla Jovovich's character--frequently. Her ""conscience"", played by Dustin Hoffman was really a part Satan would relish as this character spread as much depression and suicidal hopelessness as it did sparse and dubious counsel. The direction of the film was extremely well done, as the scenes virtually leapt right out of the screen. The choreographic aspects of the scenes were also outstanding. These two dynamics were the two standout points of the film. The acting was also in the standout category with Jovovich taking the lead. A pity it is that a proper theological genesis was not applied to the screenplay; a vicarious fulfillment that would have made the film great rather than somewhat reminiscent of so many demoniacal matinees.

I mean it wasn't enough that they burned her alive by rubbing tar all over her body to burn her more effectively, they also had to torture her before she was burned.  An then to make up for their mistakes they make her into a Saint.  This movie reflects the power of women and how men are threatened by their strength.

This story begins in 1420 when there is war from the English invasion of France. Joan asks forgiveness for her sins - again. She converses with `him', who tells her to be good and take care of people. Joan is happy like any care-free child. She finds a sword in the grass. Then wolves run past her! Her village is attacked and burned by soldiers. Her home is invaded. Her older sister Catherine gives her a hiding place. Murder, robbery, and rape follow. [That grave is too shallow.] Joan will live with her aunt and uncle now. Can she forgive her enemies? Did God save her for some higher purpose? In Chinon the Dauphin waits. There is a message from the Maid of Lorraine, a peasant girl who wants to fight for France. Is she a fake? Simple people believe in her, it could be good for morale. Joan comes to meet the Dauphin. She avoids the fake. [Cold reading?] She has a private message to deliver. She wants to ask the King of England to leave France in peace. Or else.

Joan rides to Orleans to defend the city. The people gather around. Joan has a new plan to attack the English. ""So that's it!"" The English reply with a simple message: never. Joan rides to rally the French. ""Follow me to victory!"" They do. They raise a bigger army before attacking the English. ""Bless them all."" Joan speaks to and inspires the French army. ""Follow me!"" Joan leads an attack and is struck by an arrow through her chain mail. The next morning Joan recovers and calls for another attack. Joan has a new tactic with an old tower to break into the castle. The French break down the gates and invade the castle. ""We won."" A glorious victory! But the English are forming on the other side of the river. Joan tells them to ""Go Home"" now in peace. Or be buried in the field. The British retreat, Orleans is free. It's a miracle. The Dauphin is crowned in Rheims. The holy oil of Clovis is used to anoint Charles of Valois the king and ruler of France.

There is another battle before the walls of Paris. Where are the reinforcement from the King? Has he lost interest? The costs of a big army are high, diplomacy is cheaper. ""France belongs to God."" Can they stop Joan from attacking the Burgundians? Joan is defeated and captured in front of the city gates. The Duke of Burgundy visits her. British gold is the high bidder, Joan will go to Rouen for trial as a heretic. The Bishop asks her to answer questions. Will Joan see her visions again? Did she see what she wanted to see? Joan is questioned at her trial. Her answers are popular with the people. Can they convict her? What is she had been sent by God? Joan never killed anyone, she said. As expected, she is found guilty of heresy and other sins. The College of Paris agreed with the judgment. [Corporate flunkies?] Will she recant her beliefs? She uses an ""X"" as an signature. ""Take her away."" This is a trick to absolve the Churchmen from her condemnation. Dressing as a man in jail condemns her. Can she save her soul?

Everyone knows what happened in the market square when Joan was nineteen on May 30, 1431. Five hundred years later she was canonized as a saint. [This is more than posthumous rehabilitation.] This is a very good story if slow and talky in spots. You can compare it to the earlier version with Ingrid Bergman, if you can find the video. The movie does not go into the political background of France and England. Later in the 15th century the English were involved in the Wars of the Roses. France defeated the Duchy of Burgundy in the early 16th century.

Jeanne d'Arc is my patron, and I watched the film in the hopes that it would provide insights that cannot be depicted in words alone.  What we do know of her is that at the very least she was humble, not only in origin but in practice.  She also only spoke when pressed to do so.  Having met understated practitioners of humility, none of them scream like a lunatic, which is exactly what Jeanne does in the movie for the entirety.  The thought that a raving lunatic would sway nobility from a local baron to the dauphin that would become Charles VII is laughable.

I really cannot provide further detail because every scene entices such cringing from the woeful depiction that I consider having watched it an act of self mortification on my part.

The Joan films have been good, bad, and indifferent. The silent film is beyond compare. This one falls somewhere between bad and indifferent. Someone else mentioned the mix of accents. It drove me crazy. Most of the French army sounded more English than the English and Joan sounded like she was from Illinois. I also get extremely annoyed with historically based films that feel compelled to dumb down the dialogue by salting the dialogue with contemporary-usage obscenities and vulgarities. As a historical novelist myself, one of the things I research meticulously is the slang of the period. Nothing pulls you out of a historical moment like a 20th century slang coming form a long-ago character. I guess ultimately I have to say it's an ok movie to rent, but I wouldn't spend money on it. If you want to buy a Joan film, opt for the 1928 silent. The added orchestral score is wonderful. The acting will break your heart. This one *shrug*

Joan was never near battle as a child, had no older sister and never succumbed to, what would be mad behavior, by modern standards. It makes the viewer wonder why Besson, a Frenchman, would bother.  Jojovich is credible, but tied by the director's vision of a ranting and revengeful mad woman.  I saw a preview trailer that was simple (the child Joan swinging a sword in a field, topping off flowers) that was more evocative than the film.

Joan heard the voices of Saint Catherine, Saint Margaret, and Saint Michael. Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret were the dominant voices. She also spoke of the voices comforting her, not terrorizing her for following their direction. I despise this representation of Joan as a broken, pathetic, and incredibly insane antihero.

The inclusion, two hours in, of Dustin Hoffman as her conscience to address her own and the audience's doubts as to whether she is driven by divine guidance or self-delusion is an inspired touch that is completely unexpected in a mainstream epic on this scale. Unfortunately, it's also the point when the film almost crosses the line into Monty Python - the dialogue's just too funny too often, and somehow the notion of a 15th Century French Catholic peasant girl's conscience manifesting itself as a 62-year-old New York Jewish actor in a cowl doesn't seem overly likely. Curiously, these scenes work better on a second viewing when you're not caught so off-guard by them.

On a narrative level, these scenes do help punctuate the back-and-forth nature of the trial, but it would have probably been much better to have her in her cell talking to her unseen visions. There are still some compensations. The trial is well-handled, and Timothy West avoids the kind of ham that usually marks his cinematic turns (cf Cry Freedom) to give a surprisingly good performance as a mainly decent man trapped in an impossible situation, very similar to Ray MacAnally's role in The Mission. It's not a flawless film by any means, but it is one of the better and more ambitious 90s epics and one that's long overdue for reappraisal.

This is a great and rare movie that takes a critical view of a of piece of ""well-known"" history. It provides a plausible explanation to the ""Joan miracle"", much better than the readily accepted one.

No one in this movie is a heroes, a saint, or, for that matter, a devil. Everyone is self-serving in his/her own way and behaving just like a human being. Joan was driven by her single-minded hatred for the English and her wish to drive away the invaders. The French crown prince just wanted his crown. The English wanted Joan convicted as a heretic so as to nullify the claim that ""god is on their side"". The church wanted to stay out of it because it wanted look aloof and impartial to all Christians, French as well as English. It has nothing to gain in engaging in religious controversy.

Joan was a charismatic leader because of her single-mindedness and her conviction of a greater purpose. This is a quality people cluster to in a time of turmoil. Think of the Hitlers of our world. It is only human to have doubts, but we are charmed by people who don't. There is a fine line between charm and insanity.

The movie is roughly divided into two parts: the first part about the fighting is gritty and realistic, no heroism, just plain and brutal. The second part deals with the question of faith. Had Joan been firm to her believe, no one could accuse her of anything. Her claims of miracle was as legitimate as that of any saints in history. Her incrimination was only possible when she began to doubt herself. Dustin Hoffman was her conscience and self-doubt.

Ask yourself this question: if there is a god, why would he take the side of the French? The English king came from a line of Normand aristocrat and has as much claim to the French throne the French crown prince. Why would god take sides in any human conflict at all? All war sprung from greed and the failure to settle matters in a civilized manner. No more heroics, please.",1282348800,2,2011,4.528925619834711

Lets not talk about the acting, but rather the over acting. I wouldn't go after every actor but Mila J goes from wimpering idiot straight to wild eyed loon at the drop of a hat.

A decade ago, following the fantastic one-two punch of Leon and The Fifth Element, Besson suddenly seemed like the greatest popular moviemaker in the world. So, back then, I went to see The Messenger with sky-high expectations that were only bound to be disappointed. At the time, the movie seemed not only a pointless retelling of a story that has been filmed countless times but, worse yet, a mere star vehicle for Besson's then-girlfriend Milla Jovovich.

Ten years later, during which Besson, sadly, has been unable to recapture his earlier promise, but during which Jovovich has actually proven her chops as an actress sans Besson, The Messenger really does deserve to be reconsidered. It turns out to be a smartly-mounted, crisply-edited medieval war movie, more entertaining than Braveheart and others in this genre, and its light, humourous style actually seems prescient in terms of some of the less reverent historical epics that have been produced since. John Malkovich, who, back then, just seemed old and miscast as the Dauphin of France, now somehow seems spot on, a most knowing parody of his own egotistical image, and Jovovich, despite her technical limitations, is full of energy and fire and, as always, looks fantastic. There are even amusing echoes of Besson's more seminal work, with the story bearing striking similarities to that of The Fifth Element (beautiful girl suffused with a higher power saves medieval France instead of the world) and Tcheky Karyo providing a bemused sort of Leon to Jovovich's Mathilda on steroids. Besson's Joan of Arc may not be a candidate for cinematic canonisation, but it's a terrific movie that never deserved to be burned at the stake.",1257984000,3,1979,4.960843373493976

While in fact this Sword:

""- --In place of the sword offered to her she described in detail the location and appearance of a sword in the Chapel of St Catherine de Fierbois.  It was found deeply buried exactly where she had described and the blade was so covered in rust it would have been impossible for her to describe it without having seen it before.  The rust readily fell off when the blade was wiped. -- ""

Perhaps this film is a conspiracy of the irreverent, irreligious and atheistic working  to ""deconstruct"" Joan; to convince a modern, uninformed audience she was a raving schizoid lunatic leading the superstitiously ignorant to lucky victory; with a flaming end.  Or not.

Aside from that, I found it entirely entertaining filled with arrow sticking battle scenes and screaming mayhem.  Once I brainwashed myself into believing that actress Milla Jovovich was portraying a personality from the bizzaro world instead of a real-life historically significant figure, I actually enjoyed the film.

I have seen the 1999 miniseries of ""Joan of Arc"" starring the beuatiful young Hollywood actress Leele Sobieski, (Deep Impact, The Glass House.) Sobieski portrays Joan as an innocent but brave nineteen-year-old who fought for the freedom of France, and who sought to have the French King crowned. Although some argue that the miniseries is not entierly accurate, (but than again what movie now-a-days is?) still the ""Joan of Arc"" film depicts the herione the way the world remembers her. The miniseries is truely powerful, gripping and dramatic. It's sad that the big budget version of Joan in ""The Messenger"" is so twisted beyond any historical accuracy. In this film you don't even get the impression that Joan really was holy to the point of hearing the voices of saints calling out to her; rather Joan is simply crazy and dillusional beyond anyone's comprehension. It seems as if the director and producers intentionally portrayed Joan as a mad woman with a disperate need for making herself known to the world. But yet, as the director of the miniseries ""Joan of Arc"" stated during his research, even in books and in that movie Joan was portrayed as a sweet, loving and giving character who's strong faith in God led her to her ultimate demise; for SHE choose to go into the flame, rather than she was forced to burn at the stake.

watch this movie.

OK, look, it has a good opening start! Modern people want to see ancient maps and history. It's awesome to see how movie showed audiences what happened, when and where at the very graphical opening start of the movie, and how St. Joan begin her life's story at the time of war. I'd give 5/5 stars on how this movie was told at the start, but everything else seems to go downhill from the second half.

Don't be lazy, go read decent historical books about St. Joan instead if you want to study her.

If you need to watch a modern movie about St. Joan, I'd recommend watching ""Joan of Arc"" (DVD) starring actress Leelee Sobieski (she looks like actress Helen Hunt). Her saintly aura shines out more in Leelee Sobieski. Her body type also more or less accurately depicts how the historical St. Joan may have looked like.

Milla Jovovich, my Lady, continue on with your ""Resident Evil"" series and sexy ""Ultraviolet"" movie roles! You fare much better in sci-fi action movies.

The actual trial record demonstrates her remarkable intellect.  The transcript's most famous exchange is an exercise in subtlety. ""Asked if she knew she was in God's grace, she answered: 'If I am not, may God put me there; and if I am, may God so keep me.'""

The question is a scholarly trap. Church doctrine held that no one could be certain of being in God's grace. If she had answered yes, then she would have convicted herself of heresy. If she had answered no, then she would have confessed her own guilt.

Notary Boisguillaume would later testify that at the moment the court heard this reply, ""Those who were interrogating her were stupefied.""

Hundreds of reviewers were so moved by what Luc Besson, via Milla Jovovich did in creating this piece of interpretive entertainment that they could not control their rants till all of their feelings, both religious and intellectual were revealed.

If movies can be art and art is a means of challenging the intellect then this movie obviously is a success regardless of what, or perhaps even because of what the critics have said.

As for me, I am a huge fan of Luc Besson and now, after The 5th Element and The Messenger, Milla Jovovich as well.

Only Stanley Kubrick, to my knowledge, has a body of work with such diverse and excellent examples of his vision revealed through film.

I loved the Messenger, but perhaps for reasons that many didn't or couldn't, which is to say, I didn't take it as a literal biography of Jeanne D'arc. It seemed clear when it was named The Messenger and not ""The Life and Death of Joan Of Arc"". But, perhaps that's just me.

I thought Milla's performance rivaled and reminded me of the young Ingrid Bergman, (For Whom the Bell Tolls). I go so far to say that I was surprised when she wasn't nominated for an Oscar for her work. Seriously.

I suspect and hope that M. Besson will continue to challenge and entertain us for many years to come.  I further suspect that Milla will continue to be a talented actress that is unfortunately relegated to rolls of the super-heroine of the ultra-violent films that she has succeeded with so well.

Excellent war scenes with medieval war devices seldom seen in any other movie. A number of the aspects of warfare and armaments in The
Messenger were portrayed quite accurately and a few military historians, including Kelly DeVries, have commented on such. It had great visuals, in my opinion very good acting on everyone's part. Milla Jovovich's acting was superb in my opinion, and why the knee jerk negativity from people parroting everyone else saying ""she's a model, she can't act"" is just too lemming like to avoid being sadly humorous. I've watched it three times over the last few years and I own the DVD. Very good cast. The general and his troops were excellent. It's so typical of French history, too, lose most of your battles, finally find someone who leads you to victory, and then betray her and let your enemy burn her at the stake. I think at least a few of the negative reviews are from French apologists.",1226016000,4,1077,4.643979057591623
16584,1,0767839129,"This movie is historically inaccurate in so many ways. I wouldn't even give it one star unless Amazon made that little a requirement of the rating process. Not only does Joan not have a sister (who is VERY brually murdered in this film), but the prince is far too old.

They also make her look like an insane heretic who is quite possibly in league with the Devil.  Then, they have her kill in this film.  According to legend, she led an army, but never took a life.  She was a standard bearer, but not a soldier.

This is a horrid portrayal of Joan of Arc and possibly written and directed by someone/several people without a soul(s).  She looks like a lunatic.",1218067200,4,662,4.385245901639344
16585,3,0767839129,"For such a historical figure, I expected a bit more coming into the movie.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie simply because of the story, the action, and the time-period.  Unfortunately, however, Joan of Arc - the catalyst for legendary events in French history, the end of a war, and the first person anyone thinks of when there is even the slightest mentioning of burning at the stake - really deserves more.

First, the positive aspects of this movie probably outweigh the bad.  The scenery, style, and medieval genre is represented well.  The film has a very powerful feel, and properly displays how thoughts, beliefs, and energy can be controlled and swayed by the power of religion.  Such greatness has been accomplished through religion, but this film also shows the gritty realism of widespread death that has been brought about from religious intolerance.

The bad, however, is two-fold: acting and influence.

Joan of Arc was probably not a hyperventilating, over-reacting, deranged, incompetent military leader.  If I were French I would hate this movie.  It basically paints Joan of Arc as a vindictive, revenge-driven, screaming harpy.  The fact that Milla Jovavich seems to have read an ""Acting for Dummies"" book written by Jim Carey - where facial contortions and eyeball bulging trump conveyance of emotion through acting - definitely didn't help either.

Whereas Joan of Arc was tried for heresy, to me the people who made this movie should be charged with something similar.  There is nearly no mention of Joan's military prowess, her benevolence, or her true religious devotion.  The fact that there is almost an insinuation that she was speaking to the devil, rather than Jesus, is almost blasphemous.

There's also the character I like to call ""Creepy Jesus"".  It's almost as if everyone involved really wanted to show religion as an ugly part of humanity, the possibility of visions being realistic or divine, or that there is inherent value in religion.  There could not have been a weirder actor chosen for the character of Jesus, and there surely couldn't have been a more negative portrayal of religion.

The Messenger covers most of the historical details decent enough, entertains the audience quite well, but it's just painfully obvious that the director was interested in psychoanalysis of Joan, her actions, her visions, and religion in general.",1210550400,5,2381,5.092783505154639

16587,5,0767839129,"One of the greatest motion pictures of all time.

Luc Besson achieved directorial greatness more than once, but this film is the peak of his creative vision and success. Casting Ukrainian supermodel Milla Jovovich was a controversial idea at the time, but Besson managed to extract a nuanced performance from her - a feat, considering she is in virtually every frame of this 3-hour epic. To me, this is the greatest `war hero' film ever made - yes, even better than ""Braveheart"", ""Alexander"", or ""Saving Private Ryan"". In fact, the superiority of this motion picture far eclipses the achievements garnered by those films.

People often forget that Joan of Arc is one legendary hero about whom there exists indisputable historical evidence, in form of her court deposition (try to find the transcripts online). Even as a teenager she was remarkably mature and well-spoken for her age, and even if God did or not speak to her, her intelligence and political acumen at that young age is quite impressive.

The movie is awash in bright colors - the opening shots of the child Jean skipping down her childhood hills of Orleans are quite simply, stunning. Equally enthralling are her visions of `Jesus on the throne' as well as the extended sequence ten minutes into the film where Jean is chased by a pack of wolves, culminating in her discovery of the entire village being torched. If there is one downside to the film, it is that it depicts the English as overly boorish and immoral, while the French are noticeably better looking and far more civilized. Whether this is historically accurate or not, I do not know, but the portrayals of these two sects are quite distracting.

At centerstage is Milla Jovovich. This woman was never a great actress. In fact, I knew her more through her musical work (check out her solo album from 1994 ""The Divine Comedy"") than her movie roles. But despite her current success with the Resident Evil series, its obvious that Milla gave this film her all - lending her role with such an aura of vulnerability and authenticity that she virtually becomes Jean through the course of the film.

I also liked this movie due to its' non-dependence on fact, and its reliance upon various schools of thought. For example, the question of whether God told Jean to lead France to victory is never totally justified. In fact, her `conscience' (played towards the end of the film by Dustin Hoffman) does a fine job in ripping up Jean's ego and exposing her as a scheming egomaniac who had her own self-esteem issues to address, rather than any form of probably divinity. Again, this is alluded to, not stated as fact. In doing so, Besson opens new doors of possible thinking for the audience, and the director presents these alternate realities before us with rare tenderness that has often escaped in the past.

Standout scenes include Jean's trial. Milla's gradual transformation of Jean from a passionate female warrior to a helpless peasant girl behind bars is done in spectacular fashion. In real life, Jean was raped repeatedly by her guards and often appeared at her court trials bleeding and totally disoriented due to her abuse. The film isn't quite so graphic in its' exploration, but it does speak of the various issues she faced behind bars. Of equal importance is how France completely sold her out, and how the country she so fondly fought for, couldn't care less about her execution.

The last ten minutes of the film are the most poignant, as Jean is offered to lower her principles so that she can escape being burnt at the stake as a heretic. Milla brings such an award-worthy performance to the table here as her mind, her conscience and her rapidly deteriorating sense of self lead her to make some very forced and confused decisions and by the time politics intervenes and finally hands her the most twisted judgement, its evident that Jean has suffered both a moral and spiritual breakdown. The final scene, of Jean gazing at a cross while being burnt alive, answers the most burning question posed by modern theology - will God be present at the time of your death? The movie does not address this, but again, presents it to us as an issue to think about.

I think the most fascinating thing about this film is that Jean of Arc was a real person, and about 60% of what she faced in real life is not even mentioned in the movie. Jean's parents, for example were totally involved in her life until the very end, but in the movie they do not make an appearance anywhere in her adult life.

There are few films in which everything just WORKS - and this is a prime example of it. It has long been on my Top 10 list of All Time Greatest Films, and it's a pity to see that in this day and age, it still hasn't developed the cult fan following it so obviously deserves. A superb slice of American technology meeting European Cinematography, ""The Messenger"" is a towering achievement that remains actress Milla Jovovich's most inspired work to date. Personally I thought she deserved the Oscar for this, as she holds our attention most rivetingly for three hours, but that's art for you.

Sticking with her troops when the chips where down, she is portrayed as a devoted woman full of motivation. Whether or not her story is true, it can inspire anyone who hopes to push their ambition past obstacles.",1188432000,,469,4.595238095238095
16589,4,0767839129,"The story of Joan of Arc is a myth and legend beyond religious belief and war stories, it is a true triumph of the human spirit.  Anything you set your mind to can be accomplished no matter how strange or outlandish it may be.  And Joan did it, to be glorified for all eternity for her bravery.  This movie came under some flack for some overdramatics and a bit of choppy story flow, but it fleshed out Joan for who she really was and how she was used as well as abused by the higher powers of heaven and earth.

Milla Jovovich plays Joan, a simple, illiterate peasent girl who came from a farming town in Lorrain, France out of no where.  In this movie, often ignored by other biographies or cinematic undertakings, we see how she was affected by the toils of war when her sister is murdered by English soldiers.  We also see how with a child's innocence she loves God and wants nothing but to find joy within going to mass and prayer.  Perhaps it is because of these reasons that she has her first visions as a young girl, innocent of the outside world and looking to the church for answers.  At age 19, she leaves her hometown to see the Daulphaine of France, played with the dignity and hauting ability that only John Malcovich can portray.  She seeks an audience with him to tell him that she has been chosen by God to lead his army against the English in the 100 Years War and see him rightly crowned as the King of France.

It has often been debated why it was that Charles believed Joan, and this movie offers some insights to more practical reasons rather than a true miracle.  Heavily influenced by his mother in law, played with kind of a creepy, witchlike appeal by Faye Dunaway, Charles has always doubted himself.  There was always a question about his lineage and his right to rule.  There was also a myth about a maid from Lorrain that was sent by God to lead France into victory.  She says it is what simple people believe; and, what the simple people believe is what will give him strength and power.  Also, according to myth and legend, when Joan was presented in the court to Charles, he had an impostor sit upon his throne.  If the maid Joan was truly of God, then she would pick him out of a crowd as the true Dauphaine.  Sure enough, Joan chooses correctly.  Joan and Charles would retreat into another room for a private conversation that only the two of them would witness.  Charles would emerge, according to witnesses, excited and amazed.  Did Joan perform a miracle?  Rather, Joan reassures him that she believed enough in him that he should be the true king of France.  Joan is given her army, and they would march onto victory.

The tide quickly turns for Joan after Charles is crowned.  The church as well as the crown are fearful of the power Joan has over the people and her inflating ego.  What would she attempt next?  They begin to clamp down on her, and as her next war attempts would result in a disasterous failure, she is jailed and found guilty of being a heratic.  Joan is burned at the stake for her crimes.  Some say that her heart, as it was pure, did not burn.  Hundreds of years later, she was canonized as a saint.

What is the morale of the story?  There are hundreds if not thousands of morales.  Perhaps the most telling of situations is when Joan, in her final days behind bars, is confronted by Dustin Hoffman, her own doubts.  He asks her what her sins have been and how she got into this place.  Her sins were pride and vanity.  Maybe she didn't really hear the voice of God.  Maybe she was just a nutcase who happened to be in the right place at the right time.  Maybe she was the fall guy for a botched military movement, a weak king, or a patriarchal society.  Whatever the reason, Joan was a hero.",1185408000,3,3756,4.358789625360231

Throughout her life, Joan of Arc was haunted by ""visions from God"" that lead her to believe that she had the religious power to force Englands Army to surrender territory in France rather than face the rath of God.  Mila Jovovich does a spectacular job at playing an unbelievable role of a young lady leading a powerful army.

Dustin Hoffman is introduced as her conscience in the later half of the movie - and is haunting!  In addition, I believe that this movie does a great job at demonstrating how religion was ""Feared"" during this period of history!

Profundity is not only political gibberish diplomatic slang. And it is that kind of language that reduces the attitude of the French king to be and then king to opportunism. And it is that kind of language that reduces the attitude of bishop Cochon to servile non-commitment. And it is that kind of language that reduces the attitude of the English to vengeful cruelty. It is also very superficial to reduce simple people to blind believers of anything that sounds iffy, godlike and slightly insane, like a girl leading an army or hearing and listening to divine voices. But all that must please many simple minds indeed. It is a shame because the subject deserves a serious film, a serious approach. Shakespeare forgot to write this play. He could have written a masterpiece on the subject. Besson just writes an average action film, some kind of medieval peplum film.

I usually try to be a bit more intelligent, but the first word that comes to mind when I think of this particular version is CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Historically innacurate, spiritually unfaithful, this film stinks.  It is downright heretical, portraying our beloved Jeanne as having made a pact with the devil.  She is shown as a proud, haughty girl at odds with her Church.  What a bunch of bull.

In my opinion, I don't believe in that. I don't think she ended up being psychotic. I didn't get the feeling of a hero. I have read reviews and documents about her and she seemed to be very confident, so I am not sure if she was portrayed correctly in the end. I would have liked the director to portray her as the hero she was. It's ok to leave the audience with the question, was she a hero or not, and it's ok to let her question herself in the film, but she should've believed in the purpose of God in the end. That's a true hero and saint. I guess it's all about what you believe and I think that she died knowing that GOD actually used her, but I know that most people would be afraid to die because of your belief. I am just sorry she had to be burned at a such a young age. How sad and frieghtening. If you haven't seen the movie yet, judge for yourself, but I don't think this movie had a great ending.

16596,3,0767839129,"If you are wondering about Luc Besson's vaguely heretical ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"", try to imagine a cross between ""Excalibur"" and ""Heaven's Gate"". It looks great but the basic story gets lost in the histrionics and excess.

There really was a very religious young girl who was considered a savior to France during The Hundred Years War. Although things may have eventually sorted themselves out the same way without her. Three years after her birth, the new tactics of the English archers were responsible for arguably the most one-sided battle in military history at Agincourt. The result was credited to Henry V's piety and he got a great passage in Shakespeare. The French aristocracy was almost wiped out by the battle and the English became solidly entrenched in France. Fourteen years later a new generation of French nobility was beginning to assert itself and it was the English and their French allies who were having leadership problems.

Both countries were Catholic at the time and both claimed that God was on their side, a bit like the football player who thanks God for the victory over another team that apparently God did not favor.

Although there are records of both of Joan's trials (her Condemnation Trial and her Rehabilitation Trial) both proceedings had their own political agenda and should be taken with a grain of salt. Besson's film seems to follow the generally accepted version of the story but takes obvious liberties with Joan's mental condition and visions. There is no way to prove or disprove any of this so it is probably as plausible as any other speculation.

What hurts ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"" is that Besson's best scenes are at the very beginning and set too high a standard for the remainder of the film. Jane Valentine is wonderful as the young Joan and Besson shows that his directing skills with young actors was not confined to Natalie Portman's performance in ""Leon"". This early stuff features some of the most interesting scene juxtaposition that you are likely to see in any film. IMHO it gets off to a better start than any film in cinema history.  And the sequence where the young Joan is standing on a hill watching as the English burn her village is as visually stunning as anything ever filmed.

But once Milla Jovovich's grown-up Joan takes over most viewers will find it difficult to stay focused on the story. It's not miscasting, Jovovich is noted for aggressive and daring performances (see ""The Dummy"") rather than subtlety and nuance, making her a good fit for the take Besson wanted on Joan's personality. The problem is that while a viewer could identify with the young Joan, the older Joan is just repellent. Her story should be inspirational and tragic. Instead it is a bunch of comic book battle scenes and comical melodrama.

But it is worth watching for the production design and the beginning sequences.

I remember when I first saw it in the hotel room I stayed at in Asheville, North Carolina. I was astounded. Everything about the movie was good. The battle scenes, for one, were good. Not as good as Braveheart, but they were all right. I love good music in a movie as well. The Messenger's was good. Excellent actors and actresses to play the parts. You couldn't help but like Joan's colleagues in war. Especially the big guy whom Joan always reprimanded for swearing. But there were some things that I wasn't too happy about. Now I knew that Dustin Hoffman's ""The Conscience"" was either an evil spirit or the devil himself, but I'm still leery about the boy who grew up to look like Jesus. I wasn't sure whether he was a good spirit or a bad one. Also, I didn't like the fact that Saint Michael didn't appear to Joan. Although, Saint.....I forget. And I'm Catholic. Anyways, that saint did appear to her in the chapel. She broke through the glass and revealed herself. And lastly, the portrayal of Joan as being mentally ill. It was kinda cool in the fact that you got to see the psyche of Joan, but Besson probably has her turning in her grave right now.

16598,5,0767839129,"After years of constant war between the Kingdoms of France and England, King Charles the VI of France is declared mentally insane. His wife,queen Isabeau of Baviere, signed the shameful treaty of Troyes which pretty much gave all of nothern France to the English. The city of Orleans was the limit of what was left of the French Kingdom. The dauphin (prince)Charles was waiting for a miracle in order to reconquer his father's kingdom. He was supported by Yolande of Aragon, his mother in law(supremely played by Faye Dunaway) who pretty much managed to keep what was left of France together.
The movie is visually stunning, the costumes and locations are utterly fantastic and accurate. MiLLa Jovovich plays the passionate young peasent girl who claims to be sent by god to fight the English in order to crown the dauphin as Charles VII at Reims cathedral. Some people claim her acting was exagerated and well over the top, but how could a simple peasent woman make herself noticed and obeyed in a time when women were considered to be souless and second class human beings? yes, Joan had to scream, yell and act like a fanatic in order  to be heard. Otherwise she would have been morally crushed by all the sceptic army men around her.
This is also very historically accurate and well researched,inspite of a few elements (Joan did know how to sign her own name for instance) Everything, including some of her own words is reproduced on screen.""Better today than tomorow"" was said by Joan many, many times.
This film doesn't seek to give the audience a determined opinion of Joan. We don't know whether she is crazy or not. The way she acted makes us doubt if the voices she claimed to have heard were actually God's. The truth is that she ""brought back the fire in the French army""  to quote Yolande of Aragon, and she crowned the dauphin as Charles the VII. Her downfall was dramatic and touching, but she remains a big inspiration for everyone in the world who wants to change things for the good. France won the 100 years war and joan was declared a saint.

A sword didn't appear out of nowhere. Joan didn't have some weird conscience friend questioning her. And in reality, Joan was articulate and compelling.

The truth about Joan of Arc is not found in this film or in Psychology Today. ITS FOUND IN THE HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS, THE TRIAL TRANSCRIPTS.

And while Joan was human and not a plaster saint, many testified at her trial about her compassion, her courage and her sincere faith.

To quote from Ron Maxwell's review:

""She came to be a liberator at the head of armies because she earned their trust, because she was self-less, she was viscerally connected with her people, she was authentic, she was faithful and she was loving -- immensely loving. That is partly an understanding of her power -- the power to rally soldiers, inspire the common people, win over princes and prelates, and the power to endure in our hearts over the centuries. All else is mystery. The inability to distinguish between what is historical and what is mysterious, compounded by the inadequacy in rigorously pursuing either choice, is the failure of this motion picture.""

An illiterate Extremely beautiful peasant girl (milla Jovovich), hearing voices of god at the age of 13, convinces the dauphin of France, who lost half of his country, about to lose the other half, and not able to become king in the present situation, to give her an army so she leads France to victory. Amazingly she succeeds; Joan changes history and leads the French army for 2 years. The English, faced with a feared lunatic leader, loose the first battle and retreat from the other. The dauphin is crowned King of France.

Happy with his crown, the king wants to negotiate with The English, while Paris is starving and under siege. Joan is not convinced and wants an army to liberate Paris.
To get rid of her, he leads her to a trap where she gets caught by the English soldiers.

Joan of Arc is burned at the stake for heresy only to be glorified 500 years later as a legendary icon. The irony in our world.

16603,2,0767839129,"Throughout the years, the story of Joan of Arc has stimulated the production of several motion pictures. Her life, actions and words have inspired and intrigued for more than five hundred years. From a historical standpoint, it is unfortunate that we do not know enough about Joan of Arc's life to fully understand who she was and what she did. While what she accomplished cannot be denied, and her recorded letters, speeches and trial manuscripts form a profile, much of what we know of Joan comes from eyewitness accounts and the memoirs of those around her. Due to these historical obstacles, writers and cinema directors will always have room for individual interpretation when relating her tale.

In 1999 ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"" was released in theatres as a full length feature film. Director Luc Besson's intention with the film was to accentuate the fact that we cannot prove what her visions were or from whence they came, and in doing so cast doubt on Joan's legend. Unfortunately, while depicting Joan as a schizophrenic, hesitant self doubter, he also made some glaring historical mistakes.

The first inaccuracy occurs at the very start of the movie. While Joan's village is being sacked by the English, she is hiding in a closet, watching her sister being killed and having her corpse raped. Admittedly, this does assist in creating the image of Joan as a traumatized nut-job, however, her sister was certainly never murdered or raped.

Secondly, the movie fails to accurately present Joan's wound received at Orleans. It makes no mention of her specifically foretelling her being shot with an arrow between her ""left neck and shoulder"", during that specific battle. More importantly, in the movie, Joan passes out from the wound and awakens the next morning. In reality, Joan was treated and returned to rejuvenate and lead the French soldiers in a final attack, which resulted in the victory.

Perhaps the most disturbing errors occur during Joan's trial, shortly before her execution. This is the best documented and most historically evident portion of Joan's life. Meticulous minutes were kept recording every spoken word, and most of the trying members wrote notes concerning the atmosphere of the room and Joan's demeanor and reactions to the questions. Joan was given a wooden bench to sit on and always remained fully chained. Throughout the trial, Joan remained courageous and absolutely steadfast in her faith and beliefs, confidently answering fully any questions asked of her, excepting those which she believed God to have forbid her to. In the movie, she is standing, and only chained at the wrists. In addition, she is stuttering and unconfident, not sure of herself. She is shown to not only begin to doubt what she had done and lose faith, it is also intimated that she did kill during the battles, which is untrue.

While whether or not the viewer will enjoy this movie is probably based on their beliefs as to whom Joan of Arc was as a person, which is relatively subjective, the historical mistakes are unforgivable. This movie fails to paint an accurate or truthful picture of Joan because of these misconstrued facts, which stem wholly from the creators apparent need to vilify and lay suspicion on her.

The DVD does get 2 stars (instead of 1) because it was in fact shot well, with decent special effects and good cinematography. Also, Joan of Arc material is limited and for the most part inaccurate, so this movie is just as good as any.",1135123200,7,3496,4.926994906621392

16615,5,0767839129,"Having first seen Milla as the stoner chick in Dazed and Confused, I was mightily impressed with her powerful performance in this beautifully made Art Movie - and that's what it is.

I totally accept the many valid points about the sketchy casting of certain figures and groups, and even some bending of history, but the movie just has a power of its own, and despite certain shortcomings, I would highly recommend it.

The graphic approach to the violence of hand-to-hand combat reminded me of Kenneth Brannagh's stunning interpretation of Shakespeare's Henry V, and Besson's Joan definitely has the same Classic feel to it.

Being a top model, I suspect that Milla Jovovich has experienced the same kind of jealousy-based animosity towards her multi-faceted talent (she was also stunning in the Bruce Willis classic The Fifth Element) as David Bowie has. Despite many excellent film performances, especially his superb role in Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, David has also drawn fire from people who seem unwilling to acknowledge that he is also a fine actor as well as a brilliant singer-songwriter.

Milla Jovovich portrays a reluctant Warrior Woman who clearly had some kind of ongoing psychic experiences, and who was traumatized by male brutality at an early age. Whether she had a sister or not, she saw other females being raped and killed, as did Queen Boadicea, who was herself raped, along with her daughters.

Boadicea made the Romans pay for their brutality, just as Joan of Arc made the English pay for theirs. Neither woman would have been like the simpering milk-toast versions of Joan that we have seen elsewhere. They would have been almost psychotic and able to rouse thousands of male warriors with their fire alone.

To me, Milla Jovovich played the part flawlessly.",1129593600,7,1787,5.02027027027027
16616,2,0767839129,"In the opening scene a thirteen-year-old Joan of Arc witnesses English soldiers burning her village and raping and murdering her sister.  This much is true: the real Joan of Arc's village was pillaged when she was thirteen.  She never had a sister.  The villagers took refuge in a nearby castle.  Those invaders weren't English and were probably about thirty years younger than the actors chosen for the scene.

Nearly all of the principal roles in this film are miscast.  The historical Joan of Arc was seventeen years old and not very pretty.  King Charles VII was twenty-six.  Most of the leading soldiers were around the same age.  Decades of war and disease had decimated the older generation.

This film consistently begs the question of how its unstable heroine ever rose to power, depicts her as the bewildered observer of her own success, and portrays king Charles VII as the thoroughly unworthy object of her devotion.  Don't look here for subtle characterizations.  Factions line up from the moment they meet Joan of Arc and wait for the chance to act (which, given the story's repeated assertions about her insignificance, is pretty odd).

Historically accurate details make their appearance in awkward and disruptive ways.  Older biopics about Joan of Arc generally had sanitized violence and bloodless battles.  This film is gruesome in all the wrong ways.  It is also true that some fifteenth-century hedonists liked to eat dinner in a bathtub built for two.  No record suggests Charles VII ever did this - he was actually known for his piety - and the film's decision to plop him into one seems based on the assumption that John Malkovich needs props to be sufficiently creepy.

The Messenger isn't exactly an anti-historical film.  Many of its story and character elements have respectable pedigrees.  Some twentieth-century scholars treat Joan of Arc as more of a psychological case study than a political or military leader.  I doubt it was the filmmakers' intention to discredit these theories by dramatizing how unsatisfactory they are as narrative, but in this respect at least The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc succeeds.",1129420800,2,2149,5.031161473087819
16617,5,0767839129,"Director Luc Besson has blessed us with, how shall I say it, a very different interpretation of the legendary French warrior/saint, Joan of Arc. This Joan is not the confident and serene Joan we have seen in other films, or may have read about in books. Besson's Joan is frenetic and unstable, she rambles on, shakes incessantly, appears often times confused and is subject to unexpected bursts of rage. Not exactly traits that would inspire either religious fervor or courage in battle.

As a child Joan is portrayed as a obsessive compulsive loner who goes to confession two or three times a day. A child who hears voices and sees dark, disturbing visions of war, bloodshed and savages beasts feeding on human carnage. No cute, chubby angels or beautiful Madonna's for this kid. A child so obsessed with being with Christ, she sneaks into the church santuary at night, fills the holy chalice with wine and drinks it down reciting, ""I want to be at one with you NOW!"" Seeing that fragile little girl standing before the altar with her face and blouse covered with red wine is not only unnerving but vampiric in effect.

This is a savage, sometimes barbaric film that uncompromisingly exposes spirituality and warfare in a manner that most of us are unwilling to accept. Dark, haunting, deeply mystical and overtly shamanic in content, 'The Messenger' is a masterpiece waiting to be understood by those open to new artisitic interpretations and diverse interior vistas within the mystical life and calling of a great saint.

Most definitely not a film for those in search of sanitized mainstream inspirational entertainment and definitely not suitable for young children. However if you're ready and curious enough to look deeply into the spiritual abyss you might be able to catch a fleeting glimpse of the terror and horror that awaits on the Otherside.

Postscript: Most people with a passing familiarity of the Christian faith have heard the verse exhorting us to work out our faith with ""Fear and Trembling."" That wasn't meant to be understood as a metaphor.",1128902400,30,2063,4.936599423631124
16618,4,0767839129,"Divine Message or Hysterical Delusion?

It is 1425, and France is a corpse-strewn battlefield. Since 1337 the land has been ravaged by the Hundred Years War between the English, the French, and fickle barons and dukes willing to shift their loyalties for gold, titles, and land in Perfidious Albion, north of the icy Channel. English soldiers, brigands, and madmen roam the countryside, burning, looting and pillaging everything in their path.

It is a time of frenzy; it is a time of ecstatic vision.

It is a time in which the messianic Joan la Pucelle, later known to history and fate as Joan of Arc (played in wide-eyed wonder by the gorgeous Milla Jovovich), emerged, born into an ensanguined world and bearing the word of God Himself on her lips to the future King of France, the hapless Dauphin Charles.

It is this fiery, faith-driven, brink-of-madness world which Luc Besson attempts to conjure up in the uneven ""The Messenger"", which shares a little of the fevered madness of its wild-eyed heroine.

What is the true nature of the Divine? How does He talk to His servants? How do you know the voice of God is really the voice of God---and not something else, something malignant, the voice of a demon or possibly madness? To his credit, Besson plunges deep into this dilemma, and the opening sequences in which Joan's young visions come heralded by unearthly winds and a vision of a glowering, leering (and ultimately aging, decrepit, and senescent) Christ are unsettling and horrible, suggesting that the source of her zeal may not be divine in nature.

Besson has always had a flair for visual artistry, and ""The Messenger"" is no exception. The imagery, assisted by veteran cinematographer Thierry Arboghast (who worked with Besson on ""The 5th Element"" and also served as Director of Photography for the lush ""Ridicule), is rich, striking, captures the feel of the 15th century battlefield, and throws the viewer into battlefields and siege trenches fertilized with gore and muddy pastures turned into rancid abattoirs with the blood of the dead.

The battle sequences are handsomely mounted, vivid, compelling, and brutal, particularly the Siege of Orleans. A sequence introduced by a shot from a trebuchet (a piece of medieval siege artillery) is at once remarkably faithful and dramatically awe-inspiring.

Fashion model Milla Jovovich does a fine job with a challenging role, and makes ""The Messenger"" her movie; her expressive face says more with a glance or a turn of the mouth than lesser actresses could with 100 pages of dialogue.

John Malkovich is at his purring, brooding best as the Dauphin; Faye Dunaway brings history to life as the devious Yolande D'Aragon; Tcheky Karyo provides the heavy weapons support and uniformly stolid jawline as the phlegmatic, doubting, faithful Dunois; Vincent Cassel seems to be having the time of his life as the laughing Gilles de Rais; and Dustin Hoffman has a shadowy, skulking, gloriously contemporary little part in tempting, tormenting, and confusing Joan.

For all of its pageantry and scope, this is a decidedly intimate little film that has far more to say about the nature of Faith and Things Larger than Oneself than it does, necessarily, about the historically enigmatic and ambiguous St. Joan.

This ultimately makes Besson's sins (all those of excess, the very best kind) forgivable, because this final inquisition between Joan and her hooded tormentor makes the film so much more accessible to all us, beset as we are by our fears and doubts.

The final question, once all the fire and blood and plunder and ruin of ""The Messenger"" succumb to night and silence, is this: do we hear the voice of God because we finally allow ourselves to listen---or because we so desperately want to hear?

The reality of this is that you are viewing an opinion piece on the Joan mythos. What the writers and director are trying to achieve is not accuracy, but rather allegory.

As for an opinion on this work: It does not meet its potential until the third act, the trial. The questions raised in this a perfectly fit for a modern French audience. One can not, but laugh at the way Modern Christian Doctrines are lobbed at medieval problems.

Most reviews state that historical accuracy had been distorted, (granted the rape scene has no historical backing, and that King Charles was actually much younger than portrayed) but to imply that Joan of Arc had easily accomplished her god sent tasks would be not only a distortion of historical accuracy but also a discredit to all of her feats, it would be foolish to say that she hadn't been affected by the stress of war, not being a formal military leader and relying on her faith to bring her to victory.

  I found Dustin Hoffman's performance to be nothing short of accurate in the terms of Joan's conscience and possibly the devil himself. The movie's bleak ending seems in my opinion to be plausible, when considering that her Army believed in her and did not question that she had been sent messages from god. It was only after her capture by the English that in her dark cell she began to question herself. And who wouldn't? It was the first time she had been so scrutinized. Nobody ever went into war believing that he/she was in wrong doing, and after her capture while on trial (if you can call it that) she was being questioned and after blindly following her beliefs into battle she no longer has support.

The year is 1420.  The English and the French are vying for control over France, with the French being at their lowest point yet; the heir apparent (the Dauphin) is bankrupt, the French are divided and some factions support the English side, militarily they are on the defensive and are losing, while Paris, Orleans, Reims and other cities of importance are in the hands of the English.  It is at this critical moment of desperation and vulnerability that Joan of Arc appears to rally the French behind her banner and the ""Word of God,"" in an effort to send the English ""back to their island.""

Milla Jovovich and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well!  The only setback is in relation to the parts where she, yet again, finds herself trembling/twitching/hurting/screaming etc.  Have mercy on us please... Can we have a movie with Milla Jovovich not acting like that (i.e. EXACTLY as she does in the Fifth Element, and in the two Resident Evil movies)?  Is that too much too ask???

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!  Consequently, they have done a superb job of providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.

The movie is action packed, while the plot, the setting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the battle sequences are all excellent.

The story of Joan of Arc (or Jeanne d'Arc as they call her in France) is well known just about everywhere. Joan is a poor peasant living in a small village in France during the Hundred Years War with England. She begins seeing heavenly visions that tell her she is God's messenger to rid her country of the bloody English. Somehow she convinces Charles, the Dauphin with visions of being king, to give her an army to storm Orleans. Using unconventional methods she leads her army to victory. The Dauphin is crowned king and mostly forgets about Joan. She leads an unsuccessful siege on Paris is given over to the English, tried and burned at the stake, several hundred years later she is sainted by the Catholic church. The Messenger covers most of this relatively faithfully, and beautifully.

Luc Besson is a talented director filming such classics as Le Femme Nikita and The Professional. His talent is presented here in his ability to create interesting and beautiful shots, but is lost in creating a cohesive story. He doesn't seem to know what to do with the story about the young saint. In parts it seems earnest in it's recreation of this revolutionary with heavenly visions, but then it sinks into near parody of itself and in the ends sinks towards a reinventing of the events themselves asking Joan herself whether or not her visions were real or mere psychosis.

Milla Jovovich is a pretty face who has mostly been in forgettable, silly comedies and the Resident Evil franchise which might as well be considered a silly comedy for all its worth. Here, she has two modes of acting, a strange amphetamine delivery of her lines as if she couldn't spit them out fast enough, or a snarled scream as if acting was merely being the loudest person on the set. It is not a nuanced performance. For the entirety of the film she seems completely out of place.

The battle or Orleans is tame at best. There are virtually no scenes of real ambitious spectacle. We are given nothing to inform us of her revolutionary forms of combat. Instead her method seems to be screaming a lot and jumping a horse over the enemies fence. Later the storming of Paris is so humorous it is sad. Joan screams and screams that she needs back up while a few soldiers randomly knock on what must be the Paris gates. These soldiers are so bewildered a pathetic looking they seem more out of a Monty Python sketch than a serious film about war.

Beyond the visual elements the only saving grace is Dustin Hoffman's performance as the Grand Inquisitor or Conscience. It is a fine performance from a fine actor, but it is a peculiar character. He spends his time questioning Joan's own sanity. Could her visions in fact be some form of psychosis or fantasy? Could crucial moments in her life like finding a sword in a field in fact be simple coincidence? Good questions in the history of the real Joan of Arc, but they seem out of place here. Nowhere in the film are we led to believe Joan is nothing but the real thing. Why bring these questions into play during its climactic ending. The film would have worked much better believing whole heartedly in Joan's purpose and vision. Or questioning her visions from the beginning, a revisioning of the myth could be very interesting. Instead it kicks its legs out from under itself by bringing her into question so late in the film.

What we get in this portrayal of Joan of Arc is some pretty visuals and a find performance from Dustin Hoffman. Try renting one of Luc Besson's earlier films and pick up anything from Hoffman's hey day in the 70's, they will be worth your dollar and your time far more than anything thing to be found here.

Milla Jovovich simply doesn't have the acting ability to pull this role off, plain and simple.  She portrays Joan as a wild-eyed nut case and somehow it's hard to generate much sympathy for her in the end.  Add to that the ridiculous dialogue (somehow I can't see 13th century people using the 21st century expression ""whatever!"") and you have a mess of a movie.

Although he presented an original angle in showing her to be less than heavenly inspired, Besson has seriously and uneffectively distorted several documented facts about Joan of Arc. This is rendered worse by a bad script and questionable acting.

All historical accounts suggest that Joan of Arc was soberly persistent in her pleas for the Dauphin to give her an army but she was never the delusional psychotic as shown in the movie. Her visions were inspired by the Saints and not by Christ Himself. All accounts are conclusive in that Joan of Arc was leading as a symbol of inspiration to the army and never once raised a weapon against the enemy: she never shed any blood. Finally, Joan of Arc never reneged her faith or retracted her statements about her divine mission: that's why she was put on the stake.

The film is unique in showing Joan of Arc more as the political puppet that she was in real life and how she became a liability after the crowning of the Dauphin in Orleans. The film also shows Joan as a person suffering from a dissociative disorder rather than being a divine messenger. John Malcovich and Faye Dunaway play their roles well as the Dauphin and the Regent Queen. Mila Jojovich is the worst performance in the film and, with her being the main character, the quality of the whole film is reduced to below average.

16639,1,0767839129,"This unsightly contribution in Milla Jojovich's career proves quite well that, aside from looking breathless, panting and screaming, the actress cannot tackle a serious acting challenge.
A true mockery of Joan of Arc, this film conspires to make the Poucelle D'Orleans seem like a deranged woman incapable of controlling an army-- whereas the historical Joan of Arc showed an eerie capacity for military manoeuvres, whose fame became to widespread that entire cities surrendered at the mention of Joan of Arc at their gates.
Through her (dictated) letters (for she was presumably illiterate), and her recorded answers to the Inquistion, we have come to know that Joan of Arc, born in Domremy, was an unusually lucid 16-year-old (she was burned at the stake at the age of 19) with a gift for words (which may give credibility that she was actually related to the Dauphin through the bloodline of Anne the Adultress and thus must have received some degree of education), as well as sharing the distinction of being the middle age's most distinguished transvestite (sharing the same historical period as the Basque transvestite and noblewoman Catalina de Erauzo, the Lieutenant Nun).
Milla Jojovich's portrayal of Joan of Arc is insulting to anyone that has ever studied this remarkable character, giving us instead a histrionic and half-mad woman who cannot keep her composture for a second and who apparently has the resolution of a twig, fueled into battle by unknown fervors that vanish as soon as the battle scene is over. Joan of Arc was a hard and somewhat fanatical Christian, but in no way was she the blithering idiot that Jojovich's acting makes her out to be. There is also a scene of ""self-examination"" during Joan's captivity with the Burgundians that serves little point other than to stress the idea that Joan is absolutely nuts. Indeed, all the Damsel of Orleans does through half the movie is to claw and hyperventilate... truly a shameful performance, and abysmal script-writing.

1) The story of Joan of Arc is fascinating and this version is probably the most accurate that we'll ever get (since we have only sketchy information in the history books).
2) There is plenty of gritty battle action with blood and body parts flying.
3) The wide assortment of of medieval weapons used (catapaults, gravity cannon balls, multiple arrow shooters, boiling oil, maces, flails and decapitation devices) were more varied than any other movie. That alone makes this one a classic.
3) The movie explores Joan's later doubts about her voices/visions being from God very well. They use a imaginary devil's advocate character (played by Dustin Hoffman) to allow her to argue with herself. In the process, we're given a lot to think about ourselves.
Worst:
1) Milla Jovovich over-acted at times, especially when the camera was close to her face. That made her character a little scary. (Who knows, however, what the real Joan was like).
2) The only special feature is a very worthwhile 25-minute documentary about the actual historical events surrounding Joan of Arc's life. It would have been good to to have even more background information on this fairly complicated story.
Recommendation:
The low amount of special features is the only reason I don't give this DVD 5 stars. The movie itself is so rich that it requires repeated viewings to catch everything. Both men and women should find something to like in this epic.",1077062400,2,1434,4.954356846473029

The settings and costumes are decent, but that`s all there is to find here.
Director Luc Besson also made the useless ""The Fifth Element"", and the style-over-substance perspective of that movie is present here, too. This is just a bunch of random fight sequences and melodramatic moments that go nowhere and generate a messy cinematic experience. A lackluster movie and one to avoid.",1076544000,12,712,5.146551724137931

16644,5,0767839129,"Maybe this film is not historically accurate.  Then again, maybe it is closer to the real thing than most want to realize.  Like the life of Jesus, Joan's life is vague on the printed page, and Hollywood has had a history of its own trying to fill in the gaps.  No two films about her are alike.
So I guess it comes down to the viewer's faith, whether Joan was a saint or just a simple peasant girl who inspired a nation.
This film presents a more human approach to her story, and whether it is historically truthful is beside the point.  After all, this is a Hollywood film, not a documentary.  And as a Hollywood film, it works very well for me.  The look of the movie is stunning, and that alone should make it worth, at the very least, a one-time rental.  But the acting is so fine, with Milla Jovovich doing a superb job of creating a most difficult role.

The only justification for the two stars I gave it.
Then unfortuneately, Mila Jovanivich takes over as the grown up Joan of Arc.  A very unfortunate casting choice. She runs the gamut of acting emotions  ranging  from a to b.  She gawks in amazement and her eyes bulge with absolutely nothing underneath. She is unconvincing and annoying in this role.
To add to this, her hair color changes from scene to scene. One scene she is blonde then she is brunette. Is this to distract us from her acting? Is this a God given hair color change? Or is it a vision from  Clairol?

Faye Dunaway and John Malkovich give good performances but they are not in enough of the movie to save it. By the time Dustin Hoffman shows up at the end, who even cares?
 Aside from the great opening, the hole mishmash shows no insight into Joan of Arc.  After the fascinating opening--the ball is dropped and that is the director and lead actor's fault.  Lead a nation in battle? This woman can't lead a movie.

Everything I have seen or read about Joan of Arc, Jean d'Arc, was better than The Messenger.  Joan was a kind, wonderful person but this movie made her look like a maniac that should be put away.  Though I have to say Milla Jovovich played a wonderful crazy person.  Joan's visions weren't even correct.  In the movie she saw some man that looked like Jesus, while in life she saw Saints, such as St. Catherine.  The war scenes were gruesome, but I liked them; they were realistic.  Another thing wrong was how Joan found her sword.  She didn't find it in a meadow, as if someone dropped it there and she found it.  Her voices told her that the sword was in St. Catherine's temple around the alter, so she sent some of her men to the temple and they found it buried by the alter just as she said.  No one else knew it was there before.  I was so upset after watching this movie, because it didn't show the true Joan of Arc.

It's hard to believe that even the most religiously medieval French soldier would give this loon the time of day, let alone follow her into battle.
Mon Dieu! Run awaaaaaayy. . .
But I'll say this for the director, he's consistent. It's fast paced all the way through, what with boulders a la 'Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom ' getting hurled at the troops along with other JamesBondian gizmos making for cool technogore.
 Which, alongside Joan's motivation in this script ( Her sister's been raped by the posse of --er I mean the Brits) turns it all into an enjoyable comic book Western revengefest. It's 'The Quick and the Dead' minus gunslingers, set in 1429. Plus the scenes of her schizoid 'visions' are gorgeously photographed.
But as far as the real Joan of Arc, the only major historical figure whose life and thought has come down to us through sworn court testimony---Oh well, in the first place she's had writers of genius like Shaw and Twain to  balance this dramatization, and in the second place, as long as we're making films about protagonists who hear voices, wild battle scenes and trials for heresy it could have been much worse.

This is a true classic in the motion picture world and I recmend you by it and not the Joan of arc made for t.v. movie because I look at it this way if a movie is an epic film and it is 3 hours and rated R it will truely bring out more of the story to make it alot more understanding and greater in its aspect.

16666,1,0767839129,"I admit to seeing the made-for-television version of Joan of Arc before viewing this version. If it makes a difference, I also read Mark Twain's ""Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc"" that previous weekend, regardless of my dislike of Twain's writing style. I admit to thinking of this logical, honest, and energetic historical figure as one of the most fascinating in history. So, after viewing the scewed version called ""The Messenger"" I am perhaps too biased to speak.
  The Joan portrayed in ""The Messanger"" comes off as tempermental, insecure, and ultimately insane. This is not the Joan that is recorded in history as a kind and forgiving peasant who touched the hearts of thousands by loving them, and who never spoke ill of anyone. This is not the Joan that led fifty intelligent judges in circles of words by answering calmly, consistently, and logically all answers that were intended to lead her to the stake. This is not the Joan who claimed to hear the voices of saints who informed her of events long before they happen. No, this ""messenger"", in the midst of a cinematic mess, is a horrifying psychotic who doesnot possess the conviction that would make an army wake up let alone fight an imposible war.
  I did not like this movie. I leave you to make your own opinion, but consider that Joan of Arc was a seventeen-year-old peasant who claimed to hear heavenly voices, created a vast army and battle tactics that won back much of France, and was burned at the stake as a heretic before being declared a Saint. There are many interptretations of this historical figure, and although I am perhaps biased by my previous exposures, I don't feel that ""the messenger"" should be one of them.",1045526400,48,1701,4.755932203389831
16667,5,0767839129,"i'm sorry if my opinion is similar with others because i don't have time to read them i can not read English very well so reading them would take me too much time. (i don't do this [giving stars] since now) i've changed my opinion to this movie. There is someone who has their own belief and way to do things they think they can and must do. All other powerful people doubt and try to stop her but also expect her to do something different, useful and helpful. So it's really a hard work. I don't know why LucBesson think maybe a woman can do this work well, in this circomstances she have to pay high price at last. Maybe He's found a man has always two selves and both are strong. When the second(or actully the first) self let a woman getting pregnant, he's let himself get in troble, he can not just live with the sea and dolphins anymore. Other people maybe are just other people but your child is a part of you and if you choose not to care them, you will get guilty. So to a man other people have the ability to increase his sin. But to a woman, if she's lucky enough if she doesn't need to do things for her country if she's not living in India and some places, she has a chance to be and develop herself all the time. And she can choose to love God. In all places i ever saw God is a He. It's a good news for a woman. The best thing is ""he"" doesn't tempt you to increase your sin, so he's perfect and good for you. When we can just be ourselves we get some kind of power gradually. We can help ourselves and try to help other people. But we have to be modest to God, otherwise we will loss our powers. I basically like Milla Jovovich and her acting here very much, but it looks sometimes she wants some second level things from God and other people and forgets she deserves (always of course) the first level things, maybe she doesn't feel he is God but feel he is DH sometimes. We know what LB wants to express and it's enough. In The Fifth Element she's just born and now she has her belief and ability, but, still, it's a very difficult road if she don't have BW to help her. But we can not find a perfect man like BW in this world. So we actually need a stronger belief of God, then he will get along with you anytime.",1045440000,2,2231,4.061224489795919

Although Besson's film, ""Le femme Nikita,"" is one of my top five favorites, he failed here; and I fail to call myself his fan.
Here are the problems:
La pucelle was NEVER raped.
Jehanne was compassionate towards English soldiers, peasants, etc
She was not insane, schizoid, or mentally ill in any way.
She was very eloquent and could debate with the most learned men.
The dialogue represents the 20th C.
Weapons are wrong.
Technical work is second-rate.
Even the hair colour was wrong (she had black hair).
Besson uses La Pucelle as a vehicle for self-aggrandizement, and it was a poor attempt at that.",1043452800,37,790,4.65
16669,5,0767839129,"""The Messenger"" may be my all-time favorite film.  It got terrible reviews in the U.S., and was poorly received by the American public.  It garnered rave reviews in France, the newspaper Liberation calling it Luc Besson's finest film.  This despite its portrayal of an iconic figure in French history as a schizophrenic unguided missile.  And apparently in Iceland it's the number 7 bestseller, according to Amazon.com
So what gives?
First, this is not a religious picture.  If you want the life of a saint, do not see this film.  If you want a conventional take on the story of Joan of Arc, do not see this film.  There have been plenty of other movies made about the Maid of Orleans that tell the conventional story of the hero / saint.
Besson's film takes a secular, intensely psychological approach.  He treats Jeanne as tragic figure. She is manic, driven, restless, profoundly unhappy.  A fascinating character. She is an outsider; her companions in arms come to have tremendous respect for her, they are devoted to her, but they do not understand her.  She does not understand herself.  And therin lies the tragedy.
This film is unconventional in its treatment of an overly-conventionalized subject.  The dialogue is modern, there is no attempt to make it sound like ye olde medieval speech.  Dustin Hoffman, appearing in the last part of the movie, plays her consicence, her Freudian confessor.  Guilt and confession play a major part in this film.  It is not the story of a plaster saint.",1041292800,5,1497,4.861660079051384

I have been vastly entertained by director Luc Besson's work in the past, but this film is a plodding, gore-drenched nod toward Mel Gibson's vastly superior ""Braveheart."" ""The Messenger"" completely lacks all of the finer emotions that make an epic story compelling, despite the true nature of the people and some of the events. ""The Messenger"" also revels in its violence and grit, rather than trying to create something realistic (and more convincing). Milla Jovovich turns in an annoying performance as the shrieking saint, who does not inspire her troops so much as berate them in her holier-than-thou manner. The film's topics are interesting (was Joan really a saint who could speak to God, or was she just insane and driven by rage?), but the execution is poor. On top of this, the scripting and dialogue is just plain bad. If you want an epic, I suggest looking elsewhere.

16682,4,0767839129,"Milla Jovovich is astonishingly good in her performance as Joan of Arc. The supporting cast is excellent as well.  Cinematography, sets, costumes are all perfection. Mystical sequences are suitably bewildering...are they from the mouth of God or madness? The seemingly endless battle scenes, the thick dark brutality of 15th century warfare, the ruthless machinations of power and betrayal are filmed mercilessly to great effect. The blunt, relentless savagery bludgeons us as we are plunged ferociously into the fray, urged on by a frenzied, schrieking berserker with an angel's face. Regardless of whether you prefer to see Joan's story as myth or history or a combination of the two, this film is a powerful depiction of the mayhem and miracles of martyrdom that can occur when an individual's voice of conscience and reason are lost in the blast of an angry god's screams of retribution. Whether manufactured by religion, manipulated by the state, morphed from some secret personal madness, ""holy war"" has never been the work of the Creative and Loving Spirit that moves the Universe. Suffering and the horrors of war come from people. I didn't see this film when it was in the theatres, but saw it on VHS three years later.  It stikes me that the people behind the 9/11 tragedy, the people who clamored for the death penalty the moment the D.C. snipers were caught, the kamikaze pilots of World War II, and all those down through history who call upon death with a righteous voice have a little of Joan of Arc within them. Who spoke to Joan...the God or the Satan of her religion? Or were the voices from the deep well of her own psyche twisted and turned about by the times in which she lived? Can it be that Bin Laden and Joan of Arc are cut from the same cloth? When will it end? When will it ever end?

16683,5,0767839129,"Based on the polarity of reviews here, I knew this was a film that would leave a strong impression.  I land on the very positive side.  This is a fascinating film- gorgeous in its settings and costumes, powerful in its depiction of medieval war, and profound in its exploration of the life of a paradoxical heroine.
Milla Jovovich's take on Joan is an intriguing blend of shy farm girl, zealot, religious fanatic, saint, and tormented soul.  There is some interesting casting here: Dustin Hoffmann is appropriately eerie as God/Satan/Joan's conscience/Joan's subconscious; John Malkovich, although perhaps a bit too old (the Dauphin/King was only about 9 years older than Joan), is effectively petulant and ethics-free.  Faye Dunaway looks absolutely horrid, thanks in part to the bizarre attire and hair style of the time, and in part to really, really bad plastic surgery.  A large supporting cast demonstrates the extremes that Joan provoked: loyalty, hatred, fear, and adulation.
The criticism for the film's lack of historical accuracy makes me laugh.  Some reviewers fervently deride some of the films events, as if they were witnesses to the historical reality.  These events happened almost 600 years ago.  Much of the ""facts"" about Joan's life come from testimony twenty years after her death, when her family was trying to reverse the guilty verdict.  Joan was already a legend, and the testimony of her reality was certainly already tinged by her fame.
If you want a 100 percent historically accurate version of the life of Jehanne Darc, find a time machine and head back to Domremy, France, January 6, 1412 (or thereabouts-the exact year of her birth is not known).  If you want a film that vividly and passionately tells a tale of a mythical legend, buy The Messenger.",1032825600,26,1781,5.047781569965871
16684,3,0767839129,"Yes, Jovovich is a great actress. Yes, the battle scences give a good impression of what war was like back then. But the story is LOOSELY based on Joan of Arc's true story, and the truth here is better than fiction. So many errors and additions to the true story, that the title should be renamed. This is not the story of Joan of Arc. I would rate it higher if it did not pretend to be the story of Joan of Arc, as Jovovich really does some powerful acting, even if the script was wrong, and the battle scenes will leave a lasting impression on your mind. But I was so disappointed otherwise. The version with Leelee Sobieski captured the story better, much better; it stilled conveyed the question whether Joan was dillusional or actually was a messenger of God without having to badly distort the real story. Leelee Sobieski, another great actress, was a much more believeable Joan of Arc. Jovovich played another character -- she played that other character well, but it wasn't Joan of Arc.",1032048000,,994,4.558659217877095
16685,1,0767839129,"I decided to intentionally not watch this movie on the big screen, after hearing reviews from several people. I then wasn't sure if I wanted see the movie at all, but I broke down and rented it anyway, as I am a big fan of Joan of Arc.
From the moment I read about her sister's rape on the cover, I knew I'd have a difficult time watching this movie, since that event never happened.  After watching the whole thing, I found that my initial impressions were correct.  This movie was just a movie, _not_ a historical documentary, which is something to definitely keep in mind.  It would've been nice if Besson had referenced the trial transcripts for a better idea of how Joan actually lived, but alas.
I (generously) give a rating of one star, only because this work has spread a little more awareness of the life and death of Joan of Arc.  I would also give this movie two enthusiastic thumbs down, except for the battle scenes, and Besson didn't even get all of those right, so a somewhat shaky one thumb up for the battle scenes. The reason for this rating is quite simple - Monty Python and the Holy Grail was much more historically accurate than easily at least half of this hellishly awful piece-of-... movie that rotted sea monkeys could've done better with.  It's much more entertaining, as well.
The beginning did not impress me at all.  I found the scrolling white text to be rather small, and I had to pause to read what was trying to be conveyed.  Also, Joan did not find her sword as it was portrayed in this movie.  (Why a small shepherdess would need a huge sword to tend sheep is still beyond me.)  I didn't really care for the hooked-on-drugs vision in the forest, either.
The scene in which Joan's sister was raped may have been appropriate if the event had actually happened.  I found it to be distasteful, especially as there were so many things in Joan's life that Besson could have chosen to emphasize.  The invention of a falsity to ""enhance"" an already miraculous story just strikes me as ridiculous.
The scene where Joan rushes in to drink from the communion chalice is not accurate at all.  Speaking as a Catholic liturgist, the Blood of Christ (communion wine after consecration) was and still is never stored in the tabernacle (where the extra consecrated bread goes after communion), which would have been locked anyway.  Joan also would not have had access to drinking the wine to begin with.  She was not full of manufactured rage, as Besson would like us to think.  Lisa Simpson from television's ""The Simpsons"" was more accurately portrayed, as far as young Joans go.  ""Who, me?  But I'm just a little girl!""
Joan also never said anything about God being angry with the English... the trial records clearly state that she didn't know if God was against the English, but he wanted them out of France.  The scene with the arrow in her chest was very touching, but she went straight back to the battle, and the battle was won that same day, NOT the next day as shown.  The more exciting storyline in this section lies in actual fact - how amazing!
I do like how Milla plays Jehanne, except for the unnecessary hysterics.  (I liked Milla in ""The Fifth Element"" and in ""Zoolander"", too.)  I also liked the concept of Dustin Hoffman's role.  This was a nice spin on things, along with the symbolic meaning of Joan's hair turning from lightness to darkness through the course of the movie.  I also liked how John Malkovich played Charles, and appreciated that Besson was accurate in the ""Find the Dauphin"" game.
History records Joan wearing male clothing during the trial, and with her head shaved for the burning.  The miter Joan wore on ""stake day"" was noticeably absent.  A cross was not held up as Joan's body burned; it was a crucifix (amazing what difference a little body makes).
I am now wondering about how many other things I've missed, since I was too bewildered at Besson's storytelling approach to write most of my thoughts down.  Factual accuracy aside, this movie could have been made into so much more.  It's highly disappointing, yet somewhat pretty to look at if you aren't aware of ""the real story"".

With that said, I have to say that this movie was very enjoyable and didn't seem to be that long, even though it was nearly 3 hours long.
Even though this may seem a little sexist and blatantly innacurate; I think they should not have cut Miila's hair. She was breathtaking with her orange-ish hair and very male looking with her bowl cut. The way I see it, if they were going to go the ""hollywoodz' route and ignore factual acceruacy then they should leave some eye candy in the movie.",1026518400,3,622,4.513274336283186

Luc Besson's interpretation of the legendary historical figure is visually impressive and the battle sequences are bloody and exciting.  Unfortunately, the story is muddled, the film is pretentious, and scenes meant to come across as deep sometimes come across as goofy and campy.  Good performances across the map, with Jovovich faring quite well in a rather maniacal portrayal.  Mostly middling material, with occasional excellence.

16694,1,0767839129,"I guess like most people who bought/rented this dvd, I am a huge fan of medieval flicks. Granted, most films set in this period are bereft of historical accuracy; Braveheart and Robin Hood Prince of Thieves being two obvious examples. But if the film is a genuine masterpiece then such concerns are - within reason - mere side-issues.
But this effort from luc besson is no masterpiece - not by any manner of means. The rot stems from Milla Jovovich's catastrophic portrayal of Joan of Arc. If I was French I'd be mortified at the  thought of seeing that nation's most revered heroine depicted as a screaching harpie. The character of Joan comes across as downright irritating and, quite frankly, ridiculous.
What vestige of credibility may have remained was scattered to the four winds in the scene when the English Army refused to fight the French with Joan as their general. After all, this is the same band of soldiers that brutally killed and raped a member of Joan's family only a few years before (apparently): is it really believable that the rantings of such a derranged brat could inspire so much confidence in her men  - and fear in the English - that she could lead the French to victory? Of course, this did actually happen, but in the context of this film its absurd.
..., you actually find yourself rooting for the English - hoping they put you out of your misery by burning the witch at the stake post-haste. This really shouldn't be the case, but it is.

16695,2,0767839129,"Having been somewhat fascinated by the life of Joan of Arc, and entertained by the French flair of Director Luc Besson's movies, it pains me to say that my disappointment in THE MESSENGER is most profound.  Truly, with such a promising opening scene and more than a couple of excellent actors at its disposal - not to mention a mythical and supernatural aura intertwined with an amazing history - one would expect, even at the very least, a little glimmer of brilliance.
Yet, apparently, it never was meant to be.  However, I must say, the movie opens promisingly enough:  There's the pious child, Joan d'Arc, living her bright yet humble life in the 15th century French countryside. - She is portrayed at once as being extraordinarily blessed and preternaturally enlightened, by Heaven.  There's Music of Angels singing ecstatic praise, Visions of Divine Power moving nature around her, and Voices of ""Him."" (Be it Deity, Angel, Archangel, or perhaps her own Subconscious Soul?  I cannot tell...) - All so enticing and gravitating her toward Heavenly bliss.
Yet it is within minutes of these glorious opening scenes that everything takes a very dark turn.  Suddenly, the child Joan sees the storm clouds culminate as the wolves and the English Army thunder in.  The sight of this is quite ominous -- not only for the child Joan, but for the entire course of the movie as well.  It's a shame - because, from here, THE MESSENGER actually could very well have become a movie of remarkable depth, voice and vision.
Instead, the whole thing engulfs itself in blustering failures - its own annihilation ignited with the first sight of Milla Jovovich as Joan, the peasant girl, suddenly all grown up.  She makes her first appearance having somehow made her way to the castle of Chinon with a message to the Dauphin Charles VII, France's heir to the crown.  The movie offers no explanation as to how this unknown teenage girl had come to be known as the ""Maid of Lorraine,"" nor of how she had made her way into the French Court.
Apart from various transitional errors and a stunning lack of continuity, this picture further bears the awesome burden of poor casting and an even poorer script.  John Malkovich (Dauphin Charles VII) did a fine enough job of it - however, the script, relative to the role, was not compatible with his talents - and he was very blatantly miscast.  As for Milla Jovovich:  Well, I cannot say much about that folly, actually, without blasting away all credibility to her as an actress.  Truly, that's something I really do not wish to do.  Really, I must say in her defense that it seems she was obliged to make do with a script that made her sound like a borderline psychotic and rebellious adolescent somewhat of the present-day variety.  It's impossible to buy the possibility that anyone in the French Army would even consider following her lead.
Sadly enough, the only reason I halfway speak in her defense is that she seemed to speak her lines as if she hated every single word of them - and her every look seemed to disdain the movie.  OK - Well, regardless, even for that, I guess I cannot in my heart of hearts give her any credit as an actress.
Finally, I must give no insignificant amount of credit to Dustin Hoffman (the Voice), Faye Dunaway (Mother-In-Law to the Dauphin, Princess d'Aragon), and Timothy West (Pierre Cauchon - a prominent figure in Joan's final trial) for making the most of a flippant and shallow script.
Finally, all the more I can say about this movie is that it could have been great, with only a bit more insight.  It's a shame that it fell the other way....",1019347200,9,3613,4.689873417721519
16696,1,0767839129,"This movie was horrible! First of all, it was not even historically accurate--there were more glaring innaccuracies and downright fabrications spewed forth in this movie than in a televised political debate. Joan of Arc was basically portrayed as a delusional, over-intense, angry girl who threw tantrums when things didn't go her way.
Joan of Arc's heroic accomplishments are overshadowed in this movie. Her actions which helped free the France from English control are cast in a cynical light--that she was mostly motivated by a desire for revenge. There is no mention of what a good, loving, unselfish person she was--during her trials her friends and those who knew her testified how that she was all of these things.
If you are looking for a sensational piece of fluff that reveals nothing about St. Joan of Arc, then watch this movie.

16697,2,0767839129,"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (Luc Besson, 1999)

As the final credits rolled, I found myself asking one thing many times: what in the world was (fill in the actor, director, etc.) thinking? Besson, who gave us such amusing and occasionally brilliant fare as Leon and Nikita, went way off the deep end. Milla Jovovich, who worked so well with Besson in The Fifth Element, delivers every line as if she's being forced to overact. John Malkovich is about as French as a quesadilla. Etc. One wonders why this got a big-screen release and Christian Duguay's incredibly superior three-hour Joan of Arc, release the same year, got relegated to TV miniseries status.

Mother always said that if you can't say anything good, then shut up. So I'll just say that if you're looking for a modern retelling of the tale of St. Joan, Duguay's version is available on DVD. Rent it. Forget this exists. *  (only because Dustin Hoffman actually gives a halfway decent performance; too bad he's only got about ten minutes of screen time.)",1017619200,3,1029,4.737430167597766
16698,3,0767839129,"Messenger:The Story of Joan of Arc is at times brilliant and at other times chaotic. In a few scenes it is brilliant and chaotic at the same time. How can this be, you ask? It's because it was made by the brilliant but messy French director, Luc Besson. Besson did two of my favorite pop culture movies, La femme Nikita and The Fifth Element. I admired both of these for the same reasons. Both are high-tech, fast-paced visualizations of absurd stories. They are triumphs of style over substance. Nikita is about a young female criminal who is coerced by the French equivalent of the CIA into becoming an assassin. The Fifth Element is a bizarre science fiction story set in the future. In it, Bruce Willis, aided by a truly weird alien girl, must keep the evilest force in the universe from destroying the human race. I think the reason that Messenger is a weaker film is that Besson's unique style does not work well when he deals with a story set six hundred years in the past.
You would think that this filming of the Joan of Arc story would be great because this is a French film with several American stars in the cast. [Don't panic! It's in English.] But, beyond Besson's limitations are the limitations of the story itself, which is shrouded in mystery. In the early 15th Century, a young French peasant girl named Joan had visions that she claimed told her she was to lead an Army that would free her people from English rule. The army was raised by the dauphin, the English retreated, and the dauphin became Charles VII, King of France. Afterwards, Joan's reward was to be tried as a heretic and then burned at the stake. This much seems to be accepted by historians. Whether or not Joan actually lead the army is hotly debated. Who actually tried Joan is also not known for sure. Some think it was the English, others think it was the Catholic church. We do not even know the exact nature of the charges against her. We cannot say for sure what events caused the poor girl to go from heroine to martyr. She was basically forgotten about until the 19th Century, when her story was used as a political tool to advance the cause of French nationalism. Five hundred years after her death, the Church declared her to be a Saint.
I tell you all this history because it is my opinion that a satisfactory movie about her will never be made, because it is impossible to tell the story in a way that will please everyone. That leaves us to deal with the successes and failures of The Messenger on a purely cinematic basis. Its strong points include its visual richness. The feel of the period is lovingly rendered. The script adroitly sidesteps the issue of Joan's visions. While it does not deny that her messages may have come from God, it also suggests the possibility that she was simply delusional. It concludes that, whatever the source of her messages, the savageness of her trial made even her doubt her sources.
One of the movie's weaknesses lays in casting Milla Jovovich as Joan. I have admired her work in other films, but, like the director, she is not the right choice for a historical epic. The biggest mistake, however, was made in choosing to show in detail several gruesome battles. These occupy perhaps a third of the movie's two and one half hours running time. They become redundant and detract from the more interesting story of Joan - her childhood, her visions, her dealing with royal powers, her interactions with the all-male troops, and her eventual and tragic fall from grace. The result is that Messenger is an interesting movie, but hardly a great one.",1016496000,,3583,4.591263650546022
16699,5,0767839129,"This is a great film. I am reviewing it because I was taken a back by the fact it had not recieved a 5 star rating. I think Luc Besson is one of the best living international directors. While not entirely ""hollywood,"" his style is approachable by even the most dense popcorn munching, soda guzzling fan of Hollywood, and still his films have a lyrical and often subtle quality which makes for great filmaking.
While my favorite film of his is Leon (The Professional), this is my second favorite film of his.
Many of the people I saw this film with in the theatre were turned off by its almost macabre sense of the spirit realm. I think Besson has found a unique vision for the telling of this historical story. I think he risks offending people who are unwilling to explore the possibility of human qualities in saints and religious heros. In this telling one is left to wonder if Joan was acting on the voice of God, or merely following the dictates of vain imaginations.
It is a beautiful and lyrical film, which seems a virtual impossibilty due to its extremely graphic depiction of violent warware, but somehow Besson manages to give even the scenes of carnage a lyrical mystical quality.
The only thing which risks destroying the film is the casting of Dustin Hoffman as the voice of conscious. When i realised it was him, i was pulled right out of the movie, which was sad because I was so happily wrapt in the world Besson had created. This sad fact is why I think this film is very good (considering the multitude of shallow triteness coming out of Hollywood) but not Besson's best.
Would I recommend someone buy this film? A heartfelt yes!

16702,2,0767839129,"Well, you can be sure you'll be treated to your fair share of glorious Plantagenet hairdos if you rent this DVD. Almost everyone in the (fabulous) cast - even John Malkovich - has one. But alas the hair styles are about the only source of genuine cheer; almost everything else is a let-down.
Malkovich had a peach of a part as the dastardly, conniving Dauphin, but played it amazingly straight, with nary a hint of the cheeky chappie the role was crying out for. What would Alan Rickman have made of it, I wonder. Or even Bruce Willis?
He certainly wasn't helped by the dreadful pacing of the first half - it is a full hour before Joan has even got her army, let alone used it - the first 60 minutes being devoted to tedious back story leading to Joan's appearance in the Dauphin's court; by turns voyeuristic (was she a virgin? Spend ten minutes finding out!), gratuitously violent (the murder and necrophilia of Joan's sister), and just plain daft (recurring visions of a remarkably camp Jesus in a forest surrounded by wolves).
The gratuitous violence is a serious blight on the film; the murder/rape scene was arguably relevant to the plot but still was depicted with more detail and relish than necessary, and the remainder of the film overflows with dogs, wolves and crows gobbling human carrion and more battlefield amputations and decapitations than probability would dictate. I'm sure these earned the film its 18 restriction when, fundamentally, it could have quite easily avoided them.
But for all the above, I think the main problem with this film is Luc Besson himself. The early stages are laden with meaningless cliches - wolves streaming through the forest, girl running through meadows - and laboured imagery (crucifix, fire, dripping blood and a combination thereof) which get the film off to a bad start from which it never recovers.
And thereafter Besson unwisely tries to have a bob each way. On one hand, he takes the historically faithful/dramatised documentary angle - this is really how it happened, you see - but on the other he plays the dreamy, psychedelic/quasi-spiritual card at the same time. Which isn't how it happened, at all.
Most peculiar were Joan's visions of Jesus. It really isn't clear what we are meant to take from these: Did Joan really see visions of Jesus (as a boy and - heavily made up with eye-shadow, a beard and a toga - apparently as a member of Slade), or was she simply a paranoid schizophrenic, not in need of an army to march on the British so much as Professional Help?
Besson doesn't answer this fundamental question, and the introduction of Dustin Hoffman at the end of the film, seemingly imbued with magical powers, really doesn't help. I still don't know what Hoffman was meant to do in the film or who he was. Was he Jesus? Was he Joan's conscience? Or just more evidence that she really was nuts? Or was HE the lead guitarist from Slade?

Dustin Hoffman...well at times I found him a little annoying as her ""conscience"".

I remember a moment in the film, in the middle or near the end of the war when the land is drenched in blood from both sides, and Jesus ""appears"" to her and says ""what are you doing to me, Joan?""

Dustin Hoffman as her conscience, represents the logical side of the story and he, in fact, represents the new, atheistic, analysis of Joan D'Arc biography.

Every other aspect of movie is done excellent - the acting, the coreography, the directing...
There are many people that will deeply disagree with the claims of the movie, but it is still interesting to see it and see what the ""other"" side thinks.

Joan has long since ceased being a historical person and has entered the realm of myth and legend; as for her being a saint, well, I have no idea what a saint is. But the movie presents a very human Joan in a drama superbly acted and incredibly filmed.
Other objections are to beheadings and dogs gnawing at the slain. Fascinating -- we want our saints saintly and wars antiseptic. If that's what you want, don't watch this movie. Admittedly, the war scenes are not historically accurate. They are far too mild to reveal the nature of death in the Hundred Years War. But here the objection was not with the historical accuracy. For viewers less comfortable with ambiguity and blood, perhaps an G-rated version is more appropriate. But Joan lived in X-rated times.

Furthermore, you would never know Joan of Arc was a devout Catholic from seeing this movie. Aside from a few one sentence requests to see a priest, Joan's deep faith and spirituality are totally left out. Not that Milla Jovovich has that kind of range as an actress anyway but couldn't they have at least tried?

The story takes liberties here and ther but a deeper story is there taht no film has ever touched and to really grab the genrebending myths behind the real Joan of Arc who was really called ""Joan The Virgin"" makes this film even more compelling. Facts like the French may have been embrassed by a poor woman leading them to victory and that Joan was very afraid of being burned at the stake and jumped from the 70 foot high tower which was her prison without a scratch on her when she landed! obviously she was recaptured and burned but while at the stake the crowd began to change their views and demanded for her release. It took the executioner 5 trys to burn her at the stake due to the fire kept burning out! Joan was not on trial for crimes committed against an English king but for immorally corupt behavior due to her donning mens clothing which magically found its way into her cell! This is what she was killed for being a witch! The english belived it looked bad to give just a mere powerfull, intellignet, brave, self driven-19 yr. old the hand of death but to murder an all powerfull witch her last due was justified! Besson's take on this is brilliant painting Joan as a saint to those who love her and powerfull to those who fear her! The film does not paint her as diluted but as the English would want us to view her! Hoffman is brilliant as the FILMS voice of reason and as a whole the images and sounds take full advantage of the films epic scope! A must by alone to see a distraught Jovovich in a wheat field telling an army of thousands to ""Fight Me If You Love Me""! About as close to the true Joan as we might see for a long time...a must own!",1007251200,,2039,4.326370757180157
16710,3,0767839129,"That was the dilemma for those who were dealing with the real-life Joan of Arc, and it remains so in reel life in ""The Messenger"".
I had got some free passes for this movie; my friend John was glad to come with me and my sister because he knew something about it. I guess what he knew was that IT WOULD BE VIOLENT, which is often a powerful motivator for menfolk. Well, okay, so it was violent--what of it? I think the essential value of this movie is that after you see it, you have a fairly accurate idea of how medieval warfare was conducted, how men had to rev themselves up for terrifying hand-to-hand combat with a truly mortal enemy. This is not a women's picture, no.
Some things annoyed me about this picture. In the early pillaging scene, we see Joan is a little preteen girl. I thought, hey that's great, for once Joan is going to be a GIRL, you know, not a woman. But then we cut to the Dauphin/John Malkovich's castle where everyone's talking about the imminent visit from this strange visionary. She arrives, throws back her hood, and .... she's some other actress now! I really hate that kind of thing. This is a crucial scene; I have to trust my protagonist, and I don't even know this dame! She was also doing a lot of weird, border-line things that made you question her sanity. I don't think the real Joan comported herself like that--no one would have followed her into battle otherwise.
Another problem was that a famous part of the Joan story is that she hears three saints' voices talking to her; they're the ones who inspire her to fight against England's invasion. But this Joan meets up with Christ himself, and later, with Dustin Hoffman.

At the time, I have only heard of Milla Jovovich. When I watched it, I was left breathless. Milla delivered an outstanding performance as Joan of Arc as well as all the other actors including Tcheky Karyo as Dunois (of course). This movie is definitely a must-see.

16721,5,0767839129,"First of all, this movie is based on facts. Many reviews charged the makers of the movie that it is a complete nonsense. Well, some parts are made up, probably to empahsize the groundbraking concept of the movie but overall it is historically correct. If you buy the DVD version, you will have the opportunity to see a documentary that is dedicated to all the research the Joan of Arc Research Center in France spent time on before the actual shooting of the movie began.
Now that you know that this is not your everyday historical movie, let us talk about the concept of the movie. Many reviews before me said that the movie basically tells a story of an insane woman who can not be Joan because she is this and that, according to the legend. The whole point is that this movie challenges that legend. Have you ever wondered how could a simple peasant girl lead an army living in a very rigid society of medieval times? Was it really a divine will that put her on the stage of history or maybe her self-determination and circumstances shaped her fate?. Besson asks these question almost completely abandoning the legend of Joan that became accepted by scholars and everyday people. The movie makes you think and, in my belief that is the sole purpose of it. It is not really a biography of some sort but a new way of explaining the known historical facts. Dustin Hoffmann's character is the perfect tool to achieve that. By the way, Mr. Hoffmann does an excellent job.
The other actors do a fine job as well considering that it was an international cast. Many say that Milla was terrible in the movie. Well, she is not Meryl Streep but tried her best. Mr. Malkovich did as much with his small part as much as he could. The other bright spot besides Mr. Hoffmann was Faye Dunaway's excellent portrait of the King of France's mother-in-law.
The battle scenes were very realistic and exciting. One other thing that deserves to be mentioned is the costumes. All the clothing and armor the actors wore were in some cases complete reproductions. The jewelry were copies of pieces from the times of Joan. These provide an atmosphere like you are really in the fifteenth century.
If you buy this title, buy the DVD version. The sound and picture quality is excellent and the widescreen format is truely great.

I truly respect Joan of Arc and find her story quite inspiring. This film turned a strong, noble woman into a babbling psycho bent on revenge for something that never even happened. Very, very few things in this film were even historically accurate.
John Malcovich and Dustin Hoffman must've lost a bet...that's the only explanation I can think of for their prescence in this filth.
The film does have Braveheart level (in violence, not quality) battle scenes, so you may want to be careful about letting little ones view this. There is a scene in the very beginning where young Joan witnesses her sister get brutally killed and then raped, which was truly disturbing. In addition to being one of the creepiest moments on film, the event never actually happened.

Now, with that out of the way, it's obvious that Besson took many liberties in his interpretation of the LEGEND of Jean d'Arc.  He never claimed to be portraying the events exactly as they happened.  After all, a good portion of the film takes place in the mind of Jean, and no one--not even historians--know what that was really like.  If you want a history lesson, watch PBS or the History Channel.  If you want a thrilling, disturbing, inspiring, gorgeous, brilliant, and innovative lesson in true Christianity, then watch this movie.  That's what this movie is all about--Christianity.  In a sense it's an anti-Catholicism film; however, it urges a close relationship with God.  It displays the horrors of giving over to one's personal desires and ignoring the message of Jesus Christ.  The film is an indictment of misinterpretation of the Bible and of feelings of superiority over others.  It's not ""about"" Jean d'Arc!  It just uses her--a well-respected and almost idolized figure--to get across a vital message.  That message is that we mere humans--all of us, including priests, popes, and saints--can not begin to fathom the purpose of existence, that we do not have the wisdom or the right to judge others, and that giving over to our worldly desires will be the end of us.",1001289600,4,1411,4.789256198347108
16726,1,0767839129,"Being a person who admired the Joan of Arc of our history, I was very much looking forward to the releasal of ""The Messenger.""  I had hoped it would portray Joan in an updated version. How wrong I was.
For starters, the movie ran just too long.  Movies that are long that people don't mind, such as ""Forrest Gump"" are tolerated because they were good.  This movie was just plain bad.
Aside from the fact there are fabricated characters such as Dustin Hoffman's ""Conscious,"" it was historically inaccurate.  John Malkovich was too old to play Charles, the interactions Joan had with the English were looked over in order to spruce up the special effects of the wars and it just simply concentrated on the wrong topics of her story.  I wanted to know more about Joan, not watch the soldiers brutalize each other.
The great disservice this screenplay did was portray Joan as insane rather than having a gift from God.  Only a few ""miracles"" were actually illustrated, such as Joan picking Charles out of a crowd.  Jovovich's portrayal of Joan as a shuddering, twitching mental patient was simply unnerving, not at all enlightening.  Historic reports indicated that Joan was not at all like the movie version -- quite the opposite in fact.
This movie is also more graphic than I could bear.  The raping of her sister's corpse was just plain disgusting -- as well as false.  This did not happen and Joan's visions began way before any catastrophe...
The Messenger concentrates too much on special effects and the action factor of war.  Joan is dismissed as a saint in this movie and merely portrayed as an insane woman who pretty much got lucky with people listening to her rants.  I have never been so disgusted in my life with a biopic, which is usually what we expect -- a factual version of a historical figure.  My recommendation is to SKIP this... and look up an older version of the movie or check out PBS' website for information on specials of Joan of Arc -- they care more about facts than special effects and shock value...",1000857600,9,2029,4.649859943977591

16732,4,0767839129,"The Messenger: The Story of Joan Of Arc, was extremely moving. I thought the film portrayed Joan Of Arc as she would have likely been. Her constant compulsion to confess her sins, and her visions of God, seemed realistic. For a late-teen, female, during the Hundred Years War, to have convinced the King of France to give her command of an army, Joan Of Arc must have been as eccentric as Milla Jovovich presented her. Jovovich, and her surrounding cast, did a good job.
I think the film's use of Dustin Hoffman as Joan Of Arc's conscience was very well done. I noticed in other reviews, that several people found Hoffman's role to be confusing. I understood clearly what his character represented. He symbolized Joan's conscience, and her process of self examination after being captured.
Also, I think the film's battle scenes were well done. The costume and prop work was nice too. The Hundred Years war saw the dawn of some amazing advancements in armor, battle tactics, and weaponry, and The Messenger did a good job in demonstrating that. Many other films from this era show only a handful of men-at-arms, with the remainder of the armies being lightly armored infantry. Finally a film had a majority of it's fighting men in full armor, the way they actually were during the closing years of the Hundred Years War.
The only flaw that I found was minor and superficial. I found some of the musical pieces to be a little too modern sounding. I do not like it when period films use modern style music. But I only noticed a couple ballads that bothered me. Other than that, I found no problems.
Overall, The Messenger receives four stars. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the history of either The Hundred Years War, or that of Joan Of Arc.",995760000,2,1751,4.651612903225806

Bresson's direction and pacing are not sure enough for this to be a quality film, but his story of a conflicted, manic Joan nevertheless has appeal. I have often wondered how Saints were in real life. Bresson's Joan is both self-confident and self-effacing.  Her self-confidence wins her fame, but it is her honest examination of conscience, her total self-effacement that ultimately makes her a Saint. Joan loves God passionately; her spirituality is real. She eschews amulets as a false and facile form of spirituality.  But she is still fallen in her humanity (as all saints are) and her motives to serve God are perhaps tinged with pride and, possibly, a desire for revenge. Joan's hunger to 'be confessed' is a touching recognition of her sinfulness. 'The Messenger' is a flawed film but not without merit.",993513600,,947,5.019108280254777

I think Jovovich errs too much in that she plays the role a little too far down the ""insanity"" line. This is a debate for some... was Joan of Arc a holy, saintly woman who really heard voices or was she simply insane? Who will ever know for sure?

Dustin Hoffman plays her 'spiritual guide' in a way that makes one wonder if Joan was truly a tool of God. An interesting footnote was that she was made a saint almost 500 years after she was burned. The dauphin was played admirably as a young bumbling king. Almost all the French Kings of history were buffoons save a few.
But what makes this movie stand out is the terribly violent battle scenes. In an age before gunpowder, the imagination used for weapons was truly astonishing. The 'bowling balls' that were dropped and shot out of the castle was something I had never heard of before. The 'gatling gun' arrow machine was also gruesome. The decapitation device that swung as soldiers reached the casle roof was another example of the horrific violence of being in the military in those days.

16752,1,0767839129,"There honestly isn't much I can say in favor of The Messenger.  The acting is terrible, the technical elements are a mess, and the movie leaves to many critical elements unexplained.  Worse still, the movie claims to be 'The Story Of Joan Of Arc,' but utterly ignores the historical evidence on Joan.
Unlike so many other bad movies, the horrendous technical elements make this movie almost unwatchable.  Le Hire looked like a refugee from Mad Max.  Some of the buildings look like they were designed by amateurs.  The church, for instance, near Orleans was actually shorter than Joan on horseback while the castles sported bizarre chutes designed to drop cannonballs onto invaders.  Even minor details, such as the ever-changing color of Jovovich's hair show nothing short of sloppy continuity and bad design.
Bad acting only complicates the situation.  Milla Jovovich, inexplicably, maintains the same expression throughout the entire movie - up to and including during Joan's burning.  Ms. Jovovich has said that were Joan alive today she would be sitting in an internet cafe sipping coffee.  Unfortunately, such utter misunderstanding carries over into her performance.  Her performance manages to portray Joan as a delusional maniac with zombie-like expressiveness.  Le Hire was portrayed as a caricature of a barbarian and lacked any real sense of definition.  The only decent acting jobs were by Tommy Lee Jones and Dustin Hoffman.  Jones put forward a solid, if somewhat lacking and one-dimensional, performance as Charles.  While I don't agree with his interpretation of the character, I can appreciate the skill that went into creating the role.  Hoffman was simply superb.
However good Hoffman's portrayal was, it brings up one of the serious problems in the movie.  His role is never explained, let alone supported historically.  He shows up in Joan's cell, questions her actions (it should be noted here that the directing here was really distracting, particularly the frequent cuts from the cell to the brightly-lit exteriors and back), and somehow turns in a very good performance.  He brings a lot of class to an underdeloped, pointless role.  It should be noted that this is the only high point in the movie.
My biggest complaint with The Messenger is that it claims to be 'The Story Of Joan Of Arc' and bears little to no resemblence to the historical record.  Despite theories to the contrary, Joan was no fanatic - this charge was never even made by her enemies - and that is what the movie insists on portraying her as.  Similarly, the entire motivation for Joan's actions, the death and rape of her mother, is pure fabrication.  Isabelle Romee, Joan's mother, actually survived Joan by almost 20 years and was instrumental in getting her daughter's condemnation lifted.  Artistic license is one thing, but if you want to tell 'The Story Of Joan Of Arc,' actually *tell* the story rather than resorting to utter fiction.
The lesson here is to avoid movies made simply to showcase the director's girlfriend.  That's why The Messenger was made and it further illustrates the lack of respect the director and cast (Hoffman and Jones excepted) had for the material.  Its false claims to tell a historical story are dangerous and irresponsible, while bad elements and design make for an unpleasant experience.",988848000,6,3325,5.079189686924494

Thank you, Luc.  The story seems rooted in Mark Twain's little known and publicized book, Joan of Arc, but with modern twists.  Do we believe religious zeal and fervor, and willingness to believe in divine spiritualism?  Or, do we believe the pragmatic conclusions offered by Hoffman?
Constantly we are shot by the bullets of doubt throughout the film.  Joan is suspiciously fervent and ardent-and simultaneously inclined to be both wrathful and forgiving.  She becomes God--her will is misinterpreted, even by herself.  And, since God is an unresolved question of existences, we are allowed our own personal summations.
I appreciate Gladiator, Patriot, and Braveheart-offered here because of their contextual values in epic filmaking-but the Messenger leaves me with something to think about.

16755,4,0767839129,"Not many would appreciate what portrays Joan of Arc as is in Luc Besson's The Messenger: Joan of Arc.  She may be not the one the Church has told us.  She may not be the one written according to the historical documentary.  But she may be the one she could possibly be.
One should not forget Catholicism has been constantly evolving, not to say the least Joan was sainted 500 years after her death by the Church who put her on trial in the English territory, city of Rouen.  Our view on the historical heroine might certainly be evolving too.
Joan perhaps was the Messenger.  Joan perhaps was the Maid.  Joan could, certainly, be the Revenger, driven by her own desire to make revenge on the Brits for her sister death. We should remember that we are sometimes the servants (or the maids) of God, sometimes we are just driven by our own internal desires. God knows it certainly well.  One could not become a saint on earth while he/ she struggles, but only after his/ her death.  On the contrary, the Holy Mother Church would not turn away (as the Bishop vividly said in the movie) anyone who repent, who make confession to the Church.
Yes, Joan constantly asked for confession.  The concept of confession is very important in the Catholicism and in the path to saint.  Luc Besson couldn't be more accurate in portraying Joan's feverish faith in God:  her confession in the beginning of the movie till the last,  the continuous examination by the Conscience, her absolute confidence in God when she was burned at stake.  That she won battle after battle, that she saved France from the foreigner in the 15th century, that her single-mindedness and devotion to her country are only penalized by her fellow countrymen out of greed, jealousy and power.
Luc's sense of black humor and MTV-style of cinematography might not appeal to everyone.  And Milla Jovovich sometimes is too dramatic. But to the fans of Luc Besson, you are completely satisfied by his vision, fast-cut, and enthralling exploration.",984787200,,1999,4.7398843930635834
16756,3,0767839129,"After seeing the Messenger only a week after Hallmark's Joan of Arc, I think it's a testimony to the real life enigma that she could be interpreted in such very different ways- from a girl of incredible strength and courage ready to die for her faith to a woman made neurotic by circumstance and visions fueled by her faith in God despite all she had seen.  Leelee vs. Milla?  I think both women simply found a part of Joan they identified with and ran with it, though I must say, I enjoyed Leelee's portrayal more.  It was hard to watch the end though with the conscience (Dustin Hoffman) but when you are called by God to do something it often doesn't make sense- even to you and you are tormented with whether it is really God or your ego.  And yet, you must keep these fears silent to accomplish the goal.  In that, I think ""Messenger"" hits both its mark and the heart of Joan of Arc in this beautifully sylistic if gritty epic.",981158400,,932,4.333333333333333

To be truthful I expected to watch the normal 20 minutes that I give most movies (13th Warrior, for example) and then turn it off.  But instead, this is a movie I will recommend to friends as a companion to Braveheart and Excalibur.  As for accuracy, I'm not a historian.  But if you want a grand scale motion picture that looks like you've jumped back in time then MESSENGER does not disappoint.  4 1/2 out of 5 stars.  Not 5 because the accents don't seem quite right.

She couldn't expressed her (I mean  Joan's of Arc) emotions. She was crying and shouting all the time. Nothing more. Besides she was too old to play 17 years old girl. Only one thing in this movie was impressive - batallistc scenes. I am very disappointed with this movie.

The fight scenes were so utterly ridiculous...as in: Joan gets shot with the arrow while on the ladder and suddenly the BATTLE STOPS!! INCREDIBLE. The attempts at humorous banter were so bad it actually makes you uncomfortable. About the only redeeming quality of this waste of a movie is the scenic landscapes.

16761,5,0767839129,"I have seen the movie twice within a week, and will see it a couple of more times. I was shivering through the whole movie, it was so real for me. ... how 'clean' Joan was. First, at the beginning of the film it turns out that she had been to the priest for the third time that day, to confess. Later on the knights do not understand her when she says 'I want to confess. I have not confessed ... today yet' - if your really pay attention, for the environment this is very strange. And, at the end of the movie, she confesses her 'crimes' again. What I want to point out that she had a very strong conscience and she intended to keep it clean. This makes her a candidate to be Saint - as she was given this title 500 years later.

This movie IS about reality, the betraying of Joan included. This is what I liked the most (the film being so real).

Further on, every split second of the movie is communicating something. If you watch closely, the faces, the looks of the actors, the music, are constantly telling you a part of the story, a message. Perfect timing features the cutting of this film. The conflicts are precisely designed. The actors are perfectly matching their roles. I admit, that the ending is a bit long, but basically it stresses the suppressive behaviour of the inqusition of that time.

Milla plays just perfectly. In this version of the Joan of Arc movies she is what she is and that is it. Luc Besson had an idea in mind and she realises it.

If you like Luc Besson, Milla Jovovich, Eric Serra, history, middle age, or if you are a rebel, this movie is a must for you.

The more you appreciate art the more you are going to like this movie.

However, I believe that this movie is one of the most fascinating of the last ten years (along the likes of Braveheart). Milla Jovovich plays with an incredible passion. She is completely transcended by her character and she is very believable as a passionaria. Her slavic nature makes it easier for her to play such roles as it is a passionate people (History has shown it over and over again). It may indeed appeal more to a latin or slavic audience rather than an anglo-saxon one. The character is driven by religion and a godlike patriotism towards her king. Even though that sounds very American (and that's probably why the historical figure is famous there), this is a behaviour that most French, South-Americans or Russians can relate to as they've been through countless revolutions led by such passionarias (sometimes completely unknown). Overall, an enthralling movie and if there would be just one reason to watch that movie, it would have to be for the incredibly realistic battle scenes.",975456000,,1072,4.863387978142076

While trying to be defiant and innovative, this film falls into historical incongruence. In order to sustain his picture of an eschizofrenic Joan Of Arc, Besson modifies or distorts historical facts and events already proven. For any person who knows and/or respects Joan Of Arc, or is looking to learn more about her, this is the last source they should look into. On another hand, the performances leave to much to desire, starting with Milla Jovovich, who overplays too offen. The only one who stood up to his name was Dustin Hoffman, a good actor in a bad role.  To defy the common beliefs and standards in general, be it on Joan Of Arc or on any other subject, is always good, but only as long as such opinions are based on facts, something that Besson forgot in this movie.",974592000,4,930,4.602409638554217

It does not look at Jeanne as either insane or a true divine messenger; the movie permits the viewer to make their own decisions. Are Jeanne's visions really sent by God? Or is she just insane? You make the choice.  In this movie, Jeanne d'Arc is refreshingly real. She has doubts, motives - good and bad - and irrationality, just like any other being - along with her bravery and boldness. This Jeanne's France is not a fairytale land, but a real place with equal portions of dirt and finery.  Overall, I would totally recommend this movie to most people - just not the people who want legend of Jeanne d'Arc to remain just that in their minds - a mythical legend.",972345600,,827,4.470198675496689
16766,5,0767839129,"This movie was picked apart by the critics and died at the box office.  Why?  It really doesn't deserve this treatment, in fact, I found it to be a stirring, cerebral epic with some of the most engaging medieval battle sequences I've ever seen, and a facinating peek into the nature of intense religious faith.
Milla Jovovich does a great job in the title role.  Yes, she's extremely erratic, but this serves to convey the feeling of overwhelming religiosity and sense of purpose...and, she's of believable age and appearance for Joan.  The entire film has an undercurrent of tension that comes from the weight of the subject matter.  Luc Besson has created a visual masterpiece, sometines looking MTV-ish, but in a manner that makes the period come alive for modern audiences rather than being distracting.
Even though the aforementioned battles and action scenes are riveting, the best thing about the fim is the cerebral undercurrent.  Does the Dustin Hoffman character represent the Devil, God, something strictly inside Joan's head, or all three?  The interplay between these two is intriguing, as are the trial sequences, which were often lifted from the actual historical texts.
All in all a very satisfying film.  Don't listen to the talking heads, go out and form your own opinion.  This film will become more appreciated with time.",972172800,11,1341,5.031674208144796

However, her behavior makes you wonder. Where does inspiration come from? If you hear voices, are they good ones? If you think you hear the voice of God...is it God, or your own Ego? Watch this movie and contemplate the deeper meaning of who you are and why you do the things you do. The sets are wonderful and the message is power-packed. I truly loved the characters, even if I was a little surprised.  Some of the supporting characters are just as interesting as the main characters--but, I don't want to ruin the moments! The Battle scenes are terrific, they make you want to grab a sword and go fight for a cause.  This movie does an excellent job of revealing the Patriarchal Dictatorship of the church, as well.

16779,2,0767839129,"It seems that Luc Besson is capable of reaching deep inside of this Milla Jojovich and bringing out a beautiful monster.  Her portrayal of one of the least understood of our most famous icons is intense, and thoughtful - bringing the viewer full circle around the character of Joan of Arc.
Unfortunately, Jojovich is the the only relief from what is a long and generously violent flick.  There are a number of ""spirtual"" moments in the film which deal with her supposed communication with God.  However, it is apparent that Besson has his predetermined notions as to whether Joan of Arc was indeed divine or disturbed and we are never really given the opportunity to consider the other.
Unfortunately for Besson, this is the first movie to involve knights, castles, and battles since Braveheart(Gibson, 1995) which seems to have become the obvious comparison.  Even the ""revenge"" story is not dissimilar enough from the Braveheart ""righteous revenge"" theme to encourage excitement about The Messenger.
Even an ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" style performance from Dustin Hoffman does not detract from the fact that by the time you have sat through The Messenger, you will really feel that you have seen it all before.",970531200,,1203,5.030150753768845

But I did finish watching the film, and although I don't agree with this portrayal of The Maid as a almost stark raving-mad lunatic, it does a very good job of presenting a different angle on what drove this brave girl to do what no one else could do.
I happen to believe Joan was divinely inspired, not a self-deluded lunatic. I still believe it. But entertaining someone else's ideas and interpritations by watching this movie for a couple hours isn't that hard to do. The photography and costumes are beautiful, and the performances range from good to excellent.

16782,2,0767839129,"I bought this in the vague hope of stumbling on one more underpublicized and underappreciated (in the US) French masterpiece such as Claude Berri's  Queen Margot.  Not quite!  There are certainly aspects of brilliance here  both in the cinematography and Mila Jovovich's performance, but there is a  tremendous amount of anarchy and occasional apparent aimlessness in the  plot.  Of course the Joan of Arc story is well known, but many times, the  director seemed to let things ramble on without good tie ins.  It's a long  film, but that shouldn't be a vice.  Here it is, because long portions  could be cut without harming the overall effect.  Better yet, the themes  could have been better established and linked and the character development  focused better.  Apart from the title character, everyone else was pretty  much constructed of cardboard.
What really offended me about The Messenger was the  dialogue, which in many places is simply ludicrous.  There is plenty of  90's colloquialism and plenty of medieval cliche, but very little authentic  sounding conversation reflecting the status relationships between French  nobility (and royalty) and peasants.  At the same time, there are some  cheap, Keystone coppish antics in which the ostensible army leaders bumble  like the Three Stooges, while Joan takes some implausible action.  In these  respects, at least, The Messenger demonstrates that the Hollywood lowest  common denominator can be at home on the Continent as well.  This sort of  triviality really disappoints me, as I think it did a lot to mediocratize  another film which should have been very good, Mel Gibson's Patriot.  All  in all, what is frustrating is that this could also have been a very worthy  effort, perhaps memorable, but fails because the whole was far less than  the sum of the parts.",965952000,,1826,5.1160409556314

Milla Jovovich plays a desperate Joan, rarely serene.  She's getting messages from beyond, and uses her divine guidance to defeat  the invading enemy. And this sequence is pretty fun, though the images of  medieval combat are a bit on the gory side. Though Jovovich's performance  is fevered and exciting, she can't carry the introspective scenes quite as  well.
To make things worse, she is surrounded by great actors  sleepwalking through minor roles, and her director insists on having showy  metaphysical scenes that do very little to illuminate the protagonist's  point of view. The finale is a little subdued, as well.
Nevertheless,  it's a fun film. It's not a bad way to spend 2.5 hours, and sometimes great  actors are at their most fun when they're phoning in a part, like Dustin  Hoffman as ""The Conscience,"" whatever that is.",965692800,,929,5.006535947712418
16784,3,0767839129,"If it were not based on a true story, Luc Besson's `The Messenger: The  Story of Joan of Arc' would be a tale filled with credibility gaps a mile  wide. Since it is, however, a recounting of one of the world's most famous  stories of military triumph and personal tragedy, the film actually  generates the most interest when it concentrates on just those  mind-boggling historical incredibilities.
Joan was, of course, the  deeply devout, illiterate peasant girl who, spurred on by what she claimed  were visions and voices sent directly by God - assuring her and France of a  glorious victory over the advancing forces of the invading English army -  managed to convince a desperate monarch to have her lead an army into the  field, despite the fact that she brought with her no previous battle  experience or even a rudimentary knowledge of the use of weapons in combat.  We first see her as a young girl, strangely obsessed with religious piety,  attending confession daily, running through the woods in a mad frenzy of  ecstasy, encountering strange, inexplicable visions along the way, and,  eventually, being driven to an intense hatred of the British by the rape  and murder of her beloved older sister. We see the French royalty, so  driven to desperation by the seemingly inexorable encroachment of the  brutal British onto their native soil, that they lend credence to this  child and give in to her demands, sending her out to lead the troops into  what turns out to be some truly miraculous routs and victories. But glory  is, more often than not, an ineffable entity that is lost as quickly as it  is gained - and Joan learns tragically that, once her original goal of  restoring the French monarch to his throne is achieved, her services are no  longer of value, and she is allowed to be captured by the English, tried by  the Catholic Church, and burned at the stake by the English government for  the crime of witchcraft.
Given this fascinating and astonishing series  of events, it would be difficult to make a film completely lacking in  interest and insight. And, indeed, `The Messenger' is, perhaps, a better  film than many of the harsh, almost bitter reviews by many critics would  indicate. The first half of the film is a rather conventional telling of  the tale. The warrior Joan often comes across as a shrill, petulant  adolescent who somehow never convinces us that she is, indeed, someone all  these military strategists would follow. But, about midway through the  film, the screenwriters, Andrew Birkin and writer/director Besson, begin to  apply some psychological depth to the character. After a particularly  sanguine encounter with the English, in which hundreds of decapitated and  limbless corpses strew the blood-soaked ground, Joan breaks down in despair  over the horrifying inhumanity of the sight. From then on, her actions  arise from a paradoxical conflict occurring within the very core of her  being - between the righteousness of her pious cause, the pacifistic  teachings of Christ and her single-minded devotion to her king and country.  When she is finally captured and held in prison before and during her  trial, she begins to question the veracity of her visions and to ponder  whether the motivation for her cause really lay in divine inspiration or an  obsession for personal glory and power. We're a long way from the astute  psychological insights of Carl Dreyer's classic silent film version of the  story, `The Passion of Jeanne d'Arc,' but `The Messenger' does take  occasional time out from its action sequences to attempt to explore the  question of whether Joan's miracles were the product of divine intervention  or of mere happenstance and chance coupled with a determination and passion  borne of insanity. Unfortunately, casting Dustin Hoffman as the Voice of  Conscience who visits her in her cell and speaks for the side of reason as  she descends more and more into seeming madness, renders much of this  otherwise fascinating section faintly ludicrous. Every time his overly  familiar face and voice arrive on the scene, we are immediately thrust out  of the context of the story and find ourselves tempted to giggle out loud -  hardly the tone one wants to establish as Joan of Arc marches grimly to the  stake. Also, much of what he utters rings false in the context of the  film's era; he sounds like he is mouthing psychobabble that would not  arrive on the scene for at least another five hundred years.
In terms of  dialogue, historical films have always it seems had to face an inevitable  Hobson's Choice: should the writers employ language that reflects the  reality of the time, thereby making the characters sound stilted or dated  by today's standards, or should the authors resort to the use of more  modern vernacular, enhancing the immediacy of the story, perhaps, but also  possibly creating an uncomfortable and awkward sense of anachronism that  weakens the verisimilitude of the film so painstakingly established by the  elaborate set decoration and costume design of the film? The writers of  `The Messenger' have, for the most part, taken the latter course, leading  to mood-shattering declarations by the characters such as `she's nuts!' and  `I'm gonna kill that f------ bitch' along with a barrage of four-letter  word expletives with which no contemporary PG-13 or R-rated feature could  ever do without.
Those with a queasiness when it comes to movie violence  had best be forewarned: the battle scenes, though expertly shot and edited,  register high on the bloodletting scale.
Of the performers, none matches  in quality the exquisite photography, art direction or costume design that  adorn the film. Milla Jovovich is, at best, adequate as Joan, rarely giving  more than a surface interpretation of the complex psychological struggles  occurring at the root of her personality. John Malkovich, as the would-be  French king, for whose throne Joan lays her life on the line, has his  moments, but the part is not really big enough in the context of the film  to allow him to create a multifaceted performance. Faye Dunaway brings a  cool, subtle intensity to her role as the future king's manipulative  mother-in-law.
`The Messenger' emerges as an ultimately unsatisfying  mixture of faults and virtues, yet, because it has such a fascinating story  to tell, the film is far more interesting than the brutally hostile reviews  that greeted the work's initial release would lead one to believe.",965433600,5,6492,5.009380863039399

Implausible perhaps, but gripping,  scary, weird, dramatic: a psychological study of frenzied revenge ending in  insight, repentance and inner peace. But as a dramatization of the life of  Joan of Arc it is a flop, an ""F"", a Zero. The Milla Jovovich  character is as far from the winsome, simple, and tenderhearted peasant  girl as the East is from the West. For those of you who want to learn about  the real Joan, there is a wealth of information including extensive first  hand accounts from the Trial of Nullification. It is well worth the effort.

16786,2,0767839129,"Unfocused, overproduced, over-ambitious and overlong, that is the best way to describe this uneven period action movie/tragedy/religious melodrama. That's really too bad because it had potential and some great actors in it;  Faye Dunaway, John Malkovich and Dustin Hoffman. Starting with the cast,  Mila Jovovich was simply wrong for the role, 'Joan of Arc' is just as  complex a character as 'Blance DuBois', it was just too difficult for her  but who can blame her for trying. She was miscast in a vital role and  overdoes it a lot, but then she isn't even an actress, she was originally a  model that's always been typecast for roles where exotic looks where  needed. Faye Dunaway is under-appreciated, John Malkovich is simply miscast  in a role that makes him look silly and childish and Dustin Hoffman just  plain seems awkward in the role of devil?/angel?/conscience?. For a period  film it is too Hollywoodized, strange considering the French cast and  foreign director, it also fails to capture the times with silly accents and  unimpressive sets, costumes and makeup. The battle scenes have an extremely  low credibility level and look cartoonish. And the 'miracle sequences'  where Joan is visited by God are ridiculous, the guy that plays Jesus  looked more like a freak that the son of God, his looks are really  distracting. It tries to be 'Braveheart' (a much better film) at times but  fails miserably and near the end it violently changes direction to  religious melodrama. This are the film's best scenes where they start to  question whether Joan really saw God and even those sequences are overlong.  And the final burning at the stake, which should of been poignant or  dramatically successful is dull and unrewarding. The stylized direction by  Besson is completely inadequate here, it works well in films like 'La Femme  Nikita' (his best film) or even 'The Professional', but not here. Note: if  Joan really saw God (and I'm not saying she didn't), I wonder why he  preferred the French armies to the English, there's a religious  contradiction right there. God loves all and doesn't wish war and  manslaughter for anybody. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 4!",964656000,4,2190,4.945054945054945

Overlong, extremely shallow and with a tone that varies from comical slapstick to brutal fight sequences, watching  this film at that cinema was a mind, heart and buttock-numbing exercise.  Confirming the suspicion that Luc Besson is essentially a grown-up man with  a child's understanding of cinema, it's stylish, inconsistent, and with no  depth of any kind. The film seems like a terrible waste of talent -  Jovovich's edgy, verging-on-madness portrayal of the title character,  whilst never particularly subtle, nonetheless explodes with gusto, and the  battle sequences are highly entertaining in a grim and gritty,  post-'Excalibur' style. The rest of the film is a mess, though. Jeanne's  heavenly visions contain the worst kind of cliched mid-80's pop video  imagery imaginable, not a single line of dialogue stands out (except for  the well-known transcriptions of Jeanne's trial, taken from court records  of the time), and Eric Serra's music sounds rooted in the 1930's, when it  isn't using a 'Fifth Element'-style breathy 'thrum' noise. The tone veers  alarmingly - the opening sequence features Asterix-style comic English  soldiers, pantomime crooked teeth and all, brutally raping and murdering  Jeanne's sister. Later on, Jeanne's expedition to attack Paris is reduced  to a 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'-style 'attack the castle' fiasco,  whilst the ending tries a stab at indie art, with Dustin Hoffman as  Jeanne's 'conscience'.

As for the acting, I found her to be  rather, shall we say, odd? As I stared at her I couldn't help myself wonder  if she was about to scream in rage and burst into flames. It would make  someone wonder if she was sane of mind. In my opinion, the actress who  played Joan of Arc made her appear to be a religeous nut case and a  complete lunatic.  And as far as the comment one of the other reviewers  made saying only a ""...religeous fanatic...Pat Robertson."" would  ever buy this video, I can't help perhaps think the contrary. I was rather  disturbed seeing Christ protrayed as a rather frightening man with almost  lunatic seeming eyes and an expression of one about to be executed.  In any  case, presenting all these down sides, I can at least say that at least the  movie had some good special effects and recreating some of those moments  were good. I'd comment on the good acting if it wasn't downright unnerving  watching it.",962236800,2,1263,4.513274336283186
16790,3,0767839129,"While reviewing this video, I have wondered about whether Joan of Arc was portrayed accurately from a historical standpoint.
The writer depicts Joan as somewhat of an mentally off balanced or insane eccentric who has  weird visions. Realizing that Joan was declared a saint some 500 years  later, the writer attempts to protray her as material for sainthood with  Joan obsessed with confession to a priest for her sins and belief in  transubstantiation as the means of empowering her for her tasks.
The  Roman Church with its Inquisition that tried Joan is pictured in a much  favorite light. The English get most of the blame in the end, as the church  Inquisitors try to exonerate her but in the end declaring her to be a  martyr for the English.
In comparison, the video Joan of Arc played by  Leelee Sobieski has a much better and believable plot than this one. Milla  Jovovich has a much harder role in this script. She does a good job as does  her suppporting actors.",962064000,,973,4.6647058823529415
16791,3,0767839129,"The story of Joan of Arc holds a mythical quality for the French so it is interesting to see how a French director handles such a tale. Indecisively I say: Besson does not seem to be able to make his mind up whether Joan is  a superheroine or some crazy mixed up little girl. Although I loved the  flashiness and imagination of the 5th Element, something is definitely  missing in this film.
It takes Dustin Hoffman's late (and all to brief)  arrival into the film to start giving it the darkness it deserves. After  all, the story seems to be about rebelleion against tyranny, betrayal and  faith.
The period is captured well and the battle scenes capture the gore  and dirt well enough (crows and dogs nibbling at the dead adds another  dimension).
The big question is of course Milla Jovovich herself. She  spends most of the movie bewildered. She tries to capture the essence of a  woman possessed but ends up making a brave although lacking attempt. This  kind of role requires a masterful performance to bring out all the nuances.  The same indecision seemed to be behind Malkovitch's acting - I was  expecting a Valmont (although Faye Dunaway did a good job as the wicked  step mother).
I did like the overblown English accents and the battle  hardened French generals but after the film I was no more wise as to  whether Joan was the messenger of God or a lunatic possessed.",961977600,,1382,4.602459016393443
16792,5,0767839129,"I liked this movie very much. It works well on many levels:
Visually it is stunning - a virtuoso work.
The acting is terrific, not in the sense that it carries you away but in the sense that you enjoy watching the  actors. It is a theatrical movie in the best sense of the world. The  beauty, passion and fierceness of Joan just emanates out of Jojovich's face  and voice. The scheming queen played by Dunaway is a joy to behold, as is,  as always, Malcovich playing the prince of uncertain age who will become  the future king of France. Dustin Hoffman, having the unique role of Joan's  conscience, is splendid.
I found the movie very humorous and also very  French. Many actors speak with a French accent which I think is a very  clever device. You cannot separate the life of a person from the culture in  which this life evolved and I found the movie reflected well on some of the  special tidbits of the French soul.
Now the more difficult question about  how close this movie portrays Joan of Arc. I think the important question  is not how realistic the story is, but rather how true it is. First of all  reality as a person lives it is not reality as realistic movies show it to  be. This movie is full of strange surrealistic events seen through Joan's  eyes and a long and wonderful section at the end visualizes Joan's  thinking: her debating with her own conscience. If you want to understand  or communicate your vision about a person, particularly a person as unique  as Joan of Arc, you cannot stick to historical testimony alone. Certainly,  the director Luc Besson took huge liberties with this movie, showing Joan  from the inside, but I think they were well taken. Having Joan act out of a  revenge motive and casting doubt on the divine origin of her  ""voices"" may disturb a conservative religious mindset, but is  refreshing and believable at least to me. I want to think that Joan herself  would recognize herself better in this movie than in other supposedly more  historically exacting pictures. Should we ever meet her in the afterlife,  in which she undoubtedly believed in, it will be interesting to know how  she herself will judge all the stories told about her.
Joan of Arc may  not have been a saint, but her tragic and short life is as close as reality  can get to a miracle. In that sense Besson's ""The Messenger""  tells her story in a masterful way. This is one of the best films I have  seen, and one I have already enjoyed seeing several times. (Except for the  horrible and terribly memorable violation scene in the beginning which I  jump over every time...)",961804800,2,2597,4.5519480519480515
16793,1,0767839129,"An unusual movie, but ultimately an embarassing failure.  Beautiful cinematography and costuming cannot rescue this false, bloated, at times ridiculous, reprise of the story of Jeanne d'Arc. The problems can be  stated precisely: 1) Luc Besson.  2) Milla Jovovich.
Besson's Jeanne is  a bellowing lunatic and latter day feminist with a wicked right cross.  She  lounges in bed until midday then furiously berates her commanders for  starting the battle without her.  Similarly, her knights can be found  sleeping late (in full armour!) on the battlefield with the English Army  directly to their front.  The English in their turn are mercilessly  pilloried as a race of brutal proto nazis, well...OK. These are just a few  of the film's more besetting problems.  Besson's Jeanne comes across as not  a maid, but a madwoman worthy of institutionalization, if not the stake.
Likewise, Milla Jovovich's Jeanne is an insult to her memory.  Alternately screaming, squeaking,  pouting and hallucinating... It is  difficult to imagine teenage boys following such a girl around a swimming  pool, let alone hardened campaigners following her into battle.  One finds  one's self looking forward to her execution.
Jeanne's story deserves  much better treatment than she gets in this deplorable film.",961459200,4,1288,5.366834170854271
16794,3,0767839129,"""The Messenger"" is a compulsively watchable and notable film, not only for its visual lavishness, but also for its approach: it takes a shop-worn period tale, and delivers it in a much more contemporary and  modern pace.  Instead of just saying, ""This is a movie about a girl  named Joan of Arc"",  it gives us interesting insight on the power of  the conscience, psychology, and religion.  Milla Jovovich is pretty good as  the lead character, always boisterous and impulsive, but at the same time  understandable.  While the dialogue was a little drab (the audience is  always one step ahead--we know what the characters are going to say), and  the movie drags a little, it is more than made up for by the sheer epic  feeling you feel when the camera takes you in the heat of those battles.  The scenes where Joan is in interal conflict are disturbing and wrenching.  Mostly, though, it's plain fun and entertainment.",961200000,4,918,4.764331210191083
16795,5,0767839129,"Everyone here either seems to love this movie or hate it. I fall into the former category. Sure, all the history may not be accurate, but Luc Besson wasn't going for a historically correct version, it's been done before and  it's available in countless history books. His version of Jeanne is more  fictitous than any others and he was aiming for something different. Milla  Jovovich and Vincent Cassell (my favorite actress and favorite actor) were  both incredibly awesome in this movie and give great performences. Milla  played Jeanne just right as no one has ever imagined before (besides, no  one knows what she was actually like, anyone who did is now dead). Another  thing is the battle scenes. They are superb and give a good example of what  the battles might have been like. So if you enjoy movies that move you (not  caring if the history is right or not) this movie is for you. I absolutely  love it.",961027200,4,913,4.65
16796,5,0767839129,"My complete review of this film is on my personal page and elsewhere here  (I was one of the first to review it). Most of the other reviews carry all  the opinions people have of this movie. Here's just some trivia:
This is  the second time John Malkovich has played a role in a costume drama  previously played by Jose Ferrer. Mr. Ferrer played the Dauphin in  ""Joan of Arc"" with Ingrid Bergman, and they both played an older  Athos the Musketeer, Malkovich in ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" and  Ferrer in ""The 5th Musketeer.""",959904000,,524,4.395833333333333
16797,4,0767839129,"For the most part, this movie surprised me with how well it was done. The costumes and the battle scenes are well thought out and the storyline lends a not-so-subtle ambiguity to Joan's ""holy quest"". She is left  wondering if God really has spoken to her. Did God tell her to drive the  English out of France, or was it her desire for attention that drives her  crusade?
Fans of Luc Besson will like this film for its modern-day  approach to a medieval story, and its oft-misunderstood protagonist. With  that said, I think that some of the imagery goes way ""over the  top"" for the period piece it is attempting to represent. I was left  wishing that Joan's visions were shown with more subtlety and respect for  the viewer. Overall, the story is interesting, but its exposition is  heavy-handed. The featurette on the DVD explains the incredible amount of  detail-oriented research that went into the film - research which is often  undermined by blazing, colorful, thoroughly-modern hallucinations. I really  wanted a good, cohesive story of Joan-of-Arc. With a little subtlety, this  could have been a highly rewarding movie. There are still great themes to  be had in this film, but you'll have to get past Besson's flair for  exhibitionism if you want to explore them.",959731200,,1273,4.855813953488372

Anyways, the  acting in this movie was horrible, Joans character was so un-charismatic  that I would have a hrad time believing that an Army of women would follow  her to the mall, yet alone an army of men following her into battle!",959558400,5,439,4.265060240963855
16799,2,0767839129,"If two great film artists, Carl-Theodore Dreyer and Robert Bresson, saw fit to restrict their talents to Joan of Arc's ""passion"" and ""trial,"" then what on earth Luc Bresson thought he could do with  her whole story is sheer megalomania.  An action film director, he simply  hasn't the skill to capture one of history's greatest enigmas on film -  even with a large budget and an international cast.  And he is clearly  besotted with Milla Jovovich - else why would he cast her in The Fifth  Element as 'the perfect human?'  She is so out of her depth in this role  that she's embarrassing to watch - turning poor Joan into a complete  neurotic.  The film suggests that the real puzzle of history is not that  Joan of Arc led a French army into battle - and won - but that the Dauphin  and his ministers actually permitted this apparent nut case to do so.  She  obviously hadn't the imagination - neither did Besson - to look deeply into  this young woman's soul and find something authentic - like a 15th-century  peasant girl made so ecstatic by her visions and voices (made ridiculous in  the movie) that she convinced enough of her countrymen that she was sent to  liberate them.  I can think of maybe two or three living actresses who  could pull it off, but they're far too old to play a 19-year-old.  Viewers  should purchase the newly restored and gloriously remastered Passion of  Joan of Arc to get glimpses of what art can do with the enigma of Joan.",959472000,21,1460,4.505747126436781

16801,5,0767839129,"Yeah, what? That we have gone so far? It's that democracy? Ok, everyone has different thougts and opinions about historical persons, but why then you don't say honestly 'Shame on you, Besson, it's not my imagination of  Joan!'? And the same shame on official critics - you don't like Besson, you  don't like reality and etics in entertainment, becauce you can't eat  popcorn then during the movie - and you better singing one song - our Joan  is better than your Joan (reference to US mini-series, I can't judge that  movie, because I haven't seen it yet). So, what is this!  Personally I  wonder how powerful are official critics in US - it's looks like only very  few people nowadays has personal decision to watch or not to watch in  america. Ok, so far about culture of criticism (Don't take me wrong, I'm  also not so right sometimes, but I'm trying to avoid this). About other  arguments for or against... It's seems that movie is plaqued by Besson's  antifans out there. In fact, he tried to avoid this. I can rewrite all  history how he tried to make this movie more comprehensible for larger  group of watchers, you must get this info first. Critics in US actually  already knew, that they will ridicule this movie before official release.  Why? Because of the same old problems - Besson's conflict with US movie  industry. At start, he wanted to be producer of this movie. But call in  director (woman, forgot her name) didn't like even 'sweeter' version of  Messenger. She came back to US and already prepeared place for stake for  this movie. Then Besson desided to make this movie a masterpiece as he  wants, not a hybrid of art and sweet entertainment. Okey, okey... who reads  it skips on this. You are more interested about my thougts about movie,  right? Go on. I will review DVD and in same time one paragraph about idea  of movie. First, personally who like this movie, buy DVD version now (I  suggest International Extended)! Perfect picture, sound, lot of add-ons,  nothing more to add and nothing to take away! Personally I'm very happy,  because I see that it's sells rather well. DVD International Extended  version includes full version of movie, how I saw it in cinema, widescreen  (it's rulles), Anamorphic Video, Subtitles in English (sometimes voices are  so silent :)), some trailers for movie and other titles and impressive  documental about how they made this miracle. Ups, also Isolated Music Score  (You can turn it off). But... where is my opinion about movie? First, I  must remeber some guys that no one movie, nor just documental, simply CAN'T  BE TRUE AS WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND. These speaks about historical inacuracy  is something like fig-leaf for those who simply didn't catch it or simply  didn't like Besson's version (that's normal, but then say honesly - don't  like it. point). There can't be historical acuracy if we speak about real  person who lived about 550 years ago, even so difficult and so 'legenda' as  Joan. Besson tried to be honest, but it's seems that to be honest and to  show people what they want to see is almost inpossible. That's why there  are such stupid things like heorism and legendarism in our society. We can  only try to imagine history, but by rules - try to create that feeling of  middle ages, those situations, battles, not to simply follow 'historical  accuracy'. Second, Besson is still faithful to ideas of humanity. He done  it in '5th Element', he done it again in 'Joan or Arc'. Yes, how lot of  positive reviewers pointed out, Joan in Besson's version is a Human. Human  can look like mad, saint, it can cry, hope, blame, feel hate, despair,  everything you can imagine. Sadly, it's seems to me that most of negative  reviewers simply waited for another empty, blood and glory epic movie, done  by hollywood standarts. In this case, i can join their resume - there is  nothing in such way. They don't want human feelings, they want to see  Trueman's Show. And in the last, Besson plays a trick with watchers in  positive meaning - he make us understand that no one can escape from inner  fight, pain, doubts. Mostly I think lot of people didn't like that way how  'weak' is human, when it's suffers from pain, sorrow, what later turns to  hate, that there is one, easy step from clear mind to crazyness (something  alien and must be wrong, right? - ironical ps)...
At final - best movie I  have ever seen (by both means - ideological and cinemathographical).  Suggested for everyone, even if you think you won't like it. Give it a  try!
I can give marks: Visual looking & effects - 10 of 10 (there's  NO computer effects, trust me, only visual fx) Acting - 9 of 10 (Milla -  you are better actress than model!

16804,4,0767839129,"The bottom line here is that nobody knows what made Joan tick.  We can deduce  from her actions and her trial that she was a very complicated young woman, but  beyond that it's open to interpretation.  Was she insane?  - What about her  predictions?  Or possessed? - I for one can't even  imagine what that really means.  Perhaps she was just very impressionable  and instead of monsters under her bed she  saw angels?  That she was well  schooled in current political affairs I think we can  rule out.
The movie  had several inaccuracies the most disturbing of which was the rape  scene.  It seemed to have been done to rationalize her motives and was completely  unnecessary. (Save that for the rape of Boudicca's daughters or something  factual,  for the scene was effective, if loathsome.)  Also, the last half  hour of redemption,  justification and explanation with her  ""vision"" was utterly uninteresting.
That aside, Milla Jovovich  was brilliant and convincing.  She certainly portrayed a  very strong  willed, confused and angry girl capable of controlling an army.  The fact  that she came close to tears at all the bloodshed didn't contradict  anything.  We can't  forget that this was still a child in very unusual  circumstances. Without Milla the movie  would have been so-so.",959040000,2,1291,4.985714285714286
16805,4,0767839129,"First of all, I don't remember much of what I learned about Joan of Arc in school. And after seeing this movie I don't feel like I know that much more. Actually some bells are ringing in the back of my head, indicating  that some of the elements aren't historically correct. Well, so some  liberties have been taken in the storytelling, but I was still entertained,  and that is usually the point in seeing a movie by Luc Besson.
This  version of the story of the famous warrior saint (or was she just crazy?)  is definitely the most colourful one ever made. Milla Jovovich generally  does a good job playing the part of Joan. Sometimes she's absolutely  brilliant, but other times the performance is not that convincing. I take  it that this is because of her having to work with Besson right after their  divorce. But speculations aside, the movie still turned out pretty great.  Generally the acting is quite superb, and the visuals are gorgeous,  something which has become a trademark of Besson. But like other  postmodernistic directors, he seems to focus more on the packaging than the  content. The script never really goes in-depth with the internal struggle  of Joan of Arc, and might be more suited for a regular action movie.
Still the visuals and the acting make the film worthwhile, but if you  want to see a historically accurate version of the legend, steer well clear  of this.
As it is, this can best be described as ""Joan of Arc Light:  the film that tastes sweet, but won't make your intellect fatter.""",958953600,2,1522,4.661654135338346
16806,1,0767839129,"There are so many things wrong with this movie, I'm not quite sure where to begin!  I guess I could start with historical accuracy.  I knew trouble was abrewin' when I found out that John Malkovich was playing the French  King Charles, who was actually only 19 years old!  Lots of silly,  fictitious stuff was added about the various people at court who supposedly  convinced Charles to betray Joan. And one of Joan's big motivations was  shown to be the rape and murder of her sister, which has no basis in  fact.
Second major problem:  Acting.  Joan was played as if she were  constantly about to fall down sobbing and have a nervous breakdown.  She  came across as a total nutcase.  There's no way anyone would have followed  Joan if  she acted the way she was portrayed here.
There were also many  unintentionally funny parts.  I  tried hard not to laugh out loud when  Dustin Hoffman popped up as Joan's conscience mouthing the most ludicrous  dialogue you can imagine.
I could go on and on, but instead, I'll  recommend that instead of this movie, you should watch the old silent  version called The Passion of Joan of Arc.  That one will affect you and  haunt your memory (in a good way) for a long time.",958694400,64,1211,4.52093023255814

The  photography is stunning, the battles are exhilarating.  And yet the movie  falls short because of the poor presentation.  There was no real  connection, flow, or even story line between the battle sequences and her  dream sequences.  The editing fell short in tying the remarkable individual  elements into one sensible theme.

The way that Milla potrayed Joan  was on my account moving to the point where it has pushed me in new heights  with my beliefs about God and how I react on a whole. She showed a Joan of  Arc that was a teen, a loyal follower of God, and a fighter till the end.  She poytrayed a Joan that in my opinion is a role model in the fact that  she practiced what she preached, followed her heart and faith until the  very end of her life.  The only part of the movie I really didn't like  was the rape scene really made me sick. The fact that they put that in  there and it didn't really happen was kinda disturbing.

16819,4,0767839129,"Before viewing this movie I'd recommend spending 24 minutes watching the documentary on the making of the movie. The background given will greatly improve the appreciation of the movie itself. We are taken around the parts  of France where Joan herself lived, and shown the buildings she lived in  and where the events shown in the movie actually happened. We are shown a  document signed by Joan that is 570 years old - WOW! For myself, it was  fascinating to see these ancient buildings and relics which without a doubt  helped me to better appreciate the actual movie. There is also info on the  100s of suits of armour and 1000s of costumes made that were as true to the  originals of that era as possible. They did this by taking the designs and  patterns for the costumes and armour from old tapestries and  paintings.
The performance of Milla Jovovich as Joan of Arc was brilliant  except near the end of the film where she perhaps overdid the ""poor,  nervous and bewildered Joan"" bit! I'd have given the movie five stars  if it wasn't for this. One point that I found inspiring is the way the film  showed how just one simple young peasant girl, deeply pious and obedient to  the call of God on her life could change the history of France, and perhaps  ultimately that of Europe itself. I don't know how intentional it was, but  what struck me was the way Joan feared disobeying God far more than she  feared offending the pompous and arrogant civil and religious powers of her  day. What wasn't made clear (perhaps because no-one really knows for  certain) is exactly how Joan heard the voices which told her what to do, so  we are treated to spooky wind noises, cloud scenes, bangs of thunder and  some guy in a stone chair in a wood!  Surely there must have been a better  way of showing her hearing ""The Voices?""
I titled this review  as Stunning and outstanding - and so it was. The picture quality is superb  as is the Dolby 5.1 Surround which is very powerful and rich in low  frequencies.

The movie doesn't portray war as ""fun"" as it did not take away of the  gruesome parts of medieval wartimes. Even some of the medieval war machines  (porcupine, tailor spin...) are portrayed very accurately. The Actors are  very efficient in their roles as they portray the medieval mentality to the  best of our understanding.
My only drawback to this movie is the visions  of Joan of Arc as they seem to be needlessly stretched and done  deliberately to confuse the audience. they could have easily cut them back  by half without taking from the story.
Did Joan of Arc really have  visions from God? Maybe it doesn't matter. What matters is that SHE  believed she did and the people of France believed it also. This changed  the entire face of the England-France war.",957916800,4,903,4.694267515923567

She really did seem crazy -- whispering half  the time (when she wasn't screaming her head off), eyes wide, seeing  things. I'm pretty sure those are the actions of a crazy person. And she  wasn't crazy. It would seem that one of the most prayed to saint in the  world would be given a little more credit, wouldn't you think?

When she approches the doufer of France she realizes her destiny is all the more closer after she passes a test to see who the real doufer is , she tells him about her visons that she is to lead the French army into battle at Orleaon they will take the castle underseige and with Joan they hope to gain the victory to crown there King.
 The battle scenes realistic and grousome and precise of the way this battle was and this film shows the scale and tragedy of battle. Avoiding a full scale war with the english she speaks her mind ...but when Joan wants to complete her mission the French don't want any part of giving her another army. The French would rather solve affairs with diplomacy but when she decides to fight she is captured and charged with treasen and called anything from a witch to a herotic she stood trial and after the trial she was sentenced to be burned to death at the stake in front of thousands of people.

Luc Besson's movies are always interesting  to watch with beautiful cinematography & French flair. But this latest  offering, despite it still shares those traits, it could become  disillusioned at times.  I couldn't stand Milla Jovovich running around the  set screaming her head off.  If I were one of her soldiers, I wouldn't be  inspired by her at all to fight for France.  Rather, the English looked  more like those civilised type.  With due respect, Milla is not a bad  actress after seeing her in the Fifth Element & her minor role as the  prostitute in You've Got Game with Denzel Washington.  So, the decision for  her to depict Joan as that mad woman is questionable.  The part of her  arguing with her conscience acted by Dustin Hoffman is like watching X  Files, you want to know the truth but the truth you shall not find.  At  times, I just wished that she could be burned & done with so that I  could get on with life.  Well, a completely forgettable film & I  wouldn't dream of watching it one more time, just like putting myself over  a guillotine.

Besson tries to impress  grandeur with a heavy hand and overblown performances from his cast.  I  felt badly that Faye Dunaway had anything to do with this piece of trash.  John Malkovich, however, progressively chooses roles not really suited for  his style of acting and he sticks out like an English lance in this movie.

16828,5,0767839129,"I hardly ever compose and publish reviews of any sort around here...but due to the maligning of this movie by a number of other reviewers, I feel compelled to step in and speak a few words to counterbalance theirs, not to antagonise, but simply to give a review from the Orleans' side of the  river, if I may use the metaphor.
It is an irrefutable fact among nearly  all movie-goers that Braveheart set the standard by which all other epic  medieval war movies are judged. It was inevitable and unavoidable that  reviewers would not compare The Messenger to Braveheart. I, however,  believe that it is imperative to evaluate a movie on its own merit, not on  its comparison with Braveheart. I love Braveheart. I will always love  Braveheart. But I don't think it's fair to compare it with The Messenger.  Therefore I will try my best henceforth to avoid references to  Braveheart.
The Messenger's timing was unfortunate. NBC's Joan of Arc was  released barely half a year before, and The Messenger has therefore been  thought of by some as ""oh, boy, another Joan of Arc movie"". To  those who would speak thus, I would like to know whether you have seen both  and are therefore in any sort of position to even begin to condemn The  Messenger as an inferior or a repetitive movie. I, for one, have not seen  enough of NBC's film to make a judgement, so I will also refrain from  comparing these two films throughout the remainder of the review.
Now  that I have put forth a few important points to discourage prejudice, I  will discuss the merit of the film itself.
Where to begin, where to  begin.
As others before me have said (so I will not dwell on this point  too long), the movie is quite impressive visually. Thousands and thousands  of weapons, armour suits, mitres and other items of religious clothing, and  many other medieval garments were custom-made for this movie with an eye  toward period accuracy. I am not as well read as I desire to be on the  Hundred Years' War, but my impressions are that the costumes' and weapons'  historical realism is quite sound.
A lot of work went into the battle  choreography, obviously, and I was most impressed with Marshall Gilles de  Rais' well-coordinated use of a pair of morning stars in the battle to take  the Tourelles, a French citadel across the river from Orleans which the  English captured earlier in the campaign.
Speaking of the Tourelles, I  was very pleased with the portrayal of the siege and taking of the fortress  in this movie. Never before in a film have I seen a siege presented in such  detail. The cinematography and acting throughout that battle was  particularly impressive. One could almost feel the nervousness and even  fear of the English defenders as the French assailed the Tourelles' great  walls. They seemed so safe in their fortress, but once the French rallied  under Joan, who had recently recovered from an arrow wound, the English  knew this juggernaut posed a real threat to them. And when the outer walls  were breached, well, all who could retreated in fear into the Tourelles'  keep. But even there they were not safe from the staunch and resolute  French, and several of the Englishmen lost their cool during the  fight.
But I degress. I merely wish to relate the vividness of the siege  and the feeling that it was real, that those were real men fighting for  their lives, fighting for their freedom...or dominance.
Another  impressive bit about the siege was the number of primitive but interesting  defensive mechanisms the English used to protect themselves. Of greatest  note was the porcupine, a spring-loaded arrow launching battery that  simultaneously fired volleys of fifty or so arrows through murder holes in  the Tourelles keep's gate to discourage attack upon it.
But enough of  warfare and such, for there is so much more to this movie than  that.
Character development was absolutely wonderful. Aside from Joan,  Charles, Charles' mother-in-law Yolande D'Aragon, and The Conscience, the  characters of most import in this film were the French officers and  noblemen with whom Joan served. Each had a certain personality, certain  traits. There was Dunois, the battle-hardened and pessimistic lord who had  been holding Orleans together ere Joan's arrival. There was the Duke de  Alenon, the rich, roguish, and most gung-ho member of the French generals,  he who ""always votes to attack."" There was La Hire, the massive  Goliath of the French, who possessed the roudiest manner of all the  generals and was often reprimanded by Joan for cursing.
Joan herself was  brilliantly portrayed. I've never seen Milla Jovovich in anything else  before, so I had a wonderful first impression, having seen her in this  film. Joan's was a unique character, an interesting mix of child-like  naivety, firm assertiveness, and then downright aggression. In the heat of  battle she was a screaming banshee of a warrior, but when she is alone in  her cell after being captured by Bergundians and given to the English with  no one but herself, she becomes unsure, meek, even fearful. With all the  adrenaline during the battles, she has one clear objective and believes  that the means to reach that goal are justified by the goal itself. But  alone in her cell with The Conscience, she begins to question the ways she  has followed for the last two years, the ways of blood and steel. And  finally, with the help of The Conscience, she comes to realise her wrongs,  her immoralities, her flaws. Her transformations throughout the movie are  quite remarkable",956880000,3,5550,4.84631803628602
16829,4,0767839129,"The idea that every person of faith in the past needs to be 'demythologized' by a modern enlightned director is alive and well.  Like Scorsese's 'Last Temptation of Christ', this film presents what some call a  'more human' Joan.  That is, one that can be understood without making any  real reference at all to a messy, impolite God who does not deign to make  all his actions sensible to us.  For provoking thought with this humanist  version of Joan, I'll give this movie 4 stars.  But for playing too fast  and loose with the actual historical facts, I'll hold one star back.  yes,  I know it's only a movie.  But the liberty's taken are so crucial to the  real story that they must not be discounted.
1. Joan's older sister  Catherine was never raped and killed by Engilsh soldiers.  Besson presents  this mythical event and the trauma induced by it to explain Joan's hatred  of the english and explain why perhaps her mind became unbalanced enough to  believe she was some sort of divine messenger.
2.  Joan and La Hire,  the French Captain, ended the siege of Orleans by crossing the Loire river  on horses by boat, and then when the English began to pursue some  retreating French Soldiers, Joan and La Hire unexpectedly charged, causing  what became a panicked retreat.  This is what caused the siege to be  broken, not Joan leaping alone into the enemy camp itself and  singlehandedly cutting a rope to open the gate.
3.  Joan never left her  parents.  Indeed, her brothers rode with her on her campaigns, and her  father and mother were there at the crowning of Charles, King of France.
4.  There is no record that Joan was ever beaten or physically assaulted  as is depicted in the film.  They may have burned her at the stake, but  there is no record she was knocked about like this.
4.  When Joan was  burned at the stake, she requested of several churchmen who did not agree  with her sentence and were sympathetic to her that they hold a cross up  high where she could see it, so that her last earthly sight would be of the  cross of her Lord. She also cried the name of Jesus more than once as she  burned. This is different from the depiction of this event, where Joan  seems to die silently in terror as some churchmen seem to mock her by  waving a cross up where she can see it.

I saw this  movie after the NBC mini-series, which I was disappointed with, so this one  I had high expectations for.  The NBC mini-series was good but there was no  emotion shown in the Joan character, not good at all.

The main problem appears to stem from the lack of realism, it is simply not sufficiently believable for a historical epic.
Jovovich is not remotely convincing as a leader of men, showing  neither charisma nor divinity. She's just plain mental.
John Malkovich  is totally miscast as the young King, and quite why Dustin Hoffman's part  exists at all is a mystery.
The battle scenes are visually impressive  but  show us only the spectacular gore, and none undoubted horror and fear  of the battlefield. Five invincible nobles cutting a bloody swathe through  dozens of doomed English Knights and foot soldiers would be more at home in  a Conan film than a historical epic.
And the accents? Although nowhere  near the farce that The Man In the Iron Mask was, the mixture just doesn't  work. English and Americans playing Frenchmen share dialogue with Frenchmen  playing Frenchmen and we end up with a compromised mess. The only way to  tell identify who's supposed to  be English is that they have as yet  undiscovered Northern English dialects and swear.
On the positive side,  Faye Dunaway is good, as are all the French cast.
I can't help thinking  that had this been made in French with a French cast, a more subtle Joan  and more realism in battle, it could have been a great film.

The  battle scenes were awesome, the humor, if full of colloquialisms, was good  but not overdone, and the acting was solid if not great.  My biggest  complaint is one that I am finding more and more in recent movies.  At some  points, the beautiful panoramic scenes which work so well on the big screen  backfire on TV screens...for example, when Jeanne is running across the  fields in the beginning, she is barely visible as a little speck on a  big-screen TV.

16847,3,0767839129,"This is a rather irreverent and disturbing look at the life of Saint Joan of Arc. The portrayal of her early life was very good, giving her a sincerity and piety that made the child Joan an attractive character.  However, once Milla Jovovich took over as the teen Joan, she became a  raving lunatic. Clearly, this was no accident. She and director Luc Besson  are husband and wife, and it is obvious that this is their combined  interpretation of Joan.
The problem with this portrayal was that Joan was  made to be appear so demented that she lost credibility as a believable  character. Her belief in her voices was depicted more as mad fanaticism  than unshakeable faith. Personally, I have no problem with this  interpretation, since I am more apt to believe her voices were the result  of an unbalanced psyche than the voice of God. The problem I have is  believing that anyone, even in the 15th century, would give an army to  someone who is so obviously over the edge. Moreover, it is a stretch to  believe that even the most desperate of simple minded men would follow such  a character into battle.
If the portrayal were just a little more  balanced, with moments of piety, sincerity and lucidity, the viewer and the  other characters around her might be justified in saying, `Is she divinely  inspired or simply mad?' Only when that question resonates has Joan been  portrayed effectively. In this interpretation there was never any question.  She was clearly a madwoman. It was almost a relief when they finally did  away with her.
That being said, I must say that from a technical  standpoint this was a brilliantly directed film. Luc Besson has produced a  compelling visual work of art. The opening scenes of young Joan running  through the fields were exquisite. The battle carnage was authentically  grisly and the action realistic. The costumes were wonderful and the  locations and sets well chosen and well crafted. His camera perspectives  gave great impact to every scene. His imagary of supernatural events was  electrifying. In every regard, other than Joan's character interpretation,  this was an inspired work.
Milla Jovovich gave a superb performance as  Joan The Mad. Though I don't agree with the interpretation, I can't imagine  such insanity delivered any more effectively. She really seemed well suited  for a jacket with wrap around sleeves. In every scene she exuded white hot  intensity, especially in the battle scenes. Her performance was truly tour  de force.
Faye Dunaway was fabulous as the cunning Yolande D'Aragon. She  was so nefarious and in control, deliciously evil and conniving.
John  Malkovich did an excellent job portraying Charles VII, however he was a bit  old for the part. Charles was born in 1403 and met Joan in 1429 at the  tender age of 26. Malkovich has trouble passing for 46 (his actual age) no  less 26.
Dustin Hoffman's minor role as the conscience was also quite  well done. Unfortunately, it lost some effectiveness because he was never  really put in context. Was he another of Joan's creations or an actual  being? A little defining dialogue would have helped develop his character  better.
This is a fine film with a fatal flaw. If the story is to work,  Joan must be a beloved heroine. In this portrayal, she does not endear  herself to the viewer. Contrarily, she is a disturbing and off-putting  character. For this reason I rated it a 7/10, though it easily qualified as  a filmmaking 9 or 10.",955929600,67,3465,4.837883959044369
16848,2,0767839129,"I have seen three films based on the life of Joan of Arc, the Ingrid Bergman film from the late 1940's, the video verison of the recent mini-series and this one, and this is, by far, the worst of the three.  Historically, it is a farce, (Joan did in fact have a sister named  Catherine, but she was not in any way harmed by the English, in fact,  Joan's village apparently only suffered one minor raid during the entire  war)...Bishop Cauchon, far from wanting to ""save Joan's soul"" was  the spearhead of the plot to completly discredit her and have her burned.  Neither did she sign with an ""X""one of her letters to the English  garrisons around Orleans still survives in a museum and the  signature,Jeanne, which is what she called herself is plain...All period  sources agree on how even tempered she was, becoming upset only on very  rare occasions.  The Joan of this film seems closer to a lunatic than the  peasant girl who led an army. I will admit that the costuming is superb, as  good as any I have ever seen. Joan's spiritual side in this film is almost  non-existent, shown only by her requests to hear Mass during her  imprisonment.

As far as  historical accuracy, the only thing that had any semblance to fact was Joan  always going to confession.  The visions weren't correct, the characters  were so poorly conceived they were comical.
Bottom line, if you know  nothing about Joan of Arc and would like to learn more, don't watch this  movie.  If you want to see this character portrayed in a realistic manner  and very close to what we know about her historically, don't watch this  movie.

16852,2,0767839129,"NOW what? For the life of me, I can't imagine why Besson thought that the world needed (yet) another Joan of Arc movie. The ""real"" Joan wasn't even considered important in France until the 1800's, when her story  was resurrected (and embellished - current scholarship doubts whether  Orleans was actually under siege at all!) But (sigh), he decided to give it  his *treatment*, and this is what we end up with: two and a half hours of  his wife (and ""Leeloo"" from ""The Fifth Element"")  alternately screaming, shrieking, or whimpering in the face of anyone who  happens to be standing by. The scrolling text at the opening of the film  was illegible and flipped by so quickly no one could read it, not that it  seemed to matter. Any ""plot"" is sublimated to the ""art""  - gorgeous photography, lush scenery, and realistically violent battle  scenes. Warning - this is serious stuff, not a candied-up rendition of  medieval warfare. Back in those days, you took out your enemy not by  gunfire, but by debilitating them in as serious fashion as possible,  including maces, axes, the ubiquitous swords, and some even less pleasant  and graphically-demonstrated methods. But along the way, Besson loses  whatever guiding vision originally prompted him to make this film.  Characters start to answer questions with ""Whatever"", the  Dauphine (John Malkovich playing the usual invertebrate) seems less  interested in being King than he is in where the cast party will be, Faye  Dunaway snaps and snarls in a puzzling way (one minute she's Joan's biggest  patron, only to turn on her with no discernable motivation), and in one of  the BIGGEST casting bloopers in the last half of the 20th century, Dustin  Hoffman shows up looking like a retread Obi Wan Kenobe, sounding like  Dustin Hoffman, and is supposed to be ""The Conscience""  (apparently because the gaping plot holes required SOME sort of cinematic  asphalt to keep the audience at least partially ""in"" on what is  supposed to be transpiring). This is certainly the most serious problem  with the movie: if Hoffman is intended to be a sort of mental foil ,  voicing Joan's inner doubts, he certainly takes his time in making his  presence known. If the movie is intended to illuminate Joan's  ""human"" aspects (as opposed to her spiritual side), then  three-quarters of the film is wasted on one battle scene after another with  nary a glimmer of self-doubt or moral questioning. Buckets of blood, to be  sure.
No, this isn't the ""thinking man's Joan"" by a looooong  shot. The film is irritatingly anachronistic (see ""whatever""),  and crippled by  hopelessly befuddled motivations and seriously  one-dimensional acting by people who should know better AND by the lead,  but in her case, being the director's current ""significant other""  must have gone a long way. Besson's fans will appreciate the cinematography  and the hyper-kinetic pacing of so many scenes, but those with a taste for  subtlety, or serious philosophic enquiries, or even historical accuracy  will find the two and a half hour length about an hour too long.",955324800,,3074,4.982248520710059

The Messenger: The Story of Joan of  Arc, is a brilliant example of such a film, combining stunning visuals and  a talented cast to bring the epic story of the infamous story of the Maid  of Loraine to life. Milla Jovovich plays Joan, and the cast choice was  impeccable. Her ability to change moods from exhilarated to infuriated, and  from strong to terrified, truly make the performance believable. Her  visions of the saints and heavenly beings are absolutely gorgeous and  totally mesmerizing, cutting from shot to shot of different things  surrounding her as she experiences them. Battle scenes are filmed from both  sides' viewpoints, and the beauty of it is that 99.9% of all things  contained are believable. I'm not that big a fan of the score, though (to  anyone in my english or yearbook classes, I bet you're surprised to hear  thast one, huh?), and I think that it will have to grow on me before I buy  the album. But all-in-all, this movie is great, andone that will remain in  the mind for long periods after watching it.",955324800,,1221,4.671361502347418
16854,3,0767839129,"This movie had excellent sets and costume design. The acting is good, the character build up was good for some characters. The fight scenes were almost as good as Braveheart. The script was very modern, with phrases like  booty. The film dragged a little at some points and could have used some  more trimming. The ending was kind of empty in its simplicity. A lot of the  story is based on assumption, so don't expect a history lesson. Worth  renting but I personally wouldn't buy it.",955324800,,485,4.604651162790698
16855,3,0767839129,"Luc Besson looks now as a man with the Midas touch  surprised for the first time in his life by the result. The thing he'd touched did not turn to gold but to something less valuable - something more like copper.
I  was stunned by Nikita - no one was expecting such a cool and modern action  movie from a French director. Professional was much more kitschy but still  enjoyable. The Fifth Element's visuals were so exciting no one really cared  about the content and just enjoyed the extravaganza.
Now it seems Luc  Besson was carried away and decided he can create a masterpiece just from a  scrap - from his girlfriend's photo to be exact(see the DVD's  leaflet).
He employs and directs the team of very skillful cameramen and  costume designers, gets the adequate funding - it's easy for the most  popular French director planning to tell the story of the most famous  French heroine - employs the most handsome French actors and invites some  Americans. Like an experienced pyrotechnic he puts together the fabulous  fireworks expecting them to burst in the sky in many-colored blaze.
What  we have instead? Psssshhhhhhhhhick.
Why?
Obviously Luc Besson has  nothing to say about Joan of Arc.  He had no coherent idea to express -  just action, design and music.
There are 3 definite parts in the film -  The Visions, The Battle, The Trial.
When he feels one more vision would  be one too much Luc Besson lets the battle begin. Battle scenes are a genre  in themselves, they can hold the viewer's attention with the gory action  and display of curious war machines, weaponry and armour. But after an hour  it all began to look too much. That is 101th time we are shown ""The  True Face Of War"" in recent years, all these crows pecking dead flesh  and oozing bloody limbs lying all over are something we expect to see -  their's shocking potential is exhausted.
What's next ? The Trial. Nothing  memorable here. Dustin Hoffman contributed his name to the film's posters  and DVD covers. I am sure it helped to sell hundreds thousand of tickets  and copies extra, but the role is just ridiculous. Hoffman in gray beard  and hooded robe looks barely recognizable  - his best disguise since  Tootsie. In a sadistic monotone he is stubbing the girl with his stupid and  pretentious questions.
By the way - no doubt that was a fashion these  days but Faye's shaven forehead makes her look so much like RoboCop I could  not concentrate on her words - just enjoyed the unexpected  similarity.
But! I think that Milla is perfectly cast. Of course first of  all she is a model, but do we need a Meryl Streep for the role of young  peasant girl, the messenger, the medium? And the girl is so suitably  androginous yet sexy, great to look at  - since the film is obviously not  ""serious"" I'd prefer to see Milla in a leading role, not someone  with richer inner life but not-so-perfect body.
Besides, she is a fellow  Slav. Any French actress with Gallic calculated charm and sophistication  could not be credible in her fervour.
The dialogues are contemporary.  When I saw Joan stopping her adjutant on his way out of her chamber to ask  for a hairdresser I was struck by the realisation that Ms. Jovovich in her  The Ritz suite would communicate with a valet in exacctly the same  tone,with the same gesture.
Most of the reasoning and the concepts worded  are clearly does not belong to the Middle Ages.
Music is so predictable  you hear just what you expect to hear.
And the burning scene is so  abrupt! I did not plan to contemplate the death throes, but to finish the  160-minutes long film in the 2-minute haste...
Still I can not call the  movie a complete flop. There are some images - Milla with boyish face  and  man's haircut on her white horse, raising the banner,etc - that will stay  in public consciousness. And I was not bored watching the film.
Yes, it  could be much better, but still it's definitely worth seeing. I've even  bought the DVD - to continue my Luc Besson collection - but I hope the next  addition will be more rewarding.",955324800,,4043,4.582633053221288
16856,5,0767839129,"MILLA - THE REAL - ""MESSENGER""
WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A FILM ABOUT MOTIVATIONS. WHY DO WE DO THE THINGS WE DO? SINCE IT DOES ACTUALLY ANSWER THIS QUESTION AND RESOLVES THIS HUMAN DILEMMA - THIS FACT MAKES IT, NOT NECESSARILY THE BEST FILM, BUT NOTHING LESS THAN THE MOST IMPORTANT FILM OF OUR TIME, OR OF ALL TIME FOR THAT MATTER.
I'M NOT WELL READ ENOUGH ON JOAN'S HISTORY TO KNOW OF ITS ACCURACY OR NOT, BUT WHO CARES, THAT IS NOT THE MESSAGE OF ""THE MESSENGER"".
I ALSO DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PERSONAL LIFE OF THE WRITER-DIRECTOR LUC BESSON OTHER THAN HE USE TO BE MARRIED TO MILLA JOVOVICH THE STAR OF HIS FILM. I DON'T KNOW HOW RELIGIOUS OR SPIRITUAL HE IS, OR EVEN IF HE COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDS WHAT HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED HERE, BUT HE MUST ALREADY BE A FRIEND OF GOD'S OR WELL ON HIS WAY TO UNDERSTANDING OR ENLIGHTENMENT OR HAVING HIS ""MOMENT"" WITH GOD. WHAT HE HAS MANAGED TO GET ON FILM IS ONLY THE ANSWER TO THE AGE OLD QUESTION - WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE ! - AND WITH NOT ONE SCINTILLA OR TRACE OF PREACHINESS OR RELIGIOSITY - JUST A SEARCH FOR TRUTH. HIS JOAN WRESTLES WITH SUCH IMPORTANT ETERNAL ISSUES TILL UNDERSTANDING, CONVICTION, AND RESOLUTION THROUGH HER GOD.
EVERYBODY BELIEVED IN JESUS BACK THEN, BUT NOT EVERY SOUL HAD IT OUT WITH HIM OR HAD THEIR ""MOMENT"" WITH HIM AS WE SEE JOAN DO IN THE FILM.
THERE IS SUCH A WIDE RANGE OF OPINIONS EVIDENT AS TO WHO DUSTIN HOFFMAN PLAYS IN THIS MOVIE, FROM JOAN'S cONSCIENCE TO THE devil. MY INTERPRETATION IS THAT DUSTIN PLAYED GOD, WITH, IN THIS CASE, THE TITLE OF, OR ROLE OF, HER CONSCIENCE WITH A CAPITAL ""C"". ONLY THE HOLY SPIRIT WOULD HAVE AN INTEREST IN BRINGING ONE TO A PLACE, THAT WE SEE IN THE FILM, OF CONVICTION, REPENTANCE, SUBMISSION AND CONFESSION. HE SHOWS HER (WE SHOULD ALL BE SO LUCKY - BUT NOW WITH THIS FILM, WE ARE) HER TRUE MOTIVATIONS OF REVENGE, GREED, JOY IN CRUELTY, AND WORST OF ALL PRIDE AND SHE IS CONVICTED AND SAYS -""SET ME FREE"". HOW COULD AN ALL LOVING GOD EXPECT ANY MORE FROM HIS CREATIONS, OR ANY LESS. THIS MOVIE IS A STUNNING AND BRILLIANT DEPICTION OF WHAT OUR CREATOR WANTS FROM US - TRANSACTIONS - AND/OR A RELATIONSHIP - OUR BEING HUNGRY ENOUGH FOR TRUTH AND ADMITTING IT WHEN WE SEE IT ABOUT OURSELVES AND ABOUT GOD - IN THAT WE ARE SCREWED UP AND ONLY HE HOLDS THE KEYS OF RESOLUTION (AND PAID THE PRICE, ON THE CROSS) FOR OUR SIN DILEMMA. I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS RELATIONSHIP SO BRILLIANTLY PORTRAYED SINCE ROBERT DUVALL IN ""THE APOSTLE"" - ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT FILM.
HOW ONE GUY LUC BESSON CAN GO FROM MAKING POSSIBLY THE WORST FILM I'VE EVER SEEN ""THE FIFTH ELEMENT"" TO POSSIBLY THE BEST IN ""THE MESSENGER"" MUST SAY SOMETHING OF HIS ARTISTRY, AND OF HIS RISK-TAKING. HE WAS BORN TO DELIVER THIS MESSAGE TO MANKIND IN THIS FILM ABOUT AN EARLY PROTESTANT. WHETHER HE REALIZES IT OR NOT HIS MESSAGE THROUGH MILLA IS VERY BIBLICAL. I DOUBT HE PRAYED FOR HELP AND GUIDANCE FROM GOD TO DELIVER A BIBLICAL MESSAGE WITHOUT BEING PREACHY, BUT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE HAS MANAGED TO DO IT, BY HAVING HIS CHARACTERIZATION OF JOAN SO DILIGENT IN HER QUEST FOR TRUTH - SHE BYPASSES THE STUPIDITY, HYPOCRISY AND DECEPTION OF ""religion"" AND GOES STRAIGHT TO GOD HERSELF AND HAS HER ""MOMENT"" OF GETTING REAL WITH GOD. NEVER BEFORE SEEN IN A MAJOR RELEASE BEFORE, THAT I'VE SEEN, OR CAN THINK OF,OFF HAND. THIS IS A MUST SEE FILM FOR ALL. I WATCHED THE CONFESSION SCENE WITH DUSTIN, (WHO IS GOD) SEVERAL TIMES WITH TEARS IN MY EYES. THEN EVENTUALLY BEFORE SHE IS MARTYRED HE HIMSELF GIVES HER THE ABSOLUTION SHE SO DESIRES.
LUC PROBABLY MADE A FILM HAVING HIS CHARACTER PERFORM THE WAY HE WISHES IT WER SO - ABOUT BYPASSING religion FOR FORGIVENESS AND ETERNAL MATTERS ETC. BUT BASED ON WHAT I'VE READ IN GOD'S BOOK - I WOULD SAY LUC HAS STUMBLED ON THE RIGHT FORMULA FOR HAVING PEACE WITH GOD AND GOING INTO ETERNITY WHICH WE WILL ALL HAVE TO FACE ONE DAY. I WONDER IF HE IS WELL READ IN THE BIBLE ENOUGH TO KNOW GOD HAS REALLY MADE IT JUST THAT SIMPLE. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME READ HIS BOOK FOR YOURSELF AND SEE. ADMIT THAT HE IS GOD AND YOU AIN'T AND ASK FOR WHAT HE OFFERS IN FORGIVENESS AND ETERNAL LIFE ETC. - AND HE WILL GIVE IT TO YOU. IT IS ALL SUCH A GOOD DEAL, I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY SO MANY CHOOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN GOD'S PROGRAM.
MILLA IS PERFECT FOR THIS PART AND BORN TO PLAY THIS ROLE WITH JUST THE RIGHT INTENSITY - I JUST HOPE AND PRAY SHE DOESN'T BURN OUT WITH ALL HER VICES BEFORE EVEN REACHING 30 - I'M AFRAID SHE FANCIES HERSELF THE NEXT MARILYN OR GIA ETC. - AND IS BENT ON SELF DESTRUCTION, BUT I HOPE SHE GROWS UP AND LIVES UP TO ALL THAT POTENTIAL TO DELIVER MANY OTHER MESSAGES FROM GOD FOR US, THROUGH HER MANY TALENTS.
RUN TO THE VIDEO STORE AND SEE THIS FILM AT ANY COST, OR BETTER YET CLICK THAT ONE CLICK BUTTON FROM AMAZON AND OWN IT YOURSELF ON DVD FOR ABOUT ONE THIRD OFF THE REGULAR STORE PRICES - AND THEN DO WHAT JOAN DEMONSTRATES AT THE END OF THE FILM - HAVE YOUR MOMENT WITH GOD AND ASK FOR WHAT HE OFFERS - IT'S ALL FREE AND EVEN CHEAPER THAN AMAZON.COM .

16857,4,0767839129,"I realize that everyone keeps comparing this to Braveheart...why? This is a totally different story. Jovovich did a spectacular job of portraying Joan. She was innocent and pure, yet crazed and wild. It was extremely  refreshing to see a woman warrior for a change and she pulled it off  amazingly. The movie was a bit dry in spots but honestly the ending was  worth the wait. Unlike the opinions of some others...I thought Hoffman was  brilliant...finally a portrayal of god with a touch of darkness. He makes  you fear him to some subtle extent. I was glad to see God shown in a shade  of grey as opposed to the always white and graceful appearance in most  films. I believe that this movie raises alot of questions as to how Joan of  Arc was deemed a Saint, if this enactment is accuate..and who knows...maybe  she wasn't as blessed as believed. I like movies that make you ask  questions and think. This movie did that for me.",955238400,,930,4.548192771084337
16858,4,0767839129,"For those not familiar with the real life story of Joan of Arc, and to be to the point she was THE girl who saved France from the English in 1431, and later she got captured and burned by the English. This film is based on  her life story and how she became the saviour of her country in the time of  crisis, The film start of when Joan (played by Milla Jovovich) is young and  for the next half and hour, you get to understand how Joan did what she did  later in the film. The middle section of the film involves 2 different  battle scenes, they are good, but not on the same league as Braveheart. The  last section of the film deals with Joan's trial by the English.  This film  is well put together by Luc Besson who also directed the Fifth Element and  Leon, the cinematography is great, the costume and backdrop are faithful to  the 15th century.
Milla Jovovich does a wonderful job in performing  Joan, she show the character's struggle against the non-believers  beautifully, other actors like John Malkovich and Dustin Hoffman also  shines in their part, Faye Dunaway is also brilliant in this film as the  mother in law of the King.
Although the fighting sequence is not as long  and as many as Braveheart, it does hold it's own. If you are looking for a  film on the line of Braveheart, then you are on the right track, but this  film deal a lot more in terms of the character Joan's emotion and struggle  more towards the end than expected, but as a whole you won't be  disappointed.",955152000,,1494,4.3478260869565215
16859,5,0767839129,"If you are going to watch this movie and truely enjoy it, you must keep an open mind. It is graphically beautiful ( the fight scenes are well done and emotional ), the acting unmatched, and the storyline neutral. The story  lets you think about what was actually going through Joan's head. Nobody  can really say, and the movie doesn't try to decide for us, which is  exactly why this movie is so great.
  It let's you use your imagination  while you watch. It's not very often you get to see something on TV, or in  the movies that makes you imagine, usually the director will do that for  you, and put it in the movie.
 The Messenger doesn't leave much to the  imagination only in spots where it wanted to make it's points, and show  pieces of history we CAN prove to be. The fight scenes are graphic, and  they show many weapons of war in that time ( trebuchet, mace, wall towers,  etc. ). It stops the imagination to inform and teach.
  This movie  disturbs people because it does a lot of things that take them out of their  comfort zone. To me, that makes it a classic in itself. A must buy if you  want to use your mind. If you are looking for a blockbuster movie that is  nothing but excitement, watch DIE HARD. This movie is, in its own way, a  masterpiece.",955152000,2,1266,4.261603375527426
16860,3,0767839129,"I missed this movie in the theatres, so I was excited about its video  release.  I watched the CBS movie about Joan of Arc and felt it left out  too many details.  The Messenger is the same way.  They did use some actual  events and some of the recorded dialogue that Joan used, but it seemed that  the director used alot of ""artistic license"" too.  The actors  used alot of modern language and phrases that I don't believe would be used  in the 1400s, and then out of nowhere Milla Jovovich would use an actual  Joan quote and it would seem out of place.  The visual affects were good  though and I think Dustin Hoffman was terrific in his role.  Overall, Milla  was convincing as a wild young woman on a mission.  I just wish the writers  would have dug a little deeper into the actual history of Joan.",955152000,,804,4.2885906040268456
16861,5,0767839129,"""The Messenger: The Story Of Joan Of Arc"" is exquisite, exciting and incredibly well-acted. Milla Jovovich gives her greatest performances as one of history's greatest martyrs. We forget about the beautiful model  that she is and are totally convinced and astounded that this is Joan Of  Arc. Luc Besson, probably France's best director, brings to the screen an  astounding story told with style, elegance, a gritty feeling, hard-broiled  action and beautiful cinematography. Not to mention the moving and rich  musical score by Eric Serra. ""The Messenger"" got some heavy flack  by critics who claimed it tried to be ""Braveheart"" and resorted  to being an action flick. Not so! In fact, I enjoyed ""The  Messenger"" more than ""Braveheart"" and the screenplay doesn't  just concentrate on the action. We get to know the characters and Besson  brilliantly shows Joan's troubled psyche and her battles between her heart  and and her conscience. ""The Messenger"" is exhilarating and  stylish, moving and Besson's masterpiece. This is his best film since  ""La Femme Nikita,"" and the most moving. This movie is grand and  inspiring. Look at the attention Besson pays to the sets and costumes,  music and style. ""The Messenger"" is rich in the detail seen in  the greatest of period epics. A 90s update of a timeless story. A  masterpiece.",955065600,25,1327,5.097674418604651
16862,2,0767839129,"This movie has 1 redeming quality-it introdues the modernviewer to the art of war, especially the devestation brought aboutduring a siege.  I liked the way the movie took you through all the different phases of a battle; the rallying of the troops, the pre-fighting taunting, the use of siege towers, etc..  What amazed me is how much this movie stole from Braveheart.  The scenes involving Joan addressing the troops before the charge and the boiling oil falling on the helpless battering ram chargers made me think I put the wrong tape in.",955065600,3,541,4.858695652173913

16864,5,0767839129,"After viewing both the TV mini-series (at least half a dozen times) and (recently) Luc Besson's treatment of the Joan of Arc story I've decided that I thoroughly enjoy them both, and will watch them both again and  again, for different reasons. The mini-series was (obviously) a  romantasized Joan, beautifully coiffed (and with perfect makeup), with a  suburban, year 2000 American demeanor;(mostly looking confused and/or  helpless/hopeless). Romance is wonderful and I enjoy that in my life. On  the other hand, Besson's Joan (Jovovich) looks to me like I imagine a  peasant girl would actually look in the 1420's.  (Bathing didn't really get  popular until the 1600's, and even then was rather sporadic.) Jovovich as  Joan has the fervor of a zealot with the slight tinge of the lunatic.  That's what I would expect of a teenage peasant girl in 1420, hearing  voices, seeing visions, expecting to save her country from invaders.  The  problems I've read concerning the realism and controversial graphic  violence in the movie confounds me, and I suspect that anyone who has a  problem with it is so locked into the 21st century point of view that they  can't conceptualize a time that was different. (Like 30 years ago in  America). War is and has always been nasty and ugly and unbearable and  should never be romatisized. On another note, Besson's treatment of color  and scope remain remarkable, the color and cinematography impecable.  Neither film is for everybody, but then what film is?",955065600,21,1497,5.03265306122449
16865,2,0767839129,"Another example of how Hollywood can take a great story and make it painfully drull.  The dialogue is laughable (completely comtemporary), the attribution and manifestation of Joan's madness utter nonsense, and it was  probably Hoffman's worst perfomance in a movie in well over 20 years.  Braveheart it is Not.",954979200,,311,5.3061224489795915
16866,2,0767839129,"Was she a prophet? Was she a nut? Perhaps she was a sly and highly intelligent manipulator. Maybe she was a feminist in an age of male domination who decided to use God as a ladder to French Royalty. All  interesting possiblities. All completely ignored by this film. I doubt that  even Luc Besson could explain what he thought of Joan of Arc and he doesn't  even try to here. Depite battle sequences that are almost on par with those  of Braveheart, a terrifc cast giving superb performances, and stunning  visuals the film falls completely flat . I would've prefered it if the film  had nothing good in it. It would have been easier to dismiss, but the  presence of such great elements makes the whole that much more of a  disappointment. Milla Jovovich gives her all in the lead role, Malkcovich  is as usual terrific as the sly back stabbing king, Faye Dunaway wreaks of  menace despite being underused. Then we come to Dustin Hoffman as The  Conscience, who I think is Besson's attempt at redeaming himself. After  roaming through the first half of the film, giving us battle sequence after  another, dream sequence after another, all which look magnifecent, but by  the third time you see them you start wondering if he is going anywhere  with this, he doesn't. The Conscience is his feeble attempt at  understanding Joan, but it comes too late, and by then we are not so much  interested in understanding her, as much as we are hoping that the film  would end. By the time the film is over you'll be thinking to yourself,  what a waste of lots of great elements in this completely pointless mess.  Note: The film was released outside America under the title Joan of Arc,  which despite being used before, is a much better title then The Messenger:  The Story Of Joan of Arc which sound more like a TV move then a cinamatic  release.",954979200,6,1839,4.57361963190184

Joan of Arc was going through every kind of turmoil possible i think the least Milla can do is portray that, which she did beautifully. Superb acting, amazing battle scenes and a neutral view, which allows viewers to decide for themselves if Joan was seeking revenge or fulfilling God's message. Go out and buy it!

It might have worked better if they'd added the cartoon 'Sock' , 'Bam', and 'Pow'  during fight scenes.  All I can tell you is AFTER seeing this, I happened  to catch ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" on Turner Classic Movies,  and thought it was a contemporary film.  I was shocked to learn the film  was done in 1928!  So my advice is to leave this 'glam trash Fishtar'  version on the shelf, and buy the REAL DEAL instead -  ""The Passion of  Joan of Arc"" (1928). .",954979200,,596,4.185840707964601

16871,5,0767839129,"Let me say that I like the movie and Jovovich's performance.  The film is also more historically accurate to Joan life then the TV series with Sobieski. You aren't reading this to hear if you want to see the movie, but  if you want to buy the DVD, so I'll review the DVD and this International  version which is different from the American version shown in theaters.  The picture quality is good especially the battle scenes and landscapes  although in somewhat dim scenes the background did not have a lot  definition which I don't remember from the theater. The sound quality was  fine.  I'll break down the difference from the International version with  the American theater release version one by one and my own take them.
2:30 minutes was added to the scene where the Dauphin chooses who will  be the impostor.  This is a good addition because it introduces the  characters that will be Joan's captains in the following battles.
A  single line, where Joan tells the Dauphin her message.  I didn't like this  because the Dauphin never told anyone what Joan said to him to make him  believe in her.  The American version left this a mystery too.
7 minutes  (a whole chapter, 3 scenes) was added right after the private audience  where various officials examine and interview Joan.  I liked this because  historically this is what happened, although I don't agree about how it was  done, a bit ridiculous, and it could have been cut in half.
A few lines  here and there that I don't remember, particularly during the battle scenes  that made the battles seem a little bit less intense. For example, ""Do  something!"" ""What do you want me to do?"" ""I don't care, just do something!""  which are lines I don't remember, but I could be wrong. None-the-less some  parts of the battles seemed less intense to me from what I remember.
I  may be mistaken, but there seemed to be some deleted scenes too.  The trial  seemed shorter in the International version, which makes sense considering  Americans love of the TV trial a la O.J. Simpson; they would have made it  longer.  I also think the lines where Joan screams out ""Jesus!"" were  deleted which I didn't care for because it was reported that she did scream  out his name.  The final burning scene seemed rather abrupt. I could have  sworn they had a scene where they brought her out, tied her down, and read  the charges before burning her.  I'd definitely buy this DVD if you like  the movie.  It would have been nice to get both versions of the film on  this DVD much like they did for the Abyss. If you are interested in  learning more about her, ""Joan of Arc: Her Story"" by Regine Pernoud is an  excellent book as well.",954979200,11,2672,4.569915254237288

Besson's Joan is a raving vengeful femme and bears no resemblance to the real Joan of Arc, so well documented by dozens of scholars.  Don't for one  minute be fooled by his revisionist Joan; the real woman was a real star  and a saint.  I was left with a feeling of anger, as if a fraud had been  perpetrated, because Besson's Joan simply cannot have achieved the heroism  that the real Joan so patently did.  Her trial and life are among the most  well-documented of any historical figure, and Besson's Joan disavows or  ignores what the best scholarship has long established.  A modernist gothic  horror it might be, but it's cheap cinema (because this Joan is just not  credible) and even cheaper fiction.

16888,3,0767839129,"As a student of history, I loved this movie... It explored depths of Joan's character that most books don't explore.  It's amazing how many ""history"" books to this date still write about Joan of Arc in a  ""Christ-Like"" light, because she claims to have had divine  conversation with the almighty.  This is the first time I have seen anybody  delve into Joan's character as a possible schizo / mentally ill person --  and I love how she begins to figure out that she is a nut case as her world  comes crumbling down.  Of course, if you are a romantic and choose to  believe in the myth of Joan of Arc, then it leaves you enough tidbits to  keep carrying on that vision -- Dustin Hoffman is excellent as the Devil.",954806400,3,712,4.366412213740458
16889,5,0767839129,"I have seen the movie twice within a week, and will see it acouple of more times. I was shivering through the whole movie, it wasso real for me.  ... how 'clean' Joan was.  First, at the beginning of the film it turns out that she had been to the priest for the third time that day, to confess. Later on the knights do not understand her when she says 'I want to confess. I have not confessed ...  today yet' - if your really pay attention, for the environment this is very strange. And, at the end of the movie, she confesses her 'crimes' again.  What I want to point out that she had a very strong conscience and she intended to keep it clean. This makes her a candidate to be Saint - as she was given this title 500 years later.
This movie IS about reality, the betraying of Joan included. This is what I liked the most (the film being so real).
Further on, every split second of the movie is communicating something. If you watch closely, the faces, the looks of the actors, the music, are constantly telling you a part of the story, a message. Perfect timing features the cutting of this film. The conflicts are precisely designed. The actors are perfectly matching their roles. I admit, that the ending is a bit long, but basically it stresses the suppressive behaviour of the inqusition of that time.
Milla plays just perfectly. In this version of the Joan of Arc movies she is what she is and that is it. Luc Besson had an idea in mind and she realises it.
If you like Luc Besson, Milla Jovovich, Eric Serra, history, middle age, or if you are a rebel, this is a must for you.
The more you appreciate art the more you are going to like this movie.
Finally: this movie is fine art in itself, a classic piece. But you have to like the style Luc Besson paints...",953769600,54,1767,4.2656716417910445
16890,4,0767839129,"I like the work of Luc Besson very much. This is a very typical Besson movie. The background and costumes are very accurate, they make one feel as if the crew was there filming real events. Mila Jovovich is wonderful as  the title charachter, she obviously got into playing the charachter. On the  whole, it is a very entertaining movie.",953683200,4,337,4.6
16891,4,0767839129,"If looked from a historical point of view, the movie has little to offer. But if you want to see some Middle Ages action flick, it's almost as good as it can get thanks to incredible battle scenes. As one reviewer noted  before, it's on par with those seen in Braveheart. Movie is a bit too long  and sometimes I though they should have skipped some parts, esspecially  after Joan was taken prisoner. Overall, a decent action movie on a  historical theme that is fun to watch. But if the history is what you are  looking for, my best advise is to look somewhere else.",952387200,2,567,4.3619047619047615
16892,3,0767839129,"Defintately a good attempt at a movie, with some staggering results, and some not so adequate ones.  Milla Jovovich does an ok job as Joan, nothing really moving.  The movie mostly concentrates on the battles and very  little on story.  I don't really know the story well, but what little there  was held a small bit of interest.  The battles scenes are done extremely  well, much reminding me of 'Braveheart'.  I love John Malkovich but he  didn't have much material to work with.  The key was Dustin Hoffman.  His  screen time in the two and half hour movie is at the most fifteen minutes,  and he totally steals every scene he is in.  The purpose of his character  is great, and he handles it so well.  All in all an enjoyable movie.",952128000,,736,4.462121212121212
16893,1,0767839129,"This is easily the worst movie I've ever seen.  I can't believe I paid to see it in a theater.  This was even worse than when I paid $25 (I was in Japan) to see Twister.  I was surprised to find out that this was a Luc  Besson film, because La Femme Nikita was good and The Professional had a  lot of soul, too.  I think by the time he made the 5th Element, Besson had  totally lost his mind and good taste.  This movie stunk in a very big way  from start to finish.  And it was long, it seemed an eternity.  There's a  few talented actors in the movie (Dustin Hoffman, John Malkovich) but they  pretty much stink in it too.  Every aspect of the film was bad, but  probably the worst was the acting of the young woman who plays Joan.  Not  only unbelievable, but annoying and unlikeable.  Also, the unnecessary  violence really left me feeling dirty when the movie was finished.  I hope  nobody buys or rents this video, not to punish Besson, but simply because  nobody should have to sit through this.  But of course they will because of  the big names in it.",952041600,4,1060,4.211055276381909

7789048,1,0767839129,"The late Hank Reinhardt, co-founder of Atlanta Cutlery and medieval sword enthusiast, wrote he walked out of this movie because it was so utterly bad in departing from the verifiable historical facts of its primary subject--and then Hank heard after he left, hecklers kept shouting out ""BURN THE WITCH!"" at the screen--apparently other viewers knew they were held in contempt by the screenwriters, directors, etc..., even though these hecklers might have had some problems naming the specifics of what annoyed them.

Fiction, whether written or dramatic based upon or around historical events and people is always a touchy subject. For example, most people in Japan really disliked _Shogun_. because in their minds it willfully ignored actual Japanese history. Often with period drama you have to adopt a ""this is its own thing"" mentality, like I did with the classic John Ford movie _My Darling Clementine_, where Henry Fonda played Wyatt Earp and the events of the ""Gunfight at the O-K Corral""--I ended up saying to myself, ""this is good story but in another universe with utterly different people, events and places sharing the same names as what happened in Tombstone of our universe""

I saw THIS movie, of all places, at Christ the Kings (Mesa, AZ) parish movie night (circa 2004) and when asked about the historical details by one of the viewers, Fr. Christopher Carpenter said something to the effect of ""well this is fiction, but really so little is known about Joan that we can't fault the movie makers for getting some details wrong--and really, what do we know what happened to Joan in her last days and what struggles of conscience she experienced?""

Father Chris happened to be the guy who welcomed me back to the Catholic Church via the Sacrament of Reconciliation February 2002--but my jaw dropped when he said that. So, I was NOT surprised a few years later when I heard Fr. Chris talking on NPR to Terry Gross about his departure from the Church to join the ""Reformed Catholic Church"", an ultra-liberal schismatic sect (were the Episcopalians not liberal enough???) because Phoenix's new bishop, Thomas Olmstead, had the audacity to demand his priests actually support and promote Catholic teaching in faith and morals.

Sorry for digressing but _The Messenger_ so consistently departs from the detailed historical record of St. Joan of Arc, the Maid of Orleans, so blatantly portrays her as a barely contained lunatic with a major revenge jones against the English one cannot escape the conclusion that the filmmakers knew the facts and departed from them every possible chance they could. From beginning to end, this movie wants to portray Joan as unlikable, even hateful, a symbol for extreme fanaticism saying in effect, ""this is Western Christianity's jihadist"". (yes I know this movie predates 9/11/01). Essentially _The Messenger's_ premise is the old Enlightenment canard of the Middle Ages being part of the Dark Ages of Faith, everyone was credulous if God was involved, so some loony girl claims she hears voices and everyone falls into line for slaughter and atrocity, etc..., etc..., yada, yada, yada...

Just one of SO MANY lying departures from history expressed in this film: Joan's village NEVER experienced an attack by marauding English--so Joan's sister was never killed and then raped right in front of Joan so NO revenge motive. Capice, everybody????

Never mind Jovovich was way too old for the role, so was Ingrid Bergman and she did a fantastic job even with a stilted script. I'm not going to risk boring you with all the details how this movie seems like a Soviet-era black propaganda piece; I merely refer you to a 19th century ""freethinker"", cultural anti-Catholic who reflexively despised the French and ending up writing THE best fictional treatment of Joan yet composed--would you be surprised that I'm talking about Samuel ""Mark Twain"" Clemens?

Twain spent the better part of two decades researching Joan of Arc--the French national archives had been opened on her for the revived case of her canonization and Twain spent considerable scratch getting them translated into English. Joan had experienced THREE major investigations into her life and actions,not the least being three months of blatant judicial farce under the collaborationist Bishop Pierre Cauchon who held the Maid in captivity and oversaw her execution. In all cases, any suspicions that Joan was insane were quickly dispelled. In the Middle Ages they actually knew what mental illness was, even without Freud and CT scans, but unlike the snake-pit asylums of the Enlightenment to 20th centuries, the Medievals were almost always kind, generous, and gentle with the mentally ill or challenged. They took care of them, they did NOT place them in charge of Royal armies. While utterly determined in her mission, the Maid was always lucid, always aware of the consequences of her actions and orders.

Even quite secular biographies of Joan will shoot down the awful slanders of _The Messenger_.

Still, the movie has one hilarious howler, the gravity propelled ""cannon ball"" coming out of that spiral chute--me thinks the director was playing to many video games when coming up with that concept (like, why not do what castle defenders have always done, DROP ROCKS!""",1515369600,3,5281,5.1030092592592595
