8556327,2,B00AQBDU32,"All of the fights were one-sided. Consequently, there's little excitement.
The same thing happened to the main event, the fight between UFC heavyweight champion junior dos Santos and former titleholder Cain Velasquez. One guy kept pressing the other all the way from round 1 till the end of round 5. The other guy could not offend. How can it be exciting to watch a fight like that?

In short, this DVD is not worth it. If you want to watch it, you should better watch it on Netflix. It's cheaper that way.",1375315200,,506,4.5
8556328,5,B00AQBDU32,"The fights were great. The main event Junior Dos Santos vs Cain Velasquez was a dominant performance for the challenger, now champion. The fight really showed how much Cain had trained and studied and came into the fight with the perfect gameplan to come back from his brutal loss, and absolutely destroy the favored champion for five rounds straight to a decision. Complete dominance and the rest of the fights were great also. Thanks.",1375315200,3,436,4.905405405405405

8556330,4,B00AQBDU32,"The only fights that weren't very close or exciting on this card were Velasquez vs Dos Santos, Belcher vs Okami, and Jury vs Johnson. The rest of the fights were fun to watch.",1367107200,,175,4.333333333333333
8556331,1,B00AQBDU32,"The main disappointment with this dvd is the lack of any behind the scenes bonus footage. Zuffa has been doing this more and more lately. The behind the scenes segment is one of the main reasons why I sometimes buy the UFC dvds, even if the event is mediocre. Maybe the perpetual overspending is finally starting to rear its ugly head and the company is trying to save money wherever it can. But it makes the dvds far less appealing given the fact that you can watch most of the fights online. I will not buy another UFC event until I've confirmed that behind the scenes footage is included.

The event itself is...meh.

There are only two fights worth watching on the entire card. Joe Lauzon vs. Jim Miller is a bloody war between two guys who are basically gatekeepers at this stage of their careers. The main event between Cain Valesquez and Junior Dos Santos is a good fight and the end result was somewhat shocking. But it was also disappointingly one-sided and lacked a finish. The winner of this fight should have been able to get the KO/TKO or submission, but seemed content to dominate for five rounds.

Overall I would not recommend this purchase.",1364947200,2,1157,4.579710144927536
