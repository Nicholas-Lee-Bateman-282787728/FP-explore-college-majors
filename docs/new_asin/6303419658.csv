639810,4,6303419658,"""The Making of 'A Hard Day's Night,'"" like the film itself, was sympathetically and affectionately produced by Walter Shenson. Shenson offers several fascinating recollections of The Beatles, and comments on United Artists' marketing strategies for the film. ""A Hard Day's Night"" director Richard Lester and writer Alun Owen add more color, host Phil Collins delivers informative narration, and George Harrison and Paul McCartney present first-person accounts in audio interviews. One editorial device is clever but overworked; virtually every interview is interrupted by a one-liner from the original movie. It's amusing if you know the picture thoroughly, but potentially distracting if you don't. Two original-release trailers are included, as well as ""You Can't Do That,"" a musical number which was filmed in 1964 but cut from the final release print. (Don't turn off the tape at the end: the VHS version repeats the complete song, this time without commentary, after the tape is supposed to be over.)",961372800,,1005,5.448717948717949
639811,5,6303419658,"A Hard Day's Night is one of those rare musical gems that will hold up forever.  The Beatles are unmatched for their enthusiasm and musical ability. Richard Lester's directing, alun Owens screenplay capture  Beatlemania in Britain like no other film or documentary.  One of my  favorite films of all time.",939340800,4,305,5.04
639812,4,6303419658,Great DVD documentary of the Fabs but was disappointed to find that the song You Can't Do That was not on the disc although it was clearly listed. I'm glad I still have my VHS copy. I hope they get these details right in  the future.,937699200,17,233,4.065217391304348
639813,5,6303419658,"To some, Hard Day's Night would be considered boring due the fact it's in black and white. But I feel that's what makes the film more enjoyable. John, Paul, George and Ringo are very natural in their acting.  They look  like they are really having a good time.",930268800,4,260,4.395833333333333
639814,5,6303419658,"This is one of those rare documentaries that is worthy of the film it is documenting.  The editing is absolutely brilliant, and the interviews with the filmmakers are engaging.  Using the Beatle video and sound bytes from  the film to comment on the commentators is hysterical and right within the  spirit of ""A Hard Day's Night""- one of the best film musicals  ever made. If this review were within the film documentary, you would now  be hearing a sound byte from John Lennon saying ""I could listen to him  for hours.""",928368000,8,520,4.648351648351649

639867,2,6303419658,"I wa very diasappointed with this, so i purchased the vhs, to check it out, not really a keeper, more of a rental and return, it just showed clips of the movie, with an intro from phil collins, who has an extra in a scene of the film, the extra  features on disc two of A Hard Days Night,will do for a Beatle fan..Dont waste your money on this.",1190937600,2,344,3.9855072463768115
639868,5,6303419658,"What a great piece of film.  I have to watch it during the day, because it gets me too charged up at night so that I can't sleep. Getting the producers and directors views on working so closely with the 4 are riveting.  John has always been my favorite, and their are a lot of candid moments with him. This film shows they were/are human.  LG",1127174400,2,342,4.151515151515151
639869,4,6303419658,"""The Making of A Hard Day's Night"" is a very interesting 'Making Of"" (well, of course its a Making Of!) and is hosted by Phil Collins. The Beatles are in their usual charming and funny selves and, YAY, this video introduces a song which was cut out from the film, which is, ""You Can't Do That."" It is one of my favorite Beatles songs and I just love the guitar intro.
""A Hard Day's Night"" is a great Beatles movie and it definitely deserved a ""Making Of."" The Beatles are very entertaining in it and in this VHS as well. John, Paul, George, and Ringo! Aaah!
The reason why I added a four star is because I would have liked more of the Beatles. After all, they are the main cast. But then, I do understand why they didn't have them in this, because they weren't there at the time and they probably didn't have much of their behind-the-scenes stuff. Also another reason is because I think only a Beatles fan would love it. (Ahem, that reason leads me to the fact that tells me that only Beatles fans would get this...) Some parts were rather boring, but that's the only complaint I have.
My favorite part in this VHS is Abbey Road Studios where the Beatles are composing their songs for the film (""A Hard Day's Night""). John and Ringo are hilarous in it. It makes me laugh just thinking about it. Haha!
All in all, I enjoyed most of this one hour (and 5 minutes) ""Making Of"" with the writer, producer, director, and cast members of ""A Hard Day's Night."" I definitely recommend it for Beatles fans.",1074902400,7,1495,4.362007168458781
639870,5,6303419658,"I really love this video.  As much as I love the Beatles' 1964 classic film and title song, ""A Hard Day's Night,"" I strongly feel this is a video that will delight all, from inveterate Beatles' fans to folks just getting familiar with their music.
In watching this video, one gets the feeling of riding on the early Beatle train, enjoying the natural banter among the world's most famous foursome.  One gets treated to some rare film footage and the song, ""I'll Cry Instead"" is included as a bonus treat as it was not in the original movie, ""A Hard Day's Night.""  Following the Beatles' movements during the early part of 1964 brings all the madcap, pure fun back to the forefront.
I love the way each individual Beatle emerges; the differences in interests, temperament and approach shine through on each song and scene.  This is such a treat!
This is truly a classic.  In watching this, you will be shaking your bangs, dancing and singing along with the Beatles!  YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!",1017100800,5,983,4.6531791907514455
639871,4,6303419658,"Only the first pressing of this DVD was missing ""You Can't Do That"".

639872,5,6303419658,"A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is the first feature film of The Beatles, directed by Richard Lester. Filming in Black and White was the most artistic thing they  made and captures the individual characteristics of the Favfour,  separately. John, being the smart and Witty one. Paul, being the cute and  straight. George, being the kind hearted and polite. and Ringo, being the  clumsy and wildly comic one and this documentery clearly explains it. Plus  added to it is the track, you can't do that. One of my favourite films.",967248000,8,513,4.784090909090909
639873,5,6303419658,"It is great to see the Fab 4 in their hotel rooms and on trains and such, just clowning around, mugging for the cameras... But what makes this DVD  worth owning is the music. Included are nearly all the Ed Sullivan  performances, including of course the first night that Ed introduced the  Beatles to America.
What makes this DVD all the better is that it indexes  the songs so that you can play just the songs, without all the documentary  footage. Of course, you do have to skip ahead to the beginning of each  chapter in order to do this, but at least you don't have to fast forward or  rewind to get to the next song.
For me, the Ed Sullivan footage alone is  worth the price of admission.",966988800,10,693,4.276923076923077

But, more importantly, you get a glimpse at the 'behind the scenes' Fab Four at their young and innocent best.  The inclusion of the song 'You Can't Do That' makes this film extra special.

7845877,4,6303419658,"It's actually a pretty good documentary, and Phil Collins does a good job. Not a lot of it is really new, but it is pretty good, and the clip of You Can't Do That is pretty spectacular. I'd suggest this to a Beatles fan.",1295740800,,220,4.0227272727272725
7845878,5,6303419658,"I don't have any idea why this got some bad reviews.  I thought this documentury was rather intersting.
They talk of how they came about making this movie and footage that you'll be glad to have.
Some shots of them behind the scenes and not to mention a complete scene totally cut from the movie.  It was from the stage concert scene and the song was 'you can't do that'.
Then they show a trailor for the film that was never previously shown in the U.S of all four of them sitting in baby carriges or (prams) in front of a brick wall.  It's in black and white but still a good trailor none the less.

So if your a Beatles fanatic like myself this is a must have for rare footage or just because you want to find out
how they made the film, it's all good.",1283990400,3,754,4.074324324324325
7845879,5,6303419658,"If you are any kind of a Beatles fan, this movie is a must see. It captures not only the joy of the music, but provides unique insight into the 4 'guys' who were the Beatles. It highlights there preeminent gifts as musicians, but also there individual and collective humors. Itis also very interesting to see how the movie was conceived and filmed, and how many of the quirky, surreal elements of the film came about. The movie was way ahead of it's time artistically, and this behind the scenes look is a great window into a film that, like the Beatles, was way ahead of it's time.",1279584000,,582,4.398148148148148
