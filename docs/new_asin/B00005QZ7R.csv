7951407,3,B00005QZ7R,"The tenth DVD volume of the Robotech series (the fourth and final DVD in the Dana Sterling Saga) contains six excellent episodes recounting Earth's final desperate struggle to rid the planet of the alien invaders while the Fifteenth Squadron harbors a new alien - including the eyecatches to and from commercial breaks. In the late 1980s, F.H.E. had released a videotape of these same episodes edited together to form one ""movie;"" while that was okay, this presentation by ADV Films is far superior, allowing easy access to any particular episode on may wish to view.
This is one of my favorite anime series. However, I can only rate this DVD as a ""3"" for two reasons. First, concerning the DVD construction, the main menu begins with a brief clip from the series without any actual menu selections immediately available, which can cause confusion for some users. Second, and by far the most significant downfall, this DVD is NOT compatible with the PlayStation2, whereas the first DVD in the series worked flawlessly with the PS2.",1014681600,,1031,4.931034482758621
7951408,5,B00005QZ7R,"Robotech: The Final Solution, contains Episodes 55 - 60 which chronicles the end of the second story arc (The Robotech Masters) in the classic, ground-breaking, epic Americanized anime series from the 80s, Robotech.
For the uninitiated, Robotech was the most popular of the Americanized Japanese anime series to hit American TV waves during the 1970s and 1980s (along with Star Blazers, Voltron, Transor Z,  etc.)  Known for its cutting edge animation, high-tech battle scenes, futuristic weapons (planes, tanks, motorcyles that transform into robots), cool alien invaders, and realistic and compelling storylines, Robotech swept an entire generation and helped put Japanese Anime forever on the map of American pop culture.
Set 15 years after the events in the Macross Saga, the story picks up with a new generation of Robotech defenders (in this case the heavily armored Armies of the Southern Cross) protecting the Earth as a new wave of Alien invaders, the Robotech Masters, descend upon the earth looking to reclaim the missing Protoculture factory (which will help to save their civilization) hidden aboard the now derelict SD-F1.  Though not the most popular of the three Robotech story arcs, the Robotech Masters Saga is the focal point of the entire Robotech series as the key plotlines and threads (the secrets of the mysterious Protoculture) that bind together the three story arcs are revealed in this story arc.
This single volume is the pivotal chapter to the entire Robotech saga as the secrets of Protoculture (the reason why all the fighting has taken place) are revealed, giving a prelude to the maelstrom to come.
Here's a rundown of the episodes featured on this DVD:
Episode 55 - Dana in Wonderland:  Trapped once again aboard the Robotech Masters' Fortress, the 15th gets another first hand look at the Robotech Masters' way of life.  Also, Bowie is reunited with his true love.
Episode 56 - Crisis Point:  The 15th make their escape from the Fortress with the aide of Musica and a re-programmed Zor.
Episode 57 - Daydreamer:  The 15th smuggles Musica back to Earth, hiding from Nova and the GMP.  The Masters plan their next move and deal with the fallout from Musica's actions.  Plus, the 15th is betrayed again...
Episode 58 - Final Nightmare:  On the run, Bowie and Musica (with Nova and the 15th on their heels) return the site of the SD-F1 and make a startling discovery.  Zor regains his full memories revealing all. Plus, Leonard gives the final order -- fight to the end!!!
Episode 59 - The Invid Connection:  The Final Battle between the Earth Defense Forces and the Masters.  Zor cuts a final deal with the Masters.
Episode 60 - Catastrophe:  The thrilling conclusion for the Robotech Masters saga.  The 15th attempts to liberate the clones and Zor attempts to stop the Masters once and for all!!!
Incidentally, these volumes DO NOT have special DVD features (aside from trailer ads for other anime series coming out on DVD from ADV).  Not to fear though.  If you purchase the boxed set collections, each boxed set collection will come with an ""Extra:  Elements of Robotechnology"" DVD special which will contain all the DVD special features you could want:  interviews, trailers, commercial spots, specs, etc... So by all means, get the boxed set if you are planning on buying.
Though this particular arc of the Robotech saga is pointed to by many as the ""low-point"" of the series (and I felt the same way too as a kid), I must say that it's definitely A LOT better than I remember it being. The action still kicks ... even 15 years later.
If you've never seen Robotech, simply put YOU MUST.  The action and the drama are compelling, clearly showing why Robotech became a pop culture icon.  It is the series that forever put Japanese anime on the map in the US.  If you did grow up with Robotech, give these a watch again.  They're great for a trip down memory lane. You can't lose!!!
