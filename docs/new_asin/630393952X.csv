The battle scenes aren't too intense for young viewers. It does  have some historical inaccuracies. However, if you don't mind that and are  interested in the Civil War you'll enjoy it. It also gives a good overview  of the entire battle. What I mean is that it is easy to see the strategies  behind certain attacks. I don't like how they made JEB Stuart look like he  just want on a joy-ride. My great-great-grandad rode with him. He said that  they were cut off from the rest of the army.",945388800,5,641,4.256198347107438

There will always be those folks who will find fault with great stories and they do have valid criticisms. With this film, they  don't have much.  Those historians out there who carp about accuracy should  be aware of the constraints on the film makers. At least the producers READ  the novel before they made the movie. The actors portrayed the characters  as THEY interpreted them. All things considered GETTYSBURG is a fine film,  and THE KILLER ANGELS a fine piece of literature.  Share both with your  family and friends. Visit the battlefield and see the film again.",940464000,2,665,4.663793103448276
