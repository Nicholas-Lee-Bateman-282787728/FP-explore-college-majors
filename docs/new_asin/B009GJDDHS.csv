5327275,4,B009GJDDHS,"The Paradise is a fantastic new series by the BBC: it's basically a Victorian period episodic soap drama, telling bit by bit the story of Denise, a young woman who comes to be a shop girl in a store during Victorian times...the focus is on the ladies portion of the shop, where they sell dresses, hats and more...the lovely colors, fabrics, silks, and love and lust stories intertwined with the intrigue and interest, combine to form a beautifully filmed and storyline of, well, awesomeness!  I would definitely recommend the Paradise, as another great BBC, however beware content for young childen (innuendo, adultery, man/woman in bedroom shown together, no full nudity though)...please note this is a Region 2 DVD, so is only playable in region zero or region free players...ENJOY!!",1360368000,10,785,5.0852713178294575

5327279,5,B009GJDDHS,"This BBC series  is about the first department store and set in the 1870s.  Based on Emile Zolas novel, the lavish store is transported from Paris to England.  The manager, the owners, the clerks and their personal lives are the subject.  I chose to see it because it was written by Bill Gallagher, who wrote Lark Rise to Candleford.  As expected. its 16 episodes (it was cancelled too soon) are excellent.",1500076800,4,406,4.661971830985915

5327283,5,B009GJDDHS,"I love The Paradise! Beautifully filmed, great actors and very engaging. Too bad there is no third or following series. I would have loved to see more, but at least the second series ended with good closure, so you feel it is a story with a beginning and an end",1490400000,5,261,4.24

5327304,5,B009GJDDHS,"I watched this show when it aired on PBS, and I couldn't get enough of it! I got the DVDs for Christmas, and I will watch them over and over again. It's such a shame that PBS cut it short. They should, absolutely, bring it back!",1482969600,2,228,3.9782608695652173

5327306,5,B009GJDDHS,"I watched this on PBS originally and enjoyed it.  The storyline is interesting, poor girl falls for self made man, rich woman sets eyes on selfmade man... The costuming is plausible for the time period, sometimes more accurate than others.",1482710400,11,239,4.975

5327309,5,B009GJDDHS,"I've read reviews comparing this series to Downton Abbey and Mr. Selfridge -- and I agree with the caveat that nothing quite compares to Downton Abbey!  However, the difference between DA, MrS, and The Paradise is that this series never had a final season and a satisfactory resolution/completion.  Shame on BBC to leave us hanging this way!  With the exception of Katherine's husband (couldnt understand why she'd marry him even on the rebound -- too evil/disturbed and therefore two-dimensional, a poor replacement for her father who had a complex mix of light and dark), everything about it was top notch: the acting, story, writing, costumes, music.  Please complete this wonderful series!",1480204800,3,693,5.216216216216216
5327310,5,B009GJDDHS,Absolutely loved this series!,1479600000,,29,6.5
5327311,5,B009GJDDHS,Looking forward to receiving this complete series set. Been waiting for it to go on sale again so when I saw it reduced I snatched it up this time. I watched it on Netflix and loved it so will enjoy adding this to my period-piece movie collection.,1478131200,,247,4.276595744680851
5327312,5,B009GJDDHS,"If you like Mr. Selfridge you will love this.  It is set in a slightly different time but is stunning.  The actors are very talented and the visuals are wonderful.  I discovered the show by accident and have totally fallen in love with it.  I go between this show, Downton Abbey and Mr. Selfridge.  Between all three you will long to shop for white satin gloves, deeply fragranced perfumes and a dress that brushes the floor as you walk.",1476921600,3,437,4.481012658227848
5327313,5,B009GJDDHS,Good old fashioned story.,1471737600,,25,5.5
5327314,5,B009GJDDHS,"The DVD set was nice.  Its better to buy Season 1 and 2 together because you will want to complete the series once you get into the characters.  This series is a good one to add to your collection if you are into Lark Rise to Candleford, or Cranford.  It had such a great story and the actors were wonderful.  It was a great buy.",1471305600,19,329,4.015384615384615

5327330,5,B009GJDDHS,I started watching this on Netflix and some of the series was not available at the time I was viewing it and they were going to bypass those Dvd's and I decided to order the complete series from Amazon.

5327335,2,B009GJDDHS,There are 16 episodes here but honestly it could have been finished and wrapped up in 8. I struggled to finish watching until the end because it changed from being fantastic in the beginning to a cheap soap opera at the end. Really started out great and I loved it but they ruined it. Rent it on Netflix if you wish to see it because I highly doubt you'll watch it more than once.,1462060800,4,380,4.148648648648648

5327353,3,B009GJDDHS,Product came as expected. Season one was better than season two.,1457913600,4,64,4.909090909090909

5327356,1,B009GJDDHS,"While I'm certain I would LOVE this series,  I haven't been able to watch it because I wasn't aware that ""region codes"" existed.  Apparently,  this is a region 2 dvd set. All dvd players sold in the US, however,  are region 1.  I've read that you can hack your player but am not willing to do this. I take responsibility for not being a more informed consumer and although there was a reference made in the description,  it should have been made clear for the buyers who've never heard of this. I purchased both seasons and am thoroughly enjoying the dvd cases.",1406073600,3,561,4.450980392156863
5327357,1,B009GJDDHS,"I  was embarrassed that this DVD, which I purchased as a gift, would not play on my friend's DVD player.",1405641600,,104,4.2
5327358,5,B009GJDDHS,"The Paradise is so well written and cast one wonders why on earth the second season hasn't been released in the USA. It's so terrible to be awaiting this wonder work of fine writing, acting and period detail. This series is soooo superior to Mr. Selfridge one can't understand why BBC is holding back. I've heard the ratings dropped during the second season in England but here in the US we are starved for more seasons of this brilliantly well written series. Please reconsider a 3rd season and give all respectable, discerning viewers in the US a third season.....please! I've told every friend to watch it( I have a few) and they have all loved the series. We have taken to watching season 1 over and over just to satisfy ourselves while we wait for the 2nd season. PLEASE! There is so,so little to watch on TV which is sophisticated, decent and well done on ALL levels. You are all to be applauded but first send us the 2nd season!",1396483200,8,935,4.5058823529411764
5327359,5,B009GJDDHS,I hope they make a third series!  Set in the late 1800's this is a classic BBC period drama.  The set and acting are first rate.  The storyline very enjoyable.  We were hooked!  Recommended!,1389916800,,190,4.470588235294118
5327360,4,B009GJDDHS,"Not only the quality of DVD is great, the story itself is delightful.
Although it is very different from the original Zola novel.",1389398400,,129,4.6521739130434785
5327361,5,B009GJDDHS,I love the movie but the sales are not clear...don't have the right player and can't enjoy the movie. Please give bold letter to describe the format,1388966400,,148,4.518518518518518
5327362,5,B009GJDDHS,"The BBC have really excelled themselves with this masterpiece. If you like nothing better than emerging yourselves in the lives of those from Victorian times, then this DVD is for you. We loved the costumes, the gorgeous set and the beautifully developed characters. It is great to see some of our favourite Lark Rise to Candle ford actors playing both main cast roles and supporting roles. Highly recommended!",1373328000,3,410,5.044117647058823
5327363,3,B009GJDDHS,Seems like this movie has taken the best bit of previous films particularly Lark Rise to Candleford and lost the plot along the way,1368403200,,131,4.5
5327364,5,B009GJDDHS,"I have seen this English period drama series in England, and it is wonderful. The story that takes place in the Victorian era, so if you loved Downton Abbey, you will love The Paradise. The music is wonderful. The sets are beautiful.  It is set in a the first department store in London. It is very unlike Mr. Selfridge.  You will fall in love with the story, and its characters.  Beautifully done....and yes there is a bit of romance and quite a cliffhanger in the first series.  Series two is now filming!",1367280000,5,507,4.478260869565218
5327365,5,B009GJDDHS,very good series loved it love English drama is great to watch and entertaining love it and should have been a lot longer,1365292800,,121,4.304347826086956
8541290,4,B009GJDDHS,"I really liked this series, though I was annoyed with Morray, the owner of the Paradise.  He's full of handsome charm but is, after -all weak in staying true to his heart.  I don't cut slack for men who marry for position, while suffering heartache for their true love.  And I certainly find it more than annoying when women chase after such a man.  But I do like the two main characters very much and enjoy watching them together.  I grudgingly put my personal disdain behind me for that reason.  The costumes are simply beautiful.  This is a little along that lines of Mr. Selfridge but without the flamboyant charm and gregarious personality.  Still, there's plenty of storyline----annoying and implausible as it may be at times.",1528070400,,732,4.753968253968254

8541292,5,B009GJDDHS,"Perhaps the best-ever TV drama!  By and large, the best stories, best acting, best music score, best of everything important to the drama.  (By best I mean the absolute best or unsurpassed).  But get the Blu-ray edition of each Season better picture and as of today a much lower price.",1526256000,,285,4.66

8541294,5,B009GJDDHS,"Viewed the story on Netflix. Loved it!! so much I purchased the DVD's. A thoroughly delightful series to watch. Stunning costumes. Outstanding performances. Based around Paradise, England's first lavish department store, Tollgate Street, its many merchants and surrounding countryside. The Paradise has it all: love, hate, greed, rivalries, betrayals, intrigue, secrecy, control, manipulation and redemption. Moray, who owns and operates the Paradise is tormented by his past,which direction to follow and being true to his heart/soul. He's torn between Katherine, a rich arrogant aristocrat vs Denise, love interest, pretty country girl. Denise and Moray, both have mixed emotions of jealously and career ambition. A cast of interesting characters reveals their own struggles...Jonas, store detective, Mr. Westin, cruel sociopath, Sam, fun loving sales person. A very well written story with many twists & turns. Disappointed the story doesn't continue. Would have loved to see Moray and Denise marry. Outstanding job with story closure...no cliffhanger here.",1520208000,2,1060,5.8896103896103895
8541295,5,B009GJDDHS,I continue to watch The Paradise over and over.  Denise and Moray are quite the marketing geniuses.,1520035200,,99,4.823529411764706
