5072689,5,B007ATHNOU,"We think Don Friesen is hilarious and have enjoyed his comedy for years.  This is an excellent show and you won't be disappointed.  I do have one caution though. If you have purchased his previous DVD ""Inexplicable"" be warned that there is a lot of overlapping material in this one. Other than that, if you haven't seen him before, I'd highly recommend buying ""Ask Your Mom"".",1339804800,,375,4.666666666666667

5072704,5,B007ATHNOU,"Funny funny and has to be rated G or GP tops, which is a plus when the grandkids are around. Really loved his humor about his family. I highly recommend and have watched it 3 times already!",1449187200,,189,4.135135135135135

5072710,5,B007ATHNOU,"I went to Tommy T's in Pleasanton, CA a couple of years back and saw him--I'd never heard of him at the time, but MAN, he was so hilarious he had me stomping on the floor (yeah, I'm one of those people).  Happy to buy his material and support his work!",1435536000,,252,3.9411764705882355

5072712,5,B007ATHNOU,One of the funniest comics I have ever seen.  I think it's suitable for family viewing.  This guy does his act w/o all the usual four-letter words.  There is some vague innuendos but nothing shocking.  If you don't find this guy funny you probably should see a doctor.,1427932800,,268,4.520833333333333
5072713,5,B007ATHNOU,Good clean humor... finally a comedian that you can enjoy watching with the entire family.,1420156800,,90,5.066666666666666

5072715,5,B007ATHNOU,It's so refreshing to watch a comedian that is inoffensively hilarious.  I've watched this show on Netflix 6 times and absolutely cracked up every time.  This DVD is definitely a keeper!,1413244800,,186,4.967741935483871
5072716,5,B007ATHNOU,Thank you Don Friesen its hard to find CLEAN humor in todays world,1407283200,,66,4.153846153846154
5072717,5,B007ATHNOU,Great to see a PG comedian.  He is so funny will be looking for more of his shows.  Highly recommend !!,1390262400,,103,3.857142857142857
5072718,4,B007ATHNOU,"Don Friesen is very, very funny!  His routine is clean, not offensive at all.  I like how he moves around the stage.",1384819200,,116,4.2272727272727275
5072719,5,B007ATHNOU,"Non stop laughter, all the jokes pertained to real life style situations that just crack you up the way he lays them out.  Great comedian!!!",1374537600,,140,4.6

5072731,5,B007ATHNOU,"In this enlightened era in which we live, it is very refreshing to find a video that has NO swearing in it. Not that I am a prude. This guy is hilarious about things we do each day. I would recommend it for ""Family Night Movies"".",1361145600,3,229,4.0
5072732,5,B007ATHNOU,"Don Friesen is a funny guy. My mom has been listening to a lot of PG comedians recently and ordered this DVD for a friend. It was very funny. We particularly liked his impression of being dragged around shopping.

The DVD arrived quickly. No complaints!",1358294400,,253,4.622222222222222
5072733,4,B007ATHNOU,"I love Don Friesen and so does my husband. This is a really cute routine, but, sadly, we've already seen it. Since it has been around for a few years, it was posted on YouTube.  So what was available before only for purchase is now available for free. I bought it anyway and I'm glad I did.
You can tell it wasn't taped within the last year, largely due to the content. (When you have material that precedes Facebook and Instagram, you are dated!)  But most of us still laughed out loud and enjoyed it.",1357862400,,502,4.273684210526316
5072734,5,B007ATHNOU,"Loved it!  This DVD is jam-packed with fresh, creative, hilarious material performed with comic perfection.  Our whole family enjoyed it, and I've already watched it three times.  Be prepared to laugh until it hurts.",1356825600,2,216,5.294117647058823
5072735,5,B007ATHNOU,"I had my doubts, but he kept me laughing pretty much the entire time. The only problem was that it seemed fairly short...I was left wanting more!",1350777600,,145,4.407407407407407
5072736,5,B007ATHNOU,"Rented ""Ask Your Mom"" and loved every minute of it.  Do not miss it.  Heard this show was on a pay channel that we do not get, so was thrilled to see it for rent on Amazon. Hopefully there will be many more specials from Don Friesen.  Hilarious.",1340928000,,245,4.0625
5072737,5,B007ATHNOU,I laughed non-stop the entire show....funny stuff and his timing and delivery are perfect.  Okay Don....whatcha got next for us?  Can't wait to find out!,1340496000,,153,5.08
5072738,5,B007ATHNOU,"This is not fair, there has got to be a way to hack Amazon and give Don Friesen 6 stars. He is dynamic, energetic, relevant, hilarious, and clean. I am already looking forward to his next video (which I hope is soon). He is quotable too, me and my girlfriend are saying his lines around the house and cracking ourselves up. I recommend this, if he comes to your city, buy your tickets fast because he will sell out.",1340409600,,415,4.265822784810126
5072739,5,B007ATHNOU,Where did this guy come from?  Wow!!!  And clean too.  I can't remember the last time I laughed this much.  Watching it again.,1340236800,,126,4.3478260869565215
8513557,5,B007ATHNOU,I thoroughly enjoyed this.  Don Friesen is the funniest CLEAN comedian I have had the pleasure of watching.  This is an excellent performance for all ages.  Treat yourself and your family to laughter.  It's healthy!  Enjoy!!!,1529539200,,225,5.138888888888889
8513558,3,B007ATHNOU,"We like this comedian and were introduced to him through Pandoras Christian comedy channel. This particular act isn't as clean as the ones they use on the Pandora channel though and I found this inappropriate for our children to watch due to the talk about intercourse. The first comment about it was unexpected, but I was able to fast forward another part and we continued watching. Once the third incident came up we decided to turn it off and watch it without the kids later. Overall, I wished I had previewed it first.",1528329600,,522,4.623655913978495
8513559,5,B007ATHNOU,Don Friesen is a truly great comedian. I wish he had more DVDs available for purchase.,1521072000,,86,4.4375

8513566,5,B007ATHNOU,This happens to be one of my top 5 favorite comedians & stand-ups.(plus the hilarity doesn't require curse words/remarks),1474675200,,121,5.421052631578948
