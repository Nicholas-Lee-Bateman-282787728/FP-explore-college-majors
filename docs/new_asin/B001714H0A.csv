He is a wonderful Dr.and treats people regardless of ethnicity, insurance or appointments.  But he is spot on about his ROUTINE......Loved the movie and I love Dr. Kabarra.  He is a special man and a great doctor.",1273536000,,337,4.491803278688525
8326155,5,B001714H0A,This is a gem of a film. I didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. I found it to be humorous (not laugh out loud funny -- which is fine). The music is freakin awesome.,1251417600,,186,3.9210526315789473
8326156,5,B001714H0A,"It's a very funny and charming film.  Some parts are animated and the rest is a narrated-documentary. The film is trying to demonstrate how immigrants built their lives from a scratch and try to satisfy their kids' needs. It also closely follows the ""Dad's"" daily habits, which are cute because at some point or another we all develop those daily rituals. It's very cool, I would definitely recommend it to other customers.",1218499200,,423,4.875
8326157,5,B001714H0A,"It's a cool little film.
The dad is awesome... he's so charming. It's a testament to all that dad's do for their kids. It's not sappy so I liked that.
It is half drama and half comedy so it kept me interested and made me laugh. I think immigrants to America would really like this kind of film.
I would definitely recommend this movie.",1208736000,,335,4.25
