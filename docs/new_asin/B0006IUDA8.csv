2189290,5,B0006IUDA8,"AMERICA'S DREAM is interesting especially the story adapted from

2189294,5,B0006IUDA8,"this movies title says it all. It is like three movies in one and each is as great as the other. I think what I loved the best is that in each story, although set in the past, the facts are still the same today. This movie definatley gives the viewer something to think about. It approaches life from a point on inproving ones standing while sticking to rights right and wrong is nobody. Any person can relate to these situations and the complexity of making these choices. And this movie gives a well rounded view from both sides of the story. A real eye opener.",1026432000,7,563,4.320754716981132
2189295,4,B0006IUDA8,"America's Dream is a fine film that should be viewed by all Americans, whether they be African-American, Caucasian-American, Native American, Hispanic/Latino, or other.  It is a sweet story about the dreams of 3 folks, which are dreams we can all relate to.  The acting is good and the stories are informative, as well as entertaining, which is why I recommend it for everyone, young and old alike.  Wesley Snipes is definitely an actor that can play any role and make it believable (we are watching the character and not the fine actor), and Danny Glover is near the top of his game, also.",1017878400,8,590,4.70873786407767

I ENJOYED ALL OF THE CHILDREN IN IT. THE WHOLE DVD STORIES ARE SOME REAL LIFE THINGS AND WILL HOLD YOUR ATTENTION AND CAPTIVATE YOUR HEART. I LOVE IT AND WILL WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AS I HAVE ALL OF WESLEY SNIPES MOVIES. I LOVE HIM.",1344384000,2,557,4.264150943396227
