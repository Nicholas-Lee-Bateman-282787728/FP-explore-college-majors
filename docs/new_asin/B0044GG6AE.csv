4261129,5,B0044GG6AE,This video completes the Tai Chi for Arthritis course (this first half is a separate disc.)  Dr. Lam guides the viewer step by step through each form of the program.  Easy to follow.,1333756800,9,182,4.484848484848484
4261130,5,B0044GG6AE,I teach this tai chi form and it is so much easier for people to learn the way Dr. Lam breaks each movement down into smaller movements. You don't just watch and then try and do the movement like so many DVDs are. All of Dr. Lams DVDs are great.,1317859200,15,245,3.92
4261131,4,B0044GG6AE,"The video is typical Paul Lam, methodical and carefully explained.  Easy to follow.

4261144,5,B0044GG6AE,"These DVDs cover the second part of Dr. Lam's program and I highly recommend getting both sets of DVDs and practicing them regularly for improved balance and movement. By participating in this program, I've eliminated my falls and have increased my mobility a tremendous amount. Plus it can be a very meditative time to prepare you for the rest of the day.",1471478400,2,356,4.758064516129032

4261146,5,B0044GG6AE,As an aging woman (70) I was having pains in my feet and hands and losing my balance. I was at a point I couldn't even stand to get one leg up to put on my pants without leaning against the wall.. I also saw myself learning something I could do and be comfrotable with doing as it progressed through the course. By the end of the course I now have my balance back so I can stand alone to get my pants on and the pains in my hands and feet have totally gone away.. Amazing how the body works with the right movements and I feel like a new woman inside and not the old lady I had become! Best money ever spent on myself I am a whole new ME! Thank You Dr. Lam..,1468972800,3,658,3.81021897810219

4261151,4,B0044GG6AE,Very easy follow. Having both front and back views is very helpful. I would have preferred to have the name of the movements rather than lesson numbers or maybe in addition to them.,1462406400,,181,4.515151515151516
4261152,5,B0044GG6AE,Best thing I've ever done for my self,1461801600,,37,3.75
4261153,5,B0044GG6AE,"I am currently taking a class in this tai chi form at my fitness club.  My teacher studied with Dr. Lam.  This video was recommended by my teacher and it is very helpful as a home study supplement to the class.

In this video, Dr. Lam teaches the more difficult part 2 of Tai Chi for Arthritis.  He details the correct way of moving with the proper weight transfer for each step.  That is important for a sound foundation in understanding and practicing the form.  It also helps me slow down so I don't push through the steps too quickly.

I definitely recommend this video as a follow up to Tai Chi for Arthritis Part 1.",1461196800,4,621,4.301724137931035
4261154,5,B0044GG6AE,arrived on time.  product exactly as described.  very satisfied.,1451865600,,64,6.0

4261161,5,B0044GG6AE,"Though I attend the gym regularly, I find that I could use a form of exercise that would provide more flexibility.  Tai Chi has provided the types of movement that result in better balance as well as increased flexibility.  The presentation in Dr. Lam's DVD is easy to follow, and at your own pace.",1432771200,2,298,4.5

4261163,5,B0044GG6AE,Another excellent dvd that has helped me feel more confident in learning this form both in & out of the classroom.  I don't have arthritis but I love doing Tai Chi & have the opportunity to take this class in addition to a 24 form class.  I find the movements very calming & centering and I can focus more on the flow of it.  It is very gentle and to me not as physically challenging as some forms which would an be advantage if you have physical joint limitations.  If you have never done any Tai Chi or you don't have access to a class to learn it I would recommend that you try Dr. Paul Lam's Tai Chi for Arthritis - 12 lessons first.  If you are already familiar with some Tai Chi movements & have an arthritis Tai Chi class you might be fine with just this DVD.  The sequence for the 1st 12 lessons is contained in this DVD as part of lesson 1 & I find it easy to follow.  It is not taught - just a demo as focus is on the new additional forms.,1427932800,4,949,3.963157894736842
4261164,5,B0044GG6AE,"A great Tai Chi form for those with some physical issues. It is one of the best instructional videos I have ever seen. It is easy to follow, detailed  and each step is broken down into small lessons. Ideally, you would use this as a spport to instruction taken in a Tai Chi for Arthritis class but could be used by yourself at home.",1425772800,4,332,4.1875
4261165,5,B0044GG6AE,"This video is excellent.  Dr. Lam's approach to Tai Chi is very gentle on the body while helping promote strength, balance, and calm.  Highly recommended!!!",1415059200,,156,5.2
4261166,5,B0044GG6AE,This DVD is formed to promote easy learning step by step. Tai Chi for Arthritis is a healthy and beautiful way to help those not only with Arthritis but many other dis-eases as the medical studies are proving.,1413936000,,209,4.526315789473684

4261170,4,B0044GG6AE,I ordered part one then a few weeks later ordered part 2 and am very happy with the dvd's and it is a BIG help in learning the moves.  I take a class twice a week and this enables me to keep up at home.,1407024000,3,202,3.488888888888889
4261171,3,B0044GG6AE,Solid dvd but the price was too high. Needs to be cheaper.,1405728000,2,58,3.9166666666666665

4261174,5,B0044GG6AE,"Dr. Lam is a thorough and patient teacher.  Loved the repetition.  Wish there were a DVD with straight thru Parts 1 & 2 so I didn't have to switch discs to practice, now that I don't need all the detailed instruction",1404345600,,216,4.2439024390243905
4261175,5,B0044GG6AE,I'm very pleased with this DVD and use it everyday.  It arrived in perfect condition and rather quicker than I had expected.  I will be purchasing more from the Dr. Lam Library.,1401580800,,177,4.5

4261177,5,B0044GG6AE,"Love it. More challenging than part one. Flows well from first half. All of the Dr. Lam dvds are great. If your arthritis is not too severe, I would recommend Tai Chi for Energy or Tai Chi for Beginners.",1391731200,9,203,4.230769230769231

4261182,5,B0044GG6AE,"I haven't got to participate in this DVD yet, but I will. I am taking a class in Tai Chi and I am enjoying it. The class will be starting in this DVD and I wanted to practice at home so I could be good at it. Dr. Lam explains things to you before you actually do the lesson and why it is so important to do such things- like to keep your knees bent slightly, etc. All of Dr. Lam's DVD's are excellent for any one that has aches and pains. These lessons are easy on the aches and pains because they are slow and gentle on the joints and movements of the body.",1368576000,2,558,3.860869565217391

4261184,5,B0044GG6AE,"Dr. Lam is easy to follow and repeats things.  You can do the warmup and cooldown for each lesson or do more than one lesson at a time.  He also has a class made up of people at different levels of movement, even one man doing all the exercises while seated.",1360022400,2,258,4.03921568627451
4261185,5,B0044GG6AE,"It has been my experience that DVD exercise instructors and instructions are often difficult to follow.  But, Dr. Lam's instructions are clear.  He explains things well and shows the forms from front and back.  I am certified to teach Tai Chi for Arthritis - Part 1 and learned the program from the DVD before I attended the certification class.  Even though nothing beats 'in person' instruction from a qualified teacher, I felt completely comfortable and was way ahead of every one else in the class.",1358380800,2,502,4.870588235294117

8416102,5,B0044GG6AE,"great extension of part one. As always, he proceeds through each lesson three times thoroughly and patiently, which is helpful and encouraging. It may be better to have a live instructor, but I can't imagining one who would equal his teaching on DVD.
