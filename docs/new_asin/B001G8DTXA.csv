8304448,5,B001G8DTXA,"""Mala: Secret Agent of the South Seas"" is a brilliant adaptation of one of Republic Pictures' best serials, ""Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island"" (1936). Directed by ace action directors Ray Taylor and Mack V. Wright, the original 14-chapter serial has secret agent Mala taking on enemy agents and saboteurs on an island fuel base, Clipper Island, somewhere in the Pacific. In partnership with the lovely and resourceful Princess Melani, they overcome several obstacles and death-defying cliffhanger escapes worthy of the best Republic serials.
Buck the Dog and Rex the Horse just about steal the show, but there's plenty of competition from Republic regulars John Dilson, the uniquitous George Chesebro, William Newell, Bob Kortman, John Piccori and George Cleveland.
Not that the original needed a lot of improvement, this Serial Squadron adaption was made bearing in mind that modern audiences are more likely to watch serials on DVD than on the big screen over 12 to 15 weeks as they were originally shown. The seven chapters remove the extraneous credits between chapters, repetitive material and tighten up the cliffhanger sequences. And to top it off they have made some modest, unobtrusive and calculated colourisation of key scenes.
The result is a serial that moves at a cracking pace with all the action you can handle deftly edited by William Witney and Helene Turner who went on to work together on the first Dick Tracy serial. Of course, the young Witney used his editing and his all-round filmmaking skills to become the premier serial and action film-maker at Republic and one of Hollywood's finest action directors right up until the 1970s.
The original serial was cleverly edited into a 100-minute film for television in 1966. Until the coming of home video, this adaption, entitled ""Robinsopn Crusoe of Mystery Island"", was for many viewers the only way to see this serial.
""Mala: Secret Agent of the South Seas"" is now the best way to see this serial. This is highly recommended and one hopes kids and teenagers will take the opportunity to join us oldies in enjoying some good old-fashioned action and adventure.",1369267200,3,2131,5.091428571428572
8304449,1,B001G8DTXA,"Mmmkay, so the Serial Squadron took a rotten serial, truncated it, added color effects, and further monkeyed with it to make it ""better"". Uh-huh. So here's my advice, serial fans: don't buy it at all, the ULTIMATE truncation. Now, you've not only made the serial 'better' but you've just saved fifteen bucks.

The Serial Squadron is capable of outstanding work (see their GANG BUSTERS for example) but this is their work at its worse. Over at [...] we're making this our Worst DVD Release of the Month.",1222905600,3,502,4.7701149425287355
