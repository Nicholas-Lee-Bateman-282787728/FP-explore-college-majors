6382642,5,B00JPFTW1E,"I don't know why the film wasn't a hit at the Box Office but it was a hit for me when I watched it at the movie theater with a group of people, it's not a chick flick, it's for everyone Men & Women! I thought the acting was phenomenal, the humor worked at every moment it hit, the emotions was surreal and it had a universal story line that I can relate and saw myself in the movie as the men the single moms fell in love with! Keep up the good work Mr. Perry, I think you're doing a fantastic job!!! Can't wait for your next production, either it's Madea or not!!!! I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone, Tyler Perry fans or not Tyler Perry fans!!! Getting this one for my Tyler Perry collection definitely!!!",1401494400,85,706,4.160583941605839
6382643,2,B00JPFTW1E,"Don't get me wrong. I'm a fan of Tyler Perry's movies. My wife and I own a copy of every movie he's made until the last couple.
That being said, the reason is because of products like this one. The story was poorly paced, seemed to be killing time more than anything else. The funny parts were weak. The emotional parts were weak. And Tyler is particularly good at those. Acting was so-so. Even the editing could have been better, fixing some of the timing of the story. 15 minutes into it I started thinking about other things I could be doing, and I wanted to like this movie. This looks like a beginner's effort.
A few years ago Tyler Perry was at his best. He's been in steady decline ever since. This movie was treated more like one of his cheap TV sitcoms than getting the big movie treatment. Very forgettable.",1400716800,31,817,4.381578947368421

6382650,5,B00JPFTW1E,I couldn't relate too this personally but I had to give it to the cast they put aside their differences and became the best of friends when they had to depend on one another to get to the storyline that was the best part,1523491200,,220,4.0227272727272725

6382657,2,B00JPFTW1E,"Tyler Perry, while being very smart and funny, produces films that are hit and miss like any writer/director.  Unfortunately, this one was not really entertaining for me.  I like Why Did I Get Married, Why Did I Get Married 2, Diary of a Mad Black Woman...and some Madea comedies.  I just didn't really like Single Mom's Club that much; a single Mom might get more out of it.",1510531200,,375,4.485294117647059

6382682,3,B00JPFTW1E,"This movie is pretty good, but it was a little confusing.  It wanted to be a rom-com, but the lack of music throughout it made it come across as much more of a drama, which was too bad because some wonderfully witty light-hearted parts could have been quite amusing with some fun music playing during those scenes to really bring out the humor.  Otherwise, the acting, dialogue, and plot were all good, but a movie needs more than just good writing and acting (with Nia Long as a stand out with her incredible acting talent).  It's the music that ties it all together.  Lastly, the emotional connection between the very different women was lovely, but it seemed to come out of thin air.  The viewer needed to see a bit more of the formation of their camaraderie so that their ensuing bong didn't feel like such a big leap.  Again, it wsa a good movie, but unfortunately, too much prevented it from being great.",1485475200,,910,4.5182926829268295

6382686,4,B00JPFTW1E,"A movie about 5 single mothers, from various backgrounds, who bond together and become each others support system and create a support group.  The women were engaging enough to be believed in and the men that come in their lives are right on time  From what I understand, Tyler created this movie as a tribute to his own mother and the strength she showed when raising him.  All I have to say it, if this film is of any indication, then he did her very proud.",1484352000,,459,4.313953488372093
6382687,5,B00JPFTW1E,"Saw this movie in parts.  could never see the beginning or the end.  when I finally saw the entire movie , I was very impressed with the different roles each woman played.  As a single mother, we do have these issues but they are manageable, if we allow ourselves to live and possible fail at some things.  I 'm a witness it will not kill you, just build a stronger relationship with you and your child.............  Good job Tyler.",1484265600,,432,4.417721518987341

6382819,3,B00JPFTW1E,"I really enjoyed the premise of the movie, and found the mothers situations with parenting relate-able.  I got pulled down by stereotypical race issues though...  a poor black woman, a hispanic woman dominated by a man, cold white woman, etc....  What really ruined the movie for me was that the only way that each woman was able to better her situation was through a relationship with a man.  Not just any man, mind you, but a perfect man who is the knight in shining armor.  I would have rather seen how each woman raised herself up.  It had funny parts, but I won't see it again.",1470268800,,582,4.443396226415095

No offense to Tyler Perry, but I wasn't looking for a ""Tyler Perry"" type of movie to watch which is why I originally did not even take a second look at this movie.

6382908,4,B00JPFTW1E,"I liked the movie (I think Tyler Perry is amazing) & I thought the parent/child relationships were very real. The only thing that was unrealistic, to me, was that all the white people were rich. In the world I live in (the real world) there are poor white people. I am white & I have 3 children, have been a single mother since my oldest, who is now 16, was 2. My oldest 2 have a father (a white father) who doesn't work, pay child support, see the kids & has 5 different kids by 4 different mothers. I have worked since I was 14 yrs old (I am now 35) but I have also been on welfare/food stamps. I have also been to prison for drugs. I am a good mother & I love my kids more than anything in the world but I do struggle financially. I know talking about my own life experiences is not describing the movie but I'm just saying, not all white people are rich. Lol. But besides being unrealistic, in my opinion, as far as that goes, it was a good movie about the struggles of single mothers, raising children & sisterhood. ;-)",1468195200,,1024,4.125

Their kids do something and they are focused to bond together. Then single Moms club is formed. Don't want to spoil it for you!! It's a Great movie !! Definitely give it a shot!!,1467849600,,314,4.163934426229508

6382913,4,B00JPFTW1E,"Here's my take.  I would pay to see this movie and would recommend it to others because, for once, I don't have to worry about language and violence.  I am very tired of people getting shot, and there's very little creativity in that.  Women and men are interesting in this movie without being type cast. The plot is realistic.  I took a chance on watching this, and I'm so glad I did.  Excellent acting!!  I loved all of the characters.",1467849600,,437,4.4
6382914,4,B00JPFTW1E,"It was rewarding and good to watch.  How five women came together, different backgrounds, yet they all had something in common. They were

6382949,4,B00JPFTW1E,"Not one of Tyler Perry's best - but it's hard to capture all the ""single mom's"" issues, make it funny, and really get at the parts that in depth, in the short amount of time used to get to know all the players - which I think could have been developed better, but, as a whole, a nice movie. Jan, the 'woman in a man's world' that has to prove that a working mother can get the job done better than a man, and a younger one at that, who really wants her job. Hillary the wife of a lawyer, who's divorcing her and their children, and now has to cope with a limited budget (no nanny) and actually raising her children. Esperanza, with her boyfriend, and issues of insecurity. May, the aspiring writer, who wrote the ""single mom's"" book, but who kept a very important secret from her son, and last but not least, Lytia, the hard working mother who has an exception son, that she worries over, and in turn her over protectiveness due to past experiences, leads to her distancing herself from her son. An incident involving all of their children, brings these 5 women together, to form a support group for single mothers. While supposedly from a diverse background, this opportunity gives them a chance to bond, grow, relax from the demands of being a single parent, if only for a moment...and most of all the strength to go after what's important to them and their children.",1466467200,,1369,4.45816733067729

Although we both felt the part of the plot wherein the female characters with their particular backgrounds, came together due to their children getting in trouble at their private school is unlikely, the points made about the plight of single moms, difficulties existing regardless of ethnicity and social status, and how single parents can benefit from a support group was well made. I think that is the point of the movie.

I don't like a lot of the junk in movies so I have to search until I find one worth watching that I consider to be clean. I love most things Tyler Perry so how could I go wrong with this movie? Tyler Perry actually does play a part in this movie and I like that although the scenarios were about real life situations, they weren't dealt with in a heavy manner. You are still able to watch the movie and see it for the comedic style Tyler Perry does so well. The actresses were great and really stepped into their roles of single moms and women coming together for one another. The child actors were great and Terry Crews just makes anything good. He's like the cherry on top with sprinkles. I took me about a week to watch it because I kept falling asleep but I really wanted to see the movie so each night I would try to stay awake and I finally finished watching The Single Moms Club and it was definitely worth it. I would recommend this movie as a being clean without a bunch of trash in it. A few off colored, sideways jokes but for what I've seen just in the previews of other movies, I'll take this one. Worth watching.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tyler-Perry-s-Single-Moms-Club/dp/B00M0HZXEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tyler Perry's Single Moms Club</a>",1464134400,4,1419,4.68

6383045,5,B00JPFTW1E,"Luv the story line. All women should have a club that they can meet up with other women be it a club where they can go and talk about family issues like ""Bravo's There's Goes the Motherhood"" which is about single mothers.  It would be nice  for seniors , working women, young women etc. you get the jest. It's about connecting and becoming more than friends especially when you are sharing your personal issues.  It's hard to meet people in today's world with the exception of Facebook which is not for everyone.  In order to bond with others you need to meet in person. There may be club like knitting clubs and crocheting and art etc. But are they all at the YWCA? There's not enough clubs around especially in the neighborhoods.",1463616000,,731,4.515151515151516

6383048,4,B00JPFTW1E,"I enjoyed the movie single moms club. Even though they come from diverse backgrounds, what was lacking in the five moms  that came out later in the movie was, that special one on one time to get to know their children. The biggest problem with children today and teenagers as well is the parents is not spending quality time to get to know their children. I work retail in one of largest department store chains and I have seen the parents let the children do whatever they want whenever they want as the parents immerse themselves into buying and spending, meanwhile the children either destroy the store and get hurt in the process. I have read some of the negative comments and they are so funny but not necessary to discuss about the different characters. One of my critiques is  that I would have liked to see the Latin woman have one on one quality time with her daughter before bringing her boyfriend home with her. Tyler you put a little ""First Wives Club"", flair in it but other than that enjoyable on all levels.",1463529600,2,1022,4.518918918918919

Seems like suggesting single moms should be strong, at least for Tyler, they still have to have a heterosexual love interest. Women can be strong, sweet, cute and single with or without children, and have a great life with or without a man.",1463443200,,329,4.409836065573771

Now....with that said; I'm grateful that I finally seen this movie! (Hate to sound like 'Tony the Tiger') but this movie was GREAT!!! I related to all of the characters in this movie. I've worked two jobs (one part time and the other full time) as well as being an entrepreneur selling all types of products just to make ends meet. Having to answer so many questions from my son! But at the end of the day this movie had taken pieces of my life and placed them in each of the characters. Single moms, please take some tips from this movie! God....that movie was a breath of fresh air for me. We mothers constantly hear that we are not alone. But there are times that we feel that way. This movie put us on the map, in the fore front! This movie made me feel awesome! Because I'm not alone, I stand with all single mothers out there. And when I make a mistake......it's ok! I'm human!! Single moms, this movie will make you laugh, cry, go home and hug your kids tighter and tell them for the millionth time how much more you love them. And the male characters are refreshing to the eyes...wink wink!! Thank you Mr. Tyler Perry........THANK YOU!!

6383411,4,B00JPFTW1E,Personally I was pleasantly surprised with this. I actually avoided watching this movie because at least one of the moms seemed thrown in there. After actually seeing the premise of how they got together it seemed more realistic. The only thing that was not realistic was the scene when the son was missing and they stopped looking for the son because she was upset and told them to leave. I could not imagine where that would happen in real life.  I also like that the white women fell for the contractor this time.,1450051200,,516,4.548387096774194

Took what was finally turning out to be a good film and dragged it down. I'd give it a *** star, but I've seen so many really, really awful movies on Prime that this one stood out as ""exceptional.""

I thought that many of the storylines around motherhood were very strong and interesting, but like most Tyler Perry movies they focus on women having to find a man. I thought it would be more interesting if at the end of the film, not every woman ended up with a man that made her happy, but rather a strong, genuine bond with her child. For many ""single moms"" a significant other isn't always right around the corner (thus the term single mother). Besides, that, it was okay and predictable as most of his films are.",1437177600,,568,4.524271844660194

His serious movies (except Good Deeds) are good (Temptations) to very good (Why Did I get Marrieds) to surprisingly powerful (4 Colored Girls). But this one. He was asleep at the wheel. Weak cast/acting (even the beautiful Nia Long couldn't pick it up), whack story line full of stereotypes and cliches, and just downright boring. It was difficult to keep paying attention because you didn't really care what happened to anyone on the movie. Assuming you couldn't already guess. Just not a good film.

6385737,2,B00JPFTW1E,"The movie was okay. It would have been better if he hadn't used one of the characters (Esperanza (sp?) from his tv show, If loving you is wrong,  and her exact story line.  Hell, he didn't even change her name.  What happened to Tyler Perry anyway?  He has gotten lazy over the years.  All of his TV shows  are begging for a more realistic conversations.  It is as if he can only write 5 minutes of dialog and then he stretches it out into either a half hour or an hour long show.  Now it is also happening in his movies.  Note to TP:  People do not talk like that, you are making a lot of very talented actors and actresses look slow and untalented.  STOP IT!!!!",1433289600,,663,4.141732283464567

6386119,1,B00JPFTW1E,"My expectations were pretty low to begin with, but the bad acting and awful writing really disappointed.  So if this was supposed to be a light heart-ed dramedy about the struggles and triumphs of single moms of various backgrounds it failed.  The worst part is that instead of the women becoming independent and empowered, they all end up shacked up with men by the end.  Screenplays where women need a knight in shining armor are a dime a dozen, this movie is more offensive because it's trying to pretend that it isn't perpetuating misogynist ideals.",1431907200,4,553,4.8

I had not seen any previews for this movie at all so I didn't know what to expect. I am very shocked that some people did not like this move. It was a long movie but in a good way. I put this movie on while doing my work thinking it could just be some background noise. Lets just say I didn't get much work done. I am very please yet again with Tyler Perry's movies. He presents real issues and turns them into great movies. I am not a mother but I really enjoyed every character in the movie. It was hard not to like  anyone except the ex husbands. I usually don't write reviews but I just really wanted to encourage everyone to watch this movie.

I am not a single mom but  as a mother and a person who has experienced bad relationships, I feel that this movie really hit home on a lot of hardships with a very positive realistic solution. I really like the way they put together the idea of unity and sisterhood between moms; it's so important for us to stick together.

On one hand, it's nice that the group of women is a mixed one in terms of ethnicity, background, etc. but all of that is just a superficial ploy to get viewers hooked. The whole movie goes down the toilet with stereotypical characters who ALL end up with men, which in itself sort of cheapens the idea of independent single women celebrating their worth and strength. It's as if the whole idea of independence is just a facade until these women can find men to fill the voids in their lives. Furthermore, I was really put off by how the men these women end up with are a direct match with their respective ethnicities and economic standings. Way to think outside the box in terms of what women can achieve!",1429228800,2,826,4.587837837837838

What I like about Tyler Perry's movies is that they're entertaining while touching on issues that many of us can relate to. This movie touched base on what it was like for women who have to deal with being a single mom- trying to juggle life, a career/job, while providing for their kids and keeping them in line.

6387004,2,B00JPFTW1E,"I would have liked this movie--maybe--but it was FILLED with stereotypes from start to finish. All the white females were educated, affluent and attractive. Even the Hispanic female was attractive with a hot sex life. And then came the black females. Of course, the only overweight women on the planet are dark-skinned black females. And the black male that would like such a ""creature"" had to loud and ignorant and ""ghetto.""

And to put the icing on the cake, the overweight, ignorant, on the verge of violent black female transforms herself into a black mammy at the sight of a crying white baby because the white female mother was soooo helpless about being a ""single parent' as though this is a normal state of being for black females.

The saddest thing is this is a movie made by a black person (Tyler Perry) but I suspect even the black filmmakers must succumb to the Hollywood code of conduct for black characters or they won't get their pictures distributed and shown.

This movie flops for all the reasons above. I would NOT recommend it.",1428624000,,1048,4.715846994535519

The cast was enjoyable, in fact, everything about the movie was fun, but the formulaic script kept it from being as good as it should have been with the caliber of actresses and actors in the film. It has momentary flashes of being something really good, but then 2, 3, 4 cliches hit and ruin it. And, the only reason I can think that Tyler Perry cast himself in this movie is a) he didn't want to hire another actor or b) he wanted to smooch all over Nia Long. Overall, a good cast ruined by a cliche ridden script that kept me on the edge of total exasperation.",1428105600,,644,4.16

6387150,1,B00JPFTW1E,"I would count Tyler Perry movies as one of my few ""guilty pleasures"" and I know no one else who would watch them with me. I'm okay with that. The movies themselves aren't usually all that great, but I usually enjoy them for the message he embeds.

This ""Single Moms Club,"" though is probably about his worst so far. The story itself doesn't flow naturally. It seems they go from strangers to ""besties"" overnight. The ""walls"" topple too quickly. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think it worked, unless it's because they're all so lonely; that has to be it.

The scripting was terrible, the acting mostly wooden. And Tyler Perry was about the worst. He should not have cast himself in this one.

As others mentioned, the scenes - yes, we get treated to this line of conversation more than once - with the mom and her neighbor discussing building sets was over-the-top awful. We are to believe she didn't understand the double entendres going back and forth or that he might have been ""flirting"" with her? And the Moms Club thought that type of flirting from a man she didn't even know was awesome? Huh?

And the scene with the couple outside the truck? Would that woman -any ""strong"" woman, black or otherwise - really have caved so quickly? That whole thing embarrassed me.

Tyler Perry movies usually have a strong moral message to offer the audience and that's why I like them. That's why I watch. This movie's message was MIA. And I watched this entire movie.

I will say this, though: ""Single Moms Club"" probably has the highest production quality of all Tyler Perry movies. Sadly we don't get a whole package. I'm glad I didn't make a movie of it or drag my husband to a theater to watch.  It's that bad.",1428105600,5,1708,4.525974025974026

Each child has caused considerable havoc after not being picked up on time after school. The principal requires each mother to work with the others on a school function in order for the child to stay at the academy. (Not such a bad idea. Wonder if it would work in real life.)

Guess you can figure the plot from there, but..the acting was so much better than I've seen in most  movies that aim to please. I've encountered  all five lead actors in other productions, and each is a class act. And the script was truthful as well, within the constraints of the genre. No kid became picture-perfect by the end of the movie. Women friendships helped matters, but the distinctness of each woman was maintained.",1428019200,6,858,4.74496644295302

One over-weight, bad wig wearing mother with no man,5 children, 3 at home, 2 locked up. That not being bad enough another Black woman who babysat for her told her she needed to stay home and let the government take care of her.  Nia Long's character was not a Black stereotype but her husband of course, was absent from the home and was a drug addict who broke his son's heart by stealing from him.

The women are all unique in their own ways but share the same woes as they blindly navigate their way through single parenting and romance. It's funny (Amy Smart is great!) and Tyler Perry tastefully explores some of the stereotypes we have about race, parenting, and the other sex. Nia Long is the star of the show but no one makes as big of an impact on the screen as Cocoa Brown, who had me in stitches. Great for a girls' night or in my case while exercising on the treadmill.",1427328000,,586,4.644230769230769

Though there was truth in the comment, ""We all want the same thing....some help!"", this movie stops short of having any real benefit aside challenging the perception that single moms are all ""welfare queens"". I do like that the proposed solution is that like helps like, which I think is most probable solution. I guess I just want to see this critical topic explored as a documentary in more depth than a movie for entertainment's sake. I want more data, I want to know what the solution is.

6387517,4,B00JPFTW1E,I recently watched this movie with my family. I thought the story line was ok and the way the ladies come together to support one another is great. Mr. Perry likes dealing with drugs in his movies and the impact they have on the family. This theme is dealt with over and over again in his movies and again in this one. Each time I see this theme in one of his movies it is extremely sad and emotional. I hope one day the numbers of drug abusers and those addicted will be few enough that he can address other topics that are important to families.,1427068800,,547,4.169811320754717

This movie would have been so much more authentic and inspiring had the women picked up the hammer & nails and solved their own problems, rather than rely on men to swoop in and rescue them.  As a single mom, I found this movie offensive.",1426723200,2,485,4.807228915662651

6387793,4,B00JPFTW1E,It is your typical Tyler Perry fare. I do like the fact that he portrayed the struggles of single parenthood very well although the reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I felt the ending was abrupt and wrapped up just little too neat for me.,1426377600,,245,4.125

6387827,2,B00JPFTW1E,"I'm going to say it, I have yet to find a Tyler Perry movie that I really ""like"". My mom really loved the movie, but having been a single mom myself at one point, I thought this would be the one for me to watch. I can't say it impressed me. For a movie that is supposed to be about women being empowered and lifting each other up, I didn't find them to be a good support group. Amy Smart's character was annoying. And having one woman complain that she couldn't cut the ties to her emotionally abusive ex because she ""won't give up the lifestyle she has become accustomed to"" just really irked me. I'm sorry, Tyler Perry, maybe you need to meet some average single moms and find out how they really live.",1426032000,,704,4.222222222222222

The intersecting story-lines of each role seemed too forced.  Terry Crews, Cocoa Brown, and Wendi McLendon-Covey made it pretty funny.  Sorta cute movie.",1420070400,,328,5.018518518518518
6387894,4,B00JPFTW1E,"while this movie got a bad review, I personally liked it.  I like it when Tyler Perry plays a guy, not a large loud black woman with saggy breasts.  the movie is something you watch with your girls, when enjoying a girl night at home not your man (as he will fall asleep).  You see different women who have nothing in common but the  fact that they are single moms who love their kids and want was is best for them.  Some moms are single by choice, by divorce, by abandonement, and are not really willing to let other men into their lives.  But as I said I liked it and have watched it multiple times",1419984000,,600,4.129310344827586

It will evoke all of your emotions from deep, deep laughter, tears, sadness, a moment of panic and perhaps, some regrets from past mistakes. However, in the end, you'll feel even more inspired that life always has a way of working things out. This movie is so hilarious because you have 5 distinct personalities in these 5 most unlikely females to find much in common, let alone, bond and form lifelong relationships.  As I sit here and write this review, I am smiling because I know that I am going to re-watch this movie.
I'm not a spoiler, but I will say that all of the actors and actors did a superb job of giving their characters ""real life!

The very talented, Tyler Perry appeared to have cut corners with this movie.  This movie was more for television than theater quality.",1417996800,,398,4.12987012987013

It has its funny parts but I don't think the director or writer was taking the viewer to funny, a light change from time to time but funny , NO. being a single mom or dad for that matter it not funny, its hard work and never enough time. The one part that I wasn't crazy about is the end, they all end up ""Happier ever after"", that generally doesn't happen and certainly not to 5 friends at the same time.

The most damming I had read argued how the movie was all about these desperate and racially-stereotyped women who needed men to come and save them from their miserable lives. That is not the movie I watched. It was a light comedy with a little drama mixed in. It was funny enough and entertaining. Yes, there are stereotypes, but I didn't find them to be abused or overboard. Yes, there are men, but I didn't see them as saviors, more like companions. And anyway, you can't have a romcom without the rom :). I'd say, don't expect much more than a light, funny and sometimes touching movie and you'll enjoy it.",1417305600,,762,4.335664335664336

The five women who reside at the center of Tyler Perrys The Single Moms Club are united by the fact that their misbehaving children have all been put on probation by the private school they attend. In response to this and other issues, the gals form their own support group to help them cope with the very real and very specific challenges they face trying to rear children on their own.

The women represent a neat (a little too neat, perhaps) cross section of modern America, culled from a variety of races and economic strata, differences that are ultimately obliterated by the common bond of single motherhood. The movie focuses on the compromises - financial, moral, personal and romantic - that these harried women have to make in order to get through life.

Though The Single Moms Club is slightly less cartoonish than many of Perrys previous films (no Madea in sight!) and it does offer some insights into the struggles facing such women, the movie, as a whole, lacks the verisimilitude needed to make the material convincing. For all the fine actresses that Perry has assembled for his cast (Nia Long, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Zulay Henao, Cocoa Brown and Amy Smart), the characters themselves lean too much towards the stereotypical and clichd - the sassy, plus-sized black woman whose husband and two oldest boys are in the poky; the uptight, snooty rich white woman whos making her way up the corporate ladder and, thus, had her daughter through artificial insemination; the petite suburban blond with the hunky, albeit sensitive, next door neighbor, etc.

Perry himself appears, not in drag this time, portraying the romantic interest of one of the mothers. Brooklyn Nine-Nines Terry Crews is also one of the men in the cast.

But its the five actresses who rise, if only partially, above all the slickery and goo.",1414540800,,1831,4.893548387096774

6388064,1,B00JPFTW1E,"I wish I could rate this lower than 1 star. I'm not a big Tyler Perry fan but he does have some movies that have a moment here or there. But this movie was Tyler Perry at his worst. HUGE cliches- Tyler Perry just doesn't do context or nuance. Everything is so direct. Every line has to mean exactly what it's supposed to mean. Every situation goes exactly how you think it's going to go and the spoilers are usually so ludicrous they aren't spoilers they are just bombshells-they come out of nowhere and blow the up the whole story. Tyler Perry is one of the greatest media entrepreneurs of our time, but conceiving, writing, directing, and producing 4 movies and 2 television series is a bit much. I wish he'd give some younger writers and directors a chance to hone and perfect their craft. He'd probably get better stories and better execution.",1410307200,11,847,4.542483660130719

6388069,5,B00JPFTW1E,"The movie was a surprising change from what you would expect from Tyler.

6388087,5,B00JPFTW1E,I love this movie. It's about the women who are taking care of their children and don't always have time to think about their own needs or wants. Nobody ever believe that there are women like that and give them credit for raising their children. The children are normally ungrateful as in this movie and everything else in the story. I may have missed my Mr. Right for raising my child. But I was there. They don't remember. And now......  This is an excellent movie. I can watch it over and over again!

She threatens to go to court to get more money from him if he dares obejct or if he dares speak.  Some of the kids were nice but the movie glorifies the kids who were very rude to their moms.

6388165,4,B00JPFTW1E,"good movie, though some parts could have been more dramatic and answered more questions...like in the case of a missing child....the babysitting friend would have shown much more guilt and sobbing/begging for forgiveness in the suv, also why didn't they search the fathers neighborhood in the movie, anyway I commend the sisterly love , part about gays not necessary (desensitization techniques) but TP ...does not represent the Bible much anymore so don't expect it. business is business.  As far as entertainment goes.....great movie and pretty clean compared to many others. I also really enjoyed the idea of women from different races, class and walks of life loving one another and being LOYAL friends.......because money will never solve all problems and true friendships are PRICELESS :) Oh and the awkward turn romantic kiss by the truck had us rolling with laughter! Oh and the middle school issues with the children in the movies were quite palpable!",1408060800,,960,5.193548387096774

It would have been great if there was more direct focus on the lives of 2 or 3 of the characters OR just make the movie a little longer with a more detailed storyline.,1408060800,,316,4.543859649122807

The scene where they are talking about the enchanted garden with the girl and neighbor was cheap, immature, pathetic and completely  rediculous. Not to mention boring overdone and way stupid. I expected a whole lot more from this movie! I was extremely turned off by the lack of thought. And the other scene where the boy ran away, lets get real, they could have done more with that to make it seem real. The other actors didn't take it seriously, and the mom didn't freak out untill she got home, then she yells at everyone to leave and get out of her house. Nobody in there right mind would leave in a time like that, they would have went out searching somewhere else. Poor poor script.",1407974400,13,838,4.441558441558442

And they don't need to feel bad about. It touched on the topics of single moms in the corporate world, single moms with controlling ex's (they want to be able to move on, but don't want you to), middle class single moms and even Moms working hard, trying to stay off welfare. From Corporate to Middle class to the Ghetto (and even married Military moms like me, who raise their kids on their own when Uncle Sam needs daddy), we all have one thing in common, we LOVE and want the best for our children. Yes, some of the acting could use some work, but over all, it was a very good movie, with a powerful message for Moms!",1407456000,31,771,4.398601398601398

6388237,5,B00JPFTW1E,"I didn't go to this movie in theaters because I didn't know what to expect. I thought it was going to be some complete comedy with no seriousness or reality. I proved myself wrong. It approached some common, but challenging issues single mothers go through. It provides an accent on the stress single moms deal inside themselves, and projects how challenging parenting can be when you're single.

With a little more detail: Their children were approximately in middle school and disobeyed rules (technically legal laws). The mothers were forced to work together from the schools regulations. They conflicted with each other at first. Each mom's situation is very different from the others. But a connection slowly formed revealing the similarities in the individual challenges, providing support for each other, and trying to enjoy life.

Also, men were added in the picture/story, but they are not the main focus of how the women handle the stress their life. Men were included because it relates to what single moms may go through with their ex-husband, or establishing/developing relationship with another man. It also provides a good closure for creating a positive ending, since movies can't continue going on and on, like someone's life does. The issues between the mom and child(s) also relate to what parents often experience anyway.

I'm not providing my personal life, but I correlate to what the women and their children are individually experiencing, in more than one area/situation. Some people who haven't experienced relationships with similarities to the challenges (or seen another person's/friend's similar challenges) probably won't enjoy the movie as much as people who have.",1406851200,17,1695,5.29368029739777

This movie is lacking on soooo many levels...I must keep it real. Tyler Perry, I realize that everyone can have a bad day; you definitely dropped the ball on this one...it is clearly a low for you, but I still love you and I anticipate that your next movie will make-up for this dud...lol...oh my gosh...I want my money back!!!!

6388249,5,B00JPFTW1E,"I missed seeing this when it was in the movies and paid to rent it on Amazon Prime today.  Overall, I enjoyed this movie.  There were a few things I would have liked to see different.  Why couldn't the struggling mom be someone other than a black woman?  Struggling single parents comes in all races.  Nia Long's character was a notch better, but cmon, a drug addict for her son's father?  Why couldn't one of the women with color have the beautiful house with a housekeeper and a successful moneygrubbing professional for a husband?  A character I was thinking of made me think of Angela Bassett's character in ""Waiting to Exhale.""  At any rate, I did enjoy the movie, would love to see a part two.  Part one deals with how disconnected one feels without connecting with others in similar circumstances.  Once they connect, it is nice how they begin working things out.  Part two would deal with how their relationships work out, how the children work out and how the relationship with their ex works out.  I loved how the group was comprised of a variety of women.  The women did seem unhappy until there was male interaction/intervention, I would have liked seeing these women becoming empowered by themselves.  Sharing and working out their problems themselves, the men would be a good addition, but not the end all be all.  In short, loved the movie, will buy the DVD to add to my collection.

Not even the bloopers at the end were funny! I spent the entire time completely boggled by how bad it was.

I think the book that is used for a prop in the movie could still become more believable and be expounded upon with more stories of children and single moms.,1406505600,,358,4.5625
6388283,5,B00JPFTW1E,I personally liked this movie over many that Tyler has put out in the last few years because to me it represented sisterhood.  I could relate to most of the women in this movie and that was really nice because after I saw the movie once I looked at it again.  Everyone has a different opinion about this movie but it showed strength in many different ways and to me in this day and time we as woman need to be encourage.  Yes many of you are right everyone does not end of with a man in these situations but it was nice to see it nontheless because for me it gives a little hope for those who are still looking for a mate.,1406505600,20,622,4.0

It was captivating in terms of the many situations the mothers were in, it was entertaining. Could have played up on the humor, for example, the wood puns with the neighbor carpenter cold have been played up a bit more. The acting was great, you immediately related to the actors and I do like Tyler Perry's ""movies with a message"". This one portrays several mothers and as having the tough end of a divorce. As a divorced father I can't help but wonder if Tyler Perry also sees the father side. Fathers don't always the strong force in a divorce. In most states as a no-fault divorce the fathers are powerless in terms of child custody. Even when income is the same, and proof is presented where the mother's choices clearly show that the children should not be with her. Perhaps there is a movie in there Mr. Perry.

I was married, but felt like a single mom, because my husband was never around so I had to make all decisions. It's a lonely job, and this movie shows that. We as woman have to stick together no matter what our backgrounds are, or how much money we have to work with.
