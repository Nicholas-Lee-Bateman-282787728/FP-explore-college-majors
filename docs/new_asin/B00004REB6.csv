7920739,3,B00004REB6,"This documentary explores different cultures and rituals of Tribal Africa in the early 80's. Set against a background score of stereotypical African drums, and a commentary to match, Shocking Africa takes the viewer through tribal villages, and into the huts of witch-doctors, using some very 'unorthodox' methods of fertilisation for women, tribesmen performing ceremonial mass circumcisions, 'adjusting' facial features and many other rites considered 'socially unacceptable' for those of us born and raised in the west.

Interesting to watch once, but some disturbing images, which may remain in one's mind for a long time.",1309392000,,626,5.659574468085107
7920740,5,B00004REB6,Africa Addio is one of the greatest achievements of documentary film making. It presented a balanced view of the white and black situation in Africa. But beware the picture was reedited for reissue with Sweet Sweetbacks Bad Song. It was redited and they totally destroyed the delicate balance of the original to pander to the urban black audiences. This is the version that seems to be available today. What a shame and an insult to two great film makers.,1044489600,6,455,4.772151898734177
7920741,4,B00004REB6,"Good but not great document on the savagery of post-colonial africa. If you do not want to know the truth about those dark day's just close your eye's and look away,and look for another film. Just remember that the film's visual's are pretty bad and some part's are kind of boring. But where else can you see the naked truth laid out before you?From tribal slaughter,unresricted poaching and just general choas. The last 15-20 min. is worth the price of the film,showing Mike Hoare's Mercenary group in heavy action against the Simba warriors,the only such footage that I know to exist.",1038787200,4,586,4.811881188118812
7920742,1,B00004REB6,"This is the worst propaganda film I have ever seen. First of all I ordered Africa Addio and recieved Africa Blood and Guts,seconcondly it started out as a national geographics documentary,and evolved to the worst piece of garbage with it misrepresensations,out right lies and degradingf portrayals of africans .I wish I had my money back",1031011200,5,337,5.1454545454545455
7920743,5,B00004REB6,"The original Italian title ""Africa Addio..!"" (Goodbye Africa..!) is a far more appropriate one, though there is plenty of blood...ie, real fresh blood in this frequently gory, sometimes stunningly beautiful, and always highly controversial and terribly sad tale of the immediate aftermath of colonial rule in Africa.  This moving documentary has been censored by the politically-correct thought-police for so many years that many of those now watching it for the first time may be inclined to say something like - ""Gee, those days (the mid-60's)was a horrible time to be in Africa...""  They would be both right and wrong because since then Africa has gone from bad to worse and even worse than you can imagine.  The on the spot scenes of the terrible slaughter of the former overlords of Zanzibar - the Arab and Persian communities can never be forgotten...except of course they have been.  Today there is enough material available to make a new version of ""Africa Addio"" every week.  But don't hold your breath because it has been decreed by the faceless ones that ordinary people like you and I should not be allowed to see it.  To say that the most remarkable feature of this movie is that nobody has dared (in both senses - ie, the physical danger and the social ostracism )to do it again is to downplay the often stunning photography, especially the wildlife scenes which are as good as if not better than others of that genre.  An especially poignant scene was that of a beautiful fresh-faced blonde girl silhoutted against a huge setting sun as her and her family together with their few salvaged possessions trekked on horseback out of their Kenyan home to...who knows where..? Perhaps south to (the former) Rhodesia where no doubt some years later they were again forced south finally perhaps to South Africa and eventually back to the Cape of Good Hope where their Boer ancestors had begun their northward trek 150 years earlier.  The producers (Franco & Jacopetti Prosperi of ""Mondo Cane"" fame) performed the cardinal sin of making white-ruled South Africa look like paradise on earth.  But then they, unlike the critics had seen and compared both.  If you are at all interested in Africa, give yourself an education and watch this thought-provoking film.  HEALTH WARNING - Not for the faint-hearted or the politically-correct.",982972800,23,2338,4.969230769230769
