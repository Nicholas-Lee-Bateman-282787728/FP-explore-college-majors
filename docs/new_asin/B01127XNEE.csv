7316753,4,B01127XNEE,"This is a well done film with two performances (Cusak and Giamatti) that are so strong as to be almost overwhelming.  It is a very difficult film to watch.  If you are expecting a history of the Beach Boys with lots of Beach Boys music, this is not what this film offers.

It's a story about Brian Wilson's mental illness, the treatment of him by key people in his life, and the desperate attempts by his future wife to save him.  That relationship is beautifully played out.  Wilson's relationship with Giamatti's character is acted well, but it's just difficult to watch throughout the film.

I recently saw Amy, (and almost did not go, owing to my experience with this film).  The fact that Amy is done in actual video of Amy Winehouse creates more of an unfolding of a life, and a downfall (please see my review for more info), where the constant tension created by the actors in Love and Mercy is almost too much to handle.  I heard a number of other people commenting that they felt the same way that I did as they walked out of the theater..... calling the  film an unexpected ""downer"".

Why four stars?  Because I cannot deny that it's a good film:  just know what you are seeing beforehand.",1437696000,5,1199,4.474654377880184
7316754,5,B01127XNEE,"Love & Mercy takes the viewer into the mind, heart and ear of Brian Wilson.  For music lovers, this movie is a must. It takes you into the making of Pet Sounds in the studio.  You not only hear the songs as you know them, but you see, note for note, how the songs were created in studio: Wilson modifying the sheet by hand to blend key signatures; Wilson plucking the strings of a piano with bobby pins to create a never-before-heard sound on You Still Believe in Me.  A  heartfelt version of G-d Only Knows (with Paul Dano, a spot-on Wilson), demoed solo on piano, voice aching with emotion as he plays the song for the first time for his demanding father.

Past the music, we find a sweet, vulnerable, older Brian Wilson played by John Cusack, trying to win the heart of and find solace in Meilssa Ledbetter.  He writes a note when he meets her: ""Scared, Frightened, Lonely,"" and Melissa sees past the broken, frightened man to the genius within.  The 80s part of the movie focuses on her efforts to free Wilson from the control of domineering Gene Landry,  The movie is intense in parts, as Wilson suffers abuse at the hands of Landry and his father, and throughout, we find Wilson, the young and the older version, struggling to let his voice rise above and create.",1437696000,11,1269,4.463203463203463
7316755,5,B01127XNEE,Brilliantly conceived and acted - new insights into the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson even for those who have been there from day one.,1437436800,,132,4.541666666666667
7316756,5,B01127XNEE,"A confession - although I've always wished Brian Wilson a long, healthy life, secretly, I wished that I would outlive him - solely so that I'd be around to witness him finally getting his deserved avalanche of dues as a very important American songwriter. And I feared that would only happen upon his death. As a Beach Boys fan for 53 years (I was 16 when their music reached Portland, OR in 1962), I've lived through the 'intellectual' music community putting down his 'irrelevant' songs of surf, sunshine and summer. Many were those who believed that popular music, in the upheaval times of the 1960's, was only important if there was a political message woven in it. Then there was the crowd who required that rock hits be distorted sounding and brimming with anger. In their shortsightedness they often lumped his compositions in with Bubble Gum music of that era.

I saw this movie the day it came out. Since then (I'll admit to being somewhat compulsive), I've read no fewer than 50 professional reviews about it. With very few exceptions it has been widely heralded as well done, possibly Oscar-worthy, with a cast of players each of whom nailed their parts.

But I want to share how Love & Mercy hit me. Because I know his story so well (example: in the scene where he and Melinda are cruising his old Hawthorne, CA boyhood neighborhood, the movie depicts her driving, but, in truth, he was doing the driving when the event actually happened. Now, that's minutiae on my part!), I was very nervous that the movie would be a flop and that Brian Wilson's story would (again) be mishandled and misrepresented. But happily, the movie was excellent, but it wasn't very 'happy'. It's raw in it's truth-telling. Disquieting. But again, excellent.

I was taken most by the superb work done by Elizabeth Banks, John Cusack, and Paul Giamatti.  Paul Dano did a good job, but perhaps I'm too close to the story to give him his just due. My sole issue with his portrayal is that prior to the full onslaught of mental illness, Brian's persona was much more commanding - less skittery - than what Mr. Dano gave us. I realize that the writers, director and actors all listened to the session tapes of the making of Pet Sounds, but, to me, they chose to depict Brian as fragile from the outset of the movie. Mr. Dano says the same words Brian said in real life in the studio, but Dano gave us a more thin-skinned Brian way too early.

Many of the professional reviewers report that this movie is ultimately postive. But I was too done in by the depth of Brian's anguish and suffering, especially at the hands of Dr. Eugene Landy (Giamatti). The very best parts of this movie are the scenes showing how Pet Sounds was recorded, how huge Melinda Ledbetter (Banks) was as real-life hero, and how trapped, troubled and traumatized the older Wilson (Cusack) was.

I cannot wait until the DVD is released. I want to see the film again, now that I'm not so nervous for it's success. I want to see if the upbeat parts get more of my attention than during the first time around. PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS: this movie stands on it's own as being excellent, no matter if you know the protagonist, his music, or whether you like original rock n' roll. It is a great movie. Find some way to see it.",1437264000,10,3273,4.57679180887372
7316757,4,B01127XNEE,"Theatrical review.  This is only Bill Pohlad's second film as a director, with his only other effort being ""Old Explorers"" from 1990.  He takes an unusual approach in this Brian Wilson biopic.  Two adult actors play Wilson in different stages of their life.  Paul Dano plays the younger Brian, who with his siblings, a cousin and a good friend launched the Beach Boys musical group in the early 1960's.  John Cusack plays Brian in the 1980's while under the control of his psychologist, Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti).

The story isn't linear, as Pohlad goes back and forth between Wilson's early turmoil of dealing with the band's huge success with ""surfer"" music and the more complex music that was rattling around in his head.  He refused to go on the road with the band, instead he wanted to work in the studio.  Clearly mentally ill, Dano provides a terrific performance, enveloping Wilson and his various mood swings and eccentricities.  The older Wilson is under the unusual psychotherapy of Landy which includes 24-hour surveillance and over-medication and probable misdiagnosis.

The older Wilson decides he wants a new Cadillac and meets saleswoman Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks).  The fall for each other and begin dating, supervised by Landy and his associates.  History will prove that there were other interests that Landy had in Wilson other than his mental health.  Sometimes these numerous flashbacks and forward can be confusing or annoying but somehow this all makes sense.  To some degree, the time changes offer some relief from the troubled soul of Wilson.  Melinda offers a respite, not only for Brian, but for the audience.  And when she finally challenges Landy, you find yourself encouraging her to just smack him in the face.

These are excellent performances by all of the actors.  You have to appreciate Giamatti's creation of such a smarmy villain.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the music.  Not only the creation of some of Wilson/The Beach Boys most iconic songs (""God Only Knows"" and ""Good Vibrations"" stand out) but the overall score by Atticus Ross.  It is perfectly placed and sounds great.  The film stalls a bit here and there, but quickly gets back on track.  Technically the movie is well-made and well-acted and provides an honest look into the oft troubled life of Brian Wilson.",1437091200,17,2335,4.976744186046512
7316758,5,B01127XNEE,I went to the movies and saw the film 2 times and in tellin ya the movie was awesome !!!! But what worries me is I'm 100!% positive the movie was just over 2 hours long without the trailers now Amazon is saying its 1:45 minutes !!! Please don't tell me it got hacked up ! Even if u Wikipedia the movie it states its 2 hours ?????? What's up Amazon????,1436918400,2,351,3.9577464788732395
7316759,3,B01127XNEE,"Paul Dano is a fantastic actor, and I think Hollywood has started to realize that over the past few years. If I remember correctly, the first thing I ever saw him in was a small little movie called Ruby Sparks. I had never seen this guy before, but I thought he was pretty incredible. And from that day on, I made it my mission to see almost everything hes ever been in. Of course, a few of them have slipped through the cracks, but Ive seen the good majority of his on-screen work. Some of my personal favorites include the aforementioned as well as his roles in The Extra Man and Meeks Cutoff. And his performance in Love & Mercy is no different, I just wish there was more of it.

The film itself is split directly down the middle. As you may know, its the story of Brian Wilson (otherwise known as the frontman for The Beach Boys). But its by no means chronologically told. We cut to and fro from Brians formative years as a musician to his later days when he seems to be manipulated by a greedy therapist out to swindle him. In his younger years, hes excellently played by Paul Dano, with John Cusack stepping in for the later part of his life. These are two different stories, and two different movies at that.

The one that I was constantly enjoying and couldn't get enough of was his early years of dealing with quick success, and trying to follow up on that with more genuine music that spoke to the listener. This struggle, the one that is parleyed with his confusion and fractured being that came about as he was much older, is far more interesting. John Cusack definitely tries his best along with Elizabeth Banks to capture that fractured state - and turns in a commendable performance along the way - but it simply cant measure up to the electricity that is seen when Dano emerges. The result is a somewhat underwhelming movie, one that most definitely wouldve been better if entirely focused on one part of his life. However, one thing is certainly made clear, Paul Dano is sensational.",1436659200,7,2001,4.46448087431694

I became a ""full"" fan somewhere around SMILEY SMILE..at the time had no idea the ""real"" version was shelved, well, whatever could be scooped up off the studio floor!

7316761,4,B01127XNEE,"""Love & Mercy"" (2014 release; 121 min.) is a bio-pic about the life of Brian Wilson, the legendary Beach Boys singer-songwriter. As the movie opens, we get a clever montage of old footage (painstakingly recreated) of the Beach Boys' early successes. After the opening credits, we skip to the 1980s where an older Brian Wilson (played by John Cusack) meets Melinda Ledbetter (played by Elizabeth Banks) at a Cadillac dealership. She has no idea who he is. We then skip back to the 1960s, where we see the younger Brian (played by Paul Dano), after a panic attack and no longer touring, and blown away by the recent Beatles album ""Revolver"", hatch what would eventually become the ""Pet Sounds"" album. At this point we are maybe 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: any bio-pic of a music legend is going to be a highly subjective interpretation (check the Bob Dylan bio-pic ""I'm Not There"" of a few years ago). In this case, director Bill Pohlad focuses on 2 specific periods of Wilson's life: the mid-60s as Wilson's mind slowly but surely gave in to ""the voices"", and the mid/late-80s, when Wilson was under the legal guardianship of Dr. Eugene Landy (played by Paul Giamatti). Of course I cannot vouch whether things really happened as they are portrayed in the movie, but the movie certainly does feel quite authentic. I had seen the trailer a number of times beforehand, and was worried that the performance of John Cusack, who looks nothing like the real-life Brian Wilson, simply wouldn't work, in particular since Paul Dano as the younger Brian Wilson is so unbelievably on point. I needn't have worried, as Cusack makes you believe. But the best performance in the movie may well be by Elizabeth Banks, whom we most recently say in ""Pitch Perfect 2"", both acting and directing. Here, she plays the loving girlfriend who decides that Landy needs to be stopped. Giamatti has a choice performance as Landy, about as unlikeable a character as you'll ever meet, but perhaps even worse is Wilson's dad Murray (played by Bill Camp), abusing/hitting Brian so badly and so often that Brian is 96% deaf on his right ear. There are quite a few tough and uncomfortable scenes in the movie that only reinforce the feeling that Pohlad didn't just want to do a ""love letter"" movie about Brian Wilson. The key moment for me was when Wilson is playing a piano riff to Mike Love over and over and over again, as he tells Love ""I have this song stuck in my head, but I can't get it out"", and it's becoming clearer and clearer that Wilson has become a prisoner of his own mind, and worse. (That piano riff would eventually become ""Good Vibrations"".) Bottom line: this is an outstanding bio-pic, and any music history buff will want to see this.

""Love & Mercy"" opened s number of weeks ago at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay, but just okay. I had been looking forward to this movie, and even though I had high expectations coming into this, they were met, and then some. One of the better music bio-pics I have seen in a long time. If you have a chance to check it out, be it in the theater, or eventually on Amazon Instant Video or DVD/Blu-ray, by all means do so. ""Love & Mercy"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1436400000,73,3396,4.602310231023102

7316781,3,B01127XNEE,"As amply pointed out in many reviews, this film is like two movies in one. In the first movie we get to see the young and talented Brian Wilson, portrayed very convincingly by Paul Dano. In my opinion  as a musician and collector of music related bio-pics  Dano is involved with some of the most convincing scenes of recreated music performances on film. I don't know if the studio scenes, and other performance scenes, were performed live on tape by real musicians, but it sure comes across that way. One of my pet peeves is to see music related movies with actors who obviously are not only not playing their instrument, but cant even fake it with the music. Anyway, I digress . . . the studio scenes were very authentic.

The second movie in this film is of Brian Wilson and his challenges with mental health. In no way should we demean those that suffer with these types of issues, but at the same time this would seem like a tricky subject to include in a film. From an entertainment standpoint, there should be a payoff for taking the viewer through this experience. To that end, John Cusack is a fine actor, but I didn't buy him in this role. Also a challenge to believe was character actor Paul Giamattis portrayal of the therapist. Very close to the release of this movie was Straight Out of Compton in which Giamatti had a major role. I remember thinking at the time that this guy must be making the bio-pic rounds, and my suspension of reality while watching this film was distracted.  Bottom-line, the pacing of this second movie seemed inconsistent and clich.

Brian Wilson fans will probably appreciate this film more than the casual viewer. With that said, its worth a view, if nothing else, for the music and Paul Danos portrayal. I felt the Love during the first half of this film, but needed some Mercy during the second half!",1516060800,,1844,4.5589123867069485

7316795,5,B01127XNEE,"An excellent movie with some top notch acting.  Brian Wilson is a modern day morality play of what happens when you have mental issues, mix in a lot street drugs, and a truly sick Psychiatrist and the film nails this.  I listened to the Beach Boys all through junior high and well into high school.  Most of my peers were in awe of the Beatles and everything British but I enjoyed listening to how Brian harmonized the voices, the instruments were almost an afterthought and even in his more progressive works the instruments were to accompany and enhance the voices.  Brian liked to deconstruct a composition and examine the parts, this technique is very much like Schubert's.  Pet Sounds was a flop in pop culture but it is one of the most progressive albums to come out of the 60's.  Just imagine what Wilson could have done if he had a Father like Mozart's who knew how to encourage genius rather than bully it.",1510185600,,915,4.548780487804878

Being such a talent and then getting controlled by substance .. then later all the hanger ons..  it was really interesting.  These were just goofy Southern California boys.. that could harmonize.. and one of them influenced the Beatles.. so.. its a good time.  John Cusack was soft and sweet as the older Brian Wilson.. Elizabeth Banks you really rooted for her as the hero that saved Brian.. and the always fun to watch Paul Giamattie was great fun.

He lost many years and memories, and he never fully recover.  I has hesitated to watch it because of the content.  It was not a pretty picture, though Brian has said in interviews that it's quite accurate.  His current wife was responsible for pulling him out of a dark life and helping get the help he needed.

Ive know brian wilson to have mental disorders, lets face the facts the movie doesn't wanna touch on. He was a heavy lsd user and it fried his brain. Couple that with his father being a abuser, his cousin mike always fighting him with the music and there's a recipe for disaster. Im really surprised wilson made it past the early 70s. The movie itself just keeps jumping back and forth. Doesn't explain a whole lot and there are some wide gaps that will have you scratching your head asking did I miss something. At least they could of gotton the actor to look like wilson.  Oh well at least I've seen it and it is getting stuffed in my video collection",1501459200,,741,4.369565217391305
7316815,5,B01127XNEE,"Bob Dylan on Brian Wilson: ""That ear  I mean, Jesus, he's got to will that to the Smithsonian."" (Newsweek, 1997)

Bill Pohlad's ""Love & Mercy"" is a loving cinematic poem to Brian Wilson, leader of the legendary Beach Boys. Breaking free of the conventional tropes that hamstring most biopics about popular artists; ""Love & Mercy"" shows us his creative process and takes us on a trip through Wilsons cerebral hemispheres.

""Music is God's voice"", Brian Wilson once said. And the sounds in this film are indeed heavenly. If you're a devotee of Brian Wilson and his music and know the backstory, ""Love & Mercy"" is something of a religious experience. I cannot imagine a better tribute to such an important artist. The film is so exquisitely crafted that any small blemish or wrong note gets lost in the whole texture.

Paul Dano and John Cusack give tour de force performances as 'Brian Past' (1960s) and 'Brian Future' (1980s), respectively. Dano, particularly, embodies his portrayal of the younger Wilson in a way that is all-consuming. Cusack presents the older Wilson as a man who has been through some deep valleys. Both performances harmonize to create a unique portrait.

The film deftly juxtaposes both periods in Brian Wilson's life hinting at the harrowing missing years, in between. Oren Moverman's screenplay is finely crafted so that the story balances 'Brian Past' as he is fracturing just as 'Brian Future' is putting it all back together again. Director Pohlad's recreation of the ""Pet Sounds"" and ""SMiLE"" sessions is some of the most magical cinema I have maybe seen, specifically in the biopic genre.

The supporting performances are strong, as well; featuring Elizabeth Banks as Brian's future wife Melinda and Paul Giamatti as the Svengali-like psychotherapist Dr. Euguene Landy. Melinda slowly realizes the man she meets in the films opening scene, while selling him a Cadillac, is a damaged soul. But she is drawn into his world, presumably because of his tenderness and honesty. She also acts as the audiences conduit into the story of 'Brian Future', allowing us to view that portion of the story through the eyes of an active bystander.

Also of note is the enveloping photography of DP Robert Yeoman. His camera covers the 1965/66 ""Pet Sounds"" sessions in a documentary-like fashion. We feel as though we are eavesdropping on the creative process at work. Contrast that with the cool pastel hues of the 1980s sequences and it's clear to see why director Bill Pohlad chose this particular cinematographer. Yeoman brings the same care and sensibility shown in the films he has shot for Wes Anderson to ""Love & Mercy"".

Whether being domineered by his father Murry, his cousin Mike Love or later Dr. Landy, Brian Wilson has always been people-pleaser as his mother Audree once said. In both the film and in real life, its comforting to know that the man that gave us all some of the best popular music in the second half of the 20th century while never fully being content, now feels the mercy and the love.

This is an exceptional film.

PRODUCTION NOTES 

The production of LOVE & MERCY actually has a fairly long and interesting road. As early as 1988 a biopic about Brian Wilson was in the works. That of course is the same year that Brian released his eponymous solo debut. It also coincides, at least partially, with the era depicted in Brian Future scenes in the released film.

In 1988, a deal was nearly inked that would have seen William Hurt playing Brian Wilson and Richard Dreyfuss playing Dr. Eugene Landy. This film was to have also been titled Love & Mercy and would have focused on the therapeutic relationship between Wilson and Landy. There were other attempts to bring Brians story to the big screen including a project in the late 90s that was to have Jeff Bridges playing Wilson.

Beginning in or around 2007 at the now defunct Warner Independent Pictures a script began being prepped reportedly titled Heroes and Villains. According to Love & Mercy director Bill Pohlad, sometime around 2010 the production team of Claire Rudnick Polstein and John Wells approached him to help the project come to fruition. Pohlad states that at the time he passed but left the door open saying if you cant make it happen with what youve got, come back and well approach it differently. Pohlad has been quoted as saying that the Heroes and Villains script was lacking.

Ultimately, thats exactly what happened. Polstein and Wells again approached Pohlad to direct and write a film about Brian Wilson. Pohlad has stated he was at first hesitant to direct another film since his first foray in the directors chair wasn't as satisfactory as he would have liked. Pohlad had the inspired choice of asking screenwriter Oren Moverman (Im Not There and Rampart) to take a swing at penning a Wilson biopic. Michael A. Lerner, who penned the ""Heroes and Villains"" screenplay, received a screenwriting credit for ""Love & Mercy"".

Initially, there were to be three eras featured in Love & Mercy: the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. An interesting tidbit is that at one stage when the ""1970s Brian was being developed, Philip Seymour Hoffman was discussed as a possible actor to fill that role. Perhaps wisely, the filmmakers chose to go a different direction. And, as the project moved into pre-production, it reportedly became evident that there was a need to focus the story more on the 1960s (Pet Sounds Sessions, particularly) and 1980s (with Landy). The finished product relegates the ""1970s Brian"" to two independent shots of a morbidly obese Wilson (played by an un-credited actor) in bed during that harrowing decade.

Director Pohlad has mentioned in several interviews that the choice of Paul Dano was almost immediate. He had him in mind from the early stages of the project to play the younger Brian Wilson. The choice of John Cusack came a bit later on, as Pohlad mentions several times in print that he was inspired to seek Cusack out after re-watching the Don Was documentary about Brian Wilson I Just Wasnt Made for These Times from 1995.

Though the trend in Hollywood for the last ten years or so has been to shoot movies digitally, both Bill Pohlad and Robert Yeoman wisely chose to shoot ""Love & Mercy"" on 35mm film; even going so far to use 16mm and Super8 to capture some of the moments shown in the films' opening credit sequence. The overall look and authenticity of the finished product is a direct result of those inspired production flourishes.

According to screenwriter Oren Moverman, the finished film originally ran as long as 2 hours and 20 minutes and was trimmed to slightly over 2 hours prior to the debut at the Toronto International Film Festivall (TIFF) in September 2014. Additional edits were made prior to the theatrical release on June 5th, 2015.

Four of the scenes that were excised from Love & Mercy can be found on the DVD and Blu-ray as well as the digital version available for purchase from numerous outlets. Also included is an excellent audio commentary featuring director Bill Pohlad and screenwriter Oren Moverman production insights.

The films soundtrack with its aural soundscapes, produced by Atticus Ross, was eventually released after a slight delay on September 18th, 2015.

7316816,5,B01127XNEE,An interesting well done movie that explains a lot of Wilsons behavior. It's a wonder he's still around and that he was and still is as productive as he's been considering what he went through.,1501027200,,193,4.542857142857143

7316818,5,B01127XNEE,"Based upon the few things I have read about the Beach Boys, this movie appears to hold to the general facts of their history and does not Hollywood things up too much.  It is possible that the doctor/psychologist is overdone; but that may be accurate.

It is hard to buy John Cusack as Brian Wilson, but the material is good enough to put that aside.  The first guy who plays Brian physically looks reasonably close to Brian.  The other Beach Boys, not so much.

Nevertheless, this is a highly engaging and enjoyable movie; particularly for Beach Boy fans; and also, for those who are aware of the Beach Boys, but never really appreciated who they are and what they background is.  Brian Wilson is one of the most interesting composers of the 20th century; and much of this helps us to understand why.

This is one of the few movies where I would have been happy to see another hour on the creative process that Brian engaged in.",1499299200,,929,4.494047619047619

So, if we disagree already, you can stop reading or put some nasty comment now. I am, on the other hand, interested in music and recognize that some people love Pets Sounds or the Beach Boys in general. I'm also own up to the guilty pleasure of rock and roll films. ""Love and Mercy"" certainly falls into that category. That said, this is, despite the fact that I'm supposed to feel good for Brian when he breaks away from his shrink from hell, this is one of the most depressing rock and roll films ever. Half way through I was wishing for Brian Jones at the bottom of the pool or Sid and Nancy strung out. By the end of the film, it didn't matter that when I get into the mood I can listen to ""Good Vibrations"" ten times in a row, all I wanted for Brian Wilson to stop hearing the voices in his head.

Loved hearing some of their music which I grew up with (being born mid-50's). Hadn't really heard much of the inside story and so glad it turned out the way it did. Enjoyed it a lot.

7316843,2,B01127XNEE,"The core problem with this movie is that someone unfamiliar with Brian Wilson's story would have a lot of trouble understanding what is going on and those who are familiar with it will see the inaccuracies. One of the big ones is showing Wilson taking LSD for the first time long after the actual time that it happened. This is significant because Wilson's use of drugs was both partly responsible for leading him to create the complex music that poured out of him and simultaneously a big factor in his mental breakdown. He was already a troubled person and musically gifted, but that was a significant turning point. The film is trying in part to look at the relationship between Wilson's gift and his mental illness, which is one of the most interesting things about an unusual person, but it botches the attempt. Like many, I think John Cusack was really miscast. Not only does he not look anything like Brian Wilson but I don't think he even comes close to nailing the character of someone I've seen performing and talking so many times. I did like the narrative structure of showing the older Wilson and flashing back to how he got there, and especially liked the moment the writer chose to open on, where he meets his future wife.

This movie does show more detail of how fragile he had become and the abuse he experienced by the hands of vultures in his life.  I am a big fan of John Cusack, but I don't think he was the right actor to portray Wilson. I think he did capture his state of mind and his vulnerability, but I could not get past the visual differences.  Of course, that is not Cusack's fault, it just is what it is. The movie is worth watching, but I personally don't rank it that high.",1485734400,,575,4.070796460176991

7316941,4,B01127XNEE,"THIS REVIEW MIGHT GIVE AWAY TOO MUCH (IF YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT BEFORE YOU SEE A MOVIE)

This is both a powerful movie and an annoying one.  Annoying first:  You really have to know something about Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys to follow it very closely.  And even if you do, other than Melinda and Dr Landy,  it's easy to get lost in who is who, and how Brian feels about them or relates to them.  Sometimes no one is referred to by name, even his brothers, Carl and Dennis.  I only identified Mike Love by his hats.  And forget Al Jardine.  I had to go look him up on the internet.  Brian's first wife, Marilyn, is in several key scenes - a couple very strong and revealing ones - but I had to just hope that's who she was.  No introduction, no courting, no romance or personal interaction  (which Brian recounts in WOULDN'T IT BE NICE and DON'T WORRY BABY, for example, but we don't get to see it).  There is really only one scene with the father that moved me - where Brian plays GOD ONLY KNOWS for him, seeking approval.  That's what is missing with the rest of the people in his life.  We never see how he feels about them.  Even when Mike Love takes him to task for leaving the others out of the PET SOUNDS creation, Brian just stares in dumbfounded confusion rather than reveal anything about how he feels about the situation, or his reasons for doing what he did.  We have to guess too much.  It's like the long, lingering scenes of the young Brian on drugs, or spacing out while apparently not being able to deal with anything going on around him. Yes, a couple of those scenes do prepare you for the older Brian (deftly and expertly played by John Cusack) and his troubles, but a little goes a long way.

Now, the powerful:  What is good is very good.  We get a complete sense of how Brian relates to Melinda, so we can anticipate what's coming and enjoy their scenes together and the direction of their relationship even if we don't know what happened in real life.  Same with Dr Landy.  Paul Giametti is such an accomplished actor, he just fills up the screen with this guy's self-important belligerance.  And the scenes are written beautifully to show who he is and how Brian reacts to his behavior - just as the scenes with the father prepare us to understand exactly why Brian would succumb to  repugnant character like Landy.

My favorite sequence in the whole movie is the studio sessions for PET SOUNDS because you get to see Brian at work, bringing out little by little all the sounds, the music, the feelings, the elements he needs to construct the finished record.  The way he encourages and guides the studio musicians, asks for weird and unexpected sound effects, demands perfection of pitch, tonality, rhythm, and harmony, is just captivating.

The ending is very strong, very uplifting, and very cathartic.  The final scenes of Brian singing LOVE AND MERCY over the closing credits show all the wear and tear and emotional damage in his face, with the stirring message of joy and redemption in the song as counterpoint.  It's very moving, and shows that even the most battered and beleaguered of souls can find solace and happiness if they don't quit trying.",1485734400,,3184,4.506108202443281

7316944,4,B01127XNEE,"Great biography.  Would have liked to have seen the young Brian with his collaborators. He wasn't just this lone genius as portrayed in the movie, giving in to the movies brevity, I will let it pass.  Also, John Cusack as the older Brian:  I love John Cusack, and he did do a fine job, but visually there had to be a better pick out there.  Highly recommend this movie, nonetheless.",1485648000,,382,4.414285714285715

At first glance: if you unaware of Brian Wilson's life story and you're looking for a shiny, happy movie about the Beach Boys that tells all about their idyllic lives in the California sun and surf, LOOK ELSEWHERE -- unless, of course, you are prepared for a shock.

Paging through the hundreds of reviews of this film, I see that it generated some real controversy, and even more surprisingly, a great many people who considered themselves Beach Boys fans had no idea at all of any of the pain behind their favorite music.

The interesting thing is the gamut of reaction: from boredom to anger to confusion to amazement. The other interesting thing is how many people had a difficult time understanding the time skips, which to my mind are quite clear: we have the older Brian of the 1980s, with little to no music, one kind of aesthetic (clothes, cars, interior furnishings, etc.), the film is more muted, and it is telling one story; and then we have the much younger Brian of the 1960s, with another completely different aesthetic, highly saturated colors in the film (which is absolutely gorgeous, by the way), and music everywhere, flowing throughout. And it tells another story.

But while the two stories may seem disconnected, a person really needs to hang with the film to try to figure out what's going on. Because the stories are not disconnected at all. They tell the same story, the real-life story of a man with what is now understood to be schizoaffective disorder, and how he had been in one of the top musical acts in the world when this disorder all came crashing down on him. Before that happened, though, he gave the world an incredible gift in the form of the Beach Boys' classic 1966 album ""Pet Sounds"".

The 1980s scenes chronicle his blossoming romance with Melinda Ledbetter, who he met while shopping for a car at a Cadillac dealership. In a story that goes in the ""too incredible to be true"" category, the Brian of this era was under the legal guardianship of a sleaze psychiatrist/therapist, Dr. Eugene ""Gene"" Landy, who, it was later revealed, was actually out to take it all from Brian -- fame, money, songwriting co-credits, production credits. Even pushing his way into Brian's will.

With the exception of a couple of scenes (such as the one featuring Brian and Melinda in the restaurant) the film doesn't present all of this in an expository manner. This is good, IMO, because if it did, it would get bogged down like a soap opera and wind up being little better than 1970's-era TV-movie fodder. Instead, it tries as much as possible to unfold as Brian may have experienced it. It is up to you, the viewer, to make sense of it; and ultimately, to pass judgment.

The film has its flaws, of course. For me, the biggest is that maybe they're a little too harsh on Mike Love, who already has the rap as one of rock music's biggest a-holes. His portrayal is a bit too over the top here.

Summary: excellent art film, worthy of Brian and his legacy.",1484265600,,2997,4.643396226415095

Even the Beatles envied him.  Pet Sounds was a masterpiece.  The movie deals mostly with his inner demons.  Well made film.  The only problem I had was casting Cusak as Brian.  No resemblance at all.  Like I hated Cuba Gooding portraying OJ Simpson.  I think that when acting a part the actor should at least, with makeup, vaguely resemble the person he is playing.

I think it could have been better if it were more engaging . . . perhaps gave a bit more context to the story, for those who don't know the story of Brian or the Beach Boys for that matter.  Without some context or more background information, I find it difficult to imagine that anyone from post Beach Boy era would stay engaged with this movie.  The movie seemed to go on the assumption that everyone knows the story of the Beach Boys.  It would have also been more engaging with more context to the flashbacks in time.

7317118,4,B01127XNEE,"For someone who was around when The Beach Boys were really popular, this was a very enjoyable movie. All BB fans have heard how Brian Wilson was troubled, abused by his father, a recluse, unstable, a heavy drug user, a genius, etc., but this movie does an excellent job of painting the full picture. Brian Wilson is often described as a genius; he showed at a very young age that he had tremendous talent as a song writer, singer and producer. Some of the most interesting scenes occurred in the recording studio where Brian labored to get musicians to play the music he was ""hearing in his head"". Another interesting part of the film covered the relationship between Brian and his psychotherapist, Dr. Landy. It was obvious that Landy was abusive, overly controlling, over-medicating and just generally a really harmful influence on Brian. The acting by the actor portraying the young Brian was outstanding; John Cusack as the older Brian did his typical excellent job with his understated acting style. Elizabeth Banks, although not a very good actress, did a passable job of portraying the concerned woman who goes from having no idea who Brian Wilson is, to rescuing him from Dr. Landy and becoming Brian's love interest.

Sad that we lost Carl and Dennis, but amazing that Brian survived his difficult journey. The studio scenes appear to be accurate and enlightening. My favorite Brian story is from the book that came with the Pet Sounds CD. He brings in studio player Billy Strange (after having a 12 string Fender and amp delivered to the studio on a Sunday) has him do one pass on Sloop John B...says ""that's it""  pays him 500 bucks cash and says ""don't forget your guitar and amp"",,,Think too much is made about Pet Sounds?

There is no character development of their father. He is simply dropped in as a rejected ogre and then he sells them out. Literally. How was the psychologist able to gain complete control of Brian's life? The story doesn't say. It ends with Brian back on the circuit and composing again. Sort of. Is it just the one song?

7317257,4,B01127XNEE,"Excellent biopic. Paul Dano's portrayal of the ""Past"" Wilson rightfully garnered him numerous awards and nominations for Best Actor. He beautifully portrayed Wilson's inner demons, exacerbated by his domineering father's aloofness and outright disdain for anything change Brian wanted for the Boys' sound. Having recently seen and read ""The Wrecking Crew"", I especially enjoyed getting an inside glimpse of the brilliant contributions made by Hal Blaine, Carol Kaye, Tommy Tedesco, Glen Campbell, and numerous other other ""unsung heroes"" to their studio recording sessions. Really felt like a fly on the wall during one of music's most creative periods. I at first thought John Cusack was not a good choice (at least in physical appearance) to portray the ""Future"" Wilson's life, but he, too, did an excellent job, exposing the gifted genius' struggles with his inner demons as well as with his new tormenter, Eugene Landy (slightly overplayed by Paul Giamatti). All-in-all, a job well done.

7317297,5,B01127XNEE,"Love and Mercy
 I grew up in Southern California, lived walking distance from the beach and listened to a radio station in High School that, when the Beatles were number one every where in the world, KFWB scored the Beach Boys as number one.  For about three years the Beach Boys held their title-but only on our station.  So I wanted to see this movie.  I wanted to celebrate the music.
 Love and Mercy turns out to be about a crazy guy and people who abused him.  The film depicts parts of the life of Brian Wilson, the creative genius behind the Beach Boys, his severe mental problems and the shameful, horrible Dr. Eugene Landy who misused his professional power as a mental health practitioner to control and suck cash from Wilson in the guise of treating him.  It is a very well done film about a terrible but true story.
 Bill Pohlad is famous in Hollywood as a producer.  He has an Oscar nomination for his Tree of Life, which he produced.  His direction of Love and Mercy is so sure handed and subtle that we might think he has directed dozens of films instead of only a single small film years ago besides Love and Mercy.  He manages the difficult chore of showing on film the workings of the mind of a deranged person, and with care and sympathy while he is at it.
 The script comes from Oren Moverman (who also penned the innovative biopic of Bob Dylan 'I'm Not There') and Michael A. Lerner.  They of coursed based the script closely on the real life of Brian Wilson.
 The non-linear script has Paul Dano playing a younger Brian Wilson in his productive years, just as he began his spiral into mental illness.  John Cusack plays Wilson some years later when he suffered in the clutches of the evil Dr. Landy.  Paul Giamatti plays the evil doctor so well that we grow to hate him, which means a good acting job for him.  Elizabeth Banks plays Malinda, who became Wilson's second and current wife with whom he has five children.
 Paul Dano I think is an acting genius.  There are scenes where he shows Wilson's creative process in the sound studio that genuinely exibit that side of Wilson's personality.  He seems to literally have sounds in his head that he wants to put on tape-if only he can.  We have some understanding of Wilson's struggle to get the sounds out of his head and onto tape.  Music lovers can be glad that he did.  Wilson crated some of the most memorable and delightful songs of an era known for spectacular creative innovation.
  This isn't a simple biography nor is it a band film showing off the talent of a monumental band.  It is a gut twisting tale of mental illness, talent and betrayal.  It's true too.

Elizabeth Banks (from the realtor.com commercials) was simply terrific!  What a real time story.  One of the most astounding things was the end of film credits where they listed out all the music. PAGES and PAGES of Brian Wilson songs.  Wow, I had no idea.... I am amazed that Brian Wilson was able to be as prolific as he is considering what he went through to keep going!",1477785600,,519,4.212121212121212

Paul Dano I know ive seen before but this is a breakout for him.  Paul Giamatti as always top notch.  These three should be nominated in all awards. Elizabeth Banks, talk about a stand by your man performance, wow.  The title threw me but thankfully read the description that picqued my interest for it.

Reading the credits at the end makes me believe he approved or had a hand in the movie, so I am going to think most of it was true. Two actors play Wilson, at two points in his life, and it works.

7317417,5,B01127XNEE,"A powerful biopic the likes of which are seldom encountered. The acting by the principal players is extremely good. Paul Giamatti stands out as the evil psychologist; John Cusack as the older Brian Wilson (he looks very little like him) and Elizabeth Banks as his girlfriend also do outstanding jobs. I never considered Paul Dano to be a good actor (he typically gets away with it by hiding behind an expressionless face), and in this movie he reached the limit of his capabilities. I can think of many others who could have acted better. But by gaining weight he did end up looking a lot like the young Brian. At any rate, the film so strong, the storyline so absorbing, that it still deserves a 5-star rating.",1476057600,,711,4.606299212598425

All I know, from my perspective, is that any time I had a difficulty in life I just play 'Good Vibrations' and I feel better. I feel I can overcome any problems or let them go; don't sweat the small stuff or know my own limitations.  Watching this movie made me appreciate the genius behind 'Good Vibrations' and I, may be biased because I like John Cusack, so in this movie I was very interested to see his acting.  He is one of a kind as an actor as this may have been a difficult role to play.  Please check it out and I hope you share a similar opinion.

7317460,5,B01127XNEE,We've had opportunity to meet Brian Wilson several times because a friend of ours worked with him for many years.  This movie showed the torrid genius this man was.  He still has an amazing ear and knows exactly what he wants to hear in each song he has written.  I loved the scenes where he was in the studio and how he knew in his head what he wanted for that eerie sound in Good Vibrations that became a huge hit.  This movie is also a throwback to the 60's and we love the Beach Boys.  Their music is so happy and fun and always lifts our spirits.  Jon Cusack's portrayal of Brian Wilson is masterful.  He captures the sweetness and the genius.  You get an interesting look into this musician's mind.  You can also see why he drove other people crazy with his obsessive behavior.,1475452800,,783,4.308219178082192

A must see for anybody curious about the history of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys.  If you like music and enjoyed the Andre 3000 / Jimi Hendrix biopic, this one will blow that out of the water.  As far as musical biopic is concerned, I think Jamie Foxx in ""Ray"" and Joaquin Phoenix in ""Walk the Line"" are 1(a) and 1(b), but with little expectation, ""Love & Mercy"" was quite the surprise.",1475107200,,575,4.617647058823529

7317526,5,B01127XNEE,"This movie very easily could have become muddled by the many controversies/tragedies surrounding Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys, yet it maintained a very narrow and purposeful view. The use of flashbacks between the mid-60s (Brian Wilson played by Paul Dano),prior to and during the making of Pet Sounds, and the 80 (Brina Wilson played by John Cusack), during some of his darkest times under the ""care of"" Dr. Landy. Paul Giamatti was shockingly disturbing and altogether convincing in his role as Dr. Landy. The film treats Brian Wilson's mental health issues, from their onset and, later, in the 80s after he had been suffering severely for a great length of time, with a great deal of care and consideration- meaning, care was taken not discuss the nuances of how Brian Wilson had/has experienced his mental illness, and not simply turn it in to a ""drugs are bad"" finger pointer. I highly recommend this movie for lovers of music history, in general.",1474848000,,955,4.901234567901234

7317528,4,B01127XNEE,"A fascinating study of the life of Beach Boys' genius songwriter Brian Wilson...and of the psychological and familial demons he battled throughout his adulthood.  Great performances by the cast, especially Paul Giamatti as Dr. Eugene Landy, Wilson's evil psychiatrist/guardian., and Paul Dano and John Cusack, who played the young and middle-aged Brian, respectively.  Elizabeth Banks is surprisingly good, too, as the love of his life.
If this movie consisted of nothing but the Beach Boys' catalog--especially from Wilson's master work, ""Pet Sounds""--it would be worth  3 stars alone.  Make sure to watch through the credits for a moving concert performance by the REAL Brian Wilson, circa 2005.",1474848000,,697,5.485981308411215

It's the best I've seen him. Mr. Cusack is not as spot-on as Brian Wilson as Dano, but his performance is beautiful, nuanced, and flawless. You forget he doesn't look quite like Wilson and fall into the performance. Supporting characters were also great. There was no weak link. For me, the pleasant surprise was Jake Abel who played Mike Love perfectly.

This is a film that under other circumstances could feel boring or preachy or soul-sucking. But, because of the enjoyable music and because there is a familiarity with the people involved, and they are people you might have a fondness for, the movie really works.",1474761600,,795,4.932835820895522

I understand they wanted to show the PROCESS of creating the music, in Brian's mind, but also in the studio, and that was interesting. But I wish (and my wife did too) they had brought the parts together more throughout the movie so that we could hear the end result, the song with all the pieces in place. I felt that often we'd be brought through the process, hearing the creation and fine-tuning of all the pieces, but never hear much, if any, of the final version of the process. I wouldn't expect every song to be performed entirely, but it would have been good to hear more of them than we did. It seemed you pretty much had to wait for the credits to hear the songs.

IT became a bit frustrating when the movie kept going back and forth,  The best part was the music and how Brian got some of his inspiration for composing his particular songs and his innovations in  recording.

When drama moves us, as it is classically supposed to, to pity and catharsis, then it necessarily is successful; this movie does just that thanks to direction and acting.

Instead of Landy being a lone villain, the film exposes the dark underbelly of the pseudo science known as psychotherapy. Banks is an angel in royal blue as the more effective therapist using the skills of love and mercy. Giamattis on point arrogance as well as the fact that Landy was allowed to continue to practice is the cautionary tale of that time.

Cons: Not enough about the music (and not enough historical performance and/or recording footage) and too much about ""old"" Brian Wilson's angst. Editing was at times very poor - too much time spent slowly panning in on Cusack in angst as the ""old"" Brian Wilson. Should have had an epilogue.",1473465600,,513,4.908045977011494

Paul Giamatti as the insane psychiatrist is impossible to look away from and brings to light the terrifying if oddly charismatic control freak who held Brian in his thrall for years.

7317807,4,B01127XNEE,"With Brian Wilson leading such an eventful life (!) it would been probably harder to make a bad film.  Love & Mercy is helped considerable by the fact that permission for the use of The Beach Boys music has been given (when you watch films about The Beatles, Stones or Hendrix, a bit of credibility is always lost when they just perform covers).
Cusack & Dano capture Brian Wilson perfectly, although I don't see the need for constantly jumping forward & backward in time, perhaps because Brain is such an unorthodox character the scrip-writers felt the structure of the film had to be the same.
You could suggest that the charters of Mike Love, Brians father & Doctor Landy are a bit two-dimensional, if it weren't for the fact that its all true.
The highlight for the film is the live recording of Pet sounds, recreating some of the music from the Pet sounds sessions boxset, if the movie had consisted of just that I would have been happy.
There are a couple of historical inaccuracies; Brian first took LSD before writing California Girls, or the piano sandpit didn't appear until the end of the Sixties, but there used to help the narrative of the film & don't spoil it.
DVD extras, there are four deleted scenes, Brian running into Phil Spector, Brain talking to his family about stopping touring, Brain meeting Tony Asher, Brian father bursts into the recording studio.
So I think this is a good a film as your going to get, considering what a complex person Brian Wilson is, it would be interesting if a film was made about the life of Mike Love (he is portrait as the constant nay-sayer to Brain experiments), but anyway a fascinating movie.",1472947200,,1650,4.631399317406143
7317808,5,B01127XNEE,I loved this movie! Brian Wilson is a genius and has a voice of an angel! What he went through is sad and tragic. He has come a long way. I hope he has reconciled with his daughters Carney and Wendy. I love them too!,1472860800,,216,3.8222222222222224

7317830,4,B01127XNEE,A well done biopic. Love Cusack. It was surprising to see him play this vague manchild role. He did a great job as did the man who played Brian when he was younger. Elizabteth Banks did a great job of playing the girlfriend. This was a movie that pulled us in and kept our attention.,1472774400,,283,4.163636363636364

7317850,2,B01127XNEE,A disappointment. Seemed to be more about the director trying to prove his cleverness (moving back and forth in time) than about Brian Wilson's talent and experiences.  John Cusack as adult Brian mostly speaks slowly and has a flat affect to indicate his angst. Not very effective especially when he does not resemble Brian Wilson at all.  Strange casting.  The actor who plays young Brian is a better choice.  The scenes where young Brian is working with his musicians are great.  Elizabeth Banks as Brian's current wife and savior is good as is Paul Giamatti as Brian's nutball doctor. I like and respect Brian Wilson so I'm sorry he didn't get a great film about his life.,1472774400,,675,4.735042735042735
7317851,4,B01127XNEE,"A very sad but informative film about the personal evolution of Beach Boy's Brian Wilson. The production and acting were well done. The story is horrifying both in showing the struggle of mental illness, and showing how vulnerable people can be totally taken advantage of. My only beef with the movie is superficial. Throughout the movie when they're showing the much younger Brian, he has brown hair. When they show the older Brian he has very dark hair. Couldn't they get Cusack to dye his hair? I saw a contemporary music clip of Brian, and his hair is still that brown. Who knows. Reminded me of the actor's wrong hair color in that recent Steve Jobs movie. Directors: I don't get that.",1472774400,,690,4.663934426229508

Although John Cusack doesn't resemble the older Brian Wilson nearly as well as Paul Dano does the younger one, Cusack's and Dano's performances are spot-on. Also Paul Giamatti is positively despicable as Eugene Landy. The story drags a bit at times, but ultimately delivers. Well worth a look.",1472515200,,466,4.8375
7317868,3,B01127XNEE,"I guess I expected more from the plot.  I wondered why they had two adult versions of Brian Wilson, as John Cusack (what a great actor) looked nothing like the other guy.  I guess if you were wanting to know about mental illness, it would have met your expectation okay, but guess I was hoping to hear more of the Beach Boys music throughout.",1472515200,,342,4.328125

At first I wasn't sure I liked John Cusack in the role of Wilson as an adult, but as the film progressed, so did his portrayal. Paul Giametti was great as a really despicable, manipulative character.

7317895,4,B01127XNEE,"I found the movie to be a great explanation of what a magnificent talent Brian Wilson was. As a Beach Boys fan in the 60's, I never knew he was afflicted so. I was an early fan of Pet Sounds, never knowing there was conflict in the band. Both actors who portrayed Brian Wilson were superior, though I had no idea in the beginning what was going on. I kept with it and soon became aware that they were each Brian Wilson but in different decades. What Brian Wilson had to endure was shameful, but there was a happy ending. It was astonishing to see how Brian worked with the studio musicians to get the music for Pet Sounds on tape before the rest of the band returned from touring. That was, to me, the most important part of the movie. Anyone interested in the Beach Boys history will want to see this film, as it sort of explains how Brian Wilson is able to tour today.",1472342400,,870,4.2155688622754495

7317943,3,B01127XNEE,"Decent movie about Brian Wilson.  John Cusack was excellent as the older Brian, giving a moving and understated performance.  Paul Dano was pretty terrible as the young Brian, doing essentially a clown caricature.  Dano has the ability to drag down anything he is in. The movie, by its nature, is somewhat disjointed, as the director chose to present two distinct parts of Wilson's life. It drags a bit and could have been a little shorter.  Also, Paul Giamatti, a great actor most of the time, seemed miscast as the villainous shrink.  Worth watching.",1471737600,,552,4.89247311827957

It is a good, very good movie. My wife is a music person. I am a creative person with a tendency to lateral thinking. This movie shows how these things work together in the life of one man. Genius, suffering, and art coming together and trying to find a way through. Oh, and there is massive drug use in there as well.

In my opinion John Cussack portrayed the tormented man who was eventually rescued from Hell.  The early days was very well done.  Watching this film brought me back to the work of the Beach Boys beyond the ""surf"" genre and to the amazing sounds Brian Wilson moved them to. I am at a loss of words for my ignorance of his struggle to create.  I had bought into his spiral down and thought he was a loss.  Turns out he had a caretaker who was brutal.

Wilson though had music running through his brain.  It made him want to create something more than just Fun, Fun, Fun till daddy takes her t'bird away stuff.  During a time when Wilson's group and The Beatles and the Rolling Stones and The Moody Blues were making one album after the other it became a kind of competition between them. Then Wilson managed to write and organize some musicians to play on Pet Sounds.  In fact this album influenced The Beatles to write and make Sergeant Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.
I would like to have had more Wilson solo music and also more Beach Boys music in the movie but it worked for me the way it was.

The latter day sequences with Cusack, who is a great actor, but nobody's idea of Brian Wilson, playing an opaque character impossible to understand, were boring and off-putting. This structure relegates Brian's troubles, his very identity, to the status of a mystery plot. Movies don't work like this. We are shown a character, we learn to identify and empathize, then we follow their journey so that we can understand them. It's disrespectful and cheap to turn somone's mental state into a kind of ""whodunit"", a casual logic puzzle for a movie viewer.

In this case I gather a lot of people are Beach Boys fans and regardless of storytelling quality enjoy this feel because it focuses on Brian Wilson. But don't let those people fool you, this movie stinks. It's like watching a really long, really lame, really melodramatic VH1 behind-the-music special replete with pool party, drugs out of control, rocky love relationship, and contemplative staring at walls before writing a piece of music scenes. To top it all off the film fails miserably in aping 2001: A Space Odyssey by getting all ""deep"" and ""far-out"" and ""spiritual"". But again, this fails. There's nothing worse than a pretentious film that thinks it's saying something when it isn't.

I basically knew the story of Brian Wilson and his personal issues but did not realize the depth of some of his problems until I saw this film, nor how much he was controlled by his attending doctor.  The way the movie was made was interesting with John Cusack playing the ""post breakdown"" Wilson and a different actor used for the earlier scenes and the shifting back and forth.  I wish there had been a little more focus on the relationships between Brian and the rest of the group as a majority of the movie deals with the control of Wilson by the doctor treating his mental disorders.

7318292,4,B01127XNEE,"I can't really abide John Cusak in anything, but I was really interested in getting a better understanding of this Brian Wilson character. Paul Dano rocks it pretty hard in this movie as the Young Brian Wilson. I realize the parts with Cusak were supposed to portray another critical period in Wilson's life but you could have cut them out and I think it would have been a better film. They are all rather dry and really nothing much of anything goes on. Again, I realize this is an important part of Wilson's ""story,"" but it is marked by what the movie portrays as a very inactive time in his life, during which he was likely heavily sedated by over-medication. If that is indeed true, then I suppose Cusak's affected portrayal is spot-on, but it does not make for an interesting movie experience.
The four stars are really all attributed to the Young Brian Wilson plot points. Also, this film opened my eyes and ears to Pet Sounds, and I should probably give it 5-stars just on the weight of that.  This album is really special, and I have this rather mediocre film to thank for introducing me to it.",1469664000,,1102,4.51

It is so sad when someone has mental health issues and their family and doctors take advantage of them.  I wanted to throttle his father and the doc.

The kid who played young Brian Wilson could, with a little makeup have easily, and more convincingly played the ""old"" BW.  Cusack was distracting. The ""kid"" was superb!

7318629,4,B01127XNEE,"This is a good movie, but it takes some work to enjoy it.  The story of Brian Wilson's genius, descent into mental illness, abuse by a charlatan, and redemption through love is known, but the movie ends up filling in some blanks and ultimately proves satisfying.  That said, there's some weirdness and confusion in the casting, plotting, and organization of the film that gets in the way.  I gave up halfway through it, but decided to go back and finish the film.  I am glad i did.  Paul Dano is outstanding as the younger Wilson and John Cusack pretty good as the older.  I generally love everything Paul Giamatti does, but he is just OK in this film.  His portrayal of the evil psychologist who takes control of Wilson comes off as a caricature, probably through editing I would guess.",1468972800,,787,4.578571428571428

Great job by the actors Paul Dano and John Cusack portraying Brian Wilson as the young MUSICAL GENUS that he is and the older mentally troubled version. Love Elizabeth Banks as Melinda, Paul Giamatti does a great job as Dr. Eugene Landy and even as I write this I am still angry that he was able to control,abuse,exploit Brian for so long.

7318653,4,B01127XNEE,"This is a good movie with strong performances by John Cusack and Paul Dano as Brian Wilson. Paul Giamatti is good but can be a little too ""over the top"" in roles with no exception here. Elizabeth Banks looks stunning in the film and does a good job also as Brian's future wife.  The format of looking at Brian Wilson in the ""present"" with John Cusack with flashbacks to the beginning of Brian Wilson's mental health issues played by Paul Dano really works well in this film. The interaction of Brian Wilson with the other Beach Boys is brief but enough to show you that at one point they just got sick of dealing with him but in the end the family comes through for Mr. Wilson.",1468886400,,677,4.330708661417323

7318663,5,B01127XNEE,Great movie,1468886400,,11,5.0
7318664,5,B01127XNEE,"Much has been written about Brian Wilson's life. This movie is supposed to be the factual last word. It was hearbreaking to see the level of outright abuse by Dr. Gene Landy, portrayed excellently here by the hugely talented Paul Giamatti. John Cusack did a fine job playing Wilson at 45-50 years old. Paul Dano was very good as the young Brian. Elizabeth Banks was charming as second (and current) wife Melinda, who saved Brian from the clutches of Landy. My only complaint was the short shrift given to character development for the other Beach Boys band members. Bill Pohlad, the director, told the dual time period tale quite well. As you watch Brian's obsession with melding all sorts of different sounds into the classic song ""Good Vibrations"", you gain an appreciation for perhaps the greatest example of what music producers can accomplish. We saw The Brian Wilson Band in May, 2016 and it is obvious that he can still rehearse a band into a high level of perfection. The very complicated sounds of Good Vibrations and many other Beach Boys' classics were reproduced almost exactly! If you can catch one of the Pet Sounds tour dates you definitely should.
This film is highly recommended for anyone interested and is a must-see for fans of this great band.",1468800000,,1264,4.802752293577981

Then one lazy Sunday afternoon when looking for something to watch, you stumble upon it. And there it is - your day is made! I've always had a soft spot in my heart for Brian Wilson. I read enough about his life to know that he had many, many troubles. And all it takes is listening to one of his many songs to know that he's a musical genius.

Like most child prodigy Brian Wilson is a very gifted song writer / arranger whose mind could not stop the music or the demons.

Also, like many performers he was allowed to fall victim to ""medical charlatans"" that exploited his senses, emotions, and money with drugs.

7318784,5,B01127XNEE,One of the best musical biopic's that I've seen in over a decade! Paul Dano And John Cusack were excellent as Brian Wilson! Every aspect of this movie was put together excellently.  I'm certainly no critic and don't give reviews often however this have me all the feels that a good movie should and had me thinking about how good it was for a few days to where i had too watch it a second time. So I felt it deserves an honest give start review. Any person who gives it a low review either knows nothing about music or the art of film making an more than likely had no real appreciation for the arts.

7318788,5,B01127XNEE,"Interestingly, a realistic insight into the vulnerabilities of superstars. It illustrates the need for a star to keep egomaniacal tendencies in check, maintaining  self-confidence without sacrificing respect for others; to become somewhat humble but not slip too far into selflessness to the point of becoming a psychic vampire. I learnt that the need for honest relationships is absolutely required, particularly if a superstars - or anyone else for that matter - is expected to be well-adjusted to the humanity of life's subtle realities. It teaches that no matter what, no one is truly not bigger than life, and being able to accept and process criticisms and complements regardless of social stature, is a key element in protection against deception - medical malpractice, fraud, hidden agendas of sorts, etc, etc, - by being able to love and recognize being loved.

I like John Cusack and was broadly familiar with the history of the Beach Boys, or so I thought.  This film is a heart-wrenching story of Brian Wilson's struggle with mental illness, a fraudulent therapist who took advantage of him, and future wife who intervened at a time when the rest of his family seemed to have lost interest or given up.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film, as disturbing as it was, and was prompted to learn more about the facts and circumstances that engulfed Wilson at a time when he was so vulnerable.",1468627200,,619,4.460176991150442

The Beach Boys were a big chunk of the music scene when I was a kid but I really had no idea that Brian Wilson was such a musical genius. The scenes where he arranged the music he wrote all in his head were amazing. The love story with his now wife was so touching and how she helped him escape from the doctor who took over his life was like the stuff of adventure films. I am listening to the Beach Boys with a whole other pair of ears now. I highly recommend this movie!,1468627200,,588,4.121739130434783

I never knew the whole story of musical genius Brian Wilson, and it was enlightening and sad to learn of the manipulation and abuse he suffered at the hands of his father, as well as Landy, someone who should have been a trust worthy, medical professional but was really a narcissistic scam artist.  It's a tragedy that Brian lost so much time in the hands of those who should have been helping him. Paul Dano is amazing as young Brian - John Cusack less believable and overdone as older Brian.

The slightly disjointed simple story telling was beautifully acted by John Cusack which brought home deep caring about the individual's life story.

The fact that he survived to continue to grace us with his music says so much about his determination and spirit. Wait through the credits so you can hear him sing 'Love & Mercy'.

7318848,4,B01127XNEE,"I have been a Beach Boys fan from the very beginning.  I went to concerts and followed each of their new releases.  After several years I began to learn about problems within the band and the pressures on Brian Wilson.  I felt saddened at each downbeat piece of news.  Brian's disappearance, the death of Dennis, Murry's ham-fistedness, the sale of the Beach Boys' catalogue.  I tried to keep that separate from the richness of the music so that I could keep enjoying it.  This film, with its time jumps back and forward, did a nice job in explaining what and why through Brian's life.  It filled in a lot of gaps in my understanding of what he has lived through.  Tortured by his great gift, it was difficult for me to watch at times.  Fortunately, we still have him and we still have his music, which is peppered throughout.  I enjoyed it.  You probably will, too.  Especially if you were around in the 60's and 70's.",1468540800,,919,4.469879518072289

He was also taken advantage of by record companies, band members, and ""doctors"" due to his misdiagnosed mental illness. This movie captures all of that.

What impressed me the most is his talent!  The film did a beautiful job capturing how brilliant he is as an artist.
The scenes in the movie when he was younger and making music in his Studio were my favorite.

7319011,5,B01127XNEE,"A beautifully made movie about the life of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys. He was a troubled soul but a supremely talented songwriter. The movie itself was very strong in the portrayal of his addiction and the toxic relationship he had with his father.  His dad must have been a real jerk - that's the nicest word I can think of as I write this, but he really affected Brian Wilson in a very negative way and that screwed him up for life. Then,  after his father died, he got under the control of another control freak worse than his own father!

His salvation was a car salesperson portrayed by Elizabeth Banks. According to the movie, she saved Brian Wilson from himself and from that psychologist/therapist crazy freak that over-medicated him. Brian Wilson is portrayed as a flawed human being but who is not? This 2 plus hours movie portraying his life is just a snapshot of his ongoing life. He is still performing in concerts and as far as I know, he is still married to the same woman who saved his life. He should be admired for letting a movie get made about his life, warts and all!",1468540800,,1093,4.4278606965174125

In addition, Wilson was subjected to severe abuse for a large part of his life by his father and Dr Gene Landy, yet went on to have a productive life. This story/movie was inspirational.

We get to see the genius composer at his peak while simultaneously begin his psychological decline. That multi-instrumental layering in Pet Sounds was lost on a lot of teenagers at the time but astounded Paul McCartney.

This film focused mostly on the latter-years dysfunctional relationship between Brian and his controlling psychologist, but with flashbacks to Brian's creative years, his relationship with his father, his first marriage, etc. John Cusack seems to have a love of topics such as these, and while I wouldn't say this is ""THE"" definitive Beach Boy historical film, it's a different perspective than I've seen from other Beach Boy films. Elizabeth Banks does a great job as Brian's protector - and eventual spouse Melinda. Paul Dano does a great job as young Brian. John Cusack portrays current-age Brian very well, too.

This is a sweet, wonderful and deeply moving film. It captures as no other film about making music the excitement of creativity, and in Brian's case, the agony of mental illness and ""star doctors"". The film focuses on the making of arguably the greatest pop album of all time, Pet Sounds. Brian wrote Pet Sounds to outdo The Beatles' Rubber Soul. In turn, The Beatles made Sgt. Pepper to outdo Pet Sounds. One difference is that The Beatles had George Martin, Brian did it himself, although he generously credits Tony Asher. This is also a thriller, because Mike Love particularly hated Pet Sounds and fought against releasing it. The other Beach Boys, who were Brian's brothers (Mike was a cousin), felt they were simply backup singers on a Brian Wilson album. Later, Brian is held captive by a psychiatrist.

I strongly disagree with the premise underlying the question posed by Brian Wilson's father, at one point in this movie, ""Who do you think you are, Mozart?""  Listen to Smile and Pet Sounds, really listen critically.  Once you do so, you may start to understand that Brian Wilson pretty much is a de facto 20th Century American ""Mozart"", for lack of better term.  Brian Wilson most certainly is an absolute musical genius by any reasonable estimation.  This story of Brian Wilson's life was executed well and was smartly enacted by Dano,Cusack, Banks and the perennial favorite, Giamatti.  The only potential problem with this movie is that I suspect that you may have already needed to have been a fan of Brian Wilson's genius in order to really appreciate this movie.  I hope I am wrong about that suspicion.  However, I am well aware that I  that I had a strong Wilson appreciation bias before I ever heard of this movie, or watched it.

7319319,3,B01127XNEE,"A low key interesting way of telling the Brian Wilson story. It also did a good job of exposing the view to the subtleties and feel of the times. The Cadillac dealership showroom also was an excellent way of stepping back in time.  I watched this movie with a foreigner who was unfamiliar with Brian Wilson and his/Beach Boys music or history . She was especially touched by the story and increased her understanding of mental illness and the problems it causes not only for the individual experiencing the illness but for the family and friends around that person.

This movie is a sad, troubling and thought provoking.  Don't watch if you are looking for a fun escape!  But it is well worth watching if you have an interest in music history.",1467158400,,743,4.606060606060606

7319339,4,B01127XNEE,Thought this would be like so many other musical group stories. It wasn't. It was better. It was a real life portrayal of Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys singing group. Their music was played throughout but Brian's personal life was the prime story. Worth watching.,1467158400,,264,4.760869565217392
7319340,2,B01127XNEE,Could have been a much better screenplay. The Beach Boys were too huge to have a second rate movie made about Brian Wilson. I expected a lot more. Too much time spent on Wilson's craziness and not enough about the music he created.,1467158400,,231,4.395348837209302

7319345,4,B01127XNEE,The acting is authentically Brian Wilson even though he is played by different actors.  The best part was the creation of Good Vibration and the solo of God Only Knows.  Would have been better if the movie expanded more at the end to show how Brian recovered.,1467158400,,259,4.48936170212766

Great performances by both Cusack and Paul Dano, but especially Dano, who captures Brian's illness and his genius with equal aplomb.

I only wish the story would have spent more time on the early Beach Boys rather than the Eugene Landy but to be fair that was a significant part of Brian Wilson's life.

7319376,4,B01127XNEE,Interesting background on a musical genius and icon in California surf history. It may have been a little skewed though since told from Bryan's wives perspective; however it was her story to tell I suppose. It made me sad to find out he was so fragile and that his tragic past and mental instability led to both such beautiful iconic music and his mental breakdown.,1467072000,,365,4.630769230769231

7319378,3,B01127XNEE,"LOVE AND MERCY features talented performers: - Paul Dano as young Brian Wilson, doing as good a job as he can with the part of the Beach Boy's main creative force; John Cusack - as the older, fragile, emotionally scarred Wilson, and the usually terrific Paul Giamatti, playing uber-wacky Eugene Landy, the light-on-ethics shrink who took over Brian Wilson's life when the talented but troubled musician mistakenly turned to him for help and support -- and instead became Landy's emotional prisoner; and finally, the usually comedic Elizabeth Banks in a dramatic role
as the woman who won Wilson's heart and was largely responsible for rescuing him from Landy's grip. The film does its best to present us with a Brian Wilson we can root for, and while we want to care about the film's subject (especially as we get to know the younger Wilson as played by Dano --) -- a flabby, meandering script and a just plain nutty lead character -- combine to create an overall feeling in the viewer of ""What WAS that?""

Assuming the story is not too exaggerated for film, Brian Wilson endured quite a lot and it is amazing how much he achieved in the music world with all he faced.  Paul Dano, as the young Wilson and John Cusack as the older Wilson seem to be two different people but Cusack does a nice job transitioning to the older after a wonderful performance by Dano.

As a fan of the Beach Boys' music and historical music movies like The Jersey Boys, I learned a great deal about the Beach Boys and enjoyed the history.  I am glad I saw this and if you are a music fan this story clears up a lot of myth and makes you feel good about a band that made quite an impact considering their competition which included the Brits like the Beatles.",1467072000,,774,4.280821917808219

The movie itself is well acted, but I found the switch between the character playing his younger years, played by Paul Dano,  and the middle years, excellently played by John Cussack, to be disorienting, but I suppose it was necessary to play those two distinct periods of his life against each other.

7319551,5,B01127XNEE,"I held off watching this film for a while, I guess because I was never a really big fan of the Beachboys. Their music however, shaped a generation, and so I finally sat down to watch it, and I'm very glad I did. If I hadn't, I would have missed a beautifully crafted biopic of The Beach Boys' genius Brian Wilson. The film covers three decades of Wilson's life and his struggles with mental and emotional illness, brought about, in part, by his abusive childhood. We understand his big heart, and his love and sincerity in the face of those past traumas. As his anxiety mounts, he begins to lose touch with reality. Paul Dano is amazing as the young Brian Wilson. Forward to the 80's and Brian, played superbly by John Cusack, has been caught in a web by a fraudulent psychiatrist who is virtually holding him prisoner while he milks Brian for everything he has. Whether you are a Beachboys fan or not, this film should not be missed.",1466899200,,934,4.4678362573099415

The director's use of the two actors to follow that part of Wilson's life was a good choice.  Miss Banks played her part well, as her character was an important part of the story. As always, Paul Giamatti played his part with his usual passion, which in this film made you detest his character to the max.  At times the film moved a bit slow, but if it truly followed this period of Mr. Wilson's life, that would be understandable.

7319632,4,B01127XNEE,Some of the overcoming triumphs (that were just in writing at the end of the movie) should have been part of the movie. I did like how the movie wove Brian Wilson's early life alongside the his current experiences to give a full picture of why he was mentally challenged.

He was fabulous, and even stronger was Paul Giamatti in the type of role if not seen him in.  Paul Dano was also fantastic- reminiscent of Russel Crowe in A Beautiful Mind.

7319673,5,B01127XNEE,"Poignant, compelling and insightful into the life of beach boy, American icon and musical genius Brian Wilson.  Acting is A+, script A+, editing A+.  Highly recommend seeing this film even if you've never heard of or liked the Beach Boys.  Explains the torment Wilson went through enduring his abusive father and pressure to write summer-like surfing hits when his aspirations and innate musical composition ability sought and was obviously capable of  much, much more.  A nice companion to this film is called The Wrecking Crew - a true life documentary of the many of the studio musicians brian worked with in writing his most ambitious and critically-acclaimed work.  Good Vibrations is an incredible inventive and harmonious songs written, not to mention his critically acclaimed but fan-rejected album Pet Sounds which McCartney has called one of the greatest albums ever written.  Agree or disagree...music is a matter of personal taste - there is no question Wilson is a musical genius and the movie does it and  major parts of his life justice.

It goes back and forth from Brian just starting out with the Beach Boys to later in his life.  Brian said of the film ""The factuality is important"" so he agreed with how he was portrayed by the actors. He also stated ""It took me back to when I actually recorded the music""  I'm a Beach Boys fan so I found the film very interesting and enjoyed all the Boys Music!

I know, the Beach Boys are Brian Wilson and vice versa, but this takes place after the death of his brother Dennis. Jon Cusack, one of favorite actors, plays the older Brian Wilson and Paul Giamatti plays the manipulative doctor who's keeping him isolated and treating him for paranoid schizophrenia.

7319766,3,B01127XNEE,"An OK movie. I had no background on the troubles of Brian Wilson, and the movie helped me to understand some of it.

Wish there was a little more musical history to the story other than some songs being developed/played at certain points. I thought Paul Dano did a great job (and didn't know he was skilled vocally), but found it odd that John Cusack was selected for the roll. I have no clue as to if the personalities at different stages of his life were quite so different, but along with the differences in actors' appearances, it was hard to have belief it was the same person.

Some comments that may be construed as spoilers, so stop reading if you care to now.

The relationship with his father was not quite fully developed, nor was there much in the way of his own family mentioned when it was likely a key juncture in which his mental health spiraled. Nor was there much in the way of explaining/showing the substance abuse history.",1466640000,,943,4.47093023255814

What this film added to my love of their music is how Brian was affected by his mental illness and the drugs that helped fuel his music, especially while writing and producing Pet Sounds.  How he started Good Vibrations with just a few notes he banged out on his piano to the final song is just amazing.  That one segment of the movie is a very good reason to watch the entire film.  This movie is also a love story about Brian and Melinda Ledbetter who spent years getting Brian away from the psychologist who controlled his life by preying on his fragile mental state and lots of medications to keep him under control.",1466640000,,712,4.363636363636363

Growing up in the 60s and 70s I knew Brian had drug and mental issues but I had no idea the reasons behind them. Drug induced issues yes, but not what I thought. Where he got the drugs and from who was frightening. He was a significant member of the Beach Boys Band even though he wasn't always present for a lot of their success on stage. Brian is brilliant and wrote most of the songs that catapulted the Boys to super stardom. His family had basically written him off as crazy until a stranger came along and intervened. Sometimes we just don't know who you can or cannot trust. I don't know where his mother was in his life but they portrayed the father as a total abuser.

7320283,4,B01127XNEE,"I liked this movie because it showed how hard Brian Wilson, a musical genius, had to work to turn the sound in his head into a finished work of art.  There aren't many movies that even try to show the creative process and how hard it is.  I also think the movie showed how almost everybody around Brian Wilson, starting with his abusive father, wanted to be in control of his music and the money.  The exception seems to be his two brothers, who apparently disappeared from his life for awhile, and the woman who became his second wife.  Fortunately, the Wilson family listened to her, after she could show them his will.  As the movie shows, genius can have a very dark downside, including attracting the kind of people who will do a lot of harm. As it turned out, Brian Wilson was finally lucky and found someone who could provide what he needed at a time in his life when he could help himself.  It's too bad it took so long.  Just think of all the great music that didn't get made.",1466467200,,985,4.320652173913044

There is a lot of shuffling back and forth from the 1960s to the 1980s and beyond, with different actors playing Brian. Paul Giamatti's portrayal of charlatan psychologist Dr. Eugene Landry steals the show.

Elizabeth Banks as Melinda was.perfectly cast as future Brian's saving grace,  While I thought John Cusack did a good job as future Brian,  I sometimes felt his character lacking depth, which  may be what was intended.  However I found him hard to watch in some scenes, because of the pain iinflicfed  upon him by the doctor.  Thank goodness for the wonderful  Beachboy musical injection, and merciful happy ending.

I've known most of the history of Brian's troubles before watching the movie, so no big surprises. I thought Paul Dano did an admirable job as the younger Brian and Paul Giamatti's performance as Eugene Landy was top-notch and scary. Elizabeth Banks did a nice job as Melinda, and I enjoyed the parts with Brian and ""The Wrecking Crew"". I would have given this movie 5 stars, but the other cast members didn't add much if anything. I was a little disappointed in John Cusack's performance because it fell short of my expectations based on some of his other work.

Genius? probably. Supremely gifted, absolutely! Major psychological issues, without a doubt.",1466294400,,331,5.148148148148148
7320584,5,B01127XNEE,"Brian Wilson's songs had more impact on me than I happily admit: ""Caroline No,"" ""God Only Knows,"" ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" and others. I am very fortunate. To glimpse what Wilson experienced and what he recovered from and how much his second wife overcame and conquered, before becoming his wife, is greatly appreciated.

Humankind has some 7 trillion person-years of experience and observations of the facts of reality. But each newborn has a two to three decade window in which to comprehend the path on which he or she would embark to live a full life of some eighty years in order to discover the person he or she really is.

The chances of humankind discovering how great is the person each infant may autonomously perfect (verb) are slim. It grieves my heart to think of the people who die young, and I think ""Love & Mercy"" will help make a better future.",1466294400,,858,4.601307189542483

It broke my heart to learn about the mental and physical abuse from his father. Shame on him. I can't help but think, ""What would Brian be like today if his father treated him with love and kindness?"". The doctor/therapist in his life should be in jail. He took advantage of Brian's situation. That was heart breaking to watch too. John Cusack and Paul Dano did a fantastic job as Brian Wilson!",1466294400,,553,4.485148514851486
7320594,5,B01127XNEE,I grew up listening to the Beach Boys and later I vaguely knew about Brian Wilson's psychological issues or how it affected his life.

Surrounded by a destructive father, absent mother and cousin just wanting endless repeats of formulas that make him a big man on stage, Brian struggles to share with the world the music he hears inside.

7320610,3,B01127XNEE,"""Love & Mercy"" (2015) examines the 1980s toxic relationship between Brian Wilson and psychologist Dr. Eugene Landy. It also delves into the dynamic between Brian and his abusive father.

The studio segments are extremely well done.

Paul Dano plays young Brian Wilson superbly (he was nominated for a Golden Globe for this performance.)

John Cusack as 1980s Brian Wilson is less believable. I had a hard time seeing any semblance to Wilson - both physically and affect-wise. But once you suspend disbelief, Cusack's segments are integral to the story although his acting is a bit mawkish at times; and he definitely lacks Brian Wilson's childlike nature.

The movie is a bit uneven - kind of drags in parts and eventually runs out of steam towards the very end, BUT, well worth the time. Highly recommended.",1466294400,,808,4.962962962962963

7320659,4,B01127XNEE,"A very good movie about the young Brian Wilson and the older (and crazier) Brian Wilson.
The actor who plays the young Brian Wilson is especially good - I liked the sequences from his youth better than the older Brian Wilson who is under the thumb of a manipulative psychologist and in a relationship but really, the best part is the sequences from the early days.
Most of the movie is from the early days - very good movie.",1466208000,,424,4.379746835443038

The character of Melinda Ledbetter - a woman who played an integral role in Brian Wilson's life - was portrayed as a two-dimensional cardboard cutout of a person. ""Older Brian"" came off as a real creep. This, combined with the flat representation of Melinda, made Melinda seem as though she must be a gold digger. Something that was absolutely not the case in reality.

It brought Melinda in too quickly and I really wanted to see him rescued.  The ending was a bit cheesy.  I believe Brian has achieved much in his life.  This movie was unable to tell such a complicated artist's life and it ended making viewers believe his love for Melinda was his salvation.  While I am sure she  is lovely and we know they married, it reminded me too much of a soap opera romance.  The 2 portrayals of Brian were well acted, but it detracted me from the real story, which I believed would be about Brian Wilson and his journey through his mental illness into some light.",1466208000,,745,4.3478260869565215

Outstanding music and excellent portrayals of the Beach Boys who can't seem to help Brisn particularly Mike Love who did not like the change of directions starting with Pet Sounds.

7321099,5,B01127XNEE,"So much great acting and an incredible screenplay. Back and forth in time periods is seamless. It feels like real life when something jogs your memory, like a place, smell or breeze, and it takes you back to a place in time that rolls in your head like a super 8 mm movie.

Character development and acting are as strong as screenplay, dialogue,  etc. Paul Giamatti is always good. We're annoyed with Dr. Landy the first moment we meet him. Way to go, Paul, we hate you already.

So many great scenes: The unfolding of Wilson's genius of ""Pet Sounds,"" the excitement from the studio musicians, the embarrassment of dealing with his cousin who is a meathead,  the quiet scene in the car;  on and on.

Elizabeth Banks could have Erin Brockoviched her Melinda Ledbetter. Instead, Banks builds our heroine's strength with stillness and quiet as she slowly figures out what is happening. You can almost feel the moment she puts on a cape and sets out to save our guy.

John Cusack needs more meaty roles, comedy, drama, whatever - any role that lets him unleash his talent.  Like Banks, he doesn't play his larger-than-life legend Brian Wilson character like he's in a Cecil B. DeMille production.

Instead, Cusack helps the audience see that Wilson's a quiet, desperate soul who longs to live and love, but is unable to figure out how. He doesn't seem weak, just incapable of getting away from Dr. Landy and his circumstances. Just kept wondering through the movie, ""where are all the brothers?"" Why did it take a stranger to save his life?

Best for last, Paul Dano. Ever since he broke his silence in ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" he won me over. I thought he would be one of those actors that would slowly build a career, and maybe he did, but I bounced from LMS to Love and Mercy without seeing him in anything else.

Again, the best part of the movie is Dano's energy in bringing ""Pet Sounds"" to life. Dano's screen presence forced us to watch Wilson struggle with mental illness, his horrible, unsupportive, abusive father and the gooey happiness of his brothers all in the spotlight of millions of screaming fans.",1466035200,,2110,4.660377358490566

7321120,3,B01127XNEE,"Love & Mercy stretches the formula of bio-pic in a mostly positive way.  For one thing - we get two fine actors playing one part - Brian Wilson.  While I'm not sure that gimmick actually works - the performances from Dano and Cusak are both excellent, although Dano embodies the role and the persona of Wilson in a way that Cusak simply can't.  The double  casting is also reflected in the story structure which interweaves ""young"" Brian with ""older"" Brian. Each has his own tremendous difficulties. We're essentially watching what feels like two halves of two movies.  And, in that sense, I came away feeling a bit shortchanged. The story with Dr. Landry feels especially truncated.  All of the most interesting action happens off screen and then gets summarized in the usual bio-pic update at the end.  And that's too bad. This might have made a more satisfying limited mini-series.  At any rate, Giamatti and Banks are also terrific and the movie always stops itself when it feels like it's going into bio-pic cliche mode, which I really appreciate.  Brian Wilson had a hard life making simple, happy music.  That dichotomy is addressed but ultimately, we still never quite get below the surface.",1466035200,,1199,4.862068965517241

Once again a great performance from John Cusack. Elizabeth Banks does a fine job to in her performance as well and what a doll. Loved the retro clothing, cars and home interiors. I had no idea Brian Wilson had such a traumatic life which most likely lead to his mental illness issues.

I recognize that many do not know who he is. (although they MAY have heard one or two
songs of his without knowing what they were.)  Surf~pop (music) is really more about
southern Calif. culture of the 1960's, than it is about surfing. That is merely the 'motif '
or setting for the lyrical poetry and musical themes of Beach Boys era. But their music
sold MILLIONS of records. MILLIONS. He worked so hard at creating it, that he suffered
nervous exhaustion. He became a victim of 'Pop~psychiatry' as well. He was over~medicated
(which nearly killed him). And he had to be rescued by family and friends. Here's his story
told in the early years (with Paul Dano) and later years (with John Cusack). They're good.

just BET that you will soon be singing~along with them. That will be YOUR love and mercy.",1465948800,,973,4.591954022988506

The brothers aren't much in here, or the first wife at all- but the handy villain Mike Love gets plenty of chances to pick on our huggable genius. There is lots of stuff to love here- studio time for us all during the gestation of ""Good Vibrations""- enough mention of ""Heroes and Villains"" (a personal favorite), and lots of Beach Boys music scattered throughout. We learn about the 4 Freshmen and how important they were to us. The second wife saves our hero from his savior-cum-master. Lots of saving going on here. Definitely worth a look.

He was in no way believable as the older Brian Wilson.  He reminded me of Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man.  It was very distracting.

2. The movie was continually switching from present to past which broke up the continuity of the movie.
3. There were large skips of key parts of the story, probably to limit the length. It would have been better to make it a longer movie or a series.",1465948800,,555,4.450980392156863
7321255,4,B01127XNEE,"OK, maybe it doesn't deserve 4 stars, but I love John Cusack! So he gets a point! And the rest of the movie? Well, it was put together with Brian and his wife, so they left a lot of the unpleasant stuff out, but then there's no balance! You have to show where he was to have it make sense that he came back from that place! And I'm sorry, I like Paul Dano, but this is not a movie that makes you want to root for him to make it back--he just doesn't make you care. So for anyone unclear on the story, they are not going to get it, and they are going to hit the pause button and maybe not come back! He just looks so unclear and miserable that you can't stand to look at him! So the Cusack parts of the movie work--he shows vulnerability and charm and you get why he is trying to make it back. And I also love Paul Giamotti but he was terrible too. Why would anyone trust or put their faith in someone so miserable and hateful? So the movie really does not work mostly because of those two characterizations, but I would watch it anyway, just to see the parts where Cusack gives you insights to what might have been. Worth watching, but certainly could have have been done better. Although again, this was the version Brian Wilson sanctioned, so there's that!",1465948800,,1258,4.159836065573771

Though it's a bit jarring to have two actors who look nothing alike playing Brian Wilson (and I'm not sure whether it really worked at the end of the day), I otherwise thought both stories were compelling and involving, with all the actors delivering outstanding performances. The ""flashbacks"" of Paul Dano as the young Wilson coming up with iconic Beach Boy tunes at the piano and in the studio were great, but the ""flashforwards"" of John Cusack's older, nearly-broken Wilson were just as fascinating as he tries to break away from his dependency on his manipulative and controlling therapist, Eugene Landy (played by the always dependable Paul Giamatti).

Paul Dano is haunting and totally believable as young Brian, and John Cusack is heartbreaking as old Brian. Wilson's descent is disturbing to watch, but the past/future portrayal gives hope during the darkest moments. Knowing Wilson survives makes his father and his therapist bearable. The hero of the movie, and of Wilson's life, apparently, is Elizabeth Banks as Melinda Ledbetter. Although I know how the story ends, at least so far, I kept saying to Melinda, ""run, run, run away.""

7321321,5,B01127XNEE,"This movie provides amazing insight on the the genius and tradgedy of Brian Wilson who is played by Paul Dano (younger) and John Cusack (older). They embody Brian Wilson in an almost eerie way in their performance. This movie is heavy, but there is a powerful resolution and left me feeling positive. It wasn't the same story of a gifted artist falling in the depths of despair and dying from an overdose but how it is never too late to live life. It is awesome how the evolution of the Beach Boys music is represented and made me appreciate how innovative and dynamic it was for the time. I want to listen to ""Pet Sounds"" in the dark now, as Brian Wilson was quoted as saying in the movie.

I would be OK with surfing and the time & place.  It was very intimate, not naughty, a close view into the life of Brian Wilson himself.

7321358,2,B01127XNEE,"Any lifelong fan of the Beach Boys would be fascinated to learn about the creative genius of Brian Wilson.  The performance of Paul Dano as a young Brian was absolutely sublime and a good reason to watch the movie.  The elder days in the life of Brian were portrayed by John Cusack, as the old and young segments were interleaved in the fashion of flashbacks.

Unfortunately, Cusack failed to deliver on what could have been an Oscar-worthy journey of Brian Wilson's life in the 1980s.  Drugs and mental illness built a prison in Wilson's mind and Dr. Eugene Landy, played by Paul Giamatti, was the manipulative prison guard.  The result of the chemistry of Cusack and Giamatti, in the presence of Elizabeth Banks as the catalyst should have been spectacular explosion of emotions, but it was more like watching Alka-Seltzer fizz in a glass.

The final hope for enjoyment in the movie was in the music.  Again, Paul Dano's portrayal of young Wilson in the creative throes of musical genius was the single redeeming aspect of the movie.",1465862400,,1035,4.780898876404494

7321362,3,B01127XNEE,"If you're going to make a movie about a music band you should play more of their music. Also, the movie concentrates too much on one period, and one of the musicians. Granted, Brian Wilson was responsible for most of the music production, but the movie might have been better served with a more inclusive story about the whole group. It was depressing mostly watching Brian go through all the mental issues he had in one relatively small period of his life. The movie emphasized this period over what must have been a pretty good thrill ride for most of the band.",1465862400,,563,4.529411764705882

7321645,3,B01127XNEE,"The good: Uncanny reconstructions of the Pet Sounds sessions, early Beach Boys concerts, and early promotional photos and films.

The bad: A love story that seems padded and draggy (the movie could have been 15 minutes shorter), an oversimplified treatment of the Landy/Wilson relationship (Landy was abusive and exploitative, but also may have saved Brian's life by weaning him off a drug-fueled lifestyle that was killing him), and not enough of the Beach Boys' music.

On the soundtrack, the collages of sonic fragments attempting to depict Brian deteriorating mental state were cleverly done but didn't connect to me emotionally. In his mind, Brian also heard beautiful music having very specific arrangements and orchestrations, and although this is exemplified in the Pet Sounds sessions, the sound collages depict this process as crippled and vague.

This is a worthwhile watch for Beach Boys fans, but its tendency towards melodrama at the expense of the music will disappoint many.",1465776000,,990,5.333333333333333

7321747,5,B01127XNEE,"The Beach Boys were very popular when I was growing up, though my parents preferred other musical styles, and I gravitated more to other musicians.  Still, the Beach Boys music was at the first party I attended in high school and it was always on the radio.  It was something we took for granted, but it was so refreshingly different from every other group or style at the time. Growing up in California in the 1960's and 70's, we took a lot for granted, including the surf and the sun.
  Fast forward to 2014, and I was strangely drawn to see this movie.  I grew up, went to college, medical school, and did my residency. Now I am a psychiatrist, in practice since 1991, but I still revert to a teenager when I hear the Beach Boys.
  This movie hit me on so many levels: the creative genius of Brian Wilson, his enormous sensitivity, and his mental torture.  We see his painful childhood, his amazingly talented brothers and friends, his truest love, and the barbaric medical mismanagement that marked a period in the middle of his life.
  Without giving away all the details, this movie is a must-see if you are even remotely interested in how music and the life of the mind are intertwined.  Brian's music is already in my soul and in my bones, and psychiatry is my profession, so I went to see it with my husband on a day when both of us should have been at work.  It was visually very appealing with very atmospheric photography, especially of sand and water. Musically, it was completely satisfying.  Most remarkable of all, however, were the actors' performances, depicting Brian Wilson during two different decades of his life.
  This movie was deeply moving and in the end, completely triumphant, as you will see.  Don't miss it!

7321748,5,B01127XNEE,"Fantastic film!  Rock and Pop star biopics usually often have a very similar story and this film seems to avoid some of the worst pitfalls of the familiar Rock star narratives....  Good acting.. Good writing and believable.  This film captures something not only about Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys but more about the human condition by telling his story which is the story of so many People.  Whether we are rich or poor, talented or average, so many of us  often end up surrounded by people who don't understand us and are in too much of a hurry to really take the time and be patient and diligent enough to see where their brother, sister or friend is coming from or what is happening to them.  And when someone is surrounded by people who can't see what is happening and don't know where to get help, the pressure to surrender can push even the best of us over the edge to the point were it is easy to lose confidence in ourselves just because we might need some help... or maybe just some Love and Mercy..",1465689600,,1011,4.379679144385027

7321787,3,B01127XNEE,"This movie works hard to give the viewer a look back to the early success of the Beach Boys. The basic story is told well.

However I believe that the depiction of Wilson's visions and hallucinations won't have much impact on people without some understanding of the effects of the drugs taken.

I would say that it did try to show the sheer brilliance of Brian Wilson, but it was dampened by saying  he was creative because of him taking drugs. Simply not true! The guy really is a true musical genius. And a survivor of terrible abuse.",1465689600,,417,4.085365853658536
7321809,4,B01127XNEE,"I had wanted to see this movie when it was in theaters but it was in and out before I had the chance. Too bad. Love & Mercy was an awesome movie and an incredible look at what happened during that dark period in Brian Wilson's life. While Jon Cusack may not have the best resemblance to an older Wilson, his acting chops are on full display in portraying this music icon. The back and forth of the younger and older Wilson aren't jarring. The movie makes sense despite all the back and forth.
If I had one quibble with the movie, it might be in the lack of time given to most of the other Beach Boys. Yes, this was a movie about Wilson himself but we rarely see more than the tense interaction between Brian and his cousin Mike Love. Dennis and Carl, his brothers, hardly speak at all in the movie and I don't recall there being even one line uttered by the actor playing Al Jardine. The movie also is geared towards those who are familiar with the Beach Boys history, as peripheral characters like Van Dyke Parks are brought into the movie with little explanation as to how they managed to become part of Brian's world of music creation.
I also would have liked seeing at least one flashback scene showing how Wilson and Landy first came in contact with each other. Still, these are minor complaints considering the overall quality of the movie. Many of us have read some of the things Brian Wilson went through in his life. love and Mercy gives us a more in-depth look and gives one a new appreciation for not only Wilson's difficult life but his genius as well.",1465689600,,1564,4.378006872852234
7321810,5,B01127XNEE,"An amazing look into the life of Brian Wilson. Mozart of the 60's and 70's. Dano and Cusack are very good. Elizabeth Moss, loved her. Paul Giamatti, off the charts as Wilson's Dr. Landy. Scares the crap out of you every time he's in a scene.
Beach Boys fans will love it. Anyone with an interest in Wilson will love it. Not easy to watch. Front row seats to watch the demons that haunted Wilson from the inside and ones who surrounded him in everyday life.",1465689600,,456,4.313953488372093

But this movie is about so much more. Melinda (played brilliantly by Elizabeth Banks) reached deep in her soul and found the strength and power to win over enough allies to eventually defeat the evil Dr. Landy (played well by Paul Giamatti) and save Brian Wilson. Be warned that the movie constantly jumps around in time... more than any other film I can remember... so it takes a lot of patience and attention to watch, but by the end I was deeply touched. Be sure to watch the credits at the end and you will see the genius performing in the flesh... If you have a heart, you'll connect with him. A few years ago I watched Beautiful Dreamer: Brian Wilson and the Story of 'Smile' and if you want to get more depth on this subject, I recommend it as a good companion piece to Love and Mercy.

Paul Dano and John Cusack are pitch-perfect (pardon the pun), and Elizabeth Banks shows a real understanding, and an understated performance that is spot-on.  But maybe the real star of this film is the SOUND DESIGN.  You MUST listen on great headphones while watching this movie -- there is a staggering amount of sonic information that propels and informs the visuals, and it has to be the most creative soundtrack I've heard in many years.

His heart and soul were in this. I truly believe that his performance carried the film. I would have liked more music in it, but that is just because I'm a fan.",1465257600,,478,4.263736263736264

7321973,5,B01127XNEE,"I'm a long-time Brian Wilson/Beach Boys fan and have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this film. While it was not a perfect film, I appreciated how sensitive it was to both the subject and the man. By this I mean that the story of the music itself was handled quite well (an almost documentary style given to the passages showing the production of the music with the Wrecking Crew, featuring a commendable attention to historical detail). I also give the writers credit for inserting expository dialog that wasn't painfully obvious. I got the sense that the makers of this film had an genuine affection for the music as well as the environment from which it came.
Most important to me was that the characters drawn in the story were not as 2-dimensional as one might expect. I'm of course talking about Eugene Landy, Murray Wilson and even Mike Love, all of whom have been cast as villains in the various tellings of Wilson's story. Don't get me wrong, Landy and Wilson's father don't come out of this looking anything less than unsavory, but there is some effort made to cast them as individuals whose relationships to Brian Wilson are not without some merit. Toxic relationships, yes, but nuanced as well.",1465257600,,1211,4.7440758293838865

7321979,5,B01127XNEE,"Beyond my expectations. Not a Cusak fan but he was fabulous in his portrayal as was everyone else.  Elizabeth Banks was perfect. The pacing was enthralling and had no dead minutes so the unfolding of events was done in a way that kept me riveted. I LOVED hearing the music having grown up in So. Ca.. One of my first purchases was in elementary school, the 45 to the single ""I get around"". (I still have them). The Beach boys & Jan& Dean really had a good feel for young life then, where the beach watching surfers, starting bon fires & singing were real. I don't know how the rest of the country responded to the music, but it sort of reflected ""the calm before the storm"", a bit like the early Beatles. Music expressed so much for a generation exploding out of the families of parents still stuck in the 50's. It was nice that even with the loss of innocence with Viet Nam, the massacres at Kent State & Jackson State, the Beach Boys enriched their sound but kept that little area ""In my Room"" to listen and get away from the stresses of revolutionary conflict and change to hear the simplicity and magic in the music that spoke to everyone.  The film really underlined the organic composition of the music.  It was nice to see how some of the music was put together by this genius. Be sure & watch after the film closes and before credits. STOP HERE .##### POSSIBLE SPOILER#### He had a connection that was so remarkable that it actually withstood the constant barrage of negativity to some extent.  It also showed a bit of the abuse and theft of property and life suffered by people with disabilities all the time because they are vulnerable. It's how we treat our most vulnerable that defines who we are. You can see the difficulty of his not only having to deal with the constant challenge of his mental health issues, medical malpractice giving him enough meds to kill him, physical & verbal abuse, and yet still be able to tap into his music. That shows a real inner strength. He was so lucky that someone who embodied ""Love and Mercy"" entered his life without judgment, with an open heart and the courage to do the right thing when no one else stood up for him. That negativity came from all around and no one did anything about it until ... just see it.  I did find it odd that his family sued that awful DR. when they witnessed it for years and did nothing, with dad continuing his verbal & physical abuse of Brian...much like the Dr., but they were the only ones with legal standing to be able to stop that awful doctor they left Brian with. The beatings Brian had from his father that made him lose most of his hearing in one ear must have given him concussions or other head injury that could explain some of the issues. Another medical mystery.",1465084800,,2759,4.412573673870334

7321991,4,B01127XNEE,"Great all-around casting.  The actor portraying  Younger Brian, Paul Dano, is scary-good at it.  Cusack as Old Brian plays it ""smaller"", but also with the gravitas and the weight of life experience that the real Brian displays.  Giamatti plays the Svengali-like  ""manager/doctor"" with palpable menace and a convincing portrayal of a psychotic on the edge. The actor playing Mike Love also gets his douchiness just right as well.  Gives a very intimate feeling for being in the studio with Brian as he creates his best-loved masterpieces, and you feel it, deeply, when nobody around him understands or appreciates the work at the point of inception.  Overall, you feel sad for Brian's ordeal, and hopeful that he can recover some joy and continue to create, while he still has time here to do so.  As an aside,  you really, REALLY need to check out Brian on tour, with his own backing group; sounds better and ""truer"" than any other so-called ""Beach Boys"" concert on tour. The man still has the chops.  He's this century's American Mozart.",1465084800,,1038,4.88

He sings beautifully too! I was skeptical of John Cusack's casting, but I'm telling you, he has nailed Brian's voice and more importantly, his essence. Giamatti is fantastic as always.

This is the worst film I've seen in years and I teach scriptwriting for a living.  In my opinion, because Brian's now on his own and not getting much press, this was his project, done in an attempt to create some publicity.  If he hasn't written a book, that'll be next.

7322035,4,B01127XNEE,"Love and Mercy traces the breakdown and redemption of Brian Wilson at the hands of a sleazoid psychologist and through the ministrations of the woman who would become his wife, Melinda Ledbetter.  While there are scenes of BWs recording studio wizardry and very brief scenes of the Beach Boys in performance this is less of a musical biopic than the account of an individuals personal suffering.  In addition to his psychologists controls and brutalization, BWs father beat him so severely that he all but lost his hearing in one ear.

Paul Dano plays the young Brian, John Cusack the mature Brian, wounded by years of drugs and alcohol followed by his maltreatment at the hands of his psychologist, Gene Landy, played to a fare-thee-well by Paul Giamatti.  All of the smarm, ugliness and personal violence exhibited in his role in Billions were honed in this role.

The movie is engaging and avoids both easy sentimentality and the temptation to focus exclusively on the music.  Mike Loves artistic differences with Brian (and his forthright-to-the-point-of-cruel expression of them) are presented honestly.  Elizabeth Banks gives a solid performance as Melinda.  The film is a bit difficult to watch because Brians life has involved so much suffering, but before the final credits roll we receive an update on his situation, including the legal defeat of Landy, the acknowledgment of Brians brilliance, the greatness of the album, Pet Sounds and his marriage to Melinda.  In the course of the credits we see Brian performing, including his song Love and Mercy; this extended credit cookie is not to be missed.

What I did not like: Melinda seemed too good to be true, although Elizabeth Banks did bring some depth to the role. I wasn't entirely convinced by Giamatti's portrayal of Dr. Landis, though I'm not sure if it's his fault or that of the script. He seemed too weak and flawed as a human being to have had that much power over Wilson's mind. He needed to show more seriousness or gravitas at times to be convincing. He was a straw man, a cardboard villain that can be easily knocked down.",1458000000,2,706,4.559055118110236

But director/writer quickly turn this musical seaside romp into unpleasant inside-out look at musical genius, drowning in weirdness as mental capacities of Beach Boys' lead singer and writer diminish. Its not that it didn't happen this way; I am no historian in that regard. But show acts like they never saw Roger Corman's The Trip and many other films of the 60's, with actors pawing thin air and hearing funny things thinking it is somehow genius. Develops been-there-done-that feel with stunted song track; never got the feel that there was either musical talent or success behind group.

I also thought that the juxtaposing of young and older Brian Wilson was interesting and well done. Young Brian was played by Paul Dano and older Brian was played by John Cusack.

7322147,3,B01127XNEE,"I couldn't reconcile the fact that Paul Dano seemed to really *be* Brian Wilson, versus John Cusack's actors interpretation.  Either one, by itself would have been fine, but bouncing back and forth between the young Brian Wilson and somebody's take on the older Brian Wilson (when the genuine article is readily available for reference) reality broke the spell for me.  Why did they expend so much effort precisely recreating the studio sessions, the cars, the clothes, only to use a well-known actor who the audience instinctively knows is not Brian Wilson?

The DVD has some interesting supplements.  Apparently, the producers thought the public would not be familiar with Dr. Landy.  I am not a huge Beach Boys fan, but if you know anything at all about Brian Wilson, you know about Landy.  Another odd bit, with the real Brian Wilson, is when they take him into the studio where he originally recorded and have him watch scenes from the movie.  Brian seems fine, but it seemed like a trip to the wax museum, to show him actors mimicking the Beach Boys in every detail, all alive and well.

I did like the movie, though.  There are some great performances and the last 5-10 minutes were really exceptional.",1456358400,,1209,4.8019323671497585
7322148,4,B01127XNEE,"If it wasn't for Brian Wilson's musical genius, composing and instrumentation, melodies and writing lyrics, arrangements, the Beach Boys would not have become a chart topping hits band. The movie is a biography about Brian's life. Two actors play him, one, younger, for the '60s era and the other, older, for the '80s and early '90s. By having two actors, it more clearly contrasted the two time periods. It focuses on his struggle with mental health, having auditory hallucinations (hearing voices). Dr. Eugene Landy (Gene) diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenia. Doctors at UCLA later determined he actually had the much milder form of schizoid affective disorder and both have different methods of treatment. Dr. Landy was a credible psychotherapist with high profile clients like rockstar Alice Cooper and musician George Benson. Initially, Dr. Landy helped Brian recover from being lethargically confined to his bed all day and in losing weight (he had weighed in at 300-pounds). But, later, Dr. Landy was stepping out of bounds by overmedicating Brian so that he felt drowsy at times or else hyperactive at other times. Brian's girlfriend and future wife, Melinda, (they married in 1995) was a godsend. She transformed his life and wasn't about to relinquish her friendship just because Dr. Landy demanded her too. She worked through the courts to get Brian out from under Dr. Landy's fanatical and maniacal legal guardianship. In 1992, Dr. Landy had to surrender his license to practice psychology in the state of California, and he was barred from having further contact with Brian as part of a settlement of a lawsuit brought against him.",1456358400,,1650,5.137546468401487

7322182,3,B01127XNEE,"It was well acted and I like how they started the story with Brian Wilson meeting his wife Melinda, right before the culmination of all his life's trials forces them to overcome his obstacles and pursue the happiness in his love and music that he had been denied for much of his life. I like the way they illustrate this through his lyrics.  I thought the overwrought portrayal of his mental illness and his abusive ""therapist"" early on in the story seemed unrealistic though. I mean, I can believe it was this extreme, but I doubt it was so obvious to his wife from the moment they met, with Landy pushing him around and openly spying on him in public while he all but has a nervous breakdown while test driving a Cadillac with her. If they kept it more subtle at the beginning and slowly built to where she sees how bad it is, it would be better. They may have been going for that effect but there was too much too soon.",1455148800,,922,4.2988505747126435

7322190,3,B01127XNEE,"This is a hard film to rate. On the one hand, Love & Mercy is unlike any biopic Ive ever seen and I love that its not just another generic, by-the-numbers portrait of a difficult genius. Paul Dano is utterly amazing as Brian Wilson; its one of those performances like Sean Penn in Milk where one almost forgets that they're watching someone act because the execution is so flawless and immersive.

The studio sequences of Wilson making Pet Sounds are dazzling, as well. Many biopics show the construction of classic music in rather dull and overly reverential ways; scenes in the studio with Wilson directing a lineup of the finest studio musicians of the era are extremely energetic and engaging and the film really shines during these moments. The screenplay (by Michael Alan Lerner and Oren Moverman) is also pretty good, providing a portrait not only of Wilsons genius, but also his sadness and pain.

On the other hand, this is not just a portrait of Pet Sounds-era Brian Wilson; its also the portrait of Brian Wilson as a troubled older man, played by John Cusack. Hes a fine actor, but he doesnt really look anything like Paul Dano or Brian Wilson and while his performance isn't awful or embarrassing, hes also clearly miscast. The back-and-forth between younger and older Brian Wilson is not nearly as interesting or lively as it should have been; this film wants to be something like Walk The Line meets A Beautiful Mind meets The Godfather Part II, and it just comes across as an impressive mess.",1454976000,,1507,4.748091603053435

7322199,5,B01127XNEE,"So glad I rented this video from Amazon..  Great acting.  Sweet story of Brian Wilson, song writer for the Beach Boys.  He had a horrible, physically and emotionally abusive father.  Brian Wilson wrote songs for the Beach Boys but stayed a sweet guy, throughout his life (except they say he dallied with women, as a Rock Star, and he did heavy drugs, during part of his career).  Paul Giamatti plays a bad guy (based on real person) who supposedly provided Brian Wilson with counseling and became his legal guardian, because Brian had grown too difficult for his family to handle.
  The movie shows many bad guys who just wanted Brian to write hit songs and records and did not really care about him.  Brian put alot of pressure on himself to write hit songs, but apparently he hit a time when his hits ended.  This made Brian depressed (pressure on himself), and his cousin and the Paul Giamatti thought being abusive would get him back and on track as a song writer/money maker for everyone.  The movie has a happy ending, because Brian meets a supportive woman who becomes his second wife.  They get rid of Paul Giamatti who was banished from practicing psychology in California.  Brian and his wife are happy together, so there is a happy ending.",1454544000,,1250,4.657534246575342

7322212,5,B01127XNEE,"First I must admit to mildly despising the Beach Boys in an admittedly snobbish way for a lifetime. Having one of their songs stuck in my head was something I considered a mild form of torture. This is what I love about the power of film! This movie completely turned my mind and opened my eyes and ears. I adore Paul Dano, and his acting was sublime, as always, as the young Brian Wilson; John Cusack played the older Brian with equal vulnerability and rawness. Another of my favorites, Paul Giamatti, channeled a sleazy character with his usual skills. I mean what a great cast. But Elizabeth Banks was the real hero of the movie and the played her part quietly and quite beautifully. In a dreamlike way, the movie sucked me in to a world I had known nor cared nothing of previously. If you are looking for a really linear biopic, this movie is not it. Instead the film is like a piece of music itself, riffing on a tormented life that is elevated by love and music.  For days after I watched it, I couldn't shake the film and my mind kept returning to it, and wondering at it's deep effect on me. The Beach Boys, really?  If that isn't the sign of a good film, what is?  Somehow how this film made me want to listen with care to some Beach Boys music - especially the beautiful (and yes annoyingly catchy) tune God only Knows.",1454457600,2,1329,4.329317269076305

7322224,5,B01127XNEE,"This is probably one of the best movie I've seen about well known pop musician Group-THE BEACH BOYS, more Concentrated in BRIAN WILSON, the lead singer song writer. Paul Dano and John Cusak did the young/ old Brian Wilson's part and I cannot tell which actor did better for the roll.
The great thing about this movie was it actually showed how Brian Willson inspired each songs to compose from single melody to actual song and that was very entertaining.
Also Brian Wilson had a serious mental problem as he got aged. Many genious artists had mental problems and he was one of them. Paul Giamatti -who is a doctor -was the one who was taking adventage of him and almost suffocate him to death, (When Brian was old like he is in his late 40s or something)
That is the time when he met this really nice woman Elizabeth Banks who actually saved him from that horrible doctor with love.
They fall in love madly and at the end-according to the final title- they got married and became happpy.
Anyway the story went back and forth from his younger years when they are very famous and when Brian is aged and had a really serious mental problem when he met his love of his life.
Both period had it's own way of making the audience interesting.
Each time when The Beach Boys made new songs and record them, I cannot but to had my heart beating so fast. Joy and happiness mixed together.
It was not just showing them playing songs-both instrument part and singer part. They were conducted by Brian willson almost enthusiastic or even madly.
I first noticed PAUL DANO from the movie <THERE WILL BE BLOOD> directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. He was more then great. Then I saw <Little Miss Sunshine>. I started to be wondered when he will have the leading role. And now here we are.
He really rocked this time.
If I may, If I really have to choose between PAUL DANO and JOHN CUSAK, I will choose PAUL DANO.
I hope he will have more leading roll in the future.
Anyway, those of you even if you even heard a glimps of the name THE BEACH BOYS, will really enjoy this film for sure. I guarantee.

PS: It is surprising that after making his first feature back ins 1990, he only produced a bunch of movies and never directed till he finally made this film in 2014. That is a surprise. With so many talent, it was a waste of time.",1454371200,,2309,4.369767441860465

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

Bill Pohlad, the producer of such notable films as Brokeback Mountain and 12 Years a Slave, only directed one film in his life and that was back in 1990. So it's quite remarkable that his second effort, a biopic about Brian Wilson of Beach Boys fame, is so enjoyable and innovative. The film focuses on two different times in Wilson's lifejumping back and forth between his heyday when he created the landmark album ""Pet Sounds,"" and later in the late 80s and early 90s, after he was experiencing significant mental health issues and came under the spell of a Svengali-like therapist. The early Wilson is played brilliantly by Paul Dano who looks and sounds like the legendary singer-composer. Less successful is John Cusack in the role of the troubled older Wilson.

We first meet the younger Wilson after he experiences a panic attack on an airplane and soon is asking the rest of the Beach Boys if he could stay home and work on new songs while the boys go off touring in Japan. In a fascinating part of the film, Dano shows off his acting chops channeling an eccentric Wilson putting together Pet Sounds, an album (as we're reminded in the film) that Paul McCartney called ""the greatest rock album of all time.""

Troubled by voices in his head, Wilson manages to sublimate the cacophony and turn it into music on the new album. Christopher Gray writing in Slant Magazine cogently explains how Wilson accomplished this, aided by the film's composer: ""With a series of brilliantly composed sound collages containing snatches of harmony, studio banter, and kernels of hooks, composer Atticus Ross gives a tangible impression of the clutter in Wilson's mind blossoming into Pet Sounds, an album that's simultaneously elemental and maximalist, deconstructionist and rigorously composed.""

Pohlad provides a fascinating glimpse into how Wilson went about creating Pet Sounds, working with the ""Wrecking Crew,"" the famed straight-laced group of studio musicians who initially are befuddled by the eccentric Wilson but eventually warm up to him (one of the musicians tells Wilson that he enjoyed working with him on Pet Sounds above anyone else in his career). The use of real-life musicians -- and the scenes being shot in a documentary style utilizing hand-held 16-millimeter cameras -- adds to the film's verisimilitude.

The conflict in the scenes involving Wilson's creative period focuses on his father, Murry, winningly played by Bill Camp. We come to understand that a good deal of Wilson's problems are related to his overcritical father. In a startling scene, Wilson plays a solo piano version of one of his most acclaimed songs, ""God Only Knows."" At the end of the scene, the camera pans back revealing a critical Murry telling Wilson that the song is ""wishy-washy."" While it's clear Murry was a martinet, I still wanted to see the character fleshed out a bit more (the best the film's scenarists can do is show Murry awkwardly blurt out ""I love you"" to Wilson in an angry tone of voice). After his father's death from a heart attack in 1973, Brian praised his father for pushing the group to achieve.

Mike Love, Wilson's cousin and fellow Beach Boys member, acts as an additional foil in the Wilson heyday sequences. As he's depicted here, Love wanted Wilson to write simpler songs in the vein of the hits the group churned out in their ""surfer"" days. Like the father, Love was a character I wanted to know a little bit more about, although I can understand the screenwriters had limited time to tell their story.

The events involving Wilson in the 80s prove just as fascinating as his earlier incarnation. Wilson is propelled into a new depressive phase when he falls under the influence of Dr. Eugene Landy, the sociopathic therapist who controls virtually his every move. Paul Giamatti is mesmerizing as the over-the-top Svengali who controls the vulnerable Brian with a massive amount of medication. Pohlad claims that John Cusack does look like Brian at that time in his life, but even if this is true, Cusack's overall performance is clearly not as good as Dano's. It's hard to say what's wrong with Cusack hereperhaps he plays Wilson as a little too creepywhatever the case, Cusack just isn't quite right for the part (not terribly bad, but just not quite right!).

Also quite enjoyable is Elizabeth Banks playing Cadillac saleswoman Melinda Ledbetter, who eventually becomes Wilson's wife. It's a strong female part for various reasonsI liked how they come to meet each other for the first time (inside a showroom Cadillac) and her surprise when she finds out that this strange guy is actually THE Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. The best part is when she confronts Landy and eventually wrests control of Wilson from him. I'm informed that the actual mechanics of how Landy's grip over Wilson ended was part fiction (the maid did not have a hand in getting a hold of Wilson's altered will). Nonetheless a little dramatic license is forgivable.

Love & Mercy manages to be a cut above some biopics that have recently appeared on the silver screen. The combination of depicting Wilson's creative process in his heyday with the Beach Boys and his later struggles attempting to extricate himself from the influence of a vicious psychiatrist, proves fascinating. Brian Wilson of course had some critical collaborators in his musical career, and they've been given short shrift here. This is of course a biopic and placing the protagonist on a pedestal is expected. It's done a little less here, and for that we should be grateful.",1453852800,,5609,4.919661733615222

7322268,5,B01127XNEE,"Loved this movie.  I thought both actors did a great job portraying the younger and older Brian--it doesn't matter than John Cusack doesn't look like Brian--he had the mannerisms down and gave a good idea of the struggles Brian endured.  Elizabeth Banks was perfect for Melinda, who is definitely a strong woman and it made me wonder if she ever felt like she was being used for some strange part of his therapy--but she hung in there and helped to completely change his life (this reminded me of Johnny Cash and June Carter).  As for Brian's mental issues, I'm certainly not a doctor or psychologist, but the movie portrayed Brian as being an introvert forced to live an extrovert life--combine that w/whatever damage was done by his father (if he was hit hard enough to damage his hearing, what damage may have occured to his brain?), along w/a sensitive heart, and it's no wonder he had struggles...and of course, the drugs didn't help.  I thought the movie did a good job of showing how it felt when he had anxiety attacks (I'm assuming that's what they were). This isn't a fun, ""surf's up!"" kind of movie--it's deep and has parts that are hard to watch--but tells the story of someone who is a real musical genius and what his world is like.  I watched it twice--it was hard to understand some of the parts, so the second time I watched it w/the subtitles.  I've loved the Beach Boy's music since I was a kid, saw them in concert many times, and I really enjoyed this special look into Brian's life--it can give hope to anyone who's struggling in their life that there is always a chance for restoration.",1453593600,,1609,4.569444444444445

7322284,5,B01127XNEE,"I am a huge music fan and The Beach Boys are one of my all time favorite bands. When I heard that there was going to be a biopic about Brian Wilson, I was in like flint. After the seeing the trailers and a performance that I never would have excepted from John Cussak, Love & Mercy turned out to be one of the best films I had seen in 2015.

I had known about the trials and tribulations of Brian Wilson but, to finally see it in a story form it was such an engaging film. What stands out about this film is the fact that it is two separate stories being told. We see the Brian Wilson in the 1960s played beautiful by Paul Dano as Brian records one of the legendary albums in all of music. We also see Brian Wilson in the 1980s coping with his illness and how his doctor/guardian keeps him under his thumb and how he tries to fall in love again and rejoin the world that seems to have abandoned him. The film is filled with a lot of emotions and even some discomforting moments. The acting of the entire cast is so beautiful you can't look away and not appreciate a story about one of the most ingenious minds in all of music. How this film got completely snubbed at this year's Oscars makes no sense to me.

If you a film fan, a Beach Boys fan, a John Cussak fan or all 3 this is a movie that you will love and want to see many times after. I would personally hope that more music biopics are brought to the film going public soon because there are so many more stories to be told.",1453420800,6,1482,4.037414965986395

7322309,2,B01127XNEE,"Distressing movie attempts to sanctify the ""lost years"" of the emotionally turbulent Brian Wilson (known to most as the author of the song ""God Only Knows"") by turning him into a loveable sad sack manipulated by a maniacal and, uh, ""unsatisfied"" therapist who treats Wilson like an odious sack of dog stuff throughout the film. Sadly, though, this picture continues the ""let's just blame those around them"" attitude given by those who don't want to believe that ""artists"" should take responsibilities for their own actions (when clearly the opposite is the case). In any event, this picture arrives without humor, without irony, and with much respect for the fragile Wilson himself, and with two over-the-top performances by Paul Dano (who sort of looks like Wilson from a distance) and John Cusack (who doesn't look like Wilson either up close or from a thousand yards away). Cinematically, there is so little going on here, other than the hyper-pretentious use of the 16 mm Arri 16SR3 to add the 1960's ""flavor"" to the proceedings. But, overall, so much is missed here--opportunities for humor, opportunities for satire (this was the 1960's, guys), and mostly opportunities for the music, which although faithfully rendered in representation, is too dark and joyless as it focuses upon Wilson's ""poor me"" attitude that creates an atmosphere of dread and defeat during the rehearsal and recording scenes (as if making music were the equivalent of hoeing the farm fields or mining for oil in the southwest in the early days). Therefore, we come to think of the Beach Boys music as being full of Wilson's panic and anxiety (as he was feeling when he created the recordings) more so than the feeling of joy and breeziness that the music hitherto reminded us of. If you bleed all the joy out of your movie, you get the (usually baffled) Academy to give you an Oscar but the audiences won't be there for you in the future. Pohlad's film is a creatively strait-jacketed affair, as if Wilson himself were hovering over the production to see that it gets done right. Robert Yoeman's cinematography is rendered unremarkable here due to the positively depressing tone of the movie itself. I realize Wilson's mental state was fragile, but this movie is so afraid to take any chances that I think after awhile it becomes very easy to simply stop caring.

7322325,5,B01127XNEE,"Love and Mercy _ True story of genius songwriter, singer and arranger Brian Wilson, the leader of the Beach Boys, tries to compete album for album with the Beatles in the mid 1960's. After the Beatles do their magnum opus Revolver, Wilson takes too much LSD and speed etc and freaks out while trying to make his magnum opus ""SMiLE"". He is paranoid and schizophrenic.  At the height of his career he quits music in 1966 and becomes a crazed recluse.  A hyper controlling doctor gives him tons of Rx antipsychotic drugs trying to augment his paranoia and schizophrenia. He is a legendary recluse for 40 years. ""In the 1960s, Beach Boys leader Brian Wilson struggles with emerging psychosis as he attempts to craft his avant-garde pop masterpiece. In the 1980s, he is a broken, confused man under the 24-hour watch of shady therapist Dr. Eugene Landy"". Young Wilson is played Paul Dano, older Wilson 40 years later is played by John Cusack, beautiful Elizabeth Banks (with hot legs) plays the woman who believes his genius is still in there somewhere. Paul Giamatti  plays manipulative, self interested Landry.  Very very intense. I saw this movie four times. Brilliant great acting from all.  With great music. Until ""Bridge of Spies"" I thought this was the best movie of the year....it's still great.

Cusack, while not as much a physical match for Wilson in his later years, does a powerful job of portraying the songwriter finding his way out of the wilderness.

7322349,4,B01127XNEE,"4 1/2 stars: -- First of all, this movie is worth seeing for two very fine complementary performances, by Paul Dano as Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys at the age of 23 or so, and by John Cusack as Wilson about 25 years later. One has no trouble believing that Dano's Wilson could have grown up to be Cusack's.  If you like the Beach Boys music, you'll be fascinated by the story of how the ""Pet Sounds"" album got made, and the sound track will delight you, but even if you'renot a big fan, there's plenty of interest.  The two narratives -- let's call them the 1960's narrative and the 1980's narrative -- aren't offered simply in sequence.  They are intercut, with the effects of flashback and flash-forward thus being effectively combined, and since the movie is, to some extent about damage and its effects on a certain kind of temperament, the intercutting makes perfect sense in that it allows the audience to get answers of a kind to questions that inevitably arise, given what we see of Brian's earlier life.

What kind of temperament are we talking about?  Well, the artistic temperament, I suppose.  Brian is represented as a kind of genius, a kind of pop Mozart, whose specialness is acknowledged but whose strangeness is seen by some as a problem to be dealt with.  Since Brian is certainly odd but not violent or asocial, there's something troubling about the way that his father, Murry Wilson, in particular (Bill Camp) needs to keep him focused and directed in a way that Murry feels is appropriate but that eventually destroys Brian's confidence.  Some of Murry's means of control are violent, and his motives are perhaps a strange mix of resentment of his son's talent and fear that Brian will take his music group in a direction that is less profitable than the Beach Boys have been up to that point.  The director, Bill Pohlad, manages to suggest both Brian's discipline and perfectionism where sound is concerned and a kind of almost mystical inner consciousness that overtakes him at times.  Pohlad is careful not to overdo this or to try to simplify the relation between Brian's odd consciousness and the music he creates.  Paul Dano is able to suggest a character both sympathetic and yet oddly unreadable from the outside, and that seems just right as a representation of a kind of genius of communication whose source of power is strange and mysterious.  Brian's brothers in the group just let him get on with it and are willing to try whatever he comes up with.  More resistant is Mike Love (Jake Abel) who seems to share some of Brian's father's concerns and motives and who seeks to assert himself as a controlling force in the band's development.

Scenes from that part of Brian's life (1965-66?) are intercut with scenes from the late 1980's, where Brian is a mess -- the connecting link is perhaps the lack of confidence that has caused him to put himself in the care of Dr Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti), who supervises his medication and his life -- and who, like Brian's father, seems to think that money can be made from Brian's music, and so Landy has become a kind of manager in more ways than one.  Brian seems sporadically aware that he is being controlled and manipulated (he doesn't always take his meds) but doesn't know how to get out of the mess he's in.  Then, serendipitously, he meets Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) who works in a car dealership and whom he comes to trust and who in turn cottons on to how Brian is being controlled.  If it sounds as if the 1980's story is a fairly familiar one of a kind of redemption through love, then so it is -- but Cusack and Banks are so quirky and appealing, and Paul Giamatti is so credibly threatening as the doctor (a really fine performance), that our sympathies are engaged.

The movie makes clear, I think, that Brian's oddness isn't a sickness, but it is turned into one by those who would ""manage"" him.  Between the two narratives that we see, we learn that Brian used drugs as a way to handle his confusions, and of course, Landy has basically just made sure that by the time he's dealing with Brian he's taking drugs that will enable him to function to the degree that Landy needs.  The movie is, among other things, a plea for the tolerance of oddness -- and not all oddness is genius, of course, but much oddness is harmless too, if the odd person is appreciated or accepted or loved.  That sounds sentimental, but the lives we see and the acting that embodies them keeps it real.",1452038400,,4482,4.598494353826851

The young Brian Wilson actor is more captivating than John Cusack (who is one of my favorite actors) but you certainly feel for older Brian Wilson via Cusack's portrayal as he battles his way to brain health.  I appreciate that the movie was not hard to watch with regard to the drug use and the mental breakdown yet it still succinctly got the point across.

7322360,2,B01127XNEE,"After watching this, it's hard to believe that the movie has gotten the accolades it has received. Unless you already know the story and much of the details, this movie is an LSD trip in itself (confusing flashbacks included).

I'm a huge fan of the band and Brian Wilson, so I could easily follow what was going on. But for anyone who isn't, this is a great example of how to confuse the heck out of the audience. Cusak's excellent acting aside, the constant cutting back and forth between the past and future was disturbing and confusing. It;s probably the reason that they NEEDED two different people to play Brian Wilson...and that is not a compliment. Stilted dialog like the different Beach Boys greeting Brian after their return from Japan by saying ""Brother"" and ""Cousin"" were transparent vehicles and badly done. And other characters are not even introduced by name (Van Dyke Parks as one example). The beginning of the movie made me think that the disc was skipping scenes. Very disjoint.

Yes, this is the story of Brian Wilson and not a Beach Boys movie...but a bit more on explaining some of the problems with Murray early on, how Brian changed the band's control of their music would be important as well. It's in fashion to think of Brian as a troubled genius, but the presentation here leaves a LOT to be desired.",1451606400,,1329,4.6752136752136755

7322376,5,B01127XNEE,"I saw this movie in theaters when it first came out and loved it. Being a huge Brian Wilson fan and also a huge Beach Boys fan, this is a great movie for anyone of the sort. I really liked the special features section which included 2 featurettes on how John Cusack and Paul Dano played Brian and the other on the look of the film.",1451520000,,331,4.03030303030303
7322377,4,B01127XNEE,"We rented this blu-ray a few days ago and were very pleased with the movie and the quality of the blu-ray. The film looks and sounds so good that I do recommend getting the blu-ray to get the best experience possible.

This film is a lovingly made tribute to Beach Boys leader Brian Wilson. It does an excellent job of showing his musical genius (his ability to hear all the musical parts in his head), the many obstacles that lead to his breakdown (schizophrenia, addiction, abuse by his father, deafness in one ear, demands from the band and record company, etc.), and his long road to recovery. You don't have to know anything about Brian's life story or the Beach Boys' music to be able to follow along and enjoy the film but the more you do know, the more you can appreciate what has been included.

The film goes back and forth between 2 pivotal times in Brian's life: the mid to late 1960's when he was at the peak of his musical creativity but also about to have his breakdown, and the 1980's when he met his future wife who helped him break away from Dr. Landy and regain his life. The Brian that emerges is a very different Brian from the past, and the film shows this by having 2 different actors portray him. While Paul Dano does resemble a young Brian, John Cusack clearly does not resemble Brian nor Dano and I admit to being sceptical as to whether the film would work. I must say that both actors do an excellent job of capturing the essence of Brian very well. In fact, all of the principal actors do a great job.

Many people, myself included, find the 1960's story more exciting than the 1980's story and the idea to go back and forth works well because otherwise the latter part of the film would drag by comparison. The costume and set designs do a wonderful job of capturing and contrasting both eras.

As a music bio-pic, it holds up very well against other famous films like ""Walk the Line"", ""Ray"", etc. However, I do feel that the film is rather concise and I wish it was longer. Being concise means that certain characters (such as Paul Giamatti's portrayal of Dr. Eugene Landy) is necessarily one-sided.

For special features, the blu-ray includes ""some"" deleted scenes (there were more deleted scenes than are shown), as well as 2 fine documentaries on the making of the film. Again, I wish there was more. The fact that I wish there was more means I liked it enough to want more of it.

I'm glad that Brian Wilson is getting the recognition he deserves and that the film also shows the use of studio musicians by most American artists during the 1960's, again to give them the credit they deserve. If you enjoy this film and/or the Beach Boys' music, you should watch the ""Wrecking Crew"" blu-ray which recently came out and which tells the story of the studio musicians portrayed in the ""Love and Mercy"" film. That film will give you even more insight on how the Beach Boys' records, including Pet Sounds and Smile were recorded.",1451433600,,2958,4.488847583643123

7322379,4,B01127XNEE,"The acting was good by all parties and the music of course was great. I felt like the movie could've been better though. There was a lot of skipping around...there were conflicts with the band & then nothing more was said about it. Through the first half of the movie I thought the psychologist was one of his brothers. I also could've lived without the repetitive drug induced weirdness and jumping around in the younger days...we get it, they were doing a lot of drugs. There was a huge time gap between the band flashbacks and him being with the crazy Dr and it would've been good to see more of how he got from one to the other. Elizabeth Banks and Jon Cusack were the only things that pushed it above ""ok"" in my opinion. Interesting bc I didn't know the story but didn't leave me with a ""that was a good movie"" feeling. Maybe someone who already knows more of their history wouldn't have minded the gaps.",1451433600,,909,4.384615384615385

As far as a movie it's something great to watch if you're a music fan or even if you're not it is interesting and the story it tells will keep your attention. Originally I saw this with my girlfriend in theaters. I am a huge Beach Boys fan and knew the Brian Wilson story quite well while she had no idea of the history of the band or Brian Wilson, she was just a casual listener to some of their great songs! In my opinion although knowing the story and seeing similar documentaries this was presented very well and fresh enough to hold my attention and keep me focused. Acting was great, presentation was great. I have nothing too negative to say about the film other than small things that are not worth noting as they don't detract from the movie at all. My girlfriend went in not knowing much and came out asking questions and being so intrigued with the story. She's been obsessed with learning more about the band since we saw this and it certainly captivated her while watching. She was so focused on the movie she forgot to eat our popcorn! I recommend this film for everyone, and it's a different type of movie if you're looking to add something new to your movie night. I believe just about anyone from dedicated Beach Boys fans to people who know nothing about the band or story, will find this movie very good and interesting",1450742400,,1358,4.414342629482071

7322389,3,B01127XNEE,I could only make sense from this movie by having the director's commentary turned on and that over rode the regular dialog.  This movie is trying to picture the actual scenes as thru Brian Wilson's beautiful mind.  The movie is trying to portray the events in his life and is not meant for pure entertainment.  This is a truly sad life story that was never told to the public before.  So you will have to take it for what it is worth and intended for.,1450569600,,452,4.2823529411764705

The saving part was the music but I can play the music without having to sit though such a lousy script.  Maybe if it had been in chronological order or had less on Brian's mental problem, I would have liked it.

I'm guessing that's a sign of what kind of talent the guy has as his character in ""There Will Be Blood"" was completely loathsome.  I've been a fan of John Cusack for years and he does a great job of showing how fragile Brian Wilson was.  Paul Giamatti is particularly terrifying as the psychiatrist in the later years - you might be wondering how the hell could Paul Giamatti be terrifying?  Again, another sign of what good actor he is.  Gotta say, though:  Elizabeth Banks brought the movie together - world class.",1449187200,,622,4.5
7322441,1,B01127XNEE,"From many reviews, I expected this to be a wonderful movie.  Elizabeth Banks gives a great, nuanced performance.  John Cusack and Paul Giamatti come close to the Guinness Book record for overacting.  I'd rate Paul Dano's performance as fair.  The cinematography was amateurish and the editing made it worse. It looked like an introductory high school movie class project. On a technical note. the sound levels between music and dialogue were as far apart as on any DVD I've ever watched.

Dealing with a long and complex piece of a man's history, it touches only briefly on some major developments in the Band's evolution and problems.

By survive I really mean thrive and by 60s I exclude the  groups post the Beatles and the Stones. So this movie , i.e. film  for those in the audience who transplanted to Williamsburg ( Brooklyn )  and not actually born there, is about Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys. In many ways this movie is more revealing than ""Jersey Boys""-which codified the music and back story of the Four Seasons ( the Broadway show far more intimate than the movie, obviously). Brian Wilson is brilliant and gifted -how do you appreciate that in your youth ? You don't necessarily-you simply like the music. Was Cole Porter a genius to his contemporary  audience any more than Li Manuel Miranda is to his today?
I am not a fan of biographies because only a small handful are done as well as this one. It focuses on the soul of the person not the looks, quirks or image. John Cusack  is formidable and deserves a nomination for this performance. He portrays a man who is both gifted and tormented in a most understated but convincing way-loved it. The direction is crisp and does not fall prey to clichs or tempting maudlin overtures.
And then there is the music and the evolution of ""Smile "" and the history of ""Pet Sounds""-and the Wrecking Crew"" and the recording sessions-wish there as more.
What happened to Brian Wilson , as the Beach Boys kept performing, where was he? The notions that I had in my youth and until this movie were  unfortunately mostly stereotypical until now.

7322557,4,B01127XNEE,"Really enjoyable trip into the mind and heart of a rock legend. I have been haunted by this movie since watching it a few months ago, and it drove me to further explore the life and genius of Mr. Wilson. Mental illness is an utter tragedy which seems to hit hardest at the most creative and sensitive minds. I haven't been this moved by a story since watching The Soloist a few years ago. It's amazing to see how Mr. Wilson triumphed and struggled and sank so low, but was able to come back in spite of the unforgiveable exploitation and torture he endured in the name of ""help."" The movie alternated between cheery, upbeat good times and the depths of the lows. For those who remember the beach music of the 60s and the golden age of 70s rock music, this will be a satisfying trip down memory lane, juxtaposed against the tragedy of a descent into madness and the struggle to return.

What I saw was a boring, disjointed, jumble of depressing silliness, that was made almost worthwhile by the real Brian Wilson singing the title song at the end.  If I hadn't paid $4.99 for this awful flick I would have turned it off after the first 15 minutes.  That being said, I love the Beach Boys music, and it's too bad there's very little of it in this movie, so if you're looking for a Jersey Boys it ain't here.  Sad.",1448668800,,620,4.141666666666667
7322564,4,B01127XNEE,"Genius can be indistinguishable from insanity. From Isaac Newton to Steve Jobs to David Foster Wallace, those who lie at the farthest reaches of the logos transcend understanding. Any farther is a descent into madness. In telling the life story of the Beach Boy's Brian Wilson, ""Love & Mercy"" tries to examine the origins of descent, and redemption.

Directed by Bill Pohald, ""Love & Mercy"" effectively uses dual casting to tell Wilson's life story:  Past Brian (Paul Dano) during production of the group's seminal album ""Pet Sounds"" (1966) and Future Brian (John Cusack), some 20 years later, and a few years after Wilson's nadir. This mirrored structure shows Wilson as moving closer to, and away from, a singularity.

The Past Brian sequence, shot in documentary-style, is told through Wilson's perspective and focuses on the creative process, commenting on the relationship between creativity and madness, especially the nature of creativity, the origins of genius, and the causal relationship between creativity and madness. The core of this sequence is Dano working with a session band, the Wrecking Crew, producing the music for ""Pet Sounds"" and the #1 single, ""Good Vibrations."" Brian pushes himself and the band to outdo the Beatles, defending his unorthodox compositions by explaining, ""it works in my head."" The album ""Pet Sounds"" was in 1966 as challenging and perplexing as Radiohead's ""Kid A"" was in 2000, but came to be recognized as a masterwork. The consequence is that Past Brian pushes himself so far that he begins his descent.

Dano is wonderful as past Wilsongentle, humorous, talented, and a perfectionist, requiring dozens of takes from cello players to reproduce the sonic texture he hears in his head. For Wilson, music is tangiblehe's shown lying on the hood of a sedan, auditory melodies and rhythms overlapping in his mind like colored ribbons waving in the breeze. The movie posits a relationship between this gift and Wilson's fall; Future Wilson explains that he's heard voices since 1963. The more immersed Past Brian becomes in his own head, the closer to the edge he moves. Ultimately, Wilson becomes disjointed and paranoid, his nadir portrayed as him poolside, bloated and depressed, unable to muster the strength to see his newborn child smile for the first time.

The story of Future Brian, shot in 35mm and utilizing bright natural light, is seen through the eyes of Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks), who is a Cadillac dealer. At their first encounter, she does not know that he's Brian Wilson of Beach Boys fame, yet is attracted to this quirky, attractive man who is seeking help. Here, she also meets Wilson's therapist, Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti in a floppy wig and proto-Zubaz pants). Dr. Landy exerts full control over Wilson's life, at one point telling Ledbetter, ""I am a control."" Giamatti is terrifying as Dr. Meyer, giving the character an outward creepiness and internal simmer. Cusack brings a sweet, earnest quality to Future Brian that is aligned with Dano's performance, granting Future Brian the body language of a man who has just awakened from a long slumber, although this is perhaps the result of being overmedicated. But this sequence is as much Ledbetter's story as much as Wilson's. She loves and accepts Wilson for who he is, pushing him to take control of his life and drawing out his musical gifts.

The movie alludes to Wilson's years of social withdrawal, although it does not explicitly detail this period. The mirrored-image structure gives enough weight to the Past- and Future-Brian sequences that dwelling on the years Wilson spent bedridden are not be needed. Demonstrating Wilson's musical genius at its height gives extra gravitas to the Future Brian scenes and his efforts at exerting control of his life. A quibble is with the portrayal of Wilson's father, Murry (Bill Camp, underutilized). He appears every few minutes, makes incendiary statements, and disappears. The movie does not go into great depth about the relationship between Wilson and his father, other than Wilson explaining that he's deaf in one ear due to his father's beatings. Nor does it explicitly connect Murry with Dr. Meyer. However, in one bravura montage, Wilson takes stock of his entire life, including his relationships with Murry, Dr. Landy, his band mates and Melinda, with the result Wilson finding and asserting himself.

Through acting, editing, and cinematography, the casting of two actors in one role set 20 years apart allows a complete examination of a man's apex, fall, and redemption. As the end credits demonstrate, ""Love & Mercy"" is all we need.",1448668800,,4624,5.1165562913907285

7322606,5,B01127XNEE,"I am generally very skeptical whenever Hollywood churns out another formulaic music biopic.  I get sick of the same narrative arc over and over again: the band coming together, the ""aha"" moment when the magical first song comes together, the wild success, the substance abuse, the eventual death of a member/breakup, and the late-in-life redemption.  ""Love and Mercy"" is a refreshing break from this tired routine: the film chooses two points in the life of the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson, and narrates both of these points in parallel fashion.  The first moment revolves around the composition of the ""Pet Sounds"" album, and the second focuses on Brian Wilson's middle-aged struggles to live a normal life within the sheltered bubble that his bloodsucking doctor has constructed around him. The acting is fantastic at both moments in time: Paul Dano as the young Brian Wilson and John Cusack as the old.  The scenes in the studio when Brian Wilson is constructing the ""Pet Sounds"" album, in particular, are a fascinating and informative window into the mind of a genius.  The movie will appeal to Beach Boys fans and non-fans alike.  I especially recommend the film to those who don't know much about the band, those who only know them as lightheaded, 60's ""Boy Band.""",1448323200,2,1267,4.952830188679245

And though I have great respect and appreciation for John Cusack, I can't imagine why the hell the producers chose him to play the 1990s Brian Wilson. Bad, bad casting.

7322749,5,B01127XNEE,"This was a great movie, explaining the problems Brian Wilson had in his life, and how his girlfriend, who became his wife and is still with him, helped him become self-sufficient.  I lived a block from the Wilsons back in 1958 when I was 10 years old, several years before the Beach Boys began.  I don't remember meeting Brian, but I knew Carl, since he was close to my age, and I'm pretty sure I met Dennis.  I played touch football in their front yard, and I remembered personally how their father controlled them, before the first album came out.  I'd been in 5th grade class with David Marks, the only one I knew was becoming a musician at the time.  The movie shows the problems between Dennis and Mike Love, the Wilson's' Cousin, who I never met, and I wish they'd team up again like they did back in 2012.  But Brian has learned to help himself become normal along with his wife, which is explained in this movie, and it made me very happy.  In addition, it made me feel it was important to re-purchase all the old Beach Boys' albums, which were so important to me, going back before the Beatles came here.",1446249600,2,1113,4.37378640776699

7322773,4,B01127XNEE,"No question if you read enough stories about geniuses of all sorts from big-brained physicists like Newton and Einstein to big-be-bop musical guys like the Beach Boys Brian Wilson who was the de facto impresario of that group you will find so very troubling stories along the way. That is the case here as Wilsons tell all song from the 1980s when he was beginning to recover from his dark night got the nod as the title of the film, Love and Mercy. The film is a bit different from most biopics, especially of musicians since it concentrates, sometimes successfully at others in a confusing manner needing more detail, on two periods in Wilsons life- the 1960s heyday of his biggest successes and height of his creative energies and the 1980s when he was fighting aided by the woman who would be his future wife, Melinda Ledbetter, to control his demons within.

Admittedly I was not a Beach Boys fan as a kid, found their music well too dishy when I was in thrall to blues and protest folk songs at a time when my true love rock and roll had turned to vanilla but that notwithstanding watching the sections of this film where Wilson was going, haltingly at times, full blast at others  and using every sound under the sun that made sense and of the now famous wrecking crew of sessions musicians I got the musical genius part. Of course that was an age when a lot of people, a lot of musicians as well, got as caught up in the whole live fast, die young and make a good corpse syndrome as anybody else. Some went under to drugs like Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendricks and Jim Morrison, other faded after their moments in the sun, and still others like Wilson let their inner demons get the best of them.

The reasons those demons took command was never really explained, if such things can be explained except an overbearing father, less that sympathetic brothers and an overwhelming to create the greatest album ever took their toll. Then we get to see Wilson in the 1980s when he is frankly a basket case although the direct causes for that decline are not sketched out. What is sketched out very clearly is that his shrink, his mad man over-the-top shrink who seemed to have imbibed every hare-brained psychological theory from the 1960s and put it on top of a control freak persona, was the problem not the solution. Also sketched out very clearly was that a determined woman is a very hard thing to beat when the love game is in play as when his future wife Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) digs in her heels to break the shrinks spell over Wilson. I didn't come away from this film any more a fan of the Beach Boys but for his struggles against adversity I did become a fan of the musical genius Brian Wilson.
Watch this one.",1445990400,,2730,4.477911646586345
7322774,5,B01127XNEE,"This was a great bio pic that hit all the right notes.  It delved into the mad genius of The Beach Boys' songwriter, Brian Wilson, and used a neat plot trick of flashback and flash forward to highlight that spiraling down into mental breakdown, much of it the fault of Wilson's doctor.  It also provided some interesting insights into the dynamic of the group and the bitter father who helped blight Wilson's mind and soul.  Plus, the movie had the great and often underestimated music of the Boys.  A fine movie with tears at the end.  In short, it had everything a good story needs - a hero in a conflict against his own demons and a real villain. Oh, and a good love story as well.",1445990400,,684,4.354330708661418

But for a lot of the viewing public, it probably will be confusing, since this movie is all about the life of Brian Wilson and two different actors play him.  Paul Dano is the younger Brian (and he had to gain a lot of weight for the part  - he is very convincing and a superior actor).  John Cusack is the older Brian - he is always great in every part he plays - and the two actors look nothing alike. The film also jumps back and forth from the younger days to the older days, another confusing factor for the general audience. The other Beachboys are in the film, but always in the background.  I enjoyed the film, but would have liked the details to be ""fleshed out"" a little:  for instance, as a teenager I went to two Beachboys' concerts when they performed in Toronto (about two years apart), and I was so disappointed when they replaced Brian each time with Glen Campbell.  Brian was always my favorite.  But in the movie it looked like he had only backed out of one tour, instead of many.  Overall, though, I enjoyed this film.

7322938,4,B01127XNEE,"I missed seeing this movie in the theater, so I purchased the DVD. It is a good overview of the troubled life of The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson. The movie begins with a brief recreation of a mid-'60s&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pet-Sounds/dp/B008LA7RM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pet Sounds</a>&nbsp;recording session, with a young Brian Wilson (Paul Dano) at the recording console, then flashes forward to a scene in the mid-'80s at a Los Angeles Cadillac dealership, where the older Brian (John Cusack) meets Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks), a former model who now sells cars, and they are almost instantly attracted to each other. The movie then flashes back to The Beach Boys' '60s heyday, with a few historical film clips, and more recording sessions. We are also introduced to Brian's therapist, Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti), who was good for Brian in the early years of their relationship - he got Brian out of bed after three years, put him on a diet, and got him off of drugs for the most part - but later became a domineering control freak who micromanaged Brian's every move, and was quite abusive. In 1993, the Wilson family had Landy removed as Brian's guardian, and Landy lost his psychiatric license soon after.

The movie also shows Brian's tortured relationship with his late father, Murry (Bill Camp), his troubled interactions with the other Beach Boys, beginning with his 1964 nervous breakdown, and the relative failure of PET SOUNDS, which actually got to #10 on the charts, but sold less well than the band's previous works.

The film ends with Melinda guiding Brian away from Landy (they would eventually marry, in 1995) and then cuts to a clip of the real-life Brian Wilson, performing a live version of the film's title song, ""Love And Mercy."" Another Wilson composition, ""One Kind Of Love,"" from his album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Pier-Pressure/dp/B00NSOP6ZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Pier Pressure</a>, plays over the closing credits.

The Beach Boys' music is used liberally throughout the film. Paul Dano does a couple of numbers, but most of the songs are the original recordings and backing tracks. Atticus Ross does the incidental film score. Real-life Beach Boys recording engineer Mark Linett plays the late engineer Chuck Britz, who did most of the group's best '60s work.

Bonus features on the DVD include a commentary track from director/producer Bill Pohlad and co-writer/executive producer Oren Moverman; Spanish and English audio tracks and subtitles (some of the dialogue is so soft that I had to turn on the subtitles to understand what was being said), two mini-documentaries about the making of the film itself and the difficulties of chronicling the phases of Brian's life (the real-life Brian and Melinda, who consulted on the film, are interviewed - the real-life Melinda is a lot less attractive then Elizabeth Banks, I'm sorry to say); and four deleted scenes.

A little uneven, but overall a good job. Four stars.",1445126400,,3075,5.424686192468619

7323040,4,B01127XNEE,"The film deemphasizes Wilson's use of marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines and psychedelic drugs--drugs that can both mimic psychosis and hasten its onset.  No wonder a positive diagnosis was long in coming.  Initially, use of these drugs and, perhaps, the creative edge the emerging bipolar syndrome produces may have enhanced his Brian's innovation.  After all, many bipolars are productive, creative people, especially during their hypomanic episodes.  Later, of course, Brian's creative impulse started to fragment which might suggest paranoid schizophreniabuthe was also simultaneously taking lots of drugs.  So what is he, a drug addict, bipolar or schizophrenic?  Drug addiction is a given but paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar syndrome are NOT related conditions.  Bipolars wander in and out of normalcy and can be returned to entirely normal via various medical chemicals.  Schizophrenia--almost a cancer of the personality--is treatable but the individual is rarely returned to anything like normalcy.  It is far the more serious condition.

But Brain had one symptom suggestive of schizophrenia.  He heard ""voices"".  Closer examination of his ""voices"" indicate that they weren't voices in the schizophrenic sense.  They were sounds, even ""music"", and garbled, indecipherable word-like sounds.  This sounds neither like bipolar syndrome nor schizophrenia.  More likely this is the after effect of psychedelic drugs on an intensely musical mind.",1444694400,,1451,5.8428571428571425

John Cusack isn't quite as successful as late-stage Wilson - you still seem to think 'Look! It's John Cusack playing Brian Wilson!' At the same time, he seemed to work admirably hard at adopting Wilson's vocal inflections and spacey mannerisms. Paul Giamatti was great - of course - at depicting Wilson's monstrously unethical therapist.

7323073,3,B01127XNEE,"great music, sad story of a man collapsing under the weight of horrendous stress, drug abuse, and psychological difficulties possibly arising from same, as well as from parental abuse. some of my favorite actors doing solid work. I didn't know what the story was about when I checked it out from the library and so didn't know that the odd man buying a car in the story's beginning was supposed to be Brian Wilson. I didn't like the story presentation, and I wondered why a beautiful youngish female character would saddle herself with a person with so many obvious difficulties and I kept coming back to money. In real life, you just don't often see or hear about beautiful youngish blondes falling in love with mentally ill, middle age men. I have personal experience on this subject. Just about every time I leave my apartment I see people suffering from mental difficulties. I live in Santa Monica, use a mobility device and/or the bus, and there is a large homeless population here and many of them have obvious mental difficulties, either they're talking to themselves or yelling or walking too close to me or something else that makes them stand out. I myself have been targeted/harassed for many years for speaking out against the Iraq War and I suspect I now suffer from post traumatic stress disorder, I suffer with nightmares, cannot sleep unless I take sleeping pills (which don't work well), and have additional health problems. Based on my own experiences and my interpretation of my life so far, as well as the mentally ill behaviors I see when I leave my apartment, and how I see mentally ill people ignored and/or avoided by most citizens, as well as how I myself avoid them when they approach me in a threatening manner, I found it very difficult to believe that a youngish, beautiful woman would attach herself to a man with obvious mental difficulties in the way the film represents the characters' romance. The story doesn't raise the issue of what motivates the Elizabeth Banks' character but rather packages itself as a ""love conquers most"" story. But ignoring a story weakness or failing to explain a character's motivation doesn't make it go away for the audience. The Elizabeth Banks' character supposedly falls in love with a wealthy but emotionally/mentally unbalanced guy. Why? What about him appeals to her, specifically? The story shows her interest, but doesn't explain it, and that's a problem. John Cusack is one of my favorite actors, and he plays a sort of absentness perfectly, and that absentness is the character's dominant feature, along with his wealth, but the writer fails to show what it is about his absentness that appeals to Elizabeth Banks's character.  The acting is good, loved the music; I'm a huge Beach Boys fan. A lessor problem for me storywise: the film presents Brian Wilson as a genius and he may be, but Mr. Wilson took music classes/lessons, which the film doesn't show (wikipedia). The story suggests that he was a savant. From the little I think I know about Mr. Wilson, he was an extremely hardworking, talented young man who loved music but he did have some musical training, taking classes in high school and college. Obviously he took what he learned to the next level, but he got some help from teachers. Film doesn't show that, which is fine, it's not a documentary, but I think the filmmaker pushed the savant angle too hard, it was a big part of the story (showing him with sand under his piano under his feet in his home, interacting with the studio musicians, etc.), but I didn't find their presentation persuasive. I think, for me, that if they wanted to prove he was a savant, then his oddness needed to be shown as a child, but his youngest characterization is as a teen. I could've bought him as a teenage savant if I'd seen him as a pre-teen savant but we're given the teen character and he's already got the talent and hearing what others around him can't. That didn't work for me. Compare it to Star Wars: a New Hope. What if the first time we see Luke he already has his light saber and has mastered the force. Kinda leaves us out of experiencing a whole lot of the story with him, doesn't it. In Love & Mercy I wish I'd seen the Brian Wilson character discover, play with, and master his gifts, I think that would've been more reflective of real life. In this story, he comes to the party fully loaded which didn't allow me to bond with the character or care deeply what happened to him. He's supposed to be the emotional center of the story, but the writer didn't structure the story in such a way as to make that happen. To attach me the writer should've: (1) shown how the character came to understand music and master it; (2) shown the physical/psychological abuse he (and his brothers) suffered as a child at the hands of his father, and what role his mother played in failing to protect him and why she made the choices she did; (3) why the Elizabeth Banks' character fell in love with him. Tackling these 3 issues would've made the story much stronger and a richer emotional experience for the audience. I rate the film 2 and a half stars rounded up to 3 for beautiful music and great acting. Dinged 2 stars for subpar character motivation and poor story structure. P.S. Didn't mind that two different actors played Brian Wilson, thought that was interesting and that both actors did well.",1444435200,6,5377,4.665964172813488

I may be a bit prejudiced in this review because I am a big fan of this group's music.  The movie is worth viewing and bridges the gap between Brian's tumultuous early life and his later maturity which brought him back to reality.

7323214,5,B01127XNEE,"Great film for the Brian Fan, I recommend it. Loved the way that pre-Pet Sounds events are covered in the opening credits and the way the primary focus is on two pivotal creative periods of his life: Pet Sounds/Good Vibrations/Smile, and being freed from the exploitive Dr. Landy into a new era.
Anyone familiar with his life will recognize that events in Brian's life are compressed to make the story suitable for a 2 hr. movie, for instance his first LSD experience was depicted happening parallel with Pet Sounds but he actually tried it much earlier., or Murry's band ""The Sunrays"" also happened well before Pet Sounds. Poor Murry can't get all the credit for the Sunrays, as they had already been a band  called The Renegades.
Anyone interested in Brian's life should also read The Beach Boys and the California Myth by David Leaf; ""Smile: The Story of Brian Wilson's Lost Masterpiece"" by Dominic Priori; and ""Catch a Wave : The Rise, Fall, and Redemption of Brian Wilson by P.

7323251,4,B01127XNEE,"I don't think I've ever seen a biopic quite like LOVE & MERCY before, and I'm still processing what I've seen, to be honest. Focusing on two time periods in Brian Wilson's life, it explores the Beach Boys' heyday in the 1960's (with Paul Dano) and a low period in the 1980's (with John Cusack) during which he meets his second wife, Melinda (Elizabeth Banks), who helps him out of his precarious situation with Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti), a psychologist who is very controlling of his personal life. Unlike GET ON UP, the James Brown biopic from last year that followed a stream-of-consciousness approach to narrative structure, LOVE & MERCY is very linear. The two timelines do kind of fade into one another, but the end goal of Brian Wilson's rehabilitation is always front and center. The best aspect of the film is dual performance by Paul Dano and John Cusack as Brian Wilson. Although they each play him differently, due to the different circumstances in those periods of Brian Wilson's life, they still felt like the same person. Paul Dano gets the showier performance, but John Cusack still does excellent work as the heavily medicated Wilson of the 1980's. And, both of them accurately portray the loneliness and isolation that Wilson must have felt. The supporting cast do just as good, though. Paul Giamatti was suitably slimy as the Eugene Landy, the psychologist who takes advantage of Brian Wilson in his weak state, and Elizabeth Banks was very charming and grounded as Melinda Ledbetter, the woman who finally rescues Brian from the prison that his life became. From a technical standpoint, LOVE & MERCY is very competent, with occasional flashes of brilliance. One particularly memorable shot was a long take around a recording studio as Brian is instructing two cellists on the sound he wants them to make. There were also a couple similar shots in Brian's Malibu home (in the 1980's period). There was also a few sequences where the footage was degraded to look like it was recorded a long time ago, which I thought was creative. Then, there's the music. It's been a long time since I've actually listened to the Beach Boys, but it was refreshing to hear it. The score by Atticus Ross was also quite good, its sparseness capturing, again, the loneliness and isolation in Brian Wilson's head. If there's anything negative I have to say, it's that there are some sporadic pacing issues, but nothing so egregious as to make the film unwatchable. Besides, the ending was rather satisfying anyway. Overall, LOVE & MERCY was a uniquely structured psychological portrait in lieu of the typical biography, and it should be commended for that, in addition to the excellent performances and music. As to whether or not he was a genius or madman, I guess there's a little of both (but mostly genius, in my opinion).",1443916800,4,2825,4.850931677018633

7323254,5,B01127XNEE,"I was skeptical when I heard two actors were playing Brian Wilson.  Having now seen the film and how it's structured it's a terrific concept.  The film flashes back and forth in time with Paul Dano playing Wilson during his peak creative period and John Cusack playing him probably 25 years later while his psyche is fragile and his life is being dominated by Svengali like ""medical guardian"", the parasitic Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti).  It's a brilliant conceit that meets it's fruition when the two distinct Brians  compliment each other and meld into a single entity towards the film's heart wrenching conclusion.  I was fortunate to have seen Brian in concert three times including the masterful stage recreation of ""Pet Sounds"" in 2000 and I can say conclusively that both actors have channeled his essence in their performances most notably Cusack.  Cusack has Brian's ticks and mannerisms down pat but compromises none of the humanity in the process.  There are plenty of villains to go around aside from the aforementioned Landy.  You have Brian's vicious father Murry and his cousin, Mike Love, who in Machiavellian fashion wanted to wrest control of the Beach Boys going as far as kicking Brian out of the band during the notorious ""bed"" period.  The film's most prominent hero is Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) who sees sweetness and sensitivity in Brian and attempts to extricate him away from the controlling psychotherapist.  One of the film's other successes is how director Bill Pohlad establishes time and place.  The recreation of the ""Pet Sounds"" and the aborted ""Smile"" sessions is nothing short of jawdropping.  This is probably the best musical biography since ""The Buddy Holly Story"" in 1978.  Undeniably the best picture I've seen this year and probably some other years.",1443916800,2,1801,5.085034013605442

The music is great, of course, but it's made astounding by the many scenes of Brian working with musicians in the studio. He comes across as a troubled genius, with good reason. In the end it's kind of a feel-good movie although his life was pretty dark most of the time. Deeply moving and recommended for a wide audience--nothing raunchy or questionable for those looking for a thoughtful movie that treats substance use with skepticism and is the best movie about mental illness since Silver Linings Playbook.

The history of Brian's life as told through this movie, and the effort he put forth into the Beach Boys, along with outside factors and stressors all contributed to his developing schizophrenia, which you will see as you watch the film.

Actually I when Brian Wilson was laying in bed in deep depression I had a difficult time watching John Cusack without thinking of another genius that had similar issues to Brian.  I think John Cusack would be perfect in a movie bio on Peter Sellers.  I think there could be Oscar hopes in that pairing.

7323290,5,B01127XNEE,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Over the years much has been written about Brian Wilson, the driving creative force behind the Beach Boys. In each and every one of those items concerning Wilson the two things most discussed are the abusiveness of his father and the controlling atmosphere created by his psychiatrist Eugene Landy. There is no way to talk about Wilsons life without discussing those two facets of his life, but there was much more to the man, a creative energy that brought about some of the most astounding music ever heard.

One thing that rarely gets mentioned is the fact that when the Beach Boys were at their peak they were the premiere American band at the time. Looking at the top 100 charts from the early 60s they were dominated by what was called the British Invasion, led by the popularity of the Beatles. While there were a few American bands around at the time, only the Beach Boys would rival them on the charts.

LOVE & MERCY takes a look at the life and times of Brian Wilson in a different way. It does discuss the two topics mentioned, no bio pic could avoid those, but it takes a look at his creative side as well and what brought it about. Rather than follow a linear path beginning at one point and taking it through to the end, the movie jumps back and forth in time. It focuses on what was perhaps the most daunting task Wilson faced in his career and ends with where he is at today.

At the top of the charts, selling out records and concerts alike, Brian (Paul Dano) finds himself needing to take a break from the road. Having recently fired Wilsons father from his management position (three members of the band were sons of Murry Wilson: Carl, Dennis and Brian), Brian wants to let his creative juices flow. The band agrees to his demand and goes on tour of Tokyo with a replacement.

Left alone, Brian begins working on Pet Sounds, an album that didn't perform as well as the bands previous efforts but now considered one of the greatest albums of all times and noted by the Beatles as an influence on their Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band LP. Spending most of his time in the studio Brian brings together the top studio musicians of the time, a group given the nickname the Wrecking Crew. Having played on nearly every top album of the time the musicians have a respect for Brian, recognizing his abilities and understanding of music.

Undiagnosed at the time Brian suffered from a mental disorder known as paracusia or auditory hallucinations. The sounds he heard running through his brain were what he tried to bring out in the LP he was working on. Using everything from animal sounds to tympani to strings, Brian Wilson combined these sounds to make a groundbreaking record unlike any heard before and certifying himself in the pantheon of music as a genius. But in doing so it took a toll on his mental health.

The band was unhappy with the results he brought to them. They couldn't find a hit among the songs hed recorded. They felt he was just making something for himself and not that they could wrap themselves around or perform. Couple that with the drugs Wilson began taking and the mental issues he had and something was bound to break. Unfortunately it was his mind. The movie allows us to witness the slow disintegration of his mind, using more of an aural display than a visual one to do so. The movie is filled with sound and everything but the dialogue seems to be high in volume, perhaps allowing us to relate to what Wilson was going through, what we are watching.

As I said, the movie jumps back and forth in time, taking us to more recent years after Wilson suffered his nervous breakdown and was put in the care of Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). Landy was able to bring Wilson out of a 3 year stint where he lived in his bed but at the same time took so much control over his life that Wilson could do nothing without his approval. Wilson (now played by John Cusack) meets a car saleswoman named Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) and the two fall in love. The only thing standing in their way is Landy who realizes that in allowing Wilson to have someone close to him means losing control, not just of Wilson but of his wealth as well.

The back and forth could be confusing if not for the well crafted script and directing on display here. Its obvious that director Bill Pohland has a love for the man and his music in the reverence that he treats his subject. The same hold true for both actors portraying Wilson. Dano is amazing to watch not only in the way he looks like Wilson but hes able to capture his sound while singing as well. The mannerisms that many of us know from various footage of him in the past are captured by Dano as well as he takes on bringing Wilson to life without making him a caricature at the same time. Cusack gives us a different look at the same man, choosing not to take on the look but displaying his acting chops by showing a man tormented yet in need of direction at the same time.

In the end youll find yourself with a better understanding of Brian Wilson when the film ends. Youll also find yourself digging through your music collection in search of those old Beach Boys albums/CDs to listen to once again. The movie does both the band and Brian Wilson well here and is one to enjoy on several levels.",1443484800,,5345,4.450459652706844
7323291,5,B01127XNEE,"Surprisingly a great film, grew up in grunge era and had only heard the hits and Pet Sounds.

7323299,5,B01127XNEE,"""Love And Mercy"" (2014)
Directed by Bill Pohlad
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a brilliant, complicated film which clicks on every level.  The script, the acting, the cinematography and (especially) the sound design are all of the highest calibre... The nuances of the storytelling combined with the intentionality of the filmcraft creates a spell-like atmosphere, as the director pulls us into the world of Brian Wilson, the gifted, fragile genius who sculpted the classic pop sound of the Beach Boys.

Wilson is portrayed at two pivotal moments in his life -- by actor Paul Dano as Wilson in the mid-1960s, when he had quit touring and hunkered down at the Capitol studios to create his masterpiece, the 1966 ""Pet Sounds"" album, and by the ever-dreamy John Cusack, who presents the psychologically tortured, spiritually broken Brian Wilson of the 1980s, a long-retired recluse who is dominated by a shady, unorthodox psychiatrist who runs Wilson's life as if he were his own, personal, one-man cult.  Both Dano's performance and Cusack's are excellent, although Cusack is truly stunning in this role. He is matched in emotional depth and multi-layered subtlety by co-star Elizabeth Banks, who plays the warm, empathic, strong, confident woman who rescues Wilson from the abyss. Plus, you've got the always amazing Paul Giamati playing the heavy (Brian's shrink) and with a cast like that, this is a film to be reckoned with.

In addition to the romance and psychodrama of the plot, the film delves deep into the creative process that made Brian Wilson one of the central figures in 1960s pop music, while at the same time exploring the mental quirks that gave him his genius but made his life a mess. The scenes that re-create the ""Pet Sounds"" sessions are electrifying and elating: I could have watch another half hour of that footage, easily, not just because it's the stuff of pop culture legend, but also because it rings so true onscreen. This is what creativity and collaboration at the highest level looks like.

""Love And Mercy"" is a beautiful and heartbreaking story of love and redemption, a meticulously crafted gem and a well-deserved love letter to one of the greatest rock-pop musicians of all time. It's a really great film.  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Film Reviews)",1443484800,,2341,5.196286472148541

7323320,5,B01127XNEE,"The story centers on Brian Wilson (John Cusack/ Paul Dano) and his mental psychosis in two subplots; one in the 1980's and another in the 1960's after the group is famous.  Brian had mental problems which seemed to be set around his relationship with his father (Bill Camp) and made worse by drug use. He can't travel and stays at home writing the definitive American album. After the Beatles left the stage and changed rock and roll by going to complex pieces involving studio musicians, Brian wanted to follow. His work while critically acclaimed, never sold as well as his beach music. In the 1980's he meets car saleswoman Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth banks) who recognizes that Gene Landy (Paul Giamatti), Brian's legal guardian, may not have Brian's best care at heart.

If you are looking for a Beach Boys story, this isn't it. There are odd scenes which are used to imitate Brian's confused brain. In one scene I thought I was watching the monolith hotel room scene (2001....)

It would take a 4 season mini-series to properly cover the story in detail, so this two hours' worth had to bypass much of it.  But everyone I have spoken to who has seen this film has confessed to being brought to tears.  That Brian Wilson is even alive today - even if he is slightly damaged - is a miracle given the abuse he suffered at the hands of his father and later his psychiatrist.  Watching the trailers prior to the film's release, I was stunned by the physical likeness of actor Paul Dano to a young Brian.  And I like many, had some reservations about John Cusak playing the older Brian.  But the highlight of this film is Cusak's performance which guarantees him an Oscar nomination.  There is a scene where ""Brian"" (Cusak) is walking down the street by himself. Cusak's posture and the way he holds his hands to his sides was so chillingly like the real Brian that I burst into tears.  You completely forget the total facial dissimilarity of the actor to the real person by virtue of the performance.

That said, it presented a unique perspective of Brian Wilson and his struggles with mental illness.  His misdiagnosis, his dependence and trust in others around him, and eventually, his breakaway and liberation from his disease and from those who were attempting to control and take advantage of him through his disease are addressed in this movie.

7323481,4,B01127XNEE,"This is a great film for anyone interested in Brian Wilson, whether you are a fan or not. It is very specifically focused on two eras in Wilson's life: mid-60s Pet Sounds/Smile (portrayed by Paul Dano), and late-80s Landy/first solo album (portrayed by John Cusack). The two time periods do not ever co-exist within the film except for one interpretation-hallucination scene towards the end. It is historically accurate from biographical accounts but it is presented in a way that you kind of get an idea of what Brian was feeling, seeing, hearing. It does jump back and forth between the two periods semi-frequently, and I have read this has caused some confusion amongst some viewers. Personally, I was able to follow along quite easily because I knew Brian's story before seeing this film. But even for someone not familiar with him, a viewer can pretty easily tell which time period is being portrayed simply by styles and sets (the 60s was vastly different looking from the 80s).

The only few, small things I have negative to say about the film are how they portrayed Murray Wilson (Brian's father), and some of the timelines aren't exactly right - but close enough to get the point across.

Murray Wilson is seen in the film as a very stern and abusive father, still very irked from The Beach Boys firing him as their manager and expanding their musical influences. While that really happened, I felt most of his character (based on the many biographies I've read) was over the top. Murray was a very competitive person, and he tried to make his sons competitive too (thus creating The Sunrays to compete with The Beach Boys' squeaky clean formula of the early 60s), but he was never vengeful towards them. They also feature a scene in which it is interpreted very easily by the viewer that Brian's deafness in an ear was caused by child abuse/slap from his father at a young age. While that has been speculated a few times by some biographies, it's never really been a proven fact. He could have just as easily injured himself, or maybe even had a physical problem that caused it. In summary, I think the character of Murray in the film doesn't show any love, and that just wasn't true of him - no matter how stern he really was or wasn't.

Timelines: Some of the timelines kind of break historical records, and I am sure this is for the purposes of dramatizing the film. For example, they suggest Brian started work on Good Vibrations as a direct response to the critical flop of Pet Sounds. In fact, Good Vibrations was being worked on as the album was being put together, and as Brian himself has mentioned before, was actually meant for release as part of Pet Sounds. But with the record company pushing the release of new (overdue) material and Brian not yet satisfied with the pieces of Good Vibrations, it got left off the album. They released it as a desperation single in advance of Smile to try and bring The Beach Boys back onto the charts once more - and that it did...their #1 best selling single ever.

Other than those few things, I think the film is a great watch and artistic vision of one of the greatest musical composer's life we will ever see. Watch it, buy it, enjoy it!",1442966400,5,3200,4.608771929824561
7323482,2,B01127XNEE,A little disjointed and boring.,1442966400,,31,5.4
7323483,5,B01127XNEE,"Just as the title implies, Love & Mercy does entirely encapsulate what Brian Wilson, the undeniable genius engine behind The Beach Boys, is all about. He uncompromisingly loves and cares about everything 'family'. He always has. We see him traveling through three significant decades of his life, the 1960's, 1970's and 1980's. Done in a nonlinear style, director Bill Pohlad may have intended to present a myriad of fragments within Brian Wilson's mind and his life to encompass the whole of this most captivating story. While using a precisely written screenplay by Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner, the almost unbelievable life of Brian Wilson begins to crescendo intensely from the screen. This story could begin in any decade as the scene chosen is the younger Brian softly speaking aloud to himself, then lying in a huge wooden bed during the 1970's then onto the 1980's. We then go back and forth to Paul Dano's young Brian of the '60's bringing the harmony of the Beach Boys into view as they ride the wave of popularity in American culture.

The viewing audience is immediately drawn to the trademark harmonies of so many songs they will easily recall from those early, more carefree days in just an instant from an equally first-rate soundtrack by Atticus Ross. Ross also crafts and brings to life what Brian hears within his own mind which neither any other nor even he can understand. He and his brothers live with their father's harsh punishments as youngsters; in particular, the weight of it all is on Brian to produce. Murry is a tough taskmaster of his sons and does not ""spare the rod"". Brian lived his entire life for his father's approval and Murry knows when to direct it onto hurtfulness toward his eldest son, but a caring Brian always feels love but also hurt for his father. Fear and panic begin to fill Brian and he feels he cannot go on touring. He feels that the studio is now his home while he begins to hear voices and fragments right in front of the band.

I couldn't find fault with any part of the styling of the movie and was brought to soaring highs and cringe-worthy lows as I identified with Brian and his urgency to bring joy to the world through perfection. The character of Brian Wilson is one of a humble and gracious man who only wishes to give to others and he possesses the means with the music that fills, and then invades, his mind as he says over and over, ""I have to get this out"". We hear what Brian hears and question how he can get through the voices he is hearing to get to what is the fullness of just one title. I was mesmerized by his ability to use the top studio musicians to work through each and every note in detail and also learned that all of the recording scenes were done in the actual studio where ""Pet Sounds"" was created from fragments of sounds within him while utilizing the talents of ""The Wrecking Crew"". Surprisingly, Dano sings in falsetto just as Wilson does and they sound similar when the younger Brian is commanding their sessions or writing his music on the piano.

The younger Brian Wilson was beautifully juxtaposed with John Cusack as the older in the 1980's under the domineering control of his Psychoanalyst, Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti). He displays an overblown ego but mainly gripping control over a paranoid and frightened Wilson. He had entered his life somewhere during the '70's to get a severely ill and overweight Brian out of bed where he languished close to three years and returned him back into life. He becomes frighteningly overboard and takes over Brian's will and character by overmedicating him and becoming his legal guardian. Landy is now in total control over a convoluted Wilson, he exclaims that he is ""The Control"" and certainly fulfills the role. The movie throughout is a brilliant dichotomy of Wilson's fracturing mentality during the early years and coming back to a much more lucid life in the latter years with the help of his blossoming love for Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) of whom Brian later exclaims he owes his life to. Melinda has a love for Brian and an unrelenting persistence to never leave him while aiding him to spread his wings again. With Melinda by his side, Brian finds his place in his own life once more. This is a love story on many levels; Love & Mercy shows more than spirit, freedom and an unwavering goal of releasing Brian of his mentally challenged and shackled life, but also a purely spiritual experience for Brian Wilson who explains that ""Music is the Language of God"". An extremely accomplished film born in respect and grown solid in love... this through the love of Melinda Ledbetter Wilson, his many fans and glorious Music Itself...

This is  just a basic outline of this film. It contains so much more detail in every regard concerning many, many relationships, music onstage and in the process of being constructed, his brothers, his abusive father, illness, conflict, love, control in the form of an almost total isolation and so much more.  A completely fulfilling movie to view and a humbling human story which is a definite 'don't miss'. While Murry Wilson said to his young son Brian: ""Nobody will even remember 'The Beach Boys'""... Well, you be the judge...",1442966400,41,5229,4.715536105032823

And even knowing their history, the time cuts  do not list the actual chronological time (like July 1966 or Jan 1983 as examples) so that makes it even more confusing. They do a poor job depicting Brian before he got involved with Dr Landy - he was actually a drugged out basket case. Landy then becomes a one-note controlling bastard in the film. All the Beach Boys were then suing each other - a tremendously dysfunctional group of performers/brothers. I think the movie tried to show what happened with Brian from pre-1970 to late 70s/early 80s - but how would you know with no dates given? In my opinion the film should have provided more background on what was happening with the Beach Boys as a whole/group so we (the viewer) could put Brian's illness in context. Without that, the film is confusing and at best and rates an  ""Average"" grade. To be candid, I saw the Beach Boys perform in 1966 and 1974 (nostalgic act even then) and read several books about them.

7323493,5,B01127XNEE,"I absolutely loved this film. I went in knowing a little about the ""treatment"" Brian Wilson received at the hands of Dr. Landy.  As it was occuring, Rolling Stone magazine had written about it a number of times.  However, I had no idea of the extent, isolation and duration of that treatment.  I have such a vivid memory of the Beach Boys being interviewed backstage at Live Aid.  Although Brian physically looked better than he had done in years, he had trouble forming sentences and seemed incapable of articulating a thought.  Carl had to keep jumping in with, ""what Brian means...""  It was just heartbreaking to watch.

Many important events are carefully inserted into this film - overbearing and abusive Murray Wilson; Brian's first marriage and children; and of course, Brian's descent into major depression.  What I loved most though, were the depictions of the ways Brian created his music - how it almost burst fully-realized from his brain.  The scenes of Brian (the excellent Paul Dano) working with the Wrecking Crew were standouts, and lovingly re-created.  The scenes with all Beach Boys doing the vocal tracks for Good Vibrations left me smiling from ear to ear.  Their joy in singing and blending their voices was so palpable.

Wow - Paul Dano was just tremendous as pre-Landy Brian.  He even sang some of the solo parts as well, managing to capture the range and innocence of Brian's voice.  John Cusack, as usual, doesn't disappoint, and brings waves of pathos to his portrayal of post-Landy Brian.  The viewer cannot fail to feel his suffering, disorientation and isolation. The other actors (including Paul Giamatti as Landy and Elizabeth Banks as Brian's soon-to-be second wife) are all great, but this is Paul Dano's and John Cusack's movie all the way.

You know, in the early 80's if you had told me that Brian would be the last-surviving Wilson brother, I would have said you were nuts.  In fact, especially after seeing that Live Aid interview, I would not have been surprised to read of Brian's passing in the weeks/months after that concert.  This was a man barely hanging on.  Love and Mercy depicts the descent and re-emergence of a true American genius with respect, care, love and a lot of great music.

At the end of the movie, as the credits begin, we are treated to the sight of Brian now, singing Love and Mercy live in concert.  That moved me to tears - of sadness for what he went through, but mostly of happiness because we still have him!",1442793600,7,2479,4.758782201405152

7323503,5,B01127XNEE,"Having researched a fair amount about Brian Wilson, there wasn't much out there that was going to surprise me.  Yet that didn't get in the way of enjoying this films incredible authenticity and appreciating the effort the producers, directors and cast went through to portray Brians story accurately.  And because Id seen the film three times in the theater, the best part of this Blu-Ray/DVD for me is the featurette A-Side/B-Side: Portraying the Life of Brian Wilson.  This ~20-minute segment goes beyond the basics, showing the incredible efforts the producers and directors made to accurately reflect the eras portrayed in the film -  and why it actually helped to have two distinct actors portraying Brian Wilson (because he basically was two distinct people during those periods).  Its an enlightening piece, with footage of the early Beach Boys and Wrecking Crew Id yet to discover.  From the use of the exact studio where Pet Sounds was (mostly) recorded, to (Brians long-time band member and musical secretary) Darian Sahanajas efforts to educate the actors on The Beach Boys mannerisms and harmonies, as well as Darians insistence to bring in outstanding session musicians to recreate the Pet Sounds music (much like Brian Wilson did himself, 50 years ago).  The people they brought in to accurately convey his story were the ones that lived part (or all) of it themselves - including long-time Brian Wilson engineer/producer Mark Linett, and, of course, Brian and Melinda Wilson.

The featurette and the film deliver the passion that is necessary to do justice to Americas most influential musician over the last 50 years.  If you love music, and/or the human spirit at its best, give this a look and listen  you will surely appreciate it.",1442620800,21,1750,5.066202090592334

He just can't pull off the older version of Brian Wilson. It is worth watching once but the movie is too depressing to own. Talk about a dysfunctional family.

7323525,4,B01127XNEE,"Overall, it's a good film.  Fans of Brian Wilson, and the Beach Boys, will enjoy the music.

John Cusack is a fine actor, but somehow was a bit unconvincing as Brian Wilson. I wish they had cast someone who more closely matched Wilson's physical appearance, but Cusack did a nice job portraying Wilson's complicated personality.

Elizabeth Banks is beautiful and gives a good performance.

Of the two Pauls in the film, Giamatti portraying Eugene Landy was definitely the better one.  Paul Dano was just okay as the younger Brian Wilson, but Giamatti was hauntingly brilliant in his portrayal of the lecherous, Svengali/psychotherapist.

The story moves along nicely, switching between the 1960s, the early days of the Beach Boys successes, and the 1980s, when Brian met future wife Melinda Ledbetter. The film touches upon Wilson's relationship with her, his father, his band mates, and Landy.  There's also a cinematic peek into Wilson's psyche, his drug experimentation, his isolation, and ultimate breakdown and eventual recovery.

If you're a fan of the Beach Boys, or of Brian Wilson, you will enjoy this movie.",1442448000,,1117,5.166666666666667
7323526,4,B01127XNEE,"This was actually a nice movie because it is no secret that Brian Wilson is alive, so when you see all the pain and suffering that was inflicted on him, you can take heart in the fact that he did survive.  It might not deserve 4 stars because it seemed to be written to make certain people look good and other people look bad.  The people who were made to look bad pretty much deserved it, so that isn't a problem, it was just that perhaps the integrity of the movie itself suffered to some extent.  But where the movie excelled was the way it kind of weaved the beauty and genius of Wilson's music in and out of the pains and joys of his upbringing and success.",1442448000,,662,4.15625

And clearly Brian and wife have their hands all over this production. the primary theme is that his wife almost singlehandedly saved him from Landy. While much of that may be true, from almost all biographical accounts other than this one, The Beach Boys and other family and friends were heavily involved re Landy on both ends of his hiring and firing. And yes, Brian WAS a genius. But, the film tires to say that his father and the band drove him to madness. Truth is that it was primarily heave drug use. Which the film omits almost entirely. A lot of people had gone through far more difficult lives than Brian Wilson and come out better for it, certainly not diminished like Brian. Despite the spin of the film, if BW does not indulge in heavy drug use for long periods (before Landy) he does not end up like he did.

  Paul Dano was great as the younger Brian.  He looked and sounded, and acted a lot like Brian circa 1967.  My only problem with the film was John Cusack as the older Brian.  The producers probably could have cast just about anyone EXCEPT John Cusack to pull off this role.  He was just---John Cusack. Didn't do anything to make himself eve look like Brian, except put on a baggy shirt.  Didn't even lighten his hair!  And how about at least trying to fake the palsy-like droop that afflicts Brian's mouth?  It is part of his look AND his speech.  Very disappointing.

7323588,5,B01127XNEE,"""I've got different stuff inside me and I've got to get it out."" Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys are a international phenomenon. Popular with critics and audiences alike they have everything they ever wanted. When Brian (Dano) begins to try and branch out to a different sound he is met with resistance and slowly descends into madness. Now as an adult Brian (Cusack) has found a new love, but once again meets resistance, this time in trying to cure his mental state. I was looking forward to watching this for awhile. I love music and my favorite type of movie are true stories. I like the Beach Boys but am not a huge fan. That said, this made me want to listen to more of their music, this time with the background of what occurred. Paul Dano does a great job and Cusack is the perfect choice as well. I do think that Paul Giamatti is the one that steals this movie and he is excellent in this as always. The movie itself is very interesting and entertaining. It is set up like the Godfather 2. Two people play the same person, one on the way down and one on the way up. The juxtaposition of the two stories works great in this and even though I was excited about this movie it was still better than I expected. Overall, not just one of the better bio-pics of the last few years, this is one of the better movies as well. I give this an A.",1442188800,29,1343,4.229571984435798

Elizabeth Banks is sexy and convincing.  Paul Dano does a good job.

7323603,4,B01127XNEE,"A beautiful, artful film, Love and Mercy is an inside look at Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys' composition of their groundbreaking album, Pet Sounds.  Originally panned for the album's arty, ethereal, orchestral sound and missing California-beach ""formula,"" the album is now regarded as one of the most important in music history.

John Cusack, as the older Brian Wilson, certainly delivers here with a quiet, tender performance-- probably one of the best of his career.  And, Paul Dano, as the younger Brian Wilson, gives an equally stunning performance and captures young Wilson's demeanor and appearance uncannily.

The film is deftly pieced together with the younger and older Wilson story lines weaved through the film carefully.  Production design, hair,  and costumes, especially for the 60's Beach Boys is incredibly realistic.  The striking reincarnation of those early, intense recording sessions where faith in Wilson's new sound waned, feel real and intimate.  There's a wonderful use of long takes in the film-- a dying technique-- which showcases the careful control the director has of his film.  There's a spectacular moment during the depiction of recording the Boys' biggest hit ""Good Vibrations"" with a 360 degree, slow camera pan.  It's a delightful moment and parallels the fun and energy of that hit single.

Director Bill Pohlad highlights the Beach Boys' songs in this movie brilliantly.  The audience gets to see the birth of song ideas and the struggle for craftsmen like Brian Wilson attempting to compose the music.

Unfortunately, Brian Wilson suffered from mental disorders and it's depressing to watch his decline.  Drug use in the film is a bit unsettling as well.  Wilson's tyrannical ""doctor,"" who administered care (and meds) to Wilson, is a frightening figure and Wilson's demanding, displeased father is never a welcome sight.

Despite the darker moments in the film, it's still an incredible work.  It's as if Pohlad successfully brought the unique soundscape of the Pet Sounds album to life.  This film is the visual accompaniment to one of the greatest albums in history.

My hope??  Some Golden Globe and Oscar buzz will start for everything, everyone.  Director, Film, Actor, Actress, Production Design-- all of it.

*Kid Factor:  Drug use (marijuana smoking twice) and someone gives Brian a piece of paper we can assume is acid, so he goes to la la land for a few minutes.  Wilson's doctor is frightening at times.  He yells and uses profanity.  Wilson's mental illness is slightly disturbing in about three moments in the film.  Wilson's girlfriend's bare back is seen for just a second, nothing more.  Movie not suggested for under 10.",1442102400,6,2680,5.169767441860465

I am a huge fan of Paul Giamatti - but I did not care for him cast in this part as Landy ... he's too old to be wearing what certainly was a wig to make him look much younger.

7323610,5,B01127XNEE,"I am very biased when it comes to the Beach Boys.  I discovered their music when I was very young and went to see them in concert when I was 10 years old as the first concert I really wanted to attend.  It happened to be at a venue with a hotel attached and the next morning I was up very early and went down to play Pac-Man before my parents woke up.  It was a sit-down machine that had controls on both sides and a guy came up and asked if he could play, he put down a bunch of quarters and I looked up and noticed it was Bruce Johnston, the guy that replaced Brian.  After a bit some of the other guys came to get Bruce and asked how I liked the show.  I was totally in awe.

While I have never had a chance to meet Brian Wilson his music has always had an impact on my life.  I loved the good-times songs but I also loved the Pet Sounds sound just as much as I loved the Beatles from an early age.  I had read about Brian's breakdown and bits and pieces of the story on his climb out of depression into a situation that might have been even worse with Dr. Euguene Landy controlling his life and over-medicating him.

This movie covers the dark, trying times of Brian Wilson interweaving two periods of his life together with excellent results.  Paul Dano gives an incredible look into the young Brian and John Cusak exceeded my expectations as the older Brian.  You get to see scenes of Brian in the recording studio that are nothing short of breathtaking as you get an idea of what his process was of getting the music out of his head and onto magnetic tape.

The story presented, I believe, does an excellent job of portraying Brian's descent into his mental issues as a young man without going over the top.  Some people may find a lot of the movie hard to watch as so much of the Beach Boys music is about happy sun-filled days, girls and fast cars and Brian's life was anything but happy and carefree.  Paul Giamatti portrays Dr. Landy in such a way that you know he's the bad guy from the moment he walks onto the screen.

Elizabeth Banks plays Melinda Ledbetter, the woman that Brian would fall in love with and the one that would be instrumental at getting him out of the controlling situation he was in.  It is through her eyes we see the older Brian and get perspective on what he has had to endure.

There are scenes that will make you cringe as you watch them with Brian being abused both verbally and physically by his father and then Dr. Landy, the man he thought was trying to help him.  When John Cusak, as the older Brian, tells the story of how his hearing in one ear is almost gone because his dad used to hit him so hard in such a matter-of-fact way it is truly heartbreaking.  The movie ends with concert footage of Brian Wilson from the present day singing his song ""Love and Mercy"" which was the perfect way to end it.

Overall I thought this was a near-perfect movie about Brian Wilson.  If you're looking for a movie full of girls and beach scenes you'll want to look elsewhere but if you are willing to delve into the darker side of a musical genius you will be rewarded.

After seeing this movie all I wanted to do was send some good thoughts and vibrations out to Brian Wilson.  I doubt he'll ever read this review but on the off chance I just want to say thank you, brother, for the music and we love you!",1441929600,230,3338,4.189358372456964

7323645,5,B01127XNEE,"This is a sensitive, multi-layered film that gives a remarkable insight into the creative process and the challenges involved with managing that powerful experience and one's own mental health - in this particular case, the remarkable musical genius, Brian Wilson.  Atticus Ross's insights in somehow being able to internalize Brian's music and then adapt it to his life has created the best soundtrack I've heard - it builds on Wilson's genius to the point of possibly being genius in itself.

Bill Pohlad's ability to somehow pull that reality into a genuine classic heroic/love story is equally impressive.  The acting is superb in creating the brilliant young Wilson (Paul Dano) and in the later period when Brian was essentially re-inventing himself with the help of his (now) wife Melinda (John Cusack) is equally sensitive and intelligent.  Elizabeth Banks gives a fabulous portrayal of a very strong-minded, yet sensitive and empathetic woman.  I don't want to be a spoiler so won't go into the storyline further.  I will say that I've always loved the work of Paul Giamatti and he's perfect for the role of Dr. Landy.

Love & Mercy is worth the purchase so as to easily have several viewings of the film.  It is that powerfully moving on so many levels.  It's an experience that will have a profound impact on you, both musically and in the story itself.",1440720000,8,1363,4.91703056768559

7323647,5,B01127XNEE,"I love this movie. Even if you are only slightly interested in music, this is such a great film just for showing us how great music was of Brian Wilson was created. And despite his struggles, he survived and overcame. Love truly does conquer all.",1440633600,,246,4.488888888888889
7323648,5,B01127XNEE,"It's almost standard procedure during a biopic film review to obsess over the truth of the narrative and to separate known history against the invented ""inspired by true events"" variety. In 1984's wonderful Amadeus, there are no recordings or kinescopes of the real Mozart, so in essence the sterling performances of Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham have become our shared recollection of Mozart's truth and life - ""Hell, I don't know if it happened that way but it should have and besides, who knew that the kid from Animal House could act.""

Fast forward two-plus centuries and Brain Wilson as the storyline focus of Love and Mercy provides a very different set of challenges.  We know too much and when it comes to rendering an accurate portrait of the tortured auteur of the Beach Boys, to allow any suspension of disbelief. His descent into psychosis and virtual imprisonment by his therapist, Dr. Eugene Landy (a magnificent performance by Paul Giamatti) has been well chronicled by fans, friends and family - so making a film exclusively about his sad and desultory soap opera would be reduced to an exercise in voyeurism best left to television.

What makes Love and Mercy so special is the filmmaker's attention to Wilson's painstaking, almost autistic creative process as his once in a generation compositional gifts competes with his equally sturdy menu of neuroses in the making of his magnum opus - The Beach Boys incomparable Pet Sounds album released in 1966. For fifteen minutes we watch an Oscar-worthy Paul Dano as Wilson synthesize the discordance of rock music with the superlative orchestral, big band and jazz renderings of Capitol Records legendary and loosely configured ""Wrecking Crew"" of back-up musicians led by drummer Hal Blaine. For fifty years we have been told Brian Wilson is a genius, now we know why.

Beyond the powerful performances of Paul Dano, John Cusack and Elizabeth Banks, the overflowing pleasures of Love and Mercy are numerous, not the least of which is the extraordinary sound editing. I was transfixed by a relatively minor scene at a dinner party to celebrate the success of Good Vibrations where Wilson creates a suite of music out of the interplay of scraping silverware and the ping of fine crystal. I loved this film but I am equally sure that it will reveal many more pleasures with each successive viewing. Director Bill Pohlad has created a  masterpiece whose subject deserves no less.",1440633600,4,2441,4.973039215686274
7323649,5,B01127XNEE,"I ordered the blu-ray, which isn't out yet. This review is more for the actual film, which in my opinion was one of the best films of the year. Paul Dano and John Cusack play the troubled, yet brilliant Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. Mind you, I had never given much thought to the Beach Boys, other than the occasional poppy 60's surf song that shows up in movies or on the radio my parents played as I was growing up.
As I've gotten older, I've become more interested in the arrangement of how an artist creates an album and this film really summed up the creating of ""Pet Sounds"" and how it ultimately, among other things, led to the fall of Brian Wilson. After watching the film, I went out and purchased a copy of Pet Sounds and have listened to it consistently for the last few months. I never realized how intricate the songs are or what a creative genius Brian Wilson was.
Unfortunately he hit a low point in his life which was portrayed by John Cusack. I think both Cusack and Dano did a great job portraying Brian Wilson, at two completely different points in his life. These two intersections, after watching the film, almost seem like a completely different human. The early Wilson had a creative optimism overshadowed by anxiety and and his own personal demons that led to the later Wilson portrayed by Cusack. Both actors did a great job, however, looking at old footage of Wilson, I'd say Dano nailed it a little better than Cusack.
Long story short, I would highly recommend this film if you're a fan of well composed soundtracks, interesting biopics about an American icon, or just  like movies about real people instead of the usual crap movies coming out of Hollywood these days.
I look forward to the special features on blu-ray.",1440547200,4,1750,4.555555555555555
7323650,5,B01127XNEE,This a outstanding true story about one of the greatest musical genius's in the last 100 years.  We get split story about Brian Wilson in the sixties as he melts down and brain Wilson in the 1980's as he is rescued by  true love in the form of his future wife.  THe performances are Oscar worthy in this movie and there should be many nominees coming from it.  The blu ray is outstanding and it has a nice hd  picture without blemishes.  This is one of the better musical biopics from the last 10 years for sure. SO make sure you watch it!,1440547200,2,539,4.184466019417476

7323652,3,B01127XNEE,"Loved the film-although what i really loved was the Pet Sounds sessions which was done brilliantly, IMO, the soap opera drama story, although interesting was not as vibrantly exciting as Brian in the studio-but, as far as this DVD release, why, oh why, are there no bonus clips?

I was a bit worried that using two actors (one of whom looks like Brian, the other not so much) was not going to work, but it did. The performances by both actors was brilliant, as was the performances by Paul Giamatti and Elizabeth Banks .  Knowing the story of Wilson's lost years, I was not expecting an amazing love story.  This is so far my favorite movie of 2015.",1439942400,2,466,4.213483146067416
7323654,5,B01127XNEE,Saw it twice in the theater; can't wait to own it.  It is a staggering look at Brian Wilson's life.  The amazement is that he has survived to tell his tale.  I absolutely loved hearing the pieces of a song develop back and forth through the movie; from first chords to final magnificent arrangement.  It is not a happy look at the Beach Boys; it's a deep look at Wilson.  WELL worth the viewing.  Loved it.,1439769600,3,406,4.276315789473684
7323655,5,B01127XNEE,"Saw it three times in the theater and can't wait to own it. If you are a Brian Wilson fan, this is a must-watch. I was not sure about the whole ""two guys playing Brian""  but it really works. Love it. What more can I say?",1439769600,,220,3.782608695652174
7323656,3,B01127XNEE,"This was a good movie, but I had high expectations and the film failed to meet them.  There were a few reasons for this.

1.  This was essentially 3 movies in one -- a movie about a young Brian Wilson, at the top of his game; a movie about an older Brian Wilson, a sad shell of his former self;  and a documentary on Pet Sounds.  It's very hard to put together 3 good movies in a single film.

2.  Because there was so much to cover, there was little time for character development and most characters came across as boring and one-dimensional.  Mike Love was an annoying, difficult obstacle to Wilson's creative genius;  Ledbetter was a purely saintly figure;  Landy was entirely evil.  Characters are more interesting when we understand their motivations and see things from their side.  But this movie was mostly caricatures, not characters.

3.  John Cusack was a poor casting choice.  He looked like he was playing a washed up version of himself, not an embattled Brian Wilson.

4.  Hopping back and forth between the 1960s and 1980s didn't work for me.  I would have preferred that the pre-credit sequence simply show us a ""flash forward"" to Brian Wilson in his 1980s, incapacitated state, so that the viewer knows where the film is going. After that, the movie could have focused solely on the young Wilson until the point of his post-Pet Sounds breakdown.  It could then say ""20 years later"" and take us to the Cusack plot.

This was still a fun movie to watch, and the Pet Sounds studio sequences alone make the film worth watching.",1439683200,9,1541,4.595588235294118
7323657,4,B01127XNEE,"Two separate time periods of Brian Wilson's life in one movie is directed close to perfection.  Rather than the standard practice of too many flashbacks used in todays films, the flick switches back and forth to each story in a timely manner.  Both Paul Dano and John Cusack do a fine job acting as Brian Wilson even if Cusack doesn't  look like him.  I'm actually more impressed with Elizabeth Banks (Melinda Ledbetter) and Paul Giamatti (Dr. Eugene Landy)  in their strong willed roles mentally challenging one another right to the climactic end.  Brian Wilson gets vindication for his masterful ""Pet Sounds"" that the majority of the Beach Boys fan base didn't appreciate until decades later.  Jake Abel as Mike Love in a good supporting role,  not really the bad guy as some might think in the film,  defends the band as Brian's mental issues start to take the group in an uneven direction.  The movie makes a drastic improvement once it becomes a Brian Wilson personal  story and less about the music he created.",1438387200,7,1016,4.781609195402299
7323658,4,B01127XNEE,"Whats it about?

The incredible story of the rise, fall, and rescue of The Beach Boys Brian Wilson.

What did I think?

I didn't know the story of Brian Wilson before seeing Love and Mercy. And if I hadnt madly Googled post-film, I wouldnt have believed it either; he has, quite simply, led an unimaginable life. Through the extraordinary acting talents of Paul Dano and John Cusack, we join Brian at two pivotal points in his career: the creation of the pocket symphony that was the Pet Sounds album, and the point at which his life was under the legal and medical spell of psychiatrist Dr. Eugene Landy. Thats the brilliance of Love and Mercy: most biopics tell the story, this one puts you smack bang in the head of a tortured musical genius. God only knows what happened to Brian, but if this movie is anything to go by, truth really is stranger than fiction.",1438041600,7,863,4.519230769230769
7323659,4,B01127XNEE,"It's hard to watch mental illness in action. This biographical film allows us to witness the process for former Beach Boy Brian Wilson, as he hits the heights on the pop music charts and then the depths of isolation and rejection as paranoia and schizophrenia overwhelm his life.

Director Bill Pohlad (""12 Years a Slave"") gives us a 119-minute slow trajectory of failure, chaos, confusion and heartbreak as we see our hero brutalized first by his ambitious father and then by his dictatorial personal physician. We can see how everyone else, including his singing group, tries to be patient and understanding; they even wear red plastic fireman's hats in a recording session as he becomes more eccentric and demanding.

We see:
  * Paul Dano (""Prisoners"") Young Brian Wilson already carries within himself the seeds of his own self-destruction. To me this looked like a form of Asperger's, particularly as we see the tableware at the dinner party become too loud for him to tolerate.
  * John Cusack (""Lee Daniels' The Butler"") Mature Brian Wilson is a physical and mental wreck, unable to write music and utterly cowed by his bullying therapist.
  * Elizabeth Banks (""Hunger Games"") Melinda Ledbetter is in car sales when our hero decides he wants a new Cadillac....and then a date. She is shocked by the behavior of Brian's therapist.
  * Paul Giamatti (""Saving Mr. Banks"") Dr. Eugene Landy describes himself as Brian's ""brother from a different mother."" He has facilitated a healthy weight loss for Wilson and is determined to control every aspect of his life.
  * Diana Maria Riva (""The Bridge"") Gloria is the observant long-time maid who has witnessed the entire spiral. She wants what's best for Brian and becomes his advocate, along with Melinda.

We enjoy snippets of I Get Around; Fun, Fun, Fun (Til My Daddy Took My T-Bird Away); Surfin' U.S.A.; and a few others, but we do NOT enjoy watching a talented but mercurial young musician sink into madness. Later we hear Good Vibrations and selections from Pet Sounds.
