7031407,5,B00UA15CCK,"He doesn't have ""the look"", ""the size"". ""the charisma"", he will never amount to anything. He might not even be a B+ player. He is more like a Velocity extra...No! No! No! Daniel Bryan's skill and his passion come through with every move he hits. His passion is his charisma. Daniel Bryan is passed the A+ to the being the answer to saving WM 30. I love the matches and the stories in between them. The Blu Ray is definitely worth it if you have a blu ray machine. I",1435190400,,465,4.177777777777778

7031409,5,B00UA15CCK,One of the best WWE documentaries ever accompanied by a whole bunch of great matches & some fantastic interview segments in between with the man himself. I was a little disappointed to see Bryan's match against Bray Wyatt from the 2014 Royal Rumble wasn't included in full seeing as it is not only one of his best WWE matches of all time but the match/night itself was very important to Bryan's WWE career & is even discussed on the main feature. I would've have also liked to see the main feature extended a little more for the home video release but otherwise the blu-ray is amazing & covers pretty much all the best & biggest parts of Bryan's career thus far. Definitely recommended to any Daniel Bryan/WWE fan!,1434067200,,714,4.5859375
7031410,3,B00UA15CCK,"My first impression of the dvd as a whole was it is a transitional dvd just like ""CM Punk - the best in the world' or 'John Cena experience' dvds. Instead of coming up with a documentary that covers the entire career (entire life for the retired or deceased), they have decided to run their story around a single event. I don't blame WWE for that since Bryan Danielson is likely to have another 10-20 years left in him unless his injuries cut his career short.
What intrigued me was the short moments before each match where Danielson talks about the match itself and the circumstances surrounding it. I was pleasantly surprised by Danielson mentioning his Ring of Honor days - although somewhat discredited by the WWE ('ROH did not have faith in him, we did' attitude). I think it was the second time WWE actually acknowledged there are other promotions out there (the first being Jeff Hardy's My Life dvd where he briefly mentions something like ""I gave the other competition a try..."").
For the match selections - well, I must point out (as well as anyone who bought or watched this dvd) that a good number of the matches there had been already released on another Danielson dvd 'Superstar Collection"" but in WWE's defense, they did the best they could from their own library. Maybe 20 years later, they will buy up ROH for dvds on Danielson, Kevin Owen or Samoa Joe.
With all that being said, my comments on the matches.
1. Tryout match  the four young wrestlers had a very good match considering they had been wrestling only what, 4 months? Nice to see the late Lance Cade in his earlier days. Danielson and Kendrick definitely showed their potentials here.
2. Jamie Noble  not a bad match for Velocity
3. Chris Jericho  again, not a bad match, even against the world champion at that time
4. Miz  as Cole had stated in the documentary, Cole and Danielson were trying develop their characters, so let us be easy on his still annoying announcing
5. Big Show  couldn't they have done something more with the match, other than the Big Show just lying down for the cheap count? It is not Danielson's fault but they made the victory feel cheaper than usual MIB cashing in victories.
6. Big Show  another cheap match to make Danielson look like an unworthy champion, not even a good heel but just cheap and unworthy
7. Sheamus  as Sheamus and Danielson pointed out  a good match, good enough to be a Match of the Year candidate
8. CM Punk  nice buildup but a mediocre match coming from two talented wrestlers
9. With Kane  good and funny tag team match
10. Gauntlet match  a worthy buildup match
11. John Cena  an excellent match
12. Randy Orton  not a bad buildup match
13. WM 30  the highlight, if Danielson has to retire early due to his injuries, this will be the match
14. Roman Reigns  a match set up just to silence the booing audience (""hey, Roman beat your favorite guy, give him a break."")",1433721600,2,2898,4.546153846153846
7031411,2,B00UA15CCK,"This documentary is the same documentary as the one on the WWE Network called ""JOURNEY TO WM 30: DANIEL BRYAN"" with a couple of extra minutes in the beginning that add basically nothing.

It is unfortunate that there is no greater indication that this is the same documentary.

7031415,5,B00UA15CCK,"He's the modern day underdog as he seems to be fighting the odds since he made his WWE debut on a new concept show called 'NXT' to his fight against The Authority both in front & behind the scenes to the point where he's gained one of the biggest fan followings in WWE history with the fans showcasing their love for him by chanting one word, ""YES!""...that man is known to the WWE Universe as Daniel Bryan and this is his story.  Now this was another presentation from WWE that originally aired as a special presentation for the WWE Network only for it to now be released onto DVD with additional comments & footage (similar to a ""Director's Cut"" version of a movie) featuring comments from Bryan & Brie himself along with other personalities such as John Cena, Seth Rollins, Cesaro, Shawn Michaels, William Regal, The Miz, Pat Patterson, Michael Cole, Sheamus, and Steve Austin.

The theme for this documentary is Daniel Bryan's ""Journey To WrestleMania"" as we get a look at Bryan & his wife Brie Bella during WrestleMania XXX week (WWE Axxess, media appearances, Hall Of Fame, training, before & after WrestleMania) while discussing his feelings on certain elements of life & career such as being an underdog, how he views himself as a superstar & his celebrity status.  The documentary begins talking about Bryan's humble beginnings growing up & what inspired him to become a professional wrestler before attending school at Shawn Michaels' Wrestling Academy leading to his days on the independent scene & the impact he had in Ring Of Honor.  His WWE debut on NXT was discussed next as far as the issues & frustration he had from the first day & the impression given from his first match against Chris Jericho before going into the details & different opinions of the infamous incident that caused him to be fired to his return at SummerSlam.  What made him angry about his first WrestleMania appearance to the story behind his ""YES!"" chant was discussed next before going into heavy details of how what happened at WrestleMania XXVIII eventually turned out to be the best thing that happened to him.  The ""YES! Movement"" was heavily discussed next from how it translated over into pop culture to the point where it started ""taking over"" the shows in support of Bryan followed by how his relationship with Brie Bella & evolved to them attempting to have their wedding the same week as WrestleMania with the documentary concluding looking at his 'Cinderella' story at WrestleMania & reflecting on his life.

While the documentary has been previously seen on the WWE Network, there is new interview footage of Bryan discussing various things before each match along with additional comments from various superstars talking about subjects such as Shawn Michaels' heavy influence in his first dark match, who's the most influential person in his career, what the plans were for his original WWE debut, did Michael Cole's heel commentary help or hurt him, the ""right place, right time"" circumstances that lead to his first World Championship, the one criticism on his WrestleMania 28 match that surprised him, what was the most memorable thing about his match against C.M. Punk, his opinion on being a ""B+ player"" & what started that mindset including an interesting comment on how he compared that to his reign in Ring Of Honor, the original plans for WrestleMania XXX, his health, and future goals.

Matches Include:
American Dragon & Shooter Schultz vs. Brian Kendrick & Lance Cade - It should be noted that Bryan competed under a mask for this match as it was a long competitive tag match that did what it was designed to do in showcasing each talent with Bryan's stiff strikes & submissions, Kendrick's aerial tactics, Cade's size including some moves that not only turned his opponents inside out but also leaving his feet on more than one occassion, and Shooter's strength with some impactful offense.
Feb. '00

Bryan Danielson vs. Jamie Noble - Both men started out on the mat trading different holds from a working over the upper body while countering their opponents attempt as Bryan continued to work over the body with strong kicks while Noble focused on the neck area as both men traded momentum getting more intense as the match went on leading to a very competitive contest that made a strong first impression for Bryan.
""Velocity"" Jan. '03

vs. Chris Jericho - This was on the debut episode of NXT when the original concept was to have rookies being taught by the pros & in this case, Miz was Daniel's pro while Jericho's rookie was Wade Barrett. Jericho tried to intimidate Bryan early only for him to respond with a slap before Jericho was able to control over Bryan. Bryan rebounded when Jericho miscalculated a move yet the same would happen to Bryan when we went for a suicide dive only for Jericho to use his momentum against him as both men traded momentum & able to have counters to each others offense. The match was less than 10 minutes but one of those debuts that definitely left an impression on those who didn't know about him before WWE.
""NXT"" Feb. '10
[Superstar Collection: Daniel Bryan]

vs. WWE United States Champion The Miz - As it's become in the past few months whenever The Miz or Bryan is involved in a match, if you get annoyed by Michael Cole then turn the volume on MUTE as he once again goes into heavy ""heel"" mode here while Miz came out with his ex-NXT rookie from season two in Alex Riley. Bryan went for his LaBell lock early before Miz went working over Bryan's arms & shoulders with various armbars & a shoulderbreaker straight out of the pages of ""Arn Anderson"" according to Matt Striker. Bryan was able to regain momentum with a suicide dive onto Miz on the outside before both men had a dueling fist fight against each other. Bryan ended up getting crotched on the top rope before Miz was able to deliver a clothesline off the top rope that landed Bryan on the top of his head. Riley got involved as expected but that didn't stop Bryan as he ended up pulling off a victory that not only had Michael Cole upset but Miz in tears.

vs. World Champion Big Show - Big Show finally ended his 9 year streak of not being a world champion (5 years if you count the ECW Championship) defeating Mark Henry in a Chairs Match before Henry attacked him afterwords opening the door for Daniel Bryan to do the one thing that Big Show had been encouraging him to do for weeks & cash in his title shot resulting in the shortest World Title in history.
T.L.C. '11
[Blu-Ray Edition of Straight To The Top: The Money In The Bank Anthology]

World Championship Match vs. Big Show - Mark Henry was on commentary for this match as Bryan kept trying to avoid Show only to get caught then hit with a big strike & tossed around various times before Bryan was able to use his speed advantage to ""hit & move"" using Show's momentum against him along with different kicks to keep Show off of his feet as both men went back & forth with Show not only keeping catching Bryan but delivering offense that had more of an impact with his size advantage to the point where Bryan was showing the effects while Bryan relied on his wrestling ability to apply submission moves from different positions before relying on other tactics to keep his title as this was a solid ""David vs. Goliath"" match but a different twist with ""Goliath"" in Big Show having the fan support behind him.
As a side note, it should be noted that Michael Cole was the ""heel"" announcer at the time constantly putting down Bryan & disrespecting him while being obnoxious causing Henry to give the best response to Cole's antics that actually caused him to shut up & get serious.
""SmackDown"" Jan. '12

2 Out Of 3 Falls vs. World Champion Sheamus - Bryan tried to heel the crowd earlier but they were heavily behind him in this town that was a regular stop during his days in Ring Of Honor while Sheamus came out with a shirt reminding them of their last encounter at WrestleMania. Sheamus went for the kick early which Daniel avoid but later catching Bryan in a sharpshooter/boston crab combination submission before catching Bryan coming off the apron & slamming him into the barrier. Bryan was able to mount some offense including a unique pinning combination locking Sheamus' shoulders with his legs & heavily targeting his shoulder with a grounded hammerlock & using the ringpost to his advantage. Bryan from there kept beating on Sheamus with his aggression eventually coming back to haunt him but that didn't stop Bryan from being able to get the YES-lock with Sheamus able later to be get his kick in that turned Bryan inside out. This was the yearly match on this PPV that was the quality of match we SHOULD have gotten WrestleMania (in this case, the previous two Mania's they had a scheduled match) because this was both men's best performance in recent memory & you saw just by how exhausted they were they gave you everything & told a story along the way.
Extreme Rules '12
[Blu-Ray Edition of Best PPV Matches Of 2012]

No Disqualification Match vs. WWE Champion C.M. Punk with A.J. Lee as the special referee - Both men started unloading on each other with punches & kicks early on while trading momentum with moves like Bryan with a running knee off the apron & Punk doing a springboard clothesline off the barricade onto Bryan crouched on the other barricade. Both men them proceeded to take advantage of the No DQ rule with Bryan using the steel steps & a kendo stick to work over Punk's midsection along with later doing a version of the Yes Lock with the stick while Punk later used the stick himself & did an innovative version of a bodyslam using a chair before a table was later brought to use. Both men continued to go back & forth including a sequence of a GTS attempt into a Yes Lock attempt onto another GTS that was turned into a frankensteiner before a superplex that looked like it took as much out of who received it as the one who gave it. A.J. did play some factors here such as introducing the chair into the match & dropping it in the middle of both men but didn't have the story involving her overshadow the quality match expected from Punk & Bryan with both men using the No DQ rule to add to the match.

[Best PPV Matches Of 2012]

w/Kane vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Kofi Kingston & R-Truth - Before the match started, pay attention of J.B.L. as he had a funny time towards Kane's old adversary in Pete Rose. Both teams traded momentum with Kofi & Truth working together while Kane & Bryan were working their singles offense including the way Bryan was able to get the No Lock on Kofi at one point. It backfired when Kane & Bryan attempted to work together only to result in a shoving match before hugging it out before there was a moment where it looked like Bryan was trying to save Kane only for him to take a shot at Kane himself that had a result that he didn't plan on or expect. The match was average but more about continuing the ""anger management"" storyline between the two.
Night Of Champions '12

Gauntlet Match vs. Jack Swagger, Antonio Cesaro, Ryback - RAW General Manager Brad Maddox setup this match to see Bryan was worthy of being chosen by John Cena for his championship match at SummerSlam.  Swagger was the first opponent overpowering Bryan & kept beating him down with later Ryback using the same strategy of using his power to pick the bones with power moves like the sidewalk slam & catching Bryan stopping his momentum dead with clotheslines along with delivering a beating on the outside as Bryan attempted to use the strategy of ""hit & move"" so Ryback couldn't catch him.  The real special treat here was the match against Cesaro as he used a mix of power moves such as a deadlift suplex & gutwrench suplex along with scientific wrestling such as constantly reverting back to a unique version of the chinlock to wear him down while Bryan worked over chopping Cesaro down working over the legs along with different strikes & dropkicks in what was the most physical encounter of the three as you saw them just beat each other into exhaustion.  The gauntlet match went over half an hour & was definitely the strong physical wrestling match to showcase Bryan.
""RAW"" July '13

vs. WWE Champion John Cena - Triple H was the special referee for this match while Cena was coming into the match with an elbow injury which Bryan targeted right away causing Cena to go to the outside to try to regroup & took control with the headlock takedown & a running forearm that knocked Bryan off the apron into the announce table but Bryan came back tossing Cena into the steps only for Cena to retaliate with a suplex off the steps. Bryan took back control in the ring with a running clothesline & kicks to the chest while Cena had his trademark shoulderblocks & side slam only for Bryan to be able to have counters to a five knuckle shuffle & A.A. on more than one occasion & even put Cena in his own STF as both men traded momentum back & forth hitting big moves like the superplex & top rope legdrop & diving headbutt while blocking & countering each other's holds such as the suicide dive & top rope head scissors & trading slaps as both men were just exhausted to the point where they were leaning on each other just to stay up. This was very similar to Cena's series of matches with Punk where Bryan was able to pull it out of Cena & this was definitely a highlight in both men's WWE careers but stay tuned after as what everyone was expecting to happen did (hell, WWE teased it for weeks coming into this match) but nobody expected HOW it happened.
SummerSlam '13
[Best PPV Matches Of 2013]

No Disqualification Match vs. Randy Orton - Bryan came out very aggressive from the start with strong kicks & strikes along with using the ring post to his advantage before Orton also took advantage of the environment around ringside along with implementing a weapon into the match to heavily work over a specific area of his opponent as both men used the same offense against each other from top rope offense to delivering & receiving shots with different weapons both in & outside of the ring as I've always stated that Orton & Bryan have never had a bad match against each other (only bad finishes) and this was no different in what resulted as a very physical encounter.
""RAW"" Mar. '14

vs. WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Batista - Rev Theory performed ""Voices"" as Orton came to the ring as both Batista & Orton took advantage of the ""No Disqualification"" stipulation on the outside using the barriers & ringside steps as weapons while Bryan was able to work over both men in the ring with each man as the interaction between all three lead to such moments as the third man breaking up pins between the other two or stealing a attempt pin off the other man, one man hitting a big move only for the third man to come with another big move right after, and an unlikely alliance (or reunion) formed when two men decided together to take out the biggest threat in the match including one double team move that ended up hitting the receiver as much as the executor, and more than just other two competitors not wanting to see Daniel Bryan as WWE Champion. This was a great triple threat match that played to everyone's strengths while also giving one hell of a WrestleMania moment to end the show.
WrestleMania XXX

vs. Roman Reigns - The winner goes to face WWE Champion Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania as both men were evenly matched early applying the same holds while countering & blocking the other's offense with Bryan relying on wrestling & Roman using his power as Reigns got more aggressive on the outside along with a clothesline that turned Bryan inside out & Bryan attempting to take away his size focusing on the legs eventually hitting him in his previously injured hernia area with Reigns showing the effects as they continued to trade momentum with each man catching the other in the middle of an offensive move only to deliver a hard shot of their own on more than one occasion including a sequence of non-stop counters & reversals with both men shocked that the other kicking out of finishing moves in what was a very competitive match for close around 20 minutes with J.B.L. stating it perfectly on commentary, ""Bryan is out-wrestling Reigns & Reigns is out-powering Bryan.""
Fastlane '15

(Blu-Ray) Bryan Danielson vs. John Cena - Cena was doing his ""thuganomics"" character during this time as both men had the same idea early on working over the same body part before going into a series of counters & reversals with Cena using his power while Bryan relying on his wrestling & strong strikes in a very short but competitive match.
""Velocity"" Feb. '03

(Blu-Ray) vs. William Regal - They were in Regal's home continent of Europe with Bryan executing some strong strikes & rapid kicks along with some impactful offense & submissions while Regal was able to counter Bryan & delivered offense impactful offense of his own in what was another very short match only relevant for their first time in the ring together in WWE knowing their past history.
""NXT"" Apr. '10

(Blu-Ray) w/Brie Bella vs. Ted DiBiase & Maryse - This was another very short match that was only relevant for Bryan teaming up during the time period where they had a storyline together that actually brought them together as a couple & future spouses behind the scenes.
""RAW"" Dec. '10

(Blu-Ray) Steel Cage Match w/Bray Wyatt vs. The Usos - Kane was the gate keeper at ringside while the rest of the Wyatt Family was on the outside as this started out with all four men brawling with the cage being used as a weapon early on with bodies being bounced to slingshot into the cage as everyone continued to deliver offense from all over the ring from fighting at the top of the cage to coming off the top rope multiple times as it ultimately came down to one team being able to use their opponents against each other but the bigger story was the aftermath where one man was left laying in the cage while another celebrated his ""rebellion.""
""RAW"" Jan. '14

Other DVD extras include Daniel Bryan's big announcement after being out for most of 2014 while highlights of him anger management classes with Kane are included on the Blu-Ray.  Other Blu-Ray extras include bonus stories such as talking about his days in NXT, when he was fired, his proposal to Brie, and his infamous beard.

The only real negatives I can state here is that some of the match selection could have been replaced with another of better quality against that opponent (i.e. William Regal) or just left off period because of it's lack of significance (Big Show) while other important matches of his career were left off (winning Money In The Bank) but overall this is a presentation I really enjoyed that I recommend.",1432857600,7,18864,4.6170593498359676

World Championship Match vs. Big Show - Mark Henry was on commentary for this match as Bryan kept trying to avoid Show only to get caught then hit with a big strike & tossed around various times before Bryan was able to use his speed advantage to ""hit & move"" using Show's momentum against him along with different kicks to keep Show off of his feet as both men went back & forth with Show not only keeping catching Bryan but delivering offense that had more of an impact with his size advantage to the point where Bryan was showing the effects while Bryan relied on his wrestling ability to apply submission moves from different positions before relying on other tactics to keep his title as this was a solid ""David vs. Goliath"" match but a different twist with ""Goliath"" in Big Show having the fan support behind him.
As a side note, it should be noted that Michael Cole was the ""heel"" announcer at the time constantly putting down Bryan & disrespecting him while being obnoxious causing Henry to give the best response to Cole's antics that actually caused him to shut up & get serious.
""SmackDown"" Jan. '12

2 Out Of 3 Falls vs. World Champion Sheamus - Bryan tried to heel the crowd earlier but they were heavily behind him in this town that was a regular stop during his days in Ring Of Honor while Sheamus came out with a shirt reminding them of their last encounter at WrestleMania. Sheamus went for the kick early which Daniel avoid but later catching Bryan in a sharpshooter/boston crab combination submission before catching Bryan coming off the apron & slamming him into the barrier. Bryan was able to mount some offense including a unique pinning combination locking Sheamus' shoulders with his legs & heavily targeting his shoulder with a grounded hammerlock & using the ringpost to his advantage. Bryan from there kept beating on Sheamus with his aggression eventually coming back to haunt him but that didn't stop Bryan from being able to get the YES-lock with Sheamus able later to be get his kick in that turned Bryan inside out. This was the yearly match on this PPV that was the quality of match we SHOULD have gotten WrestleMania (in this case, the previous two Mania's they had a scheduled match) because this was both men's best performance in recent memory & you saw just by how exhausted they were they gave you everything & told a story along the way.
Extreme Rules '12
[Blu-Ray Edition of Best PPV Matches Of 2012]

No Disqualification Match vs. WWE Champion C.M. Punk with A.J. Lee as the special referee - Both men started unloading on each other with punches & kicks early on while trading momentum with moves like Bryan with a running knee off the apron & Punk doing a springboard clothesline off the barricade onto Bryan crouched on the other barricade. Both men them proceeded to take advantage of the No DQ rule with Bryan using the steel steps & a kendo stick to work over Punk's midsection along with later doing a version of the Yes Lock with the stick while Punk later used the stick himself & did an innovative version of a bodyslam using a chair before a table was later brought to use. Both men continued to go back & forth including a sequence of a GTS attempt into a Yes Lock attempt onto another GTS that was turned into a frankensteiner before a superplex that looked like it took as much out of who received it as the one who gave it. A.J. did play some factors here such as introducing the chair into the match & dropping it in the middle of both men but didn't have the story involving her overshadow the quality match expected from Punk & Bryan with both men using the No DQ rule to add to the match.
Money In The Bank '12
[Best PPV Matches Of 2012]

w/Kane vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Kofi Kingston & R-Truth - Before the match started, pay attention of J.B.L. as he had a funny time towards Kane's old adversary in Pete Rose. Both teams traded momentum with Kofi & Truth working together while Kane & Bryan were working their singles offense including the way Bryan was able to get the No Lock on Kofi at one point. It backfired when Kane & Bryan attempted to work together only to result in a shoving match before hugging it out before there was a moment where it looked like Bryan was trying to save Kane only for him to take a shot at Kane himself that had a result that he didn't plan on or expect. The match was average but more about continuing the ""anger management"" storyline between the two.
Night Of Champions '12

Gauntlet Match vs. Jack Swagger, Antonio Cesaro, Ryback - RAW General Manager Brad Maddox setup this match to see Bryan was worthy of being chosen by John Cena for his championship match at SummerSlam.  Swagger was the first opponent overpowering Bryan & kept beating him down with later Ryback using the same strategy of using his power to pick the bones with power moves like the sidewalk slam & catching Bryan stopping his momentum dead with clotheslines along with delivering a beating on the outside as Bryan attempted to use the strategy of ""hit & move"" so Ryback couldn't catch him.  The real special treat here was the match against Cesaro as he used a mix of power moves such as a deadlift suplex & gutwrench suplex along with scientific wrestling such as constantly reverting back to a unique version of the chinlock to wear him down while Bryan worked over chopping Cesaro down working over the legs along with different strikes & dropkicks in what was the most physical encounter of the three as you saw them just beat each other into exhaustion.  The gauntlet match went over half an hour & was definitely the strong physical wrestling match to showcase Bryan.
""RAW"" July '13

vs. WWE Champion John Cena - Triple H was the special referee for this match while Cena was coming into the match with an elbow injury which Bryan targeted right away causing Cena to go to the outside to try to regroup & took control with the headlock takedown & a running forearm that knocked Bryan off the apron into the announce table but Bryan came back tossing Cena into the steps only for Cena to retaliate with a suplex off the steps. Bryan took back control in the ring with a running clothesline & kicks to the chest while Cena had his trademark shoulderblocks & side slam only for Bryan to be able to have counters to a five knuckle shuffle & A.A. on more than one occasion & even put Cena in his own STF as both men traded momentum back & forth hitting big moves like the superplex & top rope legdrop & diving headbutt while blocking & countering each other's holds such as the suicide dive & top rope head scissors & trading slaps as both men were just exhausted to the point where they were leaning on each other just to stay up. This was very similar to Cena's series of matches with Punk where Bryan was able to pull it out of Cena & this was definitely a highlight in both men's WWE careers but stay tuned after as what everyone was expecting to happen did (hell, WWE teased it for weeks coming into this match) but nobody expected HOW it happened.
SummerSlam '13
[Best PPV Matches Of 2013]

No Disqualification Match vs. Randy Orton - Bryan came out very aggressive from the start with strong kicks & strikes along with using the ring post to his advantage before Orton also took advantage of the environment around ringside along with implementing a weapon into the match to heavily work over a specific area of his opponent as both men used the same offense against each other from top rope offense to delivering & receiving shots with different weapons both in & outside of the ring as I've always stated that Orton & Bryan have never had a bad match against each other (only bad finishes) and this was no different in what resulted as a very physical encounter.
""RAW"" Mar. '14

vs. WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Batista - Rev Theory performed ""Voices"" as Orton came to the ring as both Batista & Orton took advantage of the ""No Disqualification"" stipulation on the outside using the barriers & ringside steps as weapons while Bryan was able to work over both men in the ring with each man as the interaction between all three lead to such moments as the third man breaking up pins between the other two or stealing a attempt pin off the other man, one man hitting a big move only for the third man to come with another big move right after, and an unlikely alliance (or reunion) formed when two men decided together to take out the biggest threat in the match including one double team move that ended up hitting the receiver as much as the executor, and more than just other two competitors not wanting to see Daniel Bryan as WWE Champion. This was a great triple threat match that played to everyone's strengths while also giving one hell of a WrestleMania moment to end the show.
WrestleMania XXX

vs. Roman Reigns - The winner goes to face WWE Champion Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania as both men were evenly matched early applying the same holds while countering & blocking the other's offense with Bryan relying on wrestling & Roman using his power as Reigns got more aggressive on the outside along with a clothesline that turned Bryan inside out & Bryan attempting to take away his size focusing on the legs eventually hitting him in his previously injured hernia area with Reigns showing the effects as they continued to trade momentum with each man catching the other in the middle of an offensive move only to deliver a hard shot of their own on more than one occasion including a sequence of non-stop counters & reversals with both men shocked that the other kicking out of finishing moves in what was a very competitive match for close around 20 minutes with J.B.L. stating it perfectly on commentary, ""Bryan is out-wrestling Reigns & Reigns is out-powering Bryan.""
Fastlane '15

(Blu-Ray) Bryan Danielson vs. John Cena - Cena was doing his ""thuganomics"" character during this time as both men had the same idea early on working over the same body part before going into a series of counters & reversals with Cena using his power while Bryan relying on his wrestling & strong strikes in a very short but competitive match.
""Velocity"" Feb. '03

(Blu-Ray) vs. William Regal - They were in Regal's home continent of Europe with Bryan executing some strong strikes & rapid kicks along with some impactful offense & submissions while Regal was able to counter Bryan & delivered offense impactful offense of his own in what was another very short match only relevant for their first time in the ring together in WWE knowing their past history.
""NXT"" Apr. '10

(Blu-Ray) w/Brie Bella vs. Ted DiBiase & Maryse - This was another very short match that was only relevant for Bryan teaming up during the time period where they had a storyline together that actually brought them together as a couple & future spouses behind the scenes.
""RAW"" Dec. '10

(Blu-Ray) Steel Cage Match w/Bray Wyatt vs. The Usos - Kane was the gate keeper at ringside while the rest of the Wyatt Family was on the outside as this started out with all four men brawling with the cage being used as a weapon early on with bodies being bounced to slingshot into the cage as everyone continued to deliver offense from all over the ring from fighting at the top of the cage to coming off the top rope multiple times as it ultimately came down to one team being able to use their opponents against each other but the bigger story was the aftermath where one man was left laying in the cage while another celebrated his ""rebellion.""
""RAW"" Jan. '14

Other DVD extras include Daniel Bryan's big announcement after being out for most of 2014 while highlights of him anger management classes with Kane are included on the Blu-Ray.  Other Blu-Ray extras include bonus stories such as talking about his days in NXT, when he was fired, his proposal to Brie, and his infamous beard.

The only real negatives I can state here is that some of the match selection could have been replaced with another of better quality against that opponent (i.e. William Regal) or just left off period because of it's lack of significance (Big Show) while other important matches of his career were left off (winning Money In The Bank) but overall this is a presentation I really enjoyed that I recommend.",1432857600,5,18864,4.6170593498359676

This is a great DVD, on top of the matches being all excellent gems and the Network special being great there's also personal stories and comments from Daniel Bryan for each of the matches that are absolutely fascinating (arguably even more than the documentary) about the reasons some of these matches took place.
