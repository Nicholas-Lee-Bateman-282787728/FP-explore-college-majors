8500845,3,B006MHZ2FI,"This is the same film as the 2010 movie ""This is Who I Am."" The packaging has more color and they have a title with more appeal. The film is cliche filled with phrases like ""territory,"" ""respect,"" and ""stick ball."" Carlo (Marco Arras) and Nick (Nino Cimino) are partners and bookies in Miami. Carlo wants to expand the business and starts a war with another group of mobsters, the Leone family, over 23rd street. Elizabeth Mae is Nick's girlfriend who gets trapped in the middle. She played her role very well. I am surprised she is not in more films.

The Italian mobster acting was overdone. The fighting was ""soft"" as men get continually punched and don't appear to be in too much pain. The writing was...well let's say Nimo Cimino is to mobster films as what Steven Seagall is to action films. This is a simple forward low budget mobster film.
