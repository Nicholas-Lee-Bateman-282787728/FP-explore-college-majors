2714502,5,B000LV6OK8,"This is an excellent collection of Judi Dench's fine work for BBC Television. It spans her career from the early sixties to the nineties.
You will also get some very nice extras to enjoy.
This is a ""must"" for every fan of this great actress!",1183334400,11,241,4.377777777777778
2714503,5,B000LV6OK8,"Proof that Ms. Dench is one of our finest actresses today.  An important set to own and cherish!  And as ""icing to the cake"" her superb rendition of ""Send in the Clowns"" is included.",1179532800,14,182,4.323529411764706
2714504,5,B000LV6OK8,"Absolutely great!  Judi Dench is the best of the best, and it's a real privilege to at last be able to see some of her extraordinary early work, along with some of her more recent, highly acclaimed roles as well.  The special features are treasures.",1179014400,4,249,4.511111111111111
2714505,5,B000LV6OK8,"Fantastic collection of rare Judi Dench films. Keep THE GHOSTS, THE CHERRY ORCHARD (1981) and KEEP AN EYE ON AMELIE. J. Dench is remarkable, excellent dramatic actress and amazing comedienne, as well. Very interesting also the extras.",1178409600,6,234,5.351351351351352
2714506,5,B000LV6OK8,"What a wonderful collection of Dame Judi's work.  I am particularly enjoying the works that I've not found individually: ""Talking to a Stranger"", the 1962 ""Cherry Orchard"", and ""Keep an Eye on Amelie"". In each of these we see the young Judi (before the Dame) already totally entrancing us by being at once the character in each play and at the same time being herself. It must be magic.

Her take on the Madame Ranevsky role, in the 1981 version of ""The Cherry Orchard"", is entirely hers and absolutely perfect for this viewer. Some of her later work in this collection includes: ""Absolute Hell"" and ""Can You Hear Me Thinking"".  You will also find, among the bonus features several radio plays, and three interviews with Dame Judi that give us all a closer glimpse and appreciation of the intelligence, and honesty behind the talent.

For Dench fans, this is a must!",1175817600,71,866,4.71523178807947
2714507,5,B000LV6OK8,"I received my collection yesterday. Was I ever so happy. "" What a little fire cracker"" as Rockie states in ""As time goes by"". Judi Dench was made for the stage, the screen and to perform. She did not miss her calling. I have just started watching the first two DVD and I am fixated on her performance in Talking to a Stranger. What energy she has and at such a young age.

I will give you more feedback as a descend my viewing of each but I must tell you I am not the lease disappointed in this collection. I received it in ample time and it has numerous additions to the set i.e.: bonus, which I love.

2714508,5,B000LV6OK8,"How Very Delightful....*(I realize JudiDench is not in The K's Speech)*

  What a great way to enjoy an evening...watching films that are
  wonderfully created and directed with the great advantage of marvelous
  actors.  The Judi Dench Collection, The Last of the Blond Bombshells,
  and The King's Speech has made my month!!!! I must admit that I am a
  delighted Judi Dench film viewer.  Her work in London Theater with terrific
  directors and co-stars, I have truly enjoyed, though I have never had the
  opportunity to attend a London etc. theater performance.  I rely on the film.
  The latest I have watched is one I have ordered from Amazon, Henry V and
  MacBeth.  When others are available, I will order. Meanwhile I do hope you
  will have many of Judi Dench's films, such as her films in the 007 classics
  etc..
  P.S.  I already have: Tea With Mussolini, Ladies in Lavender,Mrs. Brown,Nine,
  Notes on a Scandal,Shipping News,Mrs. Henderson Presents....Thank you! B.E.",1305936000,,983,4.95
2714509,4,B000LV6OK8,"Anyone who knows anything about theater, movies and actors, knows Judi Dench. She is the Meryl Streep of  the English. She never makes a misstep. It was thrilling to see her in these DVDs. Some of the acting is old fashioned. But Dench is a pleasure.
My reason for purchasing this collection, though, is my admiration for Michael Bryant. I have long considered him the best actor in the world. He is now deceased, alas. I wanted to see again the programs that introduced me to him, Talking to a Stranger. I wish there could be a Michael Bryant collection like this.",1271980800,2,565,4.53921568627451

2714513,5,B000LV6OK8,I CAN WATCH ALMOST ANYTHING DAME JUDI DENCH PERFORMS IN SUCH CLASS AND IT IS LIKE SHE IS THE PERSON THAT SHE BECOMES ON THE SCREEN FOR THE TIME SHE PLAYS ANY PART. YOU CAN BARELY TELL BETWEEN ACTOR AND PERSON. THOUGH YOU KNOW IT IS ONLY A PLAY OR MOVIE IT IS HARD TO TELL SHE DOES IT SO WELL. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND THE MUSIC FROM THE MOVIE CAN YOU HEAR ME THINKING AND IF ANYONE KNOWS WHERE TO GET THE MUSIC WHAT A LOVELY SONG.

I bought this a gift for my sister, who is a lover of nearly everything Judi has done.  We tried to watch Absolute Hell, which was terrible and Talking to a Stranger, which was equally as bad.  I think she's going to donate the entire DVD collection to the trash can!  I would not recommend this collection to any of her admirers!",1452124800,,460,4.573170731707317

At this stage in my Mum's 93-year-old life, entertainment should rather be amusing or otherwise distracting. These theatre pieces are mainly very thought-provoking, often somewhat depressing. No criticism there! Some of them are from ""The Russians."" [...literarily meant....]  It was never easy being those authors.

8164393,5,B000LV6OK8,"This collection surprised me with the age of some of the dramas.  It was not what I expected but it shows where Ms Dench came from and is a study of her career performances.  Much of it is old but like good wine just matures with age.
Worth watching if your a serious follower of theatre.  Not light weight fluffy nothings.  Good and Ill watch it again and again Im sure.",1332460800,2,371,4.183098591549296
