8223616,3,B000WLSM7A,"This DVD showcases a collection of comedy skits and musical sketches from the long-running Dean Martin Variety Show.  Two sections stand out.  The first was an energetic solo by the great Ella Fitzgerald, followed by Ella, Dean, and Gordon MacRae singing a humorous medley of cowboy songs.  Ella, in her sixties, still had her wonderful singing voice and was her jolly self.  The second standout segment was Orson Welles reminiscing on his ""War of the Worlds"" radio broadcast.  What sort of ruined or cheapened the overall program was that it appeared that Dean Martin was intoxicated for most of the show.",1352419200,3,606,4.96039603960396
