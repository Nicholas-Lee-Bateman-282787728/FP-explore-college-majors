3028365,5,B000YENUOK,"Edward Woodward starred in a television show in Britain long before the Equalizer hit the streets of New York. The show was called 'Callan' and in many ways established his reputation. His character was a no nonsense assassin for the British government with psychological problems who was the best at what he did. While the drama series was less than well funded it was extremely realistic and cold blooded. Callous would have been an appropriate name.

Having said this by way of pertinent background, we see a revamped secret agent, retired, living in New York and trying, at his own expense, to compensate for his deadly dealings in the past.

This, stylish thriller, finally seeing the light of day in it's DVD release, is an accurate portrayal of New York in the eighties. In many ways it is a sad commentary on life in the Big Apple, if not a cry from the heart on behalf of the suffering citizenry.

It is my understanding too that the sleek Jaguar which carries the agent, McCall, around town sparked a wave of buying of the marque as the show took hold, a much better buy than today's model.

However, I digress. These stories are excellent and remind us of situations which will not be missed. The acting, and plots are generally of extremely high standard in the main although personally, I find the stories involving the son more than a little tedious. All in all though an excellent addition to anyone's collection. Hopefully the powers that be will see fit to add Callan to the future release list.",1202860800,14,1512,4.672932330827067
3028366,5,B000YENUOK,"The Equalizer was a great show- and not just for its time.  I have to join everyone else in shouting ""FINALLY!"" from the rooftops- I've been waiting for this for a long time!  I hope it doesn't stop at season one and we eventually see all episodes out on DVD- I'll be buying every one.

Kudos to everyone who worked on bringing this show to us- it truly has been one of the greats and has stuck in my brain all these years.",1201824000,3,423,4.072289156626506
3028367,5,B000YENUOK,"How come the box art is so generic? You'd never know what the program is going by that. They could have at least made the cover look authentic to the program with silhouette and classic red logo. It's tarnishing the vigilante image of a well recognized series that any child of mid 80's MTV generation would remember. Mostly because The Police's drummer did the series theme. Do donations from purchases go to churches that don't pay taxes or something? Give something back to the fans, ya jerks!",1200096000,,496,4.712643678160919
3028368,5,B000YENUOK,"As one of the writers and producers of The Equalizer, I'm very happy that what we did is finally coming out on DVD.  The only sad note is that my friend, the legendary Jim McAdams, Executive Producer of the series, passed away in September of 07 and never saw it happen.

3028369,5,B000YENUOK,"Every night after work I would rush home to make sure that I did not miss the Equalizer during its first run episodes.  After purchasing a VCR I then made sure that I recorded every episode that I could when it played on the USA Network.

  The Equalizer was my favorite show on television.  It dug deep into the soul of Robert McCall, a former CIA operative.  The show was thought provoking, historical, Cold War-ish, and had excellent plots and fantastic endings.  I have yet to find a television series with endings as well done 20 years later.

  McCall, Control, Mickey and the gang were fun to watch.  They were good at their craft and did what was right.  Sometimes, as in Control, he would ultimately do what was right. It showed a lot of people some of the ins and outs of the intelligence field by displaying that there was not always a black and white to everything.

  When the Equalizer movie planned for 2009 gets cast I can only hope that the role of the Equalizer is given to actor Michael Madsen.  His starring role in the series Vengeance Unlimited was very similar to that of the charachter Robert McCall.  He was Mr. Chappell, a mystery man with a very dark and unknown past.  He fought for those that were treated poorly by the system.  He sought justice.  Vengeance Unlimited was cancelled way before its time.  Imagine the plot stories that were discarded.  I wanted so much to know more about what made Mr. Chappell become what he was.  I do not remember the name of the lady in charge of ABC's network programming that year but she cancelled a lot of shows that I liked and then she lost her job.  Please, someone get Vengeance Unlimited onto DVD release!  It is a classic.",1197849600,5,1698,4.470588235294118

Nothing tops this series. with the lead actor at his apex form, he tantalized me with his every cunning move and killer instinct precision. though it was just a series, it made me a believer of the vigilante squad.

3028373,5,B000YENUOK,"To Europeans and foreign film fans, Edward Woodward will always be remembered for playing the title role in ""Breaker Morant."" But to American television watchers, he will be remembered for playing Robert McCall, the wily and dangerous ex-covert operative in ""The Equalizer.""

McCall is a former CIA-type (and at least one episode hints at him being a former mercenary) who has devoted all he has to his career, losing his marriage and distancing himself from his young son in the process. He decides to quit the espionage business and work as a vigilante, helping people in distress. His occasional accomplice is Mickey Kostmayer, another covert operator and former Navy SEAL.

At one time or another, Woodward conveyed every emotion in the book playing McCall- menace, savagery, fear, doubt, loneliness, sadness, humor, joy, etc... The Elizabethan-trained actor had the talent to play such a complex role, and he did to the hilt, and the great supporting cast and numerous guest stars did nothing to hurt the appeal or attractiveness of the series.

Having The Equalizer come out on DVD whets one's appetite for the planned feature film, but whoever plays Robert McCall will have large shoes to fill, and many great memories to overcome.",1195603200,103,1238,5.088669950738916
3028374,5,B000YENUOK,"The Equalizer, with its distinctive theme song, written by Stewart Copeland, founder and drummer of The Police, premiered in September of 1985.  It was, almost certainly, one of the better shows to come out of the 1980s.  The gritty, ""street-smart"" aura of the series, which ran for four seasons, in many ways encapsulated the ""pulse"" or the ""feel"" of life in New York City during this seminal decade.  This said, those watching the show today will be impressed by how well it holds up and remains contemporary more than 20 years on.

Edward Woodward's ""made-for-the role"" presence as retired Cold War operative Robert McCall, ""The Equalizer,"" infused a razor-sharp energy into the series, complemented by a regular supporting cast that included Robert Lansing as ""Control,"" Keith Szarabajka as Mickey Kostmayer, Mark Margolis as Jimmy, William Zabka as son Scott McCall, and Richard Jordan as Harley Gage.

Many other well-known actors also made guest appearances on the show, including Jerry Stiller, Vincent D'Onofrio, Robert Mitchum, Adam Ant, Christian Slater, John Polito, Macauley Culkin, Melissa Sue Anderson, Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys, John Goodman, Laurence Fishburne, David Alan Grier, Michael Moriarty, Tony Shalhoub, Roma Maffia, Telly Savalas, Steve Buscemi, Kim Delaney, Sylvia Sidney, Quentin Crisp, Anthony Zerbe, Joe Morton, Lori Petty, Luis Guzman, Robert Davi, William Atherton, Frances Fisher, Patricia Clarkson, Dann Florek, Laurie Metcalf, Bradley Whitford, Ray Sharkey, Dana Barron, Jasmine Guy, Austin Pendleton, Saul Rubinek, Joe Maruzzo, Robert Joy, Burt Young, Mark Linn-Baker, Lauren Tom, Ilan Mitchell-Smith, Alex Winter, Meat Loaf, David Leisure, Christine Baranski, Charles Dutton, Dan Hedaya, Tovah Feldshuh, Marisa Berenson, Brad Dourif, Melissa Joan Hart, James Eckhouse and more.

3028379,4,B000YENUOK,"It is fun to see New York and some of today's well-known actors 31 years ago.  Not quite as well-written as today's shows generally are.  In nearly every case, a CCW License and a pistol for the victim (with training) would have better solved the problem.  (It is not clear whether New York City was as anti-gun in the hands of law-abiding citizens as it is today.  Today they would be arresting Robert McCall.)  Filmed before cell phones, calls every hour to an answering machine would not really have protected anyone from immediate danger (same problem with relying on the police.)  New York had over 7 million people at the time, however, he managed to have no more than one or two matters going on at the same time, and was always able to arrive in time.  Not too realistic but still enjoyable entertainment.  It would have been better if someone with some knowledge had taken the time to teach Edward Woodward to actually handle firearms (move nothing but your trigger finger not your whole arm when firing a rifle, keep your thumb from in back of the slide on a pistol, squeeze the trigger on the pistol while holding it steady, for instance.  But, still good.",1478822400,,1167,4.599033816425121

And some of the music has been changed (I swear that 80s song Wild Wild West was in one of the season 1 episodes). But its still a great series with great characters. I just wish this show had the serial format and mythology of shows of the 1990s and 21st century - so many great villains or spy operations from McCall's past only show up for one episode and then never get mentioned again. Even Woodward's UK show Callan, with its low budget (video for inside shots, film for outside shots just like old school Doctor Who) managed to come up with a mythology and the occasional reoccuring villain. But still a GREAT show and much much better than that Denzel reboot (was hoping it would be way more faithful to the original).",1431129600,,807,4.386666666666667

As an editiorial wirter-Op-Ed columnist with the New York Daily News when the series aired in the mid-1980s, I can attest to its gritty, true-life depictions of Mahnattan. The city-scapes -- including the grafitti-covered subway cars of those days -- are simply phenomenal.

This series also features many fine actors as guest stars. I highly recommend it -- especially to those who are unfamilar with New York City.",1428451200,,590,5.082474226804123

We loved the The Equalizer movie (2014), and the ending hinted at a sequel or a series. After Googling it we were excited to find that the movie was based on a TV show from the 80's.

We ordered season one with the expectation that we could have 4 seasons of quality entertainment. However, we were quite disappointed.

I was raised on 1980's television. However, my tastes and preferences have evolved over the years. The acting is so-so, the characters are shallow and stereotypical, the writing is predictable, and the action just does not live up to today's standards.  Even leaving out the higher production qualities, Denzel's Equalizer was superior in every way.

These DVD's might be entertaining for someone who still loves 1980's television. We really wanted to enjoy this show, but after suffering through the first two episodes, we could not bring ourselves to watch another.",1421452800,,955,4.906832298136646

When I purchased this back in Sep. 2014 it was only selling for $11.49 so I jumped on it and bought it.  The price has probably increased due to the Denzel Washington ""Equalizer"" movie being released.  Honestly, I would wait until Amazon drops the price eventually down to a reasonable level such as $20 or less.  It had some good episodes in there but I wouldn't agree that it is worth paying $25 to own and that is because I have watched the whole season.

3028448,5,B000YENUOK,"I love this series. The Equalizer was a series 88 episodes that ran from 1985 to 1989. A former covert operations officer for the ""Agency"" named Robert McCall and played by Edward Woodward runs a newspaper ad: ""Odds against you? Need help? Call the Equalizer. 212 555 4200."" Basically, The Equalizer helped people who could not get help or for whom the system simply could not help. That's where the Equalizer stepped in. In the series the ""Agency"" would always pop up from time to time. Was McCall completely out of the agency or not? In the series McCall always came up against the baddest of the bad. A lot of the violence was implied because of the constraints of the television medium but the audience always wanted to see these bad guys put down. McCall was essentially a blunt instrument getting the job done and we all loved it. I still love it.",1414972800,,853,4.545454545454546

3028456,5,B000YENUOK,There has never been a television show with the depth that this show had. Season one is a great way to introduce yourself to a thinking man's hero. No he isn't some young man dashing around leaping from building to building. He's a middle aged guy who has a sense of fair play and puts it to use along with his friends. Edward Woodward plays Robert McCall cool and calculating as the hero. A man who puts to use all of his skills from his days working for the CIA in the Company against the bad guys. He thinks with his mind and when force must be used he uses it to defeat those that would harm others. Take the time to purchase this great first season of The Equalizer.

The credits include impressive guest stars as well as beginning actors who have gone on to bigger and better things but, the acting (directing?) is terrible and the stories are predictable.  The ""fight"" scenes are laughable.  As someone who lived in NY in the 80s, I don't find the depiction of the city realistic at all.  It's a bunch of inane caricatures of both the people and the city itself.  My fond memories of this series have forever been tainted by rewatching this show.",1412035200,,573,4.524271844660194

3028494,5,B000YENUOK,"One of the best TV series ever made.  It's a shame it was only on for four seasons, but wow...............those seasons.  I just heard that the long-awaited ""The Equalizer"" movie will be out in 2014, directed by Antoine Fuqua and staring Denzel Washington.  The sneak peaks at the teasers look like it's probably a good film.  However, it shifts to Boston instead of NYC and Washington, while one of the greatest actors ever, will have large shoes to fill to play Robert McCall.  Edward Woodward was absolutely supurb in the role.  ""The Equalizer"" prefered to use brain over brawn most times and use elaborate ruses and schemes to manipulate the bad guys into deep-sixing themselves.  However, Robert McCall never hesitated to use violence if the situation called for it.  The bad guys always under estimated McCall..........that was his strength. The bad guys never knew what hit them until it was way too late!

The one complaint is against UNIVERSAL, not this series.  Season 1 was released in 2008 and then NOTHING.....for six years.  Then we find out Season two will be out in 2014 but from another studio that purchased the rights to the DVD releases?  Perhaps that's just as well, because Season one, while quite excellent in content, is flawed in the execution.  The transfer to DVD was very sloppy and the video / audio quality not very good.  Universal should be ashamed of themselves for not giving this excellent series the attention it deserves.  We can only hope that the new studio that owns the rights does a better job on Seasons 2,3 and 4.  My hope is that new digital masters will be made to soup up the video quality.  The only season that was in stereo was Season 4, so maybe the audio will at least be better on that one.  One can only wonder WHY this series was not released on CBS/Paramount home video, since this was in fact a CBS series?  Universal Studios certainly didn't do ""The Equalizer"" any favors.

However................SOMETHING for Season 1 is better than nothing, so on that basis, I'd recommend it!  Maybe at some point in the future somebody will re-master Season 1 and do a better job.",1401840000,,2126,4.7228260869565215

3028505,4,B000YENUOK,"I remembered this series after recognizing Edward Woodward as the Ghost of Christmas present in George C. Scotts's ""A Christmas Carol."" The Equalizer was a delightful blip in a mass of forgettable TV series in the 1980's. People care, justice is handed 'round, and there really are heroes in Manhattan.",1392336000,,302,5.06
3028506,5,B000YENUOK,"I was a huge fan of The Equalizer when it originally aired in the 80's and I still find it a great show to watch.  The series centers around ex-special agent Robert McCall.  McCall is weary of the treacherous nature of the espionage business and decides to offer his services to average people in trouble who need the odds equalized.  McCall puts an ad in a paper.  As he assists the average New Yorker, he also has to deal with the local authoraties and former colleagues, some of whom he is out of favor with due to his defection from his career.
The first episode has a commentary option from producer creator Jon Sloan. I'm usually not much for dvd commentaries, but I enjoyed the insights in this one - behind the scenes facts of filming the show in New York City and the fact that the network really wanted Robert Loggia or Robert Culp to portray McCall.
I really can't think of another actor as The Equalizer.  Woodward gives McCall a charisma.  McCall is an agent that is damn good at what he does but far from infallible.  There's a human element quite present in McCall as he attempts to mend his relationship with his son who resents a formerly absent father.
I've enjoyed a lot of Edward Woodward's roles - he was great in the Australian movie, Breaker Morant.  Woodward deserves a lot of credit, he is the show's sole star throughtout the series run.  There are many memorable re-occuring characters.  While I would classify the show as a drama, there certainly are elements of action and suspense throughout the episodes.
The show makes great use of New York as a back drop.  The city exudes urban paranoia as well as a sense of the wonderful perks of life in the big city.
Another plus in the mix of The Equalizer is its soundtrack from former Police band member Stewart Copeland.  The music is a thriving force within the show, adding an edge of excitement and mood.
I distinctly remember my enthusiasim at the start of each new show, commencing with the series' memorable theme and opening montage of scenes.  Watching the dvds, I still get that excitement!",1391299200,,2074,4.572972972972973

3028508,5,B000YENUOK,"The great thing about THE EQUALIZER was that it didn't rely on TV action cliches like guns and fights. Instead, it had to rely on great writing and great storytelling that used brains and savvy, not violence. Of course, there's sufficient action to make the stories exciting, just not the kind of gratuitous, by-the-numbers violence most TV crime shows rely on.

Edward Woodward is totally believable as the retired intelligence operative who decides his time is better spent using his skills to help people in trouble (who for whatever reason can't turn to the authorities), rather than sitting in a rocking chair. Since he has a wealth of experience at outwitting opponents, he always comes up with a brilliant way of outsmarting the bad guys, often by tricking them into outsmarting themselves or playing them off against each other.

In that sense, think of it as an intelligent precursor to the great TNT series, LEVERAGE.",1386460800,,927,4.974193548387097

3028522,5,B000YENUOK,"The TV show was one I used to enjoy back in the 80's which might seem more vintage to some viewers today, but, the background music by Stewart Copeland was new and unique at the time and is something good about the show along with its premise or story line. Edward Woodward the star of the show might not seem like a typical super hero type today as compared to say Jim Caviezel in the now current show ""Person of Interest"", but, both have their own appeal and Interest as far as actors in very similar situations, only much different time periods.  I like them both as TV shows go, but having lived through the 80's I like the step back to a lesser high tech society than we have now which borders on Orwellian predictions in the novel ""1984"". We now live the 80's or future time depicted in the novel and the real 80's was a bit tame in high tech comparison, although it is interesting to see how things were done in the super sleuth crime stopper world then as compared to now.  Overall it's fun entertainment anyway, which is what it should be.  The intro theme music and film montage are very suspenseful.

3028539,5,B000YENUOK,"Edward Woodward stars as Robert McCall, veteran intelligence officer, out to make up for years of personal regret at the evil-doing in his own career. Now he earns little money on a mission to work for the poor and vulnerable, people whose lives are being ruined by career criminals. So far, so good - but in the wrong hands (and this was network TV, not cable) this could have been a forgettable, cliche-ridden mess, depicting McCall as a kind of driven 'super hero'. But no!

The Equalizer was a show that avoided all of the usual crime and cop show traps, including car chases, cheesy dialogue and cardboard bad guys. Instead, we have McCall actually using his brain before storming off with a gun in his pocket - weighing up the odds, looking ahead at the consequences. Within minutes, you bought into the character and trusted the show.

Not that The Equalizer didn't deliver its quota of grit and menace - it was, after all, notorious for its violence, and given a later than usual TV slot. The violence was neither gratuitous, nor cartoonish. Think French Connection urban roughness, and revel in an age when prime time network TV had any interest in 'doing something different'.

Note: Seasons 2 and 3 are now available in the UK on region 2 DVD. The third season of The Equalizer has a special bonus: ROBERT MITCHUM, legendary Hollywood tough guy, bad boy and all-round fantastic actor, appears in two episodes [Mission: McCall part 1 and part 2] as an exceptionally cool spy (well, it is Mitchum, after all). Tantalizing to see him in a show like this - too bad no one had the creative impulse to devise a show like this for Mitchum at that point of his career. US fans have waited long enough for an offical release of the later seasons of The Equalizer. This great show deserves it.",1335744000,5,1794,4.617554858934169

The show is entertaining and uplifting.  He adds a touch of class by driving a Jaguar, which in many neighborhoods he visits, I'm sure, in real life, he would have to defend, for himself!

Yes, they did change the internal music, generally for the worse--but it's still a good show, and the theme music is still excellent.

Season 1 has been available for two years now. There are enough reviews here for me to assume that quite a few people have bought it, and certainly enough time has passed for the DVD release of at least some of the others to happen in the normal course of things.

3028564,5,B000YENUOK,"In the 80s, the era of Miami Vice and Riptide, Equalizer stood out from the pack of shoot-em-ups with a more cerebral brand of crime solving.  It started with a premise that all of us can sympathize with: A powerful guy helping out the little guy.  Though it featured top-notch talent on all fronts, it was never truly appreciated on the TV circuit.  Though the episodes hold up beautifully today, I dare say that today's quickie television execs wouldn't give it enough of a chance to survive.

Do yourselves a favor and treat yourselves to this series.  If you like Burn Notice, you'll love this.  Edward Woodward is incontestably the best actor in England, possibly the world.  Pair him with a cast of self-proclaimed misfit followers and you have a winning combination.  From the die-hard attitude of Mickey, to the stoic and menacing aura of Control, the ensemble works perfectly.  The writing is tight, the plots cutting-edge, and despite the change in technology in the past 25 years, the tales always vibrate with a deep humanistic chord.

He has all the knowledge and connections he needs to do anything along with vast experience from his years with ""The Company"".  The collection is a 2008 release of a TV series from the 1980""s.  Golden Globe winner Edward Woodward stars as Special Agent Robert McCall, retired and turned into a sort of private detective.  Woodward does an outstanding job as he uses his special secret agent training, experience, and contacts to help those who don't know where else to turn.  As a private citizen, McCall often bends the system to do things the police cannot legally do.  On a mission to ""pay back"" in a special way for his lifetime of killing for the government, he helps those in need, usually for no fee at all.  You get the impression that McCall has acquired so much money over the years that he doesn't need to make any more.

1) Pilot: The Equalizer (1  hours?)
The Pilot of the TV series takes place primarily on the streets of Manhattan as McCall, recently retired as a Secret Agent from a secret government organization (CIA?), runs a newspaper advertisement to help people in need.  He calls himself ""The Equalizer"" because when the odds are against you, he seeks to ""equalize"" them.  In the pilot, McCall gets involved with a woman being stalked by a fruitcake and a man who finds a secret code at the telecommunications company where he works.  Both are in danger.  The pilot includes a car chase as well as some Manhattan scenery.  You also meet ""Control"" and the Equalizer's son ""Scott"".  A commentary with the show's creator, Michael Sloan, is included.
2)  China Rain (approx 50 minutes)
In this episode, a 5-year old Chinese boy is kidnapped and McCall is called for help.  This episode introduces character Mickey Klausmeyer, as Mickey and McCall go into the skuzzy parts of Chinatown to rescue the boy.
3)  The Defector
McCall steps in to protect a murdered secret agent's daughter in this episode.  He also helps a young man deal with high-school bullies.
4)  The Lock Box
I remember seeing this episode several times before.  A family of 3 goes on vacation to NYC and become quickly dis-enchanted with NY.  Then, the young pretty teenage daughter, 17-year old Edie from Diluth, is kidnapped by 2 men playing good guy/bad guy.  They are seeking to make a plaything out of her for those willing to pay the price.  The police are no help and the mom calls McCall for help.

3028572,5,B000YENUOK,Wonderful trip down Memory Lane - the show was my favorite at the time.  Interesting to look back so many years later and laugh at the 80's and reconsider it all from an older perspective.,1222646400,,188,4.371428571428571
3028573,5,B000YENUOK,"This is a long-awaited DVD release of one of the best TV series ever created.
However, it seems that some of the episodes are ""cropped"", in that the originals were filmed in a different, theatrical aspect ratio than the standard TV screen (the opening titles are askew on many of them).  The quality of the cinematography would seem to support this as well.  It would be great if these episodes could be released in widescreen option.
I agree that more special features are desired - more behind the scenes and commentaries would be great, esp. from Mr. Woodward.",1221004800,2,563,4.73469387755102
3028574,5,B000YENUOK,The Equalizer was always one of my favorite shows in the 80s but I forgot how much I enjoyed these shows. I've never seen all the episodes including the first three I've watched so far in Season One. I'm rationing this first season as I don't want to run out before season two becomes available. They're that good! Bring on the seasons 2 through 4. 88 total episodes. Can't wait to watch the other 85. By then it will be time to watch them again!!!,1220227200,,448,4.2823529411764705

3028577,3,B000YENUOK,The eighties were full of series. Mainly Miami Vice dominated this era but The Equalizer was a series for people who liked good old fashioned stories. An Ex Agent tries to help people in different dangerous situations. Edward Woodward was cool as ice as the main character. But be warned if you buy this set. As i researched mainly because of right problems the Music in this box differs from the original episodes. It was changed for this release. So if you are not a hard core fan this set is for you to go. If you are it's better to stay away and look for the R2 set which was released in Europe.,1212451200,41,599,4.2631578947368425
3028578,5,B000YENUOK,As a long time fan of the Equalizer I've waited as many others have for this show to come out of DVD!  It's about time!  Many of the shows I used to watch in the 1980's I was disappointed in seeing now.  Not this show!  It is everything I remember and I can't wait for the other seasons to come out on DVD especially with episodes that didn't usually run on syndicated television!  I can't recommend this highly enough!,1212105600,,419,4.253164556962025

3028582,5,B000YENUOK,"After 20 years, this still remains my favorite show. In many ways, it's hard to see how CBS ever bought into this concept-they certainly wouldn't today. Ex-spy, past 50, overweight, quasi-vigilante, shown in plots with multiple weaves in them and a superb, avant-garde sountrack. Impossible. With all that though, what truly made the show was Robert Lansing. His character, Control, gave the show such a spooky(ok, pun intended) realism with his very intense, yet off-hand outlandishness that it made the whole concept plausible or, at the very least, great fun. I do hope that the entire series gets done and that we might hear from Edward Woodward on some future commentary tracks.",1209254400,11,683,5.107142857142857

3028584,5,B000YENUOK,It will probably never sell huge numbers but the show has a decent following and with this first season set it is a great package.

3028587,5,B000YENUOK,"I was always facinated by Edward Woodard and his ability to pull off this below level swashbuckler character Robert McCall. As a fan of the ""concept"" I was always disappointed when the show was supposed to be on but didn't actually show up on the television, in the time slot, on the same day, etc. so to get a copy of any of this material is kinda like Christmas in March. I have enjoyed 3 discs so far and will continue to watch and rewatch these classic Equalizer episodes. I love the one liners like when Control tells him not to do this kinda thing and he is dead set on it, ""Well, it's your funeral."" ""Yes, and I'll be there."" His Jaguar only makes me wish he was an American actor named Nick Mancuso, in a similar role that also appeared and disappeared just as quickly called Stingray.

The running time of  episode 6 (Confirmation Day) is only 46 minutes where all the other episodes I have watched so far (1-8) run about 48 1/2 minutes.

3028591,5,B000YENUOK,"Terrific news....The Equalizer is out on DVD!
This series was just terrific and touched a nerve when it originally ran.  What isn't to like? An older gentleman trying to get his karma correct by offering to help those in society who can't seem to get the police to listen or fall through the cracks one way or another. Who hasn't needed a big brother to help us at one time in our life?  The pilot suffers from less than  stellar acting and  production but by the time the actual episodes came out the acting was terrific , the production values great and the stories wonderful.

The DVD set review.  First off...to those unhappy with the packaging I'd like to say that in the past Universal has demonstrated their ability to make  sexy packages and  terrible product so the reverse is welcome.  The fairly nondescript package hold 5 single sided dual layer DVDs...and this is great news to all of us who know of  Universals penchant  for  double sided flipper discs that freeze and  skip!  The episodes look great as well.  This series seems to have been filmed rather than video taped which many of that era sadly were...so they look good.  Did I  mention that the show also featured some fun gunplay?  Yeah...its all good
an interview with Edward Woodward would have been terrific but I'm  just glad to have a solid DVD set of the first year and looking for more!
order without worries..

OOOPS..I almost forgot. This show also featured arguably one of the all time  best  opening  sequences highlighted by the brilliant theme  music composed  by Stewart Copeland  (The Police), guaranteed  to be pulse quickkening!",1203292800,26,1618,4.726618705035971
3028592,5,B000YENUOK,"Great Show - Great Dvd Season Box Set!!!

Now, I can relive the first season of one of my favorite shows, replete with Stuart Copeland's fantastic music, and highlighted by the quirky performance of occasional ""also starring"" Keith Szarabajka.",1203120000,2,346,4.88135593220339
3028594,5,B000YENUOK,"As you can surmise, a great many of us have been waiting a very long time for this to be released on DVD. The Equalizer was new and fresh and unlike anything else on TV at the time. Edward Woodward was the perfect choice for the role as he gave the character a different feel than we'd expect. He added great depth and complexity as a man fighting evil doers as he fought his own dark past. The writing, the locations, even the music demanded your attention! This was no ordinary TV show. I can't wait for the rest of the seasons to become available! Thanks for finally releasing this video! It's about time!",1202947200,3,608,4.342105263157895
3262862,5,B000YENUOK,"Edward Woodward starred in a television show in Britain long before the Equalizer hit the streets of New York. The show was called 'Callan' and in many ways established his reputation. His character was a no nonsense assassin for the British government with psychological problems who was the best at what he did. While the drama series was less than well funded it was extremely realistic and cold blooded. Callous would have been an appropriate name.

Having said this by way of pertinent background, we see a revamped secret agent, retired, living in New York and trying, at his own expense, to compensate for his deadly dealings in the past.

This, stylish thriller, finally seeing the light of day in it's DVD release, is an accurate portrayal of New York in the eighties. In many ways it is a sad commentary on life in the Big Apple, if not a cry from the heart on behalf of the suffering citizenry.

It is my understanding too that the sleek Jaguar which carries the agent, McCall, around town sparked a wave of buying of the marque as the show took hold, a much better buy than today's model.

However, I digress. These stories are excellent and remind us of situations which will not be missed. The acting, and plots are generally of extremely high standard in the main although personally, I find the stories involving the son more than a little tedious. All in all though an excellent addition to anyone's collection. Hopefully the powers that be will see fit to add Callan to the future release list.",1202860800,14,1512,4.672932330827067

I hope it doesn't stop at season one and we eventually see all episodes out on DVD- I'll be buying every one.

Kudos to everyone who worked on bringing this show to us- it truly has been one of the greats and has stuck in my brain all these years.",1201824000,3,423,4.072289156626506
3262864,5,B000YENUOK,"How come the box art is so generic? You'd never know what the program is going by that. They could have at least made the cover look authentic to the program with silhouette and classic red logo. It's tarnishing the vigilante image of a well recognized series that any child of mid 80's MTV generation would remember. Mostly because The Police's drummer did the series theme.

3262866,5,B000YENUOK,"Every night after work I would rush home to make sure that I did not miss the Equalizer during its first run episodes.  After purchasing a VCR I then made sure that I recorded every episode that I could when it played on the USA Network.

  The Equalizer was my favorite show on television.  It dug deep into the soul of Robert McCall, a former CIA operative.  The show was thought provoking, historical, Cold War-ish, and had excellent plots and fantastic endings.  I have yet to find a television series with endings as well done 20 years later.

  McCall, Control, Mickey and the gang were fun to watch.  They were good at their craft and did what was right.  Sometimes, as in Control, he would ultimately do what was right. It showed a lot of people some of the ins and outs of the intelligence field by displaying that there was not always a black and white to everything.

  When the Equalizer movie planned for 2009 gets cast I can only hope that the role of the Equalizer is given to actor Michael Madsen.  His starring role in the series Vengeance Unlimited was very similar to that of the charachter Robert McCall.  He was Mr. Chappell, a mystery man with a very dark and unknown past.  He fought for those that were treated poorly by the system.  He sought justice.  Vengeance Unlimited was cancelled way before its time.  Imagine the plot stories that were discarded.  I wanted so much to know more about what made Mr. Chappell become what he was.  I do not remember the name of the lady in charge of ABC's network programming that year but she cancelled a lot of shows that I liked and then she lost her job.  Please, someone get Vengeance Unlimited onto DVD release!  It is a classic.",1197849600,5,1698,4.470588235294118

Nothing tops this series. with the lead actor at his apex form, he tantalized me with his every cunning move and killer instinct precision. though it was just a series, it made me a believer of the vigilante squad.

3262870,5,B000YENUOK,"To Europeans and foreign film fans, Edward Woodward will always be remembered for playing the title role in ""Breaker Morant."" But to American television watchers, he will be remembered for playing Robert McCall, the wily and dangerous ex-covert operative in ""The Equalizer.""

McCall is a former CIA-type (and at least one episode hints at him being a former mercenary) who has devoted all he has to his career, losing his marriage and distancing himself from his young son in the process. He decides to quit the espionage business and work as a vigilante, helping people in distress. His occasional accomplice is Mickey Kostmayer, another covert operator and former Navy SEAL.

At one time or another, Woodward conveyed every emotion in the book playing McCall- menace, savagery, fear, doubt, loneliness, sadness, humor, joy, etc... The Elizabethan-trained actor had the talent to play such a complex role, and he did to the hilt, and the great supporting cast and numerous guest stars did nothing to hurt the appeal or attractiveness of the series.

Having The Equalizer come out on DVD whets one's appetite for the planned feature film, but whoever plays Robert McCall will have large shoes to fill, and many great memories to overcome.",1195603200,103,1238,5.088669950738916
3262871,5,B000YENUOK,"The Equalizer, with its distinctive theme song, written by Stewart Copeland, founder and drummer of The Police, premiered in September of 1985.  It was, almost certainly, one of the better shows to come out of the 1980s.  The gritty, ""street-smart"" aura of the series, which ran for four seasons, in many ways encapsulated the ""pulse"" or the ""feel"" of life in New York City during this seminal decade.  This said, those watching the show today will be impressed by how well it holds up and remains contemporary more than 20 years on.

Edward Woodward's ""made-for-the role"" presence as retired Cold War operative Robert McCall, ""The Equalizer,"" infused a razor-sharp energy into the series, complemented by a regular supporting cast that included Robert Lansing as ""Control,"" Keith Szarabajka as Mickey Kostmayer, Mark Margolis as Jimmy, William Zabka as son Scott McCall, and Richard Jordan as Harley Gage.

Many other well-known actors also made guest appearances on the show, including Jerry Stiller, Vincent D'Onofrio, Robert Mitchum, Adam Ant, Christian Slater, John Polito, Macauley Culkin, Melissa Sue Anderson, Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys, John Goodman, Laurence Fishburne, David Alan Grier, Michael Moriarty, Tony Shalhoub, Roma Maffia, Telly Savalas, Steve Buscemi, Kim Delaney, Sylvia Sidney, Quentin Crisp, Anthony Zerbe, Joe Morton, Lori Petty, Luis Guzman, Robert Davi, William Atherton, Frances Fisher, Patricia Clarkson, Dann Florek, Laurie Metcalf, Bradley Whitford, Ray Sharkey, Dana Barron, Jasmine Guy, Austin Pendleton, Saul Rubinek, Joe Maruzzo, Robert Joy, Burt Young, Mark Linn-Baker, Lauren Tom, Ilan Mitchell-Smith, Alex Winter, Meat Loaf, David Leisure, Christine Baranski, Charles Dutton, Dan Hedaya, Tovah Feldshuh, Marisa Berenson, Brad Dourif, Melissa Joan Hart, James Eckhouse and more.

3262876,4,B000YENUOK,"It is fun to see New York and some of today's well-known actors 31 years ago.  Not quite as well-written as today's shows generally are.  In nearly every case, a CCW License and a pistol for the victim (with training) would have better solved the problem.  (It is not clear whether New York City was as anti-gun in the hands of law-abiding citizens as it is today.  Today they would be arresting Robert McCall.)  Filmed before cell phones, calls every hour to an answering machine would not really have protected anyone from immediate danger (same problem with relying on the police.)  New York had over 7 million people at the time, however, he managed to have no more than one or two matters going on at the same time, and was always able to arrive in time.  Not too realistic but still enjoyable entertainment.  It would have been better if someone with some knowledge had taken the time to teach Edward Woodward to actually handle firearms (move nothing but your trigger finger not your whole arm when firing a rifle, keep your thumb from in back of the slide on a pistol, squeeze the trigger on the pistol while holding it steady, for instance.

And some of the music has been changed (I swear that 80s song Wild Wild West was in one of the season 1 episodes). But its still a great series with great characters. I just wish this show had the serial format and mythology of shows of the 1990s and 21st century - so many great villains or spy operations from McCall's past only show up for one episode and then never get mentioned again. Even Woodward's UK show Callan, with its low budget (video for inside shots, film for outside shots just like old school Doctor Who) managed to come up with a mythology and the occasional reoccuring villain. But still a GREAT show and much much better than that Denzel reboot (was hoping it would be way more faithful to the original).",1431129600,,807,4.386666666666667

3262906,5,B000YENUOK,"Edward Woodward -- who was sensational in ""The Wicker Man"" (1973) and ""Breaker Morant"" (1980) -- soldified his position as one of my very favorite actors in ""The Equalizer."" As an editiorial wirter-Op-Ed columnist with the New York Daily News when the series aired in the mid-1980s, I can attest to its gritty, true-life depictions of Mahnattan. The city-scapes -- including the grafitti-covered subway cars of those days -- are simply phenomenal.

This series also features many fine actors as guest stars. I highly recommend it -- especially to those who are unfamilar with New York City.",1428451200,,590,5.082474226804123

3262922,2,B000YENUOK,"If you loved the Denzel Washington movie - do NOT order this show!

We loved the The Equalizer movie (2014), and the ending hinted at a sequel or a series. After Googling it we were excited to find that the movie was based on a TV show from the 80's.

We ordered season one with the expectation that we could have 4 seasons of quality entertainment. However, we were quite disappointed.

I was raised on 1980's television. However, my tastes and preferences have evolved over the years. The acting is so-so, the characters are shallow and stereotypical, the writing is predictable, and the action just does not live up to today's standards.  Even leaving out the higher production qualities, Denzel's Equalizer was superior in every way.

These DVD's might be entertaining for someone who still loves 1980's television. We really wanted to enjoy this show, but after suffering through the first two episodes, we could not bring ourselves to watch another.",1421452800,,955,4.906832298136646

Denzile  carries an up to date version well, and style and interpretation are him and not Woodward, AS IT Should BE!  See the foot steps he had to follow in.",1420588800,,352,4.4

3262926,4,B000YENUOK,"It had some good episodes in there and captions as well.  All in all a quality season and not a bad transfer to dvd. There are no special features and the only extra is an episode called ""Beyond Control"" which is on the Season 2 release.  When I purchased this back in Sep. 2014 it was only selling for $11.49 so I jumped on it and bought it.  The price has probably increased due to the Denzel Washington ""Equalizer"" movie being released.  Honestly, I would wait until Amazon drops the price eventually down to a reasonable level such as $20 or less.  It had some good episodes in there but I wouldn't agree that it is worth paying $25 to own and that is because I have watched the whole season.  Hope that helps someone!",1419984000,,722,4.311111111111111

To be frank, the series started off with great promise as a suspense-packed, heavy-hitting show, but soon denigrated into bland tedium! Being spoilt by the exceptional quality of the best shows of THE GOLDEN AGE OF TELEVISION, ""The Equalizer"" pales in comparison, although by post-1980 standards it probably ranks alright! For the right price, the purchase of this DVD might be a good investment to wile away time in the pursuit of what passes for entertainment!",1419638400,,546,4.945652173913044

3262945,5,B000YENUOK,"I love this series. The Equalizer was a series 88 episodes that ran from 1985 to 1989. A former covert operations officer for the ""Agency"" named Robert McCall and played by Edward Woodward runs a newspaper ad: ""Odds against you? Need help? Call the Equalizer. 212 555 4200."" Basically, The Equalizer helped people who could not get help or for whom the system simply could not help. That's where the Equalizer stepped in. In the series the ""Agency"" would always pop up from time to time. Was McCall completely out of the agency or not? In the series McCall always came up against the baddest of the bad. A lot of the violence was implied because of the constraints of the television medium but the audience always wanted to see these bad guys put down. McCall was essentially a blunt instrument getting the job done and we all loved it. I still love it.",1414972800,,853,4.545454545454546

No he isn't some young man dashing around leaping from building to building. He's a middle aged guy who has a sense of fair play and puts it to use along with his friends. Edward Woodward plays Robert McCall cool and calculating as the hero. A man who puts to use all of his skills from his days working for the CIA in the Company against the bad guys. He thinks with his mind and when force must be used he uses it to defeat those that would harm others. Take the time to purchase this great first season of The Equalizer.

The credits include impressive guest stars as well as beginning actors who have gone on to bigger and better things but, the acting (directing?) is terrible and the stories are predictable.  The ""fight"" scenes are laughable.  As someone who lived in NY in the 80s, I don't find the depiction of the city realistic at all.  It's a bunch of inane caricatures of both the people and the city itself.  My fond memories of this series have forever been tainted by rewatching this show.",1412035200,,573,4.524271844660194

3262991,5,B000YENUOK,"One of the best TV series ever made.  It's a shame it was only on for four seasons, but wow...............those seasons.  I just heard that the long-awaited ""The Equalizer"" movie will be out in 2014, directed by Antoine Fuqua and staring Denzel Washington.  The sneak peaks at the teasers look like it's probably a good film.  However, it shifts to Boston instead of NYC and Washington, while one of the greatest actors ever, will have large shoes to fill to play Robert McCall.  Edward Woodward was absolutely supurb in the role.  ""The Equalizer"" prefered to use brain over brawn most times and use elaborate ruses and schemes to manipulate the bad guys into deep-sixing themselves.  However, Robert McCall never hesitated to use violence if the situation called for it.  The bad guys always under estimated McCall..........that was his strength. The bad guys never knew what hit them until it was way too late!

The one complaint is against UNIVERSAL, not this series.  Season 1 was released in 2008 and then NOTHING.....for six years.  Then we find out Season two will be out in 2014 but from another studio that purchased the rights to the DVD releases?  Perhaps that's just as well, because Season one, while quite excellent in content, is flawed in the execution.  The transfer to DVD was very sloppy and the video / audio quality not very good.  Universal should be ashamed of themselves for not giving this excellent series the attention it deserves.  We can only hope that the new studio that owns the rights does a better job on Seasons 2,3 and 4.  My hope is that new digital masters will be made to soup up the video quality.  The only season that was in stereo was Season 4, so maybe the audio will at least be better on that one.  One can only wonder WHY this series was not released on CBS/Paramount home video, since this was in fact a CBS series?  Universal Studios certainly didn't do ""The Equalizer"" any favors.

However................SOMETHING for Season 1 is better than nothing, so on that basis, I'd recommend it!  Maybe at some point in the future somebody will re-master Season 1 and do a better job.",1401840000,,2126,4.7228260869565215

3263002,4,B000YENUOK,"I remembered this series after recognizing Edward Woodward as the Ghost of Christmas present in George C. Scotts's ""A Christmas Carol."" The Equalizer was a delightful blip in a mass of forgettable TV series in the 1980's. People care, justice is handed 'round, and there really are heroes in Manhattan.",1392336000,,302,5.06
3263003,5,B000YENUOK,"I was a huge fan of The Equalizer when it originally aired in the 80's and I still find it a great show to watch.  The series centers around ex-special agent Robert McCall.  McCall is weary of the treacherous nature of the espionage business and decides to offer his services to average people in trouble who need the odds equalized.  McCall puts an ad in a paper.  As he assists the average New Yorker, he also has to deal with the local authoraties and former colleagues, some of whom he is out of favor with due to his defection from his career.
The first episode has a commentary option from producer creator Jon Sloan. I'm usually not much for dvd commentaries, but I enjoyed the insights in this one - behind the scenes facts of filming the show in New York City and the fact that the network really wanted Robert Loggia or Robert Culp to portray McCall.
I really can't think of another actor as The Equalizer.  Woodward gives McCall a charisma.  McCall is an agent that is damn good at what he does but far from infallible.  There's a human element quite present in McCall as he attempts to mend his relationship with his son who resents a formerly absent father.
I've enjoyed a lot of Edward Woodward's roles - he was great in the Australian movie, Breaker Morant.  Woodward deserves a lot of credit, he is the show's sole star throughtout the series run.  There are many memorable re-occuring characters.  While I would classify the show as a drama, there certainly are elements of action and suspense throughout the episodes.
The show makes great use of New York as a back drop.  The city exudes urban paranoia as well as a sense of the wonderful perks of life in the big city.
Another plus in the mix of The Equalizer is its soundtrack from former Police band member Stewart Copeland.  The music is a thriving force within the show, adding an edge of excitement and mood.
I distinctly remember my enthusiasim at the start of each new show, commencing with the series' memorable theme and opening montage of scenes.  Watching the dvds, I still get that excitement!",1391299200,,2074,4.572972972972973
3263004,5,B000YENUOK,"I loved this series. I loved every one of the characters, particularly Edward Woodward's.  Robert McCall is a hero. Can't express how much I miss it (and yes, I do have the DVD).",1388016000,,178,4.393939393939394
3263005,5,B000YENUOK,"The great thing about THE EQUALIZER was that it didn't rely on TV action cliches like guns and fights. Instead, it had to rely on great writing and great storytelling that used brains and savvy, not violence. Of course, there's sufficient action to make the stories exciting, just not the kind of gratuitous, by-the-numbers violence most TV crime shows rely on.

Edward Woodward is totally believable as the retired intelligence operative who decides his time is better spent using his skills to help people in trouble (who for whatever reason can't turn to the authorities), rather than sitting in a rocking chair. Since he has a wealth of experience at outwitting opponents, he always comes up with a brilliant way of outsmarting the bad guys, often by tricking them into outsmarting themselves or playing them off against each other.

In that sense, think of it as an intelligent precursor to the great TNT series, LEVERAGE.",1386460800,,927,4.974193548387097

I found this season a few years ago and relived my teenage years while watching it.  This show is one of the best shows on in the 80s.

Edward Woodward the star of the show might not seem like a typical super hero type today as compared to say Jim Caviezel in the now current show ""Person of Interest"", but, both have their own appeal and Interest as far as actors in very similar situations, only much different time periods.  I like them both as TV shows go, but having lived through the 80's I like the step back to a lesser high tech society than we have now which borders on Orwellian predictions in the novel ""1984"". We now live the 80's or future time depicted in the novel and the real 80's was a bit tame in high tech comparison, although it is interesting to see how things were done in the super sleuth crime stopper world then as compared to now.  Overall it's fun entertainment anyway, which is what it should be.  The intro theme music and film montage are very suspenseful.

3263036,5,B000YENUOK,"Edward Woodward stars as Robert McCall, veteran intelligence officer, out to make up for years of personal regret at the evil-doing in his own career. Now he earns little money on a mission to work for the poor and vulnerable, people whose lives are being ruined by career criminals. So far, so good - but in the wrong hands (and this was network TV, not cable) this could have been a forgettable, cliche-ridden mess, depicting McCall as a kind of driven 'super hero'. But no!

The Equalizer was a show that avoided all of the usual crime and cop show traps, including car chases, cheesy dialogue and cardboard bad guys. Instead, we have McCall actually using his brain before storming off with a gun in his pocket - weighing up the odds, looking ahead at the consequences. Within minutes, you bought into the character and trusted the show.

Not that The Equalizer didn't deliver its quota of grit and menace - it was, after all, notorious for its violence, and given a later than usual TV slot. The violence was neither gratuitous, nor cartoonish. Think French Connection urban roughness, and revel in an age when prime time network TV had any interest in 'doing something different'.

Note: Seasons 2 and 3 are now available in the UK on region 2 DVD. The third season of The Equalizer has a special bonus: ROBERT MITCHUM, legendary Hollywood tough guy, bad boy and all-round fantastic actor, appears in two episodes [Mission: McCall part 1 and part 2] as an exceptionally cool spy (well, it is Mitchum, after all). Tantalizing to see him in a show like this - too bad no one had the creative impulse to devise a show like this for Mitchum at that point of his career.

Very grity background scenes of NY and good spins on stories of his attempts to help others. Anyone that likes the 'Hero' type role working for the 'Little Guy' should enjoy this series.

3263054,4,B000YENUOK,"In this day and age of crime. People living in big cities need a man they can call on. The Police are over taxed and need help where can ""you call""? No one until ""The Equalizer"" appears and takes up the cry. Indeed one of the most entertaining shows at that time & era, as well as today. This set sits proudly on my shelf along with other great sets I have. I am a collector. Now I am in Bangkok and we could use his help here too.
Mr. Woodward was a brilliant actor of the stage and of course movies as well. He is sorely missed but not soon forgotten, not be me. I would just bet he was a gentleman's gentleman too.
I wish I knew where to buy the other sets? I have looked and no where to be found. There were four seasons and I would love to own them all.",1276992000,5,758,3.8653846153846154
3263055,5,B000YENUOK,"This was a genuinely enjoyable TV series, far better than the rather unreal 'reality' shows and the over-hyped showcases for mediocre talent that seem to be most of what is being shown today. In particular, the acting was a good step above the usual TV standard, and some real issues were addressed.

Yes, they did change the internal music, generally for the worse--but it's still a good show, and the theme music is still excellent.

Season 1 has been available for two years now. There are enough reviews here for me to assume that quite a few people have bought it, and certainly enough time has passed for the DVD release of at least some of the others to happen in the normal course of things.

So why are the other three seasons not on DVD yet?

Contrary to what a few reviewers have said, in my sample the transfer was well done; the DVDs played flawlessly, and both picture and audio were clear.

If they release it, I will buy.",1275091200,11,937,4.456140350877193

BEWARE! DO NOT BUY the EQUALIZER from this source!
First they don't deliver what they promise. I was promised superb packaging with episode title and info. Each disk has a great Equalizer label on it with a hand written number  in a VHS box each DVD in a plastic CD sleeve. They said that all these were brand new. They had all been PIRATED off of A&E, USA, and PLUS cable channels complete with BAD reception, flipping pictures, and an occasional commerial, plus the announcements over the closing credits to stay tuned to A&E for the next great program. There are some episodes that are just perfect it must have been a good reception day in China. (That's were the DVD were sent from.) I'm going to keep this set because it took me so long to get them and I love this show.

3263061,5,B000YENUOK,"In the 80s, the era of Miami Vice and Riptide, Equalizer stood out from the pack of shoot-em-ups with a more cerebral brand of crime solving.  It started with a premise that all of us can sympathize with: A powerful guy helping out the little guy.  Though it featured top-notch talent on all fronts, it was never truly appreciated on the TV circuit.  Though the episodes hold up beautifully today, I dare say that today's quickie television execs wouldn't give it enough of a chance to survive.

Do yourselves a favor and treat yourselves to this series.  If you like Burn Notice, you'll love this.  Edward Woodward is incontestably the best actor in England, possibly the world.  Pair him with a cast of self-proclaimed misfit followers and you have a winning combination.  From the die-hard attitude of Mickey, to the stoic and menacing aura of Control, the ensemble works perfectly.  The writing is tight, the plots cutting-edge, and despite the change in technology in the past 25 years, the tales always vibrate with a deep humanistic chord.

Having watched this series from a bunch of dubbed DVDs, recorded from late-night showings, I am dying to add this to my collection.  I only hope that it sells well enough to compel them to release the rest of the series.",1247529600,6,1268,4.770642201834862

He ended up getting quit a few clients and ended up helping them in some way or other. Edward Woodward is a very good actor.

3263068,5,B000YENUOK,"5 Disc DVD set.  Crystal clear picture.  The Equalizer is a classy suit and tie guy, a British gentleman, who was trained as a spy and was one of the best agents around.  He has all the knowledge and connections he needs to do anything along with vast experience from his years with ""The Company"".  The collection is a 2008 release of a TV series from the 1980""s.  Golden Globe winner Edward Woodward stars as Special Agent Robert McCall, retired and turned into a sort of private detective.  Woodward does an outstanding job as he uses his special secret agent training, experience, and contacts to help those who don't know where else to turn.  As a private citizen, McCall often bends the system to do things the police cannot legally do.  On a mission to ""pay back"" in a special way for his lifetime of killing for the government, he helps those in need, usually for no fee at all.  You get the impression that McCall has acquired so much money over the years that he doesn't need to make any more.

1) Pilot: The Equalizer (1  hours?)
The Pilot of the TV series takes place primarily on the streets of Manhattan as McCall, recently retired as a Secret Agent from a secret government organization (CIA?), runs a newspaper advertisement to help people in need.  He calls himself ""The Equalizer"" because when the odds are against you, he seeks to ""equalize"" them.  In the pilot, McCall gets involved with a woman being stalked by a fruitcake and a man who finds a secret code at the telecommunications company where he works.  Both are in danger.  The pilot includes a car chase as well as some Manhattan scenery.  You also meet ""Control"" and the Equalizer's son ""Scott"".  A commentary with the show's creator, Michael Sloan, is included.
2)  China Rain (approx 50 minutes)
In this episode, a 5-year old Chinese boy is kidnapped and McCall is called for help.  This episode introduces character Mickey Klausmeyer, as Mickey and McCall go into the skuzzy parts of Chinatown to rescue the boy.
3)  The Defector
McCall steps in to protect a murdered secret agent's daughter in this episode.  He also helps a young man deal with high-school bullies.
4)  The Lock Box
I remember seeing this episode several times before.  A family of 3 goes on vacation to NYC and become quickly dis-enchanted with NY.  Then, the young pretty teenage daughter, 17-year old Edie from Diluth, is kidnapped by 2 men playing good guy/bad guy.  They are seeking to make a plaything out of her for those willing to pay the price.  The police are no help and the mom calls McCall for help.
5)  Lady Cop
6)  The Confirmation Day
7)  The Children's Song

However, it seems that some of the episodes are ""cropped"", in that the originals were filmed in a different, theatrical aspect ratio than the standard TV screen (the opening titles are askew on many of them).  The quality of the cinematography would seem to support this as well.  It would be great if these episodes could be released in widescreen option.

3263074,3,B000YENUOK,The eighties were full of series. Mainly Miami Vice dominated this era but The Equalizer was a series for people who liked good old fashioned stories. An Ex Agent tries to help people in different dangerous situations. Edward Woodward was cool as ice as the main character. But be warned if you buy this set. As i researched mainly because of right problems the Music in this box differs from the original episodes. It was changed for this release.

3263079,5,B000YENUOK,"After 20 years, this still remains my favorite show. In many ways, it's hard to see how CBS ever bought into this concept-they certainly wouldn't today. Ex-spy, past 50, overweight, quasi-vigilante, shown in plots with multiple weaves in them and a superb, avant-garde sountrack. Impossible. With all that though, what truly made the show was Robert Lansing. His character, Control, gave the show such a spooky(ok, pun intended) realism with his very intense, yet off-hand outlandishness that it made the whole concept plausible or, at the very least, great fun.

As a fan of the ""concept"" I was always disappointed when the show was supposed to be on but didn't actually show up on the television, in the time slot, on the same day, etc. so to get a copy of any of this material is kinda like Christmas in March. I have enjoyed 3 discs so far and will continue to watch and rewatch these classic Equalizer episodes. I love the one liners like when Control tells him not to do this kinda thing and he is dead set on it, ""Well, it's your funeral."" ""Yes, and I'll be there."" His Jaguar only makes me wish he was an American actor named Nick Mancuso, in a similar role that also appeared and disappeared just as quickly called Stingray.

3263088,5,B000YENUOK,"Terrific news....The Equalizer is out on DVD!
This series was just terrific and touched a nerve when it originally ran.  What isn't to like? An older gentleman trying to get his karma correct by offering to help those in society who can't seem to get the police to listen or fall through the cracks one way or another. Who hasn't needed a big brother to help us at one time in our life?  The pilot suffers from less than  stellar acting and  production but by the time the actual episodes came out the acting was terrific , the production values great and the stories wonderful.

The DVD set review.  First off...to those unhappy with the packaging I'd like to say that in the past Universal has demonstrated their ability to make  sexy packages and  terrible product so the reverse is welcome.  The fairly nondescript package hold 5 single sided dual layer DVDs...and this is great news to all of us who know of  Universals penchant  for  double sided flipper discs that freeze and  skip!  The episodes look great as well.  This series seems to have been filmed rather than video taped which many of that era sadly were...so they look good.  Did I  mention that the show also featured some fun gunplay?  Yeah...its all good
an interview with Edward Woodward would have been terrific but I'm  just glad to have a solid DVD set of the first year and looking for more!
order without worries..

OOOPS..I almost forgot. This show also featured arguably one of the all time  best  opening  sequences highlighted by the brilliant theme  music composed  by Stewart Copeland  (The Police), guaranteed  to be pulse quickkening!",1203292800,26,1618,4.726618705035971
