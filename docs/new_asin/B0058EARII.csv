8658540,3,B0058EARII,"This video is good medicine. Oh my gosh, it's funny. The details were sketchy and with hardly any informative reviews, I went into it blind. What an odd video. Getting out of shape, I found skinny-people yoga a little too fast and tough. I thought something for big people might be what I needed to do until I get back into the swing of it.

This video is almost the opposite problem. It's not just for big bodies, it's for *big* bodies. It's really light yoga for people not in shape at all, mixed in with some chanting, meditation, praise dancing, chanting, etc.

The DVD is kind of neat. You can go by a 30-day calendar or just jump to what you want to do. I like the calendar format, and if Dr. Chumley came up with this, I thought it was fairly innovative.

The chanting. The chanting is almost useless. It is Benedictine monk chants, and if you can't happen to sing...you aren't going to be able to chant along with this DVD. On top of that, it is really short. The few things on this DVD that are good, are all too short.

The dancing. Not my thing at all.

The meditation. In my opinion, this is the best thing on the DVD, but it is so short that it just doesn't feel right. I mean, you just get started and then it's over.

You also get Chumley's great dialogue, like ""...[A]s you get more skilled at this you can hold it longer if you like. You can hold it for 60 seconds ... up to 60 seconds. I wouldn't try a whole minute at once, though."" Yeah, up to 60 seconds is fine, but I wouldn't try a whole minute at once! Like the title of this review says, it does good like medicine.

All in all, this is one mixed bag. I'm sure it is fine for its target audience. It is almost good. But it is such a weird mixture of things. Yoga, chanting, mediation...filmed in what looks like a Catholic church, odd but funny dialogue, corny dancing. It's almost surreal, like you might be flipping through cable channels one Saturday morning and catch this as the main movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Seriously, it's almost worth the price of the DVD just to see this.

But at the same time, I think that if Dr. Chumley had developed this concept better, he might have actually been on to a real winner.",1377302400,5,2205,4.258373205741627
