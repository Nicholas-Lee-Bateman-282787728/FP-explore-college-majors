2291724,5,B0009I7NH6,"This is a show that just keeps going and going.  I cannot even beleive that it's been over 30 years since this show went off the air.  I loved spending my Friday evenings as a kid with the Brady's!  The Brady Bunch is truly a pop culture icon in the history of TV.  A fanstastic show about family values.  No matter what problems came up, they were always resolved by the end of the show.  And then there's the Brady house.  I always loved that house with the big stairway up to the second floor, the family room with the walkout patio, the cool attic....Just a wonderful show that doesn't get old.

My favorite episodes from season two are:

""the Dropout""  Greg thinks he's going to be a big league pitcher and considers dropping out of high school.  Dodger pitching great Don Drysdale guest stars

""The Slumber Caper""  Marcia has a slumber party and the boys are happy as it gives them the chance to scare the girls.

""A Fistful of Reasons""  A bully is making fun of Cindy due to her lisp.  Peter is at first afraid of the bully but then cleans his clock.

""The not so ugly Duckling""  A classic as Jan is feeling envious of Marcia so she invents an imaginary boyfriend from another town named George Glass.

""Where there's smoke""  Greg gets caught smoking and Marcia rats him out!

""Will the Real jan Brady Please Stand up"" Another classic as jan again is feeling the middle child blues and buys a horrible looking black wig.

""The Liberation of Marcia Brady""  Marcia is all for women's lib and decides to join Gregs boy scout troop to prove she can do anything a boy can do.

""Double parked""  The Bradys lead a crusade to save a park but it's Mike's company that is planning to build there.

It's so hard to pick favorites as this is such a great show.  Even though these are still in re-run it's great to have them on DVD!",1121212800,24,1826,4.341246290801187
2291725,5,B0009I7NH6,"A year (at least) older, the Bradys return to continue learning about life--and each other. Twenty three episodes in this season (1970-1971) actually do a good job of showing that even the 'bunch' is not perfect.

Greg searches for himself this season. First he gets an office boy job at Mike's office in ""Call me Irresponsible"", but quickly looses the plans for a very important project. In ""Where there is smoke"" Greg is caught smoking nicotine cigarettes with his friends; this episode probably has more punch with today's numerous anti-youth smoking initiatives than it did in an era when advertising restrictions were much less lax.

Finally, in ""Our son, the man"" Greg decides that he needs his own 'crash pad' and moves into Mike's den. He also decides that he will start calling his parents by their first names, but this is not permanent change in the Brady universe. Greg ultimately moves back in with his brothers (at least for this season) and once again uses `mom and dad'.

Cindy and Jan also come into their own as characters during this season. Cindy deals with the bully Buddy Hinton, who makes fun of her speech (""A fistful of reasons"") with Peter's assistance, and Bobby feels compelled to win his own merit (""The winner"") to catch up with everybody else in this family. Nothing is as ever smooth as it had initially seemed in the Brady household.

""Will the real Jan Brady please stand up"" has Jan buy an admittedly cheap wig in her own latest attempt to stand out from the more 'popular' members of the Bunch. She had previously invented George Glass for similar purposes in another episode (""The not-so-ugly-duckling"").

This season continues telling the way they became the Brady Bunch with just the right amounts of sugar and spice mixed together. Keep the seasons coming.",1119139200,41,1796,4.837133550488599
2291726,5,B0009I7NH6,"I have been a Brady Bunch fan since I was 4 years old (1994) and I still live to be a fan (I am 15 years old now). It is the only show I watch! I have every single episode recorded on tape as well as the spin-off series. I also have books, the Brady Kids albums, trading cards, etc. I purchased Season 1 on DVD in March and I was impressed with it. It was the first time in the 11 years that I have been a fan that I have seen the uncut versions. I cannot wait for Season 2 to come out! THE BRADY BUNCH RULES!!!!!",1117843200,10,513,3.7155963302752295
2291727,5,B0009I7NH6,"Anytime you watch the Brady Bunch you go back to a simpler and more innocent time.  When any challenge/problem such as Peter breaking Mom's lamp, Greg needing his own room, Bobby falling out of the treehouse or Jan wanting to be a brunette can be solved in 20 minutes you know you have come to the right place.  This is great and recommended for children of any age.

Sit back and get lost in Bradyland.",1115337600,27,403,4.346666666666667

2291758,5,B0009I7NH6,"Season 2 - the series peaked.  Florence Henderson ditched the blonde wig and the soft and gentle characterization of Carol Brady that impaired her during Season 1 and became the hippest, coolest mom on TV - and it has forever remained that way.  The broad comedy of Season 1 gradually dissolved as the six kids started to grow up - very fast.  By the end of Season 2, despite not winning a single award (and no awards were awaiting), and not being in the top 10 or even 20, The Brady Bunch had firmly rooted itself in American pop culture.",1467676800,,539,4.37

2291933,5,B0009I7NH6,"I purchased this specifically to introduce my children to The Brady Bunch that I grew up loving.  I am sooooooooo glad that I did.  My children love this show.  And, Oh the memories that have come flooding back.  My daughter begs to watch The Brady Bunch every day.  We have a movie night on the weekend and are going through each season.  Opportunities to share part of your childhood with your own children do not come around all the time so I am thankful for this opportunity.  Purchasing these dvd's is well worth it, if for no other reason than being able to spend time sharing something you loved with your chidlren.

The dvd quality was flawless.  It was simply much better than I expected.  Each dvd has several shows on it that are listed in the menu.  The menues are easily navigated.  Each show starts by showing the Brady's (very young) all lined up on the stairs with some brady music playing.  My kids love that part.

We are on season 2 and my kids are amazed at how the Brady kids have grown.  Just wait until they meet Johnny Bravo!

Again, the quality is supurb.  I highly recommend these dvds.  I did consider purchasing the set with the shag carpet which had all the dvds in cardboard sleeves, but the reviews scared me off with the complaints of glue sticking on the dvds and the dvds getting scratched.  These dvds are all in plastic cases and are well protected.  Oh, and I like having the Lenticular printing (wiggle pictures/3d pictures) on the cover of each season that show the Brady's looking around at each other as they do in the intro.  My daughter loves to play with them.  So if you are considering purchasing these dvds then do not hesitate and get them now.  You absolutely will not regret the purchase.

Enjoy the memories!

Here are all the seasons I purchased:

2291959,3,B0009I7NH6,"The first season of The Brady Bunch saw the melding of two families into one larger one, and quite naturally some of the early episodes revolved around the adjustments and growing pains that came out of this new and unusual situation.  In season two, things have mostly settled down, and the Brady's are a unified family, headed jointly by Mike (Robert Reed) and Carol Brady (Florence Henderson).

Rather than adults The Brady Bunch (1969-74) was mostly aimed at children in roughly the same age range as the Brady's kids, as children of almost any age range or gender, could relate to one or more of the Brady siblings.  Having six children in the principal cast was a challenge, as besides limits on how long minors could work, each of the young actors had their own particular strengths.  So while everyone gets a chance to be in the spotlight in this season, as the oldest, Barry Williams (Greg) and Maureen McCormick (Marcia) were more likely to be featured by the writers.

The best stories frequently involved one of the kids having a problem.  ""Call Me Irresponsible"" is a prime example, as Greg gets a job at Mike's architectural firm, and screws up the delivery of some important plans to a client.  In ""Confessions, Confessions"", Peter (Christopher Knight) breaks Carol's favorite vase, and his siblings are punished for trying to keep his secret.  Marcia makes some waves in ""The Liberation of Marcia Brady"", when she attempts to join the all male Frontier Scouts.

Carol becomes concerned about Alice (Ann B. Davis), when an old flame comes to town in ""Alice's September Song"".  ""Double Parked"" involves everyone in the family, as the Brady kids and Carol protest against a project that will result in the loss of a neighborhood park.  While Mike, who is assigned to work on the project, finds that his job is on the line because of his family's activities.

Featuring a unique family unit, The Brady Bunch continued the tradition of the ideal all-American TV family from the late 60's into 1970's.  With stories that deal with realistic issues, and others are kind of frivolous, the writing in the second season was good, but not great.  For the Brady's, there was much more fun to come, as the hairstyles would get longer (and in some cases curly), and the clothes would get more groovy.",1347148800,,2302,4.794936708860759

I have also purchased other 70's shows such as The Bionic Woman, I Love Lucy, The Flinstones, Twilight Zone, The Odd Couple, and so forth.

2291965,5,B0009I7NH6,"The second year of ""The Brady Bunch"" was filled with great guest-stars and wonderful, funny episodes. People like Marcia Wallace, Christine Baranski, Don Drysdale, and Richard Simmons all made appearances in the 1970-1971 TV season. This 24 episode boxset contains the episodes ""The Slumber Caper"" in which the boys wreck havok on the girls slumber party by putting itching powder in their sleeping bags. Another fun show is ""The Tattletale"" where Cindy repeats what she overhears in private conversations in the Brady household. Susan Olsen (the first actor hired on the series) hated this episode with a passion. ""Where There's Smoke"" has Greg experimenting with smoking and ""Will The Real Jan Brady Please Stand Up"" has Jan wearing a brunette wig to change her appearance. A fun season for the whole family, ""The Brady Bunch"" to this day continues to enthrall audiences with its simple stories on family and sibling rivalry. This is also the first season that the Brady kids sing the famous theme song.

Anyway, if you're a Brady Bunch fan, you'll enjoy this. My 3 brothers,2 sisters, and myself were glued to the TV on Friday nights to watch this when we were young.

""A Fistful of Reasons"" has Peter confronting a schoolyard bully who teases Cindy with `baby talk, baby talk, it's a wonder she can walk."" ""Will The Real Jan Brady Please Stand Up?"" featuring Jan and her notorious black wig.  ""Our Son, The Man"" brings Greg into the hip and happening age of being a man, and ""The Liberation of Marcia Brady"" has Marcia struggling to join Greg's ""boy scout"" club and Peter's laughable attempt to become a ""sunflower"" (a ""girl scout"" type club).  This season is definitely a winner and has some of the best if not ""the"" best of the ""Bunch.""

Mike's wife Carol(Florence Henderson) and their respective children all loved and got along well with Alice as well. The Brady kids delivered one great talent of theirs,singing vocals. They actually got a recording contract for a few years(in reality). Henderson is a singer herself. She did sing a few jingles for Wesson oil commercials.

After watching the shows again, I disagree with the description of the program as ""sappy.""  This show has some bite.  For example, when Bobby gets hit by the school bully, the solution to the problem is to try to talk and then, when that doesn't work, hit the bully back hard enough to loosen a tooth.  Another example: when Marcia becomes interested in ""women's lib,"" she shows she has the ability to be a scout with the boys, but then decides she'd rather quit and read a fashion magazine with her mother.  In both of these episodes, the writing is remarkably clever in the way it recognizes trendy ideas (violence is never the answer; there's no difference between the sexes), pays them their due, and then reaches exactly the opposite conclusion.

And did I mention what a refreshing change it is to see a show where the parents and the teachers and the school principal are smarter and wiser than the children?  Good stuff.",1123545600,5,1175,4.5
2292036,4,B0009I7NH6,"For all its unabashed sappiness (and there's enough sugar sap to make this show fatal for most diabetics), ""The Brady Bunch"" is the most enjoyable TV sitcom of the 1970s.  Of course, the series (about a widower with 3 sons married to a widow with 3 daughters) was completely devoid of any semblance of reality: within a 25 minute episode any family crisis could be addressed and resolved.  Patriarch Mike Brady always had a painfully corny sermon to preach, and Carol Brady was the annoyingly cheerful, domesticated housewife.  Yet, ""The Brady Bunch"" had a campy appeal that helped make it a beloved staple for over 35 years.  This 4 DVD package has all 24 episodes of the second season, which ran from September 25th, 1970 to March 26, 1971.  I won't summarize all the episodes, but key highlights are ""A Fistful of Reasons,"" in which Peter learns to defend himself and lil' sis Cindy from the schoolyard bully Buddy Hinton (""Hey, chicken!  Lemme hear you cackle!""); ""Our Son, the Man,"" where Greg, all of 14, decides he's now a man and gets his own bedroom (temporarily, at least), and ""Confessions, Confessions,"" in which Peter gets busted for breaking ""Mom's favorite vase"" (""She always said, 'don't play ball in the house!'"").  But two other episodes specifically focus on Jan's burgeoning identity crisis (and rivalry with older sis Marcia): ""Will the Real Jan Brady Please Stand Up?"" and ""The Not So Ugly Ducking,"" in which prima-donna-in-the-making Marcia says to Jan, with a straight face, ""If boys don't find you attractive, don't blame me.""  Wow, that's gotta sting.  We also discover in another episode that Cindy becomes a tattletale and has this unsettling habit of revealing other people's personal business.  Not cute.  These DVDs don't come with any features, but I suspect few will care.  What's important is that each and every episode from the second season is here.  Most children of the 1970s and 80's had one guilty pleasure for a TV show.  For me, it was the Bradys.",1123113600,5,1990,4.8664688427299705

Ideas for extras could include (besdies obvious commentary):

a) more ""home movies,"" but unedited or unused footage from the previous special.

b) there have been so many great Brady specials & tie-ins, such as:

  1. Brady: An American Chronicle - this was a hilarious, Ken Burns style ""documentary"" that ran on Nick at Nite or TV Land about 10 years ago. I have an old copy that I need to get transferred to DVD asap!

  2. Bradymania! - a Florence Henderson special that ran on, I believe, ABC about 10 years ago.

  3. Day by Day (cir. 1991) - this obscure, friendly little sitcom devoted an entire episode that featured a great ""dream"" sequence (a la Bobby) by the main character. Obsessed with Brady reruns, he actually becomes one of them. Features Robert Reed, Florence Henderson, several of the ""kids"" and the classic Brady house set. What made it so great was that it was prior to ""retro"" hipness of the 70s (for the most part) and I believe featured the actor who eventually played Greg in the spoof films (he's the character who has the dream). It almost seems like a dry-run for those films, which I didn't like as much as this episode.

  b) Somewhere, somplace at Paramount, there must exist some aditional bumpers, bloopers or commercials that would make Brady fans foam at the mouth.

  c) Sid & Marty Kroft's Supershow - This Hollywood Bowl concert featured others, such as Johnny Whittiker, Jack Wilde & HR Puff N Stuff, but the real show stoppers are the Brady Kids. Bobby goes absolutely beserk singing oldies such as Talahassee Lassie, Bony Maronie etc. Look close in the audience, and see a very serious looking Robert Reed enjoying a cool beer with none other than Alice!!",1122854400,2,1954,4.697058823529412

2292040,5,B0009I7NH6,"Ah, the Bradys. Those insane loveable Bradys. The original MILF married to a closet homosexual, and raising six kids. Season 2 has some classics. Here are the highlights....

The Un-Underground Movie

Greg the Director this should have been called. A backyard movie about the Pilgrims and Plymoth Rock, starring non other than the Brady family. Wise Mike Brady gets too into the project and it all goes down from there. Greg finally loses his temper with everyone and all seems at a loss. But the film ends up being a success. It's a good thing the little brat decided to listen to his father though. He was about to shoot the movie with the lens cap on.

Going, Going...Steady

This is when Marcia begins to develop as TV's ultimate tease. She has a crush on a nerd that collects bugs. Marcia uses her feminine charms (with help from mom) to get her brothers to collects bugs for her. The nerd ends up being a flop so Marcia decides to go steady with someone else, and then someone else, and then again to someone else. The Brady harlot would only get sexier as the years went by.

Call Me Irresponsible

Greg screws up and almost gets his dad canned to boot. This is one of the few shows that had a helpful message in everyday life. Never hire your kids.

The Treasure of Sierra Avenue

The Bradys experience one of the seven deadly sins, GREED. The boys find a wallet in the park while playing football. Before you know it, Greg wants to buy a car. The girls want in on the money too. Of course they do, they'll be women someday and they have to learn early how to nag money from men. Well the old coot that lost his wallet gets it back and the family evenly splits a whopping twenty dollar reward.

A Fistful of Reasons

Oh this one is great. Thindy's lisp gets the whole Brady family into a war with another family. There's this bully at school who picks on Thindy and her lisp. Well Mike tries to talk to the kids father (disaster), Carol tries to talk to the mother (even worse), so it's up to the kids (as usual). Peter knocks the bully's tooth out in a gratuitous show of Brady violence. Then the bully comes to the Brady house afterward. Seems he's developed a lisp from his tooth being knocked out. He has learned his lesson about bullying kids who's brothers have great left hooks.

The Not-So-Ugly Duckling

Family psycho Jan makes up her imaginary George Glass boyfriend. This is the episode that introduces Jan as the weird one with voices in her head and a bloodlust.

Where There's Smoke

Greg gets busted smoking. His sisters rat him out to Mike and Carol. Then the little bastard gets caught with cigarettes in his jacket. Of course he swears `They're not mine!!"". Naturally Mike and Carol believe him, why wouldn't they? The smokes actually belong to the son of a mother who advocates against the great Evil Tobacco.

Will the Real Jan Brady Please Stand Up?

Jan's gone off the deep end again. Now she thinks she's Pam Grier.

Our Son, the Man

Greg moves into his father's den. He's a real swinger now, groovy Johny Bravo is born.

The Winner

Bobby is a loser. A complete and total loser. Every Brady has a trophy except him. He goes on a mad quest for one. He ends up shoveling ice cream in his mouth on TV and can't even win a spoon. The sympathetic Brady's present him with a trophy for being the ""Loser that tries the Hardest and still sucks"".

Tell it Like It Is

Carol is trying to be a writer. The magazine she wrote to turns her down flat. C'mon Carol. You got a maid and kids who are raising themselves. Just keep walking around in your mini-skirts and flirt with anything in pants.",1122422400,2,3614,4.419306184012067
2292041,5,B0009I7NH6,"Ever enjoy a TV show as a kid, then gaze at it when you become an adult and find out you absolutely despise the show? Well, thankfully The Brady Bunch stands the test of time, proving to not only be an essential chapter of US television nostalgia but also great scriptwork comedy that still makes viewers today laugh at the comedically blissful family. This is one of the exclusively exceptionally hilarious comedies that are so infrequent these days. But there's more than quaint reminiscing here, with an unforgettable theme song, great young actors with the Bradys and an indescribable sense of fastidious TV enjoyment. Back in 1969, a widowed architect genius with his three young boys joins forces with a very pretty blonde divorcee and her three blonde daughters and moves into a fantastic two-story mansion with its avocado-colored interior design and a live-in maid with her witty sense of humor.

Any time a kid gets into trouble (like disappearing into thin air, wrecking a family portrait, hitting a sister on her nose with a basketball, etc.), he or she gets scolded by the stern but understanding parents, thus he or she learns a lesson and goes on with his or her innocent, youthful life without ever getting whacked on the bottom. Meanwhile, the slim-waisted young wife and the good-humored maid cook up all sorts of real mouth-watering gourmet dinner every night, the kids invent all sorts of real games and fun that will bewilder today's kids completely numb from too much TV-watching, and the fit, youthful, and fun-loving daddy and mommy have plenty of time to go out and enjoy themselves as well as disciplining all six active kids in such a loving, understanding way that they all go away with a big, relieved smile on their faces instead of running off to cry in their rooms. Brothers and sisters sincerely care and look out for each other. What's more, the whole family, maid included, all goes off on exotic vacations every year where they all run into fantastic adventures with pirates, crooks, and Indians. The digital transfer is excellent as well, and the extras are great fun. Essential TV comedy that still works today. Buy it, and have a laugh.",1122336000,3,2175,4.846774193548387

So does my boyfriend,Trent. When he gets a Engagement ring and wedding ring together,We will be engaged. I also like The Bully episode,too. I know what it's like to be bullied,teased. I was teased to tears all through my Junior Year of high school. I bet Kim Possible never gets bullied or picked on because if they do,She will kick their butt. I wish I were like her. I wish Buddy Hinton had brothers and sisters[I hate only  children]",1122163200,,684,4.560975609756097
