8465118,5,B005CCJR7S,"A DVD of an organ recital might not be all that interesting to watch, so it was a good idea for this program of several of J. S. Bach's major organ pieces, including the great Toccata and Fugue in D minor, to be coupled with views of several extraordinary old churches in Bavaria. I enjoyed it. The sound and video are of high quality. Although the recording did not involve any of the organs in the churches shown, it would have been appropriate for the video to have taken a closer look at those very attractive old instruments.",1417046400,,530,4.418367346938775
