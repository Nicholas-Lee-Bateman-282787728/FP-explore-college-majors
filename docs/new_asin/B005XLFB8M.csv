The only two characteristics that this actress has in common with GLW are 1) they're blond and 2) they're tall.  One might think that, maybe GLW may have had extensive plastic surgery back in the day, but when you look at the three childhood pictures of GLW in her autobiography--one at age 1, the next at age 7, and the next at age 10 at her confirmation, you can clearly see that this could not be the case, as GLW looks just like her childhood pictures.  There are other things that come into play. There is no mention of this film in her autobiography at all, or of her ever working with this filmmaker on any film.  As for the name 'Ruth Whitney,' GLW was given the name 'Ruth' by a rabbi when she converted to Judaism in the early 1950s, and this film was made in 1947. I'm glad I bought this DVD by way of the marketplace.
By the way, the movie also stinks.  Purchase at your own risk!",1382313600,,979,4.191489361702128

Without the connection I'm not sure I would have been interested in it, (I'm not a fan of old westerns) But for what it is it's great. It really shows how far film-making and our society has come. It was amazing to see how Jack Elam got his start and the young girl gained fame later on on Star Trek. This movie has opened a new interest for me, that of finding now famous actors at their very beginning.",1336953600,,541,3.9272727272727272
