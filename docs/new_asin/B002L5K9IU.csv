3945472,2,B002L5K9IU,"I just watched this with my 2 1/2 year old son last night and I was a bit disappointed. We usually love Bob the Builder, but this one had some language in it that I felt was not up to par with other Bob episodes. The character of ""Banger"", for example, made some crude remarks that could have been left out. For a Christmas movie, I would not recommend it. It does very little to promote Christmas but rather promotes rock star lifestyle and language. I may be overly sensitive, but I thought I'd share this in case there are other parents out there concerned about it.",1323820800,11,569,4.327102803738318

3945474,5,B002L5K9IU,"Sent this Bob The Builder Christmas DVD to my Godchild's three-year old son.  He is a Bob The Builder fan and really enjoyed it.  Seems he was a little nervous about Rudolf DVDs for some reason, but simply loved Bob The Builder.  He actually said he had been waiting for me to send this to him, and of course, he had no idea that I was.",1263254400,3,336,4.0606060606060606

8372435,5,B002L5K9IU,"Bob the builder is a great series for young children who love the world of construction machines. My son is among those little constructors and we have so far watched all episodes of this that are available as a prime instant video. It is also great to see that even my 3 years old son finds a way to enjoy our amazon prime membership which is so far well worth the fee.

There are plenty of construction videos on youtube and most of them are showing nothing more than those big monstrous machines digging the site. I find them pretty useless and a waste of time for my child but that generates tension since he loves watching them. Bob the builder series saved us from those nonsense videos. It both feeds his great interest in the construction world and teaches many good stuff to the child like friendship, cooperation, being polite and not teasing your friends in offensive ways. The use of language is very well considered as well. It is a clear English which is very important for the little ones who are in the progress of developing their language skills. Finally, unlike the stupid cartoons I used to watch in my childhood, it has not a drop of violence at all.

This particular episode is very funny and contains extra characters like Mr Banger (what a name) (the cool easygoing fellow), Major of the city and Elton Jones in addition to regular characters. The story is about bob and the team trying to organize the christmas celebrations of a town in a very short time and how they handle various challenges during the organization process. It offers great fun for my kid as well as myself.

Watching any sort of TV under age 2 is not recommended by experts who argue that it impairs the language development. But those experts recommend kids to watch 1 hour/ day TV (after 2 years of age) provided that the stuff they watch is a high quality one. I strongly recommend adding this movie to your playlist to spice up your kid's one hour quality TV time...",1403049600,,1966,4.532394366197183
