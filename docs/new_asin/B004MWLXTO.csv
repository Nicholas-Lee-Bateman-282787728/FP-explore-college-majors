4433768,4,B004MWLXTO,"I've gotten hold of an early copy of the set, so I figured I'd share some specifics about what the set looks like, what's actually contained, etc. This isn't really a review of the show itself - I figure The PJs is a niche enough show that only fans are likely to stumble across this page anyway - suffice to say, I'd rate the show somewhere in the 4.5/5 region, firmly in the upper echelon of TV animation.

The packaging for the set is pretty basic - standard-width Amaray case, containing two discs, one on a tray. Back cover is pretty uneventful, with a large picture and a brief description of the show. There are, frustratingly, no episode details on either the back of the box or on an insert inside; you have to put the discs in your player to see what's on them.

The menus are static. The main menu plays The PJs theme song in the background and offers two options, ""play all"" and ""episode selection"". Pretty self-explanatory. There are no alternative language tracks, there are no subtitle options (not even English). The set is, however, closed-captioned.

The episodes are presented on the set in production order (not airdate order). Thirteen episodes are included. This means that ""How the Super Stoled Christmas"" is not included, as it was one of the last episodes produced, despite being listed as part of season one on most online episode guides. Wikipedia mentions a ""pilot"" episode; if that exists, it's not included here either (I say ""if"", as I've never seen it, and IMDb and TV.com don't list it). The back-of-the-box DVD running time allocates 24 minutes to each episode (more on the *actual* running times later); based on this, July 5th's release of season 2 will contain eighteen episodes. I'd guess at this including the seventeen episodes generally considered to comprise season 2, plus ""How the Super Stoled Christmas"", but that's pure speculation. (It's anyone's guess how they'll treat the confusing jumble of season three..)

Full episode list:

DISC 1
1. The Door
2. Rich Man, Porn Man
3. Hangin' with Mr. Super
4. Journal Fever
5. Bougie Nights
6. Haiti Sings the Blues
7. Bones, Bugs and Harmony
8. A Hero Ain't Nothing But A Super

DISC 2
9. He's Gotta Have It
10. Boyz 'N The Woods
11. Operation Gumbo Drop
12. U Go Kart
13. House Potty

I haven't had time to check every episode, but I believe they all run their original length (around 22:30). If anyone has anything specific they'd like me to check, please ask. The music *has* been changed in some instances; most noticeably, The Jeffersons theme tune in ""Bougie Nights"" has been changed to generic music. A crying shame, though I acknowledge that for a cult show like this, the sales would probably never have justified the cost of clearing the originals.

The AV quality of the set is pretty good; marginally better than I might have expected.

When all's said and done, I'm still very happy about this release; I'd resigned myself to never seeing the show on DVD. Now it's here? Well, it's not perfect, but it's way better than nothing. Hope I've helped.",1304121600,46,3049,4.694756554307116
4433769,5,B004MWLXTO,"I thought I'd never see the day when ""The PJs"" was released on DVD. The first two seasons are brilliantly funny -- and just politically incorrect enough that I doubt such a show would ever be green-lighted by a major network these days.

I watch ""The PJs"" on TV One every Saturday morning, and I can only hope that the DVD versions include original music. For example: in the episode ""Bougie Fever"" (sp?), a five or six second sample of ""The Jeffersons"" theme song is changed in the syndicated version. The scene absolutely loses its hilarity, and I hope that it's unchanged on the DVD.",1303257600,7,586,4.580952380952381

4433836,5,B004MWLXTO,"The first season of the Vinton Studios produced the animated series, The PJs for the FOX TV network is stellar. The hilarious adult comedy/animated series was a partnership between Vinton and creators/executive-producers, Eddie Murphy, Larry Wilmore and Matt Groening. Through the use of Foamation, the refined Vinton style of dimensional animation, the residents of the mythical Hilton Jacobs Housing Project come to life. Eddie Murphy and Mark Moseley voiced the lead character, Thurgoode Orenthal Stubbs, the inept janitor of the building. The lovable cast of characters include Stubbs' long-suffering wife, Muriel (Loretta Devine), Mrs. Avery (Ja'net DuBois), Sanchez (Pepe Serna), Juicy Hudson (Michele Morgan), Walter Burkett (Marc Wilmore), Jimmy Ho (Michael Paul Chan),  Smokey (Shawn Michael Howard), Calvin (Crystal Scales), Bebe Ho (Jenifer Lewis), Mr. Hudson (Kevin Michael Richardson), Mambo Garcelle, aka Haiti Lady (Cheryl Francis Harrington), Tarnell (James Black), and HUD woman (Cassi Davis).

 HOWEVER, call me anal but I find it to be a major inconvenience that they neglected to place the episodes from each season in the order that they originally aired like they do with every other show.

4433842,5,B004MWLXTO,"This is an amazing show! I was younger when this came out. Like most kids made in the 80s, cartoons were a big part in my life. I don't think kids today understand the magnitude and effect shows used to have us. There wasn't anything else; no Internet, 3 Star Wars and Ninja Turtles haha. That was it for a long time. One thing that always facinated me was Claymation. Even as a small child, I would marvel at the time and effort that went into even just moments of animation. Most notably was The California Raisons. I know that they are the reason I play music and made me who I am today haha. So I just wanted to take you back for a moment and put you into the mindset when this came out. Naturally, I was a big fan of The Simpsons. I could still rattle off timeless quotes from the series. This is back when the writing and comedy mattered. It was more about what was being said instead of what you saw. That brings us to the PJs. I remember laughing my self to death at this show and I still laugh the same today! This show has maintained a timeless quality and can act as a time capsule to the late 90s. Eddie Murphy stars as Thurgood Stubbs, the Superintendent of the Hilton Jacobs Projects. Murphy masterfully mixes in famous Black Americans into almost every one of his quips and follys. I still say ""I'm in deep Shaquille"" haha. Each character is memorable and lovable. Keep an eye out for Tarnell, the neighborhood corner hook up for all you needs. Mrs. Avery, the cantankerous old lady and her shotgun. And everyone's favortie crackhead, Smokey! For its short run, this show got a lot of production value and holds up very well today. And for good measure, the show actually takes place in Oregon! haha fun fact! The ONLY thing I don't like about the DVD releases is a lot of the music has been altered. Apprently, I understand there was complications with the artists on ""The PJs - Album"" and those song have been removed entirely but also some songs written by other artists. Sometimes used as a joke, like Rick James ""Super Freak"", the show feels absent without. It's jus not as rich of an experience with the stock music they put in place. Thankfully, the theme song still exists (unlike some DVDs like Married... With Children, so bad!) and if you haven't seen the show a lot, you won't notice that much. The only other thing I feel I should mention is some point in the second season, Eddie Murphy stops doing the voice of Thurgood but still continued to write the material. Murphy was replaced by someone who does a good job. If you haven't seen this yet and you read all of this haha, you will love this show! Enjoy!",1391558400,,2636,4.381632653061224

4433866,5,B004MWLXTO,"One of the few genuinely funny shows on television, the chemistry of writers, art and voice acting pulls this off better than any other animated show on television.  Lamentably it was short-lived, as many other cult classics which Fox mishandled.  That network must be run by eccentrics.  Watching the shows in the order on DVD, which doesn't match the order or broadcast, but that takes nothing from the episodes, which are great fun to watch.  I need to pace myself or I'll be through Season 3 in no time.",1356134400,,507,4.662921348314606
4433867,5,B004MWLXTO,"Greetings all! I'm taking just a wee bit of your time to review this product. I watched this when it was running on network television. It was funny then & funny now. It's taken a long time to get this for purchase. I actually have tried for years. The only difference from the tv show, is the end credits where there is no theme musice playing as the episodes go off. That's all. The discs are very crisp & clear. The whole series is what I purchases because it is a classic & very funny. It's part of Eddie Murphy's better layers. Some of his raturally ""raw"" comedic genius. At least to me any way. This series depicts the goings ons & goings ins of the ""hood"" or projects as it is. Though it boasts exaggerations of circumstances surrounding minorites & fiscal handicap, it speaks high octave volumes of what happens in governmental properties intended for the indigent. The lifestyle in this environment mimics the residents as an indigenous people. The pjs shows a laughable tolerance for the less fortunate.  It entertains & sheds light on the daily struggles of housing developments & the abundant neglect throughout the system. I would thoroughly recommend this product because it'll grab your attention & keep u laughing. Please don't hesitate to give it a try.",1348876800,6,1270,4.7207207207207205
4433868,5,B004MWLXTO,"This is awesome and so funny! We finally own the whole series on DVD. We were wondering what every happened to this show! Now we are so excited to add this whole series to our collection. This show is so funny!

You will laugh, roll on the floor laughing, cry and I mean be close to the bath room You will have to go! Whew funny and real T.V. With the crap they have on T.V. now days, you need something that is real like The PJ's.

I think we laughed harder than we did when we first saw the show years ago.  I have no idea why it was cancelled.
