3173258,5,B0017KXD1U,"Dogfights is an amazing and unique documentary TV series originally broadcast on the History Channel.

This DVD collection of Dogfights series 1 & 2 consists of twenty eight episodes, plus some extras, on a total of nine DVDs.

Each episode contains superb and realistic computer generated graphics, designed to place you right there in the dogfight.

Incredible feats of human bravery are expertly demonstrated and narrated, as man and machine go head to head in the theatres of aerial combat throughout the 20th century.

Tactical descriptions and life and death situations are told by the fighter jocks themselves, mostly with an American slant.

Flight dynamics and aerial maneuvers are dissected and demonstrated with dynamically exciting and realistic CGI graphics animation, and also including some original footage.

Fantastic camera angles, fast paced action and the fascinating narration makes this documentary the most exciting and interesting documentary series on fighter aircraft I have ever seen.

Phantoms, Hellcats, Sabres, Tomahawks, Wildcats, Thunderbolts, Mustangs, Fokker Triplane's, F-15's, Vietnam, WWI, WWII, Middle East, Europe, Korea and the Pacific are just some of the aircraft and operations covered.

If you like fighter aircraft, you'll love this.",1218153600,47,1278,5.689473684210526
3173259,4,B0017KXD1U,My son watched the entire series in two sittings.  The visuals were very good and the narrator was easy to understand.,1216684800,4,118,4.619047619047619

3173261,5,B0017KXD1U,"This packaging of the series has a few episodes that are not in other collections, such as the iTunes collection. Also, my DVD rips (packaged with Handbrake to the cloud) look BETTER than the HD iTunes version I also bought!

The last featurette contains near future scenarios using the F-22 Raptors and the F-35s and it is GREAT! This is SUPER good value if you love analysing aerial combat.",1494374400,,392,4.681159420289855
3173262,5,B0017KXD1U,"This series kicks ass! Nearly perfect in every respect.

Each episode documents four or five historical air-to-air dogfights. Most segments feature combat from wars from WW1 through Vietnam (one segment deals with the Gulf (Kuwait) War and one with air combat in the Balkans in the mid-1990s. Fewer fights from WW1 are featured; most are from WW2 through Vietnam).

Most of the presentations are done in CGI, but this is CGI done so well that it displays near-photographic quality. Although Dogfights aired ten years ago, you wouldn't guess it from the quality of the computer graphics. The accompanying music is also first-rate.

The CGI presentation is enhanced with short inline segments of commentary from some of the pilots involved in the combat, many even from WW2. Many episodes show archival footage of the actual aircraft and men during the war. So-called ""ribbon"" diagrams are often used to showcase the maneuvers and tactics that the aircraft executed in their dogfights. This is supplemented side-by-side comparisons of the capabilities and advantages/disadvantages of each aircraft in the fight. Often the view from the pilot in the cockpit is shown to give his perspective on the aerial situation. Every episode is introduced with an explanation of the historical context of the war in which the dogfight takes place, and the starting  circumstances of each dogfight.

Most of the episodes focus on American fighter pilots and combats involving allied pilots (like the British and Israelis). Very few of their Axis/Korean/Vietnamese/Russian opponents are portrayed in such detail. One exception is the episode ""The Luftwaffe's Deadliest Mission"" which documents the mssions of Sonderkommando Elbe which was ordered to bring down Allied bombers by ramming them. Two of the Luftwaffe pilots who survived after ramming their targets (Heinrich Henkel and Klaus Hahn) were interviewed. Watching the  episodes dealing with the Vietnam War (among them The Bloodiest Day, AIr Ambush (Operation Bolo), and Hell Over Hanoi) the viewer would be led to believe that the USN and USAF totally ruled the skies over Vietnam; however, this was hardly the case.

The last disk contains the 90-minute ""Dogfights of the Future"". Naturally the Fifth Generation F-22 and F-35 aircraft feature prominently. A scenario is presented in which they square off against the air force of some unspecified rogue state equipped with Russian Migs and Sukhois, along with some French Rafales. The moral of this story is that stealth technology will rule the skies and that all non-stealth aircraft are only helpless targets. The writers of the episode do make the point that the swarms of enemy Fourth Generation aircraft will likely deplete the limited missile-carrying capacity of the stealth 5th Gen fighters, and that other solutions may be necessary like the proposed Boeing (Rockwell) B-1R, which is a B-1B modified with the F-119 turbofans of the F-22, an AESA air-to-air radar and fire control system, and racks for dozens of AIM-120 antiaircraft missiles. (note the latest proposal for an F-15 variant doubles the number of air-to-air missiles carried). The writers of the episode do point out that enemies may contrive some anti-stealth technology like low-frequency radar, but it's not likely to upset the overall balance of power. Also better surface-to-air missile technologies built into integrated air defense systems are likely to threaten future air campaigns over enemy territory. And then they go on to point out that eventually America's enemies will develop their own 5th Generation competitor aircraft that will necessitate further advances in technology. Finally, the arena of warfare will expand into space and threaten America's dependence on satellite assets in Earth orbit, and this will spur the deployment of hypersonic aircraft capable of fighting in this new realm of combat.

I've watched every episode at least three or four times and never tire of it. I ordered two copies just in case my first one wears out! Dogfights has got to be History Channel's best series, except for perhaps&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-History-Channel-Presents-The-Best-of-Modern-Marvels/dp/B0015XASV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The History Channel Presents The Best of Modern Marvels</a>.

I was having my daughter watch some of them and then was completely confused as to her indifference, maybe because she's 13 and it's not anime.

NONE of the disc's contained herein are in any sort of chronological order! You'll start with a Korean War dogfight, then go to a WWII dogfight, then to a WWI dogfight, then to a Vietnam dogfight, etc., etc., ad nauseam...!! Why in the hell couldn't the producers simply go in chronological order - start with WWI, then to the WWII stuff, then to the Korean War, and finally on to Vietnam & the Middle East?? Unless you write down which dogfight happens on which disc & where on that disc, etc., you're screwed - especially if you've got a favorite episode & want to go straight to it instead...!!

I remember the day my wife recorded ""The Tuskegee Airmen"" episode, and when I saw those red tailed Mustangs going through the sky, I started to cry.  The other best episodes?

3173313,4,B0017KXD1U,"Think about trying to explain an event in 3 dimensional space but with only 2 dimensions. It's like trying to explain how perfume smells on TV. For decades, no movie or documentary has been able capture the true essence of a dogfight because of this limitation. Even the movie Top Gun, while having great dogfight scenes, never really gave you a sense of the whole dogfight. Only certain aspects of it.

This documentary is the closest I have ever seen of what it feels like to be in the middle of a dogfight. The CG is beautifully rendered but more importantly, how the graphics are used to explain and visualize the dogfight is what sets this apart from anything I've seen before.

I give this 4 stars and not 5 for one reason only... don't waste such beautifully realized computer graphics on DVD alone. Make a Blu Ray version of this series and I will snatch it up faster than an F22 on full afterburner.",1417737600,,908,4.496969696969697

The main problem I had with it was that it became very repetitious after a while because it would go back and forth between time periods throughout the presentation and a lot of the scenarios were very similar. It would have been greatly improved if more background had been presented and it followed the story of history a little more clearly.

3173334,4,B0017KXD1U,"I enjoyed the Dogfights dvd box set immensley. It arrived sealed and in mint condition and the speed with which it was dispatched was impressive.

This documentary analyses some of the most spectacular aerial dogfights on record from the skies above the Western Front during WW1, the skies over Europe and the Pacific theatres during WW2 and the more recent conflicts including Korea, Vietnam, the Middle East and the First Gulf War.

The narration is concise and comprehensive and introduces the battle explaining how each 'dogfight' unfolded using state of the art CGI, interviews with the actual pilots involved, analysis of the aircraft and the tactics of the time. All this is also joined by film footage of the time and a step by step explanation of what happened and why without unduly 'milking' the event.

An excellent series delivered in an excellent manner. My only complaints(if any) is that the discs for season 2 are of the American variety and can only be viewed on TV via a PC. Additionally the show was designed around a TV audience with commercial breaks in mind so that every 15 minutes there is a 2 minute recap on what has happened so far as if viewers have just returned from a commercial break and need some brief revision.

3173335,5,B0017KXD1U,"Half of it feels like you're in the cockpit; the other half is like a classroom of dogfight tactics, with 3-D live action diagrams charting every offensive move and defensive response -- never letting you forget that these are real live plane against plane dogfights where only one pilot survives!

The best CGI brings the classic air battles to life: WWI, WWII, Korea, Viet Nam, the Middle East, and even air battles of the supersonic future - and you get a ring-side seat.  Animation that feels like a hand-held camera that searches the skies and suddenly zooms in and finds your prey - or predators.  Tense, riveting narration.  All this brings the immediacy of the combat to your screen.

This series is not for everyone.  If you prefer The Good Wives Club, pass on this.  But if Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan are in your collection, definitely add this one too.  You'll enjoy every moment, and watch it - and learn more than you ever guessed you didn't know - again and again and again.",1374710400,,1001,4.6158192090395485

Then one Saturday I was viewing the History Channel and saw the Tuskegee Airmen fighting over Germany and I knew I had to have that in my collection.  The dogfight are so real and the explanation of what you seeing on the screen is outstanding.  You can almost learn to fly by the instructions the narrator provides.

The animation gives a better appreciation for what you read about in books or see in the traditional style documentaries. It's also an eye opener for those outside this area of interest. They get an understanding of what air combat is about and the changes that have occurred through history.
 The biggest negative is that the discs are exact copies of the TV series. Since it was made for television there are numerous spots for commercials. Watching it on DVD without the ads is a choppy experience with abrupt breaks in the action. Each segment then ""begins again"" with a quick recap of what you've seen already, annoying enough when watching a cable broadcast and more so on DVD. As with most current documentaries it goes a bit over the top with the dramatic narration and background score, IMHO.",1359504000,,867,4.858108108108108

Some accounts gripping, witty, and downright scary as the then young airmen diced with death amid the clouds. The survivors give gripping accounts of their experiences and this who set makes for an important document on the conflicts that shaped the 20th Century and why we fought and for what. Markings and Units are accurately portrayed as far as I could see on the CG's and some segments looked very realistic which could never be even be seen using period gun camaras which only showed blurred, 'jumpy' images and the jarring of ther guns going off.

3173348,4,B0017KXD1U,"I've now watched both seasons.  I bought this after reading Cray-Zee Asian's 3-star review below.  He or she is 100% spot on with comments and critiques.  But I give this 4 stars.  The reason is the occasional animations illustrating combat maneuvers.  I wish there had been more of them and less repetetive narration (every segment begins with a 'recap' of the preceding segment, in case you just tuned in).  The moving illustrations of the split-S, scissors, etc. are worth the price of the DVDs to me because they helped me understand combat in 3-dimensions, and energy management (not that there's a lot of explanation in the episodes, because there isn't).  And there are unusual stories that were new to me.  I'd also note that the series falls off a bit discussing anything after Vietnam -- it's pretty clear that modern air combat is much more push-button and less dogfighting, but the narration churns away as though nothing's changed.  There's one small comment from an Israeli pilot of long experience who doesn't like the F-16 compared to his Mirage III, and I think an episode wondering if the days of dogfighting are long over, and giving vent to similar sentiments, wouldn't have gone down better than the hackneyed ""carrying on the traditions of the first dogfighters"" theme.  But if you're interested in air combat and are confused by reading pilot narratives full of jargon, this DVD series is a good ""unraveller"" that will increase your understanding of what these heroic guys and gals do.",1348099200,,1508,4.924901185770751
3173349,5,B0017KXD1U,"CGI graphics have been around for some time now, but I think they have found their niche' in the various historical recreations done for the History Channel. No other technology lets you virtually rebuild Rome and other sites of architectural interest.

The same can be said of the CGI recreation in the show Dogfights, which recreate various famous battles during the last century of aerial combat.
What separates this show from other CGI fare is that you get a glimpse of the surviving pilots and firsthand knowledge of their tactics. CGI allows a battle to be filmed from various angles,that would be painstaking using traditional animation and a drudgery using stop motion animation.  Planes and tactics are matched up using slick graphics using side by side comparisons. Ultimately, though it is the pilot that makes the difference, evidenced by inferior Wildcats downing Zeros in the battle of the Guadalcanal.

The show also went for the historical importance by doing an episode of the Tuskegee airmen, the first African American fighter group, who not only had to fight Jim Crow, but also the Nazis. Their outstanding combat record paved the way during the civil right movement and integrated the armed forces. They were very effective at protecting the bombers and even downed a few Nazi's Me262 jet fighters

A  poignant episodes concerned the sinking of the great German Battle Ship, the Bismarck. This was the last great battle ship and it was brought down by biplane Swordfish torpedo bombers. When it sank the battleship claim to the seas vanished.

One of the most interesting episodes is when Robin Olds tries to fool Migs squadrons that his squadron of F4s are really lumbering F-105 thunderchiefts. The trick of course was to surprise the Migs with the far more capable Phantom. Olds got to even the score.

The show is more than just slick graphics, but actually puts you in the pilot's mind as you experience the terror and excitement of aerial warfare.",1341792000,,1974,4.963636363636364
3173350,5,B0017KXD1U,"My son (age 7) and I enjoy this series. The CGI is not ""realistic"" as in the movies but it is done well so you get a clear understanding and visualization of the aerial combat. The videos do not include a whole lot of blood and gore (I can't recall any at the moment) so they are tame enough (caveat, see below) for my son to watch. The first-hand accounts from the pilots adds a great deal to the experience and keeps the episodes from being a series of desensitizing video games. The series does show violence (as any combat related show would) and the narration and the pilots accounts do talk about killing and seeing their comrades and enemies being killed. So if you allow a child to watch, you should watch with them so you can talk about it with your child.",1339632000,,765,4.319444444444445

3173353,5,B0017KXD1U,"""Dogfights"" are possibly the most impressive document on air warfare I ever saw. From the very first episode I was absolutely impressed with the quality of reconstructions, the care accorded to details and the passionate tone of narration. From World War I to the air fights over Kosovo in 1999, all episodes are extremely interesting and the fights described very well chosen. Many of those true stories are more incredible that some of the episodes seen in action movies! Also, authors made the remarkable effort to interview almost all the pilots who REALLY fought in those engagements, to preserve their testimony as long as they are still alive! For obvious reasons they couldn't do it for pilots of World War I, but even then they found some old records of WWI veterans taken in the 40s! To hear the testimony of people who actually faced German Fokkers in 1918 over France is a unique thing. Those interviews, excellent graphics explaining all the moves and CGI images showing the reconstruction of actual fights make those series an absolutely unique document!

I loved every single minute of every single episode but my absolute favorites are:

Season 1, episode 1: Mig Alley (Korean War)
Season 1, episode 2: Air Ambush - Operation ""Bolo"" (Vietnam War)
Season 1, episode 3: Flying Tigers - is there any need to say more?
Season 1, episode 5: Hell over Hanoi (Vietnam War)
Season 1, episode 8: Death of Japanese navy (Battle of Leyte) - with the accent put this time more on the naval fight
Season 1, episode 10: Long Odds - including the TRUE story of a dogfight between a single SBD Dauntless bomber and three successive Zero fighters (Battle of Coral Sea)
Season 1, episode 11: Dogfights of the Middle East (Six Days War, Yom Kippur War)

Season 2, episode 1: Kamikaze! In my opinion the second best in the whole series - three jaw dropping and absolutely TRUE stories; the one about the lonely fight of destroyer USS ""Laffey"" against a swarm of kamikazes on 15 April 1945 is especially poignant!
Season 2, episode 2: Luftwaffe's Deadliest Mission: the BEST and the most INCREDIBLE but TRUE story in the whole series! I do not want to provide spoilers, but if you really want to know what this is about, you can check on the web ""Sonderkommando Elbe"" - or you can simply watch this episode and enjoy the surprise...
Season 2, episode 5: Gun kills of Vietnam - canon fights in missile era - three incredible fights including one in which outdated WWII era turbo propelled planes faced MiG-17s...
Season 2, episode 8: No room for error - low altitude dog fights (WW II, Korean War, Vietnam War)
Season 2, episode 9: Night Fighters - less known planes on sometimes surprising missions - inluding a raid by two (yes, only two!) F6 Hellcats (night versions) against a large Japanese air and naval base...
Season 2, episode 10: The bloodiest day (Vietnam War)
Season 2, episode 16: Death of the Luftwaffe - the gigantic air battle (about 3000 fighters involved in all of which about 1000 Germans and about 2000 allied) over Belgium and Netherlands during the Operation ""Bodenplatte"", 1 January 1945...
Season 2, episode 18: Dogfights of the future - an episode longer than previous ones, showing some very surprising technologies, which are already under development...

Now, those series have also some limitations. The CGI images are really not on the ""Star Wars"" quality - but the stories are so passionate, that it doesn't matter any more after a couple of minutes. There are some (very, very limited) factual errors but you need to REALLY know your WWII airplanes to notice them.

Now, those series are almost totally American oriented and they mostly describe achievements of American pilots. The only few exceptions are accorded to the Israelis (two episodes), the Germans (two episodes), the Japanese (the Kamikaze episode) and the British (the ""Hunt for Bismarck"" episode). Also, those series are also very patriotic and even ""gung ho""... I for one have absolutely NO problem with that, but people who are radically left winged can get very upset very fast, especially in all the episodes about Vietnam War...

To conclude, I consider those series as one of the best purchases I ever made shopping for documents on DVD! They are a treasure and a must for anybody interested in aviation and/or in military history!",1327363200,,4328,4.84979702300406
3173354,4,B0017KXD1U,"Unfortunately, as with many other newer shows, this one is ""dumbed down"" for the masses. At one time, the Discovery family of channels was intended for ""thinking people"". Now it is little more than pop culture programming aimed at the mindless sheep with attention spans of 15 seconds or less, and no appreciation for detail or accuracy. There are many errors in this series, such as inaccurate specifications on some of the aircraft, and inaccurately rendered aircraft in the animations. The video clips often are not even of the aircraft involved, but the same old worn out stock footage we see everywhere else. Many of the animated flight regimes are simplistic and cartoon-like; showing aircraft performing unrealistic maneuvers. The ""camera"" that shakes when aircraft fly by is MADDENING. Why does everything have to be aimed at the common denominator?

With all of that said, it is a good show, compared to what else is available out there. Not just good, but really good. So good in fact that I gave it 4 stars.

3173355,5,B0017KXD1U,"Yes, there are still a few of us who've been building model airplanes since we were kids... and ""Dogfights"" reminds us that the models we build today are based on the machines that helped decide who won or lost the battles, as told by the men who flew them.

This series is excellent, because it shows us what the men who flew these warbirds had to do, even if it meant disobeying an order, having to invent a new maneuver, or force a plane to do a job it was never meant for---and emerging alive to tell the tale. If you like suspense, ""Dogfights"" has plenty of that. We also learn that good airmanship is nothing to skimp on, and is every bit as important in deciding which pilots come home and which don't, as the reliability of the aircraft themselves.

We also get some technical background on the planes themselves, and even a few bits of the design philosophies that went into their construction. Sadly, only a few of these planes have survived to the present day... but then again, they were built to fight wars rather than last for decades as museum displays.

3173371,3,B0017KXD1U,"Overall, this is a good series for those interested in air combat.  The stories are generally good, complete with first-hand accounts, interviews with the actual pilots, and good computerized graphics.  The format has been overly simplified for general consumption.  An example of this is the aircraft comparison match up.  They would provide three or four categories, sometimes changing the category, and put check marks under the aircraft that had the edge.

There are some inaccuracies with aircraft specifications, armaments, performance, and mission profiles.  Sometimes, when describing the aircraft, they would show the wrong model with its performance specifications.  For example, in a particular engagement, the pilot few a P-51B, and the model shown, with specs, was the P-51D.  While the correct model was used in the actual CG combat sequence, there are key differences between the two models that were completely looked over and ignored.

Some glaring mistakes with the CG segments include missiles clearly shown on wing racks, after a combat sequence, when the pilot is supposed to be out of weapons.  Another example of CG inaccuracy is the having a missile exploding against enemy aircraft, blowing off a wing, when the actual written accounts from the pilot describes the heat seeking missile flying up the tailpipe to detonate inside.  The CG depiction and sound effects of firing the M61A1 Vulcan cannon is not only completely inaccurate, but comical.  The stock film footage shown tends to be the over used clips, often seen in other documentaries.

Jargon and slang aren't always explained, neither are many technical concepts like energy levels, flight envelopes, thrust to weight ratios, wing loading, target aspect, etc.  There are also the occasional misuse of the word ""bogey"" (an unidentified target) instead of ""bandit"" (confirmed enemy target).

Other criticism involve subject matter.  While all the stories are riveting and rich with heroic exploits, not a single episode is shown from an ""enemy"" perspective.  Don't get me wrong.  I love the U.S.A.  I think we have the best military in the world.  However, we miss out on what makes air combat so dramatic.  By the time I was halfway through the series, the menace, the danger, the potential threat was not there.  The enemies weren't presented to be formidable.  The American pilot always over comes the bad guy or multiple bad guys, and flies off into the sunset victorious, with not a scratch on his airplane.

We are missing out on some of the great aces of WWII.  Lt. Gen. Gunther Rall was with us until October of 2009.  Did we get to have any interviews with him, or learn about any of his exploits against the Allies in his Bf-109?  No.  This guy had 275 air victories.  He must have been doing something right.  Do we hear anything about him?  Only a passing mention by Chuck Yeager, saying that he was his good friend.  The Luftwaffe was the terror of the skies, and when ""Bud"" Anderson tangled with a Bf-109 veteran pilot, and won, it was a great accomplishment.  Instead, it felt more like the ""ho-hum"" predictable, victory.  Erich Hartman, the Ace of Aces with 352 kills would have been a great subject.  Even an episode on Russian aces, flying Yaks, MiGs, or American planes in WWII would have been wonderful!

Instead of we see the plight of Taffy III, ""a small U.S. task unit of tin can destroyers and baby flat-tops, in the 1944 Battle of Samar"", and the sinking of the Yamato, and the hunt for the Bismark.  I'm sorry, but THESE AREN'T DOGFIGHTS!!!  Some air combat is involved in these scenarios, but I watched the series for Air to Air Combat, not sea battles.  It's like giving tickets to a demolition derby, to a NASCAR fan.  Still enjoyable, but not what he or she really wants to see.

The GC gets better in season two, but the stories, while interesting, continue to produce the same level of excitement, contrary to the pounding repetitiveness of the accompanying musical score.

Despite the many criticisms, this is still a worthwhile series.  True historical enthusiasts might find it a bit rudimentary and benign, but the eye candy is still appealing.",1267401600,25,4164,4.9480519480519485

3173377,5,B0017KXD1U,"I am a professional aviation artist known for my realistic and meticulously-researched depictions of military aviation history.  With that out of the way, and in regards to some reviews here hinting, in effect, that this series is more video game rather than a Ph. D.-level take on the subject (I don't think it ever pretends to be so), I absolutely love this series!

Each episode is a very well put together ""look"" at specific aerial combat actions, with a fine balance of narrative, stock historical footage, expert commentary (including distinguished historians, current operators of the airplane(s) in question, and of course the actual pilots featured in each story), and finally the CGI itself depicting the action.  The CGI graphics are amazing, on a level of realism that very nicely enhances rather than detracts from each episode, as it well could have ... though as a parent and thus a regular viewer of so-called children's DVDs I would pay big money to see what the magicians at Pixar could do with this subject (ever seen CARS?  Stunning art in every sense of the word) ... but I digress.

Per my occupation, if I'm feeling a little ""artist's block"" every once in a while I'll pop in one of these DVDs and watch an episode - or two!  Then I'm suddenly motivated to get at the current project, and I'm always getting aerial combat 'ideas' for future work viewing this series.  Kudos to THC for having two seasons ... more, more!!

3173379,1,B0017KXD1U,"This is NOT the series for you if you want an impartial, objective account of fighter-vs-fighter combat as researched from all points-of-view like we've had for decades. It is neither a documentary nor scientifically researched.

This IS the series for you if you want to be known as promoting the propaganda that only American-Israeli fighter-heroics count throughout world history.

Mis-leadingly advertised in various countries as ""all the greatest dogfights in history"" and ""all the greatest dogfights in the world"", this series focuses almost solely on US-Israeli victories and NEVER represents US-Israeli fighter-vs-fighter defeats. That's propaganda, not history nor documentary.

It can't even stick to the definition of dogfights as being ""aerial combat between two or more fighter planes.""

Typical representation of the rare non-US-Israeli victories are an obsolete Swordfish torpedo hitting Bismark, obsolete Kamikazes and gunless German suicide planes, even Kamikaze mini-subs.

Even when representing a British fighter-plane, those involved in the series are so biased they had to use one of the rare American volunteers shooting down the likes of unarmed liason planes rather than one of the vast majority of Brit/Cdn Mosquito aces shooting down even 30 true fighters like the FW190.

Friend or foe, the series is no less offensive to the heroics and memory of non-American-Israeli fighter-pilots let alone fighter designs.

Typical themes are:
German Me262 jet-fighter downs RAF Mosquito, US P51D downs German Me262 jet-fighter.
US-Israeli fighter-pilots defeat many times their number of the best enemy fighter-planes, opposite for all others.

Recently these so-called History programs appear, instead, to be the kind of propaganda I'd expect from some Communist Regime.

Very disappointed, had to sell my copies for quite a loss.
Even then I received a complaint from the buyer who said he uses them as 'drink coasters' anymore.",1238284800,18,1947,5.595238095238095
3173380,5,B0017KXD1U,"Seasons One and Two of ""Dogfights"" compliment each other so well that I highly recommend buying both disc sets at one time.

The CGI is fabulous.  The resulting visuals are arresting, much more lifelike than actual combat footage, which tends to be grainy or washed out.  The CGI is so accurate that even the reflections on the fuselage of each aircraft follow the sun as the pilots maintain an orbit above or around a target, or pursue their enemy.  The sequences of aerial combat are very fluid and very close to the sort of dogfight scenarios that one might visualize without having had the actual experience of air combat.

The two sets of nine discs have some really beautiful highlights:  ""Long Odds"", a segment that features ""Old 666"", a B-17 outfitted with thirteen .50 calibre machine guns and heavier armament.  That Flying Fortress was tasked with the reconnaissance of Japanese troop movements over various land locations.  Old 666 was  involved in a 45-minute dogfight, facing an overwhelming Japanese presence.  Its pilot, Jay Zeamer won the Medal of Honor for his heroism.  Ultimately, the crew of Old 666 became the most Highly decorated B-17 crew of WWII.  A great story.

""The Luftwaffe's Deadliest Mission"" depicts the unique mission of the SonderKommando Elbe, and elite group of German pilots mustered together in a last ditch effort to stop the allies from entering Deutchland: Using stripped down ME109's, the mission of each pilot was to seek out and ram Allied B-17 and B-24's in Kamikaze fashion.  The CGI is great, but the interviews with two of the surviving pilots is especially interesting.

Other notable episodes about World War II also feature CGI depicting aerial engagements involving naval vessels: ""The Hunt for the Bismark""  and ""Death of the Japanese Navy"". The latter episode is a CGI adaptation of the actions surrounding Taffy III, and how that task force, which was cut off from the rest of the US Pacific fleet for a few days, managed to inflict serious damage on Japanese naval forces in the straights of the Phillipine islands.

Also noteworthy is ""The Tuskegee Airmen"" which goes into specific detail about the heroic exploits of the Brave African-Americans who flew P-51 Mustangs in covering missions for the B-24's and B-17's that flew combat missions in the skies over Romania and southern Europe.

Other Highlights:  ""Death of the Luftwaffe"" chronicles Operation Bodenplatte, which took place on New Year's day, 1945 against a forawrd American airbase in Europe; And ""Secret Weapons""  which are accurate depictions of the ME-262, the Kamikaze, and remotely controlled airplanes.

I counted about three episodes about the air war in Korea, which include ""Supersonic"" and ""Jet vs. Jet"".  Again, great CGI.  Ace Pilots Frederick ""Boots"" Blesse, Robbie Risner and Ralph Parr give great commentary.  The leap in jet technology and the effect it had on aerial combat and the resulting high speed problems each pilot faced are explained in surprising detail.

Of particular interest is the inclusion of about a half-dozen episodes that depict the F4 Phantom and the various missions assigned to their Pilots and Radar Intercept Officers.
I'm a huge fan of the F4 Phantom and the pilots that flew them, so these episodes are truly amazing to me. It's difficult for me to imagine to be at the top front of all that raw power.

""Hell Over Hanoi"" with commentary by Fred Olmsted and Dan Cherry F4 is great. ""Air Ambush"" with commentary by legendary Air Force Ace Robin Olds is also something to see.  That episode has a brief flashback - sort of a story within a story - to his days as a P-38 combat pilot in the skies over western Europe during World War II.

""One Inch from Out of Control,""  features commentary by Willie ""Irish"" Driscoll and Randy ""Duke"" Cunningham and is simply put, amazing.  At the controls of the USS Constallation's VF-96 ""Showtime 100,"" the Pilot and RIO score three MIG kills and escape a Surface to Air Missile hit which tears their Phantom apart and with only nanoseconds to spare, eject into the waters of the south China Sea.

Other noteworthy Phantom sequences: ""The Bloodiest Day"" which depicts the May 10, 1972 bombing mission of the Hai Dong Railyards, and ""Gun Kills of Vietnam,"" which shows how effective the addition of a gun pod on the F4 was.

""Dogfights of Desert Storm"" is also covered extensively in one episode, and on another disc, an episode covering the exploits of the Israeli Air Defense Force is also included.

There isn't much about World War I, but the series' introductory episode feautres a segment devoted to Eddie Rickenbacker and the techniques of aerial combat that he and other notables such as Manfred Von Richtoffen helped to develop and are still studied by combat pilots today.

To its credit, the History Channel also put together a CGI series that dealt more with ground combat in World War II, but the CGI didn't work all that well.  Even though the historical information was accurately depicted, the CGI wasn't nearly what it should have been mostly by virtue of the complicated nature of recreating computer-generated human beings.  In other words, the soldiers didn't look real.

""Dogfights"" Seasons One and Two are two dvd sets that I highly recommend.  Devotees of air combat will find themselves watching many of these episodes several times to get all of the nuance of the air engagements depicted on these dvds.",1233532800,20,5427,4.929592959295929

3173382,4,B0017KXD1U,"This series is the best I've seen yet on a technical basis. They have taken the computer technology that I first saw in the 'Dogfights' series and blended it with actual combat footage and pictures from the war.  In many cases the footage/pictures are of the actual incident/ships that were involved.
  One of the things that was appealing about the show when it was first broadcast was the very limited commercial interruption that took place, so I thought it was appropriate that Enterprise Rental was still mentioned in the leadin of each episode.  The fact that the founder of Enterprise served on that ship in the war and named his company after his ship is a perfect example of the spirit of service of those who served on her and in the war in general.  It shows why the name 'Greatest Generation' is so well deserved for those men and women who pulled our country through that dark time in our history.
  One footnote though, and the reason I only gave it four stars is due to the packaging. The steel book itself is neat, but the plastic retainers that hold the dvds in place make it nearly impossible to remove the dvd.

Incredible feats of human bravery are expertly demonstrated and narrated, as man and machine go head to head in the theatres of aerial combat throughout the 20th century.

Tactical descriptions and life and death situations are told by the fighter jocks themselves, mostly with an American slant.

Flight dynamics and aerial maneuvers are dissected and demonstrated with dynamically exciting and realistic CGI graphics animation, and also including some original footage.

3407759,5,B0017KXD1U,"This series kicks ass! Nearly perfect in every respect.

Each episode documents four or five historical air-to-air dogfights. Most segments feature combat from wars from WW1 through Vietnam (one segment deals with the Gulf (Kuwait) War and one with air combat in the Balkans in the mid-1990s. Fewer fights from WW1 are featured; most are from WW2 through Vietnam).

Most of the presentations are done in CGI, but this is CGI done so well that it displays near-photographic quality. Although Dogfights aired ten years ago, you wouldn't guess it from the quality of the computer graphics. The accompanying music is also first-rate.

The CGI presentation is enhanced with short inline segments of commentary from some of the pilots involved in the combat, many even from WW2. Many episodes show archival footage of the actual aircraft and men during the war. So-called ""ribbon"" diagrams are often used to showcase the maneuvers and tactics that the aircraft executed in their dogfights. This is supplemented side-by-side comparisons of the capabilities and advantages/disadvantages of each aircraft in the fight. Often the view from the pilot in the cockpit is shown to give his perspective on the aerial situation. Every episode is introduced with an explanation of the historical context of the war in which the dogfight takes place, and the starting  circumstances of each dogfight.

Most of the episodes focus on American fighter pilots and combats involving allied pilots (like the British and Israelis). Very few of their Axis/Korean/Vietnamese/Russian opponents are portrayed in such detail. One exception is the episode ""The Luftwaffe's Deadliest Mission"" which documents the mssions of Sonderkommando Elbe which was ordered to bring down Allied bombers by ramming them. Two of the Luftwaffe pilots who survived after ramming their targets (Heinrich Henkel and Klaus Hahn) were interviewed. Watching the  episodes dealing with the Vietnam War (among them The Bloodiest Day, AIr Ambush (Operation Bolo), and Hell Over Hanoi) the viewer would be led to believe that the USN and USAF totally ruled the skies over Vietnam; however, this was hardly the case.

The last disk contains the 90-minute ""Dogfights of the Future"". Naturally the Fifth Generation F-22 and F-35 aircraft feature prominently. A scenario is presented in which they square off against the air force of some unspecified rogue state equipped with Russian Migs and Sukhois, along with some French Rafales. The moral of this story is that stealth technology will rule the skies and that all non-stealth aircraft are only helpless targets. The writers of the episode do make the point that the swarms of enemy Fourth Generation aircraft will likely deplete the limited missile-carrying capacity of the stealth 5th Gen fighters, and that other solutions may be necessary like the proposed Boeing (Rockwell) B-1R, which is a B-1B modified with the F-119 turbofans of the F-22, an AESA air-to-air radar and fire control system, and racks for dozens of AIM-120 antiaircraft missiles. (note the latest proposal for an F-15 variant doubles the number of air-to-air missiles carried). The writers of the episode do point out that enemies may contrive some anti-stealth technology like low-frequency radar, but it's not likely to upset the overall balance of power. Also better surface-to-air missile technologies built into integrated air defense systems are likely to threaten future air campaigns over enemy territory. And then they go on to point out that eventually America's enemies will develop their own 5th Generation competitor aircraft that will necessitate further advances in technology. Finally, the arena of warfare will expand into space and threaten America's dependence on satellite assets in Earth orbit, and this will spur the deployment of hypersonic aircraft capable of fighting in this new realm of combat.

For decades, no movie or documentary has been able capture the true essence of a dogfight because of this limitation. Even the movie Top Gun, while having great dogfight scenes, never really gave you a sense of the whole dogfight. Only certain aspects of it.

This documentary is the closest I have ever seen of what it feels like to be in the middle of a dogfight. The CG is beautifully rendered but more importantly, how the graphics are used to explain and visualize the dogfight is what sets this apart from anything I've seen before.

I give this 4 stars and not 5 for one reason only... don't waste such beautifully realized computer graphics on DVD alone. Make a Blu Ray version of this series and I will snatch it up faster than an F22 on full afterburner.",1417737600,,908,4.496969696969697

3407831,4,B0017KXD1U,"I enjoyed the Dogfights dvd box set immensley. It arrived sealed and in mint condition and the speed with which it was dispatched was impressive.

This documentary analyses some of the most spectacular aerial dogfights on record from the skies above the Western Front during WW1, the skies over Europe and the Pacific theatres during WW2 and the more recent conflicts including Korea, Vietnam, the Middle East and the First Gulf War.

The narration is concise and comprehensive and introduces the battle explaining how each 'dogfight' unfolded using state of the art CGI, interviews with the actual pilots involved, analysis of the aircraft and the tactics of the time. All this is also joined by film footage of the time and a step by step explanation of what happened and why without unduly 'milking' the event.

An excellent series delivered in an excellent manner. My only complaints(if any) is that the discs for season 2 are of the American variety and can only be viewed on TV via a PC. Additionally the show was designed around a TV audience with commercial breaks in mind so that every 15 minutes there is a 2 minute recap on what has happened so far as if viewers have just returned from a commercial break and need some brief revision. This can be slightly annoying but as long as viewers understand this it doesn't pose a major problem. Other than that however I thought this was an excellent purchase.",1375833600,,1414,4.763265306122449
3407832,5,B0017KXD1U,"Half of it feels like you're in the cockpit; the other half is like a classroom of dogfight tactics, with 3-D live action diagrams charting every offensive move and defensive response -- never letting you forget that these are real live plane against plane dogfights where only one pilot survives!

The best CGI brings the classic air battles to life: WWI, WWII, Korea, Viet Nam, the Middle East, and even air battles of the supersonic future - and you get a ring-side seat.  Animation that feels like a hand-held camera that searches the skies and suddenly zooms in and finds your prey - or predators.  Tense, riveting narration.  All this brings the immediacy of the combat to your screen.

This series is not for everyone.  If you prefer The Good Wives Club, pass on this.  But if Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan are in your collection, definitely add this one too.  You'll enjoy every moment, and watch it - and learn more than you ever guessed you didn't know - again and again and again.",1374710400,,1001,4.6158192090395485

The dogfight are so real and the explanation of what you seeing on the screen is outstanding.  You can almost learn to fly by the instructions the narrator provides.

The animation gives a better appreciation for what you read about in books or see in the traditional style documentaries. It's also an eye opener for those outside this area of interest. They get an understanding of what air combat is about and the changes that have occurred through history.
 The biggest negative is that the discs are exact copies of the TV series. Since it was made for television there are numerous spots for commercials. Watching it on DVD without the ads is a choppy experience with abrupt breaks in the action. Each segment then ""begins again"" with a quick recap of what you've seen already, annoying enough when watching a cable broadcast and more so on DVD. As with most current documentaries it goes a bit over the top with the dramatic narration and background score, IMHO.",1359504000,,867,4.858108108108108

Some accounts gripping, witty, and downright scary as the then young airmen diced with death amid the clouds. The survivors give gripping accounts of their experiences and this who set makes for an important document on the conflicts that shaped the 20th Century and why we fought and for what. Markings and Units are accurately portrayed as far as I could see on the CG's and some segments looked very realistic which could never be even be seen using period gun camaras which only showed blurred, 'jumpy' images and the jarring of ther guns going off.

3407845,4,B0017KXD1U,"I've now watched both seasons.  I bought this after reading Cray-Zee Asian's 3-star review below.  He or she is 100% spot on with comments and critiques.  But I give this 4 stars.  The reason is the occasional animations illustrating combat maneuvers.  I wish there had been more of them and less repetetive narration (every segment begins with a 'recap' of the preceding segment, in case you just tuned in).  The moving illustrations of the split-S, scissors, etc. are worth the price of the DVDs to me because they helped me understand combat in 3-dimensions, and energy management (not that there's a lot of explanation in the episodes, because there isn't).  And there are unusual stories that were new to me.  I'd also note that the series falls off a bit discussing anything after Vietnam -- it's pretty clear that modern air combat is much more push-button and less dogfighting, but the narration churns away as though nothing's changed.  There's one small comment from an Israeli pilot of long experience who doesn't like the F-16 compared to his Mirage III, and I think an episode wondering if the days of dogfighting are long over, and giving vent to similar sentiments, wouldn't have gone down better than the hackneyed ""carrying on the traditions of the first dogfighters"" theme.  But if you're interested in air combat and are confused by reading pilot narratives full of jargon, this DVD series is a good ""unraveller"" that will increase your understanding of what these heroic guys and gals do.",1348099200,,1508,4.924901185770751
3407846,5,B0017KXD1U,"CGI graphics have been around for some time now, but I think they have found their niche' in the various historical recreations done for the History Channel. No other technology lets you virtually rebuild Rome and other sites of architectural interest.

The same can be said of the CGI recreation in the show Dogfights, which recreate various famous battles during the last century of aerial combat.
What separates this show from other CGI fare is that you get a glimpse of the surviving pilots and firsthand knowledge of their tactics. CGI allows a battle to be filmed from various angles,that would be painstaking using traditional animation and a drudgery using stop motion animation.  Planes and tactics are matched up using slick graphics using side by side comparisons. Ultimately, though it is the pilot that makes the difference, evidenced by inferior Wildcats downing Zeros in the battle of the Guadalcanal.

The show also went for the historical importance by doing an episode of the Tuskegee airmen, the first African American fighter group, who not only had to fight Jim Crow, but also the Nazis. Their outstanding combat record paved the way during the civil right movement and integrated the armed forces. They were very effective at protecting the bombers and even downed a few Nazi's Me262 jet fighters

A  poignant episodes concerned the sinking of the great German Battle Ship, the Bismarck. This was the last great battle ship and it was brought down by biplane Swordfish torpedo bombers. When it sank the battleship claim to the seas vanished.

One of the most interesting episodes is when Robin Olds tries to fool Migs squadrons that his squadron of F4s are really lumbering F-105 thunderchiefts. The trick of course was to surprise the Migs with the far more capable Phantom. Olds got to even the score.

The show is more than just slick graphics, but actually puts you in the pilot's mind as you experience the terror and excitement of aerial warfare.",1341792000,,1974,4.963636363636364
3407847,5,B0017KXD1U,"My son (age 7) and I enjoy this series. The CGI is not ""realistic"" as in the movies but it is done well so you get a clear understanding and visualization of the aerial combat. The videos do not include a whole lot of blood and gore (I can't recall any at the moment) so they are tame enough (caveat, see below) for my son to watch. The first-hand accounts from the pilots adds a great deal to the experience and keeps the episodes from being a series of desensitizing video games. The series does show violence (as any combat related show would) and the narration and the pilots accounts do talk about killing and seeing their comrades and enemies being killed. So if you allow a child to watch, you should watch with them so you can talk about it with your child.",1339632000,,765,4.319444444444445

3407850,5,B0017KXD1U,"""Dogfights"" are possibly the most impressive document on air warfare I ever saw. From the very first episode I was absolutely impressed with the quality of reconstructions, the care accorded to details and the passionate tone of narration. From World War I to the air fights over Kosovo in 1999, all episodes are extremely interesting and the fights described very well chosen. Many of those true stories are more incredible that some of the episodes seen in action movies! Also, authors made the remarkable effort to interview almost all the pilots who REALLY fought in those engagements, to preserve their testimony as long as they are still alive! For obvious reasons they couldn't do it for pilots of World War I, but even then they found some old records of WWI veterans taken in the 40s! To hear the testimony of people who actually faced German Fokkers in 1918 over France is a unique thing. Those interviews, excellent graphics explaining all the moves and CGI images showing the reconstruction of actual fights make those series an absolutely unique document!

I loved every single minute of every single episode but my absolute favorites are:

Season 1, episode 1: Mig Alley (Korean War)
Season 1, episode 2: Air Ambush - Operation ""Bolo"" (Vietnam War)
Season 1, episode 3: Flying Tigers - is there any need to say more?
Season 1, episode 5: Hell over Hanoi (Vietnam War)
Season 1, episode 8: Death of Japanese navy (Battle of Leyte) - with the accent put this time more on the naval fight
Season 1, episode 10: Long Odds - including the TRUE story of a dogfight between a single SBD Dauntless bomber and three successive Zero fighters (Battle of Coral Sea)
Season 1, episode 11: Dogfights of the Middle East (Six Days War, Yom Kippur War)

Season 2, episode 1: Kamikaze! In my opinion the second best in the whole series - three jaw dropping and absolutely TRUE stories; the one about the lonely fight of destroyer USS ""Laffey"" against a swarm of kamikazes on 15 April 1945 is especially poignant!
Season 2, episode 2: Luftwaffe's Deadliest Mission: the BEST and the most INCREDIBLE but TRUE story in the whole series! I do not want to provide spoilers, but if you really want to know what this is about, you can check on the web ""Sonderkommando Elbe"" - or you can simply watch this episode and enjoy the surprise...
Season 2, episode 5: Gun kills of Vietnam - canon fights in missile era - three incredible fights including one in which outdated WWII era turbo propelled planes faced MiG-17s...
Season 2, episode 8: No room for error - low altitude dog fights (WW II, Korean War, Vietnam War)
Season 2, episode 9: Night Fighters - less known planes on sometimes surprising missions - inluding a raid by two (yes, only two!) F6 Hellcats (night versions) against a large Japanese air and naval base...
Season 2, episode 10: The bloodiest day (Vietnam War)
Season 2, episode 16: Death of the Luftwaffe - the gigantic air battle (about 3000 fighters involved in all of which about 1000 Germans and about 2000 allied) over Belgium and Netherlands during the Operation ""Bodenplatte"", 1 January 1945...
Season 2, episode 18: Dogfights of the future - an episode longer than previous ones, showing some very surprising technologies, which are already under development...

Now, those series have also some limitations. The CGI images are really not on the ""Star Wars"" quality - but the stories are so passionate, that it doesn't matter any more after a couple of minutes. There are some (very, very limited) factual errors but you need to REALLY know your WWII airplanes to notice them.

Now, those series are almost totally American oriented and they mostly describe achievements of American pilots. The only few exceptions are accorded to the Israelis (two episodes), the Germans (two episodes), the Japanese (the Kamikaze episode) and the British (the ""Hunt for Bismarck"" episode). Also, those series are also very patriotic and even ""gung ho""... I for one have absolutely NO problem with that, but people who are radically left winged can get very upset very fast, especially in all the episodes about Vietnam War...

To conclude, I consider those series as one of the best purchases I ever made shopping for documents on DVD! They are a treasure and a must for anybody interested in aviation and/or in military history!",1327363200,,4328,4.84979702300406
3407851,4,B0017KXD1U,"Unfortunately, as with many other newer shows, this one is ""dumbed down"" for the masses. At one time, the Discovery family of channels was intended for ""thinking people"". Now it is little more than pop culture programming aimed at the mindless sheep with attention spans of 15 seconds or less, and no appreciation for detail or accuracy. There are many errors in this series, such as inaccurate specifications on some of the aircraft, and inaccurately rendered aircraft in the animations. The video clips often are not even of the aircraft involved, but the same old worn out stock footage we see everywhere else. Many of the animated flight regimes are simplistic and cartoon-like; showing aircraft performing unrealistic maneuvers. The ""camera"" that shakes when aircraft fly by is MADDENING. Why does everything have to be aimed at the common denominator?

With all of that said, it is a good show, compared to what else is available out there. Not just good, but really good. So good in fact that I gave it 4 stars.

3407852,5,B0017KXD1U,"Yes, there are still a few of us who've been building model airplanes since we were kids... and ""Dogfights"" reminds us that the models we build today are based on the machines that helped decide who won or lost the battles, as told by the men who flew them.

This series is excellent, because it shows us what the men who flew these warbirds had to do, even if it meant disobeying an order, having to invent a new maneuver, or force a plane to do a job it was never meant for---and emerging alive to tell the tale. If you like suspense, ""Dogfights"" has plenty of that. We also learn that good airmanship is nothing to skimp on, and is every bit as important in deciding which pilots come home and which don't, as the reliability of the aircraft themselves.

We also get some technical background on the planes themselves, and even a few bits of the design philosophies that went into their construction. Sadly, only a few of these planes have survived to the present day... but then again, they were built to fight wars rather than last for decades as museum displays.

3407868,3,B0017KXD1U,"Overall, this is a good series for those interested in air combat.  The stories are generally good, complete with first-hand accounts, interviews with the actual pilots, and good computerized graphics.  The format has been overly simplified for general consumption.  An example of this is the aircraft comparison match up.  They would provide three or four categories, sometimes changing the category, and put check marks under the aircraft that had the edge.

There are some inaccuracies with aircraft specifications, armaments, performance, and mission profiles.  Sometimes, when describing the aircraft, they would show the wrong model with its performance specifications.  For example, in a particular engagement, the pilot few a P-51B, and the model shown, with specs, was the P-51D.  While the correct model was used in the actual CG combat sequence, there are key differences between the two models that were completely looked over and ignored.

Some glaring mistakes with the CG segments include missiles clearly shown on wing racks, after a combat sequence, when the pilot is supposed to be out of weapons.  Another example of CG inaccuracy is the having a missile exploding against enemy aircraft, blowing off a wing, when the actual written accounts from the pilot describes the heat seeking missile flying up the tailpipe to detonate inside.  The CG depiction and sound effects of firing the M61A1 Vulcan cannon is not only completely inaccurate, but comical.  The stock film footage shown tends to be the over used clips, often seen in other documentaries.

Jargon and slang aren't always explained, neither are many technical concepts like energy levels, flight envelopes, thrust to weight ratios, wing loading, target aspect, etc.  There are also the occasional misuse of the word ""bogey"" (an unidentified target) instead of ""bandit"" (confirmed enemy target).

Other criticism involve subject matter.  While all the stories are riveting and rich with heroic exploits, not a single episode is shown from an ""enemy"" perspective.  Don't get me wrong.  I love the U.S.A.  I think we have the best military in the world.  However, we miss out on what makes air combat so dramatic.  By the time I was halfway through the series, the menace, the danger, the potential threat was not there.  The enemies weren't presented to be formidable.  The American pilot always over comes the bad guy or multiple bad guys, and flies off into the sunset victorious, with not a scratch on his airplane.

We are missing out on some of the great aces of WWII.  Lt. Gen. Gunther Rall was with us until October of 2009.  Did we get to have any interviews with him, or learn about any of his exploits against the Allies in his Bf-109?  No.  This guy had 275 air victories.  He must have been doing something right.  Do we hear anything about him?  Only a passing mention by Chuck Yeager, saying that he was his good friend.  The Luftwaffe was the terror of the skies, and when ""Bud"" Anderson tangled with a Bf-109 veteran pilot, and won, it was a great accomplishment.  Instead, it felt more like the ""ho-hum"" predictable, victory.  Erich Hartman, the Ace of Aces with 352 kills would have been a great subject.  Even an episode on Russian aces, flying Yaks, MiGs, or American planes in WWII would have been wonderful!

Instead of we see the plight of Taffy III, ""a small U.S. task unit of tin can destroyers and baby flat-tops, in the 1944 Battle of Samar"", and the sinking of the Yamato, and the hunt for the Bismark.  I'm sorry, but THESE AREN'T DOGFIGHTS!!!  Some air combat is involved in these scenarios, but I watched the series for Air to Air Combat, not sea battles.  It's like giving tickets to a demolition derby, to a NASCAR fan.  Still enjoyable, but not what he or she really wants to see.

The GC gets better in season two, but the stories, while interesting, continue to produce the same level of excitement, contrary to the pounding repetitiveness of the accompanying musical score.

Despite the many criticisms, this is still a worthwhile series.  True historical enthusiasts might find it a bit rudimentary and benign, but the eye candy is still appealing.",1267401600,25,4164,4.9480519480519485

3407874,5,B0017KXD1U,"I am a professional aviation artist known for my realistic and meticulously-researched depictions of military aviation history.  With that out of the way, and in regards to some reviews here hinting, in effect, that this series is more video game rather than a Ph. D.-level take on the subject (I don't think it ever pretends to be so), I absolutely love this series!

Each episode is a very well put together ""look"" at specific aerial combat actions, with a fine balance of narrative, stock historical footage, expert commentary (including distinguished historians, current operators of the airplane(s) in question, and of course the actual pilots featured in each story), and finally the CGI itself depicting the action.  The CGI graphics are amazing, on a level of realism that very nicely enhances rather than detracts from each episode, as it well could have ... though as a parent and thus a regular viewer of so-called children's DVDs I would pay big money to see what the magicians at Pixar could do with this subject (ever seen CARS?  Stunning art in every sense of the word) ... but I digress.

Per my occupation, if I'm feeling a little ""artist's block"" every once in a while I'll pop in one of these DVDs and watch an episode - or two!  Then I'm suddenly motivated to get at the current project, and I'm always getting aerial combat 'ideas' for future work viewing this series.  Kudos to THC for having two seasons ... more, more!!

3407876,1,B0017KXD1U,"This is NOT the series for you if you want an impartial, objective account of fighter-vs-fighter combat as researched from all points-of-view like we've had for decades. It is neither a documentary nor scientifically researched.

This IS the series for you if you want to be known as promoting the propaganda that only American-Israeli fighter-heroics count throughout world history.

Mis-leadingly advertised in various countries as ""all the greatest dogfights in history"" and ""all the greatest dogfights in the world"", this series focuses almost solely on US-Israeli victories and NEVER represents US-Israeli fighter-vs-fighter defeats. That's propaganda, not history nor documentary.

It can't even stick to the definition of dogfights as being ""aerial combat between two or more fighter planes.""

Typical representation of the rare non-US-Israeli victories are an obsolete Swordfish torpedo hitting Bismark, obsolete Kamikazes and gunless German suicide planes, even Kamikaze mini-subs.

Even when representing a British fighter-plane, those involved in the series are so biased they had to use one of the rare American volunteers shooting down the likes of unarmed liason planes rather than one of the vast majority of Brit/Cdn Mosquito aces shooting down even 30 true fighters like the FW190.

Friend or foe, the series is no less offensive to the heroics and memory of non-American-Israeli fighter-pilots let alone fighter designs.

Typical themes are:
German Me262 jet-fighter downs RAF Mosquito, US P51D downs German Me262 jet-fighter.
US-Israeli fighter-pilots defeat many times their number of the best enemy fighter-planes, opposite for all others.

Recently these so-called History programs appear, instead, to be the kind of propaganda I'd expect from some Communist Regime.

Very disappointed, had to sell my copies for quite a loss.
Even then I received a complaint from the buyer who said he uses them as 'drink coasters' anymore.",1238284800,18,1947,5.595238095238095
3407877,5,B0017KXD1U,"Seasons One and Two of ""Dogfights"" compliment each other so well that I highly recommend buying both disc sets at one time.

The CGI is fabulous.  The resulting visuals are arresting, much more lifelike than actual combat footage, which tends to be grainy or washed out.  The CGI is so accurate that even the reflections on the fuselage of each aircraft follow the sun as the pilots maintain an orbit above or around a target, or pursue their enemy.  The sequences of aerial combat are very fluid and very close to the sort of dogfight scenarios that one might visualize without having had the actual experience of air combat.

The two sets of nine discs have some really beautiful highlights:  ""Long Odds"", a segment that features ""Old 666"", a B-17 outfitted with thirteen .50 calibre machine guns and heavier armament.  That Flying Fortress was tasked with the reconnaissance of Japanese troop movements over various land locations.  Old 666 was  involved in a 45-minute dogfight, facing an overwhelming Japanese presence.  Its pilot, Jay Zeamer won the Medal of Honor for his heroism.  Ultimately, the crew of Old 666 became the most Highly decorated B-17 crew of WWII.  A great story.

""The Luftwaffe's Deadliest Mission"" depicts the unique mission of the SonderKommando Elbe, and elite group of German pilots mustered together in a last ditch effort to stop the allies from entering Deutchland: Using stripped down ME109's, the mission of each pilot was to seek out and ram Allied B-17 and B-24's in Kamikaze fashion.  The CGI is great, but the interviews with two of the surviving pilots is especially interesting.

Other notable episodes about World War II also feature CGI depicting aerial engagements involving naval vessels: ""The Hunt for the Bismark""  and ""Death of the Japanese Navy"". The latter episode is a CGI adaptation of the actions surrounding Taffy III, and how that task force, which was cut off from the rest of the US Pacific fleet for a few days, managed to inflict serious damage on Japanese naval forces in the straights of the Phillipine islands.

Also noteworthy is ""The Tuskegee Airmen"" which goes into specific detail about the heroic exploits of the Brave African-Americans who flew P-51 Mustangs in covering missions for the B-24's and B-17's that flew combat missions in the skies over Romania and southern Europe.

Other Highlights:  ""Death of the Luftwaffe"" chronicles Operation Bodenplatte, which took place on New Year's day, 1945 against a forawrd American airbase in Europe; And ""Secret Weapons""  which are accurate depictions of the ME-262, the Kamikaze, and remotely controlled airplanes.

I counted about three episodes about the air war in Korea, which include ""Supersonic"" and ""Jet vs. Jet"".  Again, great CGI.  Ace Pilots Frederick ""Boots"" Blesse, Robbie Risner and Ralph Parr give great commentary.  The leap in jet technology and the effect it had on aerial combat and the resulting high speed problems each pilot faced are explained in surprising detail.

Of particular interest is the inclusion of about a half-dozen episodes that depict the F4 Phantom and the various missions assigned to their Pilots and Radar Intercept Officers.
I'm a huge fan of the F4 Phantom and the pilots that flew them, so these episodes are truly amazing to me. It's difficult for me to imagine to be at the top front of all that raw power.

""Hell Over Hanoi"" with commentary by Fred Olmsted and Dan Cherry F4 is great. ""Air Ambush"" with commentary by legendary Air Force Ace Robin Olds is also something to see.  That episode has a brief flashback - sort of a story within a story - to his days as a P-38 combat pilot in the skies over western Europe during World War II.

""One Inch from Out of Control,""  features commentary by Willie ""Irish"" Driscoll and Randy ""Duke"" Cunningham and is simply put, amazing.  At the controls of the USS Constallation's VF-96 ""Showtime 100,"" the Pilot and RIO score three MIG kills and escape a Surface to Air Missile hit which tears their Phantom apart and with only nanoseconds to spare, eject into the waters of the south China Sea.

Other noteworthy Phantom sequences: ""The Bloodiest Day"" which depicts the May 10, 1972 bombing mission of the Hai Dong Railyards, and ""Gun Kills of Vietnam,"" which shows how effective the addition of a gun pod on the F4 was.

""Dogfights of Desert Storm"" is also covered extensively in one episode, and on another disc, an episode covering the exploits of the Israeli Air Defense Force is also included.

There isn't much about World War I, but the series' introductory episode feautres a segment devoted to Eddie Rickenbacker and the techniques of aerial combat that he and other notables such as Manfred Von Richtoffen helped to develop and are still studied by combat pilots today.

To its credit, the History Channel also put together a CGI series that dealt more with ground combat in World War II, but the CGI didn't work all that well.  Even though the historical information was accurately depicted, the CGI wasn't nearly what it should have been mostly by virtue of the complicated nature of recreating computer-generated human beings.  In other words, the soldiers didn't look real.

""Dogfights"" Seasons One and Two are two dvd sets that I highly recommend.  Devotees of air combat will find themselves watching many of these episodes several times to get all of the nuance of the air engagements depicted on these dvds.",1233532800,20,5427,4.929592959295929

3407879,4,B0017KXD1U,"This series is the best I've seen yet on a technical basis. They have taken the computer technology that I first saw in the 'Dogfights' series and blended it with actual combat footage and pictures from the war.  In many cases the footage/pictures are of the actual incident/ships that were involved.
  One of the things that was appealing about the show when it was first broadcast was the very limited commercial interruption that took place, so I thought it was appropriate that Enterprise Rental was still mentioned in the leadin of each episode.  The fact that the founder of Enterprise served on that ship in the war and named his company after his ship is a perfect example of the spirit of service of those who served on her and in the war in general.  It shows why the name 'Greatest Generation' is so well deserved for those men and women who pulled our country through that dark time in our history.
  One footnote though, and the reason I only gave it four stars is due to the packaging. The steel book itself is neat, but the plastic retainers that hold the dvds in place make it nearly impossible to remove the dvd.

3407883,5,B0017KXD1U,My 6 year old son can't get enough of this series! The visuals are stunning and the stories are gripping. We have exhausted all the books on this subject in our local libraries and my husband is mapping out our future vacations according to all the aircraft museum locations on the eastern seaboard. We are looking forward to season 3.,1223337600,2,335,4.6
3407884,5,B0017KXD1U,"FInally something for the whole family. THe Kids will enjoy the action, violence and computer graphics. Mother's will salivate at the aged photographs of handsome young men; knights of a modern age dueling for some greater cause than themselves. Father's will focus on the strategy and the individual specs of the planes all done in the instantly intuitive style of a video game game player select screen. And finally Grandpa War Veteran will shake violently at the mere color imagery of Stukas and Zeros coming at the screen, the first color images of these aircraft in blazing combat maneuvers that have ever been by seen like this since the actual war..

It's got all the elements, drama, historical accuracy coupled with the slick educational value to anyone who ever wondered about the aerial dogfights of long ago. The only educational movie series I have ever watched and enjoyed since the future is wild or alien planet.",1219449600,8,928,4.948717948717949

8266326,1,B0017KXD1U,All the dogfight footage was filmed in high definition. The DVDs are in SD and letterboxed for old 4/3 ratio TVs. This should have been offered in 16/9 Blu-Ray. It never ceases to amaze me how the History Channel can take a show that's so good and ruin it by failing to present it properly on DVD.,1495411200,,297,4.228070175438597
