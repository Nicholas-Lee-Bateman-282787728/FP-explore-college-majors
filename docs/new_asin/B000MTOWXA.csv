2747915,5,B000MTOWXA,"I love this film!  I am a researcher in the area of sustainable agriculture and applaud the filmmakers on a superb job of pertraying the problems with agriculture and solutions.  The principles outlined can be put into practice around the world, not just in India.  There are ways to go even beyond organics (Beyond Organix, meaning organic PLUS testing for needed nutrients, adding minerals and beneficial bacteria to balance the soil so that it can produce bumper crops of pest-free produce that tastes great and has a long shelf-life.  Best of all it is extremely health-promoting while being good for the environment.)",1196726400,8,622,5.068627450980392
2747916,5,B000MTOWXA,"Fascinating look at agricultural land conservation, restoration and management after the green revolution had polluted Indian land.

Fantastic footage of rural and urban India (more rural than urban).

This is a good ""information-based"" documentary that engages the audience.

I bought this video as part of my undergraduate anthropological research and it has provided excellent references and generated new ideas for other research material directions.",1191542400,2,454,6.0625
2747917,5,B000MTOWXA,"I spent the winter in India this year and had the chance to meet three amazing humans who have dedicated their lives to the betterment of mankind.  They were Amma (see Darshan), the Dalai Lama and the amazing Peter Procter who lived two doors down from me.  Peter is a pioneer of the good future.  Do not waste a second about purchasing this dvd.  Watch it and learn!  Then pass it on to a friend.  Pure righteousness.  Peace!",1187136000,7,426,4.384615384615385
2747918,5,B000MTOWXA,"This is a very inspiring and interesting film.
Visually appealing and well produced, it takes the viewer on a tour of a number of farms in India and looks at their transformation since they adopted bio-dynamic farming methods. It shows how farming could be, and indeed is being, transformed by ending the 'war on nature' engaged in by agri-business and making peace with nature.

It shows how bio-dynamics is the rediscovery of ancient rythmns and that the world has the potential to not only feed itself but become more healthy in the process.

Another world is not only possible but is happening already.",1186963200,7,606,4.87378640776699
2747919,5,B000MTOWXA,"This is an outstandingly honest film which as many people as possible must see, if at least to become aware of the scale and intensity of industrialised farming and the effect biodynamic farming can have in restoring ecological (and social) balance. Biodynamic agriculture is shown by Peter Proctor to provide a simple, efficient and cost-effective means of restoring vitality, the life-force or ""mauri"" as we say in Aotearoa (NZ): healthy soil means healthy plants, animals and people.

Don't just watch this film, buy several copies because they make great gifts! with proceeds going towards the important work being done in India. Introduce as many people as you know to the wonderful simplicity of Rudolf Steiner's wisdom and hire your local cinema or school for a fundraising evening for Peter and Rachel or a local cause dear to your heart and home.

Coupled with humour, lightness and a beautiful soundtrack this is a must see.",1185753600,5,934,5.058441558441558
2747920,5,B000MTOWXA,This is such an important film for everyone to see - I never understood it could be possible to change the food we eat now one person at a time.  I live close to a big city but I have a yard and we will be changing everything we do after seeing this film.,1183680000,6,255,3.7222222222222223
2747921,5,B000MTOWXA,"If a picture is worth a thousand words - then this video is worth millions.  Humanity will take a great stride in guaranteeing its survival if we apply the biodynamic principles expressed in the film, 'How to Save the World'. In an artistic and engaging fashion - we learn about the application of biodynamic farming in India, and how successful and economical it is when compared to expensive and destructive chemical-dependent farming.  If you are into farming on a minor or major scale, or know someone who has a small garden in their backyard - the gift of this eye-opening film will be something they will forever thank you for.",1183593600,20,633,4.745454545454545
2747922,5,B000MTOWXA,"I'm so glad I stumbled upon this film.  Anyone interested in the organic food movement, and how Monsanto and other agribusiness firms have been harming the earth with their unsustainable ""green revolution"" will appreciate this wonderful DVD.  As another reviewer mentioned, the music and the scenes were mesmerizing.  Lots of beautiful shots of kids and people caring for their fields.  Seeing how farmers are reviving their land, health and spirits through mindful farming was inspiring.

I'm going to recommend this to my public library, and my natural foods store.

There are a couple other little-publicized documentaries on food that complement this film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Power-Of-Community-How-Cuba-Survived-Peak-Oil/dp/0910420327/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Power Of Community: How Cuba Survived Peak Oil</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Future-of-Food/dp/B000BQ5IXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Future of Food</a>",1180742400,28,1048,7.764705882352941

2747924,4,B000MTOWXA,"This was a great movie.  The Soundtrack and scenery were mesmerizing.  It's a very good introduction to Bio-Dynamic gardening.  The movie doesn't preach any of the practices shown here.  It shows the practice in use, without explaining much of what's behind it.  So If your already inclined to organic gardening and planting with phases of the moon, then this practice could be for you.  The movie was inspiring, thought provoking, and should set a new standard for the way (gardening/ organic gardening/ farming) how to videos should be done.  I've since purchased several books on the subject as a result of viewing this movie.",1173571200,6,629,4.990384615384615
8172162,5,B000MTOWXA,"A film about a man (he is 80 years who moves to India b/c he believes in his dream) who is trying to spread ideas regarding biodynamics.  The focus is on India and discusses the process of biodynamics in the first 2 chapters (30 minutes) and chapter 3 is about getting the communities involved.  Seeking to get farmers to go organic b/c it makes financial and ethical sense!  Competing against Monsanto, it is a David vs Goliath tale.  Chemicals kill humus and will eventually kill all the soil according to this man.  Chapter 4 starts off neat by going to a field that is over chemicalized and shows how it is dry, hard, and lifeless.  Nicely compares to a field from chapter 2 that is not over chemicalized.  Overall, a very good documentary on giving power back to farmers.",1464912000,,776,4.539568345323741
8172163,5,B000MTOWXA,"How To Save The World is an eye-opening documentary!  We can help to heal the soil
by implementing biodynamic/organic methods of gardening
and farming!",1388361600,,151,5.291666666666667
8172164,1,B000MTOWXA,"It is interesting to see what is being done in India. And to see how Monsanto is trying to limit agricultural options in India.  But, it was slow-moving and focused on the one country.",1276732800,,184,4.411764705882353
8172165,3,B000MTOWXA,"First of all, the message of this film is most commendable. I agree with nearly everything it professes.

However, as a documentary, I was quite disappointed. First of all, the necessary information was all presented in the first half of the film, i.e. explaining how Bio-Dynamics works, and the global benefits. The entire second half of the film just goes on to repeat the praises of organic and ethical farming. (Which we all know about, anyways.)

Secondly, the writing is weak-- even a bit annoying. First, the narrator calls Peter Proctor ""the father of modern Bio-Dynetics"". But actually we learn *Rudolph Steiner* invented it. (I guess Steiner is not the ""modern"" father since he only first lectured on it in the 1920's ??)

There are other incongruous and factually questionable declarations, but I'll leave it at that.

Finally, there is music CONSTANTLY in the fore or background. Several times something interesting was being said but I couldn't hear it because of the ubiquitous  global village-type music drowning everything out.(At times it sounded like those big oil TV commercials trying to come across Earth-friendly. You know the ones.)

So, again, I love the message, but the messanger kind of killed it for me.

Maybe thats because my expectations were high after just seeing ""We Feed the World"" by Erwin Wagonhofer. This guy went EVERYWHERE and interviewed EVERYBODY, from Brazilian shanty towns to Nestl corporate headquarters. And even though it wasn't perfect either, it was at times utterly riveting in its brutal objectivity.

I guess what ultimately bothered me about ""How to Save the World"", was that it's thinly veiled sentimental propaganda got in the way of the story.

Even still, its worth seeing, (if for no other reason than to be reminded what a god Rudoplh Steiner was).",1249430400,5,1808,5.0606060606060606
8172166,3,B000MTOWXA,"This last summer I spent working on a biodynamic farm, while I was there I watched this video. It has a very basic (and good if not a little big long) introduction to biodynamic agriculture (the way of farming invented by Rudolf Steiner - a mystic/occultist who lived in the 1800s) especially as applied in India.",1227916800,3,313,4.607142857142857
8172167,5,B000MTOWXA,Anyone concerned with life in this planet should see this movie. The best I've watched on biodynamics.,1213056000,2,102,5.0588235294117645
8172168,5,B000MTOWXA,"In a world of rapidly growing population and dwindling resources, this film offers hope. Modern agriculture is the process of turning petroleum into food via fertilisers, pesticides and the use of powerful tractors. But as oil and gas production begins to decline, and soils become exhausted, the world faces an imminent food crisis. The recent oil spikes and food price inflation of 2008 herald the disaster to come. However, Peter Proctor shows how soils can be rebuilt and crop yields boosted again by bio-dynamic methods that begin with composting based on cow manure. One farmer at at time, he is rebuilding the food production capacity of India, with a view to spreading the methods world-wide. But time is short. This could be the most important film you ever see. An inspirational film for all interested in Organic food, Environmentalism, Peak Oil and Self-Sufficency.",1209081600,4,877,5.13986013986014
8172169,5,B000MTOWXA,The DVD presents an inspiring picture of the work that Peter Proctor has done in India. I just returned from visiting one of the farmers who he has trained in India and it is clear to me that Peter was very successful in sharing the power of Biodynamics. I was most impressed .,1204070400,2,277,4.245283018867925
8172170,5,B000MTOWXA,"Highly recommended for those interested in: our food supply, a solution to GMO farming, and GMO farmings long term effects on the soil, environment and farmers.  In an entertaining way, it illustrates an active solution taking place in India right now; and is inspiring to watch.  I also recommend ""The Future of Food"" to further understand the problem.  Both are entertaining and can educate you on what is really happening to food and farmers in the USA and other countries.  You will feel better, knowing a solution does exist after watching this movie!",1201478400,7,556,4.946236559139785
8172171,5,B000MTOWXA,"This film shows how biodynamic farming offers a solution to stop and change a poisoned environment, both agriculturally and economically, in which our food is grown.

In biodynamic farming the soil is of the utmost importance and when you think about it the soil is where it all starts. After seeing this film you will never look at agricultural fields the same. You will be able to tell if it is well-managed land or poisoned with pesticides, herbicides and fungicides which kills the soil although the film is not a course in agriculture.

The film comes down to a single message: by using the chemicals mentioned above farmers, and food production as a whole, flow into a viscous circle where the only option to improve crop yield is to use more chemicals. Together with contracts offered by a number of multinational (GMO) seed companies to farmers in India and elsewhere, farmers are offered seeds that produce sterile crops with very low yields,trapping them in high debts and low production of chemical crops.

Biodynamic agriculture is a method to save our food production by a fully organic (no chemicals used) farming method that brings back the quality of the soil as it used to be and generate same or higher yields as conventional (read: chemical) agriculture. It may be our only way out of a terrible mistake.

It may help you to get a deeper understanding of how important this film and biodynamic farming is by watching `The future of food' (available from Amazon) and `The slow poisoning of India' (Google). Both documentaries show what happens if things do not change.",1199059200,16,1586,4.862962962962963
