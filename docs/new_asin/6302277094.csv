7823486,4,6302277094,"After you've experienced Beethoven's powerful 'Diabelli Variations', that colossus of a work, taking a naive, simple-minded little Waltz and storming the heavens with it, as well as descending into a Dante-esque pit of Hell, any other sets seem fruitless, bland, secondhand. That's what I found here in the 'C minor Variations'. There are some variations passages that simply do nothing, and are boring, I mean nothing not as negatively as you think, for the variations concept is suppose to imply that at times you will have relatively dead variants, or smoother stabile ones,less anxiety ridden. Perahia's Rachmaninov was very moving, straightforward, cleaning up any overextended bouts with passion. This is commonplace now,for Sergie was a consummate tone-painter as in the 'C major Etude Tableaux',the crystal clear open timbre of the fifths and fourths intervals. The Eb minor Etude Tableaux at the other extreme, now with roaring scales was also a good choice,deeply impassioned. Perahia playing has exquisite balance and he knows how to nurture the extremes of density as in Rachmaninov.
I've never warmed to any piano music of Robert Schumann. I find it tediously bland, uncolourful,predictable, and hardly does it suggest anything other than what it is. Michelangeli does something different in treating Schumann's as a mad man's creations. Perahia was very polite here. His Liszt as well was good. I wish there was more like the 12th Hungarian Rhapsody was finely balnaced again.",996451200,2,1490,5.3446808510638295
