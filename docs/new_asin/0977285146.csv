7794814,5,0977285146,"In the early 1970s David Talbott, after reading a tantalising hint by Immanuel Velikovsky in a still-unpublished work that Saturn was apparently worshipped by the ancients as a sun (In the Beginning, section ""Star of the Sun""), found himself suddenly immersed in the field of comparative mythology and whilst initally lost and confused, he soon came to realise there were certain archetypes which were common in every set of ancient myths. Exploring these archetypes became a life's work. In 1980 his book The Saturn Myth was published in which he demonstrated that without exception ALL ancient peoples originally worshipped Saturn as the Sun and gave it names such as ""superior sun"" and ""first father"", and that names which today refer to the Sun such as Sol and Helios originally were given to Saturn.

Exploring why this was so eventually led Talbott to the realisation that, as Velikovsky had previously suggested might be not inconceivable, the Earth was in the not-too-distant past a satellite of the planet Saturn and further, that it was no ordinary satellite. Eventually decoding the meaning of the ""cosmic mountain"" and the ""stairway to heaven"" and related archetypes, as well as those which pointed towards the Superior Sun somehow residing in the northern sky, Talbott arrived at an impasse which, in 1991, forced him to quit and sell his library. Whilst with one voice the ancient myths and legends spoke of Saturn as residing stationary in the sky at the North Pole, it seemed they also spoke about a strange planetary line-up which seemed physically impossible to him at the time. Essentially, the planets in the order Earth, Mars, Venus, Saturn (and possibly Jupiter, although this would have been hidden from view behind Saturn) were lined up so that a line would pass through the centre of all, and with all looming close and massive in the sky.

It was this line-up, and the activities and movements of the planets within it, Talbott found, which gave rise to the whole myth-making epoch in human history, the semi-legendary time of the ""golden age"" when the gods lived and played before they became capricious and violent, and then eventually departed to remote places. Remnants of these times, whilst their original meanings are now all but lost, still exist; even our Christmas is related originally to the festival of Saturnalia, with Santa Claus at the North Pole still a very obvious connection when one is familiar with the theory.

It was not until Talbott met plasma physicist Wallace Thornhill in the early '90s that he was able to resolve his doubts and continue with renewed enthusiasm. Yes, it WAS possible, insisted Thornhill; the cosmos is electrically charged and this line-up could occur (probably only for a limited time) given the correct electro-magnetic conditions. In 1996 a documentary video, Remembering The End Of The World, was released about Talbott and his work to that point. Whilst at times slow it is nevertheless a fascinating study into what it takes to research such a seemingly bizarre subject, and of course outlines Talbott's work up to that point. And the computer-generated footage of the planetary line-up, the so-called Polar Configuration, alone makes the DVD (available from thunderbolts dot info) worth the price.

Still not satisfied with his model, Talbott continued his work and the culmination of this is presented in Symbols of an Alien Sky, a multi-part presentation with so far 2 episodes released. The first part takes us through the archetypes and lays out the framework, introducing the Polar Configuration and explaining its appearance and depiction in ancient mythology and art. It then introduces us to the fact that the universe is highly electrically active and that electrical discharges between planets are responsible for the ""channels"" on Mars. This is shown in stunning and irrefutable detail in Part 2, which is appropriately subtitled The Lightning-Scarred Planet, Mars. Here were are treated to a comparison of the Martian surface as well as Earth features such as the Grand Canyon with electrical discharge machining and, I think all viewers will agree that there can be no question this surface, and likely that of the Moon as well, was shaped not by ancient rivercourses but, essentially, by lightning strikes.

I believe originally Talbott planned the series to consist of 3 episodes; I heard him recently suggest it may be necessary to extend it to a fourth. Whatever the case may be, the 3rd episode - apparently mainly on the subject of Saturn itself - is not yet completed. I for one am looking forward to its release with eager anticipation. Yet even 4 episodes are merely skimming the surface of a subject which is so vast it essentially involves a re-reading and re-interpretation of ALL ancient myths with a new understanding: ancient mythology is largely historical, not allegorical. Since ancient times, after the skies had changed and the planets settled onto their present orbits, mankind has developed the unfortunate habit of denying any catastrophic past, and insisting that only that which he can see today has ever existed. Velikovsky called this ""collective amnesia"" (see Mankind in Amnesia). Whatever its name, without a doubt the syndrome does exist, and it has led to mankind denying his history to the point where, it seems, he is determined to repeat it - as catastrophically as he possibly can, in obeisance to his ancient father, Saturn.

Symbols Of An Alien Sky is a visually stunning and timely reminder that ALL our history should be taken into account, and that the uniformitarian point of view in which nothing has changed for millions of years, through ice ages and long, slow mountain-building epochs, is challenged not only by logic and evidence (see Velikovsky's Earth in Upheaval) but by human testimony. Perhaps only 10,000 years ago, possibly even less, it seems that the skys above us were very, very, very different to what they are now, and the changes in the sky were responsible for most, if not all, of the cultural content in ancient history. The search for truth and knowledge is always exciting; I find it nearly breathtakingly so that with the work done by the likes of Talbott and Thornhill and the slow but steady breakthrough of ""electric universe theory"" into the mainstream, the human race may be on the verge of a new understanding of our past, and of our future. Cannot rate it highly enough.
