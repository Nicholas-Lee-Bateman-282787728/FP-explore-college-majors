8560991,3,B00B1PVF02,"Helter Skelter is a movie whose meaning is encoded in symbolism. It was hardly surprising that several people walked out of the screening - even men who paid to see the beautiful Japanese actress in the nude. I can imagine that they found the 127 minute feature boring and devoid of meaning.

The main character Rinko is a star who's had complete top-to-bottom plastic surgery. She becomes super hot, appears on magazine covers everywhere. Soon she begins to fall apart. She screams at her mother/handler that she wants out. And subjects her female assistant to a serious of humiliations. Like making her perform cunninglingus on her. On another occasion, Rinko has sex with her assistant's boyfriend while her assistant is forced to watch and then orders her assistant to get it on with her boyfriend while she watches. Um, this is all done fully clothed. There are also some shots of Rinko naked while getting it on with a fully dressed male.

Life soon descends into a blur between fantasy and reality. Rinko starts to see things - like facial decay. Her bathtub is filled with drugs. Blue butterflies flutter around her while she makes a public appearance, causing a public breakdown. Recall some real life celebrities with the same problem?

At a press conference, Rinko makes the ultimate sacrifice. Clue: it has something to do with the one eye symbolism.

In terms of aesthetics, Helter Skelter is very glamorous and stylized. On the surface, it presents the story of how stars must make sacrifices for fame. And it is a very dear price to pay. Nonetheless, there's always some pretty girl ready for her shot at stardom. The movie ends with the rookie discovering what happened to Rinko - all beautifully symbolized. To understand it fully, you have to know what butterflies and the one eye represent.

Recommended for hardcore arthouse lovers and the adventurous.",1365292800,6,1872,4.9113924050632916
