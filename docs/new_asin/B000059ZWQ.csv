1409948,5,B000059ZWQ,"The picture quality looks really good.  However it's not in it's original 16x9 (1:85) screen ratio, so as it's presented here in 4x3, there is a lot of headroom/negative space in the framing. This will give you a sense of distance (that does not feel right) which was not intended by the film makers.  If your TV is capable of it enlarging the picture without just stretching it, do it and you'll get see this film how as was originally intended. It's make the movie a little more intimate.  That said, this is a fun little movie - don't take it seriously and it's really enjoyable.  Jane Russell gives a bright, charming performance and Keenan Wynn is solid.  Also there is a great score by the talented Billy May. I give it four stars, for Jane and the score.  I just wish it was available in HD and in it's original 16x9 format.",1387584000,,831,4.398692810457517
1409949,4,B000059ZWQ,"Loved seeing the long ago location shots of LA and the PCH--check out the mighty international airport, with its two terminals which must have seemed like a grand palace of aviation back then.  I don't know about the house that Ralph Meeker and Keenan Wynn have holed up in.  If that's a real house, it should be in all the guidebooks.  Jane Russell doesn't get to sing much in this movie but she does wear three great outfits, including the fuzzy pink nightgown they give her to cover up her sex appeal.  She carries on a delightful and extended exchange with Meeker about ""bubble gum,"" a word coded with shades of meaning involving sexuality and the pursuit of pleasure to which she has devoted all her life, but he far too little.  He complains that when he was a poor boy, there was one store in his neighborhood that would close on Sundays and holidays, and when it was closed, the kids wouldd read the sign in the window that said, ""Free Bubble Gum,"" but when the store was open, the bubble gum was not free and it was stale to boot.

Jane Russell sums him up nicely saying that even though he's grown, he's still living his life like the embittered and cheated little boy he once was.

Later she tells him that the reason that he didn't try to make love to her while she was in his power is that maybe he doesn't like the flavor of bubble gum she offers to him!

I guess Hollywood must have been infected with bubble gum metaphors because right after we saw this show, we watched AUTUMN LEAVES and Joan Crawford keeps begging Cliff Robertson to date girls his own age but he sighs and tells her, he tried, but they were ""jitterbugs"" and ""bubble gum addicts,"" chewing and popping the gum in his ear while they were in his arms on the dancefloor.  Joan can't help cracking up at Cliff's woebegone expression as he describes these ""bubble gum addicts.""

In THE FUZZY PINK NIGHTGOWN (in beautiful black and white, with a percussive Billy May soundtrack that's out of this world), Ralph Meeker got one of his very few leading man parts.  He's a revelation, hard as nails when he has to be, but soft and kittenish, wearing on fetching cashmere sweater after another.  It's all about the masculinity in THE FUZZY PINK NIGHTGOWN, and Meeker proves that just like his name, he's enough man to be a woman when it feels right.",1200009600,2,2322,4.463356973995272
1409950,5,B000059ZWQ,"I recently saw this film for the first time, and thoroughly enjoyed it!  I'm a big Ralph Meeker fan, so that's what motivated me to watch it, since I can't find many films in which he played leads.  I liked how Jane Russell's movie star character interacted with his angry man character!  It's not the best movie ever made, but it is very entertaining...I can't believe it 'flopped' when it came out!  Maybe it was ahead of its time, or maybe the idea of kidnapping isn't funny to moviegoers!  Anyhoo, it's great fun, has a great score by Billy May (who worked with Frank Sinatra).  One of my favorite scenes in the movie is towards the beginning, when ""Laurel Stevens"" (Jane Russell) is trying to charm/seduce the Ralph Meeker/""Mike"" character:  While they are talking to each other, he avoids looking at her the whole time, and he turns his body away from her every time she gets closer - through the entire scene! All the while, she is using every feminine wile she can on him to get her way!  Very funny!",1183939200,2,1008,4.5
1409951,4,B000059ZWQ,"Call me nuts. Maybe it's the 1957 beach bungalow replete with retro furnishings, but I thought this movie was loads of fun. Jane Russell plays a Hollywood Star who is abducted on the night her latest sizzler ""The Kidnapped Bride"" hits the screens. Keenan Wynn and Ralph Meeker play her likable kidnappers.
  At first Russell tries to escape, but soon she realizes that if she *does* get away the public will think she's staged a cheap publicity stunt, and her career will be ruined--so she extracts a promise from Meeker and Wynn to make the kidnapping certifiably authentic.
  Of course the obvious happens; Russell and Meeker start to fall for each other--he, trying harder and harder to prove that it is a real kidnapping to protect her career--she trying to find some way to make the whole thing look fake and keep him out of jail.
  There were a couple of reasons I thought his film was a cut above the normal faire. For one thing, Russell's character is initially presented as a hard-headed business woman who just needs a tough enough guy to deliver true love--but Meeker plays against this stereotype. He's no softie--he slaps her in the beginning when she starts to treat the whole thing as a joke--but he's just...well...nice. Russell also plays against the stereotype, remaining cheerful and level headed throughout the film, and not letting love turn her into something mushy and ""feminine.""
Inevitably, the film's a bit dated. There are requisite scenes with policemen and agents and movie moguls, but for the most part they're kept mercifully short. By and large we get a picture of two rather ordinary and charming people who discover that by putting aside their normal lives they have a chance to find happiness together.",1058313600,11,1737,4.871186440677966
1409952,5,B000059ZWQ,"This is one of those films that somehow grabs one.  The first time I saw this movie was in 1964 late at night before all the
networks were filled with talkshows.  There's something about
watching a movie late at night that endures a movie to one--The
Fuzzy Pink Nightgown is just such a movie.  It's not an academy award winner, nor a tear-jerker, but it's just good clean predictable light-hearted romantic comedy.  Can you just imagine being kidnapped by two ""dangerous felons"" and then shortly just before the police arrive to rescue you, you find yourself in love with your kidnapper.  ""Honest Sarge, no one but no one's gonna believe this.""  This is a motion picture for those who need a break from all the high powered violence on t.v. these days. There's only one problem with this movie, once you get used to the tracking problems with the video tape, you can actually watch the movie.  It's so inexpensive that it's not
worth the effort to send it back, just purchase another one like I did and hope it plays back properly.  But what does one expect for [the price]!",1021161600,6,1075,4.591623036649215
7934487,5,B000059ZWQ,"Great movie. Ms Russell not only in her element as a comedic actress, but there are lines that ring autobiographical, observations of what it's like to have to present yourself sexy rather than real. I suspect she was limited in her own career in the same way, so when she delivers those lines it really rings true. All within the lighthearted feel of madcap comedy. Fun film, a good watch to be sure.",1485129600,,401,4.506849315068493

7934489,3,B000059ZWQ,"The script was kind of meek, but the big disappointment was Jane Russell. By the time this movie was made in 1958, her looks at age 36 were prematurely compromised. Worse yet, the quality of her acting performance was worse than any other actors in the film. With a younger, more talented ingnue, this movie might have made it. As is it failed in the box office then and in my own estimation now. 2 1/2 stars.",1475539200,,409,4.324675324675325
