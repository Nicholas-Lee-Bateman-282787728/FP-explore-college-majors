3481974,5,B001B3XZAW,"This is a great movie that everybody in the industrialized world should watch, especially America. It's probably not going to keep you hanging on the edge of your seat since it's mostly interviews with various people. However, the information contained within is priceless. If you read lots of health books it'll probably help reinforce what you already know and if you don't it will probably inspire you to start. If you're new to the kind of info presented in this documentary you might want to check out these books:

1. Ultraprevention by Mark Hyman and Mark Liponis
2. Empty Harvest by Bernard Jensen and Mark Anderson
3. 50 Secrets of the World's Longest Living People by Sally Beare

There are countless other great books but this is a start. I hope this movie and others like it inspire more people to start taking responsibility for their health.",1232668800,152,855,4.809523809523809

It may be year 2017 now.. but this film still rings true..

You Are What You Eat

You eat toxic food = You are a toxic person

(Light bulb pops up over my head)

..That makes sense.. but who knew Vitamin B3/Niacin would cure depression
Next time someone I know has suicidal feelings or feels depressed, I know what to bring over

I do know a relative that has been taking prescribed drugs since she was 18 and now she's 70.. she just went to the emergency room to get prescribed medicine for the belief that will be her sole cure for a bug infestation.. For her the reliance on drugs to solve all her problems is absolutely true.

3481999,5,B001B3XZAW,"I've watched this movie a handful of times and have recommended it to others.  I'm overweight and a notorious bad eater.  At times when I find myself falling away from my diet I watch it again for inspiration.  I'm actually quite surprised at the bad reviews as some seem like they haven't even watched the film.  One single star reviewer commented, ""eat vegetables and your MS will go away"".  Not once, ever, does this film mention MS.  It covers diseases that are caused my bad nutrition.  Another reviewer said if you follow the advice of this film it could kill you.  That statement is strange to say the least since the film is heavily centered on eating a diet heavy in organic fruits, vegetables, & vitamins.
As far as the vitamins go, I can tell you that, in my experience they work.  I did not take care of my teeth as a young person.  As a result I had a mouthful of amalgam fillings.  Fast forward 20 years and they all started to crumble.  I was swallowing them sometimes before I realized that they fell out.  I had the last of them removed last summer.  Afterwards, my dentist recommended a Myers Cocktail as a method of detox.  A Myers Cocktail is  high dose vitamin C with several other vitamins in IV form.  I did it mostly out of curiosity.  I felt incredible for at least a week after each treatment.  I was even in a better mood.  I found out in the movie that Vitamin C can help elevate the mood.  Something I has already figured out by chance!  A Myers is around $120.00, so I get them very sparingly.  I've also started taking daily vitamins as well as a daily Vitamin C.  Knock on wood.  I have not been sick in over a year.",1497052800,4,1648,4.324590163934427

3482036,3,B001B3XZAW,"If you are sick what do you do? Most would say, I go to the doctor? I think that is the answer most people would give. You go to the doctor, he or she prescribes you with medication to take. But what if there was a way to prevent illness without taking medication or vitamins. What about eating the right food?
 Food Matters was released in 2008 and distributed by Aspect Film. James Colquhoun directed, produced ad wrote the documentary. Colquhoun did have help. Carlo Ledesma co-directed, Laurentine Ten Bosch and Enzo Tedeschi co-produced and Laurentine Ten Bosch also co-wrote the documentary. The production company for Food Matters is Permacology Productions. Food Matters is 80 minutes long. This documentary discusses the importance of food and the benefits it has for humans.
 Food Matters looks at how food can hurt and help our health. What most people don't realize is that the vitamin supplements that they take can be gotten from food. If we eat the right food then there is no need for vitamin supplements. They did not just look at vitamins, they looked at heart disease and cancer. If you eat correctly you can reduce your threat of heart disease. Now, no one knows what causes cancer, but doesnt make sense that eating health would help that do. The documentary stated that if a woman moved to American her likelihood of getting breast cancer increases to 30%. Why is that? It is the way we eat. Also the documentary discusses, how doctors do not consider diet as an option for our health. They just what to give out medication to their patients. The bottom line of the documentary was food really does matter, we need to watch what we eat.
 In the documentary it talked about losing weight. It stated that just exercising and eating better is not the best way. It said to eat vegetables and fruit, this increases the amount if fiber causing you to have a bowel movement. The one gentleman said his cause did this. His cousin lost 150 pounds. This diet caused him to have 12 bowel movements in one day, resulting in 15 pounds lost. That was just one day! This was a different kind of weight loss and it was an interesting point of view.
 I found this an interesting documentary. I would recommend this to people interested in learning about the benefits to eating health. I liked learning about the other way to loss weight. Also, I liked the facts about cancer. I made a very good point, it showed how bad Americans are with their diets. Finally, I liked learning about the history of the medicine and how diet is not considered by doctors.",1483315200,,2559,4.629955947136564

If you're using David ""Avocado"" Wolfe, a known anti-vaxxer, as one of your ""experts"", this just tells me your documentary is going to be based on very little science. For example, around 7 minutes in they start talking about digestive leukocytosis, and the research done by Kouchakoff in the 1930's.

Yes antioxidants have been shown to neutralize free radical in vitro but not in a complex chemical system such as the human body. Also, the video is very contradicting and appears extremely biased.

3482248,1,B001B3XZAW,"I'm a vegan and practice an evidence-based diet--I look up everything that I eat in peer-reviewed health journals like Medline and Pubmed. This is one of those raw quack diets that is lacking any modern peer-reviewed citations. If a documentary isn't based on evidence or clinical studies, you shouldn't trust a single word in it. I would highly recommend viewers check out Forks Over Knives or Cowspiracy instead, since both make full use of the long-term and large-scale clinical diet studies like The China Study, The Adventist Health Studies, PREDIMED, The Epic Study, Nurses Health Study, etc.

Food Matters makes its pseudo-science stance clear from the start by repeating the fallacy that cooking all whole foods makes them less healthy, and goes even further to repeat the ""enzyme myth"" that the original raw diet movement clung to until it was unequivocally shown to be false by a range of clinical studies. You can't simply state that foods are healthier raw, because it depends entirely on what whole food you are talking about. Steaming and boiling actually makes a range of vegetables healthier, while baking and microwaving can increase the bio-availability of some vegetables. You can search Google Scholar for real in vivo clinical studies on the matter.

I was in South America in the late 90's,  and observed some very healthy people living and working at 10,000 feet and others at a few hundred feet of elevation.

Meat was eaten a couple of times a week,  though in moderation compared to much of what I see around the USA.  Done properly one can be very healthy by primarily the food they eat, quality food; plus reasonable exercise and rest.

3482276,3,B001B3XZAW,"I agree with the overall message that our dietary choices have a major influence on our health and that political-biopharma and general big pharma are out for themselves. This being said, this documentary is heavy-handed with the assertion that this ideology is also a cure-all, while the truth is somewhere in-between. Human beings are not perfect and while what may work for some, again espoused in the documentary, does not work for all. Vitamins in megadoses can, indeed, have real and documented consequences on human health. Google retinol poisoning. Google beta-carotene in smokers. Google the side-effects of Spirulina.

Now regarding the concept of raw vegetable intake: I think we have come into an era where we are sheilded from beneficial probiotics, this includes natural enzymes found in raw organic vegetables that contribute to our survival as well as beneficial bacteria. I make absolutuly no arguments for the use of anything named that ends in ""-cide"". And I also agree that leached and overused (or under-nourshished) soil yeilds deficient crops. But will this cure everything? Is it a cure-all? No, but I agree that we are missing a large portion of benefits from the vary environment that created the human animal. There are scientific studies (not by big pharma or bio-pharma [Google Scholar is your friend]) that are exploring gut flora and their benefits as well as the benefits of macronitrients.

We are coming into an age of awareness and like the documentary says, we must question our current state of being. But I cannot advocate black and white thinking, which this documentary is guilty of. This is not a cure-all, but it is thought evoking and we should examine the way we approach our health. Walking middle ground is always difficult and treacherous, but if you prefer a challenge, it can be rewarding. Question everything, including this documentary.",1466812800,9,1887,5.123376623376624

I know that profit drives sales of everything we consume. That becomes dangerous when we are talking about food. We don't have to buy a poorly constructed product from China. But we all have to eat. And it is becoming less likely that we can purchase safe food. The fact presented that doctors spend only about 25 hours of their education learning about nutrition plays into all that. And Big Pharma and Big Ag want to keep it that way. They don't want medical professionals thinking about the body healing itself when it's infirmed. They want doctors to write a prescription or start cutting. Films like this at least shine a light on that problem. The film does say that the power is within us to change things. We need to eat organic foods. We need to take nutritional supplements to allow the body to heal itself.",1465084800,2,951,4.633136094674557

3482430,1,B001B3XZAW,"This film is biased towards one particular viewpoint.  No real surprise there.  Unfortunately, there is little scientific evidence to support any of the ""expert"" claims made during the film, and those things that were partly true were taken out of context and communicated in wildly inaccurate ways.  For instance, I ran across the part of the film that mentioned ""digestive leukocytosis"".  I was unfamiliar with this specific term, but found the description in the film sounded implausible.  After digging up a few studies and wading through the findings, it became obvious that their claims did not reflect actual evidence.  Kouchakoff's experiment found immune response triggered only in foods that had been cooked at temperatures of 189 degrees F or higher (depending on the food) and even then, many cooked foods triggered no immune response at all.  Kouchakoff suggested that digestive leukocytosis could be avoided by eating 10% raw foods at a meal, or by cooking foods below the critical temperature, nowhere near the staggering 50% suggested in the film.  Despite 8 decades of research, nobody has ever been able to reproduce any of Kouchakoff's findings.

I'm also very concerned by any entity that makes claims that any dietary or supplementary action can prevent countless physical ailments without having hard scientific evidence to support such a claim.  There is no diet that can make you either immortal or impervious to all disease.  There are some physical ailments that are, at least in part, triggered by lifestyle choices.  There are others that remain shrouded in mystery despite long and diligent study.  Just visit a children's hospital and take a look at all of the little people who have been struck down by cancer, heart defects, lung problems, brain problems.  Some children are born with these ailments, despite their mothers eating a perfect vegetarian, whole foods, raw foods, organic diet during the entire pregnancy.  Some don't even make it until they are born.  Without immediate, often dramatic medical intervention, these conditions lead to death or lifelong impairment.  Serious, life threatening conditions can develop at any point in an individual's life.  They are not all related to diet, and many are determined within the individual's DNA, but are asymptomatic until later.  Others are triggered by environmental stimuli or viruses.

The bottom line is that the human body very complex, with many different parts and systems that all have to work together in harmony in order to maintain good health.  If there is a breakdown in any one of these systems, the results could be catastrophic.  However, as each body part is different, each health problem must be approached differently.  It is not logical to apply only one solution to such a vast variety of problems.  This is not only lazy, in any professional capacity is is irresponsible, as it could place the person following your advice in harm's way.

What I appreciated most about this docu was the info concerning vitamin therapy, detoxification and organic produce. We live in the information age and different interests are competing to control the very nature of truth, fact and reality. The people in this film suggest a focus on whole plant foods and vitamins. If you test it out for yourself, they have little or nothing to gain by it; plus there's no danger in it as long as you test it gradually (esp vitamins). Ultimately one cannot be free to make informed decisions when one cannot know objective truth.

I agree that modern medicine over-prescribes unnecessary drugs, but suggesting that Vitamin C can ""cure"" cancer is entirely idiotic.  Supplementing vitamin C will not correct genomic abnormalities that have triggered cells to become cancerous in the first place.  As someone who works in cancer genomics and interacts regularly with some of the best oncologists in the country, we would all share a laugh if someone suggested Vitamin C as a primary treatment for cancer.  Cancer is inevitable for all people, in the sense that if you lived to 150 years old, you would get cancer at some point.  No matter how strong your immune system is, all it takes is a single dysfunctional cell to perturb the system.  Go suck on your green juice; it may make you feel more ""health conscious"", but let's see it increase your survival rate significantly (my guess is +/- 1 week).  Studies have shown no significant difference in survival when switching to a vegan, vegetarian, ""healthier"" diet once cancer has been diagnosed.  The body is surprisingly dynamic to all types of foods, and once cellular pathways are dysfunctional, a little vitamin C won't magically dissolve your tumor.  Your green juice or Vitamin C won't cure cancer anytime, and this whole documentary discredits the dedicated work of many leading doctors and researchers in cancer.",1455667200,8,1440,5.168103448275862

However, let's hear from some more reputable people that a raw food proponent, a dentist, etc.  Mentioning Linus Pauling who has some very controversial ideas is silly.  Clearly the filmmakers had NO vision on this and just grabbed a bunch of people to talk about things their audience already knows - organic veggies are good for you!

Why not make something that changes behavior rather than continue to beat the drum of organic food to people who already buy in.",1452556800,2,783,4.671532846715328

While I don't believe that everything these people are saying is true I do believe that proper food and nutrition, REAL food and not food like products, are essential to health. The body can do wonderful things to maintain it's own health but only if we feed it a variety of good, quality, fresh food. People need to take responsibility for what they put into their bodies and how they treat their bodies.

Which nutritional gurus - although quoted - did not participate in this video? Gosh. Why did Dr. Dean Ornish,  Harvard-trained physician, who actually published a landmark study with very real and tangible benefits to cardiovascular health, not participate?

3482843,2,B001B3XZAW,"The basic premise that food is medicine and that proper nutrition is a key to health are the strongest parts of this documentary. The evidence for mega-doses of vitamin supplements is less convincing. Though most of the proponents in the film site specific cases, there is a lack of clinical evidence to support their claims. They may be on to something important but one would like to have more go on. The filmmakers may have attempted to interview experts who question the value and potential dangers of vitamin supplements in large doses but they are not in this documentary. It might have been effective to have Dr. Saul and others refute criticism of their methods. A cursory search on the Internet turned up no serious studies of the issue and little or no criticism of the proponents. ""Food Matters"" at least made me search further for information about nutrition and medicine. There is no question that healthy eating is important and if this film begins the conversation then it has done a service.

I certainly have considered many new ideas and I'm actually excited about adjusting my regimen as well as my family's. We eat MOSTLY healthy, and the reminder on the refrigerator reads: ""You can only ever get from your body what you put into it... love it.""

I have already used diet and supplements alone to heal my 90-year-old grandmother. Unfortunately, hospice care does not provide nutritional support. I wondered about this at first, but now I understand why: nutrition is not supported by the medical field to have healing properties; and good nutrition is expensive. Still, I knew there was a certain amount of ""good stuff"" that she needed in her intake every day, and created a regimen based on minimum essentials. Even though it's not exactly what I was thinking of at the time, the science works. Shame on me for never having thought to include EXTRA vitamins. She's still doing well and they will be included now. :-)

3483449,1,B001B3XZAW,"I am very concerned that this documentary has received such glowing reviews on Amazon, as it seems to reflect this growing trend we all see on Facebook and other social media sites: the ""cult of alternative"".  This documentary, if you can even call it that, takes what should be it's core-message of healthy eating and lifestyle and twists it into a disgusting presentation of quacks, de-bunked theories, and anti-establishment ideas that have little scientific backing.  A few of the low-lights:

1 - One of the professors mentions that the ""Gerson Institute"" method for treating cancer should be taught at every American medical school.  A quick Google search will show you that such methods have been outlawed in the US for a variety of reasons.  Parts of the treatment in the 70's involved using raw animal organs that carried rare bacterial disease causing around 10 hospitalizations.  The treatment method outlined by the Gerson Institute has not withstood any independent outside testing, and their ""results"" are not reproduce-able.

2 - There are quite a number of people suggesting that mega-doses of vitamins can be used to cure disease, and that there is simply no harm or limit from such treatments.  Niacin is used as one point as a vitamin ""without side-effects"" in a mega-dose, and a doctor even challenges the viewer to ""find any evidence suggesting otherwise"".  Other than a common flushing reaction that can be seen, blindness, hepatic failure, and other very real and serious side-effects can be seen from using Niacin in mega-doses.

3 - More of a 1b, the movie makes even wilder claims on the pathogenesis and treatment of cancer.  The claims on survival statistics (one 'expert' going so far to say survival for ANY cancer is no better than 30% over 5 years...a horrifically wrong statement) are completely and totally false.  Their claims that vitamins are not considered in treatment are also incredibly false: A modified form of Vitamin A (Tretinoin) has been used for quite some time to treat Acute Promyelocytic Anemia or AML subtype M3.  The most offensive claim this movie makes is that cancer is really just an issue with nutrition, and that all one needs to treat cancer is a special diet and Vitamin C mega-dosing.  Enough people have been stricken by this horrible disease (my Aunt and Brother's best friend included) for that to be COMPLETELY FALSE as an effective treatment...why in the hell would any doctor or researcher hold that truth from the public?!!?

4 - I would recommend not seeing this film, but if you did watch this steaming pile notice how none of the research mentioned was after the 70's or 80's.  Many of the papers or ideas sited were even older, coming from the 1930's and before.  The structure of DNA wasn't even discovered before the early 1950's, and you seriously mean to tell me that these papers and ideas from the 1930's were, and continue to be, the PINNACLE OF SCIENCE AND NUTRITION?  Another interesting note was that they did mention the studies done by Dr. Dean Ornish...a TRUE expert in the field of nutrition, yet he was not there to comment on his ground-breaking study himself.  I wonder why a Harvard-trained physician, who actually published a landmark study with very real and tangible benefits to cardiovascular health, would not participate in this documentary....

Take heed people: these guru's of the ""cult of alternative"" are not here because they know the better way.  Many of these people, especially the Gerson Institute and their ilk, are here to sell you something.  Whether it's their ineffective treatments, or their questionable ideas sold as ""alternatives ignored by the mainstream"", these people are dangerous for you and your family.

Linus Pauling's book on staying healthy is excellent...I was especially surprised about how late in the 20th century that vitamins were discovered. Andrew Saul's Doctor Yourself is amazing and very detailed. It fills in a few missing pieces I've always wondered about in what the body is looking for to heal itself. It is looking for a nutrient that is somehow deficient. I watched it and then a group of friends came to my house to watch it.

3483537,5,B001B3XZAW,"When I sat down to view this DVD, I thought I'd be bored to death as I had been studying the relationship of food to health for years.  I found that I wasn't as smart as I thought I was.  First was the dangers of eating cooked foods.  I never thought there was that much danger.  They brought up the dangers of amalgam fillings in the teeth.  They are about 50% mercury.  You were told they were silver fillings so you wouldn't panic.  Mercury is extremely dangerous, a deadly toxin.  I recently wanted my amalgam fillings removed and had to go from dentist to dentist and concluded that dentists where in the same rut as physicians.  What they were taught in school was the law, it was never challenged and he practitioners were not taught to keep learning and especially using their intelligence.  My physician told me that my blood sugars were up and I had diabetes. I had to take her pills or else I would go blind, my kidneys would stop working and I'd lose my feet.  This is physician's greatest weapon, to cause fear to force the patient to be compliant and take the pills or the treatment.  I told the physician that I didn't have diabetes, I had a blood sugar problem.  Shortly after I found Dr. Davis's book, Wheat belly.  I stopped wheat and my blood sugar dropped to normal.  But, in a succeeding book he stated the problem is all grains, which doing my blood sugar proved.  I would encourage any thinking person to prove the facts for themselves and don't let anyone be condescending and poo-poo your knowledge.  I've worked 30 years with physicians.  Some listen to you, but the majority don't.  Just remember that an education doesn't give you wisdom.  Wisdom is of your own making.  My motto is ""No one need die of cancer.""  This documentary would show you the way.  K. Loraine, RN, BSN, LNC.",1417910400,,1808,4.495384615384616

The body was created to receive and digest these foods naturally, not pills manufactured with man made products that the body cannot digest.  Research has proven that pills have been found in the intestines of people undigested.  Whole real foods eaten in a body that has been detoxified from all the junk (processed, man made products), can correct and facilitate healing naturally.

Even in times medicine is necessary, the option to purchase holistic products made from God's whole real food are available.

Think about it, it cost less to buy whole real organic food, than it does to purchase medical prescriptions, month after month.  Sit down and count the cost for yourself.

It exposes the corruption of our medical system and the real reason why were are all so sick.  And it also shows you how to cure/prevent cancer.  Health becomes very simple after you watch this, whereas the medical industry will have you believing it is complicated.  It isn't.

3483832,5,B001B3XZAW,"BUY IT. I also bought HUNGRY FOR CHANGE, FORKS OVER KNIVES, FOOD INC., SUPER SIZE ME, FAT SICK & NEARLY DEAD, GOT THE FACTS ON MILK, and TAPPED.

First I cut way, way, way back on sugar (not completely ought though.) I lost about 10 lbs in about 3 weeks. Then I bought a ""Hamilton Beach"" Big Mouth Pro Juicing Machine. I lost 20 lbs the first week doing the detox method (juicing fresh, almost all organic veggies and a little fruit.) I was not hungry, though I still had some cravings for sweets, steak, etc. It is important to know that I never let myself get hungry. I drank the 16 oz juice 3 times a day for 21 days snacking on cut up fresh veggies when I felt the need. My weight loss stalled a little, then slowly started moving again. It has been 6 weeks now and I currently have lost 40 lbs., went from a 38"" waist to a 34."" My shoes are now laced as tight as they will go and are now slip-ons. I feel & look healthier. I have a better attitude now and my doctor took me off most of my meds. He said over time, I may get off them all.

Honestly, you do have to have drive, enthusiasm,  and determination. However, you do NOT have to be hungry and want to make sure you are not hungry. Otherwise you trigger a starvation involuntary bodily response to store fat due to the bodily perception of food shortage. This is only one reason why ordinary DIETS DO NOT WORK!

Are you tired of your life as it is? Hungry for dramatic change? GET BUSY! I am NOT sorry I decided to change.

P.S. -  Look at the following Books: ""The Juicing Bible"" and ""The Big Book of Juices."" I found them helpful.",1385164800,46,1593,4.122580645161291

I also find that when we are reminded to eat well that can help us remember to do just that. It is easy to fall into complacency and to eat badly most of the time. This film explains how we should all be eating more raw foods and I think that is great advice. This film also discusses the necessity of the right vitamins and how some can cure disease. After watching this movie you might look into spirulina or other superfoods that are good for you. My mother also watched this film at my home this weekend and thought it was excellent. If you are looking for information on cancer this also explains how to prevent it. Your mother was right: ""Eat your fruits and vegetables.""

3483890,1,B001B3XZAW,"Two premises in this film are worthwhile: 1) We can each take control of our own health; 2) Diet is one of the most important ways one can influence their health.

Other than for those two points, I do not recommend watching this film. There are better films out there with better content, better organization, better quality, research to back their claims, and a less biased presentation of the evidence.

For those interested in seeing this film, and those who have already seen it, please do not let this film's negative portrayal of the medical community strongly influence your views of the medical community in a negative way. Going through the medical education process myself right now, I affirm the documentary's claim that some medical schools give merely a ""nod"" to alternative medicine. However, this is not the case everywhere, and medical schools across the country are definitely opening to the idea of an integrated approach to healing our patients--integrated, meaning utilizing traditional ""western medicine"" practices (which are strongly supported by research), but also utilizing alternative medical practices such as acupuncture, special diets, and the importance of nutrition. My own training included a good dose of nutrition, and I feel capable using this knowledge to approach my patients' diseases with a more holistic strategy. This is contrary to the strong, negative, and divisive claims in this film, which employs persuasive tactics to bias the viewer. Again, there are similar documentaries now available that discuss the good and bad of western medicine in an unbiased way. There are documentaries now available that educate the viewer on healthy diet choices that are supported by research. I recommend watching those instead.",1375574400,16,1760,5.327338129496403
3483891,2,B001B3XZAW,"Stopped watching shortly after the guy told us that ""cooked food is toxic"". We've been cooking food for millennia and it made us healthier, increased nutrition and longevity. Your body can't access a lot of nutrients from uncooked food. That, and almost nothing stated in the parts I watched that were backed by any science or data. Like food that forms a gel detoxes the body. Chia seeds are good for you, but there is almost no evidence that you need to detox your body or anything you eat detoxes your body. It's a bunch of stuff that sounds nice to the uninformed who don't want to learn truth. Just google detox juicing and see all the bad that can come, with little good.

Then you get the guy who tells you if you don't eat perfectly for 1 day, you are in a deficit you can never make up.  Unless you buy the vitamins the Food Matters people are selling. Follow the $$$.

Just look at some of these people's titles: nutrition expert or graduate of some unaccredited new age school that is not regulated in any way. These are not real experts on anything. Look at the data for yourself.

I'm not against people eating better or juicing. We should all eat more unprocessed foods, especially more fruits and veggies. It's the crazy nonsense that takes diet to the extreme that almost makes films like this dangerous.",1375142400,3,1320,4.510460251046025

No side effects from psychotropic drugs. No feeling numb. No being in a half vegetated state or having every biological process slowed to a crawl. No short term memory problems. I now get to tap into my full potential each day.

** I would like to say that although this video got me started to a better life I also put a plan together that included  a counselor, Naturopathic Doctor, and a holistic psychiatrist during this year long transition.

The editing (in regards to tempo) and camera work were much improved from Hungry For Change.  Good stuff. Very little in the way of demonizing good fats (butter, olive oil, coconut oil, palm oil) in the diet and stayed on point with their main topic of how we aren't paying attention to getting more unprocessed and pure plant food into our bodies.

The section on vitamins was surely an eye-opener though. I'm gonna have to do more research into it.

If you've watched this first like I did, Hungry For Change will be a disappointment. Supersize Me and Fat Head (in that order) are nice follow-ups to this in your own research.

3484025,4,B001B3XZAW,"The documentary opens with a quotation by Hippocrates: ""let thy food be thy medicine and let thy medicine be thy food."" This is basically the premise for the documentary. It points out that we are killing ourselves with some of the food we choose to eat. And in the same breath, we can heal ourselves with what we choose to eat.

One of the things that stood out for me was the claim that the majority of doctors have no training whatsoever in nutrition. The message to switch to a raw food diet is definitely not subtle - but then again, it boils down to what you CHOOSE to put into your body.

Where my eyebrows raised a bit was when they covered cancer and something called the Gerson Therapy where the documentary filmmakers suggest that this type of therapy cures cancer. I found their claims didn't have the stats to back them up and I'd be hesitant to look into this alternative method without doing extensive research and talking to medical professionals. This section of the documentary got a bit ""woo woo"" for me, to be honest and the proponents seemed very fundamentalist with their views which put me off.

Another eyebrow riser was the message that Big Pharma is out to get you and that profit supercedes benefits to the ill etc.

Otherwise it was a very informative documentary that will have you immediately reconsidering your food choices. But make sure your thinking cap is on and fully charged before making drastic decisions with your food/medication.",1361318400,,1470,4.686046511627907

3484038,1,B001B3XZAW,"I guess I'm not surprised that so many people fell for the nonsense in this documentary. Some of it is common sense but some is pure fraud.  Simply do a little research on your own.  For example, look up information on the Gerson Institute. The older woman in the video is the daughter of the  man who started it.  His license to practice medicine was pulled and many of their patients have died. They refuse to provide an data on their methods for review but what has been shown is that not only is their methods ineffective but they are downright dangerous.  Viewers with questioning minds should have had the red flags pop up when she claimed that you CANNOT get any disease if you eat right or that if you cure one disease, you cure all diseases.  Pure nonsense!  Also, the man who claimed that high does of vitamin C can cure cancer is a bald-faced liar and fraud.  Don't believe me?  Look it up. He cannot provide a single bit of evidence to prove his assertion. On the other hand, two large scale double blind studies tested the theory and the results showed that vitamin C not only didn't cure cancer but it had no effect on it at all.

Then there's the enemas promoted by another man in the video.  Folks, you should know better if you believe that. Do a little research. Oh, sure! It's all a conspiracy between the drug companies and doctors, right?  That's the same line the twice convicted felon and ex-convict Kevin Trudeau uses to lure gullible suckers. He has been called the greatest scam artist of the 20th century. Sadly, some of the people who praise this book here probably bought into Trudeau's nonsense too and paid big money to do so.

Of course most of us should probably eat more fresh whole vegetables, nuts, etc., and avoid processed foods and chemical additives as much as possible.  That's common sense.  But this documentary takes that bit of truth and promotes a dangerous fraud.

I am very worried at how so many people do not have critical thinking skills these days.  Our schools have failed us.

I would suggest that you use quackwatch.com as a resource when checking out claims like those made in this video.  Unlike the frauds in this video, they will give you all the data and results of controlled studies, etc.

If you believed everything you heard in this video - well, your critical thinking skills are hopeless.  Any thinking person should have seen the signs of fraud.",1361059200,45,2412,4.562790697674418

3484041,3,B001B3XZAW,"Co-directed by James Colquhoun and Laurentine Ten Bosch, this film documents the corruption of the very nature of food pricing, with the federal government's mindless subsidy of big agribusiness, and especially corn production, and how this perverts international markets, such as making corn cheaper to Mexican farmers than that they can grow; the irony being that Mexico is the birthplace and cradle of corn to the world. A bevy of the same talking heads from the other films make some of the same points as they do elsewhere, but this film stitches together a solid narrative and trail of evidence for even the most apathetic viewer to easily follow. There are some claims made, by some of the wackier denizens of this documentary, and the others, such as simply eating this or that being a cure for cancer, or curing clinical depression simply by subscribing a high niacin diet, but none of this has ever been tested in controlled studies.

  That stated, the film is correct in calling out the FDA, the Department of Agriculture, and the EPA for their failures to regulate the production and marketing of the assorted advertising gimmicks used to foist bad foods upon the public, as well as labeling the whole system the `sickness industry,' rather than the wellness or food industry, as well as showing how perverse it is for the drug companies (which often own the agriculture companies) to control the medical journals and university grants that research and detail the harm caused by their own policies.

  Technically, Food Matters is a cut or two above Fed Up! on the cinematic scale, and also penetrates a bit more deeply into the issues that first film raises. The lone negative of the film is one that plagues some of the other films in this review, and that is the use of some rather cheesy animation.",1359676800,,1816,4.823151125401929

3484145,5,B001B3XZAW,"I've watched this movie more than a few times on Netflix, and it rates as one of my favorite documentaries, along with ""Forks Over Knives"" (anything that encourages veganism is great in my book). We are admonished to be our own doctors and nutritionists to educate ourselves, as our conventionally trained medical doctors are often clueless about the importance of nutrition in the prevention and reversal of disease. As intelligent and well-educated as most doctors are, there is a real gap in many doctors' awareness of the pivotal role of nutrition. For example, this one time I was with my mom in the emergency room because she was experiencing tachycardia, and I was talking with the friendly, youngish emergency room doctor about the importance of my mom overhauling her diet. I thought that the younger generations of doctors would be better informed about nutrition. I said that my mom's arthritis would get better is she got rid of the added sugar, as added sugar causes inflammation. Instead of agreeing with me, the doctor said, ""Sugar is okay in moderation."" NO!!! She had just unwittingly undone months of my attempt to get my mother to clean up her diet, as the doctor seemed to have more authority than me, as I am not a medical doctor (nor do I play one on TV, to quote Morgan Spurlock's Don't Eat This Book). My dad's primary care doctor is a wonderful, humble man filled with integrity, yet dangerously overweight himself. This is not an aesthetic reproach, as it is never okay to mock someone over his or her appearance, but a health concern. If he went whole foods vegan with a large proportion of raw foods, I doubt he would be a pound overweight, unless he has very rare metabolic issues that will trump even the best of eating plans. If you eat a lot of animal-based products and refined foods on the Standard American Diet, you are going to be at high risk for a host of lifestyle diseases.

One of my favorite quotes from this movie is so spot-on: ""You can be sincere, and you can be sincerely wrong."" This describes the mindset of ""there's a pill for every ill."" Bill Maher had it right when he said, ""The answer isn't another pill. The answer is spinach."" We do need conventional medicine. I could take all of the probiotics in the world, but it may not be as strong as the antibiotic that I need to get rid of an infection. If you are in an automobile accident, megadoses of vitamins aren't the answer then and there---surgery is. Yet for preventable lifestyle diseases, good nutrition IS the answer, not drugs that are highly toxic to our livers and that have accompanying side effects that are almost bad as the diseases being treated. We wouldn't even need more than half of the procedures and drug therapies we've come to normalize if we'd all overhaul our collective Standard American Diets and replace that noxious fare with organic fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains, with ideally 80% of those foods in its raw, uncooked state. Believe me, this food isn't bland or limited. It's delicious and only limited by your preparation skills and imagination.

I've posted more than a few times on Facebook about the two handfuls of cashews story featured in this documentary. Apparently, two handfuls of cashews are as effective as a standard dose of Prozac in treating depression. High doses of Niacin (coupled with Vitamin C) can treat recalcitrant depression, bipolar mood disorder, and schizophrenia, giving these poor victims a life again. (When someone is experiencing a chemical imbalance, regardless of the origin of the chemical imbalance, it's believed that the neurotransmitters are rerouted, so that the normal pathways are unavailable and unfamiliar synaptic connections are made, which has the net effect of causing increasing confusion and delirium. Depression involves issues with serotonin, the ""feel-good"" neurotransmitter--either a lack of serotonin itself or serotonin receptor sites. Tryptophan is a serotonin precursor and is abundant is cashews. It's not exactly understood how Niacin does its magic, but it's theorized that Niacin helps keep adrenalin and noradrenalin in check, which can cause a host of problems when they're off kilter, plus Niacin helps regulate serotonin.) I would warn people to learn from my mistake and to not take themselves off any psychiatric medication cold turkey, as that can have devastating results. I took myself off of Zyprexa, which I did not tolerate very well, and am still haunted to this day by that miserable, humiliating experience---my behavior was so off and offensive at that point in time, and people who don't understand what it's like firsthand to have a chemical imbalance make the mistake of taking everything at face value, and/or aren't yet ready to put the off behavior into a far more compassionate context. When I was on Zyprexa, I gained 30 pounds (I had always been pencil thin and had even been falsely accused of being anorexic before the Zyprexa weight gain) in about a two-weeks time frame. That isn't normal. That medication was highly toxic to my body, and I never should have been on it in the first place (I just wanted to sleep all of the time when I was on it and was a bit slower at processing information). Yet when pharmacy reps wined and dined my then psychiatrist, she herself may have not been fully aware of the potential side effects or how poorly tolerated this particular medication is. One of my friends was taken off this medication piecemeal under psychiatric supervision and still had a psychotic episode---that's how dangerous Zyprexa is. If he and I had known that high doses of Niacin and cashews (!!!) would work far better and were far safer, of course he and I would have opted for the natural remedies. We just didn't know, nor did our conventionally trained doctors.

I really like David Wolfe, and he's one of the reasons I decided to go mostly raw, as he always has so much energy and seems to be a very positive person. He is featured in this documentary and says many things that make so much sense. He advises us to eat at least more than half raw at every meal, and then we can get the benefits of raw foods, even if we aren't yet at 75%, 80%, or 100% raw. It's actually not too difficult to do 75%. Eat one cooked meal a day, say dinner, and the rest of what you eat throughout the day can be raw. Even at dinner, have a raw salad or fresh fruit before your meal, so you can still get the benefits of raw foods even at your cooked meal.

This documentary can be a life-changer and a life-saver. I highly recommend it. ""The easiest solution is the right one."" That is, nutrition can be transformative and is much easier than costly procedures and putting your health and well-being in the hands of Big Pharma.",1337385600,44,6768,4.762350936967632

3484202,2,B001B3XZAW,"This documentary makes some good points, but don't count on it to be scientifically accurate.

One example: Ruth Gerson says that cancer death rates in the US doubled between 1971 and 1996, and used that as proof that our current methods of curing cancer don't work. However, she doesn't account for population growth during that time, or for the fact that cancer rates have increased, thus skewing the numbers. I feel that is misleading and makes me distrust her information.

What the movie does right is strongly advocate a diet high in raw fruits and vegetables. Certainly that is sound advice. But that is only a small portion of the movie.

The movie mainly focuses on the filmmakers' strong distrust of conventional medicine without proof or solid facts. Yes, doctors have made mistakes and you should always be your own strongest health advocate. However, millions of lives have been saved by conventional medicine (including my own) and it's dangerous to teach people to distrust their doctor. It's hard to find a good doctor, but possible, and when you do it will restore your faith in Western medicine.

In the film they claim that doctors have no knowledge of nutrition and don't suggest diet changes to improve health. In my experience and the experience of close family members and friends, that couldn't be further from the truth. My husband recently found out his triglycerides are 317, far above the norm. His doctor immediately told him to stop eating meat, sugar, and refined grains and to increase his fruits and vegetables. Same with my father-in-law, who has coronary artery disease.

Basically, I prefer not to throw out the proverbial baby with the bathwater. Yes, doctors make mistakes, but it would be foolish to not listen to your doctor, especially when you have a chronic health issue.

The film also claims that ""raw foods are more nutritious"" and ""cooked foods are toxic...the body treats it as foreign.""  In truth, cooking some foods makes vitamins/nutrients more readily available to humans, like vitamin A in cooked carrots.  And the body treats ALL food as foreign -- that's what digestion is all about!

Andrew Saul claims that ""For every drug there is a nutrient that will do the same job.""  Yes, even HIV/AIDS can be cured with brazil nuts alone according to ""orthomolecular medicine.""

Note that no ordinary juicer will suffice.  The juicer these guys recommend costs US$2,400.

Note how often the ""experts"" in the film refer to old research from the 1930s, etc.  Their claims are NOT backed up by anything approaching good science.  Nor are the credentials of these ""experts"" impressive.  Andrew W. Saul, for example, claims to have a ""Ph. D."" -- from Greenwich University, which has been called by journalists a ""diploma mill.""  (See ""Greenwich University"" on Wikipedia)

I wish Penn & Teller had time to devote to this film. The claims in this film are not supported by science, but rather quackery. You can always tell because if you look up any of the blanket terms or statements they use, you will see discussions only on ""vegan"" or ""raw food"" sites, or vitamin store sites, etc.

The stupidity lies in assuming that doctors in some way wish to cover up cures. This is absurd. The whole ""documentary"" is a sales pitch for alternative health, food, vitamins, etc... and guess what? This unscientific approach, while it may be touchy feely and make people feel fuzzy and close to nature, is purely BS.

You can tell from minutes into the film that it is a total slant piece, compared to something like Food Inc. ""Pills for ills..."" give me a break. Every time I have been to a doctor, they always, ALWAYS, try to give me NO prescription or just tell me to take OTC drugs. Even at small clinics with inexperienced doctors, they have always started with the simplest solution, like IB Profen or, in the case of all the people that want antibiotics when they have a virus, they simply refuse to give them to you.

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and this film does not deliver it. My wife's mother has a PhD in nutrition and has been teaching nutrition in colleges for decades.

To be healthy, stay hydrated, eat more fruits and vegetables, eat smaller portions, don't eat excessively fatty, sugary, or salty foods, and get some exercise. Oh, and take a multi-vitamin.

Luckily for the makers, they are not real doctors and cannot be held accountable for their junk claims.  Just to remind everyone how science works, ""expert"" opinion is at the very bottom of the evidence pyramid.  That's as far as this film took the ""evidence"" (and I wouldn't call these people experts).  Above that is legitimate research such as case studies and case series, case-control trials, cohort trials, randomized control trials, and meta-analyses at the top.

For an example, advocating 11g/day of niacin is ridiculous.  These actual case reports show what happens to real people at much lower doses:  [...](edit: amazon removed my link, but the references section for the wikipedia page for niacin provides links to some other primary sources)  Luckily, real doctors were able to save these people from what they read on the internet.

Also, there are plenty of problems with our health, our lifestyles, and our health care system, but accusing family doctors of intentionally keeping patients ill in order to make money, and giving docs no chance to respond to the charges, is sickeningly unfair.  If a family doctor can't even convince a patient to stop smoking, how much luck do you think he is going to have making that patient dramatically change his eating habits and lifestyle?

How does one seriously apply that title to oneself?  You, too, can buy his DVDs or the colostrum and elk antler velvet he sells on his web site.  All of their impassioned eyebrow raising and smirking about how ridiculous we all are for cooking our food and going to medical doctors is not only disingenuous self-promotion, it's completely unsupported by any real research. Andrew Saul is just a kook.  Mega-vitamins simply have not been shown to be effective as he claims.  Huge doses of Niacin cures depression?  Possibly if you're severely deficient, but otherwise, you're likely to only turn yourself very, very red.

That's not to say that I disagree with many of their points on the dangers of over-medication and poor diet, but those realities do not, by any means, necessarily lead to enemas and overdoses of vitamins.  Rather, they speak to the need for people to be discerning in their use of medication and to first look at their diet and lifestyle as a potential source for health improvement.  One needn't go from McDonald's to spirulina or goji berries.  Instead, a normal person might commit to increasing fiber intake, reducing sugar intake, and buying organic as often as is possible.  Eat smaller portions.  Take walks.  Do NOT start gobbling mega-doses of expensive vitamin supplements or mysterious ""superfoods"".

The Gerson Therapy is pretty well accepted to be unscientific quackery.

I thought it was full of interesting theories on using food and vitamins to cure ailments such as depression and cancer.  However, after watching the movie I decided to take the advice of one of the so-called Drs. and take up to 3000mg of Niacin (B3).  Never. Ever. Do. That.  It was evening when I finished watching the movie with a local 'foodie group' and so I decided to only take half of that dose.  The pills come in 500mg caps.  6 would be 3000mg.  That seemed like an awful lot.  But in the movie one of the main men interviewed kept stressing that vitamins have killed only 10 ppl in the last 23 years and that it's pretty much nonsense to think of vitamins, at any amount, as harmful.  In fact, they say that many patients have been given up to 11000mg of Niacin to combat depression.

3 minutes after I took 3 niacin pills (1500mg), my skin felt like it was on fire, my fingers got tingly, my ears started to get red.  Apparently, Niacin causes a condition called flushing.  Never was this mentioned ONCE in the movie.  The flushing got worse, my face swelled up, my lips swelled, every inch of my skin was swollen and burning like the worst sunburn you could imagine.  I was still able to breath but I seriously thought I was going into anaphalactic shock and I was trembling all over.  I have never had a reaction like that to anything.  Long story short, I ended up in the ER, with the Dr. laughing at me wanting to know why in the world I would take THREE pills and all they could do for me was give me an IV flush and send me home with benedryl.  Apparently it wears off eventually but I was miserable the entire night... my skin hot and itching and burning.

After this I did a lot of internet research on niacin and some other things that they said in the movie.  In the film they say that the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous suffered from depression and was cured of it by taking niacin supplements.  They name the founder of AA as Bill Williams.  I believe this is factually incorrect.  His name was Bill Wilson.

I'm pretty sure if you dug even a bit deeper, you'd find many holes in the documentary's facts and research.  I wouldn't recommend this video to anyone unless you did a lot of your own research to make sure what you were getting from it was actually true.

I'm a big fan of most of the recent food documentaries but this one is careless and irresponsible in the information that it presents.

Japan is the country with the highest incidence of cancer, a unique country where cancer incidence is higher than cardiovascular diseases incidence. That is not contradicting with a general note that Japanese live long.  Just that Japanese tend to develop cancer at very old age.

A few doctors mentioned power of mega-dose vitamin C therapy for cancer treatment.  The effectiveness is actually not proven clinically.  Their arguments are based on their clinical experience and biochem knoledge available they just believe.  Randomized controlled trials are now going on (May 15th, 2010), showing no sign of benefits according to Phase I trial, the most preliminary human study ([...]).

Americans are figuring out that we have to be our own doctors and that is the only way to true honest health.

This movie really helped reinforce that desire!  There were facts stated that I vaguely remember my Mother & Father & others making random statements on when I was little.  This showed me that they weren't the only ones stating the facts.  Now, I scrutinize almost everything before I buy it & have altered my diet to dramatically include much more raw fruits & vegetables.  The cacao beans are a bit tough for starters but they slowly grow on you.  Lol.

This movie seriously changed my life.  I recently lost a loved one to Cancer.  It just doesn't make sense and maybe this movie has a point that more people should be listening to.  The statistic that less than 5% of doctors are taught about nutrition tells me that doctors are paid based on people getting sick and not people getting well.  It would be interesting to see if the government stopped subsidizing corn and instead subsidized organic meats, fruits and veggies how many health issues would be eliminated.  How about that for a healthcare plan! To yourself a favor and buy this movie.  I have already bought another copy and sent it to a friend as a gift.",1267574400,63,836,4.601351351351352

Watching this has been on my to-do list for a long time. And, man, am I glad I saw it! I showed it to both my mom and husband and we all wholeheartedly agreed that this is a documentary we want to see a few times a year. It's that good! Every time I see it, I hear something new. And for the stuff I've already heard, it just further ingrains it in my subconsciousness and I feel myself internalizing its details more and more. I walk away feeling strong, smart, and empowered about my lifestyle decisions, albeit a bit frustrated at times because not enough people know this information.

I pretty much hang on every line of Food Matters. I love the discussion of vitamins and the vital role they can play in helping fight illness at various quantities. It was fascinating to learn about therapeutic effects of niacin, and its history as a cure for depression with the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. There is so more that I could write but you should see it for yourself. It's fantastic!

This is what I needed 25 years ago when I was slowly creeping along on my journey and needed direction.

As one reviewer pointed out about the ""socially-induced stupor"" that our society is in, this video might seem a little strange and unusual (i.e. RAW FOOD!), but, it is right on and it has to be said!

This video is a perfect starter as well as inspiration to stay on the path for those that are waking-up. There is enough information and fact to realize that ""food does matter"", but not too much that might otherwise overwhelm.
