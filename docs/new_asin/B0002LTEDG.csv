8028960,5,B0002LTEDG,"I really enjoy riding.  I don't get to ride as much as I would like to, and it sure is nice to have some footage to watch and keep MTB momentum going!  What's difficult is I have young kids and most of the MTB movies out there are not things I'd like to play with my kids around.  The Collective and the two other films they've made since then (Roam and Seasons) are films that don't contain the lyrics, language, and content that prevent me from watching other films with my kids.  They love to watch these movies!

As others have said the cinematography is amazing and allows you to really see the areas they are riding.  The soundtrack is a great mix of driving and exciting while offering up reflective moments as well.  I have frequently played this movie on my computer while working just to have the audio.  The special features let you really feel like you've been able to see the real people behind the film.

I can't think of any regrets as a result of buying this film other than not being able to ride enough!",1267574400,,1021,4.331578947368421
8028961,4,B0002LTEDG,"Did their wives ride with them? I noticed a lot of hiking the bike up the trails. If you ride the downhills, be prepared to pay the sweat equity. Can't believe that. Use the granny gears stud muffins.",1169424000,,200,4.2894736842105265
8028962,5,B0002LTEDG,"I have been into MNT Biking for years now, and was looking for a MNT Bike DVD that captured the spirit, and soul of the sport. I have finally found that DVD. The Collective, has the best videoography of any of the MNT Biking dvds out there. The thing I like most about it, is that it captures many of the styles, like Freeriding, Urban, singletrack, etc..Another Collective DVD is coming out in April, called ROAM. I highly recommend The Collective, and also pick up ROAM when it comes out. You cant go wrong with The Collective. Get it, get them both....",1141776000,2,555,4.450980392156863
8028963,5,B0002LTEDG,There isn't any hardcore tricks but alot of awesome and smooth single track riding.  The cinimatography is incredible.  There is also a really good soundtrack.,1136851200,5,159,5.32
8028964,5,B0002LTEDG,Probably the best mountain bike dvd that there is on the market.  As a photographer and a mountain bike rider this film is just fantastic to watch over and over with amazing cinematography.,1132704000,5,189,4.7272727272727275
8028965,5,B0002LTEDG,"A very nice collection of 8 different terrains using excellent camera angles, long cuts of video, and good match of music.  DVD put together very well with various chapters behind the scenes, interviews, and awesome crash footage.  I very much recommend this video for anyone who enjoys off road, air/freestyle, and/or urban trials.",1128556800,8,332,5.245283018867925
8028966,5,B0002LTEDG,"Pure great mountain biking thats mellow and stylish, but kick-a at the same time. Camera angles are great, and the things these guys do are the best. I'd recommend this to anyone.",1104969600,5,179,4.625
8028967,5,B0002LTEDG,"When watching mountain biking movies, you assume they will be showing crazy descents, big air, crashes, all to a rocking sound track.  This movie has all this, but it also has a whole lot more.  This is not only the visions of downhilling, but also the thoughts, feelings and spirit involved.

What catches you first is the film shot.  Bar none, the best footage ever shot.  Sharp, clean, and artistic, just like the riders.  You can tell a lot of work went into shooting and editing this movie.  It is just beautiful, and with the sound sound track, it just captures you and gets you involved with the film.  It does have it's rocking moments, but what gets you are the mellow, soulful soundtrack in between.

Lastly, the riders narration brings you that much closer to the film.  They express their feelings, what they are going through, what they have planned and why.

I could watch this film a thousand times and never be bored.  The beautiful scenery, the fantastic cinematography, creativity, and all the work behind it, makes this the best mountain bike film I have enjoyed to date.",1095292800,14,1090,4.678947368421053
8028968,5,B0002LTEDG,"well there are so many mountainbike videos out there but In my opinion none of them were able to really catch the spirit of freeride- mountainbiking. but this time it's different. the collective is the most stylish bike film ever with an incredible camera work, absolutely great music, beautiful riding-spots and in my opinion the first bike film ever that was able to bring the spirit of freeriding to the screen. I had tears in my eyes when I saw this film the first time ! If you're looking for a really good mountainbike film then buy THE COLLECTIVE !",1092787200,8,555,4.56
