3906206,4,B002CLKOTM,A GOOD PRACTICE VIDEO FOR THE YOUNG BALLERINA -- NOT FOR THE VERY YOUNG BUT GOOD FOR THE MORE DETERMINED CHILD.,1365120000,4,111,4.333333333333333
3906207,5,B002CLKOTM,"great dvd for lessons. my 4y toddler loves it because she concentrates easily, but maybe for other girls it wouldn't be so exiting. the voice is heard while the girls do the exercises, but sometimes music is a little over the voice. I do love it too, and is an excellent dvd to learn most of the steps. depending on your child you can get this or get the prima princessa collection. we have this ballet training, prima princessa and tinkerbell ballet.",1337558400,7,451,4.512195121951219
3906208,2,B002CLKOTM,"I did this video with my daughter.  We did about half of it, and then she said that she wanted to try another DVD.  It just had a person demonstrating the step, and then another of the class repeating it.  No instruction with the class repeating the step, so I had to tell my daughter what came next.  It went from one thing to another and did not combine these steps into a dance.  Although there was music, it did not enhance the experience.  We may still use this disk in the future to practice specific steps.  Other Ballet class DVD's have better instruction.",1274486400,24,564,4.365384615384615
3906209,5,B002CLKOTM,I received this DVD so quickly I was shocked. I haven't opened it since it is a gift for my grandaughter but the description on the back sounds like what I wanted for her.,1265932800,,171,4.0588235294117645

8364141,2,B002CLKOTM,very boring for little girls. more for adults,1488499200,,45,4.75
8364142,2,B002CLKOTM,"We bought this for our daughter who absolutely loves doing ballet. She also enjoys having fun and doing fun things with her time and quickly got bored due to the repetitive, monotonous instructions. There is a lack of creative, original, interresting & fun in the video, production, music or instructions. The techniques displayed are probably correct and accurate, but really what's the point if you are a kid and your not having fun. I felt sorry for the kids in the video with their morose expressions, it reminded me of the famous Degas paintings of the young ballerina's.",1482710400,,576,4.887755102040816
8364143,5,B002CLKOTM,I know nothing about ballet and my daughters need practice after class each week so I put this on and it teaches them so much more and they are ahead of so many in their class because of these videos!,1475280000,,200,4.025
8364144,3,B002CLKOTM,"Bought it for 4 years old grand daughter, it was a little much for her age.",1467504000,,75,3.75
8364145,1,B002CLKOTM,very poor,1467244800,,9,4.0
8364146,2,B002CLKOTM,"My little ones love ballet, and they have the other two ballet dvd's sold for kids here. They love those and do them several times a week. However this one just didn't pass the test. They have only watched it once in 2 months. So it just isn't ""fun"", it's more like ""work"". If you are looking for a ballet DVD for a hard core worker who needs to practice their moves, then this is it. But if you have children that like ballet for fun, pick a different one.",1457049600,3,457,4.088888888888889
8364147,4,B002CLKOTM,Came on a Sunday which was unexpected. Very simple and straightforward just what an instructional video should be,1454976000,,113,5.333333333333333
8364148,5,B002CLKOTM,"Perfect for at home practice, between weekly classes. Not too intense, holds my 7 yr old daughter's interest. Full routine also, & gets the job done!",1432857600,3,149,4.769230769230769
8364149,5,B002CLKOTM,My granddaughter loved this!,1417996800,,28,6.25
