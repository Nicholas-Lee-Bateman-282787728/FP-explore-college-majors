8186660,3,B000OU40Y8,"Full disclosure: my Spanish is a little weak (to say the least), so a lot of the humor here was lost on me (*vroosh!* airplane sound/passes flattened hand over head). Still, I like Alfredo Landa, a very interesting and talented actor who is, sadly, not very well known here in the States. He's the main reason I watched the film.

That and the fact that it's directed by...Eugenio Martin?! The guy behind ""Horror Express"" and ""It Happened at Nightmare Inn"" (aka ""A Candle for the Devil"")? Seriously?

Of course, the fact is that Martin was a versatile and more-than-competent genre helmer who had the chops to jump around from horror films to topical comedies (like this one) to spaghetti westerns (""Bad Man's River"", ""Requiem for a Gringo"") to gialli (""Death at the Deep End of the Swimming Pool"") and make solid product, regardless of the subject matter.

Also, it's co-scripted by Antonio Fos, who worked as a writer on a number of Eloy de la Iglesia's better films, like ""Cannibal Man"" and ""Glass Ceiling.""

""Esclava"" concerns the then-burgeoning radical feminist movement (cue groovy magazine cover/news article stills opening credits sequence) as viewed through the prism of mid-'70s Spanish culture. Landa plays a put-upon everyman caught in the crux of the zeitgeist.

Spanish language only, but worth seeing for fans of Landa, Martin or Spanish cinema of the Seventies. Contains nudity (a topless  Mar&iacute;a Luisa San Jos&eacute;) and some sexual/adult situations.",1347840000,,1476,5.129166666666666
