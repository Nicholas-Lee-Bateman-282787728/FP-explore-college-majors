8646049,5,B00IXMF18S,"I love the Durango Kid westerns. I grew up watching them in the 1940's. Of the 65 films, I have all but about 10 of them. I hope Sony continues to release the rare or lost ones.",1399334400,3,177,3.810810810810811

8646051,5,B00IXMF18S,"Charles Starrett starred in 131 features for Columbia Pictures, 65 of those were as the masked Durango Kid. The subject of a 1983 book by Bob Carman and Dan Scapperotti and a 2012 book by myself, Durango never failed to entertain as he rode the range astride his white horse Raider. Many of the Durango's have not been seen since their initial release, Lightning Guns, recently released by Sony, is no longer one of them. The quality of this Sony release is superb, as is that of the other Durango's Sony has released, and the movie is a good Durango. Jock Mahoney, does stunt work for Starrett, and one such stunt, toward the end of the movie, is a must see. A plea to fellow fans: Get behind this Sony release and maybe we will get to see Raiders of Tomahawk Creek, Quick On The Trigger, El Dorado Pass, Frontier Gun Law, Rustlers of the Badlands, and other Durango rarities. Thanks for another excellent quality release Sony.",1398470400,9,928,4.562874251497006
