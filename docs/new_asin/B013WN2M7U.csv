7374360,5,B013WN2M7U,Best nature documentary I've ever seen. The shots they have captured are just mind boggling. The ocean episode is my favorite. I've got shivers thinking about it,1484870400,,161,5.0
7374361,5,B013WN2M7U,"This film series is the pinnacle of UK produced natural history programmes, in my opinion, capturing amazing dramas between predator and prey often resulting in the escape of the prey. Successful or not there is always beauty  in the Chase. It is a fitting memento to my  life 'shared' with Sir David Attenborough from Zoo Quest on.",1483833600,,332,4.807017543859649
7374362,5,B013WN2M7U,Who doesn't love David Attenborough?  It's pretty gruesome so maybe not for a young child.,1481068800,,90,5.0
7374363,5,B013WN2M7U,Anything rated by David Attenborough is a must see film. Thank you.,1479254400,,67,4.666666666666667
7374364,5,B013WN2M7U,"Awsome, great narration as always by Attenborough!",1477180800,,50,6.285714285714286
7374365,5,B013WN2M7U,"This is on par with Planet Earth, and some shots might be even better. The sheer variety of predators and prey in their various environments is truly spectacular. You'd be astonished to find the many unique and incredible species that exist on Earth! Definitely worth $20. I'd buy this for $100!",1476921600,,295,4.803921568627451
7374366,3,B013WN2M7U,"Incredible HD footage, once again brilliantly shot through the BBC wildlife camera lens. Beautifully shot. Worth ever cent of the HD purchase price. My only issue with it, is that the title suggests animal ""action"" as it were, i.e. the hunt/kill. And it is just that, except each episode isn't filled with it. With the title of the series you expect tons of meat eating predators hunting on the African plane. But this documentary series focuses more on the hunting failures, and not the successes. Tons of footage of predators hunting...and failing. To illustrate the reality of the hunt, and the fact that for example the cheetah will only be successful in 1 out of 20 hunts, this series shows 25 minutes of the cheetah's failed attempts, one after the other, and then finally a 3-5 minute shot of a cheetah's successful kill. A bit strange, but if you've seen any of the other BBC nature series, you know that the filming and cinematography are more 'poetic' and less 'national geographic.'",1476316800,,993,4.812865497076023
7374367,5,B013WN2M7U,"I actually bought this more for my cat than myself.  She is enthralled with David Attenborough, and watches very attentively.  Thankfully, I find the series very informative and well done.  If you have a cat who happens to like Attenborough like I do, or you're just interested in nature documentaries, this is a series well worth your time and money.",1475539200,2,351,4.816666666666666

7374370,5,B013WN2M7U,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!! I happened upon this show late in the season and couldn't find all the episodes. I was hooked on the first episode I watched, its truly amazing! Even my 20 year old daughter became addicted to watching it! I cant wait and pray they do another season! Its a MUST watch show! Its jaw dropping, and so educational. You really understand the ""circle of life"" and how every living thing plays a part in life!",1475452800,,424,4.448717948717949
7374371,5,B013WN2M7U,Incredible footage (especially on HD TV) and great insights in to animal behavior.,1474848000,,82,5.384615384615385
7374372,1,B013WN2M7U,how many more shows about animals killing for food?  we do it also as humans but we hide it,1474675200,,91,3.789473684210526
7374373,5,B013WN2M7U,Another breathtakingly beautiful and fabulous BBC Earth show! I love David Attenbourough!,1473465600,,89,6.5
7374374,5,B013WN2M7U,"Another incredible, awe inspiring documentary with cinematography surpassing that of the amazing Life series and Africa. The shots are filmic in quality, it's hard to imagine how they managed to improve on the previous documentaries but they did. Attenborough's narration is captivating and draws the viewer in. Nothing comes close to the quality of the BBC nature documentaries.",1472428800,2,379,5.551724137931035
7374375,2,B013WN2M7U,"I'm sure the documentary must be great, I wouldn't know though, because the video streaming quality is too poor to watch, oh and btw: you can't download amazon video's you purchase.",1472169600,,181,4.870967741935484
7374376,5,B013WN2M7U,"really good! for those who are interested in primarly the hunt, not breeding or whatever, this is perfect! and with Attenborough, it's super!",1471478400,,141,5.173913043478261

8729077,1,B013WN2M7U,"I did a search for this  DVD, and this was the only one that came up in the search results. I was so excited to find it, I didn't read the details, and just placed my order.
Well, when my family went to actually watch it, we found that it was coded to the UK, and that in order to view it, I would have to buy it its own designated DVD player. *sad face* and all that jazz. But because I opened it, and it was obviously shipped from over seas, I am just going to have to eat this useless copy. It may be great, but I'll never know.",1520985600,,531,3.7837837837837838
