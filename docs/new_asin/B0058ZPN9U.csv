4618091,3,B0058ZPN9U,"The most telling feature regarding this film is the director: Jason Connery.  While I won't say it's a name usually associated with (be polite) crap, but, it is.  Had I known he was the director I don't think I would have sought out this film.  Jason London being a part of this project also didn't help.  But I do like Bruce Boxleitner and John Shea even though both have followed the path leading to less (be polite) than sterling work of late.  The so-called monsters/aliens might as well have been made of tinfoil, they looked that artificial.  I was also expecting larger numbers and different types considering where they were housed.  But no, just a handful, locked in a complex that was obviously on the cheap, judging from the lack of decent lighting.  As far as thrills, spills, and chills, very little of any, comparatively speaking (par for the course), this was rudimentary fare.

4618102,3,B0058ZPN9U,"Hold on to yer' seats as the 'after dark' series brings you this tense movie ( for your pleasure ? )
Officials of the secretive 'Area 51' unit give in to public pressure and speculation by allowing a ''restricted'' tour of the base
by some well known journalist's.
The area however has 'beings' not of this world within it's compound, it is not intended that the visitor's get anywhere near these........but, things go wrong when some of the out-of-this-world creatures break out causing havoc and terror.
Has some decent graphics on board, and is worth a spin for 'horror-feast' fans, not great but watchable.

4618147,4,B0058ZPN9U,"Bruce Boxleitner seems to be in a lot of SY FY Channel movies anymore. If you see his name in the credits, you can be sure that the film will (maybe not be a classic) be a movie worth seeing. He plays the head of Area 51 in this picture. A high level officer that has kept the true secret of Area 51 quiet for years. At least until now anyway. With the press and distinguished visitors present, the secret of Area 51 escapes and makes up for all those years of solitude with a proper murderous rampage through the Military Facility.

While not a classic, this is a good film with a good cast and I don't think you'll be wasting any time watching it. This is probably one of the SY FY channels' better films. The special effects and special effects make-up are above par, for a change.

Either rent this or buy it (if you buy it from Amazon.com, you'll also get to watch it as a rental for about 30 days.) I'm waiting for my DVD to arrive as I write this, having watched it on my Roku device last night. I'm glad I ordered this as a DVD and not a rental, this is a film well worth having in my collection (and I have about 500 DVDs (and an unknown amount of VHS still) in my collection.)

So you can take the advice of someone that has spent a lot of time watching DVDs of all genres. I am permanently injured from a On-The-Job Injury at work and can't do too much more than watch DVDs. So trust me, you'll like it.",1369699200,,1414,4.079136690647482

4618173,2,B0058ZPN9U,"Once again the Syfy network has decided to offer an original film via the After Dark franchise. The difference is that this time around they've got a fairly decent flick. It's not Oscar material but it never pretends to be either.

Due to the public outcry over secrets being held at what has been called Area 51, the military and top level politicians have decided to allow a couple of journalists in to see that they have nothing to hide. Of course we know they do have something to hide and as we watch base commander Col. Martin (Bruce Boxleitner) explain to his men, the only things these journalists will see is what they want them to.

The two journalists are Sam Whitaker (John Shea), a top network news anchor, respected for his in depth investigative pieces and Claire (Vanessa Branch), an online journalists who's blog is the most read news site looking into cover ups. Along with them are their camera people. These four and the Col. head down to the first level where he will allow them to see that there is nothing to hide except a few military secrets.

What they don't know is that there is a deeper level to area 51, one that does indeed house not just one but several aliens. For whatever reason these aliens, completely different from one another, are about to break free and seek freedom. Talk about bad timing.

The base goes on lockdown and the tour group takes cover where they can. Unfortunately one alien, the big bulky scaly one with claws, seems to enjoy popping heads off soldiers and making blood squirt everywhere. Yes, the costume is pretty bad but it harkens back to the good old man in suit monster movies. It doesn't take itself seriously and it's a good thing.

The other alien is a little more difficult to deal with. It has the ability to change form into anyone it touches. Like the film THE THING, we suddenly have an alien who could be any one in the group. So of course they split up every now and then.

Topside we have two soldiers with back stories that just don't seem to matter with the exception that both were heralded for bravery or cowardice and now have a chance to redeem themselves (which you know they will before the film ends). The question is can they do so before the entire base is blown sky high and can they stop the aliens from escaping at the same time?

As I said earlier, this movie doesn't take itself too seriously. Instead, it's like a classic B movie with plenty of action, enough story to get by and an alien that is rather cheaply made. There's also a twist included near the end but who am I to reveal what little secrets this film has? All in all it's in good fun and for those looking for a short distraction it will do the trick.",1332201600,,2704,4.417670682730924

4618176,3,B0058ZPN9U,"Be warned...51 is NOT a ""true"" After Dark original like others in the series.  51 is a SyFy channel tv movie and it shows.  Unlike earlier ADO superior efforts, 51 is an amateurish attempt to cash in on the iconic legend of Area 51.
Under Jason Connery's (son of 007 Sean) pedestrian direction, the plot is fairly simple:  a group of reporters is inexplicably granted permission to tour the legendary Hangar 18 and upon their arrival, one of the captive aliens stages an uprising resulting in the release of other dangerous aliens.
There are no CGI monsters, rather a return to the men in rubber suits circa the 1950's.  Connery even allows the camera to dwell shamelessly on these creatures to further stress the low budget.
B movie stalwarts Bruce Boxleitner, Jason London, Rachel Miner and John Shea try gamely but given their material, there's not much hope.  And let's not forget the friendly Yoda clone---how original!
51 is sort of entertaining in a quirkish way but certainly not a classic!",1317254400,4,998,4.812865497076023
4618177,1,B0058ZPN9U,"I've always had a vague fascination for UFOlogy and Area 51. I thought that with an engagingly simple title (""51""), and an equally simple premise (security problem in the course of a visit by two (two?) journalists to the legendary facility in the Nevada desert), it just might work. It didn't.

The entire production, from opening titles to end titles reeked of low-budget inadequacy. This can work if it's part of the intent, but ""51"", it seems, was a serious effort at movie-making. Honestly, though, in this day and age when CGI can be run on relatively modest platforms at moderate expense, is there really any excuse for the cheesy ""man-in-a-rubber-suit"" monster? Naturally, starting from these unpromising special effects, it was inevitable that the filmmakers would compensate for their toy aliens by pouring out buckets of blood. Lots of blood, lots of silliness, lots of unexplained overacting, and lots of disbelief at the incredibly bad quality of a) writing; b) sets (a random warehouse somewhere and a few hangars at an abandoned airfield), and c) acting.

The plot line, such as it was, was inadequately developed, and simply unbelievable in places (e.g. a top-secret military installation with only a dozen or so trained guards - and those, armed with Vietnam-era M-16's??? A Willy's-style jeep loaded with TNT packed in CARDBOARD boxes??? A multi-level secure biohazard lab underground in the desert, but with more holes in its security than a colander???)...

Sorry, but if you have a choice between watching this lifeless dog of a movie, or spending your $3.00 on some twinkies and pork rinds, go for the twinkies and pork rinds. They have more substance.

I know that LA film people have to work, but this extravaganza of inanity is a poor excuse for work. Back to parking cars and slinging burgers, folks.",1316908800,6,1826,4.996710526315789
4618178,2,B0058ZPN9U,"51, or Area 51, or whatever you want to call it, is another Sci-Fi Channel co-production (like the cringe-worthy Scream of the Banshee) with this year's After Dark lineup.  With that all in mind, you probably already know what you're getting here.  Directed by Jason Connery (son of Sean) and featuring genre stalwarts like Bruce Boxleitner, Jason London, Rachel Miner, and John Shea all slumming it here as the fabled military base succumbs to an attack by the aliens they've been keeping prisoner for years, 51 delivers the goods for those looking for low-quality shocks and splatters.  It really is better than the sum of its parts however, even with the overly weak acting and occasional unintentional hilarity that arises during some of the action sequences.  All in all, 51 isn't the worst flick of this type you'll come across, and that has to count for something I guess in the end.",1316822400,3,890,4.8355263157894735
4618179,3,B0058ZPN9U,"I think that you need to have drank 2 pints of strong ale in order to tune into the entertainment factor of this movie, plus you had better not have been in the military.
The storyline and the special effects were not bad.  The irritating factor of this movie was the characters were supposed to act out convincing military personalities but their acting failed more times than it succeeded.  In addition to the inability of the actors to act out convincing military personalities and in addition to the military actors' failure to carry out interaction that would most often occur in a military community, when the colonel (and I use the small ""c"" on purpose) caved in on carrying out the military protocol for containment because it involved him dying, I was thinking that I should have drank at least 4 shots of brandy plus a minimum of 2 pints of ale so that I would be drunk enough not to notice that the 40 year veteran had done such a ludicrous decision.  Shoot and I spent 3 bucks on this thing.  Bummer, but I have seen worse movies.  The overall point is see this movie if you run out of seeing every other movie on the Internet but don't forget to drink and then watch.",1316736000,4,1180,4.444444444444445

8462611,3,B0058ZPN9U,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2011 and directed by Jason Connery, ""51"" (aka Area 51) chronicles events at the secretive base 80 miles north of Las Vegas (25 miles south of the town of Rachel, Nevada) when the Air Force is compelled by public pressure to allow a group of reporters to visit the base. Horror ensues when a few aliens imprisoned in the hidden underground complex attempt an escape.

The tone is mostly serious, but with a slight campy vibe in the first act. The plot is akin to Aliens (1979) except on a TV budget and taking place at a desert military facility. Three kinds of aliens are included: an interesting Super-Adaptoid-like one, a wicked-monster type featuring child and mother (Lady Death) and a smaller, kindly one with psychic powers. All three are pretty well done for a TV movie. Unfortunately, the group of reporters is thoroughly dull; the actors are serviceable, but their characters (as written) are forgettable. The only character I found interesting was Sgt. Hanna, played by petite cutie Rachel Miner.

Overall, the proceedings are kinda Meh, but not without some interesting points.

THE FILM RUNS 90 minutes and was shot in the studio in Louisiana combined with some desert locations (I don't know where though). WRITERS: Kenny Yakkel (screenplay) & Lucy Mukerjee-Brown (story).
