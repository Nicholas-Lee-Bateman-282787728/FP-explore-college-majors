8081012,5,B000AYQO1U,"Taking place somewhere in East Germany, this movie depicts the reality of small village/town life. I enjoyed the setting and the creative characters. The plot unfolds rather slowly but then picks up quickly. A sense of humor is a must for its viewers. I thought this movie was lighthearted and naughtily funny. I recommend the Liberated Zone (LZ) to Euro movie buffs. I don't think the average American would be impressed by LZ's simple but lifelike reflection of East German life in the early 2000s.",1501459200,,500,4.894117647058824
8081013,2,B000AYQO1U,"Did not hold my interest. Too predictable and boring. I fast forwarded through most of the movie. Also, I hate subtitles in movies where I speak both languages fluently. I wish there were a way to turn subtitles on/off. I always check to make sure they translated everything correctly LOL",1440892800,,288,4.78

8081015,1,B000AYQO1U,Not that good... I Didn't finish the whole thing. I would not watch again.  I would not recommend to friends or family.,1376438400,,119,4.409090909090909
8081016,1,B000AYQO1U,I opened this movie by mistake. I did not view it and would not view it in the again or in the future.,1374883200,,102,3.4782608695652173
8081017,2,B000AYQO1U,"This indie film talks the talk, but when it comes time to walk it switches scenes. It's a little hard to follow due to its starting one scene and switching to another before it gets going. There's a lot of sex or at least the beginnings of it and a lot of talk of sex, but nothing is shown.
An English town recruits a black soccer player who wins all their games for them and everyone adores him, women and men. And they adore each other as everyone is screwing everyone except their mates. Some have to settle for their imagination though.
I gave this two stars because I didn't hate it, I was just confused by it. Maybe others will love it.
There is no nudity and any sex scenes get cut away from before they develope.",1374883200,6,720,4.22463768115942
8081018,2,B000AYQO1U,"Being involved with German programs I have seen this film twice. The constant theme of cheating on one's partner is useless entertainment that is embarrassing to watch. The movie may give you some insight to German society of the DDR, but otherwise it just lowers the intelligence of the viewer.

Watch Goodbye Lenin, or Mephisto, or anything with quality instead.",1212624000,,364,5.066666666666666
8081019,3,B000AYQO1U,"(2.5/5 stars) The film revolves around a small town that has a perennially losing football (soccer) team, yet sees its hopes rise when a star is traded to the team. He becomes an instant hit with the townsfolk, who place all their hopes on his shoulders. Alas, it is the nature of sports fame that one is only as good as one's next game and his popularity depends on winning. Will he be good enough to carry the team and win the championship? Set against this backdrop is the love story between a young woman, who is engaged to a successful young businessman, and the soccer star. Without wanting to reveal too much of the story, I will simply say there is more than one philanderer in town. Who ends up with whom? For a comedy, this movie isn't very funny. The plot is not terribly interesting and not many of the characters are sympathetic or likeable. Ultimately it is also a little depressing given the fact nothing much positive happens during its course. It is a low budget film as well, though this doesn't necessarily affect it negatively because neither special effects nor big name celebrities are essential to tell the tale. There are some decent things about the movie that keep it from being a complete waste of time. I did like the glimpse into modern life in East Germany and I like the fact the DVD is presented in German rather than being dubbed. Additionally, karmic reactions provide most of the movie's redeeming values. For example, Sylvia's brother, who exemplifies a young jerk, gets beaten up by the Chinese youth he had bullied. The movie also has an energy and ambition to it that initially hold great promise; unfortunately, the story and pacing don't quite live up to this. The ending is fairly lighthearted, which is welcome, though the ""surprise"" ending wasn't much of a surprise since it was revealed, albeit very briefly, at the beginning of the movie. I'm not certain why this was done if the intent was to truly provide a surprise. Finally, it appears the title might be doppeldeutig, referring to both the liberation of the former East Germany from Soviet and Communist control, as well as a sexual liberation of the characters, with interracial, homosexual and adulterous relationships being themes. Whether or not this is the case, the film is not interesting enough to warrant my recommendation.",1157500800,3,2333,4.762962962962963
8081020,5,B000AYQO1U,"I originally saw this film at a festival and loved it. Very funny story, lots of plot twists and turns. Story follows a town's resurgence when the local soccer team imports a superstar footballer. Economy and libido increase exponentially as the team rises in the standings, leading to a hilarious climax. Two thumbs up!",1136937600,4,320,4.944444444444445
