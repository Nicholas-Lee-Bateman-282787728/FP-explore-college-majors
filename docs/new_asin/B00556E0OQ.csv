8457565,2,B00556E0OQ,"Bach and Rilling together are an unbeatable combination, something Unitel must have assumed would drive sales of this disgraceful new DVD.  There is no indication whatever on the DVD case what the DVD contains. Nor is there any kind of booklet, much less even a flimsy piece of paper with the contents, track listings, etc.  Only in opening the menu after you insert the DVD in a player, do you see 3 tracks (incarnatus, crucifixus, resurexit) but still no hint about what music is on it.  As the narration (English overdubbed over Rilling commentary) proceeds, you eventually figure out that for each of these major categories, there will generally be something from an organ chorale prelude, a passion, a cantata, and an oratorio. None is complete, but all are beautifully performed as you'd expect from Rilling. All the snippets are identified by the narrator by title only, i.e., there's no mention of any BWV numbers.  There are no subtitles (or subtitle options) so you can see the text of what's being sung.  The DVD concludes with complete crucifixus and resurexit sections from the B-minor Mass in a performance different from the one available here some time ago on VHS and in Japan on DVD.  The problem with this DVD, in sum, is not with the music but with the cheap, shoddy Unitel production.  Buy it for the music and the textual insights into a narrow category of Bach's music, but don't expect Unitel to make it easy.",1315440000,11,1432,4.77327935222672
