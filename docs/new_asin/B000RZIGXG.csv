2877217,5,B000RZIGXG,"My daughter loves this DVD and any DVD featuring the Wonder Pets. If she hears the theme song she drops whatever she's doing and runs right to the TV. It's a great show that shows kids how to work together, share and be helpful. I recommend to any parent with infants/toddlers.",1207353600,,277,4.450980392156863
2877218,5,B000RZIGXG,"My 2-year-old son LOVES this show, and I'm so happy that they have it on DVD since we don't have cable! He would watch this every minute of every day if I let him! He loves to dance to the Wonder Pets song, and he laughs and smiles throughout the whole video! Very happy!!!",1199664000,,273,4.074074074074074
2877219,5,B000RZIGXG,My 3-year-old loves this and couldn't get enough of it during the Christmas season. She's still singing the sweet songs from the DVD. The messages of teamwork and friendship are great complements to teaching little ones the spirit of Christmas.,1199664000,,244,5.125
2877220,4,B000RZIGXG,"My kid loves the this one. I really should give it 5 stars but it's just so tiring. It's all of the things a kid will enjoy about the Wonderpets...the singing, the saving of pets...but the parents may be exhausted by it all after the first 100 times. Again, there aren't that many episodes...maybe 6? I don't know if that is the standard amount, and I could just be overly picky....but I think children will just love this.",1196899200,,423,4.435897435897436
2877221,1,B000RZIGXG,"won't play on my DVD. Purchased in Asia, seems that many DVD products are regionally restricted. Unhappy for that reason. Maybe it is a good show, but it will not be viewed by my child unless I buy another DVD player.",1196467200,,217,4.317073170731708
2877222,5,B000RZIGXG,"My kids LOVE The Wonder Pets!  This DVD was as cute as can be.  The ""Save the Reindeer"" show is their favorite of all the episodes on this particular DVD.  Such sweet little songs & the ""teamwork/friendship"" message is clear.",1193961600,5,225,4.575
2877223,5,B000RZIGXG,"My 2 year-old son loves the Wonder Pets, and I have to say of all the things out there for him to watch Wonder Pets rank pretty high for me, too. I wish there were more episodes on this disk, but everything on there is wonderful quality entertainment for tots and adults. Yes, I watch episodes with my son - so many of them are real gems! I have been pre-ordering Wonder Pets DVDs as they become available (if only to save room on the DVR) and can't wait to get the next one.",1193616000,3,475,4.0638297872340425
2877224,5,B000RZIGXG,"We must have waited a year - at least - for new Wonder Pets episodes, but this one doesn't disappoint.  Although there is a Christmas-themed reindeer episode, the others are as good (if not better) than the many, many other pets that have been saved in past episodes.  My kids (3 and 6 - who started watching this at 5 and 2) STILL love this show, and are also learning about places and animals as they go.  As a mom, that makes me love it, too - although I'd probably love it anyway, thanks to the adult-aimed cracks made throughout the show.  Now, hopefully we won't have to wait another year for MORE WONDER PETS!",1193097600,7,616,4.3304347826086955

2877247,5,B000RZIGXG,If your kids like the wonder pets they will like this one! My daughter watches this one over and over! The really like the Christmas story! The wonder pets have a cute story and good music. There is nothing to worry about in a negative way or anything odd or bad that they will learn from watching the wonder pets!,1360022400,,314,4.25

2877250,4,B000RZIGXG,My son has watched this DVD countless times but I expected it to have at least a winter theme to the whole thing. I think there is a moose in Alaska in one of the other episodes but the other animals are random like a camel in the desert.,1294444800,,238,3.877551020408163

2877252,5,B000RZIGXG,My 3 1/2 granddaughter loves the Wonder Pets.... I think this is the 3rd video she has..... she is mildy autistic and these have been great.  Teaches them that TEAM WORK..... working together.  Has helped her talking about her EMOTIONS - sad.... happy .... poor Reindeer.  Mommy loves it because gd will watch it while she is getting dinner fixed.... Highly recommend the WONDER PETS,1289433600,,383,4.861538461538461
2877253,5,B000RZIGXG,"I have two grandchildren. My Granddaughter is eight years old while my Grandson just turned three. One day while watching my grandson, he started to get rambunctious, so I tried to get him to watch some cartoons on cable. That didn't work so well. Then I remembered the Wonder Pets and that haunting theme song from when my granddaughter used to watch the show. Luckily it happened to be on and I got my grandson to watch it. From that day on, all he does is sing about teamwork and the Wonder Pets. He even has me singing it along with him.

I decided to get a couple of DVD's for him so he can watch the WP's whenever he wants to and all I can say is that I glad I did. This is got to be one of the best cartoon shows ever made.  Showing different parts of the world while stressing tolerance and teamwork is wonderful and so is this DVD.",1267142400,,840,4.115853658536586
2877254,5,B000RZIGXG,"This is the third Wonder Pets dvd we have purchased through Amazon (they're way cheaper at this site) and we're always very pleased with the product & quality. My 13 month old enjoys watching Save the Reindeer, Save the Bengal Tiger & Save the Nutcracker everyday. I rotate the three dvds weekly so she doesn't get sick of watching them. When we get more money we will purchase the new Wonder Pets dvd about the Circus.",1236816000,,419,4.526315789473684
2877255,5,B000RZIGXG,"Good length of episodes (about 1.5 hours total of all), my 2.5 year old son loves the Wonder Pets.  This DVD included several episodes we haven't seen on TV (Nick Jr/Noggin).  Shipping was fast also.",1228089600,2,199,4.6571428571428575
2877256,3,B000RZIGXG,"I thought this was going to be a Christmas DVD of the Wonderpets, but the only thing it has to do with Christmas is the part about saving the Reindeer and the beginning of that story line.  All of the other stories on this DVD have nothing to do with Christmas, so I was a little disappointed with that.  Why make a DVD with one Christmas story, and the rest normal? I don't get it?  Oh well I guess..my 2 year old loves it.",1218585600,,424,4.023809523809524

8203306,5,B000RZIGXG,"This was like $3 as an add on item, so I added it to our cart since my 2 year old has been missing Wonder Pets after it was taken off Amazon Prime Video.  I wish I'd realized it had the same episodes we already had (totally mistake over being excited about how cheap it was, lol) but now when she wants JUST Wonder Pets rather than a compilation of Nick Jr. Holiday shows, I can throw this on.",1506384000,,393,3.9746835443037973
