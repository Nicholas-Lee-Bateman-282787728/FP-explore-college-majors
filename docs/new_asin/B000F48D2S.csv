8117159,4,B000F48D2S,"Nice story about a lonely grandfather's attempt to win attention of granddaughter, in some competition with her parents.  Engaging characters, felt real.  My wife and I really enjoyed it and are glad to have a copy for our 2 year old to watch when she is a few years older.",1153440000,2,273,4.44
8117160,4,B000F48D2S,"It's not often that one can find a family film that truly appeals to all members of the family. ""Personal Sergeant"" is that rare film that is both entertaining and enlightening. The relationship between the grandfather and his soccer-obsessed granddaughter is really absorbing. There should be more films like this at the local theater. It is a realistic portrait of the contemporary American family.",1153353600,3,400,5.265625
