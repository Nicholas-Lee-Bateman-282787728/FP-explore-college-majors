2987752,5,B000WNHTCC,"Very good collection of early 40's black-and-white Universal horror films.

The Black Cat (1941) A bunch of mercenary heirs gather at a the mansion of their elderly relative to hear about what their take is going to be.  The old lady is a cat collector (a hoarder, today).  An antiques dealer and his destructive assistant show up to see what they can lay their hands on.  They are supposed to be the comedy relief in this flick.  They made me cringe.  I hate to see any beautiful old mansion gutted and destroyed and the assistant trashes vases and chairs, believing that will increase the antique's value.  Ouch.  Well, aside from that, the film isn't bad.  Someone off's the old lady and the antique dealer runs rampant, trying to solve the mystery.

Man Made Monster (1941) A carnival worker survives a bus crash where everyone else was electrocuted.  Due to his natural resistance to electricity he lives.  He is invited to live temporarily in the house of a kindly scientist so he can be examined.  What the good doctor doesn't realize is that his off-the-rails assistant has his own warped agenda.

Horror Island (1941) My favorite of this set.  Three sailors, who are always looking for a get-rich-quick scheme inherit an island with a castle and a rumored treasure hidden there.  They decide to set up a ""Spend a Weekend at a Haunted Castle"" tour for gullible tourists but end up with more than they can handle.  Moves quickly and is great fun.

Night Monster (1942) My second favorite of this set.  A reclusive, crippled millionaire invites the three doctors who treated him to his mansion to witness a new, supposedly healing technique.  Along for the weekend are a local novelist, a female psychiatrist, a lecherous chauffer, a lurking butler, a creepy gate-keeper, a Mrs. Danvers-type housekeeper, a supposedly mentally ill sister, a knows-more-than-is-good-for-her maid, and a Hindu mentalist.  There are also mysterious killings going on in the vicinity.  Irene Hervey as the psychiatrist is refreshingly liberated in a non-threatening way for the 40's.  Very good and at times very atmospheric and spooky.

Captive Wild Woman (1943)  A mad doctor (a very good John Carradine in his younger days) through unscrupulous experiments transforms a gorilla into a murderous beautiful woman.
The quality of all the films is super-excellent.  Highly, highly recommended.",1453507200,,2377,5.030769230769231

2987756,3,B000WNHTCC,"3 Hits, 2 Misses and a modest ""thumbs up"" if you are a fan of the genre and Universal. ""Horror Island"" is fairly amusing and goofy fun once they actually get to the island 25 minutes in. Stars Dick Foran and Peggy Moran (whom also starred together in ""The Mummy's Tomb""). ""The Black Cat"" has an impressive cast: Rathbone, Ladd, Gayle Sondergaard, and a young and surprisingly energetic Broderick Crawford slicing the ham thick in a more upscale version of Universal's ""B"" horror staples from the era. Then ""Night Monster"" with a small part for Bela Lugosi and a young and beefy Leif Erickson playing a heel. It's fun and standard fare but suffers from a dumb ending. Those 3 are the hits, with ""The Black Cat"" being the best of the lot.
""Man Made Monster"" stars Lon Cheney Jr, if ""stars"" is stretched to the point of absurdity. Lionel Atwell does his best to be the evil mad scientist and make things interesting, it's at best a lukewarm ""OK"". Then we have the absurd, horrible and complete waste of celluloid and
the viewer's time ""Captive Wild Woman"". It's lame, it's boring, it's completely out of place in a set with 3 ""scary dark house"" movies and 1 similar: mostly it's Milburne Stone pretending to be Clyde Beatty with about 1/3 of the movie being the ACTUAL Clyde Beatty and his circus in Second Unit shots. Just a really bad movie.
If you are a fan of Universal's ""B"" movies from this era (early 40's), you will probably like this set. For $15 Prime it's not a bad deal. However if you do not have the Universal Monsters sets I would strongly suggest you apply the $15 (or $20 non-Prime) for those collections of OUTSTANDING movies as they are far far move enjoyable and while more expense they have the distinct advantage of being WORTH IT!",1442016000,,1750,4.541139240506329

Some of the great and cheesy haunted house movies were made at this time.  I got this collection because it had an old favorite of mine, the Night Monster.  As I watched other movies of the set, I remembered them too.  Disclaimer: I love the haunted house movies with hidden passages, paintings with eyes that move, secret panels and domestic help that are down right scary.  You can get the individual films but pay almost as much as you pay for the five of this set.  There are lots of familiar faces.  The transfers are clear and sharp.

You get five very good movies, The Black Cat which is the one with a lot of humor although the mystery is there and keeps you guessing to the very end. Next is the Man Made Monster, very good with great acting by Lionel Atwill, Anne Nager and a great job by Lon Chaney, JR. Horror Island is next and this is one of the best of the five with some great humor. The best one of all is next, Night Monster with many great actors of the time. Last is Captive Wild Woman. This one has some very good 40s creepy parts to it. All five movies were made between 41 and 43. This is a great set of movies you will watch often.",1409443200,2,694,3.8943661971830985

Man Made Monster, one I haven't seen in years, was fine.  Both Horror Island and Night Monster were okay with Captive Wild Woman, IMO, the weakest in the set.

More entertaining overall?  Seeing so many actors from other Universal favorites of mine and Universal's recycling sound effects and music that took me back to more than one Abbott and Costello classic.

2987785,5,B000WNHTCC,"I bought this DVD set around Halloween 07, it was an exclusive Best Buy 2 disc DVD set and I am finally getting to re-review this now. I've got so many horror films to catch up on! This DVD set contains five rare Universal films from the 40's. The prints are clean and there are some trailers, but the best reason to buy this set is because all the films included are seeing their first DVD releases!

If your a Universal fan it's a great set. I will review each film as I watch them, so I will be adding to this. The first film 'The Black Cat' is a film I had never seen. When I bought the set I thought it was the 1934 classic with Karloff and Lugosi....I'm glad it wasn't as I already have that film on the Bela Lugosi collection.......anyway..... 'The Black Cat' on this set is a murder/mystery/comedy from 1941. The film stars Basil Rathbone and Bela Lugosi in a fun supporting character. I did like this fun film full of secret passages and things that go bump in the night. The next film 'Man Made Monster' is a very good Lon Chaney Jr. film. The Third film 'Horror Island' is a misleading title as there isn't much horror going on, on this island! It's actually a mystery/comedy film that doesn't have much comedy in it either. This is the weakest of the five films on this set. I have reviewed these films on the individual release or VHS release. Please look for those releases.

Man Made Monster 4 1/4 Stars

2987786,5,B000WNHTCC,"This is an excellent collection of rare (and rarely seen) Universal horror movies from the 1940s.  (There is another, better known Universal Horror movie made in the 1930s that is also titled ""The Black Cat"", starring Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff, but the one in this collection is a different movie, an old dark house movie.  (Although this ""The Black Cat"" also features Bela Lugosi, this time without Karloff, instead joined by Basil Rathbone, Broderick Crawford, and Alan Ladd, among others.)  The quality of the videos in this collection is outstanding.  If you are a fan of classic Universal horror films, you will not be disappointed with these four excellent and interesting movies.  ***SPOILER ALERT***  One of my favorite lines from ""The Black Cat"" (included here) is when Basil Rathbone's character is trying to solve the mystery of one of the deaths in the house, to which Broderick Crawford's character responds, ""Who does he think he is, Sherlock Holmes?""",1398816000,2,969,5.062893081761007
2987787,5,B000WNHTCC,"In complete candor I would suggest these movies are both suspenseful and humorous. It's the touch of humor that I find most enticing. The actors are grand; the sets feature the Universal emphasis on shadow and lighting. The music soundtrack is brilliant and enhances the unfolding drama. The b/w film has so much potential to enhance the mood and setting that, if you are a ""color only"" fan, you might be converted to b/w on the spot. From our sophisticated 21st century view of life, with its realism and vacuous values, the high entertainment value of these films will fill in whatever distorted view of the past you might be harboring with all the life-changing events of the 1940s that charged the minds of people to break away from WW II blues and escape into the celuloid fantasy of the moment.

Disappointingly, the lineup of early-'40s Universal B's on this 'Classic Movie Archive' collection serves up more slapstick antics and goofy exposition than chills or memorable monsters. On the positive side, a few iconic actors appear here and there (Lugosi, Rathbone, Chaney, Jr.), the prints all are in decent shape and the price is reasonable, but be warned that these are minor, minor offerings (comedy/whodunits, mad-scientist retreads, etc.) that lack any identifying style and qualify as horror only by the loosest definition.

2987798,1,B000WNHTCC,"I ordered this set not too long ago but I ended up having to return it. There are two discs here of some fair to good horror flicks from various years of long ago from Universal. I made a quick view of the first three flicks and was shocked at how terribly poor Universal had released these flicks onto DVD.They were in disappointing condition with much dirt and other built in defects,along with a heavy dose of graininess.
However,one cannot just return something because it looks poor. No,what really got me was the major flaw in the first film The Black Cat. I have always had a soft spot for this campy cult classic but the flaw in question happens as the old lady starts to read her will. She looks down at the paper and at this point the printing/transfer machine closes in on her and the film slows down. Immediately after you can see the film trying to speed back up and trying to sink the lips to the words being spoken. I thought this very odd,so I dug out my VHS copy and looked at the same scene. In the same scene on the VHS,the camera doesn't move in at all but the film does have a defect(a film emulsion crack)which passes quickly. So it seems Universal in this DVD release tried to hide the fact it was just releasing this film onto DVD using the same old print used on the VHS version;and on top of that trying to hide the defect which would have given it all away!
The condition of the films in general was bad enough but this ""deception"" was the straw that broke this camels back. And I would urge you to give this DVD set a wide pass. One should expect and get better than Universal gives us here.",1344124800,3,1619,4.259740259740259

Horror Island is the weakest in this series.
Night Monster is a guilty pleasure I love the cast and Ford Beebe is the director. I have watched it several times since recieving the set and it is a joy.

I have a small collection of B-Horror from the 50's & 60's, mostly cult classics and British, some obscure.  This set is not worthy of addition to the likes of The Crawling Eye (The Trollenberg Terror), City of the Dead, Witchcraft, The Blind Dead series, even the rather bizarre Kronos...much less worth sitting through.  A very poor investment.",1288224000,,549,5.066666666666666
2987806,5,B000WNHTCC,"For Universal Horror fans, this is a five-movie collector's gem! Lugosi, Carradine, Atwill, Lon Jr., and Basil Rathbone....'nuff said! The DVD's are sharp and the sound excellent. This set is low on frills, but high on thrills! I'd describe these as ""second tier"" Shock Theatre titles. ""Rare Scares""!(I remember ""Night Monster"" being ""Shock Theatre""-televised in Chicago back in the day.).
  If you know all 5 of these films, you are an A+ Universal fan with a Ph. D in monsterology!! I knew ""Night Monster"" very well, and ""Man Made Monster"" fairly well prior to purchase...but the other three were new to me, and nice surprises. And the sound and picture quality are oustanding across the board!
  ""The Black Cat"" is a really interesting rarity---I NEVER saw it prior to buying this set. Basil Rathbone is at his best and very classy. Alan Ladd and Broderick Crawford are interesting co-stars...and there's a great and clever characterization by Bela as the creepy caretaker. To me, part ""Ygor"", part Bill Murray in ""Caddyshack"" in a strange way! (Honest!) This, of course, is a completely different movie than Bela and Boris' famous ""Black Cat"" film. Nonetheless, it has humor, creepiness, and first-rate performances. Give it a whirl!
  For GREAT Halloween (or anytime) viewing, gotta love ""Night Monster"". Bela as the butler! All he needs is the cape, and he has the entire Dracula garb! Fog, creaks, classic spooky mansion,....Love, ya', Universal! Pass the popcorn! Hmmmm...It's LUGOSI, as THE BUTLER...It's always the BUTLER who is the monster, right? Well, maybe! Maybe not!.....I won't spoil it!
  My third ""pick-to-click"" in the set is ""Man Made Monster"". What a great and engaging performance by Lon Chaney, Jr.. This is the prototype of his pre-werewolf-encounter ""likeable Larry Talbot"" screen ""presence"" and charm. There is a terrific naturalness in his role in ""Man Made Monster"". It is almost like a Chaney family home movie performance. So photogenic, and not to be missed by Chaney fans everywhere. In fact, Lon is so likeable, that once Lionel Atwill does his evil bidding, (with Chaney as victim), Atwill comes across as extra powerfully sinister and menacing. And by the way, check out supporting (and great) performances by the stars who play ""Mr. Bailey"" AND ""Sam Wainwright"" in ""It's A Wonderful Life""...Star-wise, ""Man Made Monster"" kind of resmbles ""It's A Wonderful Wolfman""! It's must-see viewing for Chaney/Atwill/Universal fans.
  ""Horror Island"" and ""Captive Wild Woman"" are eclectic and cool,too. It's pretty neat that ""Horror Island"" reunites Dick Foran and Peggy Moran who worked so well together in ""The Mummy's Hand""! All five movies are from circa 1941 or so...Gotta love 'em! Gotta have 'em!
  At about $4 per movie, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this collection. You won't be disappointed.",1285804800,5,2817,5.180616740088106
2987807,3,B000WNHTCC,"Back then they were afraid of actually making an audience afraid.  The Black Cat is not the Black Cat with Boris Karloff.  Instead it is a comedy with a poor man's Abbott and Costello team of Broderick Crawford and that guy who goes ""woo-hoo"" after his one-liners.  Reminds me of the Three Stooges episode where that skull flew around with a pigeon inside it.  Horror Island has no horror at all but maybe it will make you laugh.  The straight man is not familiar to me but ""Fuzzy Knight"" is his sidekick and the name is hardly meant to frighten anyone, nor are his ""wah-wah-waaahhhh"" stammers when he gets nervous.
Man-Made Monster and Night Monster are OK for a few bucks I guess.  Poor old Lon Chaney Jr.  Like Oliver Reed he played a lot of bum steers on the screen.  In Captive Wild Woman we learn that an Hispanic is half-way between a gorilla and a human.",1281052800,3,862,4.4113924050632916
2987808,4,B000WNHTCC,These are some of the movies I had not seen before at all even though they have well known stars like Bela Lugosi and Basil Rathbone. I primarily got it because I wanted The Black Cat. It is interesting to note that the old mansion in the Black Cat reappears in one of the other movies (Night Monster)on this DVD set. Also the background music is used again in another movie. But I like old black and white classic movies and this was pretty good for the price. I told my granddaughter that I used to watch movies like this when I was a kid and was scared by them back then. It's amazing what can be considered scary then and now.

2987810,5,B000WNHTCC,"Fans of classic black-and-white horror flicks will be notably pleased with this set. It's one of the best I've encountered in a long time. This is NOT a bunch of cheesy old movies crammed onto a less than viewable disc -- these films have truly been re-mastered and they are clear and sharp with great sound quality.

Here is a brief synopsis of each movie:

""The Black Cat"", 1941, 71 minutes, directed by Albert S. Rogell -- (This one is loosely based upon a Poe tale.) A wealthy old woman, confined to a wheelchair and in poor health, maintains her valuable estate for her innumerable cats. Her extended family, a pack of vulturous scoundrels, are close at hand and awaiting the old woman's death -- one of them chooses to expedite it. However, the old lady gets the last laugh -- following her death, the family discovers that the housekeeper (Abigail) is assigned stewardship of the property and all the money until the servant herself dies. Abigail is in for a bumpy ride from here on out.

Great writing and an ambiance of mystique, punctuated with moments of comic relief all contribute to make this rare film a real joy for nostalgic horror movie enthusiasts. The film is packed with renowned period stars including Bela Lugosi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula-Universal-Studios-Classic-Monster-Collection/dp/B000035Z3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula (Universal Studios Classic Monster Collection)</a>), Gale Sondergaard (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anna-and-the-King-1999-Anna-and-the-King-of-Siam-1946-Double-Take/dp/B00158K1C8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anna and the King (1999) / Anna and the King of Siam (1946) (Double Take)</a>, 1946 version), and Alan Ladd (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Carpetbaggers/dp/B00008CMQZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Carpetbaggers</a>.) 5 stars.

""Man Made Monster"", 1941, 60 minutes, directed by George Waggner -- Dynamo Dan runs a little sideshow at the carnival where he sticks his fingers into light sockets... until a bus he is riding in crashes into a high-voltage electric tower. Dan is the lone survivor of the crash and two local scientists (one good, one mad) take an interest in his ability to survive exposure to electric current. The mad doctor soon has Dan strapped to a table making him glow with an electrical overdose. Dan's life soon goes south and so do the lives of his victims.

This is a fine film, not awfully hokey, and a perfect vehicle for the always lamentable Lon Chaney, Jr. (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Baby/dp/B00000JN2R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider Baby</a>.) This one also co-stars Lionel Atwill (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Holmes-and-the-Secret-Weapon/dp/B0000APVBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon</a>.) 4 1/2 stars.

""Horror Island"", 1941, 61 minutes, directed by George Waggner -- A marine entrepreneur is down on his luck but he does own an old castle on a deserted island. So he decides to promote the place for its ghastly thrills coupled with a treasure hunt, based upon an old legend, by the participants.

Here we have a terrific semi-comedic romp with atmosphere which will make classic horror fans drool. I've never seen this obscure Universal entry before but I'm thrilled that I have it now -- I'll be watching it over and over. Fuzzy Knight (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cowboy-and-the-Lady-Slimcase-DVD-Starring-Gary-Cooper-and-Merle-Oberon/dp/B000USUSP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cowboy and the Lady - Slimcase DVD - Starring Gary Cooper and Merle Oberon</a>) stars. 5 stars.

""Night Monster"", 1942, 73 minutes, directed by Ford Beebe -- A rural estate is the venue for a series of mysterious murders... bloody strangulations. The old patriarch is a paraplegic with an apparent ax to grind with his physicians. The old man has also more or less branded his daughter as insane and uses that excuse to keep her held hostage in this creepy place. Pretty soon, doctors who are staying in the house begin to meet their demise. The local constable gets very little cooperation upon his arrival on the scene of the killings.

Everything from the credits fonts to the music (Hans J. Salter) to the sets, to the cinematography of this film will charm the viewer in the first three minutes of the movie. This is a notable example of superb film-making on a tight budget. Bela Lugosi's performance as the ominous butler is remarkable -- actually pretty scary! Leif Erikson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invaders-from-Mars-VHS/dp/6304401892/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invaders from Mars [VHS</a>]) also stars. 5 stars.

""Captive Wild Woman"", 1943, 61 minutes, directed by Edward Dmytryk -- A safari leader returns home with 40 aggressive lions and tigers... and a huge female ape. His girlfriend's very ill sister is being attended by a sociopathic research physician (John Carradine,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein-s-Island/dp/B000E0G8W0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein's Island</a>) who also works with animals, specifically, their glands. Do you see where this is going? Yes, the doc steals the ape and it's ""Look out sick lady!""

Lovers of wild critters will not much savor this film. The regulations regarding the treatment of animals in movies have clearly changed over the years, (along with peoples' attitude on this sensitive topic.) Otherwise, the story itself is pretty solid, if a bit far out scientifically. Co-stars include Milburn Stone (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gunsmoke-The-First-Season/dp/B000PHX5KU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gunsmoke - The First Season</a>) and Acquanetta (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jungle-Woman-VHS/dp/0783228112/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jungle Woman [VHS</a>]). 3 1/2 stars.

In summary, I can't say when I've been more pleased with a DVD set (two discs: 3 films on Disc One and 2 on Disc Two) -- this collection is superb. Highly recommended.",1274745600,6,6287,6.3489461358313815
2987811,5,B000WNHTCC,"I had been searching for a copy of NIGHT MONSTER for years on DVD but to no avail so it was great when Universal released it along with 4 other titles.  Although none of these films reached the iconic status of the legendary Universal movies that featured the Wolfman, Dracula, etc. they are nevertheless, snappy little films with enough style and substance to be very enjoyable, esp is you like the classic black & white Universal tradition of old-fashioned horror.  And the quality is surprisingly good.  Well worth the price.",1265587200,13,528,4.844444444444444
2987812,4,B000WNHTCC,"What's to say abut this 5-film set? The picture and sound quality are excellent: they look like they were made yesterday. My personal favorite, ""Night Monster"", just reeks with atmosphere -- a very dark film. A good cast helps make this an exceptional film (in my book).

Universal was quite good at taking a simple story and adding those touches only Universal could do so as to make it better than just a B film. All these films (as with most Universal horror films of the '30s and '40s) have that something extra which takes them above average.

All the films in this set are in excellent condition with appropriate music for each one. I highly recommend this set!",1260835200,2,667,4.5966386554621845
2987813,4,B000WNHTCC,"The word ""classic"" is often used almost as a synonym for ""old"", as in:  if it's old, it must be a classic.  Certainly, that is the only reason that the five movies in the Universal Horror Classic Movie Archive rate this description.  That's not to say that these are bad movies, but to put them in the same category as Univeral movies like Frankenstein or Dracula is inappropriate.

All the movies date to between 1941 and 1943.  The Black Cat (one of several movies that exist with such a title) stars Bela Lugosi and Basil Rathbone in one of those old-dark-house comedy-mysteries (along the lines of The Cat and the Canary or The Old Dark House).  This tale involves various killings to get the inheritance of a wealthy old lady.  Interestingly, Lugosi would earlier be in another movie with the same title, a generally better film that was his first teaming with Boris Karloff.

Man Made Monster has Lon Chaney has a generally nice guy turned into the slave of a mad scientist with the capability of electrocuting others.  Horror Island and Night Monster also fit into the old-dark-house genre.  In the former, Dick Foran leads treasure seekers to a castle on an island where the mysterious Phantom also hunts.  In Night Monster, a less humorous tale, the occupants of a house are prey to a mysterious killer; this one has Lugosi in a small role.

The final movie, Captive Wild Woman, treads on the ground of such movies as Island of Lost Souls, with John Carradine as a Dr. Moreau-like character who kills to transform a gorilla into a beautiful woman (played by Acquanetta, an actress of the era who is known more for her looks than her acting ability and who wisely doesn't speak here).

This collection of brief (the longest is 73 minutes) and entertaining movies adds to the completeness of any fan's set of Universal's horror films.  They may not be really be classics, but they are fun to watch.",1260748800,3,1905,4.664670658682635

2987815,5,B000WNHTCC,"My favorite of the Universal Horror Archive collection is CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN followed by MAN-MADE MONSTER and each film is enjoyable in the old-fashioned horror film fashion (no gore or slashers killing teenagers).  Make no mistake these films are not Universal's finest moments and have nothing to do with Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolf Man or mummy films.  They are from the B-movie division and are not as well known or as critically praised.  These films are relatively short (about an hour or so long) and a good way to spend an evening when there is nothing worth watching on TV.",1257292800,,582,4.858585858585859
2987816,4,B000WNHTCC,"Universal Pictures, as fans of the horror genre well know, was the leader in this type of film. I grew up on their movies when ""Shock Theatre"" debuted on WCAU-TV in Philly back in the 50s when I was in high school. (The first two films they showed were FRANKENSTEIN and DRACULA, two of my favorites to this day.) In this collection, there were only two films -- CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN and HORROR ISLAND -- that I'd never seen before, and some of the others I hadn't seen since the 50s. For fans of Universal, this set is highly recommended. And as my title for this review indicates, I hope this is just the first of many such collections. (I'd like to think that one day there will be a complete Boris Karloff set or a complete Bela Lugosi set. I'd like to hope there will never be a complete Lon Chaney, Jr., set, however!)

One thing puzzles me, though: The cover art for the inside DVD holder shows Boris Karloff from some movie in the 50s. Not only is whatever that film might be from the wrong era (the others all being from 1941-1943), but Karloff isn't even in any of the films in this set. How did this picture get included in the collage?",1255737600,4,1144,4.296296296296297

2987818,5,B000WNHTCC,"This is a great set of B horror from Universal...that you previously couldn't find anywhere unless you paid some scalper who could care less about the films three times what it is was worth. The reason? Like the Ultimate Sci-Fi Collection, this was originally a Best Buy exclusive. Finally liberated from that status, these films will now be available in a general release for all to enjoy.

Every film in this set is a great B horror classic and the audio and video are very good, not unrestored like public domain packs. My favorite - ""Captive Wild Woman"". The title has it as ""Captive Wild Women"" indicating it is possibly some kind of prison film, and nothing could be further from the truth. Instead it seems to be borrowing from Val Lewton's themes about monsters and horror mirroring the human condition. Plus, Milburn Stone (""Doc"" from Gunsmoke) is in the film! For those of you who didn't know, Stone toiled away in B horror films for years before he got his career role on TV in Gunsmoke. The Black Cat here is from 1941, not the 1934 classic scary old house tale with Karloff and Lugosi that is already on DVD, so you need not worry about double-dips on this one. Lugosi is in it, but he is more of a supporting character at this point.

Man Made Monster (1941) has Lon Chaney Jr. as the victim and Lionel Atwell as the mad scientist. I think Chaney gives one of his finest performances here - in my opinion, much better than in his ""wolf man"" films, and they weren't half bad. Horror Island is an OK film starring a bunch of people I never heard of, still the story is pretty good. Finally there is Night Monster (1942), another scary old house tale with Bela Lugosi and Lionel Atwill getting top billing yet a disappointing amount of screen time considering this. Buried in the credits you'll find Nils Asther as Agor Singh. It's a rather juicy role though Asther doesn't get much screentime. The sad part is that in the late silent era Asther had been a big star at MGM.  However, his star fell far after the advent of sound films. He was born in Denmark and raised in Sweden, and his foreign accent was a hindrance in the talkies. By 1949 he was driving a truck.",1214697600,2,2177,4.464824120603015
2987819,5,B000WNHTCC,"I bought this DVD set around Halloween 07, it was an exclusive Best Buy 2 disc DVD set and I am finally getting to it now. I've got so many horror films to catch up on! This DVD set contains five rare Universal films from the 40's. The prints are clean and there some trailers, but the best reason to buy this set is because all the films included are seeing their first DVD releases! If your a Universal fan it's a great set. I will review each film as I watch them, so I will be adding to this. The first film 'The Black Cat' is a film I had never seen. When I bought the set I thought it was the 1934 classic with Karloff and Lugosi....I'm glad it wasn't as I already have that film on the Bela Lugosi collection.......anyway..... 'The Black Cat' on this set is a murder/mystery/comedy from 1941. The film stars Basil Rathbone and Bela Lugosi in a fun supporting character. I did like this fun film full of secret passages and things that go bump in the night. The next film 'Man Made Monster' is a very good Lon Chaney Jr. film. The Third film 'Horror Island' is a misleading title as there isn't much horror going on, on this island! It's actually a mystery/comedy film that doesn't have much comedy in it either. This is the weakest of the five films on this set. I have reviewed these films on the individual release or VHS release. Please look for those releases.

The Black Cat(1941)3 1/2 Stars
Man Made Monster 4 1/4 Stars
Horror Island 2 1/4 Stars
Night Monster 4 Stars
Captive Wild Woman 3 Stars",1204156800,33,1507,4.306338028169014
2987820,4,B000WNHTCC,"I wish sets like Universal Horror Classic Movie Archive would not be specific to a chain (Best Buy for this set) since the availability tends to be too small and after they sell out the prices become ridiculous (like The Classic Sci-fi Ultimate Collection another Best Buy exclusive).  Of course, as soon as I saw this for sale I knew I needed to add it to my early horror collection.  All of these are on DVD for the first time and the transfers look quite good.  Several of these were made quite quickly like ""Man Made Monster"" and ""Horror Island"" and a couple of these like ""Captive Wild Woman"" are not really horror (though nowhere near as bad as the advertising on the ""The Boris Karloff Collection"" also on Universal), but fans of the 40's monster/horror genre are going to want (need) this on their shelf.  Now only if Universal had added some supplements.

Black Cat (1941): This movie is not a remake of the superior 1934 version nor bares resemblance to Poe's short story.  It does have two stars at that time with a fading Bela Lugosi (somewhat played against type so that is interesting) and Basil Rathbone (there is a nice little in-joke referencing him as Sherlock Holmes).  Neither is the lead though which would belong to future Academy Award winner Broderick Crawford who plays a character who wants to buy the estate.  The plot of a heiress inviting relatives over to discuss her will and subsequent death and subsequent trapping of the rest of the guests in the house (bad weather) as they slowly get killed off seems stereotypical of this genre which was similar to the ""Cat and the Canary"" films (1927 & 1939).  Gale Sondergaard who plays the maid here performs a similar role in the 1939 version (and other films). The pace is a bit slow and Hugh Herbert's performance (he plays a house and antique appraiser who is completely oblivious to everything) was vaudevillian comedy way overdone and reminds me of a more annoying Costello.  If it was toned down it could have been beneficial.  Black Cat is an OK film with nice sets and good performances by the secondary character actors.

Man Made Monster (1941): Director George Waggner was extraordinarily busy during 1940/1941 helping helm several cheap horror/suspense films like ""Man Made Monster"" until his masterpiece ""The Wolf Man"".  This film would also star the consummate commonplace common-man in Lon Chaney Jr. (still in his dad's shadow at this point; though he would not be typecast in horror until ""The Wolf Man"") who's role in this film is analogous to that of the furred fanged fury. Chaney plays Dan McCormick an oafish congenial low-rent magician who survived an electrocution (and crash) and is found by two scientists - one who wants to help him and one who wants to exploit him (Lionel Atwill).  ""Man Made Monster"" is a decent film for an extremely low budget and quickly shot (apparently three weeks according to IMDB) movie.  You have to love the glow that surrounds him as his powers grow.  This movie seems more like a sci-fi film than horror though.

Horror Island (1941): Another George Waggner horror film of 1941 that was on a double bill of ""Man Made Monster"".  The film starts with Bill Martin (Dick Foran) as a down-on-luck entrepreneur who avoids bill collectors while trying to make big on his next crazy idea.  He happens on half a map that might lead to treasure on an island he owns.  He decides to make his island/castle a tourist spot so he can make money regardless if there is treasure or not.  The first bunch he takes all seems suspicious.  Once they get to the island it then takes from Agatha Cristie's ""And Then There Were None"" (which was not that original in the first place).  Not too much interesting in this film, but nothing horrific either.  Some nice sets and situations, but everything feels rushed. This film has one of the most egregious examples of getting a crew member on film.  As the cast enters the castle and the camera pans toward the inside, a grip moving a portable light moves towards the left, gets his cord stuck on a table, points his light down and slowly moves out-of-screen after he has already hit the midpoint of the camera shot -- unintended hilarity.  This is partially because it had a 12-day shooting schedule and was released less than a month after production started.

Night Monster (1942): The plot: Dr. Lynne Harper gets summoned to Ingston Mansion to help the daughter of the invalid owner (Kurt Ingston) Margaret Ingston who thinks she is going insane because of what she sees, the murders near the house and the fact that the maid keeps cleaning up blood spots.  Meanwhile three doctors have been invited also to witness the improvement of Kurt who was left crippled because of an operation by the three (though it was not necessarily their fault).  Kurt has been using the help of a fakir Agor Singh who is tapped into the spiritual power.  Also visiting is Dick Baldwin (the protagonist) a writer who is friends with Kurt.  Soon more killings happen in the household.  Could it be the fakir, the butler Rolf (Bela Lugosi and we know the butler always does it, or does he), the misogynistic chauffer, the owner or the crazed daughter? Night Monster is an effectively directed film by Ford Beebee (director of the Bomba series and lots of sci-fi/horror `B' films) that works well for most of the movie but fails at the very end.  This is because it is obvious who the culprit is and the special effects are a bit of a let down too.  However, there are enough suspects at the beginning to keep it interesting; though, there is the age old problem that when there are murders about it would be best to leave the house.

Captive Wild Woman (1943): Dr. Sigmund Walters (Universal hammy horror stalwart John Carradine) is an endocrinologist who tampers with science and transforms a female ape to a human (played by Acquanetta, yes that is her name probably influence by the hair spray) with borrowed glands from other females.  While the direction by Edward Dmytryk, who would later helm the excellent Caine Mutiny (1954) is solid, and the acting is decent, the plot is `b' level entertainment that is ridiculous (typical Universal Horror film of the time).  There is a plethora of stock footage featuring a real lion tamer that outdoes the rest of the action in this movie. I cannot believe they made two sequels to this film (which I have not seen): Jungle Woman (1944) with Acquanetta reprising her role and The Jungle Captive (1945) with Vicky Lane as the ape girl.  Once again this proves that sequels are nothing new.",1194393600,94,6576,4.705933682373473

3222249,5,B000WNHTCC,"Very good collection of early 40's black-and-white Universal horror films.

The Black Cat (1941) A bunch of mercenary heirs gather at a the mansion of their elderly relative to hear about what their take is going to be.  The old lady is a cat collector (a hoarder, today).  An antiques dealer and his destructive assistant show up to see what they can lay their hands on.  They are supposed to be the comedy relief in this flick.  They made me cringe.  I hate to see any beautiful old mansion gutted and destroyed and the assistant trashes vases and chairs, believing that will increase the antique's value.  Ouch.  Well, aside from that, the film isn't bad.  Someone off's the old lady and the antique dealer runs rampant, trying to solve the mystery.

Man Made Monster (1941) A carnival worker survives a bus crash where everyone else was electrocuted.  Due to his natural resistance to electricity he lives.  He is invited to live temporarily in the house of a kindly scientist so he can be examined.  What the good doctor doesn't realize is that his off-the-rails assistant has his own warped agenda.

Horror Island (1941) My favorite of this set.  Three sailors, who are always looking for a get-rich-quick scheme inherit an island with a castle and a rumored treasure hidden there.  They decide to set up a ""Spend a Weekend at a Haunted Castle"" tour for gullible tourists but end up with more than they can handle.  Moves quickly and is great fun.

Night Monster (1942) My second favorite of this set.  A reclusive, crippled millionaire invites the three doctors who treated him to his mansion to witness a new, supposedly healing technique.  Along for the weekend are a local novelist, a female psychiatrist, a lecherous chauffer, a lurking butler, a creepy gate-keeper, a Mrs. Danvers-type housekeeper, a supposedly mentally ill sister, a knows-more-than-is-good-for-her maid, and a Hindu mentalist.  There are also mysterious killings going on in the vicinity.  Irene Hervey as the psychiatrist is refreshingly liberated in a non-threatening way for the 40's.  Very good and at times very atmospheric and spooky.

Captive Wild Woman (1943)  A mad doctor (a very good John Carradine in his younger days) through unscrupulous experiments transforms a gorilla into a murderous beautiful woman.
The quality of all the films is super-excellent.  Highly, highly recommended.",1453507200,,2377,5.030769230769231

3222253,3,B000WNHTCC,"3 Hits, 2 Misses and a modest ""thumbs up"" if you are a fan of the genre and Universal. ""Horror Island"" is fairly amusing and goofy fun once they actually get to the island 25 minutes in. Stars Dick Foran and Peggy Moran (whom also starred together in ""The Mummy's Tomb""). ""The Black Cat"" has an impressive cast: Rathbone, Ladd, Gayle Sondergaard, and a young and surprisingly energetic Broderick Crawford slicing the ham thick in a more upscale version of Universal's ""B"" horror staples from the era. Then ""Night Monster"" with a small part for Bela Lugosi and a young and beefy Leif Erickson playing a heel. It's fun and standard fare but suffers from a dumb ending. Those 3 are the hits, with ""The Black Cat"" being the best of the lot.
""Man Made Monster"" stars Lon Cheney Jr, if ""stars"" is stretched to the point of absurdity. Lionel Atwell does his best to be the evil mad scientist and make things interesting, it's at best a lukewarm ""OK"". Then we have the absurd, horrible and complete waste of celluloid and
the viewer's time ""Captive Wild Woman"". It's lame, it's boring, it's completely out of place in a set with 3 ""scary dark house"" movies and 1 similar: mostly it's Milburne Stone pretending to be Clyde Beatty with about 1/3 of the movie being the ACTUAL Clyde Beatty and his circus in Second Unit shots. Just a really bad movie.
If you are a fan of Universal's ""B"" movies from this era (early 40's), you will probably like this set. For $15 Prime it's not a bad deal. However if you do not have the Universal Monsters sets I would strongly suggest you apply the $15 (or $20 non-Prime) for those collections of OUTSTANDING movies as they are far far move enjoyable and while more expense they have the distinct advantage of being WORTH IT!",1442016000,,1750,4.541139240506329

Next is the Man Made Monster, very good with great acting by Lionel Atwill, Anne Nager and a great job by Lon Chaney, JR. Horror Island is next and this is one of the best of the five with some great humor. The best one of all is next, Night Monster with many great actors of the time. Last is Captive Wild Woman.

I've got so many horror films to catch up on! This DVD set contains five rare Universal films from the 40's. The prints are clean and there are some trailers, but the best reason to buy this set is because all the films included are seeing their first DVD releases!

If your a Universal fan it's a great set. I will review each film as I watch them, so I will be adding to this. The first film 'The Black Cat' is a film I had never seen. When I bought the set I thought it was the 1934 classic with Karloff and Lugosi....I'm glad it wasn't as I already have that film on the Bela Lugosi collection.......anyway..... 'The Black Cat' on this set is a murder/mystery/comedy from 1941. The film stars Basil Rathbone and Bela Lugosi in a fun supporting character. I did like this fun film full of secret passages and things that go bump in the night. The next film 'Man Made Monster' is a very good Lon Chaney Jr. film. The Third film 'Horror Island' is a misleading title as there isn't much horror going on, on this island! It's actually a mystery/comedy film that doesn't have much comedy in it either. This is the weakest of the five films on this set. I have reviewed these films on the individual release or VHS release. Please look for those releases.

The b/w film has so much potential to enhance the mood and setting that, if you are a ""color only"" fan, you might be converted to b/w on the spot. From our sophisticated 21st century view of life, with its realism and vacuous values, the high entertainment value of these films will fill in whatever distorted view of the past you might be harboring with all the life-changing events of the 1940s that charged the minds of people to break away from WW II blues and escape into the celuloid fantasy of the moment.

3222295,1,B000WNHTCC,"I ordered this set not too long ago but I ended up having to return it. There are two discs here of some fair to good horror flicks from various years of long ago from Universal. I made a quick view of the first three flicks and was shocked at how terribly poor Universal had released these flicks onto DVD.They were in disappointing condition with much dirt and other built in defects,along with a heavy dose of graininess.
However,one cannot just return something because it looks poor. No,what really got me was the major flaw in the first film The Black Cat. I have always had a soft spot for this campy cult classic but the flaw in question happens as the old lady starts to read her will. She looks down at the paper and at this point the printing/transfer machine closes in on her and the film slows down. Immediately after you can see the film trying to speed back up and trying to sink the lips to the words being spoken. I thought this very odd,so I dug out my VHS copy and looked at the same scene. In the same scene on the VHS,the camera doesn't move in at all but the film does have a defect(a film emulsion crack)which passes quickly. So it seems Universal in this DVD release tried to hide the fact it was just releasing this film onto DVD using the same old print used on the VHS version;and on top of that trying to hide the defect which would have given it all away!
The condition of the films in general was bad enough but this ""deception"" was the straw that broke this camels back. And I would urge you to give this DVD set a wide pass. One should expect and get better than Universal gives us here.",1344124800,3,1619,4.259740259740259

 The Black Cat is a comedy whodunnit. Not to be confused with the classic Karloff Lugosi. It stars Basil Rathbone and Broderick Crawford. It is fun to watch if only too see Gayle Sondergard and Bela Lugosi in roles as servants.
Man Made Monster Stars Lionell Atwill and a (pre Wolfman) Lon Chaney jr. This one directed by George Waggner.
Horror Island is the weakest in this series.
Night Monster is a guilty pleasure I love the cast and Ford Beebe is the director. I have watched it several times since recieving the set and it is a joy.
Captive Wild Woman is the first in a series by Universal and stars John Carradine, Evelyn Ankers and Acquanetta in the story of an ape transformed into a human women. Great fun!

A very poor investment.",1288224000,,549,5.066666666666666
3222303,5,B000WNHTCC,"For Universal Horror fans, this is a five-movie collector's gem! Lugosi, Carradine, Atwill, Lon Jr., and Basil Rathbone....'nuff said! The DVD's are sharp and the sound excellent. This set is low on frills, but high on thrills! I'd describe these as ""second tier"" Shock Theatre titles. ""Rare Scares""!(I remember ""Night Monster"" being ""Shock Theatre""-televised in Chicago back in the day.).
  If you know all 5 of these films, you are an A+ Universal fan with a Ph. D in monsterology!! I knew ""Night Monster"" very well, and ""Man Made Monster"" fairly well prior to purchase...but the other three were new to me, and nice surprises. And the sound and picture quality are oustanding across the board!
  ""The Black Cat"" is a really interesting rarity---I NEVER saw it prior to buying this set. Basil Rathbone is at his best and very classy. Alan Ladd and Broderick Crawford are interesting co-stars...and there's a great and clever characterization by Bela as the creepy caretaker. To me, part ""Ygor"", part Bill Murray in ""Caddyshack"" in a strange way! (Honest!) This, of course, is a completely different movie than Bela and Boris' famous ""Black Cat"" film. Nonetheless, it has humor, creepiness, and first-rate performances. Give it a whirl!
  For GREAT Halloween (or anytime) viewing, gotta love ""Night Monster"". Bela as the butler! All he needs is the cape, and he has the entire Dracula garb! Fog, creaks, classic spooky mansion,....Love, ya', Universal! Pass the popcorn! Hmmmm...It's LUGOSI, as THE BUTLER...It's always the BUTLER who is the monster, right? Well, maybe! Maybe not!.....I won't spoil it!
  My third ""pick-to-click"" in the set is ""Man Made Monster"". What a great and engaging performance by Lon Chaney, Jr.. This is the prototype of his pre-werewolf-encounter ""likeable Larry Talbot"" screen ""presence"" and charm. There is a terrific naturalness in his role in ""Man Made Monster"". It is almost like a Chaney family home movie performance. So photogenic, and not to be missed by Chaney fans everywhere. In fact, Lon is so likeable, that once Lionel Atwill does his evil bidding, (with Chaney as victim), Atwill comes across as extra powerfully sinister and menacing. And by the way, check out supporting (and great) performances by the stars who play ""Mr. Bailey"" AND ""Sam Wainwright"" in ""It's A Wonderful Life""...Star-wise, ""Man Made Monster"" kind of resmbles ""It's A Wonderful Wolfman""! It's must-see viewing for Chaney/Atwill/Universal fans.
  ""Horror Island"" and ""Captive Wild Woman"" are eclectic and cool,too. It's pretty neat that ""Horror Island"" reunites Dick Foran and Peggy Moran who worked so well together in ""The Mummy's Hand""! All five movies are from circa 1941 or so...Gotta love 'em! Gotta have 'em!
  At about $4 per movie, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this collection. You won't be disappointed.",1285804800,5,2817,5.180616740088106
3222304,3,B000WNHTCC,"Back then they were afraid of actually making an audience afraid.  The Black Cat is not the Black Cat with Boris Karloff.  Instead it is a comedy with a poor man's Abbott and Costello team of Broderick Crawford and that guy who goes ""woo-hoo"" after his one-liners.  Reminds me of the Three Stooges episode where that skull flew around with a pigeon inside it.  Horror Island has no horror at all but maybe it will make you laugh.  The straight man is not familiar to me but ""Fuzzy Knight"" is his sidekick and the name is hardly meant to frighten anyone, nor are his ""wah-wah-waaahhhh"" stammers when he gets nervous.
Man-Made Monster and Night Monster are OK for a few bucks I guess.  Poor old Lon Chaney Jr.  Like Oliver Reed he played a lot of bum steers on the screen.  In Captive Wild Woman we learn that an Hispanic is half-way between a gorilla and a human.",1281052800,3,862,4.4113924050632916

I primarily got it because I wanted The Black Cat. It is interesting to note that the old mansion in the Black Cat reappears in one of the other movies (Night Monster)on this DVD set. Also the background music is used again in another movie. But I like old black and white classic movies and this was pretty good for the price. I told my granddaughter that I used to watch movies like this when I was a kid and was scared by them back then. It's amazing what can be considered scary then and now.

3222307,5,B000WNHTCC,"Fans of classic black-and-white horror flicks will be notably pleased with this set. It's one of the best I've encountered in a long time. This is NOT a bunch of cheesy old movies crammed onto a less than viewable disc -- these films have truly been re-mastered and they are clear and sharp with great sound quality.

Here is a brief synopsis of each movie:

""The Black Cat"", 1941, 71 minutes, directed by Albert S. Rogell -- (This one is loosely based upon a Poe tale.) A wealthy old woman, confined to a wheelchair and in poor health, maintains her valuable estate for her innumerable cats. Her extended family, a pack of vulturous scoundrels, are close at hand and awaiting the old woman's death -- one of them chooses to expedite it. However, the old lady gets the last laugh -- following her death, the family discovers that the housekeeper (Abigail) is assigned stewardship of the property and all the money until the servant herself dies. Abigail is in for a bumpy ride from here on out.

Great writing and an ambiance of mystique, punctuated with moments of comic relief all contribute to make this rare film a real joy for nostalgic horror movie enthusiasts. The film is packed with renowned period stars including Bela Lugosi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula-Universal-Studios-Classic-Monster-Collection/dp/B000035Z3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula (Universal Studios Classic Monster Collection)</a>), Gale Sondergaard (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anna-and-the-King-1999-Anna-and-the-King-of-Siam-1946-Double-Take/dp/B00158K1C8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anna and the King (1999) / Anna and the King of Siam (1946) (Double Take)</a>, 1946 version), and Alan Ladd (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Carpetbaggers/dp/B00008CMQZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Carpetbaggers</a>.) 5 stars.

""Man Made Monster"", 1941, 60 minutes, directed by George Waggner -- Dynamo Dan runs a little sideshow at the carnival where he sticks his fingers into light sockets... until a bus he is riding in crashes into a high-voltage electric tower. Dan is the lone survivor of the crash and two local scientists (one good, one mad) take an interest in his ability to survive exposure to electric current. The mad doctor soon has Dan strapped to a table making him glow with an electrical overdose. Dan's life soon goes south and so do the lives of his victims.

This is a fine film, not awfully hokey, and a perfect vehicle for the always lamentable Lon Chaney, Jr. (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Baby/dp/B00000JN2R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider Baby</a>.) This one also co-stars Lionel Atwill (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Holmes-and-the-Secret-Weapon/dp/B0000APVBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon</a>.) 4 1/2 stars.

""Horror Island"", 1941, 61 minutes, directed by George Waggner -- A marine entrepreneur is down on his luck but he does own an old castle on a deserted island. So he decides to promote the place for its ghastly thrills coupled with a treasure hunt, based upon an old legend, by the participants.

Here we have a terrific semi-comedic romp with atmosphere which will make classic horror fans drool. I've never seen this obscure Universal entry before but I'm thrilled that I have it now -- I'll be watching it over and over. Fuzzy Knight (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cowboy-and-the-Lady-Slimcase-DVD-Starring-Gary-Cooper-and-Merle-Oberon/dp/B000USUSP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cowboy and the Lady - Slimcase DVD - Starring Gary Cooper and Merle Oberon</a>) stars. 5 stars.

""Night Monster"", 1942, 73 minutes, directed by Ford Beebe -- A rural estate is the venue for a series of mysterious murders... bloody strangulations. The old patriarch is a paraplegic with an apparent ax to grind with his physicians. The old man has also more or less branded his daughter as insane and uses that excuse to keep her held hostage in this creepy place. Pretty soon, doctors who are staying in the house begin to meet their demise. The local constable gets very little cooperation upon his arrival on the scene of the killings.

Everything from the credits fonts to the music (Hans J. Salter) to the sets, to the cinematography of this film will charm the viewer in the first three minutes of the movie. This is a notable example of superb film-making on a tight budget. Bela Lugosi's performance as the ominous butler is remarkable -- actually pretty scary! Leif Erikson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invaders-from-Mars-VHS/dp/6304401892/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invaders from Mars [VHS</a>]) also stars. 5 stars.

""Captive Wild Woman"", 1943, 61 minutes, directed by Edward Dmytryk -- A safari leader returns home with 40 aggressive lions and tigers... and a huge female ape. His girlfriend's very ill sister is being attended by a sociopathic research physician (John Carradine,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein-s-Island/dp/B000E0G8W0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein's Island</a>) who also works with animals, specifically, their glands. Do you see where this is going? Yes, the doc steals the ape and it's ""Look out sick lady!""

Lovers of wild critters will not much savor this film. The regulations regarding the treatment of animals in movies have clearly changed over the years, (along with peoples' attitude on this sensitive topic.) Otherwise, the story itself is pretty solid, if a bit far out scientifically. Co-stars include Milburn Stone (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gunsmoke-The-First-Season/dp/B000PHX5KU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gunsmoke - The First Season</a>) and Acquanetta (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jungle-Woman-VHS/dp/0783228112/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jungle Woman [VHS</a>]). 3 1/2 stars.

3222308,5,B000WNHTCC,"I had been searching for a copy of NIGHT MONSTER for years on DVD but to no avail so it was great when Universal released it along with 4 other titles.  Although none of these films reached the iconic status of the legendary Universal movies that featured the Wolfman, Dracula, etc. they are nevertheless, snappy little films with enough style and substance to be very enjoyable, esp is you like the classic black & white Universal tradition of old-fashioned horror.  And the quality is surprisingly good.  Well worth the price.",1265587200,13,528,4.844444444444444
3222309,4,B000WNHTCC,"What's to say abut this 5-film set? The picture and sound quality are excellent: they look like they were made yesterday. My personal favorite, ""Night Monster"", just reeks with atmosphere -- a very dark film. A good cast helps make this an exceptional film (in my book).

Universal was quite good at taking a simple story and adding those touches only Universal could do so as to make it better than just a B film. All these films (as with most Universal horror films of the '30s and '40s) have that something extra which takes them above average.

All the films in this set are in excellent condition with appropriate music for each one. I highly recommend this set!",1260835200,2,667,4.5966386554621845
3222310,4,B000WNHTCC,"The word ""classic"" is often used almost as a synonym for ""old"", as in:  if it's old, it must be a classic.  Certainly, that is the only reason that the five movies in the Universal Horror Classic Movie Archive rate this description.  That's not to say that these are bad movies, but to put them in the same category as Univeral movies like Frankenstein or Dracula is inappropriate.

All the movies date to between 1941 and 1943.  The Black Cat (one of several movies that exist with such a title) stars Bela Lugosi and Basil Rathbone in one of those old-dark-house comedy-mysteries (along the lines of The Cat and the Canary or The Old Dark House).  This tale involves various killings to get the inheritance of a wealthy old lady.  Interestingly, Lugosi would earlier be in another movie with the same title, a generally better film that was his first teaming with Boris Karloff.

Man Made Monster has Lon Chaney has a generally nice guy turned into the slave of a mad scientist with the capability of electrocuting others.  Horror Island and Night Monster also fit into the old-dark-house genre.  In the former, Dick Foran leads treasure seekers to a castle on an island where the mysterious Phantom also hunts.  In Night Monster, a less humorous tale, the occupants of a house are prey to a mysterious killer; this one has Lugosi in a small role.

The final movie, Captive Wild Woman, treads on the ground of such movies as Island of Lost Souls, with John Carradine as a Dr. Moreau-like character who kills to transform a gorilla into a beautiful woman (played by Acquanetta, an actress of the era who is known more for her looks than her acting ability and who wisely doesn't speak here).

This collection of brief (the longest is 73 minutes) and entertaining movies adds to the completeness of any fan's set of Universal's horror films.  They may not be really be classics, but they are fun to watch.",1260748800,3,1905,4.664670658682635

3222312,5,B000WNHTCC,"My favorite of the Universal Horror Archive collection is CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN followed by MAN-MADE MONSTER and each film is enjoyable in the old-fashioned horror film fashion (no gore or slashers killing teenagers).  Make no mistake these films are not Universal's finest moments and have nothing to do with Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolf Man or mummy films.  They are from the B-movie division and are not as well known or as critically praised.  These films are relatively short (about an hour or so long) and a good way to spend an evening when there is nothing worth watching on TV.",1257292800,,582,4.858585858585859
3222313,4,B000WNHTCC,"Universal Pictures, as fans of the horror genre well know, was the leader in this type of film. I grew up on their movies when ""Shock Theatre"" debuted on WCAU-TV in Philly back in the 50s when I was in high school. (The first two films they showed were FRANKENSTEIN and DRACULA, two of my favorites to this day.) In this collection, there were only two films -- CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN and HORROR ISLAND -- that I'd never seen before, and some of the others I hadn't seen since the 50s. For fans of Universal, this set is highly recommended. And as my title for this review indicates, I hope this is just the first of many such collections. (I'd like to think that one day there will be a complete Boris Karloff set or a complete Bela Lugosi set. I'd like to hope there will never be a complete Lon Chaney, Jr., set, however!)

One thing puzzles me, though: The cover art for the inside DVD holder shows Boris Karloff from some movie in the 50s. Not only is whatever that film might be from the wrong era (the others all being from 1941-1943), but Karloff isn't even in any of the films in this set.

3222315,5,B000WNHTCC,"This is a great set of B horror from Universal...that you previously couldn't find anywhere unless you paid some scalper who could care less about the films three times what it is was worth. The reason? Like the Ultimate Sci-Fi Collection, this was originally a Best Buy exclusive. Finally liberated from that status, these films will now be available in a general release for all to enjoy.

Every film in this set is a great B horror classic and the audio and video are very good, not unrestored like public domain packs. My favorite - ""Captive Wild Woman"". The title has it as ""Captive Wild Women"" indicating it is possibly some kind of prison film, and nothing could be further from the truth. Instead it seems to be borrowing from Val Lewton's themes about monsters and horror mirroring the human condition. Plus, Milburn Stone (""Doc"" from Gunsmoke) is in the film! For those of you who didn't know, Stone toiled away in B horror films for years before he got his career role on TV in Gunsmoke. The Black Cat here is from 1941, not the 1934 classic scary old house tale with Karloff and Lugosi that is already on DVD, so you need not worry about double-dips on this one. Lugosi is in it, but he is more of a supporting character at this point.

Man Made Monster (1941) has Lon Chaney Jr. as the victim and Lionel Atwell as the mad scientist. I think Chaney gives one of his finest performances here - in my opinion, much better than in his ""wolf man"" films, and they weren't half bad. Horror Island is an OK film starring a bunch of people I never heard of, still the story is pretty good. Finally there is Night Monster (1942), another scary old house tale with Bela Lugosi and Lionel Atwill getting top billing yet a disappointing amount of screen time considering this. Buried in the credits you'll find Nils Asther as Agor Singh. It's a rather juicy role though Asther doesn't get much screentime. The sad part is that in the late silent era Asther had been a big star at MGM.  However, his star fell far after the advent of sound films. He was born in Denmark and raised in Sweden, and his foreign accent was a hindrance in the talkies. By 1949 he was driving a truck.",1214697600,2,2177,4.464824120603015
3222316,5,B000WNHTCC,"I bought this DVD set around Halloween 07, it was an exclusive Best Buy 2 disc DVD set and I am finally getting to it now. I've got so many horror films to catch up on! This DVD set contains five rare Universal films from the 40's. The prints are clean and there some trailers, but the best reason to buy this set is because all the films included are seeing their first DVD releases! If your a Universal fan it's a great set. I will review each film as I watch them, so I will be adding to this. The first film 'The Black Cat' is a film I had never seen. When I bought the set I thought it was the 1934 classic with Karloff and Lugosi....I'm glad it wasn't as I already have that film on the Bela Lugosi collection.......anyway..... 'The Black Cat' on this set is a murder/mystery/comedy from 1941. The film stars Basil Rathbone and Bela Lugosi in a fun supporting character. I did like this fun film full of secret passages and things that go bump in the night. The next film 'Man Made Monster' is a very good Lon Chaney Jr. film. The Third film 'Horror Island' is a misleading title as there isn't much horror going on, on this island! It's actually a mystery/comedy film that doesn't have much comedy in it either. This is the weakest of the five films on this set. I have reviewed these films on the individual release or VHS release. Please look for those releases.

The Black Cat(1941)3 1/2 Stars
Man Made Monster 4 1/4 Stars
Horror Island 2 1/4 Stars
Night Monster 4 Stars
Captive Wild Woman 3 Stars",1204156800,33,1507,4.306338028169014
3222317,4,B000WNHTCC,"I wish sets like Universal Horror Classic Movie Archive would not be specific to a chain (Best Buy for this set) since the availability tends to be too small and after they sell out the prices become ridiculous (like The Classic Sci-fi Ultimate Collection another Best Buy exclusive).  Of course, as soon as I saw this for sale I knew I needed to add it to my early horror collection.  All of these are on DVD for the first time and the transfers look quite good.  Several of these were made quite quickly like ""Man Made Monster"" and ""Horror Island"" and a couple of these like ""Captive Wild Woman"" are not really horror (though nowhere near as bad as the advertising on the ""The Boris Karloff Collection"" also on Universal), but fans of the 40's monster/horror genre are going to want (need) this on their shelf.  Now only if Universal had added some supplements.

Black Cat (1941): This movie is not a remake of the superior 1934 version nor bares resemblance to Poe's short story.  It does have two stars at that time with a fading Bela Lugosi (somewhat played against type so that is interesting) and Basil Rathbone (there is a nice little in-joke referencing him as Sherlock Holmes).  Neither is the lead though which would belong to future Academy Award winner Broderick Crawford who plays a character who wants to buy the estate.  The plot of a heiress inviting relatives over to discuss her will and subsequent death and subsequent trapping of the rest of the guests in the house (bad weather) as they slowly get killed off seems stereotypical of this genre which was similar to the ""Cat and the Canary"" films (1927 & 1939).  Gale Sondergaard who plays the maid here performs a similar role in the 1939 version (and other films). The pace is a bit slow and Hugh Herbert's performance (he plays a house and antique appraiser who is completely oblivious to everything) was vaudevillian comedy way overdone and reminds me of a more annoying Costello.  If it was toned down it could have been beneficial.  Black Cat is an OK film with nice sets and good performances by the secondary character actors.

Man Made Monster (1941): Director George Waggner was extraordinarily busy during 1940/1941 helping helm several cheap horror/suspense films like ""Man Made Monster"" until his masterpiece ""The Wolf Man"".  This film would also star the consummate commonplace common-man in Lon Chaney Jr. (still in his dad's shadow at this point; though he would not be typecast in horror until ""The Wolf Man"") who's role in this film is analogous to that of the furred fanged fury. Chaney plays Dan McCormick an oafish congenial low-rent magician who survived an electrocution (and crash) and is found by two scientists - one who wants to help him and one who wants to exploit him (Lionel Atwill).  ""Man Made Monster"" is a decent film for an extremely low budget and quickly shot (apparently three weeks according to IMDB) movie.  You have to love the glow that surrounds him as his powers grow.  This movie seems more like a sci-fi film than horror though.

Horror Island (1941): Another George Waggner horror film of 1941 that was on a double bill of ""Man Made Monster"".  The film starts with Bill Martin (Dick Foran) as a down-on-luck entrepreneur who avoids bill collectors while trying to make big on his next crazy idea.  He happens on half a map that might lead to treasure on an island he owns.  He decides to make his island/castle a tourist spot so he can make money regardless if there is treasure or not.  The first bunch he takes all seems suspicious.  Once they get to the island it then takes from Agatha Cristie's ""And Then There Were None"" (which was not that original in the first place).  Not too much interesting in this film, but nothing horrific either.  Some nice sets and situations, but everything feels rushed. This film has one of the most egregious examples of getting a crew member on film.  As the cast enters the castle and the camera pans toward the inside, a grip moving a portable light moves towards the left, gets his cord stuck on a table, points his light down and slowly moves out-of-screen after he has already hit the midpoint of the camera shot -- unintended hilarity.  This is partially because it had a 12-day shooting schedule and was released less than a month after production started.

Night Monster (1942): The plot: Dr. Lynne Harper gets summoned to Ingston Mansion to help the daughter of the invalid owner (Kurt Ingston) Margaret Ingston who thinks she is going insane because of what she sees, the murders near the house and the fact that the maid keeps cleaning up blood spots.  Meanwhile three doctors have been invited also to witness the improvement of Kurt who was left crippled because of an operation by the three (though it was not necessarily their fault).  Kurt has been using the help of a fakir Agor Singh who is tapped into the spiritual power.  Also visiting is Dick Baldwin (the protagonist) a writer who is friends with Kurt.  Soon more killings happen in the household.  Could it be the fakir, the butler Rolf (Bela Lugosi and we know the butler always does it, or does he), the misogynistic chauffer, the owner or the crazed daughter? Night Monster is an effectively directed film by Ford Beebee (director of the Bomba series and lots of sci-fi/horror `B' films) that works well for most of the movie but fails at the very end.  This is because it is obvious who the culprit is and the special effects are a bit of a let down too.  However, there are enough suspects at the beginning to keep it interesting; though, there is the age old problem that when there are murders about it would be best to leave the house.

Captive Wild Woman (1943): Dr. Sigmund Walters (Universal hammy horror stalwart John Carradine) is an endocrinologist who tampers with science and transforms a female ape to a human (played by Acquanetta, yes that is her name probably influence by the hair spray) with borrowed glands from other females.  While the direction by Edward Dmytryk, who would later helm the excellent Caine Mutiny (1954) is solid, and the acting is decent, the plot is `b' level entertainment that is ridiculous (typical Universal Horror film of the time).  There is a plethora of stock footage featuring a real lion tamer that outdoes the rest of the action in this movie. I cannot believe they made two sequels to this film (which I have not seen): Jungle Woman (1944) with Acquanetta reprising her role and The Jungle Captive (1945) with Vicky Lane as the ape girl.  Once again this proves that sequels are nothing new.",1194393600,94,6576,4.705933682373473
3222318,5,B000WNHTCC,"This is a great DVD set.  I really enjoyed these films.  Anyone who enjoys a good Halloween scare will get a kick out of some of these super scary oldies!  Man Made Monster is a hoot, and The Black Cat is one of my favorite Lugosi films.  I love the fact that we've finally got Horror Island on DVD....it's about time!

My only hope is that Universal will continue to release these oldies on DVD!

Word has it that there are more collections coming, but these are getting hard to find.  Def. worth picking up if you get the chance!

Happy Halloween!",1191542400,7,549,4.313725490196078

If you like old time 40s horror movies, I think you're really going to enjoy this set!  ""Man Made Monster"" is a classic!

This is a rare set and hard to find...I had a hard time finding my copy.

Worth spending the money if you can swing it.  One of the best collections to come out this Halloween!",1191542400,2,376,4.225352112676056
3222320,5,B000WNHTCC,"This collection of five Universal films aren't classics, but every one is fun, with good production values. And note that ""The Black Cat"" is NOT the 1934 Lugosi/Karloff film, but a 1941 film with Lugosi, Basil Rathbone, Gale Sondergaard, Broderick Crawford, Anne Gwynne, and Hugh Herbert!  If those names mean anything to you, you'll really love this set. Other actors include John Carradine, Lionel Atwill, Lon Chaney Jr, Evelyn Ankers, and many more. For $17 as a Best Buy exclusive, that's only 3 1/2 bucks a movie. Picture quality is pristine, and they're even closed captioned.

3222321,2,B000WNHTCC,"First off, don't pay the scalpers prices, best Buy had like 15 of these on the shelf for $17 today.

second...Poor choice of movie mix for this collection. Common sense would say Captive Wild Women should have been a 4 pack with Jungle Woman, Jungle Captive and Monster and the Girl.

Certainly Night Monster and Man Made Monster are fantastic, must see flicks, but really now they should have been packaged with Mad Ghoul, House of Horrors, Murders in the Zoo and Island Of Lost Souls.

A hit/miss package which obviously didn't have much thought put into it's content. I find that odd seeing how well a job Universal did packaging up their classic monsters series. I give 2 stars due to poor choice of movies in this collection.",1191369600,33,730,4.6434108527131785

8224423,4,B000WNHTCC,"This set really gets to four stars on the basis of ""Man Made Monster"" alone. MMM is one of Universal's best monster movies from the 1940s and that's really saying  a lot. You've got Lon Jr. as the sad man-turned monster (a kind of practice run for ""The Wolf Man"") and Lionel Atwill as a mad scientist. What more can you ask for? The rest of the movies are entertaining enough. I mean, they're Universal monster movies. One question I have is why Universal never released a ""Captive Wild Woman"" box set. They made three of those things back in the day. Do they even know they had another franchise? Probably not.",1477353600,,611,4.455357142857143
