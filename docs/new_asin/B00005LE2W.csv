8074737,5,B00005LE2W,I grew up in the 1980s with Marielitos exiled children.  They told me the horrors of communist Cuba. When I saw this movie it was like I was being retold the whole story again but now in graphic form.  I know the Cuban revolution did good and bad things but I highly recommend this movie because you always need to see the two sides of any story.,1438387200,,346,4.149253731343284
8074738,1,B00005LE2W,"This movie looked great and I purchased a rental of it, only to find that there are no English subtitles. This was particularly ridiculous since the English translation of the title is prominent in the ad. Amazon quickly credited me the rental amount, but I notice that no note has been placed on the item on the website warning non-Spanish speaking customers of the problem.",1329868800,2,375,4.7846153846153845

8074740,5,B00005LE2W,"Oscar Torre delivers a gritty, outstanding performance in the indie film, ""Libertad."" The movie follows the desperate quest of a young man who risks his life and endures tortue to escape the regime of Fidel Castro's Cuba. Being an artist who's suspected of being a pawn for the CIA, Fidel's force imprisons and uses oppressive tactics to break his spirit and physically abuses him.

The artist is finally able to attempt to make his way to freedom to the U.S. as part of the rafters. The journey is short by miles, but long on human pain and test of spirit. I loved that ""Libertad"" is not only a heartfelt story about humanity, but also a thriller, which keeps you guessing to the end if it will end in triumph or tagedy.",1328572800,2,721,4.5038167938931295
