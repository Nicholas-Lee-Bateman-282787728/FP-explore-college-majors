and they are a great family value. Thank you so much.",1294963200,2,153,4.310344827586207
3659626,5,B001JSCMM6,"Classic --  movies of this simplicity and style are hard to find

I watched this movie, my children have watched these movies, and now I am purchasing for my grandson. I remember our children watching the original Benji over and over, never tiring of the special way Benji visited the townspeople.",1284163200,2,297,4.803921568627451
3659627,4,B001JSCMM6,My dog is always mistaken for Benji so I thought that we would all enjoy watching a sleepover marathon watching Benji! For us older fans there are plenty of suprises in the films. Great family fun.,1281225600,3,197,4.5
3659628,4,B001JSCMM6,"This is a good, clean movie for the whole family to enjoy. We wanted to add it to our dvd library. Since we are pet owners, it is something we enjoy watching.",1271289600,3,158,3.96875
3659629,5,B001JSCMM6,"We really enjoy having all 4 Benji movies in one set.  My son has been playing ""Benji"" with his stuffed dog since he started watching the movies. These movies are never out of date for good family entertainement that everyone enjoys.",1230076800,8,233,4.682926829268292
3659630,5,B001JSCMM6,Great gift for my granddaughter.,1418774400,,32,5.6
3659631,5,B001JSCMM6,I am such a huge Benji fan. I have watched those movies many times in my life. I purchased this DVD collection for my 10 years old daughter this time. she loved all the movie very much! I highly recommended Benji movie for any dog lovers!,1386979200,4,238,4.195652173913044
3659632,5,B001JSCMM6,these movies do not have features with them but the audio and video are good.  my nephews and niece love this.,1382400000,,110,4.238095238095238
3659633,5,B001JSCMM6,"I saw the first benji movie when it was in the theater in '.74 and I was only 8. I just found this set a couple days ago. Great to see again. Sweet and funny. Highly recommend for family movie lovers Regarding two other reviewers, some of the story lines could be seen as ""intense"" by some parents (animal neglect, kidnapping, verbal abuse toward a child) but really, people? These stories all have happy endings where the good guy wins and ultimately Benji is the hero. Don't mean to spoiler anything but criticizing this set is like criticizing Cinderella because the wicked stepmother made her scrub floors all day. Give Benji a break",1382140800,5,637,4.646017699115045
3659634,5,B001JSCMM6,"This is a very good movie. I am hoping to find other Benji's. I once had a full collection. I rate this as high as possible. If you like family movies this is one to watch. Get it,enjoy it and write your own revies. thanks.",1334966400,7,223,3.977777777777778
3659635,5,B001JSCMM6,Arrived very quickly and was in excellent condition.  I would definitely suggest the family watching these movies - they are really wonderful!,1331251200,,142,5.454545454545454
3659636,5,B001JSCMM6,I had never seen this movie and it was different but for some reason little boys love the puppy being a Super Hero thumbs up!!,1330387200,,126,4.08
3659637,1,B001JSCMM6,"I ordered this set to show to my grandkids when they came to visit. Unfortunately, by the time I was able to have them here it was too late to return the movies! My box came with 2 CDs, but they were both the same, so instead of getting four movies, I got 2 of the same 2 movies! Im still missing 2 of the movies. From now on I will check out my purchases as soon as they come whether I need them then or not!! Im very disappointed that I cant return the duplicates and get the two missing movies!!",1323561600,2,498,3.892156862745098
3659638,5,B001JSCMM6,"There are four movies included in this set. The best
and most touching is the one with the original Benji,
which popularly known as Dog Higgins from Pettycoat
Junction. He was able to act with ease and did not
take cue from his trainer.

After 33 years, the movie has not lose its beauty
and as if Benji and Frank Lane, his trainer, are
still with us.",1318723200,4,351,4.2388059701492535
3659639,2,B001JSCMM6,"My mother loved Benji as a kid, and when she saw this DVD box set at walmart she decided to buy it. I must say its a cute dog (and dogs, as in the other movies), and I am VERY impressed by whoever trained it/them. But my god, the drama is too much for me, especially the puppy mill movie (Benji! Off the leash), the first one features children being kidnapped and in one scene ***SPOILERS*** the dog gets kicked and appears dead. I know its fake and all, and the dog does go on to live, but still, that kind of horror I would not want my children to see. I am a dog breeder and the puppy mill one got me as well. ***SPOILERS*** Not only was the husband abusive to his wife, and most likely his step-child, but neglects his dogs and one in particular almost dies. In the beginning he throws a puppy across the room, and maybe into a wall. In one scene he appears to have tied either a runt, or dead puppy, in a little sack and throws it into the river. He threatens to kill the ""mutt puppy"" and appears to strangle him in one scene. I just can't handle things like that, its too much for me even if it is all fake and just a movie. I have heartburn and feel nauseated now, I don't even want to watch the other two. Its like PETA decided to make children movies.",1310947200,6,1260,4.044
