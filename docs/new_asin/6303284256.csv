7842395,4,6303284256,"This workout, led by Leisa Hart is 40 minutes of upper body and ab work.  It is very complete in hitting all the muscles and Leisa provides excellent instruction and form pointers.  All you need are a set of dumbells, Leisa used 3 lbs, I used a set of 5 and 8 lbs.

After a brief simple warmup, you do arm work in a standing position.  You will do 2 sets of 8 reps of double arm rows, the first set with the left leg back, second set with the right.  Then you will do a set of 16 bicep curls before moving into chest presses, again 2 sets of 8 reps, one set with the left leg back, other set with the right.  You will finish out this segment with upright rows, lateral raises and overhead tricep extensions (I subbed french presses for these), each exercise 16 reps.

Then you will do more exercises for the arms, but this time in a kneeling position.  You start with 1 arms rows for the back, then concentration curls for biceps, you will do 8 reps for each before repeating these two exercises on the other side.  Then you will do 2 sets of 8 pushups, then tricep kickbacks (8).  You finish out this set with shoulder shrugs and more lateral raises.

Ab work is next, this segment was tougher for me and I am feeling it today.  Lots of traditional crunches, oblique twists and reverse curls with different counts and variations to make it interesting.

Finally you will do more upper body work lying on the floor, some of it in combination with ab work.  You will start with ribcage pullovers, then bench presses while rotating the palms in.  Then you will do a set of pec flies some of them adding a crunch, you will alternate them in 4's with/without the crunch.  Finishing out this segment are lying tricep extensions and oblique crunches while adding a bicep curl.  A cooldown and stretch follows.

Overall, I enjoyed this workout, even though it was pretty easy for me.  This would be suitable for beginner/intermediate levels.  But it's a good, complete workout, I wish I would have had this when I started exercising.  Leisa does a good job instructing and has a nice personality.  I also liked the setting and the music was decent.",1137283200,,2141,4.421994884910486
7842396,4,6303284256,"This video is now 10 years old (released in 1994), yet it still provides an excellent upper body workout.  It begins with a 6-minute warm-up which consists of fairly simple, slightly dancey-type moves.  Next comes 6 minutes of standing upper body toning, which includes many standard exercises such as lat rows, overhead press, french press, and upright rows.  The next 8 minutes are performed in a kneeling position, and each move is executed on one side of the body at a time for greater concentration on the muscles.  This section includes concentration curls, lat rows, and tricep kick-backs which alternate with two sets of push-ups.

The workout then moves to the floor for 13 minutes of abs work.  Most of the exercises consist of traditional crunches, including oblique and reverse crunches.  However, the addition of some pulses and other more unique moves left my abs definitely feeling it at the end (and definitely sore the next day!).  The final toning section of the workout is 7 minutes of combined arms and abs.  First, you will do some arms work in a lying position, including lat pullovers and flies.  Then, you will incorporate the abs while still using arms--e.g., performing flies as you crunch or doing a bicep curl as you work the obliques.  The 5-minute cool-down consists of nice, yoga-inspired twists and stretches.

Leisa Hart's instruction is very good.  She starts each section by briefly reviewing form pointers, but otherwise, she provides instruction while you are doing the moves so as not to slow down the pace of the workout.  However, one problem that I had with the workout is that the music is so loud and distracting that it is difficult to hear Leisa; the sound editing on the video is clearly very poor.  Otherwise, the production is good:  the set is the standard Buns of Steel studio, and Leisa wears a simple lycra top/shorts set which does not look overly dated.  Although Leisa mentions that the toning work can be done without weights, I think this would be too easy for all but the most absolute beginners.  Leisa herself uses 3-lb. weights, and I found that my 5-lb. weights were too easy at times.  This workout is probably best suited for advanced beginner to intermediate levels, with those in the latter category like myself needing to increase their weights.",1095724800,6,2312,4.867007672634271
7842397,5,6303284256,"Hart has made many videos, and this one is a keeper, the abs and arms are worked in progression and you feel great toning with her. I loved this!",1061251200,,145,4.0344827586206895
7842398,5,6303284256,"I've tried a variety of videos for toning the abs, and this is by far my favorite one. I like it better than any of the other videos in the ""Steel"" series. Leisa Hart, the trainer, is pleasant & professional, and the exercises really work. The section for arms is pretty easy unless you use fairly heavy weights.",971913600,9,312,4.396551724137931
7842399,4,6303284256,"I've been using this tape for about two months now, and am really seeing some results. If you haven't done any previous ab work, expect some post-workout pain, in spite of all of the useful stretching exercises Leisa  does before and after the workout. Though it is said you can do the arm  exercises without hand weights, I'd advise you use at least one pound  weights because otherwise the arm portion may seem a little dull and you  may lose interest. The ab section, however, is challenging and well-paced,  and Leisa is a pleasant instructor with an encouraging attitude.",961632000,25,576,4.777777777777778
