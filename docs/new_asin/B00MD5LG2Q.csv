On a snowy night a man visits ""The Lion's Head"" in Iping. He wants private room with a fire. [Jenny's top knot hair style dates to the 1890s.] This visitor wants to be left alone. There is the usual gossip about any stranger. Next we see the place where Jack Griffen worked, a place that developed methods for food preservation. But Jack often worked alone in secret. There is a dispute when the visitor is behind in his rent. A policeman is called because of the assault. The wife of the tavern owner plays her part over the top for comic effect. They must arrest the stranger before he takes off his clothes. Being invisible gives great power; will it be handled responsibly?

The scientists talk about Jack's experiments. He used a little known drug that bleached color and also affected the material. Jack visits Kemp for help; he is tired, cold, and hungry. [The food eaten can be seen until it is digested.] Jack's commands shows his state of mind. Griffen tells of his obsessive search for the secret of invisibility. The drugs he took inflamed his brain; Griffen has great plans for personal power. But Griffen must return to retrieve his valuable notebooks. The police Inspector decided the story about an invisible man was a hoax; then an ink pot was thrown in his face!

Kemp is now a captive in his own home. The police send a thousand men to search for the invisible man; he will still leave tracks. They will search everywhere, no warrants will be needed. Will Kemp call the police to report Jack's presence? Had the invisibility drug driven Jack mad? His speech suggests this. The police arrive, Jack escapes but promises to kill Kemp that night. The police have a plan to capture this invisible man; it can't fail, can it? But Nature works against Jack Griffen when the police find his hiding place. Jack can be heard if not seen. Will a few pistol shots stop the invisible man? [Can doctors treat an invisible man?]

The moral is to not meddle in things that should be left alone. Yet Jack worked in preserving foods via chemicals. Is this an argument against chemical foods, or ""genetic modification""? Or against experimenting with drugs? This film is a condensed and simplified version of the novel. The story has smoothed out the details of Jack's past life. I think the book was better. This story may be a parody or critique of Adam Smith's ""invisible hand"" that regulates economic life (in theory). It shows what a real invisible man can do with his invisible hand.",1488931200,,2536,4.654017857142857
