8532251,5,B008XNZ92K,"I wanted to write a review for this because I didn't see any when I went to purchase this DVD. I had heard about this DVD from a counselor and decided to get it for my close friend and her kids who are going through a divorce. I watched the DVD with them, and it really resonated with the kids. They kept commenting that that was exactly how they felt. I think it was a great educational tool for them to see others experiencing and feeling what they were. As for me, watching it was a bit heart-wrenching. I have to say it definitely gave me and my husband motivation to work through any hard times after seeing what those children went through. The accompanying workbook that you can download after purchasing the DVD seemed extremely thought-provoking as well. All in all I would highly recommend this DVD for any family going through divorce.",1350345600,,846,4.5
