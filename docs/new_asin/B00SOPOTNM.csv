8699025,5,B00SOPOTNM,"Made three years after the first season of Student Council's Discretion, a second season titled Seitokai no Ichizon Lv. 2 aired in Japan on the Nico Live section of Nico Nico Douga between October 13 and December 15, 2012. Lv. 2 was produced by AIC and directed by Ken'ichi Imaizumi.

This second season continues the hijinks and comedy found in season one. Ken Sugisaki is still the only male member of Hekiyou Academy Student Council, surrounded by the same cast of lovable girl characters. This Blu-ray set contains ten episodes and an OVA in excellent quality. Like the first season of this hilarious comedy, the native Japanese soundtrack is the only audio option.

The humor in this season is more meta in nature, though still very funny at times. The characters get a nice send-off in this final season.",1433721600,,810,4.820143884892087
