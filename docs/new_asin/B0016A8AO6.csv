8261917,3,B0016A8AO6,"Disappointed this Video could have been done a whole lot better. It was like it was made as a school project from old home videos and shares to much with ""still making moonshine"" video",1412467200,,184,4.4411764705882355
8261918,2,B0016A8AO6,"I love Jimtom, but this ""documentary"" really missed the Mark.  It's maybe 15-20 minutes long, feels like an intro to a legitimate documentary but then it just ends abruptly.  Jimtom is a great character but this is a really shallow documentary that doesn't begin to capture his large personality.",1366848000,3,296,5.020408163265306
8261919,5,B0016A8AO6,You need to have these also available on DVD's as it isn't a lot of fun to watch movies on a computer screen.,1365206400,,109,3.782608695652174
8261920,5,B0016A8AO6,people were real and honest the process was correct only fault it ended weird every thing from church service to the shinning was on the money,1363737600,,142,4.5
8261921,2,B0016A8AO6,"This documentary had the ability to be up there with popcorn suttons, ""the last one"". Except the producers totally bombed it. Some good stories, but I thought this was supposed to be about moonshine.?.?  don't waste your time, right when you sit down you're getting back up to cut the tv off, 22 minutes, are u fin kidding me. That's like a dollar a minute.",1327190400,,357,4.492307692307692
8261922,1,B0016A8AO6,if i wanted to see a drunk bum i would go behind the abc . no i wanted to learn a little more on the process of makeing it and about its roots . keep this in mind if you don't wanna feel cheated to,1301529600,,197,3.4
8261923,4,B0016A8AO6,This video is not what you expect. It is NOT a video that shows a lot on the making of moonshine. It talks a lot about moonshine but it's main focus is the people involved in the making of moonshine and the mountain folk culture.,1281312000,5,229,4.111111111111111
