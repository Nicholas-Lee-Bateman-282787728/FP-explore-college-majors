2654372,5,B000ICL3OW,"What is performed on stage is Mozart's opera ""La Finta Semplice"", taped in Salzburg in 2006 and composed when young Wolfgang was only 12. The DVD is part of the ""M22"" collection of all Mozart operas on DVD.
Let's face it: this is not a Mozart for the faint-hearted: the stage director decided to savagely cut the recitativo secco so that the opera runs for a total 2h10 versus the usual pace of 3h00. He decided to replace most of this dialogue -- initially in Italian -- by a German dialogue, ""acted"" by all the singers and a fantastic German actress, Marianne Hamre.
The result tends to make Mozart's genius, aged 12, even more obvious: with most of the ""boring"" bits removed, we are left with virtually two hours of non-stop beauty, showing the young composer's lyricism and comical sense.
The production of Joachim Schloemer has a lot to do with this success. Without negating the humorous aspects of the piece -- where comic book elements intermingle with body painting and practical jokes, he also turns it into a reflection on creation and the independence of the artist. In this respect the production can also be very moving -- particularly when Rosina, the main character, frees herself from her ""shadow"" who choreographed all her movements.
The triumph is also musical. The distribution is simply unparalleled, led by the beautiful soprano Malin Hartelius as Rosina and the bass Josef Wagner. Their duet in Act II when they performed an hilarious ""love dance"" is worth by itself the price of the DVD. This very integrated and very lyric team of singers/actors is enthusiastically conducted by Michael Hofstetter. The Camerata Salzburg provides the ideal Mozart orchestra, accurate, very rhythmic and also lyrical when all the singers pause for thought.
An unforgettable evening, that should hopefully help ""Semplice"" back in the repertoire. Bring on the other DVDs of the M22 collection!",1168300800,20,1898,4.990536277602524
2654373,5,B000ICL3OW,This production of a very early Mozart opera is charming. The secco recitatives were cut and instead an actress in yellow outfit recites briefly in German the plot. Most of the singers are young with fresh and beautiful voices. The only well known singer is soprano Malin Hartelius. A tiny duet of her with bass Josef Wagner in the second part of the work is one of the funniest moments I saw in an opera production...,1168041600,7,418,4.5131578947368425
2654374,5,B000ICL3OW,"This is a very innovative production that for the most part is very effective.  Dance moves that could be from the movie ""Dirty Dancing"" might offend some, but are very effective. The brief appearance of an extra dressed only in floor length hair, which does not quite cover her, is less effective.  Overall this is regietheater with a good plan that has meaning for all, not just the director.

For fans of Malin Hartelius this a must have.  For the first time on DVD she is cast as an older woman.  She is perfect in every way.

The cast is a very talented group of young singers who are new to me.  Every one is very good.

The orchestra is comprised of modern instruments expertly balanced.  This is a nice change from the bright sound that has dominated early music.",1165104000,8,771,4.45
8144777,1,B000ICL3OW,"You know, I thought I'd get the chance to see a neglected masterpiece of a young genius. A boy so exploited by his father already  a father who would later confiscate all of Wolfgang's immense earnings when Wolfgang continued to be the miracle that he already was here in this opera rather than behaving himself, having already expressed the miracle of what a child is in this music, despite all the exploitation  I thought I would get to see glimpse of such genius, that it's a miracle what comes of it. Instead this is again corrupted by a stage director seeing chance to exploit the same young boy.
  The stage director has removed most of Mozart's recitatives and replaced it with a sort of paparazzi Entertainment Tonight character narrating and offering interpretation of the characters. We get no chance to see the characters interact with each other through recitative and gain understanding (that would have been too boring according to the stage director), instead we get patronizing remarks in German by a miked character added to the opera that not only is cause to remove creative work of Mozart, but also to talk through the music, stand on stage being distracting and change the whole acoustic quality of the sound whenever she speaks and is miked. I don't know where this freedom comes from to allow a man to decide to cut from the opera the recitatives Mozart wrote, believing it would be too boring. Had he written the recitatives himself, he should feel free to cut them (along with his added characterizations); but no, they still remain on the DVD. Maybe future ""improvements"" to Mozart's opera will reinstate what was Mozart's not the stage director's opera? He didn't write the recitatives, Mozart did, and this is supposed to be honoring Wolfgang's birth, not the stage director's presumption of adding a jumble of narrated characterizations trying to make the singers on stage out to be something resembling a bar clique that quakes quirky idiosyncrasies of themselves to make business of attracting each other without actually making themselves vulnerable as human beings. How petty the libretto may be, the music still makes every character divine, and reaches into their humanity. It seems the stage director has tried to destroy that for some intellectual effect. I don't think Mozart's recitatives would have been that superficial, in fact I'm sure they aren't. And it's patronizing to treat art or human nature in such a manner: to hack apart the work of the reason the whole event exists, and replace it with what we have here. The stage director is free to write his own opera, or play, or make a set of opera dolls for aficionados to put on their shelf and dote on with the rest of their knick-knacks while indulging in libations in containers small enough to go with the enlightenment going on. Why ""improve"" a whole Mozart opera when he could do all of that!? At what level is there any honesty going on for the stage director to say that he thinks the recitatives are too long and too boring, when perhaps in reality he sees an opportunity to insert this narrator character of his and make his mark, despite it's not his opera. What this says about the present lack of respect for creativity that exists for itself rather than something to exploit (the whole rain forest included) I won't even get into.
THIS work he didn't write, and he's intruded into it and exploited what should have been left free to express what's already there, with the material that the composer himself put there to be heard, rather than to be removed. THAT'S why it's called Mozart's opera not the stage director's. I find it shockingly disrespectful, and that on the anniversary of Wolfgang's birth! I can see that I thought too well of the kind of clique Wolfgang himself had to deal with, and clearly still does.
Unfortunately, I found out too late, that you can use the remote to skip all of the narrators remarks. And it's a quite cruel trick that the ending is also changed. Polidoro, who would have been left alone to figure out what this joke called love (or marriage) is all about, is supposed to marry the narrator added by the stage director (she proposes to him). It also ruins any idea that marriage means anything to the others. This narrator character that talks in another language, is miked, and actually talks through some of the music (is this again too boring otherwise?)! It's so intrusive, I can't imagine what anyone wasn't thinking. The miking makes a harsh disruption of the sound, as do her facetious remarks, her constant appearance on stage and her act as if she's studying human behavior, like a over active marketing agent. There's also no explanation in the DVD telling you the stage director added a character, took out the recitatives, or what part of Wolfgang Amadeus' creativity (the reason the opera exists) we've been robbed of, although this is sold as a Mozart Opera, not a hybrid exploitation of the genius work of a then already overly exploited young child that then already had no youth, to once again be abused by adults on the anniversary of his birth 250 years later.
I won't even say anything about the rest of the stage directing (the characters sliding around on what looks like white shelves tilted into a maze, and smearing paint on each other), or the obscene gestures put into the opera of a 12 year old boy, or the extra entity on stage sometimes creating the impression she's dancing trying to express being disturbed as if we shouldn't be enjoying the melody, or giving the impression that at the split second end of every phrase she has to frantically reassemble it or joist it up, and another time she's naked moping with her fingers in her hair looking like an evil disembodied entity, again distracting from the beauty of the melody. On afterthought this appears to be a psychological shadow figure of Rosina again conjured up by the stage director, and seems to express the unconscious wish to be a morbid kleptomaniac the way she grasps and gesticulates frantically in the air whenever a musical phrase ends or takes a turn, when not looking like a disembodied ghost bent on attracting people into the self indulgence of doom. Will this steal our thoughts and attention would we actually relax into the melody of the composer of the opera, whose recitatives have been deemed too boring and replaced by a wanna-be spiffy gossip columnist's narration? And I won't say anything about the other gestures and movements made by the singers, which I am sure are so well thought out intellectually or conceptually, that it doesn't have to have anything to do with the actual opera, and so there's no need for me to remark since it would be completely off-topic.
The singing and the orchestra are at least decent or even amazing. If you happen to buy this DVD or already have, try using the remote to skip the stage directors insertions, and follow along with a synopsis. Whenever it says Auctoritus for a track, in the notes, just press the button for the next track, and you can skip the lady speaking German through a microphone in an opera otherwise in Italian sung by singers who need no mike and whose music wasn't composed to go along with the Auctoritusing.
I found this quite shocking and disruptive. It's a miracle the music still comes through, as best it can, despite this FORCED attempt to do something ground breaking, but that's always been the way with Mozart, with music, with art, with human nature.

One can only be thankful for the reminder, once again, of what Wolfgang had to go through, lest we forget that my some miracle music still survives it.

This DVD deserves at least 3 stars because of the singing, but I'm going to be consistent and give it one.

It is worth seeing just to see what's left, despite everything...",1437091200,2,7813,4.740441176470588
8144778,3,B000ICL3OW,Wonderful music. Great video and sound. Excellent singing. Horrible Eurotrash staging. Next time I want to hear the music I will turn the video off. Be warned.,1421107200,,159,4.925925925925926
8144779,5,B000ICL3OW,"Director Joachim Schlomer undertook what may have been the most ambitious project of the entire M22 Salzburg Mozart Festival in 2006.  Over the course of three evenings, Schlomer presented Odysseys (Irrfahrten).  Schlomer begins the first evening of his odyssey with an early Mozart opera, La finta semplice. This is the starting point of a challenging journey with the composer, as filtered through Schlomer's vision.

In 1769 the twelve year old Mozart composed his three-act opera buffa La finta semplice (The Pretend Simpleton) to a libretto by poet Marco Coltellini, which was in turn based off of Carlo Goldoni's comedy.  It is one of the most appetizing of Mozart's early operas.

Captain Fracasso and his sergeant Simone are stationed at the home of two wealthy, foolhardy brothers: Don Cassandro and Don Polidoro. Cassandro and Polidoro have a sister, Giacinta, with whom Fracasso is smitten.  Simone is chasing after the maid, Ninetta. Cassandro, a notorious misogynist, is continually at odds with his womanizing brother.  Fracasso's sister, Rosina, arrives to help her brother and, with Ninetta's assistance, Rosina attempts to seduce both Cassandro and Polidoro.  Rosina plays the part of a sexy simpleton, and she is quite successful with Cassandro.  After a night of much drinking, the brothers quarrel over Rosina (leading to a comic duel).  The quarreling is followed by dizzying amorous intrigue and romantic mix-ups.  The brothers are lead to believe that Giacanta has run off with Simone and taken the estate's treasure with him.  Finally, Rosina, Giacanta and Ninetta end up with their chosen lovers. Only Polidoro walks away empty-handed, which leaves him happily single and unfettered.

Schlomer's trilogy, beginning with La finta semplice, is not an odyssey for the simpleton, or the timid Mozartean opera goer.  Refreshingly, his is a richly complex, adult odyssey, which encompasses determination, crisis, confusion and eventually, possible liberation.  In La finta semplice, Schlomer replaces the recitatives with German narration (the original, Italian arias are retained).  The result here is an extraordinary tightening of the lyrical and farcical experience.  The new dialogue is delivered by an additional character named Auctoritas, hypnotically played by actress Marianne Hamre (in a bright yellow body suit, which the actress wittily referred to as her 'Kill Bill' costume).  Hamre's characterization embraces Brechtian concepts, acting out the narration and interacting with the opera's characters.  With the exception of Hamre, the sets and costumes, designed by Jens Kilian, are minimalistic and devoid of color: bridal whites.  Malin Hartelius, as Rosina, commands the triangular stage.  Another addition, ""Dark Rosina"" (played by Anna Tenta), is a mute appendage who amusingly, and hauntingly, choreographs Rosina's movements, until Rosina frees herself.  The Act II love duet between Rosina and Cassandro (Josef Wagner) is capped by an off-the-meter amorous dance.  Schlomer, a notable choreographer and dancer himself, intelligently directs Hartelius: she sings one thing, but dances another, acting out the Rosina underneath the simpleton facade.  The duel between the brothers becomes a battle of animated weapons.  It is so unexpected and surreal that you half expect Yosemite Sam and Bugs Bunny to show up.  Silvia Moi (Ninetta), Jeremy Ovanden (Fracasso), Matthisas Klink (Polidoro, who, in this version, does get a girl--the narrator Hamre), Marina Comparato and Mijenko Turk make up the rest of a cast with vibrant personality (how about red bras and body paint to off-set the virginal white?).  Michael Hofstetter conducts the Camerata Salzburg as if he and his orchestra get the joke.

Abendempfindung (Evening Sensation) is the second evening of Odysseys. This is not an opera at all, but a pasticcio of Mozart arias, music (including works for glass harmonica), and letters.  The legendary soprano Ann Murray plays ""the Singer,"" the first of three allegorical characters that represent the artist Mozart at a dissatisfied stage in his life (culled from depressing letters he wrote while in Salzburg).  More than that, the three symbolize the life struggles of artists in the world.  Marianne Hamre is the second representation (""the Actress"") and Graham Smith the third (""the Dancer"").

Murray's delivery of the Abendempfindung aria is sensitive and blue.  Perched on a suitcase, she contemplates suicide as a way to change trajectory.  She is dependent on others and longs for complete freedom, which does not come with financial security.  This meditative theme is continued by the actress and dancer.  The three principals, each through their unique artistic expression, convey a wistful defiance in the onslaught of challenges.  Ethereal, digital imagery is hauntingly utilized to echo their fractured plight.  Hamre's radiant dive in a pool strikes a gossamer note.  Rather than a concise narrative, Abendemfindung draws the viewer into strangely intimate visuals and emotive fragmentation.

The third evening, titled Rex tremendus, combines two unfinished Mozart operas-Lo Sposo deluso (The Disappointed Bridegroom) and L' Oca del Cairo (The Cairo Goose)--together with movements from the unfinished ""Requiem.""  Mozart scholar Erik Smith gave the first prepared performance of the unfinished operas several years ago.  In Bridegroom, Bocconio Papparelli plans to marry the considerably younger Eugenia, whom he has never met.  Boccino's confidant is the misogynist Pulcherio.  Pulcherio realizes that Eugenia is actually in love with her former lover, the Tuscan officer, Don Asdrubale.  Pulcherio has sympathy for Eugenia, and he too falls in love with Bocconio.  Boccino's vain niece, Bettina, is competing for the love of Asdrubale.  Metilda (a singer) and Gervasio (Eugenia's tutor) are also thrown into the chaotic mix of confused romance.

The Cairo Goose tells the story of Celidora and Lavina.  The women have been imprisoned by Don Pippo.  Pippo has ambitions to marry Lavina, but she is in love with Calandrino.  Celidora is the chosen bride for Count Lionetto, but she is in love with Biondello.  Calandrino is flirting with the maid, Aureeta,which arouses the jealousy of Auretta's lover, Chicchibio.  Biondello rescues Celidora and Lavina and, together, they escape to the garden.  At this point the opera ends without the appearance of a goose.

Schlomer and cast embrace the fragmentary nature of the works, and treat Rex tremendus as Mozartean performance art.  The cast from the first two evenings return. Again, Hamre is the M.C.  Murray dissipates as she is enclosed in the glass space of melancholic reflections.  Here, geese do briefly appear, like relics being taken to a faraway temple.  Aimlessness and confusion abound, but Hamre, having taken everything in, seems to be moving towards something.  The evening fades as Hamre emerges, dressed in a new, virtuous white.  Although she has, in part, come to symbolize the composer, it is she that we feel have come closest to knowing.  She lights a cigarette.  She is inexplicably moved in the sanctuary of the Requiem's lacrimosa.  Of course,this sanctuary is temporary, but it will suffice.  This simple ending gives comforting flesh to the Requiem, far more than the plethora of edified iconography normally associated with the composer's final work.  Thankfully, Schlomer and ensemble remove Mozart from his pedestal, and feel as if they are replacing the opera house with the intimacy of an concert performed in our own house, swimming pool, cafe, or a little art gallery.

Predictably, Schlomer's vision has critics, one of who pointedly complained that Murray's skirt was too short for opera.  The scope of Irrfahrten never gets in the way of personality. There is nothing so predictable as an obvious, pedestrain ""lesson"" to be had here.  Rather, this is penetrating communion.  I wanted it to go on.  Joy in repetition.  That is something, I think.

8144780,4,B000ICL3OW,"Negatives and Positives--some of each!

What I didn't like about this production:

Those horrid, white ""tennis outfits"" had to have been designed by a misogynist--no woman would ever design skirts to accentuate women's hips this much.

The Eurotrash modernization touches:  smearing red paint all over most of the singers, the yellow running suit-clad ""narrator"" who was always interrupting the singers, the nude alter ego dancer, shadowing Malin Hartelius during one of her arias.

I also didn't like the nearly total absence of a plot.

So, given all those terrible accusations, how could I find something to like about this production?

You guessed it!  Mozart's music (even this that he wrote at the age of 12) is simply beautiful.  Malin Hartelius' aria begging Cupid's messengers not to fire their arrows at her heart will really tug at your heartstrings.  Likewise the rest of the cast is made up of young beautiful performers who sing every bit as well as they look.  Really--they sing and move around the stage with such energy and delight in the music that it's possible to forget the strange costuming and production ideas that have been imposed upon them.  Don't worry if, like me, you have trouble at times, following the plot.  It's Mozart opera buffa, and it turns out with a happy ending with all the attractive singers forming happy pairs, and all of it paired to Mozart's incomparably beautiful music.",1270252800,,1419,4.987234042553191
8144781,1,B000ICL3OW,"The most significant thing to know about this production is that they have cut out most of the recitatives (the sung dialogue between the arias) and replaced them with a lady in a yellow jogging suit who explains to you what the characters are thinking.  No joke!  In the bonus material, it is explained that this is because the director felt that the recitatives are too long for modern audiences.  Aside from the outrage of replacing Mozart's music with material written by the director, this has two bad consequences: 1. It's impossible to discern any plot.  The recitatives were there to provide that.  2. Since the characters never talk to each other, they have no personalities.  This is exacerbated by having them all wear identical white uniforms, and never letting them complete an aria without the jogger lady butting in and mugging for the camera.  The result is not an opera, but a succession of out-of-context arias interspersed with smart-alec remarks from the lady in yellow.  So, while the singing is good and the opera itself is a masterpiece, I have to say that this is just possibly the worst production of any opera that I have seen in several decades of opera attendance.",1249603200,8,1192,4.8088235294117645
8144782,4,B000ICL3OW,"Below is my original review written on first viewing the opera on disc six years ago (it is now 2015). This time I found myself  enjoying it a good deal more and caring a lot less about the staging, costuming and sets. I can sympathize with the views of the well informed opera buffs who have written critical reviews. As a stage production it is certainly lacking and I will  take their word that omissions distort the original meaning of the production. Nonetheless as an opera-ignorant person who has seen only four or five seasons by top-notch companies, when still able to get to them and, therefore, an opera lover mostly by way of discs, I really did enjoy it this time. For whatever reasons, I viewed it as  I would a compromise between the concert form, singers standing side by side and singing their roles before the orchestra and the traditional staged version....standing much closer to the former than the latter. With that conceptual screen for the proceedings, I put the singing first, second and third, and the remainder of the production as a bit of visual display to vary the visual background for the audience so as to lessen possible mild boredom. Without subtitles the opera might have been ruined for me, but with them, everything fell sufficiently in place emphasize the ""songs"" and place them sufficiently in context to provide an idea of the general structure. Most reviewers seem to have agreed that the singers were well up to their roles and what they sang was quite satisfactory for me (whatever might have been my feelings had I been familiar with what was omitted. So, to others in the amateur category, I now feel able to recommend it to those who know what they  are getting and that it is not a traditional version (or the way Mozart wanted it to be). I refer other categories of potential viewers to the excellent reviews by experienced music people who have written their appraisals (which were well worth the amateur's time to read). Next, what I wrote six years ago.

This is a libretto by an experienced writer of comic opera with a score by a uniquely talented 12 year old. Let us not compare it with what what the mature Mozart could do with the stimulus of an outstanding writer like DaPonte.
Still as a traditional romantic farce, when well sung, it can be quite enjoyable. This production is typical of the Mozart 22 set, updating and revising words and music to fit the conception of the production staff. I did not object to the intent but found that it did not work in performance. No fault of the singer/actors; they made the most of what they were given vocally; what they were given to act, was however, to me, often written and staged to be a singular distraction from the operatic core.
Clearly, viewers differ as to that judgment. If one is selecting but one DVD to buy, the reader will have to make his/her own predilections in making a choice. Happily more than one approach is available.

The music is wonderful, composed by a 12 year old boy... you can not believe it (It reminds me Cosi fan Tutte). As I never heard it before is diffcult to give an accurate opinion about the singers, but all of them are great, good and beautiful voices. I think we have to get used to modern stages. Of course there ere limits. In this case The stage is simple and modern and does not bother at all, on the contrary helps to concentrate more on the music and singing. I doubted many times to buy this DVD but after reading many rewiews here I did, and I thank to many of the rewiewers for this.

Now, the staging... well, except for one inexplicably irrelevant aesthetic misjudgment, it manages to be entertaining, and that's the most I can say for it. It's not hugely pretentiously symbolic, for which I'm thankful(except once again for that godawful nude). La Finta Semplice is not an opera on the level of Don Giovanni; therefore, it's not a sacred writ. A different staging might be more authentic, but how likely is it that another production will assemble such a perfect vocal cast?",1174694400,5,709,5.173913043478261
8144786,3,B000ICL3OW,"Oh dear.

I can see I'm not going to be popular in animadverting against this DVD, but based on the reviews currently posted, I'd have taken the plunge and bought this DVD. (I did in fact buy the DVD, but without having read any reviews of it at all.) So I would like to add the viewpoint of someone who does not MIND updated/modernised staging, but prefers classical staging. An example of a modernised staging that I thought worked beautifully is the Australian production of Giulio Cesare (Handel), in which Yvonne Kenny and Graham Pushee led a mostly fabulous cast, and the staging is remarkably powerful, elegant and fitting. I also adore without reservation the La Traviata with Mireille Delunsch, which is as far removed from the more traditional stagings as one could get, yet it works wonderfully for me. It's in fact the most moving Traviata I have ever seen.

But modernisation for the point of modernisation... modernisation for the sake of making it ""less boring"" for the audience (for an opera lover, this is oxymoronic! We tend to adore imaginative but rooted-in-the-classical-staging-tradition staging, and the risk is that some of us will be bored BY THE MODERNISED versions!)... modernisation for the purpose of dragging a Freudian subtext from the opera... and so on... no. No, and no, and no. I don't ever want the director to place his interpretation over and above the actual meaning and context of the composer. To remove an opera from its time period is fraught with difficulties because, for instance, both the composer and the society of the period viewed morality, societal behaviour and class structures differently from the way in which most 21st century directors do. This gives an important context to the character motivations (in Don Giovanni, for instance, Donna Elvira's retiring to a convent does not make sense in a modern setting). This can sometimes be overcome by very clever staging and acting, but I really do not think it is easily done.

I also think a ""modernise it"" approach may fail by virtue of the subtext the director is trying to convey. It doesn't always fail by any means, but... well, I'm definitely wary of modernised versions. This review is really aimed at letting those who love traditionally staged operas know what to expect in this DVD.

Firstly, I'll be frank - I loathed, loathed, loathed the costumes. The cast are uniformly good-looking people, but the costumes did not flatter them at all. The men weren't so badly off as the women, although one finds the white karate outfits (?) which they wore to be inexplicable. But the women! Why on earth were they dressed in badly designed tennis outfits? (That is what the outfits looked like.) The skirts were completely unflattering, with a slightly ballooning fullness at the hips that was terribly unfair for the women.

I understand that the director thought the preponderance of the colour ""white"" everywhere would signify ""chastity"" or ""purity"" or ""coldness"", as relevant to the older brother's stated intention not to marry and not to fall prey to any woman, no matter how charming.

This is the level of interpretation... I really was not impressed!

The younger brother, with whose affections the ""pretended simpleton"" of the title played, does want to marry, and ironically in the opera itself, he's the only one who does not find a bride. (I say ""in the opera itself"" - it does not hold true for this particular production which clearly does not want to maintain the Mozartian ending.) But his desire to wed, and the cast's entire triumph of love and passion over coldness is signified by... yes, you guessed it, the colour ""red"". That is, red goo is smeared over the unfortunate younger bachelor - this does not make sense in terms of the action, but only in terms of the director's idea of the opera. (There's some silly business too with red goo smeared onto his back in the  shape of a heart, signifying the love letter he must send to Rosina.)

Red shoes, a red top, a red bra, they all gradually add to an increasing ""redness"" in the costumes. It really does not work for me. The idea is terribly simplistic, without subtlety.

The set itself is minimal - it consists of two slightly slanted ""wings"" of white on either side, down which the characters slide, up which they trot, behind which they pop up. I did not like it, but had the costumes been better and the directing style less odd, I would not have minded the set.

The directing style... ugh. I am of course only expressing my own opinion... but the acting style was just silly. Contorted arm movements, running up and down the side wings, and the light-generated ""weapons"" in the duel were not appealing to me. It seemed rather childish... I also could not fathom the sense in having an actress or dancer shadowing Rosina for more than half of the opera. The director was trying to convey something about a ""dark Rosina"", presumably because Rosina is rather mischievously cruel with the younger brother's affections, and she certainly also plays with the older brother's heart as well (although she does actually grant her hand to him at the opera's end). But this is trying to make something sensible of a basically nonsensical plot!

Mozart's opera ""La Finta Semplice"" is not intended to be a serious presentation of human behaviour. It's fun, full of intentionally silly behaviour, deliciously redolent of moments such as the older brother's explanation of his ""plop-plop-plop"" beating heart. It's full of beautiful things musically, and I do not agree with the reviewer who said that taking out the recitatives removes the ""boring"" stuff. Au contraire - I believe Mozart's recitatives are marvellously full of character. Taking them out is unjust to the opera, although I realise that not everyone would agree with me.

If the recits MUST be removed, then I must agree it was well done in this production. The actress who performed the spoken German dialogue was indeed wonderful - her speaking voice was lively and effective, and her appearance (facial gestures and movement on the stage) was striking. (I did not like the yellow tracksuit she wore, though - what was it supposed to represent?)

Having the ""shadow Rosina"" completely naked except for long Godiva-like hair over her face sweeping down to cover her genital area... well, that too had me wincing. What was the purpose? Perhaps something terribly profound such as ""Here we have Rosina singing about her real desire for love and her fear of having her heart toyed with, so let us make the shadow character NAKED to show this is Rosina being HONEST""? I can but sigh - it looked awfully odd and inappropriate, and did not add any meaning at all. In fact, it ruined that gorgeous aria for me in this production.

And gorgeous is the right word to use for the singing. Everyone was beautifully cast - I enjoyed the voices of all, but in particular the lovely singing of Ms Hartelius as Rosina. (BEAUTIFUL voice! She reminded me quite a lot of Dorothea Rschmann - a pure and creamy soprano ideal for Mozart.) But everyone is good in this production, and everyone is beautiful to look at in potentia in this production as well. With a different director and costume designer, this could have been a stunner of a production.

Viewers who like avant-garde productions have clearly embraced this performance and find great meaning in it.

Obviously, as you can see, I did not find great meaning, and found the visual of this DVD less than inspiring. I did adore the singing and consider the cast excellent... but the directing adversely affected my enjoyment, and I do not think I'll be watching this again.",1171152000,37,7651,4.82824427480916
