What can be more entertaining and engrossing than giant ticks.  Ticks that crawl under the skin of wayward youth in the woods.  The acting is okay.  The directing is slightly above average.  The critters themselves are quite believable.  Rent or buy this movie and sit back for a night of fun in ""The Movie Room"".",983923200,,445,4.419753086419753

Watch him in the vet's office when  they're doing the autopsy-he's actually trying to hold back some laughter!

Seeing Carlton from The Fresh Prince trying to play a street punk was just weird & kinda funny but hey, I knew a couple kids from way back when who looked like ordinary everyday people until you got to know them. Anyways, if you weren't scared of ticks before, this movie will make you scared of them or at least more aware they're out there when you're walking through a wooded area.

This movie does have some very creepy scenes, esp. when the eggs hatch. The cast wasn't very well known in '95, but that all changed about 2 years after. The special f/x of the 80s-90s were just as convincing, and took more effort, but due to computers now, everything is just too easy.

The only thing I would comment on negatively were a few bad edits, that didn't Seem to connect scenes smoothly, but it's not bad enough to slow down the flow of the movie. This has all old school practical effects, and makes it a lot better to me than newer cgi heavy creature features. I got this movie & The 2013 movie ""SPIDERS"" at the same time, and watched them back to back, and I bet Spiders had twice the budget of Ticks, and Ticks is a far more superior and memorable film. I usually scoff at people who claim in their reviews, that they fall asleep during movies, thinking they're just being mean, but I have to admit, I really almost fell asleep during Spiders.

It just looked like a fun little cheesy 90's movie, it was the ""promotional version"" though..which sucked pretty badly. I still watched it and loved it..the character that made the movie for me was ""Panic"" played by Alfonso Ribeiro..aka Carlton from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"". He plays as the gangsta trouble kid that is just so terribly acted. It's so unconvincing every line he spat out made me laugh.

Well the movie is basically about a group troubled kids who go to camp through some youth program. None of them like nature so
they're all complaining and stuff of not wanting to be there. Little did they know it'll only get worse when the come across some giant ticks! It's funny seeing how much ooze comes from these things when squished. This is one of those must have movies.",1382918400,,888,4.481481481481482

553524,5,6303063772,"I remember watching this on vhs back in 1993 when it came out. The plot is simple, liquid steroids leak into the soil and cause plain old ticks to turn into ravenous blood suckers bent on killing any dog or person they can suck the blood from.  The pot growers are the reason for the contamination of the ticks.
  If you enjoy your horror on the wet and red side this is for you. There are several great gore scenes,bladder effects, bug squishing, mucho moistness and splatter!  I watched the end credits because the special effects were so well done, KNB fx!!  That would explain it because they were the best in the horror genre at the time!

553547,5,6303063772,"Finally Some Lost Classic 90's Horror makes its way to DVD and Blu Ray
I, like a few other people first saw this movie late night on HBO or Cinemax, I can't remember, but I do remember trying to find it in every video store in town. Here's why
There's tons of mutant killer bug movies that have been made, but none (I can think of, maybe The Nest) that are as gory as Ticks, due to KNB Effects, the acting is actually pretty good w/some well none actors; Seth Green, Alfonso Ribeiro (from Fresth Prince) playing a ""tough street kid"" (which he pulls off), Peter Scolari, Ami Dolenz, and great character actor Clint Howard, as well as his father in a cameo role. The plot line is pretty simple, two youth workers take some troubled kids to the wilderness as a sort of retreat. Little do they know about the Marijuania farmers pouring steroids onto the crops and little does anyone know about the Ticks, which also are sprayed w/the steriod (hence, the giant mutant bugs)
The quality on the blu ray was very impressive, but that might just be because most of us have only seen run down VHS copies from old video stores and Amazon.
Audio was not bad, but I wish it was in a 5.1 surround sound, instead it is only offered in 2.0 Stereo, no subtitles, no other languages, except a commentary track, which is pretty good (I personally don't listen to many commentary tracks) and worth a listen to any fans of the film. They provide pretty interesting and sometimes funny information about the film.

This one is a lot of fun. Ticks offers up just as much gory tick related mayhem as you'd hope for and it has both intentionally and unintentionally funny bits scattered throughout to keep things from getting too dark. It's a 6-Pack movie through and through, and a very entertaining one at that.",1362355200,,1788,4.501538461538462

Having once lived in an area where ticks were commonplace, I could appreciate the horror aspect of having one or more of the little critters clinging to your body.  Having them dug into you when they're the size of a fist is just plain crazy.  This is a worse fear realized!

The plot isn't all that complicated nor does it waste any time trying to develop into anything more than a group of people in the woods as a tick infestation is on the rise.  Ticks on steroids, as a matter of fact, being the brainstorm of a marijuana grower (Clint Howard).  Soon the ticks are running riot, attaching themselves to anything that moves.  It's surprising how well crafted these killer insects are and just how effectively they are utilized throughout the movie.  It more than makes up for the lacking as far as some of the actors are concerned.  To suggest that some of them are a bit extreme in the overdevelopment of their characters is to diminish the truly spectacular lengths they've gone to as first class hams.  I don't have to name names they're obvious.  The best performance though, belongs to Seth Green as a former ""tree hugger"" trying to overcome his past.  But the real stars, of course, are the ticks.  My favorite scene involves a tick on the loose with a hypodermic needle stuck in its back.

A great balance of comedy and horror.",1359158400,2,1428,4.484496124031008

When I was a kid, even the parents liked it because the special effects were so impressive for a title such as this. The movie does still have its corny moments, but in the world of killer bug movies, this really is the best one that has ever been made.

Hell, I'll take a simple DVD release just to have it.  The only DVD release I could find is a Region 2 (European region).  What about people in the US, region 1?  Hell, just make a region 0 disc(playable worldwide) to make people like me happy.  DAMNIT!  GIVE US THE DVD!",1172102400,,769,4.220689655172414
553601,5,6303063772,"I just watched Ticks again, this time with my daughter, and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  It has a USA rating of ""R"", and although I think it is slightly inappropriate for kids under 15 or so, I took the risk and let my 13 year old watch it without feeling too uncomfortable.  The gratituous addition of sexual suggestion and rough language is a problem with so many modern movies that I am beginning to think that they deliberately try get an ""R"" rating just to pump the ticket sales.

Ticks is a very good 1950's style movie that feels a lot like Them!, which was released in 1954, while employing much more modern directorial and special effects.  For a supposedly ""B"" movie it is very strong and much more polished than I would expect.  For example, I liked it much better than The Day After Tomorrow, despite that movie's huge budget and the fact that a high school buddy was in a couple of scenes.  If Ticks is a ""B"" movie, it is a B+++ IMO.  To be fair, I think it is better than most top-billed, big-budget selections on the movie shelf.

I only noticed one minor mistake when I could see a microphone briefly at the top of a scene at the veterinarian's office -- and that was actually a fun Easter Egg to find.  If you watch the movie, look for that brief microphone sighting!  Other than that, there was a disconinuity right near the end of the movie that seemed strange, but maybe it was just me.

I enjoyed the casting, music, sound effects, big budget feeling visual effects, and was stunned by some of the cinematography.  I especially liked it for example when the camera would move slowly with the scene panning left to right and the camera facing right, and then the next view with the camera in the same location and same slow movement with the camera facing left.  Little continuities like that were awesome.  Also awesome was the lack of some ""cutesy"" camera effects that I tend to find irritating in low budget modern films.

If you are a ham you get treated to a great boat anchor and the Morse code you'll hear is real - not random beeping.  The broadcast station that is tuned in after the code sounds like the BBC to me, which is highly appropriate considering the callsign of the director.

Ticks is one of my favorite movies, but I am nutty for 1950's Sci-Fi, and your tastes may vary.

I might have enjoyed the movie more if the characters were a little less stereotypical or not quite as strongly archetyped.  If there is to be an archetype, I always enjoy a heroic scientist who saves the World, but this is a movie with troubled teens who must rise past their emotional baggage to survive a crises.

The apocalyptic element of Ticks was rather attenuated while the horror element was hugely amplified.  If you are a horror freak you will be amply and efficiently served.  Both my daughter and I really jumped on a couple of scenes, and we are jaded enough by horror flicks to yawn through most of them.

If you haven't seen Ticks I strongly recommend it.  Watch it at night and make sure the lights are down.  It is brilliantly creepy, and I am not just saying that to lick K6BBC's loafers.",1132099200,,3123,4.436842105263158
553602,4,6303063772,"TICKS is a creepy crawly extravaganza with amazingly good creature effects for an obvious low budget movie.  The plot's fairly simple:  a marijuana farmer, played with devilish glee by Clint Howard, is using herbal steroids to increase his marijuana output. Some of the steroidal juice however manages to infest a tick larva and soon all the ticks are growing bigger and bigger, nastier and nastier.  Enter a group of troubled teens, led by Rosalind Allen and Peter Scolari, who are off for a camping adventure right near the infested area.  Soon the ticks are running around chomping on everyone.
For a run of the mill horror movie, this one is above average in its fright scale and in its effects.  I expected something much worse and was pleasantly, if not creepily, surprised!!!!",1087948800,8,783,4.901515151515151
553603,5,6303063772,"My friends and I love to rent the movies with the worst summary on the back of the cover. Ticks made the cut one weekend and that evening it stole our hearts. The character named 'Panic' (Carlton from Fresh Prince) was great. I believed his intro went like this, ""They call me Panic...cause I never do."" 'Panic' spent the entire movie doing just that- more like he ran away from everything like a little girl. The acting ... but at the same time it was brilliant. The best part of this movie was the ending. Watch for Seth Green to make an awesome jump/fall onto a van and then suddenly drive away cool as can be. Don't watch this by yourself. Get some friends and drinks and get ready to laugh your...off.",1036800000,6,706,4.356060606060606
553604,4,6303063772,"This is a classic!  A must see, especially if you're fed up with all the glossed-over high-tech films out there today, who think they're so cool just because they have things like ""computer animation"" and ""acting"". For entertainment value, this movie is right up there with Pirrana and R.O.T.O.R!  That's a compliment, by the way.  It is a great B-movie packed with stars: Seth Green, that guy from Fresh Prince of Bell Air, and Clint Howard, brother of director Ron Howard, who delivers an Oscar-calibre performance with ""Dude, you all messed up!""  My favorite part was when the giant tick egg sack was attached to the girl's back and Seth Green ingeniously saves her by (after much suspense) hitting it with a stick.
  Of course, the best scene in the movie is when one of the giant ticks is set loose in a vet's office and after they try valiantly but unsuccessfully to capture it with a fishtank net, the vet stomps on it, and the tick explodes into HIGHLY realistic white mush.  As I said before, when in doubt...",1025136000,18,1018,4.622222222222222
553605,3,6303063772,"If you like the b-movie monsters, you'll probably get a kick out of this one. I did. Along the same idea as Piranha or Bats, you can almost certainly guess the plot before the opening credits roll. A group of teenagers is taken out to the country to expand their horizons, and meets up with a forest full of ticks mutated by a plant steroid that some of the locals are using on their hidden...groves. Surprisingly realistic creature FX, and lots of very familiar faces make it more enjoyable than I was expecting. I only give it 3 out of 5 stars for a few reasons. Peter Scolari's acting is fine, but his character is constantly doing one irritating thing. He's supposed to be trying to help these city kids, but he constantly leaves them alone, for very shallow reasons, outside in an old campground, after having been informed that the local growers are pretty ruthless about strangers nosing around their crops. A little thing I know, but with all of the talent and creative creature designs applied here, they could have given the ""grown-ups"" some better characterization.",1018310400,,1076,4.7287234042553195

7836593,4,6303063772,"For any Seth Green fans, this is one of his early movies.  He plays a teen suffering from post traumatic stress.  From a time he was lost in the woods.  He goes on a cabin trip hoping to overcome that.  Those with him were a jock and his eye candy girlfriend.  A gang like black kid.  A cute girl trapped in own mind.  The group adult chaperones and their daughter.

What the group didn't know was that pot farmers in the the area were using growth steroids on their plants,and that the steroids would mutate the local Wood Ticks.

The Mutated Ticks had a significant increase in size and were capable of crawling inside a host.  Ticks have a nerve toxin in their bite, that numbs the skin, that's why people don't feel the bite.  The mutation increased the toxin to the point where a single bite would cause severe hallucinations.

Early on the filmmakers and cast realized that this was not going to bra good movie and therefore did not try and take it seriously. They made a campy movie that actually manages to be entertaining and I enjoyed every single second of it. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the horror genre.",1473033600,,414,4.1875
