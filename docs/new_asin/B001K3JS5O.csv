She unintentionally creates imaginary friends to help her through her dating funk and keep her company, but her imaginary friends turn out to be snarky and rude-in other words, bitches. But having imaginary friends is anything but easy. They only complicate matters, especially when they can pop up anywhere at any time and constantly insult the ""real"" people in Eden's life. Considering that three of the show's main characters are never actually heard or seen, this short web series is hysterical. The acting is pretty solid and the idea is a strange, never before seen one that, although it would never work as a primetime show, was enjoyable in its small segments. They have taken a situation that anyone can relate to and brought it to its extreme. (The show is currently only one season, thirteen episodes long, with shows ranging from 5-7 minutes in length.)",1308614400,,1030,4.857954545454546
8314209,3,B001K3JS5O,"I liked it mostly for Elizabeth Hendrickson, whom, I think, is really good at comedy. And the dialogues are great. I may be wrong, but I would've liked the idea of imaginary friends better if I could've seen the bitches, rather than hearing them through the character of Eden. Most of the time, I felt like she was a 5 year-old hanging out with adults.",1261094400,,352,4.430769230769231
8314210,5,B001K3JS5O,"I have never written a review on Amazon before but felt compelled to do so because this show is just that amazing and far superior to 99 percent of the reality television which unfortunately takes up prime time network space these days.

Envision if you will...a show where Sex and the City slam dances into Jimmy Stewart's Harvey while talking and walking like the Gilmore Girls' younger sister amped up on Red Bull.

That is Imaginary Bitches.

The irreverent, funny, and sexy series...starring a daytime fan-favorite and daytime Emmy winner, Eden Riegel (All My Children's beloved lesbian Bianca)...takes us along on a roller coaster ride as 'Eden' and her posse of female friends (real and imaginary) are continually debating the coupleness versus non-coupleness issue.

Then there is also the eye-candy...no matter what your gender or which team you play for...you will find a pretty face and a hot bod to oggle and to crush on.  And they are oh, so real.

Besides the show episodes...like any good DVD...there is commentary, interviews, and outtakes.  Well worth watching...you will laugh out loud...and wish the cast would invite you along for pizza and beer night...or over to their place for Guitar Hero.

And last but not least...this is a show with a message...

Embrace your inner bitch!",1231113600,3,1299,5.0327102803738315
8314211,5,B001K3JS5O,"I haven't seen the dvd yet. I just watched the webisodes and they are absolutely hilarious!! I don't know how the cast members can keep such straight faces!! It's not a show for kids and men probably won't like it either. But every woman in the world, single or paired up, gay or straight will understand how Eden feels. I wish I had some umm, ""friends"" of my own to tell it like it is!!!",1229212800,2,388,4.1866666666666665
8314212,5,B001K3JS5O,"Imaginary Bitches is intelligent and funny. It's not dumbed down for audiences and is unapologetic for it's racy edgy humor. A fast paced webseries with episodes lasting between 4 and 9 minutes, Imaginary Bitches has a creative team that packs an enormous amount of entertainment into tight little bundles. Production quality is amazing on it's own, but even more astounding considering the low/no budget Imaginary Bitches had compared to it's studio funded counterparts of the same quality. Literally, I have seen studio endorsed and marketed projects that are less polished and professional looking than Imaginary Bitches. And that's just the episodes. The special features are a treat as well, and add to the experience. There are several instances where you'll stop and say, ""Did they just say what I think they said?"" Rewind, watch it again, and chances are, yes they did just say what you thought they said. Eden, Catherine and Heather will keep you laughing and rewinding and laughing again. I highly recommend this little gem.",1225756800,7,1034,5.160714285714286
