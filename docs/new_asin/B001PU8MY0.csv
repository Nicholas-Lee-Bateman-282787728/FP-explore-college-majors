3762600,3,B001PU8MY0,"my 3 and 5 year old boys have gone thru the whole tv series (other than the cartoons) so i wanted to find more for them to watch.  i guess I should have judged this ""book"" by it's cover?  I spend more time fast forwarding thru the bad parts than it's worth.  not something you can toss in the machine to keep them occupied while you do something else.",1374019200,2,351,4.057971014492754
