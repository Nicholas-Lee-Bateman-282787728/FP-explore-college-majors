8617704,5,B00FPOMRRA,"My wife and I have used this production with our youth group and have found that is excellent for this forum.  The support package with discussion questions, adds a great deal to this film.  While the film is geared to young adults, it works very well with adults.",1383868800,,264,4.479166666666667
8617705,5,B00FPOMRRA,"This is a very entertaining presentation of many of the major arguments for a biblical view of creation, presented clearly and confidently.  At the beginning, they work through a broader range of apologetic issues, which they move through quickly but effectively.  In their treatment of evolution, they clearly distinguish between micro and macro evolution, a point which in my experience is lost in a surprising number of discussions.  The skits are all designed to illustrate a point or an argument, and they do so in an entertaining and effective manner.  It was fun to watch, made me laugh many times, and made me think.  Not a boring moment in the entire presentation.",1382832000,,673,4.973214285714286
8617706,5,B00FPOMRRA,"This DVD is great. It's well-researched and the script is wonderfully fresh. Interested in how the world began? Want to hear about it from both a Biblical and a scientific viewpoint? Then get this DVD. It's fun for both kids and adults -- I've watched it three times already, so clearly I'm not tired of it yet! This is especially great for homeschool families. The sketches are fun and very clearly bring the point across. I highly recommend it.",1381622400,,446,4.658227848101266
