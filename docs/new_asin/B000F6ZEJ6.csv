8118212,3,B000F6ZEJ6,"I had forgot how politically troubled Guatemala is and how horribly human rights have been violated there.  It sounds like what happened in Argentina's past also happened there.  I think by exploring this issue, it may lead to clues as to what's happening in Colombia currently.  They show a man getting burnt alive and my jaw almost hit the ground.

This documentary discusses the problems and how they are continuing.  It has a mix of academics, theologians, and actual affected Guatemalans.  The interviewees are diverse, having not just white men, but also a white woman and an Asian-American man.

What leaves me skeptical is the religious aspect.  Yes, religion affects most people and churches can play a great role in advancing human rights.  However, I still wonder if this work praises Christians more than other people.  The documentary says one Guatemalan leader helped mestizos, but punished the Mayans.  This work pats both Catholics and Protestants on the back, but what about Guatemalans who practice indigenous or syncretic faiths?

This work would be great for Latin American studies and International Relations majors.  Also, supporters of Amnesty International may love it.",1182297600,2,1193,5.248677248677248
