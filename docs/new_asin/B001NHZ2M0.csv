8327037,5,B001NHZ2M0,"Well, if I'm reviewing the quality of the product itself, it is near perfect. The dvd contains the program that I was hoping it would when I purchased it. The case which holds the dvd does so admirably.  The only thing that grinds my gears is that there is no option in the dvd menu to play the entire game. At the end of each quarter you are redirected to the menu and you have to press play for each following quarter. Kind of a buzzkill...

If I'm reviewing the game, then I'd say that there are no words to describe the awesomeness of this game.",1383696000,,549,4.169811320754717
8327038,5,B001NHZ2M0,product was just as described.  shipping was secure and package arrived with no damage.  Product actually arrived almost a week before originally suspected.  DVD is great quality and what a great game to watch!  Another example of how the BCS DOESN'T work.,1323648000,,256,5.023809523809524
8327039,5,B001NHZ2M0,"If you enjoy college football, this is a bowl game to watch.  When the sports' public opinion polls clearly had the #1 ranked Utes as the under-under-under dogs, this game was expected to be a no brainer.  However, in the first 5 minutes alone, Utah's offense was explosive.  At half time, the sports analysts were wondering what had happened & how Alabama was going to reve up & make a grand come back. That never happened. What this game is about is not only how skilled a team & its coach is, but it's about how mentally prepared are they, what have they experienced together as a team and what a winning attitude can accomplish.

Yes, the U of Utah, Mnt West Conference champions, were the only undefeated division 1 football team in the country, & yes their schedule may not have been the toughest, but they had their challenges. It takes discipline to stay undefeated. It's easy to get complacent & we've seen the big league teams go down to unexpected opponents. Congratulations to the Utah Utes once again!  Their second BCS bust was a huge success & you can bet (then FL) Coach Urban Meyers saw it coming!",1312675200,2,1114,4.55
8327040,5,B001NHZ2M0,"This is the starting game to make the statement to the BCS, that they must establish a play off system. If the game it's self is to repersent  caritor building, self respect, and  the beleaf in ones self. Then the BCS must stand for these same quilities in it's self. This Game made the first foot print stating that never and I mean never count anyone OUT.
BCS in your views you have let the American people down for what American stands for. That's anybody or anyone can in America.  Both Utah and Bosie accomplished what America stands for. All they needed was the oppatunity to accomplish the American Dream. BCS Think America! that some Americans still hold on to ""BELEAVE IN AMERICA""!!
BCS playoff Not play downs. The little man can and his over and over.",1272067200,,761,4.54014598540146
8327041,1,B001NHZ2M0,"Enjoy it while you can Utah, This will be the best you can do. Also no one expected Alabama to do near as well as they did, so you do not have a lot to brag about. If Utah was in the S.E.C their record would be 6-6 at best...So enjoy the moment !",1234483200,,246,3.574074074074074
8327042,5,B001NHZ2M0,"Reviewers and so called ""FANS"" need to realize that if they are real fans of the Utah program they WILL buy this dvd and rub it in the face of an SEC fan because it seams like that is all that exists now are fans of a conference... If you knew your football you would know that this is the Utah logo, and please, please so called football fans, STOP CRYING, my team has been beaten 3 years straight in BCS games, twice in the big one by convincing leads, but this does not stop me from watching my team play year after year. I love the fact that this game and games like Boise State and Oklahoma a couple years ago proves that no matter what conference you play in any team given a chance and well prepared can beat the ""BIG DOG"" on any given day. Congrats to Utah on this win, you may feel snubbed for not getting the title shot, but hey there is always next year, and hopefully within the next few years they will figure out a better way to determine the nations best teams other than this crappy computer system that only works out for the FAT greedy owners of these conferences who have everything to prove to the world.",1231977600,3,1124,4.184331797235023
8327043,1,B001NHZ2M0,"The publishers of this DVD need to know that by creating a product that features only 1 of the 2 teams and worse yet featuring the looser, noone will buy this. No Utah fan will touch it because of this serious snub. Alabama fans won't buy it because they looked pretty bad. I hope the publishers eat it.
