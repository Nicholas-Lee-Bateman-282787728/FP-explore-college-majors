5111537,5,B007VI74VM,"This is a review of the DVD released in the UK on the 18th of June 2012.
This is absolutely great. To be honest, it is not really scary to a modern viewer, at least the daleks aren't really scary (the epsilons actually are in first instance) but what a wonderful experience to watch. It's all in the details, like the Tardis module used for target practice, the chase along the city where both the doctor and the daleks manage to find solutions to all the traps and puzzles (who cares that part of it is story filling), the cute little Balal (what a great character, and that in a zeventies story generally not too focused on characterisation of the participants). I very much enjoyed watching it, even if some of the effects are a little dated. Not so much though as in day of the daleks where they actually added an enhanced version on the DVD. That is not necessary here. There are enough Daleks to make it believable. And isn't it great to see wonderful Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane here. And though some some reviewers state that she is not her plucky self here, I have to disagree. Yes, she does scream once in a while, but on the other hand she manages to come up with a good idea to decieve the Daleks by herself, and manages to execute it too. And isn't the nervous breakdown that eventuelly kills, of the Dalek who finds himself a failure an absolute wonder? Over reaction perhaps, but so excellently carried out. I can recommend this to any Dalek fan, Classic Who fan (and also fans of the new series because I like both too), and of course to all admirers of the third doctor and Sarah Jane Smith.",1340150400,3,1611,4.391304347826087
5111538,2,B007VI74VM,"Jon Pertwee's run on Doctor Who is my favorite era of Dr. Who (old and new) but Death to the Daleks is the single worst story from his era (though most fans will probably disagree with me and say Time Monster is the worst of Pertwee's). The main problem is that the story has really really good idea but sadly doesn't really do a lot with them. For example, the idea of the Daleks' weapons being rendered powerless and having to work with the Doctor/other human character to survive is an interesting idea that could have lead to a different kind of Dalek story than Who fans are use to (you know, the Daleks trying to take over a planet or some such and the Doctor beating them). The Daleks, while the most popular villians are also the most overused villians and after Day of the Daleks and Planet of the Dalkes, the Third Doctor didn't really need another Dalek story. At first I liked the twist of the Daleks and Doctor teaming up. But that idea is thrown away before the half point of the story (the Daleks change their weapons from a death ray to just simple bullets) and it becomes a typical Dalek story, with the Daleks enslaving the locals and taking over their planet, which has been done to death before Jon Pertwee ever took on the Doctor role.

Pretty much the whole run down of the story is like this (SPOILERS):
Ep 1 - Doctor and Sarah land on wrong planet (again!) and find humans looking for cure of horrible disease that is whipping out life in the universe (this plot is forgotten about the half way point and is not brough up again until the very end). Sarah is kidnapped by locals of the planet who plan to sarifice her to their ""god"" which is a ""living"" buidling. The episode ends with the Daleks showing up.

Ep 2 - The Daleks weapons don't work so they have to team up with the Doctor and the scientists to find a way off the planet (the living building is causing the scienist space ship, Dalek's ship and weapons, the even the Tardis to stop working all together). This episode is pretty interesting until the Daleks give themselves bullets and begin taking over the planet. This is where it become a run of the mill Dalek story.

Ep 3 - More the same Daleks being evil while humans try to fight them and the Doctor trys to out wit them stuff that all Who fans have seen way too many times. The story starts getting interesting again towards the end when the Doctor and a local of the planet decide to go into the living building to turn it off. But the ""heart"" of the building is located beyond several puzzles that one can get past if they use their minds and logic to figure out some sort of puzzle. I really liked this idea of a living building that has a several of puzzles/traps that have to be crossed for people to turn it off. The story could have used more of a focus on this and less on the Daleks.

Ep 4 - This and episode 2 are the good parts of the story, more or less. This one is made up of mostly the Doctor going through more puzzles before eventually turning off the buidling, defeating the Dalks (again!), helping the scienists find the cure for the ""killing all life in the universe"" disease which was basically fogotten about after episode 1, and than heading off to more adventures with Sarah.

SPOILERS END

This story had two really good and interesting ideas but they are over shadowed by the Daleks' present. Any alien creature could have been put in place of them and it still would have worked. If they had to use a popular past villian, then the Cybermen would have been a better choose just because the Third Doctor never had a story with them in it as villians and they had not been used for five years at this point. The Daleks feel so shoed in and pointless to the story outside episode 2, which is a shame. This could have been a very different and original story.",1337040000,10,3825,4.327754532775454
5111539,4,B007VI74VM,"This a pretty good episode of Dr. Who. The Daleks seem to show more initiative than I usually give them credit for. When their standard laser make-you-disappear weapons don't work, they fit themselves out with old-fashioned mechanical guns and even practice on a model TARDIS (which they must carry with them for fun?!).

""Death to the Daleks"" originally aired in 1974. Story Synopsis:  The TARDIS has (yet another) glitch, goes off course, and ends up on the planet of Exxilon. Something drains the TARDIS' power, and they're stranded. The Doctor and Sarah Jane leave to investigate. The Doctor meets up with a similarly stranded Marine Space Corp patrol. They came to Exxilon to gather the element parrinium, the only known antidote to a massive plague that is sweeping the galaxy.

Sarah Jane is fascinated with a giant white building with a beacon flashing on top. She is captured by a group of native Exxilons, who say she has defiled their city and must die. Unbeknownst to her, the Doctor has joined forces with the Marines and with a group of similarly stranded Daleks - a tentative truce indeed, as the Doctor states, ""Inside each of those shells is a living, bubbling lump of hate.""

The Doctor stops Sarah's execution, and the two escape through some tunnels. In the tunnels they meet Bellal, one of a group of exiled Exxilon's who do not worship the white City, they are afraid of it. The Doctor realizes that it is the beacon that is draining energy from the TARDIS and other ships, and he and Bellal set out to stop it.

In the meanwhile, the Dalek's have outfitted themselves with mechanical weapons not affected by the power drain - and they want to capture the parrinium. They are the cause of the space plague, their special extermination plan, and don't want the antidote to leave Exxilon.

The July 2012 DVD release will be the first time ""Death to the Daleks"" is issued on DVD. It will be on one disc, with remastered picture and sound. Extras:

1.  Commentary - with actor Julian Fox (who plays Peter Hamilton, Marine Lieutenant), Cy Town (one of the Dalek operators), Michael E Briant (director), Richard Leyland (assistant floor manager), L Rowland Warne (costume designer) and Dick Mills (special sounds maestro). The interview is moderated by Toby Hadoke.
(Added after my DVD was received and watched:)  I enjoyed this commentary, but then I usually do enjoy the Dr. Who commentaries. Opinions were divided on Jon Pertwee - he was either difficult to work with, or, as this serial's director thought, the favorite of the Doctor actors.  The costumer talked about how he created the Exxilon costumes, which are not made of cloth. The idea was to blend into the background. They worked so well that when two extras fell asleep on the outdoor quarry location (what would Dr. Who have done without quarries in which to shoot?!!), people ran around looking for them and couldn't find them.
2.  ""Beneath the City of the Exxilons - Making Death to the Daleks"" - The cast and crew look back on the making of this story. Participants are Arnold Yarrow (who plays Bellal), Julian Fox (Peter Hamilton), Michael E. Briant (director), Richard Leyland (assistant floor manager), L Rowland Warne (costume designer) and fan and Dalek voice artist Nick Briggs.
(Added after DVD received:) I liked this; the extra is presented as a Dalek documentary. Nick Briggs' is shown with the title, ""World's Biggest Death to the Daleks Fan"", but he later tells us how he is more than that. He currently voices the Daleks for the new Who's (versus Classic Who's) and he is also Executive Producer of Big Finish, the company who creates the audio Dr. Who serials.  He also does the Dalek voice for this extra ""documentary"". He is fun to listen to, starting when he was a kid and LOVED this episode.
3.  Studio Recording - A rare glimpse into the production of a Third Doctor story.
(Added after DVD received:) Dated 12/4/73, this is a day in the life of recording some scenes on the inside sets. The young director tried something different, he filmed the serial by set (all scenes that would take place on that set recorded at one time, then on to the next set), which is how most movies are shot. Most of the TV shows, not just Dr. Who, were shot chronologically, so it was a little confusing for the actors until they got used to it.
4.  ""On the Set of Dr. Who and the Daleks"" - Behind the scenes on the first Dalek film shot in 1965.
(added after DVD received:) This is about the filming of the movie with Peter Cushing. Commentators are Marcus Hearn (film and TV historian), Jason Flemyng (actor), Anthony Waye (first assistant director) and Bryan Hands (Dalek operator).
5. ""Doctor Who Stories - Dalek Men"". This is an extra I didn't know about until I watched the DVD. This is about the men who operated the Daleks, gleaned from 2003 interviews. Commentators include John Scott Martin and Nicholas Evans.

I can't do justice to this episode more than any other reviewer, and can only recommend you stick around to the very end where the Doctor and one of the locals navigate a building filled with various fatal intelligence tests.

5111542,4,B007VI74VM,"The Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) and Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) are planning a beach holiday but the TARDIS crash lands on the planet Exxilon. All the electrical power systems have been drained, so the Doctor lights an oil lamp (he has one in a cabinet) and they head out. The planet is a bleak wasteland populated by mysterious humanoids who attack and/or kidnap any aliens. The Doctor and Sarah Jane run into some humans who've come to the planet for a special element that will cure a disease infecting millions of people from the outer rim planets. Their ship is also powered down but they were able to send a distress signal before losing all power. They hear a ship coming and they hope it is the rescue ship. When the new ship lands, out come the Daleks! The Daleks have also lost power and they are forced to ally with the humans to solve their problems. Naturally, the Daleks make bad allies, but are they worse than the Exxilons?

The episode has an intriguing premise that plays out slowly but creatively. The uneasy alliance with the Daleks creates some nice tension (obviously the Daleks will turn on them the first chance they get, but how soon?) and the locals have an interesting culture. As is common on the old Doctor Who, the visual effects aren't always the best but the sound design is excellent. It's an enjoyable story and worth watching.",1437091200,,1368,4.62962962962963

An interesting if not unusual narrative where by the Daleks are stranded on the planet with their ship and all their weapons drained of power. They have to agree a truce with the humans, who find themselves in a similar situation, and work together to try to find a way to overcome their power loss and escape from the planet. Both groups are in the vicinity due to the need to find a rare mineral that can cure a plague that is threatening both species. Of course the Daleks have no intention of keeping the peace and co-operating for the collective good. As soon as they can they quickly try to gain the upper hand. Then throw into this mix a TARDIS and its occupants.

This adventure has well-acted human characters, great performances from Jon Pertwee and Elisabeth Sladen in the lead roles and interesting use of the Daleks. The natives, the Exxilons are decent background characters with an approachable Exxilon providing an affable alien who is a well-rounded character in `his' own right. There is plenty of rawkus - action and mayhem and the use of the ubiquitous quarry scenes for the external shots. The 'roots' of the city are an attention-grabbing idea and very well thought-out especially the use of the defensive cybernetic appendages - very reminiscent of the 1950s film War of the Worlds Manta Ray-shaped Martian war machines in especially it's `head design'. The incidental music (OST) was both interesting and gelled well with the celluloid - lending an extra layer of the uncanniness of the whole situation. However, some of the other SFX does not bear well with the passage of time (no pun intended).

On first viewing in my earliest childhood I found it spooky as hell - but thoroughly captivating. On seeing it again in 2014 it is still entertaining, however, I can safely sit on the sofa and not behind it as did all those years ago.",1418774400,,1872,4.718654434250764

5111550,5,B007VI74VM,"This is a story with multiple layers. Jon Pertwee has always been a favorite doctor with me, and stories like this are the reason why. It's a solid story, with solid acting. This is a well written story of power loss, a race divided, a space mission for medical material, and daleks.

***Spoiler Alert***
The doctor and Sarah Jane Smith land on a planet(mistakenly) that drains all of the power from the Tardis. As they seek out the source of the power drain, they are drawn into a world with primitives and intellectuals. Eventually, the doctor meets a downed space mission, also suffering power loss. They are on a humanitarian mission to find Perineum a substance that will cure millions. The primitives have been killing the humans from the mission little by little. While this is happening, Sarah finds a city, unfortunately the same city that the primitives worship. The primitives find her and decide to sacrifice her for defiling their alter of worship. The doctor and the crew of the space mission are captured by the primitives and he intervenes with Sarah's sacrifice. Delaying her sacrifice. When the primitives decide to sacrifice both the doctor and Sarah, the daleks intervene with a new means of killing, projectiles like bullets. After all, they do not have energy. It is determined that the energy is being siphoned off by the city. The humans make a deal with the daleks to help each other and destroy the city, as well as collect perineum together. A deal the daleks do not intend to keep. As the daleks interfere with the sacrifice of the doctor and Sarah Jane, they inadvertently allow them to escape. They escape into the tunnels where Sarah Jane meets a non-primitive who eventually meets the doctor. His name is Balall. Balall explains to the doctor that his people built the city. The doctor decides to enter the city to turn off the power drain. Does he succeed? Do the humans get the Perineum, or do the daleks get it? You will have to buy this dvd to find out.

***Spoiler Alert Over***

This was a wonderful entry into the Jon Pertwee era of Doctor Who. As always JP was at his best, proving he was a great choice to play the doctor. I highly recommend this dvd for your collection.

5111559,5,B007VI74VM,"First off, the Daleks are one of my favorite bad guys and Jon Pertwee is also a favorite of mine, not just as the Doctor but as a actor.  I like the idea of a living city, even if it was inorganic in structure, and the acting was not that bad.  I also like that the Daleks have tiny a TARDIS for target practice!  Yes, the planet of Exxilon seems boring and lifeless.  Yes, the natives look like something a five year old created.  The idea that they would blend into the cave walls and sometimes glow seemed to be a interesting idea that does not REALLY comes across very well on the small screen.  The special effects were, after all, BBC 1970's special effects so there is that.  The maze to get into the city isn't half bad and the idea of aliens just visiting Earth is refreshing when compared to all the aliens who seem to have either tried to invade it or crash landed on it.  How do you not see a planet?  Were you adjusting the radio?  Er...back to topic.
The plot is simple.  The planet has a special mineral that can save lives but also has a dangerous city that drains power from ship engines and weapons (but not from Daleks - they move with the power of their MINDS).  Both the humans and Daleks have trapped themselves on the planet and now have to work together to mine the mineral and save themselves.  Sadly the Daleks in this story don't seem very dangerous.  They have to replace their energy weapons with bullet shooters that make Wild West Gun Shot noises, they huddle together and debate a lot in whispers, and they get beat up by backwater natives when not being killed by the roots of the city.  One even blows himself up.  Of course, it was meant to be the last Dalek story ever.  Which is why it was called Death of the Daleks.  I happen to love this story but to be honest, if I wasn't a Dalek fan I don't think I find it that interesting.  I am going to give it five stars but a Non-Dalek fan should take away two and think of it as more of a three star story with interesting ideas but a somewhat weak delivery.",1365638400,4,2041,4.200514138817481

Well, it's not. It's a charming Terry Nation classic with actual alien-looking aliens, likable (and unlikable) supporting characters, and great moments for the Daleks. As it's four-parts it doesn't drag much, with Dalek moments spread throughout, not too much, but a perfect balance. Sarah Jane is well-written with good lines and as a companion that's not there to be a damsel (or dude, depending on the situation) in distress, while Jon Pertwee is on his usual fine acting. Plus, silver is one of my favorite Dalek paint jobs so that increases the awesomeness of the deadly pepper shakers in this one.

As for the bonus features; the behind-the-scenes documentary ""Beneath the City of the Exxilons"" is great and informative, with ""Doctor Who Stories - Dalek Men"" being the same thing. The rest are classics as well.

So in all, a 4/5 release that is sure to please a Doctor Who fan or Dalek lover (like me).

5111567,3,B007VI74VM,"""Death to the Daleks"" was one more Dalek adventure set in a quarry in Jon Pertwee's last season as the Doctor, but the story had a topical basis and included enough creative flourishes to make it interesting if not quite a landmark in the series.

On their way to a much-deserved holiday on the planet Florana, the Doctor and Sarah make a forced landing on the forbidding, fogbound planet Exxilon when the TARDIS suffers an inexplicable power failure. There the Doctor meets a scientific expedition from Earth also stranded by a mysterious force that consumes all electric power on the planet. The Earth expedition is mining the planet for ""parrinium,"" the only known cure for a fatal space plague that has struck humans living on Earth's outer colony planets. Meanwhile, Sarah discovers a magnificent white citadel topped with a shining beacon but is captured by the Exxilons and prepared for sacrifice for defiling their holy city. Then a Dalek ship lands on the planet, also seeking parrinium, and the robotic creatures are forced into an alliance with the humans because their weapons don't work without electric power (the Daleks themselves, the Doctor reminds us, are powered by psychokinetic energy).

Miners' strikes in the early 1970s were causing intermittent power failures in the United Kingdom about the time Terry Nation wrote the script for ""Death to the Daleks,"" so the British people were no strangers to lights out when the story first aired in early 1974. In fact, series rehearsals at Acton had to be scheduled around the power outages. Exterior shooting took place at a quarry near Lulworth Cove in Dorsetshire--a barren landscape to match Exxilon's lifeless terrain--but costume designer L. Rowland Warne turned this liability into an asset by carefully matching the colors of the Exxilons' cloaks to the various shades of sand and rock found in the quarry. The Exxilons thereby blended into the landscape, making them invisible to outsiders (two actors were, in fact, briefly lost when they fell asleep on location in Exxilon costumes). Unfortunately, the costumes got wet in pond scenes and had to be dried with electric heaters overnight to avoid tearing their delicate fabric.

Costume design for the subterranean Exxilons who live in caves under the city was subtly different but equally imaginative, and Arnold Yarrow turns in the story's best performance as Bellal, the Exxilon who guides the Doctor to the city and explains its fateful origins. (Yarrow, a diminutive actor, says he based his performance largely on the behavior of bushbabies and other small, big-eyed primates.) Here the story is padded with scenes of the Doctor and Bellal solving potentially fatal brain teasers as they approach the city's central brain.

The Special Features menu includes a workmanlike, 27-minute making-of documentary as well as a 23-minute studio recording showing how cast and crew taped the story set by set rather than in chronological scene order, an innovation imposed by director Michael E. Briant. Also included are interviews featuring the long-suffering men inside the Daleks. Such interviews are becoming a treasured resource as more and more cast and crew from the classic series, which debuted almost a half century ago, are lost to old age.",1344038400,2,3273,5.146616541353383
5111568,5,B007VI74VM,"In the Jon Pertwee era of Doctor Who entitled ""Death to the Daleks"".  The Doctor is taking Sarah on a holiday to a pleasure world.  While enroute Sarah notices a strange light flashing on the console of the TARDIS.  The Doctor recognizes the signal as that of power failure something the TARDIS doesn't experience very often.  Regardless the Doctor uses what power is left and lands on the planet in which the power is being drained from.  With the TARDIS powerless and resorting to basic tools to even get out of the TARDIS.
  While searching the strange alien landscape they encounter a bright beautiful city that pulses with light. The Doctor belives the city and its strange light is what is causing the power drain.  But he doesn't know how or why.  Moving on the Doctor and Sarah are seprated and Sarah is captured by the local life forms that worship the city and demand that she be sacrificed.  While the Doctor comes across a stranded marine space core whose mission is to go to the planet Exxlion and find a mineral that is the only cure to a plauge that is hitting the colonies of Earth.  While the Doctor and the team try to find a way to find Sarah and help each other they encounter another ship landing on the planet and those that have come are the Daleks.  Like the humans the daleks also need the mineral to save themselves.  However with the same power loss they to must find a way and come to an agreement.
  Sarah held cpative is freed by another of the same species who instead of worshipping the city they fear it and strive to destroy it one day.  Taking her deep into the catacombs she convinces them that the Doctor is the only one who can.  All that plus the daleks wiating for the moment to betray the Doctor and the marines once they have what they need.  A city that wants power and wants more all this plus the dark secerts that lay within and the threat of the Daleks that looms before all.  So check out ""Death of the Daleks"" to find out.
  Also of note since the release of this title this is the first time it has been made availabe in the episodic format unlike its pervious vhs version that was one of the first generation of Doctor Who vide tapes way back when and spliced as a single adventure.",1343779200,,2233,4.358353510895884

DEATH TO THE DALEKS
Story # 72
Season 11's Third Story
Third Doctor, Jon Perwee Era, final season 1973-74
Third Classic Sarah Jane Smith Story

OVERALL STORY RATING 7/10
In Elisabeth Sladen's opinion, DEATH TO THE DALEKS was always an underrated and overlooked story.  I agree totally with her assessment. I was pleasantly surprised to find DEATH TO THE DALEKS a very well-paced and entertaining story, full of interesting and unusual Sci-Fi concepts, as well as being a very unique Dalek story.  Other than some very minor acting or special effects bobbles, DEATH TO THE DALEKS is a solid story and production.

It is entirely possible that the main reason DEATH TO THE DALEKS is not well-remembered among WHO fans is because the musical track is unusual in its support or enhancement of the story.  The music at times, seems to take the viewer's attention away from the story, rather than enhancing a scene the way a good score can. This is not to say the music score is bad, just that it is unusual, and for that reason may actually distract the viewer at times.

Essential viewing for SARAH JANE ADVENTURES fans, and a very interesting, unusual Dalek story for veteran Whovians.  This is also a good story to introduce a novice to WHO, as the interior TARDIS scenes are very educational for someone unfamiliar with WHO.

STORY & SCRIPT 8/10
One of Terry Nation's more interesting and unusual Dalek scripts, making for a rare one-of-a-kind Dalek story.  As GENESIS OF THE DALEKS is a unique story in that it details the creation of the Daleks, DEATH TO THE DALEKS is likewise a unique Dalek story, albeit a bit less riveting than GENESIS OF THE DALEKS. Only a few stories can be ""masterpiece shows"" as is GENESIS OF THE DALEKS.  But a story can still be excellent, interesting, and unique even if not quite a masterpiece, and that is precisely the story DEATH TO THE DALEKS is.  Daleks with disabled energy weapons, forced into an alliance with humans, at least until weapons can be devised that will allow Daleks to overpower all opposition.  The planet, city, its inhabitants and energy-parasitic nature are imaginative, creative story concepts.  The Doctor forced to outwit the self-learning, self-defending computer that controls the city and enslaves the Exxilons is also a creative, unusual concept.

ACTING 7/10
Jon Pertwee and Elisabeth Sladen are 10/10, shining as the Third Doctor and Sarah Jane, having great rapport, and subtle closeness and affection between them. Sarah is noticeably not quite as independent and self-assured here as in her previous two stories.  BUT this is Sarah's first visit to an alien world, and Elisabeth Sladen deserves much credit for realistically giving Sarah less self-assurance and more apprehension in such new circumstances. The guest cast is very good for the most part.  Joy Harrison is ""acting"" as Jill Tarrant, rather than ""being"" Jill Tarrant, but Duncan Lamont as Galloway is superb and helps balance out that small weakness.  The other actors range from ""excellent"" to ""good"" for overall respectable performances.

PRODUCTION QUALITY 9/10
Very high production value. The location and studio sets are well shot and create a believable alien atmosphere.  The CSO shots all come off very well with few noticeable problems. Most model work is excellent.  The Dalek spaceship is likely the weakest model work, and it isn't bad in all honesty. Overall a well produced, well-edited story, with only a tiny weakness or two in model work and acting. The music doesn't really aid the story in the way a good score should, and is the most glaring technical fault. The DVD scenes shot on video are incredibly sharp, clear and colorful, making it hard to believe the scenes were shot back in 1973!  The outdoor location scenes, shot on 16mm film as was the custom of 1973 production, are noticeably grainy and less sharp then the video.

SPECIAL EFFECTS 8/10
Special effects are well-done and hold up well even nearly 40 years later. Nothing spectacular, but the Exxilon city is a remarkable bit of model work and the CSO is practically flawless.  So special effects are well above average.

STORY IMPORTANCE 6/10
The Daleks disabled and forced into temporary alliance with humans is unusual enough in WHO history to bump this story up in importance to be just a tiny bit above average.

DVD EXTRAS 10/10
Superb across the board, as is wonderfully typical of most Classic Doctor Who DVD releases. Commentary is excellent and very informative, as is the on screen text information by Martin Wiggins, and both are well worth the viewer's attention.  BENEATH THE CITY OF THE EXXILONS is an excellent documentary on the making of DEATH TO THE DALEKS, and the documentary helps the viewer see the often maligned story in a more sympathetic light.  There is an amazing 23 minute behind-the-scenes clip of some studio recording of DEATH TO THE DALEKS, that looks as if it were shot last week. And do not overlook the wonderful Photo Gallery.

These wonderful DVD extras are what make Classic WHO DVD's such special treats, so DO NOT overlook them as you will be losing a tremendous portion of the enormous value of a Classic WHO DVD!
