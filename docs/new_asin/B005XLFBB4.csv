I recommend the Boston Blackie movie series and highly recommend the contact used to order this film.  You won't be sorry!!!!",1339718400,4,299,5.1875

8488682,3,B005XLFBB4,"The purposely confusing plot of this mystery is not helped by the steady hiss and crackle heard throughout (not to mention the occasional `snow' storm of compromised imagery).  The DVD-R transfer is middling to poor in quality.

A couple on their honeymoon are expected to set that aside so the husband (Chester Morris as Detective Campbell) can solve several mysteries too many in this semi-comical offering from 1941.  What starts as a simple missing person complaint soon turns into a case of mistaken identity, a couple of murders, and a high speed car chase that ends in a shootout.  Somewhere along the way, a couple of FBI agents show up when the case involves an infamous mobster (Dick Purcell as Red Harris).  There's slapstick comedy thrown in and a few bumbling cops.  At least the poor put-upon wife of the detective (Jean Parker) gets a mink coat out of this slight detour.  But if this was any indication of what marriage to this danger magnet was going to be, she should have asked for more than a coat!

I got the sense that something was missing from this version of the film.  There are multiple references made to things not shown in this movie, but brought up as though they were.  Otherwise, it's mildly entertaining (mostly the comic bits involving Jean Parker).",1433462400,,1284,4.743243243243243
8488683,3,B005XLFBB4,"It was ""OK"" but that is not saying much for the 'film' itself. Chester Morris is surrounded by a passle of ""B"" movie folks.",1430870400,,123,4.166666666666667
8488684,1,B005XLFBB4,"This Alpha copy is worse than the YouTube version. I had hoped to be able to gain a better copy by purchasing this DVD.  The YouTube version was murky, dark, sometimes totally black but for a couple pinpricks of light. Then too there was a huge amount of film noise and image flares which certainly makes for difficult viewing.  It was pretty awful.  Alpha was in no respect better. Not a jot. Absolutely no cleanup has been attempted on the Alpha copy. Worse yet, the Alpha version is missing 4.5 minutes from the beginning of the film!  In a word, horrible. Ok. Two words: absolutely horrible. Don't waste your money as I did on this video junk.",1416096000,2,647,4.504273504273504
8488685,4,B005XLFBB4,"I like Chester Morris and this movie is a good ""B"" movie of his.
Overall good acting.
The picture quality is not the best, but Alpha Video, has the better copy out there.",1379635200,,170,4.181818181818182
8488686,4,B005XLFBB4,"For fans of the great Rod Cameron is worth purchase this DVD, his role is small but important to the plot.

I do recommned it.",1365811200,,126,4.04
8488687,2,B005XLFBB4,"I thought this was Boston Blackie, Chester Morris played Blackie and this came up when I was looking for Blackie.  It's not and it's not really very good. I wouldn't reccommend it.",1357171200,,180,4.625
8488688,1,B005XLFBB4,"Just when you thought the DVD market couldn't get any worse, apparently Alpha is burning copies of their new DVDs. My copy of this film arrived and it was DVD-R. People on the DVD Bargain Forum are reporting the same problem with new discs from Alpha. The nice thing about Alpha before this was the material may be grade B, but at least you were getting a pressed copy. True no more. Alpha - If you are listening, your public domain material on a burned disc is worth almost exactly a quarter, not seven bucks.",1347408000,13,510,4.378947368421053
