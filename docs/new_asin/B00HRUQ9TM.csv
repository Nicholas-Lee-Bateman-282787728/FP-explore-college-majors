6201531,5,B00HRUQ9TM,"what wasn't mentioned in the movie was that this army/ navy venture was the first since the civil war and the war of the iron clad ships. Lincoln said of those army personal attached to the navy were his ""web footed soldiers"".  I was in Charlie's sister company and wish more credit was given to the other companies that suffered the same hell. the show was spot on and not exaggerated. I will be buying this for my service memorabilia.",1396828800,7,436,4.45
6201532,5,B00HRUQ9TM,"I had the honor of attending 2 of Charlie company's reunions. a couple of weeks ago I was there for the Full military burial of their beloved Lieutenant at Arlington National Cemmetary with full honors. I saw the movie with them, their wives, and children and was moved to the core. This movie accurately depicts their evolution from surfers, farmers, Beach boy lovers, and Cheer leader chasers into Soldier of the 9 th Infantry division,4th of the 47th, Charlie company. This movie chronicles the transition into veterans of a war that changed them profoundly, and made them question everything that they believed and held dear.  Seeing their bothers die or be injured, Not knowing  whether they would die a miserable death, if they would be a coward  and let their brothers down, or if they would see their families and new borns again. This movie is a testament to them and all soldiers in war and their families
I can attest to the fact that these are some of the finest men that have served our country, and they are not looking for anything in return, except maybe a thank you and a free beer, now and again.

6201533,5,B00HRUQ9TM,"Having read the book, ""The Boys of '67"", I knew the story, but seeing it was amazing. It was hard to watch and wonderful at the same time.  I finally got to see the REAL story of Vietnam instead of the Hollywood version by folks who had never been there. I loved the way the interviews were interspersed throughout and the documentary style with ""flashbacks"" to the states and what was happening there during the war.  My husband was there the next year (December 1967 - December 1968) and it is hard for him to describe the experience.  This made it all make sense and explained much of the PTSD that so many of the Veterans suffer.  This movie was extremely well done. It made it all the more personal as I know Bill Reynolds and have met a couple of the other men of Charlie Company.  So glad NatGeo took this on and did such a great job of the telling!!!! Cannot give enough praise for this video/story of Vietnam.  I especially liked when John Young said "" Don't be smug about your morality until you've had it tested"". Ending with a tribute to Jack Benedick was perfect. I'm sorry he didn't get to see the end result. God Bless all our Veterans, especially those from the Vietnam War.",1396051200,14,1190,4.386363636363637
6201534,5,B00HRUQ9TM,"I really got caught up in this non Hollywood account of Charlie Company. Of course, I wasn't there, but with the realism and overall look of the film I felt at times I was. I  kept checking the time left, because I wanted to see more. Sort of a weird thing with the death of war and wanting to see more.  Because the film was done so damn well!  People don't  always realize what kind of bond soldiers  carry with them for the rest of their lives.  Especially these MEN of Charlie Company. Obviously I loved it!!!!!

6201535,5,B00HRUQ9TM,"After decades of nauseating Vietnam movies, where directors took artistic liberties to depict a war that they never participated in, we finally have Brothers In War, which nails it right in the center. Bulls eye. The combat footage is raw and riveting, taking a veteran right back into a fray that for most seems like a dream. The sober reflective narratives of the soldiers who were interviewed also had a dream like quality to them as these men were trying to understand, after all these years, just what the hell happened, how they survived their year in combat, and how they so casually returned to sanity after the savagery that they had endured with one another. The graphic color, jolting sounds, and fast pace of the war is brilliantly captured, and produced. The 2 hour film seemed to last 5 minutes for me, so mesmerized I was, left in a fog when it was over. This is the definitive film of Vietnam. All others pale in comparison. Brilliant.",1395964800,19,951,4.666666666666667
6201536,5,B00HRUQ9TM,I have seen several accounts of Vietnam and Brothers In War is the best in capturing the brotherhood of Charlie Company and the hell they experienced. Being a member of Charlie Co I am not prejudice. However the gripping details of combat captured in this documentary depicts what so many troopers experienced in Viet Nam and upon their return home.  Our story is their story! May God always bless the USA and the brave men and women who defend our country.,1395964800,16,457,4.6419753086419755
6201537,5,B00HRUQ9TM,"This film is compelling in its realistic portrayal of the men of Charlie Company who fought for their country by patrolling the Mekong Delta,seeking the enemy Viet Cong who threatened the freedom of South Vietnam. As an Army Nurse stationed at 3rd Field Hospital, Saigon, I cared for one of the men in the film, Lt. Jack Benedict. He lost both legs traumatically while on his second tour of duty in 1969. I never knew what war was like ""out in the field""; how soldiers became injured, maimed or killed. I refused to watch any films about war until last week. Out of respect for the memory of Major Jack Benedict and the men from Charlie Company, I attended the premier showing of ""Brothers of War"" in Washington, D.C. at National Geographic's headquarters. I am filled with gratitude to and admiration of the men of Charlie Company and all who served in Vietnam for their tenacity, loyalty, fortitude and dedication to duty and country.
Thank you to Andrew Wiest for writing the book ""The Boys of '67"", to Lou Reda Productions for transforming the written word into a meaningful, accurate documentary, and to National Geographic for bringing the film to the publics' enlightenment.",1395878400,13,1181,4.822660098522167
6201538,5,B00HRUQ9TM,This film not only tells the story of charlie company but the story of all soldiers and sailors that were sent to that hell hole.

6201591,5,B00HRUQ9TM,"I was not yet born during the peak of the Vietnam war, however my two uncles had toured in Vietnam. One died in combat and the other might as well had as his soul was forever lost in that war. We never talked about the time he served over there, what he saw or did; instead we saw the distance in his eyes or the forced smiles and were even awoken in the middle of the night by his screams and cries for help. My uncle eventually lost his ""war"" with Vietnam in 1989 at the age of 39. While he was not a member of Charlie Company, this film puts into perspective the events that my uncle possibly endured and allowed me to better unserstand a world that no one should ever have to understand or endure for that matter. Veterans of all wars have always had (and always will) a special place in my heart. There is not a day that goes by that I take for granted the freedoms allowed to me and my family because of the sacrifices of our soldiers. This film with actual footage and interviews gives the viewer a first person account of what our soldiers endured; I highly recommend it and a box of tissues too! Thank you to Charlie Company for your service and for sharing your time in Vietnam with us.",1456272000,2,1196,4.181818181818182

Guess he would've been considered one of the ""replacements"", but my dad has recently opened up about his experience & no matter how many other Vietnam documentaries I've watched, not one except for this one came remotely close to his combat story. He & I watched this together. It's truly an amazing story what these men experienced....all of them!",1454889600,,419,5.0
6201594,1,B00HRUQ9TM,"This movie was not as expected.  It vaguely followed the film synopsis.  Yes there are two brothers, but that is where the similarities end.  The film goes along as if there will be some sort of redemption at the end, there isn't (sorry if that is a spoiler).  It's definitely ""a things got worse"" type of film.  We had to watch a few episodes of a comedy show in order to get over what was watched.

Style-wise definitely a mix between post-WWI German and French cinema with a British accent.",1454198400,2,493,4.4222222222222225
6201595,5,B00HRUQ9TM,"A 'chilling' visit to the ""old neighborhood.""
I was in Delta Company of the 9th Infantry Division. I was in the 2nd wave after the guys in this documentary.

First saw this on Nat Geo. Had to get it for 'posterity' sake. I sent a copy to all MY comrades in arms of Delta Company. We were right next door to Charlie Company in the 9th Infantry Division. God bless the memory of all those great guys I knew who never made it back to the 'world.' I will always remember them to my last days.

This movie is a must see for all to realize a terrible war and the 'draftees' ( like me ) who were 'chosen' to fight it.",1451606400,,610,3.9918032786885247
6201596,3,B00HRUQ9TM,"The synopsis of this film is that two brothers have been indulging in sibling rivalry for some time. Greg is the nice one who likes poetry and is all sensitive and Jake is the black sheep who loves divilment and causing a ruckus. This is all told in both linear and flashback mode. Then the war breaks out and Greg is the one who volunteers in 1939 and leaves the familial strife on the farm to go off to war.
**Please note the following may contain PLOT SPOILERS**

Well the war bit or rather the actual fighting bit lasts about three minutes of screen time, the rest is all about relationships both in England and France. One brother never even makes it to war. This is though quite a good film if taken on the relationship front and the issues of family ties and love. There are some plot holes too which were easy to have addressed. The acting though is all pretty solid and the attention to period detail is all done very well, especially when you consider this was an independent effort. It is the mis selling that is the real issue here.

So not a war film, per se, but with a background to WW2 to add drama and give context to the bigger story. The cover art is about as accurate as saying FIFA runs like a well oiled machine. It should not be allowed and will attract lovers of war films who may not be at all interested in a purely relationship based story - and that is no matter how well acted and put together it is - hence my rating.",1451088000,2,1447,4.2202166064981945
6201597,1,B00HRUQ9TM,"The marketing of this film is highly deceptive and has very little to do with the Second World War. In reality, this film is a narrative about the non-relationship between two English brothers in the period just before the war, in mid-1939. In short, the older brother is a dysfunctional bully and the younger is a shy wimp. Some odd family dynamics are thrown in with the parents. All of this plays out in the first 30-minutes or so of the film, leaving the older brother crippled. Then the younger son goes off to join the BEF heading to France.

I was hoping that this film might show a bit about the 1940 campaign in France, but was mightily disappointed. This is a very low budget film, with poor writing. The youngest son - who looks like a girl with long hair - goes through brief army training and is then shown running under fire with his squad, being chased by a squad of Germans. No explanations or set-up provided. After his squad is massacred, the younger brother soon finds himself alone in France and moves in with a French girl he saves. The rest is really just boring, right up to the end and involves several useless post-war subplots. The protagonist turns out to not be such a nice guy after all.

The portrayal of the Germans in the film is way over the top. Yes, German soldiers committed atrocities, but they were not all SS/Gestapo murderers as depicted here. One scene in particular, with a German officer trying to rape a French girl in a church is absurd and grotesque. The Germans murder British prisoners and French civilians and only exhibit out of control violence. In reality, most Germans were content to enjoy the occupation in France and got along with the locals until 1944 when things changed. The German uniforms used in this film were also absurd, they looked cheap and fake except in the initial combat scene. The SS officer uniforms looked like they were ordered from a Halloween costume store.

Overall, this I a cheap, pointless melodrama with only a whiff of the Second World War provided as background. Parts of the film are difficult to watch due to absurd/grotesque behavior.",1447891200,9,2122,4.638297872340425

The one soldier who stood out was Ronald Schworer who was the essence of the draftee; not your GI Joe, had the opportunity to get out by way of the family hardship but elected to stay with his new friends and died with them in Viet Nam. His name in on the wall but his body was never recovered and from all indications he may have been an early computer giant had he survived.  Again, the book is well written and documents from induction to the end of service for this company; powerful stories you won't forget.",1422576000,3,828,4.329032258064516

THEY DID IT FROM TOTAL SCRATCH AND DID IT WELL. THEIR CASUALTY STATS ARE OFF THE CHARTS!!  WHAT A BUNCH OF DEDICATED SOLDIERS, DETERMINED TO GET IT RIGHT AND GET OUT ALIVE. MANY DID NOT !!!

6201617,5,B00HRUQ9TM,"Absolutely amazing documentary about men becoming men and men from various backgrounds becoming brothers. Their personal stories regarding their start at boot camp, to deployment and acclimation, their life-changing experience to first hand combat, and getting back to the world are all heart-felt and well theres simply no words for it. These guys are heroes to the extreme and Im truly thankful (very understated) to their sharing of it all. Aside from the personal stories the historical aspects of the Mekong Delta make this a great piece to a Vietnam historical collection since most documentaries cover the Corps zones I, II, and III. As the topic of bias always seems to come up in war-related documentary reviews I will say I didn't find it biased at all from a political standpoint. Great documentary, great story, and a very strong thanks to the men of Charlie Company!",1407024000,4,879,5.027397260273973

8635144,5,B00HRUQ9TM,"One night watching this film at the one hour mark,  there was my younger sisiter on the screen with her little leopard dress, electric guitar with her two partners in their band ""Mustache and Us"".  They travelled throughout Viet Nam for 3 years entertaining the troops.  My sister Marina who appeared in this film was exposed to Agent Orange.  She came back to the states and developed all sorts of healthy problems, however the VA would pay her nothing, none of her medical bills because she was not military but rather an entertainer from North Hollywood.  I am angry,  she suffered terribly with healthy ailments.  I would apprecaite someone sending her a free copy of this film,  and contacting her by email.  Marina is now 73 years old.  I  wept through the film realizing what she had witnessed during wartime in Viet Nam.  Please contact Marina and you can tell her her sister Nina gave you her email.  She still has not seen this film,  and sure needs to be given some recognition for her difficult work as an entertainer during war.  Email  marina.bryant@comcast.net,  tell her that her sister suggested that National Geographic at least send her this film.  My email is  babunina10@mind.net",1523145600,,1200,4.822660098522167

Saddened me to learn these men were insulted the moment they got back to US soil even though they went through so much for a war they didn't even want to be a part of.
It deserves a watch in my opinion.",1503619200,,316,3.876923076923077
