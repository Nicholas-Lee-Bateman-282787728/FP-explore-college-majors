2386054,5,B000ADWDHK,I went to school with Marty Atwood and met his sister Mimi. I remember the Life photographer coming to school to take a picture of Marty for the magazine in 1971. Where are you now Marty? Richard Ennis,1253232000,2,201,4.315789473684211
2386055,5,B000ADWDHK,"This is a true story of a family with 19 mostly adopted children. Most of them are handicapped! If you think it's tough raising your kids, you need to see this. You don't know how easy you have it! :-)",1247788800,2,201,4.05
2386056,5,B000ADWDHK,"As soon as I saw this film, I raised it right up to one of my top films, of the thousands I've seen. I don't think in my rather long life I have ever seen anyone like Karen, one of the children in the movie.  This girl was really something.

Since others have already described and summarized the film well, I will limit myself to my own reactions to ""Who Are the Debolts?"".

The film is well made, overlooking the unfortunate ""Hollywood"" voice of the narrator, -fortunately what you will actually see on the film, which you will probably have never seen before, is good enough that the narrator problem fades into the background.

I thought the editing was just about perfect, as there were no scenes which I wish hadn't been there, a rare experience for me. The sequences were also well chosen, and the film moves right along. Importantly, it ends at a good point, a difficult thing to do for a documentary of this type. Uniquely, there were no downsides to the film from where I was observing.

I found watching happy children who were loved and cared for and brought up in a family where there was a good marriage, was so rewarding, and educational. It was definitely food for my soul. I think it's a good film to see around Christmas time. (I'm going to buy it and lend it to my friends and family.)",1229990400,2,1304,4.416666666666667
2386057,4,B000ADWDHK,"My only point in writing this review is warn people that it is not the same as TV version. It is a good film.

Not sure exactly what version is on the DVD and how it different from the TV version, but the DVD version does not have Henry Wrinkler as the narrator.

I recall watching this on TV many years ago, and there are scenes missing from the DVD version that were on TV. My guess is that this version was created before the TV version which Wrinkler narrates. Wrinkler does not narrates the DVD version, and the DVD version seem more of a ""promotional"" film hyping a perfectly happy Debolt family. My recollection of the TV version was it more realistic about the family struggles with raising such a large family of disabled children.",1187395200,7,740,4.4338235294117645
2386058,4,B000ADWDHK,"""Who Are the DeBolts? (And Where Did They Get 19 Kids?"" won the 1977 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.  It was up against ""Children of Theater Street,"" ""High Grass Circus,"" ""Homage to Chagall: The Colours of Love,"" and ""Union Maids.""  I mention this simply because looking over this list it is rather striking to realize how much documentary films have changed in the past three decades.  Today the attention is paid to expose documentaries by the likes of Michael Moore, while what we have here is a documentary that celebrates its subject.

When Dorothy DeBolt's first husband died, she was left a widow with seven children, two of who were adopted from Korea.  She moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1969 and adopted two Vietnames boys who had been made paraplegics by the war.  She then met and married Bob DeBolt, who had a daughter from his previous marriage.  The DeBolts went on to adopt ten more children, nine of who were physically handicapped.  The finally tally shows seven adopted children from Vietnam, four from Korea, one from Mexico, one African-American, and one Caucasian.  John Korty's documentary shows us that this remarkable family and not only how they function each day but how they meet the many challenges posed by their particular situations.

The documentary only runs 72 minutes so some of the kids get more of the spotlights than others.  Karen was born without arms or legs and not only learns to play the xylophone in the school band but how to do her share of chores around the house.  J.R. is the latest addition to the family and although he is blind and can only walk with crutches, he insists on going to public school and the inspirational highpoint of this film might be watching him make his way from the house to where he catches the bus to school.  Not that this story is wall-to-wall miracles, as you shall see, but you have to be impressed by the way Dorothy and Bob are raising these kids (and how they all help to raise each other).  There is a lot of love here to be sure, but there is also the DeBolts' insistence that their children fit not only in the idealized household of this Melting Pot home but in the real world as well.

Of course, it will be difficult for most parents to watch this documentary and not feel like something of a failure in comparison.  After all, if you have ever reached the end of your patience as a parent and you can count the number of your children on one hand, then how could you ever manage to deal with nineteen children, even without mixing special needs into the equation?  Surprisingly, Dorothy and Bob do not come across as saints or miracle workers but rather as loving people with MONDO organizational skills.  Korty is not particularly skilled as a filmmaker, but basically even if you are not doing anything special you cannot really go wrong pointing your camera at this family.

On the DVD extras you will find a 1982 featurette, ""Steppin' Out: The DeBolts Grow up,"" which runs 49 minutes and is directed by Jon Else, who was the cinematographer on the original documentary.  This gives you an opportunity to see what some of the kids are up to five years later, so things have not really changed all that much.  The surprise is that they have only added one new member in that time (do grandkids count?).  The other special features are all text files: ""DeBolt Family Updates,"" ""Bob and Dorothy Bios,"" ""Filmmaker Bios,"" and ""Adopt a Special Kid.""  That last one provides information on the organization founded by Dorothy.  In ""Steppin' Out"" we see that Dorothy and Bob actually leave the house from time to time to do public lectures and spread their particular parental gospel.",1137456000,19,3690,4.658950617283951
2386059,5,B000ADWDHK,"This a ""must-have"" for anyone with kids, anyone with parents, or teachers or anyone just wanting to feel good about people again. No saccharine sentiments, just an honest and genuine view of a real family going through all the tribulations and joys of ""family"".

I remember the DeBolts' visit like it was yesterday, and it was a TRIP watching this.  The DeBolts were so friendly and nice, it was a good experience to meet them.  I hope they're doing well.",1454716800,,374,4.3
8078125,5,B000ADWDHK,"I have never seen a documentary like this. It is so extraordinarily well done.  You will find yourself cheering this family, these kids all the way through the whole film.  Somehow the Debolt's found the secret to happiness and you'll find it in this movie.",1429315200,,257,4.688888888888889
8078126,5,B000ADWDHK,"I first watch this documentary when it originally aired.  I loved it then and I still love it now, all these years later.  It's a beautiful story about a very special family.  It's sweet, inspiring and entertaining all at once.  I'd highly recommend it.",1393027200,,253,4.681818181818182
8078127,4,B000ADWDHK,"I had the privilege of spending a week with this amazing family while on vacation at Lake Tahoe in the mid 70's. We were staying next door and spent our days playing volleyball, swimming, and taking them on rides in our boat. I will never forget Karen's deep belly laugh, Sunny' s sweetness or Wendy's beautiful smile which lit up her face. This family had an amazing impact on me and it's because of them that I became interested in working with special needs children. The week spent in their presence is one I will never forget.",1378252800,,531,4.484536082474227

8078129,5,B000ADWDHK,"Who doesn't have 72 minutes to watch this film?  No, it is not the 1970's version of the Duggars.  The DeBolts are humble and inspirational.  To them, a half an hour of ""concentrated attention"" with a child is more instrumental in a child's development than sitting around for six hours with the kid and watching television. The parents DO spend time together without the kids -- this time helps make them the kind of couple able to raise nineteen children so well.  I expected cheesiness and preachiness.  I got 72 minutes of sincerity and selflessness. And did I mention that many of the children have severe handicaps?  I mention this fact as a kind of afterthought, because the movie is not about how to overcome physical limitations.  It is a film filled with snapshots of a family that loves one another and recognizes the human dignity -- complete and whole -- in each individual, whether that person has limbs or not.",1341360000,,925,4.708074534161491

8078131,5,B000ADWDHK,"I stumbled across this documentary on Amazon and was very pleased to see it.  I had never heard of it until I found it here on Amazon, but it is terrific to watch in a family setting or in a group of parents.  It helps keep issues or struggles in perspective.  Three simple things I took away from this film:  they had a LOT of music and singing in their home; the parents admitted that they each had meltdowns at times and were very aware of keeping each other ""up"" and on top of the family; Mr. DeBolt stated that a person can make such a difference in a child's life by just spending 30 minutes with them.  Both parents were shown doing just that, including pushing the ""handicapped"" children to new heights of achievement.  VERY inspiring to see this family in action.  If you think you can't expect great things from your children, think again (and buy this video).",1254700800,3,870,4.4
