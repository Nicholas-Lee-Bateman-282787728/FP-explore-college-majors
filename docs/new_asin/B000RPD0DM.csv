2874533,5,B000RPD0DM,"If you had the least inclination to view this product on Amazon, you'll probably like owning it.

Based on what's been posted by other Amazon reviewers, the chief disappointment about ""Josie and the Pussycats"" seems to be its reliance on the same cookie-cutter plot episode after episode: the band travels to some exotic location and--against all odds--gets mixed up with another monolithic James Bond-caliber villain (who's eventually driven to articulate the obligatory angst about ""those meddling kids""), culminating in a chase scene that's accompanied by a groovy ditty from the mini-skirt era.  And of course, the gang triumphs in the end; roll the credits.

It's a good criticism.  In fact, it's so good that it could be applied to just about any of the animated products churned out of the prolific studios of Hanna-Barbara--including the studio's most celebrated (and lucrative) creation, ""Scooby Doo,"" which not only relied on the repetition of a contrived formula every episode--it was the same formula that would later be warmed over in ""Josie and the Pusssycats"" (to name but one of Hanna-Barbera shows that would attempt to cash in on minor variations of the Scooby Doo gimmick).

If this kind of repetition disappoints you, then you're not going to want to own any kid-vid products from the '60s, '70s or '80s.  You may not even want to check them out of your local library.  But there's nothing particularly worse (or better for that matter) about ""Josie and the Pussycats.""

What makes us willing to shell out hard-earned cash (or equally hard-earned credit) on these specimens of dreadful production value is not our appraisal of their quality when viewed through 21st century eyes, be it the animation, writing or even singing.  It's nostalgia pure and simple.  That's why I open my review as I do: if there's enough nostalgia to persuade you to look at the product, it's very likely that this show has a special place in your past and in your heart today.

Sure, when we watch this stuff today we catch things we didn't catch before.  We've all grown up.  But just as surely, we catch all the things that we did catch before; it's a time machine that takes us back to a nostalgic vision of the early '70s that only era's children ever experienced.  Obviously watching this stuff doesn't denude us of our modern-day identity; we just get a chance to remember that those kids in the '70s were also us; we are one.  Heavy stuff, but I think that's what going on behind the tingle of emotion we experience.  And the real double-whammy of this nostalgia is that we can share it with our kids, at the very least more effectively than our parents could have shared grainy, black-and-white broadcasts of ""Hopalong Cassidy"" flicks or ""Shirley Temple"" movies.  The next generation, while very different from our own, shares more in common culturally with us that we did with our parents.  My five-year-old daughter, for example, recognizes that these Hanna-Barbara cartoons look ""different"" from what she's accustomed to, but she hasn't picked up on anything different that is also a deterrent.  She enjoys them.  My dad tried getting me interested in old westerns from the '30s and '40s, and I just couldn't stand the stuff (to say nothing of how Shirley Temple movies struck me).

That said, the value of all of these shows, ""Josie"" included, will no doubt be proportional to your affection for them 30 or more years ago.  Audiences had decades to fall in love with Scooby Doo.  They had only one year (or two, if you count the show's ""Pussyscats in Outer Space"" sequel) to fall in love with Josie.  Now connoisseurs may argue that Scooby's longevity proves it to be a vastly superior show, but personally I classify such stilted critiques in the same category with comparative analyses of the various vintages of Cold Duck.

That said, if the cancellation of Josie was a childhood trauma, Amazon's got the cure three decades later.  But if it was Scooby Doo you really loved and you have only fond memories of Josie, you'll probably only like this new DVD collection, whereas you'll love the Scooby DVD collections.  And in light of what's on the tube these days (in between the rapidly multiplying quantity of commercials), just finding something you like isn't half bad.  In that context, ""Josie"" might actually be better the second time around.",1185408000,29,4359,4.877883310719132
2874534,3,B000RPD0DM,"If you saw J&TP as child in 1970-72 as I did, you're bound to have the ""warm and fuzzies"" over this one, especially since it was never on (legit non-bootleg) DVD.

HOWEVER, like SOME shows you haven't seen since childhood, you may be in for a letdown and a reality check from actually watching this DVD.

The plain, ugly truth is that nostaligia aside, this show tends to get old really fast. It basically tells the same story every time (J&TP go to perform in a foreign country, the stumble upon a fiendish plot by some evil character, then we're treated to chase scenes by the evil villains going after those ""meddling kids""-a phrase that gives you indigestion after the ten thousandth time and the song of the week. Alexandra tries unsucessfully to steal Alan from Josie, and that's it until the next time).

Of course, we didn't notice this as small kids in that era, but today's children may catch on to this pretty fast and quickly lose interest.

I didn't give it just one star for the following reasons-J&TP had some merit to it. For one thing, following some controversy with Hanna-Barbera who originally wanted to make her white, Valerie was the first Black non-stereotyped HB character (which as a six year old in 1970, I didn't really notice and neither will most of today's children-it's sad that this is still an issue with Disney's ""The Princess and the Frog"" but I digress). Curiously, HB had no similar qualms about the Harlem Globetrotter cartoons that appeared later that year.

Secondly, the show was educational in a way because I was enthralled nd fascinated by the different countries they went to every week. As did  another reviewer, I also remember the ""In The Know"" educational segments by J&TP that appeared through the show and the catchy theme song to that one(this was three years before Schoolhouse Rock broke the mold for this kind of thing).

Finally, the songs were quite good for the pop of that era and the theme song is indeed catchy. Patrice Holloway (Valerie) was the sister of Motown princess Brenda Holloway and young Cheryl Ladd was the voice of Melody, who had a few amusing moments as the show's resident dumb blonde. DJ Casey Kasem was the perfect ""Chicken Alex"" (even as a kid, I noitced he had the same voice as Scooby-Doo's Shaggy).

So it has a small place in cartoon history and those of us who were there at the time have fond memories of it, but once you see the DVD-you've been warned.",1183939200,11,2439,4.642691415313225
2874535,5,B000RPD0DM,"With its catchy theme song, likeable characters and funny plotlines, ""Josie and the Pussycats"" was one of the best Hanna-Barbera Series ever produced for Saturday Morning television.

Its release on DVD sparks many a memory of Saturday mornings spent in my pajamas as a six year old, enjoying Alpha Bits or Fruit Loops cereal while partaking of the broadcast fare. ""Josie and the Pussycats"" was a very important part of that ritual. My memories of the show are so vivid that I even remember the ""In the Know"" segments sandwiched between programs that featured the cast of ""Josie"" presenting light news features. If memory serves ""In The Know"" presaged ""In The News"" which ran for years on CBS Saturday Mornings.

Watching re-runs on Boomerang, I am amazed at how well the show holds up and the 'chase' songs were consistently good. Sure the plots were almost interchangeable, but, so what?  The shows were fast paced, hilarious, and to borrow a lyric from the theme, we were invited to ""c'mon watch the good guys win.""

Unfortunately, this great cartoon premise lasted only  a season before producers made the stupid decision to place the characters in Outer Space and for a show with far out plots, this premise was too way-out.

Can't wait to view the original adventures of Josie, Valerie, Melody, Alan, Alexander , Alexandra and Sebastian the Cat with my kids for another generation of enjoyment.",1183248000,32,1400,4.911016949152542

2874559,4,B000RPD0DM,"Since it's debut on CBS's Saturday morning line-up in Fall 1970,""JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS"" was an extremely superior Saturday morning cartoon show,from Hanna-Barbera Productions,and also an attempt to cash-in on the outstanding success of Filmation Associates' ""THE ARCHIES""
in which both characters are related,and published by the same comicbook company,,and given the outstanding success of the Bubble Gum music from The Archies,Hanna-Barbera tried to copy the formula,,and it was a nice try-but not as big a success,despite the intentions,,but the cartoon series was still a major hit for CBS Saturday mornings-and while many TV viewers do not recall or remember,CBS had aired a format called ""IN THE KNOW"",that was hosted by the Josie characters through the 1970-71 TV season,before being changed to ""IN THE NEWS"" in Fall 1971-and why these rare items were not included in this 2007 DVD release,is a huge mystery!  unlike The Archies,""JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS followed the adventures (and mayhem) of the Teen age rock band,with an insanely lovely,but jealous member,whose brother is the manager of the band,along with a muscle bound member,who is Josie's boyfriend,and a comical cat named Sabastian! the gang frequently got into misadventures involving mad scientists,crime organizations,and other intriguing situations,while somehow managing to sing a number,during their crazy situations! in Fall 1972 the series returned to CBS as ""JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS IN OUTER SPACE"",which made absolutely no sense,but still an enjoyable continuation of this cartoon series,which was later reruned by NBC in Fall 1975. when the series was on CBS in it's first season,it was commercially sponsored by Kelloggs Cereals,in which these commercial spots should've been added to this DVD. but of course the main value of this cartoon show,was that it was the debut of an unknown actress known as Cherrie Moor,later to be known as Cheryl Ladd,when she joined ABC's ""CHARLIE'S ANGELS"" in Fall 1977!  but in general,""JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS"" is only for those die hard fans of Saturday morning cartoons,who understood and appreciated the material! but in it's Saturday morning history,the show was a very popular and
successful ratings winner,which rival network NBC put to use,when that network started rerunning many of CBS's former Saturday morning hits on their late 70s schedule! i recommend this DVD to only the serious fans of Saturday morning cartoons-but i also caution consumers to be very careful,as some of Warner Home Video's DVD discs have resulted in non functional symptoms,resulting in the disc not being able to play,,so for that issue,i'd contact the studio,to make them aware of these problems-eventually,its hoped that these prized titles will be re-released on BluRay Disc one day,along with the many rare special features,that i mentioned in this review,if these items have survived in someone's archive!",1459123200,,2912,5.4688888888888885

She had watched it as a child and loved it. The series brought back a lot of fond memories for both my wife and I.

Being the oldest in my family, I would get up each Saturday morning and gather up cereal bowels, Captain Crunch cereal for my almost 10 years younger sister and Apple Jacks for me. We would settle down on the living room sofa with our cereal and milk and proceed to spend a glorious morning of watching cartoons. My sister loved Josie and the Pussycats. I look back on those mornings with great fondness.

My wife, also the oldest of four children, had a similar experience. She took care of her younger brothers and sister --- cereal and milk --- the selected the cartoons they all grew to love.

Jose and the Pussycats is one of the wonderful, fun, well done cartoons from and era that no longer exists. There are very few cartoons on Saturday mornings. The days are gone, the fond memories linger and flushed out in a GREAT way with the release of cartoon series such as Josie and the Pussycats on DVD.

2874589,5,B000RPD0DM,"Having been involved with the performing arts, I have this little side hobby of finding and collecting various shows that are performing-arts-centric (as in the show centers around performing artists)...shows like ""Jem and the Holograms"", ""Nodame Cantabile"", ""Glass Mask"", ""JabberJaw"", ""Chance Pop Session"", and ""Kaleido Star"".  It goes without saying that ""Josie and the Pussycats"" would perk my interest, as well.

""Josie and the Pussycats"" is the iconic cartoon adaptation of the ""Josie and the Pussycats"" comic by Archie comics (it has quite an interesting history, actually).  And this DVD contains all 16 episodes for you to enjoy at your own leisure.  Just to clarify, this does not contain the spinoff series ""Josie and the Pussycats in Space"" because that is it's own series...and there is also a DVD set for that, too).  Throughout the series, you follow Josie and company as they travel the world for the sake of performing...only to wind up getting caught in (or more specifically dragged into) some crazy hijinks.  The character archetypes are stereotypical...and the stories are pretty predictable.  But it is well done and the character chemistry simply wonderful.  There's tons to laugh at as well...and the music is always a trip.  It is quite imaginative and stands the test of time for what it is.

THE PACKAGE ITSELF:
The set contains two discs that are contained and secured in a cardboard case (which opens up like a book or a typical ""thank you"" card) and is further protected by a second cardboard sleeve.  As far as that goes, I am quite satisfied.  The DVDs, themselves, are arranged on one side in an overlapping kind of plastic clip.  The product images show it quite well.  Personally, I'm not a fan of that, but it's not too big a deal.  At least, there IS enough ""air"" in between the 2 discs so they don't scratch each other.  The 2nd Disc is a double- sided disc which contains both the rest of the episodes and the special feature.  I'm not a fan of double-sided discs neither...but I can live with it.

SPECIAL FEATURES:
Well, to be honest, I would have wished for more special features (I do like documentary style type special features) as there is only one special feature.  But at least the one that they do include is rather decent, lengthy (as far as special features go), educational, and plain amazing insight.  Now, this is not a documentary about ""Josie and the Pussycats"" per se.  Rather, it is a remembrance of the man that brought life to ""Josie and the Pussycats"" from his wife and the people that worked with him.  A little bit about ""Josie and the Pussycats"" is covered, naturally...but it's more focused on the kind of man and artist that the late Dan DeCarlo was...that and a bit of where he came from.  Folks wanting to learn tons more about Josie and the pussycats, exclusively, will be disappointed.  But if you are more interested in the man, then this is a valuable piece of insight.

QUALITY:
I played this on an HD set up, but I found nothing really wrong with it.  Maybe I'm just not that picky on the visual...but it looked fine to me.  And the audio quality is good and solid.  And it goes without saying that the music still shines.  The whole presentation reminded me of the days when I watched it back on Cartoon Network.

ALL IN ALL:
I'm really glad to have this show in my collection to enjoy time and time again.  Though, I would have preferred slightly better packaging plan and a bit more special features, this is still a solid set at an affordable price.  There's nothing like the Pussycats and I'm glad I can listen to their concerts over and over again ^_^",1404691200,,3630,4.685624012638231

I know that past reviewers were complaining about the quality, but I was pleased to discover that both the pic and audio are great.

However, don't be expecting too much.

Josie, for a main character, is amazingly vanilla.  Alan is a big lump.  Why does Alexandra want him?  Speaking of Alexandra, why does everyone else put up with her?  I get the brother, but the rest?

Fortunately, there are two characters that save the day for me.  Melody and Sebastian.  Yeah it's the same scene every time, but I just like watching her drum and her comments actually make me laugh.  Sebastian is the brains of the outfit and I have never seen a character combine helpfulness and malice so well.

2874619,5,B000RPD0DM,"July 20, 2010

Josie and the pussycats are on DVD. Let me start out by saying this show is really fun to watch. This show is about a musical group and their friends and they travel all over the world singing. While the doing this they always seem to get caught up in some villain's evil plot. Then they have to find a way tp save the day and themselves.

This show is one of many shows that are somewhat based on Scooby Doo, Where Are You?

The character on the show are listed below:

Members actually in the band-:

Josie- lead singer; Alexandria's enemy; likes Alan
Valerie- plays the tambarine; the smart girl
Melody- plays the drums; the stupid girl

Other characters:

Alan- the tough guy; likes Josie but Alexandria gets in the way
Alex- the scardey guy and Alexandria's brother
Alexandria- a mean spirited girl; likes Alan and dislikes Josie; is always making things worse for the gang.

There were 16 episodes in the original series (listed below):

1. The Nemo's a No-No Affair
2. A Greenthumb is not a Goldfinger
3. The Secret Six Secret
4. Swap Plot Flop
5. Midas Mix-Up
6. X Marks the Spot
7. Chili Today and Hot Tamale
8. Never Mind A Mastermind
9. Plateau of the Ape Plot
10. Strangemoon Over Miami
11. All Wong in Hong Kong
12. Melody Memory Mix-Up
13. The Great Pussycat Chase
14. Spy School Spoof
15. The Jumpin' Jupitier Affair
16. Don't Count on a Countess

The DVD set is great with all the original episodes presented. It also includes bonus features about the show itself which is good compared to other DVD's bonus features.

This is a really great show and for all ages. I'm still hoping for the DVD release of the spin-off Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space. It has the basic original plots but in outer space.  I'm also hoping for DVD releases of the other shows based off of Scooby Doo, Where Are You? like Jabberjaw, Speed Buggy, Clue Club, and Goober and the Ghost Chasers. If you have any comments on this show or other shows like this please leave me one.

2874620,5,B000RPD0DM,I introduced my 6 year old daughter to Josie and the pussycats and had to buy it for her.  She loves the music and the show itself.  So nice to know that my daughter can enjoy the cartoons I watched as a kid.,1277337600,,208,3.813953488372093
2874621,5,B000RPD0DM,Well sent,1271894400,,9,4.0
2874622,4,B000RPD0DM,"Okay let me say I got into the Josie and the Pussycats game kind of late. My affair with them began when I was very young like 10. I would catch clips of them on kids show promotions for USA or TNT. I would always miss the actual show  because it came on too early in the morning.

Finally a few years later, I caught a few episodes on cartoon network during their mystery inc time slot  on sunday afternoons. I saw a few episodes and fell in love. I just loved everything about it. The sing-a-long music, the catty Alexandra and sebastian, and the chase scenes (of course). All of this made for one hot show.

Then they stopped showing it on cartoon network and moved it to boomerang. I ran into some episodes on vhs at a dollar store and just had to purchase it.

Then several years later I saw the dvd set and had to buy it!

I love being able to watch them at anytime i wish. It is fun watching with my siblings as well. They are also fans of the show.

The dvd set delivers all the  episodes  right before they hit the out of space phase. These are the best in my opinion. They provide catchy songs and nice laughs along the way. I do not like Alexandra but I must admit if it wasn't for her most of the episodes would be pretty  boring. She adds that spice  that makes all of the others react accordingly. This is why I secretly like her. LOL

I also enjoy Melody ,the resident dumb blonde. She is so sweet so you forgive her dimness. Valerie is a smooth operator when it comes to mechanics ,and I like that they  they made her black (as she was originally intended to be) instead of going with the more conventional thing of the time which was to make her white. I also like that she wasn't the comedy relief. It showed a confidant black woman who offered plenty of smarts to the group.

Alan is pretty  bland  but is still likable. Alexander is the resident scardy cat and sounds just like shaggy but you get used to him after a while. I like him too even though he is a horrible manager for the group. They will never  blow up  doing random gigs in  random places. LOL

I did enjoy all of the episodes on the two disc set and i did like the  documentary on the  guy who created the comic in the first place. But I wish there were more  special features. Like if they had a jukebox section that only played all of the songs from the episodes or a sing-a-long feature. that would be wicked cool. Or intereviews with the  voice actors, and cartoonists. These are what would have made this over the top GREAT!

But I am happy that these are now all on dvd. Any diehard Josie fan should have it and even a causal watcher would enjoy this mix.

My favorite episodes were ""A Greenthumb is not a Gold finger"", ""The Midas Mix up"", ""Swap Plot Flop"", ""Jumping Jupiter"",""The Secret Six"" ""Don't Count on a Countess"", Chili Today ,Hot Tamaele"",and the ""Don't Ape a Apeman"".

They are all fun and filled with good songs. Definitely worth a repeat watch.",1264550400,2,2947,4.225402504472272

Love the songs (find the bootleg CD on ebay if you can), the characters (Alexandra and Melody most of all), and yes, even as an adult, I laugh out loud at some of the campy '70s lingo and jokes...

What is REALLY shocking is that I remember almost all of the episodes verbatim except for the last 4 (Disc 2, Side 2)...  I'm almost thinking that these weren't shown as part of the syndication package or something when I watched it in the late '70s or on Cartoon Network in the '90s...  What a joy to see some ""Josie"" episodes I didn't actually remember!!!

While the tribute to Dan DeCarlo certainly was nostalgic and enjoyable, it sure would've been nice to see some ""Where are they now?"" interviews with the ladies (including, of course, Cheryl Ladd) who sang the Pusscats' songs...

2874629,5,B000RPD0DM,"Saturday morning nostalgia reigns supreme with the delightful DVD release of  the original animated ""JOSIE & THE PUSSYCATS."" When I was a little boy, my Saturday morning TV ritual included both ""SCOOBY DOO, WHERE ARE YOU?"" and ""JOSIE."" Both shows have a lot in common-- and not just because Casey Kasem provided the voice for both ""Scooby-Doo's"" Shaggy and ""Pussycats"" manager Alexander Cabot III-- but in terms of plot premise, too.
  ""Josie and the Pussycats"" were a bubble-gum pop group. The girl group,-- Josie, bubble-head blonde Melody, and smart Valerie-- along with Alexander, Alexandria, Alan, and cat companion Sebastian, traveled the world and spent as much time battling weird, nefarious super-villians as they did making music. When I was five years old, I had a crush on Josie, voiced by Janet Waldo, whose name, strangely, does not appear in the closing credits. Turns out,  I would have a crush on Josie's hunky boyfriend Alan  today. Hee Hee! Hah! Hah!
  My favorite villians are Mastermind in ""Never Mind A Mastermind"" and the evil Countess who develops a strange perfume-like mist to turn everybody in the world old in the final episode ""Don't Count On A Countess."" One episode, ""Plateau Of The Apes Plot,"" even seems to be inspired directly by ""PLANET OF THE APES."" Each episode featured an extended ""chase sequence"" and a bubble-gum pop song like ""Clock On The Wall"", in addition to the unforgettably catchy title song that opened the show each week.
  ""JOSIE & THE PUSSYCATS"" fans will likely also want to purchase the Saturday Morning cartoon DVD releases of  ""THE PEBBLES AND BAM-BAMM SHOW"" and ""SABRINA, THE TEEN-AGE WITCH."" Great Fun-- I can't wait!",1204416000,3,1675,5.014440433212997

2874634,5,B000RPD0DM,"Josie and the Pussycats were like the Beatles or the Monkees. A girlband who goes on madcap adventures, without really trying. This trio of ladies were stereo types, but it worked so well

This Hanna Barbara series retreaded tracks left by the Beatles (in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Help/dp/B000VSBX34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Help!</a>&nbsp;and Hard Days Night) and the Monkees (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Monkees-Season-1/dp/B00006ZZ05/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Monkees: Season 1</a>). What makes this work is the animated adventures.  Some of the humor could only be done in animation...and it worked. This 70's show paved the way for the animated adventures of the (musical) Hardy Boys, The Partridge Family 2020, The Jackson Five and The Osmonds (all not available at this time on DVD)

The show had great animated voice talent. Janet Waldo (the voice of Judy Jetson and  Penelope Pitstop) did the voice of Josie. Jackie Joseph did the voice of the lame brain Melody. Barbara Pariot did the voice of Val. Radio DJ and the voice of Shaggy from Scooby Doo Casey Kasem did the voice of their manager of Alex Cabot, the band's manager.

Only 16 episodes were done of this series, but for Hanna Barbera fans these cartoons are golden oldies. They are still great work that could run on Saturday morning TV again or Cartoon Network today..so why aren't they

I have a question for those at Warner Brothers DVD animation..when are you releasing the Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space?

2874635,5,B000RPD0DM,"I don't know what it is about Josie and the Pussycats, but I used to love it a kid.  It's an entirely silly concept (a crime-fighting girl band), but it was very entertaining.  I think because the characters were so well-developed and interesting.  Furthermore, they were a very diverse (socially, culturally, and racially) group, which seemed very progressive for its time.  You had Josie, the level-headed ""leader.""  Melody, the ditzy, but super-nice, blond.  Valerie, the calm, cool, and collected MacGyver-type.  Was Charlie's Angels based on them?

To throw in some conflict within the group, we were given the wacky brother and sister team of Alexander and Alexandra, and the hunky Alan, Josie's boyfriend, whom Alexandra lusted after.  Alexandra was by far my favorite character, as she was always trying to mess things up for Josie because of her jealousy, yet the team always welcomed her into their social group.

The episode prints are terrible, full of scratches, which I probably wouldn't mind so much if they'd even bothered to keep the correct Hanna Barbera logo at the end of them.  The ""extras"" are hardly worthy of the name, and to top it all, the DVD case is very cheap and flimsy.  If you're a die-hard fan and it's on sale at a huge discount, then sure, buy it.

2874637,4,B000RPD0DM,"I'm glad to see this finally available on DVD.  Picture quality is better than it ever has been - but the show-even on TV has suffered from poor audio quality.  Again, it's better than it has been but could be better.  The most annoying factor is how the theme music drags when it first starts(from the menu version, to the extro) the song starts, but slows down slightly until it picks up speed again.  It's a minor thing-but considering how popular the theme song was that more attenton wouldn't be paid to getting this right.

Now that we have this, Let's have Speed Buggy, and maybe Josie & The Pussycats in Outer Space.
Also, what would be a nice bonus on some of these DVDs is a seperate track of just the background incidental music.  Love that stuff.",1192752000,5,758,4.456521739130435
2874638,4,B000RPD0DM,"For too long, this collection has been missing from my library of the classic cartoons I grew up with. Having watched the cartoon when it first aired on Saturday mornings back in the late 60's, I was delighted to hear that Hannah Barbara was finally releasing it to DVD this year. Watching the first episode ""The Nemo's A No No Affair"" (my all time favorite episode, btw) brought back all those wonderful memories of my youth.
I will say that the collection isn't 100% perfect. The laugh track, always an enjoyable part of the show, is missing, & that makes the DVD collection less enjoyable (the show currently gets occasional airtime on Boomerang, btw, & those episodes do include the laugh track). Hopefully the producers of the DVD will include the laugh track in future releases.",1190851200,7,784,4.772058823529412

Despite the series containing only 16 ""groovy"" episodes, I never grew tired of watching them over and over.  And I don't now.  The characters still provide plenty of laughs - especially silly Melody, cowardly Alexander, and his wisecracking, ever-scheming sister Alexandra. And who can forget the group's furry sidekick, Sebastian?  (Love that cat's laugh!)  Plus the band's kooky crime-solving adventures - all around the world - are fun and zany as ever.

2874641,3,B000RPD0DM,"These characters were based on the Archie Comics characters, and were slightly altered for television. For example, Alexander Cabot was given the exaggerated cowardice of Scooby Doo character Shaggy (not to mention his voice actor Casey Kasem, who created a slight difference in voices when the characters met in the New Scooby Doo Movies episode featuring Josie & the Pussycats: The Haunted Showboat).
8 songs were created for the series, and are used in the chase sequences near the end of each episode. Each song is used for 2 of the 16 episodes.
The singing voice (not the speaking voice) of drummer Melody is done by Cherie Moore (who was later billed on Charlie's Angels as Cheryl Ladd from 1977-81).
Enjoy the show, and if you'd like to see more Archie Comics characters, check out Filmation's Archie Show: The Complete Series, released recently by BCI.
A sequel series came out two years later: Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space, which placed the characters in an obvious parody of Lost in Space.",1190505600,,1009,4.872093023255814
2874642,5,B000RPD0DM,"'Josie and the Pussycats' has to be one of the best Saturday morning cartoons ever conceived.  No, I am serious about this.  'Josie...' has everything going for her.  There was dystopian menace, represented by some mad scientist, intent on some mayhem.  Of course parents could have protested about the propaganda, but since I agreed with them who cares?  But the entertainment was solid and consistent throughout with some of the silliest and funniest writing ever presented to kids.

Most of the success relies on the cardboard characterization.  There's Josie, the girl next door.  Then, Valerie, the girl genius, who was more than a token representative of African-Americans.  Although as a boy, I rolled my eyes at Alan, the coveted boy of every band member, it did provide a plot device.  Predictably Alexandra provided a lot of laughs as the conniving, jealous nemesis plotting for his company.  Then, there was Alexander (Casey Kasem), the hapless, cowardly brother who added so much to the fray.  To finish them off there was empty headed Melody, whose innocence kept everyone on their toes.  (Even today, dumb blonde jokes sometimes get under the radar, so I don't see this series being pulled off the shelves just yet.)  Oh, and you can't help but remember Sebastian, the resourceful cat, who had paws equipped like a Swiss army knife.

All of the hijinx had great timing and educational import as chase scenes dismantled science gone wrong in flowing, pre-MTV music video sequences.  Allegedly, the Hanna-Barbera team were exhausted by the mayhem they created each week, and, unfortunately, they lost in a kiddie gender battle to the less worthy 'Saturday Superstar Movies' (from ABC?), but it was a quality production from its inception, one that electrified me as a child.

Besides all of this, nearly every cartoon on Saturday morning after 1968 had to have a back-up band.  And, although Archie had all the hits, the flow from the action went well with the music.

At the risk of my reputation, I have to give full praises for 'Josie' and her 'Pussycats'.  As a well-rounded entertainment with fun characters and fluid chase scenes, this top-notch Hanna-Barbera series deserves to be up there with 'Jonny Quest' and 'Scooby Doo' for its fun and import.",1190505600,14,2268,4.997333333333334
2874643,3,B000RPD0DM,"I love 'Josie and the Pussycats.' I threw out my old VHSs filled with a lot of the episodes when Cartoon Network use to have marathons of it, anxious for the DVD set.

When I got it, I put it in and was sorely disappointed. On a semi-big screen TV, you'll quickly notice ""dirt"" galore all over the episodes. This is bad because Josie ATP is a brightly-colored cartoon (unlike the darker Scooby Doo) so the dust, dirt and lines are instantly visible. Another big thing that urks me is there is NO LAUGH TRACK ANYMORE. WHY? Well people all over the internet who sneer at the laugh track, enjoy the awkward pauses where the laughs use to be! And the packaging...it's hard to get the DVDs out! Who's the genius that designed this??

I'm glad I only paid 20 dollars, although I would have probably been better off buying bootlegs on the internet or something. Although it's great to see Josie and the gang, and a nice tribute to poor Dan DeCarlo, this DVD set is surprisingly disappointing. 3 stars because they actually gave Josie a DVD set...but they could've done a lot better.",1190332800,59,1075,4.507692307692308
2874644,3,B000RPD0DM,"JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS returns to your screen in this new DVD set, bringing you the complete Hanna-Barbera series about the misadventures of an all-girl rock band and their entourage.

This show is not an original production of Hanna-Barbera (as some have mistakenly believed); instead it grew from Don DeCarlo's comic strip JOSIE, created for Archie Comics.  In the wake of Filmation's successful ARCHIE SHOW, HB attempted to create their own teen-rock-band show, which wound up being SCOOBY-DOO, WHERE ARE YOU?  However, HB still wanted their own version of the Archies and finally went to the source, securing the JOSIE property from Archie Comics for development.  The resulting production detailed the escapades of sweet-natured guitarist/bandleader Josie (Janet Waldo), level-headed, inventive tambourinist Valerie (Barbara Pariot), happy-go-lucky, impossibly dumb drummer Melody (Jackie Joseph), stalwart roadie Alan (Jerry Dexter), cowardly braggart and manager Alexander Cabot III (Casey Kasem, in a variant of his Shaggy character), and his vicious sister Alexandra Cabot (Sherri Alberoni), who continuously schemes to gain Alan as a boyfriend and take control of the Pussycats, sometimes with the aid of mischievous and occasionally faithless cat/band mascot Sebastian (Don Messick).  Invariably, the gang ran afoul of a villain in the midst of world takeover; after a series of misunderstandings, chases, songs, and general slapstick, the villain was thwarted and Josie and Co. lived to play another gig.

Many have muttered about JATP's similarities to SCOOBY-DOO (in fact, some of the same score music can be heard in these episodes).  However, it is well-known that Hanna-Barbera often expended energy on doing variations on a theme with its hit properties (witness THE JETSONS, basically a space-age version of THE FLINTSTONES, and of course any number of SCOOBY-DOO retreads such as THE FUNKY PHANTOM, GOOBER AND THE GHOST CHASERS, CLUE CLUB and JABBERJAW, to name a few), so that reason is minimal in my assessment of this set.  JATP is enjoyable, despite the somewhat substandard animation, and the characters are likable, funny and true in appearance to their source material.  My main problem with this set is that the episodes do not appear to have been culled from the absolute best source material; some of it looks like well-worn syndication videotapes, and the soundtrack occasionally drags noticeably.

This set includes a featurette on Dan DeCarlo, the creator of JOSIE, featuring input from such animation/comics notables as Bruce Timm, Scott Shaw, and Stan Lee (who worked with DeCarlo on various humor/girl comics; it is often not known that Lee is a very capable humor writer).  Rather than focus on the show, the featurette instead focuses on DeCarlo and his life and work as a renowned and much-loved artist, touching on his relationship with his wife Josie, who was the inspiration for JATP (in addition to being a real-life Josie).

If you are a fan, this is what you've been waiting for, but be prepared for technical issues.  A basically good set that could have been done a little better.  But at least they're not in outer space...",1190246400,11,3172,5.292828685258964
2874645,5,B000RPD0DM,"I wasn't born when Josie and the Pussycats originally ran on CBS and NBC but I remembered my older siblings and watching this show on KCOP Channel 13 here in L.A. I even saw the gang on Scooby Doo in the episode, ""The Haunted Showboat"". I got hooked in the reruns and eventually the comic books.  I am so happy this is finally coming to DVD after being on Cartoon Network/Boomerang for years. The main component to this show was the music by Danny Jannsen, Austin Roberts and Susan Sheridan and that groovy theme song.  And let's not forget the vocalists the late Patrice Holloway, Cheryl Ladd, and Cathy Dougher who gave the show that fun, uptempo sound.

Now, about the DVD, I was not pleased with the packaging and while I love the show, they could have done something more about the quality such as the video and the original ending logos.  The closing logos should have been retained as they were in 1970 and the film should have been restored and cleaned up.  Also, the captions should have included the song lyrics, too.  I also felt that a double sided DVD is not good because of scratches and etc.  And give Patrice, Cathy and Cheryl a tribute for their vocal talents, too!  Still, this is a great show but Warner could have done better.",1188518400,2,1246,4.482300884955753

8202187,3,B000RPD0DM,"JOSIE & THE PUSSYCATS-THE COMPLETE SERIES: An Archie Comics sister series created by legendary illustrator Dan DeCarlo, Josie & the Pussycats was a female pop trio who traveled the world playing concerts and solving mysteries. Sensible Josie, dumb blonde Melanie, and brainy Valerie (the first regular black character in cartoon history) were accompanied by hunky roadie Alan, chicken-hearted manager Alexander (Casey Kasem, voicing a slight variation of Scooby Doo's Shaggy Rogers), and his ""jealous of Josie"" sis Alexandria, not to mention snickering cat Sebastian. Every episode followed formula...while touring exotic locales, the group got mixed up with villainous masterminds bent on world domination, split up into two teams (three characters being cheaper to animate than six), and emerged victorious via silly disguises, dumb luck, and Valerie's ability to rewire the baddies' tools of the trade. The obligatory slapstick chase scenes were accompanied by fast-paced would be hit singles, some sung by a pre-Charlie Angels Cheryl Ladd. In the era of ascots and mini skirts, Josie & the Pussycats combined some of the best girl group/bubblegum music (notably Inside Outside Upside Down and their irresistible theme song) with Hanna-Barbara's patented limited animation, producing one of the better Scooby Doo knock-offs to invade Saturday morning.
