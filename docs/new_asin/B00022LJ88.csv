8020898,3,B00022LJ88,"Despite the efforts of star, Spencer Tracy, this movie is mostly long and dull.  The plot frequently makes little sense with Marie Galante herself being incredibly naive or a little simple.  If the studio had been willing to settle for a much shorter but entertaining B movie, the thing would have probably turned out better.  Instead it's almost an hour and a half and suffers from pretensions as Fox Studios presented their new European star, Ketti Gallian.  Sig Ruman's portrayal of the shop keeper Brogard is reminiscent of Wallace Beery in Grand Hotel which helps tip-off the viewer that Brogard is more than just a pompous businessman.",1486166400,,641,4.962616822429907

8020900,4,B00022LJ88,"This is a nice, very involved and detailed, story of a girl who gets tricked into spying and other intrigue after she is kidnapped by a drunk wanna-be 'Romeo' who is a ship's captain but who has second thoughts about what he's done and who abandons Marie in a strange port with nothing but the clothes on her back and her true but difficult for some to believe story to explain her situation... She tries to find work or to get help from fellow French citizens, with mixed and sometimes tragic results...

8020902,4,B00022LJ88,"My experience with minor brand DVD companies (such as this unnamed plain box one) has been satisfactory, as I'm not interested in commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features, that is, stuff these discs don't offer. Transfers are ""best available source"" and quality can vary from very good to only fair.

MARIE GALANTE is a 1934 movie with interesting connections to the coming World War. This espionage tale is set in Central America and involves citizens of France, Germany, Britain, Japan and the USA. There's also a plot to sink the American fleet as it passes through the Panama Canal-- an eerie foreshadowing of the Dec. '41 Pearl Harbor attack.

Marie (Gallian) is taken against her will to Mexico by an inebriated sea captain. She works her way down the coast seeking return passage to her native France. At the Canal Zone, Marie takes a singing job and meets an American doctor (Tracy) who's researching tropical diseases. She also becomes acquainted with a British diplomat, a German businessman and his Japanese competitor. Marie learns that the doctor is actually a secret agent trying to foil a plot to destroy the Canal and U.S.N. fleet. (Watch for singer Helen Morgan, who's typecast as a drunken barroom chanteuse.)

8020903,1,B00022LJ88,"""Marie Galante"", released in 1934, was a Fox studio showcase for their bid in the European import stakes, French Ketti Gallian. Directed by the often great Henry King (but not here), the film is a dull thriller about a plot to blow up American ships in the Panama Canal. Populated by a rich array of racial sterotypes, including a Japanese played by the English Leslie Fenton and the offensive Stepin Fetchit playing a man servant, the film is dull and turgid. Spencer Tracy plays a scientist and his acting is so clearly superior to his contemporaries that he stands out like a beacon in spite of the dreary part. Gallian is made up to look like Marlene Dietrich but her command of English is poor and her part absurd. Only the imposition of the censorship could have made this heroine so naive. The highlight of the film are the 2 songs sung by the peerless Helen Morgan.

The film has been in the public domain for a long time. The print is murky, the soundtrack blurred and there are jumps in the continuity due to splicing.",1284768000,4,1028,4.526881720430108
