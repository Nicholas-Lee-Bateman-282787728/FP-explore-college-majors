1256232,4,B00002SSKU,"This is a fantastic bit of 'hang-over Sunday' cinema. The Suburbans is extremely re-watchable, due entirely to charismatic performances by Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller, the underrated Craig Bierko, and even Jennifer Love Hewitt. This would have been a hit had the director not cast himself in the lead, but even he contributes a decent performance. This movie masters the art of combining goofy male performances with sexy, yet comically apt female performances by Amy Brenneman and Bridgette Wilson. Rent the Suburbans. It's one movie that will make you wonder why it was never a hit.",1117497600,,582,5.136842105263158
1256233,3,B00002SSKU,"While not the biting satirical look at an attempt to revive a one hit wonder eighties band I was looking for, this movie did have its' moments.
Jennifer Love Hewitt plays Cate, a record company executive who comes up with the idea to revive an eighties one hit wonder pop group, The Suburbans, which basically imploded after suffering from the excesses that followed over night superstardom.  This is met with reluctance from some of the members, but the more outspoken members drive what they see is a chance to see what they missed out on, believing that they can be successful.  Donal Lardner Ward plays Danny, the quasi leader and lead guitarist who sees this as a sign relating his true path in life, especially since all of his post band ventures have failed.  Tony Guma is Rory, the overweight balding drummer who sees this as an opportunity to cash in on the band to make some much needed money, as his poor financial decisions cost him all the money he made some twenty years prior of their one hit.  Craig Beirko plays Mitch, the good looking lead singer who has never given up on being a rock star, and craves the fame they once had.  Rounding out the band is the bass player Gil, played by Wil Farrell, who basically goes along with the rest of the guys, not really needing the money or fame, as he's finically secure, but doesn't want to let the guys down.
There were some funny moments in the movie, especially when old tensions and habits within the band begin to surface, but the humor is tempered with the relationship problems between Danny and Grace (Amy Brennemen).  This tended to dilute the comedic elements and almost work against the overall humorous tone of the movie.
In one really, funny scene we see these middle-aged men try to recapture the look they once had, including hairstyles and wardrobe.  Think Flock of Seagulls twenty years later and you'll get the picture.
I felt Will Farrell wasn't used as well as he could have been.  He's extremely funny, and could have brought a lot more to the movie with a better part.  Jennifer Love Hewitt certainly brightens up the movie, adding lots of eye candy, playing the driven record company executive with an ulterior motive for seeing The Suburbans reunite.  I have to admit, I had a really hard time picturing Hewitt playing someone who remembers a band from 1981, especially when I check her bio and find out she was born in 1979.
The Suburbans started out on a strong note, but tended to trip on the subplots.  A fun movie overall, but don't expect too much, and you won't be disappointed.
Look for appearances by Robert Loggia, Antonio ""Huggy Bear"" Fargas as a club owner, Ben Stiller and Jerry Stiller as record executives, Kurt Loder as himself, and Bridget Wilson as Rory's girlfriend.",1065398400,3,2769,4.653688524590164
1256234,4,B00002SSKU,"The Suburbans was both better and worse than I expected it to be.  Admittedly, I only bought this movie because of Jennifer Love Hewitt, but it turned out to be a pretty entertaining show.  I was under the impression that JLH had only a small part in this film, so I was quite pleased to see more of her than I expected.  This was something of an unusual role for her, and she definitely looked rather exotic at times, but she is always gorgeous.  In her role as a record company executive, she sets out to resurrect a one-hit wonder group from the early 1980s called The Suburbans.  The band members are an interesting bunch of guys, all but one having forgotten their dreams of musical success and dealing with very real issues of families, commitments, and relationships.  I expected to get a lot of laughs from Will Ferrell, but he is actually sort of the straight man of the group.  This is not to say that laughs are not to be found here, though, as several scenes came out very funny indeed.  A few recognizable notables who put in appearances include Amy Brennaman, Robert Loggia, and both generations of the incredibly annoying Stillers.  The comedy begins to dissipate in the later stages as the big resurrection mania fails to live up to the hype and a couple of the guys start making the same kind of bad decisions they had made the first time around.  Each man has to ask himself whether The Suburbans are better off left in the past, and in so doing they begin to make some of the grown-up decisions about life that they have been putting off for fifteen years.  The only problem I have with the movie (besides the fact that Jennifer Love Hewitt isn't in every single scene) is the ending, which left at least two large questions unanswered in my mind.  Still, though, this movie played rather well as a whole, convincing me that, while it is no diamond in the rough, it is certainly no throwaway film to be forgotten either.",1052438400,2,1939,4.492877492877493
1256235,4,B00002SSKU,"This was a good movie, I don't know why so many people don't like it! Hewitt was awesome once again!! Like she always is!!! the Stillers were as funny as [heck]! The rest of the movie kind of dragged but was interesting enough!! The plot: A young girl, beautiful too(Jennifer Love Hewitt) tries to get The Suburbans back into the music business after 18 years since they put out an album! good movie, see it!! JLove is the best!! Ben Stiller still can be funny in movies, and as for Ferrel, I'll skip!! Good movie!!",1030406400,3,515,4.431578947368421
1256236,2,B00002SSKU,"Ya know, with Will Ferrell and Jennifer Love Hewitt in this movie, I thought it would be an awesome movie...Well, I can't always be right. The one part I did like in the movie was when Jennifer Love Hewitt showed one of her tattooes to a band member's wife... (requiring her to lift up her dress, catching a peak at her undies)  :D  Nice...",976579200,6,340,4.296875
1256237,3,B00002SSKU,"Ok, a lot of people are hammering this movie pretty hard and their  opinions are justified. This movie is sort of wack. But it does have enough  moments, excuse me, enough Jennifer Love Hewitt to make me like this film.  The acting is subpar with the exceptions of Hewitt and Brenneman, and it  isn't even remotely funny. Basically this movie gets a good rating because  of JLH's awesome presence here.",968803200,,402,4.685714285714286

1256240,1,B00002SSKU,"Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ben Stiller...big stars, this film could only be great, yeah?...wrong. A heap of talent wasted their time doing this piece of junk. It is a 70 min something comedy about a group of 80's rockers who decide to reform, and then decide not too. Love Hewitt is the sexy band  manager, but what a useless role. Ben and Jerry Stiller are record execs,  and filling out the band are Will Ferrel (A Night at the Roxbury), Craig  Bierko (The Thirteenth Floor) and a couple of other familiar faces. Amy  Brennemann (Casper, Daylight) plays a girlfriend of one of the band  members.

The all cast is great. And story very funny to. I wish I gave you more details. But it will take long time to writhe. And I believe you should go on your instinct. And first of all, have a good mood to watch a film. Because some people force them self to watch some DVD, then they din't liked. But the truth is, film great, but maybe person was not meant to watch in that particular moment. So, time is everything. And no point disappointed to quick. Please be patient and enjoy it.

7916230,3,B00002SSKU,"The Suburbans is a film that you may have never heard of.  It was a flop at the box office in 1999 but I liked it.  This was not a bad movie.  I had heard of it back in 2000 but decided not to rent it and I was wrong.  In my view, you have to be about 30 to really understand the meaning or crux of this film.  It is really about finding real happiness and how far you go to pursue a pipe dream.  J. Love Hewitt is good in this film and so is the supporting cast.  It is  a lot of dry humor but does have its moments of middle life crisis jokes and disgust with ones life in the form of cynical humor.  It was a limited release film in 1999 and that may have contributed to its only making about $14,000 at the box office.  Nobody saw it because it only played at 14 theaters in the US.  The band was a one hit wonder and they realize this as the movie goes on.  The plot is really about finding ones own view of happiness and how luck can determine major aspects of our life.  There is a lot of good music here and if you really like Hewitt, Will Ferrel and the 1980's.  You will like it.",1314316800,,1089,3.8035714285714284
7916231,3,B00002SSKU,"Why did this movie even get green lighted? It has ""vanity project"" written all over it. Donal Lardner Ward directs and has the lead. He also wrote it, along with Tony Guma, who is also in it. Who is Donal Lardner Ward, anyway? It turns out that he is the Great-grandson of writer Ring Lardner; and the grand-nephew of Academy Award winning screenwriter and Hollywood Ten member Ring Lardner Jr. Donal's Father was co-founder of New York's Elaine's restaurant. He has about five other acting credits besides The Suburbans, but the only film I've heard of was The Royal Tenenbaums. He played a hotel clerk. Maybe his real life was like The Royal Tenenbaums, a family with a lot of nutty but talented characters.

For some reason, I am reminded of back when I was in Pencey, a prep school I had the misfortune of attending, and I was reading this book. The book I was reading was this book I took out of the library by mistake. They gave me the wrong book, and I didn't notice it till I got back to my room. They gave me Out of Africa, by Isak Dinesen. I thought it was going to stink, but it didn't. It was a very good book. I'm quite illiterate, but I read a lot. My favorite author is my brother D.B., and my next favorite is Ring Lardner. My brother gave me a book by Ring Lardner for my birthday, just before I went to Pencey. It had these very funny, crazy plays in it, and then it had this one story about a traffic cop that falls in love with this very cute girl that's always speeding. Only, he's married, the cop, so he can't marry her or anything. Then this girl gets killed, because she's always speeding. That story just about killed me.

What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though. I wouldn't mind calling this Isak Dinesen up. And Ring Lardner, except that D.B. told me he's dead. You take that book Of Human Bondage, by Somerset Maugham, though. I read it last summer. It's a pretty good book and all, but I wouldn't want to call Somerset Maugham up. I don't know. He just isn't the kind of a guy I'd want to call up, that's all. I'd rather call old Thomas Hardy up. I like that Eustacia Vye.

Ring Lardner, Donal Lardner Ward's Great-grandfather, was pals with F. Scott Fitzgerald, and he was published by Maxwell Perkins, who was F. Scott's editor. His first book, You Know Me Al, an epistolary novel, was written in the form of letters from Jack Keefe, a bush league ball player, to his friend Al back home. Originally published in the Saturday Evening Post as a series, Lardner thought so little of his writing that he didn't even keep copies. To publish them he had to get copies from the magazine. He thought of himself as a sports columnist whose work had little lasting value. He continued to think so even after serious people such as Virginia Woolf praised his book. He was in some respects the model for Abe North in Fitzgerald's last completed novel, Tender Is the Night. He influenced Ernest Hemmingway, who sometimes wrote articles for his high school newspaper under the pseudonym Ring Lardner, Jr.

Ringgold Wilmer Lardner's son, the real Ring Lardner, Jr., and Donal Lardner Ward's Grand-uncle, was a screenwriter who was blacklisted after WWII as one of the Hollywood Ten, screenwriters who were incarcerated for contempt of Congress after refusing to answer questions posed by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). He won two Academy Awards for his screenplays--one before (for Woman of the Year in 1942) and one after (for M*A*S*H in 1970) his imprisonment and blacklisting.

So now the story makes a little more sense, how this guy, Donal Lardner Ward, had the audacity to direct and star in The Suburbans. There is another interesting back story: it was the first script that Tony Guma wrote. Beginner's luck. He had taught High School for many years, and he just wrote a script, without ever even seeing what a script looked like. I can picture the two of them collaborating. They are scheming to see who gets to make out with Jennifer Love Hewitt. They flip a coin. They decide that Ward will get to make out with her, but he won't do anything, because he's married. Guma gets to be the rebound guy, but all the action happens off-screen.

The Suburbans is not very good, but Jennifer Love Hewitt, as Cate with a ""C"" is great as a young record executive who wants to revive the career of The Suburbans, a band she idolized back in the 80's. She is both smart and stupid -- smart about the music business, even though with regards to The Suburbans, she may be guided more by her heart than her head -- but she can't figure out how to use a coffee filter or make a cup of tea. There is a great little scene where The Suburbans meet the label: Cate,  Speedo Silverberg (Jerry Stiller), and Jay Rose (Ben Stiller). Two generations of Stillers and a Love Hewitt. I really like Jennifer Love Hewitt in this. She is the best thing about it, in my opinion.

One thing I like about the script is that they have Cate with a ""C"" quoting William Butler Yeats, and they leave the quote in. That is something that Guma, the former High School English Teacher, probably slipped in there. Here is the sonnet that the quote is from:

Never give all the heart
by W. B. Yeats

Never give all the heart, for love
Will hardly seem worth thinking of
To passionate women if it seem
Certain, and they never dream
That it fades out from kiss to kiss;
For everything that's lovely is
But a brief, dreamy, kind delight.
O never give the heart outright,
For they, for all smooth lips can say,
Have given their hearts up to the play.
And who could play it well enough
If deaf and dumb and blind with love?
He that made this knows all the cost,
For he gave all his heart and lost.

The Suburbans is kind of like That Thing You Do, about a group of One Hit Wonders, only this one is about a group of One Hit Wonders from the 80's, making a comeback. It is more about mid life crisis and aging regrets.

-------------------------------
Mitch: Don't let Grace ""Yoko"" The Suburbans.
=========================================

And that is not exactly a winning strategy. Why dwell on the sour aftermath, why not just take the exhilarating roller coaster ride, and deal with all that mess in epilogue? Tom Hanks got that right at least.

Will Ferrell is in The Suburbans, but he doesn't play his usual perpetual adolescent. He plays a successful businessman who doesn't really want to make a comeback. The stock in his company is down 18% since The Suburbans' video aired on MTV. I still wonder why Ferrell, the Stillers, and Love Hewitt even agreed to do this project, but I figure that they just wanted to get better tables at Elaine's.

7916232,4,B00002SSKU,"I do agree with the other reviewers that there was a lot more that could have been done with the premise, but for my money this was a light, enjoyable romp through the music biz, with an amazingly beautiful JLoveH, a funny-as-always Will Ferrell, and a hilarious turn by the father/son Stiller team.

Still, the anchor in all of this is Amy Brenneman, who turns in a deft, mature performance that keeps the film rolling over the sometimes spotty script and direction.  Let me say this, too -- by the end of the movie you will love the Suburbans' one-hit song.",1222992000,,559,4.524752475247524
