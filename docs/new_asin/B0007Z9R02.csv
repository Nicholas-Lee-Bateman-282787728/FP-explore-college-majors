2254131,5,B0007Z9R02,"Received when promised.  Have always enjoyed ""Wind in the Willows"", and now I can pass it on to my grandkids.  It's been hard to find it because it is so old but now I've got it and am very happy.",1235606400,,196,3.875
2254132,4,B0007Z9R02,This volume contains short animated classics that are awesome - my favorite volume of the three timeless classics.  My granddaughter can quote from memory all the words from Ferdinand the Bull.  She is entranced by Wind in The Willows and is asking to read that book.  All my old favorites are here.  And apparently they will become my grandchild's favorites as well.  Don't you love when that happens?  The only disappointment was that this volume does not accrue any points for disney rewards.,1235260800,4,495,4.903614457831325
2254133,4,B0007Z9R02,"Both of my daughters are in their 20's now, but when they were very young they LOVED ""Wind in the Willows."" We found the DVD's at Amazon and purchased them for Christmas. Can't wait to see their faces when they unwrap these gifts and are taken back to their childhood.",1229817600,2,268,4.38
2254134,5,B0007Z9R02,Growing up I can remember watching these Disney cartoons.  Now that I have two kids of my own.  It is great to share these classic Disney favorites with them.,1207440000,,158,4.413793103448276
2254135,4,B0007Z9R02,The older Disney cartoons are still the best.  Many have not been seen in years and are now available.  I relish every moment watching this DVD.  Ferdinand The Bull has always been a favorite.  Now I have it forever.,1176422400,6,216,4.461538461538462
2254136,5,B0007Z9R02,Reminded me of old times. Great DVD to have for the children.,1171411200,8,61,4.166666666666667
2254137,3,B0007Z9R02,"***** Five Stars for the cartoons themselves!  I give the low *** three start rating because WE ALREADY HAVE THEM ON DVD!

This collection is a cheaply put-together, un restored, re-release of cartoons from the DISNEY TREASURES TINS!  THESE ARE NOT FROM THE SAME MASTERS!  So why buy something you already have?

1) THE UGLY DUCKLING (1939) also on the ""Disney Treasures: Silly Symphonies"" DVD release.

2) COUNTRY COUSIN (1936) also on the ""Disney Treasures: Silly Symphonies"" DVD release.

3) FERDINAND THE BULL (1938) also on the ""Disney Treasures: Rarities"" DVD release.

4) WIND IN THE WILLOWS (1949) segement from the feature Icabod & Mr. Toad. Amazon sells the entire feature for just $15.99

With the Disney Treasures DVD releases on limited availability, I guess Disney hopes those who missed out will buy these 4-cartoon discs. The low price is misleading, when you break it down to individual cartoon cost this release is EXPENSIVE!

And no extras!",1124236800,64,959,5.050955414012739

2254162,5,B0007Z9R02,What impress me most about Timeless Tales is how very well Disney have restored the old cartoons. Having seen most of them before as very scratch copies it was a pure joy to see them again as new.,1273795200,,196,4.184210526315789

8054516,5,B0007Z9R02,Good Movie!  A great deal for hard to find shorts.,1442966400,,50,4.0
8054517,5,B0007Z9R02,"Volume 2 of Disney's Timeless tales collection contains only 4 shorts; The Wind in the Willows runs for 35 minutes, credits and all, mixed with the restored & uncut presentation from The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, Disney's 11th animated feature, and the credits of the 1950's single-short print. The other 3 shorts are all Oscar-winning gems; The Ugly Duckling (1939), Ferdinand the Bull (1938), and The Country Cousin (1936), all uncut! Like volume 1, volume 2 also has a bonus storybook if you like to read The Wind in the Willows as a real book. It wouldn't be until 2014 when the entire movie of The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad got restored in HD for Disney Blu-ray, for its 65th anniversary, not only on its own, but also as a 2-Movie Collection with Fun and Fancy Free, AND the whole movie The Reluctant Dragon as a bonus program (the live-action movie AND animated short) with that set. It's a shame most classic Disney shorts collections on DVD are in the Disney Vault now, so just be thankful for what you still have.",1438128000,2,1042,4.60752688172043

8054520,4,B0007Z9R02,This DVD is a beautiful storybook-like video about the Wind and the Willows and the Ugly Duckling and more. It is nicely produced and the stories are classic tales that children as well as young at heart adults will enjoy. I bought it mainly because of the Wind & the Willows(The adventures of Mr. Toad) in which I am a great fan of. It is not the usual violent garbage that children and adults are use to viewing. It is just a nice compilation of a few classic tales put out by Disney when Disney was worth watching.,1426204800,5,517,4.285714285714286
