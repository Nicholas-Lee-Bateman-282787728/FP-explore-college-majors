5711272,5,B00CBDG50S,"This is another great show , there is now English Dub, only subtitle!!! This anime show is funny but there is a lot of unfinished story in the end!!",1390348800,,148,4.137931034482759
5711273,2,B00CBDG50S,The idea behind it is okay but the implementation wasn't all that great.  Besides who likes getting whacked in the head with a baseball bat?,1380672000,,140,4.6
5711274,4,B00CBDG50S,"If you are not a fast reader, keep your finger on the pause button. I loved the story line, though i""m not a fan of the ""endless ending"" where they leave it at ""life goes on"" (and open for a sequel). Other than that it is a good series.",1378857600,,236,3.836734693877551
5711275,5,B00CBDG50S,This anime has a good combination of what I like to see in a series. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good story with a little comedy.,1377302400,,145,3.8666666666666667
5711276,5,B00CBDG50S,I have been watching anime since 1963 when astro boy and gigantor and 8 man were all the rage but I look at all the new anime out their and I have to say this is buy far one of my favorites just behind Ladies versus Butlers.  The art work is by far the best I have seen and when I say this guy can draw its because I can draw and I wish I had just some of his tallent.  The story line is just as good if you love slap stick humor than this is the disc for you.  people forget that anime is an art form all on it's own now I wouldn't let kids under say 15 view this because of nudity and content. I will watch anime till the day I die as long as they have anime like this,1376179200,2,670,3.606896551724138
5711277,5,B00CBDG50S,"I'd love it even more if they sold the extra episodes with it (I haven't checked my dvd copy that I bought to see what it has on it yet), but this anime is awesome! The onyl thing you should be wary of is that the makers of this anime didn't seem to understand that ladies don't pee themselves when they receive sudden immense pleasure. That blue-haired girls pees quite a bit. Otherwise, I love this anime! The boy doesn't have too much to do with the series, and the girls aren't really fighting over him or anything (and they aren't sharing him, either. Yes, Asobi ni Iku Yo, I AM grumbling at you for taking that route!), and you end up liking the characters quite a bit. After watching the episodes on dvd, watch the 6 short episodes as well. They're incredibly ecchi! So ecchi that it almost goes too far!! It's fantastic!",1375401600,,828,4.383116883116883
5711278,4,B00CBDG50S,"I first saw this anime at crunchyroll.com but it was censored nor did crunchyroll have the shorts so to this day I still have not seen the short episodes. Now I personally found this anime really good and it was really funny, my favorite character being Arestta and that being because she is such a masochist. It has it share of fan service so it cool with me. Now one of the most noticeable problems will be the audio, it seems to be off for some reason kinda like it was on mono instead of stereo but its really hard to explain so sorry. Now I myself as well as others have gone to Media Blasters facebook page and complain about the audio and so far MB has denied any problems with the audio, I've yet to recieve a response from them. So far the video quality is good but its the sound that its messed up. So it sucks that Media Blasters drop the ball on this one, hopefully they don't do this with future titles especially their Kitty Label titles.",1373932800,5,952,4.236263736263736
5711279,3,B00CBDG50S,"this includes the bare bones episodes 1-12 on 3 DVD discs.
I'm pretty sure when the series was first announced the extras were planned
quote: (Contains episodes 1-12 plus bonus short episodes 1-6.)
however, for some reason the bonus shorts were taken out

This show has a few risque scenes and is uncensored where as the TV series that aired on crunchyroll was not
nothing offense, just a typical harem type comedy
you should be able to find this for under 15$ so can't really complain
media blasters needs your support, if you are looking for cheap decent anime, here is a good place to start

The series is a few years old now
show quality is similar to Genshiken season2
Upscaling looks decent
edges can be a little blocky in exchange for better sharpness and there is no heavy interlacing which is a good thing
need to buy a little more for that Super saver shipping? This is a great cart topper.",1372982400,7,900,4.515337423312883
5711280,5,B00CBDG50S,"UPDATE:As this was pre-ordered,I got it today and immediately put it to the test:It is UNCENSORED, rated 16+, not for the kiddies;there are a few scenes not really for anyone under 18. The service was excellent,there  are three discs and extra scenes are drawn,most being anti-piracy ads. There is no reason I am able to find for this series to be so cheap and,as such I have ordered a ""spare"".This is a kinky little comedy.
Plug is a Charger Girl (Ju-den Chan) from a parallel universe. Her job is to seek out depressed people in our world and recharge them. Plug is also not the brightest of bulbs but has a sweet personality,good heart and is determained to do the best for the people. Her co-worker,Arrasta, is opposite in nearly all respects and approaches the job as just a job;quitting time is quitting time and quantity over quality. She also has serious knockers...and classes. The two get along about as well as two cats with their tails tied together. The story includes a young male that can see them,even in their ""stealth"" mode as they fly around,even through walls, looking for people to charge up. He is startled when Plug flies through the wall at the resturant where he works and he instinctively hits her with a baseball bat. He does this to both her and Arasta frequently,causing Arasta to become enjoy it. In the background an anime series is being played,from time to time,on available TV's featuring a magic girl named Milly.
The artists that drew this series probably paid apt attention in anatomy classes as aspects particular to the female seem to be correct and well-detailed as one might expect when the girls wear a rubber suit of about one micron thick....without underwear. As this series is well paced and directed it is also well recommended. The cost of this DVD is about 1/3rd less than ones from the ""other"" market.",1369785600,15,1851,4.730650154798762
8579788,4,B00CBDG50S,"So packed with fanservice that it could border on the absurd, but this was a fun anime to watch. The main male character is a good one, hard-working, reasonably irritated when the situation calls for it, and a good guy. So rare in anime of this type. His nose design is a bit distracting. Still, he can see the women from a parallel world that visit earth to recharge sad humans. That part of it isn't explained so well, but it's so different from other anime of this type. Refreshing. There are enough glimpses into this parallel world to keep my interest. I'd enjoy seeing more of the series. The Japanese voice acting is good, with the option right on the menu screen. Nice. The charaters are pretty standard, but well done enough. Towards the end, it seems more and more details and charaters pour out of the parallel world, like the creators finally felt they could share it. Looking forward to the next installment.",1487808000,,921,4.587878787878788
8579789,4,B00CBDG50S,"This is a fun and silly show, and there is little reason for it to be rated ""adults only.""
Still, there is enough risqu&eacute; material that young children probably shouldn't view it--
to save you answering the awkward questions which  would inevitably arise: ""Daddy,
why does she pee on herself when he hits her with the bat?""
Seriously, this series is well worth a look, so long as you aren't offended by
absurdities such as the above. There is a fair amount of fan service, but nothing
over the top.
Like some of the other reviewers, I also had trouble with the sound track. There was
an annoying echo effect when played on my surround-sound system; it took some
experimenting with different sound modes till I found one that minimized this.",1476144000,,745,4.687022900763359
8579790,5,B00CBDG50S,"I received my copy fairly quickly, and the series itself is packaged nicely. While I've outgrown the show personally, I was satisfied at the time of purchase and don't regret my purchase at all!",1443657600,,194,4.735294117647059
8579791,4,B00CBDG50S,"better than avarage, samari story",1441756800,,33,5.8
8579792,3,B00CBDG50S,"This show in the DVD version shows the real female, and that said it is very funny. The only thing that prevents a five star is that the male figure see's no problem in hitting girls with baseball bats otherwise it is so much fun.",1429833600,,230,4.133333333333334
8579793,1,B00CBDG50S,"This dvd broke my dvd vcr combo don't buy if you got a magnavox dvd vcr combo the story line sounded good but not worth lossing my almost new dvd combo
  p.s this is the only bad review I ever wrote for the 158 dvd's I bought. But I thought it's worth it to spare another anime fan from the loss it cost me .",1425945600,,308,3.723076923076923
8579794,4,B00CBDG50S,i like the series its straight up comedy through and through but the one thing that irritates me is the sound quality it sounds all muffled and i have a huge problem with that but other than that the story is good even though the main guy is a total jerk got a 4 for sound,1422230400,,272,3.875

8579797,3,B00CBDG50S,A gift for my adult daughter.  I finally watched it and thought it was all right - except for the incredibly insensitive baseball bat strikes to the heads and bodies for laughs.  That kind of misogynistic crap doesn't belong in any format.,1410739200,,239,4.666666666666667
