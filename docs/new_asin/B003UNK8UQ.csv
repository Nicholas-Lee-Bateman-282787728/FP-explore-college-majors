8406092,1,B003UNK8UQ,"Don't be fooled. Anyone who says this movie is good either was paid to say or was in it. Yikes, I couldn't get past the first 15 minuets. It was very poorly made. The lack of a preview should have clued me in.",1445299200,,209,3.883720930232558
8406093,3,B003UNK8UQ,"Movie was done like a video game preview. Cute. Oh and the second guy wasn't lieing the cut outs to the green screen don't always match the actors Arms, faces etc.",1295222400,3,163,4.290322580645161
8406094,1,B003UNK8UQ,"This movie sucked and did not appear, IMHO, to be professionally made.  The special effects overlapped the actors arms & hands during multiple scenes.  Really bad!!!!",1278892800,3,166,5.346153846153846
8406095,5,B003UNK8UQ,"ATTENTION SCI-FI/HORROR FANATICS!!!  You should check this movie out, because there are really cool effects, great storyline, it's gripping, killer soundtrack, & it's something everyone should add to their movie collection!  You WILL want to wach this again & again-there's alot of detail, if one should miss any part of it. It's very creative & original. *I watched the dvd again just to see what CANOPUS was referring to, & again, my review still stands.. There are KILLER special effects, it's very entertaining.  There's also behind-the-scene-footage, & deleted scenes as an extra added bonus!!!  Definitely order yourself a copy now!",1278720000,2,638,5.35
