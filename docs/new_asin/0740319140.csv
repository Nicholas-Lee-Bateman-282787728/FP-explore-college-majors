179948,5,0740319140,"This shows that you don't need special effects to make a film special.  Following in the tradition of films like Fireproof, A Letter To Dad is shot on a lower budget but carries an impressive cast (John Ashton, Paul Gleason, Mario Van Peebles). It starts a little slow and may seem after the first ten minutes like this will be a series of extended music video segments.  However, once Dan's father Mike starts reading his son's letter and begins reflecting on the past, the film soars and never drops.

This touches on an unfortunately common case in today's society.  However, it needs to be seen and will be a blessing not only for broken families but for all.  God has done some amazing works inspiring talented film makers in cinema in recent years, and this is another highly recommended entry.  Don't miss it!",1252454400,7,816,4.671328671328672

179952,5,0740319140,"This is an example of God's help in a nasty marriage. A couple's abuse also affects their children, but the title character fought the anger for his future by communicating his feelings.",1392249600,,186,4.84375
179953,4,0740319140,I like good Christian movies this one was pretty good and I would recommend it to others lots of people have or has had a similar experience in their lifetime and can really relate to this movie,1389830400,,194,4.27027027027027
179954,3,0740319140,"The best part of this movie was the incerpts from the past--both my husband and I enjoyed that and thought if they would have just made a movie about what all happened in the past then bring it all to present day at the end--would have been the best. As it is right now--it is a agonizingly SLOW. My husband hated all the music --i understand they used that instead of conversation. I ended up fast forwarding some of the scenes of just music--it was just to drawn out and slow. Also--this movie held very little meaning for me. I personally only see a person getting something from this movie --if --thy come from a split home(divorce) and /or drinking of a parent. Since there was not any of that in my family -it was hard for me to ""get into"" the movie.
Also the main character (dan) kind of seems like a ""wuss"" to me. My husband had to agree slightly on that point--he could not see a grown man puking and cryng like that--made him sissy-fied.
I was going to give this a 3 star but my opinion is not the same as yours. There was some good things about this movie --if you are the right person.
There is no sex or cursing in this movie. You do see the use of alcohol but --it is shown in a negative manner and in no way promotes the use of it.",1386547200,2,1246,4.131687242798354
179955,4,0740319140,"Talk about a major flashback. Half of this story takes place in the past as the hero has to consider that he might be like his father - and if so does not want to jeopardize ruining the life of his true love. Gritty and edgy scenes of teenage reality combined with the innocence of childhood and the navet of seekers of true love present an interesting contrast. An interesting confrontation between father and son put me through a emotional tug of war. It was evident that both parties were the victim of divorce. It was also very obvious that people can't live in the past and dwell on prior hurts if they wish to lead productive and satisfying lives. The content was obviously not constructed to impress the Dove folks, since there are several scenes that will cause them to use their red pen, though there was nothing that caused me to throw a flag.",1358812800,,853,4.4743589743589745

179958,2,0740319140,"A slow moving film with too many flashbacks to the boy's past.
Many dysfunctional people in the cast, and thus a mostly unhappy movie.
Can't think of anything good to say about it.
Glad I rented the film and didn't buy it.
Don't recommend you see it.",1341014400,,250,4.340425531914893

7795820,3,0740319140,"Very serious Christian movie on strained marriages, divorce, the long-term impact of absentee fathers, and the ability to finally overcome all of these difficulties (and forgive) with God's help.  Although there is no foul language, sex or violence, there is plenty of domestic emotional abuse and pain, which makes this movie too dark for my tastes. The first 95% of the movie primarily consists of a vivid recollection of childhood emotional pain, while the last 5% shows forgiveness and healing.  Despite the saying that all's well that ends well, the happy ending comes too late to redeem the overall tone of the film, which is dark and somber.",1506124800,,648,4.9907407407407405

7795828,5,0740319140,"This movie is Epic! A true story and every father and potential father ought to see this movie. I would definitely show it to teenage boys who are sexually active, should they become unexpected fathers. This movie so about being stuck, tired, becoming aware and taking charge of one's life to have healthy relationships with others. You have to forgive so you don't become bitter and bitterness will block love and take away your joy and peace. Love overcomes it all",1434931200,,466,4.765432098765432
