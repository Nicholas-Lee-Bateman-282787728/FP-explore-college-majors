8523282,2,B007Z4M142,"I didn't find the DVD to be what I expected. It advertised ""beyond the basics"" and I found it to be a partial explanation of the two A65 guides that I previously purchased , ie A65 for Dummies & one other. In my opinion this DVD was not ""beyond the basics"".
I was looking for brief and direct explanation of previously unexplained procedures and process's with this relatively complicated camera. Didn't happen. I'd like to return the DVD",1419552000,,438,4.628205128205129

8523285,5,B007Z4M142,"The QuickPro guide ""Sony A65 Beyond the Basics"" is an informative guide to help learn the many advanced functions of the camera.  I also have the ""Sony A65"" QuickPro guide which really helps you to get started using the camera.  ""Beyond the Basics"" is a very good next step. They are well done and the DVD makes it easy to go back and repeat a topic for better understanding. The DVD is divided into 10 chapters
