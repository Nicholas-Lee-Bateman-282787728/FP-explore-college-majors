Well, I am happy to say that I am thrilled I bought this DVD, watched it over Christmas, immediately downloaded Maria's book on my kobo because I wanted & needed to know & understand more of what she was saying.  I have since ordered many more copies of her book & the DVD because I can't seem to keep them in my lending library, more & more people want to borrow them & low & behold, they are then lending them to their friends.  Actions speak much louder than words, the action that's been taking place both at my home & work place speaks volumes.

If you haven't watched this DVD yet, I would say, put it on the top of your list of things to do & you'll be glad that you did.",1366243200,,795,4.109677419354838
8507657,5,B0070C13HK,"I've read a lot of books about money, building wealth and finances and didn't expect to learn anything new. But I came away with so many tools that I put to use immediately. I'm so excited about this video, that I'm inviting friends over this weekend to watch it together. I want to see it again, and I think that anyone who doesn't live in a sense of mastery over their money should see this. Her concepts are easy to grasp and to apply, and very powerful in changing the direction of my financial life. Maria is a gifted speaker, and amazing coach and the video itself is extremely well produced. If I could give it 6 stars I would!",1358380800,,634,4.291666666666667
8507658,5,B0070C13HK,"Maria's new DVD is very very well done.  It is not only instructive, but also entertaining.  It was absolutely great the way she presented the material. She gets right to the point leaving you with a sense of gratitude at the end.  Time well spent.  And the four coaching session that followed her presentation were a fantastic bonus.",1327622400,,334,4.706896551724138
8507659,5,B0070C13HK,"""Money doesn't grow on trees"". It ""can't buy you love"" and it is ""the root of all evil"". But without money we worry, we lose sleep, get stressed out and can't pay our bills. It is no wonder that many of us have ""a love/hate relationship with it"", especially during the current difficult economic times.

In her new DVD, THE ENERGY OF MONEY, Dr. Maria Nemeth gives us all a path towards living with more ""clarity, focus, ease and grace"" and developing a healthier relationship towards ""Mr. Green"".  Despite the emotionally difficult nature of the subject matter, Dr. Nemeth helps us break down the reasons and dynamics of this often love/hate relationship.

Through funny anecdotes and real life stories, based on a lifetime of research, personal experience and seminars on the subject , Dr. Nemeth then helps us develop our ""life's intentions"" and see how fixing ""money leaks"" can help us create ""games worth playing"" and convert ""visionary reality"" into ""physical reality"" through ""small, sweet steps"".  She helps us set realistic goals and create practical steps on how to better achieve these personal financial goals, whatever they are, with grace and to better enjoy life. It is a spiritual journey we can all benefit by and for the cost of a DVD, great value we can all enjoy. I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to find more happiness and grace in their life.",1327190400,2,1380,4.834745762711864
