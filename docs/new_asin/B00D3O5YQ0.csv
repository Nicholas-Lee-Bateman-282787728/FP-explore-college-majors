8589121,5,B00D3O5YQ0,"Outstanding all around. The programming is imaginative, embedding a very familiar piece in with others less likely to be heard in concertbut well worth hearing nonetheless. The theme would suggest that all the pieces come from America, but I'm not sure about the Stravinsky. He eventually became a US citizen, but not until 1945. He completed The Song of the Nightingale in 1917, so there wouldn't seen to be an American connection. No such question with Ives and Adams. The big work is, of course, the Dvorak, and this is one of the best performances of it you're likely to hear, let alone watch. If I had to sum up what makes this ""New World"" so exceptional, it would be the freshness of the performance: it sounds like Nelsons and his orchestra are playing the piece for the first time. Not an easy task for a warhorse like this. The Largo is a special highlight, sounding as if suspended in time, yet keeping you constantly engrossed in its unfolding. The Blu-ray video and sound quality are also first class, and the camera work keeps everything moving and focused on moving the musical narrative forward.
