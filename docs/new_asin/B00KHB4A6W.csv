8658899,5,B00KHB4A6W,"This video goes into great detail without leaving any stone unturned. That is, except for previews of questions to be answered in future videos. Ron Stephenson does a great job of not only explaining his beliefs, but uses pictures and diagrams that give you a fresh new look on the world we live in. Don't bother getting out the 3D glasses, because after this video, that's just old school.",1401062400,,390,4.666666666666667
8658900,4,B00KHB4A6W,"Faith and science don't have to be opposed to one another.  I do believe, personally, that such a dichotomy is more a modern concept.  Those of faith will be fascinated by what is presented here and will likely have their faith strengthened.  This especially, if one believes that one cannot fully know, nor fully understand all things ""Scripture"" in one's lifetime.  It is a lifelong process for most.

If one is a skeptic or even simply agnostic, I believe this will also be fascinating.  If nothing else, I believe it will give the viewer something to think about and perhaps crack open that Bible and give it another look over.  Perhaps it'll generate more questions than answers, but I assure you that the material covered in this DVD is not typically found in most churches or Bible studies which I find very refreshing.  As a believer, God calls each to be stretched in their faith and the material in this DVD will perhaps stretch the limits of one's imagination, but with promising and surprising results!  There is scripture throughout this DVD if you're concerned with material that strays from Holy writ.  As Acts 17:11 says, test all things against the authority of Scripture.

One cannot say that there is no God with 100% certainty, because to do so would mean that they would have to declare they know everything.  No one knows everything.  Watch with an open mind, both believer and non-believer alike and see where this DVD takes you.  I found it to be enjoyable to watch, although I had to watch some segments a few times over to ""get it"" and had to laugh when Mr. Stephenson kept ""closing"" his presentation, not once, but a couple of times!  It's worth it to stick it out to the end though!  I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone interested in the Bible and how it relates to modern day scientific topics of which science is still exploring.",1400716800,,1868,4.649390243902439
