8622626,5,B00GFLULF2,One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Been a John Abraham fan and follower from his very first movie and has seen him evolving as an actor through the years and have appreciated his making movies with meaning. This is by far his best work. Having grown up through the years of the LTF fighting and having had friends whose families which actually went through the war appreciate the raw and natural depiction of the trauma and reality of those years. Fantastic job!  A must watch for everyone!,1515196800,,506,4.440860215053763

Dance and actions and lot of  tears for no reason .
