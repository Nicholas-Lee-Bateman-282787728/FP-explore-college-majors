Who needs a major studio when you have the whole borough of Long Island to film in. You don't need distinguished actors for a film like this, it's perfect as is. I used to rent this movie when video stores were still around in Philadelphia, now I own it. Nathan Schiff's films to me are totally original and this one came out during the beginning of 80's horror/slasher but was  one of many films to be overshadowed by Friday The 13th. This one and They Don't Cut The Grass Anymore never really made any money so hopefully Image hooked this dude up. My favorite line in the movie is when the girl jumps out of the guys van and he screams ""Its not easy being the son of a leper""!",1429488000,,833,4.272151898734177

""LONG ISLAND CANNIBAL MASSACRE"" is not any of these things it has nothing that can SAVE!!!it!!! its filled with ABSOLUTE HORRID ACTING(im not joking this makes the acting in redneck zombies look superb!?!?!?)/THE("")(UN"") DIRECTING WASN'T EVEN DIRECTING IT WAS A GUY WITH A CAMERA & THATS ALL/THE GORE/EFX WERE SO UNREALISTIC THEY MIGHT AS WELL CUT THE KNEE CAP OFF & PULL THE INTSTINES OUT FROM THERE IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN!!!!JUST NOT ACURATE AT ALL/NOW WE GET TO THE WORST PART OF ALL!! THE STORY!!(guy pays 2 other guys to kill chicks so he can feed them to his unbelieveble unrealisticly deformed father??????)& people when you see what his father looks like your going to either break the dvd player or the dvd it self or throw something through the tv ,freeze in agony & defeat that you spent money on this or all of the above & then some!!!!! bottom line is there is nothing artistic about this low budget flick its low budget all around & THATS NOT GOOD!!!!! THIS IS NOT A JOKE THIS IS A WARNING STAY CLEAR AWAY FROM THIS ("")(UN"") MOVIE!!!DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR ESPECIALY YOUR MONEY!!!!! EVEN THE GORE COULDN'T SAVE THIS BELOW GRADE Z MESS!!!!! p.s. if you want a true low budget gore flick get any of the other ones that i mentioned above or look up the names ""HERSCHELL GORDON LEWIS,PETER JACKSON,PERICLES LEWNES OR UMBERTO LENZI!!! just don't bother with ""LONG ISLAND CANNIBAL MASSACRE"" ITS NOT EVEN A MOVIE ITS CRAP!

Long Island Cannibal Massacre is an incredible find! This shot on Super-8 horror movie totally caught me by surprise, as I was expecting just another cheap, gory run of the mill schlocker. Was I surprised to find that this movie actually has a great story and genuinely frightening characters. Briefly, the plot concerns a series of murders committed by two hired killers, a biker and a masked nut job. Turns out that the hire-ee is a guy who's committed to feeding his leper father human female flesh. A two-fisted hero cop tries to put an end to the mayhem, but surprises upon surprises assault you from every angle. You just never know where this blood bath will take you next. While the acting isn't so hot, and the films budget is obviously very low, one must give credit to anyone capable of pulling off an effective and atmospheric little chestnut such as this. The photography is quite good and some of the make-up effects are mind-blowing for something on this budget. The DVD has interviews & commentaries with the director, Nathan Schiff, who could do wonders if he had a real budget! As well as interviews with two of the cast members. It's all quite fascinating listening to these penniless entrepreneurs make the most of what they had, and succeeding where many big-budget Hollywood films of a similar nature fail. Highly recommended to any fan of ultra-low-budget horror made with gusto and imagination, rather than huge budgets and polish.",1081382400,5,1477,4.861111111111111
