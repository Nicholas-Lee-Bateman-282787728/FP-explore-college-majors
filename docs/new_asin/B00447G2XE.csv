4260288,5,B00447G2XE,"Anyone who has listened to Behemoth's latest magnum opus, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evangelion/dp/B002DKF47O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evangelion</a>,"" recognizes that this Polish blackened death metal band has truly turned a corner, and is now garnering more success, more respect, and more awards than ever before in their history.""Evangelia Heretika,"" a thunderous, three disc, Christ-grinding DVD set serves as documentation and a continuation of ""Evangelion's"" live energy and triumph. Composed of two live shows (Warsaw 2009 and Paris 2008, about 1.5 hours each), two one-hour on-the-road documentaries, the band's entire music video collection, and an audio CD of the 2009 Warsaw gig, it is something sure to keep any fan of Behemoth happily occupied until the band once again conquers the road or studio.

Like all Behemoth releases, ""Evangelia Heretika"" is something tough to contend with. The Warsaw show has a considerable amount of post-production gilding, and the break-neck speed of the music is married quite skillfully to the video with insanely fast cuts that hurry to keep up with the thrashing dissonance of the music. The setlist is fierce and brutal, and sure to make you push your speakers to their largest capacity. In such a case, I would recommend those with 5.1 home theaters to actually opt instead for the 2.0 stereo as the rear channel mixing isn't worth the juice spent by your receiver to power the other speakers: just push it all to the front two and your subwoofer and enjoy.

Front-man Nergal's showmanship is devilishly congruent to his musicianship. Songs seem almost akin to spells, and equally exhausting to both conjure and witness. But when successfully executed, each unleash an intense adrenaline rush for the evil it invokes. It's in this vein that the ghoulish face paint, pyrotechnics, fire breathing and blood spitting makes a fitting comeback as a new appropriation in the band's theatrics, owed no doubt to Kiss.

The live shows are certainly the meat of this release, with the accompanying audio CD of the Warsaw show a nice touch as it is indeed a show you'll enjoy listening to in the car again and again. The ""documentaries,"" however, are more like semi-intelligible video *documentations* of the band on the road without any real narrative chronicling their history. That being said, both documentaries are amusing supplementary material. We get an informal sense of the uphill battle the band faces in its home country, the forces working against them, and the rabid fan base that keeps them diligent. We see how slaphappy tired Behemoth can get touring, particularly the imp that is Seth. Party animals they may be, however, the professionalism and dedication that endures within Nergal, Seth, Orion and Inferno is most telling about what makes this Behemoth line-up superior to any before it.

But it remains Nergal alone who provides the instinctive direction and continued success of Behemoth, and his charisma makes him very watchable in everything on here. He is a fearsome prophet of uncompromising self-certainty, a dark son whose passions and visions paint what can only be an existentialist's portrait of life, beckoning the left-hand path and endorsing nothing less than life lived with the power and freedom of a demigod. I can't think of another figure in metal who is as smart, talented, purpose-driven, and positive an influence as Nergal. He makes life, music, and most particular, Poland, his own in an exceedingly heroic, original way. While evangelizing blasphemy of a Christian apostasy, he's proof that heroes can sometimes masquerade as villains.

The only thing that has interrupted Behemoth's diabolical reign, at least temporarily let's hope, has been the threat of death itself. It's to be commended that ""Evangelia Heretika"" was released under difficult circumstances, with Nergal being diagnosed with leukemia earlier this year. It goes without saying that the timeliness of this miserable diagnosis alongside Behemoth's latest success makes Nergal's story sound ever more like a Faustian one. Never to diminish the band's earthly toils however, it simply seems that both ""Evangelion"" and ""Evangelia Heretika"" are so good they could only be the result of colluding with the devil.

And on that note let's all hope, for the sake of Behemoth, that the devil's work still isn't complete. Pick this one up, you'll love it.",1293753600,11,4447,5.336661911554922
4260289,5,B00447G2XE,"This is a great buy for any Behemoth fan, it's got every music video ever made of them, 2 live shows that are about an hour and a half long each, and a documentary of them that's really awesome as well. Also it comes with a CD of the show Live at Warsaw that's the first show on the DVD, all together it's really cool to watch and I like the fact it's pretty cheap.

4260291,5,B00447G2XE,"The 2 concerts featured on the dvd 1 sound extremely good , songs like ""as above so below"" ""antichristian phenomenon"" or ""lucifer"" sound diferent and much better (in my opinion )than in the albums. The first concert in paris took place before Envagelion so  it has  old songs and the setlist is a little bit different ,the warsaw concert introduces some Envagelion songs. My favorite part is ""lucifer"" played as encore, sounds fantastic and the way they play its ""weird"" in some way, they don't headband in all the 9 minutes that last the song (you have to see it to believe it). The second DVD contains 2 documentaries about the band (one hour each), all the videos made by the band so far and in a very good quality, you won't have to see that crappy quality ""conquer all"" video posted by the band on youtube.
Finally the last disc is an audio cd containing all the 18 songs of the warsaw gig in a outstanding quality.",1290643200,15,920,4.470238095238095

8415968,5,B00447G2XE,"If you are a fan of Behemoth that loves to immerse yourself in a band beyond just listening to their music, Evangelia Heretika is for you.  I love sitting down and watching the live performance, it comes with two separate live shows that are both very good.  The two documentaries that come with the set were very pleasant to watch.  I honestly didn't know what to expect when it came to the band's personalities and how they acted.  But the documentaries really gave some perspective on the guys behind the band, and what it's like for them to be on tour.

The CD that has all the songs from one of the live performances is an awesome bonus too.  Some of the songs (in my opinion) are better played live than on the album.  Wolves Guard My Coffin as an example.  If you like Behemoth, and want to know some backstory to the band, then don't hesitate to buy the DVDs.  So much entertainment is packed into this set for such a low price.",1370476800,,936,4.333333333333333

It includes tracks from their latest record Evangelion, and the live performances are just extreme brutality and aggression (and the production, sound and audiovisuals are very well done just like their videos).

Where do I even start with this two DVD and CD set? This is LITERALLY massive! This has everything a die-hard fan, or someone new to Behemoth NEEDS in their life! So let us dig in:

DVD I:

This DVD contains the tour footage. Not much more to elucidate on contents. However, this is some of the FINEST tour footage ever shot! You really feel like you are walking around the stage with them, or chanting with them during the songs! Having seen Behemoth in person, this was an awesome tribute to such an amazing moment in my life. To see the raw energy they shove into every show (again and again and again), makes me hunger for more and wait impatiently to see them again. There is truly something special about these gentlemen and their music. Makes being a Thelemite myself, very, very proud.

DVD II:

Here we have EVERYTHING you could possibly think of to add to a DVD collection of this magnitude. Most bands (even movies) just tack on a couple of videos and some ten minute, half-assed and lame ""Yeah, we know we're so much more hard than,"" crap. Behemoth doesn't NEED to say, ""Dude, we're bad ass"" for they are and prove more than that by these documentaries and the effort, time, blood, sweat and tears they feed to the entity known collectively as ""Behemoth."" Sure, each member has their other bands that they belong to (Orion - ""Vesania"" & ""Black River"" Seth - ""Nomad"" Inferno - ""Azarath""), but together, they make a sonic synergy that coalesces ""awe,"" ""might,"" and ""raw power!"" So much more could be said, but let us digress onto the product at hand.

All the videos, in super-polished glory! Having to suffer through horrible quality videos on several different sites, this is a godsend! Even has (sadly short) behind the scenes of the creating of the newer videos. Fans will recognize these from Behemoth's posting them on their YouTube account. My only complaint, is that I wish they would have put the creating of ""Evangelion"" on here as well. Those videos were so perfect in showing that aforementioned passion! Seeing as the DVD's are so packed already, perhaps no space was left?

""Evangelia Nova"" (so pretty it could be the name of a future child!) contains interview footage of the band in the current format (""Evangelion""). It shows what they went through for their touring of this cycle and the creating of the Warsaw concert. It is very, very thorough and perhaps you will see some things you never wanted to ever, ever see.

""De Arte Heretika"" contains footage of Behemoth from the area of ""The Apostasy."" For some fans this may be a disappointment, as this package appears to be all about ""Evangelion."" What needs to be focused on, is that this is not about JUST ""Evangelion!"" This is about how Behemoth has suffered to put their message out there, each and every tour, each and every concert! Both of these videos are quite long and meaty (clocking in at an hour for both). These are on par with the DVD released with ""Evangelion"" (again, wishing the YouTube videos would have made it here as well).

What sets Behemoth apart from most bands, is that they are not afraid to laugh at themselves. They are not sitting infront of the mirror trying to ego-inflate and grunt or growl to look ""hard."" Sure, Nergal will say, ""We are here to conquer all of you"" but this has to do with the message and the stage showmanship. Besides, I don't want some band to just waffle around the stage, I WANT them to conquer! There is a scene where Orion says to the camera, ""People handle being nervous differently. Some smoke and others have to pee every five minutes!"" then you see Nergal from behind, in the corner holding up a water bottle half-full with urine, decked out in corpse-paint and armor, saying ""Don't drink this..."" I was howling for about a good fifteen minutes! Then there is some shower antics and some digging in the garbage for good nutritional nourishment!

Also, there is a scene where Behemoth encounters some Christians, doing what Christians do: boycotting good music and screaming at the fans that they ""are going to burn in hell"" for listening to Behemoth. Quaint.

You will laugh, you will piss yourself, you will chant and scream. These DVD's are where it is at for ANY and ALL things Behemoth!

CD:

Nothing really eloquent to say here. This is the Warsaw concert on celluloid for all your listening pleasure. My only complaint is that Nergal was really giving it his all and his voice was so hoarse after only a few songs. I'm not one for live anything (you just have to be there, or else, why bother?), but this is fantastic! Shredded vocal chords or no, this is superb on all scales!

If you were to buy this package for cheap, you would feel that you SERIOUSLY ripped the band off! They give you that much in this product. Most of these video deals that bands put out are so horrible. Not even worth being filmed, let alone mass-marketed. Behemoth took their time with this and really put together something solid and earth-shattering. I am going to watch this over and over again, simply because of all the hard work they put into creating this. You can tell they are really concerned about their band and want only the best put out with their name on it.

The love and care put into this is yet another reason why I love Behemoth and listen to them ritualistically daily.

To put it bluntly, when you buy this set, you are buying quality and perfection. Most importantly, you are buying something truly ""Behemoth!""

Love is the law, love under Will!",1310428800,6,5543,4.588473205257836
8415975,4,B00447G2XE,"First I'd like to take the time to comment on the amazing box-art that Behemoth have created for this DVD-set. It might not matter to some, but this thick package is a feast for the eyes; both artful and yet subtle at the same time, with an easy-to-read song list (which is rare in the metal community), your three discs and a little book with photos.

The first show is shot in Warsaw, and runs for 81 minutes. This is a more traditional, grand, Behemoth-only show, and the band plays in such tune that you could almost mistake them for using playback, which they aren't. Plenty of power and plenty of flash (""Chant For Ezkaton 2000 E.V."" being one example), but there are a few nitpicks about it. Nergal speaks Polish to the audience, and there are no subtitles. There are a bunch of overlain video effects making the show look more surreal and odd, and the camera that follows Nergal doesn't get up very close. All the song titles are shown in frame at the start of the songs, and they take up about 40% of the bottom screen (which I find pointless when there's such a great songlist on the box itself). Those are small things, a little distracting but not too bad, but there is one more thing worth noting; the 5.1-track seems to have some very poor seperation. I double-checked both my DVD-remote and my reciever settings, and it was indeed the surround-track, but it didn't sound ""like you were there"". It won't scare any Jehova's Witnesses away, but it might annoy them if you turn up the volume. If you prefer, there's a 2.0-track that might actually sound more ""in your face"" though. The audio is not ""bad"" by any stretch at all, just not as powerful and immersive as it might have been.

The second show is in a smaller venue in Paris, and it's almost more intense, the cameras are up closer and the songs are plenty awesome (even if you don't know Turbonegro, there's a cover that's sure to make you laugh in here). No video effects, but there's still those same song titles showing, and the audio has the exact same problem; it's very good, but far from great, and the back speakers are pretty much quiet, instead of hearing the crowd or reflecting back some of the instruments. You also get a 2.0-track here though, and switching over to that for only a second, it was a lot more intense and powerful, even if it doesn't make use of your whole system the same way. No matter what you choose though, you'll hear Nergal speak English on this one.

You also get two documentaries (mainly in Polish) with optional English subtitles. They're both pretty decent, and the band covers a lot of ground, discussing their touring history, their albums, some of the controversies and troubles they've gone through thematically and personally. Other than that, there's all the videos up to this point (""Conquer All"" and ""Slaves Shall Serve"" being my favourites both song-wise and quality-wise) and some short making of the video-featurettes. Overall this package is very good, and I doubt it will disappoint any Behemoth-fan, casual or hardcore, but with a few tweaks and some stronger audio it would've been completely fantastic. Recommended.",1304467200,2,3143,4.669675090252707
8415976,5,B00447G2XE,Great sound. The only problem is with the video. Whoever edited this must be on speed! It jumps around from frame to frame every 2 seconds. Not enough time to just look at the band and admire their art!,1302566400,,202,4.205128205128205
