2326795,5,B0009WFFQ8,"Who knew you could work up such a sweat in only ten minutes?

The way the workouts are grouped into 10 min segments is very convenient.  And each is a challenge for a beginner like me, but the moves are not hard to follow.

I really enjoy them and would recommend it.

I also have the Dance it off DVD and like that one too.",1150329600,7,324,3.9384615384615387
2326796,5,B0009WFFQ8,"Toning Experts Were Right - This Is Excellent

The paper I read (Argus Leader)  ran an article  where they had fitness experts review DVDs in various categories and whether they were ""Worth The Workout"".  This DVD was highly rated across all categories

-Works everything out,

-it was not boring

- a beginner could do it but experts would not get bored

-the instructor was upbeat and encouraging

- the experts themselves  would definitely use the DVD again

Anyway I picked up all four DVDs (there were recommendations  in the general category of Cardio, Toning, Pilates and Yoga) and so far am extremely  happy with all of the titles they recommended. (In fact I have some of the titles that they stated were very poor titles, and they were right there  also.)

So if you are looking for an excellent  Toning DVD, look no further, the experts were right on the money in their review.",1146441600,10,888,4.6688311688311686
2326797,4,B0009WFFQ8,Very good; time effective.  You can work all of the areas or just one.  Targets specific problem areas.,1142380800,5,103,4.666666666666667
2326798,5,B0009WFFQ8,"I really like this video. Some work out videos that I've tried are confusing. This one is very easy to learn the first time doing it. You can do one workout a day, two or all three.",1139788800,8,181,3.918918918918919
2326799,3,B0009WFFQ8,"I was disappointed overall by the workout.  The cover itself is misleading as you spend very little time on the mat.  Having bad knees, I was looking for more of a mat workout than squats and lunges.  Just a warning for those out there with bad knees like myself!",1138060800,43,263,4.326530612244898
2326800,4,B0009WFFQ8,"I really like this dvd.  I actually like all the Prevention series that I've seen so far.  In this workout they use proven exercises for maximum effectiveness.  Chris Freytag is the instructor again and she cues well and is very down to earth making the whole programme enjoyable and not overly intimidating if you are new to working out.  She will definately keep you motivated.  There is your usuall pilates type moves, crunches, squats and lunges to name a few, but these same exercises are around because they are definately effective.  Trust me, you will feel good after this.  Anyone will get a good workout from this.",1133827200,23,624,4.775700934579439
2326801,5,B0009WFFQ8,"This is a nice short, challenging, and effective workout. I liked the variety of exercises and that there was a good blend of cardio and floorwork. I found the thigh toning section using handweights to be particularly challenging. A good intermediate level toner for the lower body. The instructor was very good, although she was a bit off of the beat on the music from time to time.",1130889600,31,383,4.647058823529412

2326807,5,B0009WFFQ8,"I used to have this DVD but lost it during a move.  Looked everywhere for it and finally found it here on amazon.  This workout is very helpful to me.  You can either do it in 10 min intervals, but I normally do everything all at once.  I do enjoy the flexibility of the DVD.",1367280000,,275,3.9454545454545453
2326808,3,B0009WFFQ8,I would recommend this video for someone who is just starting out or wants to maintain their weight. May be a little difficult if you have knee problems as there are a lot of bending exercises.,1358380800,,193,4.388888888888889
2326809,4,B0009WFFQ8,Excellent workout for beginners and intermediate. Being able to target a specific area one day at a time was great.,1344556800,,115,4.8
2326810,5,B0009WFFQ8,"I started using this DVD about 4 years ago after I had my first child. I recently lost it, so I purchased another one. I love this DVD - it gives you 10 minutes for belly, 10 minutes for butt, and 10 minutes for thighs. It's great for when you only have a little bit of time. You can just do 10 minutes if that's all you have.",1320883200,2,326,3.8088235294117645
2326811,5,B0009WFFQ8,"Just one more reason to love Chris, Prevention, & AMAZON.  I bought several of Preventions Fitness videos, but it was the first one with Chris in it that sold me.  She's no nonsense, she knows her stuff, and I don't get tired of hearing her say the same thing many times thru the week.  Prevention Fitness, Belly, Butt & Thighs is again created with a working woman's schedule in mind.  When I have only a few minutes I do one segment, but I love it so much I try to make sure I get enough time to do it all.",1300147200,,508,4.05
2326812,5,B0009WFFQ8,"I recommend this video to everyone who is looking to lose weight or just tone their body! Chris Freytag is amazing, motivational, and down-to-earth. She keeps you at a good pace. The workouts are awesome and effective!",1299628800,,218,4.918918918918919
2326813,5,B0009WFFQ8,"This was the first DVD I purchased from Prevention, and it will always be my favorite. It'll always have a special place because it was the first DVD I got to start my workout regime, 5 years ago. The DVD is composed of three workout plans, one for each the belly, the butt and the thighs. It has a little stress reliever special, too. Each workout is around ten minutes long, but really get you going. You learn the moves and I've taken them into my routines whenever I work out, whether it's at the gym or at home. Prevention has great DVDs.",1268265600,3,543,4.281553398058253
2326814,5,B0009WFFQ8,"This is a good and efficient workout with specific body parts.  I used it once.  The next day, specific body parts of mine are aching good.  I will use this again, 10 mins per area.",1257033600,,181,4.114285714285714
2326815,5,B0009WFFQ8,"I can get a nice workout from this dvd and have a good burn the next day.  Very easy to follow the main and modified workouts.  I wish it had an arm segment to complete it, though.  I tend not to grab it as much as other exercise dvds that include arms.",1231977600,,253,3.826923076923077
2326816,3,B0009WFFQ8,"This workout is quick (3 x 10 minute series for abs, butt and thighs.) It's great for times when you want to do SOMETHING but not get exhausted. I did it in the morning when I was still a bit sleepy, and it worked to get me warmed up and sweating a bit.

Chris's cues are usually clear although I did mess up a few times when first watching it, but I'm a bit clumsy. Her stretching is very fast, and I paused the DVD to keep holding positions in order to actually feel the full stretch, but other than that the workout was fine. If you are quite fit then this DVD will probably bore you and barely break a sweat. I work out regularly but neglect my lower body as far as lunges, squats, etc. so I wanted something to ease me back into such exercises. If you have knee problems you won't like the squat or lunge series.

Basically, I consider this fine for days when I want a warm-up or I'm too tired to actually go a full hour and a half at the gym. It wasn't annoying to watch (no chattering and whooping like in some DVDs) and is efficient.",1228435200,9,1041,4.073170731707317

2326819,5,B0009WFFQ8,"This is my favorite work-out video and the only one that even after 2-3 times, I can tell a difference. It's only 30 minutes if you do all three and it's very focused. Love it!",1194393600,2,176,4.057142857142857
2326820,4,B0009WFFQ8,"I like this and the other Prevention Fitness dvd.  Very positive.  Easy to follow. I like the 10 minute intervals.

2326821,5,B0009WFFQ8,"I've really enjoyed this dvd so far. It's the best thing to do after a run as a good strength-training workout. My favorite part is the belly section, but I like to do all 3 together--the 30 minutes really flies by.

As other reviews have pointed out, there are a lot of squats and lunges in the butt and thighs sections, so if you have bad knees, this video might not work for you. I don't have bad knees, but I hate doing squats and lunges on my own. However, Chris Freytag is really motivating and not annoying as an instructor, so I've managed to make it through every time, and had fun doing it.

I highly recommend this dvd to work on toning up problem areas.",1190937600,,665,4.228346456692913
2326822,5,B0009WFFQ8,"Really like the Prevention offerings and like Chris Freytag as an instructor. Have most of the Prevention series and this is one of my favorites.  Well organized, easy to follow. Good workout.",1181606400,,192,5.0
2326823,3,B0009WFFQ8,"There's really nothing special about this DVD, just short toning workouts like many others with very little uniqueness.

The abs workout was ok, a mix of pilates and traditional work.  It was the only one I might do again.

The buns workout was almost all squats.

The legs workout was almost all lunges.  I couldn't do any of it because it hurt my knees.

The toning is done at a fast pace to keep your heartrate up.  Very little is actually done on the mat.  It's not a terrible workout, but there really isn't much special about it, and millions of other workouts contain lots of squats and lunges.  I'm looking for something different.",1180137600,5,639,4.535087719298246
2326824,5,B0009WFFQ8,I have trouble sticking to workouts that are too time consuming. This is broken down into three 10 minute segments and I do 2 a day. The exercises are simple but I still feel like its a good workout because I am panting when it is over and I am sore the next day. I have been doing it for 2 weeks and I really think I am going to stick with this one for a while! Who can't fit in a 2o - 30 minute workout everyday?,1171238400,4,414,3.715909090909091
2326825,5,B0009WFFQ8,"After I finish the 10-minute segment, I can't believe it's already done!  I am never thinking ""When will this end?""  As a result, I am happy to get to the next 10-minute segment; that goes by just as quickly.  Pretty soon I've exercised for 30 MINUTES BUT IT FEELS LIKE TEN!  It's great.  I agree with the other viewer--it's hard to believe, but you will work up a sweat.  Now I'm looking to see if they have a DVD for upper body workout.",1170374400,7,438,4.216867469879518

2326827,2,B0009WFFQ8,"I own a ton of workout dvd's and thought I might try this one due to the ten minute interval toning sections. I like to use these as add-ons to my cardio vids.  However, I tried the entire video twice and could not get over the instructor... her chatter was really annoying and I felt like she was teaching a kindergarten class.  I am not easily annoyed, and was surprised by my dislike of this dvd... I am definitely selling this one on ebay!",1162944000,6,443,4.261904761904762
2326828,5,B0009WFFQ8,I love this workout CD.  It is simple & I get a really good workout from it.  I like that they have three 10 minute segments & you can do them all or one.  The butt segment is my favorite section.,1162512000,,196,3.731707317073171
2326829,4,B0009WFFQ8,"I love the belly section of this workout.  I must say it is a great add-on to a workout that does not cover much in the ""ab"" area.  The one downfall is the music and moves in the butt workout - the moves aren't always with the beat of the music and I often find myself fighting to keep with the instructor.  I would definitely recommend this DVD for anyone looking to work their abs.",1152489600,4,383,4.08
