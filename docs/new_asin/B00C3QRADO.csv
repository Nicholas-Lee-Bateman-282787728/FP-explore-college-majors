8577187,2,B00C3QRADO,"I agree with other reviewers that the band that came with set is hard to use and while I did enjoy the Strength moves,the cardio was so boring-some awkward or silly moves that she has you repeat over and over and over-was getting so frustrated and while the choreography was awkward,I didn't feel sweaty or challenged,just aggravated. Will probably keep this just for the Strength workouts",1507420800,,389,4.909090909090909
8577188,1,B00C3QRADO,Fitness fusion refused to acknowlege my numerous attempts to reach them regarding defective product sold as brand new.  Don't buy from them.  They rip you off.,1501977600,2,159,5.076923076923077
8577189,5,B00C3QRADO,"If you're looking for a challenge - this is it! You have to work up to it, but what a great work out. The moves are different but do-able, low impact for the most part. I usually turn the sound off and stream music which works well for me. I really like this - I bought the whole system and all of the DVDs have a great workout.",1494115200,,328,3.838235294117647
8577190,3,B00C3QRADO,"I've tried to do this program a few times, each time I've pulled something in my shoulder by the end of week two. Some awkward moves using weights and there's definitely a dread factor. Very intense, and likely very effective if you're able to get the moves down and stay safe.",1441756800,7,277,4.450980392156863
8577191,5,B00C3QRADO,"Challenging workouts! I follow the program as Michelle Dozois directs, each day a specific workout and an excellent eating plan. I have lost 2 lbs already! I am not getting bored and look forward to working out each day!",1441670400,3,220,4.666666666666667
8577192,1,B00C3QRADO,Was not what I expected.  It's a little to challenging and boring for me.  It's a good program for advanced exercisers.,1437955200,3,119,4.619047619047619
8577193,3,B00C3QRADO,"I got this system some time ago and I did enjoy it except for the DVDs that used the band.  The band was really hard to stretch and I was not able to get a replacement band since it came with the system and it was not sold separately.  I did try other bands that looked similar, but they were not effective.  Other than the defective exercise band, the exercises are challenging and fun.",1429660800,4,387,4.202702702702703
8577194,4,B00C3QRADO,"I do a lot of workout videos and this one has some very challenging classes in the series.  Some have a little choreography you have to get used to but the ones with the weights are very good.  I'm not as fond of the ones with the band b/c they move too quickly thru the exercises. The cardio dvd's are good, long and challenging. I'd recommend this.",1428019200,6,350,4.208955223880597
8577195,5,B00C3QRADO,"I bought this set in 2011 when it first came out, and had great results with it!

Overall, I only lost 0.5 pounds, but I lost about four inches total (including in my chest and my hips ) and gained a bit in my arms. Since I didn't want to lose any weight (I already wear a size 0 or 2), I'm thrilled with my results since my bat wings and saddlebags were largely gone! My husband said that I looked the best that I'd ever looked, which was great because I did this right before I turned 40.

The workouts are tough, but I absolutely adore Michelle and she makes all the workouts fun! I usually get exercise ADD if I stick with one instructor for too long, but Michelle is so sweet and encouraging that I looked forward to every workout and had zero dread factor.

The cardio workouts combine bodyweight moves (push-ups, planks, burpees), kickboxing, and hi/lo aerobics, and there is enough variety in the series that I never got bored. She also includes a lot of functional moves, and many of the exercises draw on your core strength and balance. I pushed myself HARD every time I worked out, and Michelle knows just when and where to encourage you in a workout when you're feeling pooped out.

I followed the rotation just as designed, but did take one week off just over half-way through, when I had to travel for work. (The only workouts I did that week were a few hikes.)

My right knee and shoulder have a tendency towards tendinitis, but my knee pain only flared up occasionally while doing these. The last few days (as I neared the end of the eighth week), my body definitely felt like it needed a rest since my legs felt sore and heavy.

I also didn't follow the included meal plan, but wish that I had. I was logging calories and was eating my usual 2,000 a day, which I think was too many for me. When I did my four-week measurements, I contacted Michelle since I had put on a pound at that point, and she suggested cutting back on my calories since I was probably putting on muscle. For the last few weeks, I did try to cut back, but I didn't cut back as much as I should have. (I was on summer break from teaching, and I tend to nibble all day long when I'm at home!)

I've done Cathe Friedrich's STS, Insanity, kettlebells, P57, Jari, Brazil Butt Lift, etc. in the past, but this series has given me the best overall results I've ever gotten. (BBL is the other series that made a huge difference in my lower half!) I think it was the combo of cardio in almost every workout that helped me shed some fat. I'm an hourglass shape, and tend to carry my weight in my hips, thighs, and rear end.

At the start and end of the program, Michelle has you do a Fit Test, similar to the one you do in Insanity (for those folks familiar with that program). My overall fitness level and cardiovascular abilities really went up.

Overall, this is a great series, and I'm so glad that I did it! This summer Michelle is also starting a Facebook check-in group with these workouts, so I think that I'll pull out my set and use them again.  You definitely can't go wrong with these workouts!",1368662400,16,3085,4.303448275862069
