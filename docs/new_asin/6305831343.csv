7896892,5,6305831343,"Lot of good talent there. It reminds me that it must have been exciting to be alive in that era. Bessie Smith, a young Louis Armstrong and more!  Great FUN!!",1378512000,,157,4.233333333333333
7896893,4,6305831343,"As noted by others this is an unpolished presentation.  At times the sound is marginal.  Most of the video material has some sort of defect -- noise, poor contrast, etc.  However, the material presented is amazing. In cut number 4, James Barton's solo dance number, the several pieces by the young Louis Armstrong, the step dance by Bill Robinson (cut 7) and Bessie Smith singing the Saint Louis Blues were some of the most enjoyable for me.  If you like this musical period you will enjoy this DVD.",1365206400,,499,4.636363636363637
7896894,4,6305831343,"In the Whiteman clip, it still is possible that Bix wasn't faking it.  He was a self-taught trumpet player, and all of his fingerings are completely different from anyone else's.  As for the different cut off, I'm not sure.  But I don't think anyone should discredit the Bix clip entirely.  He had his own style of playing.",1130630400,3,323,4.614035087719298
7896895,3,6305831343,"A nice selection of rare material is undercut by the presentation here. Many films have been poorly framed so that people's heads are cropped - God, it's annoying, did no one look at this before it was released? Audio is generally as good as source material permits. As for the Bix clip - yep, there he (barely) is, in the brass section, FAKING his way through ""My Ohio Home"" (watch his fingering, it doesn't match the arrangement, and he stops playing before the rest of the section). So this is not the ""only sound film document"" of Bix playing - he ain't playing. There is no tray insert with any background info or even a track list, and nothing onscreen to indicate what you're watching, so you'll need to have the box handy. Nobody went out of their way to upgrade this for DVD, that's for sure. If you have the VHS, you don't need this. Four stars for material, docked one star for presentation.",1078358400,21,902,4.472727272727273
7896896,4,6305831343,"This is an excellent compilation of rare material, and it a must have for the great Boswell Sisters material, the shot of Bix in Whiteman's trumpet section (not soloing as the box says), the ""dance contest"" with Chick Webb's 1929 band (which released only 1 78), closeups of Duke's 1929 band-Wellman Braud, Sonny Greer, young Harry Carney and Johnny Hodges (soloing on soprano), Freddy Jenkins, Artie Whetsol, Cootie Williams...
Collectors should be warned that the version of St. Louis Blues with Bessie Smith is an edited, truncated version. So is the 1929 Duke Ellington material featuring Fredi Washington, great as all this stuff is. So for more, seek out the whole items, available on other collections.",1053388800,10,709,5.120689655172414
7896897,5,6305831343,"What would you rather watch to get a taste of German cabaret in the early '30s, Cabaret (1972) or The Blue Angel (1931)? If you answer the latter you may especially enjoy this interesting compilation that is less polished than many others, especially the big studio productions of later years.

I am especially charmed by two productions that might be at the bottom of others' lists--the dance hall performances by Tessie Maize and Ruby Darby. By modern standards, many of the dancers were too heavy and too unpolished to even point a camera at, but they let us see what an ordinary audience of their times could see, not only the numbers, but the unaffected intimacy of the piece, and their cheer and enengy.

This DVD is like discovering a treasure in a collector's attic. A must have.",1024444800,15,787,4.695652173913044
