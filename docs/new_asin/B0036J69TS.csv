8390014,4,B0036J69TS,"Do not purchase this if you already own Man vs. Wild Season 2.  This exact episode is already on that season/series.  Other than that, this is a great documentary for anyone who loves to watch Bear Grylls and his amazing adventures.  We also meet his wife, and see glimpses of his family, we hear her thoughts on his latest adventure, and watch as he goes through the grueling preparations needed for a task of this magnitude.  Beautiful scenery, and a wonderful adventure!",1340064000,,473,4.7317073170731705
