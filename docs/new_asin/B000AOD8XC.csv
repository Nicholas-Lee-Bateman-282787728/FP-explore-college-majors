2390160,5,B000AOD8XC,"We watched this and Glaciers in succession and we sat there for two hours, not believing the feast that was dished up in front of our eyes on the BIG screen.  The clarity and the welcome lack of comments by park rangers and conservationists, just plain enjoyment and perfection...",1338854400,4,280,4.714285714285714
2390161,5,B000AOD8XC,My brother was so excited to get this dvd.  He loves the british columbia area but cannot physically get there.  Thanks for sending it so quickly.,1328227200,,146,4.576923076923077
2390162,5,B000AOD8XC,"I was in Vancouver in 2006 and, since then, I kept good memories from there. So, whole British Columbia is really beautiful. I was in Vancouver (city of last Winter Olimpic Games), Whistler and Victoria. Really beautiful places to live and explore.

On Blu Ray you can find different places to know and amazing sightseens. And I, good places to remember and, obviously, set as my next trip objectives on Canada. Good movie to explore part of Canada without going out from your home.",1313798400,,482,4.738095238095238
2390163,3,B000AOD8XC,"Over Beautiful British Columbia is a spectacular aerial tour of one of Canada 's most beautiful regions. With this Special Collector's Edition DVD, shot entirely in widescreen High Definition Television (HDTV), you'll join a thrilling helicopter adventure that explores British Columbia like never before. Fly high above panoramic vistas and soar over mountaintops, dive into valleys and glide above Vancouver's skyline and the sun-drenched Okanagan. It's an aerial adventure you'll never forget",1298678400,,495,5.888888888888889
2390164,1,B000AOD8XC,"After purchasing several videos on a recent trip to USA and enjoying them at our home,  I was eagerly awaiting these products --- but they won't play here in OZ.  Can it be that you market internationally some products designed only to work on the USA DVD system - not international?  I thought that problem was only for video tapes?",1285718400,,333,4.516666666666667
2390165,5,B000AOD8XC,"Excellent production.  If you can't make it to BC, this is the next best thing.
I highly recommend this video.",1271808000,7,110,4.5
2390166,3,B000AOD8XC,"This 1996 production is not up to current high-definition video standard, and the audio soundtrack is 2 channel stereo.  It's a disappointment as a Blu-Ray disc.",1253232000,,161,5.1923076923076925
2390167,4,B000AOD8XC,"I too own the Dvd and my opinion is the blu ray version is slightly better, it won't blow you away as i was expecting, shame as its an awesome docco on an awesome part of the world.",1252800000,6,181,3.789473684210526
2390168,5,B000AOD8XC,"This production, which was originally shown on PBS stations, effectively portrays the beauty and grandeur of British Columbia.

I have previously purchased VHS and DVD versions of this production.

However, the program was created in HD and is significantly enhanced when viewed in HD.

For anyone who appreciates beautiful scenery, the videography of this production is as good as it gets.

The music and narration are also excellent.",1251676800,11,435,5.352941176470588
2390169,5,B000AOD8XC,"The picture quality is very good. It makes you want to travel to British Columbia to experience its beauty first hand.

This film is on my list of Best Geography Movies of All Times. Other wonderful DVD's about Canada are: Over Canada, Canada by Rail, Greatest Canadian Invention.",1181952000,,280,4.833333333333333

2390177,4,B000AOD8XC,"The good - video is simply beautiful. This is a photogenic province. The bad - the narrative. I think the scriptwriter had just received Roget's Thesaurus, and was trying to use every word in that book. The result is a series of metaphors that make me gag, because they verge on the semi-literate as they just don't fit. You can turn the sound down, but there is some background music that does fit the video, so it is a shame to lose that. Get a new narration and this could easily be a 5-star disc.",1408838400,,500,4.273684210526316

2390179,5,B000AOD8XC,"Excellent program, good production values, good transfer to DVD. Shot with first generation HD gear so (not as sharp as today's technology) but still worth owning.",1407628800,,163,5.3076923076923075
2390180,2,B000AOD8XC,"I bought this disc to replace one I left someone borrow and never got back.  I should have read the description more carefully, because this version is NOT Blu-ray.  It's grainy and not worth your money.",1406246400,,203,4.611111111111111
2390181,4,B000AOD8XC,"We love BC, so were very happy to see it from the air. Of course, one can't be very profound or insightful in this kind of thing, but there's a good variety of places and shots.

The downside is the narration. It is so pretentious and pompous that it is  laughable. Unfortunately, it dies spoil the mood set by the photography. Fortunately, the narrator only 'introduces' each new region, then shuts up. Judicious use of the mute button makes it bearable.",1392163200,,455,4.604938271604938
2390182,5,B000AOD8XC,"I'm originally from Washington state and made many trips over the years to BC, and this dvd captures the beauty of it.  Made me homesick.  The music is so nice as an accompaniment for the scenery.  Love it!",1391990400,,206,4.368421052631579
2390183,5,B000AOD8XC,"excellent DVD , well filmed, good commentary, made you want to be there. Prefect for purpose of a Christmas present for someone who had the video version",1389744000,,153,4.703703703703703
2390184,5,B000AOD8XC,"They give a good overview of the geography and the commentary is remarkably good, bordering on the poetic.  I'm wondering how often I'll replay these shows however its almost as good as being there.",1388620800,,198,4.823529411764706
2390185,5,B000AOD8XC,"Beautiful cinematography and very informative. This is entertaining and educational. Also suitable for social studies class, or  homeschooling. Great photography shows variety of this area.",1386201600,,189,6.56
2390186,5,B000AOD8XC,"We have this on our DVR, but wanted to get a personal copy so that we would not lose it if we had to get another DVR player.

We love the music and the narration.  It was put togeather so well and is just wonderful.  It may not be some people's cup of tea, but it suits us.  It is so peaceful and calming and informative.  We watch it again and again.  We often watch part of it at night before we go to sleep.  It is just so absolutely beautiful!!!

We highly recommend this DVD, and Amazon got it to us quickly as well. All-in-all a great experience.

Thank you!",1376352000,,564,4.009009009009009
2390187,5,B000AOD8XC,This is very beautiful.  The narration is quite effective.  The aerial footage is quite exceptional and will be a joy for many more times to come.,1374364800,,146,4.576923076923077
2390188,2,B000AOD8XC,"The voice of the narrator is just horrible and sounds rather unprofessional.

2390190,5,B000AOD8XC,"Saw this originally on PBS when it first aired in 1996 and thought the picture and sound quality were impressive. The DVD blows this away even on my old 27 inch TV. Have the VHS also, could not find it on DVD at the time. Definitely worth buying the DVD.",1365206400,,254,4.1
2390191,5,B000AOD8XC,"I've enjoyed other videos in this series. I haven't actually seen this one, but I sent it to my Dad (who lived in BC for a couple of years and loves the place) for Christmas and he loved it. My brother was with him and said he watched this over and over.",1361145600,,254,3.9038461538461537
2390192,1,B000AOD8XC,THE PHOTOGRAPHY WAS BEAUTIFUL BUT THE SOUND ON THE DISK WE RECEIVED WAS SKIPPING.  SO WAS BOTHERSOME TO HEAR AND LISTEN AND WATCH,1360108800,,129,4.608695652173913
2390193,5,B000AOD8XC,"This is another gorgeous video from the ""Over"" series.  Excellent photography, adequate narration, lovely music that sticks in your mind after the video is over.  Parts of this video were in ""Over Canada"", which sadly seems to be out of print.  This video expands on the parts in ""Over Canada"" and shows you more of this lovely area.",1354060800,,333,4.706896551724138
2390194,4,B000AOD8XC,"The scenery and camera work on this film are great! Lots of key points of interest and beautiful scenery. Well shot. The film breaks down a specific area of British Columbia and does about 5 minutes or so on each area, showcasing mostly touristy things while mixing in some beautiful rugged mountains and rivers and other wildlife. The visuals are great. The only issue I had with it was the narration. The narrator really irritated me with his cliches and vague attempt at creating his own 'visuals' with his words. I don't need visuals with words. I'm WATCHING it. The guy also seemed like he was whispering the whole time, another irritation. Why is he whispering? The music went with the images for the most part. The video is about 40 minutes. I would say for some beautiful, inexpensive scenery, this Blu-Ray of British Columbia is great! Worth around $9. Minus one star for the irritating whispering narrator. Other than that guy, would be nice to have on with some of your own music.",1352160000,5,991,4.7011494252873565
2390195,5,B000AOD8XC,"Every since I first saw this video on the former HDTheater channel I knew I would have to have this on blu-ray to get the full 1080P. A magnificent showcase of British Columbia and its incredible mountains and beautiful music and a narrator, who is almost whispering in awe himself, this presentation took my breath away. Finally I was able to order it and was very excited upon receiving it in just a couple of days of ordering, placed it into my Vizio player and when at last it got started...oh no. The sound which is essential to the production goes in and out like a bad radio station throughout. Not good! So, I thought, maybe the lens on my player needs cleaning so I inserted my cleaning disc and afterwards still no change. Next, I complained to Amazon, who does not sell it, but an outside company. The outside company, which calls themselves a small family business, was quick to respond. I got the replacement this morning, and looking forward to at last watching a decent copy...same thing. Sound was cutting in and out in practically the same places. Even more disappointment gave me the impetus to write this review. While the video portion is all that I expected in showing that glorious scenery the audio, well, just sucks. I am not knocking the distributor, as they are very serious about customer satisfaction. It is the company that makes these ""Over"" videos (TOPICS entertainment) who is ultimately responsible. As of the writing of this review I am wondering if anyone else has run into this problem. I was planning on purchasing other ""Over"" videos but I won't set myself up for any more disappointments at this times

Update to this review. I loaned my copy to one of my friends who said the video played flawlessly on his player so now I know that it was my player and not the video that was at fault. Now I need to replace my player. My apologies to the makers of the video TOPICS Entertainment.

Another update. I now own a Panasonic blu-ray 3D player and the video plays just fine and it is still gorgeous to watch and listen to as well for the stirring music accompaniment.",1351036800,3,2102,4.572944297082228
2390196,5,B000AOD8XC,"This is outstanding.  I've watched it several times, and the music and landscape captivates me everytime.  Throughout the program my mind keeps saying ""I want to be there"".",1350259200,3,172,5.107142857142857
2390197,5,B000AOD8XC,"This DVD gives a nice overview of the most beautiful landscapes of British Columbia from the air. To be at your destination to orient this is a good DVD. Personally, I have used this DVD together with the DVD ""Scenic National Parks Glacier, Banff and Jasper"" in my preparations for a holiday in Western Canada. These 2 DVDs deal on the basis of beautiful images and music of this beautiful area. I can recommend anyone who wants to get an idea of what this country has to offer.",1344211200,,478,4.443181818181818
2390198,2,B000AOD8XC,"I was disappointed in this project. I have other ""Over"" travelogs, and they are quite nice, thus I bought this one.

The voice and it's dialog are irritating to listen to. Grandiose speaking in a whispery manner, giving little actual information. Frankly I was glad that there were some unvocal spots in the video.

The photography is great as usual. If I watch this again, I will do so with the sound off, and my own music playing.",1342137600,6,432,4.5256410256410255

8078978,2,B000AOD8XC,Nice landscapes but commentary poor.  I didn't use it for my lecture because things like the shots of the deserted (apparently) Haida site give you the impression there are no contemporary First Nations people around nor what their role is.,1497398400,,240,5.0
