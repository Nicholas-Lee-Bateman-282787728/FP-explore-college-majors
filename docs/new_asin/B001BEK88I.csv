3491162,5,B001BEK88I,"I had never really heard of Bill Burr before I saw this, and I really wonder why not? He is now one of my favorite comedians. His material takes a new, well thought out perspective on a lot of things in modern life, which I had perhaps thought of before, but kept in the back of my mind. He really brings certain issues to life with a very truthful, and extremely funny viewpoint.  I will watch this again and again. Highly recommended.",1232150400,,436,4.317073170731708
3491163,5,B001BEK88I,"I've seen this show twice on comedy central and laughed out loud both times. He is perfect, knows his timing really well and he has chosen some interesting and fun ""facts"" to talk about.

Just see this. You will like it, I promise!",1229817600,,231,4.372093023255814
3491164,5,B001BEK88I,My mother and I saw him on TV for the first time and we were in hysterics.  I purchased this DVD for my husband to watch and he loved it!  Bill Burr is definitely a unique comedian with fresh new material.,1224720000,,205,3.975609756097561
3491165,5,B001BEK88I,This is a must have for any comedy fan. The aired tv version pales in comparison to the dvd. Bill Burr is one of the most intelligent and hilarious comedians around.,1224460800,12,165,4.354838709677419
3491166,5,B001BEK88I,I happened to catch Bill Burr's performance on Comedy Central. My hubby was out of town so I was watching it alone and was laughing so hard I literally had tears running down my face. He has the funniest act I have seen in a long time.  The next day I had to google him and found this DVD was soon to be released.  Sign me up! This DVD is definately one to have in your collection and I highly recommend it for those days when you need a good laugh.,1223942400,,449,3.923076923076923

3491170,5,B001BEK88I,"Have to admit, I had not heard of him before watching the Comedy Central presentation.  I haven't laughed that hard or often in quite some time.  He is mightily irreverent and spot on.  His choice of material was eclectic and yet most we've all thought or even wished we had said.  Definitely for adults. I went looking for the DVD right after seeing the show.  It was that good.",1221609600,,379,4.434782608695652
3491171,5,B001BEK88I,"I just saw this on the Comedy Channel. There are many comics out there who make me chuckle but this guy had me LMAO and ROFL, for sure, but the biggest compliment I could give him was that he had me laughing so hard I got into some serious snorting throughout the entire hour. If not for the commercial breaks, my laugh muscles may have cramped up but I want to live dangerously and own the uncut, uncensored and uninterrupted version, just to see if I can survive it.

I'm not even going to attempt to describe his act; I couldn't do it justice. Let's just say that he aloud says the things we all are thinking. You may even find yourself laughing while cringeing a little. I am female but I will admit his take on we women is dead-on.

I am definitely putting in my pre-order now.

I just wish I had been there in the audience.

2-25-13: I just watched this DVD again. It still made me laugh as hard as it ever did. For me,it doesn't get old.",1220140800,32,944,4.170329670329671

I believe his wife or girl-friend is African-American, so the stuff about different ethnicities etc is genuine and hysterical. If you can handle the language (it's not SUPER R-rated, but definitely rated R), then definitely check this out!  Note: There's some stuff about kids in the beginning -- funny stuff, but at the same time it can make you a little uncomfortable (but comedy intends to do that sometimes ;) ... but don't let it scare you, haha -- keep watching, it's so, so funny and I don't laugh at just anything, lol!

I've never laughed so hard, and I'm picky when it comes to comedy routines.  Bill Burr has his unique style, and his comedy isn't vulgar (well, maybe a couple swear words here and there).  I'd never heard of him but was searching for good stand-up, and am so glad I tried his videos out.  Bill Burr is the BEST!",1394064000,,470,4.1098901098901095

Of course it's a pointless endeavor, They aren't watching for they are not intellectually curious, nor would they recognize themselves in the descriptions or if they did they would not care.

3491340,5,B001BEK88I,"Bill Burr has quickly become my favorite comic of all time. His explanations of some of the simple mundane and usually stereotypical things that happen to everyone in all types of situations are hilarious.

3491343,5,B001BEK88I,"With apologies to Louis CK, Bill Burr is, in my opinion, the best comic working in the USA today. His northeastern sensibility, coupled with his ""every man"" subject matter brings laughs from the beginning of his show to the end. Of the two specials I own of Burr's, I have to say ""Let It Go"" is my favorite, but that doesn't detract from what this special is. And it's a laugh riot. Just let your mind go and allow him to say the things that you think in the back of your mind. Life is funny and the ability to see that in such a vibrant way is what makes Burr special. He isn't mean and he isn't menacing. He's that friend that says just enough ""wrong"" stuff that makes you wince at times, while bringing so much stuff that's right, that you just can't keep from inviting him over again and again. If you are a fan of stand up and can tolerate grown up language, buy this. If your feelings get hurt by the ""F"" word, then find Howie Mandell, Sinbad, or another comic that doesn't attack life with the same raw edge.",1338163200,8,1015,4.21025641025641

3491347,5,B001BEK88I,"Bill Burr is by far the funniest comedian out there. I love his sense of humor and the fact that he is very ""equal opportunity"" when making fun of groups of people.

He is an irreverent comedian who I like to think says what most everyday sane folks are thinking (and we're all everyday folks, right?). His comedy is biting and critical at times, so if you don't like that, you should pick someone else. I happen to appreciate what he has to say though. His talent is most apparent when he walks the fine line concerning touchy issues like race yet covers the subject with everyone smiling.",1303171200,,487,4.48314606741573

I have enjoyed this DVD from the moment I saw it on Comedy Central, to the days I put it on my iPod for car rides with my fiance.

His act is fresh and the concert film is free from those ridiculous distractions that plague so many comedy concert films nowadays.

He delivers his lines with perfect timing and attitude. Whether it is battling his demons that cause him to drive through pedestrians on the sidewalk or dealing with racist grandmothers, he is on target with his material without a wasted word or gesture.

Some may find his material misogynistic and offensive and often it is. It is also damn funny.",1268870400,,646,4.608695652173913

3491371,5,B001BEK88I,"Pure and simple: He's amazing.  I've shown this DVD to all my friends and family and not a person has been disappointed.  What is so relieving about his comedy is he utilizes intelligent humor, rather than 'easy laugh' humor that appears to be popular in this genre.  All I can say is that you won't be disappointed.  Also, check out his weekly FREE podcast on itunes, which also delivers free weekly comedy.  It helps makes those long commutes bearable.",1244592000,,454,4.69620253164557
3491372,5,B001BEK88I,"I saw this special on Comedy Central and had to have the full, uncensored experience.

Bill is hilarious.  His casual demeanour and hilarious facial and vocal expressions will catch you off-guard through the entire routine.

And I'm in total agreeance on the ""making useless people"" routine - couldn't have said it better myself!!!

Get to know Bill Burr - you'll be glad you did.",1243900800,,380,4.890625
3491373,5,B001BEK88I,saw the bleeped version on comedy central and had to see it uncut. This guy is really funny. If you need a good outloud laugh then this is one for you.,1235779200,,151,3.903225806451613
3491374,5,B001BEK88I,"Once you see this guy perform you are hooked! Funny,funny,funny! I wish he could take over The Tonight Show when Jay Leno leaves. In my opinion he is one of the best stand up comics of all time. The four hippest guys I know of are George Carlin, (Rest in Peace George) Lewis Black, Bill Maher, and Bill Burr.
Enjoy!",1234396800,,315,4.266666666666667
3491375,5,B001BEK88I,"Bill Burr has to be one of the funniest comedians alive. He is not well known to most of the public because he has not ventured very far out of the comedy circuit. Radio, stand-up, and a few appearances here and there but nothing special. BUT I gurantee once you see this video, and or just watch the Philadelphia performance in the extras (I am sure you can find it on YouTube) you will never forget him. Highly recommended, and his monday morning podcast is funny too.",1232841600,,470,4.413793103448276

8283028,5,B001BEK88I,"Bill Burr is extremely funny and definitely ignores the politically correct version when he does his comedy.  He is fresh, edgy and just says what many people think, but don't or won't actually say.  His subject matter ranges through a lot of areas, but while hilarious is definitely not kid friendly and may strike the easily offended the wrong way of taken as anything beyond a comedy  routine.  One of my favorite comics out there and this is one my favorite specials.",1501632000,,471,4.7073170731707314

Each time I see one of his acts hit the screen I immediately stop what I'm doing and check out his wisdom/wit concerning the latest insanity going on knowing that Bill Burr will have a remedy for the moment.
