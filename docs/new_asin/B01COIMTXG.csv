8753576,5,B01COIMTXG,I enjoyed watching this video. Made me wanna wish I was there in person.,1529884800,,72,4.214285714285714
8753577,5,B01COIMTXG,"I was looking for another group similar to SNSD now that their down to only five members and it's not clear if they'll be making any more music in the near future.  SNSD will always be my favorite but this group also has some very catchy tunes. One unique difference that I've never seen in other kpop acts is an excellent live band backing them in this concert. The guitarist really rocks out sometimes. This is the only concert I have of them so I don't know if this band always backs them at their concerts.
  Each of the six members also do an individual song and I liked all of them. Eunji  has a voice that soars in her number. Chorong does a sultry sexy performance that will knock your socks off. Bomi is very energetic and starts off playing the drums. Namjoo does a throwback number complete with huge bellbottom pants. Naeun and Hayoung do excellent dance tunes. All these girls are talented as they are gorgeous. Your bound to like each member although Eunji is my favorite. Eunji is the best singer and Bomi might be the best dancer.
  This show doesn't have the huge production value of an SNSD concert but don't let that deter you from seeing or purchasing it. This concert seems to get better and better after repeated viewings.",1519516800,,1244,4.482300884955753
