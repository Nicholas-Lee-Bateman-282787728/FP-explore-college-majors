8243906,4,0970903200,"This is a fun movie, a zany, homespun take on a home-based suburban institution.  If you're searching out a good deal - and a good laugh - you'll find what you're looking for in Garage Sale.",1163376000,,190,4.277777777777778
8243907,4,0970903200,"Midwest meets LA....I enjoyed all the characters and can not  wait to see the sequel.  The lighting, filming, writing, and direction puts a wonderful, cute, funny, spin on an event that is not any of those things.",1125705600,,213,4.72972972972973
8243908,1,0970903200,"Unless you are either A.) in the film, or B.) a friend or family, it is excruciatingly painful to watch the antics of this untalented family on film that would have been better off never being manufactured in the first place. I really had a small amount of hope while viewing that someone would have figured out what entertainment is, but it was spiraling out of control with unresolved characters and poor plot ""twists"". I beg you to spend you time wiser.  stare at the wall.",1085961600,,476,4.534883720930233
8243909,5,0970903200,"Wow, that beatnik scene was really amazing.  What a fantastic actor.  The lighting was exceptional.  The kids are fantastic little actors, and the grownups are pretty good, too.  I like watching this movie with gaffers.",1075161600,,219,5.171428571428572
8243910,5,0970903200,Great characters and an amusing tale make this well worth watching.  Of particular note are the two jokers whose whole exsistance seems to revolve around a keg of beer and a good buzz.  Brian Turner is hilarious.,1039046400,,212,4.702702702702703
8243911,5,0970903200,"an in-depth exploration of suburban culture, GARAGE SALE captures and develops a remarkable number of characters in this light-hearted family comedy.  most definitely a repeat-viewing type of movie, the subtleties one finds on the third or fourth viewing still jump out.  the kids are remarkably naturalistic in their acting, the mom and dad deliver as well.  the parade of friends and garage sale shoppers is loopy enough to accurately portray the culture (and be funny!!) while not being SO out there as to challenge believability.
GREAT THINGS COME IN SMALL PACKAGES, and this is a movie that packs a comedic and dramatic punch.  what is the director working on now?",1038009600,2,669,5.054545454545455
8243912,4,0970903200,"A delightful film, inspiring smiles, chuckles and belly laughs.  Dialogue captures ""American family"" at its sarcastic best--relatively clueless ""head"" of household, a mom who does all the heavy lifting, both physically and emotionally, and three of the most incisively sarcastic children you'll see on film, and who clearly won't buy the suburban bliss thing for an instant.
Set over the course of a one day garage sale in a cul-de-sac in Silicon Valley, the setting could be plastic-suburb-anywhere-USA, complete with mooching neighbors, lazy friends, and an endless parade of out-there losers displaying their precious little insecurities for all to see.  Very California, very America too.  Surrounded by the remarkably wasteful excesses of American culture--including a front-yard full of virtually unused exercise equipment-- the film portrays a growing sense of neighborhood, overcoming the BS and distance and irony and sarcasm to display an affirming human connection.  A hoot, a small movie that uses humor in incredible ways--aren't we all ""the lonely guy""?.  Great title song.  Director's commentary very entertaining as well.",1032048000,2,1137,5.658823529411765
8243913,4,0970903200,"I loved this movie because it rang true, which all good comedy should.
If for nothing else, watch it for some very funny one liners.",1023148800,3,132,4.32
