3787545,5,B001SXZ7TC,"Haven't seen this in years, was fun seeing it again.  The old disney movies are the very best.  Great for all ages.",1355961600,,115,4.181818181818182
3787546,5,B001SXZ7TC,"Excellent! Just as I remembered them! (And NOT CD (OR DVD -R) ""Made on Demand"" copies, but rather Studio releases.) Shipping was quick, merchandise arrived well-packaged and in good condition.",1355097600,,192,5.433333333333334
3787547,5,B001SXZ7TC,These are two great family movies.  They are filled with some very funny moments as well as some heartwwarming ones to.,1354492800,,119,4.666666666666667
3787548,3,B001SXZ7TC,"I remember watching and loving these movies as a kid, so I wanted to be sure to add them my growing kiddie film collection. The price is great and the quality was better than I expected, given the films are fairly old.

The gist of the original Shaggy Dog is that an awkward teen named Wilby - who has issues with his dog-hating ex-mailman dad - reads a spell off an enchanted ring and suddenly turns into a shaggy sheepdog. He can't control when he changes and through a series of comical events discovers his neighbors are spies with an evil plot and he convinces his dad to intervene. Happy endings all around.

Shaggy Dog DA is basically a continuation, we find Wilby as a grownup and after his house is robbed he throws in his hat to run for DA of the town - against a shady guy who has mob connections. The bad guy figures out the ring will transform Wilby and gets his ""paws"" on it. Wilby has to elude dog catchers and police to prove his rival is dirty. Another happy ending, of course.

The only thing I found surprising, when watching the original shaggy dog now as an adult - is how Wilson (the dad) speaks to his wife. I know things were different in the 50's and frankly, I don't remember thinking anything of it when I watched this film as a kid - but now as a mommy I'm a little uncomfortable with it. I just thought I'd point that out, it isn't a deal-breaker for me and we will still be watching these movies.

I have an almost-three year old that LOVES all things dog, but he wasn't that excited about these films. I think the story lines are too advanced, I'd recommend these movies for older kids - around 10 and up (that was about the age I first saw it).",1339200000,2,1676,4.228125
3787549,4,B001SXZ7TC,"Our whole family loves this set. Our 2 year old has only seen The Shaggy DA a couple times and loves quoting Tim Conway's character. ""You're off the gravy train. Understand? No more gravy, sheesh!"" The story is fun, the characters are fun, and it is a good clean movie. I don't really like the kid in the movie, because he is a bit disrespectful to his dad, but we point that out to our kids so they are aware that we expect very different behaviour. Anyway...You will love both the new and old versions. The original has a very young Annette Funicello, as well as Fred MacMurray, and lots of other great young actors. We enjoy both of these, and I bet you will, too!",1326412800,,667,4.301587301587301
3787550,5,B001SXZ7TC,"We are very happy with our purchase, a great duo of fun and clean entertainment. We like both movies but especially like the older version!! So cute the shaggy dog driving the car. What a riot.",1317427200,,193,4.388888888888889
3787551,4,B001SXZ7TC,"""THE SHAGGY DOG"" and ""THE SHAGGY D.A."" are currently available as part of a Walt Disney DVD package. [Also included is a colorized version of the original 1959 film which has the distinction of being the first black & white film colorized for TV--because certain critics and TV executives swore that viewers would NEVER watch black and white movies now that color was available! I'm gonna skip the colorized version and focus on the DOG and the D.A.].

Walt Disney knew his audience.  He realized that parents could take their children into almost any movie theatre in the world, load 'em up with popcorn, and keep the kiddoes entertained with a few cartoons, previews of soon-to-be-released Disney films, and a 90 minute comedy that Mom and Dad could also enjoy!  ""THE SHAGGY DOG"" with Fred MacMurray, Jean Hagen, Tommy Kirk, Kevin Corcoran, Tim Considine, and lovely Annette Funicello still keeps its promise. The film entertains everybody.

Stumbling across a ring inscribed with an ancient formula, Wilby Daniels (Kirk) begins to change from a typical 50s teenager to a not-so-typical Shaggy Dog.  This transformation occurs during the most unlikely times...and the mystery is solved at the end of movie!  There are several great character actors including Cecil Kellaway, Richard Deacon, and nasty Keenan Wynn--who was usually typecast as the villain in many Walt Disney movies.  But the interplay between Fred MacMurray (who up until the end of this film HATES dogs), Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran is what makes the film a classic.  The music is another component that moves the plot along.

""THE SHAGGY D.A."" is an update of the original story. But this time the film is in true color.  Dean Jones portrays Wilby Daniels as an adult...and the only returning character from the original film is Keenan Wynn. Several other fine actors try to add a little zing in order to speed the plot along. However, unlike its predecessor, ""THE SHAGGY D.A."" takes longer for the audience to accept the fact that 'the canine curse' is back! Without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it, there are a couple of plot twists interspersed with an updated man-to-dog transformation! But as with T.S.D., the movie is family friendly and works extremely well with a large bowl of microwave popcorn.",1317427200,7,2286,4.9763779527559056
3787552,5,B001SXZ7TC,"For anyone that remembers the days of the ""Shaggy Dog"" and all the associated spin off films this is a good purchase, myself purchasing it as a gift for kids around the age I was when I first saw the film, I think it was in the late 1950's but anyway a good purchase pricewise, delivered quickly and I plan on buying myself one now after hearing what a laugh the kids got out of it.

I was worried that the times were different and kids wouldn't find the film funny, black and white is how I remember the film too but don't know if it was colorized or not in this version but anyway I guess the film is ""Timeless"" because they have watched it a number of times now since Christmas.. How can kids do that??

I'll write a new review on the one I get from the perspective of a viewer and not so much a buyer of the DVD package.",1293667200,,824,4.0182926829268295

3787605,4,B001SXZ7TC,"''The Shaggy Dog'' is a good movie, maybe a comedy but its tone is mixed, it's a mysterious movie with funny moments especially in the last half hour after Wilson Daniels knows his son Wilby is now a talking dog, the cast is brilliant, these boys and girls acting in previous Disney productions such as ''Old Yeller'' and tv serials such as ''Spin and Marty'', ''The Hardy Boys'', ''Annette'', ''Zorro'' (during The Mickey Mouse Club) are really talented actors, in fact it's the first movie for Annette Funicello e the first Disney movie for Fred MacMurray.
''The Shaggy D.A.'' is in my opinion a more entertaining comedy, Tim Conway is brilliant and I like Dean Jones as the attorney Wilby Daniels who decides to run for D.A. after his house has been robbed, the cherry-pie fight is beautiful and the dog pound scenes are even moving scenes.
