I am a huge Himesh Fan, but you don't need to be to appreciate the sincerity and genuineness the Singer turned actor brings to his performance. Besides, there is no harm, is there? If you appreciate a man who actually honors his word and values respect, then you will appreciate what this film has to offer. Himesh is so believable and so sincere, it fortifies all the reasons why one should appreciate his freshman debut in this film. Yes, it is a true love story and the settings are beautiful. The songs alone capture you, but so does the performance of this humble artist. Great story, great music, great scenery- what more do you really need? Run, and I mean run, to see this great love story.",1300924800,,743,4.552238805970149
