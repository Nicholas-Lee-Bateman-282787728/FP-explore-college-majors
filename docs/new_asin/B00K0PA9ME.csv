6397829,5,B00K0PA9ME,"I remember this trial so vividly.  I was so angry at the attitude of so many men in particular.  So many non-listeners who had their minds made up ahead of time - just as many men in congress.  This DVD is very well done, with the reactions of the actors of
the time, and journalists (female).  Anita Hill was the classy woman I remember, although one can tell that this trial changed her
life.  I strongly recommend this DVD to women of all ages, and hope that this DVD will be played for our children, and grand-children, watched together, and explained.  Congratulations to the producers of this film.",1405728000,11,604,4.546296296296297
6397830,5,B00K0PA9ME,"A good and timely reminder of a bipartisan farce.  The unbalanced collection of old white ideologues were oblivious to the obvious.  Biden should be perpetually embarrassed for failing or refusing to allow corroborating witnesses to speak on Ms. Hill's behalf.  I have had juries dumber than the despicable committee, but not many.  If only the services of a crystal ball could have availed.  Then even the oblivious committee members could have known the essence of what they enabled.  John Dean recently put the impeachability of Thomas into a cogent essay.  Google it.",1405555200,7,571,5.141304347826087

6397836,3,B00K0PA9ME,"After Anita Hill receives a phone call from what sounds like the wife of a Supreme Court Justice this recounts the days in 1991 when she was called before Congress as she had accused a man who had been selected to fill an opening on the bench of inappropriate behavior.

This features her testimony and the discomfort and disbelief with which it was received. Eventually the accused speaks as well.

From there it chronicles her life since the whole situation as well as her life before. Insightful. There are yearly parties to remember the incident. She has received 20,000 pieces of mail. She never again wore the dress she wore to testify. Her companion appears.",1468108800,,665,4.773913043478261
6397837,5,B00K0PA9ME,"A wonderful documentary- when you think of the bozos in this movie that are still in power- clarence thomas or joe biden, republicans? it makes you sick. I think movies like this help us towards militant direct action to change the direction of this country- Anita spoke truth to power- the next step? Think about it. Well done to all involved.",1466208000,,344,4.655737704918033
6397838,5,B00K0PA9ME,"Anita accurately tells the story of Anita Hill, the woman who came forward with charges of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas. Many of my friends and I were already disappointed with the selection of Thomas to replace civil rights icon Thurgood Marshall, and learning about what happened to Anita Hill sealed the deal. We didn't want him confirmed and we took part in daily protests outside the Senate. Some of my friends appear in the background of the film. This is a must see for every young woman and man who cares about women's rights and civil rights. What happened to Hill was a travesty.",1460505600,2,602,4.742857142857143

6397841,3,B00K0PA9ME,"It was an interesting historical review of what happened to Anita Hill, but I wish the filmmakers would have explained more of what might have been going on with her or other victims. In one scene, for example, Anita is being interviewed and one of the panelists says something along the lines of ""why didn't you say anything then?"" I wish the filmmakers would have included information about ""why"" victims might NOT say something.",1436918400,2,431,4.837837837837838

6397844,5,B00K0PA9ME,"Well worth seeing.  I learned things I didn't know or had forgotten, especially about what Dr. Hill went through in the aftermath of the hearings.  Lovely to see what she's accomplished and where she is now.  Awesome to actually hear the voice mail from Ginni Thomas asking her to apologize - wow!  I believed her then, I believe her now, and my admiration has grown after watching this film.",1432512000,2,392,4.63768115942029

6397847,5,B00K0PA9ME,"This short but essential documentary accomplishes, among other things, the incredible task of identifying specific political game players as the biggest hypocrites of their generation. For that accomplishment alone, this film is essential stuff. Hypocrite Award #1 goes to Joe Biden, who shows phony compassion to Anita Hill by asking if her family has attended the hearing, when in fact he was just interested in manipulating and exploiting Ms. Hill's genuinely horrifying experiences for political purposes, as evidenced by his present-day inability to keep his embarrassing and sexist personal gender biases under wraps. Hypocrite Award #2 goes to the Democratic Party brass evidenced in this film (Mikulski, Kennedy, etc.) whose supposedly passsionate support of Ms. Hill as some sort of ""spokesperson for women's rights"" is invalidated within a year as they all stood staunchly and silently behind a serial sexual predator in his presidential candidacy.  Hypocrite Award #3 goes to the small gathering of professional political activists who chant ""Stop Thomas Now"", presumably because they are opposed to sexual harassment of women, when at least one of them present is currently directly involved in the campaign to draft the ex-president serial sexual predator's wife to be the next president.  For these weighty disclosures, all detailed in period footage for everyone to see, this film ""speaks truth to power"" in an unintended way that is thrilling, provocative, and important for all the right reasons. An outstanding piece.",1420070400,2,1535,5.5
6397848,4,B00K0PA9ME,Great movie..I used it to illustrate the senate confirmation procedures,1417910400,2,71,6.2
6397849,4,B00K0PA9ME,"The 2013 documentary ANITA: SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER reminds me of the thought I had during Anita Hill's testimony before the U.S. Senate in 1991, where she recounted sexual harassment she suffered under former colleague Clarence Thomas, whom President George Poppy Bush had nominated to the Supreme Court: Why is this getting all the attention? What about Thomas's poor qualifications? Did Bush operatives plan this, counting on Hill's honesty causing such uproar that no one would notice Thomas was just a political hack, a better fit to judge on DANCE FEVER than the nation's highest court?  Or was the background check that forced this reserved young woman into national fame simply a stroke of luck as while Thomas would be embarrassed, it was a price worth paying if it meant the distraction from his public record would result in Senate confirmation?

Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court decisions speak for him, albeit in language different though no less obscene than what he used on Anita Hill.  But if you've wondered about the life of Anita Hill before and after those October 1991 hearings, ANITA: SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER is a good start.  The film deals less with her history with Thomas than you might expect but that seems to be its point.  With all her detractors said about Hill in 1991 in mind, see how much holds up.

And it wasn't just 1991.  ANITA: SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER opens with the 2010 phone call to Hill from Ginny Thomas, wife of Clarence Thomas, asking her to apologize for what she said two decades ago.  While Anita Hill has not worn the blue dress she donned for her testimony since that Senate hearing, I'd like to see Hill wear it just one more time to visit Ginny Thomas and kick her in the ass.",1416182400,10,1728,4.717607973421927

8654922,5,B00K0PA9ME,"I see this film as essential viewing for every woman, and yes, every man.  Whenever I feel in need of a mentor, I rewatch this film for inspiration.  I'm white, a professional woman, and am not currently grappling with gender or sexual issues.  Throughout my career, I have been grateful to ""stand on the shoulders of giants.""  Attorney Hill is such a giant and her contribution is to everyone no matter their specific issue.",1523491200,,425,4.702702702702703
8654923,1,B00K0PA9ME,"I do not know the truth of the allegations. I do know that 15 women that worked during the timeframe of the incidents in question flatly refute them. In fact no witnesses that worked directly with Anita Hill collaborated her story.  I also know in this documentary that was suspiciously left out. I also know that the militant feminist politics drove the events that led to the Anita Hill hearings. This episode also illustrates the beginning of the dysfunction that currently exists in Washington DC. This episode was the genesis of the hyper partisanship of our national politics. The Democratic Party (and a lesser extent Republican Party) are controlled by their radical wings. This documentary however is worth watching, but you must round your understanding of it without outside information not provided in the documentary itself.",1523232000,,837,5.154411764705882

8654927,5,B00K0PA9ME,"It's amazing to me that this same issue of not taking women's equality seriously is still present today. When will women be on equal footing? Ratify the ERA NOW. It is still not an amendment in the Constitution for WOMEN to have equal rights. For a great overview of modern women's issues, RUN to see Equal Means Equal, available to view NOW. Let's make the ERA happen. Thank you to the wonderful, honorable Anita Hill for all she went through and for standing tall against inequality and sexual harassment. That guy, Clarence Thomas, is STILL on the bench. Tsk Tsk Tsk. This movie will explain everything. I was a young Christian woman when her hearing took place...wish I had known them what I know now - I was on the conservative side back then!!! OMG how blind patriarchy in religion and politics can make EVEN a young woman. YOU GO, ANITA!! Much love and respect. A must see documentary.",1492560000,,892,4.616352201257862

After watching Anita Hill's testimony, it did not occur to me that we could ever be in a situation where the incoming president might make Clarence Thomas look like an honorable man.
