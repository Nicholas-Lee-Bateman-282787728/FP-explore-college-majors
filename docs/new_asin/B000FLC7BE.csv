2572464,5,B000FLC7BE,"Ive never seen the original series so I can't compare it to that, but I really enjoy this series. Its a really good story. Im very happy with this.",1353110400,,147,4.103448275862069
2572465,5,B000FLC7BE,"I have to say I am very pleased with the reboot of the series.  I am a little say that it is on the chopping block for cancellation.

The voice work is superb, as is the art style.  As I grew up with the original show that I swear was voiced by 3 people it is fantastic that they have a full staff of voice artists doing the characters (If you have heard the original screeching voices you will understand). The artwork is top notch clean animations and easy to follow during action scenes. Good story as well very deep considering the audience it was intended for.

all in all a great buy in my opinion.",1341532800,4,604,4.181034482758621
2572466,5,B000FLC7BE,Awesome art and storyline.  A must for kids of all ages for lessons to be learned.  These episodes show a continuing quest by Lion-o and the rest of the Thundercats to rebuild their lives after the terrible defeat by Mumm-ra and the Lizards!,1341360000,3,241,4.5813953488372094
2572467,5,B000FLC7BE,"Book Two of Season One continues the adventures of Lion-O, his brother Tygra, Panthro, Snarf, Wilykit and Wilykat. Now with the Book of Omens in their possession, they travel to the outer wastelands, magical forests, and even dimensions searching for power stones that Mumm-Ra so desperately wants.

The Berbils make their debut in the reboot series, and they are still the loveable robotic teddy bears that I remember from the original series. They also return for another episode to help out Panthro with a new set of arms and they ""reboot"" the thundertank. The Trials of Lion-O Part one and two remind be of the five part episodes from the original.

Just like Book One there are only eight episodes, but these eight are well-written with great animation that any Thundercat's fan will enjoy. Sadly, I'll have to wait until October for the Book 3, which will have ten episodes, to come out.",1339372800,,893,4.830065359477124
2572468,5,B000FLC7BE,"I just have to say that I am amazed!!  Most ""reboots"" of older cartoons are very bad (like GI Joe) are just running on the popularity of the old ones.  This is done very well and is awesome!  Almost letting Lion-O grow up and learning responsibility of being Lord of the Thundercats.  His rivalry with Tigra is pretty intense and interesting.  I hope that they don't blow it, either!  Good job!!",1338940800,6,395,4.492957746478873

2572562,5,B000FLC7BE,"This new Thundercats  Season 1- Book 2, TV series is a great series and more entertaining than the first classic series in my opinion.",1455580800,,134,4.583333333333333

2572609,5,B000FLC7BE,"I have the collected edition of the 80's version, and wanted this simply to have all that is out there but I find it to be an interesting take on the TC it gives backstory where there was none before, it changes a bit of the lore, and does it in a fun way. I still prefer the 80's version but this WAS enjoyable.",1414886400,,312,3.890625
2572610,5,B000FLC7BE,Great stories!  Wish it wasn't canceled!  I'm expecting the Third Chapter anytime now soon !,1407974400,,92,5.066666666666666
2572611,4,B000FLC7BE,"To say the least its pretty good. The first episode was in my opinion not the way to start but minus that, the rest of the season builds up to a great ending. Most surprisingly is the integration of Buddhist and Hindu beliefs to further the story along. Very nice and brings good young adult themes into what i wish was a ""several season series"" Dam cartoon network.",1402963200,,366,4.397058823529412
2572612,5,B000FLC7BE,"Great series.  Just as good as, if not better than the original.  Great for daddy and kids time or chilling with the fam.",1395532800,,121,4.217391304347826
2572613,5,B000FLC7BE,"This is the continuation of the Cartoon Network remake of Thundercats.

 The series is a fresh look at a classic from my childhood. All of the original characters are represented, and the premise of the entire show is more or less the same... There are a few changes, but all of them are aimed at making the show more palatable for a younger, more tech-and-animation-savvy generation. If you were a fan then, you'll definitely be a fan now...",1387843200,,442,4.653846153846154
2572614,1,B000FLC7BE,"Animation and plotlines leave much room for improvement. Character design was lacking. the voice talent wasn't bas but i wish that the animation looked better, i was hopeing for another ""young justice""",1385942400,,201,5.3125

2572616,5,B000FLC7BE,"I bought this to replace the one that i had lost a while back .I got it at a great price which was great for me. This show is still one of my favorite 1980's cartoons. Back when cartoons were worth watching, and not like the crap that they show now!!!!",1372896000,3,252,3.9607843137254903
