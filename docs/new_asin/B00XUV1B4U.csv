I love the way that all the discs look the same as well as the interfaces for each movie are the same as the Fury Road interface.  Very well done.

Trailer

Mad Max: Fury Road
(It's a shame, because the first three movies go right to the main menu, but Fury Road unfortunately features a Black Mass trailer and an ad for Digital Movies at the start.)
Maximum Fury: Filming Fury Road (29 Min.)
Fury on Four Wheels (23 Min.)
The Road Warriors: Max and Furiosa (11 Min.)
The Tools of the Wasteland (14 Min.)
The Five Wives: So Shiny, So Chrome (11 Min.)
Fury Road: Crash & Smash (4 Min.)
Deleted Scenes

And the fifth disc is the feature length documentary on the first film. It's a whopping 2 and a half hours long, and it's a definite must watch for fans of Mad Max. Unfortunately, it is in Standard Definition.

Also included are four art cards, one for each film. They are fairly thin, but feature some gorgeous artwork from the films. I have attached a photo so you can view for yourself.

I think at $50, this is a solid purchase. Anything more and I would say wait, as the price keeps fluctuating. If you own the first three, you unfortunately aren't getting anything new here besides the documentary. We don't know for sure if George Miller will make more Mad Max films, but it has been talked about so keep that in mind in terms of a complete collection.",1440892800,141,1830,4.6265432098765435
7199670,5,B00XUV1B4U,"Really cool collection. The movies of of course are great,  and look amazing on Blu ray, especially Fury Road. Completely blew me away. Surprisingly, after all these years, George Miller is at the absolute top of his game! If you haven't seen it yet, you are in for a crazy ride. The collectible art cards are very cool too.",1440806400,6,324,4.491525423728813

7199672,3,B00XUV1B4U,Mad mad is one of the weirdest movies I've seen. The first two are very odd - very sporadic. Thunderdome and Fury are much more palatable IMHO.,1463356800,,143,4.333333333333333

7199676,4,B00XUV1B4U,"A great set of four films of Max's apocalypse. However, what happened to ""Beyond Thunderdome"". They put all of the films except that one in this set. Pretty much of a rip -off job by Warner Home Video. It's still a bargain compared to the $249.00 Special Edition of Mad Max: Fury Road with Max's Interceptor V8model. (which for that price should come encased in gold.)"" You can buy the anthology and get ""Thunderdome"" as a separate less expensive separate movie for $10.24 in Blu Ray. Low price since the anthology sells for $54.95 in Blu-Ray. However, I'll wait for the Interceptor V8 Special Edition to drop in price or at least keep the same price but contain all the movies and the Interceptor V8. That would probably be worth the higher price. I have all the Mel Gibson versions on DVD and VHS so there's no rush.",1459036800,,818,4.533783783783784

7199698,3,B00XUV1B4U,"I'm a massive Mad max fan so i already own the first 3 films on blu-ray
i already own the scream factory blu-ray version of Mad max which is much better blu-ray release
than the barebones warner bros version in this Anthology
the scream factory blu-ray has new special features plus the old mad max Phenomenon doco from the old 2002 dvd
the warner bros version is s*** it's barebones just has the original trailer

so i did some research and found out that this 5th disc is not available seperatly
it's only available in this Anthology blu-ray set which is very unfortunate other wise i wouldn't bought this blu-ray set
just to watch the 5th Disc
which is what i did i only bought this blu-ray set to watch the Documentary and i have no regrets either
MADNESS OF MAX incredible Documentary
produced & Directed by Tim ridge who was one of the crew members on the Fury road set
and only in standard Definition widescreen not sure of the ratio maybe between 1:78:1-1:85:1
but still is incredible Documentary nethertheless
it's 2hour 25mins just on the making of the original Mad max film
the topics covered are the original Idea, the script, the casting, the production, the filming, special visual effects
the editing, the music score the release and Legacy
so many cast & crew from the film are interviewed, most of the Actors who played the Bikie gang members are interviewed
Hugh keays byrne (Toecutter)Tim Burns (Johnny the boy) Paul Johnstone (Gundalini) David bracks (Mudguts) Geoff parry (Bubba zanetti)
and only some of the actors who played the MFP police are interviewed
Mel Gibson of course, Steve Bisely (Jim Goose) John Ley (Charlie) Steve millichamp (Roop) Roger ward (Fifi macaffee)
Joanne samuel who played Max's wife Jessie is interviewed
Producer Byron kennedy was killed in Helicopter crash back in 1983
so there's only Audio interviews from him recorded back in the early 80's
stunt co-ordinator Grant page, Cinematographer David eggby, Production manager Jenny Day, George miller is interviewed of course
special effects supervisor Chris murray and other behind the scenes crew
lots & lots of behind the scenes photos and behind the scenes film footage that has only now just surfaced
there's no extras on this Disc eg extended interviews or outtake interviews, none of that
i'm a bigger fan of the first 3 than the new sequel
so i didn't care about the first 3 films or fury road in the blu-ray set, i just bought it for the 5 Disc
warner bros had already released mad max 2 & thunderdome on blu-ray years ago anyway
and only now they released the first mad max in this blu-ray trilogy packed in clamshell case with Disc trays
and Fury road is available seperatley anyway
so to me the first 3 discs in this set is nothing new
i'm not surprised that Warner bros did not make a Legacy doco themselves about the films and added it in this blu-ray set
it shows wb couldn't be bothered making the effort
so they obviously saw Tim ridge's Doco and said yes add that to the blu-ray set
3 stars for the Anthology set, cause the only highlight is the 5th Disc in my opinion",1444176000,9,3084,4.669117647058823
7199699,4,B00XUV1B4U,"I love the movies, however this package at this price should include the digital versions, too. Also was unable to use Vudu's disc-to-digital option, sadly, for $2 per disc.",1444003200,,173,5.0

7199701,4,B00XUV1B4U,You get the first 3 real Mad Max movies on blue ray and that is worth the trouble.  The fourth movie is over-done in an attempt to over top the originals.,1443398400,,154,3.967741935483871

7199704,5,B00XUV1B4U,"These movies are great.  Much better than when I watched them many years ago as a older teenager/young adult.  Now that I am in my early 50s, I really appreciate all of the small details, the facial expressions, etc,. and the action scenes are superb.  But these movies are great for all those old enough to watch them.  The older ones are not outdated.  This is also the first time where I ordered older movies on Blue Ray and the quality was actually as it should be, excellent, both visual and audio.  If you are a fan of Mad Max, I highly recommend this anthology.",1442620800,3,568,4.3619047619047615
7199705,2,B00XUV1B4U,Now this set is 5 discs being the extra disc the making of part one now it also comes with 4 cardboard which has the artwork for all 4 movie posters so if you don't have any mad max's yet this could be a good choice because it has the new one to so if you already have them well you don't need this anthology and if you want to collect a good mad max blu ray get the scream factory version. because this has all the original blu rays from the MGM and Warner and you can buy the blu rays separate alone cheap,1442448000,2,507,3.8380952380952382

7199707,3,B00XUV1B4U,"The quality of all four films are very good transfers and I enjoy what little special features there are to offer for the individual discs. But, if you already own the individual films, there's little incentive to have this boxset. It was clearly pushed out for the sake of having an anthology. At least The Madness of Max is there, albeit a DVD.",1442188800,,346,4.507936507936508

Came one time and can't wait to watch them!",1442188800,,111,3.8260869565217392
7199709,4,B00XUV1B4U,"The only problem here is Fury Road. The Fury Road story was true to the Mad Max mythos; however, the production was more in line with a zombie movie. The violence was all in fits and spurts, as if they producers opted not to hire a stunt coordinator who understood hand-to-hand combat and they had to hide the face with bad editing. The anthology would have rated five stars had Fury Road got that one little thing right. For the writing and other non-violent production, it is all good. Acting is what you expect.
Thankfully, the other three movies are as awesome as ever. The new production team couldn't screw them up.",1441670400,,621,4.553571428571429
7199710,5,B00XUV1B4U,"AWESOME.....The movie's are fantastic...I just watched the movies on Blu. I have never seen them before, even tho I was a huge fan of Mel Gibson back in the 80's...everyone said to catch them on the big screen. Well, now, I have a 80 inch screen and a sound system.
Let me say, these are made for your home system. ""Mad Max"" is loud, ""Warrior"" is louder and ""Thunderdome"" and ""Fury"" are the best. I really like ""Thunderdome"" cause it also has Tina Turner at the middle of her awesome comeback in the 80's....watching the credits come at the screen while Tina is singing to a slamming beat is the reason I have a big screen and a huge subwoofer.......and the awesome opening airplane shot is unreal.....
The subwoofer blows me away with the BASS.......and.....Mel Gibson strutting around in tight leather in his prime.......(HAWT!!!!)
