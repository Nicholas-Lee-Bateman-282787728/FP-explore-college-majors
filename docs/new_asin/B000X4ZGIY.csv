8227017,4,B000X4ZGIY,"Wolfgang Lotz was born at Mannheim, Germany in 1921 to a Jewish mother, Helene, and a non-Jewish German father, Hans.[1] Lotz's father was a theater director who worked alongside his wife, an actress. His parents were non-religious to the extent that Lotz's mother did not even care to have her son circumcised at birth, contrary to Jewish practice. This later proved to be advantageous in his career as a spy; the fact that Lotz had not been circumcised enabled him to convince his lovers that he was not Jewish. His parents divorced in 1931; in 1933, after Adolf Hitler came to power, Lotz and his mother emigrated to Palestine, where they settled in Tel-Aviv. He adopted the Hebrew name Ze'ev Gur-Arie, and began to study at the agricultural school at Ben Shemen. In 1936 he joined the Haganah and engaged in a number of security duties.

After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Lotz was recruited into the British Army because of his knowledge of the German language. He was stationed in Egypt, where he joined an intelligence unit and mostly interrogated German POWs. After the war, he returned to Israel and was involved in smuggling weapons for the Haganah.

In 1948 Lotz married an Israeli Jew, Rivka, and they had a son, Oded. At the outbreak of the Independence War in 1948 Lotz joined the newly formed Israel Defense Forces and served with the rank of Captain.

After the war, Lotz joined Aman. His superiors planned to send him to Egypt to gather intelligence on Gamal Abdel Nasser's armaments plans. Aman also hoped that because of Lotz's command of the German language and his Aryan appearance, he could infiltrate the circle of German scientists who worked on the Egyptian armaments programs.",1389571200,4,1711,4.812925170068027

8227021,5,B000X4ZGIY,"Interesting piece of history especially that the producer blends in his documentary real footage from Lotz's son archives. Espionage stories always have a miserable ending; when the fizz is gone after all that emotional and mental strain, normal life is anticlimatic",1328486400,3,266,5.512195121951219
