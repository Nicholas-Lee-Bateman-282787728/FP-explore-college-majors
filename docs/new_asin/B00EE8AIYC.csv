8604634,4,B00EE8AIYC,"It is a good documentary of what was an awkward, difficult successor to the Twin Towers. My only reservation is probably more with the actual project that One World Trade represents, than with the documentary. The Twin Towers were the tallest buildings in the world, at least for a brief time. One World Trade carries no such distinction.",1467763200,,338,4.844827586206897
8604635,5,B00EE8AIYC,Best doc about 9/11.  Showed to my 5th grade class in preparation of our visit down there.  It got a standing ovation. Really captures everything in the perfect way.,1446076800,2,165,4.655172413793103
