I didn't return, because it would have cost too much to return it with the restocking fee and all.  I recycled it.",1391990400,2,248,4.3478260869565215

The title POWER, PASSION AND MURDER cannot be found anywhere at imdb. That's because this really isn't a movie at all-- it's a bizarre shuffling together and extreme shortening of two 56 minute episodes from the brief-lived 1980s PBS series, ""Tales from the Hollywood Hills."" Running time here is about 83 minutes total.

The original chapters were called ""Natica Jackson,"" with Michelle Pfeiffer and Hector Elizondo, and ""A Table at Ciro's,"" with Darren McGavin and Stella Stevens. Tossing these two completely unrelated stories together makes for (as you can imagine) a good deal of confusion.

The Pfeiffer episode was originally an adaptation of John O'Hara's story about 1930s Hollywood. Miss Pfeiffer is an actress (typecasting!) in love with a very married man. McGavin's entry was scripted by Budd Schulman. Here, he's a studio head fallen on hard times who invites some actors for dinner at a fancy nightspot.

After working hard to follow these two sandwiched tales, the whole miasma simply ends, leaving startled and disappointed viewers with no resolution or conclusion. Everything suddenly STOPS, just like this revi........",1293408000,5,1342,5.316037735849057

7999224,1,B0000CF341,"Based upon the positive reviews, as a Michelle Pfeiffer fan I purchased this movie.  Wow, am I sorry.  The movie is actually two poorly edited, non-intertwining SHORT stories.  To be truthful, I feel bad for Michelle, who clearly tried her best.  As for this being an unrated movie, I can not begin to guess why--it is a GP (at worst, and really just a G) movie.  I'd be happy to send you my copy for postage.

Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.  My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments.  So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.  Thanks.",1203897600,16,760,4.410071942446043
7999225,4,B0000CF341,"This delightful and mysterious film is two stories in one..Other reviews cover Michelle Pfeiffer's love story which ends in tragedy. I enjoyed the film because of Darren McGavin, it made me miss him all the more..His story is also a semi tragedy but my complaient is that both stories end too soon..But it totally held my attention..It was great to see a young Hector Elsando (sp.?)when he was very young....This was shot in the early stages of Michele Pfeiffer's career and she has never been better..A very interesting film.",1161475200,6,526,4.921348314606742
