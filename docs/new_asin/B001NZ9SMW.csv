I always get asked to help with the school plays and such since I am a professional makeup artist, and doing face painting for the annual fair, parades, halloween, and other holiday events was the next step. I saw this video about a year ago and it really helped me improve my face painting skills using techniques I know from my makeup artistry and some of the things that Sharon Neilson revealed to me. It's definitely a different medium to get used to, but it is a lot of fun and the kids (and occasional adults!) are always pleased with my work.

I love to be creative and I really enjoy learning this craft from other experts. Sharon Neilson is incredibly talented and could help teach anyone at any skill level how to face paint. I love watching her and seeing how quickly she can put a look together. Its easy to make subtle variations to the designs for different people, and really make it your own each time. The designs that she shows in this video are great. Very easy to pick up her techniques, of which she has many!

This video is well put together, informative, and really helpful for putting a kit together and learning basic skills. Each of the designs that she demonstrates are quick enough to do. These are some of the most asked for designs in my experience.",1430438400,2,1385,4.448818897637795

Lots of dress up parties, face painting parties and I now have a great DVD to turn to when I am or the kids are stuck for ideas. Whether it's Christmas parties, summer parties, or if the kids just want to have a bit of fun dressing up at the weekend, I highly recommend this to other parents. Face painting is lots of fun and totally worth the time when you see the smile of the kids' faces afterwards!",1415491200,,525,4.0576923076923075
