8394179,4,B003CD9DAA,"This was an entertaining Kung Fu drama about a fortune teller who finds himself caught between the forces of good and evil. Enlisted to find previously black listed martial arts experts, he and his group of friends travel ancient China to discover their whereabouts and to enlist them in the famous ""Golden Seal battle,"" a fight between the good and the evil martial arts gangs.

I found the story engrossing, especially the beginning. However, towards the end, I felt it lagged a bit, as it became increasingly predictable. I ended up not liking the physician Lai Yeuk-Yee, as he went too far in my opinion, to cure his sweetheart. I also felt some of the other character's relationships were just too simplistic, such as the spoiled daughter of the martial arts good leader who ran off with the evil asssasin. That guy was creepy looking and silly with the green eyebrows and the relationship was a bit unrealistic. His redemption and their relationship took WAY too much time. I would've preferred she marry the good heir... At least it would've been less predictable and more authentic to the period. Every character in this story had a love match. Kind of zero tension that way.

Overall, I still liked it, but I prefer my martial arts drama to not be so predictable. I like a twist here and there, and this one just was fairly boiler plate. Still, most of the characters were endearing and there were some good fight scenes as well as a decent plot. It just wasn't anything too awe inspiring.",1329609600,,1498,4.692015209125476
