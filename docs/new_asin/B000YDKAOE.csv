3026150,4,B000YDKAOE,"ALPHA VIDEO is a provider of vintage programming that's often unavailable elsewhere. Alpha's prices are fair, but so is transfer quality of some of their offerings. None have undergone restoration, yet this product's rareness and reasonable cost make it a worthwhile purchase.

The Three Mesquiteers movies were inspired by a number of William Colt MacDonald dime novels. This trio's popularity led to imitations by other studios: Range Busters, Rough Riders, Texas Rangers and lesser three-man oaters all descended from the Mesquiteers.

Although THE THREE MESQUITEERS (1936) is officially the first entry in this series, that honor technically goes to RKO's POWDERSMOKE RANGE (1935). It starred Hoot Gibson as Stony Brooke, Harry Carey as Tucson Smith and 'Big Boy' Williams as Lullaby Joslin. The actual TM series came after the creation of REPUBLIC Pictures that very same year.

Fifty-one Mesquiteer westerns were made by REPUBLIC between 1936 and '43, with the main actors never constant. Stony was played by John Wayne, Tom Tyler and Robert Livingston. Lullaby was variously Jimmie Dodd, Rufe Davis, Sid Saylor or Max Terhune, with Raymond Hatton appearing 9 times as 'Rusty' Joslin. Bob Steele and Ray Corrigan split the Tucson role almost equally. Athough the cast rotated often, one constant was a ventriloquist's dummy named Elmer Sneezeweed.

In RANGE DEFENDERS, Stony's brother is wanted for a murder he didn't commit. He asks the Mesquiteers to help prove his innocence.

In WILD HORSE RODEO, Stony comes to regret capturing a legendary wild horse and giving it to a Wild West show.

""Range Defenders"" has a unique distinction in that it's title pretty much accurately describes the story, which wasn't always the case with Westerns of the era --- It breezes by pretty quickly in just under an hour, and doesn't wear out it's welcome --- Watch for two baddies are played by Harry Woods and John Merton, and two meaner cusses never existed --- Of course one of my favorite character actors Earle Hodgins plays sheriff Dan Gray, always a pleasure to behold.

Our story line and plot, The question is will Tucson Smith (Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan) and Lullaby Joslin (Max Terhune) members of the Three Mesquiteers have trouble picking out the real Stony Brooke, what's amiss --- Dude's gang captures Stony and seeing the resemblance, Dude (Robert Livingston) poses as Stony (Robert Livingston) --- Wanted for the robberies and murder committed by Dude, a wounded Stony escapes. After Doc Martin (Jack Mulhall) fixes him up, Dude's gang kidnaps Martin to operate on Dude --- Now it's Stonys turn to pose as Dude as the Mesquiteers try to round up the gang --- One of the favorite plot lines in filmdom is the one in which two people look so amazingly alike that they could almost be twins. Of course, this was also a favorite plot line in novels as well (""The Prisoner of Zenda"" and ""A Tale of Two Cities"" come to mind) --- With the departure of John Wayne to more prestigious films, Robert Livingston returned to the role of Stony Brooke in Republic's ""Three Mesquiteers"" series.

The Three Mesquiteers movies were inspired by a number of William Colt MacDonald dime novels. This trio's popularity led to imitations by other studios: Range Busters, Rough Riders, Texas Rangers and lesser three-man oaters all descended from the Mesquiteers.

Although THE THREE MESQUITEERS (1936) is officially the first entry in this series, that honor technically goes to RKO's POWDERSMOKE RANGE (1935). It starred Hoot Gibson as Stony Brooke, Harry Carey as Tucson Smith and 'Big Boy' Williams as Lullaby Joslin. The actual TM series came after the creation of REPUBLIC Pictures that very same year.

Fifty-one Mesquiteer westerns were made by REPUBLIC between 1936 and '43, with the main actors never constant. Stony was played by John Wayne, Tom Tyler and Robert Livingston. Lullaby was variously Jimmie Dodd, Rufe Davis, Sid Saylor or Max Terhune, with Raymond Hatton appearing 9 times as 'Rusty' Joslin. Bob Steele and Ray Corrigan split the Tucson role almost equally. Athough the cast rotated often, one constant was a ventriloquist's dummy named Elmer Sneezeweed.

In RANGE DEFENDERS, Stony's brother is wanted for a murder he didn't commit. He asks the Mesquiteers to help prove his innocence.

In WILD HORSE RODEO, Stony comes to regret capturing a legendary wild horse and giving it to a Wild West show.

Our story line and plot, Our heroes Stony Brooke (Robert Livingston), Tucson Smith (Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan) and Lullaby Joslin (Max Terhune) members of the Three Mesquiteers arrive on the scene as Stony's brother George (Thomas Carr) has been accused of murder and the Mesquiteers have returned to prove his innocence --- But they find that John Harvey (Harry Woods) rules the town along with his stooge Sheriff Gray (Earle Hodgins) and that George won't get a fair trial --- Republic Studios made quite a few Three Mesquiteers adventures, with a whole host of cowboy stars, including Bob Steele, Tom Tyler, Ray Hatton, and believe it or not, even John Wayne following his Lone Star film days --- Livingston, Corrigan and Terhune seem to have appeared in most of them as a trio, though they did trade off with others as necessary. ""Range Defenders"" has a unique distinction in that it's title pretty much accurately describes the story, which wasn't always the case with Westerns of the era --- It breezes by pretty quickly in just under an hour, and doesn't wear out it's welcome --- Watch for two baddies are played by Harry Woods and John Merton, and two meaner cusses never existed --- Of course one of my favorite character actors Earle Hodgins plays sheriff Dan Gray, always a pleasure to behold.

After Doc Martin (Jack Mulhall) fixes him up, Dude's gang kidnaps Martin to operate on Dude --- Now it's Stonys turn to pose as Dude as the Mesquiteers try to round up the gang --- One of the favorite plot lines in filmdom is the one in which two people look so amazingly alike that they could almost be twins. Of course, this was also a favorite plot line in novels as well (""The Prisoner of Zenda"" and ""A Tale of Two Cities"" come to mind) --- With the departure of John Wayne to more prestigious films, Robert Livingston returned to the role of Stony Brooke in Republic's ""Three Mesquiteers"" series.

""The Three Mesquiteers"" was a western series that had three heroes. Rita Cansino leads the list of actors, she plays a cantina entertainer. The story begins at a ""Wild Horse Refuge"". Riders are arrested for entering this area. But they are freed because they have an excuse. A young lady waves to Stony, he leaves to join her. The sheriff and the Three Mesquiteers prevent McGowan and his boys from gaining a small fortune. A young boy uses an air rifle on the street. There is a song in the tavern. There is a fight in the bar. ""O Mighty King of the Wild Horses."" Can they paint a horse and create a stampede to destroy crops? The people want an end to this problem. The sheriff falls and is trampled by that pinto. Tucson is the new sheriff now. Can they use a colt to trap that pinto stallion?

But this wild pinto has never been shod! [If the shoe doesn't fit, you must acquit.] Stony shows his nerve, but the crowd wants a dead horse. Rita dances in the cantina. Elmer preaches at the bar. Rita is told about Stony's financial status. Will she return to New York? Stony decides to free the pinto. He is chased. McGowan has a plan. Stony learns about that black horse. McGowan wants another body as proof of the wild pinto's danger. Can something go wrong with the plan? Lullaby and Tucson arrive to free Stony. McGowan and his boys return for a shoot-out. Can the heroes survive? And capture McGowan's boys? [Yes, even if it is implausible.] At the end Lullaby shows his pig call. But guess what shows up in the Arizona desert?

This is based on a book which argued for saving the wild horses of Arizona. Is that still true today?",1467849600,,1662,4.3896103896103895

8232027,4,B000YDKAOE,"ALPHA VIDEO offers bargain priced, often hard-to-find vintage movies that are ideal for those willing to skip DVD extras. Their transfers show no evidence of restoration, so quality varies from one title to the next, with ""fair to good"" being the average.

The Three Mesquiteers movies were inspired by a number of William Colt MacDonald dime novels. This trio's popularity led to imitations by other studios: Range Busters, Rough Riders, Texas Rangers and lesser three-man oaters all descended from the Mesquiteers.

Although THE THREE MESQUITEERS (1936) is officially the first entry in this series, that honor technically goes to RKO's POWDERSMOKE RANGE (1935). It starred Hoot Gibson as Stony Brooke, Harry Carey as Tucson Smith and 'Big Boy' Williams as Lullaby Joslin. The actual TM series came after the creation of REPUBLIC Pictures that very same year.

Fifty-one Mesquiteer westerns were made by REPUBLIC between 1936 and '43, with the main actors never constant. Stony was played by John Wayne, Tom Tyler and Robert Livingston. Lullaby was variously Jimmie Dodd, Rufe Davis, Sid Saylor or Max Terhune, with Raymond Hatton appearing 9 times as 'Rusty' Joslin. Bob Steele and Ray Corrigan split the Tucson role almost equally. Athough the cast rotated often, one constant was a ventriloquist's dummy named Elmer Sneezeweed.

In COME ON, COWBOYS, the Mesquiteers join a circus in order to investigate a counterfeiting ring. Stony performs sharpshooting tricks, Tucson plays a strongman and Lullaby and Elmer do a ventriloquism act. This setting also allows Stony to don a gorilla suit!
(Note: the 79 minute running time indicates that an episode of STORIES OF THE CENTURY is also included.)
