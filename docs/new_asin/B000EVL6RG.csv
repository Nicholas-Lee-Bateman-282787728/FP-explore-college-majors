8114694,2,B000EVL6RG,"I suppose that's to be expected from gun camera footage taken at the dawn of WWII, but I honestly expected more. RareAviation.com usually produces better, longer DVDs and I fully expected this to be like other WWII gun camera films.

However this DVD contains just a few very brief scenes, each literally a few seconds long, and the footage is very grainy and blurry. The preceding titles often run longer than the shots themselves. The total running time is in the range of 10 minutes -and then the entire reel is repeated in slow motion, in order I suppose to increase the total running time, as even the titles and the scrolling text introduction is slo-moed.

There's very little distinguishable action, and there are few really interesting shots. The first one shows an attack on a part of e/a with a surprise ending, and there are a couple of shots of large bomber formations, and that's literally it.

In short, I know this is rare footage and was probably hard to get, but a more honest description from the seller would probably be in order. Hopefully this review will make future buyers aware of the actual contents of this DVD.",1142467200,6,1138,4.68
