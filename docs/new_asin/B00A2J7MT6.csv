8546227,5,B00A2J7MT6,The really interesting part of this movie to me is that the movie was filmed where all of the events in the life of Christ place according to history of the Holy Land.  The fact that the music came from the heart and faith of Johnny Cash made it very good.  June Cash played Mary the Mother of Jesus.  The music was written by Johnny Cash as was the movie.  A must have for fans of John and June Carter Cash.,1392163200,,408,4.0
