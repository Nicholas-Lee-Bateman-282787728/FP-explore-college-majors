4852416,5,B005OK0YNE,Great Movie!,1406073600,,12,5.5
4852417,4,B005OK0YNE,"I enjoyed this pilot, but am feeling a bit let down by the fact that, aside from The Longest Drive DVD, which, apparently, is two episodes of the series, the rest of the series is not available. It's like reading the first chapter of a book and then realizing that aside from a middle chapter, the rest is missing.

I understand it was cancelled before the show could conclude its first season and there are episodes that were made but never aired. Therefore, given the fact that Kurt Russell is a reasonably popular star, isn't it about time that this series was given a full DVD release with it's missing episodes? With shows like The Chisholms, the excellent How the West Was Won and also the lesser known shows - to me anyway - like 26 Men, Mackenzie's Raiders, Restless Gun, River Boat and the short-lived Oregon Trail all receiving releases,many as full series', isn't it about time that The Quest also enjoyed a similar treatment? Or at the very least they could make the rest of the show available as separate releases in some form. Indeed it won a Spur Award for one episode.

No doubt potential sales figures are a factor but I'd rather they'd released none than to make two available and not the rest. Given that this DVD was released in 2011, it doesn't look as though Sony are keen to let us see the remaining episodes.",1404604800,13,1332,4.522821576763485

the over all story is great, many happy, funny moments, and some sad.
I enjoyed every minute of this movie.",1366070400,7,199,4.714285714285714
4852420,5,B005OK0YNE,"I have had no problems watching this DVD.  I have waited a long time to be able to see this again, it was well worth the wait.  Very enjoyable.",1361059200,2,143,3.896551724137931
4852421,3,B005OK0YNE,"This was the Pilot for a new series, that for some reason, didn't last very long. I thought it was a good premise but I guess the westerns were beginning to die out. I was the Location Manager for this Pilot. Although it was supposed to be in the great Northwest, we shot it in San Rafael Valley, about 15 miles South of Patagonia, Arizona. We were only about one mile from the Mexican border. I think you will enjoy this show because it tells it like it really was in the old west.",1360281600,19,482,4.138297872340425
4852422,4,B005OK0YNE,The Quest is a story that I have been searching for.  I would love to get the box set.  I remember the late nights staying up just to catch the next adventure.  I hope the box set is offered.,1353542400,,191,3.8461538461538463
4852423,3,B005OK0YNE,"I have bought two other dvd's from Amazon where they have said region free and they have played with no problems at all on my dvd player. So I was most surprised and upset when after waiting excitedly for The Quest to arrive I went to play it and my dvd refused to play it, stating to check the region as it does not recognise it.
""The Quest-the pilot."" in the add states it is region free, so what happened?? I know the other Quest dvd ""The Longest Drive."" says it is not region free and that at the time was disappointing to me as I would have liked to have it also as The Quest was a favourite of mine. Will this eventually be region free and what can i do re my actually non region dvd??
I will say though that I did get to watch it on another dvd and it was great to see it again. Quality was pretty good. I would have given it five stars if it had been as advertised, but sadly it wasn't.",1332633600,3,894,3.9447513812154695
8481344,3,B005OK0YNE,"I know it says it's just the pilot, but I was hoping somehow they managed to sneak in some extra episodes of The Quest onto my DVD. I really liked this show in the 70s, but just watching the pilot doesn't really give you an opportunity to see the character development of the brothers. There were so many other big-name actors in the pilot (Brian Keith, Keenan Wynn), and they got toi much screen time. Too bad! More would have been better!!",1528848000,,441,4.390243902439025

8481352,3,B005OK0YNE,"The Quest was a television series in which a family of children had been separated by different tribes of Native Americans.  Two Persons/Morgan, Kurt Russell, had kept his ""whiteness"" and also learn the ways of the tribe, thus earning the respect and title of Two Persons.  Quentin (Tim Matheson [best known as Otter from Animal House]), the other brother, remained white and grew up to become a doctor.  Joining forces the two set out to find their missing sister.

This pilot showed good promise.  As a quest the brother were always going places and doing things.  They were never in the same place twice and would always come across new and interesting people.",1433894400,2,663,4.823008849557522
