7064352,5,B00UOB45SS,I've been waiting a long time to see this film and it did not disappoint; painfully beautiful.,1432944000,,94,4.588235294117647
7064353,5,B00UOB45SS,Comic and tragic in turns. A beautiful film,1432944000,,43,4.5
7064354,5,B00UOB45SS,"The story takes place in Timbuktu Mali which is now ruled by Islamic fundamentalists. The movie is directed by Abderrahmane Sissako. The story has 4 main characters: Kidane (Ibrahim Ahmed) a cattle herder, Satima (Toulou Kiki) who his Kidane's wife, Toya (Layla Walet Mohammmed) his daughter, and Issan (Mehdi AG) a shepherd boy who is like their own son. They live outside of town in the dunes. You see beautiful shots of the landscape in the background with a gentle breeze blowing while they go about living their lives. They seem in harmony with each other, the land they live on, and their animals. Then you see vivid scenes of the brutality that is taking place in the not to distance town where people can't dance,  sing, or play soccer,  At the same time you feel this real sense of beauty and serenity in their landscape you also feel this real sense of fear and terror erupting in the town and you know it's only a matter of time before their destiny will change forever and they will be drawn into this conflict.  One day Satima is herding the cows along the river bank and one of the cows steps into the fisherman's net. The fisherman then proceeds to kill one of the cows.  Kidane confronts the fisherman about the incident and a fight breaks out and Kidane accidentally kills the fisherman. The film is skillfully directed on many levels. This is and exceptional moving film with beautiful cinematography. This French movie was nominated for best foreign film at the 2015 Oscars.",1430265600,12,1493,4.687022900763359
7064355,5,B00UOB45SS,"This is a beautiful and sad movie that juxtaposes human dignity, affection and bonds to the crazed indoctrination of religious fanatics who all too often use power as pretext for the satisfaction of worldly compulsions. Anyone who has visited the Sahara can recognize the magic sparseness of the desert landscape, the dense warren of streets between mud houses and the exuberant power of local traditions. The film shows how Arabs from the North, aided by renegade Tuaregs, have taken over the famed city and imposed their bronze age 'sharia' version of the Islamic code on the resistant Bambara population. It is not all black and white - some AQIM fighters are black, and the main protagonists - a small family composed of a young couple, their daughter and adopted son - are Tamashek-speaking Tuaregs. Apart from the steroid craziness of the Islamists, which has amazingly enough been superseded by ISIS in the Middle East, the movie has many deep messages about the power of culture, love and beauty, and especially, the hypnotic magic of Malian music which has endured over thousands of years and will survive the Islamist scourge as well. It moves slowly, with the story told by images and through emotion rather than words. A spectacular impactful film.",1430179200,33,1260,5.004761904761905
7064356,3,B00UOB45SS,"I just saw this movie at our local film festival.  Whereas I can't say I enjoyed it, I found it interesting, particularly the setting and the customs and laws of the people (assuming it was accurate).  The photography was excellent.  I found the ending puzzling, although in a movie like that it doesn't make any difference - it was probably just a mood piece.  If one is interested when the DVD comes out, I might recommend renting but not buying it.",1429488000,4,451,4.530864197530864
7064357,4,B00UOB45SS,"Finally, Timbuktu has a release date for DVD and Blu-ray. Still waiting for Manos Sucias.",1429488000,,89,5.0
7064358,4,B00UOB45SS,"Timbuktu (2014 release from Mauritania; 99 min.) brings the story (fictional, but influenced by real events) of how the Mali town copes with the liberation by Jihadis. As the movie opens, we see the Jihadis having a shooting practice by destroying the local wood statutes. The Jihadis issue all kinds of rules (smoking is forbidden! music is forbidden!), much to the irritation of the Mali population. We get to know one local family in particular, a husband and wife with their 12 yr. old daughter. They live a bit outside of the city center, going about their daily business as best as possible. Then one day, one of the husbands cow accidentally destroys the fishing nets of the fisherman, who promptly kills the cow. The husband decides that he cannot tolerate this. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, it is a small miracle that a movie like Timbuktu could even have been made. Writer-director Abderrahmane Sissako shot the movie in Mauritania, which subs for Mali, but lets not kid ourselves. Mauritania is an Islamic Republic, so it was no easy feat to shoot there either. Second, Sissako demonstrates again and again how much the local population resends the jihadis for uprooting their lives. There are several scenes in which a local man pleads with the jihadis (where is forgiveness? where is leniency?), to no avail of course. Playing soccer will cost you 20 leashes. Playing music comes at 40 lashes. Being in the room with someone from the opposite sex is another 40 lashes, and on and on. The fact that the neither side can understand the other (they speak Tamasheq in Timbuktu, the juhadis mostly speak Arabian, some also speak French or English) only makes the entire situation even more absurd. Second, while there are some shocking scenes in the movie, overall this is not a violent or graphic film. Almost on the contrary, in that the movies editing and photography is done in such a way that it induces a false sense of peace and security. The photography in particular is pure eye-candy. Third, I have no idea where Sissako found these performers, but there are some wonderful performances, in particular from the wife and the 12 yr. old daughter. Bottom line: there is very good reason why this film is nominated for this year's Best Foreign Language Oscar, as it is a deeply moving film that will stay with you long after you have seen it.

The movie finally opened in February at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I went to see it right away. The matinee screening where I saw this at today was attended okay but not great, although Im hoping that the bitter cold weather was a factor in that. If you like a top-notch foreign film that provides a glimpse of what real life under jihad is like, you cannot go wrong with this. Timbuktu is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1428019200,64,2902,4.72189349112426
7064359,5,B00UOB45SS,"It was sad, but really beautiful at the same time. I've never had an interest in this part of the world, but watching this moved me so much. I've never even written a review for anything on Amazon but I had to say how great this was.",1498608000,2,233,3.978723404255319

7064361,3,B00UOB45SS,Good cinematography.  But plodding and slow.  I felt that I could just turn on the news on any given day to see this history repeating itself in different parts of the world.  Not my idea of entertainment.,1497052800,,205,4.486486486486487
7064362,5,B00UOB45SS,"Theres a lot of restraint and subtlety in director Abderrahmane Sissakos tragic delineation of what its like to live under an ISIS takeover of a Muslim community. And theres a beautiful artistry in the way he shows the barbarism of Sharia law so horrifically played out while the subjugation of women is made clear. (Actually the women in the movie stand strong against the subjugation.) Thus the evil of the jihadists (ISIS is never named but a black flag is flown) is contrasted with the normal lives of Muslim people.

Sissako, who also wrote the script, is careful to make this distinctiona distinction that a good part of the world is currently working on. It is not Muslims who are bad; it is the extremists. Yet I could not help but think as I watched this with the incessant talk of God wills, etc., that maybe, just maybe, the tribalism of religion itself is at fault. How horrible it is to live with the constant thought and expression that it is all Gods doing (with a little help from the forces of evil), and that we are just pawns in some absurd game played by a nearly omnipotent power that can send you to heaven or hell based on the very behaviors built into your psyche.

Well, such would apply to most other religions as well I suppose. So an indictment of Islam is not appropriate. Nonetheless the intense religious climate of the movie was for me almost tyrannical. I felt so sad for all the poor ignorant people and again was reminded of the saying willful ignorance is the only sin and again told myself that the only way out of the morass of the Middle East is education leading to enlightenment.

The film is in Arabic, French and a bit of English with English subtitles. A lot of what is said is not translated into the subtitles, but little is lost in the comprehension. There are scenes of great beauty contrasted with ugly violence. Beautiful music is played and sung, and there is a soccer game played without a ball. Such is the absurdity of life under the jihadists, who are really just thugs using a distorted vision of Islam in order to justify their crimes.

7064363,5,B00UOB45SS,"Difficult move to review.  Sad, tragic, emotional.  Beautifully filmed. Left with more questions than answers, but I would recommend the film...to people that can handle it.",1495238400,2,173,5.615384615384615
7064364,5,B00UOB45SS,"This film, from famed director Sissako [Life on Earth, Bamako and more], not only deserved its Oscar nomination--it actually deserved to win!  Politically complex, this film dares to humanize every single character caught up in the 'situation' when a sahelian locale [presumably Timbuktu though it could not be filmed there] is very suddenly invaded by militant jihadists.  This film is astonishingly beautiful, politically daring, ultimately despairing.  I give it the highest rating possible.  Packed with lingering, beautifully composed, meaningfully subtle screen shots--so, if you only like quick jump cuts, this is not for you.  Subtitles in English.  Very worthwhile.",1492473600,2,674,5.757575757575758

7064376,5,B00UOB45SS,"A stunningly emotional film. Depicts the transition from a peaceful town to one ruled by fundamentalists armed with machine guns and Sharia law.  It takes place slowly enough, and the villagers take it in stride in the beginning, with their own religious leaders attempting to teach the fundamentalists to be more lenient, more forgiving, based on their understanding of Islam. But unfortunately, as with many religious texts, you can argue almost any position and find supportive passages, and the fundamentalists have the upper hand as they have anointed themselves as ""liberators"" of this town.  As the fundamentalists increase their strangle hold over the village, and the severity of the punishments they dole out, the village is ripped apart.

Beautifully filmed, and considering the subject matter, there is very little bloody violence.  But the emotional impact, as portrayed by an absolutely superb cast, and riveting story telling, is very powerful.",1477353600,9,959,5.416107382550336

I may be misremembering the DVD version because the ending that I remember was more positive than the one I watched almost 18 months later.  I love this movie.  Many reviewers have found it difficult to watch and it does have a few scenes of violence but I found it a beautiful film, both visually and in its morality and drama.  It even has some humorous scenes.  One of the things I really appreciated was the way the film portrayed the many different reactions of the people to the jihadis.  I have spent some time in the Sahara and the people I met there had just as wide a range of personalities as any where else in the world.  Timbuktu is full of wonderful scenes but one that stands out for me is the scene of the jihadis filming a young man who cannot get his scripted testimony right though he tries several times.  The scene ends with no real conclusion but it is perfect as it is.",1476921600,3,958,4.254143646408839

7064386,4,B00UOB45SS,I love the subtle approach to a intense cultural dissection. Timbuktu immerses the audience into the city itself as if you are a visitor to this ancient site. As a viewer you feel the unease cause by the extremist police that occupy the city. The characters are slowly built around this core concept of occupation but the director let's the cast show their character and perspective of the situation. I really enjoyed the breathtaking wide shots and natural sound that was captured. This movie provides an insight into the culture of Sub-Saharan Africa and a cultural clash between ancient Berber and Sharia law.,1474848000,,612,4.951456310679611
7064387,3,B00UOB45SS,I love Africa and volunteer at medical clinics in Central Africa.  It was heart breaking and all too real.

Surreal and challenging to watch, it becomes a film of quiet despair and madness. The Jihadist would be comic if the dire consequences of their perversion of Islam did not affect so negatively  the lives of those they seek to control. I was impressed by the assertiveness the director gave to some of the women of this film. Even though compromised by Sharia law in almost all aspects of their lives they managed to show a inner strength that would not be bowed. The film also manged to  make one feel the vastness of the desert as it enclosed and surrounded the cloistered and almost claustrophobic walls of Timbuktu. Your heart cannot help but be broken by the beautiful children of this film and their hopelessness in the face of religion gone mad.

7064523,4,B00UOB45SS,"The 2015 Academy Award nominated film ""Timbuktu"" is a very well made movie. It is not a perfect movie but watching this you will see why it deserved it Oscar nomination. It is a fictional story set in a real place with real situations. Timbuktu is a town in the African country of Mali. For years now it has faced being controlled by Muslim fundamentalists who have been dictating the peoples lives and making them to live under Islamic law that the fundamentalists have decided on. In the film ""Timbuktu"" the fundamentalists are called the Jihadists. They are Arabs who have come from the north from Libya to spread their form of religious beliefs onto the people in the southern countries like Mali.

The Jihadists in this film set down laws almost on a daily basis like no smoking, no playing football (soccer as we call it here in the U.S.). Women must wear socks and gloves. No woman can be alone with a man unless he is a family member. No singing is allowed either, not even in your own home. Their people are constantly walking through the streets looking for anyone breaking any of these laws. And the punishment can be brutal from lashings to death by stoning. Meanwhile you see the people living under these Jihadists who calmly and with dignity try to resist the rules being set down. One man who lives in the town, I am not sure if he is the local religious leader or not, tries to talk reason and some sense with the leader of the Jihadists. He even has some effect to a degree in talking with them but not a lot. The story is about how the Jihadists control everything in the town and looks at a family who lives outside of town and therefore not under the control of the Jihadists. The father is a cattle herder who lives with his wife, daughter and an orphaned boy who looks after the herd. They live their lives freely and without care of the Jihadists since they do not live within the town limits of Timbuktu. But all that will change after the prized cow of the herd is killed by the local fisherman when the cow accidentally damages the fishing nets of the fisherman. When the father goes to confront the fisherman he takes a gun with him but with no intent of using it or harming anyone. The encounter turns deadly and life for the family is going to change for the worse.

As for the movie itself it is a bit slow paced I find and for me at times a little hard to follow. Still I did find myself captivated by the characters and moments in this movie that will stay with you long after ""Timbuktu"" is over. One thing that strikes me is the irrational behavior of the Jihadists. The movie doesn't show them as evil bloodthirsty murderers but rather as hypocritical thugs. They are in control because they have the guns which gives them the power to dictate the rules. Yet as much as they try to enforce the rules on others the rules don't seem to apply to them. One memorable scene shows the Jihadist leader hiding behind a sand dune where you find him smoking a cigarette. Smoking is against the law but he is not following his own rules. When he goes back to the car his driver admonishes him because everyone around knows he smokes. The look on his face as he realizes his secret is known reminded me of a little boy who's caught with his hand in the cookie jar.

Some of the other scenes that had an impact with me included a woman who is sentenced with 40 lashes for singing in her own home. Even as she is being lashed she remains defiant. She starts singing along to the rhythm of the lashing itself. I found this the most powerful moment in the film. One other memorable point in the film after the Jihadist announce that playing football was no longer allowed the young men start playing a game of football without a ball. They are split up into teams of two and go through the motions of playing the game but with no ball. It reminded me of stories I heard back in the days of the old Negro Baseball League when occasionally some of the players before the game would entertain the people in the stands playing something they called shadowball. They would go through the motions of acting like they were throwing around a baseball. They really were not but they were so good at it and quick it would fool the people in the stands into thinking they really were throwing around a ball. The young men in this scene are so good at going through the motions of a football game you really think there is a ball involved. As soon as some of the local Jihadists would show up the young men stop what they are doing and pretend they are doing calisthenics instead. As soon as the Jihadists move on the ""game"" resumes.

Altogether this is a pretty good movie with a good story behind it. Yes it is a foreign movie with subtitles. Don't let that stop you from watching this. This is too good a film to ignore just because you have to ""read"" it. I do recommend this movie to everyone to see.",1450051200,,4911,4.358078602620087

From the opening scenes of destruction of ancient artifacts to the end, this movie brings home what it means to have a group of well-armed, power-mad men decide how a people should live and showcases small acts of every day defiance. The scene of young boys playing a game of soccer without a ball because the jihadists have declared football illegal was amazingly well done.

This is a story-line from a hard region that is largely unknown to American viewers: The pastoral - rural village desert setting is being interrupted by imposed Islamic ordinances that are neither understood nor practical to its citizens. Some embrace the new behavior  for their advantage while others fear or disdain it; however, the instability this action creates is further heightened by enforcement partiality combined with individual misunderstanding, prejudice, and greed. No doubt some elements of this film are cultural and hard for the westerner to interpret, but there seems to be nothing hopeful or uplifting contained herein. So why watch it? Despite being emotionally exhausting, it demands compassion for the ""small players of daily life"" who have little control against statute and state.

As news of this massive exodus, and daily accounts of the terror and atrocities confound our comprehension, this film offers glimpses and insights into how beautiful ordinary life was in a North African desert town, and the repressive destruction that is upending life - mostly for the people who live there, but with far-reaching consequences for the whole world.",1444867200,,894,5.047297297297297

The Jihadist are striped bare of their terrorist facades to show them as men who lost their way in radical mission and now act with baffled uncertainty and ignorant pride. I particularly loved the scene of the Black Frenchmen who was trying to give a filmed testimony on why he  joined the terroist group. He, however,failed to do it with any conviction. After many takes, it became painfully obvious that he may have regretted his decision to leave home in the first place. The other extremists in the film lived hypocritical lives of enaging in ritual dances, smoking and discussing soccer, which were all outlawed under their extremist code.

The filmmakers do not bombarde the film with graphic scenes to reveal the horror of a terrorist take over or draw sympathy for the victims; rather, they focused on the characters and their own individual stories. They also showed the gradualness of how their simple lives  and ancient dwellings were changed through radicals who used religion as an excuse to gain power and satisfy their own insecurities.

I wanted to learn more about the historical context of the numerous subplots between the Malian characters that seemed to drive the film more than the main storyline about the Muslim jihadists, which seemed more and more like a ploy as the film went on.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, I just think I was drawn to the locals more as protagonists because of my clear sense that the jihadists here, and in reality, did a clearly bad thing.  As such, I wanted to know that the fisherman was Malinke and the herdsman Tuareg so I could contextualize their disagreement just a bit. Sissako actually used non-contexuality as a strength and I appreciate that fully.

no singing, humming, listening to music, no SPEAKING unless with permission,
forced marriage, NO RESPECT, NO NOTHING.......You get buried in the dirt up to
your neck and stoned to death, both men and women even if you are accused of
adultary, or infraction of the rules......the whole little village was ruled by ISIS, armed
guards 24 hours a day.....The film-maker wanted the world to know what these
simple people living there must endure.  Very well-done movie.  I liked it a lot.

Pros: Some lovely images. Glimpses of life under the fundamentalists are short and illuminating, from playing ball-less football to forced marriage.

Boring at many points (e.g. ""Don't you just love this shot of people walking? Let me linger on this moment."").

spoilers:

7064954,4,B00UOB45SS,"This film tackles the issue of jihad and how Muslims are treated by fellow Muslims just because they have guns and power. The story is told by using a farmer called Kidane (Ibrahim Ahmed) he lives in the dunes with his wife, daughter and their young herdsman.

The Jihadists (we are never told what group they are) rule the town with an iron fist. They announce new decrees by loud hailer - such as women must wear socks in public. They also steal a leaf from Oliver Cromwell - when he was Lord Protector - and ban music, dancing, and anything remotely designed to be fun - seeing all as vanity.

They have a Sharia court that pass down sentences that seem arbitrary beyond cruel and it is not long before Kidane and his family come under their thrall.

Now this is one of those films that seems at times to be bland in the mundanity of recording everyday life; however, the fact that life can be this hard, unfair and downright miserable is the story and to say it is powerful is a massive understatement. It is one of those films where you just watch and absorb it all.

7064997,5,B00UOB45SS,"Given the recent events in the Middle East, with the rise of militant Jihadism, this film (a nominee for the Foreign Language Oscar) is quite timely. It tells the story of the occupation of the famous North African city of Timbuktu by a Jihadist group in 2012. The militants are cruel, ignorant and narrow minded but are also something of a bumbling crowd. They ban all sorts of things like music, playing soccer, smoking cigarettes, not wearing socks or women selling fish without wearing gloves, promising whiplashes or worse for those who disobey these rules. They are also hypocrites since they themselves smoke when no one sees them or comment on European football teams. The inhabitants of the city are afraid but on occasions some of them, like the local imam, talk back to the militants accusing them of distorting Islam (would they do so in real life?). The central story (there are many peripheral ones) has a cattle herder in the area got in the eyes of the Jihadists when he ends up killing a fisherman as a local dispute gets out of hand.

The beautiful photography is a major plus. The exotic locations (at least for those who have never been there) also adds interest to the film. Set in Mali, produced by French investors, but filmed in Mauritania by Mauritanian born, Russian educated Abderrahmane Sissako. In Arabic and other languages of the area (like Bambara).",1441756800,3,1381,4.802521008403361

I can only give it 4 stars because I don't celebrate the topic and just can't say 'I LOVE IT' to such a dark movie.  Also, it's hard to summarize what I just watched.  In fact, it is heartbreaking even thinking about the content.  It's been years since I viewed a movie that brought me to such a deep place of sorrow, especially for the children who casualties in many of these conflicts.  I walk away reminded that selfish ambition carried out in the name of any institution (albeit political, religious, ideological, etc...) is a horrible reality in the world.  Human depravity is captured by the director, as is the intrinsic human spirit that deeply longs (and sometimes succeeds) to rise above some of the worst of conditions.  Watching scene after scene only drove my convictions deeper that we need a Redeemer to stand between these bitter and cancerous conflicts.  I believe that can be found in a man who died for all reckless and pointless acts of human depravity and in His sacrifice, in some strange, mysterious, beautiful way we can find a hope that is lasting and truly beautiful.  I believe Christ did that and provides this hope.",1441670400,,1252,4.732718894009216

Very moving, very sad, and very topical since it's currently happening in many other places in the Middle East and the African continent where people are being subjected to armed religious persecution and tyranny, and often must flee their homelands. The film doesn't demonize the fundamentalists but shows them as poorly educated and very misguided men who firmly believe they're doing the right things. It shows the creeping and sometimes sudden devastation they bring to simple villagers and nomadic groups who are faced with punishment or death if they refuse to obey the new rules.

Timbuktu is an ancient and mythical city of sub Saharan Africa, located to the North East of Mali, a few kilometers north of the famous Niger River that runs through Bamako, the capital city. Timbuktu used to attract many tourists until not long ago looking to see its fascinating mud buildings and rich culture,  including a famous library that housed an invaluable collection of more than 20,000 manuscripts covering centuries of Mali's history. Timbuktu is a UNESCO heritage site. In March 2013, following a coup d'etat in Bamako and a revolt that started in the north, changed things forever for Timbuktu inhabitants. Several Touareg tribes in permanent conflict with Bamako, seized the opportunity and formed a military alliance with all kinds of Al-Qaeda affiliates and muslim fundamentalists and launched a blitzkrieg than in a few days cut the country by half and took over Northern Mali. Timbuktu was taken by the militants whom imposed Sharia law. The film, of impeccable photography and music, is a story about ignorant and fanatical religious groups that impose their views using violence  and destroying the social fabric of society with a tragic end.",1441324800,10,1271,5.1352657004830915

I watched this and felt I learned about the Malians' feelings towards Jihadist invaders who use force to create change. The savagery of the punishments for minor transgressions of newly instituted laws is beyond me. The stoning and subsequent killing sequence of 2 men as punishment was revealing. The lashing punishment of a woman for singing in her own home and together with friends was another eye opening scene. You see children playing soccer without a ball because that is no longer allowed is not only funny but tragic. Why American teens (boys and girls) want to leave the US to ""help"" others to change the lives of a peaceful people is beyond me.

No wonder Americans are hated.  This movie is about life and the painful reality that we have been protected from for a very long time.  You think people here have it hard?  Well think again.

  Incredibly, while surrounded by the horror and unspeakable brutality of ISIS, they choose to focus on the accidental killing of one tribesman by another.  Apparently the irony of this is lost on the filmmakers.  The man who does the killing is the only person we really get to know, coming to care for his daughter and wife (the strongest character in the film).  On top of this they throw into the mix a strangely laconic group of ISIS members, who none-the-less dutifully get around to killing their share of the townspeople for singing and playing music.

7065322,5,B00UOB45SS,"Orthodox fundamentalism, whether its Judaism, Christianity or Islam, comes down to a self selected few using the arrogance of power (usually with guns) to destroy, humiliate, plunder, rape and all with justification from, again, self-selected, ambiguous translations of what someone, thousands of years ago, said was conveyed by their God. In the film they are described as: ""Fundamentalists are ordinary people who have lost their humanity.""

In Timbuktu, Mali we have such a group, Ansar Dine, destroying a culture and history that goes back a thousand years and more. Similar to what the Taliban did in Afghanistan with the giant statues of Buddha, we have these mostly foreign fighters out to erase the past and hold hostage the present (that's why they needed guns). And, just like the Boko Haram, they took young females against their will as reward brides for fellow fighters, with justification from a Qur'an passage. Football/soccer along with music are banned, yet in a defiance-of-spirit the youth play imaginary soccer (no ball) and a woman sings while being beaten.

In the end we see the future; frightened children running, lost, across a desert landscape being chased by extremists, just as these same extremists earlier chased down a frightened gazelle.

A similar film on fundamentalism, ""God Loves Uganda"", had these quotes: ""When the righteous rule the people rejoice."" and ""The reward of sin is death, the Bible says.""",1436054400,8,1439,5.220779220779221

7065327,4,B00UOB45SS,"Timbuktu is a film about hypocrisy, intolerance, survival under dire circumstances, and brutality. Director Abderrahmane Sissako blends these elements with the family of goat and cattle herders, local musicians, fishermen, and imams. These individuals are all suddenly forced to obey Shariah laws that prohibit music, the playing of football, sitting in front of ones home, or being in a room with anyone of the opposite sex (other than family). There is also a strict dress code imposed.

Initially immune to these stringent laws are Kidane, Satima and their daughter, Toya. Because they live in a tent in the desert far from the city of the films title, they go on with their lives harmoniously. The latest topic of family discussion involves whether Kidane will give the young man who tends his herd a cow of his own. This relatively peaceful, gentle look at day-to-day family life contrasts dramatically with the harsh laws that are instituted in the name of religion. The mission to suppress the populace with these rules is an excuse for young men, armed with machine guns, to bully the townsfolk and use violence to keep them in line. After a tragic accident, Kidane and family find themselves in direct conflict with the fundamentalists.

Director Sissako presents a vivid portrait of the cruelty and absurdity of fundamentalist regimes. Many of the laws they set down are broken by the jihadists themselves in the name of expedience. Power is the drug that fuels these men who, in another setting, would be simple thugs. The movie is especially effective in showing how the lives of decent people can be disrupted by fascism in the guise of religion.

The sole Blu-ray feature is an interview with the director. The film is in French, Arabic, and English, with English subtitles.",1434844800,20,1788,4.993288590604027

8707731,5,B00UOB45SS,"I thought this was a very good movie which addresses some of the central conflicts of our time. In this movie, it is Muslim v. Muslim, arguing about the true tenets of their faith. Like most religions, those arguments and conflicts have been on-going since the inception of their faith(s!). The movie is set in the desert surrounding Timbuktu, Mali. Probably for the film crews security, most of it was filmed in Mauritania (itself a bit iffy, based on news reports). I detected at least four languages in the movie, with the prime one being Arabic, followed by one or more tribal languages, then French, then a few words of English. Thank Allah for sub-titles. And the film itself is produced by a French company.

In essence, the movie is about power and the political uses of religious tenets to seize and maintain that power. The dry husk of all too many religions is a set of fetishes that set true believers apart from others: the number of fingers to use when crossing oneself; the days of the week and year that have special significance, the clothing that is considered appropriate under varying circumstances, the substances that are forbidden, et al.  The list can be long.

Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun, is a famous dictum of Chairman Mao. The Islamic religious police have come to this remote area of Mali. They all carry their AK-47s, the better to enforce their suggestions on how one might improve ones life: no music, no cigarettes, no football (!) even, and those women must become more decent, by wearing gloves and socks in the market. Not much joy is permitted either. There are several scenes showing the interactions of the religious police and the villagers as the former try to impose their will.

The central characters are Bedouin, living in their black goat-hair tents, as they have since time immemorial. There is Kidane, his wife Satima, and their daughter Toya. The guitar in the background in the tent is a fitting symbol that demonstrates that they might not adhere to the latest party line on decorum and appropriate behavior. Alas, for Kidane, he makes a tragic mistake, not much different than what seems to occur in Albuquerque, New Mexico on a daily basis: he takes a gun to a dispute with another man.

I lived in Saudi Arabia for two decades. The religious police were an element of that existence, fortunately for me a very minor one. Their power waxed and waned depending on political considerations. Fortunately none carried AK-47s. In the late 70s, they were just a handful of old men who made sure the shops closed on time for saleh, (prayers). There were a few high-water marks as they fought to keep out the modern world (but they never took on those fast-food restaurants, which might have been a worthwhile goal!) And I was once arrested and detained by them (fortunately for only half an hour) shortly before my departure in 2003. As a non-Muslim, I was always a sideshow for these folks. The core fight is always: Muslim v. Muslim. Based on my experiences, but even more so, my conversations with other Saudis, I found numerous vignettes in the movie, by the director, Sissako, right on the money.

What is jihad, for example? There is a scene in which the boys with the AK-47s invade the local mosque. The Imam rebukes them for bringing weapons to a place of worship, and explains that jihad is all about an internal struggle whose objective is self-improvement. In the marketplace, a woman fights back, telling the religious police that they should not be looking at her face. Likewise, the religious police should not be interacting with women that they are not related to  it is a central tenet of their beliefs  yet they do! There is a funny scene of the kids playing football without the football. There is the sheer hypocrisy of one of the leaders of the religious police telling people they cannot smoke, yet he does, and his driver calls his hand on it: everyone knows you smoke! The most telling scene is how these morality folks use their rules to procure women for themselves  something my Saudi friends were most concerned about!

Great photography, and a well-thought out storyline. I found only a couple of seeming inconsistencies. In Saudi Arabia, when they were first introduced, the religious police had an obsession with satellite dishes, yet in the movie, they seemed to be OK. And would Bedu have cell phone reception at their encampment? Despite these two quibbles, an excellent movie, that brought back some memories, and underscored the realization that much of the Sahel of Africa is now a no-go zone. 5-stars.",1504656000,,4606,4.767879548306148

8707733,5,B00UOB45SS,"It took me three days to watch this movie because of the intense scenes. It profiles a community in Timbuktu (this was filmed in Mauritania) and what happens to the villagers when jihadists and Islamic Police take over and demand of its citizens to immediately follow new rules: no more playing soccer, no more singing and playing music, and women must stay covered and wear gloves. Not all follow the rules and some pay the price for their refusal to cower in front of these extremists.  The scenes quietly drag on at times but the mood never strays from somber .

The primary focus is on cattle herder Kidane (Ibrahim Ahmed dit Pino), his wife Satima (Toulou Kiki) and their daughter Toya (Layla Walet Mohammed).  Satima is unhappy that all her women friends have left, but Kidane assures her to have patience as the situation will not be bad forever.  There are sweeping scenes of wind-blown dunes while Satima and Toya are together. They live outside of town, but not far enough from the Islamic Police who come to harass them.  Satima refuses to cover her hair.

What Abderrahmane Sissako so beautifully shows is the hypocrisy of the extremists.  The Islamic Police demand no smoking, yet one of the guys smokes and is protected by the other police.  Another guy can't even drive a stick shift and has to be taught. The police, whose uniforms resemble those of ISIS, walk armed through town, on rooftops and back alleys looking for any violations.  These villagers are devout Muslims who pray and the local iman tells the jihadists not to enter the mosque with weapons (and they comply!).  The extremists want to wipe out all the culture these villagers have known.  There are a few scenes that just scream of injustice, yet the people accept their fate.

Several languages are in this movie: French, Arabic and some tribal dialect.  A few short scenes are in English.

This is a haunting film that will linger in my head for a while.",1503187200,,1939,4.6982248520710055

8707735,5,B00UOB45SS,"Excellent movie, but not for the faint of heart.  It gives you a chance to see the clash of cultures and intolerance that happens when ISIS is more than a far away enemy.  You see how their beliefs are forced onto a population who share the same God but look at him differently.  The film is very matter of fact - no exaggerations, no propaganda and some how that wears you down more surely than anything else would.",1502755200,,416,4.3076923076923075
