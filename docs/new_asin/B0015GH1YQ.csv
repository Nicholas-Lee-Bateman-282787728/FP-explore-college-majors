8258354,4,B0015GH1YQ,This is a good film!  I love the portrayal of all the young men working together so well.  I enjoyed the explainations that were given for what they were doing.  As a complete novice I wish there were more explanation but I did find the video instruction to be helpful and encouraging enough to get out there and try building.  I would love to show this to young men to encourage them to make things with their hands. (I have only daughters)  Good instruction for novice folks!  Thank you Mr. Valenti!,1325289600,,501,4.450549450549451
8258355,5,B0015GH1YQ,"This film shows the steps necessary to build a tree-fort from absolutely nothing to completion.  While my sons are interested in having a tree-fort, they didn't necessarily understand the steps to undergo the effort.  Now they do!
The boys shown working with real tools, under direction of an obviously skilled teen, to produce an amazing fort!  We watched the whole thing to gain a basic understanding of the project - now my sons and I are working on our own project with a much clearer mindset.  We will watch the section of video that relates to what we'll build that day then go outside to do it!
A very well produced professional video geared to both kids and adults.",1266105600,2,673,4.630252100840337
