8735364,5,B0161H1MSE,I've yet to delve into the special features but the full length Philly set is worth it alone! As already stated it sounds and looks absolutely amazing. I also have really high standards with concert blu-rays because they can really prove why HD is such a necessity. Also for fans of the band it's absolutely worth it. The art has a beautiful glossy finish and it has art and band pics wrapping all around. It's a steal at the current price. My only gripe is that it's 3 blu Rays in a cardboard CD case. However if your not that anal retentive then you won't be bothered.,1452038400,,570,4.336448598130841
8735365,5,B0161H1MSE,"I can't speak to the bonus disks/features, but I can say that this is the best sounding live concert I have ever seen on Blu-ray. Every instrument is crisp, sharp, and most importantly not jumbled into a bass-heavy mush like so many live tapings can become. The musicianship demonstrated live by this band is something to behold and I find the replay value VERY high, due mainly to the awe that the musicianship inspires. My one criticism is that I would have loved to have seen the crowd and the chaos that takes place interspersed throughout the concert film.

The song ""All We Love We Leave Behind"" has one of the greatest riffs of all time and watching it ""live"" is AWESOME. I would recommend this even for the less-than-hardcore (no pun intended) Converge fan or if you'd like to relive the energy and chaos that a Converge set brings from the safety of home.",1450483200,2,864,4.574193548387097
8735366,5,B0161H1MSE,"The listing states that the Blu-ray is 90 minutes, but actually the main feature is 1 hour 12 minutes. HOWEVER, there are two other Blu-ray discs in this package (a total of 3 Blu-ray discs). Disc 2 runs 8 hours 16 minutes, and disc 3 runs 7 hours 27 minutes. So, the actual running time is somewhere around 16 hours. If you are even a casual Converge fan, buying this is a no-brainer: it is an awesome deal!",1450396800,2,408,4.243589743589744
