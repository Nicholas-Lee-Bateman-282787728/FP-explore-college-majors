5072968,5,B007ATHNF4,"Excellent movie.  A little girl dies from unknown heart condition.  Father, policeman, suggests mother do some volunteer work to help herself mentally.  Her dead daughter's spirit with rose petal leads her to a little girl living on street who had witnessed her mother being shot to death. This little girl is adopted by them. Film deals with crime, kidnapping of child, etc so there is plenty of story.  It is a movie that can be watched by entire family. It would help to have Kleenex nearby as it is very emotional.",1404345600,6,518,4.65934065934066
5072969,5,B007ATHNF4,I read about it in a catalog and I had to order it to watch sounded like a great movie so will let you know how it turns out . Sounds sad and great at the same time.,1392508800,2,165,3.3684210526315788
5072970,5,B007ATHNF4,"I bought this movie because I really loved Kari Hawker in Christmas Angel. Kari seems to have the ability to act without effort and in my opinion was perfect for the role. Elizabeth's Gift is a very touching movie about a couple that lost their child due to a heart condition they were unaware their daughter had. The story tells the story of the parents plight to regain their happiness through love and a miracle, Elizabeth's Gift to them. I would recommend to anyone that loves movies that touch their hearts and has a real meaning in life. Since I loved Kari's performance in Christmas Angle and the price was right for this movie, I had no choice but to buy it. Glad I did.",1389571200,14,678,4.432

5072973,3,B007ATHNF4,"I hate it when movie plots enhance the suspense through stupidity. This movie was guilty of that. The fact that it features a new age concept of a child coming back to Earth was a big turn off as well. The movie just seemed out of sync to me most of the way through. It has some moments of suspense but they felt awkward. Fake violence is really hard to make convincing. This movie failed at it. I loved the crazy guy who thought the mother was an angel sent from General Patton. And I loved her performance. But all in all, this was just an average movie for me.",1367712000,3,563,4.127272727272727

Acting was excellent making making all the characters very believable.  This is a five star plus movie for people who have a heart and wish the goodness of love, truth and the strength to withstand life's tragedies.  A warm thank you to the creators of this film. God bless you all.",1527897600,,446,4.740259740259741
8513538,3,B007ATHNF4,"Typical B-Rated movie. Not believable due to things like the little homeless girl calling her new parents mom and dad way too soon in the relationship or the fundraiser bringing in $100,000  when there are barely any participants at the event. Most of the acting was poor which made it difficult to get ""lost in the story.""  I do believe in angels and spirits, but the acting just kept reminding me that it wasn't real. Very distracting.",1520553600,,437,4.662337662337662

8513541,2,B007ATHNF4,"Elizabeth's Gift is a poorly made movie.  There are many holes in the filming.  Much of the acting is poor quality.  Unfortunately, this story could have been way better made into a film.  However, the film here was like a home movie or worse  and not a real movie.  Very poorly executed.  It is a heart warming show and very sad.  Not believable at all.  Parts are totally brutal and filled with hatred.  Not what we would consider a Christian or family movie.
  It is ok, but not recommended.  Did not like this movie.  Spend your two hours watching a better movie.  A TIME FOR HEAVEN is much better.",1512777600,,602,4.394495412844036
8513542,5,B007ATHNF4,"Obviously not a Hollywood type budget here and you can figure out the movie quickly how it is going to end but so what? still a great a movie, I put it on because I had to work late... Needed background Noise, The movie was good enough that kept me watching the entire time and did none of my work! ha!

Yep, I cried, So it did its job.

I wish I would have known more about the ""In Memory"" child's name. I google it and found not much so that was sad.",1509926400,,452,3.849462365591398
