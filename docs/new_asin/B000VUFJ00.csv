Watch it!!! Own it!!",1376697600,,108,4.45
2953582,5,B000VUFJ00,I DVR'd this off Showtime the other night. I had never heard of it but the desciption sounded interesting so I recorded it. I just finished watching it and I must say...THIS IS A GREAT THRILLER! I went in not expecting much and man was I amazed. Top notch all the way. Great story with lotsa twists. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. In fact I'm on Amazon now because I am buying it to add to my collection. Definantly worth checking out!!!,1263600000,3,442,4.211764705882353
2953583,4,B000VUFJ00,"This movie is a sleeper in my book. Only one of my NF friends had even seen or Q'ed this movie. This is a really well made and well acted movie. It isn't the most original movie, but it had so many twist and more tension than I've seen in a while. Marc Blucas' character is an arrogant wealthy literary agent who moved into an expensive penthouse. That's when several strange things begin to happen that throw him into a whirl wind of fear and confusion. As I said before, the tension was unreal at times, to the extent that friends watching it with me, all jumped few times! There are only a brief few moments that seemed to drag, but other than that, I found the movie to be very entertaining. B",1223078400,6,697,4.2481203007518795
2953584,4,B000VUFJ00,"I enjoyed this movie much more then I expected to. It was interesting watching the arrogent boorish David Lamont unravel as he's led through a maze that, at it's heart, is something he should be intimately familiar with. David is a literary agent for horror/suspense writers but when he's dumped into his very own mystery his own arrogance blinds him and allows him to be lead like a bull to the slaughter.  David is such a jerk that it makes it difficult to feel to badly for him even as his life begins to fall apart. Shiri Appleby is fabulous as his mistreated overlooked assistant Rebecca. It's a pleasure to see her in such a meaty role again.",1216425600,7,648,4.491525423728813
2953585,4,B000VUFJ00,"Marc Blucas does a good job portraying David Lamont---a very successful literary agent.  David is a guy who has reached extraordinary success and it HAS gone to his head.  He comes across pompous and intolerant of others, even betraying his own brother. He moves into a 11,000 sq. ft., three level, New York apartment (cha-ching).  Why?  To quote him, ""Because I CAN!""  The way he treats clients/staff, you know he's the kind of boss that would have workers poking tiny pins in a voodoo doll, during their lunch breaks.

His bad karma begins to catch up with him. Doesn't it always! Someone is stalking!  The stalking escalates into some bloody messes.  But, who and why?  As he becomes more and more obsessed, his narcissistic personality begins to take a hit.  He starts to lose his grip. After all, who would dare harass him.  They will have to pay for upsetting HIS apple-cart!  Just what will he be willing to do to preserve his extravagant sanctuary and his life?  WELL, when you take a trip to the farm, you'll find out. Ewwwww!

This was a low budget flick, absent of bells and whistles.  With that in mind, I think they did a good job.  However, the acting was below par, for all but Marc Blucas, and it was hard for him to try to carry the film by himself.  He deserves credit for the effort. In spite of the flaws, I found that the storyline held my attention throughout and the many plot twists kept me on my toes.  There were times that it was downright creepy, too, with a bit of a horror film, aspect.  Truth be told, I did not figure out the mystery ending, until we were upon it, either. I was convinced it was going in another direction.

So, if you're the type to enjoy a good little (suspense/horror/mystery),
B-movie, this is a worthwhile 98 minute distraction.  You might want to rent it first before adding it to your collection, though. I really enjoyed it, but seeing it once was enough for me.",1216425600,3,1919,4.488439306358382
2953586,3,B000VUFJ00,"""The Killing Floor"" does have a lot of the standard distractions/detractions of many modern films - such as an array of pointlessly antagonistic, cursing characters - a needy, steamy upstairs neighbor - and a complicated loft setting with something of the multilevel, industrial look of ""Boston Legal."" Nevertheless, it almost ends up being a classical Agatha Christie-style who-done-it at heart.

You might suspect a ""Mousetrap"" sort of twist at one minute. But no, wait - there are other suspect possibilities who qualify simply because they are the last people you'd ordinarily suspect. The only thing this plot lacks to be fully neo-Christie is a butler.

The acting tends to be a bit amateurish and the film in general has somewhat cheesy production values. But the guessing will probably keep you entertained for the length of the film.",1206144000,2,842,5.138686131386861
2953587,5,B000VUFJ00,"An enjoyable suspenseful movie. Absent of higher production values but for the plot involved, it was good enough. Plot twists that some you can see coming, others not. Acting above par in this one. Marc Blucas is superb as the lead whom you want to dislike. He does quality work in most of his roles from his time as Riley Finn in ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" thru ""Thr3e"" and this flick. Ably backed up by Shiri Appleby and in particular, Reiko Aylesworth. This is not a classic noir type of film but a nice way to pass an hour and a half.",1202515200,2,538,4.284313725490196

The Killing Floor scared the hell out of me but I scare easily so don't go by me I'm waiting for Killer Women to come through I want underground but he dies in season 1 so I put that on the back burner I'm waiting for irresistible blueberry farm I've never seen it but if he's in it I don't care I've also ordered summer catch, We Were Soldiers inflammable, Pleasantville so far I'm at the point of ordering 3 per month until I get to Jane Austen book club and then I'll have all of my Marc blucas movies I wish you would do something else the last thing you did was Operation Christmas in 2016 come on Marc get with the program. I fell in love with Marc Blucas when I saw him in first daughter with Katie Holmes oh my God he was so cute and Charming and sneaky he was an agent to the president her father I guess I was just so busy watching him I didn't pay too much attention to the movie so now when I want him I just fast forward to only his part . Oh my God but then again I used to be obsessed with Kevin Costner I bought all of his movies too and I don't watch any of them anymore so maybe this is another phase I'm going through geez he's six foot two eyes of blue and fine he is so cute he grew up nice.",1491350400,,1311,3.9138576779026217

But having said all of that, it was a relatively entertaining watching experience. Marc was very good as the egomaniacal lead who because he is rich and handsome cares nothing about anyone. he surrounds himself with only pretty people, then things happen, some guy claims marc is squatting in his apartment, a cop comes around and a mysterious woman comes around too. All kinds of bad things happen to him, but he is such a nasty guy...do we care? As I said I had this figured out in the first 20 minutes.",1448409600,,658,4.632478632478633
