5569424,5,B00BBAGF0W,"We LOVED everything about this documentary. Visually it is off the hook (that BTW means it was very, very good). Goddess was more interested in the plankton's which she said looks nothing like Plankton from Sponge Bob and she always wondered what one looked like.

Personally I loved the aerial views of some of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen.

This movie is not only stunning but a lesson in respecting the ocean, waters and sea life that inhabit it.

  BTW...Josh Duhamel is the narrator of the DVD/Blu-Ray not this chick! While she has a lovely voice, I was happy to hear Josh in this educational trip about the Ocean!

Goddess usually has an Earth Day party with her friends around this time of year but this year we will celebrate alone due to our schedules but will be handing this over to her teacher to view with the class when they celebrate Earth Day in school.  It is better than any documentary I watched in school and I think her class will love it!",1365465600,4,974,4.468926553672317

5569451,3,B00BBAGF0W,"An interesting movie with beautiful cinematography showing some amazing locations.  Does a good job of inspiring feeling for the delicate and exotic locales and helps the viewer understand the importance of protecting these places.  However, it spends too much time and too much negative energy on detailing everything that humans are doing wrong to spoil the planet.  It goes way beyond just telling you what some of the problems are and helping you to see solutions, and actually becomes quite depressing after awhile.  Doesn't feel like it offers much of a chance at redemption, but actually gives somewhat of a feeling of hopelessness.  Such a beautiful film could have done much to inspire hope and dedication had it not left my family feeling depressed.",1395100800,3,759,5.088709677419355

5569456,1,B00BBAGF0W,"It's true that the footage is visually stunning.  The camera work is fantastic, and the quality of the video is top of the line.  But this is not a documentary about the great things you'll see diving a reef.  Perhaps that was my mistake in thinking that's what I was buying.
This is a propaganda-laden attack against commercial fishing, and industrial manufacturing.  It rails against the shipping industry lambasting everyone who uses the ocean as a predatory consumer creating an irreversible carbon footprint that will bring about the destruction of the earth in the next few years.
That's not what I wanted to buy, I wanted to see reef fish and sharks eating things.  Just know what you're getting...",1381536000,12,705,4.890756302521009

Kids terribly upset and there was NO way to know in advance that what you are getting is an activist who wants to depress/scare the hell out of you into being politically active to save the ocean. I agree, I just think they can't get anyone to watch if they are honest about what it is so its a bait and switch. Not impressed and not going to enjoy having to deal with this with my children who basically think the world is going to end now because we are killing the ocean.  Yes, maybe it will.

Did I miss something? Because I did not get that Impression at all. I think some people are so touchy just because they showed a statue of jesus in Rio De Jenaro.

5569465,5,B00BBAGF0W,"I was shocked at some of the low scores this film was getting here, so I felt compelled to voice my opinion and debate some of the complaints I'd read:

Some people felt this film was too depressing or that the science was too basic, but Planet Ocean was crafted to define and showcase the severity of our marine situation. If you viewed the bonus, making-of features, the director explained that he is trying to boost awareness, and educate people from around the world. Many of whom, haven't heard the concerns of climate control or pollution before, like we have. Many people around just don't realize what is at stake. The footage is beautiful and sometimes terrifying, but that keeps even the least scientific-minded among us from changing the channel. This wasn't meant to be ""Blue Planet II.""

A few complained about that jab on religion, spoken in the film's closing. It is not meant to be offensive or to convert you to a different spiritual view, except to point out that the damage we have been doing to the oceans cannot be averted by prayer. We have to take drastic effort as a species, to keep our world running smoothly. It's the only way we will be able to enjoy the world we love for generations to come. One scary issue is that much of the world's population believes our world is going to end anyway, so why should we concern ourselves? Because WE caused the situation- not the Devil. WE have to become the stewards of nature, because God is NOT going to do it for us, like some mother who still folds her children's laundry even though they are grown-up enough to do it themselves.

I love documentaries like this and HOME, which I also consider 5 stars. I don't find these films depressing, ultimately. The point is that we are getting the word out finally. By all means, ask questions- have an argument! Just don't ignore it, or stick your head in the sand!

Some people found the film to be too political, but let me ask you this... Do you think it is wrong that Japan still harpoons whales? Do you think it was brilliant that America and other countries agreed to outlaw the practice of whaling? We had almost wiped out every species of whale on the planet, from all oceans, permanently. But we recognized that we'd gone too far, and so we took action. This was despite the fact that many people counted whaling as their livelihood.

Now we've gone too far once again- with pollution and over-fishing! Whales weren't saved by God or by Americans joining in some kind of group hug. We educated ourselves, we debated with each other, and we made hard choices. I believe in progress, and we can CERTAINLY take better care of our Oceans than we have been.",1369699200,26,2675,4.553014553014553
5569466,4,B00BBAGF0W,"A visually stunning look at the oceans, the interconnected way life is bound to it, and the profound threats posed towards it. The camera work may be spectacular, but the concerns facing the future are disturbing, and the film doesn't shy away from that. Given the subject matter, the documentary might well have been longer... and I found that the narrator, actor Josh Duhamel, barely sounds like himself, oddly enough.",1369699200,3,420,5.014285714285714
5569467,5,B00BBAGF0W,"I loved this movie because It taught me several things about the ocean that I didn't know. How most of blue tuna are almost gone, globel warming is a real issue, and even the coral reefs are starting to die. I also loved the tips on how help.

5569471,1,B00BBAGF0W,"The documentary as a whole was interesting. Many images were as beautiful as they were depressing. My question is why does every ""movie"" about animals / earth need to be filled with self hate and the dissimulation of human life? Is this really a family film about animals or a film designed to justify propaganda. The film for me, ending on a rather anti-religious surrmount, circulating around an image of Jesus proposing that we as a human community not trust in him ( Jesus ), religion, or ""the promises of heaven"" to save us, but our own intelligence. Yes we all have a part to clean up the environment, but how does belief in God interfere? Doesn't this show a slanted, misguided and discriminating view? Doesn't it have a negative effect on people rather then promoting a positive reaction in families watching this show? And if that's the case was the video really designed to promote earth saving ideas or to slam religion?",1367539200,12,931,4.717791411042945
5569472,4,B00BBAGF0W,"""Planet Ocean"" is a documentary that is simultaneously stunningly beautiful and horribly ugly, incredibly informative and queasily disturbing. It is not fluffy Hollywood fare with a contrived happy ending, but rather a true story with an as-yet unfinished end.

I bought ""Planet Ocean"" thinking it was a wildlife documentary about the ocean, and that certainly is a part of what this film is about. But the true thrust of the documentary is to point out with gut-wrenching clarity the ongoing destruction we humans have caused to the ocean and everything that lives in it.

We have taken something that gave birth to all life on the planet and that still sustains all life on the planet (much of the oxygen we breathe comes from ocean plankton), and we have fouled it with our trash, poisoned it with our chemicals, and wiped out thousands of species of life that once lived in it.

By the end of this film the viewer will have had both a taste of the extraordinary beauty to be found in the ocean, and the extraordinary ugliness of what we humans have already done to the ocean and the entire planet it swaddles in its blue-green life-giving warmth.

It is not a story with a happy ending, nor is the eventual outcome likely to be a pleasant one, barring a miracle of sudden planet-wide awareness and cooperation. But if you want to be informed, to learn about this miraculous body of water that allowed life to arise and survive on this planet, and also to learn about the danger all life on earth (including humankind) is currently facing because of the way we have treated the ocean, then this film is well worth watching.

I would not recommend this film be shown to young children. The scenes of wholesale destruction of the environment and dead birds cruelly killed by ocean pollution are disturbing even for adults, and are certainly too much for any sensitive child to be exposed to.

I would have given this film five stars except for the luridly excessive color through much of the film. It seems the film has been through some sort of digital ""enhancement"" process that turns up all the colours to eleven, rendering them unnaturally vivid like the photos in glossy magazines today. This seems singularly inappropriate for a film about nature.

5569474,5,B00BBAGF0W,"I'm sure some of my regular readers are scratching their heads right now, wondering why in the world I'm reviewing a documentary about the ocean.  I mean, my blog is a genre-focused site, so this is a bit out of the norm.  Let's just say that this film is so good  and the message so pertinent that I simply had to share it.  PLANET OCEAN is an excellent documentary, and I recommend giving it a look.

I love all things that have to deal with the ocean, which is one of the reasons I wanted to review PLANET OCEAN so much.  I am particularly fond of being underwater as well, so documentaries on undersea life are sort of a guilty pleasure for me.  If you follow my blog, you know that my primary focuses are horror, sci-fi, and fantasy...but, my guilty pleasure sometimes takes precedence and, well, here we are.

The fine folks at Universal were kind enough to send me a Blu-ray version of this film as well, so I had the privilege of seeing it in HD.  If you want a good way to test your television's limits, this is the perfect way to do so.  The undersea shots look explosive on-screen as the filmmakers draw out every ounce of color found in nature.

But this is not just a film about undersea life.  PLANET OCEAN is a high-profile look at how vital our world's oceans are to the entire ecosystem.  Our lives, as well as those of every species on the planet, are affected in one way or the other by the seas, a fact that is sometimes overlooked during our daily lives.  This film highlights those aspects and introduces new ones that you may or may not have thought about.

The film is narrated by Josh Duhamel, and I have to admit that he does a great job.  I enjoy his work on-screen, so hearing him was almost as fun as watching him.  But it's not his voice that the audience should be listening to...it's his message.  It is a poignant and powerful statement about how we rely on the ocean and vice-versa.  The message is not preachy, though; it is laid out in simple matter-of-fact statements and thus lets the viewer come to his or her own conclusions.

Chocked full of stunning imagery and deep insights, PLANET OCEAN is a beautiful film that the whole family will enjoy.  It is available now, so be sure and pick it up for sure.",1366761600,12,2243,4.34375
