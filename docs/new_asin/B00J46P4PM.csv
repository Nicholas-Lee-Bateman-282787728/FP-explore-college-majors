8647908,5,B00J46P4PM,"One of my favorite films and so glad I was finally able to get it on Blu-Ray by buying the multi-region Dutch version. Very odd to me why it was not released separately for region 1 on Blu-ray as far as I've ever been able to find, but this disc plays fine in region 1 and on your remote you can simply turn off the Dutch subtitles. Rachel Weisz does a great portrayal as do the other lead actors. Definitely a film to see and ponder with all the religious strife in the daily news.",1440115200,6,482,4.08421052631579

8647911,4,B00J46P4PM,"Set in the 4th century A.D. in Alexandria, ""Agora"" follows the fall of the Pagans as the newly empowered and growing Christian movement took over. On a political and historical level the film works very well, with interesting swipes at the destructive power of religious fanaticism (Pagans, Jews and Christians all have some very bad moments here).  There are obvious parallels to today, when extremists of various faiths still make some of the same kind of violent attacks on those they see as wrong or other, as well as dis-empowering women, denying science and distorting scriptures to justify violence or oppression.

On a human level the film is a bit more rocky. The story centers on Hypatia, a female teacher, philosopher and scientist who - at least at the start of the film -  has attained the same level of respect as a great male thinker - something that seems very rare in the world of the film. She is outspoken in preaching brotherhood, and always unbowed in her pursuit of knowledge.

Rachel Weisz does very good work in the role, but I wish the film hadn't made her so glamorous in look and feel, which seems like a Hollywood movie conceit, a bit at odds with the character. More important, the movie feels slowed and weighed down by the stories of the various men trying to romance Hypatia, in spite of her seeming indifference to romantic entanglements and her almost monk like devotion to knowledge. It's not that these sub- plots are bad or not well executed, they're just much less interesting and more pro forma than the far less familiar historical, scientific and social material and story lines that surround them.

Amenebar is without question one of our most talented directors, so when he makes a film that doesn't reach (for me) the heights of ""The Sea Inside"" or ""The Others"" or ""Open Your Eyes"" I can't help but feel a little disappointed. But that doesn't mean it's not worth seeing.  His slight misfire here still beats most of what's out there handily.",1437177600,5,1986,4.742028985507246
