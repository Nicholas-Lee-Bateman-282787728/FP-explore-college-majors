494962,4,6302690390,"Not as good as the previous two Gidgets ( the first one was the best and it would have been better if Sandra Dee was in all of them but alas ! ) and the whole surf theme was kinda lost in this installment, except in the beginning , but still a fun movie to watch . You have to do a Gidget marathon day !!!",1011398400,,305,3.6363636363636362
494963,4,6302690390,"This's not my favourite Gidget movie,there is not much surfing and I love Debora Walley as Gidget, but still a lovely one. The prettyish scene is  when the coin join the necklace!  Gidget and Moondoggie are aways a  ""surf's movie"" favourite couple in my country. Italian landmarks  are really beautifull too, and after all is funny see how the cat jumps  between G. and M.",967334400,,372,4.661538461538462
494964,4,6302690390,"There are two problems with this movie. First, I do not like Cindy Carol as Gidget. I liked Sandra Dee and Deborah Walley a lot better. Second, there is not much surfing. Overlooking those two things, this is still a  fun movie. It seems there aways has to be something to come between our  favorite couple: Gidget and Moondoggie.  And what Gidget movie would be  complete without Gidget misreading situations? Gidget goes to Rome with her  two gal pals, Moondoggie, and his two friends (Judge from Gidget goes  Hawaiian returns). There is a lot of nice footage showing Italian  landmarks. Gidget, of course, gets herself in trouble and has a separation  from Jeff, played by gorgeous James Darren, but everything turns out for  Gidget in the end.  Doesn't it?",963705600,6,760,4.821705426356589
494965,3,6302690390,"This is my favorite and, I think, the best of the Gidget movies. James Darren is still extremely ""dreamy"" as Moondoggie, and Cindy Carol portrays a more grown-up Gidget. Though Sandra Dee is the very first Gidge,  I believe Carol gives her quite a run for her money. Who couldn't love the  ""Gigetta"" theme, and Moondoggie's sonata to Gidget? The fact that  I'm an Italian with hopes for visiting Rome just make me love this movie  even more! It was lovely!",949449600,5,456,4.592592592592593
7829453,4,6302690390,"Nice scenery, hunky James Darren, fun look back to 1963, don't care for Cindy Carol as Gidget",1464998400,,93,4.529411764705882
7829454,5,6302690390,Nothing but great things to say about this vintage VHS tape. Will go nicely with collection. Will consider this seller for another future purchase. Great deal for my $$$.,1454803200,,170,4.896551724137931
7829455,5,6302690390,"1963 saw the release of Gidget Goes To Rome the second sequel to Gidget. This time around Cindy Carol plays Gidget. Not as much a Beach Party film, but the trip to Rome is nice also. A sweet film from a more innocent time, and one you can watch with anybody.",1395532800,,258,4.078431372549019
7829456,3,6302690390,"The movie follows the script of the character Gidget, but lacks the chemistry of the original film of Gidget with Sandra Dee",1370390400,,124,4.681818181818182
7829457,4,6302690390,Awesome movie for the 1960's. The plot was light and it did have woman are lesser than men speel in it.,1369699200,,103,3.9523809523809526
7829458,5,6302690390,"I now have my most favorite Gidget movies.  This movie was in excellent condition and I love it!
I would recommend getting all the Gidget movies to anyone who likes old movies.",1368662400,,176,4.5
7829459,5,6302690390,"This is a wholesome, entertaining and awesome movie.  The songs and singing is excellent!  And, if we never ever get to go to Rome, it is just like being there!",1360454400,,160,4.3
7829460,5,6302690390,"Wish I could find this in DVD, but it is a very good tape, and I have my 5 year old Granddaughter hooked on this movie. As always, I got a good price from Amazon.",1353801600,,162,3.657142857142857
7829461,4,6302690390,"While this is nowhere near the best ""Gidget"" film, it is entertaining in its own right. Cindy Carol(whatever happened to her?)doesn't hold a candle to Sandra Dee and Deborah Walley (both RIP), but she does have spunky personality to spare. James Darren, impeccably tanned and handsome as always, is right in his element, singing under the Roman sun. The beautiful scenery, lively colors, peaceful music and the humorous performances are enough to recommend this movie.

Gidget, enjoying her last summer before college, manages to convince her folks to let her go to Rome for the summer with her friends and a chaperone. She and Moondoggie arrive in the Eternal city, hand in hand, only to again fall into problems when Jeff becomes infatuated with their beautiful guide, Daniela (the lovely Danielle de Metz). Gidget then begins seeing an older man, Paolo Cellini (Cesare Danova), thinking of it as romance, unaware that he is actually and army buddy of her dad's, whom he had asked to watch over the Gidge. Many misadventures, misunderstandings, and girl midget fantasies abound!!! Trudy Ames, as Gidget's friend Libby, is hilarious, (""They have to help the poor girl because she's so top heavy!""), and she has a perfect foil in Noreen Corcoran, as Lucy, (""Yes, that's probably what made her ankles so thick.""). Joby Baker, back as Judge, nearly steals the show with his goofy and appealing portrayal. Jessie Royce Landis is priceless and Judge's aunt Albertina, serving as the group's chaperone, who has no idea which side of Judge's family she's related to. Oh, and I liked her wigs and her cute little dogs, Howard and Ethel too. Cesare Danova, suave and sensitive, is everyone's idea of a Roman, and Lisa Gastoni is wonderful as his understanding wife. I rather liked Don Porter as Gidget's dad, and it was nice to see Jeff Donnell back as her mom.

Am I the only one who notices that every movie, Gidget gets a new house, new parents, new set of female friends, and a complete makeover? And she doesn't seem to age much past seventeen? Lucky girl. The bottom line: this movie is harmless fun!!! But if you watched it for the scenery alone, you still wouldn't be disappointed.",1141257600,,2181,4.860215053763441
7829462,1,6302690390,This movie was such a dissapointment after watching the first Gidget. The story line is weak and boring.,1069718400,2,104,4.833333333333333
