2751061,4,B000MX7V4S,"NO, they didn't use a Skye Terrier as the story is about, but the Westy star is a winner, bordering on ""too cute"" at times.  For a film company to want to redo this story to be more accurate, as they touted, this story isn't as strong or any closer to the real story than Disney's version. Still, it's beautifully filmed, heart-warming, and enjoyable.",1193961600,6,351,4.484375
2751062,5,B000MX7V4S,"Based on a true story that took place in Scotland in the 18th or 19th century( I can't remember which), this movie is about a terrier who is so loyal to his master that he insists on sleeping on his master's grave after the man dies from tuberculosis.  However, dogs are not allowed in the cemetery.  The movie's plot revolves around how Bobby (the terrier) and his human friends try to work around the silly cemetery rules. Sounds like a thin plot, but the dog (a West Highland White Terrier) is so darn cute and the Scottish accents (of the humans) are so, well, SCOTTISH,it makes for an entertaining movie.  The fact that it's based on a true story also helps. (They actually have a monument to Bobby in this town in Scotland.) Don't miss the song at the end of the movie, ""Here Inside,"" which is the most beautiful and moving song I've ever heard about missing someone who has passed away.",1189641600,3,893,4.466257668711656

2751064,4,B000MX7V4S,"Delightful film done in a beautiful Scottish setting circa 1858.  If you've ever had a really loyal dog, then this film is for you.  Great message, family friendly.

Based on a true story, this one will tug at your heart.  It shows human nature at it's best and it's worst.

2751066,4,B000MX7V4S,"The original 1961 Disney movie 'Greyfriars Bobby' was a distinct success back in its day. This newer 2005 version is an equally sentimental take on the irresistible Scottish doggy tale of 19th-century Edinburgh's Greyfriars Bobby, the Skye terrier whose master John Gray died and was buried in Greyfriars kirkyard. For fourteen years Bobby refused to leave his master's grave and, after a long and dangerous struggle, supported by sympathetic friends and a popular movement to overcome the city's anti-pooch bureaucracy, was finally granted not only a dog licence but freedom of the city. The Lord Provost of Edinburgh gets in on the act, and no doubt we can all think of a few politicians who would fall over each other to do the same today.

No opportunity is missed to give us the full waterworks in this overwhelmingly sentimental story. Acting is excellent, if a touch overdone in some of the minor parts, with attractive roles for James Cosmo, Greg Wise, Gina McKee, Ian Richardson, Christopher Lee and a few kids. But the starring, captivating role is undoubtedly that of Bobby himself, here played by the cutest imaginable West Highland terrier. Scenery, filmed in Edinburgh, Stirling and a few other places, is gorgeous. Geographical pedants will probably cavil at the scenery depicted on Bobby's lone 30-mile trek from Dunbar back to Edinburgh, which miraculously takes him through far-away Glencoe and other spectacular Highland landscapes.

But who cares? The story is well told and reasonably accurate, with some understandable liberties and embellishments. It's a great film for kids - apart from a few brief shots showing dead animals in marketplaces and such-like - as well as for animal-lovers and other sentimental adults too. Have a box of hankies beside you as you watch.",1457222400,,1791,5.13013698630137

You have to wait for Christopher Lee to appear but it's worth it. Also refreshing to see the pastor portrayed as a sympathetic character when the clergy is often stereotyped negatively. Instead it's the social institution directors and factory owners who are the antagonists.

2751091,2,B000MX7V4S,"This is a ho-hum movie.  I don't know what the ""true"" story of Greyfriar's Bobby is, but this is full of suspense and crises (seemed to be thrown in at every turn, like it was the only thing that would keep you engaged--very predictable, ad nauseam; when one crisis was past, you could easily predict that within 60 seconds some other horrible tragedy would befall either the dog or the boy) and lacking in the charm of Disney's original version.  This is far more British (the dialog is all in soft tones, as many British-made movies are) and not so Scottish, and the actors are only marginal; it's hard to top a performance by Laurence Naismith, I grant you, but these were just unremarkable characters.  If you check out the online auction sites, you'll see MANY cheap copies of this out there; there's a reason.  Save your pennies.

All the characters are changed and now the focus is a boy, a minister and town leaders, not the dog.  Even Greyfriars is now a cemetery and not the pub of history. A young cop who owned the dog dies early, a lot different to the old  shepard and too close to home for a young child.

The story is about 90% changed, which is so unnecessary when the true story is so poignant.  I think the Disney version is closer to the truth.  Skip this video.",1377820800,,639,4.223140495867769

2751106,5,B000MX7V4S,"Yes, if you love dogs, you'll love this movie. And if you don't cry in this movie, multiple times, I don't know what to say. I admit it, I'm a sucker for animal movies, and dog movies in particular (Marley and Me, Old Yeller, Incredible Journey, etc). I didn't know the story of Bobby, and thought the movie was going to be more funny than anything else - NOT!!! It was a heartwarming and tear jerking tale of a wonderful little dog (supposed to be a Skye but was a Westie, that part didn't bother me) who was so devoted to his master, that after his master died, he went to the grave every day and laid on it. He also did other things, became friends with Ewan, a little boy in his village, plus caught rats in the cemetery for the gravekeeper. I'm probably not explaining it to its best advantage, but trust me, it's a good story. I had tears within a few minutes of the opening scenes and on through the entire film, some happy, some sad. You cheer for this little dog with his persistence and timeliness. In the end, he brings about good things for the people in the village, who live in horrific conditions (1850's Scotland). SPOILER ALERT: at the end of this movie, you see him running through the hills, and the narrator (Christopher Lee, I think) announces that after 14 years of good and faithful service, he finally lies one last time on his master's grave and closes his eyes for good. It is beautifully filmed in Scotland, the actors are all good in their roles, love their brogues (think Sean Connery here, only more so), lots of story lines going on. The music is engineered to wring tears at the appropriate times, complete with drum rolls and huge swells of violins, but it, too, is beautiful and well matched to the story lines it's accompanying. All in all, I have to say I loved this movie, and I watched it with my yellow Lab in my lap. Curl up with your dog or cat and enjoy the story of Bobby. It may have been embellished and stretched a bit (from what other reviewers have said), but it's a great story, a fine movie and adults and kids will enjoy it equally.",1361577600,3,2083,4.343589743589743

2751111,3,B000MX7V4S,"Greyfriars Bobby(released Oct/05)attempts to tell the story of the legendary Greyfriars Bobby,the Skye Terrier that became a legend in its day for not leaving its dead masters graveside. Some residents claim the dog NEVER left the cemetery,reports have it living for 18 years and it was owned by a shepherd,then a policeman. It would be foolish to think a dog would never leave one spot for its entire life and would have to have at least been fed by cemetery personnel or passerbys. Jan Bondeson in his 2011 book on Bobby feels he was a stray who was ""adopted"" by the man who ran the cemetery,a Mr. Brown. As word spread so did the tourists who would pay to hear the story from Mr. Brown himself. It is also debatable whether the dog was owned by a shepherd or a policeman,as Skye Terriers are used more for ratting,not for herding,nor would it be used by a policeman as a dog to assist in his work,because of its short stature. The fact it supposedly lived 18 years is another myth. Skye's do not live more than 12 years and the author examined pictures of Bobby,and after a period there was a definite change in appearances from a scraggly looking Skye to a more youthful and well kept one. It is surmised there were actually two Bobbies,to keep the mythos alive and well. It was a boon for tourism and income for the city treasuries. There were many citizens that came forward many times over the years to counter the Bobby legend,but like most such things they tend to take on a life of their own and it is hard to debunk them once they have grown legs. The film itself has a West Highland Terrier as its' star. So right there the movie,regardless of its liberties with the actual facts,has got it wrong right from the get go,with its main character not even of the same breed.
The story here starts off as we find Bobby in the care of a policeman,John Gray. The cop dies and Bobby starts to frequent his old masters plot. After time the graveyard attendant starts feeding him and Bobby is used to catch rats there to earn his keep. Mrs. Gray is forced to move away and takes Bobby with her,but he yearns for Edinburgh and his masters gravesite. One day she lets him go and he travels back on his own.
There are two businessmen in town who do not want Bobby around,thinking him a stray and a nuisance. Bobbie's story has become legendary and while most citizens consider him a charge of all of them,the laws soon change and he is rounded up with other strays and set to be poisoned. A local Lord(Christopher Lee) comes to the rescue and Bobby finally has the freedom of Edinburgh in an official ceremony. The film ends with Bobbie's end who was buried with his master.
The latter is yet another mistake as Bobby was not allowed to be buried in the graveyard proper. He is buried just inside the main gate of the church yard. One has to constantly ignore the accuracy of this film and just concentrate on the story being presented. Unfortunately the story is not at all that well done. Within 20 minutes of the film's beginning the policeman is dead and soon after Bobby is sitting on his old masters grave. However the previous 20 minutes have NOT established a proper bond between Bobby and his master that would cause the terrier to sit upon his masters grave as he does for so long. Instead the makers,for whatever reason,concentrated more on development of the human characters instead;go figure. And of course,like so many animal pictures,Bobby is given human attributes. For example,at one point he is trying cross a fallen tree over a river and eventually plunges in. I own a Westie and I know she'd be over that tree and across like no ones business. But here Bobby has to be overly cautious,even going down to its belly as it slips and slides its way along.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r and is clear and crisp. No extras are to be found.
All in all a disappointment all around. An uneven story,coupled with an inaccurate account of Bobbie's story,gives us a film which is passable and that's all. Like author Bondeson suggests,there will probably never be an accurate account,a REAL story of the Bobby of Greyfriars. Legend is always better,and more profitable,than fact.",1353801600,,4204,4.5621693121693125

2751120,5,B000MX7V4S,"A terrier dog named Bobby, known since the mid 1800's in Edinburgh as ""Greyfriars Bobby"" has a monument to his devotion to his master.  His story is one of love, unwavering loyalty, determination, and dog charm.  Bobby became the hero and object of affection to a city, old and young, rich and poor, all united to forever keep the story of such a magnificent dog alive forever.

Bobby was nothing but a small Skye Terrier who was so devoted to his master that he could not stand to be away from his grave after the funeral. Bobby's story is of the extreme measures needed to be taken to remain atop the grave of the man he loved. The cemetery allowed no dogs.

This version, ""THE ADVENTURES OF GREYFRIARS BOBBY"" is a bit more accurate to the true Scotland events than the much acclaimed Walt Disney version titled ""Greyfriars Bobby"", the same title as the book by Indiana's author of youth books, Eleanor Atkinson. See my reviews of both the Disney DVD and the book. Both are recommended at 5 stars, just like this DVD version.

This newer release, has some really fantastic music. The scenery of the film is as good as any Scotland travelogue could provide. The tale is as heartwarming as any could be written--AND REMEMBER--this is a TRUE story, not fiction.  I fell in love with Bobby.

Greyfriars Bobby will live on in the lives of the people of Edinburgh forever.  It will in your mind and heart as well as soon as you watch one or more of the versions of this fine dog-devotion story.  It makes no difference if you do it movie style or by reading.  I recommend both.

This is one fantastic childrens' gift, although adults will enjoy it completely as well.  For the very young, I might suggest the Disney version DVD, as it shows a little less peril.  And Disney decided to end the story prior to Bobby's death.

My husband and I rented it some time ago, and were so taken by the movie that we ordered it as a gift. It is appropriate for both children and adults. Don't know what to get for a birthday present? Purchasing this movie is the perfect answer.",1244160000,,326,4.109375
2751122,1,B000MX7V4S,"The original Greyfriar's Bobby movie from Disney is one of my favorite movies... and my wife's absolute favorite.  I was excited to see a new movie with a Westie in the title role.  This latest version is a travesty!  It strays from the original true story to put in a predictable and 100% fictitious story line involving a wicked mill owner (dirty capitalist!) who is bound to murder Bobby so his oppressed workers might not be distracted by the dog.  What tripe!  The original Greyfriar's Bobby story is true and the 1961 Disney sticks basically to the actual story.  The actual story is truly remarkable!  Why the makers of this latest version felt the need to ""spice it up"" I will never know.  Their additions, including Bobby being a psychic and a dramatic performer of pantomime, are laughable for the wrong reasons and detract from the actual true story.  Do your family a favor and buy the 1961 version instead.",1210550400,29,919,4.69375
2751123,5,B000MX7V4S,"This movie is most charming.  At first the Scottish accents are so strong that it is difficult to understand.  However, just turn the volume up and then things start to fall into place.  It is the true story of how a dog's loyalty to his deceased master becomes a rallying cry for the poorer inhabitants of Edinburgh to contradict the local mill boss.  It is very moving and conveys a message of hope against all odds. This movie makes for a wonderful family evening.  A very recommendable and clean film.",1210464000,7,505,4.566666666666666

Being of U.K. descent,you grow up with the story of ""Greyfriar's Bobby"" with all of it's morphings, so much so, that it is hard to know just where the legend let's off and the truth begins! Hence my difficulty here,because this is yet another version based on the story of the little Scottish Skye Terrier who would not leave his Master's grave site in Edinburgh for 11 to 14 years (depending on which wee legend tickles your fancy!).
