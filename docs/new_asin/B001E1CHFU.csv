8295989,4,B001E1CHFU,"A decent review of the period between the 1st Roxy Music album and 1974's ""Country Life.""  Why ""Siren"" was overlooked, I don't know. It was part of the band's initial run of albums.  Without a follow up to cover the rest of the Roxy story, it is even more inexplicable.  However, on the plus side it does over some good video clips (most are available on other dvds) and the critiques are interesting.  Get it cheap and for die-hard fans only.",1486944000,,443,4.432098765432099
