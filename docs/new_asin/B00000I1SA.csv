7909329,3,B00000I1SA,"Based upon actual incidents, this is a very romantic and clich&eacute;-burdened tale of a man struggling to correct a situation which will bring danger to his wife and child. A Las Vegas casino owner, after an unwanted clash with a Columbian crime family member, becomes deeply engaged with several unsavory groups in his attempt to achieve safety for him and his family. Despite Homeric efforts, the protagonist, played effectively by William Forsythe, is not allowed to find the support he craves, and must eventually broach the powers of evil. The film is amply dark in its nature; unfortunately, the video itself is rather murky and the sound at times is muffled. Since there is obviously a large measure of cutting, much development of characters and scenes is starkly missing. Director Nelson McCormick does not seem to provide a point of view. Despite these flaws, some scenes are very good indeed, thanks principally to Forsythe's performance, for which he obviously prepared. Although it almost seems as if the script uses every available bromide concerning organized criminal behavior, the film's energy comes clearly through to the viewer. This may only be recommended for fans of William Forsythe; they will undoubtedly find much to enjoy.",1110412800,,1251,5.198019801980198
