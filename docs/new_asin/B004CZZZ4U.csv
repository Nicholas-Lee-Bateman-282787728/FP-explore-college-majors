8424359,4,B004CZZZ4U,"Really was surprised that I liked this film. Rose Hobart possesses George Macready's soul,and he plays totally creepy scary character once she ""saves"" him from certain death.",1470787200,,174,5.481481481481482

8424362,2,B004CZZZ4U,"This MOD disc from Columbia is very talky, and despite the title there is no monster (at least not in the horror film sense like the Wolfman or Frankenstein Monster) just a devilish woman.  Lots of talk and noir like shadowy photography.  The image shows grain but is certainly watchable despite a few scratches here and there, and the sound is fine.",1348963200,4,350,4.629032258064516
