2010534,5,B0001L3LUE,"First, I am a HUGE fan of Errol Morris. He manages to capture the psychology of his subjects so well.
In the case of McNamara, he confronts McNamara with the analytic paradigm that led him to war. He asks a simple question, how can you justify the things that you did, perhaps only in a support role, in raining war on people both in Japan and Viet Nam. McNamara does not back down, and Morris does not force his opinion onto the viewer too much or McNamara. One is left to ponder statements of McNamara's like, ""If we lost, I would be convicted as a war criminal."" Or McNamara responding to a question about Viet Nam, ""Look, I'm damned if I do, and I'm damned if I don't. I'd rather be damned if I don't.""
What you see so clearly is the humanity of a man who, rightly or wrongly -- I happen to think rightly -- helped lead a country to war and was, at least indirectly, responsible for probably a million deaths. How does this person manage this? How does he himself?",1074556800,10,968,4.266304347826087
2010535,5,B0001L3LUE,"Errol Morris's stunning documentary is about one of the 20th century's most significant players: Robert McNamara, who reprises the highlights of his life and professional career. The movie covers a lot of ground, including McNamara's stint as a Ford Motor Co. executive, his participation as a war planner in World War II, and his crucial involvement as secretary of defense under President John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and under Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson during the Vietnam War. There are some stunning revelations, including his role in the firebombing of Japan, as well as the nuclear face-off between the United States and Cuba. This is another brilliant coup for Morris, the inspired documentarian who has made a career out of conversations with the most fascinating subjects. He tells a story that knocks you right off your feet.",1074470400,24,859,5.142857142857143
2010536,5,B0001L3LUE,"I had the opportunity to attend the premiere at Boston's Kennedy Library today for invited guests of Mr. Morris.  Mr. McNamara was in attendance and took part in a question-&-answer session after the screening.  As a college student at both UCalBerkeley and then at University of Wisconsin in the 1960's I lived through those most distressing times both for my generation and for my Country.  This fast-moving documentary, at times difficult to watch given the emotional involvement we had with the subject during the 1960's, is superb!  I came away feeling that I had not completely understood the role Mr. McNamara played during the Kennedy/Johnson administration or any sense of his humanity.  It will be several days before I truly can compose my thoughts but this is a documentary that must be seen by anyone who lived through the Vietnam era or who wishes to learn from the mistakes made during those troubling times.",1071360000,31,923,4.967532467532467
2010574,4,B0001L3LUE,"This story of McNamara's life in public service is inconclusive. He seems to have done what he did without the freedom to choose his own path. It looks like he followed those in power, the two presidents, Kennedy and Johnson, doing the best he could under the circumstances. Operating at such a level, he was unable to have his opinions obeyed. He comes away from his life looking bad. This portrayal of him makes it look like he is confessing to being a fool and having acted incorrectly against his better judgment. He was identified with the evil of power at the highest level. He could not see the evil of his actions. He was blinded by his position. He comes away from this story satisfied with the ambiguity of his actions. His life shows the simple truth that power among men is inherently evil and involves murder on a grand scale.",1515196800,,839,4.526315789473684

2010595,5,B0001L3LUE,"This was an excellent, informative and well balanced inquiring into the mind of Robert S. McNamara.

There are many plusses to this documentary. One of course is to see a different insider's view of history. Another is we get a feel for what McNamara is really like as a human being instead of a news item. We even get an ""If I had it to do all over"" scenario.

I was especially interested in the Vietnam era as I was there in 67-68 and at the time did not pay attention to the big picture. It makes you wonder what we will find out about today tomorrow.

Aside from the interesting history and different views of the actual decisions of the time, is that the presentation wand in a more chronological order, instead of a bunch of sound bites pouncing back and forth between different narrators, jumbling the timeline in the process.

2010602,4,B0001L3LUE,"The Fog of War, 2003 film

It begins with a Navy ship at sea. Then it shows a man speaking about mistakes in applying military power. But you can only make one mistake with nuclear weapons. At age 85 Robert McNamara can look back at his life. The Defense Department uses over half of every tax dollar. President Kennedy picked him as Secretary of Defense in 1962. There is a review of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. Lesson #1: Empathize with your enemy. What to do? Totally destroy Cuba? Or make a deal? The alternative is mutual destruction. Lesson #2: Rationality will not save us. It was luck that prevented nuclear war and its total destruction. One result was a nuclear test ban. Lesson #3: Theres something beyond ones self. McNamara talks about his schooling. He went to Berkeley and Harvard. He was Assistant Professor at Harvard. They used a punch card sorter to select the best and the brightest.

They analyzed why airplanes turned back when sent out. A General lead from the front and ended this. Lesson #4: Maximize efficiency. The B-29 bombed from a higher altitude to avoid fighters and anti-aircraft guns. The use of incendiary bombs killed 100,000 civilians. When B-29's flew above enemy fighters their loss ratio was less but so too the accuracy. So the B-29's flew lower at 5,000 feet for more accuracy. Lesson #5: Proportionality should be a guideline in war. Firebombing destroyed cities and civilians. [Bombing civilians or non-combatants used to be a war crime until both sides did it.] After the war they went to Ford Motor Company. They analyzed the market to meet customers needs or wants. Packaging prevented damage to occupants. They introduced steering wheels that wouldnt impale the driver, padded dashboards to protect passengers, and seat belts. But people resisted seat belts. Kennedy wanted McNamara as Secretary of Defense.

In October 1963 McNamara suggested withdrawing troops from Vietnam in two years. The military coup removed the Diem family. Next month Kennedy was shot. Johnson objected to troops, things were getting worse. Lesson #7: Belief and seeing are both often wrong. There was an attack on a US destroyer on August 2, 1964. There was another reported attack on a destroyer, so there were bombing attacks on North Vietnam. Congress passed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution to give power to Johnson. Were there really attacks? It didn't happen. Military forces were sent to South Vietnam. Later McNamara visited Vietnam in 1995 to meet their leaders. Lesson #8: Be prepared to reexamine your reasoning.

They used Agent Orange during the war for defoliation. Lesson #9: In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil. [Did Sherman really burn all of Atlanta?] People protested in Washington. Lesson #10: Never say never. McNamara said LBJ had prime responsibility. He wrote a memo objecting to LBJs policies; then he was fired. He made errors that were recognized in hindsight. Lesson #11: You cant change human nature. Everyone makes mistakes. War is very complex and hard to understand all the variables. Reason has limits. Why didn't he speak out against the war after he left the Johnson administration? He didn't want to create a controversy. Robert S. McNamara served as President of The World Bank from 1968 to 1981. Since his retirement he has continued to work on problems of poverty, world health, and economic development.

This interview presents comments by the former Secretary of Defense. You will learn more from a critical biography.",1488412800,,3509,4.9914529914529915

2010617,5,B0001L3LUE,"In a belated attack of conscience or a Parthian Shot to remember, Eisenhower warned the Republic to guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the militaryindustrial complex. This was oracular. And emissaries of this hegemony did not come brighter or more dapper than Robert McNamara and his endless flipcharts. He gave fulsomely unto Caesar what belonged to Caesar and if there was nothing residual to offer the other dynamic, he lacked the software to gauge the magnitude of his loss. One wonders if he was the Protestant Work Ethic writ large. A strand of DNA from the Old Firm, in way of guilt and the beseechment of grace, might have altered the dynamic but it was not to be. Never one to sit still and ruminate on the nature of things, he celebrated the Rite of Industriousness until his dying day. It never occurred to him to spend a day at Ho Chi Minh Citys Go Vap orphanage where Hong Tu, a 5 month old girl with Encephalocele (you don't want to know) lies alone with any number of chemicals in her blood. Surely reparation came at the World Bank? Or the pro-bono work for the UN? That mattered.

Here he fights a more desperate battle than Khe Sanh: his posthumous reputation. The Eleven life-lessons tabled by RM in this doco reek of recalibration, not recognition. After all, where do desecration, defoliation and defilement sit in a bell-curve? With all the skill of a Grandmaster, McNamara adopts the Bukharin Defence from the Third Moscow Show Trial: willingly admit to culpability in general  say, the Firebombing of Tokyo, Vietnam or the use of Agent Orange therein  and attribute blame specifically to the likes of LBJ or Curtis Le May. Its too clever by half but that was always McNamaras downfall. Part of me  or it could be the ghost of Ashurbanipal  says that you cannot incinerate one hundred thousand civilians in one night and not expect retribution. On this point, the doco is eerily effective as it roams the streets of Tokyo in search of the spectres and screams of yesteryear.

In the remnants of the day, what is left? Flipcharts in landfill? A Medal of Freedom in storage? A dynasty of steel-rimmed glass that provided sight but not vision? While they're not kin, Rumsfeld shares the genotype and indeed, phenotype of his predecessor. No-one can rule guiltlessly, said Saint-Just. Believe him.",1480809600,2,2368,4.820197044334975

It  is very important that you understand that McNamara became introspective and the many years after the events he talks about made him relatively honest. He is not the smart aleck he was in 1965 but an old man grieved with the unnecessary death of hundreds of thousands on his conscience.

In it, a much older McNamara reflects, almost apologetically, about his involvement with the escalation of the war in Vietnam.

Although it is a sad picture to see a man reviewing his legacy to find that his is rather wanting, I am of an age in which I saw McNamara in his heyday - where he believed that every consideration could be reduced to numerical and statistical analysis.  Behind the mask was a power and influence hungry politician who, along with LBJ, chose to continue a war well after it became obvious that is was not winnable, not so mention the intrinsic immorality of our presence there and desperate and cruel tactics (the use of napalm and agent orange).

It was always obvious to us (the troops that were there), that the US didn't really want to win that war. Johnson didn't have a clue what he was doing.  Another obvious fact we seem to continue to ignore is that we can't be getting involved in other countries civil wars. Especially religious wars. They can't be won.  We have seen that in Iraq and Afganistan recently. All we do is get our tropps killed and maimed, and kill thousands of inocent civilians.

Other than an elite education and opportunities that very few individuals have, Robert S. McNamara lived a common American life...as a youth, at least.  I doubt that it is an elderly man's attempt to make excuses.  It seems more to me, that it is a man that wants to present some honest conclusions that he has derived from nearly a century of living, and from work beside and against some of the world's most prominent, historical, and influential people.  Soak it up.  Watch it twice, and then visit it again a year later.  Most likely, it will move you in a new way each time.  This video is an outstanding 107 minute lesson from the Great Depression through the Cold War.

**For History Teachers**:  Please use this!  Americans don't know enough about American history.  They don't know about FDR, Muhammad Ali, RFK, Henry Ford, and many more.  This is an opportunity to educate young Americans in a relatively objective way.  Please teach about The New Deal, the great plow, great depression and dust bowl.  Teach in detail about the war of 1812, the Oregon Trail, and similar nation-forming events in American history.  Yes the subject of slavery and the civil rights movement must be labored upon however, not all of the original American conquests were tragedies in scope.  Teach about the struggles and triumphs of the first Americans and remind young impressionable minds that these folks were families that set out to prosper.  They weren't pirates looking for plunder.  I know that half or most American children in public schools are just learning to speak English now but some of us have been here for centuries.

2010752,4,B0001L3LUE,"Almost an entire generation has something to say about John McNamara. Many of those who served in Viet Nam have cause to be caustic. My service came a little later, but even so the LPH (Amphibious Helicopter ship) I served on was of a class of ship described as McNamara's Revenge. As part of his ""Biggest Bang for the Buck"" business philosophy, these ships were , according to the story, cut in half, costing us an engine and a large portion of our abilty to carry and deliver amphibious forces. Ultimately the Navy would build the LHA class of ships (a much larger, twin engine, Amphibious Helicopter ship)  to replace the LPH. I would have a minuscule role in that project.

In this movie an 86 year old Robert Strange McNamara will face the camera and the questions of Errol Morris and try to explain his life. For most of us a good day is when you catch the winning pass in a game, while in front of your parents and friends. For McNamara a good day in World War II was helping to design a bombing mission that would destroy over 100,000 people, women and children included. He admits that he escaped being a war criminal only by being on the winning side. To be fair to him, we need all understand, as he says, in war you do bad things. He also asks about proportionality, and as applied to this part of his life it is fairly certain that firebombing of so many Japanese cities does not fit his understanding of proportionality.

Later he will ask of a former Vietnamese Defense minister what the North Vietnamese felt they had gained by fighting a war that would cost over 3 million fellow citizens. We are to believe that McNamara was shocked to learn that from their point of view the war was not about Communism, but about independence.  Again, in McNamara's defense he has told us that seeing and believing and being a rational decision-maker is not enough. His point in this section is to emphasize the absolute necessity for policymakers to have empathy for the view of the opposition.

I am confused as to how he could have been so completely in agreement with President Kennedy to end US involvement in Viet Nam in 1963. Then sign on to President Johnson's self -acknowledged wrongheaded decisions to slide into the tragedy that would become America's Viet Nam War. That McNamara would leave government before 50% of America's war dead would become a fact, is comfort only for McNamara.

The real dive of this movie is not just to allow one old man to write a revisionist history, making him to be better than he was. This is an effort to do more than ease the conscience of this man. McNamara is well aware of the contradictions of and the conflicts in his life. His career after Secretary of Defense would include over ten years as head of the World Bank and working and writing in support of world-wide efforts to alleviate poverty.

In The Fog of War he will list 11 lessons from his life. Not all these lessons were learned by or demonstrate McNamara as the hero. A lesson for the viewer is that if you are going to live your life on a stage larger than your schools athletic field there is a very real chance that your mistakes will have much larger consequences.  Very few of us will ever have to live the reality of decisions that contribute to a one night death toll of 100,000 people. McNamara would be in the rooms where these kinds of decision would be made. He is aware that he is complicit in these and many other deaths. We must be careful about judging is his ultimate guilt.

Those who survived the history changed by McNamara, have cause to judge him. Lost family, friends and limb is a payment that earns one the right to speak bluntly about the man. In their name I have to agree that some hard questions were not forced and important admission never make it to the screen. A major omission is a lack of any address directed to those who served. If McNamara felt that he owed the people who went into battle an apology or any direct, explicit summation dedicated to survivors and family, it is not here.

At some time in the future, students of history will study this movie. For them Fog of War will be a useful and important addition to their understandings of a complex period. This is a rare opportunity to look into the living face of a decision maker and judge not just his words, or his thoughts in the moment, but how his reflections on his long past decisions should be used to inform future decision makers.

This may be the best part of this documentary. It is telling that he can handle the fact that his time in Washington may have contributed to his wife's early death, but he does not get emotoinal until thinking about the death of President Kennedy. Similar moments in the movie are just as telling. Close, or repeated viewing show the man, and his human responses. His passion about the message he wants to teach and which past events stir him most profoundly are a part of McNamara that text cannot capture. Pay as much attention to when his voice strains, catches or his eyes water. There is honesty in his reactions that teach as much as his words.",1407888000,2,5104,4.4833153928955864

McNamara honesty is visible.  I believe him when he says that JFK personally authorized assassination of president Diem.  Next, as most of you know, whole hell broke lose.  Yes, McNamara is looking straight into your eyes and says our involvement in Vietnam was a mistake.  He concludes we were thinking that we fight the Cold War but for the South and North Vietnam it was a civil war.

2010771,5,B0001L3LUE,"Few figures of recent American history will be as controversial as Robert McNamara. Secretary Of Defense under both President Kennedy and President Johnson from 1961-1968, he played key roles both during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and in the lead up to and conduct of the Vietnam War during that period. McNamara, who died in 2009, was the subject of Errol Morris' 2003 documentary The Fog Of War which itself recently had its own tenth anniversary.

Partly that's because of its subject matter. Largely because of the controversy around him and his long silence about his role in the Vietnam War,  McNamara himself is a fascinating figure. Outside of his 1995 book In Retrospect, this may very well be the most candid McNamara ever was about his life and in particular about his time as Secretary Of Defense. Thanks to Morris' interrotron technique, McNamara often seems to be looking right into the eyes of the viewer and the vice versa is true as well. The result is that this portrait of him is given even more power, especially when he talks about helping pick out the site where JFK is buried where you can see his eyes watering or his eyes light up in the rare moments of humor. McNamara also proves he can own up (as it were) to some of the more questionable events he took part in and even downright mistakes such as the firebombing of Japanese cities in World War II and the fundamental misunderstandings that led to increasing involvement in Vietnam. Yet, for every moment like that though, there are moments where one can't quite read him, especially when he becomes increasingly guarded about Vietnam and why he didn't speak out more against it after he left government. The results are often just as haunting as they are fascinating.

McNamara himself though is just part of the documentary. Morris makes extensive use of archival material with some of the most outstanding being rarely heard recording of meetings and phone calls involving McNamara and the two President's he served under, especially in comparing the conflicting attitudes to the war in Vietnam expressed first by Kennedy in late 1963 and then Johnson just months after Kennedy's assassination. There is also a wealth of rarely seen documents as well, especially from McNamara's statistical work during World War II that leads to a haunting piece of animation of his handwritten numbers becoming the bombs dropped on Japanese cities. There is also a limited amount of reenactments as well, especially to illustrate the surreal but true way that skulls were dropped down a Cornell University stairwell in tests that led Ford to install seat-belts in their vehicles. Then there's the score of Phillip Glass which gives the entire proceeding a most haunting quality it might not have had otherwise. As a result, the more artistic elements of the documentary compliment the portrait of McNamara rather nicely.

The heart of the film though is in its narrative structure, which is centered around eleven lessons Morris draws from McNamara's life. It is these lessons that make the film as timely as ever in a world that continues to be in a state of continuous conflict. McNamara's life and the events he relates are merely examples from how the Cuban Missile Crisis shows us that rationale people can be lead to the edge of irrational decisions (starting a nuclear war) to how the Gulf Of Tonkin incident is a prime example of how seemingly incontrovertible evidence can be wrong and lead to unimagined consequences. While these examples might be taken from decades and crisis' of the past, are every bit as applicable today as they were both in McNamara's time and when this was first released a decade ago.

Though the documentary itself is around an hour and forty-five minutes, the DVD release contains a set of additional scenes lasting approximately forty more minutes. Many of them are short anecdotes and pieces of information including experiences working in the Pacific during World War II and working with both John and Robert Kennedy as well as an intriguing piece about talking to a young woman at a protest outside the World Bank (who McNamara was a long time president of though its only briefly mentioned in the actual documentary). Others are extensions of sequences featured in the documentary itself such as the aforementioned comparison of the conflicting attitudes of Kennedy and Johnson towards Vietnam. While not part of the documentary itself, they do make for intriguing viewing alongside it.

Despite being about events a half century or so ago, and being a decade ago itself, it remains a film as relevant today as it ever has been. On one hand, it presents a compelling portrait of McNamara and his role in some of the most important and controversial events of the last fifty years. On the other, it blends that portrait skillfully with artistic elements that make the lessons taken from that portrait all the more compelling. The results are haunting, fascinating and well worth viewing.",1400544000,,5001,4.926453143534994

I love history, and the eras in American history between WWII and the Vietnam War have always intrigued me. In this documentary, McNamara speaks quite candidly about the decisions made in the different conflicts, and he offers an intimate look at the relationship between the Secretary of Defense and the presidents he served. McNamara bluntly admits that some of the actions that the U.S. has taken would have been viewed as immoral and would likely have led to war crime charges had America not prevailed in victory. He gets choked up a couple of times when speaking about JFK, and he is surprisingly sharp and clear-headed even at the age of 85.

The film was made after the Bush invasion of Iraq, he's too damn coy.  He gets off too easy.  He should have been cornered on what a catastrophe Vietnam was for the nation and our military, and he should have been pushed on the issue of what a disaster Iraq was.

Robert McNamara, for all his divisive policies, puts a human spin on the decisions he made during his tenure and helps provide context to foreign policy choices that, when seen from the vacuum of a text book or essay always, can't possibly be considered correct. Yet, somehow McNamara manages to bring you into the decisions he was forced to make and help you understand the repercussions of them. The Fog of War gives you a view of foreign policy from 30,000 feet while still feeling human. An amazing accomplishment, to be sure.",1387756800,,797,4.77536231884058

Mac's Modus operandi was simple, do it then blame others for the failure of the operation. His direction of the Vietnam war was an abject failure. HE was the man who recommended the vast increase in the number of US troops to be deployed to win victory in a manner never considered by anyone at war before. His ""Big Plan""? Attempt to achieve a stalemate....no joke, he set out to get a stalemate like the ""Draw"" we got in Korea. Problem, Korea was an accidental stalemate. NO ONE set out to get a draw. Not us, not Korea, not Russia, it just happened. It happened with massive casualties on both sides, casualties, in 3 years of Korea, were the same number in the EIGHTEEN years of Vietnam. The Korean draw was achieved because of unsustainable casualties on both side. Vietnam? As far as Mihn was concerned ""The US wants to ""play war?"" fine, we will take the casualties but, in the end, with the help of your press, we will out last you.
McNamara got his nick name in Vietnam because he was the only person in theater that thought his plan was attainable. As we all know, with hind sight, it was truly a ""Mad"" idea.",1387411200,,1255,4.460869565217391

In this documentary former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara comes clean about his and others involvement in the Vietnam War.

2010939,5,B0001L3LUE,"I was a student at UW-Madison from 1967-72, the peak of the Vietnam nonsense. McNamara has had a bad rap, and this film gives validation to his integrity. McNamara was Secretary of Defense from 1960-67 and was fired when Johnson decided to make Vietnam his own plaything. There are important suggestions that McNamara was instrumental in avoiding the Cuban missile crisis.

Madison, at that time, was a hot-house of student unrest, which was an education unto itself.

""The Fog of War"" is a good film, winner of most doc awards in '03, and worthy. When McNamara was fired, most of the damage had been done, and Johnson wouldn't listen anymore. The film leaves a lot to be decided by the viewer; was McNamara the ""evil bastard"", as history labels him, or was he Johnson's lackey? The film suggests the latter, and it's hard to doubt his sincerity, with (I think) genuine tears and guilt.

As a parable, it's hard to decide who are the good guys and bad guys when confronted with a quandary such as Vietnam. McNamara had seen war, and studied it, but admits there's a ""fog"" that will never allow anyone to know the why and wherefore. He also admits there were mistakes.

2010959,5,B0001L3LUE,"This DVD sat on my shelf for six years until I ""retired"" from my second career as a high school history teacher.  I regret that I waited so long to watch it.  In my first career, I spent 30 years as a field artilleryman including a tour in Vietnam.  For most of my adult life, I blamed McNamara for everything that went wrong in Vietnam and held him personally accountable for the deaths of 58,000 Americans and 100,000s of Vietnamese.  Although I remain conflicted over our involvement in Vietnam, ""The Fog of War"" has caused me to begin to reassess my long-held animus against McNamara.  I no longer judge him as harshly as I once did.
I met him twice.  Once, in India in the mid-90s while I was the defense attach at our embassy in New Delhi, he visited as a private citizen.  The other time, I was an instructor at the Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, and he was participating in a seminar.  I am thankful that on both occasions I treated him with respect even though I felt he had blood on his hands.
My bottom line is that I now feel that McNamara was a selfless public servant who tried to make the best possible decisions based on the information available.  Alas, the information was often flawed and incomplete, and some of those decisions were tragically wrong.  We also have to remember that the Vietnam War took place in the larger context of the Cold War and concurrent with a tumultuous domestic scene.  Even so, McNamara will remain a polarizing figure in American history for decades to come.",1352851200,9,1529,4.543795620437956
2010960,2,B0001L3LUE,"""[General Curtis] LeMay said if we'd lost [World War II] we'd all have been prosecuted as war criminals, and I think he's right.  He, and I'd say I, were behaving as war criminals. . . . LeMay recognized that what he was doing would be thought immoral if his side had lost.  Well, what makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win?"" -- Robert S. McNamara

The defendant who accepts responsibility for his crimes is usually accorded some measure of leniency, but McNamara's confession here begs more questions than it answers.  This comes as no surprise to those studying filmed police confessionals, who may hue and cry along rather postmodern lines that ""confession concerns the confessional situation rather than the act about which a subject confesses.""  Indeed, for this very reason our society has applied specific constitutional protections to those undergoing custodial interrogations.  Though prosecutors may occasionally be surprised by the meaning jurors take from a filmed confession, as in the Bernhard Goetz case, in practical terms, postmodern interpretation -- this hyper-conscious attention to / dislocation of context -- can hardly stand in the way: ""[L]aw may use postmodernism as a tool, but may never embrace it fully.  Because in the final analysis, beyond all theory and beyond all thought and debate, questions and problems, shortcomings and failures, the law must function.  It must work; it must resolve disputes and reach conclusions.""

LeMay's statement, to reach a proper conclusion, ""must be taken in the proper context: political leaders, military commanders, and countless others would probably have been tried by Japan and Germany or promptly executed according to their military practice of the time.""  LeMay was no doubt aware that these `trials' and executions would have taken place without the due process protections expected by citizens of Western democracies, and at least arguably supplied to the defendants at Nuremberg.  Seen in this light, LeMay was hardly confessing to anything at all, but merely stating the plain fact of Axis totalitarianism.

Both the director of The Fog of War, Errol Morris, and his subject, McNamara, overlook (or in the case of Morris, perhaps deliberately disregard) this context in framing LeMay's `confession,' and more than that, McNamara's own.  Though his mea culpa relates to World War II, the impression is unshakeable that the true object of McNamara's guilty conscience lies somewhere in the shadow of Vietnam.  Regarding that later conflict, ""McNamara's revelation that he was really a closet dove did nothing to rehabilitate his reputation.""

Doves were no doubt scarce after Pearl Harbor.  By the closing months of World War II, the air war in Europe had left the door open to saturation bombing of civilians by both sides.  Though McNamara did not give the orders, his contribution to the war effort -- in the form of statistical analysis -- may have contributed to the decision to use incendiary bombs from an altitude of five thousand feet against the Japanese.

Orchestrated by General Curtis LeMay in the final months of the Pacific campaign, the fire-bombing of Tokyo killed close to one hundred thousand Japanese civilians, causing ""more deaths in a six-hour period than . . . at any time in the recorded history of warfare[.]""  As one description noted: ""The stench of burning flesh filled the skies two miles above the city.""  Yet, despite the magnitude of this event as tragedy, in the context of history and the law of war, LeMay's actions may have been justified by military necessity; even the authors of the book based on Morris's film are forced to admit as much.  Though the raid on Tokyo took place before Okinawa, that battle must have at least confirmed Japan's suicidal intent in the minds of U.S. strategists.  Kamikaze pilots are mentioned in passing as another example of the brutal character of the Pacific war, but stripped mostly of this context by McNamara's conflated conscience and Morris's unforgiving camera, LeMay's statement is made to seem the confession of a guilty man.

In his earlier documentary film, The Thin Blue Line, Morris did capture a legally significant confession -- remarkably tape-recording the interview with consent of the murderer himself, who admitted to the killing of a police officer for which another man was awaiting execution.  Morris's efforts in that case ultimately led to the exoneration of an innocent man.  The Fog of War, however, allows for no such legal catharsis, because McNamara has confessed to a crime that does not exist.  As the following will show, the case against Robert McNamara (and by implication General Curtis LeMay) is more propaganda than proof, more left-wing myth than legal reality.

In the context of war crimes, positive law (usually in the form of treaty obligations) is intertwined with customary practice -- the notion that the actions of nations during wartime define what behavior is acceptable under international law.  Prior to World War I, the accepted practice was that any bombardment of civilians was only permissible as an incident to attacking a target out of military necessity.  During World War I, both sides engaged in the indiscriminate bombing of civilians, and justified these attacks as necessary to erode enemy morale.  Though attempts were made during the inter-war years to come to grips with this practice by creating binding positive law to enforce a ban on aerial bombardment of non-combatants, this was ultimately unsuccessful.  On the eve of World War II, though all sides took great pains to advocate against the practice, ultimately there was no clear international law that prohibited saturation bombing of civilian populations during wartime.

As W. Hays Parks has noted:  ""An air planner in any nation in the interwar era as well as during World War II would have had a difficult time determining the law governing aerial bombardment.  He would have found it impossible to find clear, well-defined, express language prohibiting or permitting the actions he was contemplating; at best, he would have found considerable disagreement and confusion among scholars.  He would have been unable to find a comprehensive list of objects that legitimately could be considered military objects; and, in particular, he would not have been able to find appropriate language explaining the distinction between combatants and noncombatants in contemporary terms.""

Parks also notes that, as it is won't to do when the law ""`lags behind the facts, . . . it is eventually nullified . . . .'""  The customary law of nations during the inter-war years was open to an interpretation that would permit bombing of civilian populations as a legitimate targeting of enemy morale.  Prior to the start of World War II, U.S. General Billy Mitchell had predicted that new developments in air power would effectively erase the distinction between combatants and non-combatants during wartime, and it would be difficult to argue that Mitchell's predictions were not borne out.

But McNamara overstates his case (against himself no less) when he claims that ""the human race prior to [the air offensive against the Japanese], and today, has not really grappled with . . . the rules of war[.]""  Perhaps he meant to say that the human race has been unsuccessful in its grappling with those rules:  ""[I]n the fifth century, St. Augustine . . . held that in a war deemed to be `just' all might be legitimately killed.  The fact that all might not be equally involved (and therefore culpable) in war was an irrelevance, and the distinction between the soldier (who fought) and the non-combatant (who did not) had not been seen as significant.""

Even aerial bombardment has been the attempted object of international treaty-making since at least the turn of the nineteenth century -- thinking of hot air balloons, the Hague Convention of 1899 contemplated a five-year moratorium on the employment of aerial bombardment platforms.  The Hague Convention of 1907 contained language allowing that no ""undefended"" towns could be lawfully subject to bombardment ""by any means.""  Though these treaties were not legally binding during either of the two World Wars, the problem has not been a lack of attempted `grappling' as McNamara mistakenly assumes, but rather that in the race between technology and the will to restrain its use, technology won.

Ironically enough, and contrary to many cynical imaginings, advancing technology that might bring a swifter end to a conflict may be a moral endeavor in warfare.  As far back as the American Civil War and the Lieber Code of military conduct, the argument has been explicit ""that the more vigorously wars are pursued, the briefer they will be, and the less humanity will suffer.""  In siege warfare, it was long accepted that responsibility for deaths among the civilian population within the defended town rested squarely with the defending commander.  This principle took shape during World War II by implication when both the British and the Germans evacuated ""non-essential personnel from cities or areas containing military targets[.]""

The Nuremberg trials ultimately made no effort to redefine these customary rules of war; though ""[t]he text of the Nuremberg Charter seemingly invited examination of the legality of German aerial tactics[,]"" ultimately the international tribunal served ""to legitimize both German and Allied bombings directed at civilian populations by failing to define such acts as war crimes.""  The Chief United States Prosecutor at Nuremberg, Colonel Telford Taylor, justified a refusal to bring charges against the Nazis for indiscriminate aerial bombardment:  ""The ruins of German and Japanese cities were the results not of reprisal but of deliberate policy, and bore witness that aerial bombardment of cities and factories has become a recognized part of modern warfare as carried on by all nations.""

In the face of this actual practice, non-binding treaties such as the Hague or efforts between the two World Wars become ""mere humanitarian rhetoric"" and ""legal fantasy.""  Otto Kranzbuehler, defending Admiral Doenitz at Nuremberg from charges of conducting unrestricted submarine warfare, made this very argument: ""I in no way wish to prove or even to maintain that the American Admiralty in its U-boat warfare against Japan broke international law.  On the contrary, I am of the opinion that it acted strictly in accordance with international law.""  Though Doenitz was convicted, sentence was applied only as to other charges -- a mere ""technical success"" according to Col. Taylor -- and a result which seemed to justify ""the decision . . . to avoid allegations [against other defendants at Nuremberg] arising out of aerial warfare[.]""

If Nuremberg affirmed the practice of U.S. fire-bombing against the Japanese, current international criminal law should also decline to retroactively criminalize the actions of McNamara and LeMay; the Rome Statute, for example, strictly adheres to the principle of legality and its logical corollaries: ""[C]ourts may only apply substantive criminal rules that existed at the time of commission of the alleged crime.""  In any case, even if protocols or other potential norms established after World War II and the events in question did apply, ""[t]he U.S. . . . continues to refuse to allow its citizens to be prosecuted by the new International Criminal Court (ICC).""  Perhaps some within the international community might argue that the ICC should make a special exception for McNamara and LeMay, but this leaves us with a war of words beyond the scope of the present discussion.

Given the scope of his guilty conscience, McNamara might still throw himself on the mercy (or the train tracks) of natural law -- a `court' perhaps a step above Nuremberg.  But if self-defense fits squarely within such a rubric, than by what measure do civilians maintain their innocence in the face of industrial society and total war?  As one commentator noted: ""The industrial revolution fully integrated civilians into the industrial war-making capability of their nation.""  Even during the Middle Ages, emerging complexity had begun to erase the practical distinction between combatants and non-combatants.

Aerial drone warfare may reinvigorate this debate, especially the question of whether civilian casualties incident to a drone attack on a combatant are still considered lawful, despite more advanced targeting capabilities.  Whatever the present-day questions, in the case of McNamara, the practical result is certain; by the middle twentieth century and the advent of the nuclear bomb, so far as aerial warfare was concerned, the distinction between combatants and non-combatants was nearly as theoretical as total war itself.

2010985,5,B0001L3LUE,"This documentary is especially compelling for anyone who lived through the 1960s.  McNamara, after all, was the quintessential establishment man and one who had supreme self confidence.  The best modern-day comparable I can think of is Rumsfeld, though McNamara was a lot smarter and more subtle.  Can you imagine Rumsfeld telling all and being confessional in any respect?  The same holds true with McNamara -- which is why seeing him acknowledge mistakes and life lessons is so jarring.  Morris' camera technique, which prompts McNamara to look right into the lens, is a stroke of genius.  The pain in McNamara's eyes is what makes the movie entrancing, and makes one want to watch it again.

McNamara acknowledges the evil of the fire bombing of Tokyo in which he participated as Curtis LeMay's aide, but defends the measure as necessary for doing the ultimate good of ending the war.  He deplores war, but is realistic enough to acknowledge its inevitability and gropes for rules to limit its incidence and effects.  His discussion of the Cuban Missile Crisis is chilling, and is confirmed by recent studies of archival material from the old Soviet Union.  The military pushed for a preemptive raid, and had Nixon won in 1960 that's exactly what we would have done.  But Kennedy's reluctance to do so is vindicated by evidence that Soviet field commanders had tactical nuclear weapons and the authority to launch them into the U.S. mainland.  The raid would have provoked World War III.  McNamara credits a former U.S. Ambassador to the U.S.S.R. for the famous decision to ignore Krushchev's second belligerent telex and respond to his first more accommodating message. McNamara deplores how close we came to nuclear war in the 1960s and acknowledges the simple chilling truth that very rational people are still capable of extraordinarily irrational acts.

On Vietnam, McNamara portrays himself as advising Kennedy on the un-winnability of the war and the need to withdraw all advisors.  Kennedy agreed, though McNamara acknowledges that such a decision is always in flux and capable of revision given the politics at work.  He believes that Kennedy would never have escalated the way Johnson did.  But McNamara does not give any convincing explanation for why policmakers felt compelled to escalate and why he did not take better advantage of the resources that were deployed.  On this latter point, Westmoreland and his war of attrition methods have been the subject of much crticism, which Morris does not touch on in his interview.  Abrams, who replaced Westmoreland after McNamara left, followed a more viable policy of holding territory and building native support.  McNamara's defense that he was a ""good soldier"" following Johnson's escalation order does not address why he did not follow better methods in Vietnam.  This may have been McNamara's most egregious error.

2010988,4,B0001L3LUE,"Even though this documentary doesn't reveal anything shocking or controversial about the man, it is still a decent look at the man who was blamed for the Vietnam War.  But is this a just and fair assessment of the man who for seven years was the Secretary of Defense?

Robert S McNamara sat down in 2003 to talk about his life lessons during such a crucual time in American history.  And even though viewers were hoping to hear regret come out of his mouth reference the Vietnam War, he made this documentary not so much as repentance, but as a warning to the new generation not to get too hopeful with the war in Iraq which by then had already started.  He was 85 years old at the time this was made, and a staunch opponent to the Iraq War only because he knew early on in this war that this war would bog down the administration and become a very unpopular war.

The first 45 minutes are basically McNamara talking about his earlier life and his early time with JFK and the Cuban Missle Crisis, although it skips around after the introduction with snippets of his life before he became SecDef.  His first experience following unpopular orders was his bombing raid over Japan in WWII under the command of General LeMay, who later became a commander in Vietnam.  I get the feeling from watching this that even McNamara himself felt he was not qualified to be JFK's SecDef.  Sure, he had served three years in WWII but when he was picked to be SecDef he was an executive at Ford Motor Company.  He doesn't blame anyone for the disaster that became Vietnam; the country was sucked into it as a result of the Cold War.

There is some archival video here, but most of the time we see the aging man sitting facing the camera delivering a monologue.  A few times Errol Morris, the producer, intercepts him with a question, but it's mostly just one man recounting history. The viewer has a hard time feeling empathy for him because even at his age he is still a confident, perhaps arrogant man.  But there are a few moments around the 1:00 hour mark that his eyes swell up with tears when talking about JFK and his chosen spot in Arlington Cemetery, ""The most beautiful spot of DC.""

This sometimes choppy documentary is clearly McNamara's view of the Vietnam War.  He evades all questions he feels are inflamatory or controversial; that's perhaps from experience and his recall of how he was lambasted by the media in the late 1960s. Despite the lack of any new material, this is still a worthwhile documentary about one man who sent 58,000 American warriors to their deaths and who was loathed for a time being as much as Rumsfeld was in more recent times. Ironically, his voice sounds like that of Rumsfeld and he even resembles him in his younger days.

McNamara died in 2009 and in many ways this production is his swan song.  However, his memoir ""In Retrospect"" may be a bit more satisfying for anyone who wants to understand the deeper anguish of this man during seven very turbulent years of our history. Still, this is a must-view for all who were affected by the Vietnam War.",1306195200,4,3078,4.518918918918919
2010989,5,B0001L3LUE,"I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary of Robert McNamara and was actually quite surprised at some of the things he said.  I found his ""lessons"" that he learned as a result of his experiences during WWII, while at Ford, and then later as SECDEF and the chief architect of America's involvement in Vietnam to be quite insightful.
However, it is unfortunate that those lessons learned as a result of mistakes made during the Vietnam War were at such a high cost to this country. This was McNamara's way of warning us that we should not make those same mistakes again.
I highly recommend ""The Fog of War"" and I hope that those who watch will take his lessons to heart.",1302566400,,664,4.579831932773109

There's no fog in McNamara's startling, emotional, confessional rationalization of his life and involvement in the Vietnam strategy as Secretary of Defense under JFK and Lyndon Johnson.  It is as chilling and riveting as anything I can think of.  Everyone concerned about the globalization of religion and politics should see this searing film about the limited ability of humans to manage and contain threats to security and freedom.

I was a teenager during the Nixon years and I remember the evening news with the Vietnam casualty totals reported like it was the Dow Jones average.  The draft ended just before I turned 18 years of age.  I went on to college and didn't serve in the military...(a reality I regretted later in life when I finally learned what was important to me).  If you are of similar age, you may remember protest attitudes.  Over the years I've ejoyed reading history, and invested some effort reading about the subject of Vietnam.  ""Fire In The Lake"", Karnow's ""Vietnam, A History"", ""The Best and The Brightest"", just to name a few better known books.  And as it turned out in life, I developed friendships with a few military veterans of that era.

Still, I'm no expert on much of anything, but I thought this documentary about McNamara was excellent.  It's put together in a very interesting format that I think would be accessible to even someone unschooled on the subjects covered. And it covers a great deal more subject than just Kennedy/Johnson and southeast Asia.  I could understand criticism that it was an attempt to repair his reputation near the end of his life.

As it continues, it generally becomes an affair of chances, chances from which neither of us is exempt, and whose event we must risk in the dark.

He thinks JFK probably would have gotten out of Vietnam. At 85, when this was made, McNamara was tack sharp, his legendary brain fully intact. He chokes up often, at the mention of JFK's death, at the mention of his family and the deaths in war. This is one of the best docs I've seen in a long time.

2011017,5,B0001L3LUE,"I stumbled onto this DVD while searching for more Vietnam material. I'm glad I did.

Robert McNamara is one of the most engaging people I've ever seen on any screen. He is about 85 yrs old in this documentary yet he is as sharp as a tack. His 11 lessons are born of a life that has seen so much change and he has held many top positions in various industries.

John Kennedy invited him to become Secretary of Defense shortly after his election to President. McNamara gave up a life of lavish wealth to accept.
The majority of the documentary involves his own story telling of his life including his term as SoD and his interactions with the presidents he served under.

Kennedy tended to listen Johnson tended not too. It's fascinating. He recalls serving under General Curtis LeMay in WW II with respect for LeMay but a clear disagreement with his thinking.

During the documentary you can almost see pain on McNamara's face as he recalls the descent into the Vietnam war once Johnson took over after Kennedy was assassinated. From the outset of his term in office, McNamara and Kennedy wanted an exit strategy from Vietnam. Johnson wanted escalation. This almost seems to haunt him as he tells his story.

Watch the documentary, watch McNamara's face, look into his eyes and see a very VERY intelligent human being with so much soul yet there's also pain. He recalls his whole life with such clarity and articulation and his stance and beliefs have never changed as proven by the taped conversations in the White House that play sporadically throughout the documentary.

An amazing man with SUCH a story to tell. I recommend this highly, it's honest,
sometimes brutal and McNamara has the guts to expose his human side to us.",1258329600,3,1727,4.701986754966887

2011019,3,B0001L3LUE,"After Robert McNamara died on July 6, 2009, I revisited ""The Fog of War"" documentary to see if the lapse of time would uncover new insights.

This time, I found that Errol Morris creates a greater impression than is warranted that McNamara and Lyndon Johnson are making life-and-death decisions in a bungling, indecisive, and backroom manner, almost like two guys making policy in a bar.  As if an anti-hero in the panoply of military commanders, Johnson comes across as a hayseed, fretful about possible criticism from the emerging counter-culture power base within his party, yet unable to commit to a whatever-it-takes military strategy to defeat the enemy.  Shouldn't Morris have protectively edited out Johnson's hot-button ignorance of the good/well distinction?

Unlike Morris, Jonah Goldberg seems to find the seeds of America's military wishy-washiness in our refusal to help the French volunteers at Dien Bien Phu in 1954:  ""Had Eisenhower supported the French requests to use our bombers based in the Philippines to bomb around Dien Bien Phu, Ho Chi Minh may have not been able to form a government. To his shame, Eisenhower refused to do it unless he had support from all the Congressional leaders, and Lyndon Johnson (to his greater shame) did not support it.""  Will no one tally the lives lost in the years following such weakness?  Couldn't we just as easily argue that front-end ruthlessness costs a few high-profile lives (the more dramatic, the greater the deterrence) but actually saves countless lives in the long run?

For example, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, heading a monarchy begun in 1501, was brought down in 1979, with the tacit support of President Jimmy Carter, who has never acknowledged the cost in blood and suffering and a weaker West that followed in the wake of his decision not to back the Shah.

Robert McNamara seems to follow in the footsteps of George C. Marshall, both of whom seem to be models of the preferred military decision-maker today: logistical, operational planners who read data sheets to move armies logically and methodically.  Though this type of thinking has always been necessary to fight a war successfully, it seems very contemporary that we elevate its strategic role in the leadership hierarchy.  But should the computer-girded quartermaster be turned into a policy implementer?

Film director Errol Morris is at his best when he makes Robert McNamara the foil of Curtis LeMay.  McNamara's  Harvard think-tank stint as AAF analytical advisor in the early 40s, followed by his service in AAF's Office of Statistical Control, gave him a life-long (though grudging) respect for LeMay.  As McNamara describes,

  ""The U.S. was just beginning to bomb. We were bombing by daylight. The loss rate was very, very high, so they commissioned a study. And what did we find? We found the abort rate was 20%. 20% of the planes that took off to bomb targets in Germany turned around before they got to their target. Well that was a hell of a mess? we lost 20% of our capability right there.
  ""The form, I think it was form 1--A or something like that was a mission report. And if you aborted a mission you had to write down `why.' So we get all these things and we analyze them, and we finally concluded it was baloney. They were aborting out of fear.
  ""Because the loss rate was 4% per sortie, the combat tour was 25 sorties--it didn't mean that 100% of them were going to be killed but a hell of a lot of them were going to be killed. They knew that and they found reasons to not go over the target. So we reported this.
  ""One of the commanders was Curtis LeMay--Colonel in command of a B--24 group. He was the finest combat commander of any service I came across in war. But he was extraordinarily belligerent, many thought brutal. He got the report. He issued an order. He said, 'I will be in the lead plane on every mission. Any plane that takes off will go over the target, or the crew will be court--marshaled.' The abort rate dropped over night.""

LeMay seems to come across as having the now-lost profile of leadership that might actually win a war.  Even McNamara sensed that the firebombing of Tokyo, with the unfortunate death of 100,000 not-so-innocent civilians, was a necessary ""overkill"" tactic to get Japan to give up the war, thus saving a million or more combatants (on both sides) in later battles and a planned invasion of the Japanese homeland.  It's strange that the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is often seen differently.",1250899200,,4518,4.8261997405966275
2011020,5,B0001L3LUE,"The Bottom Line:

One has to wonder if sometimes Mr. McNamara is deliberately telling things from a perspective that will make his own involvement in the events discussed more palatable, but that quibble aside it cannot be denied that The Fog of War is a fascinating film recommended to anyone interested in 20th Century U.S. History; it's not likely to disappoint you.

2011021,3,B0001L3LUE,"""11 lessons"" is a list documentary filmmaker Errol Morris came up with. These include:
1. Empathize with your enemy
2. Rationality will not save us
3. There's something beyond one's self
4. Maximize efficiency
5. Proportionality should be a guideline in war
6. Get the data
7. Belief and seeing are often both wrong
8. Be prepared to reexamine your reasoning
9. In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil
10. Never say never
11. You can't change human nature

So one of ""the best and brightest"" didn't know this before waging war?! Oh my god. McNamara added 10 more ""lessons"" which are included in the DVD extras.

The production quality is excellent. Errol Morris is a fine filmmaker. And I find watching a true war criminal sit there while answering questions, at times looking into the camera, an interesting experience. But I didn't learn anything from this portrait of an American Eichmann who is partly responsible for the deaths of countless millions. McNamara is way too easily let off the hook here folks. And what is more troubling is that viewers of ""The Fog of War"" are given the strong illusion they are seeing a clearer picture of history than they are. But how much do you know? Some reading in addition to the film would be useful. As an experiment, and I think for a clearer picture of McNamara, read journalist Alexander Cockburn's article on the CounterPunch website as supplemental material to the film. Please feel free to leave comments explaining to me why or how Cockburn is wrong and what is so useful about ""The Fog of War"". As for the title, Cockburn has an interesting explanation of the origins of this tired cliche. A truly educational doc on McNamara would have informed the viewer of much information included in Cockburn's ""McNamara: From the Tokyo Firestorm to the World Bank"". See for yourself. The snapshots of everything from McNamara's participation in WW2 under the psychotic LeMay and the firebombing of Tokyo, to his career at Ford and supposed effort to promote automobile safety, to his position as Secretary of Defense in the Kennedy and LBJ Administrations and ghastly role in slaughter of millions of Vietnamese and Americans is ""foggy"" at best. The film is supposedly about learning from war but his long tenor as head of the World Bank and the failed policies which he implemented are not covered. He smoothly transitioned from role as War manager to head of World Bank where he did much to aid Third World dictators and destroy the lives of peasants. McNamara lived to the ripe old age of 93 and never paid for his crimes.",1246924800,6,2580,4.743875278396437
2011022,5,B0001L3LUE,"The number of rarities that needed to come together for this film to work as well as it does is as mind-boggling as the content. As citizens of a country, we always wish we could enter the mind of those in power or those working with those in power, but we know we never can, because we know that all those in power are secretive and hide their true opinions, most of the time for security reasons or to cover their guilt. So that McNamara opened up like this is the first incredible offering of the film. That he revealed not just the facts but his emotions towards them is the second. This is a man that either has not let his guilt blind him or at least is using this film opportunity to transcend his guilt. Combine this with the music and visual hypnotic craftsmanship of Philip Glass and Erol Morris, and this is a must see political film.

This is the story of Robert McNamara: the brightest and the best of his or any age who found himself villified beyond what was reasonable or deserving. Still, he calmly made no excuses while talking candidly about doing what needed to be done. ""We killed fifty-thousand men, women and children in one night over Tokyo,"" he said with a straight face. This is a great film and as close a look at one of the men who lived in the midst of the greatest focal points of the century you'll ever see.",1241827200,2,784,4.451388888888889
2011034,5,B0001L3LUE,"This BBC / PBS -like political biographical documentary film shows how US Presidential cabinets are formed and the impact of decisions on foreign affairs at the highest level. Director Errol Morris portrays 85-yr old Robert McNamara, then Secretary of Defense for 7 years during partial JFK and LBJ terms (61-68, fired just after the Tet Offensive). Dialog and supporting screenplay maintains a sensitive, dramatic, and interesting talking head portrait for 1 1/2 hrs on DVD. The brilliantly crafted retrospective McNamara's involvement in the WWII (41-45), Korean and Cold (47-91) and Vietnam War (59-75) 35-yrs ago against the communist arch-nemeses PRChina and USSR within the context of the SE Asian Domino theory.

The Errol Morris film won the 2004 Oscar for best documentary. Box office gross was $5M. Having also read the book with same title by Blight and Lang, this Reviewer strongly recommends the DVD over the book, as the book contains less than half of McNamara's theses.

To date, over 14 Sec'ty of Defense have shaped world conflicts within 9 administrations; JBJ, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, GHW Bush, Clinton, GW Bush and Obama; covering troops in Somalia (92-95), Yugoslavia (93-96), Afganistan (01-pres), and Iraq (03-pres), among scores of other conflict involving less than a thousand troops or 25 aircraft. The CIA has covert actions that are on-going in the PLO, Iran and Venezuela. (Ref: Wiki List_of_United_States_military_history_events and also CIA_sponsored_regime_change)

Clearly the hot seat has been on successive SECDEFs Melvin Laird and Jim Schlesinger during the defeat of the Vietnam War; Dick Cheney and Bill Perry during Somalia and Yugoslavia; and Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates during Afghanistan and Iraq.

As the US / Obama is currently trying to recover from a major global recession, viewing this retrospective would give insights on the dilemma that faces the current cabinet and policy towards Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea. After witnessing Obama's first 100 days, his tour in E Euro and Latin America and Sec'ty of State Clinton in Mexico, the Middle and Far East shows that this is a major policy shift from the 8-yr former G.W. Bush administration, including SECDEF Donald Rumsfeld and SECSTATE Condoleezza Rice.

So far SECDEF Robert Gates is going along with the draw down of Iraq with a simultaneous increase in Afghanistan. Advanced technology with use of remotely controlled drone surveillance and combat aircraft will reduce the number of troops in harms way.

-----

What was especially poignant in the film is the admission that Army Air Corp General LeMay and SECDEF McNamara could have been charged as War Criminals if the US had lost the war. Both sanctioned fire-bombing of more than 60 of Japan's entire cities taking military targets and factories, as well as civilian commercial and residential districts in-toto, totaling over a quarter million civilians deaths. The two atomic bomb deaths include an additional quarter million civilians.

Below are McNamara's on truths and lessons. If you have a fast internet connection, you can view the following video clips of movie using the YouTube URL address.

#1 Empathize with Your Enemy (Scene 4, 0:06, wOoOcIFhaoA)  Nuclear missiles in Cuba

#2 Rationality Will Not Save Us  (Scene 6, 0:16)

#3 There's something beyond one's self (Scene 9 0:25) b1916, end of WWI, flu epidemic, went to college during Depression, Cal BA, Economics; Harvard, Grad Sch Biz. Joined Prof Harvard.

#4 Maximize efficiency (Scene 11, 0:30)

Attended OCS at Harvard. In USArmy Air Corps for 3yrs. Prepared WWII R&D in Pacific. Abort Mission report, pilot fear. WWII B-29 bombing over Japan, with 58th bomb wing from India, Burma. LeMay moves airfield to Mariana Islands, Guam, Saipan, Tinian. Target Destruction efficiency. Fire bombing of Tokyo 100K civilians, looses one Wingman.

#5 Proportionality shouldn't be a guideline in War (Scene 13, 0:39, PzUStZaTGAQ).

Incendiary bombs of Tokyo, Yokohama, Toyama, Nagoya, and 60 other cities. The nuclear bomb under LeMay command and Truman. McNamara contracted polio on VJ Day.

#6 Get the Data  (Scene 16, 0:48)

Ford no college grads (Life Magazine) created Ford Mktg Research Dept, devel budget cars against Volkwagen and GM /Cadillac. Start crash protecting cars with Cornell Aeronautical Labs, packaging, intro seatbelts.

Robert F Kennedy, (contract, no DC Society scene commitment, Sec'ty Defense $25K/yr), personal sacrifice leaving Ford.

Return from S Vietnam review 1963 with 16K Advisors, military coup Diem and Kennedy assassination. Ironically Kennedy was escorted by DC's National Cemetery Groundkeeper couple weeks before; McNamara picked same spot (tears). Newly elevated Pres L.B. Johnson, with lack of VN understanding, continued under the SE Asia Domino theory by China in 1964.

#7 Belief and Seeing are Both Often Wrong (Scene 18, 1:05, pbJLwk-bJaA, W5j0r4QyZeo)

NVN Gun boats vs Destroyer Maddox DD731 suspect torpedo attacks near Haiphong in Aug 1964. Analysis of sonar recordings eventually show wrong conclusion; this was just a pretext to engage. Retaliation from NVN aggression results in 64 bombing missions against NVN. We see what we want to believe. Tonkin Gulf Resolution, Congress approval to engage Sept 64. Johnson authorizes ""Rolling Thunder"" bombing B-57s. Marine deployment 10Jun1965, 45K men, 10 battalions.

#8 Be Prepared to Re-examine Your Reasoning  (Scene 21, 1:20, PnfI-lW_asw)

In a 1995 retrospective, McNamara asked NVN Generals what were goals for 1968 Tet Offensive; independence from CN, FR, and Amer colonialists. VN was in a Civil War to unify the country under Ho Chi Minh.

#9 In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil  (Scene 23, 1:25, LxntnXjfG4I)  Moral good is a tough decision.

#10 Never say never (Scene 25, 1:30).  Never answer the question that was asked of you. Answer the question that you would have wished had been asked of you. Start Operation Birmingham Nov 67, Lexington, etc; with 500K troops, 25K KIA

#11 You can't change human nature. (Scene 27, 1:39) One makes errors in judgment.",1240790400,,6122,5.309844559585493

2011036,4,B0001L3LUE,"Few figures in our shared history hold such a tragic place as Robert S. McNamara who served during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.  Even fewer ever manage to find redemption.  Here, in this very well-made documentary, Mr. McNamara does exactly that---finds redemption as he carefully analyzes the situation as it then existed between the U.S. and Vietnam, takes an honest look in the mirror (at his personal role in the foreign policy committments of the period), and shares his thoughts with us, the American public.  And that is what's striking: there are so few people in politics who would ever examine the course taken and PUBLICALLY address mistakes that had been made: this is what we did, this is why we did it, these are the results of the actions we took, and---hindsight always being clearer than what we experience ""in the moment""---this is what we can learn from the past.  It is in this last respect, in learning from the past, where the subject of this caring documentary shines as extraordinarily valuable!

The raw honesty of the situation should commend Mr. McNamara to anyone willing to listen.  Not because he asks us for forgiveness---because he wants us to learn from it, to gain understanding.  Mr. McNamara realizes that the past has something to offer us.  And we should give well-deserved applause to the director, Errol Morris, for a job very well done.  His contribution to our understanding of a terribly difficult period in American history is invaluable.",1236038400,,1494,4.991935483870968
2011037,5,B0001L3LUE,"Errol Morris has done a service to history by getting McNamara to candidly talk about his life experiences and the lessons he has gleamed from them. By letting McNamara do most of the talking, Morris avoids introducing any bias or pronouncing judgment on his subject. The accompanying soundtrack is one of the best I have seen in a historical documentary with a particularly haunting quality and complements the cut scenes very well.

At a particular point in his narrative, McNamara talks about the assassination of JFK and how he got around to selecting the final resting place of the President in Arlington National Cemetery. As he ruminates over those dark days of Nov 1963, you notice that he fogs up. Long disparaged as an impersonal number crunching automaton, this moment offers the viewer a rare direct look at the all too human side of McNamara.

Other reviewers before me have done a great job in discussing the merits and demerits of this documentary. Suffice for me to say that the 11 lessons are universal and well applied to any situation whether in business or war. The one that has lingered with me the longest is the first one - ""Empathize with your Enemy"". After watching this documentary, we empathize with McNamara too and understand the mindset that drove all of his actions. McNamara has done well to share his lessons with reasonable frankness and objectivity. This ultimately is his penance.",1233273600,2,1416,4.895833333333333

He has great insight into what happened and why it happened.  He admits mistakes were made and that he had to support things he did not feel comfortable with also.  In dealing with Castro, he found a man who would have allowed the use of nuclear weapons even if Cuba had been destroyed.  With the North Vietnamese, he found people who thought the Americans were colonizers and mystified by the idea that Americans thought the Vietnamese were pawns of the Chinese.  One look at their history would have told them that was not so!  MacNamara does not flinch from mistakes but he also doesn't believe that things could have gone any other way.  He points out what Americans believed and how they thought at the time.  He admits that hindsight helps him understand a lot now but he certainly didn't have it when events were happening.

2011040,4,B0001L3LUE,"Director Errol Morris starts his DVD by questioning Robert McNamara, the only person in view. McNamara begins to reminisce over his decades of experience. This is where the eleven lessons begin. Considering the political and military course of action the United States has taken in the past eight years, some of these lessons should be bronzed, and prominently displayed. Here are the ones that stuck most in my memory:

Empathize with your enemy.

Critics mistake empathy for sympathy or appeasement--a word most often misused. It means neither. Understanding your enemy is one of the most important things in defeating your enemy, or not engaging him in the first place. The example given by McNamara was the one person during the Cuban missile crisis who knew Premier Nikita Khruschev. He was the only one who counselled JFK against getting tougher with the Soviets. He knew that the US had to throw a political bone to Khruschev so that he would look tough against the Americans, at least to the hard core communists in the Politburo. It worked and nuclear war was averted.

Rationality will not save us.

There is a mistaken assumptions that if you gather rational people in one place to think rationally, they will always make the best decision or come up with the best course of action. According to McNamara, even rational people can make egregious errors in judgment.

Proportionality should be a guideline in war.

A lack of proportional response will not only get innocents killed, it will also kill our own.  Nothing should be overkill. (As the ancient Greeks said, nothing in excess; everything in moderation.)

Belief and Seeing are both often wrong.

The wisdom in this one had perhaps the most profound effect on me. This should be self-explanatory. From what we believe and even see, we can still draw incorrect conclusions e.g. while we were searching for weapons of mass destruction, Washington signalled our forces that there were caves in a mountain where Iraqi missiles might be hidden. They turned out to be places to store water for cattle.

Be prepared to reexamine your reasoning,

especially if believing and seeing are both often wrong. It took sixteen centuries for someone to actually challenge Galen's idea of bloodletting.

In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil.

This is a Machiavellian reference to war. But Mr. McNamara raised the following question: How much evil must we do in order to do good? This made me revisit my belief that the US was justified in dropping the atomic bombs on Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Was this too much evil? Would we really have had to invade Japan if we didn't drop the bomb? Be prepared to reexamine your reasoning if you have no doubt that this would have been necessary.

You can't change human nature.

Reason has limits according to the former Secretary of Defense. Back in the days, one of my hippie friends reasoned that no one would die if everyone just got rid of their guns. This was an oversimplification of human nature, but still recognizable in many ways today. We cannot force people to like things our way, or what value what we hold dear. It is not their nature.

Near the end, Mr. McNamara quotes T.S. Eliot: ""We shall not cease from exploring and at the end of our exploration we will return to where we started and know the place for the first time."" This sums up the ""Fog of War.""

This was a worthwhile viewing (rather than buying) for the above lessons I hope I will remember for the rest of my life. The only disappointment was Secretary McNamara's vagueness or refusal to discuss some of the more controversial decisions  and issues of his life. He was very thoughtful of John F. Kennedy, and still wept in relating the event. He was also thoughtful of his wife who died several years ago. I got the impression that he is a lonely man who has made peace with himself and his demons.

This will give you  some clear insights.

2011041,3,B0001L3LUE,"McNamara is clearly spinning history and running from his ghosts. I once read that he was known for simply making up any 'facts' he needed.

His comment in the film that ""None  of our allies supported us (in Vietnam)"" would come as a surprise to South Korea,Thailand,Australia,New Zealand and the Philippines - all of whom had troops in Vietnam.

He claims to have opposed the consensus of military leaders to bomb Cuba during the missile crisis, but then goes along with them for their recommendations of the conduct of the Vietnam war - saying later that he should have spoken up. This is a man who wants to have it both ways - and always be on the right side in the judgment of history - or so he thinks.

His reflections on the bombing of Japan are also somewhat curious. He neglects to mention that the Japanese civilians were warned by the US Air Force to evacuate 26 cities - but their leadership cynically dispersed the wartime industries into the residential areas and kept the civilians there. The Japanese government was to blame for what happened to their civilians - just as they were to blame for war crimes committed by Japanese troops. Taking events out of historical context - as McNamara frequently does - is the mark of someone who is trying to explain away actions at the time in order to conform to current political correctness.

The documentary is technically excellent - but having other voices to contradict McNamara on his many self-serving statements would have added more context and additional depth to the work. But that is solely (and correctly) the editorial judgment of the filmmaker.

All in all - an interesting soliloquy from McNamara, who was a participant in many of the events that have shaped our times.",1226361600,4,1743,4.735973597359736
2011042,5,B0001L3LUE,"Errol Morris came to fame in the late 1980s with his anti-police corruption documentary The Thin Blue Line, and has spent the last couple decades gracing cinephiles with controversial, yet distinguished, films. Last year's Oscar-winning documentary The Fog Of War: Eleven Lessons From The Life Of Robert S. McNamara is his best yet, and one of the best films- documentary or not- ever made. It works as a history of the American Military of the last 50 years, and a personal portrait of ex-Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, architect of the Vietnam War, not to mention a philosophical foray into the nature of man and evil.
  Yet, delineated as those 3 points are, the film is not dogmatic. McNamara is not portrayed as sympathetic, although sometimes he elicits sympathy- his love and loss felt at the murder of JFK, nor dogmatic, although his actions in the film and out belie that, and led to his being fired by LBJ. Morris takes an effective tack by parsing the film as 11 lessons from McNamara- a very Oriental approach to a life. This is also reflected in the fact that the film rarely answers questions, in the general or specific, rather intent on making its viewers think. Great art usually provokes queries, not smoothes with answers.
  Thus the film's essence and its title, which refers to the chaotic complexity, therefore unpredictability, inherent in war.
This film has got to be the shortest 105 minutes in film history for, if the deleted scenes (culled from over 20 hours of interviews) are any clue this film should more properly have been a PBS miniseries. There are probably only a literal dozen or so films that will have relevance and cogence in 1000 years. This is one of them. Watch it. Understand it. Absorb it. If you don't you are likely to be as regretful as its prime subject.",1221782400,,1807,4.763578274760383
2011043,5,B0001L3LUE,"The brilliance of this documentary is Morris's decision to just let McNamara talk, with minimal prompting.  He talks about the Vietnam War, the killing of innocent civilians and the death and maiming of our American soldiers as though he were a mathematician or an accountant attempting to solve a complex algebraic formula.  He exhibits a chilling detachment of decision from consequence.

The only time he weeps is when he recalls JFK's assassination.  He never seems to see a connection between that tragic loss of life and all of the lives he destroyed as Secretary of Defense.  No tears for the Vietnamese dead, nor even for US dead and wounded soldiers; no emotion at all.  The Vietnamese dead, civilian and military, are merely widgets that have to be destroyed as efficiently as possible.  To McNamara, US dead and wounded are merely casualties of war, and would surely be minimized by his cocksure solutions to his algebraic calculations.

It is chilling to watch him reminisce.  His resignation from the Johnson administration was not due to feelings of guilt, of which he seems quite incapable, but because his calculations were incorrect. His rationalizations are many and self-serving, but it all still comes down to the math for him.

The only reason he has never been tried as a war criminal is because the US did not have to surrender.  Brought before a Nuremberg-style tribunal, one gets the feeling that he would be baffled at even being charged with war crimes.  One can envision his incapability of understanding the criminal immorality of his decisions.  How can the amoral understand the immoral?

So if he did not end up before a war crimes tribunal, what happened to him?  LBJ appointed him to the presidency of the World Bank, to help third world countries like Vietnam try to improve their economies.  What a sad and macabre irony was the luxurious fate of a green visor war criminal juxtaposed against the fate of the massive number of ""body counts"" (""people"", in plain English) that he caused.

Of all the Vietnam War policymakers, David Halberstam, author of the ""Best and the Brightest"", had a special contempt for McNamara.  I remember seeing Halberstam on a talk show (Dick Cavett's?) years ago.  He proposed the most fitting punishment for McNamara; that he be sentenced to clean the bed pans of wounded Vietnam vets at Walter Reed Hospital for the rest of his life. Many would second a motion to that effect.

Eleven lessons? Not really. The one true lesson of this documentary is to pray that another McNamara, employed by a foreign power at war with the U.S., is not in a position to coldly ""calculate"" the mathematical odds of killing you, without reference to his or her own humanity.",1221264000,6,2722,4.876086956521739
2011044,4,B0001L3LUE,"In the normal course of events former high level bureaucrats in  American presidential administrations usually save their attempts at self-justification  for high ticket published memoirs or congenial `softball' speaking tours and conferences. In short, they prefer to preach to the choir at retail prices. Apparently, former Kennedy and Johnson Administration Cold Warrior extraordinaire Secretary of War Robert Strange McNamara felt that such efforts were not enough and hence he had to go before the cameras in order to whitewash his role in the history of his times. Despite an apparent agreement with his interviewer not to cover certain subjects and be allowed to present his story his way it is always good to catch a view of how the other side operates. It ain't pretty.

After a lifetime of relative public silence, at the age of 85, McNamara decided to give his take on events in which he was a central figure like dealing with the fact of American imperial military superiority in the post- World War II period, dealing with the Russians and the fight for American nuclear superiority during the Cold War, the illi-conceived Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, the later Cuban Missile crisis and above all his role in the escalation of the wars in Southeast Asia, primarily Vietnam.

Very little here focuses on his time at the World Bank, a not unimportant omission that would highlight my point that he might have changed his clothing in the course of his career but not his mindset. While those of us interested in learning the lessons of history have long understood that to know the political enemy is the beginning of wisdom one will not find much here that was not infinitely better covered by the late journalist David Halberstam in his classic The Best and The Brightest.

McNamara has chosen to present his story in the form of parables, or rather, little vignettes about the `lessons' to be drawn from experiences. Thus, we are asked to sit, embarrassingly,  through McNamara's Freshman course in revisionist history as he attempts to take himself from the cold-hearted Cold Warrior and legitimate `war criminal' to the teddy-bearish old man who has learned something in his life- after a lifetime of treachery.

In the end, if one took his story at face value, one could only conclude that he was just trying to serve his bosses the best way he could and if things went wrong it was their fault. Nothing new there, though. Henry Kissinger has turned that little devise into an art form. Teary-eyed at the end McNamara might be as he acknowledges his role in the mass killings of his time, but beware of a wolf in sheep's clothing.

2011050,4,B0001L3LUE,"Director Errol Morris is noted for the numerous documentaries he has made over the years. Well researched and made with an objective viewpoint, he does what a true documentary film maker does. He assembles previous footage, shoots his own footage, conducts interviews and assembles it all to tell a story. Sometimes, as in the case of THE THIN BLUE LINE, he tries to make the viewer see the truth in what his film is about. But more to the point, he does this without setting someone up or trying to make someone look bad, without ridiculing someone in an attempt to make a point. Because of this, Morris deserved the recognition he received this past year as FOG OF WAR went home with the best documentary prize at the Oscars.

The film is a look back at Robert McNamara, past Secretary of Defense under both Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. Some background about his life is offered, his family, his schooling and such, but for the most part, Morris wants to focus on his time under these two presidents and their involvement in the Vietnam War. Morris never attacks McNamara nor presents him as the cause of the way and our involvement in it. Instead, he presents a man who sincerely wanted out and whose advice was ignored.

The film is told in chapters, its title letting you know that at the beginning since the full title is FOG OF WAR: ELEVEN LESSONS FROM THE LIFE OF ROBERT S. McNAMARA. Each chapter moves in a progression as McNamara tells of the events in his life that formed him, from his time in the military during WW II through his recent past. The lessons that he has learned and tries to somewhat impart here are ones that everyone should follow, especially those in power.

McNamara was there during the missiles of October event, when we stared straight into the eye of the Russians and Cubans and said we were ready to go to war if need be. But his insight into this situation here is fascinating, helping the viewer to realize just exactly how close we came to all out nuclear war. And in his manner of presenting this fact, McNamara lets us know that he felt we would never have completely recovered from such a devastating event.

A majority of the film focuses on Vietnam. Recently released White House tapes made by both presidents are included here as we get a behind the scene glimpse of how the office works. While Kennedy values his advice and counsel, Johnson seemed to have taken him on only due to his being there when he took office. The fact that both men respected McNamara is evident as is McNamara's regret of having not removed America from Vietnam sooner.

Morris is a fantastic film maker, always letting the subject of his films speak out rather than forcing them to do so. His combination of archival footage with current interviews, his use of music and editing techniques have always made him a force to be reckoned with in the field. But it is his choice to give the viewer a glimpse into those subjects unfiltered that makes his films more real than those of any documentary film maker today.

While this film may not seem entertaining to most it is enlightening and informative. You walk away having a newfound respect for McNamara. And if you don't recall or remember the name, you find yourself wanting to discover more about him. And isn't that the objective of a documentary film maker? To draw the viewer into wanting to know more? Morris does that with ease. Let's hope he continues to do so.",1205366400,,3445,4.59349593495935
2011051,4,B0001L3LUE,"The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara (Errol Morris, 2003)

What stuns me about The Fog of War is that Robert S. McNamara, unlike so many of Errol Morris' subjects, does not come off a moron. Rather the contrary.

When you go into an Errol Morris film, you can be sure of what you're getting. Morris' directorial style is one of transparency (and, as Billy Wilder said, the best director is the one you don't notice); he sits back, lets the subject talk, and things take their course. Almost every time, the subject finds a way to make himself out to be a complete idiot. Whether it's coincidence that Morris often films some of the most hated people on the planet, or people in the most hated professions on the planet (in the case of the short-lived and highly underrated series First Person), I don't know. After all, most of us are morons.

McNamara, on the other hand, is very composed throughout. If he's not entirely honest the whole time (and for all we know, he might not be), he at least comes off as someone who's earnest and unapologetic-- someone who stood up for the things in which he believed in the face of a government who were committed to stupidity. (Unlike many reviewers, I didn't see the ""I am not responsible, but will accept responsibility"" bit as evasion; I saw it as a grand ""up yours"" to society. ""This ain't my mess, but you're going to blame me anyway. Why should I care?"".) We're all well aware that Robert McNamara made mistakes during the Vietnam War. We're all well aware that he made decisions based on incomplete, or erroneous, data. (Those are far different from mistakes.) That it was too late to do him any good when he learned of, and from, those mistakes, is irrelevant. It seems to me that the point being made by McNamara-- and, by extension, by Morris-- is that the real tragedy here is that no one else, especially no one in the current administration, has learned from Robert McNamara's mistakes, either. ****",1205107200,,1984,4.567415730337078

However, I was disappointed to learn that neither Mr. McNamara nor his ""whiz kids"" took any responsibility for the initial failure of the early version of the M-16 assault rifle. In earlier versions, this rifle fouled easily in the tropical climate of Viet Nam. Stories of American soldiers dying with cleaning rods in their hands,trying to clean their weapons because they would no longer fire were very distressing. Suggestions were made by soldiers to have the chamber chrome-plated fell on deaf ears; McNamara and the ""whiz kids"" thought if the manufacturer felt it needed a chrome-plated chamber, they would have made the rifle that way. This attitude is nothing short of arrogant. It is reminicent of the early failures of the Mark 14 torpedo during WWII.
  In a responsible position such as Secretary of Defense, one would think that such a person could realize that improvements can be made to military hardware, especially when the suggestions come from the soldiers who have to rely on the weapon they are required to carry to defend their lives.",1204588800,,1100,5.038461538461538
2011053,5,B0001L3LUE,"I was highly impressed with this documentary film and would strongly recommend it to those who are interested in history, the Cold War, warfare, government policy, and philosophy. It is extremely broad and has considerable depth of concept. It certainly well deserved the Academy Award for Best Documentary.

The eleven lessons acted as an armature that allowed Robert McNamara to cover a broad range of topics including the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the fire bombing of Japan, the initiation of the war in Vietnam (which McNamara orchestrated) and the escalation of the war in Vietnam (which McNamara resisted).

Those who would view this film seeking to find a guilty McNamara who confesses to some feelings of guilt should look elsewhere. For as the film explains so well, the vast number of unknown forces and decision makers create an atmosphere which he calls the 'fog of war' where the best possible decisions are made at the time even though intelligence is poor, information and data is lacking, and perspective and reflection is not obtainable. McNamara also reminds us of the Cold War mentality that influenced every piece of information, every diplomatic conversation, and every military consideration.  McNamara tells of his growing misgivings as the death tolls reached 25,000 and a clear conceptualization of the war had not yet been formulated outside of Cold War domino theory rhetoric. This theory did not fit the intense purpose of the North Vietnamese or the corrupt military government in South Vietnam. McNamara clearly indicates that Lyndon Johnson's political instincts and unwillingness to become vulnerable resulted in escalation of the war, all of which just made him more politically vulnerable. McNamara tells of his resignation which many felt was actually a forced termination by President Johnson. The war continues to escalate until 58,000 Americans die and President Johnson decides not to run for re-election in the face of a growing national storm against this failed, confused, and unclear mission.

The eleven lessons evoked certain themes which I will explore next:

Empathy and the ability to empathize with the enemy is critical to having a full perspective on the competition or conflict. This means trying to see the nature of the conflict from the perspective of your opponent. McNamara says we never were able to fully comprehend the perspective of the North Vietnamese. We saw the war as a chapter in the larger Cold War, a war with Communism. North Vietnam seemed to be an agent of the Communists. They on the other hand saw the USA as simply an imperial power that had decided to dominate Vietnam in the future as France had dominated Vietnam in the past. Both perspectives were tragically flawed. The Vietnamese saw themselves as engaging in a Civil War for national unification and they saw themselves as highly independent from the Russians and especially the Chinese, with whom they had fought for over 1000 years.

McNamara also points out that rationality will not save you from human error and failure. He illustrates how following a completely rational string of conclusions can be faulty as more and more erroneous information or stereotypical thinking enters the mix. Here he offers an interesting story about the Cuban Missile Crisis. As this crisis quickly escalated, the White House received two messages from the Kremlin. The first was soft and philosophical and appeared to come from Khrushchev. It asks for reflection and consideration before both sides pull the strings so tight that a knot develops that can not be untied. Then soon afterward another message arrives that appears to come from the top hard line military leaders which is hostile and threatening.  Many in the White House advised President Kennedy to respond to the second with equal force. However Tommy Thompson, the former US ambassador in Russia, urged Kennedy to find a way for Khrushchev to save face. The way to allow him to save face would be for the Russians to remove their warheads but to be able to say to the world that Russia saved Cuba from destruction by the USA.  McNamara also points out that despite rationality, human error in any system may bring about unwanted and terrible results.

McNamara also stresses efficiency as a guiding principle. Of course he was a whiz kid who became the first person other than a Ford family member to be the President of Ford Motors. McNamara links efficiency to the fire bombing of Japan's cities. This was a fascinating and frightening portion of this film.  McNamara tells of the highly effective fire bombing of 67 Japanese cities, destroying 50 to 90 percent of these cities. These were major cities the size of Cleveland, Memphis, Nashville, Birmingham, Mobile, Charleston, Miami.  The fact that the Japanese government would not surrender in the face of such death and destruction was amazing. McNamara tells of General Curtis LeMay's willingness to inflict great damage on the enemy using the most efficient means at his disposal. It sounds terrible and cruel but in fact may have shortened the war and thus brought an end to all the death. This discussion overlays McNamara's other point that sometimes to do good, one must do evil. He tells of the manner in which Curtis LeMay made decisions and related back to the burning of Atlanta by General Sherman.

McNamara points out that there are really no rules of war and that the losing side is frequently charged with war crimes but not the winning side. He relates that the fire bombing of Japan and the atomic bombs could have been viewed as war crimes if the Japanese had won the war. War crime is highly dependent on whether you are a winner or loser. However McNamara indicates that in conflict there should be some sense of proportionality that helps guide decision making and guide the extent of strike and retaliation.

McNamara points out that data is essential but then gives examples where seeing and believing were both wrong even when leadership thought they had the data they needed for decision making. This leads to a discussion regarding the need for correct information and clear objectives upon entering into warfare. In this regard the film certainly is relevant to the neo-conservatives that lead the US into the current war in Iraq.

McNamara urges flexibility of thought which he expresses as re-examination of your reasoning and a willingness to change course of action rather than stubbornly moving forward despite evidence that things are not working as expected.

Unfortunately wisdom is a result of painful error and is far different from knowledge. It is the nature of the human condition that we are only blessed with a limited number of painful events on which to build wisdom and often we pass away before applying that wisdom in the world. The story of McNamara is larger that the Cold War or the Vietnamese War. It is the story of the limitations of the human condition.",1204416000,2,6957,5.00086430423509

2011065,5,B0001L3LUE,"This documentary was so gripping and deep, I watched it twice in the same day. McNamara begins with his experiences as a young statistician working under LeMay during World War II. He explains the cold approaches (e.g. firebombing) devised to destroy Japan's ability to wage war. Interleaved are reflections on his personal life, which give the viewer an often unseen side of the man often labeled ""An IBM Machine with Legs"". We are given an inside look into the decision making processes that led to the onset and resolution of the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis as well as a detailed account of the Vietnam War. He spent a significant part of his later life as an ex-SECDEF retrospectively reflecting on the major events in which he played a major part. Decades later he visits leaders of Cuba and Vietnam to learn more about the thinking and rationale of the actions of the other side.

While one might dismiss McNamara given the vast number of American and Vietnamese that died while he was SECDEF, it was moving for him to show humility. His broad and deep recognition of his biggest mistakes is an important milestone for the history of leaders of the Defense Department. Hopefully other leaders follow and admit their mistakes and demand current leaders not go down the wrong path again.

Another reviewer is correct in noting the framing of his lessons are a bit arbitrary. Some lessons overlap (""Rationality will not save us"" and ""You can't change human nature.""), some are too general (""Get the Data""), some are too specific, and taken together, they are certainly not complete (""Avoid killing"" seems like a good lesson). However, if you relate each one to the war in Iraq, you get the sense that the current administration could have done much better in their analysis and subsequent handling of the war.",1202601600,,1825,4.808917197452229

When World War II began the government brought him into the defense department as a strategic specialist who was involved in planning the firebombing of Japanese cites which led to an enormous number of civilian casualities. After a stint working for the Ford Motor Company, JFK chose him to be his Secretary Of Defense. He was involved with the Cuban Missle Crisis. But is, of course, best known for the role he played in the Vietnam War.

McNamara comes across as a man haunted by the past who, at the age of 85, feels he must ""set things right"" about his role in US military affairs. He now admits the Vietnam War was a mistake. But still seems to contradict himself while discussing the actions he took. He attempts to cast LBJ as the primary villan and certainly Johnson comes across badly on several of their recorded coversations, including one where LBJ essentially says he wants to kill as many Vietnamese as possible. But McNamara also seems a bit disingenious at times, such as when he attempts to downplay his role in authorizing the use of Agent Orange. He also continually eludes to the fact that no good choices were available and that no one else can really understand the circumstances he was facing.

The main point that emerges for me is that the US government really had no clear understanding of Vietnamese history and that the Vietnamese people saw the US not as liberators but as an occupying force who had come to replace the French as colonizers. It's sort of amazing that so many smart people could have been so stupid. But this movie does an excellent job in putting a human face on people in power. It's not that there is some diabolical global conspiracy, as an earlier reviewer seemed to suggest. But rather that our leaders are simply human beings and are prone, like the rest of us, to failures, weaknesses and grave errors in judgemnent. The difference is that their mistakes become more tragic in times of war, when so many human lives are at stake.",1202169600,,2265,4.760814249363868
2011067,4,B0001L3LUE,This movie was very informative but the idea that McNamara was not at fault for the build-up of US forces in Vietnam is false.

2011068,5,B0001L3LUE,"It's easy to talk about the ""guilt"" of the man. But remember,he served presidents, not the other way around.  We learn from Morris' film that what once was thought of as McNamara's arrogance, might have actually been a certain shyness with being thrust into the limelight.  McNamara said in the film that he told Kennedy he would take the job of Secretary of Defense if he didn't have to join in ""that damn Washington social life.""  It seems too easy to hate a man simply because he didn't appear as warm and generous as his boss (Kennedy).
Now that we know more about Kennedy - who was the arrogant one?",1200787200,,604,4.472727272727273
2011069,5,B0001L3LUE,"Former secretary of defense Robert Mcnamara provides a very frank and illuminating version of his lessons learnt which are about 11 in total. The whole film is an interview session interpersed with images  of previous incidents of world history which happened during his tenure as Secretary of defense. Each lesson or principle learned is explained by Mcnamara aided by his retrospective insight  and his personal memoirs which run along with the images of news reports, interviews and photographs. The very interesting parts are hearing the real telephone tapes between President Nixon and McNamara / President Johnson and MCnamara.

Some of the things he talks about are

(1) His taking up of the offer from JFK to be secretary of defense thus leaving the presidency of ford motors.

(2) Cuban missile crisis and how close USA and Cuba was to nuclear war. There were 170 nuclear warheads in cuba supplied by Krushchev's Russia. McNamara's taped telephone converstaions with President John F Kennedy was very
  interesting.

(3) The bombing of Tokyo and how 100's of cities were already bombed to a large extent before the decision by Johnson was taken to drop the N bombs. Were the N bomb's overkill ?

(4) The continuation of american loss of life in Vietnam and the unpreparedness of the Ameican troops for the unconventional guerilla warfare there. How much of the decision for vietname rests on him and  how much on President Johnson

(5) The supposition that if JFK had lived he might have acted differently as compared to President Johnson with regards to the agressive stance on Vietnam.

(6) The misunderstood torpedo attacks reported by the sonar men which lead to bombing strikes against Vietnam.

(7) The use of agent green in Vietnam which intended as a chemical agent to removed the leaves from trees to removed enemy thicket cover was later found to also be a toxic and poisonous substance which caused loss of civilian life.

(8) His conclusion that if they had lost the war, could he have been called a war criminal ?

In summary he calls for proportionality in war ,strict nuclear detterance and to understand the enemy from his cultural and historical standpoint to avoid misunderstanding leading to avoidable military escalations.

2011072,1,B0001L3LUE,"Ah yes, the man is a gentleman and a scholar! A fine liver-spotted trophy of yester-year's own flippant little charades. Manipulated events wherein, just as today, soulless geeks get to vent their revenge on the world and the bullying grunts who inhabit it by directing the blind, head-on fate of thousands and millions of hapless souls who, through no real fault of their own, have gotten in the way of the Gameplan, or were severely influenced by the way the big Game is played.

As I stared into the black, beady eyes of an old and withered Robert Strange McNamara (yes, that's his real middle name) during the viewing of ""The Fog of War"", it occurred to me that perhaps no man, living or dead, has forcibly lied to himself as convincingly and consistently, (esp. with such grave reprocussions concerning the fate of mankind) as has this horrible beast. Notice the certain joy and flippancy in his voice when he chirps and ribbets about the way he played the game when it was his turn at the table!

 O, undoubtedly there have been fouler birds (but certainly not many) which have spread their wings to block out the sun, but could any of them have been more convinced that they were endeavoring to do right before God and man?

One cannot help but note the bitter irony, as we listen to Bob rattle on remorselessly about his role in the fire-bombing of Tokyo at the end of WWII, which killed over 100,000 civilians, then get all choked up and teary-eyed about how he was the one to pick out the plot location for the final resting place of his goodbuddy Jack, during that fateful November of '63.

Obviously a walking dichotomy, a Type-A case study for the division of mind and spirit, ol' Bob counterdicts and implicates himself with reckless abandon over the course of this film.

A choice quote straight from his thin, bloodless lips, ""Whenever I am asked a question I don't want to answer, I reply with the answer to the question I wish I was asked. This is a rule which has served me well."" Woo-eee! Obviously the model for all our current political hacks.

His calloused appraisals of the unnecessary casualties suffered from his many executive blunders, and of those around him, as being a worthwhile price to pay to achieve their noble aims, is fine insight into the mind of the tyrannical warmongers which have controlled the fate of mankind since our supposed ""civilization"".

While listening to some of the snickering tales he recounts of the wretched General LeMay, in which McNamara makes botched attempts at infusing elements of wit and humor into the scenarios, I once again realized how out of touch with humanity our ""leaders"" trully are. They obviously view themselves as some sort of superior life form, which is perhaps, simply just the type of egotistical scum such positions of power inevitably attract.

Without coming straight out and saying ""It was me! I am the horrible mutant to blame for these attrocities!"" McNamartyr implies his guilt concerning the unforgivable fire-bombings of some 27 major Japanese cities BEFORE the bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These are details I feel gipped at never having been exposed to in American History 101. Having obliterated so much of that country's infrastructure and wiped out half of its' population, one can't help but wonder, ""Were the A-bombs necessary for Japan's surrender?!"" The answer of course is ""Hells no!"" It was simply another test of our nuclear capability, which a few crusties at the Pentagon, and their handlers, deemed necessary.
Next Bob dances like a woodland fairy around the Bay of Pigs and the Gulf of Tonkin debacles, before settling for a slight bit of self-implication, while pinning ultimate resposibility on the Commanders in Chief. (Which is fair enough, but does little to cleanse his own blood-stained hands.)

I would suggest any who view this movie to go to the special features and check out all the additional footage. It really adds to the film and further exposes McNamartyr as being far from reformed, still as wily and dangerous a monster in old age as he was in youth. (One can only surmise that it was his enormous ego and craving for one last bask in the limelight which coaxed him from the shadows to devulge such a lurid tale.) The extra footage also shows how he is still covering for the ""secret"" world government which has us all in bondage; his tight lipped responses to a few key questions definitely prove him to be a loyalist, capable of taking their secrets to his grave. (Research the board members of the World Bank and the Council of Foreign Relations if you care to know who is really in charge. Are we to think that Bob's appointment to head the World Bank after his dismissal as Secretary of Defense, is pure coincidence? Sheesh. How stupid do we look?)

All in all, a very enlightening and thought-provoking documentary, which allows you to draw your own conclusions, while giving you enough info to discern it correctly. If you pay careful attention and can read between the lines at times, Bob does a fine job of exposing some of the behind-the-scenes developements and plot twists which show how the system operates and how we got to where we are at in current world affairs.

This film loses four stars from me on account of the glaring omission concerning any discussion with ol' Bob on the subject of the vile and traiterous sinking of the USS Liberty by the Israeli military off the Sinai Peninsula June 8, 1967 during the ""Six Day War"" between Israel and the Arab states of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Iraq. This attack killed 34 U.S. servicemen and wounded at least 173.
Multiple inquiries by both sides into the incident concluded that it had been simply a mistake of identity.

If you can call several hours of continuous strafing by fighter planes and a full-on assault by torpedo boats, an ""accident"".

Some still cling to this belief in hopes that our government is being run by hapless fools, oblivious to the reprocussions of their actions. (It sure appears that way if you yourself are oblivious to their master plan.)

But all the signs show them to be most cunning devils, devious to the enth degree, quite content to bathe in whatever amount of blood necessary to achieve their goal of world domination and enslavement.

So, I snatch back four stars for both that omission and Mr. Morris' over-all failure to hold ol' B Mac's toes to the flame in regards to his most obvious attrocities.

Still, I would highly recommend this as a must-see film.
P.S. On a side note; didn't Rumsfeld, with all his forked-tongue deceit, seem like ol' Bob's political re-incarnation? Even down to the way he was dismissed after serving his purpose. Another part of the repetitious cycle one can find during careful scrutiny of un-propagandized accounts of history.",1196640000,15,6808,4.775510204081633
2011073,3,B0001L3LUE,"""Fog of War"" is a little documentary that basically gives controversial former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara a platform to talk about his life and defend his actions for posterity. Although an unseen interlocutor poses a question every now and then, it can hardly be described as an interview, or even a conversation. A few damning clips are inserted by the producers, but for the most part, they give McNamara enough rope to hang himself and he does.

I watched this movie without really knowing much about McNamara except that he was the Defense Secretary during the Vietnam War. I came out of it hating him. McNamara was one of our Ivy League ""Big Brains"" who have been such a scourge upon this nation. He undoubtedly was intelligent, and to this day is still immensely proud of his intellectual standing and achievements, even going so far as to crow about how he was the smartest kid in his grade school class. He went on to be a statistical analyst in WWII and rose to become president of Ford Motors, where he had modernized the company and dramatically increased profits. That's where the trouble starts.

For some reason, JFK asked him to become his Defense Secretary. McNamara rightly protested that he was completely unqualified  for the position but eventually succumbed to vanity and accepted, continuing to serve under LBJ after the assassination. The problem with McNamara is that while he knew the Vietnam War was unwinnable, and even told the President so, he lied to the American people and continued to implement policies he knew were simply resulting in the needless deaths of our soldiers. Whether it was a misplaced sense of loyalty to the President before the nation, or if it was because of a sordid addiction to power, McNamara betrayed the public trust and well deserves to be despised as one of the most amoral empty suits ever to hold such power in America. When asked if he felt some responsibility for the Vietnam debacle, he replied in the negative without the slightest hesitation and blamed LBJ. McNamara's career showed us that having a Big Brain doesn't mean that you also are also endowed with courage, honesty, or principles.",1195344000,4,2166,4.86449864498645
2011094,5,B0001L3LUE,"This is a poignant and even haunting DVD.  This movie, by Erroll Morris, is based on his interviewing Robert McNamara, late in his life.  Interviews are interspersed with archived material to provide punctuation.  The end result is quite powerful.

The juxtaposition of the interview with historical scenes adds a considerable power to this DVD. McNamara was about 85 at the time he was interviewed.  His responses to questions are measured, but there is always a sense that he is trying to grapple with his own role in historical events such as the Vietnam War. He certainly does not apologize for his actions, but there is a sense in this movie that his reflections are part of his own internal struggles over historical events.

The well discussed ""lessons"" raised during this movie have some value in themselves.  However, they are useful in gaining a greater sense of McNamara's views and the internal debates he appears to be experiencing.

His feelings about John Kennedy's death are quite real.  His eyes throughout this movie are compelling to watch.

This DVD moves quickly.  The cumulative result is powerful.  Whether or not one ends up feeling positively or negatively about McNamara, one does end up gaining some real insights into him and into the times in which he played such an important role.",1193875200,3,1311,4.963302752293578
2011095,5,B0001L3LUE,"Whenever people start talking about politics, it's next to impossible to stay objective--which is why I deeply appreciate this excellent documentary by Errol Morris.

Touching on issues of morality in warfare and the responsibilities of the human race in a nuclear age, ""Fog of War"" is the closest to an objective analysis of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, and the fire-bombings of Japan that I have ever seen.  The reason is Morris' format--a one-on-one interview with Robert S. McNamara, interspersed with news and military footage.  This format allows the audience to discuss McNamara's views and experiences and the surrounding issues without first needing to sift through the bias of the director (which is always my complaint with Michael Moore documentaries).  In short, we as the audience get to make up our own minds, which is the hallmark of a good documentary.

I have taught this film in my college composition classes several times, and the students seem surprised by how it manages to be thought-provoking and entertaining at the same time.  The film quality is superb, and the haunting score by Philip Glass also sets the stage for some tough questions: 1) Is McNamara a war criminal?  2) What would we have done in his place? 3) And more importantly, what can we learn from McNamara's invaluable lessons and experiences?",1193788800,,1348,5.045045045045045

2011097,3,B0001L3LUE,"This is a decent film about a highly important figure from decades ago. It's somewhat flawed, however, in that it's just McNamara's own account. He's the only one giving the last word about himself. And while much of the time he seems sympathetic and highly contrite about the tragedies of the world, there are some moments where his highly educated and knowledgeable facade betrays a certain evil underneath. This is where again, and again, he seems like a perfectly moral man under normal circumstances, but when talking about war he says that things done in war are done wrong because there are no moral rules. What? Where did he get such a blindspot? The history of world is full of ""rules"" for war and they always include not murdering and terrorizing civilians to get what you want. His personal ""fog of war"" is an utterly despicable excuse. He's part of the rationalizing warmongers who think it's fine to not have morals in the moment. Nonsense. Pure nonsense.

Robert told President -elect Kennedy that he should get out of Viet Nam as soon as possible, then Kennedy was killed (and not by Lee Oswald).
For those of you who do not regognize a man feeling his mortality and wanting in some way to explain his folly, keep living. For those of you who believe if you were in the same posistion you would have done something different than follow the instructions of you boss(who knows even less than you) then I laugh at you.

I do not begin my review because of any clear sense of the virtue or villainy of Bob McNamara's legacy as president of the Ford Motor Company, Secretary of Defense under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and long-time president of the World Bank.

Far from it, the spendidly drawn impression is how dangerously concentrated power becomes in the hands of fragile, myopic, regular men and women who in many--most?--cases want to do the right thing.

McNamara's memory ranges from World War I to the extinction of River Blindness in Africa through the World Bank's efforts. For understandable reasons, the camera and the questions linger most on the Viet Nam era, for this is where McNamara took 'the world stage', as he puts it.

Clearly enamored of John Kennedy, McNamara had a more complex relationship with Johnson, whom he admired but with whom he came to disagree in a process that led to McNamara's firing just shortly before Johnson made his epic decision not to run for reelection.

As THE FOG OF WAR touches time and again upon the deliberations that framed the Bay of Pigs crisis and then the Southeast Asian war itself, one hears via the clarity of taped conversations how little we knew and, proverbially, how close we came to ultimate war.

McNamara has passionate remarks to offer on the very timely matter of taking America's strength into battle when we have failed to convince our allies of that course.

Kudos to McNamara for complicating his legacy even more by achieving astonshing things through some of the World Bank's better years.

2011114,3,B0001L3LUE,"What happens when supposedly great men, upon closer examination, turn out not to be so great, after all? What happens in this particular case is a piece of icon-washing fostered by Errol Morris who apparently couldn't think of a better subject to film a documentary about.

All the accolades regarding this film would lead one to believe that it is about a titanic human individual who achieved great things, but when one actually watches the film, one sees nothing of the sort. Robert McNamara, a man who, in early pictures and footage of himself, is so bursting with arrogance and self-importance that he all but glows, played Mephistopheles to Kennedy and Johnson up until about 1967. That is to say that he provided these men with war strategies and troops and generally brought about the means by way of which their wars could be fought.

Errol Morris is an expert filmmaker and, as usual, his film is graced with the hypnotic music of Philip Glass, whose soundtracks are all but indistinguishable from one another. Indeed, the soundtrack from Koyannisqatsi might have been substituted here to provide exactly the same effect. Morris's camera angles and editing are never boring, but this viewer does not share his fascination with his interview subject.

McNamara evinces guilt about his involvements in war and appears on the verge of tears in many scenes as he recalls difficult decisions made about the Vietnam war. But as the film winds down, it becomes evident that McNamara is proud of his ""achievements,"" although it is difficult to see how sending 58,000 young Americans to their deaths can be regarded as an achievement to be proud of. McNamara would have been better off had he remained as the head of the Ford Motor Company. Perhaps then his ""achievements"" that he is so proud of might have really added up to something instead of a head full of phantom shadows and dead soldiers.

It is generally considered bad form to give low ratings to an Errol Morris film, and this viewer certainly agrees that he is a very good filmmaker, indeed. Unfortunately, here his choice of subject matter fails him, for McNamara is rarely insightful regarding his role as Secretary of Defense. One comes to the film expecting McNamara to shed light upon obscure happenings, or to reveal dark secrets about what went on behind the scenes, but no such luck. In effect, all McNamara can muster up is a half-hearted ""that's the way it was."" There are no insights on the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the back of the DVD case promises, and the stunning revelations regarding the Cuban Missile Crisis amount to nothing more than that in those days, we actually came close to nuclear war and that it was only averted by sheer luck. Hmm. The film suffers throughout from this kind of glibness.

McNamara just isn't that interesting. Whatever his talents as a CEO, this is not a man given to insightful philosophical speculation. And it shows in the superficial comments that he makes about war being ""just human nature.""

Nice try, Mr. Morris. Next time, how about doing a film about somebody who really deserves the time and expense spent upon them?

His knowledge of the facts surrounding the War in the pacific and its aftermath is as fascinating as it is compelling. Ultimately McNamara himself comes across as sympathetic character who did what he thought was right for the country but who ultimately is struggling with the results and his place in history.

2011134,3,B0001L3LUE,"I thought McNamara came across in the this film basically the way I had always thought him to be; a pathetic person with no moral back bone at all. If he indeed had opposed the war in Vietnam I don't understand why he didn't resign, and the answer is that he didn't oppose the war.

  Everyone claims McNamara was so bright, but even when he went to Vietnam in 1995 he had to have it explained to him that the Vietnamese were fighting for their independence. Why didn't he know that? I was 25 years old in 1966 and I knew that.

  Ho Chi Minh was a young student in Paris at the end of WWI. When President Wilson came to Paris, Minh sent letter to Wilson asking him to help free his country from the French. They wanted their independence. Wilson never replied. Why didn't McNamara know that.

  As for McNamara's eleven lessons from his life; no brainers each one. Stuff that one learns the first week in a business education class in high school.

 The film added nothing to our knowledge of World War II or the Vietnam War that hasn't been discussed before.

2011135,3,B0001L3LUE,"Fog of War

An interesting insight into a highly intelligent, articulate and fallible man.  Mr. McNamara discusses eleven crucial lessons that he has learned about the waging of war.  Present leaders would do well to take these lessons to heart.  Hindsight has enabled him to understand and articulate the mistakes that he and Johnson made with regard to Vietnam.  Many of these mistakes are eerily similar to the mistakes that the Bush administration has made and is making with regard to Iraq.

I don't know anything about Mr. McNamara except from what I learned in this video.  Therefore, I suppose I had a fairly unbiased opinion of him before watching this.  After watching this, however, I come away with a feeling that he is a good man who got lost in the fog of war.  It is interesting to note that some of the first advice that he offered to Johnson was to get out of Vietnam before it spiraled out of control.  This is confirmed by an excerpt of a phone conversation that he had with President Johnson.

I think that this video is slightly marred by the quirky editing.  I would have been much more pleased with a more extended and in depth discussion with Mr. McNamara instead of quick sound bites that are obviously cut and edited, I guess for ""artistic effect,"" but to me they detract from the seriousness of the subjects that McNamara is discussing.  It's almost as if the producers of this video didn't trust the attention span of the viewing public to simply listen to and learn from an in depth conversation and exploration of important events.

The subject matter itself deserves five stars, but the handling of it in this video deserves only three in my humble opinion.  It's worth watching, but don't expect to be wowed by it or to gain a significantly deeper understanding of the events that it touches.",1164931200,6,1824,4.65625

2011138,5,B0001L3LUE,"One of the ""lessons"" that Robert McNamara imparts in this documentary is that ""in order to do good, you may have to engage in evil.""  This lesson essentially sums up the life of not only McNamara but the history of the United States in the later half of the 20th century.  However, the question that the film really presents is just how much evil must one do to accomplish good.  In the final estimation, did McNamara do more good then evil?  Morris does not answer this, but makes it clear that this ultimate question cannot be answered by simply plugging in numbers to an IBM machine.  One could be tempted to think that for every Japanese life lost in the fire bombings in 1945, maybe 10 American lives were sparred from a land invasion of the home islands.  Was that worth it?  For the 68,000 lives lost in Vietnam, did McNamara make this up in his leadership of the World Bank?  There is not an answer to this question, and even the subject of this documentary cannot attempt to answer it without contradicting himself.  At one point in the interview McNamara believes that he was acting as part of a machine, but later on adds that he was acting as a war criminal during the bombing of Japan.  Does mankind abdicate his free will when the fog of war rolls in?  This is what makes this documentary so compelling is that it shows a 83 year old coming to grips with the reality of what he has done, and what he has not done.

One could think that a viewer would have come away from this documentary with an understandable loathing for Robert McNamara.  After all, he would be the prototypical target of such protest songs as Dylan's ""Masters of War"" or the poster-child of the military-industrial complex.  Yet, each time I watch the movie, I do not feel anger towards him, but I feel rather a partial remoteness that is hard to explain.  Part of the explanation is that if placed in the same situation, I know that I would have acted the same way.  I too would have followed orders from Curtis LeMay concerning the bombing of Japan.  I also would have probably ran Vietnam with the same attitude that McNamara did.  Now that we have seen that the lessons from Vietnam were not read when it came to Iraq, one could only think of what George Bernard Shaw once wrote:""We learn from history that we learn nothing from history.""  ""The Fog of War"" is not a dry historical documentary, but rather a primer on philosophy, rationality and ultimately death.",1163030400,2,2451,4.504524886877828
2011139,5,B0001L3LUE,"Last night, I watched the documentary, Fog of War, about former Secretary of Defense, Robert S. MacNamara, the Harvard-educated whiz kid who many call the architect of the Vietnam War.  It is the portrait of a brilliant, but profoundly troubled old man who weeps about selecting a plot of ground in Arlington in which to bury JFK, but is steel-eyed as he recounts bombing sorties that destroy hundreds of thousands.  While fighting hard to stay composed, it is evident that MacNamara is haunted by his own dark deeds and the human condition but remains stubbornly out of touch with the part of himself that orchestrated them.

The experiences he recounts - most notably, in WWII, devising ways for U.S. bomb to destroy most of Japan, killing over 100,000 civilians a day to presiding over the Dept of Defense for eight years of the U.S. in Vietnam - are stunning in his application of sophisticated management techniques and statistics to destroy lives and nations.  Were he not on the side of good, he observes at one point, he would surely be tried as a war criminal, to which I would add, on a scale equal to Hitler.

MacNamara is a very bright man and the film is well done, even if the interviewer couldn't quite decide whether to be in it or not, and therefore doesn't use a microphone for his own questions.  It's also a very valuable instructive tool - recounting in chilling detail how close we came to nuclear war in the Cuban Missile Crises, the Cold War, World War II and finally Vietnam.  It is also heavily edited, I would imagine so that MacNamara could be firmly in charge, pulling back and stepping forward as suits him.  It is therefore filled with omissions and lies - the willingness of the U.S. to go to war to protect its economic interests and the fabrication at Johnson's insistence of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, a perfect analog to the trumped up intelligence Bush used to justify invading Iraq.

Although it is about history and the role of a man who dedicated much of his professional life to efficiently killing people (in the name of ideals and for our leaders, he would hasten to add, sounding very similar to generals in the Third Reich), the film is especially chilling as it lays out Eleven Lessons for our nation, several of which we are flagrantly violating today in Iraq; namely, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 & 11.  In fact, the parallels between the folly of believing we could win the war in Indochina and our present situation in what was formerly Persia are so profound, it's a wonder there aren't more documentaries, novels, essays and intelligent discourse on the subject.  (Read Graham Greene's The Quiet American, written in the late 50s, and the folly of our efforts in Vietnam is plain enough for an 8th grader to get).

  1. Empathize with your enemy.

  2. Rationality will not save us.

  3. There's something beyond one's self.

  4. Maximize efficiency.

  5. Proportionality should be a guideline in war.

  6. Get the data.

  7. Belief and seeing are both often wrong.

  8. Be prepared to reexamine your reasoning.

  9. In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil.

  10. Never say never.

  11. You can't change human nature.

What's even sadder is that as many mistakes and as much damage as MacNamara committed, he is head and shoulders above Dick Cheney, Don Rumsfeld and the rest of the Bush administration.  That George W. Bush is out of the class of statesman is so obvious, I won't waste time describing how poorly he fares next to JFK, Kruschev and even fellow Texas cowboy, Lyndon B. Johnson.

Fog of War is an excellent film.  In MacNamara, Shakespeare would feel vindicated for creating some of his darkest characters.  Pure evil does exist.  It is, in its most extreme, as Hannah Arendt alleged after WWII, banal.",1159747200,4,3779,4.651515151515151

2011143,5,B0001L3LUE,"My first glimpse of Errol Morris' work (The Thin Blue Line) was for an undergraduate history seminar examining the role (and subsequent fallacy) of human memory in historical discourse.  While ""The Thin Blue Line"" examined a singular Texas murder, Morris' ""Fog of War"" has a larger footprint since it probes an extremely sharp and cognizant 80+ year old McNamara and his position in United States war policy over a thirty year span.  World War II and Vietnam obviously provide a lot of ground to cover in a documentary, but the ""larger footprint"" of Morris' film rests with the controversial nature of McNamara in the public's mind versus the historical record.  In short, McNamara bears some responsibility (and perhaps lingering guilt) for his recommendations in the WWII bombing and the Vietnam policy.  The Vietnam War was not his action alone, however; he was part of a national security apparatus submitting recommendations to the only man who could act:  The President of the United States.  Accordingly, McNamara bears partial responsibility but he is well aware of a popular desire for his complete contrition.  Yet, he now bears the sole burden for these group actions because he was the face of the Vietnam policy for two presidents and he is one of the few presidential advisors still alive from the Kennedy/Johnson Era (as well as the WWII bombing decisions).  McNamara is certainly aware of his position as well as the fact that certain portions of the American public want a criminal confession from the man.

With that ""public pitfall"" in mind, McNamara's explanations and answers to Morris' questions can appear scheming and duplicitous, but those answers simply place decisions and policy in their proper historical framework.  At one point in the film, Morris' essentially asks McNamara who was responsible for Vietnam decisions and McNamara quickly replies, ""The President"".  The audience (or at least, I) wanted McNamara to answer, ""It was my decision"" and - as such - may view the President Response as a cop-out.  However, McNamara is absolutely correct; the decision for action rested with the Commander-in-Chief and his name was never Robert Strange McNamara.  From the audience's perspective, it is nothing short of compelling to watch a man justify unpopular actions while dodging an undue burden of responsibility and respecting (i.e., not damning) the two presidents he served and loved.

Personally, I relished the personal insights Morris captured (or that McNamara permitted himself to show?).  These poignant glimpses ranged from McNamara's tearful story of surveying Arlington National Cemetery for Kennedy's eventual burial plot to the fleeting family health references confronting the McNamara Family during the Secretary of Defense years.  My favorite insight into McNamara's soul comes during the retelling of the young Quaker who set himself on fire below McNamara's office mere moments after handing his baby daughter to a pleading bystander.  While the story is well known, McNamara pays respect to the widow's subsequent explanation and appears to have kept tabs on the daughter.  I am still not sure what to make of that insight and dozens of others, but those personal glimpses are the underlying force of the film.

In terms of filmmaking, some reviews have blasted Morris' technique of being off camera and unmiked, his use of the Glass soundtrack, or his reliance on public domain stock footage of planes, bombing, or protests.  In many respects, they are right:  either you love Morris' methods or they will grate on you.  The editing cuts can be choppy, but it is unclear how much of that is for dramatic effect or if the original interviews went back and forth over the same material.  If you enjoy a bombastic Michael Moore-type figure guiding the audience through a series of contrived events peppered with sarcastic and puerile rhetoric, then ""The Fog of War"" may not be the documentary for you and worth a local rental.  On the other hand, if you enjoyed Morris' earlier ""The Thin Blue Line"" or Barbara Kopple's ""Harlan County, USA"" and ""American Dream"", then you will want to buy this DVD for the theatrical release, deleted scenes, and McNamara's own rules.",1153785600,9,4213,5.134699853587116
2011154,3,B0001L3LUE,"I was a child during the Johnson administration and I have only vague memories of watching the news back in the mid 60's and seeing something called ""Vietnam"" on the news every single night.  I decided to view this documentary in order to gain some more insights on that era from possbily the best ""insider"" there is.  I had no preconceptions, positive or negative, concerning Secretary McNamara.

Organizing the documentary around ""Eleven Lessons"" helped keep my interest by providing a context for what was basically an extended autobiographical recount of various events in McNamara's life.  I found myself wondering if I could make such a documentary about the lessons I've learned during my relatively boring and obscure life.

Although I found the historical insights interesting, I also found the ""packaging"" of the content becoming more and more irritating as the movie progressed.

First, the choppy editing made me wonder if I was really seeing what McNamara said at all.  Sometimes there were several edits during a single sentence that came out of McNamara's mouth.  He was at times jerking around like ""Max Headroom"" (for those who remember who he was).  Was this really necessary?  What was edited out?  I suppose editing could be used to make someone say anything you wanted him/her to say.  Just cut up the film into thousands of single-word visual bytes and you could edit together a clip showing a person saying anything.

Second, the soundtrack got rather tedious: two chords alternating doo-dee-doo-dee-doo-dee that never seemed to let up.  Some apparently found this ""mesmerizing"".  I suppose so if you easily hypnotized, but I found it grating on my nerves after a while.

Third, the use of file footage that I've seen many times before, including out of context stuff like footage of purely defensive anti-aircraft missiles while the narrative speaks of invading cuba.

Fourth, the mysterious off-camera voice in the background that occasionally interacts with McNamara.  Couldn't they at least have used a second microphone?

So, although I don't regret investing the time in watching this DVD, I could never watch it again, so it is pointless for me to acquire it for my collection.  I'm glad I just rented it.",1153353600,5,2235,5.071232876712329
2011155,5,B0001L3LUE,"This was a surprisingly outstanding film, I was really captivated. Full of fascinating perspectives on the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Cold War, strategic bombing, Vietnam, etc, from the point of view of one of the chief orchestrators.

Most eerie quote...

On March 10, 1945, the US Air Force dropped incendiery bombs on Tokyo, starting a firestorm which killed 100,000 peopple, mainly civilians.

McNamara:(Rhetorically) ""Is it moral to kill 100,000 people; civilians, women and children, in one night?""

Interviewer: ""Did you know ahead of time that that was what was going to happen?""

McNamara: ""In a sence, I was a part of a mechanism that in effect, recommended it.""

He is an amazingly intelligent man, went to Berkley, youngest associate professor at Harvard, president of the Ford Motor Company, secretary of defense for 7 years.

A brilliant, keen analytical, engineering type mind. Loves data and analysis, asks the right questions, yet presided over a titanic failure of leadership and vision. Why? He says it was a constant struggle of differeing opinions between him and LBJ. That their compromises included the worst of both perspectives. McNamara wanted to pull out of Vietnamn entirely by the end of 1965. LBJ refused to appease the communists, and kept upping the ante. They never had enough to win, but they always made sure they had plenty to lose. No strategy for winning the war, no exit plan. No way politically to admit defeat. Sound familiar?

McNamara admitted they were fighting the cold war, while the Vietnamese were fighting a war of colonial liberation. It was a complex disconnect of cognitive frameworks. McNamara totally misunderstood the nature of the (1,000 year) relationship between Vietnam and China. McNamara wrote three books, one dealing specifically with talks later with DRV leaders, in which these misunderstandings came out. He said, ""we all make mistakes, no military commander doesn't make mistakes and those mistakes get people killed, maybe hundreds, maybe thousands, or tens of thousands, but you have to learn from those mistakes and not make them again, but maybe you will make them 3 or four times, but not 5.""

2011157,5,B0001L3LUE,"Few people have ever been as controversial in government life as Robert McNamara was in his seven years as the Defense Secretary of this nation between 1961 and 1968, when a dirty little war in Vietnam escalated into a conflagration that tore America apart.  It is this controversial individual that documentary filmmaker Errol Morris gets a lot out of in his often poignant 2002 documentary THE FOG OF WAR, and the end result gave me a very good appreciation for the man, even if the decisions he made with respect to Vietnam, partly with John F. Kennedy but mostly with Lyndon Johnson, resulted in the loss of 58,000 US service men and women, and countless millions of Asians.

During his time as SecDef, McNamara was often criticized as cocky and arrogant--a regular ""Wiz Kid"" from Harvard who seemingly had no business being in the position Kennedy had appointed him too.  Certainly, the slicked-back hair would give one that impression.  But as we see in THE FOG OF WAR, McNamara rose to the level of brilliance in his ability to help Kennedy defuse the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 and keep it from exploding into Armageddon, all the while fending off the macho warmongering of Curtis LeMay and other rabid anti-Commie types in the government at that time.  Even now, as he is pushing 90, he remains adamant and proud of his time in government life, but he is also willing to admit the seriousness of the mistakes he made, particularly with our gross misreading of the Vietnam war as being a part of the Cold War, when in truth it was an internal matter of the Vietnamese wanting independence from outside forces, including ours.

And for a man who was often accused of being overly analytical and unemotional, McNamara chokes up when he thinks of Kennedy and the man's untimely assassination in Dallas in 1963, and declares unequivocally that Kennedy would never have allowed the Vietnamese conflict to escalate into a war that would kill millions, let alone tear the greatest nation in the world asunder.  This is a man who has gained a lot of wisdom about the ways of politics and war, but it has been through an enormous amount of pain, not to mention an enormous amount of lives lost.  Although Morris (who directed the highly acclaimed THE THIN BLUE LINE) does occasionally find McNamara as evasive now as he may have been during his time in office, he nevertheless gives us a great deal of insight as to regards with McNamara's life and times, and how world events came to shape his thinking.

Given the passage of time, and thanks to Morris' sobering film, I believe it's safe to say that McNamara, though he is regarded even today by many pundits as the worst SecDef this nation has ever had, merits a great deal of sympathy and respect in hindsight, for his time in office was one in which the great pressures of the Cold War would probably have swallowed up just about anyone who held his position.  His wisdom is one earned through considerable pain, and it is the kind of wisdom that was totally lacking with Donald Rumsfeld, whose hubris made McNamara at his most incendiary look like a halfway-decent guy.",1150502400,8,3134,4.702554744525547
2011158,5,B0001L3LUE,"""The Fog of War"" is part Cold War documentary, part autobiography of US Secretary of Defence Robert S. McNamara (1961-1968). The latter aspect of the film gives McNamara the opportunity to vindicate his controversial role in America's involvement in Vietnam. He discusses the personalities and positions of US Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, General Curtis Le May, Fidel Castro, Nikita Khrushchev, etc. Film-maker Errol Morris, however, does not let him off so lightly on certain points, particularly the thorny issue of America's involvement in Vietnam.

More importantly, it is a film outlining 11 positions every leader, politician or government should consider before he (it) enters a war. It never draws direct parallels to America's subsequent or current affairs. It follows events strictly relating to McNamara's service in the military during WWII and tenure as Secretary of Defence. Nevertheless, it is obvious these 11 positions are guidelines intended for policy-makers in power, regardless of political party or persuasion.

To a certain extent, ""The Fog of War"" evokes sympathy for a now repentant McNamara despite the calculative role he once played in Vietnam. One realises the actions he and others took were not simple black and white decisions; they were complex and had ramifications just as controversial as the ones ultimately made. Former President Johnson actually comes off looking like the villain and the one who should be berated for America's war in Vietnam.

If you lived during this period, ""The Fog of War"" will touch you personally. It did me. I was particularly stunned to hear the audio tape where President Johnson (1963-1968) criticises the Kennedy-McNamara position to extricate the US from further involvement in Vietnam.

For students of history and political science, this film is a must see. Politicians, American or otherwise, should watch and LEARN from the lessons drawn during this period. They are still terribly relevant.",1148947200,5,1968,5.400651465798045
2011159,4,B0001L3LUE,"So much has been written about the man (McNamara) and the topic (war) in these Amazon reviews that I can really add little else to help you decide whether this movie is for you.  So, I'll just add one relatively simple observation that some of you may find helpful: I didn't see this movie in theaters and didn't exactly rush to see it on DVD, thinking that it was one of those movies I ""should"" see, but not ""right now"".  In other words, I thought it would be good for me, but a little boring, hard to absorb, that sort of thing.  But, boy, was I wrong.  ""The Fog of War"" is riveting and flies by.  McNamama's observations about wars in general and the ones he was personally involved in are endlessly fascinating, as is the man himself.  The movie is definitely not an ordeal or a dry civics lesson or anything else along those lines, so don't let those fears scare you off. Cause the movie ain't boring and it ain't dull.

And, as I'm already here typing away, I'll add one final thought: What's particularly disturbing about the movie is that we clearly see that Mr. McNamara is a complex thinker, a man of some empathy, not by any means a one-note ""Hawk"" like some of the generals and other leaders he discusses in the film, but McNamara himself was still nevertheless a central figure in the shaping of the policy that lead to almost 60,000 soldiers losing their lives in Vietnam.  The real lesson here seems to be, then, that thoughtful, essentially good men can't always turn the tide once they're caught up in something that develops a life of its own.

McNamara's life as told here was one of accelerating acheivement, you can still glimpse in the way he talks and the way that he thinks that here is a ferociously intelligent man who can analyse any given problem. The way he describes how he analysed problems at Ford and during World War Two are microstudies of how an intelligent person deals with something- by cutting to the detail that matters and dealing with that, by knowing the right questions, asking them and finding out the right answers and then turning that into an acheivement in the real world. But come to Vietnam and here is what I found so sad- because the essential tale of this film is how a series of very intelligent men got it completely wrong. How a series of the most intelligent people in the planet almost plunged us into nuclear war because they were playing chess blindfold according to rules they didn't understand. What McNamara's lessons are there to show are not the banality of politics but its unpredictability, what we don't understand is more important than what we do. Coming out of this film is an almost Hayekian distrust of the acheivements of intelligence in the face of the complexity of human life- none of those carping on these message boards about how McNamara could have done better understand the central message of the film- the problem wasn't with McNamara and Kennedy being crooks or thick it was with the very structure of modern politics and the impossibility of taking decisions wherein so many variables are involved.",1140998400,7,1572,4.804428044280443

2011175,5,B0001L3LUE,"A very powerful and thought provoking documentary; made even more-so by the current state of affairs around the world. Robert McNamara knows all too well how government can (and sometimes ""must"") act like a belligerent and hypocritical oaf when it comes to foreign affairs. There is, perhaps, no other single living human being in the world today who can be held more responsible for & who has experienced as much mass strife, violence and conflict in the world today other than McNamara (an unfortunate shock due to a new awareness of my lack of accurate historical information). His involvement in international conflicts ranges from WWII up through to Vietnam.

The director truly does a masterful job in providing an incredibly candid look at an individual who has had such a dramatic impact on our recent history. The honesty McNamara conveys is both shocking and a breath of fresh air at the same time. A most uncommon result of today's political rhetoric. Recounting his past, McNamara's range of emotions are even palpable. The collage of archived film clips and dramatic musical scores cut with McNamara's raw emotion makes for one of the most powerful films I've ever seen on this subject.

His insights on perception and ""reality"" especially stand out in the context of how the current administration is conducting their mass scale war at home and abroad.

McNamara was recently in attendance at a meeting with President Bush at the White house. What a terrific sequel that would make! Attendees at the meeting included a number of former government security officials, in what some said, was an attempt by Bush to show that he was open to outside ideas and criticisms. I hope it worked, but see no evidence to that effect at this point.

In conclusion, I must note the recently released documentary ""Why We Fight.""  It opened in limited release last week and is based around the exit speech given by Dwight D. Eisenhower as he left office in 1950's. It looks like the two films would compliment each other nicely.

This is not a guy trying to justify his actions or his life. He examines the trials and tribulations, mistakes and accomplishments with the same microscope that he did his job(s).

2011177,2,B0001L3LUE,"Poet Philip Larkin wrote that sex began in 1963.  Actually, it was 1961, January.  That's when the kids and Whiz Kids with hair and testosterone came to town, and when old dull bald Eisenhower and his wife with Bettie-Pageboy bangs went back to the farm.  That's when sex began.

Robert McNamara, with flipcharts and probing, pointed questions and thrusting, pointed pointers was the brave new world's most improbable and potent sex symbol.  Camelot, 1961, was a party at which women, the best and the brightest, wanted to be seated next to Robert McNamara.  Then the war came.  The whole world was watching as strange Robert McNamara changed his spots or sloughed his cold skin or melted down (or whatever reptiles do) and became a reptile.  Then he faded away.

This film brings him back as a reptilian and equivocal Mr. Know It All.  It creates for him Eleven Lessons, although God was satisfied with only ten and although McNamara himself had only a Ten Point Plan for saving the world from itself and from Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.

Robert McNamara's Eleven Lessons teach us nothing beyond the lesson painfully learned long ago that America was imperiled by entrusting power to a kid like Robert McNamara.  They also raise old ghosts:

*  McNamara playfully admits that his president, John Kennedy, won the presidency with a lie, the slander that General Eisenhower allowed a missile gap in the USSR's favor.  Harvard's Kennedy was briefed throughout the 1960 campaign by friends from the CIA, which was saturated with Harvard elitists.  The CIA was also saturated with the certainty that a Soviet-slanted missile gap was a lie.  The CIA had that certainty because the CIA's Richard Bissel, a Harvard elitist, had designed the spy plane that proved beyond doubt that Eisenhower had maintained American missile superiority, a superiority we kept until the progressive era of detente.

*  McNamara recycles the Thirteen-Days mythology of 1962's Cuban Missile Crisis.  General Curtis LeMay -- not Khrushchev (who emplaced missiles and warheads in Cuba) or Castro (who wanted to launch them against America even after the crisis was ""resolved"") -- is the mythology's designated villain.  The mythology's heroes are the Democrats who srote the mythology.  (Leftist Eric Alterman offers a necessary corrective and a truthful synopsis of the 1962 crisis in his recent book, When Presidents Lie.)

*  McNamara seems to affirm Oliver Stones thesis that JFK, had he lived, would have drawn down his nascent Vietnam War and ended it.  The problem with the thesis is that there were two assassinations in November 1963, several weeks before the draw-down was to begin.  JFK was murdered on November 22 (Clue:  By the Communist.  With the Mannlicher-Carcano.  In the Depository.)  That was after another assassination that married America to Vietnam for a very long time.  That was the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem, America's ally in South Vietnam.

Our Left effected the near-destruction of CIA-FBI coordination because our clandestine services may have been complicit in assassination attempts against avowed enemies of America.  Even now there are whirlwinds of concern and firestorms of depair about plots against Cuba's Castro and Chile's Allende.  About the murder of Diem, America's feckless friend, there is silence aside from inadvertent occasions when someone like McNamara hints at what happened in early November 1962.  Let me speak the unspoken and overwhelming question:  Did John Kennedy or someone close to him order the assassination of an American ally, or permit it with a wink and a patrician nod?  Inquiring minds want to know.  Why don't the leftists who write our history and our mythology?",1138147200,10,3709,5.130217028380635

The only narrator in this documentary is Robert Strange McNamara, who talks to an interviewer whom we never see and hardly hear. Sometimes we see McNamara talk, other times we hear his narration over images of all the wars he was somehow involved in: World War II, Cuba and Vietnam. Over all of this of course the Cold War.

Better narration is I think impossible. The way he stresses things, the words that he uses, it's just beautiful.

And what better way to look at Vietnam than with McNamara, there is not a closer source than him. it may be slanted and he may me wrong on some points but it's fascinating.

McNamara is completely open about things. He is passionate about things and even starts to almost cry when he talks about the death and suffering. It makes it very human.

2011179,5,B0001L3LUE,"Erol Morris is one of the best documentary filmmakers to ever have lived and his masterpiece, ""Fog of War"" is one of the best Documentaries ever.

You have to see this film...Don't miss it. You will learn more about American history during the baby boom generation than any PBS mini series can ever teach you.

The central character, Robert McNamara, was considered, ""THE BEST OF THE BEST"", by John F. Kennedy and was appointed to Secretary of State in the 1960's.

We see McNamara as a troubled and complex man despite his high IQ and Harvard education. McNamara was a genius, a briiliant man who invented the seat belt in cars, and countless other innovations. His inventions to this day are used in companies around the world. He had more ideas than Thomas Edison.

But, his legacy was the Viet Nam War and he shows no remorse or guilt about his involvement in getting us to war. According to him it was the right thing to do and he did not make any mistakes in judgement at all...now that is an interesting and compelling man!

After you see this, you can't help, but admire and respect him. He had his convictions and never wavered on any of of them.  The man stood his ground on every belief he had.  At the end the film, the director, Morris,  lets you judge and decide, without any subjectivity, if McNamara was a moral straight arrow or an immoral loose cannon.",1133222400,5,1370,4.518218623481781
2011180,5,B0001L3LUE,"Back in the late sixties and early seventies Robert McNamara was a much hated man since it was widely believed that he was the architect of the buildup in Vietnam and therefore personally responsible for one of our country's most disastrous military engagements.  After all, he was Secretary of Defense under both Kennedy and Johnson.

But there's a limit to what one man can do no matter how high his office, and that is especially true in a democracy with governmental checks and balances.  Moreover, according to the spin of this brilliant documentary by Errol Morris (director of the almost equally brilliant The Thin Blue Line 1988), it was really President Lyndon Baines Johnson who insisted on the buildup and slowly, like somebody inching his way blindly into a quagmire, get stuck in a trap of his own making.  Still McNamara, Boy Wonder, now a man in his prime, originally chosen by the ill-fated JFK to be Secretary of Defense, has some serious culpability, even though he is on record as telling President Kennedy in 1963 that we ought to get out.  By the way, being offered the job by JFK was an offer he couldn't refuse, even though he protested that he wasn't qualified.  JFK knew better.  Errol Morris shows this point cleverly by having McNamara say he hadn't yet agreed to take the job as he stood by JFK even as the President publically announced that McNamara was the new Secretary of Defense.

Here then is Morris's technique: Robert McNamara, who at the time this film was made was 85-years-old, long in tooth and watery eyed, yet full of an acute sense of history and of his place in it, was put on camera as he was being interviewed.  Again and again the camera holds tight and close on his face and we can see that face asking for understanding, as an overwhelmed parent might ask of his children.  Meanwhile, juxtaposed between shots of the man were scenes from his past, B-29s taking off and dropping bombs on Japanese cities, and then jets from the Vietnam era firing rockets and tracers at targets on the ground, bombs falling, falling, falling, and bursting and bodies lying in the rubble.

McNamara would explain.  He would justify himself.  Or he would offer no excuses.  There is the fog of war, he said, and the Vietnam War was enormously complex not just from a military point of view, but from a political and global perspective.  And there was always Lyndon Johnson who could never be persuaded to get out of the bog even as the slime rose to his waist and then to his neck.  Incidentally, as far as I can tell the phrase, ""the fog of war"" is a paraphrase of something Karl von Clausewitz wrote in his famous treatise On War (1833).

Included in the voice-overs are recordings made in the Oval Office that were not available to reporters until recent years.  Listening to them, I was struck again and again at the Machiavellian personality of President Johnson as revealed in the verbatim tapes, and at the Iago-like influence of Robert McNamara at his side--Iago in the sense that he whispered in the President's ear, and in the fact that they shared confidences they did not share with others.  But Johnson was no easily-led Othello.  Instead, Johnson was his own man, a stubborn man, and while he listened eagerly to McNamara, in the final analysis he went his own way down, down into the quagmire.

This is also in a sense a biography of the public Robert McNamara.  He talks about his childhood and his days as an undergraduate at Berkeley.  There is a shot of him as a young man at the stove of an apartment with his young wife.  There is his experience in World War II analyzing bombing effectiveness under General Curtis E. LeMay (who doesn't look good here), and then his phenomenal run at Ford Motor Company where he turned a floundering auto maker into a leader of the industry.  There is also his remembrance of the Cuban missile crisis in which he makes it clear that we were--holding his finger and thumb less than an inch apart--""this close"" to nuclear war.

McNamara comes off as enormously hard-working, brilliant yes, but with the modesty that comes from hard experience.  He seems confident that he did the best he could in a job that required everything he had.  He allows that he made mistakes and he reminds us that people in high places who make mistakes make mistakes that can have horrific consequences.  He now assures us that he knows war is the wrong way if it can be avoided since in the fog of war we all lose our way.  I would add that the logic of war always takes over and has its way with us, regardless of intention.  Once the dogs of war are let loose, they run and run and run until they are exhausted.  And only then do they come home.

In addition to being an extremely informative and revealing portrait of one of our most controversial secretaries of defense, this is also a marvelous artistic achievement, a film carefully collaged, and sharply edited employing all sorts of archived media with a haunting score by Philip Glass.  Of course it doesn't tell us the whole story or anything close to the whole story, and certainly were Lyndon Johnson and Curtis LeMay alive today, they might very well tell it differently.

What I liked most about McNamara here is his willingness to be mostly candid and not only admit errors, but to reveal some of the very human processes by which monumental decisions of state are made.  We can thank him for appearing in front of the camera and exposing himself so boldly for all the world to see.

2011182,5,B0001L3LUE,"""The Fog of War"" is an excellent documentary directed by Errol Morris, and based on several interviews that Morris made to Robert McNamara. In my opinion, this is a documentary that everybody should see for its educational value. Despite that, please don't be scared: it is also very engaging, and consequently it is unlikely you will be able to turn it off once you have started to watch it.

Far from being a film that glorifies McNamara, this is a documentary in which the former Secretary of Defense in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations expresses his opinions sincerely, and privileges the facts even if they don't always make him look well.  Moreover, ""The Fog of War"" includes visual and audio footage of historical value that backs up many of the things that McNamara points out, and that will be of interest to those who would like to learn more about Mr. McNamara, but also about American history.

At the time in which this documentary was filmed, Robert McNamara was 85 years old, and said that he was at a point in his life where he could look back and draw some conclusions regarding what he did in the past. Needless to say, the spectator will be grateful to be allowed to hear his opinions about his life, and the events that he participated in.  McNamara lived during the Cold (""Cold War... Hell, it was a hot war""), and went through the Cuban Missile Crisis and Vietnam, among other things. He was a professor, worked in the military, as president of Ford and as Secretary of Defense during the Vietnam War. McNamara didn't led a boring life, and he tried  to take advantage of his experiences (""My mission in life is to understand"") in order not to make the same mistake too many times.

I was shocked by the casual way in which he talked about the death of Japanese civilians during Second War II (""I was part of a mechanism"", ""I had to make it more efficient not in the sense of killing more people but of weakening the adversary""). I was also somehow surprised by some acute observations McNamara made regarding the nature of nuclear war, highlighting the fact that ""There will be no learning period with nuclear weapons. Make one mistake and you're going to destroy nations"".

The way in which McNamara tells the interviewer that after learning new facts about old events he discovered that he had taken a completely wrong course of action is pretty interesting. The problem, in many cases, had to do with the ""fog of war"", that is the lack of complete information that doesn't allow those in charge to make informed decisions during a war. If possible, pay attention to what McNamara says about the Vietnam War and the Cuban Missile Crisis. You will probably find some of those revelations interesting...

All in all, I think that ""The Fog of War"" is the best documentary I have watched so far, and I highly recommend it to you. You might agree or not with Robert McNamara's eleven ""lessons"" and the things he says, but I am sure that you will find them interesting, and worth thinking about.

2011183,4,B0001L3LUE,"Not really having known anything about Robert McNamara, other than who he was and that he was the Secretary of Defense during the Vietnam War, I went into this documentary on the recommendation of a friend and actually felt that I would not be able to endure the whole movie.  Well, to my surprise, McNamara is actually very interesting to listen to and his story both impressed and engrossed my full attention.

This documentary is segmented into 11 life lessons McNamara gives the viewer.  Unless your a politician or CEO of a large company, I didn't find these lessons to be something a ""common"" civilian would actually use.  However, it appears that these were more the 11 life lessons that McNamra had learned in his various impressive positions in life.

I found his stories on working at Ford Motors to be the most enjoyable part of the film.  I think the reason I felt this, was because it was a much more light-hearted piece of the film.  When he does begin to speak about his time as the Secretary of Defense, he obviously talks about the Vietnam War and how taxing it was on the AMerican people, himself and Lyndon Johnson.  It's fascinating to hear McNamra tell about how different his and Johnson's views on the war were.  Johnson wanting at all cost for America to win the war and do whatever necessary, where McNamra was really against sending in more troops.  And, there are actual taped phone conversations between him and Johnson.  For me though, the subject matter in this portion was just not something I could imagine sitting through again.  I do enjoy history of wars, but the Vietnam War is not particularly a subject I liek to get into.

Going back to his days at Ford Motors, McNamra tells the viewer about how he came with the conclusion that people need to be packaged properly in cars, in order to lessen the number of deaths due to accident.  He also goes into great detail on the number of statistical data he compiled and tests he ran in order to boast the sales of Ford Motors, by increasing their car's quality.  Very interesting stuff and again, McNamra is really a delight to listen to.  He is very engaging.

This documentary was definitely one of the best I have ever seen. You would think that this might be a boring movie since the central character is an octogenarian man who looks like he might be a bit on the senile side. However, McNamara is a lively and interesting man who keeps you engaged in the interviews.

The format of this movie is engaging because it draws upon excellent historical footage and uses excellent editing in the interviews with McNamara. The movie is divided into lessons, which are often very intriguing. You'll also learn about McNamara's rapid rise from going to college to being president of the Ford company to becoming the secretary of Defense under Kennedy. You'll learn about the struggles he went through and the very difficult choices he had to make. This movie sheds light on the reasons for the failures of the United States during the Vietnam War and how the protests were difficult on McNamara's family life.

2011196,5,B0001L3LUE,"I've long been a fan of the work of Errol Morris, but in this film he not only surpassed his previous efforts, he created one of the most genuinely terrifying movies ever made.  The terror comes from listening at length to Robert McNamara talk about his involvement in some of the crucial events of the past century, and realizing that the fate of millions and billions of people lie in the actions of men like this.  And there is nothing we can do but hope they get it right.

This documentary, which won the Oscar for Best Documentary, was originally meant to be a one-hour television documentary.  But the brief interview Morris had scheduled with McNamara extended considerably beyond what was originally intended.  It is essential to emphasize that this is not a raw interview.  It is carefully crafted, enhanced by many deeply artistic insertions, and structured more by Morris's perception than by any preconceived notion of McNamara.  For instance, the ""lesson"" of the titles are clearly selected by Morris to better structure the overall interview, though these lessons are often somewhat trivia and fairly unoriginal.  The structure is probably the weakest part of the film.  Nothing else is.

Along with some interludes dealing with McNamara's upbringing and education and his years at Ford, the film is essentially broken into three parts.  The first deals with the Cuban missile crisis, the second with McNamara's military service in WW II and in particular his job as an analysis for Curtis Lemay in the bombing of Japan, and Vietnam.

The sequence dealing with the Cuban Missile Crisis was good, but most of the details are familiar to anyone who has read any books dealing with the period.  The truly scary part came when McNamara recounted meeting with Castro some years after the fall of the Soviet Union.  One must first remember that the blockade of Cuba was intended to keep what was supposed to be the first nuclear warheads out of Cuba, and that the U.S. was prepared to invade Cuba to prevent this.  What Castro revealed to McNamara was that there were already more than a hundred warheads in place before the blockade, and that had the U.S. invaded, he would have attacked the U.S. with nuclear force.  McNamara then asked Castro if he understood that the U.S. would have retaliated and destroyed Cuba, and was then told that he did so understand, but that he would have done it anyway.  He then added, ""You would have done the same.""  The realization that Castro was right was the first truly scary moment in the film.

In a way, the segment dealing with the bombing of Japan was even scarier, because unlike the Cuban Missile Crisis the worst truly did happen.  McNamara was an analyst charged, among other duties, of evaluating the effectiveness of U.S. bombing efforts.  He produced one paper in particular that indicated that the accuracy of the bombing increased tremendously as the altitude from which the B-29s dropped their bombs decreased.  Lemay's decision was to have the bombers drop their loads from 5,000 feet instead of over 20,000, and to use incendiary devices instead of regular ordnance.  The results were devastating, as city after city in Japan was essentially destroyed, including 95,000 in a single raid.  The enormity of this can be felt when one remembers that 58,000 American troops died in all of Vietnam.  Morris contrasts one Japanese city and the destruction wrought with the American city it most closely resembles in size, and the percentage obliterated.  Just imagine a third to over a half of almost every American city being destroyed.  That was what happened in Japan.  Now, I don't want to engage in a debate about whether this was justified or unjustified, or whether the Japanese people ultimately were responsible through starting the war.  The point is that an absolutely stunning number of civilians were killed in actions that were without historical precedent.  And as with the Cuban Missile Crisis segment, all I could do was look at the screen with the realization that such decisions are left not with me or my neighbor, but with men like Robert McNamara and Curtis Lemay.  McNamara quotes his former chief as saying that if the U.S. had lost the war they would have been prosecuted as war criminals for what they did in Japan.

During the sixties, many regarded McNamara as the chief architect of the Vietnamese War.  In the documentary, as he has elsewhere before, McNamara indicates that his own preference was to pull out of Vietnam before it escalated, but that he was overruled by Johnson shortly after becoming president.  There is actually some credence lent to this by the inclusion of a phone conversation between Johnson and McNamara.  There are several other instances where he portrays himself as someone who waged a war in serving his president and country, but a war that he did not fully agree with.  Many will greet this with some scepticism, but wherever the truth lies, his involvement with the conflict is at the very least quite complex.

In the end, it isn't important whether one believes McNamara's apologia.  What is crucial is that such men have charge of our destiny.  Are we to blame for this happening?  Or are such things above our control?

The film is dominated by McNamara's monologues, but it is tremendously enhanced by many wonderfully wrought images by Morris and by an excellent score by Phillip Glass, though it is by no means one of his most memorable.

Rather than shocking by showing violence, we get a very rare glimse of history by the 85 year old Robert McNamera, who is a brilliant man with an incredible memory, and receites his memories not from a clinical view, but from a emotional factual view, AS HE SEES IT. He was right in the middle.

I am 53 and lived through Viet Nam, but we also get glimses of WWI and especially WWII.

We get to share the complexities, irrationality, insanity of war through McNamara's eyes.

Although it about McNamera's life, I don't see this as really about jodging Robert McNamera, but more of looking at the judgments of our leaders and ignorance of our leaders, history and how decisions get made.

The analogies with the murder, occupation and attempted take over of Iraq by the U.S. government and its corporate interests can really be seen.

As McNamera says as one of his ""rules"", Empathise with the enemy.

McNamera talked about the mistake that was made on how we could not empathise, know and understand the Vietmese and totally misjudged why they were fighting.

In the same way, we totally have misjudged, misunderstood Afghanistan and Iraq. But in this case, it is arrogence and money fueling this current occupation (where VietNam was not driven by  attempting to take over the country for Corporate reasons),  and really there is not caring about the enemy at all. We are loosing the Iraq, Afghanistan conflict as well.

I do, amazingly enough, and after watching this film FOUR TIMES already, have a slight beef with McNamara.

Yet, he can't remember if he gave the order for Agent Orange, a toxic chemical that stripped leaves off of trees but left thousands dead after Vietnam? Talk about selective memory.

I felt Robert put most of the blame on others. Be it General LeMay in WW2, or LBJ in the Vietnam War. He doesn't hesitate to take credit when its warranted though, as he did with Ford Motor Company as its president or as he did with the Cold War Crisis in Cuba.

Admittedly, Morris does a fine job of backing up most of McNamara's claims, making him guilty when he obviously was, and innocent when he blatantly is - as some audio files depict LBJ ignoring McNamara's lucid advice on gradually withdrawing from Vietnam.

The film will likely change your position on Vietnam, or at least challenge it - as it did mine. It shook me deeply, and left me with a higher view of McNamara and a lower view of Johnson.

A brilliant film, with or without the few cases of selective memory.",1120003200,,1492,4.490774907749078
2011200,4,B0001L3LUE,"Robert McNamara, the former Secretary of Defense and the man often considered responsible for the escalation of the Vietnam War, is the subject of this documentary about warfare. Mr. McNamara served under President Kennedy and later Johnson and he has much information to share about the Vietnam conflict and other military concerns from the 1960's era. He spends much of his time on this documentary directly on camera talking to the viewer about Vietnam; confessing the secrets he knew and explaining why he and others made the decisions they did.

McNamara spills his guts in this documentary, explaining why the Vietnam War was escalated and how now regrets his failure to stand up to Johnson and demand that American troops be withdrawn. He also offers some interesting facts about the Cuban missile crisis and how close the U.S. and former Soviet Union were to an all- out nuclear war. Many citizens at the time were rightfully worried, but according to McNamara, the situation was far worse than people realize. It's the closest we have ever come to a nuclear confrontation.

This documentary is well- organized and it is presented like a book, with chapters, conclusion, and even an epilogue. This makes it easy to follow, but it also makes it a little too academic. You feel like you really are reading from a book rather than watching a movie. And except for the background voice of the director, McNamara is the only person who talks directly to the camera on this documentary. There is archived footage showing Johnson and others giving speeches, but McNamara is the only one who talks directly.

It's nice to hear some of the truth finally revealed but this documentary, while informative, moves at a very slow pace. Since most of the film's time is spent with McNamara talking to the viewer, it lacks much entertainment value. Many people will fall asleep unless they concentrate on what is being said. There is little action, music, or anything else to keep the viewer entertained.

McNamara is obviously a man full of regrets and he gets a lot off his chest in this documentary. He falls short of making a full apology. But in the world of politics, what he says is sufficient. He made many mistakes and didn't tell the full truth when he was Secretary of Defense and now, on this documentary, he finally gets to tell his side of the story. It's an educational and eye- opening film to watch.",1119398400,2,2408,4.795180722891566

You will find out many things one never knew (or remembered).  The fire bombing of Tokoyo, but who realized that there were about 67 other cities firebombed?  He touches on the morality of that practice.  How tantalizing the idea of how the Viet Nam war might have been had Kennedy lived and Diem not been overthrown.  This is a documentary with a viewpoint, and that viewpoint is reinforced with the rapid presentations of images on the topics covered.  Sometimes you wanted to say -- slowdown.  Despite efforts of the interviewers to elicit a more detailed response on his feelings on the Viet Nam war, Robert McNamara declines to elaborate further than he has in the film, and invites viewers to read his books.  This film is quite a frank discussion of the highs and lows of his service.

Some of the language within the documentary has parallels with the current world situation, as regards statements about bringing democracy to Viet Nam, and how well the training of the Viet Nam army was going.  There is also good background in how the lack of understanding and knowledge of the other side's positions hampered significantly in what we did.

This is a very worthwhile documentary film.  Whether you think Robert McNamara was a hero or not, his role and career certainly spanned a large portion of recent American history.",1117324800,8,1498,4.80859375

Is this crap what they call ""artistic""?!? I had to take Aspirin pills for God's sake! Anyway, the only truly compelling thing about this documentary is the original recordings of conversations between McNamara and Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. Otherwise, I was either totally bored by the sluggish pace or annoyed by the so-called ""artistic"" filming technique. And speaking of McNamara, calling him a ""war criminal"" is about the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Did he make some bad choices? Yes. Do his lessons make any sense? No. But at least in my opinion bombing Vietnamese terrorists is nothing compared to what went on in 1930's and 1940's Germany. The very fact that this film won an oscar is only further proof that the Academy Awards is filled with complete morons. My advice is to stay clear of this snoozefest and look elsewhere for a compelling documentary about Cold War politics.",1116460800,7,1224,4.975609756097561

For all who think for a moment that RSM was candid and factual throughout this documentary interview, please read ""Dereliction of Duty: Johnson, McNamara, the Joint Chiefs, and the Lies That Led to Vietnam, by H.R. McMaster.  This book sets the record straight.",1116201600,26,568,5.075268817204301
2011214,5,B0001L3LUE,"I don't hand out five-star ratings lightly, and for a documentary to boot! Yes, this film won an Oscar for documentaries, but awards don't mean as much to me as they once did. In fact, I watched this film in a bit of a vacuum, before learning of its award-winning status. And it was simply a compelling narrative on multiple levels.

Robert McNamara came into the public eye as one of, if not the youngest assistant professors at Harvard and played an integral part in the intelligence leading to America's fire-bombing of Tokyo in World War II. After the war, he became the first non-Ford family member to become president of the automobile giant, only to be snatched up almost immediately by JFK to serve as his Secretary of Defense. That position put him in the inner sanctum for America's cold war era, through the Vietnam war.

This documentary is essentially an extended interview with the 85-year-old McNamara, intercut with film clips and taped conversations from the news stories ranging across his career. One would expect McNamara to use the platform as a justification for his positions and actions throughout the last six decades, but in fact, he's alarmingly candid about his errors in judgment and where he believes America's foreign policy (then and now) has been flawed. The film is arranged around Eleven Lessons that McNamara has gleaned from his experiences.

I'm not a big documentary fan, and my history background isn't extensive enough to make cohesive judgments on his interpretations of events, but the simple wealth of memories McNamara includes in the interviews and his wonderful articulation of the back stories makes this film one not to be missed. It's a brilliantly compiled and compelling narrative.",1114646400,7,1733,5.010416666666667

Speaking candidly about the lessons he's learned from his experiences of war, McNamara shares his controversial past with us, including a frank discussion about his role in the planning of the WWII firebombing of Japanese cities in order to maximise their destructive efficiency. In one night alone we are told that McNamara's B-29 bomber group burned to death 100,000 men, women and children in downtown Tokyo. Most of this history, plus other political insights on the Cuban Missile Crisis and LBJ's now released tape recordings on the Vietnam War was news to me and I felt that McNamara's war lessons and hindsights should never be underestimated or dismissed. As a matter of fact, there were many instances when the war footage was rolling and McNamara was speaking about the lessons from his life, I found myself wondering just how much wisdom have today's political leaders acquired from studying war failures from America's past? My conclusion having watched the Fog of War is, as you might expect, very little. The faces and the suits have all changed from Washington in the sixties, but the war rhetoric is still very much the same today as it was back then. This is a powerful political documentary and a valuable history lesson and I recommend that you buy it, watch it and Study The Past.",1114387200,3,1477,4.959677419354839
2011216,4,B0001L3LUE,"It's obvious that Robert S. McNamara has a hard time with these interviews. Struggling at times, seeking explanations for LeMays bombings on Japan and for the escalation in Vietnam, occasionally looking like a nervous wreck. Tears in his eyes.

McNamara, once described by Barry Goldwater as an ""IBM machine with legs"" has an opportunity here in 'Fog of War' to present his case to the public, and he does so with both integrity and honesty. From his early childhood he remembers the victory parade when the First War ended, how he fought to be the most ambitious and brightest student in school, the experiences he had during World War II and how he was offered the top spot at Ford company. JFK offering secretary of defense. Then there is the Cuban Missile crisis 1962. Those fateful 13 days when the world came inches away from nuclear war. Then of course the escalation of the Vietnam War during LBJ...

Those are the subjects and 'Fog of War' goes through it very skillfully. Presenting eleven lessons in the film. What were our successes? Our failures? What is in a sense human nature when faced with political turmoil and crisis on the brink of war, and indeed in times of war. What are we capable of if we examine ourselves?

These lessons are experiences by a man making decisions and giving advice to Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Simultaneously it casts a shadow on current events in the sense that it can't help but to raise important questions of war and peace today. Questions about US foreign policy in general.  That is reason enough to take the time it takes to watch `Fog of War'. It's interesting and thought provoking.",1113436800,5,1640,4.70383275261324

2011219,5,B0001L3LUE,"I was a young man during the Vietnam war, and I can remember Robert McNamara on television talking about the war.  To be honest, I never liked the man at that time.  Like many Americans, I grew to believe that the Vietnam war was wrong, and McNamara was one of the main cogs in the war machine.

This documentary puts more of a human face on the man.  Yes, he did participate in the planning of the bombing of Japan in WWII, and was Secretary of Defense in the Vietnam war.  But his lessons described in the documentary should be taken to heart by all Americans and especially politicians and leaders. In some portions of the film he appears to try and defend his actions, but only with partial success.  His eyes and his trembling voice belies the fact that he does hold himself at least somewhat responsible.

For people who are working towards peace, this is a must-see.  For people that think war is the answer, it is also a must-see. A wise person once said (to paraphrase) ""Whoever doesn't learn from the past is doomed to repeat it"".  After watching this video and looking at the events of our time, it drives the point home even more.

Watch it, realize that perhaps we are making the same mistakes that this man warns against.  Robert McNamara is obviously a very intelligent man.  What a waste that so much of that intelligence that could have been used towards the betterment of mankind, had to be used to facilitate the death of so many.

2011220,4,B0001L3LUE,"Robert ""Mac the Knife"" McNamara gives us a rare glimpse into the mind of the Secretary of Defense that led us into the tragedy of the Vietnam War.  He gives an interesting assessment of the Cuban Missile Crisis, when we avoided nuclear war by shear luck, as well as the moral ambiguity behind our raising of Japanese cities in WWII.  The eleven lessons he goes through should be considered by those leading us into another war where we are alone and opposed by allies.

  The first lesson is ""empathize with your enemy"" which gave a narrow way out of the Missile Crisis of 1962.  He labels the U.S., Castro, and Krushchev as ""rational""; very debatable as far as putting missiles in Cuba to begin with, LeMay's desire for war, and Castro's willingness to sacrifice Cuba in a nuclear war for Socialism.

  We hear taped conversations of JFK and Mac about Vietnam, and learn of Mac's belief that JFK would NOT have escalated the way Johnson did, Chomsky's views notwithstanding. Mac was fired by LBJ in 1967 and was out of the loop for ""Nixon doctrine in its purest form"", namely the massive bombing of Cambodia that led to the Khmer Rouge genocide (""The Killing Fields"" tells this story well).

  LeMay was quite correct: had we lost the war he and Mac would have been executed for war crimes committed in Japan. Mac was complicit in genocide in Vietnam, and with him Hanna Arendt's phrase, ""the banality of evil"" comes to mind.  In hindsight he is haunted by what he's done, but is reluctant to second guess history, or at least to publicly incriminate himself.  In the end we get the impression of an ordinary man who reveals a sentimental side as he becomes tearful a few times.

  I hope his vision of the future comes to pass: no more war.

That vision he has is a contrast to his actions in Vietnam.  Many have learned the lesson of the past.  Those in charge of the world now don't seem to be in this group.",1109289600,,1912,4.502906976744186

It should not suprise anyone that parts are ""clipped"" together because an 85 yr old pauses in mid sentence

2011223,5,B0001L3LUE,"It is hard to imagine it, but before Donald Rumsfeld, Robert McNamara was the most controversial Secretary of War since Edwin Stanton (FYI, he served under Lincoln).

The reviews all testify to the fact that liberals and conservatives have pro and con views of both the man, and the film which examines what he believes he has learned from two wars and decades of reflection over the consequences.  Some of his conclusions are admittedly self-serving, but taken in the context of the current American foreign policy, it is a credible contrast.

McNamara poignantly admits to making mistakes and perhaps questions the morality of those choices.  He still tears up when he recalls President Kennedy, and his anguish between loyalty to LBJ and wanting to untangle the mess Vietnam ultimately became reveal an honesty and humanity few public figures exhibit.

The score by Philip Glass adds depth and gravitas to an already somber theme (the brutality and pain of war), and director Errol Morris' use of extreme close-ups and off-kilter editing do much to reveal the pain, and at times desperation with which McNamara seeks to warn us of the potential consequences of our actions.  Particular in this regard is his recollection of Tommy Thompson's lone voice of opposition during the Cuban Missile crisis.  According to ""Mac"", it was pure dumb luck that saved us from apocolypse, and if not for a single voice of reason, it is likely that Kennedy would have followed the advice of the Joint Chief's and ordered an invasion of Cuba.  Castro later revealed that not only had there been operational warheads on Cuba (which could have killed tend of millions of Americans), but he had advised their use had the US invaded.  It begs the question, how would President Bush have handled this crisis, and what would have been the cost?  Extrapolation to the current day, and current handling of the war will yield interesting conclusions.

Viewer's may watch this film with pre-conceived notions of who Robert McNamara was, and the long-term effects of his decisions.  But as America enters its second year of Iraqi liberation/occupation, few men are more qualified than he is to warn us of the dangers of military/political hubris.

Michael Moore I thought he was the only that could present
topics like these but was I wrong. Errol Morris won an Oscar for his work in this movie and it shows.

Its just stunning imaginative, and hard hitting. There are no
lies in the film, no ramblings of a Republican spewing out
propaganda just cold hard fact. Morris interviews  Robert McNamara, the former Secretary of Defense in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and in great interview fashion McNamara
essentially bares his soul to the viewer.

Its not just a documentary buts its a reprieve of sorts for the
guy who has lead and participated in some of the most notorious
coverups and shames in American history from Vietnam to
the Cuban Missile Crisis to World War II.

Morris uses audio tapes captured from then President Lyndon
Johnson and McNamara to show us the sham that was Vietnam.

It wasn't about fighting the cold war people, it was about imposing our colonial ideals on a weaker nation. Just like
we did with the Soviet Union and left that nation in poverty,
there was never any proof they were going to attack us with
Castro, these are just the paranoid beliefs of one President
to the other.

McNamara tells us what we already know, there was no planning
for Vietnam It was a huge mistake that was financed merely
for profit. We were not liberating the Vietnamese, in fact
the Vietnamese did not want our presence.

He mentions the poor military technology that often made
mistakes such as when enemies attacked when they didnt.

He mentions that all his doings have been wrong and it took
many years as it usually does for a narrow minded individual
to wake up to the truth.

The 1995 meeting he had with a former Prime Minister sums
it up ""We were not fighting Communism, he says we were
fighting for our Independence"".

Like him or not, McNamara was present and made some of the most important decisions mankind ever made.  His experience is almost incomprehendible, and what he shares with the viewer will benefit mankind if we actually listen and learn from the lessons of history.

As an example, towards the end of the work, McNamara states that when he met with his Vietnamese counterpart, the officer told McNamara that the fatal flaw was that the US looked at Vietnam as a country which was going to bend over and accept Communism.  This view, however, was wrong and the Vietnamese really viewed the conflict as a war against occupiers, beit Chinese or Americans.  Hence, McNamara says that one of the lessons is to sympathize with your enemy.  Don't feel bad for them, but understand them.  If not, you go with the wrong context and face incredibly negative consequences.

To me, the one thing I'm surprised more people don't talk about is the information he shares about what he learned well after-the-fact about the Cuban Missile Crisis.  If you believe what RSM says (based on his conversations with Castro), had we invaded Cuba (as all of Kennedy's military advisors strongly advised him to do), they would have launched their already-operational nuclear missiles at the US, and would have killed about 80 million Americans (about 1/3 of the population of the US).

I think the lesson that The White House should be taking notes while watching is ""Be prepared to rexamine your reasoning."" I don't need or want to explain why.

However, it is clear from watching this that many of McNamara's perceived ""lessons"" of war are cast from his own personal guilt over his role in fire bombing Japanese cities in World War II and the foolishness of American involvement in Vietnam beginning in 1964. McNamara clearly is uneasy with his personal history, and that unease has much to say about his ""lessons"".

Furthermore, I'd have been happier if he's just come out and admitted that the Tonkin Gulf event never happened instead of simply implying such. This was the linchpin event leading to American involvement in Vietnam, after all. It would be good to have on the record, finally, that is never occurred.

The most telling portion of the film is McNamara's description of events surrounding the blockade in Cuba during the so-called Cuban missile crisis. The events McNamara describes were almost perfectly realized by characters in the 1964 film ""Fail Safe"". For me, this was the most enlightening section of the biograph.

Errol Morris, a diligent documentary filmmaker, has made films such as Thin Blue Line (1988), Cheap, Fast, and Out of Control (1997), and Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr. (1999).  These films depict stories regarding death row inmates, corrupt systems, eccentric characters, and the electric chair designer.  Robert S. McNamara, on the other hand, is known as the former General Manager for the Ford Motor Company, the Vietnam War architect, and the World Bank president. McNamara, well educated and intellectually gifted, approached all the jobs given to him with a strong methodological approach, which he supported from lessons he had learned previously in life.  Thus, Morris who often portrayed people's lives becomes a perfect match for McNamara who appears to want to share his lessons with the world in order to create an ever-growing source of enlightenment without causing further tribulations.

The documentary is organized in such manner that the objective of the lesson is evident, which is an essential tool for all teachers.  All lessons begin with a black screen with white text that states the lesson, for example, ""No. 1 Empathize with your enemy"", ""No. 5 Proportionality should be a guideline of war"", and ""No. 10 Never say never"".  From the objective screen, the film transitions to McNamara who begins to narrate directly to the audience about what he wants to have said, as he teaches the viewers from his mistakes.  Through the eyes of McNamara, the audience gets to see how he reacts as he discloses choices he's made in his past and how he remembered people.  This becomes very poignant as McNamara tells his story, especially when his eyes turn full of tears. Morris capture this moment through Interrotron, which is technology that captures the moment in first person.

The lessons shared dive into the history of World War II and the bombing of Japan, which was a result of research made by McNamara and others.  The many bombs dropped on Japanese soil led to the death of several hundred thousand people along with fire and atomic bombs.  McNamara also shares his lessons learned while advancing within the hierarchy of the Ford Motor Company.  McNamara's time at the Ford Motor Company led him into getting the job as United States Secretary of Defense, which forced him to face the Cuban missile crisis.  He then reflects on how near the United States and the world was to a nuclear war.  The simple deduction by McNamara was that they avoided a nuclear conflict by the chance of luck. In the back of McNamara's head were the results of World War II and the Cuban Crisis, as he had to deal with the looming Vietnam conflict.  The Kennedy assassination might have changed the course of the Vietnam conflict as McNamara recalls, as his eyes slowly fill with tears.

The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara offers a truly spectacular cinematic experience as it becomes a personal experience through the camera work of the film.  McNamara's past, right or wrong, offers many important lessons, which the audience should ponder, as there is a real nuclear threat in the world.  In conclusion, McNamara tries his personal best to make the world a better place, as he observes it with his own life long experiences.",1102464000,4,3901,4.922137404580153

2011255,5,B0001L3LUE,I am far to young to know anything about the life and term of Robert McNamera so I feel I am qualified to rate this film in an unbiased manner. Every citizan in the U.S. Should watch this movie as soon as possible. Perhaps you will notice the same arguements used to invade Vietnam as those used to invade Iraq. The old saying goes that those who ignore history are compelled to repeat it. We are repeating history and how many more of soldiers must die for a lie? How do you ask that last man to die for a lie? How do you explain to his mother or father that their son or daughter died for a lie?,1102291200,6,597,4.025210084033613
2011256,5,B0001L3LUE,"This is a fascinating documentary made all the more exceptional by Errol Morris' unique filmmaking style, an uncanny ability to allow his subjects to reveal their inner truths without forcing them out. Constructed around two three-hour, sit-down interviews, this film focuses on the 85-year old Robert McNamara, former Secretary of Defense under JFK and LBJ and still very much a controversial historical figure for his purported role in escalating the Vietnam War. Filmed in 2001 but released last year, it avoids the feel of a purely ""talking head"" approach by including haunting archival footage and rare, unheard audio tapes, all accompanied by Phillip Glass' melancholy score, the combination of which makes for riveting, sometimes troubling viewing.

One particularly difficult episode has nothing to do with the Vietnam War. It's about his role on General Curtis LeMay's team during WWII, when the frighteningly hawkish LeMay decided to firebomb 67 Japanese cities, killing 100,000 Tokyo civilians in one night alone in 1945. Ghostly numbers appear with visuals of falling bombs, while McNamara breaks down as he describes the horror, fully realizing the extent of his war crimes had the Japanese been victorious. Even though the raids received less press than the atomic bomb drops, they took as many casualties. McNamara offers no apology, but does ""empathize with the enemy"", one of his eleven key lessons, even showing some personal remorse for his accountability. In fact, later under JFK, he recognized how Khrushchev wanted to avert war while saving face during the Cuban missile crisis, and consequently avoided a colder war than had existed. But McNamara failed to apply this lesson to Vietnam. When asked whether he feels any guilt about his role in Vietnam, he clams up and states that he's already said all he's going to say about it. Yet, he breaks down again when he recalls the impact of the Vietnam War on his wife and three children, all opposed to the war. He goes so far as to acknowledge that the traumas associated with his tenure as secretary may have ultimately killed his wife. It is a painful and poignant moment, but McNamara feels compelled, even when stricken with grief, to footnote that moment with the disclosure that they ""were some of the best years of our life"" and that ""all members from my family benefited"" from his days in Washington.  The film gets rather gun-shy (pardon the pun) when explaining the relevance of lesson #9 (""Never apply military force unilaterally"") to the current Iraqi conflict. Morris actually goes to great lengths to point out that this comment has nothing to do with Iraq or 9/11, and McNamara refuses to make his life lessons relevant to current U.S. military policy and speak against the assault on Iraq.

Even more than his actual words are the posture and oratory style by which McNamara expresses his viewpoints and recalls events. Didactic and always in control, McNamara asserts his intelligence lucidly, and despite his age, he seems to be in perfect command of his memory. Physically, he is unsurprisingly frailer nearly forty years after the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. There are moments of honest reflection that Morris captures unobtrusively, and McNamara remains amazingly alert, articulate and at times, charming. It does seem ironic that lesson #11 (""You can't change human nature') even suggests the possibility that the previous ten lessons are meaningless. McNamara himself says, ""Never answer the question that is asked of you. Answer the question that you wished had been asked of you."" This seems to sum up his participation in this documentary, as he answers what he wants and ignores the rest, the same approach he has taken in justifying Vietnam. A complicated man piercingly captured by a master filmmaker.",1102204800,,3810,5.132045088566827
2011257,5,B0001L3LUE,"Anyone interested in learning American History should definitely watch this documentary of the controversial figure Robert McNamara and his involvement with Vietnam War.  But there is much more to McNamara and history than the Vietnam War.  I wasn't aware of his involvement in WW II assisting in planning and evaluating bombing in Japan.  I also wasn't aware of the fire bombs dropped in Japan prior to the drops of nuclear bombs.  One of his lessons relates to the scale required to reach a war decision.  He listed about 16 cities relating to American cities that were destroyed.  For example, assume 40% of Los Angeles and 90% of Chattanooga were destroyed in Japanese cities, along with 14 others.  This was with horrible fire bombs and is prior to nuclear drops.  His point was that the cost of war was horrible and you could tell he had struggled with involvement with some of the decisions.

As it relates to the Vietnam War which was destined to be controversial, the most compelling part was listening to tapes of Johnson and McNamara talk.  This allows the viewer to form his own opinion of what each were thinking.  The bottom line is we work for the President and if he is leaning one way, it's likely the staff will lean that way also.  And I don't mean this as a slam as it was compelling to listen to LBJ's thought process.  Not saying he was right or wrong just that he had an opinion.  Another interesting fact was that Kennedy was prepared to pull substantially out prior to the assassination of high Vietnamese officials.  Also of interest in this period was his task in selecting the burial spot of Kennedy.

The closing is quite dramatic.  With a close-up in a car of McNamara driving, he is asked why he didn't state his opinions after he resigned.  And like a good soldier, he fell on his sword and refused to second guess or cause more controversy.  What you see is an aging, intelligent man who gives people the opportunity to see through his as eyes as he was part of the power structure at the time of some costly and critical decisions.  And by his tears, you can see he knows everything wasn't perfect but he did his job to the best of his ability.  Frankly, I wish every cabinet member were required to give this type video exit interview and then be revisited 10 years later for an update.  I think it would make for compelling history.  If you are an American who lived through Vietnam or like American history, I encourage you to watch this and learn.  Don't shoot the messenger.  Pick the pieces that help you form an opinion and learn from them.",1101945600,,2581,4.558695652173913

All humans make mistakes but because McNamara was in a position of such great power the repercusstions of the mistakes led to the deaths of tens of thousands of inoccent lives.

This is perhaps the reason for the pervaiding aura of sadness McNamara conveys in this film. It also accounts for his inibility to connect events in his life to those around him. He can understand the problem with fire bombing civilian targets in Japan but cannot fathom his own part in it.

This is a facinating look into what happens when good men do bad things.",1101081600,,654,4.352459016393443
2011260,5,B0001L3LUE,"At 85, Robert McNamara has a lot to tell.  He served three years in the U.S. army during World War II, seven years as U.S. Secretary of Defense (invited by Kennedy), thirteen years as President of the World Bank, and briefly as President of Ford Motor.  Basically, this man has been through a lot and it is incredible that he is willing and able to discuss openly what happened back then.  Some label him as an ""arrogant dictator"" that cares more about facts and figures than human life.  Others praise him as the man whose leadership allowed the United States to stand tall through difficult times.  Either way, his life had a tremendous impact on the security and welfare of the world.

  The film presents ""11 lessons"" to learn from McNamara's life.  These are no ordinary lessons though; they are of utmost importance.  This is because these lessons were derived from ""war mistakes.""  For example, the bombing of a city could actually be considered a mistake.  These lessons have to be taken seriously as a matter of life and death.  McNamara stresses that ""errors of judgment"" in the past were acceptable in the amount of 3 or 4 mistakes, but with the advent of nuclear weapons there can be NO mistakes.  This is because entire nations are now at risk of annihilation.  McNamara is speaking from his heart when he says we have to ""try to learn"" these lessons and pass them on to future generations.

  The U.S. government ""looked down the gun barrel into nuclear war.""  ""Ninety million Americans targeted by Cuban warheads.""  ""It was luck that prevented nuclear war.""  And best of all, ""that danger still exists today.""  This is pretty serious stuff coming from former Secretary of Defense.  I was captivated at how McNamara's tone of voice is still optimistic about life, after so many people being killed under his watch.  I was equally captivated at his ability to find positive aspects of war.  It's all a little bit scary.

  This film is all about human mindsets.  Human mindset is what creates wars and is the only way to effectively stop war before total destruction ensues.  It is incredible to have the opportunity to explore McNamara's thinking so closely.  He was confronted with the core dilemma of war.  For example, if you spare 1,000 Japanese lives today, the result would be 10,000 American soldiers killed unnecessarily next month.  The reason for war is defense; kill or be killed.  Unfortunately, the reason is sometimes based on misguided assumption or lies such as the ""attack on the USS Maddox.""  The decision making process between the United States President and other high ranking officials during times of war is often marked by stress.  The recorded conversation between LBJ and McNamara is incredibly scary.  Simply put, LBJ, the President of the United States, has no deep respect for life and speaks with shocking arrogance. Throughout McNamara's career, he forced himself to answer many difficult humanitarian questions with ""yes.""  His mindset was often:  the strategic answer is ""yes"", the internal judgment is ""no"", therefore the final answer is ""yes.""  This is unfortunate...

  During this film, I could not help but question McNamara's inner motivation.  It really pulled at my emotions when McNamara described his grade school teacher.  He had a ""superb"" teacher who ordered the seats in rank according to grades.  Maybe this is where he first encountered the concept of ambition.  It almost brought tears to my eyes watching his facial expressions as he described how he competed against the other students.  Does he really take to heart Jefferson's words ""that all men are created equal?""  McNamara mentions his annual salary at least two times and that his family benefited from his status.  Money is important, but I do not think it should have any motivating force when your career deals with the juggling of human lives.  McNamara depersonalized war decisions.  There is no way he could have carried out his duty otherwise.  McNamara became very emotional when describing the loss of a single American wingman after the bombing of an entire Japanese city!  He could hardly speak without bawling when describing Kennedy's assassination, but gracefully pulls out statistics like 100,000 Japanese (many civilian) die in the fire bombing of Tokyo.  If the fire bombing was more than a mere mental concept, or if his own brother was one of those Japanese citizens, he would have broken down emotionally when telling about them.  His personal reality is real, war is just a bunch of concepts that won't go away.

  Towards the end of the film, it is obvious that McNamara is still haunted by unspoken grievances (personal and political).  I can see some recognition of his own regret and I cannot help but feel sorry for all he has been through.  He acted in the best of his knowledge and ability, but I think he still feels that was not enough.  All he can do now is accept it because it could not be otherwise, move on to greater things, and ""try to learn.""",1100649600,,5003,4.862396204033215

2011274,4,B0001L3LUE,"Robert McNamara is soft-spoken, sensitive, intelligent -- not an evil man, at least in conventional terms. He doesn't speak harshly, scowl or drip fire from his eyes. It is his central place in pursuing ravaging wars that makes him a villian in this eyes of man, and a patriot in the eyes of some. Hearing ""Mac"" describe himself is what makes this film so interesting.

The worst you could probably say about McNamara is that there is a serious disconnect between his calculated policies and the suffering, terror and death that resulted from them. McNamara is aware, at least intellectually, that his decisions caused suffering; that awareness is just another data point in his life, and doesn't seem to stop him or bother him all that much. At some level, every war counselor must dissociate himself from human suffering, otherwise military operations would be impossible to carry out. Ulysses S. Grant was not called ""The Butcher"" because he was unwilling to send wave after wave of Union troops into the maws of death at Vicksburg. At some point, however, you hope that those who take on this awesome burden will be humbled and transformed. McNamara, for all the death and destruction attributed to him -- from Hiroshima to Vietnam -- seems almost completely unaffected by the enormity of his historical role.

McNamara's recall is extraordinary, as is his ability to carefully categorize and logically lay out his experiences. But he is altogether a hollow (if not soulless) man, seemingly deaf to pain. Though he sees how others could regard him as a war criminal (based on his work against Japan during WWII), the charge (and its possible truth) doesn't affect him emotionally. It just seems to be another quantitative fact of life, like the weather or the result of a vote. He often seems wistful, but never sad or horrified.

""The Fog of War"" is a lesson about the kind of person used by government to prosecute wars. He doesn't necessarily have to be a warmonger or have deep-seated psychological scars. He can simply be the kind of human calculator with no more visceral attachment to feeding humans into the machinery of death than of feeding cars down an assembly line. Significantly, McNamara did both jobs. One can only wish that he stuck with the machines and left war to those with a deeper capacity for emotion.",1099872000,3,2329,4.861460957178841
2011275,4,B0001L3LUE,"The film consist solely of interviews with one Robert Strange McNamara (yes that's a real middle name), who as Secretary of Defense was involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War, not to mention the firebombing of Japan while serving in WWII. His story is roughly divided into 11 lessons, with the majority of them devoted to the Vietnam War. This is really a fascinating look back on our own history, where events become frighteningly demystified over the course of the film. Highlights include discussions on how close we came to full out nuclear war over Cuba, and how he would have been tried as a war criminal had U.S. lost WWII for firebombing Japan, where more than half of the civilian populations in dozens of Japanese cities were killed. Morris smartly didn't allow the film to degenerate into a talking head picture by using various archival footage and computer graphics, among other things, to counterpoint McNamara's statements visually. Morris employed that method with a high degree of effectiveness, and along with McNamara's engaging personality and surprising candor made sure we were never bored. Perhaps the most chilling aspect of the film is the discussion of the Vietnam War, which errily parallels our current war with Iraq in too many areas. You would think the mistakes made and the lessons learned from Vietnam would be applied today, but all we are doing is recycling the same mistakes and uncovering new ones. This should be a required viewing of any presidential administration and we can only hope the situation in Iraq doesn't deteriorate as badly as it did in Vietnam.",1098662400,2,1616,4.966789667896679

2011277,5,B0001L3LUE,"Robert Mcnamara was an academic who worked in the war with bomber command. He was responsible for quantitative analysis of the effect of the strategic air war. His first study found that 20% of American bomber runs over Germany were aborted largely as a result of cowardice. Mcnamara concedes that cowardice is perhaps a strong word but the reality is that US bomber groups were taking heavy casualties over Germany with 4% of planes being shot down each mission. The stark reality of those figures is that 10 missions would see 40% of the crews not return and 20 see 80% not return. As the normal tour of duty was 25 missions one could understand the response of bomber crews. One being given Mcnamara's figures Air Force General Curtis Lee May made the decision to fly personally in the lead aircraft of each mission and court marshal any crew who turned back.

Later in the Japanese theatre Mcnamara did the analysis that showed high level bombing was ineffective and as a result the United States adopted a policy of targeting cities by aircraft flying at a low level dropping fire bombs. The sixty largest Japanese cities were targeted. (The exceptions being Hiroshima and Nagasaki). The cities targeted by fire bombing suffered immense casualties with 40%-50% of those cities destroyed with civilian deaths estimated from anywhere between 400,000 to millions. Mcnamara concedes that if the US had lost the war he would have been judged a war criminal.

Following the war Mcnamara worked for Ford and using the same quantitative approach that he had to killing tried to sell cars. He was able to turn around the fortune of the Ford Motor company by the development of the Falcon and by making huge breakthroughs in driving safety. He then gave up his enormous salary to work as the Secretary of Defence in the Kennedy and Johnson administration.

The main power of the documentary probably comes from the discussion about the Cuban Missile crisis. At the time Mcnamara had not realised how close to nuclear war the world came. On discovering the fact that the Soviets had placed missiles on Cuba the Joint Chiefs of staff suggested an air attack and invasion. This was premised on the fact that they believed there were no nuclear war heads on the island and if they acted promptly they could get rid of the missiles before any war heads arrived. What the Joints Chiefs did not know was that the Soviets had already shipped 150 war heads to the island and that Castro has urged the Soviets to use them if Cuba was attacked. The world avoided by a whisker the destruction of the southern third of the United States and presumably most of the Soviet Union.

Mcnamara makes the point that war is a clumsy business. The people running it generally don't really know how to do it until they have done it for a while as shown by his examples from the Second World War. Nuclear was is just to destructive to be placed in the hands of the most rational of men because they can make the sorts of mistakes that can lead to unimaginable destruction.

The documentary covers the Vietnam War as well and the style of contrasting the interview of the 85 year old Mcnamara with contemporary footage and voice recordings of him speaking to Johnstone are fascinating. After watching this you are reminded how much the work of Michael Moore is that of an artful propagandist and entertainer rather than that of a deep thinker.",1097712000,8,3413,4.719798657718121
2011278,5,B0001L3LUE,"For anyone concerned about war and the repercussions of a single mis-guided bomb this documentary will shed some light on often ignored ideas about the subject of war.

This film contains mostly historical images and memories of the Cold War Era, World War II and Vietnam as seen through the perspective of Former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. Despite looking at war through hindsight the results remain the same, civilians die in despair, soldiers are placed in harms way and educated desk jockeys with a famous name direct it all behind the cover of powerful governments. I found McNamara to be both humble and amazingly sensitive to the catastrophe of what he subjected our American soldiers to during the Vietnam War. Even though McNamara was notorious for being arrogant, uncommunicative and boldly defiant when faced with protecting his presidents (Kennedy & Johnson), with age I think you will find he has mellowed and looked at his wake honestly and with some regrets. I found him to be similar to our current Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who has apparently not learned any of the lessons McNamara is teaching these days. I wonder if Rumsfeld will be so forthcoming in another 30 years to admit his weaknesses and errors along with his administrations.

McNamara claims that war cannot end without ruining communities and propagating death and destruction in its wake. He is honest in his description of the loss that other countries have suffered at our often expedient retaliations, for instant 100,000 people were incinerated in Tokyo alone PRIOR to dropping nuclear weapons during WWII and he feels that this occurred partly because of his analysis of what the weapons our government was developing could do. McNamara clearly states he felt he acted as a war criminal but was never tried. He also fully admits responsibility for the deaths of thousands of civilians. He questions the survivability of the human race when over 2500 nuclear weapons exist within reach of a single world leader who chooses to make a very bad decision on any given day. He feels that war morality is purely based upon winning and that leaders choose war because they believe what the see and not what is truth. Funny how that statement applies today! Interestingly enough even in Vietnam our generals were asking for more troops while the Washington desk jockeys reduced the call-up by half and this fact continues to occur today. Many aspects of this film will clearly resonate within the Iraq war. So how much evil will eventually equal good?

 Robert McNamara provides 10 lessons about war that need to be heeded by all future generations and leaders:

1. The human race will not eliminate war but can reduce brutality by seeking ""just"" wars.

2. Human fallibility and nuclear weapons will lead to destruction.

3. America is not omniscient and should not proceed unilaterally except in our own defense.

4. Moral principles are ambiguous but US Foreign policy should seek to avoid the carnage of 160 million dead in the 20th century alone.

5. We have failed as a nation to advance fundamental necessities of nutrition, literacy, health and employment both at home and abroad.

6. Corporate executives have a responsibility to their employees, their customers and to society as a whole.

7. Kennedy states: ""The primary responsibility of a president is to keep the nation out of war if at all possible.""

8. Individuals should be held responsible for crimes against humanity and a system of jurisprudence based on the International Court should be supported.

9. Terrorism will not be dealt with effectively without empathy.

10. The U.S. is contributing to the breakdown of the Non-Proliferation Regime and placing society at risk of terrorists obtaining weapons of mass destruction.

 It seems the fog has indeed been lifted but now it takes listening to. Afterall ""out of the mouth of babes"" may come something interesting but true wisdom always comes from the elders, those folks that have lived through exactly what we never want to live through again but are on the verge of doing. The most profound revelation I learned from this film was a fact that McNamara struggled over, he stated that the mere mention of withdrawing troops from Vietnam by Kennedy resulted in the military coup that killed Diem of South Vietnam and began the war in Vietnam. Aren't we currently doing the same in South Korea and will America only be left to blame once again? McNamara's learned wisdom is important to contemplate but more significant is caring how we are represented by our government to the rest of the world and realizing that all of the blood shed in our name can never be washed clean. It will always leave the threat of fog if we place our future in the wrong hands.",1097712000,5,4774,4.933915211970075

It's an incredibly important documentary and should be required viewing for anybody taking office.

This emotion impact of this film is surprising. Credit goes to both McNamara and Errol Morris who takes such a complex subject and simplifying it both visually and emotionally; by the end of the film you'll want to give McNamara another shot at redemption.",1096934400,2,816,5.082089552238806
2011281,4,B0001L3LUE,"Errol Morris interviews Robert S. McNamera, former US Secretary of Defense (1961-1968) under JFK and LBJ, and once CEO of the Ford Motor Company. McNamera later became president of the World Bank Group of Institutions from 1968-1981.

For those seeking answers to why the US went to Vietnam, you may be disappointed. McNamera purposely avoids this question as much as possible, but does admit that he and his fellow administrators made some crucial mistakes in judging the conflict in the first place. As for the Cuban missile crisis, McNamera recounts that, despite the best intentions of the US and the Russians to avoid the conflict, we almost didn't prevail (this section is a great supplement for those who liked the film, ""Thirteen Days"").

This film is not so much about McNamera's role in the Vietnam war for which he is most famous, but more about one man's view of war in general over the last century. McNamera gives a very honest and straight-forward response to the strengths and shortcomings of the JFK and LBJ administrations, and more importantly of himself. While this is not a documentary on the history of war, (WWII, the Cuban missile crisis, or the Vietnam war in particular), McNamera honestly reflects on the strengths and shortcomings of US foreign policies over the last century.

I was pleased to see that McNamera wasn't completely defensive concerning his role in the White House. He readily admits when he was wrong, which is refreshing to hear from any statesman. Even at age 85, McNamera gives a surprisingly candid response despite the fact that he is arguably one of the biggest scapegoats in history. He is not overly crotchety or defensive as one might expect. In fact, he has had enough distance and clarity to form some very honest opinions of himself and US foreign policy in general.

By the end of the film, McNamera brings up the question, ""how much evil must we do in order to do good."" He says this in response to the grudgingly admitted fire bombing tactics of WWII he personally developed to use against the Japanese. He argues that in WWII, the only way to end the war was to kill your enemy before he kills you. This is a gruesome statement, and one that he obviously makes with a bitter tongue. I don't believe he enjoyed performing any of his wartime tasks, but he believes they were the only measures available to him.

This is a compelling topic because at the highest levels of state, there may be times, when going to war may be unavoidable (ex. WWII), and that you unfortunately have to kill in order to preserve yourself. The problem, however, is always finding the right wars to engage in and the ones to avoid. And if you find yourself in a ""just"" war, is there any humane way to conduct it? Is there a civil way to conduct war? My assessments of McNamera's response to this subject is, no; war is hell. There is no such thing as a clean war. And, he states, war will not be eradicated in the future due to humankind's tendency for conflict.

McNamera says that the conventional wisdom is to learn from the mistakes of history, however, there is no learning curve in a nuclear war as he states. You cannot make mistakes. One mistake could mean the end. One nuclear missile launched is equivalent to all missiles being launched, and thus the end of civilization as we know it.

McNamera gives a list of eleven lessons of war in order to avoid war in the future. They are not mind-blowing or extra-insightful, but they do remind us of what McNamera is trying to tell us in this film: war is ugly, irrational, and usually avoidable only under the most luckiest of circumstances.

Overall, the film is worth seeing if only for the insight into the workings of the White House at the time. By the end of the film I found it hard-pressed to say if the US would have done better without him. You may have a hard time judging McNamera as well. He speaks like a war monger who hates his job and never wanted it; like a man who was faced with the ultimate decision, and completed the tasks presented to him as best he could, even if those tasks were some of the most grueling in history.",1096761600,2,4134,4.592140921409214
2011282,5,B0001L3LUE,"Director Errol Morris' latest triumph, ""The Fog of War,"" is a retrospective glance at some of America's toughest times, including World War II, the Cold War and the Vietnam War. These haunting moments are revisited through the view of Robert McNamara, secretary of defense under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.

McNamara stares right into the eyes of the viewer as he recounts his past, from his time as an Army Air Force lieutenant colonel to his stint as Ford Motor Company president to his work as defense secretary. We see McNamara as a faultless chap at the University of California at Berkeley in 1937. We discover McNamara's part in the development of seat belts, an invention that would reduce the incalculable number of injuries caused by automobile collisions.

We also learn of a botched firebombing over Japan that resulted in about 100,000 civilian casualties, a raid for which McNamara was partly responsible. Making this scene even more mortifying is McNamara's unflinching expression as he relays the event with hardly a grain of remorse. McNamara speaks of the avoidance of total nuclear war as sheer luck.

""Take it from me, we were literally this close to mutually allied destruction,"" McNamara barks, as he narrows the gap between his thumb and index finger to nearly a pinch.

During a recorded telephone conversation in 1965 with President Johnson, we hear McNamara's voice wither into nonexistence in protest to the commander-in-chief's vow to escalate the conflict in Vietnam.

In the film, McNamara outlines 11 lessons he has learned during his turbulent life. Below are three that come to mind:

Empathize with your enemy: McNamara said that had the United States attempted to empathize with North Vietnam, the conflict may have subsided with little loss of life. McNamara said that while the United States' purpose in southeast Asia was to prevent the further spread of communism, North Vietnam saw the conflict as a civil war between two radically different governing factions.

Seeing and believing can both be wrong: McNamara places emphasis on the incident at the Gulf of Tonkin. Was there or wasn't there a second attack? Was President Johnson's full-fledged bombing strike premature?

Proportionality should be a guideline in war: It's shocking how many Japanese civilians were killed or wounded during World War II before the United States dropped the atomic bombs.

Overall, the viewer gains a humanistic understanding of McNamara through this film. But even at 85, McNamara still won't elaborate on the more scintillating pieces of information, such as whether he thinks LBJ was mistaken in his efforts to accelerate the ""crusade"" in Vietnam.",1096243200,4,2685,5.168202764976958

2011295,5,B0001L3LUE,"This is a very compelling, if not all together satisfying interview with Robert McNamara.  Although, given the consequences of the Vietnam War, I suppose this is as forthcoming as we can expect McNamara to be.

Errol Morris instersperses the interview with videos and stills from McNamara's life, whose first memory is of a celebration after the victory in WWI, the war to end all wars.  To listen to McNamara, he never wanted to be the Secretary of Defense, but when pressed by JFK, accepted the role.  He said he never regretted it, although judging by the lessons he learned during those 7 years in office, one gets the sense that he has thought about it every day since.

McNamara has a razor sharp intellect that doesn't appear to have diminished with age.  He is so articulate on his positions, noting, repeatedly, the climate that was created at the time by the Cold War, and that almost any military action was considered justifiable during those dangerous times.  Through it all, McNamara tried to remain the voice of reason, but as he notes in the interview, reason doesn't always prevail.  One has to learn how to empathize with the enemy, which he felt Kennedy did with Krushchev in the Cuban Missile Crisis, but that none of them in the Johnson administration was able to get into the mind of the Vietnamese.

These lessons could well apply today, as we find ourselves engaged in a ""war on terror"" on two fronts.  McNamara, at the time of the crisis, bears more than a passing resemblance to Rumsfeld, and one senses the anguish that comes with the decisions that have been made, at least in McNamara.  We may think we are fighting for Democracy, but getting that message through to the belligerants in a country is another matter, and here, it seems, is where we lost the war.",1095724800,,1790,4.686900958466453

 FOG OF WAR is pretty much a monologue conducted by former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, with a few questions shouted by an off-screen interviewer. The film is divided into eleven ""lessons,"" introduced by a short, epigrammatic title card: Empathize with your enemy, Get the Data, etc.  Filmmaker Errol Morris won an Academy award and it's easy to see why.  Few extended talking head programs are this riveting.  It helps, I suppose, that this central figure in the early history of the Vietnam War was still so sharp and lucid, although still a tad reticent to engage in an in-depth discussion of Vietnam.  Smart use of archival footage and still photographs, and a pulsing undertone score by Philip Glass, make this a treat for anyone interested in Cold War politics circa 1965.",1095465600,,886,4.952702702702703

2011299,5,B0001L3LUE,"In ""The Fog of War,"" what we have is the fascinating, disturbing, perplexing, riveting, and sometimes maddening confession/explanation/""lessons-learned"" exercise of a formerly powerful ""lion,"" now in the late winter of his life and looking for...well, something.  The ""lion"" here is Vietnam War era Secretary of Defense Robert Strange McNamara, one of the ""best and the brightest"" of his era, and one of the most controversial - both admired and reviled -- figures in American history.  Like the other Kennedy/Johnson ""best and brightest"" intellectuals, McNamara attended the finest schools - Berkeley and Harvard - and rose to positions of great power, both in World War II as a top advisor to Colonel (later Genera) Curtis LeMay, as President of Ford Motor Company, and finally as Secretary of Defense under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson.

A student of philosophy, economics, and business administration, McNamara brought a fascinating, even unique, mix of skills to his job as Secretary of Defense during the 1960s.  Ultimately, however, despite McNamara's great intellectual abilities and fine educational background, in the end it can only be said that he was a miserable failure, in both the practical and moral senses.  For starters, McNamara must accept a significant part of the blame for the hubris, mistakes, misjudgments, and moral failings that characterized the entire Vietnam era.  More fundamentally, McNamara's entire approach, which was essentially to use data, statistics, and logical analysis techniques to bring hard rationality and cold efficiency to the inherently irrational, inefficient, unreasonable, chaotic, and bloody ""fog"" of war, led not to success but instead to disaster - in economic, national, and human terms.  As McNamara himself now concludes, in one of his 11 ""lessons"" that form the organizational structure of this movie, ""rationality will not save us.""

In ""The Fog of War,"" we watch and listen as McNamara attempts - forcefully, articulately, emotionally, and often awkwardly -- to explain his life as an individual human being and also as part of the broader picture; to admit that he made errors while at the same time shifting the blame for his (many) failings to others (Curtis LeMay, President Johnson) and failing to take full personal responsibility for his actions; to convey the lessons he feels he has learned from his life while simultaneously failing to follow those lessons to their logical conclusions or to integrate them in a coherent, non-self-contradictory manner; to hint at his own psychological/emotional struggles as a public and private figure while again stopping short of truly revealing much of his inner life (i.e., he mentions that his years as Secretary of Defense caused great hardship - tremendous stress, ulcers - for his family, yet he refuses to say more than that and still holds that those were great years of his life); and to wrestle - a bit belatedly and weakly, one might add -- with philosophical questions of right and wrong, such as ""in order to do good, you may have to engage in evil.""

As McNamara speaks, we also watch and listen to the historical images and audio recordings of World War II, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and Vietnam.  As McNamara stares at us directly (yet blankly, evasively, and disconcertingly - what is he thinking and feeling?), we also hear and feel the ominous, foreboding, anxious, vaguely disturbing Philip Glass score pulsing along in the background.  The combination of all these elements results in a powerful documentary film that fully deserved its Academy Award.

Just three more (brief) points about ""The Fog of War:"" 1) this movie should be required viewing for all of our top political and military leaders; 2) those leaders include, first and foremost, the current Secretary of Defense, Don Rumsfeld, who bears an unnerving resemblance to Robert McNamara in many ways; and 3) if it does nothing else, this movie powerfully argues for not placing too much faith in our leaders, because as McNamara's Cuban Missile Crisis example points out so well, they often are just as confused, caught up in their own misconceptions, stuck in their own worldview, and dependent upon blind luck as the rest of us.",1094860800,,4227,5.172767203513909

Given that there are 50,000+ plus names up on the ""Black Wall"" and armed with all the new information you have acquired on McNamara from McNamara... plus all the Post Viet Nam related deaths, suicides, emotional struggles etc...

Why isn't McNamara in prison?

A very insightful interview, I recommend reading the McNamara autobiography as a precursor to viewing this.  A statistician such as McNamara was able to calculate his way through the mire of Viet Nam; strongarming policy,and making tactical decisions he had absolutely no business making; furthermore he justified his actions/decisions.  Was his justification actually self-denial amid the abysmal failure of Viet Nam and the consequencial negative impact on hundreds of thousands of the effected generation!? Amazing!

I have to ask the question that:  Given that there are 50,000+ plus names up on the ""Black Wall"" in addition to all the revealing information on McNamara from McNamara, add up all the Post Viet Nam related deaths, suicides, emotional and substance struggles and abuse.

Why isn't McNamara in prison?

Documentaries (and books) such as this put a whole new slant on the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, they were as corrupt as Nixon, and as slippery as Clinton.  I really wish all who laud and praise the Kennedy administration would realize what a negative influence that administration had on so many of the generation it put to war.

After Nixon negotiated a ""Peace with honor"" tradeoff with Hanoi and after the debacle was finally over, was JFK's oft-quoted  ""ask what you can do for you country"" in reality a verbal death knell?  What were people in power thinking as thousands of America's youth joined Kennedy on the hillsides of Arlington cemetery?

2011330,5,B0001L3LUE,"It is the tragedy of American politics--particularly in its foreign policies--that obtuseness and intractability are admired and confused with stability and willpower, while the ability to take a measure of a situation, speak of it as it is and act prudently is viewed with suspicion and derision. It is in this way our presidents paint themselves and the country into corners, and usually leave future generations to sort out the mess.

We see this in watching FOG OF WAR, a documentary covering not just the Vietnam era, but Robert McNamara's life and career. As an 85 year old man, McNamara no longer has to please anyone, and he seems determined to leave not just the historical consequences of his career to us, but a legacy of introspection to future generations. Anyone arguing that he is not just apologizing, which is rather simplistic, but rationalizing his career are partially right, but his searing critiques of himself and US policies cannot be ignored. In many ways, it is the questions that he himself raises, and leaves open, that are the most fascinating insight into his moral development in old age.

The segments on his WWII service are well worth watching just for themselves, for this reason. McNamara was at the forefront of applying quantitative methodology, statistical analysis, to the prosecution of war. This is something that the US pioneered and remains to this day its most effective practitioner. The same techniques of analysis that New York uses to combat crime were applied to find the most efficient ways to wage total war. That the answer was, in the end, to slaughter as many enemy civilians as possible was merely a logical conclusion of the methodology, the moral aspect didn't factor into this. The documentary makers' graphics of bombers dropping numbers and symbols on cities perfectly captures this.

It's been some time since I watched this, so I won't go into detail. However, I think everyone should see this; every high school civics class should watch it; and every college campus should present it. The complexity of political morality comes through. You could also tell that the makers challenged McNamara; in the rare instances you hear their questions to him, it is usually in an incredulous tone. I think that challenge was something McNamara was determined to meet in as honest a way as he could, and it enhances the power of his words.

Parts of it are organized into chapters, ""McNamara's lessons of war."" It is an interesting and I think fruitful approach. After Vietnam, American society approached the war mainly at the visceral level, through movies and painful subjective accounts, and reflection on the social divisions of the era. Recently, it seems that Vietnam is being approached on a more sophisticated level, in terms of the questions raised and the answers given or discovered. FOG OF WAR contributes to that.

McNamara, we are reminded, also served for some time as president of the World Bank. Knee-jerk anti-globalists, while they have a lot of reasonable objections to the destructiveness of the market religion, like to focus on a few institutions as their bogeymen. The incompetence and intellectual bankruptcy of the IMF needs no mentioning, however I suggest the rabble-rousers consider carefully McNamara's account of the World Bank.

The DVD extras are interesting in their own right, and a few serve to amplify the documentary. I suggest the DVD THE TRIALS OF HENRY KISSINGER as a fitting companion to this. Fully deserves five stars.",1092441600,3,3516,5.04302925989673

The documentary segments the film into eleven ""lessons,"" most, unfortunately, are too banal to be accurately described as lessons. (""You can't change human nature""--no kidding.)

That said, the documentary is otherwise outstanding, comparing both McNamara's early life and its culmination as his seven years as Secretary of Defense. Not all of it would, under normal circumstances, seem to be intertwined, and yet you feel that his time at Ford at least in some way affected the later decisions made.

There are many dimensions to this film: we can see, on the base, the archived information presented in an informative, rather than dry, manner, such as the tapes from both Kennedy and Johnson. This supports with McNamara's commentary, rather than presenting nuggets of long-ago recorded conversations and work McNamara around it. McNamara himself is surprisingly lucid given his age. Alas, as the focus of the documentary, there's little in the way of competing arguments, but McNamara has been forthright in his decisions (in his book, ""In Retrospect,"" among other forums) so he has little incentive to be elusive.

This movie, along with its eerie score, is worthy of watching by anyone--those ignorant of Cold War politics, those who lived in the turmoil of the time, and those who are slightly informed about the Vietnam War and would like to see significantly more depth without being bored. While the documentary can be a bit too proud of its own cleverness-interposing Japanese cities with American cities of comparable size along with death rates is clever, but not repeated 40 times-there's a lot more positive to it than negative.",1091836800,3,1768,5.174825174825175
2011334,3,B0001L3LUE,"The Fog of War has received rave reviews on Amazon.com, but this review will not add to that long list.  Fog is the word most appropriate for McNamara's discussion of Viet Nam.  After two hours of hit and miss questions and answers, we are left with the conclusion that Viet Nam was a mistake and that McNamara was not responsible for it; that honor goes, according to McNamara, to Lyndon Johnson.
McNamara was a statistician/accountant who understood the numbers, but he was not a leader who could translate his knowledge into forceful action.  Instead, it appears as if he supported Lyndon Johnson long after he realized that Viet Nam was going to be a war we could not win.  Additionally, the information that he received about Viet Nam was sometimes innacurate and misleading.  In hindsight he knows that it is unsafe to trust as fact reports given by subordinates.  Without a historical perspective with which to judge the data he received, he arrived at false conclusions which resulted in the deaths of 58,000 Americans and millions of Vietnamese.
Not only was McNamara ignorant of history, but he also understood little about ethics.  He concludes that it is morally acceptable to do evil in order to arrive at a greater good.  Machiavelli, in The Prince, would certainly agree with McNamara, but The Prince should not be a handbook for American foreign policy, even though recently it appears that Machiavelli's recommendations are alive and well in American government today. Torturing and abusing Vietnamese and Iraqi prisoners may provide useful information, but few would argue that the evil of torture is justified by what we learn from it.  McNamara would have done well to study Kant's Categorical Imperative.  If we approve of torture, or firebombing in the example given by McNamara, we must recommend that all other nations follow our example, at least according to Kant's Imperative.
My guess is that McNamara is a much smarter man than appears to be the case in The Fog of War.  Unfortuntely, the director made McNamara appear to be often confused about the facts which were his stock in trade. He is an old man reminiscing about his life in public service and his memory is conveniently selective and self-serving.
Even so, I can recommend this film with the reservations noted for this reason.  No viewer will ever think again that our safety and well being as a nation depend on rationality.  McNamara prided himself on being a logical man of reason and often he was.  That did not stop us, according to his own testimony, of coming an eyeblink away from the apocalyse during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Luck was on our side then.  After watching The Fog of War many viewers will ask: When will our luck run out? This is a question well worth asking.  Hopefully some will answer that we must replace evil intentions and actions toward other countries with moral behavior that stands as an example for the world to follow. This imperative puts us on the right if not always the winning side.",1090108800,20,3013,4.842105263157895

Unfortunately for McNamara and the 58,000 American boys who died in the rotting jungles of that fetid wasteland, the models failed in the real world of revolutionary zeal and little Asian guys in black pajamas, rubber flip-flops and with scruffy haircuts, who apparently never studied such methods in cutting-edge calculus and so were inexorably immune to such weighty prognostications.
It is bizarre, to say the least, then, to view this rambling monologue of twisting and winding excuses that the frail but still drop-dead intellectually gifted McNamara uses as he so frantically attempts to stamp his own brand of revisionist reinterpretations on the history of the Vietnam era and his own participation in it. Like the ghost of Iago, then, McNamara emerges from his own self-imposed splendid isolation of the last thirty years to set us all straight on what really happened back when bombs were flying and kids were dying. As the facts clearly show, he continued to support the prosecution of the war long after he knew it was a lost cause.
Certainly this is spellbinding stuff, yet anyone who is as well informed regarding the particulars McNamara slips through so effortlessly understands he is often playing fast and loose with the historical facts, and that he ignores many pieces of evidence which contradict his take on the way things unraveled. Indeed, what it appears to reduce to in the end is a brilliant but haunted man still attempting to justify, by virtue of his own considerable charm, intellect, and self-serving guile, and through painting an inaccurate and one-sided portrait of the zeitgeist of the post WWII era, his own role in the single most disastrous American war (at least until Iraq). This is an extended interview and documentary you will not want to miss. Enjoy!",1089763200,14,2228,5.057065217391305
2011337,4,B0001L3LUE,"For his award-winning documentary, ""The Fog of War"" - a study of the moral complexities of war and those who wage it - Errol Morris has found the perfect subject in Robert S. McNamara, the man who served as Secretary of Defense in the early days of the Vietnam War.  McNamara is astute, articulate, lively and thoughtful, and as a wizened man of 85, he is able to look back on the events of his life with the kind of analytical clarity and sober-minded judgment that only old age can provide.
Wisely, Morris allows McNamara to speak for himself, providing very little in the way of poking and prodding as interviewer and filmmaker.  McNamara looks at his long and varied career through the prism of eleven lessons he's learned about life and human nature.  Each of these revelations is tied into a specific chapter of that career and life.  We see McNamara taking stock of his actions as they relate to World War II, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and most notably, of course, the Vietnam War, in each case ruminating aloud about the moral imperatives and ethical decisions he faced on a daily basis as his crucial role in all of these events played itself out.  Some may find his comments to be a bit self-serving, an attempt to whitewash the facts and minimize his own responsibility, particularly as concerns his involvement in the Vietnam War.  Yet, in many instances, McNamara accepts the judgments of history and admits his culpability, even if he generally does so in a broader war-is-a-necessary-evil context.  There are moments during his reminiscence when McNamara actually wells up with tears, thinking about the immense loss of life and personal tragedy that inevitably result from man's insane obsession with destroying his fellow man - while all the time acknowledging that at times wars must be fought and casualties endured for a greater cause.  All throughout the film, McNamara returns to this refrain, additionally warning us that, in the nuclear age in which we live, the human propensity for warfare could very easily lead us over the precipice to global devastation and annihilation as a species.  We have little reason to believe that McNamara is not being sincere in his comments, although some more cynical viewers may wonder if he isn't merely saying what he thinks he should be saying in order to secure a more favorable reputation and image for himself as his life comes to a close.  If that is, indeed, the case, Morris seems blissfully unaware of it, since he basically accepts McNamara's statements at face value.  As an added - and perhaps unintended bonus - much of what McNamara says has a pertinent, timely, almost prescient ring to it, as the U.S. struggles through yet another foreign engagement, this time in Iraq.
As a documentary filmmaker, Morris demonstrates his usual skill at combining archival footage with one-on-one interviews as a way of bringing his subject matter to life.  The caveat here is that Morris provides no counter voices to challenge any of McNamara's statements or his interpretation of events.  Yet, as McNamara relates the story of his life, a fascinating history of 20th Century American foreign policy emerges in the background.  We see many of the seminal figures from McNamara's time playing out the roles history and the fates assigned to them, from John Kennedy to Lyndon Johnson to Nikita Khrushchev to a whole host of other key players on the world stage.  In addition, Philip Glass and John Kusiak have provided a haunting score to go along with the haunting images.
As the title suggests, this is a complex film on a complex subject and McNamara and Morris leave us with no pat or easy answers.  That is as it should be.",1089504000,7,3689,4.841017488076312
2011338,5,B0001L3LUE,"""Spellbinding"" is the word that comes to mind when I think of director Errol Morris's ""The Fog Of War."" I sat riveted for the documentary's run time, 107 minutes, and experienced a gamut of emotions as I watched former Secretary of Defense, (under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson), Robert Strange McNamara, tell his off-screen interviewer the whys and wherefores of the US War in Vietnam. Most of the film features Robert McNamara talking to the camera - no flashy post-production elements are needed. The interviewee provides more than enough drama. Mr. McNamara was one of the war's architects and he goes through all the events leading up to the escalating conflict that became ""our Vietnam,"" giving the viewer a behind the scenes perspective. The film is annotated with some amazing archival footage and declassified White House tapes. Much of this film footage is new to me, and I have seen a fair share from this period.
I grew up in the 1960s and lost many friends and classmates in this seemingly never-ending tragedy. I watched many who survived come home maimed in body and spirit. I don't know why Robert McNamara decided to make this documentary, one of the best I have ever seen, but anyone interested in history, especially the period surrounding the Vietnam conflict, will appreciate this eye-opening account. The film may raise more questions than it answers. It does, however, provide a credible firsthand account from a man at the center of the action. Hopefully, our national leaders, past present and future will see it and benefit from it.
McNamara selected eleven lessons, (philosophical maxims), of life he believes most important, and these provide the documentary's framework. Morris succinctly chronicles McNamara's life, painting a portrait of an American giant, with such impressive credentials and intellect that President Kennedy spent some significant energy wooing him away from his job as President of the Ford Motor Company - the first non-Ford to hold that title - to become part of his cabinet. His past experience, and his ability to think and reason enabled him to quickly move into his new position as leader of the Department of Defense and major policy maker. However, as Mr. McNamara stresses in one of his lessons, ""reason has its limits."" One of McNamara's main themes throughout seems to be that even when dealing with intelligent, rational men, the baser parts of our nature often come to the fore. History demonstrates that apparently we don't learn from our mistakes. Morris doesn't have to specifically draw parallels to today's international situation for the similarities to be striking.
The eighty-six year old former Secretary appears to be in full command of his intellectual powers as he recounts what he learned from the Cuban missile crisis, and details some other experiences, such as his contributions to the World War II firebombing of Japan under General Curtis LeMay. He reflects on his successful work during WWII and asks, ""How much evil must we do in order to do good?"" He points out that, had the United States lost the war, he and LeMay would probably have been tried as war criminals. Reflecting on both Japan and Vietnam, he asks, ""What makes an act immoral if you lose a war and not immoral if you win?"" Of course, it is the victors who write history and determine what is justified.
Many on the political left have criticized Morris for not being ""tough enough"" with his questions and follow-ups. But this documentary is Mr. McNamara's story, as he sees it, in retrospect, and as he chooses to tell it. It is not an oral history, per se, it is more - the story of one man in the seat of power at a critical period in our nation's history. The focus is on Robert McNamara's integrity and beliefs and the manner in which he explains and rationalizes his part and place in history. He does accept a degree of culpability for Vietnam and for Japan. I may be overly sentimental, but I was transfixed by McNamara's expressions and emotions throughout. This is one man, I believe, who bears a heavy burden and has carried it for a long time.
Philip Glass's mesmerizing, somewhat edgy, score provides a haunting backdrop to the film. Foggy images, the ghosts of the war dead, float across the screen at various points, interspersed with McNamara's logical narrative, quoting statistics of death, percentages, numbers. Towards the documentary's conclusion, McNamara refers to the fact that ""the human mind cannot comprehend all the variables"" in war and finds itself overwhelmed...as if in a fog. Thus he supplies the movie's title - a phrase meaning that war involves variables too complex for the human mind to grasp.
Even if you don't usually watch documentaries, see this one. It is stunning!

2011339,3,B0001L3LUE,"The Fog of War is a movie about the wars in which Robert S. McNamara played a role. First as planner of the World War II and later as part of the JFK and Johnson administration. The movie is part interviews, stemming music and war footage that support the theme of the movie that War is horror. In a way, the movie disturbs because from what Mr. McNamara is telling about the executive body. It seems to be run by quite naive people or is it Mr. McNamara that gives that impression? For example Mr. McNamara says you need to empathize with your enemy, to me that sounds as a big platitude. How else can you even think strategically? Or what to think of the fact that Mr. McNamara tries to clear his own fog of war, when he after the big conflicts, when he him self is no longer in power but his counter parts are, tries to find the truth by talking to his former opponents. Does he really think he gets answers that are context free of today's affairs? And not to mention Mr. McNamara cheap shot at saying that the US should never start a war Unilateral, clearly pointing to the war in Iraq, because Vietnam was also a Unilateral War. But what Mr. McNamara forgets to tell is that the US is not acting unilaterally in Iraq as it was in Vietnam, in Iraq the US has the support of many nations, unlike Vietnam, only not of certain former allies or of the UN.
This is a technical good movie, not mere anti war propaganda, but one that shows the horrors of war and the complexities that surround it. But most of all it shows the struggle of a former leader who wants to find Kantian certainty of morality, one he cannot find. To me this movie show the first steps for America to get in terms with the traumatic lost war in Vietnam.",1089331200,,1727,4.2522796352583585
2011340,4,B0001L3LUE,"A fascinating panorama of the twentieth century as revealed through the life of Robert McNamera.  Morris uses primary source materials like old photos and taped transcripts of McNamera, Le May, Johnson, Kennedy, and Roosevelt to perfection, and this gives the film considerable power.
The film maker goes far beyond his peers in his efforts to create authenticity (such as with the man-operated, life-size, air force sortie tracking board).  His stylistic touches are riveting- examples of this are the dominoes dropping across a map or egg cartons and skulls falling from atop a staircase.  My favorite shot was the beautiful, forelorn depiction of President Kennedy sitting patiently and poised to speak before a camera.  This is something that the viewer will never forget. The quote from Johnson saying ""we don't want more war and we don't want more appeasement"" will make you wince as it explains the complete absence of strategy in the Vietnam Conflict.  In fact, no documentary or motion picture that I've ever seen sums up as well the causations behind the Vietnam tragedy.
What keeps me from giving this five stars is due to some serious logical leaps being present in the narration such as McNamera being sure Fidel Castro posseses a rational mind.  Also, the guilt that is implied over the firebombing of Japan is tenuous without a discussion of the nature of Imperial Japan.  I don't personally buy that he and Le May could be considered war criminals in light of the Japanese aggressive attack against our nation.  The invader's record in China, particularly at Nanking, suggests clearly that we were fighting a just war.  Certainly any of those nations occupied by Japan would agree that there was a pressing need to hurl them from the lands they ravaged.",1088985600,7,1769,5.010238907849829

Although the film has some powerful moments, it is ruined by Morris' overuse of film footage, photographs, and unnecessary filmmaking.  We are constantly bombarded by five second shots of graphs, numbers, and words as they flash on and off the screen in speedy fashion.  It gets annoying after a while.

The Cuban Missle Crises:  Years afterward, MacNamara was in Cuba visiting and met with Fidel Castro.  Castro told him that he was recommending to the Soviet leadership to nuke the United States, even though Castro acknowledged that would mean the obliteration of his own county, Cuba -- and nuclear war on a vaster basis, thus we came that close to total nuclear war.  As a child of ten at the time, I had no inkling how serious the situation was besides the nuclear attack exercises that we did in school -- like going under one's desk was going to improve the survival rate several miles from MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa.
The lessons are worth viewing again -- and especially worthwhile for the current administration, which clearly hasn't learned these lessons regarding war.",1088553600,2,965,4.795180722891566

2011345,5,B0001L3LUE,"This is an impact film narrated by McNamara; the format is that of an extended interrogation with an invisible interviewer placed behind the camera (or the tv). The film was produced beautifully with lengthy scenes of McNamara talking (at the present time as it were), pictures of battle grounds and of the dead, fast glimpses to numbers and percentages of the effectiveness of various attack methods all to symbolize - the way I see it - the inefficacy of war. Recordings of discussions between McNamara & LBJ, Kennedy and others are introduced together with historical pictures and documents.
I feel that McNamara's statements were sincere and that he was very accessible throughout the taping until he had to give yes/no responses on his share of the blame for the grave losses both sides suffered during the Vietnam war. He limits himself to stating, in the words of his interlocutor, that ""you're damned if you do and damned if you don't"" to which he adds ""I'd rather be damned if I don't"". In my opinion that on its own was a suitable answer. He stated that he has made mistakes and in the end apologized for them.
The movie covers periods between 1918 when McNamara was 2 years old and the country was celebrating the end of WWI to 1995 when he got to visit Vietnam and talk to one of his former enemies when he got to understand that what US looked at as a war of liberation the opposite camp saw as a civil war. Although he lists 11 lessons I would have added a 12th which combines two of McNamara's statements in what should be a proper advice to the current cabinet: If a majority of countries that have a similar set of beliefs as ours disagree with military action as the solution to a problem we must reevaluate the situation and in the face of misinterpretation any intelligent and able military leader will admit to making mistakes because such is the human nature: predisposed to failure.",1088294400,8,1905,4.622418879056047

Harvard Professor, Industrial Chief Executive Officer, Secretary of Defense to President's Kennedy and Johnson, Robert McNamara personally guides us with a detailed and extremely well-documented look into many of the strategic decisions and personalities of the 20th century: from the systematic fire bombing of  Japanese civilians during World War II by U.S. Air Force General Curtis Lemay; to decision-making by U.S. President Kennedy, Cuba's Fidel Castro, and the Soviet Union's Chairman Nikita Khrushchev during Cuban Missile Crisis that could have led to the world's first exchange of nuclear weapons;  to the strategic failures by the U.S. in the planning and execution of the Vietnam War.",1088294400,4,1105,5.559523809523809

I guess it will be forgotten that Japan attacked the U.S. first and Japan even after being beaten so badly refused to surrender until it was shown that they could be really be wiped fom the face of the earth. But according to this film the U.S. is the bad guy in WWII. Also, it is fascinating that Mr. McNamara is able to remember the end of WWI when he was 2 years old but he was not able to remember if he authorized agent orange spraying in Vitenam. Selective memory sure is convinient. Finanlly, I would like to congratulate Mr. McNamara for the fact that less than half of American soldiers died in Vietnam under his watch. For the record, approximately 58,000 American soldiers died in Vietnam. McNamara stated approximately 27,000 soldiers died under his watch. Technically it is less than half, but not by much.

2011348,4,B0001L3LUE,"At 85, McNamara has lost little of his ability to speak articulately and to remember details from conversations that took place more than 40 years ago.  He is a little weaker in drawing meaningful conclusions except for a relatively lame list of ""lessons"" that he wants to impart to us.  Boiled down to essentials, these lessons (such as ""get the data"") are simply warning us to make sure we know what we're doing before we fight a war.  The lessons fail to give any real insight into what actually went wrong in Vietnam and how we might have prevented it.
In reading past articles about McNamara, I thought he had become contrite about his role in the Vietnam conflict and would bare his soul to all who would listen.  I'm not saying he SHOULD be contrite, I'm just saying that I thought he was.  But this movie offers no real mea culpa on McNamara's part.  By the end of the film, I had the impression that he was clearly blaming Lyndon Johnson for the escalation of the war.  And, after blaming Johnson, Mc Namara grudgingly takes personal responsibility in that maddening 90's style that says ""I'm not responsible, but will accept responsibility.""  Sort of like, ""If you want to blame me, go ahead.""
The movie is weak only where McNamara is weak: it offers few insights that most of us didn't already have intuitively.  But the movie does reveal riveting aspects of McNamara the man.  It dwells on tight close ups of the face so familiar to those of us old enough to remember when it displayed infinitely more arrogance than it does today.  That ancient face gives away little, though, except for the eyes, which betray the uncertainty and guilt of the man.  Those eyes are fogged with the effects of war and with the self-preserving instincts of the public servant.

The movie, however, is mostly just McNamara justifying the horrendous things he and Curtis Lemae did in Japan and the things he did in Vietnam.  This movie was billed as a movie that would make people think twice about war but Morris doesn't challenge McNamara at all the entire interview.  McNamara even admits that he answered the question he wished he had been asked during press conferences instead of the one that had been asked and he certainly uses that tactic in the movie.

He's learned a lot, and this film is a lesson to the world regarding the difficulty of decision-making at the very top levels.  He's honest about his mistakes and feels sorrow about the suffering.
There's a lot of archival footage going back to World War II and he raises the questions about the war in Japan and the firebombing which killed 100,000 people in Tokyo in a single night.  Every word out of his mouth is food for thought.

It's all done in a relaxed atmosphere and Mr. McNamara comes across like a wise grandfather who wants to impart wisdom to future generations.  There's a lot of wisdom here.

The hope was that we would finally get an explanation about the Vietnam fiasco from one of its architects.  But life doesn't work so cleanly.  Things are more complicated than that.  And so he still hides behind that good ol' executive privilege.
So instead we are treated to a philosphical discourse on how evil can masquerade as good intentions and misbegotten strategy.  Although the news media has trivialized the comparison, the hidden value of this film, then, is that it points out the lessons we are currently experiencing in Iraq.

But the overall experience ended up rating very high on the unintentional comedy register as an audience that entered expecting to get to express their hatred for McNamara ended up walking out with stunned expressions, amazed to find nothing all that unlikeable about the man.  Did the man participate in WWII and Viet Nam bombing campaigns?  Yes.  But he fully acknowledges the moral complexities of those efforts.
Asking for a simple maxim to sum up this film is silly.  Life is more complex than that.  The bombing campaign that caused tremendous devastation in Japan was emasculating the warmaking power of a dictatorship.  Even the folks in Newton, Mass. seemed to concede that that was also a legitimate interest.
My only gripes were that the single biggest mistake underlying U.S. policy, the assumption that the vietnamese were aligned with the chinese, was fairly much glossed over.  McNamara mentions that a VC leader told him he was crazy for thinking this, decades after the fact but nothing more is made of it.
But there wasn't a single word asking McNamara about the accusation in Sorley's book ""A Better War"" that made the argument that the way that McNamara and Westmoreland fought the war was stupid.  Sorley argues that the tactic of search and destroy sweeps through the jungle was foolish and that a policy of territorial control, adopted after Abrams took over for Westmoreland worked better.",1087084800,6,1584,5.011450381679389

These stereotypical Alpha Male characteristics are on brilliant display throughout this brisk and engrossing documentary...as well as the flip/shadow side of the Alpha Male: an immovable arrogance, narcissism, self-righteousness, and termihnal bossiness.
Nevertheless, McNamara is surprisingly candid and self-critical for much of this film, though at the end he falls back on the ""only hindsight is perfect"" argument and ducks responsibility for all the catastrophic human tragedy which he and his bosses inflicted upon the Vietnamese people (3.4M dead, 80% of which were innocent civilians) at the price of 58K American lives.

2011375,4,B0001L3LUE,"THE FOG OF WAR is former Defense Secretary Robert MacNamara's belated effort at a public explanation for his, President Kennedy's and (especially) President Johnson's actions in embroiling America in the Vietnam War.
Secretary Bob does a nice job establishing credibility and a milieu for mea culpas as he describes his role as an Army Air Force officer helping to plan the firebombing of Japanese cities at the end of WWII. Basically, he says that the air campaign ultimately saved a lot of GI lives even though, had the U.S. not been victorious, America could have been charged with war crimes for its killing of untold thousands of civilians. But, hey, the winner always writes the history of the conflict. Then, after digressing for a few minutes about his time as the top executive at Ford Motor Company, he explains how he reluctantly became Kennedy's Secretary of Defense, first advising during the Cuban Missile Crisis, then during the fateful seduction by South Vietnam. MacNamara subsequently stayed on as SecDef during Johnson's administration. Now, he places the Vietnam debacle pretty much at LBJ's feet - Jack of Camelot would never have let our military involvement escalate to the degree it did.
THE FOG OF WAR, sprinkled with a lot of period war footage, especially of falling bombs, is a smartly done and insightful documentary on how our government waged a couple of its twentieth century conflicts. MacNamara gives it an almost folksy touch - only the pipe, tweed smoking jacket, and cheerily crackling fireplace are missing - as he shares with the audience the eleven lessons he learned beginning with WWII, the last being that ""human nature will never change"". Honesty has its limits, however. At the end, Bob refuses to take any personal responsibility for the Vietnam entanglement, and declines to say why he didn't speak out against the war after resigning from Johnson's cabinet when he felt the President was going too far in deepening the grave being dug. As MacNamara says, ""It was complicated.""
For me, the most striking aspect of THE FOG OF WAR was the evidence that the former Secretary, even in his mid-80s, still has his wits about him. Why, he could take over for Rumsfeld tomorrow.",1086739200,,2217,4.97843665768194
2011376,2,B0001L3LUE,"From the trailer, The Fog of War comes across as a mea culpa of sorts by Robert S. McNamara, secretary of defense to Kennedy and Johnson, to admit and accept responsibility for the disaster that was Vietnam. However, the film amounts to nothing more than McNamara outright refusing to discuss responsibility for Vietnam and instead shifting blame to Lyndon Johnson. While the film is a brilliant piece of cinematography, coupled with the phenomenal music by Phillip Glass, Errol Morris tries very hard to be a serious, historical film maker but comes across contrived and overly dramatic.
The lessons from the life of Robert McNamara in ""The Fog of War"" can be summed up, as one reviewer put it, in one short phrase: War is hell. However, the primary focus that the film seems to hedge around forever is the Vietnam war. The conclusions by McNamara that the United States failed to see Vietnam not, as the last stand against communism, but as a civil war are correct. Unfortunately, this is not the mea culpa one might expect. At the end I was left with just as many questions as I was before, namely how involved was McNamara, and how far did he go to push Kennedy and Johnson. Inevitably the blame for Vietnam rests solely at the feet of Robert McNamara; the same as some might say Donald Rumsfeld pushed and thus is responsible for the war in Iraq.
If you're looking for an interesting view on war, game theory, foreign policy, and waging war then this is it. A serious work of historical facts? No. Errol Morris does an excellent job of combining images, sound, and music to push across the thought that in an instant the world can be destroyed. If you are looking for an explanation of Vietnam, or someone to take blame, or even someone to admit responsibility, then this is not it. McNamara avoids the topic of responsibility completely and refuses to discuss it like the stubborn old man that he is. Furthermore, the lessons we've learned from the life of Robert S. McNamara is that war does happen, and the blame for its failure cannot be erased with time, nor can the success of it be easily forgotten. I was left with many questions than answers.",1086652800,7,2156,4.646596858638744
2011377,4,B0001L3LUE,"On the plus side, this film offers great insight into McNamara's experiences from WWII through the Kennedy years and the Cuban Missile Crisis...riveting stuff.  Great presentation by filmmaker Errol Morris.  McNamara was a very controversial figure in his time and had enemies on many fronts.  This film does a nice job giving this seemingly mythical figure and his time ethos.
The only disappointing thing for me was McNamara's refusal to discuss the Vietnam War in depth.  On one hand I admire McNamara's dedication to his president.  But this is the same president who asked him to resign because McNamara was urging Johnson to stick with Kennedy's plan to get US troops out of Vietnam by the end of 1965.  Of course, Johnson ignored his and other expert advice.  McNamara rationalizes his ""speak no evil"" position by suggesting the Vietnam situation was far more complicated then anyone really knows.  Great, drop a bomb like that and then refuse to elaborate.  I was very disappointed in his stance.  This is it Mr. McNamara, you're in your twilight years, why not lay it out.  Truth is far more important then protecting the legacy or office of the president.  Maybe he just simply comes from a different generation and bashing his Commander-In-Chief would seem inappropriate.  Too bad, I think we can handle it.  Suggesting that Johnson was a slow-witted buffoon quick to act with no plan is no secret.  After all he even lied to Congress to elevate the war.
Still, I was riveted to this DVD and found much of it very interesting.  In the end, McNamara has most admirably resolved himself to trying to rid the world of disease using his influence from his days with the World Bank.
Good film of a most interesting man.",1086480000,,1725,4.816326530612245
2011378,5,B0001L3LUE,"The Fog of War is an interesting DVD from the perspective about how people make decisions about important matters of life and death.  The entire movie is an interview with Robert S. McNamara the Secretary of Defense under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.  He tells a lot of the detail about his personal life including his academic career and rise to head Ford Motor Company.  The main lessons begin when he leaves the position at Ford to head the Defense Department.
Secretary McNamara was a central figure in both the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War.  He uses vignettes from both to illustrate the central eleven lessons.  The eleven lessons explore the cognitive and moral reasoning that occurs during war.  These are important lessons with relevance to the decisions that any country makes when they make a similar decision.  The analysis here includes such topics as the unilateral use of power, what is morally appropriate in war and the limits of rational thought during war.  He discusses the interactions he had with President Johnson and some disagreements they had.  Most importantly he presents a synthesis and conclusions in some of these areas.
The central theme about how there is a lack of clarity in many war time decisions and the fact that this leads to significant moral mistakes where large numbers of innocent people die is well discussed.  He is able to illustrate these points with clear examples of encounters he had during the actual events and in retrospective reconstruction with his counterparts from the former Soviet Union and Vietnam.
I heard at least one critique about this film that criticized it for not really being a documentary, but presenting a viewpoint.  I think that is clear both from the format and the occasional off camera questions by the film maker.  I think there also might be a question about how robust the data is that are represented, in terms of the factual basis of some statistics.  Balancing these questions was a compelling fact that the US and the Soviet Union had three very close calls in terms of nuclear war.  Before hearing statement, I was aware of only two of these incidents and would have appreciated an elaboration of these incidents and how they were processed by the US military and executive branch at the time.
In spite of a few style points, I found the format of this film and the content compelling.  McNamara's viewpoint is both from a man who was there in history at the time and a man who has thought about what happened and revisited it many times.  Although there is the limited detail of a film, the general observations here are both historically relevant and can be applied to current government decisions about war and terrorism.  After I watched the film, I went down to my local bookstore and tried to purchase a hard copy of the book.  I was surprised to learn that the book will not be available until this fall.  I hope that both the book and the film will be studied, discussed, and researched at all levels - as a way that mankind can get serious about trying to prevent these problems in the future.

2011379,5,B0001L3LUE,"As Secretary of Defense under both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, Robert McNamara incurred the hatred of many Americans who opposed the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War. In ""The Fog of War"", McNamara tells us what he  learned about the conflicts of nations from his experience in the Pacific during World War II, his narrow avoidance of nuclear annihilation during the Cuban Missile Crisis while serving the Kennedy Administration, and his reluctant complicity in the escalation of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam under the Johnson Administration. This man who has long been viewed as an unyielding, heartless, number-cruncher by anti-war activists gives candid first-hand accounts of the successes and failures of America at war, what happened, why it did, and who was responsible. McNamara is articulate, intelligent, and forthright in discussing his involvement in pivotal events in U.S. history, from World War II to 1967, when his inability to reconcile his view of the Vietnam conflict with President Johnson's -or Johnson's inability to reconcile with his- ended his service to the administration.

Through director Errol Morris' interviews with McNamara and lots of archival film footage and audio tape, ""The Fog of War"" follows Robert McNamara's life from childhood, through his youth, service in WWII, his success at Ford Motor Company, his seven-year incumbency as Secretary of Defense, his thirteen-year career at the World Bank, to his return to Vietnam in 1995. Morris asks McNamara some questions, but for the most part McNamara leads the conversation where he will and is able to communicate his feelings at the time events were taking place and the conclusions he has drawn in hindsight, which he hopes will help younger generations avoid the sometimes disastrous consequences of war to which he was a party. The ""Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara"" referred to in the film's title are not specifically the lessons which McNamara wished to impart. The Eleven Lessons are in part based on statements McNamara made and in part inferred by director Errol Morris. ""The Fog of War"" is a marvelous and important documentary. Robert McNamara's accounts and insights into so many of the Unite States' pivotal conflicts of the twentieth century are fascinating and invaluable.

The DVD: As I mentioned, the Eleven Lessons in the film are not actually McNamara's lessons. ""Robert McNamara's Ten Lessons"" are available as a bonus feature introduced by McNamara. ""Additional Scenes"" includes 25 short scenes which didn't make the film's final cut, lasting 40 minutes total. These scenes include some interesting anecdotes and provide more insight into McNamara's personality, but they're not essential.",1086134400,5,2751,5.363425925925926
2011380,1,B0001L3LUE,"Robert McNamara's lessons are largely inapplicable to average people, unless the lesson is to be complacent, even in the face of genocidal war. After all, ""you can't change human nature (one of the 'lessons')."" Many of them, beyond being inapplicable, are incoherent. This film gives no significant insight into the Viet Nam era that you couldn't find elsewhere. Furthermore, McNamara's assumptions that America still, in 2004, accepts the official lies of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, insults our collective intelligence. For example, we know now that Kennedy was fully aware of the coup that ousted Ngo Dinh Diem before it happened, and supported it. We also know that the U.S. was in North Vietnamese territorial waters (not international waters) when the Gulf of Tonkin incident took place.
Only when we accept the moral bankruptcy of the Viet Nam War and hold those responsible accountable (in a historical context at least) will we be rid of the ""Viet Nam Sydrome"" that polarizes Americans decades later. Apologists for genocide may impress the academy, but I personally don't have much use for it.
If you want the good Viet Nam documentary of the year, buy the Weather Underground. It should have easily beat this film at the Oscars. I knew when the competition was between an establishment perspective and a radical perspective, the establishment would win, but a bomb in an empty building is much less criminal than millions of tons of bombs on peasant agrarian nations.",1086048000,19,1491,5.114754098360656
2011381,5,B0001L3LUE,"This is an absolutely riviting documentary about one of the most important, and controversial, American personalities of the 20th century.  It is impossible to be objective about this film; my reaction to it was totally colored by coming of age and being immersed in that era.
McNamara was, for those of us alive in the 1960s, either a stone-cold intellectual genius, the perfect egghead CEO, a heartless  calculating machine, or a war criminal. The beauty of Morris' film is he lets the prisoner tell his tale from the dock (kind of like ""Swimming to Cambodia"") and seemingly does not take sides.  If the rules of karma hold sway, Mcnamara should be reborn as a bannana slug as he cheerfully excuses his responsibility for Vietnam - ""only 20,000 were killed when I was in office - the rest happened later.""
Part of the problem with McNamara is he is the intellectual's intellectual, a hyper achiever who cut his teeth perfecting incindiary bombing of Japanese cities. His flair with numbers management drew him to revive Ford in the 1950s, and then his rise to true stardom as the brightest of Kennedy's intellectual lights.  His adroit handling of the 1962 Cuban Crisis remains required reading in political science circles, and for that, he is justly proud in standing up to the Joint Chiefs as they sought to blow the lids off of missile silos. However, one gets the feeling his problem with nuclear war is simply one of degree and proportionality, not morality.
The film prods him into his Vietnam disaster.  ""Mistakes were made"" admits McNamara, but anyone expecting tears or even an apology are bound to be disappointed.  Even in his advanced years, his overweaning ego is in full display, and even his self-criticism sounds like a daily Dow Jones summary.  Herein lies  the root of the problem, and the intense sadness when Johnson (the  polar opposite of McNamara's East Coast brahmin) parts company with him.
McNamara would claim that he scripts this film (the ""eleven lessons"") but the twelth, and unspoken lesson, is that of hubris.
This is a must-see, essential Vietnam film, which will age far, far better than more contemporary documentaries like ""Hearts and Minds.""  It is, alas, full of lessons the current administration has not heeded.",1086048000,4,2254,4.939153439153439
2011382,5,B0001L3LUE,"One of the key points I thought was McNamara's post mortem on Vietnam.
That just because the US is the most powerful country on the earth - economically and militarily she does not have the right, nor is it in her own people's interest to use this power UNILATERALLY.
And yet that is what the US has done in Iraq.
By all means invade Iraq but convince the UN of the merits. Not only does this ensure decisions are properly thought through they lend legitimacy to military intervention.",1086048000,,485,4.5227272727272725
2011383,5,B0001L3LUE,"This film is an invaluable look back at not only the Vietnam War era, but at the overall mindset relating to war in general that has been held by this country - and the world - in the 20th century, continuing, unfortunately, to this day.  McNamara is an enigmatic figure - as much as he appeared before the cameras and in the public eye during his tenure as Secretary of Defense under presidents Kennedy and Johnson, he's a very private man.  Even in the interviews that make up the bulk of this film, while he is refreshingly - and at times, shockingly - open about the events that transpired on his watch, and his thoughts, and the conversations he shared with those in high places, he remains pretty tight-lipped when Morris attempts to delve into subjects he is not willing to talk about.  Still and yet, this is a pretty amazing document - it very much deserved the Oscar it received as `best documentary' of 2003 - and, more importantly, it gives those who are too young to remember the times it depicts as sense of what it was like to live through them, to witness them.  It also gives McNamara the opportunity to set the record straight about some very important moments in history - and affords him, through the gift of hindsight and the wisdom that he has acquired with age and experience, to recognize the mistakes that were made, and grants us the chance to learn from them.
Included in the film are tape recorded conversations made in the Oval Office of the White House - conversations that most Americans have not had the opportunity to hear.  It shows how the decision-making process at the highest levels should work - the president, ultimately responsible, asks for and receives the counsel of a variety of experts on matters of national security.  Arguments occur - opinions are exchanged, oft-times heatedly and emotionally, between reasonable men.  But as McNamara observes, sometimes reason and good intentions are not enough - sometimes things work out for the best through pure chance and good luck.  He relates how, many years after the Cuban missile crisis, on a visit to Cuba, he learned during a conversation with Fidel Castro that, contrary to US intelligence at the time, there were already nuclear warheads in Cuba - the belief at the time was that the warheads were en route to the island aboard Russian ships, which instigated the blockade by the US.  Castro assured McNamara in this conversation that the warheads were there, and that he was prepared to advise the Soviets to use them, knowing full well the consequences - a world-wide nuclear conflagration that would have very likely destroyed the two superpower nations, and would have most assuredly left Cuba a smouldering piece of charcoal.  McNamara was horrified - as he is looking back, in the film, at several periods of his life, when he was involved in decisions that held the lives of thousands of people (military and civilians) in the balance.
His remembrances of the Vietnam War are both revealing and painful.  Similar to his meeting with Castro, he describes a meeting with (formerly North) Vietnamese officials, long after the war was over - it caused him to admit the errors in judgement and outlook that plagued and crippled US understanding of the situation in Southeast Asia at the time.  The US government viewed the conflict as a part of the Cold War - he sees now that the Vietnamese viewed it then, honestly, as a war against colonialism, that they saw the US as nothing more than replacements for the French, who had oppressed them for so long.
The former Secretary admits that he's not so nave to think that war can be completely eliminated - he doesn't think humanity can manage to do that - but he expresses the hope that through honestly and humbly reviewing our history and admitting our mistakes and shortcomings, we can avoid blowing ourselves to bits.  While he asserts that the mistakes were not all made by him, he also states that by no means is he attempting to shirk responsibility for his actions and errors in judgement.  It's an honesty that is refreshing, even considering his past and how he was reviled and hated by the peace movement in the 60s and 70s - it's an honesty and openness that the current administration could (and should) take to heart...but somehow I don't see that happening.  If the White House has seen this film, they most likely determined from it that they should be even more secretive about their agenda and actions.  A pity.
This film is interesting, entertaining, and brilliantly presented - Philip Glass has written another perfect score with which to frame it.  It's something that should be required viewing in history classes - and indeed by all Americans.  `Those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it' is a pretty tired old saw, but a valid one.",1085702400,3,4823,4.728247914183552
2011384,4,B0001L3LUE,"At the current moment the United States is drawing closer to the June 30th date in which we will transfer governmental power of Iraq over to the Iraqi people, though it is expected that our troops will remain there for quite some time in order to maintain stability in the region until the new Iraqi government has gained enough experience to do things for themselves. It has been over one year since the war in Iraq began and the controversy and debate over whether we were right in our decision to take action against Saddam Hussein still looms over the minds of numerous Americans amidst the slowly increasing death toll and the over-blown prison abuse scandal. Though President George W. Bush is taking increasing pressure from presumptive Democratic nominee John Kerry for improperly handling the war effort, the Democratic Party has set it sights more recently on Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in his handling of the prison abuse scandal as well as execution of the Iraq War. So much animosity for the man has grown amongst the party that many have called for him to resign, which he and the president have refused to allow. Such hostility for the Secretary of Defense has not been seen since Robert McNamara took heat for the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, which has led to his discussion of the events of his life in the latest documentary from Errol Morris entitled, The Fog of War.

The documentary centers on the discussion with the former Secretary of Defense under both President John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson on the significant events, namely the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War, which occurred during his time in office prior to his resignation in 1967. Robert McNamara, who was born in the early 1900s around the time U.S. involvement in World War I (what Woodrow Wilson coined, ?The War to end all Wars?) was coming to a close, was lucky enough to attend the University of Berkley in the midst of the Great Depression and went on to Harvard. In his time at the Ivy League school, World War II broke out and the U.S. Air Force set up a recruitment station, in which McNamara was involved in coordinating. From there he went on to work for the Ford Motor Company and, in time, assumed the role of president, only to quit the position five weeks later in order to serve as Secretary of Defense under the Kennedy administration. Within the course of his time in office, Robert McNamara oversaw operations ranging from the Cuban Missile Crisis (1963) to the early stages of direct U.S. military involvement in the region of Vietnam and took intense scrutiny not only from the Republicans at the time but also from people within the Johnson administration as well. After his resignation from the position of Secretary of Defense in 1967, McNamara went on to serve as the president of the World Bank from 1968 to 1981 and continues to offer assistance to the federal government in numerous areas today. The documentary The Fog of War offers a view on the concepts of warfare from a man many may have misjudged all these years. Though several of McNamara?s life lessons are reasonable and easy to apply to one?s own life, there are some, namely lesson five on the proportionality of war, that are incongruous in the modern age of warfare or in any time of war. This is not to say a nation should be able to fire-bomb another nation in the midst of war without facing limits but the basis of what he is proposing doesn?t make sense in the purpose of warfare. Another prominent problem was Morris? editing style which was overly choppy; leading to many to wonder what he was leaving out and for what reason he was doing so.

Overall, The Fog of War offers some clever insights into both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations but fails in its efforts to clearly express a unified message in spite of wonderfully crafted conversations from former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. McNamara?s conversations will either leave you, depending on your political stance and prior knowledge of history, hollering at the screen or erupting in applause. He never sticks in one fine area of politics, which, in a way, makes him all the more interesting to listen to just for the shake of his unpredictability. Unfortunately, in light of that fact, the whole documentary feels uneven as McNamara starts in one time period (1963) jumping to his childhood in 1918 back to World War II then to Vietnam then back to WWII only to return to Vietnam once again, which may leave a few viewers unfamiliar with historical dates confused. The audience also gets the feeling that McNamara may have gone a little too easy on certain individuals, namely John F. Kennedy, with whom he seemed to have been pretty close to, no more notably then in the discussion of Kennedy?s funeral plot at Arlington Cemetery. He fails to focus on Kennedy?s failure at the Bay of Pigs which results in the Cuban Missile Crisis, which he called a victory (if only in his mind), as well as his failure to adequately end any conflict in Vietnam by ordering an invasion of the North prior to the Viet Cong?s infiltration of the South. Though certain individuals are quick to assume that in light of the Iraq War that this film should reflect significantly on the decisions made thus far by the Bush administration, this documentary is to be required viewing more for the Democrats then the Republicans if only to show that their party?s past candidates did far worse then what they accuse the Bush administration of doing in the midst of the War on Terror. It should noted that those going into this film should have some prior knowledge of the historical events that take place within the context of the documentary in order to full assess and judge statements made by Robert McNamara.",1085529600,,5772,4.736580516898608
2011385,5,B0001L3LUE,"For those viewers who believe former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara is the ""villian"" of Vietnam, get ready to reasses that perhaps unfair viewpoint. This film by Errol Morris makes both a detailed and at the same time, a ""big-picture"" view of McNamara's career that may cause even the most strident anti-McNamara demonstrator to convert. Told with a remarkable tenderness and an eye towards history, this work shows McNamara as he would undoubtedly have been portrayed had he not been involved with Vietnam, which is to say a brilliant, thoughtful and sensitive government servant who deserves history's nod as one of (if not THE) most influential Defense Secretaries, possibly even Cabinet members in our history.
The film shows historical footage of McNamara as JFK's Defense Secretary being asked his opinion on the then accepted view of him as a ""know-it-all"" who never makes mistakes and presents a rather smug attitude to all who question him. His answer is surprising and humble and this clip sets the tone for the entire movie. Basically, this is a video interview with the now 85 year old McNamara, interspersed with many films and video spots from his long history in the Kennedy and Johnson Cabinet. What's surprising (and a welcome diversion) is how much is revealed of RSM on a personal level. Topics such as his parents, his mentors from his military service (he served in the Air Force during WWII), his personal relationship with his wife and children and heretofore little known intimate dealings with Kennedy and Johnson make this work much more than just a documentary. These topics, told in the unique McNamara voice style (an educated ""frog-like"" sound) carry a powerful dialectic which naturally drags the viewer along. I'd wager (as I've previously mentioned) that even the people that hate him the most will still enjoy viewing this to see what the REAL McNamara is about.
Major historical milestones such as the perceived missile gap with the Soviet Union at the start of the Kennedy administration, the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis and of course the initiating events in Vietnam are covered by McNamara with a clarity and forthrightness that has seemingly characterized his post-government career. ""Matter-of-fact"" recounting's of decisions relating to troop enlargements and bombing plans in Vietnam are explained with contriteness and epitomizes RSM's rationale for his actions in this period...he was simply an important government official who's duty it was to advise the President on military matters. Indeed, the oblique ""domino-theory"" was his reasoning for the escalation there and he now lectures us on how not only that policy was wrong, but that the goverment should have more thoughtfully reappraised it's actions taken there. Portraying a surprising humility, McNamara now talks about how precious life is and how regretful his whole involvement was in Vietnam. At the same time, he still refuses to go into any great detail explaining some specific events, sighting the continued controversy that still surrounds his tenure in the government.
His career and some initiatives as President of the World Bank are covered and McNamara is humerous in his acceptance of the fact that he was ""fired"" by Johnson for voicing his realization of the ineptness of the situation in Vietnam. The strongest points of this DVD (in my opinion) are in the Special Features section...here we see the ""cut"" sequences where he deals with Kennedy and Johnson on a personal level and this more than anything else adds the depth to this work that really makes it stand out.
Whether you love him or hate him, you'd have to agree that McNamara was exceedingly influential in his term at the Pentagon and has continued it in his post-government career. This film sort of vindicates him (at least in my viewing) for those famous ""international misunderstandings"" (the domino theory) and provides an important history ""bridge"" between that seminal period and now...certainly still a point in history that continues to be an important lesson for today's government officials and a work worthy of the Academy Award.",1085529600,2,4145,5.160475482912333

2011398,5,B0001L3LUE,"The Fog of War is basically a well-packaged two hour interview with Robert McNamara, the subject of this feature because of his position of Secretary of Defense under Kennedy and Johnson.  It is a captivating glimpse into a man who served in America`s most important war of the 20th century (WWII) and helped build its most infamous.
While the subject of this film is clearly McNamara's role in and reflection of Vietnam, filmmaker Errol Morris begins his piece by sculpting the life of the now 85 yr old former wiz-kid.  The film traces his role as a strategic analyst for bombing raids against Japan, his short stint as President of Ford Motors and his eventual place alongside Kennedy and Johnson.  We also get to see some personal moments about him, such as his claim to be the person who selected Kennedy's gravesite at Arlington.  But Morris does not get side-tracked giving us too much irrelevant information; his piece is clear and to the point.
The film attempts to place McNamara in the position of a sage-like wiseman, who near the end of his life can educate the rest of us on the lessons that should be drawn from his successes and failures.  Make no mistake, the film clearly attacks the logic behind the Vietnam War (and war in general) and even gives McNamara the chance to pass the buck to Kennedy and Johnson.  But I find a refreshing attempt at truthfulness in this film that is usually lacking from most political texts aimed at persuasion.
While I disagree with many of the conclusions the film wants its audience to embrace, I can`t deny the skill of the filmmaker who has given the world a piece of history that should be cherished forever.  Nothing is more historically relevant than to hear tapes of McNamara`s conversations with Kennedy and Johnson, two strong-willed men whose fearless determination is noticeably absent from the leaders of their political party today.
It is impossible for me to review any political documentary in 2004 without comparing it to this era's most famous documentarian, Micheal Moore.  Errol Morris's The Fog of War is what I consider a true documentary (a claim I cannot make about Moore's works).  His film attempts to display the truth of the situation he sees, rather than the tricky way Moore tries to shape the world to fit his views.  Moore could learn a lot by viewing the powerful works of Errol Morris.  The two men get to the same conclusion about war, but Morris does have to resort to half-truths and outright lies to prove his point.  Compared to true documentaries like this, Moore's works are shown to be what they really are: entertainment.",1085184000,3,2614,4.771618625277162
2011399,5,B0001L3LUE,"A film by Errol Morris
""The Fog of War"" won the Academy Award for Best Documentary (2003).  The subject: Robert McNamara.  McNamara, if you are not aware of who he is, was the Secretary of Defense during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.  This puts him at the forefront of the Vietnam War as it was under his watch that we became involved in Vietnam.  McNamara is a highly intelligent and articulate man who has a lot to say and his story is a necessary one to be told.  At the time of this film he was 85 years old and has lost none of his passion or mental acuity (from what I could tell).
The big questions of this movie obviously revolve around Vietnam, the how and the why.  But before we can get to Vietnam, we need to know how McNamara came to be in the position that he was in (Secretary of Defense) and what sort of man he was.  McNamara speaks of his experiences in World War II, the Cuban Missile Crisis, becoming the President of the Ford Company (the first man not a descendent of Henry Ford to do so), and his time in the Kennedy administration.  McNamara gives a lot of information that we have not seen before, not in these words and with this slant.  He is a very logical man and his logic makes sense, but is also baffling at the same time.  McNamara believes strongly in proportionality (that a military response be proportional to the initial attack), but many things in both WWII and Vietnam were not proportional, and McNamara knows it and is at a loss to explain that.
What was most stunning about ""The Fog of War"" was not McNamara on Vietnam, which while it is obvious that he has major doubts and reservations about whether or not we were doing the right thing; but rather it was McNamara on the bombing of Japan and just how much damage we really did to Japan.  There were comparisons to the percentage of Japanese cities destroyed to what that would mean in terms of American cities and the numbers were staggering.
At every moment, this film was fascinating and compelling and powerful.  I did not want to look away or miss anything even while I was being stunned by some of the things I was hearing and learning.  I expected ""The Fog of War"" to vilify McNamara in some way, but we saw a more human Robert McNamara than is usually portrayed.  The man was not always right, but it was obvious that he was working to the best of his abilities to serve two presidents.  If you only watch one documentary this year...this is the one to watch.

But with Bowling For Columbine (as salacious and inaccurate as it is, you can't deny it's not passionate), Spellbound, Winged Migration, Capturing the Friedmans, and now this year's winner for Best Documentary, The Fog of War, I believe it now more than ever. War bravely points a camera right into the face of former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, and for nearly two hours, he dissects some of the haziest issues in American history - the Cuban missile crisis, the Vietnam war, and the devastation that the latter created. McNamara, the SD during those disasters, lends insight that is pointed, at times ironic, and often bone-chilling (one shiver-worthy moment: his assertion that luck saved America from certain destruction in the Cuban missile crisis).
  What takes War to its next level of achievement, though, is the underlying theme that knits the whole film together: McNamara's deep, mournful eyes intimately communicate the notion that he knows he made mistakes, but also that there is no way he can change any of them. The fact that it rings true for everyone will haunt you for days, and indeed, certain images and facts from the film will, too (my only gripe - with McNamara's insight and Philip Glass's fluid, pulsing score, are all of the bizarre visuals Morris intersperses with the film always necessary?). This movie will grip you like a great mystery, and indeed it is. McNamara tries nobly to clear up that 'fog' that shrouds the turbulent '60's, and what he reveals of himself moves me beyond words...while what he reveals about our history scares the hell out of me.

In it he interviews the controversial political figure Robert McNamara, even though we don't hear much from Morris, who was the first president of the Ford Company that was not a Ford. His tenure as president lasted only five weeks after first receiving the position of Secretary of Treasury and then Secretary of Defense from John F. Kennedy. Claiming he was not qualified for either position, McNamara accepted after Kennedy said, ""Look, Bob. I don't think there's any school for presidents either."" After leaving Washington with a controversial legacy, McNamara became the president of the World Bank.
As Secretary of Defense during Kennedy and Johnson's administration, McNamara's career is assessed by the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War. The heart of this documentary is listening to the amount of wisdom brought by a man who has been misunderstood and even under appreciated. The film is sectioned with chapters that are based on McNamara's lessons. Not all are compelling but McNamara sustains your interest as he speaks his mind based on what his career has taught him about his life and about the world we are situated in; past, present, and future.
""What `the fog of war' means is: war is so complex it's beyond the ability of the human mind to comprehend all the variables."" War is not something we can judge and understand adequately and as a result humans beings kill other humans unnecessarily. ""The Fog of War"" could not have been released at a better time than now, when a war is being fought with a justification that has become obstructed. It is an important documentary that makes us realize the full scope of the consequences of war. McNamara does not necessarily judge the U.S. but instead teach. Furthermore, he is not an idealist as he says, ""I'm not so nave or simplistic to believe we can eliminate war. We're not gonna change human nature any time soon."" I agree. I don't believe we can eliminate terrorism either.

2011402,4,B0001L3LUE,"McNamara at 85 is still a compelling figure.  As the subject of ""Fog"" he dominates the viewer with his piercing intellect, but one that is puzzled, and often regretful, over his life and the events he participated in.  It's not breast beating sorrow over Evil America however - which I found refreshing, but more like a thoughtful analysis of days gone past by a man, an important man, who can't get beyond ""I didn't know"" and ""I still don't know..."" These ruminations are, as simple as they sound, important confessions from a man who was known for his obsession for facts.  Basically, McNamara is now saying that facts, allied with a rigid and faulty policy can, given all the unmeasurable variables of war, lead you nowhere - into a Vietnam (or an Iraq).
""Fog"" contains some good footage from both World War II, as well as Vietnam, but as an overall visual experience, such moments seemed secondary.  What was most fascinating for me however were the various audio tapes between McNamara and Kennedy, and later McNamara and Johnson.  In fact, there is one exchange between Johnson and McNamara that makes ""Fog"" worth seeing all by itself.  In it, Johnson scolds McNamara, repeatedly cutting him off, over the issue of Vietnam.  What it reveals is McNamara's less than enthusiastic support, and Johnson's obsession with the domino theory.  One annoying part of ""Fog"" is the occasional shouted out questions from an unseen interviewer.  The tone of the ""shouts"" makes the interviewer sound like some self righteous former member of the SDS saying ""I told you so.""  The interviewer wasn't even needed for ""Fog,""and he comes across like an angry polemical fly that occasionally interrupts the flow of McNamara's story,  which itself is less about politics and more about history - and its fog.",1084579200,,1792,4.920265780730897
2011403,4,B0001L3LUE,"4.5 stars. And the Oscar goes to...""The Fog of War,"" directed by Errol Morris.  What I remember most about the last Oscar ceremony was Errol Morris collecting his very first statue for Best Documentary Feature Film and exclaiming, ""It's about time!""  I laughed to myself and said, ""Indeed.""  Just to name a couple other fine documentaries from this exceptional director: my personal favorite, ""The Thin Blue Line,"" which is, for some inexplicable reason, still unavailable on DVD; and another notable film, ""A Brief History of Time,"" based on Stephen Hawking's best-selling novel.  Errol Morris is a great filmmaker, but there are moments in ""The Fog of War"" that have many of his now trademark techniques, such as showing small objects moving in slow-motion.  There were also a couple of scenes reminiscent of the film ""Koyaanisquatsi"" from director Godfrey Reggio where layers of film are placed on top of one another to attain multiple, ghost-like images of people and places.  In an odd coincidence, Phillip Glass composed the score for both films.  The only other negative factor in the film was the tendency to jump back-and-forth in time, which makes for some confusion when trying to piece everything together.  However, there is some insightful material to be found here stretching all the way back to the Wilson Administration during World War I.  The stock-footage that is interlaced with the interviews with Robert S. McNamara adds so much textural history to the film that I felt I was there struggling with the politics of The Cold War on an empathic level.  The interviews are sometimes insightful and other times very moving.  Robert S. McNamara, as much demonizing press and criticism he has taken, comes across as a good-hearted human being who knows he has made mistakes as well as genuinely hopeful decisions.  He is a flawed person, as we all are, which makes the universal, emotional connections to his past all the more viable.  This film is nothing less than a very interesting sojourn into out nation's troubled past through the venerable eyes of a very caring individual who once dealt with some of the most intense situations in American History.  This film is definitely worth seeing.  All in all, Errol Morris strikes again!  Thank you.",1084492800,2,2265,5.016042780748663
2011404,4,B0001L3LUE,"Stated simply, this movie is brilliant.  McNamara bears his soul to the camera, yet keeps his cards close to his chest at the same time.  I am utterly facsinated by his role in this film, as well as his explanation of the events of his life.
As one can imagine, he avoids the topic of Vietnam as much as possible.  As a result, more interesting facets of his life are explored, such as his involvement in WWII and his time with the Ford Motor Company.  Unfortunately, his time as the President of the World Bank is not really discussed.  (There are three bits about this in the deleted scenes).  Of course, his time as President of the World Bank did not directly deal with war.
What is important to note is that McNamara is very quick to pat himself on the back and push his accomplishments.  However, he is just as quick to run away from responsibility for tragic events in which he is involved.  This is especially true when it comes to Vietnam.  As I can imagine, this is a tough topic for him and I can only imagine what lies in his heart with respect to this issue.  Also, thinking specifically of his comment regarding Agent Orange, I am sure that there are some attorneys out there that would not mind suing him personally over the injury that Agent Orange caused.
Nonetheless, I think that The Fog of War is an important piece of living history.  It should be required viewing for all high school students.  More importantly, it should be required viewing for ALL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.
The deleted sceens that are on the DVD are also great.  I would have enjoyed them more if Morris had added the scenes into the film itself.  The very first deleted scene is very telling of who McNamara is.  It discusses a famous poem by Kipling about a king that wished to build a palace that would be the envy of the world and, at the end of his life, he realized that all he had was a pile of rubble.  I think that McNamara wanted to help build a ""palace.""  At the end of his term as Secretary of Defense, U.S. military policy was rubble and we were engaged in a war that we could not win or withdraw from.
I really do believe that this is great film and highly recommend it to everyone.",1084406400,,2184,4.353086419753087
2011405,5,B0001L3LUE,"I'm not a big Errol Morris fan.  I find most of his docs contain too much of himself in them to be the truly objective works of art they strive to be.  However, this is about Robert McNamara, a man who is bigger than life (love him or hate him, he is) and very little of that ""Errol Morris"" feeling seeps into this film to its benefit.
I know this has been released at an opportune time, but this isn't Michael Moore confrontational tragi-comedy.  This is a character study of one of the most interesting men of this century.  A man who may well be (through his work during WWII and later in Vietnam) one of the greatest killers of the twentieth century.  But it all depends on your perspective of his role and who he is as a man and that is what is truly great about this film.  It does not offer any answers (much like the other great doc this year, Capturing the Freidmans) it only shows you the man.  It shows you McNamara being arrogant, smug, proud, and obstinant, but it also shows you McNamara being genuinely apologetic, introspective, thoughtful and sympathetic.
We are left with the final decision.  We are given the facts.  We are given the man, but we are asked to decide what we think and that is what makes this a significant documentary and a great film.
Also, Morris' talking head style, with all of its awkwardness, really works well with this subject.  His dramatization of nothing (maps and graphs and charts) is also probably the best and most compelling of any other documentary filmmaker.  The found footage is awesome, as well as the found recordings with Johnson and Kennedy.
On the DVD, watch the deleted scenes.  It's another half an hour of McNamara and though I still can't decide whether he truly believed what he was doing was right, and should be looked upon lightly in the course of human history, or whether he should burn in hell, I could watch him talk forever.
Who knew the most compelling drama of the year would be an Errol Morris talking head doc?  But it is.",1084147200,2,1999,4.473829201101928
2011406,5,B0001L3LUE,"Some anti-Vietnam War critics who disagreed strongly with the policies of Robert McNamara as Secretary of Defense under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson have criticized Errol Morris's Oscar-winning documentary for allowing certain statements of the controversial Washington bureaucrat to stand unchallenged rather than present a rebuttal or at least other viewpoints.  A better way to view this documentary is to consider it as one of an ongoing series of oral history presentations assisting us in understanding the vital issues of war and peace.
What makes this documentary so gripping is that McNamara is confronted with important questions by producer Errol Morris in a spontaneous exchange, and must come to grips with them before an audience seeking responses.  He is still visibly shaken over his role in the Vietnam conflict and concedes that he was ultimately forced out by Johnson due to policy differences rather than resigning of his own accord.  In the manner of Washington tradition for the lavish, he was given a grand sendoff ceremony by the man who was dumping him for policy differences.
Despite the fact that McNamara does not answer the pivotal question of, as stated in his autobiography, if he ultimately knew that he was sending off troops to a war he knew could not be won why he continued to do it, his uncertainty allows us to study the all too frequent response of someone under pressure, unable to take the ultimate step to free body and soul.  As a result McNamara continues to agonize, aware that he was sending young men to die in a war he knew would never result in victory.  He can never know, for instance, the peace and resolution that someone like Richard Goodwin, who concedes that Johnson had treated him like a son, could know for resigning in spite of pressures due to his strong opposition to Vietnam.
Another fascinating point in the film is the discussion of how close America came to war in the Cuban Missile Crisis.  McNamara provides enormous credit to then Russian Ambassador Llewelyn Thompson for engineering a ploy that helped avert nuclear conflict.  Thompson publicly disagreed with President Kennedy and, due to his close involvement with and knowledge of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev,recommended that he respond to the first of two communiques sent to the Russian leader, the first much more conciliatory than its blustery successor.  While the clever ploy has been cited in other works on Kennedy and the period, the showcasing of Thompson's role in the decision provides important addendum to the record.
It is to be hoped that Errol Morris will continue in the same vein as ""Fog of War"" in approaching the historical record by confronting individuals who helped shape it with important questions designed to illuminate the public.  A chlling element of this film is when on the scene Cold War active policy participant McNamara states bluntly that the only reason we avoided nuclear war was by being just plain lucky.",1080086400,5,2982,5.008080808080808
2011407,5,B0001L3LUE,"I get a bit of chuckle seeing the way 'Fog of War' gets listed on amazon.com...""Starring: Fidel Castro, John F. Kennedy, et al."".  Ignore that.  This movie is all about Robert S. McNamara, and - to an even greater extent - the vision of brilliant documentary specialist Errol Morris and his capable crew.
To get an appreciation of Morris' skill, I suggest you check out ""Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary.""  Great story, but - for the most part - the impact of it is diluted by a botched production.  In 'Fog,' you get the complete package: a compelling subject (love him or loathe him, McNamara (...) compelling viewing); seamless editing; pitch-perfect historical images to match the stories; Morris' wonderful 'falling domino' imagery; and (especially) Phillip Glass' extraordinary soundtrack.  Morris and his team have thrown the equivalent of a perfect game here.
One image that sticks with me (others have noted it here as well): a heavy-lidded JFK is about to give the nation a briefing on the Cuban Missile Crisis.  He stares blankly into the camera.  For a second I thought Morris had frozen the image.  Suddenly, the frozen Kennedy blinks.  Morris stays with the image longer.  Glass' eerie music builds in the background.  Kennedy slowly blinks again.
A great cinematic moment by a great filmmaker.  'Fog of War' is filled with moments like these.",1079827200,2,1355,5.0
2011428,5,B0001L3LUE,"This brilliant work by director Morris is the stuff of life. And death.  It arouses the most basic moral and immoral questions of being human through an enormously complex and yet simple man, Robert Strange McNamara. It seems no coincidence, his middle name, as we get to know him in all his cleverness and contradictions.  Morris subtly illuminates, literally through McNamara's eyes, what it means to have power over life and death.  Like God.  There is something almost spiritual in McNamara's eyes, edited against searing images of, well, graphs, statistics, memoranda, bursting firebombs and nuclear mushrooms, almost all rarely seen-before footage.  The eyes are the soul of this film - McNamara's are a combination of supreme confidence and extreme doubt.  But not only his eyes - for example, we see President Kennedy's eyes frozen in the lens as he tells the nation of imminent nuclear war in 1962, a look that would make a Marine shiver.  This new interview technique (""interrotron"" ) draws us into what?  War? Peace? Honor? Life? Power? Evil?
Born 85 years ago, McNamara is the quintessential man of his time, what Brokaw called the greatest generation, a sobriquet this documentary underscores.  In McNamara's words he deplored the sorrow and pity of the four great wars of his lifetime; the trenches in France; the nuclear and indiscriminate firebombing of innocent Japanese; the debacle in Korea; the flaming jungles of Vietnam.  His command of statistics is breathtaking.  But it is the eyes that reveal an inner truth, the precise opposite of his concise, rational words - his 11 ""lessons"".  We see a man who never found himself in harm's way.  We see eyes so ironically blinded by a circa 1918 vision of duty and honor that, though he loathed the horrifics of Vietnam, he was compelled to allow his true judgment to go unexpressed until nearly 60,000 Americans were dead.  He was at once perhaps the most powerful man in the world and its most despicable.  It is easy to see why a brilliant young President Kennedy would choose someone as Defense Secretary who seemed so like himself, but tragically without the courage.  And why, with Kennedy's death, McNamara by sheer ambition and brilliance would ascend to the very pinnacle of power.
Yet, I couldn't hate this guy.  Perhaps the most telling moment is McNamara's clear devastation at Kennedy's assassination 41 years ago, again told in his eyes and a rare, emotional choking voice.  So it's difficult to blame him for all those deaths he might have prevented -- McNamara genuinely believed he was doing the right thing for his Presidents: through an obsessive sense of duty and loyalty.  Now that his day of legacy approaches, he expresses criticism over the actions of others -- General LeMay and President Johnson are the favored targets.  But McNamara cannot quite bring himself to admit his own mistakes of enormous proportions.  Yet it's quite clear that he was one of only two men who could have ended the 7-year slaughter (of his term in office). Many may find that failure a reason to despise the man. I found it just human.
This film offers up no easy answers (certainly not his 11 ""lessons'), but more importantly raises many fundamental questions.  Philip Glass' elegiac, edgy scoring perfectly meshes with this thriller. An impressive and important contribution to understanding our nation's ambivalent past.",1079308800,318,3391,5.017857142857143
2011429,4,B0001L3LUE,"Errol Morris' Interrotron recording device faces down its most controversial subject yet in ""The Fog of War"". This wonderful footage is culled from nearly 20 hours of interviews with Robert S. McNamara, US secretary of defence under JFK and Johnson and the reputed ""architect"" of the nam war.
As the often cantankerous but well-spoken McNamara explains not so much his decisions as the contexts that produced those decisions -- as well as repeatedly saying that he's not going to talk about a particular subject, then talking about it anyway -- he dispels countless myths surrounding the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam and both of his commanders in chief.
More than a portrait of a savvy (if ethically challenged) bureaucrat, Morris'  documentary is a gripping survey of the last half-century of American politics and one that has much to say about the current administration's attitudes. Trust me, you're going to be glued to the screen.
One minor gyp though. It's not really clear what inferences I should have drawn from the reflections other than that war is hell, or that we should all love each other ever after etc etc. While we are on the gripes section, perhaps I should also mention that given its candid cam type feel, the footage is occasionally a bit tough to watch.

2011430,5,B0001L3LUE,"As a filmmaker who has been involved on the production side of filming drama, documentaries and biographies for many years, I commend Mr. Morris, both for his command of the art and craft of storytelling and his savvy at choosing the perfect subject.
He has taken, what seems like a fairly simple way of filming and interviewing someone, namely Robert McNamara, former US Secretary of State, a most compelling, charismatic, complex and fascinating human being who has lived a life unlike most others, and Morris has created a centerpiece of pure cinema. Cinema meaning: emotion, drama, heartache, story, plot, character and many more elements that go into the telling of a good tale.
Credit also goes to Robert McNamara himself who has an epic story to tell, with the twist of a character dilemma caught in the trap of service to country, principles, conscience and right and wrong.
One is left with the dichotomy of not knowing what to think. We shake our heads in wonder at what seems to be the niceness of a fellow human being (McNamara) yet he astounds us at the horrendous atrocities he has been a party to. Three little words still churn repeatedly over and over in my head ""We were wrong"".  And without giving away any plot or suspense, this is what I think this film is all about.
Most people in government will never admit to being wrong. It takes a very special human being to be open and come clean. How many Generals and how many Secretaries of War will ever admit to being wrong, or Presidents for that matter?
Here we have a living human being (McNamara) who seems to march to the same drummer as all of us, yet, was subject to a high office grandeur that separated him from humanity itself and the delusion of incorruptibility, by simply thinking he was being right.
Seems to me that humanity will continue to make the same mistake again and again because that is who we are, egos hell bent on being right. Just look at the divisiveness of our political landscape that has everyone thinking they are right without really understanding the other side.
The Fog of War is an epic story very well told. Very timely.  Oscar well deserved. Philip Glass should have an Oscar for his great music soundtrack.",1078185600,5,2214,4.659846547314578
2011431,5,B0001L3LUE,"While network & cable news television reveal(s) inside political information to its' viewers, they only tell a fraction of the story, and only reveal what the viewer wants to hear at that. Docudramas/biopics, on the other hand, tell the complete & entire story as is, all without leading the onlooker astray in the process. Former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara's account is no exception, of which, during the course of ""The Fog of War""'s one hour, forty-five minute run, enlightens its' viewers with a biographical and pictorial collage of Mr. McNamara's hectic and universal life in government. Also contained within the fascinating, as well as extremely personal pages of Mr. McNamara's diary, this ""Soldier of Fortune"" really gets down to business, and isn't gun-shy in the slightest when discussing issues relating to the Cuban Missile Crisis (including Fidel Castro's reign of power [as well as his reign of terror against the United States Government and its' proud citizens]) and the Vietnam War. McNamara also manages to sneak in a poignant and mesmerizing real-life story pertaining to his frienship with the Kennedy family, as well as standing toe-to-toe with President Johnson and his administration. Robert discusses said wars from a business standpoint as well, including a ""lesson"" in the economic laws of supply and demand. Even with an I.Q. ranging in the 99th percentile (I.Q. of 140 or higher), McNamara concedes that even he has his faults, and acknowledges that no one's perfect by any means imaginable.

2011432,5,B0001L3LUE,"Robert McNamara, one of the most influential leaders of our time, submits in this brilliantly composed documentary to one of the most excruciatingly intimate looks at ones own life I've ever been privileged to.
""Fog of War"" chronicles R.M.'s rise to power from a modest (1920's) middle class childhood, through his years as a ""super-student"", his brief but extremely successful stint in the private sector, the ""from left-field"" recruitment by J.F.K. himself from Ford Motor Company (where he was serving as the first non-Ford family President for something like 2 weeks) to become Secretary of Defense during one of the most ""white knuckled"" periods in human history (Cuban Missile Crisis), then a horrible romp through Vietnam under Johnson.
Roughly two hours of interview with RM are punctuated by still/full motion clips, and audio related to the events he was pushed into, behind, embroiled in, or all the above.
Knowing what little I do about the Director (and whatever bias' he may have), and McNamara (I was born at the tail end of Vietnam), this was a compelling, pertinent (in so many ways to our present national dilemnas), and entirely interesting movie.  Even those relatively uninterested in politics or history would have a hard time suppressing fascination with the paramount decisions the man staring back at them from the screen had to make.  His accounts of the discussion that went on behind closed doors during the Cuban Missile Crisis literally sent chills down my spine as I looked up and realized that the man being interviewed may very well be as much the reason for my being alive as my parents!
It's unfortunate for McNamara that he remained in office after JFK died, for it was during the tumultuous and confusing years of the Johnson administration that policies such as ""pre-emption"" and ""containment"" would lead to such admittedly awful mistakes as our engagement in Vietnam was.  But the lessons he learned, the mistakes he admits making as a relatively conscientious decision maker, are so incredibly valuable.  In particular, I found his revelation about empathizing with ""the enemy"" to be among the most valuable of his lessons.  McNamara organized a meeting (some 25 years after Vietnam) with the leaders that opposed him during the war and learned that the way the Communist North viewed the war was fundamentally different than McNamara thought.  He learned that the North believed that the US (instead of ""containing the spread of Communism) was just another Imperialist nation trying to enslave it (as France had done for so many years before), and that they basically viewed the War as a struggle for freedom and independence that would have likely justified fighting to ""the last man"".
I don't think this movie is necessarily anti-war, or anti-McNamara, I myself found allot about him admirable, including the bravery it took to do a film like this.  However, I believe that many will villify him as a ""murderer of a million"".  By way of example, I was standing at a urinal after the movie when some guy who had just seen it took to trying to start up a conversation about the movie by saying ""Looks like we got another one in Rumsfeld, eh..."".  I replied ""I hope so"" (which petrified and insulted him).
I don't necessarily ""hope so"", but my dramatic retort was more meant to challenge the ungrateful villification of McNamara.  I think if every leader with the kind of extraordinary weight in responsibility that McNamara had stepped up and offered honest insight like this, the world would undoubtedly be a safer place to live.
Hope this was helpful.",1077667200,11,3594,4.975
2011433,4,B0001L3LUE,"Without a strong interest in history, everyone may not enjoy The Fog of War. While it's one of the most powerful documentaries I've seen, that is at least partially because it puts into context my place in world history in a novel way: I am a child of the first generation-- my parents' generation--- which almost annihilated itself completely, and our generation and those behind us now take it somewhat for granted that the capability of complete human extermination exists. Errol Morris, the director, and Robert S. McNamara share at least this goal: they do not want that power taken for granted.
I even liked the wonderfully understated Philip Glass score, although I am not typically a Philip Glass fan. Whether the film would succeed simply as a black-and-white movie or would be as affecting, without the power of history behind it, is difficult to judge: it is rivetingly thought-provoking rather than entertaining. However, the accumulation of historical footage of events and public and private conversations of the powerful, both video and audio, is itself an astonishing achievement. Definitely I want to own this movie on DVD, as I will want to watch it several times to learn everything from it that it could convey--- certainly more than McNamara's succinctly titled ""Eleven Lessons""--- , and something different could be learned from it if I watched it at three or four year intervals for the rest of my life.

As film, it might be compared to ""The Kid Stays in the Picture"": a searingly honest, introspective account of a person's life. However, while Evans was an important filmmaker, McNamara made history, both before and after his stints in the Cabinets of Kennedy and Johnson, and world power was his milieu. McNamara's retrospection of his mistakes and the lessons learned from his life are profound, rather than merely fascinating. While Evans is an extraordinarily talented man, McNamara may be one of the most brilliant men of his era. That he makes this record at the age of eighty-five, and makes it not merely to be his self-exculpatory legacy, is staggering proof of his still-active mental prowess, and his willingness to process intelligence into wisdom. He doesn't make these shockingly honest revelations to convince us of his brilliance or his talent, but to let us also be boggled, as he is, by the concept that we human beings have the power to annihilate ourselves, our society, our species, and that some of us are stupidly willing to do so.

He hopes that the lessons he learned will help us avoid the same mistakes in the future. He is not after credit, or assignment of blame, but after some honesty in the way we interpret what we think we know--- about him to a much lesser extent than about history. He does not ask for sympathy; in fact, he refuses to discuss some of the most personally painful aspects of his life. His mention of his and his wife's affliction with polio is almost off-hand. His grief over the death of JFK is all the more poignant because he is trying to hide it. He does not talk about putting himself in harm's way in VietNam, and explicitly avoids detailing  the personal threats menacing him and his family because of his position and the militant opposition to the war in VietNam.
McNamara does talk about service to his country, and the fact that he was poised to be an extremely wealthy man at the helm of Ford Motor Company when he accepted a government job--- a Cabinet position as Secretary of Defense under Kennedy-- that he was not entirely sure he was ready to accept. He is frank about those mistakes and misconceptions that he held earlier in his life which he now recognizes as mistakes, but clear-eyed when he talks about the fact that some of his actions would have resulted in his trial as a war criminal if he hadn't been on the winning side. He is not only brilliant, but much wiser, and very human. McNamara is a man who has learned the power of humanity's flaws, and this movie is his and Errol Morris's reverberant exposition of the flawed humanity of power.

Why Eleven Lessons? Eleven is such an unsatisfying number. Eleven is prime. Eleven lacks the symmetry of twelve. Eleven lacks the menacing abundance of thirteen. Eleven has a nice technical feel and it hints at a background philosophy.
This movie is a piece of art. This movie is an invitation for you to remember all the history you can and to re-work your personal learning. The lessons shown on the screen as text speak to one side of your brain. The other side of your brain is activated by the soundtrack and images of this film which echo the 20+ year old movie Koyaniskatsi.
I call this movie art because it interacts your personal experience. Some of the lessons may be Socratic reflections that we do not know as much about who our enemies are or why as we think. In matters of warfare, the fog interacts with the action at hand.
For my 14 year old daughter (who asked to see this movie) This film is interacting with her reflections on the American-Iraq war.
For my wife, a veteran of too much of the hard part of management, she found Mr. McNamara a likable person, contrary to her expectations because he is attractively honest. Not naked frankness however, as he says: ""I usually answer the question I wish the reporter had asked.""
For myself, this movie presents important ideas from a worthy spokesman. It is gripping as Mr. McNamara acknowledges what he did, describes his 1995 meeting with North Vietnam officials, and reveals the awful meaning of ""The Fog of War"".",1076716800,4,2211,4.790575916230367

I have been stationed in the Pentagon several times, and hearing from his own words the origins of the competitive environment that he created for the Pentagon, that remains to this day, is fascinating.  Details on his analysis that led to the firebombing of hundreds of Japanese cities is also sobering...many more killed from this firebombing campaign than were killed in the two nuclear bombs.",1525996800,,526,5.0344827586206895

8013893,5,B0001L3LUE,"This is an outstanding analysis of the uses and misuses of power. McNamara made his share of mistakes in his time as SecDef and has spent much of his life since coming to terms with these issues, most notably Vietnam and what he regards as a dangerously close call in the Cuban Missile Crisis.

The video is broken into separate topics. It is a powerful video as McNamara bares his soul.",1522454400,,387,4.450704225352113

What is mind boggling are the ""after the fact"" revelations made by Castro and others. Every American should see this film. I have more respect for Kennedy and McNamara than ever before. He was a true American hero who was never fully appreciated or understood. I believe the media of the time, combined with the anti-war sentiments during the Vietnam era besmirched this mans reputation while camouflaging his many contributions and sacrifices made for this country.",1520467200,,593,5.252631578947368

He, wonder boy Mac, made it possible for 58,000 American young men to die in a useless, senseless war. God knows how many injured and disabled. And, don't forget that war killed one million Asians, possible two. There is a very hot place in the afterlife for such megalomaniacs as Robert McNamara.",1518912000,,397,4.852941176470588

It is from England and designed for a geographic area called Region 2. The US is Region 1. When I put it in my player I get the message: This disc can not be played in your region. According to the web, you can change your players region number up to four or five times, but my players manual does not tell me how to do this. Fortunately, the DVD did play on my PC (Windows 7).",1515888000,,542,3.981651376146789
