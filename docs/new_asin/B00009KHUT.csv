7990924,5,B00009KHUT,"FUNNY and corny too! I love Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan. (Region 2, so you need a proper player in the US)",1505606400,,106,3.8636363636363638
7990925,4,B00009KHUT,Very good movie. Though unavailable in the US where I'm at. I do have an all region player and purchased this movie(region 2 PAL). Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan always make a comedic duo as they would go on to make the wonderful Trip movies a few years later. This movie is pretty funny and I would recommend for fans of both or either actor.,1476316800,,340,4.246153846153846
7990926,4,B00009KHUT,"Recommended by a friend, this British TV movie was very enjoyable and I'm happy to recommend it.",1421625600,,96,4.705882352941177
7990927,5,B00009KHUT,"Rob Brydon plays a down-and-out actor, twenty years on from his role in a science fiction television series, who signs up for a cruise with fans. Some really hilarious moments from the supporting cast of Steve Coogan, David Walliams, and James Corden, with deeper meaning on the nature of fame, and a disillusioned actor dealing with his failed life. Highly recommended if you're a fan of any British comedies.

Note: This DVD is Region 2 and doesn't work on American players. However, you can rip it on a PC using a variety of software, and play it that way.

Content is fairly tame, with a few swear words here and there. One very obvious sex scene in silhouette, if that's something you're sensitive to.",1385078400,2,706,4.685483870967742
7990928,4,B00009KHUT,"I purchased this movie as it stars 2 actors I am very fond of watching: Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan. Michael Williams is also very good in this.

The movie is Region 2 only, which means that it will not play on American DVD players. I have a small 5-code player, so I'm okay.

The movie was quite funny in places, but in other areas it was just odd and quirky. I would recommend it, if you enjoy rather off-beat British humor and acitng.

Glad I saw it.",1349654400,,453,4.125
