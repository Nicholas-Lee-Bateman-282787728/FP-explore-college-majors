Unfortunately, Amazon only offers it in the PAL DVD format which will not play on U.S. DVD players. Too bad! It's unfortunate that the other buyer gave it a 1 star rating based only on the fact that it wouldn't play on his DVD player, which he should have known as it was clearly stated to be a PAL DVD.",1486857600,8,416,4.148148148148148
