1256305,5,B00002VW9U,What can I say?  Nadesico is a terrific series.  I'm not even going to bother telling you why!  Just go and get it!!,1013126400,,116,3.9565217391304346
1256306,5,B00002VW9U,"Nadesico has to be one of the funniest animes I've ever viewed, and I've seen my fair share. Terrific dubbing (for once) and eccentric characters really sell the show. There's lots of love triangles, quadrangles, octoganals or whatever! Fast-paced, despite the hilarity of the show, it still manages to tug my heart strings at times and it even made me cry once. As wild as it is, there is a real story behind all the comedy, one that reaches through the screen to the reader. Highly recommended.",1004054400,,496,4.712643678160919
1256307,5,B00002VW9U,"This is a two episode tape.
In the first episode, the crew of the Nadesico go on a covert mission to rescue the lone survivor of a ill-fated expedition crew in a frozen tundra.  Yurika slips and fires the main cannon resulting in the Nadesico being attacked!  No time for that lovey-dovey stuff now, Megumi- your hero has the save the day!
In the second episode, the crew is ordered to investigate a strange, new Chulip - but all they want to do is have fun in the sun!  The crew enjoy well deserved shore leave while Akito finds himself drugged and held captive.  Who's gonna rescue Akito this time?  Watch out, lady!  Here comes Ryoko, and she's on the case!
If you're a fan of Nadesico, this video is a must for your collection!  Don't miss out!",991785600,,748,4.3768115942028984
1256308,5,B00002VW9U,"I picked up the first volume of Nadiseco on a whim.  After watching the first episode I was hooked.  This series is what you would get if you crossed Gundam with Tenchi Muyo.  I is nonstop laughs from start to finish.  Nothing is show, and nothing is outright said, but the innuedoes will make you laugh until you cry.  You will feel genuine sympathy for the poor unfortunate hero who is hounded by about a half-dozen girls, when he just wants to be left alone and to watch his anime.  Buy this now trust me it is worth the money.",985132800,,530,4.25
1256309,5,B00002VW9U,"This volume is by far a volume for fan service. First, Megumi drags Akito on a date in the virtual reality room. The setting is a school wear Megumi wears an incredibly short skirt. Before Megumi can start to move on Akito, they're attacked. It was Yurika's fault for this attack happening. The same scenario in the virtual reality room takes place with Yurika in a short skirt. In the end of the episode, Akito ends up comforting Yurika. The next episode is too much. A swimsuit episode, featuring yet another woman after Akito. Except this one wants to die with Akito. Akito ends up being saved by Ryoko and the nut girl is left on the island. One of the greatest gags in the volume was seeing Megumi, Yurika and Ryoko try to cook for Akito to win his affection. This is the most emotional and entising volume yet. A must have.",979344000,,829,4.42483660130719
1256310,5,B00002VW9U,"Nadesco is the funniest anime i've seen since dragon pink. the story revoles around the crew of the Nadescio. Nadesco seems to bring together  all the best parts of anime w/ Mechas, great stoeyline, and voice acting.  The Nadesco's crew it mixed w/ a obsessive enginer, a mecha-pilot/ cook, a  emotionless helmswoman (idiots), and a captain that is always in the middle  of a situation with akito that seems to annoy him. in the first volume you  witness GekiGengar3, a anime that seems to always be  in the same situation  as nadesco's crew. anyways to make this short, buy nadesco now! you won't  regret it!",966556800,,609,4.733333333333333
1256311,4,B00002VW9U,"Okay, at first, this series totally disgusted me.  I bought the first tape, curiously, with no knowledge of what it contained.  My first impression, a bunch of whinny loud mouth idiots (to quote Ruri :).  It  seemed to be a bad EVA clone.  For some odd reason, however, I went out and  bought the next two tapes.  Thank God I did!  After I finished watching the  second tape I was dying to watch the 3rd, and now I'm desperate to go and  purchase the next 2 as well!  This series got so much deeper.  I no longer  consider it a bad EVA clone.  It's is not like EVA.  It is different.  I  love EVA.  I also now love Nadesico.  Of course, the loud whinning hasn't  stopped, but it became bearable, especially after they nearly explained why  everyone yells.  That's one of my favorite things.  They explain a lot  about themselves and this series when the take about an anime within the  show called Gekigengar.  Everything.  Trust me.  This series is well worth  the time/money/and effort.",962496000,,988,4.485714285714286
1256312,4,B00002VW9U,"For those of you who didn't know, Volume 4 of the Nadesico series is titled Deadly Encounters. Hold on, Hold on, I'll get into why in a minute. Akito finds himself the object of a romantic rivalry between Yurika and  Megumi as the crew of the Nadesico must fight battle after battle defending  Earth. An encounter with a mysterious girl almost leads to tragedy as  Akito and the Aestivalis team must take on a new and even more deadly form  of Jovian fighter!  This volume, like the others is great, except for the  dubbing, which is also bad in the others.  If you hear the Japanese voices  you will most likely agree that they fit the characters better than the  English ones.  First of all Akito, he sounds like a cowardly geek in the  dubbed, while in Japanese, he has a deeper, more manly voice which I think  better suits his character. Second of all Yurika's voice sounds very down  to earth when in the Japanese version she sounds like a real space cadet,  and I see her as a ditzy character and the voice that they chose to dubb in  just doesn't seem to fit right.  Besides my hatred against the horrid  dubbing this is a really good choice, with very good plot development.",961804800,,1183,4.427906976744186
1256315,5,B00002VW9U,"This DVD movie is kinda like an end of the whole series. So if you want to fully understand the movie, you have to watch the whole series first. Even though I don't really like the end, but I think there is a specially meanning of it. I highly recommend it to all the Nadesico fans!",1082592000,,282,4.053571428571429
1256316,4,B00002VW9U,"Let me start off by saying, yes, I have seen all of Martian Successor Nadesico the series.  I knew the characters as they were in the series before seeing them in this film, and yes, I was rather thrown as well as to what the heck was going on.  The movie takes place two years or so after the series ended and a LOT has happpened and the audience is, for the most, left on its own to piece together what it's missed.  It's much darker than the series and many of the characters have changed - namely Akito.  Oh, dear Akito.  His change astounded me.  ;.;
However, I loved the movie.  It just took a second viewing.  The initial viewing was basically a ""WTF?"" run-through, but I was brought back to view it again by the lovely visuals.  (Personally, I loved the music too)  Once you've seen it more than once, it has this mysterious, fantastic quality that keeps it interesting.  A lot of questions are, again, left unanswered while only a couple of those left over from the series were resolved.  There are some writing faults to it - there are too many holes.  However, I still found it enjoyable and imaginative - it leaves you to ponder what happens next.  Maybe the creators were going for the sort of thing where you just don't see the end, like Akito avoided the end of Gekiganger III/V for years.  :P  That's just a lame, fan's opinion.
So, I really enjoyed it personally, despite its flaws, and I think that if a fan is willing to let go of most of the original wacky humor to see the characters go through some psychological changes (which make sense, considering the situation), it's more than worthy to own. :3",1080950400,4,1622,4.410774410774411
1256317,4,B00002VW9U,"I would have to say that while i am not dissapointed i have found that i am not particularly enthusiastic about it. I love the anime series and my friends have started calling me Akito after the main charachters name and now i am almost ashamed of it. The movie I believe made no sense whatsoever, and could have used alot more work especially for the amount of time spent working on it i believe it should have been better. Plus ADV Films spent way too much time with the dubbing which only added to the wait time. I recommend this movie ONLY to hardcore MSN Fans.",1079568000,2,565,4.289719626168225
1256318,3,B00002VW9U,"Martian Successor Nadesico: The Prince of Darkness is not a bad anime movie per say, but I was expecting much, much more.  This could have made a good series, but as a movie it feels rushed and unfinished.  While some of the humour has been retained, overall the movie is much darker, lacking the lightheartedness, the romance, and the magic of the original series.  Some fans might rejoice at the sight of many of the familiar faces returning, but most will be disappointed by the fact that most of the characters have little to do with the plot, and the fact that some of the characters have been changed beyond recognition.
There is no character development, no background info given on the characters (new or old), nor were we told what had happened since the series.  Newcomers will not be given a chance to fall in love with the characters, while returning fans (and newcomers too I guess) will be left disappointed and confused by the story.
Like I said it's not a bad movie per say, but it certainly isn't the Nadesico that I had grown to love.",1078272000,7,1052,4.550264550264551

1256320,3,B00002VW9U,"this is a gorgeous movie to watch. it's just about the right length, has excellent audio and graphical productions, solid voice acting, a nice mix of CGI and traditional animation and excellent mecha designs, the best I've ever seen.
The downside is the storyline. even if you've watched the first series, the motivations of the characters seem rushed and confused. The random addition of characters from the first series gives the movie that disjointed feel, so you never get the sense of watching a cohorent story. It's like the producers did the plot last.
I would recommend this if and only if you want to SEE a high end anime movie and don't care much for anything like plot, or storyline or character development",1068854400,5,718,4.798387096774194
1256321,1,B00002VW9U,"In a word, this movie was horrible. Not so much in the fact that it was a bad idea, as I actually did like the characters, parts of the plot, and the individual aspects such as animation and (dare I say?) voice acting? So what was wrong? Everything.
To begin with, the movie seems to love flashing up unrelated scenes. Cameos of unknown characters, random battles, old clips from the show, and other such nonsense which seems to be the result of the producers suddenly remembering they were making a movie, not another episode, and had to lengthen it as easily as possible. If you haven't seen the original series, which is one of the greatest things I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing, then you aren't likely to pick up the movie in the first place. If you do, the reintroduction to characters is so poor that first timers won't remember their names or even get a good grasp of their personalities, and 'veterans' will gnash their teeth over the fact that they seemed to be more intent on spot shots of the individual characters to stir up some feeling of nostalgia, rather than any plot-oriented importance.
I hate this movie. The plot is confusing, with hefty chunks of it missing and certain events merely explained as they happen. The pacing is crappy, with too much time wasted on pointless endeavours rather than keeping their focus on the telling of a story. The awesome ideas that they had(which won't be mentioned in case you don't head my warning and buy this movie) lose nearly all their impact because of the construction of the film.
I am a tremendous fan of the series, to my surprise loving all the characters, especially ill-fated ones like Guy, but this movie apparently heard about that and wanted to grind those fond memories beneath an iron-hard hour and a half of pure agony. If you liked Nadeisco, don't buy this movie. If you haven't seen it get the series and don't buy this movie. Send a message to the creators of these shows that a movie is supposed to be good, original, and as engaging as the series it shares the name with, not a hack job.
I need to go supress the memory of this film now.",1068768000,7,2126,4.5390625
1256322,3,B00002VW9U,"To be quite plain, whether judged as an independent movie or as the capstone of the Nadesico TV series, the Nadesico movie fails.  It fails because it is a mismash, hoping to cram in every character from the TV series without giving many of them anything to do--and worse, it feels like 30 minutes of the actual story were cut to cram more cameos in.
The story takes place several years after the TV series ends, with Ruri now captain of the Nadesico B.  Akito and Yurika, the leads from the series, were lost in a shuttle accident two years before.  A new enemy has appeared, trying to wipe out the united Earth and Jovian forces.  While it's far from the world's most original story, that's not the problem.  The story is disjointed, moving in leaps and bounds.  It's as if the story were written via boson jumping (the teleport technology featured in the series and this movie), with people popping up almost randomly here and there to give speeches.  Perhaps fittingly, the ending is a nice and tidy deus ex machina, totally unexplained.
So why three stars?  Despite its many faults, Ruri and Ryoko, the returning characters who get the most screen time, manage to be enjoyable (if you liked them in the series).  Since I liked those characters, several of the disjointed snippets were enjoyable, even if they didn't add up to a real movie.  Don't get this if you aren't a big Nadesico fan, and even if you are, don't get this expecting anything approaching the enjoyment you got from the series.",1068336000,5,1500,4.626415094339623
1256323,5,B00002VW9U,"When it comes to high end anime, this is one of the best. Originally released in Japan in 1998 after the phenomenal success of the 1996 Martian Successor Nadesico TV show. Based on the continuing events of Kia Asamiya's manga of the same name, ""The Prince of Darkness"" picks up the story several years after the events in the TV show. The movie is heavily centered around Ruri Hoshino, now the captain of the Nadesico B (and the Nadesico C later on). With revamped and enhanced character designs by Keiji Gotoh, the movie bursts onto the screen with amazing color and sound. Amazingly, even with a far much more serious tale to tell, its still told in the same jovial manner that made TV show so much fun to watch. A must have for any Nadesico fan, and a basic requirement for any anime collection.",1066262400,4,798,4.510344827586207

bye",1389830400,,99,4.0
7916298,4,B00002VW9U,"I'll start this off by saying that I absolutely loved the series. I'd marathon the entire thing back to back constantly when I was younger because I just couldn't get enough of it. And while this movie definitely loses the light tone and humor, the intensity is a very cool transition. But that's also a personal opinion, and from the reviews already on here, most people don't seem to agree. I personally like when a normally silly character kicks it up a notch and puts on their man pants.(Slight spoilers. I guess? It's nothing too revealing. Whatever) Such as what happens in the beginning with all the computers. The feeling it gave off is something I'd compare to when THAT song starts up in Evangelion. The one that when you hear you immediately know something is either going to go terribly wrong, or horribly right. But moving on.

Lot's of people complain about how it doesn't make sense, or that it was inconclusive and I completely agree. But the reason for this is because this was originally intended to lead into a second season of the show. Which is why all these new twists and characters are introduced without really being explained too much. But the plug was pulled on it before they got started. I don't remember off the top of my head if it was because they went bankrupt or just lost their budget. Or it just screened poorly. Neither here nor there now, I guess, but it should be on wikipedia I think.

If you want a slightly (VERY slightly) more conclusive/depressing ending than the series I'd recommend watching this. If you're happy with how the series ended, then don't touch it. Because the developments aren't happy for the characters. It's really hard to review this without spoilers.

And thus ends a really rambling, probably not very organized/informative review..",1388707200,,1798,4.756410256410256
7916299,3,B00002VW9U,"Most of the time, when a movie is a continuation of an anime TV series, its either a remake like Escaflowne, or it takes place during the show like Naruto. However, alot of times the movie will act as a conclusion for a series that has already run its course, such was the case in Evangelion and Fullmetal Alchemist. The Nadesico anime(also known as Martian Successor Nadesico)was a 26-episode TV series that was billed as being a ""space opera"", but at the same time was one of the first shows that actually riffed on anime fandom, specifically the outer space and giant robot genres. There were numerous references and jokes used throughout it which spoofed/honored the whole mecha theme in anime, even to the point where the opposing alien army had based their entire culture on a 70s super robot show. It was also a harem anime with the main antagonist had at least 2-3 girls vying for his attention, even during the middle of a space battle. So, mix Star Trek with Gundam and mix in a Love Hina sense of humor, this is what you'll get.

The movie itself takes place about three years after the series ended, where fan-favorite Ruri who was an ensign when we last left her is now a full-fledged captain with her own ship, the Nadesico-B. The war between Earth and the Jovians(who're really outcasted humans from Jupiter)has ceased, and the original Nadesico-A crew has split up, most of which left the military altogether. Three of their numbers were killed though during an accident: the main character Akito, Captain Yurika, and the over-explaining Inez. It might seem a little disheartening to have some of the major characters murdered offscreen, but this comes into play later on. Ruri and her crew go to inspect the main station involved in the Hidalgo Plan which combines several warpgates using Boson Jumping linking parts of space into one big junction. The station suddenly gets taken over by a rogue new faction calling themselves the Martian Successors made up of people from the Jovian and Earth governments. They are utilizing the alien artifact found on Mars at the end of the TV series to capture the entire Boson Jump network, which is being controlled by an unconcious Yurika who is not as dead as rumored. Akito is not so dead either, and acting on his own in a dark Aestvalis mecha trying to stop the rebels. Ruri is given command of the new Nadesico-C to head to Mars and confront the Martian Successors, so she has to get the old Nadesico-A crew back to man it. Her officer Hari teleports to Mars with another A-class Boson Jumper, the also not-dead Inez, and prepare the new Nadesico for the final battle. Akito has a last duel with the commander of the Successors who caused him and Yurika to have their deaths faked in the first place, and then takes off into space leaving Yurika finally awakened by Ruri and the others. This leaves room for a sequal where Akito and Yurika are reunited, which unfortunately never happened.

As a followup to the TV show, this was fairly good. Given the extensive original cast, they managed to give most of them some decent screentime, although the two main ones are either now tragically emo or unconcious for the whole movie. This was really a chance for the supporting characters to shine, especially Ruri who had been thrust into the captain's chair to make the fanboys happy. The animation took a serious upgrade from the series to the movie, mainly in the space battles and mecha fights which were downplayed quite a bit on the TV show. I'd mainly only advise this be watched by fans of the original anime, even though the ending leaves you wanting for there to be more.",1292284800,,3639,4.675507020280811
7916300,2,B00002VW9U,"There's just so much wrong with this movie that I don't know where to begin, except to say that if you watched and enjoyed the original series, you should seriously consider avoiding this movie completely, because I can more or less guarantee that you're going to be disappointed.

For one thing, ""Prince of Darkness"" was written as a direct sequel to a video game that never saw release outside of Japan, ""Nadesico: The Blank of Three Years.""  As a result, anybody who never played the game--meaning bloody near everyone in the US, I'd wager--will end up watching ""Prince of Darkness"" having missed the entire middle of the story.  Why on Earth did the studio release the movie in the US, knowing full well that the vast majority of US viewers wouldn't have a prayer of following it?  I haven't the slightest idea, and since the original series stands up just fine on its own, I wish they hadn't.

I could forgive that, though, if it weren't for the fact that virtually everything that made the series great has been either truncated or removed completely in the movie.  Gekigangar III, for instance, the ""meta-anime"" series, is almost completely ignored, aside from a brief shot of a Gekiganger III keychain and a line or two of dialogue.  Almost all of the series' humor has been removed, except for one or two scenes (particularly the ones involving Mizumi and Hikaru--I have to admit, I did laugh pretty hard at those).  Worst of all, though, is the characters themselves, all of whom seemed to have undergone a personality transplant.  Tenkawa Akito, the original series' protagonist and comic relief, is granted a cameo appearance in the movie, appearing as a brooding, unlikeable emo kid with a weird penchant for Green Hornet eyewear; and Hoshino Ruri, child prodigy and fan favorite from the series, is instead hideously misused in her new role as captain of the Nadesico-B and subject of a particularly insulting--both to the character and to the viewer--fanservice shot.  Misamaru Yurika's role is almost nonexistent; she spends most of the movie in a fossilized state, and if it weren't for the fact that she was such a vital part of the series, her role in the movie wouldn't be worth mentioning.

To be fair, the movie's not a complete loss; there are a few honest laughs to be had, and some genuine drama, and occasionally the movie seems just on the verge of recapturing the spirit that made ""Martian Successor Nadesico"" so great in the first place.  These moments are so few and far between, though, that the movie can't help but leave a bad taste in your mouth, like a cup of your favorite coffee with a healthy dash of vinegar mixed in.  I can't in all honestly recommend this movie unless you're the kind of completist who has to have EVERYTHING, and even then, I'd highly recommend you buy a used copy.  Or just stick with the series.",1186185600,2,2856,4.731854838709677
7916301,3,B00002VW9U,"This is hardly the film to start an acquaintance with the Nadesico series.  Unfortunately, with my knack for getting everything backwards, it's where I began.  It took me a while to sort out my confusion about what was happening, and when I finally did I still didn't find the story all that interesting.

This film comes after the original series Akito and Yurika, the original main characters, are gone and presumed dead.  In their stead, Hosino Ruri is now the captain, but for the most part the old cast is gone.  A series of Hisago Plan space colonies have come under attack and the Class A boson jumpers keep vanishing.  The solution - call in the Nadesico B.  As you might expect, nothing quite works out as planned.

On top of the competition between space based and earth based forces there are third and fourth interests at work.  Once the Nadesico returns to earth after witnessing an attack the decision is made to unleash the experiment Nadesico C.  At this point the film falters while Ruri suddenly goes on a hunt for a crew that can be trusted.  And finally on to the climactic battle.

While the film is nicely done, it never seems to catch fire, despite its large number of battles.  The characters don't seem to gel or develop anything beyond rudimentary relationships.  With its large number of new characters, the film even puts off those viewers who are familiar with the original story.

I've survived looking at endings before beginnings before, so my over all dissatisfaction is the this film offers very little story in it's strange combination of violence and cuteness.  I never felt the sense of drama that should underlie a story that has Martian rebels destroying who colonies.  This is a flat effort.  Oh yes, avoid the dubbing at all costs.",1137801600,,1772,4.716612377850163
7916302,3,B00002VW9U,"Well I brought this movie having watched the whole series at least twice, and really from the movie i expected a crazy reunion of characters for one final mission, but Ohh no. The writers had to try and be clever and deep. The fact that to two main characters aren't in the movie is the first thing the struck me as odd. And secondly the fact that the movie is very dark and sad, which is the exact opposite of the series.

Although the if you are a huge nadesico fan, the first time you watch it it is a great feeling to see all the characters again etc etc. But once you've watched it more than once you start to realise how good they could have made it if they had kept it simple.

Oh well. This movie it good if you like some rough and tumble mecha fights but if your expecting a hour and a half version of the series then be prepared to be disapointed. :)",1127260800,,860,4.052941176470588
7916303,4,B00002VW9U,"I remember watching this whole series and loving nearly every minute of it. I was sad to see it end that way, like with any other series end. I (my brother actually) recently bought the Essential Collection volumes 1 to 3 (whole series, plus cheaper but as my friend says it's like the Greatest Hits of PS2 for ADV).

This movie was like they pulled out of the manga (I'm guessing) chronologically in the manga two years ahead. I was told the Japanese had the manga/novel prior to this movie, having them understand but the majority of us US mainstream fans left in the dark. I rented it, got progessively pissed off not knowing what the hell was going on. Prince of Darkness was and is like a complete stranger to me...kinda like the relationship between Yurika and Akito in begining of the series...as if we only have good memories of the series. I just felt more nostalgic and empty at the end. WHICH PROMPTED ME TO (eventually) BUY THE WHOLE SERIES instead TO GET A FIX like an otaku junkie.

Friends commented it was basically for those Ruri Hoshino fans out there. The only connection I saw between the series and this motion picture is the fact that since Ruri has grown physically (she can't get more mature intellectually than she was in the series) SHE'S ALSO NOW CHASING AKITO.

Unfortunately, while the movie has some intrigue and has visual appeal, it lacks the warm humor that made Nadesico the hit that it was. While there are some light-hearted moments, they seem to have been added almost as afterthoughts. This movie is decidedly darker than the original series, and some of the characters from the original show suffer quite a bit in this incarnation.

In some ways, it almost appears that we were being prepared for a second series that never materialized.",1095379200,3,600,4.9405940594059405
