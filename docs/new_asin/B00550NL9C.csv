8457178,5,B00550NL9C,"Scott Houston explains all the fancy nuances of playing piano in a manner that's very easy to grasp.  I know I should learn all the foo-foo stuff, BUT I REALLY just want to learn how to play tunes from a practical perspective, for my own satisfaction and gratification.
I was skeptical to try and learn from a DVD but the way the material is organized, and the way Scott explains EVERY detail in very understandable terms, has been a great learning experience for me and has truly helped me learn how to play piano!!
This is my third of his DVD's and plan to buy more.  I look at it this way, for less than the cost of a local lesson, I get to learn a lot and replay my ""lesson"" over and over again!",1353542400,,699,4.17037037037037
8457179,5,B00550NL9C,"Scott Houston is a phenomenal teacher and is very engaging.  His 1-on-1 Series in general, and this DVD in particular, show this.  Instructions are clear, easy-to-follow and comprehensive.  The whole process of learning a song this way - one set of very detailed lessons per song - is perfect for a self-taught person like me.  The tips he gives are very transferable to other songs.  Every time I work through one of these (this is my 4th 1-on-1 DVD), my overall playing gets better.  As far as the DVD itself, quality is good, camera angles are good, the menus are logical.  More specifically, the menus make it productive and easy to later go back to the product after study is complete for a ""brush-up"" on certain selected sections.",1329350400,2,736,4.703125
