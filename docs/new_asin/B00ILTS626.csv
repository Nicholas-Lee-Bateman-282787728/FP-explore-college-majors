6281568,5,B00ILTS626,Call Me Crazy was a well thought out film. It helped me understand on a smaller scale what people go through on a daily bases.,1410912000,,126,4.08
6281569,5,B00ILTS626,VERY EDUCATIONAL MOVIE. LOVE IT,1408665600,,31,5.4
6281570,5,B00ILTS626,This is very difficult to watch but knowing that 1 in 4 Americans has a mental illness it was very educational.  I would not recommend it to just anyone.,1408147200,,153,4.275862068965517
6281571,5,B00ILTS626,"Amazing!  Great views from all sides, people going through the illness, and the families trying to understand them.  Recommend showing to Health classes in school.",1405728000,2,163,5.48
6281572,5,B00ILTS626,"As a physician, the stigma of mental illness continue to encourage patients to avoid medical care.  Mental illness should be viewed no differently than any OTHER medical illness.  The story of the people who were stricken down, yet recovered is extremely important.  With proper treatment, successful outcomes are not only attainable, but should reflect the norm. Sadly we have not made much progress. Even my relatives think mental angst is a license to mistreat and steal money.",1401753600,8,480,5.207792207792208
6281573,5,B00ILTS626,"I work at a Mental Health House and when I watched this movie, it shows how the disease effects the client as well as family members and others.  Worth the watch.",1401494400,2,162,4.225806451612903
6281574,5,B00ILTS626,"This is a well performed look at mental illness in 5 tales. The first tale involves Lucy (Brittany Snow) a law student who battles schizophrenia. The second tale is about a woman with bipolar disorder who is an embarrassment to her child (Sarah Hyland) growing up. The third story intersects with the first one as Allison (Sofia Vassilieva) must face her mentally ill sister. The fourth tale concerns Eddie (Mitch Rouse), a comedian who is clinically depressed. The fifth story takes us the full circle of tear jerking hope as a PTSD victim (Jennifer Hudson) needs an attorney to help her gain custody of her child and get the help she needs.

The theme is that mental illness is a disease that can be controlled with therapy and medication. Hollywood pulls out all the stops by having a-listers both in front of and behind the camera. If you love a good Lifetime type film, this one goes above and beyond.

No F-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1400284800,17,935,4.66060606060606
6281575,5,B00ILTS626,"Wonderful Stigma Buster tool
Insight from individuals living with a mental illness changes prospective for those who are not ill.
It also shows that with treatment and medication there is recovery and possibility of ability to live, laugh and love for all who live with these illnesses.
A must see then share.....",1399939200,6,313,5.038461538461538

6281577,3,B00ILTS626,"I really loved the first five film, call me crazy still has great elements to it however I felt the stories were a little rushed towards the end. My favourite story that really made me think and reflect on was the story with Sarah hyland's character. It made me think that it's not just the one person going through the illness but also their loved ones have repercussions as well. It's a great movie to learn more about mental illness and the different types there are.",1470614400,2,470,4.476744186046512
6281578,4,B00ILTS626,"Very good overview of mental illness and how the illness affects all the lives it touches. Some of the acting was marginal, but the overall message was really good - worth watching.",1464652800,,181,4.6875

6281580,5,B00ILTS626,"This film is as good as you can find for the purpose of educating anyone about the effects of mental illness on those who live with it and those who live or work around them- families and friends, and the public at large.  With enough videos of this type and high quality, the burden of stigma that prevents most people from asking for help and getting diagnosed and treated would be greatly lifted.",1464220800,,399,4.465753424657534

6281602,5,B00ILTS626,"My students are shown this film in relationship to their study of psychological disorders.  This film stimulates discussion and provides opportunity for
non-judgmental comments.  The students are able to see how such problems affect many people in one's circle of influence.",1418601600,3,274,5.658536585365853
6281603,5,B00ILTS626,"Some stories are from the point of view of the person with the disorder and some are from the point of view of their family members. The stories are too brief to give a sense of all the facets and implications of each disease, but it's an admirable effort to show some of the characteristics of each disorder and humanize the ""crackpots."" I suffer from depression and particularly appreciated the story of how depression impacts a marriage. Fortunately the spouse without depression doesn't end the marriage because of the other one's mental illness, as happened to me.",1416700800,2,569,4.876288659793815
6281604,4,B00ILTS626,"The movie was in segments similar to a documentary but presented as short films.  The acting and directing were great.  For anyone studying mental diseases, this CD is a valuable one to add to your collection.  It includes bipolar, chronic depression, PTSD and schizophrenia.  I especially enjoyed the segment on bipolar which clearly shows the two different aspects of the disease.  It shows the dangers to self and others and the stigma of the affliction if untreated.",1415750400,8,470,5.0519480519480515
6281605,5,B00ILTS626,This was an excellent  portrayal of mental health issues.  I don't know why Brittany Snow is not among the top of the Hollywood elite.  She did an awesome job of portraying a woman with a mental health problem.,1415145600,,210,4.473684210526316

8643303,5,B00ILTS626,"Reviewed as excellent by many folks with mental illness. I wanted to use this DVD as a training tool for staff that work with mentally ill clients but may have limited experience with this population. Before doing that however I wanted to see whether it represented, from a client standpoint, an realistic portrayal of their experiences.  I had a group of approximately 15 clients with various types of mental illness view the DVD.  A couple of clients found it too difficult to watch and walked out.  One client stated he hoped that all families that had a mentally ill family member could watch this video. Another stated it hit close to home.  I hope this DVD will serve as a useful tool to increase understanding and empathy of a serious illness that is often feared and not well understood.",1487980800,4,795,4.697841726618705

I used to introduce students to mental illness. It was very helpful in showing both the symptoms of the disorders as well as the humanity of those dealing with it.
