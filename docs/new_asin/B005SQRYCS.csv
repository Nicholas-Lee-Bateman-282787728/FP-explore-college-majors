8485382,4,B005SQRYCS,"Anthony Wong (""Infernal Affairs"") is Wong Ho-chiu, a real estate tycoon whose drug-addicted daughter Daisy (Janice Man) is found dead after being kidnapped. To seek out those who are responsible for his daughter's violent death, Wong Ho-chiu and Chor (Richie Ren), his faithful bodyguard with a past, embark on a revenge mission.

But perhaps a 2011 Hong Kong film ""Punished"" (""Bou ying"") is not what you expect. The thriller is produced by Johnny To, but it is not something you would call ""action-oriented,"" let alone ""action-packed.""  Directed by Wing-cheong Law, Johnny To's trusted assistant director, ""Punished"" focuses our hero's descent into the darkness. The film's tone is a little similar to that of Johnny To-directed ""Vengeance"" starring Johnny Hallyday and Anthony Wong, though action scenes of ""Punished"" (there are not many) are less stylized.

""Punished"" puts its emphasis on characters, not on action. Anthony Wong's strict father (who is also a ruthless businessman) feels he could be partly responsible for what happened to his family - hence the film's title - even though he finds it hard to admit it to himself. Richie Ren's character follows his employer's orders faithfully while trying to maintain the relationship with his estranged son who doesn't care.

So remember, the film is neither an action nor a horror. With powerful performances from the leads, ""Punished"" is more like a vigilante drama, and as such it delivers.",1352332800,5,1450,5.237068965517241

Revenge is a common theme in Chinese action films, and even just in the filmography of producer Johnnie To, who is best known for another film called Vengeance. This one is called Punished, though it is somewhat of an untraditional revenge film. There are more layers of plot and morality than the average revenge film, though it packs just as much excitement.

  Punished begins as a rather unpleasant family melodrama. It feels like a Chinese episode of ""The Sopranos"" when the drug habit of a powerful man (Anthony Wong) becomes more than just an embarrassment. Her behavior threatens business, which somehow feels slightly less than legitimate, but none of this is an issue when the daughter is suddenly kidnapped. The reasons for this kidnapping are unknown, and even after the ransom is paid she is killed just the same.

  This is when it becomes a revenge film, though there is a certain level of distance in this vengeance. Instead of dirtying his hands with the act of murdering the people responsible for his daughter's death, the tycoon hires his ex-bodyguard (Richie Jen) to do it instead. Determined to make enough money to ensure his son's financial stability in life, this bodyguard is willing to throw everything away in order to destroy the culprits. He videotapes the deaths and sends them back to his boss, who only becomes involved with the final death.
