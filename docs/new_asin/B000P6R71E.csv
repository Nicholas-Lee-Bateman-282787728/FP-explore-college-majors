8189411,4,B000P6R71E,"These six dance compositions are very beautifully performed and filmed. These are important dances that usually don't get attention like Ailey's
""Revelations"" or ""La Valse."" It's wonderful to see the complete ""Ring 'Round my Shoulder,"" not just excerpts. I personally don't care for the Katherine Graham piece selected for this DVD. She had many more beautiful and gripping works than this. ""Mourner's Bench"" is beautifully performed; a bit more lyrical than the original by the choreographer, Talley Beatty, which makes it a performer's showcase rather than an expression of passion. I don't get Jones's ""D-Man in the Water"" at all. What the narrator says it's about doesn't seem to be meaning of the metaphor. Curious.",1429056000,2,720,5.269565217391304

8189417,5,B000P6R71E,"Wonderful dance performances - Choreography is poignant and beautiful.  Music and poetry are divine.  Dancing is precise and control is astounding.  Overall these performances are riveting, impassioned and very moving.",1359590400,2,218,6.2
8189418,5,B000P6R71E,"The video has great selections of dance from earlier and contempoarary modern dance. Great soundtrack.  The choreographers tell the story of lynches, chain gangs, lonliness, and mourning.  The dancers are amazing.  I bought this product to use in my classroom.  This video gives students an opportunity to see dance that they could not see live.  This video clearly illustrates that dance can tell a story that resonates with issues people struggled with historically as well as present day issues such as AIDS. Many students think dance is abstract or about fantasy life with princes and princesses and dreams of nutcrackers coming to life. Now, they know better.  There is a lot of material here to make connections to social studies, literature, writing, drama and music standards for enhancing lesson plans.  Highly recommend!!!",1301875200,15,832,5.257575757575758
