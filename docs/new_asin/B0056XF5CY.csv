However, what I got was pure mediocrity, even though the film gave itself ample opportunities for redemption. While the most casual viewer may yet have fun with this, I cant recommend it to anyone other than hardcore fans of the involved parties.

The story: In a digitally-dominated future, fantasy becomes reality as the characters of a fighting game attempt to draw an expert player (Nino Muhlbach,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Boy-God/dp/B001NTPYSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Boy God</a>) into the digital realm to gain supremacy of their world.

The first thing I find fault with is the plot. The film opens with an entirely different conflict than what's described above, wherein individuals who can't operate computers are criminalized by cyber police. This is a world I would love to explore, but the storylines convolution limits my interest in its characters. Complex relationships between vaguely-defined characters fail to intrigue at all, and oddly, nobody seems particularly surprised at video game characters taking physical form and fighting people. The story provides no precedent for its weirdness, and this disengaged me from my viewing experience.

The excellent fighting cast includes Monsour Del Rosario (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist-II/dp/6305824703/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist II</a>), Tamara Guo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Women-on-the-Run/dp/B0000DJF4B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Women on the Run</a>), Winston Ellis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Mask/dp/B00005OOQ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Mask</a>), Phillip Ko (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eastern-Heroes/dp/6304239599/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eastern Heroes</a>), and Darren Shahlavi in one of his final Hong Kong roles prior to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ip-Man-2/dp/B004I1AGTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ip Man 2</a>. While all of these performers look great in their flashy costumes, their opportunities to perform dramatically are limited and their opportunities to fight are sabotaged by very disagreeable styles of choreography and editing. The latter is the bigger problem, as the brawls are presented too rapidly for the viewer to fully appreciate. Aside from a noticeable reliance on kicking over punching and a little too much wirework for my taste, its difficult to find one brawl out of the 20 that is not frequently interrupted by the characters hurling animated projectiles at each other.

Stylistically, the film is a cross between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Power-Rangers/dp/B008XRE81E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Power Rangers</a>, but its presented in a manner that fails to make the most out of its premise. What we're left with is an overload of information and visual stimuli: there's just too much that you're expected to follow. What a chore this was to watch!",1447372800,,3435,7.330097087378641
