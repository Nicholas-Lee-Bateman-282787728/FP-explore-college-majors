8206876,5,B000SUUXC2,"Like And Now For Something Completely Different, the Hollywood show takes the best python moments and puts them together for one hell of an evenings entertainment.  Eliminating the hit & miss aspect that every sketch show inevitably has this show is hilarious from beginning to end.  Both films I find are sadly neglected.  Why Live at The Hollywood Bowl (and And Now For Something Completely Different as well) are not more highly regarded is a mystery to me.  LATHB does repeat a little of whats on ANFSCD but it never feels repetitive.  And I think most of the sketches are from the original show are improved here.  The live audience adds a freshness to the whole thing, especially when things fall apart hilariously in the Dead Bishop sketch.  But for the most part it contained skits that I was mostly unfamiliar with.  I got great laughs from things I've never seen like The Comedy Lecture, The Last Supper, International Philosophy, Sit on My Face, etc.  So if you don't want to have to get every show or album Python did this is a good place to start.  Of course the show and albums contain some gems you may want to go back and discover for yourself.  This and ANFSCD are great samplers if you want to get into Monty Python beyond their three brilliant features.",1343260800,3,1272,4.608888888888889
