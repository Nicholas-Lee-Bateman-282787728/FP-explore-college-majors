8746810,4,B01A9RHEES,"Major point:  As of November 20, 2017, this was available under the title ""London's Finest"" on Amazon Prime.  So save yourself $32 if you have Prime.
That said, Tarantino-like bloody violence, the expected foul language, good guys versus bad as the plot.  The good guys are Pakistani Londoners who use and deal heroin.  They are aided and abetted by some Welsh Jamaicans.  The bad guys are a couple of vicious and corrupt cops aided and abetted by some nasty but somewhat inept Russians.  Black humor and bad behaviour throughout.
Worth $32?  I don't think so.  But for free?  Definitely",1511222400,,587,4.848484848484849
