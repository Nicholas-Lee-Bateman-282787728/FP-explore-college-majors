8145340,5,B000IFRZZ0,"Ultimate Guitar Techniques: Shredding With Arpeggios is a great tool in any guitarists toolbox for beginners or seasoned players.  I love the style Danny Gill uses to teach his methods and techniques.  Highly recommended product!

8145341,3,B000IFRZZ0,"This dvd is actually really good.  He starts out showing you all the forms you need for the licks he plays later.  Problem is remembering them.  That is remembering the specific notes in each one, fingering, and name.  Get an arpeggio book with this to use as a reference.  Also, the video starts off slow, but then he takes off on you.  It's almost as if he wants you to be Van Halen after learning a few arpeggio forms.",1299801600,,421,4.265822784810126
8145342,1,B000IFRZZ0,"Dvd was no good. did not play or work on any system i tried.  The disc was blank.  I received a prompt refund from the company.  They were very helpful and courteous. Still looking for this title.

8145343,4,B000IFRZZ0,"I almost did not buy this DVD because of the negative reviews it received. Not sure what some people are talking about. This is now my 6th Quick Licks DVD and it's pretty much in the same format as all others in this series. The material is very well laid out into 10 examples with progressive difficulty and includes the 4 Jam tracks that the material can be rehearsed on. I have not seen or heard of any DVDs in this series to include tabs nor do I care. What's especially great about this DVD is the exercise section that includes 4 examples on how to play arpeggios in different formats(diatonically, added 7th, string skipping, sweep, etc). Is this the best DVD for arpeggios? I don't know, but if you like the Quick Licks series by Danny Gill you'll find this one to be very useful as well.",1228780800,5,796,4.385135135135135
8145344,3,B000IFRZZ0,The video came after a week or so. The video itself was just like the others in this series. Very easy to follow along with the instructor and good camera angles to see both the picking and fretting hands.,1216339200,,205,4.282051282051282
8145345,1,B000IFRZZ0,"The whole lesson is hust slow and boring. Watching someone tell you note by note is insain. here's a hint TAB!!! Teacher needs to explain technique such as right and left hand techniques, and not so much time with basic theory. This DVD was a HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT that did nothing to enhance my playing skills. I suggest DON'T BUY IT!!!",1201392000,2,335,4.6
8145346,3,B000IFRZZ0,"word of warning-- this dvd is a bit misleading. it's really for intermediate to advanced players. it's strange because the first 3 or 4 chapters are aimed at beginners but then it jumps immediately into stuff that's fast even for advanced players. I definitely learned a lot from this dvd but I wouldn't advise it for someone just starting out. here are some of the things that weren't included on the dvd:

- no tablature. the teacher wastes so much air time saying what string and fret every single not is-- these are arpeggios so that's a lot of notes! it would have been much more efficient if there was tab and he played the parts at normal tempo, then slow, and with tips for playing clean and fast. instead he plays the riff at normal tempo, then he goes through this long boring process of speaking out every single note. it was much faster for me to just figure out the riff at normal tempo. but tab would have been even easier.

- he discusses really basic theory at a slow pace, as if to a beginner, and then suddenly he's playing arpeggios really fast-- there's no transition! he doesn't even share any tips for playing at that speed, it's up to you to figure out! for example, he doesn't explain sweep picking or when to up or down pick. he also doesn't explain the importance of muting strings when doing arpeggios on barred triads. he doesn't say when to hammer on or pull off, you have to figure it out for yourself. there are numerous little things that he DOESN'T talk about that make all the difference in the world.

- most importantly, he doesn't even mention the correct way to practice! the only way I could play these arpeggios to speed was with a metronome, starting very slow and concentrating on getting the up and down picking sweeps as accurate as possible. it took a long time and a lot of practice but eventually I was able to get up to speed. he never once mentions how to practice with a metronome (which is definitely a skill that will improve your playing more than anything else).

all in all, I felt a little bit cheated by this dvd. I could find some arpeggio sweeps online for free and just practice the tab-- wish I would have saved my money and done that.",1197244800,5,2196,4.4148148148148145
8145347,3,B000IFRZZ0,"this was the only DVD i could find on Arpeggios other than Malmsteen's instructional DVD [where the focus is on long, extended arpeggios patterns & solos]... i watched an example at Mel Bay's website & decided to try this DVD & i'm glad i did as the focus is more on smaller arpeggio patterns that one can practically apply immediately in one's improvising... Gill is a very good teacher in this presentation & starts at the beginning of creating basic arpeggio formulation for major, minor & diminished chords as well as more complicated forms... & his working with small 3 note arpeggio forms as he eases the student into playing with actual progressions is very well presented & explained as he breaks down arpeggiated solos over long chord progressions... & he moves into more complicated techniques as the lesson progresses- very logical & well demonstrated ! BUT the overall impact of the lesson is made much more complicated by 1] the lack of any tablature or written material to accompany the DVD's different lessons as well as 2] failing to include a CD of the rhythm section's accompanying tracks... if Gill had included a booklet with the lessons presented in tablature to follow along with while watching this video [as well as to use while the video is paused & one is working on learning the material presented] & a CD of the backing tracks- that would have made it much easier actually learning the material thru play along... that's why i can only give this DVD a 3 star rating-a very use-full guitar DVD presentation of arpeggios BUT you must waste alot of time transcribing chord progressions as well as finger patterns & having to create your own backing tracks on a Looper to practice the information in the lessons ! anyway, i find this DVD a use-full tool for what i wanted to learn BUT if Gill eventually adds a tab booklet & a CD of backing tracks- it would be a bit more expensive yet an extremely effective & popular instructional DVD... until then, if you buy this video- be prepared to spend much time transcribing & recording to actually learn the valuable lessons presented by Danny Gill...
