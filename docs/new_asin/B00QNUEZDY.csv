8692227,5,B00QNUEZDY,I love Tim Minchin! He is definitely original and has an honest point of view. I hope he comes to the states and does another musical!,1452643200,,134,4.1923076923076925
8692228,5,B00QNUEZDY,"Tim Minchin is simply brilliant.  He is funny, smart and amazingly talented.  I fell in love with his work from the first minute I saw of his DVD performance with the Heritage Orchestra at Royal Albert Hall and proceeded to track down and purchase every CD and DVD and book (Storm, also brilliant!) that he has done.  Simply put, if you have a brain, a sense of humor and appreciate music- you cannot help but love his work!!!  I strongly recommend ANYTHING he has produced or been associated with as an artist.  You will not be disappointed.",1445644800,4,542,4.546391752577319

8692231,5,B00QNUEZDY,"Tim Minchin is pure brilliance!  An amazing pianist who delivers spot-on insightful comedy with a huge warm heart.  Love to watch him!  Hope more people in the US get acquainted with Tim so more of his live shows are available on US format DVDs.  Don't let the title put you off.  He does use common language but in the most tasteful, intelligent way.  If you want to laugh your socks off, get this!  Great entertainment!",1428192000,2,421,4.533333333333333

8692233,5,B00QNUEZDY,"Tim combines world class musical talent with a distinctly off kilter world view.  You'll go from hysterical laughter, to choking back tears during the encore performance of the thought provoking song ""Its Not Perfect"".",1425600000,2,218,5.411764705882353
