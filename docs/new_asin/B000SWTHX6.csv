you should get all three",1371254400,,108,4.45
8207057,4,B000SWTHX6,"I really enjoyed it a lot, although it was not Jillian, Jackie or Tony Horton! She was okay, someone to shake up my regular
routine! Thank you seller/God bless!",1355270400,,160,4.551724137931035
8207058,5,B000SWTHX6,"I have all three of Michelle's workouts and I like them...The only thing that's a little hard to take is Michelle's voice, it's pretty high pitched and can work on your nerves a little so I have to turn the tv down after a while and of course, that isn't her fault. She's adorable, though and she motivates you to want to get to that 1 minute finish line for each exercise. The workouts are solid and she's an excellent instructor. I would highly recommend her workouts and found them to be a great buy for the price. I would have paid more for these.",1277164800,,551,4.257142857142857
8207059,4,B000SWTHX6,"This is a solid workout, which you can make as challenging as you want, based on the weight you use. Each exercise is done for about 1 minute, which is nice, because I feel like I can do just about anything for 1 minute.",1240272000,2,220,4.0227272727272725
8207060,5,B000SWTHX6,"She's great. What I like is the fact that she' always telling you: come on! try to do your best but also find your own rhythm. She involves you and the 30 minutes activity go by quickly. I have the Total body, but the upper and lower body as well. Good job!",1234483200,2,257,3.9615384615384617
