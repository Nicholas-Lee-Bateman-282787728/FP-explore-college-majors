8009881,5,B0001BS4MO,"This DVD is the original English version narrated bt Brian Wilde.

More adventures of Milton who lives in the clock on the mantlepiece in the home of Mrs Witherspoon. He has more big ideas that he tries to bring to reality while his friend Douglas the dog looks on & shakes his head with ""oh no, not again"".

A delightful relaxing calming experience for the whole family. Once again, highly recommended.",1239148800,,403,4.661971830985915
