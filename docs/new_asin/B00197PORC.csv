8272293,4,B00197PORC,"Its a good movie with a good cast. Interestingly, I never heard of this movie until recently. But it apparently did well at the box office so I guess I wasn't paying attention. Anyway its a movie about the art of card counting & how a group of MIT students with their mathematics professor (played by Kevin Spacey) go to Las Vegas to beat the 21 card tables. Definitely worth the watch. Cast includes Laurence Fishburne & Kate Bosworth.",1520640000,,436,4.531645569620253
