8151546,5,B000JKQNAC,"This movie evoked very conflicted opinions by Indians, as it addressed a subject that is not only fundamentally taboo in Indian society, but would never be talked about openly.  The story is about a girl who married a family friend but finds real love afterward, which ultimately leads to adultery and the break-up of two marriages, along with its impact on the families. Although not the first movie to broach the subject (Mahesh Bhatt's Arth, and some others come to mind), nevertheless, the movie was a bold move by the Director Karan Johar, who is otherwise known for his opulent and grand productions.  The movie made a moderate amount of money in India (it was a ""Hit"") but in the Indian Diaspora it was a blockbuster and the combined returns made it a top grosser in its year of release.",1357430400,,794,4.664285714285715
8151547,5,B000JKQNAC,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE.  BRAVO! BRAVO! This movie is one of the greatest bollywood movies I have watched to date.  I enjoyed it so very much, so much so that i watched it several times over.  I could not resist the superb acting. Shahrukh Khan and Rani Mukhuju greatly compliment each other throughout the movie. They work well together. This movie deserves the highest award ever for best acting and best movie.  Shahrukh Khan is the best believable actor there is and in this movie he is just so huge.  Such a wonderful story line too.  Although its about an affair its still such a good, good enjoyable movie.  Its a long movie but well worth the time to sit and watch it.  The music is absolutely great and so lovely and beautiful that i purchased the CD as well. Just such a good all around movie.  All the actors are superb.  I hightly recommend this movie if you really want to have a enjoyable evening.",1253923200,,906,4.403614457831325
8151548,5,B000JKQNAC,"As an avid fan of Bollywood movies, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna stands out as a favorite. This movie truly shows the evolvement of Bollywood films. The plot is edgy for a Bollywood flick and the acting is good overall and lacks most of the cheesiness of so many other films. My husband, who grew up around Indian films and never liked them, watched this (by force), but actually ended up enjoying it.

KANK is a poignant love story with the tear-jerking moments that Indian films are best at bringing. The music is also good, but not overdone. I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys the occasional Bollywood film or who is looking to looking to get into the genre.",1236643200,2,669,4.575
8151549,5,B000JKQNAC,"Great movie regardless, it is heart wrenching as the characters search for love within their marriages only to realize the love they seek is not there.  The music is wonderful too.  The dance scenes are lots of fun, colorful and energetic.
I love this movie.",1199836800,5,258,4.711111111111111
