3646026,5,B001HZY1TI,"First i wondered about the title but once I searched and found out the meaning I was very intrigued by this movie.  I was constantly surprised by the magical turning of events.  Sometimes I thought I had bought an erotic movie, then spiritual, then romantic and finally a commited relationship in the gay world.  Oh my Dorothy where are you ?  This is not Kansas.
I think there is something for everybody to enjoy & be shocked by and isn't thar why we embrace the movie experience?",1224979200,2,481,4.494252873563219
3646027,5,B001HZY1TI,"Beauty takes many forms and sometimes you might not ""see"" it immediately. This film reminds us that our vision is often blurred by our strict reliance on our physical eyes. This is not your typical gay film. Open yourself to Beatific Vision and you'll open yourself to unequal beauty!",1224720000,6,284,4.816326530612245
3646028,5,B001HZY1TI,Films can inspire.  Films can entertain.  Films can make us think.  This film does it all.  This is a film that transcends gender and sexual orientation.  It touches the humanity in us all.  It is a love story that allows us to witness the relinquishing of the death of one love (in this case a real death) and the opening to new possibilities learned from the lessons of that love.  It is about moving on and embracing the hope of the future while honoring the past.  Thank you for taking us on this heartfelt journey.,1224720000,8,519,4.389473684210526
3646029,5,B001HZY1TI,"I was so moved by this wonderful storyline.  It combines sadness at a loss and hope for a new beginning.  The fine acting just brings these concepts to life so eloquently and effortlessly.  For anyone who may have lost love but is now searching for what you lost, this is a perfect antidote to just yearning on your own.  The eroticism is so well executed that it never feels overdone or overexposed -- and at times is humorous and just plain fun.  I loved this movie!",1224720000,8,468,4.395348837209302
3646030,5,B001HZY1TI,I think that the story's very interesting and a lot of laugh.  The production is taking very seriously.  I can see that the director spent a lot of time and thought in his film.  A very touching gay lovely movie that I highly recommend.,1224547200,6,236,4.318181818181818
3646031,5,B001HZY1TI,"This is a wonderful tale of gay love, life and death, told deftly by director Sountru.  The film shows off the really big talent of actor, Michael Vega, and Sountru's incredible ability to find up and coming young Asian talent for his project.  This is not your run-of-the-mill gay movie.  It's done with humor, delicacy, and intimacy, telling a story that hasn't been told before on film.  Don't miss it.",1224374400,12,405,4.742857142857143
3646032,5,B001HZY1TI,"The producer/writer/director has given us a refreshing glimpse into gay life told with humor, imagination and moments of introspection.  For any of us who have gone through losses, it takes us to the ""other side"" and how the ""other side"" is helping us along the path to healing and reclaiming our lives.  This would be a fine addition to any gayman's library of films.",1224288000,6,368,4.734375
3646033,5,B001HZY1TI,"How often have we forgotten the simple pleasures of loving and remembering someone? I watched this movie with my boyfriend, and it made us recall how love can be very simple, yet exciting, and full of surprises. When someone leaves, it can be both sad and joyous. When someone enters, he is actually returning in another form.

I like this movie cos its a story told simply and poignantly, not like many gay-themed movies that portray gay people as either incorrigible party-queens, or as tragic subjects destined for heartbreak and discrimination. Still, there are enough kinky bits California-style to make this a racy movie with some twists.

Another thing I like - Beautifully shot and nice music. Definitely a winner and keeper, for any one who knows how, and wants to, love again.",1224288000,13,786,4.902255639097745

3646037,2,B001HZY1TI,This was a paid rental and I still couldn't finidh the movie.  The dialog was vague and either the acting was not good or the acting was excellent and the people were very poor speakers.  It seemed sort of cheesy to me and I often couldn't follow what was going on.  The main characters were gay; but their emotions were universal under the circumstances.  This is billed as a gay movie; but it is not - it is a movie about losing a lover in a relationship that happens to be gay.,1429833600,2,480,4.184782608695652

3646051,3,B001HZY1TI,"Ridiculous premise and strange ""chemistry"" between the actors. But it does paint a positive light for ""thruples"" aka triads.  A totally campy version of Ghost, Maxie and Threesome combined.",1391644800,,189,5.517241379310345

Angel Truth Reality Empowers Life Today! The Bible says of Angels:- personal spiritual beings with intelligence & personalities(1Peter1:12),they show emotion(James 2:19)& exercise will(Jude 6).Both true of Good & fallen angels(demons). Angels travel to earth in a second unless (Daniel10:13). There are two angels to every one demon(Rev. 12:4).Animals see angels(Num22:30-33).Do not be critical of angels(Exodus 23:20-22).  Warning -Angels tell of the final Anti-Christ & Beast (Rev. 14:9-13). Warning-Do not worship angels(Rev. 22:8-9).All angels rejoice as one sinner repents(Luke 15;9-10) Angels he created first, envoys of finite knowledge, don't have Gods omnipotence (Matt24 :36). Angels have more truth in 3 ways. 1st angels are higher beings than humans & possess greater abilities. 2ndangels study Living Jesus Bible Word(John 1:1) & the world gaining greater spiritual wisdom(James2:19-25). 3rdangels gain knowledge by long human observation. Unlike humans, angels have lived the past, demons too. They both know all that has happened & can predict & prompt our actions. Angels combat saboteur demons & their sly agents. Be sober & alert(1Peter 5:8). Angel Bread(Ps. 78:25). Angels strengthen(Luke22:43),Heal(Tobit12:14)& Light  Shine(Acts12:7).Angel Tongues(1Cor. 13:1).Angels apropos Gods will. Angels cant grant sin forgiveness. Angels are vastly numerous (Rev. 5:11-14). Angels are God sent to help believers (Hebrews 1:14). Angels camp around those who fear God (Psalm 34:7-8). Warning - Demons can & do appear as angels of light (2Cor. 11:14). Angels before God (Job 1:6).They praise love God first (Isaiah 6:3).They serve God (Rev. 22:9),worship God(Rev. 5:8-13)& rejoice in all God does(Job 38:6-7).They are instruments of God's judgments(Rev. 7:1),wield Gods power(2Kings19:35),help believers win wars(2Kings6:8-2),terminate life(Acts12:23),angel reapers(Matt13:39),decree Gods Truth(Acts7:38, 53),angel watchers of Christian order,work & suffering(1Peter1:12).They cast down demons(Rev. 12:9).They bring answers to prayer(Acts 12:5-10), they guide(Acts8:26-29), they aid in winning people to Christ(Acts 8:26).Encourage in times of danger(Acts27:23-24).Care for the righteous at death(Luke 16:22).Angels don't marry/reproduce(Matt 22:30).Angels both genders(Acts12:7 Zech. 5:9).Angels are holy(sinless) by choice  & free will (Mark 8:37,38).They Prophesy & Interpret Dreams(Matt 1:18-21).They carry Gods messages(Luke 2:10) & represent God on earth. God is Spirit! (John 4:24).Humans do not become angels after death but have both eternal spirit & soul(1Thess. 5:23).Angels are eternal spiritual beings that can take on worldly form (Hebrews 1:14)but do not become human beings. The Bible does not say angels are created in Gods likeness, as are humans(Genesis 1:26). God first created sinless angels but Satan rebelled, hated God, pride fell seeking worship(Matt. 4:9),tempted Adam & Eves(mankinds)rebellion, disgrace(sin) & slander of Gods Will. Satan prides self, selfish & do whatever. Heaven free from rebellion & sin is the busiest place in the entire Universe. Intercession angels herald humility & Truth with unquestioning obedience to Father Gods Commands, Will & Love. Miracles Happen Everyday!

3646057,2,B001HZY1TI,this movie was poorly written. the concept is good but the deliver awful. the threesome is very unlikely and the idea it was brought about in this manor childish. poorly acted and another gay movie not worth the time or money spent.,1367020800,,232,4.5476190476190474

Some, like the author of this thing, should have been banned from making films. He doesn't even use his real name. I am not suprised. If I created such crap, I would have done it anonymously too!
There are not words to describe how stupid and unbelievable is the script. It reaches the lowest levels of the silliness bottom.
Acting...There is no such thing as acting here.
After I saw ""Aaron...albeit sex hero"" yesterday, I thought it can't get worse than that. Well, apparently it can and it got.

3646063,1,B001HZY1TI,"This is possibly the worse movie I have ever seen. I had read a brief summary of this film and the story seemed interesting. Talk about doing absolutely nothing with a potentially good idea. The acting is so bad; especially the role of Damian, the geek/nerd. We have seen this type of character over and over in teen flicks but never before have I been subjected to such a bad performance, the stereotype times ten.

How any of these characters would get together in the first place is beyond belief. The dialogue throughout the entire thing is unbearable.

If you plan to watch this movie, you might want to consider a lobotomy first.

Trust me, it's the only way to get through this wretchedly written, poorly performed piece of nonsense.  I should have known that if they need to sex up the DVD cover, the insides are most likely bad.  This is bad in every way--actors who can't act, an awful script, and bad everything else.  The description of this movie may make it sound high-minded and beautiful--but it's clearly none of the above.  If only they had gotten the DVD copy writer to write the script!

I went in really wanting to enjoy it, especially as I like stories involving angels.
I was ""sold"" on watching it after reading several of the 5-star reviews, and boy
was I hoodwinked. Talk about being deceived. With the exception of Michael Vega,
every actor turns in an excruciating poor  performance. The script is unspeakably bad,
and the camera direction poorly framed. People, please avoid this disaster. I'm an
amazon Prime member, and there are so, so many other free movies I could have
chosen over this one. Shame on all those bogus 5-star reviewers. It really hurts the
integrity of the review system. May karma catch up with you sooner than later.",1474329600,2,738,4.765625
8310241,2,B001HZY1TI,"The synopsis is that Michaels lover of fourteen years has died from brain cancer, but before he died he decided he was going to look after Michael and one of their friends until they were happy. He now becomes Chad Angel and talks to them to give them life advice etc.

They also have a predilection for leather sites on the old web, but not the hard core sort as it turns out. Through this Michael meets Damien and well you can join the dots.

This seems to be selling itself as a fetish romp but is far removed from any such antics. There are some nudity shots but nothing to worry the Vicar. It is supposed to be funny too but is done so in an over the top cutesy way, that is just stereotyping without the charm. It is passable but I could not sit through it again. For an indie effort it has done above average but still not one anyone is going to rave about  unless they were in it. I think my rating is probably generous too but as I said it is just above average for a gay independent film.",1473552000,,998,4.081632653061225
