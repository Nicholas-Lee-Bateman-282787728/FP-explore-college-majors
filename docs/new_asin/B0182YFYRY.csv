7538998,2,B0182YFYRY,"Zombie Fight Club could have been better, had it not made a huge mistake.

The premise of the film is, an atmospheric disease covering the earth. Once that happens, people can become zombies. The film follows the general rule of the dead becoming the undead. But it also had a few scenes of people who were alive becoming zombies. In any case, the first half of the movie follows a group of seedy characters, as they struggle to survive the zombie outbreak in their apartment building. The second half, follows the life of a few of the survivors. Basically the world has become a depraved realm of zombie and human slaves who battle each other, while corrupt slave owners enjoy the entertainment. That's about the jist of it, so I'll leave the rest for you to see on your own.

Well, this film made a huge mistake which I already pointed out. It tries to become two stories mixed into one. That being said, the first half was pretty much a waste of time. Yeah there were people and zombies battling one another. But it was more like a bunch of random scenes of zombie violence. We follow several groups of characters, most of whom are lowlifes, that basically show us how bad people can become in a crisis. Almost all of them had no sense of preserving the well being of others. The cops were as bad as the criminals, stealing money and assulting women. All save one, named Andy. The female characters basically ran around like damsels in distress. Several are turned into nude or partially nude zombies. This goes on and on and most of them die. Either by each other or by the zombies.

I guess you could make the argument that its a set up for the second half, where the world is like a zombie holocaust. But even that doesn't help much. The men basically treat the women like tramps. And the few women in charge, dress like dominatrixes. All the while, the decent characters are slaves, that have to fight the zombies in an arena. Even though the situation is grim, it was still a better option to base the entire film on. We didn't really need to see the first half, about a bunch of characters who don't make it out alive anyway.

In any case, lots of violence. Some of it looked like cheap CGI. Some nudity and several gratuitous sex scenes. Many of those were assult on women. Not the finest hour of humankind in a crisis.

Tech aspects on the DVD include, an English and Mandrian language track. Also subtitles in English.

My final rating is a 2. And that's mainly because of the split decision on the story. The first half should have been all flashbacks only occurring in the second half. A little information here and there was all that was needed. Not 45 minutes of random zombie violence. I also would have preferred to see more redeeming characters overall. We basically had two by the end. The rest were people who basically made an argument as to why the human race should go instinct. Maybe worth a rental at best. But in reality,  there are far better zombie films out there.",1455494400,4,2994,4.482568807339449

7539000,3,B0182YFYRY,"Bad Bath Salts cause a world wide zombie epidemic. The first hour of the film concerns a zombie outbreak in an apartment building. After an hour of fighting zombies and no character introduction we jump to one year later and get one scene of a zombie fight club which was an arena pitting a group of humans vs a group of zombies.

The film has crammed everything we love about cult films into one with no regard to characters or plot continuity. The film has has plenty of blood and guts, with lots of shooting and blood splatter. There are hot nude Asian chicks, an arena fight scene, a prison shower scene, some girl-girl action, forced sex, and CG explosions. In spite of having all the bells and whistles it was ill constructed, spending way too much time killing zombies in a hallway.

If you have made it this far, that means the title has intrigued you and you want to see it. My advice is a rental.

Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity. The film is dubbed in English and has English sub option.",1454889600,4,993,4.415300546448087

7539007,4,B0182YFYRY,"PLOT...
Deep in the city there is a building riddled with crime and corruption (mainly drug dealers) A special team of police go inside to take them down, all of a sudden a zombie apocalypse happens and humanity is over in the blink of an eye due to a certain drug that's going around (no explanation) now its cops and criminals vs zombies in an all out survival of the fittest. But as events unfold for certain characters a new and more corrupt future is in store for the human race that are still alive.

As people have said this is largely a mash up of the Raid and the Horde and a whole load of other things, the movie is insane but and at some points makes no sense but its hugely entertaining probably due to the great first hour of the movie as its mindless violence and zombie killing action that is pretty non stop, The effects are questionable throughout as most of them are CGI unfortunately, the blood doesn't look too bad though and the gore is rather gruesome and good fun, its almost like a live action manga, probably the worst effects is when they do an explosion, CGI fire is horrible but there's not much of it, the zombie make-up looks great, the cast is all good, some cool fight scenes and lots of sexy half naked ladies throughout, the movie is in Mandarin for most part but there are English speaking actors too, the last 30 minutes of the movie gets weird and completely changes the pace of the story which slightly let it down, but hey its worth picking up cheap as its highly entertaining anyway, certainly worth a watch, a totally bonkers zombie killing bloodbath.

cover art is nothing to do with the movie

7539008,1,B0182YFYRY,"Okay, two things... First off, I didn't buy this, I rented it. Thank God for libraries with dvds. Lol

And secondly, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE, UNLESS you don't mind that the sexy tight leather wearing underworld knockoff woman that's on the cover is nowhere to be found, then this movie is most definitely for you. That's right, the woman on the cover is nowhere in the movie, and to be honest, she was the only reason why I wanted to watch it because she looks like she can kill a lot of zombies. But no. It was a huge disappointment.",1459814400,,536,4.306930693069307

8741240,2,B0182YFYRY,"I expected to like this as I like b-grade action movies and have a strong interest in Taiwan where it was made (I lived there four years and when I saw it went ""MC Hotdog made a movie? Cool!"" Alas, I did not. Clearly the film was written as an excuse to tie together a lot of disjointed ideas for scenes (and some of the ideas actually are kind of cool, i.e. two martial artists kick box inside an old bus while a horde of zombies surround the bus and try to break in) but ultimately I found the plot impossible to follow. Even worse, there was lots of gratuitous sexual violence in the film, a major turn off for me.",1536624000,,617,4.107438016528926
