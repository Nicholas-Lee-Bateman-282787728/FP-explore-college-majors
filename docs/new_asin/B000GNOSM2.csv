8133623,5,B000GNOSM2,"Well if the music scares you turn the sound down. It's not all bad. The first dance is for 3 men and 3 women dressed in white. The second piece is a fairly humorous pas de deux mostly in silhouette with tinkling music that is easy on the ears. The third piece for 3 men dancing with poles the length of Ben Hur's oar. The fourth a pas de quatre with music that is a bit shrill though on the quiet side and surreal interjections. The fifth is a lyrical piece, perhaps for water spirits with a film of waves superimposed on the dancers and more tinkling music. The sixth piece is for two flirtatious women and three men on the make more or less, very humorous as is the music with jazzy elements. The sixth a passionate solo for a female dancer who looks nude but isn't accompanied by a solo guitar. Superb dancing all around.",1212537600,6,824,4.254777070063694
8133624,5,B000GNOSM2,"This DVD contains seven ultra modern ballet miniatures of a rather abstract nature, using mostly atonal music.  They are choreographed for two to six dancers, except for the last one, which is a solo.  The dancing is best described as ultra modern, but I would still put it in the ballet category.  The women dance on pointe.  The costumes vary, but are all relatively simple.  The image and sound are excellent and up to modern standards.  The camera work was perfect and never caused any frustration.  These pieces are abstract, but like most abstract art, there seems to be a theme.  If I were to hazard a guess, I would say they were about the difficulties men and women face with their romantic relationships.  One even has a bunch of plastic infants, indicating relationships within a family.  The last ballet, a solo, is more abstract.  It would have been useful if a discussion of these ballets were included by the choreographer, but there is none.  The closing credits are interesting and unusual, showing a short recap of each ballet with a list of its credits.  This DVD is recommended for all fans of ultra modern ballet and modern dance.",1157155200,11,1151,4.723618090452261
