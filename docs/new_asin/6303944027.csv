Special Footnote, actor Allan Lane looked to better roles, he signed with Republic in 1940 ... after struggling a bit in his initial films, hit pay dirt after teaming with Linda Stirling in the popular serial ""The Tiger Woman"" (1944) ... his own serials with ""Daredevils of the Red Circle"" (1939) and ""King of the Royal Mounted"" (1940), Mountie Dave King proved popular and, around this time, he started gaining added attention as a photogenic and very personable cowboy star, with his trusty steed ""Blackjack,"" ... Lane managed to churn out a bucketful of oaters every year beginning with ""Silver City Kid"" (1944)), for nearly a decade, trading blows with the bad guy Roy Barcroft and seeing justice prevail ... best remembered these days for his dashing good looks and saddle appeal on film ... it's no small wonder that Allan Rocky Lane's name was at the top of the list, working with the top directors of the day Howard P. Bretherton, Spencer Gordon Bennett, Joseph Kane, Wallace A. Grissell, Leslie Selander and R.G. Springsteen all under Republic Pictures banner.
