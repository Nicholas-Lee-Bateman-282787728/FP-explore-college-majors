8222685,4,B000WCUOVG,"I 1st read the book In Broad Daylight when I was a kid (GREAT book) & after hearing there was a movie based on the book, I just had to see it. In my opinion, the movie was almost as good as the book was. If you liked the movie, pick up the book & if you liked the book, watch the movie. I say it alot in my old Made For TV movie reviews, they don't make Made For TV movies like they use to & here's another. In Broad Daylight had my attention right from the start & had me on the edge of my seat till the very end. Brian Dennehy was absolutely evil. If I had a list of movie villains I LOVE to HATE, Brian Dennehy as Len Rowan would be 1 of them. I don't understand why In Broad Daylight & some other Made For TV movies as well were never released on DVD.If it ever is, I'd pick it up. I can't imagine everybody liking this movie but I think that most people that watch it will",1472601600,2,877,3.7717391304347827

8222688,5,B000WCUOVG,"Please make this available on DVD!  This was a terrific true story, and Brian Dennehy is chilling as the town villain, Len Rowan. I had this on vhs (copied from television) and let a friend borrow it, they gave it to a friend, and passed it along and I never saw it again!!",1388793600,,273,4.150943396226415
8222689,4,B000WCUOVG,"In Broad Daylight, 1989 film

This movie is based on an event in July 1981 when a local criminal was shot while sitting in his parked pick-up truck on Main Street in Skidmore Missouri (a small rural town of about 500 people). The local police and the FBI investigated the murder, but no one ever talked. The murder of Ken Rex McElroy remains unsolved to this day. No one on the street that day saw anything, they said they ducked for cover when the shots were fired. This movie explains why people must be able to protect themselves when the law fails to do so. This is based on the book of the same name. The book by Harry MacLean goes into more details than is possible in this movie.

You can read about the San Francisco Vigilante Committee of 1851 and how it eliminated crime when the authorities did not.. It was copied in many other areas in the 19th century. But in time its excesses made it a symbol for private vengeance and lawlessness. ""Vigilante"" is Spanish for `Watchman' (the old term for local police, as in the Night Watch).",1360195200,,1041,4.416666666666667
