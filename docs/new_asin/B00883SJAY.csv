8526073,5,B00883SJAY,"For anyone who already knows a lot about Frank Zappa but wants to know more, this DVD is excellent as it gives a clear account of the people he brought to his record labels, Straight and Bizarre, together with a fine analysis of the various records by Alice Cooper, Captain Beefheart, The GTOs, to name but a few. And if anyone is interested in learning even more about Frank Zappa and his life during that period, look no further than Freak Out! My Life with Frank Zappa by Pauline Butcher. She lived and worked in the house during the period of this film and gives a detailed account of Frank's personal life during those four years 1968 to 1972. But buy this DVD. It's very well put together and very watchable.",1341964800,9,714,4.458015267175573
