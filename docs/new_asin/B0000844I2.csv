7978775,5,B0000844I2,"After witnessing, as a child, the murder of her parents and blocking out the rest of her trauma, a young woman is finally able to live her peace and quiet life... for a minute, for as quick as you can say 'Scream rip-off', it looks like the same murderer is on the loose again, and this time he's close on her trails.  Nothing is new in this German made film.  We get all your typically new millenium slasher flick ingredients: cool music, cool FX, cool kids, cool twist...  What's fun with FLASHBACK, however, is its direction. Michael Karen's camera work never goes for the easy shot.  His pivotal barn scene, for instance, where a would-be victim is running against time is done with such bravour and witt that even colors become a character.  Sure, reinvention may not be the key here, but when done with style, like this one is, the stop is all worthwhile. FLASHBACK may not break any grounds but is an effective slasher film; a clone of the Scream franchise, maybe, but a highly competent one.-----Martin Boucher",1114732800,2,1018,4.633333333333334
7978776,4,B0000844I2,"Remember the delectably sexy Elke Sommer?  SHOT IN THE DARK, THE PRIZE, DEADLIER THAN THE MALE?  All hit movies of the sixties.  And she makes an appearance as the sinister housekeeper in this dubbed movie from Germany.  Once you get past watching the mouths (the dubbing is awful), you may enjoy the slashfest that occurs.  The movie has some original twists that I didn't see coming, including the ending which is reminiscent of the beginning.  Fiendishly campy with some strange humor, and some big plot holes, FLASHBACK was penned by Jimmy Sangster who gave us some of those delightful Hammer films of the seventies.  The scenery is beautiful, including the house in which the movie was filmed.  The acting is about par for this kind of film, and it is relentlessly gory.  But slasher fans, particularly of the Euroslash will enjoy.",1101945600,2,836,4.872340425531915
7978777,5,B0000844I2,"I saw this movie in the year 1999 in a cinema when it was released here in Germany. It was clear from the first minute of the film that this is going to be a complete [waste]. This didn't look so good at the beginning, but after 10min watching you'll notice that it's not supposed to be a really scary movie....I'ts supposed to be a horror-comedy. And this is really great fun.
Some of the scenes you're like ""Huh? Do did he/she/it do that?"". So sometimes it's a little unrealistic. So what? All movies are a little unrealistic so don't let that spoil you're mood. The ending is really really REALLY unexpected and very brutal. The last 30 min is just like a slasher-fest in the garden of a large house where three stupid teenagers are hunted by a murderer with a very sharp sickel. And this is incredibly done. Because the pain you see the actors have makes you shriek together as if you were living this through.
The movie's doesn't really have any shock-scenes but it does have its intense moments and I think that real fear is better than a ghost jumping out of a closet.
All in one: This movie is kinda scary and doesn't have very good acting at all (Well maybe the first 7 min are ok). But this movie is really more brutal than anything I've ever seen. Original murdering scenes (Blender, Kitchen, Pool...) make this movie one hell of a ride.
A must see for all who enjoyed ""Scream 3"" and ""Anatomy 2"" (I don't know when Anatomy 2 is starting in USA. Sorry!).",1045699200,10,1464,4.386029411764706
