8593488,5,B00DI67Y4I,"Just finished watching and I can't express how it moved me.  Amazing acting all around.  Amazing storytelling.  Gavilan is riveting and totally convincing.  I don't know if it will have the same effect if you don't know Spanish and aren't familiar with Violeta's music, but it's worth a try.  I lived in Santiago as a child.  We played her albums constantly (and Angel and Isabel's) and we went out to the carpa in La Reina to hear her several times.  I didn't know much about her life, her love or even her politics.  Just her songs, which I still sing.  Gavilan's voice is more polished than Violeta's but she's just as expressive and has the style down.  A beautiful, wrenching film about a great artist.",1508284800,,707,4.584
