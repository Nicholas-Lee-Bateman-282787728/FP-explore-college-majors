The film begins with a man racing on a pinto horse. He looks back at the three men in pursuit. They catch Dusty and take him to a tree. He lost a bet! Miss Willard meets the Range Busters. They want to stop the bandits who operate around Stony Creek. Wells Fargo will pay them. One masked man holds up a stagecoach. The Range Busters ride by, see the lone rider, and follow only to lose him. The sheriff will search for this bandit. Ernie discovers why his partner didn't go into town! But the sheriff blames Ernie for the robbery. Dusty sings again. Ernie explains his actions; he must hide. Ernie is captured by one of the robbers, he will be blamed for the robberies. Crash has a scheme: they well send money on the stagecoach. This will cause another robbery once the villains learn of this shipment.

We learn about the conspiracy in the shipping company! The real robbers show up in pursuit and follow Crash and Dusty. Tim Douglas says they will ensure Ernie doesn't talk about what he knows. Alibi listens to the talk in the saloon. They get the stage driver to talk. This reveals the crime. Strike decides its time to run out. The Range Busters arrive for a shoot-out. The sheriff and his men catch the pair who shot the man driving a wagon. Douglas makes his escape. But he is caught like the others. Ernie is cleared of the crime. Next the sheriff arrests the Range Busters for that hold-up. And so they ride off until the next picture.

Parts of this story seem implausible, but this is really a parody. The crooks run the express company and the heroes rob the stagecoach! The opening scene was a clue. What other movie used a dummy as one of the characters?",1287964800,,1701,4.44551282051282

Weeks and Monogram Pictures --- With a character of his own name. Ray starred in 20 of the 24 films in this series between 1940 and 1943 --- The Range Busters was clearly a lower budget copy of the Mesquiteers --- Big, muscular Ray 'Crash' Corrigan was the lead, the second lead was John 'Dusty' King, a big band singer (Ben Bernie Orchestra) with a reasonably good baritone, who would vocalize a tune or two in each film --- And comic relief was in the hands of ventriloquist Max 'Alibi' Terhune (and his wise-cracking dummy Elmer --- Monogram would distribute the Range Busters but not be directly involved in the productions --- The deal gave Corrigan a substantial share of the film profits (in an interview years later, Ray said he received 50%).

The story line and plot, Our heroes Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan (Himself), Dusty (John King) and Alibi (Max Terhune) members of the Range Busters help rid a town of a gang of cut-throats terrorizing the citizenry of the local community --- This oater features a little bit of everything from action, comedy and suspense in a standard western screenplay --- Range Busters go undercover, take on a gang of ruthless outlaws, and bring them to justice --- Corrigan had a long career in film, mostly in ""B"" films. His best work was in the Three Mesquiteer series, but he does a good job in this routine oater --- Terhune was a decent comedian, but his ventriliquist dummy Elmer almost seems out of place at times --- Some heavy weight badmen Charles King, Kermit Maynard and Slim Whitaker, plus veteran B-Western character actors Forrest Taylor, Jack Ingram, Steve Clark, Stanley Price and Frank Ellis --- Watch for soon to be a star in his own series Eddie Dean as one of the henchmen --- Another favorite heroine Nell O'Day who always gives a good performance.
