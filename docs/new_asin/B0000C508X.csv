1913062,1,B0000C508X,"The listing shows this as the short film by Mychal Wilson, Director -  David Portlock, and actor Carsten Norgaard.  This is NOT thier award winning short film.

1913063,2,B0000C508X,"Although drawing on the advice of expert Paul Cartelege and producing an excellent visual experience with beautiful on location sequences, the entire documentary is disappointing rehash of the usual clichs about Sparta. The image of Sparta is uni-dimensional, some quotes from Herodotus taken out of context, and the picture of Sparta undifferentiated. For example, there is no evidence whatever that, as suggested in the film, the boys of the agoge lived outside of society for more than a few months, much less that they learned no skills other than survival and fighting. Spartan men were literate, admired for their wit, their terse rhetoric and were skilled in music and dance. The insistance on ""compulsory homosexuality"" and the image of a society in which men and women led completely separate lives is controversial at best and ridiculous at worst. The focus on Sparta's hoplites alone, while traditional, nevertheless distorts the fact that even Spartan men were only on active service for 10 years and men over the age of 30 no longer had to live in barracks.  In fact, they lived on their farms with their wives and children like gentlemen farmers everywhere in the world.  Likewise the recurring theme of the oppressed Messenians overlooks the fact that Sparta apparently had very loyal Laconian helots. It is a pity that such a good opportunity for a more balanced view of Sparta was missed in favour of the usual unidimensional treatment. For an alternative interpretation of Sparta based on ancient sources rather than modern myth read any of Helena Schrader's novels set in Ancient Sparta:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Are-They-Singing-in-Sparta/dp/0595386903/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Are They Singing in Sparta?</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spartan-Slave-Spartan-Queen-A-Tale-of-Four-Women-in-Sparta/dp/059547067X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spartan Slave, Spartan Queen: A Tale of Four Women in Sparta</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Olympic-Charioteer/dp/0595367828/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Olympic Charioteer</a>",1200182400,11,2180,6.539792387543253
1913064,1,B0000C508X,"This is NOT good.  Three hour-long episodes of this remind one why PBS still has a fundraiser every year.  Because shows like this, that could be fascinating, are just boring.

If you've seen or read about the city/state system of Greece, there are many conclusions drawn here that either just don't add up, or seem outright wrong.

The narrator appears on screen constantly, and I'm not sure why.  Her tone and facial expression seem to indicate a distaste for the material, prompting one to ask why she did this in the first place.  Or felt the need to be onscreen non-stop.  It ends up being distracting, to the point that it takes away from the scholarly enterprise that's supposed to be going on.  Certainly footage of the Greek countryside could have been used.

Also odd, why they show footage of modern day people in modern pubs while talking about Sparta and Athens of 480 B.C.  No money from the sale of totebags to afford a reenactment here or there?

All in all, it makes you trealize how much better the History Channel and Discovery Channel now do the same material.

You'd do better to either watch Zack Snyder's movie, The 300, or read its source material, the Frank Miller graphic novel of the same name.  Both play it more than a little loose history-wise, but the battle scenes are spectacular.

Your best bet?  See the History Channel's documentary, now on DVD, The Last Stand of the 300.  Historically accurate, fantastic reenactments, costumes, and drama.  Drama befitting the true tale of the 300.",1175472000,15,1520,4.740458015267175
1913065,5,B0000C508X,"An engaging documentary artfully assembled, this 2003 British production has been a hit for PBS in the United States, with the videos and tie-in book (the US edition of Paul Cartledge's The Spartans) often on backorder status. It is a rarity in that it gives Sparta its due for helping Greece resist the Persian threat and credits Sparta for its more enlightened attitude toward women. Although at times it may project a faint pro-Athens bias, host Bettany Hughes is a sympathetic and knowledgeable narrator. THE SPARTANS boasts terrific location photography by Douglas Hartington, with some impressive aerial shots of the Taygetus gorges. For the first time in a television documentary, we are treated to detailed examination of many artifacts in the Sparta Museum as well as shown many photos of archaeological excavations at Sparta. The atmospheric soundtrack is composed by Anthony Burke. Evocative reenactor footage is used - not as much as in the A&E production ""Rise & fall of the Spartans,"" maybe, but effectively presented, even if the footage tends to be come repetitive by Part 3.

Part 1

THE SPARTANS opens at Thermopylae and with the epitaph of the Three Hundred -- and very stirring it is to hear this spoken in the original Greek -- before introducing some of the topics that will be addressed in the program. (Hmm. The claim that ""male homosexuality was compulsory"" is extremely dubious; the first boldfaced assertion as fact of a subject hotly debated among ancient and modern experts.) After the introduction, we journey to the Dark Ages of Greece, the end of the Achaean Age and the coming of the Dorian Greeks to the Peloponnesus and Laconia. An effective look at the development of hoplite warfare is presented. Next comes the Messenian conquest, then the establishment of the Spartan constitution. The upbringing of Spartan youths, warts and all, is then addressed at length. A good point is made that the sublimation of the individual as practiced by the Spartans can be very liberating - ""the possibility of transcending your limitations as an individual and becoming part of something bigger and better."" Spartan institutions are credited for initiating a system of political rights and responsibilities among its citizens centuries before other Greek states conceived of such things.

The finding of the so-called statue of Leonidas in 1925 is used to introduce the Persian Wars, which are then examined in detail. There is much footage of Thermopylae, including the eponymous hot springs, and the commentary casts the Spartans' self-sacrifice in terms that hearken to the Japanese samurai's bushido code.

Part 2

This segment begins by exploring at how Sparta and Athens fell out after the Persian Wars, with a look at Athenian politics and society and how these contrasted to Sparta's. This is a refreshingly non-partisan treatment, not hesitating to be equally critical of Athens. Women's life in Sparta is given much attention. Sparta comes off as considerably more enlightened, by modern Western standards, than Athens. (Interesting sidebar - in her remarks during a November 24, 2003, online chat with Channel 4 (UK) viewers, narrator Bettany Hughes, when asked where she'd have rather lived, Sparta or Athens, replied ""Sparta. No doubt."") Hughes wryly notes how Spartan women were ""objects of fear and fascination"" to non-Spartan men. The legacy of these ""radical"" Spartan customs on later societies is discussed. Amusingly, whether by design or not, Hughes wears a scarlet dress for much of this sequence - fit garb for a Spartanette - and conducts her narration while striding purposefully about the Laconian countryside or riding on horseback in full exhibition of energetic Spartan vitality.

Lastly, the Laconian earthquake of 465 or 464 BC and subsequent helot revolt is noted and seen as the event that lit the sparks of conflict between Greece's two leading cities. The opening clashes of the Peloponnesian War and the Spartan disaster at Sphacteria ends Part 2.

Part 3

The last section of the film opens at Delphi and takes a look at Greek religion and Spartan attitudes toward the gods and oracles before resuming the history of the Peloponnesian War. Alcibiades, the Syracuse expedition, and Lysander are all examined, taking up half of Part 3. Then the period of the Spartan Hegemony is briefly described, shaped by the ""crippled kingship"" of Agesilaus and marked by power struggles among Sparta's ruling factions. Hughes notes the critical decline of Spartan citizen manpower and the rise of Thebes as a rival. She takes us to the battlefield of Leuctra, where Spartan military superiority was broken in 371 BC. The remaining sequences very quickly sketch how classical Sparta became a second-class power and finally a tourist attraction for wealthy Romans. The show concludes with a summation of Sparta's influence on Western philosophy.

THE SPARTANS is a standout documentary, wonderfully photographed and directed, and is highly recommended as a visual overview of Spartan history.

Those interested in further information about this production can read an online interview about ""The Spartans"" with classicist Bettany Hughes and historical consultant Paul Cartledge answering questions from viewers (November 2003)",1174953600,49,5269,5.247030878859857
1913066,4,B0000C508X,"The Spartans is actually three separate documentaries, which attempt to bring to life the legendary heroes of Lacedaemon.
On the positive side:  1) Shot on location, Bettany Hughes does a good job of presenting the actual setting for the events that unfolded.
2) She presents the Battle at Sphacteria of 425 BC, the Syracuse expedition of 415 BC, and the involvement of Alcibiades very well and very accurately.
3) The re-enactment of the hoplite phalanx throughout the documentaries added a nice touch.
4) The theme is Sparta after all; that in itself is a positive aspect!
On the negative side:
1) She does not mention half as much as she should about THE most heroic battle in world history; the Battle at Thermopylae; a three day battle (August 18th, 480 BC through August 20th, 480 BC) for the pass at Thermopylae (the Hot Gates) between an immense Persian host under King Xerxes and a small Greek force led by King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans.  Unlike the Alamo, Custer's Last Stand, and many other glorious battles where the parties involved did not expect to be wiped out, the
Spartans and Thespians willingly held their positions knowing that they could not possibly win against overwhelming odds.  When told that the Persian arrows would block out the sun, they replied 'Good, we will fight in the shade!'
2) Bettany Hughes mentions homosexual relationships between men, when the existing evidence surrounding the issue of whether homosexuality in ancient Greece, and especially in Sparta, was more or less accepted than today is inconclusive and the issue itself is highly controversial; therefore, calling for EXTREME CAUTION when dealing with such matters.  She even goes as far as to proclaim that it was compulsory!  What people do in their own bedrooms is their own business, but to involve Greece's great men and legends in alleged homosexual acts, shows complete lack of respect as well as lack of basic/elementary knowledge of the era in question, with most frequent the misinterpretation of love between friends which did not include anything sexual or homosexual whatsoever!  The warrior-heroes themselves would be turning in their graves if they knew what is being written and said about them by people who are either misinformed or are purposely out to distort the truth in following their own personal agendas.
3) Moreover, there are so many stories relating to the honor and glory of the Spartan hoplites, which are left unsaid; instead only a few and mediocre at that were mentioned.  What ever happened to:
i) The reason why they wore red cloaks.
ii) The reason why they had two kings and the names of the Royal Houses i.e. The Agiads and the Eurypontids.
iii) The story with the boy and the fox that ate its way through his stomach, but he did not cringe.
iv) The story of the stranger who asked the Spartans what happened to adulterers in Sparta, only to be told that they would have to pay as compensation a bull big enough to stand on Mount Taygetus and drink from the river Eurotas, meaning that there are no adulterers in Sparta.
v) The story of the mother who killed her son for having been hit with an arrow in the back (i.e. having turned his back to the enemy).
vi) The story of the mother who upon seeing her son's friend asked how the battle had gone and when her son's friend replied that her child had died, she told him that was not what she had asked; her question was whether Sparta had been victorious.
vii) The Queen of Sparta Gorgo, (and wife to King Leonidas) who when asked by a foreign woman 'how is it that Spartan women are the only ones who rule men?' she answered: 'Yes, for we are the only ones who give birth to men.'
viii) How in Sparta only men who died on the battlefield and women who died during, or shortly after, giving birth were entitled to having a tombstone erected in their honor.
ix) Pausanias' words following the Battle of Platae of 479 BC as to why his Spartans were eating Melas Zomos (the broth) instead of feasting like the rest of the Greeks, 'We are Spartans.'
x) Pausanias' fate after setting up a monument in the Hellespont commemorating the victory over the Persians.
4) In addition she does tend to go off and talk about the other city-states more than she should when the theme is Sparta and not Greece as whole.
Nevertheless, The Spartans will bring out interest in the famed inhabitants of Lacedaemon, and hopefully more books, movies, and documentaries will present these heroes (both men and women) with the reverence and respect they truly deserve.
Strongly recommended is the 1962 film The 300 Spartans; a movie about honor, real men, and real heroes who fought and died in the name of Greece and Freedom.",1151539200,33,4695,4.732273838630807
1913067,5,B0000C508X,"In preparation for the new Frank Miller based movie ""300"" I got this movie to start understanding the role Sparta played in the history of Greece.

1913068,4,B0000C508X,"I expected this DVD to be about Sparta, but it dealt with the whole Greek civilization when Sparta was at its peak.  It was three different programs; each an hour in length.  An excellent review of Greece and their individual thought concepts regarding public life, sex, treatment of women, slaves and war.  Well worth watching, but I did not add it to my personal DVD library.",1130976000,2,377,4.681818181818182
1913069,5,B0000C508X,"[preamble] After reading Plato's ""Republic"" early in my high school years, I realized that Plato's ideal society was what today we'd call fascism.  Plato's ""Republic"" isn't a republic at all, it's mighty similar in fact to the Spartan system.  Plato later expressed the wish that ""either true and genuine philosophers attain political power or the rulers of states by some dispensation of providence become genuine philosophers.""  The appeal of being the brainy despot, sitting at the top, and ordering everyone around does have appeal, but that's not a good way to run a government.  It is a good way to run a company though.  ;') [end of preamble]

Sparta's system was based on the enslavement of neighboring towns, the development and maintenance of a warrior elite class, brutal training, eugenics, separation of the genders, and, as the narration says, a complete rejection of change.  The disk goes into detail that frankly I wouldn't want young children to listen to, unless I wanted to scare them into obedience -- ""behave, or I'll send you to Sparta!""

That said, even folks with no knowledge whatsoever of ancient Greece should enjoy this disk.

The detail on the disk of the Peloponnesian War (Sparta vs Athens) was particularly well chosen.

The location shots were mostly the scenes being discussed, beginning with the surviving Spartan monument at Thermopylae, and including Sparta itself, Athens, and other Greek locales.  The quality of this production is very high.

Having also watched the PBS Empires Series disk ""The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization"", I'd have to say I much prefer ""The Spartans"".  The brains behind the latter is interviewed for the former, but ""The Greeks"" just doesn't hold the attention like ""The Spartans"", which is well worth the few extra dollars.

This DVD is excellent.  Despite its three hour duration, I watched it twice in two days, all the way through, and revisited specific segments a few more times.  Bettany Hughes teases her way through the whole disk, which has plenty of shots of her walking away in tight jeans, or close ups of her face as she narrates.  This is no reason to buy this, but it certainly is a nice unexpected bonus.

One problem I had may have been related to the cheap Daewoo player I used -- the picture was too wide for the TV screen.  I wound up figuring that out during the second run-through, and set the player to 1/2 resolution, which worked fine on the 27 inch TV.",1072483200,10,2446,4.8647342995169085
1913070,5,B0000C508X,"This is one of the greatest historical documentaries I have ever seen.  Of course, the fact that it details the chronicles of one of my very favorite historical peoples doesn't hurt.
The documentary is narrated and put together by a scholar named Bettany Hughes.  Hughes brings ancient Greece to life by travelling to all the relevant locales in modern day Greece, and some of the topography has not changed hardly at all since the days of the Spartans.
Hughes stands at the cliffs of rejection, wades in the river Evrotas, takes us to Thermopylae, Athens and Sphacteria.  Basically, all of the primary places of prominent interest in Laconian history are visited in this film.  One can almost imagine the Spartans standing in these locales some 2,400 years ago.
During our journey thru Greece, Hughes offers a historical narrative of the brave Spartans, from the mythical times of the Trojan war to the apex of their prestige after the battle of Thermopylae.  Hughes continues on throughout the pages of Greek history to the Peloponnesian War, the eventual defeat of Athens, the decline of Sparta and the ultimate defeat of the Lacedamons on the plains of Leuctria.
Along the way, Hughes points out various aspects of the austere Spartan lifestyle, such as the brutal Agoge, the presence of homosexuality in the Spartan social norms, the conquest of Messenia and subsequent fate of the ""Helot"" class and much more.
This is one of the most thorough documentaries on ancient Greece I have ever seen and is a must for people who even have so much as a passing interest in the mighty Spartans.  It is also a nice ""balancing"" DVD as so many Greek documentaries tend to focus on Athens and more-or-less forget about Sparta.
For those who would like another excellent documentary on Sparta, I would recommend the History Channel's RISE AND FALL OF THE SPARTAN EMPIRE.  To date, I do not believe this DVD is available on www. Amazon.com, however.  The History channel DVD and this PBS documentary complement each other superbly.",1069113600,21,2021,4.906158357771261

1913085,2,B0000C508X,"I have been studying Sparta a long time and I must say that Ms. Hughes, who is usually first rate, goes out on a limb a number of times here. The book which the documentary is roughly based on does likewise. I didn't write down all of my problems with the film, so I'll hit on just a couple. First, I have never heard anyone in any of my grad classes or in any of the books I've read state that there was compulsory homosexuality in Sparta. Everything I've learned points to the Spartans following the rest of the Hellenes in accepting bisexuality and frowning on homosexuality. It would not make sense that they would make it compulsory when a declining population was always a major concern. Also, Spartiates did not have to each slay a helot every year, but it was part of the ""graduation"" process from the agoge. If there were 10,000 Spartiates and they killed a helot every year, the serf population would be exterminated. Helots were not slaves in the proper sense, since they were not privately owned. They were more like the serfs of medieval Europe. That doesn't take away from the fact that they led horrible lives, but so did many slaves in many other polises. I believe that the fact that they were Hellenes and that the Spartans were criticized for taking them only makes the other polises hypocrites. It was alright to put entire poulations of fellow Hellenes to the sword, but God forbid that they were made into slaves. In fact, for a LONG time Athens had NO PROBLEM with having the institution of debt slavery.
The Spartiate did more than fight. He was assigned a plot of land to oversee with some bound helots to work it and the proceeds were to be shared for the common good, since economically Sparta was a communist state.
Hughes hardly mentions at all the democratic element of the Spartan Constitution, which predates Athens' democracy by a number of years. Each year the Apella (assembled voting citizens...male full Spartiates)got together in a field and voted for and elected their Ephors, of whom there were five...one for each of the villages which combined to make Sparta. The Ephors then made the laws, but the POINT is that the citizens decided who they wanted to make their laws for them, it wasn't imposed upon them.
I also got a bit sick of the constant attempts to make the Spartans out as ancient nazis. In many ways the connection does not fit. For one thing, the Spartans by and large were not interested in foreign conquest. They were too insular.
Finally, Sparta did not want the Pelopennesian War. No where did Ms. Hughes mention Athenian aggression at Corcyra and it's subsequent war with Corinth, which drew Sparta in because of it's alliance with the Corinthians. If anything, the Spartans waited too long to try to curb Athenian aggression. Pericles KNEW that Athens would have to fight Sparta sometime, so he provoked a war when it suited him...only it backfired when the plague struck.",1331769600,11,2932,4.684108527131783

1913087,5,B0000C508X,"""The Spartans"" is one of those rare documentaries that works as a dramatic guided tour of Greek culture and civilization. Classical historian Bettany Hughes does an impressive job of telling the story of The Spartans from their origins, their triumph at Thermopylae against the invading Persians, wars with Athens, dominating Greek city-state through their eventual downfall. Hughes rivals Michael Wood and John Romer as personal tour guide who takes us to Greek locations and museums sharing her passion for the subject. Hughes also hosted the documentaries ""When the Moors Ruled Europe"" and ""Helen of Troy"" and was a contributor to the 2007 movie ""300"" which told the story of the Spartans at Thermopylae. The program is divided into three, one-hour episodes, each more dramatic and enthralling than the preceding episode. This series is not to be missed and should be essential viewing in any high school or college course on the Greeks...",1289692800,,942,5.203947368421052
1913088,4,B0000C508X,"I bought this video about the Spartans to get a tad more back ground informaiton on the Spartans because of the fairly bad information that had been recived from various sources, such as the entertainment movie ""300"".  I am very happy with this video.

My first comments are on the video quality itself.  This video fits my large screen TV and the picture quality is very sharp.  This PBS dvd avoids some of the other problems of DVDs where the picture quality really starts to degrade.  There is a point where Bettany Hughes is on a boat and they are in the area of Athens.  The ocean is a brilliant blue and the picture quality is second to none.  You almost have a ""tour guide"" feel when watching this video.  Bettany Hughes comes across like a guide who has actually done her homework on the subject.  She takes the rather meger information on the Spartans and manages to make it into over three hours of information.

The video breaks down into three one hour segments.  It's quite good.  The first video in an introduction to Spartan by Bettany and linking it to it's Greek brother, Athens.  Athens is a democracy and it exists to further itself by trade.  Athens is the beginning of western democracy.  Sparta, on the other hand, is a true meritocracy.  All of the people from Sparta - if they are citizens - enjoy a good lifestyle.  Bettany does an excellent job of telling people how Sparta is settled.  This is actually the indirect seeds of Sparta's doom.  The Greek tribes that inhabit the area of Sparta are enslaved by the Spartans and the enslavement of these Greeks always is a source of displeasure for other Greeks.  Bettany then explains the founding of the area of Sparta.  Then the first hours ends with a narrative on the Battle of Thermopylae.  That is the high point of Sparta.

The second video deals with the day to day living of the Spartans.  Bettany then tells about the sexual habits of the Spartans but gives a disclamer that the information is controversal.  Also, unlike Athens, there are few buildings or much of anything to mark Sparta.  This is because the Spartans were a sports minded people.  Bettany admires the life the Spartan women live; it's the best of any women in the early Western World.  Also, she says the Spartans just didn't spend that much time inside because their life was divided up into training for the military, engaged in sports, or relaxing with their comrades.  The Helots were responsible for the work and work was not a Spartan concern.  The slavery issue is never completely settled and things start to fracture after an earthquake and slave revolt.  Athens is sent away least dangerous democratic ideas are given to the people.  This incident eventually degrades into the Peloponnesian war and is the subject of the last chapter.

The Peloponnesian war is like all wars.  This war is nearly as fatal to Sparta as it eventually proves fatal to Athens.  Initially Athens wins the first part of the war after a group of Spartans surrender on an island after being beseiged by the Athens solders.  But Lysander takes over as the main Spartan general and the war concludes after the soldiers of Athens are driven out of Sicily and the King of Persia pays for rowers on the Athens fleet.  Bettany does an excellent job of narriation and the viewer is treated to excellent, just excellent videos of the area.

Sparta is actually fatally injured from the Peloponnesian war.  At the time of Thermopylae there were nearly 10,000 Spartan soldiers (only 300 engaged).  At the end there was only about 1,000 Spartan soldiers and Bettany explains why the numbers were so reduced.  Sparta gets into a fight with Thebes, in one battle a Spartan army of 600 Spartans and 1000 allies are destroyed by a force of 6000 Thebians, and this Thebian force liberates the rest of the Helots.  Sparta is reduced to a second class city status.  By the time of the Romans they are reduced to giving ""Disney Like"" tours (Bettany's words) to their Roman overlords.

1913089,3,B0000C508X,"If anything, this presentation of the Spartans has reinforced my understanding of brain research which finds that memory is synthetic, and, while certain facts are undeniable due to the mass of evidence, we create much of what we consider factual.  Some documentaries are up-front about being personal views, and this one would benefit by such a cautionary preface.  To inaccuracies mentioned by other reviewers I would add two lapses in well-known textual sources regarding the Spartans and the Peloponnesian War: the comment about a wail of grief passing along the great walls from the port to the city of Athens after the military disaster in Syracuse has been transposed from Xenophon's report in the Hellenica (2.2.3) which mentions this very demonstration of grief after the final defeat of the Athenians at Aegospotami.  Following that ultimate defeat, Ms. Hughes mentions -- complete with flames in the foreground -- the burning down of the great walls to the accompaniment of the music of flute-girls. The word Xenophon uses is ""kateskapton,"" which means ""demolish, raze to the ground"" -- no fire involved. They were, after all, stone walls.  Xenophon was a 26 year-old and in Athens at the time of these events, so it seems likely that he was giving true reports.  Less serious, but nevertheless confusing, is the reference to the Delphic oracle while at the temple of Athena Pronaia.  (Would it not be more appropriate to be at the temple of Apollo for this, where the Oracle was actually given?  It is just up the hill from the Tholos.)

I was looking for a fresh and accurate presentation of the Spartans to show to my class as a counterweight to 300 -- which they are all clamoring for me to show.  I will probably use this DVD in conjunction with several corrections and words of caution.  I have already used Ms. Hughes' DVD Athens: The Dawn of Democracy and found it quite helpful in dispelling the romantic notions we have come to accept regarding Athens and democracy.  We would do well to keep in mind that a good part of the world regards our American democracy as imperialistic, like democratic Athens.",1262131200,17,2124,4.872222222222222

Otherwise stay away.  Apart from a short scene that dealt with Cinadon's conspiracy in 398 BC, there was virtually nothing of interest here.  It's pablum.",1218153600,4,423,5.378787878787879

7998235,4,B0000C508X,"Ancient societies that were based on military control, like the Spartans were, should be studied over and over again. Why? Because they represented what people should not rely on when they unite to form some sort of government system. Worst still, is the idea that homosexuality was a key ingredient in the Spartan system of government, or glue if you will, which bonded Spartan soldiers together in preparation for mortal combat when the time for war reared its ugly head.

The example you take away from this beautiful video with highly entertaining narration by young Mrs. Bethany Hughes, is that (1) war is about killing, (2) what people believe, they will often defend to the death, and (3) there is no perfect political philosophy, which guarantees each individual an ideal life on planet earth.

Furthermore, the Peloponnesian War, was about the difference between two different ancient political ideologies. At the core of the Athenian ideology we learn from young Mrs. Hughes, their philosophical or political system bordered on democracy. That is, a government where the people rule themselves, i.e. a direct democracy. Something the Spartan regime completely deplored. In contrast, the Spartan system was a government ruled by the Ephors, or the old wise ones, the homoioi, or equals, and the periokoi or foreigners. She also points out clearly that in her estimation and based on fact, that the Spartan system of government was not hopelessly doomed to failure from the outset. And goes on to speculate questionably, that had the system not been grounded in homosexuality perhaps, or such a staunch police/military state, would the Spartans have lasted longer than they did?

Find out more about why it is so vital for all humanity to understand all there is to know about our ancient past and ancestry. Moreover, why such a social lifestyle as homosexuality or lesbianism is dangerous to any surviving nation of people. Implied in  young Mrs. Hughes research is the hidden fact that homosexuality or lesbianism could lead to even more bizarre and transcendental or unearthly sexual behavior, which is almost certainly to cause alarm if not curbed in time.

This video book is for anyone politically or socially interested in learning more about why homosexuality or lesbianism should be consistently scrutinized for its dangers to humanity. Furthermore why police regimes like ancient Sparta's must be avoided at all cost. It is not absolutely ironic, why Adolf Hitler turned to ancient Sparta for his wisdom as a dictator given his ultimate objective.

Buy this important, necessary video, to get a true sense of what a democracy verses a socialist/communist regime was really all about during fifth, and fourth century BCE, as well as, what all this means to humanity today.",1389744000,,2789,5.13215859030837

it is very very insightful",1381968000,,128,5.45
7998237,5,B0000C508X,"As other reviewers have commented Bettany Hughes brings her telling of History to life. Her enthusiasm and presentation are of a very high calibre, but not highbrow. The Spartans and her telling of their lives and culture of these elite warriors is really top notch. On average I re-watch the DVD at least once a year and I never tire of it, for those of you have not seen this DVD, please put this DVD in your must see list.",1379289600,,425,4.325
