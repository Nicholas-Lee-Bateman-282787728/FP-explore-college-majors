5381195,4,B00A3DRV2Y,"In my opinion, this movie was extremely well done. The director chose to let words, pictures, and facial expressions tell the story without adding any commentary, just a few facts that flash on the screen periodically. Are there villians? Certainly. Will you feel disgusted? Yes. In the end, you may find yourself arguing, ""Well, at least these girls are protected here, in the United States we do not exploit our own for entertainment.""

Really?

Think about it.

Masterfully done.",1385078400,,482,5.075949367088608

Ashley, an American model scout for Japanese based Switch Models, revealed in the documentary referring to Nadya, a tall, skinny, flat chested, thirteen-year-old blonde from Serbia, ""They love skinny girls in Japan. And she has a fresh young face. She looks young - almost like a prepubescent girl ... [The modeling] business is obsessed with youth, and especially my business from Japan. You can't be young enough and youth is beautiful, because there's the luminosity. There's something in the skin. There's something innocent. And that's what my eye has been trained to see from Japan; so, I look at beauty and I think of young girls [as] beauty.",1378339200,2,904,6.118110236220472
5381197,4,B00A3DRV2Y,"Girl Model has a low-key style but a shocking story of Nadya a 13-year old Russian girl sent to Japan as an aspiring model and Ashley the American recruiter who trolls the towns of Siberia looking for 'fresh faces'.

Nadya, speaking neither Japanese nor English arrives alone in Tokyo and has to find her way by herself.  She spends weeks going to castings without even money for food.  Her contract, written in English not Russian, says if she gains even a centimeter on her hips she can be fired, it also allows the agency to change the terms unilaterally.

The system is dirty, the girls are promised fame and fortune but most leave without a modeling job and deeply in debt.  Ashley swings wildly from denouncing the system she is a part of to justifying it, to willingly turning a blind eye to what might happen to young teens left alone in a strange country.

The direction is very low-key, we never hear or see the documentary makers, only the subjects.  No outside experts are interviewed, no additional information is provided.

It's an interesting choice but a frustrating one.  I would love to know if the contracts are even legal under Russian or Japanese law.  Or why Japanese immigration issues visas for underage models.  Or if there are any groups trying to reform this.  We get a passing mention that in the U.S. and Europe agencies have set a limit, girls must be at least 16.  Is there any similar effort in Japan?

But I suppose the fact I'm asking these questions means the filmmakers did their job well.

It's worth a watch.",1369958400,8,1546,4.611721611721611
5381198,3,B00A3DRV2Y,"While this web site deems a 3-star rating as negative, that's what I award GIRL MODEL in my recommendation of it.

But you might rate the documentary GIRL MODEL better or worse than I do for the same reason: It depicts the risks the poor take to escape destitution while withholding judgment of or a call to action against those who exploit them.  In GIRL MODEL, it's junior high school-aged girls who are recruited from impoverished Siberia to audition to modeling jobs in Japan.  Modeling agents promise them work in the Land of the Rising Sun but, as the fine print of their contracts spells out, these 13-year olds are on their own for expenses if the agency breaks the promise of awarding those jobs.

Women and children first, especially when it involves suffering.  See GIRL MODEL.",1367280000,2,788,4.7226277372262775
5381199,1,B00A3DRV2Y,"This is not a documentary. This is a film about few different pimps of different nationalities operating in different countries in the name of modeling agencies. Tigran, the real creep who most likely is an Armenian living in Russia, claims to be the owner of modeling agency in Russia.  Ashley a confused, a mentally disturbed psycho freak, a former model??? who never produced any pictures of herself in any magazine shoots, resides in US and claiming to be the recruiter. Then there is the Japanese guy who is the owner of the agency in Japan who actually says that none of these girls will ever get any modeling job. They sell paradise and modeling careers to mainly poor families from impoverished neighborhoods in Siberia and Russia when infact it is nothing but a front for underage prostitution. The grossest part of the film is when Tigran talks about himself and his existence with the other pimp Ashley in a restaurant. It is so disgusting to see these people getting a platform which is offered by the director since it is the director who put that segment in this film, to attempt to convenience others that they are doing all of these in the name of religion and humanity. There is no narration so the director does not even try to explain what is happening at all. The girls get lost in train station. Ashley drops in Japan to visit these girls few weeks after they are in Japan and during that few minutes of visit, Ashely can not even communicate with them since she does not speak Russian while one of the girls has not eaten for few days since she has no money. Gross, gross, gross... These individuals are not identified by their full name or last name since after all they want to protect their privacy from any possible criminal prosecution. Ashley seemed to be very nervous that soon or later she is going to get busted, so she did claim that she is aware of many awful actions and knowing the way that she kept describing herself and her life, I am sure that this director and Ashley are planning another film together with more juicy details for their own pocket books.

There is nothing new here. PBS did a documentary with Front Line called Odessa Girls. If a parent has been living under a rock then watching this documentary will show the creeps who disguise themselves as recruiters who are nothing more than professional pimps. The director could have done more, at least even in the extra section of the DVD but failed to do so and instead gave those disturbing pimps a platform to advertise their beliefs instead of hammering them. That is why this film deserves one star.",1367020800,12,2605,4.612068965517241
5381200,5,B00A3DRV2Y,"It is easy to point the finger at Ashley and say she's horrible. (Which she is.) But her horrible behavior is enabled by her boss Tigran, who is in turn enabled by the industry that prizes/fetishizes the bodies of 13 year old girls. That industry is enabled by consumers who put up with this crap, and countries who don't prosecute/stop the modeling agencies that are employing/scamming children. If Tigran and Ashley were arrested, someone else would step in. If people said ""yuck, I don't want to look like that 13 year old in a dress"" things would start to change.

So yeah, there's a lot that's horrible going on here.. and in many ways most of us have a little bit of responsibility in the chain of blame. Maybe you even have a little more responsibility after you see this film, now that you know what is going on.

Overall this documentary is quite good. How the directors got Ashley to talk as much as she does is a mystery. She even invites the cameras to her sad ""glass house"" which is an interesting metaphor. Tigran, the uber-creep, even talks to the cameras a couple times. The filmmakers must have worked very hard to gain trust. I have a strong suspicion that Tigran's agency acts as a feeder for prostitution and strippers. I don't think the intention is to put these girls in magazines at all. Possibly that would have been difficult to film or prove.",1363910400,10,1368,4.556910569105691
5381201,4,B00A3DRV2Y,"I'm writing this review just after viewing this documentary and my suspicions have been confirmed.

The obsession in European cultures with youth is directly related to the inherent pedophilia-inspired desire to have sex with and sexualize young girls (children) by creating a business front that allows them to do so under the anonymity of  a legitimate enterprise.

Tigran, the adult male who acts as an ""agent"" for two of the 13 year old ""models"" tells on himself when he said, ""At 13, she has something that most people rarely have, and that's called dignity. A 13-year-old will never go with a rich man for money. She's much happier with the $100,000 that she earned than with this $3 she gets with this rich man for doing nothing but spreading her legs.""

Say what? Why is he comparing the behavior of a child with the behavior of a woman? with this almost dreamy-like look on his face, as though a girl (woman, in his sick mind) was a better ""woman"" than a real one. My money says not only is he exploiting them, he has probably raped more than a few--and that is part of his fringe benefits along with taking the lion's share of their earnings

I had a suspicion earlier in the film when this same male posed with a sign in front of cameras with the words ""666"" printed on them, an attempt at humor but a strong sign that something was amiss.

I would recommend this movie to all ""stage mothers"" who put their children in the dubious hands of modeling and acting agents and agencies. Be aware that the odds are high that after all is said and done you have delivered your innocent child into the hands of sociopaths, molesters, and pedophiles.",1362528000,12,1651,4.542087542087542
5381202,4,B00A3DRV2Y,"I am interested in the subject of modeling, so was very jazzed to watch this documentary.  What was disturbing is how this particular modeling ""agency"" took girls from Siberia, telling them how they could make big money, to Tokyo for ""modeling"" sessions.  They put these particular dirt-poor girls (who didn't speak any English or Japanese) up in a crappy apartment in Tokyo, took them to go-sees, did not bother to take good pictures of the girls, and didn't seem to give them any traveling expense money (so they could eat).  There were no modeling lessons or training.  The girls had no control over the pictures that were taken of them, were not informed where they would show up, and sometimes were not even paid for them.  The girls were unable to ask basic questions of the people around them.  At the end of their contracts, the modeling agency informs them that they didn't make any money, and in fact they are in debt to the modeling agency for the expenses of their apartment and airfare, sending the girls home over $2,000 US in debt.

What you come to see is that the modeling agency exploits these girls, not even trying to get them modeling jobs, but to make money for the agency by keeping them in debt.  The biggest villian is the former model who is now a recruiter for the agency.  She knows how the girls will be fleeced, yet she continues to work for the agency to finance her lifestyle.  It's very sickening to watch.

The reason I'm giving this documentary only a Like rating is that the pacing is very slow, and there is little to no background music, and no voiceovers.  Sometimes it just gets boring.  I realize you can only do so much with true stories, but I would've liked more information about Nadya (one of the models), about how long she was there, how was she living alone in Tokyo at 13-years-old, what her daily life was like, and more details about the unscrupulous modeling agency.",1361404800,18,1919,4.576023391812866

8546457,3,B00A3DRV2Y,"I wasn't expecting this film to be so wretched. Most people have a perception of the modelling industry as inherently flawed, between unrealistic role models and sexualized exploitation. This film follows a model scout, who seems like an icy psychopath to do what she does.

This sketchy agency preys on young hopeful women, from impoverished areas in Russia. The ones with more potential are selected for a modelling contract in Japan. The dynamics of this are inherently abusive. The model who is profiled in most of this film is 13 years old ! She travels alone to Japan, where she does not speak the language, to share a microscopic apartment with another teenaged Russian hopeful. Who knows what the parents were told about this arrangement ? Their contracts are extremely strict - if they gain more than 1 cm in any of their measurements they will be sent home. This is 3/8"" ! These are girls who have not exited puberty, some have barely ENTERED puberty. They are thrown into go sees for different agencies - without a translator or even a proper lookbook. There is some confusion about about their advance. The second girl's family is better off and she has a credit card, while the first model seems to not have even been given the promised allowance by the agency, and mentions not having food for several days. They seem to have been set up to fail, with impossible stakes.

Ultimately, both these models fail to secure enough work, and both are sent home in considerable debt. This debt is probably how this scummy agency continues to do what it does. It may not actually be in the business of finding models - rather it generates debt and extracts it from the already impoverished parents.

Meanwhile, the scout has a very fancy modernist house in Conneticut, which she claims she hates and feels unsafe in. She has piles of snapshots of the girls she exploits, usually headless, only their body parts. There is some mention of her time working as a model, which she also claimed to hate. No photos document her alleged career. It is unclear how she can continue this cycle of overt exploitation, working for slimy creeps who own the dubious agencies. She claims she knows that within this industry that there are girls who become prostitutes, under the guise of modelling, and that this is thinly disguised.

Probably the best part of this film is when she has a uterine fibroid and teratoma cyst removed. Teratomas are like little monsters - full of hair, skin, teeth and bone tissue, which develop from germ cells. She shares the photos of hers. This is the best thing she has to offer.",1466553600,2,2602,4.712087912087912

8546459,5,B00A3DRV2Y,"Strange pathways can lead you to this film documentary about impoverished russian teenage girls auditioning for modeling jobs in Japan.  A slimy and swarthy exmilitary Armenian operates the recruiting agency in places like Siberia.  Tigran is his name and his assistant from the U.S. is called Ashley, herself a former teen model, burnt out and lonely but clearly happy to earn well and buy herself a house in Connecticut and travel through Russia and Japan recruiting these girls.  It beats nine to five job, she says, looking strung out on the Transsiberian railway.

What is shocking is how eager the poor parents are for their daughters to strike it rich and help rebuild or expand the family home, perhaps to buy a car or get more to eat.  They are pathetic in their naivite.  These girls arrive by train and then plane to Tokyo without anyone even meeting them and they are only thirteen years old!  Then follows a month or so of hanging aeound a room with double bunkbede with no money unless they bring some themselves.  This is about getting food to eat!

The documentary is a slow one in showing Nadya of Novosibirsk trying hard at thirteen to deal with Tokyo and its people and language and subways with almost zero English.  Alone!  Another russian girl arrives, Madlen, thirteen with a credit card and parents with money.

They become chums and realize they are getting ripped off.  They were promised work and $8000 but instead each leaves owing the Switch Agency about $2,200!  Madlen overeats chocolates and gains two centimeters on her hips to get fired and sent home.

One begins slowly to realize how evil the entire industry is.  The Japanese men want prepubescent skinny foreign girls as their fantasy objects, preferably blonde with big round eyes.  Why so?  Who knows!? It is a fetish and the agencies capitalize on it.

I would guess that the grand majority are wicked and perhaps just a front for prostitution.

Strange interlude about recruiter Ashley's plastic infant dolls and then her fibroids and cyst operation which appeared bumpy like a pregnancy.  What a weird woman she seems to be.

Creepy film.  I found it in the library while hunting in the catalog under Siberian Diaries.

Yes it is a story about Siberia and the horrible fate that communism has left its russian citizens.  People are basically selling their children to fake fashion agencies and landing up in human trafficking.

this scout/ex-model ashley person is mentally-ill and i wish i were a psychiatrist to treat her for free [if she is cure-able!]

the japanese agent is a sicko too, as well as the tigran-man.

the case of nadya vall is a perfect example of what happens to these pretty girls from the poor countries.

i wish everyone would be required to watch this film in order to understand the hell that is created by the fashion industry.

ashley gives me the creeps more than anyone, she is pure evil; it is as if she wants to hurt all these girls the way she got hurt. sick sick SICK!

the film 'lilya 4ever' is another one i recommend that talks about similar issues.

next i would like to think what i can personally do in order to somehow not be part of this horrible system [not buy fashion magazines?]",1385164800,2,1071,4.2772277227722775
