419821,4,6302066875,"Talented director / screenwriter Budd Boetticher brought to life the violent story of infamous gangster, Jack ""Legs"" Diamond in this often overlooked, but high quality addition to the crime genre. The filming of this production in harsh black and white tones adds further realism to this gritty tale of illegal activities, shadowy ambushes and executions !
Ray Danton is superb in the lead role as the treacherous and manipulative small time hoodlum who arrive's in New York and immediately sets about muscling in on everyone elses racket to build his own empire. A very young Warren Oates plays Danton's sickly brother, Eddie Diamond, in a low key yet interesting performance. Simon Oakland is the aggressive and determined Lt. Moody hounding Diamond every step of the way...and Robert Lowerey portrays Prohibition kingpin Arnold Rothstein.
Boetticher's direction is fluid and crisp and he keeps this film noir gem tightly paced and holding your interest all the way through. Although Danton was never a major star, he simply shines in this film and his oily nature and good looks made him the perfect choice to play ""the clay pidgeon"" of the Prohibition era underworld.
An engaging and stimulating film that will be enjoyed by fans of film noir underworld drama !
FOOTNOTE: Diamond was known as ""the clay pidgeon"" of the underworld because of his repeated ability to survive assassination attempts...until he was betrayed and caught asleep one night and shot 6 times in the head ! And Diamond was not actually nicknamed ""Legs"" because of his dancing abilities, but rather for his habit on running out on his friends !",978393600,28,1619,5.044776119402985

419838,5,6302066875,"The late Ray Danton may not have been a great actor but he did a fine job in this one. He is completely believable as the slick, amoral Prohibition era gangster. The direction of the film is excellent, especially the numerous gun battles. Elaine Stewart and Warren Oates are great in supporting roles. Look for a very young Dyan Cannon as one of the ""molls"".  Frank DeKova (Chief Wild Eagle from F Troop,no less) plays a Luciano type mob kingpin. Highly recommended!",1426723200,,466,4.682926829268292
419839,5,6302066875,"Saw this when I was young  and remembered it fondly. So good to have on DVD. Ray Danton was great in the starring role ( before he moved behind the cameras to greater success in Hollywood). Karen Steele was great moll--gorgeous and somehow innocent of knowledge of Legs' fearsome reputation. Plus the small part of Warren Oates as the sickly brother. When you've seen a movie 50 years ago and still remember it fondly--it belongs in your collection. Recommended to all fans of the old-time gangsters movies, filmed as the genre had lot of its  box office appeal (it was part of a double feature when I first saw it. Highly recommended.",1425340800,3,635,4.660714285714286

419857,2,6302066875,"Highly disappointing gangster story misfires on its slow pacing, and stiff acting. Ray Danton's performance is a letdown in his lackluster lead role as Legs Diamond.  Doesn't come close to the Rod Steiger version of Al Capone, made around the same time.

419863,5,6302066875,"The movie is great with Ray Danton turning in what could be the role of his career.  Along with a new 'bit' actress Dyan Cannon as his 'moll' and B-movie stalwart Warren Oates, it's a very realistic 'gangster' film that doesn't glorify the lifestyle such as later 'gangster' films.  If you liked CAPONE with Ben Gazzara, you'll like this!
But - like all Warner Bros. Archives releases, if you have a DVD/VCR combo unit, the disc formatting probably won't allow it to be played on your machine.  There are countless Warner Bros. Archives films I would love to own, but what's the good of owning them unless I can play them.  One of these days, I'll buy another player just for the Warner issues, but until then, make sure your player will accept the formatting on these discs.  As far as I can tell, Warner Bros. Archives is the only company that has this problem.  And why they 'did it' to us is beyond me.  Are you listening Warner Bros.??",1315353600,12,940,4.4941176470588236

419865,3,6302066875,"Since Little Caesar and Al Capone, gangster films by this time had a plot formula to follow: poor thief follows plan to take over the mob and replace the boss, climbs the ladder to the top only to meet an end of raining bullets. Ray Danton is well cast in the leading part but character actor Jesse White is hard to believe as a tough mafia leader and Elaine Stewart wears almost a disguise to play Arnold Rothstein's tough moll. Good performances help a cliched story, but it's been filmed before too often.",1217548800,2,508,4.473118279569892

7820449,5,6302066875,"When that Budd Boetticher Westerns box set came out many years ago, my eyeballs devoured it like the hungry film-loving peepers that they are, and I got to talking about the Director with a guy that knew a lot more about movies than almost anyone else I know.

After informing me about every nook and cranny of Boetticher's contributions to the Western genre (and he talks fast so I'm hanging on every bit of info that I can process), he followed up by stating ""what you need to see is The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond"". So I filed it away in the think-bank of my sputtering brain.

Time marched onand still no sign ofwait! the Warner Brothers Archive Collection has a Remastered print available! Amazon has it! It's in the shopping cart! It's at my doorstep! I'm watching it! I watched it!

Ahem. I can't remember seeing Ray Danton (who plays Legs here) before, but this was a great performance; understated, confident, and hard-as nails. Nowadays we call them sociopaths, but back in the Depression era they were probably just good old fashioned cold-hearted, selfish, and determined-to-win heavies.

Danton brings the quiet, menacing intensity so well that the other actors suffer for it, though they all turn in genuine performances. A young fresh-faced Warren Oates (who also appeared in The Untouchables around this time) plays Legs' sickly brother; though this 1960 role, while adequate, doesn't do much to forecast the talented acting that was to come from the man.

Nonetheless, this is a fast-paced, well-written and efficiently-directed crime-drama that delivers just what the title promises. The set design is top-notch and pleases the eye even moreso as the tension builds, Legs Diamond preparing to dazzle us with the pressure-cooker of his pent-up hostility.

I am glad to have seen it and to finally have it in my collection to view again and again.",1501632000,,1866,4.907936507936508
