4985290,1,B006FSRSFQ,"Like all Woody Allen movies, this one is endless, pointless talking about irrelevant boring stuff.  I know Allen has his fans, but they must all be people with an ability to listen to actors talk...and talk...and talk.  That's all that happens in a Woody Allen movie.  Continuous non-stop banter, seasoned with a lot of complaining and angst.",1343347200,,342,4.964912280701754

4985293,4,B006FSRSFQ,"In 1977, Woody Allen abandoned slapstick comedy for something greater and more personal. He gave us ""Annie Hall,"" arguably the most quotable comedy of all time. It won four Oscars: Best Actress for Diane Keaton, Best Director for Allen, Best Picture for Charles Joffe, and Best Screenplay for Allen and Marshall Brickman.

If you've ever roared at a Larry David series (and considering David's work on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and ""Seinfeld,"" you probably have), you owe a tip of your hat to the Woodster.

For the film's 35th anniversary, ""Annie Hall"" has been re-released on Blu-ray. Allen plays Alvy Singer, a twice-divorced stand-up comedian who is ever so slightly Jewish and rather fond of New York. Scratch that: this movie is entirely about Alvy's Jewishness and his adoration of all things New York, including the grime and crime. A stand-in for Allen, the character is self-deprecating and funny. He sums up his paradoxical life with the Groucho Marx line, ""I'd never want to belong to a club that would have me as a member.""

That contradiction drives Alvy through his one-year relationship with Annie (Keaton), a nave WASP from Wisconsin trying to make it in the Big Apple. The movie opens with Alvy lamenting his lost love, and then meanders back through their time together to track how the romance died. Things start out fine; Annie picks Alvy up after a tennis match (where we get the famous ""Lah-de-dah"" line) and for a short time they are blissfully happy. But all too soon Alvy starts screwing up his own happiness, buying Annie books on death and insisting she go to therapy, which he pays for, setting a high bar for obnoxious, controlling boyfriends everywhere. After all, Alvy's been in therapy for 15 years and look how well adjusted he is.

Things really come to a boil after Alvy encourages Annie to sing, which is a talent completely outside of Alvy's control. This leads to Annie's biggest betrayal. She listens to a hotshot music executive (Paul Simon, in one of a gazillion cameos with famous and soon-to-be-famous folks, including Christopher Walken, Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Goldblum, and Truman Capote) and heads to California, where Alvy is as out-of-place as pickled herring in Jello.

""Annie Hall"" proves Allen's creative genius. Allen perpetually breaks the fourth wall to address the audience. He uses animation (Snow White!), double-exposure (the famous scene where Annie's ""ghost"" leaves her body during sex), subtitles (to show the characters' unspoken thoughts), and other clever cinematic devices to great effect. ""Annie Hall"" also clicks as a comedy even though it was originally a murder mystery.

And yet, unless you're a die-hard Woody Allen fan, this is not a must-own release. Why? Well, for one, the Blu-ray upgrade does absolutely nothing for this movie. It still looks grainy and dated, and there is virtually no music to benefit from the improved technology. The ""Annie Hall"" Blu-ray also contains one pathetic extra: the original theatrical trailer. To borrow another of the movie's famous lines: ""A relationship, I think, is like a shark. It has to constantly move forward or it dies. And I think what we got on our hands is a dead shark."" (Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Blu-ray $24.99)  Review originally published on MyDVDInsider.com.",1328659200,9,3299,5.064456721915286

4985300,3,B006FSRSFQ,"I'm sorry, but was I supposed to find this movie charming? I'm very new to the Woody Allen movies and everyone was talking about how great this film was, but his relationship with Annie Hall felt very forced and awkward much like Tommy Wiseau in 'The Room' Allen's character, Alvy Singer is our hero, the one we're supposed to cheer for, but he practically whines and complains throughout the whole movie and gives us reasons why Annie shouldn't be with him. There's really not too much story, just Alvy talking to the audience about his past and his relationships and why they never worked out. I'm almost tempted to watch a few more Woody Allen movies just to see if they have the same basic storyline. Maybe someday, I'll give this a re-watch, but for right now, I probably wouldn't recommend ANNIE HALL!!!",1404604800,,809,4.664335664335664
4985301,5,B006FSRSFQ,Just up there as one of my all time favorite films.  What else can I say!  Definitely on my desert island list!,1404172800,2,111,4.0
4985302,5,B006FSRSFQ,"I love this move more with every viewing.  The Blu ray transfer is good and brings new life to an old, but great film.  The Blu-ray lacks any real special features, but for the price, what can you really expect.",1400025600,2,211,4.25
4985303,1,B006FSRSFQ,"I just received a brand new Annie Hall Blu Ray Movie. I put it into my panasonic Blu Ray Player and the picture qaulity was poor. The picture quality throughout the blu ray movie went from ""fair in sharpness"" to ""bad in sharpness"". I believe this was poorly made and the company who manufactures this should start over again. My wife and I both retired just saw this on t.v. and it looked great!!  The Blu Ray is very poor quality.",1394668800,3,431,4.320987654320987
4985304,4,B006FSRSFQ,"I bought this movie for my husband for a stocking stuffer at Christmas since he had asked for several movies.  Again, I am not a Woody Allen fan so to me this movie is okay.  My husband loves the movie so I purchased it for him.",1391472000,,228,3.9347826086956523
4985305,5,B006FSRSFQ,"Still the best. Annie Hall might be my favorite movie, and the Blu Ray transfer is terrific, keeping the film grain while the picture looks sharper than ever. One of the funniest and saddest movies about relationships ever made, Annie Hall is a timeless and endlessly inventive classic.

I wish Woody would allow for some features, but the film speaks for itself so who needs behind the scenes docs or commentary when you can just watch Annie Hall?",1386288000,,448,4.743589743589744
4985306,5,B006FSRSFQ,"Annie Hall.... my all time favorite Woody Allen film, favorite comedy/drama, wow! and now on blu-ray.  However, I don't think blu ray particularly enhanced the film quality. And now that I have seen it 8 or 9 times, it doesn't quite have the same freshness of seeing it that first two or three times way back when....  But Diane Keaton's Annie is a classic. Woody Allen's script is filled with absolutely great moments. And the ending still grabs me... all about the eggs!",1376092800,,472,4.674698795180723
4985307,4,B006FSRSFQ,"Wonderful film, solid transfer but as usual for Woody not much in the way of special features.  It is a good upgrade on the dvd and don't be fooled by the fuzzy picture in the cheap looking menu, that does not represent the quality of the film.",1375747200,,244,4.191489361702128
4985308,5,B006FSRSFQ,"To put it bluntly, this is my favorite Woody Allen film as well as my favorite comedy of all time so I would have a hard time being terribly objective as I believe the film holds up well today. By this stage of Allen's career he had become more sophisticated in his comedy and less reliant of the slapstick, as good as it was, of his earlier films. Diane Keaton returns as a romantic foil for Allen once again. Allen plays Alvy Singer, a comedy writer and two time loser at marriage. His relationship with Keaton's waspish Annie allows Allen to make this film personal and almost autobiographical in nature.

Woody Allen and Diane Keaton are great together. Chasing lobsters and spiders. Keaton also started a whole new trend in women's clothing that lasted years. This great film has lost little even if the mores of the times are different. Allen is at the top of his game as a director and actor and Diane Keaton shows what a great actress she is...as well as a pretty good singer. Keep your eyes peeled for small roles for Christopher Walken, Shelley Duvall, Sigourney Weaver, Truman Capote and Jeff Goldblum.

The Blu ray version, while a step up from the DVD isn't going to wow the viewer like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but it is very good and has very little video noise. As noted above in ""Sleeper"" the film has plenty of course grain, even during daylight scenes. The transfer is in 1080p and has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. The audio comes from a mono master and is converted to a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 (Mono). This is a dialog driven movie, so little should be expected from surrounds in any case. The audio is clear and concise. Woody's not big on special features, so don't look for any.",1372982400,5,1701,4.51948051948052
4985309,1,B006FSRSFQ,I remember seeing this in 77 when it came out and being a 7 year old kid at the time this was not the movie for me haha needless to say I fell asleep and woke up when it was over even my mom thought it was lame anyway woody does not make good movies anyway ok I said my piece,1366848000,3,275,3.5245901639344264
4985310,5,B006FSRSFQ,"This is one of the few comedy films to win the 'Best Picture of the Year' Oscar (in 1977). And it deserved it!  Simply put, it is the funniest film i have ever seen! Woody Allen wrote a fantastic script, full of riotious one-liners and side-splitting situations that he and Annie Hall get themselves into. And the insights into the interpersonal relationships that we all go through with the opposite sex are very touching and revealing. I cannot recommend this film enough! The best! (We all need the eggs!).",1366243200,,509,4.719101123595506
4985311,4,B006FSRSFQ,"I Always loved this movie, and this version is the best looking yet. The only letdown is the lack of any extras. The picture is nicely restored, without to much sacrifice on it's original look. The sound has been kept to a minimum, but With a Woody Allen movie it's all about the dialogue anyway, and that's crystal clear.",1363910400,,322,4.47457627118644
4985312,5,B006FSRSFQ,"One of my favorites finally went Blu-ray!! Woody Allen and Diane Keaton shine even brighter when seen in 1080p! Blu-ray just seems to make a  mega classic even more enjoyable and give it a facelift of sorts. In my perception, the film looks and feels newer and the poignant performances just POP!! with more sizzle. This film is so full of one on one exchanges and closeups that 1080 just enhances the experience. A part of the 70s were exquisitely preserved in a 93 minute segment called Annie Hall!!!
Do yourself a favor and watch this film on Blu-ray! In this day and era of CGI overkill, it's SO refreshing to revisit an old friend like Annie Hall and get a sense of the RAW, HONEST, GET TO THE POINT HUMOR of Woody Allen!!",1355097600,3,727,4.425373134328358
4985313,3,B006FSRSFQ,"I collect the winners of the ""Best Picture"" category and was surprised to see this as a winner. The film was different but not exciting and nor did it draw me under suspense. The humor in the film was typical of Woody Allen but to me really dry. If you are a Woody Allen fan, you will enjoy this transfer onto Blu-ray as it was cleanly done.",1349049600,2,341,4.104477611940299
4985314,5,B006FSRSFQ,"Considering the age of the film (Annie Hall) etc. I think this movie looks and sounds as good on blu-ray as can possibly be expected given the source. The movie itself is of course, a Woody Allen classic in all of the expected ways. It's smart, funny, intellectual and like many (not all) of his other films, I love it. Just because it's on blu-ray however, don't expect miracles. It's still an old film with a mono audio track source.",1343606400,4,435,4.45

8497164,3,B006FSRSFQ,"The mid 70's were actually a pretty depressing era in America. Big heavy American cars, polyester suits, no more Beatles or Progressive Rock (just horrible disco), no computers, 50 thousand Americans dead in a war we lost, and Jimmy Carter was President.  It's inevitable some of that would rub off of on this movie.  It has very mid-70ish humor, kind of a light sex farce with some funny gags and social satire. It also has hip people snorting cocaine.  I don't know how this got labeled PG.",1500422400,,492,4.632183908045977
8497165,5,B006FSRSFQ,"Woody Allen at his best: baring his insecurities and shortcomings, muttering and mumbling his way through a string of sharp, witty statements, experimenting with film techniques, admiring the lost landscape of 1970s New York and, still, finding time for a rich, colorful portrayal of a years-long romance. Allen and Diane Keaton really make the film work, their rapport is so smooth, easy and genuine. We want to see them tough it out together, because their good times are so pure and true, but we know that fresh infatuation has a relatively short shelf life and the characters' essential differences make a longer, more serious relationship impossible. We see it all in a string of short snapshots, an expert mix of vital moments that anyone who's been through such a whirlwind will no doubt recognize. Those early, sunny memories you won't forget and the later, stormier ones you can't. Funny and poignant, with a dash of playful fourth-wall recognizance to keep us on our toes, it expertly churns all sorts of universal emotions.",1499644800,,1034,5.017441860465116
