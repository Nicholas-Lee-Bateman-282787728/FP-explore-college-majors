616676,5,6303286542,"Just CANNOT go wrong with Aerosmith tunes. Best news in R&R History was that Tyler and Perry realized the rest of the BAND deserved better treatment than their egos. Truly 1 plus 1 could only find the Square Root of One equals ""1""",1454544000,,230,4.372093023255814

616787,5,6303286542,Really great music by Aerosmith. Same old good rock music with quite an emphasis on ballad. I really like it. It's their best yet.,1421020800,,130,4.458333333333333

616896,5,6303286542,Not a bad song on here if you are an Aerosmith fan... These are all tunes from the later more recent years of their career like Pump and Permanent Vacation not the classic Toys in the Attic and Rocks era... Rock on!,1388793600,,215,4.142857142857143
616897,3,6303286542,I'm a lover of this type of music. I get the MP3 downloads which hasn't been the best with Amazon's Downloading device this past 4 months which is why I knocked a star off.,1388016000,,172,4.088235294117647
616899,5,6303286542,"Can't go wrong with Aerosmith!  All the hit songs on one CD is awesome.  Buy,  load onto play list and enjoy some great classic songs.",1383696000,,134,4.28
616900,3,6303286542,"A fair number of hits are here, but it's still lacking some essential tracks. I bought it mostly because it was on sale. Certainly would never pay full price for this lackluster collection.",1382745600,,189,4.757575757575758
616940,5,6303286542,Aerosmith is the greatest rock and roll group of all time and this album highlights some of their biggest hits all in one place.  Amazing album!,1362873600,,144,4.538461538461538

617039,4,6303286542,"I grew up listening to Aerosmith and a lot of other Rock groups. This is a good set of tunes from a hard rockin, hard partyin band. For me there is no ""old"" or ""new"" Aerosmith. It's Aerosmith. Toys in the Attic is also a good one. Still remember my Dad's face when he came home to ""Big 10 Inch"" rockin out of his console stereo (that was a stereo system with AM/FM, a turntable, and usually a reel to reel tape player in a fancy wood cabinet with 2 speakers built in.) Give it a shot & open your heart for some great rock! ;)",1337040000,,525,3.9622641509433962

617120,4,6303286542,"Like the title suggests some of Aerosmith's biggest known revival hits are on this release.  I think what should be on any compilation is subjective, but I think the point of this release was to gather a lot of hits in one place.  And that they did.

Big Ones is still a good release, and Big Fun to listen to.",1224979200,,310,4.133333333333334
617121,5,6303286542,"Forget the negative reviews. This is a great collection of Aerosmith hits, post the ""Sweet Emotion"" era. Buy it and replace the ones you don't like with ""Sweet Emotions"" or ""Walk this Way"" or whatever.",1224806400,,201,4.771428571428571
617257,5,6303286542,"Definitely one of the best videos to come out of promotion for the band. If it's a greatest hit, it's on this video. Highly recommended! Videos include, (not in order):

From PERMANENT VACATION:

Dude Looks Like A Lady Angel Rag Doll

From PUMP: Love in an Elevator Janie's Got a Gun What it Takes The Other Side

From GET A GRIP: Eat the Rich Living on the Edge Cryin' Amazing Crazy

From BIG ONES:

Walk on Water Blind Man Deuces Are Wild

If many of these happen to be your favorite Aerosmith tunes, then this is the video for you. It's awesome. Sit back, relax and look. :-D",1097193600,3,578,4.296296296296297
617518,4,6303286542,"The videos on this tape are: Deuces are Wild, Livin on the Edge, Eat the Rich, Amazing, Cryin, Crazy, Rag Doll, Angel, What it Takes, Love in an Elevator, Janies got a Gun, The Other Side, and Dude looks like a Lady.
There is also a few minutes intro to each video showing the making of the video, or some promotional spots they have done in other countries, or an ad for Rock the Vote, and some short interview footage.
It is high quality, and is about 90 minutes long. I cannot wait for their next VHS to be released... would love to have Pink, Jaded, and all their other 'new' stuff on tape as well. Highly recommended.",1009929600,9,622,4.279661016949152
617522,5,6303286542,"I LOVED THIS VIDEO. I HAD JUST SEEN THEIR CONCERT IN ALPINE VALLEY WISCONSIN AND WANTED MORE. THIS WAS IT. THEIR VIDEOS ARE AMAZING. IT KEPT ME GLUED TO MY SEAT, WHICH IS A HARD THING TO DO!",996883200,4,190,4.026315789473684
617888,4,6303286542,It shows you all the great videos plus a bunch of behind the scenes stuff too.  Not to mention some skin from the Deamon of Screamin,953942400,6,132,4.076923076923077
617890,5,6303286542,"I think this is one of the best music videos I've ever seen. It has their best from '87-'93. Here's the lowdown for people who don't know what's here: 3 hits from ""Permanent Vacation"", 4 hits from  ""Pump"", 5 hits from ""Get A Grip"", plus a special video  made for the collection for ""Deuces Are Wild"" from ""Beavis  & Butthead Experience"" CD. I can't wait 'til Geffen gets off their  a** and puts this collection on DVD. The downside to the collection is it  don't have the (bar)video version of ""What It Takes"", ""Walk  On Water"", or ""Blind Man"" with Pamela Anderson playing the  nurse.",952387200,12,584,4.504761904761905

7842573,5,6303286542,"One of my favorite compilations.  All cuts are from CDs produced after they became clean and sober.  In my opinion, their most solid work.",1504483200,,138,4.708333333333333
