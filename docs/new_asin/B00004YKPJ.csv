1375126,5,B00004YKPJ,"this film is straight to the point.  It shows a true case-study of an incident involving DUI and the effects it caused, both for the family of the victim and the offender himself.

very emotional, very effective in sending the ""don't drink and drive"" message.

** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED **",1245196800,2,285,4.775510204081633
1375127,5,B00004YKPJ,This was a documentary on impaired driving and the consequences of it from the perspective of the perpetrator and the victim's family. It was extremely well done and is invaluable in the work I do with alcoholics.,1237507200,3,213,4.783783783783784
1375128,4,B00004YKPJ,"In this MTV-like cautionary DVD, the tale of Steve Leslie is told.  At the age of 23, he drank and used methamphetamine, chose to drive, led police on a car chase that led to him rear ending the car of Jeremy Turner, a 19 year old.  He killed Turner instantly by causing the car to explode.  Leslie was given a 17 year minimum sentence for his crimes of murder, felony DUI, felony resisting arrest, and felony evading arrest. Russell Turner, Jeremy's Dad, shares his tragedy by talking to high schools about the dangers of drinking and driving, and interviewing Steve Leslie about his actions in jail.  Instead of telling the story in a straightforward way, the DVD shows many images of Jeremy growing up, and of children and teenagers in general at different times in their lives. It intersperses these images with pictures of collisions and people covered in blood that have been in DUI accidents. The editing is crisp, but sometimes confusing as to what tale is really being told.  Visually this short film is stunning, but the different images shown make it sometimes difficult to concentrate on the real story of what happened to Jeremy Turner. Also interspersed in the segments on the Turner family and Steve Leslie is the funeral of a young adult named Brooks.  We are not introduced to his family in any way other than what we see in the emergency room of his family and of what his FAther says about him in Brooks's funeral.  This was confusing, but did add to the emotional impact of the DVD in showing the devastation a DUI can cause to the remaining family members. My only problem with this DVD is I would have liked to have known more about this family above, and I would have liked more information on Jeremy Turner before his death.
 The impact of what Steven Leslie did will forever alter the lives of the Turner family.  However, this DVD can possibly make someone choose to make a low risk choice; and not drink and drive.  This DVD is great to show to groups who have to go to treatment due to having a DUI, because it can show them what might have been.  A felony DUI is devastating to the offenders family, as well as the victims family.  Steve Leslie has not regularly interacted with his wife or son for years, and that is a direct consequence of his felony DUI conviction.",1223942400,14,2297,4.548543689320389
1375129,4,B00004YKPJ,"DUI-Dead in 5 Seconds is a very efficient way of educating teens in the real risks of driving under the influence. Our HS SADD (Students Against Destructive Decisions) used it at an assembly during our ""Every 15 Minutes"" event and students watched it intently. We followed it with the testimony of a well-loved substitute teacher whose son was killed by a drunk driver. I wouldn't say the video stands alone without some follow-up ""processing"" discussion, but no one piece on this issue ever could. It's also affordable when compared to the MADD videos that cost $200 and are formatted only for an extra-wide screen display.",1211068800,31,624,4.9523809523809526

1375133,5,B00004YKPJ,This movie was excellent although it is only 18 minutes long it packs a lot of punch in those 18 minutes. It tells the story of a student who was killed and the consequences of what happens afterward. I would recommend this to all health teachers and all students to watch this movie.

1375179,5,B00004YKPJ,I found it to be very emotional and factual about the choice of driving drunk. To think of the waste of all of the young men and to think of the 2 year old who will never really have a father-I am impressed with the kindness of the fathers in the videos and the fact they shared such a painful part of their lives with others to try to change young people.,1426291200,,356,3.9583333333333335

1375200,5,B00004YKPJ,"I purchased this for my sixteen year old son, who is fixing to get his driver's license.  I was surprised at how graphic it was, but for him it was a reality check.  I really liked the perspectives from the victim's family members and the drunk driver.  My son teared up as he watched the victim's mother, watching her son die.  We also discussed how the drunk driver made a choice, and how that one decision changed his life forever - with jail, and with living with the fact that he had killed someone and devastated an entire family.  As parents we often tell our children these things, but they too often tune us out.  This DVD was a great reminder that I am sure I will use again - with my son, and my nieces.",1372809600,,714,4.213235294117647

1375215,5,B00004YKPJ,"DUI Dead in 5 Seconds"" held the attention of my teen and adult substance addiction therapy groups in which most if not all got a knot in their throats to hold their tears. This DVD is most definitely for the substance user/abuser audiences. The film moves fast scene to scene with sirens, blood, dead bodies, helicopters, ambulances, police officers, jail, doctors, nurses, all are which my clients are familiar with from their experiences. The DVD shows what can happen from an offender perspective if you drink, drive, and kill someone and a victim perspective of losing someone that was killed by a drunk driver. Both the offender and victim can benefit from this film because the offender witnesses how their decision to drink and drive affects so many people landing them in jail but also the victim witnesses the regret the offender has to live with the rest of his life. This DVD is extremely powerful for all audiences to prevent anyone from drinking (or using drugs) and driving.",1364083200,2,988,4.85207100591716

I highly recommend this video to anyone wanting to really show an emotional video that will leave you knowing that drinking and driving devastates!

Instructor note:  There are some religious overtones and several mentions about God and Christianity.  As a public school teacher, this is a walk on eggshells kind of thing.  I just preface the video by letting the students know that the video will be mentioning religion and remind them that each person has the right believe what they want to and to deal with their pain and that by showing the video I am not promoting any one religion but am merely trying to portray the message about the dangers of drinking and driving.

1375262,5,B00004YKPJ,"This DVD should be required viewing by all kids 7th grade up.  Young people, me too, are just not aware of the awful consequences of drinking.  It can rip the life out of you in mere moments.

Without sounding like I'm shaking a finger at anyone, the most important thing we can do with our young people now, is not argue about the drinking age, or any number of other so-called precautions we need to take, but rather put emphasis on early education and the ramifications of over drinking.

Get this DVD and have your child invite all his/her friends over for an important, life changing, education that may save their life some day.

7927284,1,B00004YKPJ,The fact this video is shown in STATE defensive driving courses is disgusting. It constantly talks about Jesus Christ and how he died for your sins. Spends most of the time on this. The beginning was painful enough with the very jarring trying to be edgy soundtrack. It says the video is from 2007 but I think it's more from 1982 or something. Don't buy it because you'll probably see it in some dumb state sanctioned defensive driving course... even online! Ugh...,1521331200,,465,4.682926829268292
