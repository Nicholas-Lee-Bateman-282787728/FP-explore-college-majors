8440272,2,B004SVIF0Y,This  workout is nothing like the flirty girl fitness dvd that I have watched on their website. I bought this for my daughter and I to work out to and I was highly disappointed. I would not even consider it as a workout and it was very boring and I there is not a workout dvd or program that I have ever called boring.,1364947200,,318,3.96875
8440273,5,B004SVIF0Y,"I will start this by saying that I'm not normally a fan of Flirty Girl fitness videos. I have tried most of them and hated them. This is one of the shining exceptions. This a great toning video. Easy to follow (and I am an overweight , outta shape, beginner). I am able to keep up, the moves are very clearly shown, and I do feel it in the muscles. There are three women in the video, for each set of exercises there is a variation shown by each woman for beginer, intermediate, and advanced. Right now I follow the woman doing the modified beginer versions and I like knowing that when my fitness level progresses I have an example on how to make the moves more challenging so that I will get many more months (possible years) out of this DVD.

You will need to pick up resistance bands to do this video. It doesn't tell you this on the box. So if you do buy this video, go pick up resistance bands as well.",1362960000,3,908,4.159090909090909
