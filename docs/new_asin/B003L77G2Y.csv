4137770,5,B003L77G2Y,"This show has held our attention since the first show.  Never a bad show.  Love all the characters(and actors)....and everything is so plausible and possible.  Some of the theories have been out there for over 40 years and would not surprise if some of the shows written had more information than we are really aware of that the governments have hidden from all of us. Yeah, definitely a sci-fi Fringe admirer.....for all of you.....just sit back and enjoy the experience.",1286841600,11,472,4.875
4137771,5,B003L77G2Y,"Fringe has just the right actors playing just the right parts with an incredibly compelling story line.  Owning Fringe on DVD is very rewarding as you get to go back and see little, but meaningful things you missed the first time through.  I will buy every Fringe Season...not a boring moment to be had.",1286841600,7,303,4.592592592592593

4138117,2,B003L77G2Y,"Not the best FRINGE.

The first season was amazing.  But as soon as they started hopping casually back & forth between universes - they destroyed the time-space continuum of the series itself.

Season 1 is WONDERFUL.  Interesting side note - FRINGE was taken from the British show TORCHWOOD, and I always tell people (anyone who will listen) that if they like FRINGE, then they'll probably like TORCHWOOD.  :-)",1478217600,,410,4.970588235294118
4138118,5,B003L77G2Y,"This season has some of my favorite Fringe episodes, and shows off some of the most talented acting by Anna Torv, Jasika Nicole, John Noble, and Seth Gabel as they each portray (2) distinct, yet similar characters in the different universes. There's several storylines building this entire season, and the romantic relationship between Peter and Olivia does not overshadow the potential destruction of one or both universes.",1477785600,,424,5.343283582089552

4138698,5,B003L77G2Y,"I thought all 5 seasons were great. Enjoy the story line, acting and probability of something impossible to be possible. The close knit family of everyone, and Dr. Bishop's insane behavior. Acting was very well done.",1469923200,,216,5.027777777777778
4138699,4,B003L77G2Y,"Fringe has great episodes and it has and ridiculous threads.  Some of their tangents are beyond belief even for this program.

That said, for some reason it's a series we keep returning to in hopes that at some moment it's going to get back on track.

The acting, especially that from John Noble who plays Dr. Walter Bishop, is so far above what can normally be seen on television programming.",1469750400,,393,4.585714285714285

4138701,5,B003L77G2Y,"Seasons Two and Three do a lot of exploring around the idea that people aren't who you think they are. Also, that who you are depends - a lot - on what has happened to you. A lot of what's literally true in Fringe is metaphorically true in our universe. What I love about this show is that it is every bit as silly as it is deep. Walter, that beautiful trippy savant, captures this perfectly several times an episode.

Another thing I love about this show is that Olivia, Astrid, and Nina are so smart and capable, and they talk about things other than men. And did I mention the writing? It is excellent.

Season Three, especially, poignantly fills in back story (which, although it doesn't always square with what we were led to believe in previous seasons, makes so much sense) while managing to move the plot forward organically.

Keep watching.",1469664000,,849,4.5359477124183005

Better than any CSI formulaic procedural, that keeps you on your toes with it's creative sci-fi crime investigations. Oh, it doesn't stop there..........throw in romance
and that's Fringe. Believe me, my review doesn't do it justice.........you WILL get hooked, trust me on that. You too will become a Fringle (that's
what they call the fans). By the way, see if you can spot the Observer.",1458000000,,658,5.101851851851852

Yes, it's ""fringe science"" but they keep it just in the ""I guess I can believe that"" range. They are also very consistent. That helps with the believability as well.",1454976000,,281,4.423076923076923

In a world where TV action/sifi/Dramas are a thing of the past Fringe stands out as a TV show that will hold its place for many years to come.

4141618,5,B003L77G2Y,Great story overall - Opportunities for creative stories are well embraced and execution is great. At times the advertising for the various car companies takes the focus away dragging your attention to the range of an electric vehicle or that a certain car has voice recognition and phone built in.

4142117,3,B003L77G2Y,"Season 1 and 2 is quite great but it started getting boring or making no sense after season 3 because most of the stories got too emotional. In an episod, the supposedly wise man at bowling alley says the fate of the entire universe is decided upon an emotional choice of a single person (Peter) who never visited his father in 17 years. Come on, seriously? Who is he? God? In another episod, an emotional attachment of a grieving old couple started make a vortex between the parallel universe.

4142335,4,B003L77G2Y,"""Fringe"" is an amazing show.  That being said, I can understand why it was brought to a close too soon.  ""Fringe"" is a show that was never meant to be binge-watched. By doing so, you see all of the weaknesses of the show. The plot points that skate the absurd so narrowly and episodes that were obviously just made as filler.

If you can get past that nonsense (which is easier if you space the viewings apart), you are left with a wonderful sci-fi vehicle with excellent actors that turn in some great performances and actually brings forth a vibrant storyline.  I feel that ""Fringe's"" greatest problem during it's actual run on the FOX Network was that they didn't know how to promote it.  I initially passed on it because it seemed like a poor man's ""X-Files"".  I'm glad I have the chance to see what I've missed and if you love deep-set, slightly off the wall, science fiction, you will too.",1448409600,,895,4.493827160493828

Even if they had wrapped up the underlying story, they should have just gone back to the 'monster of the week' genre, like the 'X-Files'. Maybe with the return of the 'X-Files', and twin Peaks, someone could find their way toward making a reboot of THIS series. At least they ended it well, rather than the crash and burn that was 'Lost'.

Season 3 is arguably the best of the series (although Season 4 is just as good), but the ""dual-Earth"" story comes to full flower, with ""Fauxlivia"" taking our heroine's place (and job) on our earth.  There are several amazing stand-alone episodes in this season -- ""Apt 3B"" is a huge fan favorite -- but the final episode is as good as any you'll see on television past, present or future.

If you're introducing a friend or family member to the show, I recommend starting with Season 2, then following up with Seasons 3 and 4, which is what I'm doing for my daughter and her husband.  Definitely ""the gift that keeps on giving""!",1442880000,,738,4.6976744186046515

4143652,5,B003L77G2Y,"This is the second time I've watched this series. The first was when it was first aired on TV. I did not catch every episode back then. Here on Amazon, I can see every moment of the show and it comes across as a completely different story because I had tried to fill in the blanks I missed. And now I see I was not nearly as imaginative as the writers. As such I feel like I'm watching for the first time -- and that's not something that happens with many TV shows, even when I've never seen them before because so many series rehash the same characters, jokes and story lines. The concept for Fringe is out there and it delivers surprises constantly. The world they created is really thought through and makes sense, even when something off the wall happens, which is not a bad thing to have underpinning fiction that's kind of out there on the Fringe as it were. As an audience member, I get pulled in by the really brilliant characters plus the strangeness and mystery. They've crafted it to where I am exactly at the point of understanding that the characters are. When they discover something and are shocked or whatever, so am I.

We went back and watched the first two seasons and then faithfully watched the show all the way to its bittersweet end. Now that it is over, this is our second time watching through the series from the beginning!

4144064,5,B003L77G2Y,"This series is utterly addictive!  The actors are top notch and perfectly cast and the story lines have no limit in outrageousness and imagination  Just when you think that you're ""bored"" with the utterly unbelievability of the show, you get hooked again when a little corner is turned.  I was thrilled when Jared Harris returned playing a character 180 degrees from his role in ""Mad Men""( one you truly love to
""despise."")  Anna Torv as the ""heroine"" is perfect and you never woul believe that her natural dialect is English.  As a side note, I'm dismayed that three television series with strong female leading roles ( Alias, Covert Affairs, Fringe) have ended too quickly (as compared to ""24"" which lasted 10 seasons I believe!)  hmmmmmmm :-o
Adding on to this perfect ensemble cast is John Noble (""Dr. Bishop""), who is so much fun to watch!  He is a veteran of the theater, highly versatile and we are privileged to be able to watch his character evolve. Additionally, Joshua Jackson plays Peter Bishop as a complex and highly intelligent yet empathetic and sometimes transparent individual in a totally believable manner.  There is so much great talent on this show that you just have to watch it, but be warned, it will grow on you.
I admit that I see some ""Alias"" themes bleeding through on this show, but after all, they were both ""birthed"" by the same uber talented
man:  JJ Abrams! :)
I could go on and on about how much I LOVE THIS SHOW but it would take my allocated time away from watching the rest of Fringe!",1439424000,,1522,4.628252788104089

4144443,5,B003L77G2Y,"This is my all-time favorite sci-fi tv series! A combination of Criminal Minds and X-files! I love it! Sci-fi who-done-it, murder mysteries, where ""black-box"" scientific experiments and an alternate, parallel universe (with their own versions of the ""black-box"" experiments) collide to produce bizarre, but
 scientifically explainable murders and deaths happen. The murders are often the result of experiments gone wrong or which are in the process of refinement so that some extra ability can be created and used without fatal side effects. It is the responsibility of the fringe team to figure out what happened and hunt down the experimenter(s).
In this season the Fringe Team in this universe find the devastating results of Walter's experiments have had upon the alternate universe and they understand why the Fringe Team in the alternate universe think this universe is at war at war with them. Walternet (Walter's name for his alter-self), is waging his own war against the our universe.  Peter seems to be the key to everything.",1437436800,2,1036,5.234939759036145

When the show was on TV, I couldn't watch them because of time conflicts and I didn't have Netflix or any other means to watch this.  Now as I am watching the episodes, I wonder why it had to end after the fifth season.  I went through up to the third season so far and the episodes were great.

Watching all the seasons, one after the other, is turning out to be quite engaging. The continuity from episode to episode is remarkable. The show doesn't miss a beat. IMO one of the best shows ever conceived. The actors all do an excellent job in their roles. They are all uniquely gifted and interpret their roles with wit, charm, and elegance. The on-set chemistry is superb. Honestly... there are times when Walter's off-the-wall quirkiness makes me laugh as hard as I ever have. Olivia is easy to love and feel empathy for. Astrid is endearing, and Peter's strength of character seems to tie all the disparate energies together. The strong themes of unrequited love and camaraderie is very real and emotional. Hated to see this series end. Loved it!",1430956800,,889,4.973154362416107

4145283,5,B003L77G2Y,"Fringe lost me early into Season 2 when it's overarching mythology began to overwhelm my ability to watch it on a weekly basis. Leonard Nimoy's passing prompted a desire to explore any of his work which might still be fresh to me, which led me back to Fringe. While I might wish still for a higher ratio of 'monster of the week' to mythology episodes (the same creative decision which I think doomed X-Files and is dooming Person of Interest, albeit in slightly different genres), there is no arguing how compelling Fringe's overarching main story is...and in binge-digestible season box sets, where the demands of life cannot force a viewer to miss essential weekly installments, I am rediscovering how excellent--and almost unique for network episodic television--this was/is.

Both leads--Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson--find ways to be something more than the obvious with their characters, even if the writing (in the name of sustaining suspense or setting up a cliffhanger) asks them to behave less intelligently or logically than we've been led to believe they are. The best writing is saved for supporting characters--agency director Philip Broyles and damaged genius Walter Bishop, especially--and both performers are up to the challenges presented them repeatedly throughout Season 3. John Noble's Walter may be a top five all-time television character.

Where Fringe might go from the end-of-season 3 reveal remains a mystery to me (remember I gave up on it years ago in real time)--but I have already ordered Season 4, in hope it manages to pay off on the compelling, emotion-straining promise of Season 3.

4146069,5,B003L77G2Y,"h dear... I'm running out of superlatives to describe Fringe. You've certainly got to keep your wits about you for series three with storylines ricocheting between the `real' and `alternate' universes. The multi-layered plots twist and turn maintaining a consistent tension and intrigue while the underlying mythology is gradually developed, giving weight and depth to the whole narrative. There are a few relatively pointless stand-alone episodes which do nothing to further the ongoing story but I think these can be forgiven. The final episode is astonishingly original and more than a little confusing but with a totally unforeseen (well, by us, anyway) outcome and is peppered with references from earlier episodes (the opera house, the bridge, Peter's silver half dollar...). We even watched the last two episodes twice to make sure we'd got the right end of all of the various sticks.

The cast are brilliant but the real star is the writing - it is equally clever if it has been fully storyboarded boarded out from the start or if it has been made up as they go a long. We're just glad that, contrary to the popular trend, this show wasn't axed early-on by short sighted and unimaginative network bean counters. Let's hope that season four, rumoured to be the last, tidies up all of the loose ends and has a satisfactory conclusion.",1420934400,,1340,4.955555555555556

4146072,5,B003L77G2Y,"This series had the chance to be in my top three all time Sci-Fi series.  I absolutely loved it for the first three seasons.  I finally broke down and bought all five seasons and I have to admit that I am slightly disappointed.  I get the impression that the writers could never decide which story line to follow.  They would start in a direction and before it could be fully developed they would drop it.  That is really a shame because I feel that any of them could well have made this into the best Sci-Fi series of all time.  I liked each and every direction the series went and felt a little let down every time it was dropped.  Over all, I still liked this series a lot better than almost all others.  There are just too many things that I want to know how they would have been developed.  My favorite character?  Walter.  I want a character like this in some other series.

P.S. - My favorite Sci-Fi series?  Firefly!  Is there really a question?",1420588800,,953,4.3107344632768365

4146618,5,B003L77G2Y,"Excellent series. I've commented on this series in the past. It was very well produced with the actors giving top performances. It is very believable and convincing science fiction/mystery. It was a great tribute of the X-Files, with quite a few references to that seminal series embedded within a number of episodes. Even the characterization is similar.
As for the third season, Fringe really dove head first into the myth arc, of sorts, concerning the other universe. Its move to Canada to continue on from its stellar Season 1 in NYC and the North Eastern US, did not allow one to notice the move, unless one really dove into the very minute details.
I am enjoying a revisiting of this series to see if I can fill some of the holes and answer questions I developed on various items. So far, I am not disappointed and have a better understanding of the main storyline and the various standalone episodes (although the standalone episodes still touched upon the main story of the parallel universe in some fashion and the relationships of the characters).
I wholeheartedly recommend fans of this genre to watch each episode with an open mind. And, for everyone else, one will have to set aside any commonly held notions of true science and realize this series is about science out on the fringe of our reality... the name of the series. It is enjoyable in its own world and is quite entertaining.",1416441600,,1398,4.733606557377049

4146905,5,B003L77G2Y,"I am Loving it even though I have watched it once already on TV. Having Prime Instant Video without any commercials makes TV series watching a pleasure. When you watch the series again for the second time without any interruptions you tend to appreciate the show even better. This season 3 centered around Olivia & Fauxilivia as coined by Walter. The Olivia from alternate universe switches with Olivia of this universe hence the name ""Fauxilivia"".

In this season Olivia is distraught after her return, knowing about Peter's relationship with Fauxilivia. The acting done by Anna Torv as Olivia Dunham is excellent. She has portrayed both Olivia & Fauxilivia superbly. Fauxilivia has an easier smile than Olivia of *this* universe, and jokes more often around her colleagues, and is much more playful. She's often seen fidgeting while talking and her posture is less stiff and more relaxed. The technical accuracy by the directors and makeup artists in making subtle but slow changes in characters of both Olivia & Fauxilivia are commendable.

Overall Season 3 does not disappoint you deserving worthy five stars! - Now onto season 4 :)",1412726400,2,1136,5.06951871657754

A friend turned me onto this show. When asked, have you seen Fringe? and my reply was no, haven't heard of it... they nearly fell out of their seat. I didn't watch television so I really didn't think I was missing anything. I am now binge watching this show with my husband. Now, everyday after my husband returns from work we sit down to watch a show with or after dinner. We have been doing this for a while now and we haven't tired of it yet. I just don't see that happening. If you like science fiction and action along with detective shows this has it all. The romance doesn't pick up until far into the show which I like because you get to the point of thinking, it's never going to happen but the timing couldn't be better.

Walter Bishop, Olivia Dunham, and Peter Bishop are three of the best characters ever written into a sci-fi series. It is amazing how they create subtle sifferences in their personality to add the slightest difference in their alternate counterparts. It is intelligent entertainment for those of us that that grew up wondering if the truth is out there while watching the X-Files. Season three is the my favorite out of the fove seasons. It blends the strong sci-fi story with some scary creature arcs that makes for perfect viewing.

4147467,4,B003L77G2Y,"S'okay.  Some DVDs are in my collection and I will watch them again such as the Terminator or Matrix series.  I doubt I'll watch Fringe again (except that Jasika Nicole is sooo cute in it).

The problem with it is contrasted by 2 old scifi series.  Star Trek consulted some aircraft engineers and it wrote up a rather complete technology and future science.  Buck Rogers allowed each episode writer to change things at random.  Fringe should have written up rules for time travel at least as a back story.  To give another contrast consider Poul Anderson's Time Patrol stories in the early 1950s.  In ""Delenda Est"" 2 Time Patrollers on leave decide to go to a party hearty era.  One is a Dutch-Indonesian ethnic from Venus in the 23rd century and one is an American from the 1950s. He proposes that New York in 1955 is the greatest party city ""if you know the right phone numbers and I know all of them.""  But when they arrive, another city is there.  They are arrested and they try every language they know.  Greek gets a response and the next day a socialite who knows Greek interrogates them.  This is a history without the Roman Empire.  One of the Time Patrollers brainstorming with the other states that time is self healing and only a major change can have an effect.  Murdering someone named Roosevelt in medieval Holland would not keep a genetically identical FDR from becoming president, for instance.

There are always contradictions in a time travel story but the creator has to make some decisions:  If a time traveler changes something that eliminates his own future, does he find it paradoxically impossible, does he disappear or does he become an orphan from an alternate history, does he have a memory or a partial memory of his alternate histories, does a time wave roll forward with the new history so the time travel establishment has some sort of second chance? Stuff like that.  Decisions have to be made.  No such decisions were made for Fringe and different episodes jarringly clashed.

Say, I've read a number of Poul Anderson books but just that one Time Patrol story.  I'll check Amazon for the novels and collections of that and read more of a Sinatra-era cool cat battling through histories.  Let's see:

4147621,4,B003L77G2Y,"I started watching the fourth season of Fringe with my husband, who had been watching it from the beginning.  The characters are as complex as the storyline.  Each season seems to have a different focus.  This one focused on the relationship between Peter and Olivia as it introduced the idea of alternate universes.  It continues to be a cautionary tale along the lines of _Frankestein_ and _The Island of Dr. Moreau_ on the human and moral limitiations that should be placed in science by showing the unintended consequences of experiments that Dr. Walter Bishop and Dr. William Bell initiate in their youth and see grow fruit thirty years later.",1405728000,,648,4.91743119266055

4147626,4,B003L77G2Y,I must admit it is addictive. The characters are interesting and the story creative.  I do wonder sometimes if the writers of the show actually know where they are headed. Some story arcs are started and then wiped out without explanation.  When there are FOUR different universes/ timelines that is easy to do but not very satisfying.,1405555200,,335,4.859649122807017

4147729,4,B003L77G2Y,Great outlet for the SciFi in me... Definitely SciFi and on the fringe but thought provoking. This season has lots of drama which my not so SciFi wife enjoyed. Walter is wonderfully witfull when where with whom he is.,1403740800,,217,4.589743589743589
4147730,5,B003L77G2Y,"This series is all about unravelling the mysteries of this world and a parallel universe. On ""the other side"" (as they call it) things are the same, but subtlety different. For instance, the characters on ""the other side"" are the same as far as  appearance and voice. However, their character and  roles are very different. For instance, the major evil villain of the show lives in the alternate world. In this world, he is a bumbling but brilliant scientist who has a neurological disorder. Unlike other shows which slowly unravel a mystery, this one keeps you caring about both the characters and the solution.",1403395200,,612,4.875

Meanwhile, our favorite characters struggle to resolve increasingly bizarre cases, deal with an infiltrator in their midst, and hopefully save our universe from impending destruction.

I have watched the entire series without switching to another program - not at one time of course - but whenever I wanted to watch TV and sometimes when I should have been doing other things.

There was so much to the story line that missing just one live TV showing seem to confuse me with the next time I watched.

As is often the case, after being introduced to the series, watching the few episodes on science channel, they stopped airing it.  I decided to start at the beginning, and ordered Season One, and was hooked.  The good thing about Fringe, is that you really don't have to watch every single episode and feel like you are missing something. While the characters are constant, each episode is unique onto itself. That being said, there are important events that happen and you won't want to miss an episode.

It draws you in without losing you in its twist and turns. Human relationship challenges that we can all relate to. Interpersonal dilemmas whether they be between father and child, family, or romantic in nature are relatable. Thought provoking.

Its like poof, they love each other so much their getting married. Eew! Really? Why? Very Disappointed. Their marriage dominates every aspect of this show from episode to episode, it interferes with every investigation they are on to such a point; It's like, ""Get a Motel""! It's just not convincing to me at all and Ruined it. Thank god their are other ""good Sci-Fi writers out there out-shinning JJ Abrams! See YA! Terrible! It's like...

4148109,3,B003L77G2Y,Could have been done briefly and done well. To base an entire show around it is boring. Great actors and set.,1398124800,,109,4.238095238095238

4148191,5,B003L77G2Y,"Walter really makes this show.

Played by the same actor that was cast in Lord of the Rings as Denethor, Walter is the consummate mad scientist, who delivers his lines and works his alchemy, witchcraft, and ""fringe"" science in such a way that this show can really push the boundaries of suspension of disbelief. Walter's just a kick to watch in nearly every scene he's in.

The first couple of seasons were a bit rough in parts, but Fringe definitely hit its stride by Season 3. The characters have all settled well into their roles; the relationships between them are dynamic, but also strong; and the characters are all remarkably well cast and played by unusually gifted actors. Throw in classic elements of sci-fi, drama, and mystery, and you've got a fabulous episodic-television concoction that should appeal to fans of shows like Warehouse 13, Bones, and the X-Files. Among others.",1397952000,,888,4.913333333333333

4148236,5,B003L77G2Y,"Fringe Season Three is arguable the strongest of the five, although in reality this is mostly based on having the bulk of the alternate universe episodes.

The ultimate ending is mind-bending and far-reaching, if a little unsatisfying.

Great characters are really the core of this show, and the complexity of these relationships in the Alice-in-Wonderland version of reality never fails to delight.",1396224000,,399,5.419354838709677
4148237,5,B003L77G2Y,"While some viewers might loose interest due to the complex nature of this series, those who stay with it to the end are rewarded with an outstanding and highly imaginative story.  So many of the Fringe story lines that at first appear to lead down the proverbial rabbit-hole, are, by the final season, all neatly woven together where everything is explained; we even learn who really was responsible for the events that Walter thinks were cause by him alone.  What makes this series so compelling is the outstanding acting - especially that of John Noble.  His portrayal of the ""not-all-there"" Walter Bishop and the alternate Walter is amazing to behold.  Why he was never nominated for an Emmy I will never understand other than to say that for some shortsighted reason Hollywood has never given science fiction its due and has summarily dismissed any acting in that genre out-of-hand.  In the final episode of season 5, there is a scene between Walter and Peter that is as poignant as any one might find in a reel of Oscar winning performances.  There are so few programs on television that take the risk of telling a story so ""out-of-the-box"" - it is refreshing to see one make it all the way to the finish line and to do it so well.  I highly recommend the entire series.",1396224000,,1275,4.64
4148238,5,B003L77G2Y,Fringe really hits it's stride in season 3. This season features less of the one and done style stories and builds on the continuing story arcs from start to finish. The story is gripping and you have see what happens next.  Really great watch!,1395964800,,244,4.545454545454546

After I subscribed to Amazon Prime and discovered I could watch Fringe whenever it suited me (no commercials!), I became addicted.  I love cliff-hangers but can't resist moving right on to the next episode.  The series keeps me on the edge of my seat, especially because I've become very up-close-and-personal with the characters.  Casting is excellent.  Just wish Olivia didn't wear a permanent frown.  Was a challenge to keep track of the characters when the doubles appeared from the parallel universe.  Tip:  Take notice of his/her environment (twin towers are or aren't present), different style of dress, personalities.

You will like, perhaps love the three main characters: there's Walter, the wacked out scientist that just can't seem to get out of the 1960's; Then there's a beautiful but modest blond named Olivia, she works for the Fringe division of the FBI, and meet her double from another universe, a red headed Olivia. Then the hero, Peter Walter's son, or is he, and he's not, but just maybe he is. Watch it from season 1-5.

I have no idea why the last 2 reviews for this got rejected.  The emails stated that I have to use at least 20 words, which I did on the last 2 tries.  They recommend ""the ideal length 75 to 500 words.""  I, on the other hand prefer short reviews.  I don't want to read War & Peace.  If reviews are too long I just give up on researching the product and don't buy it.

When I read a review I just want to know how the person liked the product, was it good quality, any problems with the seller or delivery, etc.  Well, lets see if this passes the test.  If it doesn't I doubt I'll be entering any reviews in the future.",1392076800,,790,3.9430379746835444

The science behind Fringe is fun, although I gave 5 star, the writers attributed Quantum Entanglement to Einstein when the right name would have been Erwin Schrdinger, In fact Einstein was against ""Quantum Physics"" he called it ""Spooky Science."" He wasted 10 years trying to disprove Schrdinger. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen worked together to disprove Quantum Physics what is known as EPR Paradox. Einstein most famous words against QP was ""God does not play with dice!""

4148907,5,B003L77G2Y,I have never been so emotionally invested in a show before. The relationship between Olivia and Peter has tremendous depth and just the right balance of sexual tension and very human fears. Every time they make a breakthrough something happens to one of them to force them to almost start over. The writing is intelligent and the twists and turns kept me intrigued. In the end the cases and crises they face have become subservient to the struggle between this man and woman and with themselves. I love it.,1390089600,,506,4.696629213483146

This was a good season, but no the best of the five.  In this season the show alternates between the two universes with 'our' Olivia trapped in the other universe and the other Olivia in our universe gathering intel on the Fringe team.

4148975,5,B003L77G2Y,"I recently purchased a Kindle Fire HDX ( Another pleasant suprise ) expecting to use it mostly for reading my magazine subscriptions, books and using it to view my photos.

I decided to see what videos were available to watch on my Kindle.  After some searching, I decided to view the 1st episode of Fringe.  I remembered that I was going to watch it when it first came out on TV, but missed viewing it and all the following episodes.  At that time, I thought Fringe was a show where each episode was a stand alone episode, where the only thing common between episodes were the main characters.

I watched the 1st episode and decided it was good enought to watch several more.  I loved how the plot line carried through from show to show, but every now and then there were a few stand alone episodes that were more or less independant from the main plot line.  But even some of these earlier stand alone episodes were later incorporated into the main plot line of the show during it last year.

Now that I have watched all the Fringe episodes, I am impressed at how the writers kept the main plot line on track. If you think you would like a show with parallel universes, some time travel, and main characters you actually like, give Fringe a chance.  I am glad that I did.

4149016,3,B003L77G2Y,"Ok, lets recap.  I loved the first season of Fringe & while the second season started out rough I still enjoyed most of it, but I thought the switch of Olivia with Fauxlivia at the end was really stupid, much like the replacement of Charlie with a shapeshifter at the start of season 2.  But while that was stupid, at least there were a few good episodes in between the bad ones.  Here though Im not even going to bother reviewing the first 9 episodes.  The only one I could actually enjoy was episode 49 (6955 KHZ) & even that wasn't perfect, just easier to consider as part of my canon.  True, these episodes do have great ideas (like The Plateaus monster of the week, a man who can trigger a deadly chain of events, or the beautiful horror of Marionette) & some memorable moments (Walter inheriting Massive Dynamic, the twist in Amber 31422 and Broyles coming face to face with his own corpse in Entrada being my favorites) but the Olivia switch really drags them down, especially in our universe.  Fauxlivia keeping the others from gaining any information reminded me too much of X-Files Failure Is The Only Option policy.  While that was frustrating at times it was plausible for the most part, but here on Fringe its never plausible & always frustrating.  A pity, as the idea of switching episodes between universes is a very good idea that deserved better execution.  However, the series gets good again with Firefly, so heres a review of that episode & all the ones after it, with synopsizes from the booklet.

53.  The Firefly:  Our universe.  Did saving Peter throw the universe off balance?  Walter learns the answer from an Observer and a former rock god who lost his son soon after Walter gained his.  A

54.  Reciprocity:  Our universe.  The team comes closer to operating Walternates doomsday machine when they discover its possible power source: Peter.  A

55.  Concentrate And Ask Again:  Our universe.  A killer marks a scientists birthday by sending him a rag doll booby-trapped with a bone dissolving power.  A

56. Immortality:  The parallel universe.  Fauxlivia and the team investigate the creepy case of bugs that devour humans from the inside out.  Meh, didn't really do anything for me, though Ive seen worse.  C+

57.  6B:  Our universe.  AS Olivia and Peter rebuild their relationship, a grieving widow tries to reclaim hers  even if it creates a universe devouring vortex.  A+

58.  Subject 13:  Our universe.  1985: Walter strives to return a distraught and suspicious Peter to the parallel universe  using little Olivia as a guide.  It seems like the episodes that take place in the 80s are always are excellent.  Lets hope we see more of this in season 4.  I cant get enough of the 80s style opening.  A+

59.  OS:  Our universe.  Gravity-defying thieves share a connection to a scientist who, like Walter, tampered with the laws of nature in hope of saving his son.  A

60.  Stowaway:  Our universe.  Bell, inhabiting Olivias body, has 48 hours to find a new host.  Meanwhile, a woman gifted with eternal life wants only to die.  A+

61.  Bloodline:  The parallel universe.  Kidnappers inject mother-to-be Fauxlivia with drugs to hasten the development of her fetus.  Why?  And whos behind the abduction?  Who cares?  If a universe has to be destroyed, I hope its this one.  I don't particularly like the stories set here it seems.  C

62.  Lysergic Acid Diethylamide:  Our universe.  In a last-ditch effort to save Olivia, Wlter, Peter and (accidentally) Broyles take LSD and things get trippy.  Theres a reason this episode has a commentary; it is quite possibly the best episode of the season.  A+

63.  6:02 AM EST:  The parallel universe.  Walternate activates the Doomsday machine.  Our universe.  Walter realizes that only his son  or perhaps God  can save both worlds.  A

64.  The Last Sam Weiss: Our universe.  As chaos erupts, Olivia and Sam search for a key, Walter flies a kite, and Peter takes a mysterious cab ride to New York.  A

65.  The Day We Died:  Our universe.  I need Walter.  In 2026, Peter seeks the help of the most reviled man in the world  now behind bars  to save humankind.  An excellent season finale.  A+

Since exactly half the episodes were A/A+ I will give this season 3 stars.  For all its faults the show does return to form, and the cliffhanger ending was much better than the last seasons and ensures I will be watching season 4 (which I already have).  I just hope the show doesnt drop in quality again.",1389312000,,4477,4.667529107373868
4149017,3,B003L77G2Y,"Every time the characters in this series start to show any sign of emotional growth the writers take the show in a whole new direction putting all the characters back to square one. Very frustrating, just when you are getting to know Walter they stunt his growth again by making him forget everything like his son or where he hid the plans. I know the show is a silly si-fi but it does have its moments, like when Walter gets lost in China town and breaks down crying at a bus stop. The actors are capable of much more. And what is up with the observers? First we are told they are emotionless then their having a party and harassing women? Whose nerd fantasy is that? This show had potential to bad the writers didn't know what to do with it.",1389312000,,743,4.276595744680851

Well done and a strong story arc helps propell this show into all kind of stories and situations. The actors are well cast and I do not believe anyone else could play any of the characters. If you have not tried this show you really have to start at the begining with season one. Intelligent show and yet a lot of fun.

4149097,5,B003L77G2Y,"Fringe is rich science fiction, examining the relationships between thought and feeling, the future and the past, science and religion, free will and determinism, even good and evil.  The acting is good enough for character development and the characters are enjoyable.  There is a dualism that allows us to think about how the choices we make influence who we will become.  Fringe is a series worth watching so far (Season III).",1388707200,,429,5.014084507042254

4149183,4,B003L77G2Y,"I've just reached the end of the third season of Fringe, after watching the first two, courtesy of Amazon's Prime video.  It's fine entertainment if you like the genre.  The Amazon presentation has given me the opportunity, both to re-experience some series dramatic high points, as well as to fill in the gaps of the underlying thread dealing with parallel universes, and understand how the deepest storyline, the Watchers, developed.

I like science fiction/fantasy, so years ago, I began watching Fringe soon after the series began.  Although intrigued by some of the individual stories, I found some of the characters (e.g. Walter Bishop) both preposterous and tedious, while liking the the two other characters, Peter Bishop and Olivia.  On this second go round, I've learned to live with Walter's peculiarities.

I didn't realize how much fun it was going to be, watching the entire series, from beginning to end, filling in the holes.  The acting is first rate, and for the most part, the individual episodes are interesting enough to hold your attention.",1388188800,,1062,5.104046242774566

The characters grown on you, there are some excellent actors in this series.
The Walter Bishop character is brilliant and the actor does a phenomenal job with this complex genius.
All the actors play their characters in differing universes, so they each are stretched playing slightly different aspects of the same person - brilliantly done, both acting and writing.
For anyone who loved Lost and is experiencing withdrawl symptoms, look no further this is for you.

There is much more intelligent, adult stuff going on beyond the obvious weirdness: humor in abundance, great attention to detail, excellent photography, editing, and music that is very intelligently chosen or written.

4149424,5,B003L77G2Y,"Maybe the only boon to arriving late to FRINGE is that there won't be that interminable wait in between seasons. I guess, also, there's no fretting about whether the show'll get canceled or not. In recent weeks I'd been tearing thru the series, heaps of episodes at a time, losing sleep, underperforming at work, sometimes cursing the show for being so crazy good. Season 3 is the best one yet. The closing moments of its final episode (""The Day We Died"") has me super-stoked to start watching Season 4. Except there's that damn thing called a job. And sleep. Do I regret not having glommed on to FRINGE when it was originally airing? Hell, yes.

I admire the showrunners for being ambitious and for steering the overarching narrative into a bold new direction. I understand that the ratings were always a shaky thing for the show and that maybe the smart thing would've been to stick to the vanilla that people were expecting. As it were, Season 3 took a gamble. It still focused most on the Fringe divison ""over here,"" except that, every now and then, we got to visit the alternate Fringe division ""over there."" You never could settle into mere monotony with this show. There was always something new and unexpected just around the corner. Massive props to the dynamic cast's performances. Most of them had to juggle dual parts, and it's a marvel that their doppelganger roles came across as distinct and equally sympathetic.

I agree with John Noble's mom; the man so deserved an Emmy! Walter, Walternate, past Walter, past Walternate, futuristic even more buggy Walter, futuristic even more menacing Walternate. Noble was simply unbelievable and pushed so many emotional buttons. Admittedly, it took me a bit to warm to Anna Torv, but I'm all in now. This season, she takes on not only two roles but, deep into the season, a third one, as well. That her third iteration doesn't work as well is probably due more to the pointlessness and gimmicky nature of the William Bell story arc. That arc was a waste of a Leonard Nimoy. Still, ""Lysergic Acid Diethylamide"" deserves props for trying something different.

And then there's maybe the season's most jawdropping scene: Broyles on LSD.

Gratifyingly, the dying parallel Earth was explored in depth. Early on, episodes like ""The Plateau"" and ""Amber 31422"" delivered insights into what that world was really like and the desperate people who inhabit it. The first eight episodes (culminating with ""Entrada"") comprehensively built on the show's mythology. Subsequent episodes - the middle bits of the season - did slow down the mythology-building. But the final five episodes - and, yes, that includes ""Lysergic Acid Diethylamide"" - whipped the pace back to a frenzy. And then the awesome ""The Day We Died"" reshuffled things yet again.

If nothing else, FRINGE has contributed to pop culture in a big way. Credit Walter Bishop for coining a slew of memorable words, from ""Walternate"" to ""Fauxlivia"" to ""Vagenda."" But FRINGE is so much more than words cutely cobbled together. I haven't yet seen the full series but my friends who'd watched the entirety of it assure me that the show never sold out and that it never pandered. Always grounding them themes of insane technology and radicalism and dystopianism and crazy time paradoxes are those strong character beats that invest the viewer. The characters resonate with me. I care about Walter with his kind but mad eyes and buttoned-down Olivia and Peter, him what should never have existed. I haven't mentioned Joshua Jackson until now and how he's done this season. He's done very well. In a way, more than anyone else, he anchors the show. And this season revolves so heavily around him. Even more than Olivia Dunham, he's our point-of-view character. And Joshua Jackson is as good as anyone else here. so now can we have a retroactive vote to save the show? Because I am all in.",1381536000,,3882,4.858006042296073
4149425,5,B003L77G2Y,Love Fringe it always kept me wonting more and I can't wate to see the 4th season. It should be just as good. Amazon forcing me to leave a longer appinion is aggravating.,1381449600,,170,4.181818181818182

It took a little for me to get into it, but now the connection with the characters and the need to find out what happens next has taken over.  The simple fact that no character is truly safe from being ""off-ed"" keeps you engaged.  The story is just crazy!",1380758400,,377,4.0
4149483,5,B003L77G2Y,I love Fringe.  It is everything the X-files was and everything the X-files wasn't.  Great chemistry between the actors and great story line from the start.  I've been hooked since the first show.,1380672000,,196,4.878787878787879

There were several writers, and each had a different take, making some of the episodes contain material that contradicts earlier material - again, it's a good ghost story, so who cares?  Incidentally, the third season is the final one that makes any chronological sense... the fourth season may have run out of synoptic material, and goes into alternate time lines, 3 copies of each character, etc.",1380067200,,643,4.714285714285714

I love how each episode of the whole series has a thread from beginning to end, so make sure to pay close attention or you'll get lost. (speaking of Lost - same thing! ; )  Just brilliant.  John Noble is a genius. His character never waivers and is so lovable as Walter Bishop (from the 1st Universe) he makes me cry, laugh, & think big time!
Astrid, AKA: Astrix, Ostrich, Astro, etc., is absolutely adorable, and the relationship between her & Walter is incredibly dear.

At this point in the series, I'm heavily invested in the characters - I care deeply about them and I want to know that it turns out all right for each of them.  Nonetheless, this third year continues to put the characters at ever greater risk - and I couldn't keep myself from watching yet another episode!

I have no idea what they are doing and how they solve these dilemmas but it is really fun anyway. A little bit like the new show ""Under the Dome"", you are in the dark a lot of the time. The stars of the show are quite captivating, and generally covers two different roles in two different dimensions of time(I don't think that is a spoiler).

I enjoyed the whole series with all its odd twists and turns.
I think it ended too soon, and they never tie up all the loose ends, but overall a very satisfying series.
Season 3 has all sorts of things going on.  The acting is excellent.  The effects were awesome.
The story will keep you guessing all the time.
It is intense Science Fiction that moves in and through the Twilight Zone.  While it has been compared to the X-Files and it is in the same genre, I would have to say it is unique in and of itself.  This show has taken twists and turns the X-Files would not have been able to keep up with.  It didn't have the single minded obsession of Mulder and unending skepticism of Scully.  They are a team that enters into each adventure with open minds, a variety of personal issues, and many things going on behind the scenes.  If you are a scifi fan, this is a must.  If you like weird stories of what could be, you should try it.  If this sort of stuff disturbs or scares you in any way, run screaming, because this is likely way more than you can handle.",1375315200,,1074,4.2

I mean it's sci-fi so tons of this stuff is crazy but things like the FBI clearing a house first before civilians move in is fairly important.  I like to see that attention to detail.  As far as the acting goes they all do a very good job.  John Noble is perhaps the best of them all.  He doesn't get enough credit for this great work.  I felt that this season was pretty tight and had some great interaction of the main characters.  Too bad it all ends with season 5.,1374624000,,563,4.10091743119266

Even Dr. Bishop who is the crazed scientist is reeled in before his character veers too far of course. It's all about balance.

4150091,5,B003L77G2Y,For me the odd sci fi occurrences and graphic dissections of victims  are not what make this show interesting.  It is the interactions of the main characters who develop a connection as they evolve into a team working closely together.  Over time they begin to show a real caring and protective attitude toward one another.  As usual it is the people that drive a good story.  Though it took me a couple episodes to get into it I highly recommend this series.,1369785600,,459,4.548780487804878

4150108,5,B003L77G2Y,This season proved to be a good reason to continue to watch this show that is made available through Amazon Prime. The HD version was just that; Hi-Def!,1369526400,,152,4.464285714285714

Well, it very well may be season 3. The reason is simple.....my favorite show became two outstanding shows. These marvelous actors managed to play two distinct sets of people in the most superlative manner possible.

4150112,5,B003L77G2Y,The third season of 'Fringe' continues to deliver that same mix of almost-too-unbelievable plot lines with 'I wonder what happens next'. Despite a few seeming continuity mix-ups in a few episodes the actors continue to make you believe in the bizarre happenings the series develops so well. We are well into the fourth season and I am anxious to see how they wrap up that season.,1369353600,,379,4.757575757575758

Parallel universe based sci-fi tend not to hold my attention but in Fringe's case, it's done well enough that it holds my attention and keeps me entertained. Perfect? No. Predictable? Sometimes. Entertaining. Yes. When you're waiting for the next season of The Walking Dead, or Game of Thrones to appear, Fringe can fill the gap quite well.",1369180800,,414,4.928571428571429

4150137,5,B003L77G2Y,"All you have to do is look online and search Fringe vs...and immediately Xfiles comes up and autocompletes for you to show you the vast comparisons. I didn't watch Fringe until after it was available to stream all 5 seasons...so I didn't get the anticipation of waiting for every new episode to come out. It was different in the case of X-Files. Like much of the x-files fan base, I was waiting for it each week..talking about it the next day. X-Files was a very new type of show with great character development. Where it was a bit weak, and had in my opinion started to unravel..was its inability to stay focused on it's major story arc with a clear vision. I loved the X-Files, still do.

Fringe, while it feels familiar, is a very different show. It doesn't focus on the supernatural at all...or on aliens. It does focus on time travel and alternate realities. While that may be the main technical detail that fanboys use to differentiate the shows...I don't think its the big difference. For me, it is really the style of character development that makes them different.

If you are looking for a Mulder/Scully comparison, you won't find one. Fringe has a much more developed ensemble driven story. Many characters are given changes to shine and have relevance to the story. Mulder and Scully had a formula between them that is hard to imitate or top. I don't think Fringe tries to do that.

John Noble's character of Walter Bishop is amazing. I don't think X-Files has a comparable element. Walter adds an emotional depth to Fringe that is based on deep loss and remorse. His guilt and pain are so profound that we have seen him shattered and fragmented. Even his character alone will draw you into fringe. Mulder's loss of his sister while a good driver for the story of the X-Files canon...is never as deeply felt as Walter's losses.

If you liked X-Files, you'll like Fringe I think, as long as you aren't expecting a clone. It's the same genre, no question about it.",1369008000,,1976,4.621082621082621
4150138,5,B003L77G2Y,"This is the most exciting seanson of Fringe so far.  Lots of things happening, in more than one place.  Not just events, but relationships as well. After season 3, you are definitely hooked for season 4.",1368921600,,203,4.611111111111111
4150139,4,B003L77G2Y,"The acting is top-notch, and the effects are movie quality.  I wasn't motivated to watch episode after episode, but I'm sure that many may feel that way.",1368921600,,153,4.666666666666667
4150140,4,B003L77G2Y,"On star less because from being fun it is getting to be complicated, in a non-amusing way. The aftertaste is that of a cheap novella and a great suspense. Mixed feelings about it. I do understand that maintaining this type of show interesting is a very difficult task for the crew involved, but it has become a romantic quasi-cheesy show. Still, the acting is superb, the Walters are the best, and Anna Torv is incomparable when impersonating the other-universe Olivia Dunham, which, by the way, it is a true human being when compared to our universe's Dunham. Jasika Nicole, in both universes, is great, but I love her character in our universe: intelligent, attentive, compassionate, and full of understanding.  It is this great acting by all members that makes it a 4 star so far. First and Second seasons: 5 stars, no doubt about it.",1368921600,,837,4.772413793103448

Eugenics, Transhumanism and the ever growing hubris of man to create his environment in his own image. Though we all know this is a futile effort, and unfortunately, like Icarus we will collide too. This show is mostly the truth hidden in plain sight. Artist and writers using fiction to depict elements of truth. Too bad it was cancelled.",1368835200,,472,4.7560975609756095

There are a few interesting twists and turns that keep you coming back. The ""special"" episode is awesome as well 'as usual'.

The plot is very unpredictable, which makes it a joy to watch because you really don't know what's just around the corner.

4150159,4,B003L77G2Y,"I was going to give a 5 star review, but then I remembered something that happened while I was watching the second season.  The first season killed it, great way to get an audience hooked.  But there were a few episodes in the middle of the second season that could have literally been inserted at any point in the story and you wouldn't know the difference.  The long story arc that is the entire 5 seasons is truly the interesting part of this series, the shorter story arcs can, at times, be less interesting.  I actually found myself skip an episode or two in the second season (that I had watched before).  They just weren't as captivating as the really good episodes like the final two of the second season.

Don't get me wrong, overall I would recommend this show to anyone who even remotely enjoys sci-fi shows.  I would just say to people that if you run into a few episodes that are just ""so so"", continue with the entire series.  The last season in particular I find quite good.  I think the reason for that is that they tie more into the long story arc.

If I could give it 4.5 stars I would, but I can't.  Either way, I'm a huge fan and if you're on the fence about getting into this show, it's well worth your time.

Thanks,

4150225,5,B003L77G2Y,I just like Fringe. It's a series ihave watched and enjoyed. A bit far fetched but enjoyable. Like I could watch it without commercials.,1367107200,,136,4.708333333333333

4150243,4,B003L77G2Y,"The premise of 2 universes on a road to destruction is mind grabbing.  Most episodes have a satisfactory ending.  Fringe events generally are some kind of mystery running the gamut from weird science, biology, mental, and almost anything else you can imagine.  The series has a highly satisfactory conclusion, so this is one you'll enjoy.  I didn't like every episode, but most of them were done well.",1366761600,,401,4.940298507462686
4150244,5,B003L77G2Y,The third season was the best season for Fringe. The creators seemed more free to tell their story. I love these episodes.,1366761600,,122,4.590909090909091
4150245,4,B003L77G2Y,This show is interesting and demands imagination and love of sci-fi themes. They keep coming up with different stories for each show that holds me.  I am not one that watches tv much!,1366761600,,183,4.545454545454546

4150268,5,B003L77G2Y,This show in the third season continues to entertain the viewer.  The writers and director are still on top of their game and the show continues to be exciting and unpredictable.  Good entertainment.,1366502400,,199,5.0

4150271,5,B003L77G2Y,"This is the perfect type of series to stream from Amazon - we watch one during dinner each night. No need to wait to get through reruns, commercials, etc.

The acting is excellent. Both Olivias and both Walters are interesting and different enough to illustrate the effect of experience on shaping personalities. The two Astrids are so different that it is hard to believe they started out the same. Again, the actors are doing an excellent job.

You definitely don't want to start with season 3 - this is one of those shows like Lost that needs to be watched more or less sequentially.",1366329600,,586,4.625
4150272,5,B003L77G2Y,"The actors are so impressive. Leonard Nimoy, Blair Brown, what a treat.  Walter and Astrid have such a great relationship going, I find myself chuckling at their interactions.",1366329600,,175,5.25
4150273,4,B003L77G2Y,"The series, with it constant jumping around, through various universes and timelines is great fun. That being said, I can see why it ended, as it would be difficult to follow on a weekly tv series basis, what with the constant shifts in locations, times and characters. I watched two and sometimes three episodes a day (the joy of Amazon Prime and Roku), much like reading a pageturner book you can't put down. I can't say I'm thrilled with paying for episodes in season five, but there are only 12 or so and I can get five of them free on Hulu Plus. Overall, I have enjoyed the entire series.",1366329600,,593,4.4
4150274,5,B003L77G2Y,"Such great writing, with the overarching theme, delivered weekly, of Who are we, at core?  If someone in an alternate universe shares our DNA, how much is he or she like us?  How similar are twins to each other?  Would we know a loved one who shared the DNA of an imposter -- could we tell the difference between the two nearly-similar people?  How much of who we are is genetic, how much our experiences?
And finally, for fun, what are the ethics of traveling between parallel universes?
Enjoy,

Just when you think you've grasped two dimensions they throw in time travel, humans from the future (mysterious bald men), and a whole lot of stuff that... make for a great show.",1366329600,,292,4.7254901960784315

4150284,5,B003L77G2Y,THis series just keeps getting better and better. It can definitely be a mind-bender at times but they never allow a story arc to get so twisted you can't understand it as you go. Excellent acting and great plot lines.,1365984000,,218,4.475
4150285,5,B003L77G2Y,"I am really enjoying "" Fringe "". A combination of the ""X-Files"" and a favorite show from my boyhood , ""The Outer Limits "" .

The characters are both likeable and consistent (I hate it when a character suddenly changes his or her basic motives for the sake of a story). Each episode immediately makes me want to see the next, and streaming it is great without any commercials and no waiting for the next episode. It is what Lost started as before it jumped the shark.

During the day I often cheer myself up thinking about catching up on Peter and Oliva.  I also like the other characters, Walter, Astrid, Broyles, etc. Actually I am enjoying this part of the series less as one of the main characters is missing, and the others are a little out of sorts.  The series is so well produced and acted that it pulls you into their world, or should I say both of their universes??  I like intrigue series but I am not usually into SciFi.

The writing is sharp and the characters especially Walter are great. I had been originally skeptical of the 2 universe thing but the writers have handled it so well.

The acting is surprisingly good with the father Walter Bishop having the most excellent character part and the best lines ever. This show often seems familiar but with more twists and great effects - the creepy parts are visceral and the smart parts are thoughtfully constructed, yet somehow the director managed to add lots of funny lines all going to the father, Walter Bishop. This group includes British actor Jared Harris from Mad Men, as the best evil bad guy ever. If you enjoy quality story telling give this a watch.

This would have gotten away from me, bacause I had never seen Fringe on TV, and the series ended in January 2013.  I have watched all of the weekly programs through half of the fourth season already, and I plan to finish the entire series.  Thank you Amazon for putting tShe series on the free Prime network.",1364601600,,374,4.537313432835821
4150387,5,B003L77G2Y,Fringe (all seasons) is imaginative and thought provoking. I challenge anyone to predict the plot before watching the entire series. I am only sad that it has ended.. leaving me to search for the next fascinating and amazing science fiction series. Watch them in order or you will be completely lost.,1364601600,,300,4.901960784313726

4150390,5,B003L77G2Y,"If you liked X-Files, then you'll probably love Fringe. Fringe excels with its interactions between the cast. The stories are exciting and keep you begging for more. I find it difficult to watch a single episode in one sitting because each episode leaves me wanting to know ""what happens next?""

Highly recommended!",1364515200,,315,5.0576923076923075
4150391,5,B003L77G2Y,"Season 3 is great.  The series is relentless and never lets up.  They love to pluck at emotional strings and for sure did so quite often during the season.  If you have gotten to this point, you are a fan and will absolutely enjoy the season.

4150395,5,B003L77G2Y,"I'm doing this review for my wife(she just doesn't like reviewing things). The show is not quite my speed, but my wife is absolutely hooked. She is the biggest 'X-Files' fan you'll ever meet(she has the complete series, movies, action figures, autographs ...) Anyway, the point is I have not seen her this hooked on a show since then, and she is totally hooked on 'Fringe'. She even has my 12yr. old son watching it now! that's how I know it's good. I have to confess I have only seen a couple of episodes myself, but they seem very well written, acted, directed, and 'special effects' are excellent. My wife has watched all 4 seasons on Prime and is considering purchasing the 5th because she has no patience(Amazon please release 5th season soon!). I think I have convinced her to 're-watch' all 4 seasons in order again, but I don't know how much longer that will last. Hope this review helped in the slightest. Bottom line: Most X-Files fans and Sci-Fi fans in general will get a kick out of FRINGE. Enjoy!",1364515200,,1010,4.554945054945055

4150449,4,B003L77G2Y,I like WALTER. Same actor in Lord of the Rings as steward of Gondor. Subject is more science and speculations of reality. I like all the characters. Olivia starts out a little weak but has earned her place in the center of the tale/s.,1363910400,,234,4.340909090909091
4150450,5,B003L77G2Y,"Fringe is probably the best show ever produced for television! You won't be able to stop watching! After the first episode you get interested. After the first season you get hooked. By the final, fifth season you'll start all over again because it is that good! And beware!! I guarantee you will not be able to watch only one episode at-a time! You'll find yourself watching four or five.",1363824000,,388,4.63768115942029

Mixture of sci fi, drama, humor and a great storyline.",1363392000,,263,4.0576923076923075
4150481,5,B003L77G2Y,Very refreshing tv show.  There is nothing like it on tv.  It is best to start at the beginning and go through the entire series.,1363305600,,129,4.12

With the main characters universe-hopping, we are left with brainwashing (and drying), betrayal, and cosmic mysteries in addition to the usual Fringe investigations.  If you like science fiction, fantasy and drama, catch Fringe.",1363219200,,261,5.5
4150500,5,B003L77G2Y,"Just so very, very good and entertaining. I've paid to see these seasons and then I get to the fifth season and I have to pay MORE on top of that! I haven't figured the whole thing out but it would cost me around $60 to view the whole season! I don't think that's right. You should have some sort of disclaimer, at the very least, at the beginning that states further down the line you will have to pay for the later seasons. This happened in October Road too. Well that one you can't even see online, you HAVE to buy the DVD!!

You should also have a rating for these TV shows. Those British shows show full frontal nudity and have the most awful language it would make a sailor blush. I just never dreamed it was that bad over there. I suppose in time it will be the same here so there needs to be some sort of filtering system. Please. Thank you.",1363219200,,849,4.114457831325301

Season 3 continues in the same vein as Season 2, and while the season is plot-arc driven, there are still some essentially stand-alone episodes. The Season 3 episodes take place in both worlds; the alternate versions of the main characters are irritatingly smug a-holes, and the dichotomy really kept me glued to my seat and rooting for the home team. Season 3 is slow in places, but just as good as Season 2.",1363219200,,539,4.5

4150508,5,B003L77G2Y,"If there is a norm in Fringe this season starts moving away from it. Moving back and forth between universes and people is sometimes hard to keep up with but it adds to the strangeness of the whole thing. I'm really liking Astrid more and more, she puts up with Walter very well and helps out on every investigation. Of course the main 3 are excellent. But is their still 3?

It is difficult to rationalize whay this type of program would only last five seasons. Just look at the absolute trash that runs over and over, year after year.

4150640,5,B003L77G2Y,"the only thing that would make the series better would be to have Amazon Prime include the 5th season in it's selection.  I was most annoyed to finish season 4 only to find season 5 not available on prime.  Netflix is soon to add Fringe to the mix... we shall see if that pulls people in their direction.
It was sad to see Fringe end, although they did come to a logical and satisfying conclusion (no spoilers here).  It is rare to find quality science fiction on television.  The Sci-Fi channel (now called SyFy) is a bore... I suspect they will soon change their name because they no longer offer Science Fiction fare.  With all the quality science fiction novels and stories out there, it is perplexing that this is so little of it reflected in video or movies.

If you watch Fringe, you must begin with the first season to truly appreciate the development of the characters as well as the storyline.

Die hard Fringe fans shouldn't be disappointed. This is not a series to just jump in the middle of.

4150678,3,B003L77G2Y,"As much as I like Olivia and as hot as Anna Torv is, the whole ""Olivia/not-Olivia"" thing is so thin it is about to fall off or right through the tolerance table. Now it's cartoons in Ep. 19... just kill the bitch! There's still one left, right?
Here we have the brains of the millennium figuring out time travel, inter-dimensional travel, mind-melding, but they too damn stupid to see the false Olivia? I just don't buy it anymore. It was a thin literary device to start with, and distracts me from believing in the characters. In my opinion it was unnecessary, overdone, overdrawn, and not believable. It's the same thing I guess as no one 'recognizing' Clark Kent as Mr. S, but it is driving me crazy!
She's still the hottest actor on tv.

I apologize for using words such as ""opinion"" as they seem to trigger those god-awful pop-up obnoxious and totally irrelevant ads on this site. I HATE THEM. Not my fault, sorry.",1361404800,,923,4.566265060240964

4150702,5,B003L77G2Y,"I never thought I would get into this type of science fiction, but I am totally hooked on this series, and I dread coming to the end of the final season. The characters are great. Walter sucks you right in. He's such a complex, conflicted, brilliant, and lovable character that you can't help but fall in love with him. Peter off-sets Olivia's intensity perfectly so that their relationship is a natural. Astrid & Walter are precious together.
As far out & weird as the story gets, the writers always find a way to base it in science & to make it believable. It stretches your mind, making you consider ideas you've never thought of before. The idea of the alternate universe is intriguing to say the least.",1361145600,,707,4.574803149606299

4150706,1,B003L77G2Y,"Such a stupid plot twist completely killed the development of the entire story line.  Olivia who is trapped in the alternate universe, risks everything to break into the lab, and for a moment manages to cross back into her universe, just long enough to beg a night cleaning lady to pass on a vital message to Peter.  Cleaning lady calls Peter late at night and passes on the message, stating that real Olivia is trapped in the alternate universe.

Having such vital, game changing piece of intel, Peter gets up in the middle of the night, to SNOOP around like a little boy, and then decides to just randomly type in passwords to hack planted Olivias laptop...

Yeeeaaap.  This is the dude thats been doing all kinds of shady, under the table deals in every nasty crevice of the world, and instead of soundly going to sleep, so he can safely burn her the next day, or I don't know, maybe even run surveillance on her for EVERYTHING shes got, nope, he's going to immediately tell her that he knows she's a plant.

Further more, while under her gun, Peter proceeds to INJECT himself with unknown compound, simply because planted Olivia is forcing him to.  He does kind of inquire if it'll kill him, but I guess for a fella that feels right at home in places like Iraq, doing something to him self that'll conveniently look like a suicide, apparently makes total sense.

This kind of a plot twist, is simply insulting, and after that scene they could have cut away right to ScoobyDoo.  I don't care that for some reason injection was not deadly, and Peter is going to wake up, none of that matters.

Once story credibility is blown, there's no way of recovering it.  The entire development of the series was turned into a cheap joke literally in a matter of 7 minutes.

Peters character was positioned as the prime focus point of the whole plot, he's the one who is supposed to activate the next phase of the operation, and he is a complete idiot.  From this point on, he might as well walk around in a sagging diaper while sucking on his thumb.

Ludicrous waste of time.",1361059200,6,2067,4.506702412868632

It is like watching a baseball team that hits home runs every time at bat! They continue to stagger the story line so you have one theme happening one episode and then another picks up the next time and at times they both merge in one episode! This show should be considered required viewing for any writer or director! They are establishing the new paradigm for brilliance in television and it really is the only Oasis in the TV badlands!

4150840,5,B003L77G2Y,"I am a true sci-fi fan but never thought to watch Fringe while it was grinding through the first few seasons. I think this is because I just thought it was a weekly whodunnit and had no idea the underlying story was a continuing scientific epic. I am now watching the whole series from beginning to end, just getting to the end of the third season. The show is nothing short of fantastic. I think it got short shrift because it started out a little slow in the first few episodes and the producers weren't sure how to integrate the weekly crime element with the ongoing parallel universe plot. Now there are marvelous twists, creepy experiments, whacked out technology, romance and character nuances that are just delightful. I envision a bunch of Walters in a lab somewhere dreaming up these episodes. It is just wonderful and why I love sci-fi. Start from the very beginning and watch all the way through to season five. You'll be hooked too.",1360022400,,944,4.625

4150859,3,B003L77G2Y,"The third season, like the start of the third act of a three-act play, really gets into the meat of the story and offers plenty of twists and turns.  Sadly the video quality on the all the ""Fringe"" DVDs is not as good as other series I've seen.  (The ""CSI"" DVD boxes look almost as good as the HD broadcasts if you have a decent up-converting DVD player.)  These discs sometimes go blocky and pixelated, looking almost like video streamed over a low bandwidth network connection.  I ended up replacing all four seasons with the Blu Ray releases (which also include a few extra features not found on the DVDs.) This is the first time I have ever rebought a TV series on BD, but I think ""Fringe"" is worth it.  (I also bought each season when I could get the best deals, either here at Amazon or at TheWBStore.com, which currently has S1, S2 and S4 for $21.49 each with free shipping.  S3 was sold out, last I looked.)  But if DVD is your only option and you can get them on sale, the story and the acting more than make up for the image quality issues.

4150875,5,B003L77G2Y,"I am not a real TV person though I do have some faves that I watch. Maybe because I live in Hawaii and the Fox affiliate is not always Fox network, but I had NEVER seen Fringe until the Science channel picked it up and showed several episodes of Season 1, which I watched from the beginning only a few weeks ago. I LOVE Fringe, and finding it on Instant Streaming on Amazon is what made me spring for the $79 for Amazon Prime. But watching the show is a little bit like trying to eat one chip for me. I stayed up almost all night watching from the beginning of season 1.  I'm midway through the last episode of season 3 now, and I can't believe how quickly 45 minutes goes by. Fringe is by far my favorite show in recent years. The writing, production and acting are all top quality. I gave season 3 5 stars but I think it's more like 4 1/2 because it's not as good as Seasons 1 and 2. There is great chemistry between all of the cast members. I like that they developed the relationship between Olivia and Peter. Finding Walter Bishop in prison on the last show of season 3 was a surprise but I haven't seen the whole episode and don't want to have to give a spoiler alert anyway.

Great show--and because I get the HD with unlimited streaming with the Amazon Prime annual fee, I will likely keep that going for a long time yet. Even when I've watched one show, I find that when I watch it again I get something from it that I didn't catch the first time.  It is really too bad that the current season 5 will be the last one. On a more positive note, I saw a preview for a movie at the theater yesterday that is by the three writers who do Fringe. That should be worth watching too.",1357776000,,1683,4.109422492401216

4150915,4,B003L77G2Y,"as time goes by this ""wonderfully bizarre"" series gets, in some ways, harder to understand  and like.. In the first season I never really understood just what was going on, something about a ""pattern"" in some series of events culminating in Agent Dunham meeting Walter Bishop's old partner William Bell (played by Leonard Nimoy) in an alternate universe. It's a better looking X Files.
Second season looked just as good but may have even raised the weirdness level with more strange, not always connected, cases. It ended with a Fringe team crossing to the other universe where they ended up in a battle with the alternate forces and the alternate Olivia taking ""our"" Olivia's place.
Third season is especially confusing, switching back & forth between universes. It turns out Bell was killed in the battle that trapped Olivia ""over there"" (she does find her way home). I don't even remember when ""our"" guys figured out ""Olivia"" but eventually both universes work together to solve some ancient puzzle involving Peter Bishop restoring the disruption caused by Bell & Walter Bishop's early experiments. The season ends with both Fringe teams in a blended lab together getting ready to heal their universes- and then the mysterious bald men in black, the ""Observers"", appear to erase Peter from the timeline, he's served his purpose and no one seems to know he's gone. The cliffhanger, pretty much ignored in fourth season, leaves Peter in some future (?- 2036?) battle zone .",1354752000,,1474,4.991869918699187

It only happened once and I hope it does not happen again. I will be looking for more and more seasons. This series will become a classic. the fictional characters of Olivia, Peter and Walter work so well togeather and are so believable they really do seem to be real and not actors.

4150953,5,B003L77G2Y,"Which means you already know what I think of this simply amazing, too good for TV scripted show that NOBODY is watching, hence I get, I think 11 more episodes until my heart is once again broken as I salute the end of another absolutely outstanding television show. I am with both reviewers of TV Guide and USAToday who have tirelessly and shamelessly promoted this show (who both often will try to push a Friday night show opposite it, ie: ""you can watch so and so for some slightly decent entertainment, or you can crawl out of your it's the end of the week and I'm tired and don't want my brain to work too hard malaise and watch Fringe for truly intelligent, well-acted, excellent entertainment"" (sic). I do have to say that putting Grimm up against Fringe is simply Hollywood being rude again as if there is a real choice. I mean, Fringe has been on a lot longer, but has continued to get better and better for the three of us watching it. Grimm is pretty much on a par with Fringe, in creativity and intelligence and lovely quirky characters (seriously, Walter or Monroe? As if we have a choice!), but I think I'm just being bitter again.

Admittedly, Fringe had a bit of a stuttering beginning, but I don't believe I've ever seen a sci fi show that didn't (I'll reference Eureka here, which in my opinion had about the worst first year of any sci fi show I've seen - fast forward to its final show that I used up a box of Kleenex as my heart broke watching what became, to me, as close to the perfection of Firefly we have gotten on the entertainment medium called scripted television). Fringe, for those of you who abandoned it for whatever reasons, thus making me soon face another evening wrapped in my favorite blankie, box of Kleenex on hand as I once again, pay homage to the finale of sci fi perfection, will forever be burned into my memory with its wonderful cast of characters - Olivia, Peter, Astrid, and the ultimate arguably best character since Capt. Malcolm Reynolds of Firefly, Walter, presumably *SPOILER ALERT* defeat the Observers as they seek to strip earth of whatever they need and move on to do the same to another hapless planet. And honestly? How did they find the perfect actress to play Etta - who is the spitting image of Olivia with Peter's eyes?

While I am grateful that we get with Fringe what we have not gotten from countless other wonderful show (she says, bitterly, still wondering just what The Event was even after two or three years).

So I should be grateful to Fox who has been far more generous overall than other networks *cough* NBC *cough* for giving us closure (ie:Prison Break). But really, I couldn't say it better than either the TV Guide guy OR the USAToday guy who have shamelessly and bravely stood up for this truly brilliant show (although without ant compensation) - THIS is not Fox's fault. It is our's.

After all Fox is a business and has continued to allow the same 3.5 million viewers (paltry in network world) the privilege of this intelligent, exceptional scripted show far longer than the numbers game should have allowed. We all make choices with what little time we have these days - especially in the only demographic that counts which boggles my mind - those 18 - 49ers who are simply too busy raising families, working to pay the bills or attending whatever event or child-centered Friday night delight to watch an original brand new Steven Spielberg offering let alone a simple TV show. No matter that those of us OVER the age of 49 have made our money and probably have more discretionary income to spend on most advertisers wares - but I'm on my weighted soap box again. I think even Fox was hoping that the final season of Fringe would garner more than the usual 3.5 million voters as I read the comments when they announced them. I think even Fox would have liked another year of this wonderfully odd cast and the many stories left to tell about them.

But alas, for whatever reasons, we, the People, have spoken and Fringe will soon be no more. Some day, people who could have made a difference now WILL find and watch Fringe and wish they'd watched it when it mattered. So do I. So do I!",1349913600,,4169,4.516556291390729

Harvard professor Walter, in and out of a penal system-either a mental institution or a mere prison, exhibiting his boundless knowledge and hands-on expertise in everything is a more and more annoying character, and a next season ought to probably clarify an illogical mess and obvious mismatches found prior to a sit-com future-set release.",1338336000,,934,5.22

What's to like? You get to see both universes. You get to see Anna Torv and John Noble play both their characters in our universe and their alternates in the other universe. And these aren't 'slight' variations of the characters, these are full-blown characters in their own right with different personalities from their dopplegangers in our universe. And it's not black and white, we can see the complexities and it's not simple to declare who the good guys and bad guys are although Walternate comes closest to being the bad guy. At least, until you see Season 4...

Simply put - this show is a tour-de-force and absolutely mind-blowing at times. It is a crime that more people aren't watching it.

You could make a case for season 1 (where things were still hidden) and season 2 (where the inter-dimensional war become fully out in the open and secrets were revealed) being better and I'd be hard pressed to argue. I doubt many would argue that the current season 4 is the best but then again with 8 episodes left who knows what the writers will pull on us.

4151059,5,B003L77G2Y,"I suppose the title of my review alone will bring wrath down on me, but so be it.
I found this show in the middle of its second season.  Despite the amount of important material I had missed, I hung in there and kept following along, finally buying the DVDs of previous shows and catching up.  It has been well worth the effort.
""Fringe,"" while seeming very much like a derivative of ""The X-Files"" as it geared up, really came to not only stand on its own, but outclass its predecessor already by the end of its first season.  (I say this as someone who owns most of the run of ""The X-Files"" on DVD.)  It really hit its stride in season two and shows no signs of faltering here in season three.  The (literally) multidimensional narrative, the complexity of the many strands that form that narrative, the performances across the board are all top-flight.  (The plot, by the way, is not confusing, despite its complexity.  You don't have to be Sheldon Cooper to enjoy it.  And even characters who often simply pop in and out, like Jasika Nicole and Blair Brown, are FABULOUS.)
It looks very much like Fox is on its way to kiling this outstanding show (why the banishment to Friday night last season?  Why?), which is a real shame, since I think it has legs to go longer than the X-Files did, certainly longer than ""Lost."" But I fear we will be robbed of this exceedingly imaginative, entertaining, thought-provoking show well before its natural life would have given out.  I know that's the way of television, but it would be downright criminal in this case.",1324857600,,1557,4.548387096774194

4151076,5,B003L77G2Y,"Fringe is one of those truly outstanding shows that combines intelligent scripts, high quality acting skills and such an imaginative premise, it is hard to see why its TV ratings struggle so. With rare exceptions there are almost no duff stories, which contrasts dramatically with most series which quickly become formulaic, covering exactly the same themes as every other drama on TV. I suspect this is because the studios turn things over to a team of payrolled writers who are brought on board by season 2 to churn out the same tired ideas (perhaps produced for them by some random generator software), undermining a shows originality.

Clearly, this has never happened with Fringe - the writing remains fresh; the plots innovative and  exciting, while the characters have depth and continue to evolve without ever losing the essence of who they are. I wonder if the trouble is that this the show is TOO imaginative and intelligent for a large percentage of the TV viewing public which seems to thrive on low quality, low budget programs presented by truly irritating halfwits.

Why so cynical? I think as one ages one imagines that education is making a difference and that this in turn might promote better quality programming, but with rare exceptions like Fringe, nothing has changed. If you want something to stimulate the little gray cells instead of eroding them, Fringe is one way to get your fix.",1322784000,,1408,4.932489451476793

4151081,5,B003L77G2Y,"""Olivia"" is a fantastic start to season 3.  I thought the season 2 2-part finale was one of the best 2 hours of TV ever, in taking us to the alternate universe and significantly expanding the mythology in a very exciting and believable way.  I was happy to find that season 3 starts off strongly, taking place in the alternate universe.  Without going into spoilers, the highlight of the episode is Ana Torv's acting.

In the first 2 seasons Ana Torv did not make much of an impression simply because she came off as very one note---cold and focused.  When given good material to work with, like ""Olivia,"" she is simply amazing, showing the confusion and vulnerability of this character we have been following for 2 seasons.  Also notable is guest actor Andre Royo (Bubbles from The Wire).  The two actors have great chemistry.

Also fun is picking out the subtle differences between our universe and the alternate universe.  I look forward to Ana Torv's basically playing 2 different characters this season.  It's also fun to see Lance Reddick, Kirk Acevedo, John Noble, etc. playing alternate versions of their characters.",1322092800,,1124,4.868421052631579

The reason it terrifies me is the people behind it.  Lost was such a disappointment in that last season.  I think that fringe will be different simply because of it's story up to date (the story is more honest with the viewers if that makes sense), and because hopefully a lesson has been learned from Lost.  Greed just terrifies me when it comes to television, some exec may decide that if they milk the story they can earn some more money, instead of giving the story an ending.  All stories deserve an ending.

Anyways if you have tv SUPPORT THIS SHOW.  And if you don't, SUPPORT THIS SHOW.  And if you have the time write to the show telling them to dignify Fringe with the ending it deserves when the time comes.",1321920000,,929,4.2272727272727275

4151085,2,B003L77G2Y,"Before I give my review, I have to say that I am a ""Fringe"" fan. Even though I started watching during season 2 and then watching season 1, I quickly fell in love with those two seasons. They had excellent writing, good memorable characters, and a fascinating premise. I was so looking forward to season 3, but my hopes were dashed. The writing went downhill; characters stopped being as memorable; story lines were boring or didn't make any sense at all.

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD

A big letdown for me was the characters. Olivia used to be interesting, but then she got all angsty, especially when she and Peter had their little spat. Walter used to be funny, but some of his actions and conversations came across as being forced and not as humorous as they used to be. Peter used to have that sarcastic likeableness about him, but I stopped liking him when he failed to differentiate between Olivia and Faux-livia. I have to say that Anna Torv did a very good job at portraying two different people; her demeanor and actions clearly made her two characters different.

While the season started off at a good pace, it got bogged down with some of its episodes. The first nine episodes were entertaining, but after that they became rather boring. I recall in seasons 1 and 2 where there were episodes not dealing with the overarching plot, but even then they were interesting. Even ""Earthling"" from season 2, which many fans dislike, was an interesting episode. The cases from season 3 were largely not interesting and dealt with some braniac or psycho trying to do something for good or for revenge. I miss season 1 episodes where several of them dealt with either the Pattern or a psycho experimenting on genetics or weapons who had a connection to the Pattern. Even season 2 had episodes with Newton and the shape-shifters, which were good. These episodes of just random braniacs in season 3 are not very interesting and not very gripping to me. The episode ""Subject 13"" looked like it was meant to be like season 2's ""Peter,"" but it failed to that standard. And ""LSD"" was bizarre and did not really seem to have any point, compared to ""Brown Betty"" which was a little weird but seemed to have a definite purpose in season 2.

Another disappointment were the story arcs of season 3. The season 2 finale promised an amazing storyline for season 3, especially with Peter and the doomsday machine and Walternate wanting to destroy the Blue Universe. The story arc, however, I was thought was a good concept but very poorly executed. It moved along at a pace that was way too slow, and too much was left unanswered. The season 3 finale did not tie up the loose ends very well, and I finished the episode thinking to myself ""what the heck just happened? You spent an entire season building up to something, and we get this?"" It was very poor writing, and I was not impressed, which was a shocker for me because I've loved ""Fringe's"" previous season finales. Then there were other minor story arcs that had no point or went on for way too long. The whole Faux-livia infiltrating Blue Universe and falling for Peter while our Olivia is brainwashed in Red Universe was too long and too drawn out; it should have ended earlier. The arc with Olivia hating Peter for sleeping with Faux-livia was rather overdramatic, and I did not sympathize with either side; it also became too dominant in the season where it should have been a more minor side plot. The arc with Bell possessing Olivia was stupid and did not seem to have any point; there was potential for Bell to help Fringe team with his knowledge of the Red Universe, but it was never used. The whole Faux-livia pregnancy arc was very predictable and ultimately did not have much of a point either, except serving as a rather complicated and unnecessary way to get Peter's DNA, Then there was the finale, which was drawn out too long over too many episodes; season 2 finale was much better in that each episode was independent but built up to an amazing finale- not so with season 3.

Another problem with the writing was how many threads were dropped. Peter's whole thing with killing the shape-shifters lasted only one episode and was never touched upon again. Alternate Charlie and Lincoln Lee becoming suspicious of Walternate was also brief. Faux-livia's kidnapping was never fully solved and the reasons for it were never given. There were others throughout season 3, but the dropped storylines really bothered me.

I had very high hopes for season 2, but I was rather underwhelmed by it. It started off strong, but after a few episodes, I got bored and disappointed with the season.",1321401600,10,4637,4.676470588235294

If you haven't been watching, go back and start at the top. It's worth it!
My only gripe has to do with the physical format of the Blu-ray version. WB has stuffed so many episodes onto the four discs that many Blu-ray players may experience loading problems unless you first erase the players disc cache. A fifth disc would have solved this.

Created by J.J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman & Roberto Orci

Have Fringe seasons one and two on DVD, but this is the first season I purchased on Blu-ray. And it's outstanding!

Seasons are getting better (if you can believe that), because it was great from the first get-go.  Love the supernatural incidents, and our cast as the special task force are the one and only people who can deal with it. Also the high tech, supernatural and experimenting is a draw for the sci-fi and mystery fans.

Each episode brings you closer to what the mystery of alternate worlds is about, but don't think you've found the answer - you haven't.  That's what keeps you coming back, week after week.  The cast grows every week, with one or the other taking the lead, and our alternate beings from the other side, are like us but not quite, there is that slight difference, that's the beauty of it - tense and downright chilling at times.

Our lead characters handle their alternates in a meticulous way with strong acting in every step of the way.  Watching the special features on the Discs gives you the challenges the cast, special effects and stunt people deal with in each episode every week- great stuff, they keep pushing the envelope.

As one reviewer has requested and encouraged as many folks to start viewing 'Fringe' live on Fridays.  In closing ... please watch.

4151126,5,B003L77G2Y,"I cannot put the amount of joy I receive from watching Fringe. The story lines of the first 2 seasons are set, and season 3 builds on and delivers a worthwhile season finale. Particulars are hard to discuss, since the show hit it's stride in season 2 and kept building layers and layers of story. The only real way to understand is to watch the series.

The one good thing about Fringe is that the main three characters are connected, and all the events of the show are a result of the characters actions in the past. So every ""Fringe"" event that happens is a result of what a character did previously. This will not leave you guessing as to why these events are happening.

Season 1, the show was finding it's legs. It started off strong, then went into a procedural path, then by the end of season 1, it found its direction. Season 2, the building and building continued as more revelations were revealed. Season 3 is the best of the series so far.",1318809600,,950,4.392045454545454
4151127,5,B003L77G2Y,"Best season of the show. Capitalizes on the promise of the first two seasons, combining sci-fi nuttiness with heartfelt emotion. Still, does anyone else find it odd that it's apparently Fauxlivia on the cover? Olivia doesn't wear bangs!",1318723200,,236,5.2368421052631575
4151128,5,B003L77G2Y,"J.J. Abrams is a genius.  This is my third favorite show behind Lost and Dexter.  I guess I like shows with short titles.  Just when you start guessing what is coming next, they change all the rules.",1318723200,,199,4.324324324324325
4151129,5,B003L77G2Y,"another excellent season of the fringe. the plots are interesting, entertaining and keep you wanting more.  In each episode you keep thinking what are they going to do next?  They keep surprising you as you continue to watch.  This is an excellent raining day stay in house and do nothing but watch dvds!",1318636800,,304,4.69811320754717
4151130,4,B003L77G2Y,"Series at times gets stranger but it's still the best series on TV. Very character driven, surrounded still with episodes on interest.",1318636800,,134,5.136363636363637
4151131,5,B003L77G2Y,"The dvd was so good. No issues in the dvd. The sender was able to send the dvd even before the scheduled date, I like it!!!",1318464000,,123,3.769230769230769
4151132,5,B003L77G2Y,"This is one of the first shows that hasn't gotten worse with each season...Season 3 has not disappointed, only made me want to watch season 4 even more!!  Its a gotta-see season!",1318464000,,178,4.5625
4151133,5,B003L77G2Y,"I loved fringe season 1 and 2, and at first I thought I might not like this one with the other Olivia switching in and out, but I really did enjoy the whole season, it was very well made, and if you liked season's one and two you will like this one as well.  The LSD episode near the end of the season is AMAZING!!",1318377600,,314,3.830769230769231
4151134,5,B003L77G2Y,The product was new as stated.  The shipment was fast as well.  This is one of the best shows out there.  Highly recommend!,1318377600,,123,4.260869565217392
4151135,5,B003L77G2Y,"The third season is definitely a must have, great acting and stories. Fringe has continued to entertain, amuse, shock and totally take viewers on a roller coaster ride from one week to the next, and each season is better than the last. John Noble is so excellent as the absolutely diabolical but lovable mad scientist Walter that I can't for the life of me understand why Emmy Awards haven't been thrust at him every year. Anna Torv is that rare female actress who appeals equally to men and women, and quite possibly the only female lead on television who dresses appropriately for her job as an FBI agent. Her Olivia is a polished jewel, both beautiful and smart! Joshua Jackson was such a surprise to me because I didn't expect him to be up to the caliber of his castmates, but I was so wrong -- he is brilliant as the super-smart once bad boy Peter. The threesome is surrounded by interesting and quirky characters to fill out the ensemble, especially Lance Reddick as the head of the FBI's Fringe Division, and Jasika Nicole as the utterly delightful Agent and Walter-sitter Astrid, whose name he never seems to remember correctly but always speaks with adoring admiration.",1318204800,,1178,4.723300970873787
4151156,4,B003L77G2Y,Excellent purchasing experience. It was what I had expected and arrived quickly. Fringe is a fun series for those who like mystery and crime series. I highly recommend it.,1318204800,,171,4.931034482758621
4151157,5,B003L77G2Y,"The product arrived on time, and in brand new condition. there were no problems that warranted any such grievances. :",1318204800,,117,4.9
4151158,5,B003L77G2Y,"I was one of the few guilty ones that abandoned Fringe after its first season.  However, on an impulse, I picked up the second and third seasons; it was worth it!  Now I'm front and center every Friday night at 8 and wondering, ""Where is Peter Bishop?""",1318118400,,252,4.340425531914893
4151159,5,B003L77G2Y,"I looked forward to the 3rd season of Fringe, and I was not disappointed.  Watching the episodes in order without ads was a great bonus.  The episodes are well copied and easy to watch.",1318032000,,185,4.411764705882353
4151160,5,B003L77G2Y,have no complaints about this dvd.  It played and was delivered on time and well packaged.  The season is also good.  Has some episodes where it felt like watching a soap opera.,1318032000,,177,4.46875
4151161,5,B003L77G2Y,"This show gets better and better. It is a combination of the old X-Files, one step beyond and a great sense of humor to boot. The characters have been well developed and the story line gets deeper with each season. An excellent show in all respects.",1318032000,,249,4.434782608695652
4151162,3,B003L77G2Y,"The first two years of Fringe was one of the best series ever! Great characters, great scripts, we loved it. Like so many, it has lost its way, and that is too bad. The cartoon episode was the dumbest thing I've ever seen. A couple of the episodes were true to the first two years, but overall, just ok.",1318032000,4,303,4.1525423728813555
4151163,5,B003L77G2Y,"We discovered Fringe early this summer when we bought Season 1 on a clearance sale at a local retailer.  Since then, we've acquired Seasons 2 and 3 - and are now affirmatively hooked.  The series has a very dark (albeit far-fetched) premise - with the structure of the Universe having been damaged by a grief-damaged genius who stole his dead son's exact counterpart from another universe (leaving the matching family childless).  But it makes up for that darkness with a profound sense of humor - mostly involving Walter (John Noble's) quirks and periodic lapses into lunacy.  Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson do a great job at being the new Mulder-Scully combo, and they have a great spark as they solve 'fringe' science mysteries of all types and flavors.

With good writing, good acting, and well-conceived stories - Fringe is great fun for anyone who likes sci-fi/horror entertainment.  As long as you're over 11 or 12 - as there is something disturbing shown at the start of each show (usually involving Walter's bemused smirk as he pokes around in the gooo of some fringe event's detritis)!",1317859200,,1093,4.881081081081081
4151164,5,B003L77G2Y,"I've loved Fringe from the very first episode.  I personally believe that it is the best Sci-Fi TV Series ever. And that's saying a lot, since I absolutely loved Lost. I've also purchased Season 1, and Season 2 of Fringe on DVD.  Highly recommended!",1317859200,,249,4.636363636363637
4151165,3,B003L77G2Y,"For the most part, the series returns to its broad story arc of two parallel universes, one of which is our own, racing to destroy the other before being destroyed by the other. And for the most part, it's fast-paced and action-packed. There is also some incredible acting from Anna Torv and John Noble, two actors I'd never heard of before. Each becomes such a different person in the alternate universe. John Noble, especially, tugs at your heart in one universe. He makes you just want to hug his Walter character, pat him on the back and say, ""That's OK. You didn't mean to pull two universes apart."" His quest for scientific knowledge decades ago did just that. And his portrayal of Walternate (get it? Walter + alternate?) makes you wonder how you could ever have any sympathy for such a cold-hearted bastard.

But there are still some major flaws in the story-telling that all but ruin the series. There are a lot of bad guys that our heroes, the Fringe unit, have to stop. But all too often they figure out who the bad guy is -- or where he will commit his next act of terrorism -- by going to one brainiac or another and asking him/her to solve the puzzle. Which, of course, the brainiac instantly does by telling her questioners to go on the Internet and cross-reference these two or three databases.

Life is really that easy. You can solve all your problems if only you know the two databases you need to call up on the Internet and cross-reference.

The other big problem is all the one-episode plots that have absolutely nothing to do with the story arc. The Fringe division is constantly being called away from saving the world to work on strange mysteries that really have no consequence on anything. There is so much time-wasting in this series, I almost wish the show were on a premium cable channel that only required it to put out 12 episodes a year. Clearly the writers are scraping the bottom of the barrel trying to fill 22 episodes.",1317254400,5,1956,4.551136363636363
4151166,5,B003L77G2Y,"I love sci-fi of all kinds, but I think this TV series is in a class of its own.
John Noble as Walter Bishop is great and the story lines are so ""out there"" it
makes you stop and think. As always quick shipping and customer service.",1317081600,,232,3.9574468085106385
4151167,4,B003L77G2Y,"I LOVE this show, it is bold, intelligent, entertaining.  They did so many interesting things this season and I looked forward to hearing more about it on the DVD but....honestly there was nothing extra.  I have the show, downloaded faithfully from itunes and always look forward to the DVD to get the inside dish but this season it was completely lacking.  Really not much added from the producers and nothing from the actors.  Don't bother to buy Season 3 if you already own it (legitmately, support artists legally) from elsewhere.  Do continue to support the show.  Keep the ratings up so it will be back for Season 5!",1316736000,,622,4.712962962962963
4151168,5,B003L77G2Y,"Fringe season 3 expanded the story arc out so well, a must have for any fan. and if you haven't seen it before pick up seasons 1-3 and watch season 4 starting 9/23/11 at 9pm on FOX",1316390400,,180,3.891891891891892
4151169,3,B003L77G2Y,"i had high hopes for season 3. season1 and 2 were fantastic i couldn't wait for season 3 to come out.

silly me

sex....sex ruined Moonlighting and that first kiss ruined x-files. WHY did the two leads have to fall for each other....and a doppleganger have his kid.

it is ruined.

the very fact that they are in love now is orevekent in every show and seems to be the by line. we couldn't jest get on and tell a story that's been building since dr bishop stole peter...the war between the two universes.

i hear you...the story is even more there since fux-livia has peter's baby and peter will have to choose which universe to save, blah. the show has gone down hill",1316131200,,668,4.354838709677419
4151170,5,B003L77G2Y,"I used to like The X-Files very much. Fringe is ten times better. More interesting characters, Stories, Special effects, and more. There are great puzzles in the story lines that, unlike The X-files, are answered down the road. The level of mystery is excellent and the characters are very likeable. The unpredictability of the show is another bonus. I hope this show goes on for years and years and hopefully they will keep the same level of writing skill.",1315958400,2,457,4.7974683544303796
4151171,5,B003L77G2Y,"Wow. I have been watching Fringe since season 1 and have boughten all of them and will do so for season 4 as well. ( and hopefully the show will continue on to a 5th and 6th season!)  Fringe is THE MOST creative, fascinating, and well made show EVER.  I honestly would like anyone who HAS SEEN the show (it can't just be somebody who has watched one episode and thinks they can judge the show) and thinks there is a better sci-fi episodic tv show to let me know because I will watch it and give it a good fair chance if this person still thinks it is better than Fringe.  I doubt any show is better though.  Fringe is the perfect blend of real science and technology with riveting fiction that captures the viewers attention and leaves them hooked, wanting to watch the next episode, and then the next.  J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, the creators of Fringe, put more work and detail into this show than any other show I've seen.  First of all, they have the observer walking in the background of various scenes, sometimes even so small or for so quick an instant that you have to press pause on your remote to spot him.  The creators also slip in almost unnoticeable clues that relate to the current or future episodes, like a number on a license plate of a random person or a word on a coffee mug that an agent is drinking out of.  The observers and these clues blend into the show as if they were just chosen randomly for background purposes or props but in reality everything is so carefully thought out.  It makes one really appreciate the work that is being put into the show.  All the small details that many people who watch the show probably don't pick up on or notice at all and never will.  There are so many easter eggs (that's what fan sites call the clues) in each episode that I probably have missed a few things myself.  It just shows you how much the creators care about the show, that they are willing to think of small fun details, even when there is a good chance most people won't even see them.  They also have Fringe glyphs before each commercial break (you can find a translator for these glyphs on the internet) and each glyph stands for a letter.  And by the end of the episode, you have a word that relates to the show or the current episode or again a clue for the next one.  None of these little extras are crucial to your understanding of the show, they are just exciting freebies that help the viewer feel more involved in the show and it creates kind of a personal interest in the plot.  Season 3 is definitely my favorite season of the series.  It is by far the most suspenseful and exciting set of episodes so far, in my opinion.  But actually this is all in my opinion haha:)
p.s. a really good website for it you want to follow along with all the Fringe easter eggs and just general fringy talk is [...]",1315872000,6,2854,4.292910447761194
4151172,5,B003L77G2Y,"I got into Fringe halfway through the first season and since then I have been hooked. I've read some great reviews and don't intend to write the same things that others have so I'll just explain why this show is so appealing to me. I rarely watch tv anymore because everything is so predictable. Most shows have a crime that needs to be solved and within the next 30-45 minutes it is solved. Wash, rinse, repeat. Fringe is a new kind of show that has some of the best writing and story elements of any show out there. It's fun to go back to the first season and find all the things you miss the first time around. Some episodes are great as a stand alone story but most of the episodes move the story forward inch by inch. Just when you think you have the answer, they change the question. The characters are very likable. Fringe is the only show that I feel as if by watching it I actually get smarter. Brilliant show! The Blu-ray looks great and has enough extras to keep the disk in your Blu-ray player after all the episodes are done. If you're reading this you are most likely a fan of Fringe already as it has a very loyal fan base. I hope that enough people watch the next season. This is a show that should end on its own, not by the ""Observers"" at Fox.",1315785600,8,1261,4.193415637860082
4151173,4,B003L77G2Y,"Although the third season of ""Fringe"" had some weak episodes the show, on the whole,  was even more challenging than the first two; the series brought the two universes of ""Fringe"" closer together than ever before.

SPOILERS:
When we last left Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv)she was trapped in the OTHER universe replaced in our universe by Fauxlivia (Anna Torv)with Peter(Joshua Jackson), Walter (John Noble) and Astrid (Jasika Nichole) completely clueless that they were being manipulated as part of Walternate's plan to eliminate US.

Walternate has Olivia infused with something that makes her believe she is Fauxlivia so she'll agree to a series of dangerous experiments while Fauxilivia tries to prevent the Fringe team from discovering what Walternate's ultimate goal is.

END OF SPOILERS:

The third season of ""Fringe"" looks exceptionally good on Blu-ray with a crisp, sharp looking presentation. Skin tones and textures look quite nice without the overuse of digital noise reduction.

Keep in mind that the episode ""Subject 13"" looks deliberately soft (they used the effect to soften the wrinkles on actor John Noble since this episode takes place in 1985)but, on the whole, the episodes look sharp and exceptionally good.

Audio is exceptional as well with a nice DTS HD Master Audio mix that's very active during action sequences.

The special features are exceptionally good--we get audio commentary on ""The Plateau"" (disc one), ""OS"" where we get a commentary in ""Maximum Episode Mode"", i.e., a pop up visual commentary allowing us to experience the genesis of the story as it unfolded in the writer's room and through production and a conventional audio commentary on  disc 4's episode ""Lysergic Acid Diethyalmide"" (the episode that's partially animated).

We get a featurette on the production of ""Lysergic Acid Diethylamide"" where we discover for example that the original thought was to animate the episode like ""Yellow Submarine"" (they instead went for a ""Johnny Quest"" style animation using, of course, computer animation). One featurette has an amazingly long title--""Duality of Worlds: The Psychology of Duality, The Other You, Visualizing an Alternate World and A Machine of Destiny"" (wow). ""Constructing an Extra-Sensory Soundscape"" takes you behind-the-scenes into the creation of the sound effects. ""Secrets of Fringe: The First People"" features consulting producers Jeff Pinker and J.H. Wyman discussing these mysterious people who created the machine. They don't exactly let loose with any spoilers.

Finally we get a gag reel for the season as well as network promos.

The third season continues to advance the series story arc in unexpected directions. Recommended.",1315699200,,2687,5.401913875598086
4151174,4,B003L77G2Y,The case was creepy. It tied back in to the Cortexifan trials w/heart-rending results. We get an important and scary look into the future.,1315612800,,138,4.791666666666667
4151195,5,B003L77G2Y,"Fringe, simply put, is amazing.  I would compare it to a modern day X-Files with the freak science etc, but it appeals to a larger community with suspense, the humor, and sci fi.  Very well written and as the seasons have progressed the plot has thickened and we find that our characters are more intertwined than we could have imagined, always bringing me back for more.  I can't wait to see how the plot develops further.  Bravo to J. J. Abrams and the cast.",1315267200,2,460,4.440476190476191
4151196,1,B003L77G2Y,"This show would have been cut long time ago if it was not from JJ Abrams. Terrible show to begin with, totally off the wall but manage to get some good ratings due to its initial time slot. The show's ratings start going downhill once it was move out of the original time slot. But yet it gets renewed year after year while much better shows with better ratings get cut by Fox one after another.",1315267200,3,395,4.2105263157894735
4151197,5,B003L77G2Y,I'd just like to start off by saying that Fringe is the most unbelievably imaginative show I have ever watched and sadly also one that goes mostly unseen. This season was so wonderful and the acting was just mind blowing. I love the story lines and the cast and all the creative aspects of the show. For a show that may not have the biggest or most expensive budget they really make a little go a long way. I just wish people would be more open minded and give the show a chance but what can you expect with a world run rampant with Jersey Shore and 90210. Anyways I think this season was the most compelling and left me with so many questions I can't wait to see answered in the next season (Where is Peter?). This show is one of the few that has developed characters and the relationships between them really shine on the screen and the emotional depth that is shared between them just make it all the more believable. This show is really in it for their fans and not just for the mainstream which is really rare and something you don't really see at all in other shows. I will be ordering two of season 3 (One for my sister and one for me) I can't wait to re watch this amazing series (and to see the awesome special features)and I hope one day the rest of the world (or the Emmy's) will recognize this show and these actor's and all the great acting and writing and emotion that goes into making this show.,1315180800,5,1410,4.225925925925926
4151198,5,B003L77G2Y,"For all those not in the know (and if you truly are not in the know you'll never get to know this show coming in at season 3!), 'Fringe' is an American science fiction TV created by J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci. The series follows a Federal Bureau of Investigation ""Fringe Division"" team based in Boston, Massachusetts under the supervision of Homeland Security.

The team uses unorthodox ""fringe"" science and FBI investigative techniques to investigate a series of unexplained, often ghastly occurrences, which are related to mysteries surrounding a parallel universe.

OK, and before I begin my review, just know that as you yourself watch this captivating TV show on DVD, to keep track of Our world vs. Their world, during the first half of the season, odd-numbered episodes mostly take place in the parallel universe (Their world - and have a red title sequence), while even-numbered episodes mostly take place in the prime universe (Our world - and have the original blue title sequence.)

And then, as we progress through, some episodes (such as 'Entrada') have a title sequence as a mixture of blue and red; and since have been either blue or red or both to signify the universal focus of the episode. Oh, and for episode 15, 'Subject 13' it stands alone in these thoughts for it features a same retro title sequence from 'Peter', with Asimov font and an 80s rendition of the theme song!

Oh, and for the record, 'The Day We Died' has a grey title sequence to indicate the future setting of the episode.

OK, all on track now?! Good, let's continue. In episode one, 'Olivia' we get a flashback to bring us up to date. We see the good Olivia battling in Their world to accept who she is over there and so she tries to find a way home. In 'The Box,' in Our world, the bad Olivia is mixing with everyone as if all was normal, including Peter! A Doomsday device is needed to make a war between the two worlds a reality, but the funniest moment comes when Walter makes a 'silent, but deadly' joke! Also, Dr. Bell (via his Will) leaves him a very nice surprise!

In 'The Plateau,' in Their world, a man can create deadly chain reactions to occur, but why are his targets who they are? In 'Do Shapeshifters Dream of Sheep?', in Our world a Senator is exposed as a Shapeshifter and is now targeted for attack. In 'Amber 31422,' in Their world Amber from a sealing is broken into and a body removed. An old character comes back to say hello! In '6955 khz,' in Our world a radio broadcast is deadly to those listening, but why does it speak numbers over and over - and in different languages each time? Astrid stands up to the mathematical plate here in fine style.

In 'The Abducted,' in Their world, a child is kidnapped by The Candyman - a person stealing (quite literally) their youth! Peter also gets a BIG message delivered to him! In 'Entrada,' Our world the fate of Olivia is revealed to Peter and the real one (finally) comes home. But, in the Olivia timescape swap, a tragedy befalls someone important in one of the worlds. In 'Marionette,' which is quite easily one of the freakiest episodes I have ever seen on TV, a man puts back together a young girl who committed suicide - organ by once-donated organ!

In 'The Firefly,' a brilliant Christopher Lloyd stars as an old rocker from a band that Walter used to love - Violet Sedan Chair! But, his link to Walter runs deeper, way deeper than just music. This episode turns out to be a test set by The Observers. In 'Reciprocity,' the Machine gets built from all the pieces found around the world, but nobody knows how to work it! Walter, trying to regrow back some of the brain that was removed by his counterpart in Their world, tries some Chimp DNA - and so we get a nice moment with a banana split and some ape like gestures! Oh, and Peter becomes a killer! In 'Concentrate and Ask Again,' a toxic biological gas that removes your bones from your body once inhaled is targeting certain people - but why them? A mind reader is brought in and proves to make this an entertaining episode.

 In 'Immortality,' a man and his skelter beetles are causing havoc and bad Olivia aka ""Fauxlivia"" gets some bad news. In '6B,' another highly entertaining episode, a supposedly haunted building could well be another so-called soft spot for a vortex to come through. As for Peter and the real Olivia, well, they finally get together in Our world! In 'Subject 13,' a flashback episode to 1985, Peter and his wife are still at odds over the child they have - Peter, but not 'their' Peter, which he now suspects - and a freaky mind meld of Good vs. Bad worlds come to the fore.

In 'Os,' a liquid metal is stolen to allow a man - the always-great Alan Ruck ('Spin City') to combine with another element to inject into wheelchair-bound people; in the hopes that it will enable them to walk again. Great idea, save for the fact that what he injects them with makes them float!! In 'Stowaway,' Dr. Bell comes back through a ring of a bell, but only his mind, which is now inside Olivia! She even gets to speak like him, but in her own voice - which is pretty sweet and yet weird at the same time (to watch and listen to!) The storyline is one of a female suicide jumper that just cannot die!

In 'Bloodline,' ""Fauxlivia"" is pregnant and kidnapped, has her pregnancy accelerated, and then has her baby in a Chinese food store - it's a long story! But for what true purpose is revealed right at the end. In 'Lysergic Acid Diethylamide,' the gang link up and enter Olivia's mind to try and ""find her"" and get Dr. Bell out and into a computer! This episode is nearly ALL animated and flows just like a comic book. The special features on the creation of the episode say that it normally takes up to a year to create such a thing - and yet for this episode, they only had 4 weeks!

In '6:02 AM EST,' a vortex opens and kills cattle and people on a farm. The Machine sparks into life, without Peter, and so he tries to turn it off himself - not a good idea, as it turns out! ""Fauxlivia"" tries to do something good about the upcoming war, but fails. In 'The Last Sam Weiss,' Peter is recovering, but not quickly and not without residual brain effects. Walter figures out that the Machine has to be moved closer to the one on Their world, which means a huge move to Liberty Island.

In the season ending final episode, 'The Day We Died,' most all of the episode jumps to 2026 - once Peter has strapped himself into the Machine - and it all includes some major shocking news ... and one MASSIVE shock moment you won't want to miss! A confusing ending, for me, it has to be said, but one that is explained on Wikipedia by the writers in their summary of what to expect from Season Four. Oh, and once you hit the red dot on the Episode page, you will get a longer version of the funeral scene! Russell A. Trunk (ExclusiveMagazine.com)",1314662400,2,6879,4.440570522979398

4151200,5,B003L77G2Y,"In season one, ""Fringe"" was a good show with obvious potential for greatness.  In season two, the potential was realized.  And now in season three, it continues to advance to new levels, becoming one of the best drama series on television, and definitely my favourite on network television.  It was often said that ""The X-Files"" was better when it focused on standalone episodes instead of its myth arc, but ""Fringe"" is the exact opposite; its improvement has been deeply tied into the development of its complex and rich ongoing story.  Season Three picks up where Season Two left off, and does so superbly.  Spoilers follow.

Season Two ended with our Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) trapped in the alternate universe, with her counterpart (generally referred to by fans as Fauxlivia) taking her place on the Fringe team as a spy.  Olivia is at the mercy of Walternate, the alternate version of Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble), who is out to prevent the destruction of his universe by destroying ours - though this was all prompted by the actions of our Walter in 1985.  To make matters more complicated, Fauxlivia finds herself in a relationship with Olivia's love interest Peter (Joshua Jackson), while Olivia is brainwashed to temporarily take Fauxlivia's place and enable the other side to gain the secret to how she travels interdimensionally.  And this is all just from the first two or three episodes, out of twenty-two.  There's a tremendous amount happening in ""Fringe"", perhaps more than in any other TV drama series.  By now, this is not a series that can be watched intermittently; it's a commitment (not that that would be an issue if you're buying the DVDs), a heavily-serialized story that plumbs the limts of the plausible and the depths of the human soul with equal skill.  The show effectively has two different worlds running now, each with their own storylines, which interlink in various ways (the ""previouslies"" for each episode valiantly attempt to provide the necessary information to hypothetical first-time viewers).

Consider, for instance, the challenges given to Anna Torv this season:  she plays not just Olivia, but also Fauxlivia, who, despite her fan nickname, is a fully realized character, both the same and different from Olivia; and there are a couple of additional variations thrown in over the course of the year for good measure (including a two-episode stint where she does an extended, amusing impression of Leonard Nimoy).  That the Emmys could overlook her work here speaks very poorly of them.  John Noble as Walter does not have quite the same revelatory year as he did last year, but he continues to provide both tragedy and comedy in good measure.  The biggest winner for this season is Joshua Jackson (who is, ironically, the only major castmember not called on to play an alternate version of himself).  If Peter often seemed a bit out of place when ""Fringe"" was mostly a procedural show, he has become absolutely central to its myth arc.  The rest of the cast does good work in supporting parts, occasionally getting their own moments (I'm a fan of a rare moment of comedy from Lance Reddick in episode 19).

Highly recommended; I can't wait to see what season four brings.",1310601600,4,3219,4.925925925925926

4151205,5,B003L77G2Y,"The writers of FRINGE could never be accused of being like everyone else.  If one is waiting for a predictable plot line with this bunch, forget it.  I cannot say anything of this season's end other than I did not see this cliff hanger coming at all.  And I am now waiting anxiously to see what happens in season 4 to resolve it.  However, this show is having a viewing problem since it changed to Friday nights, i.e. it has lost viewers, so we might be stuck with incredible cliff hangers overall if the ratings don't increase.  That would be a shame because this show is destined to be a big overall keeper for years to come, much like STAR TREK and the THE X-FILES.

Where this show has gone is to increasingly juxtaposition two worlds against one another.  We have to look no further than old SUPERMAN comics to remember the idea that there is more than one universe, that there are alternate universes, with other versions of ourselves on similar paths but their choices cause significant diversions.  A big part of this third season is that Peter romances the Olivia's of BOTH worlds.  This is important because Peter is the pivot around which the two worlds swing since he was stolen from one world to live in the other.

Walter Bishop, Peter's father, is a complete creep in one world as its leader and an eccentric, lovable genius in the other.  The latter role remains my favorite in the whole show.  This is where the humor in the show comes in which is much needed as comic relief.

If you haven't watched FRINGE yet, I recommend you watch it straight through on DVD or streaming, the three full seasons in order.  This series will be almost impossible to watch out of order as the central story line advances in strict linear fashion.  Each series also ends with an incredible cliff hanger which will also work against your seeing it out of order.

4151219,5,B003L77G2Y,"Fringe is simply the best show on TV right now.  I'm an over-65 retired female, not exactly the demographic that a show like Fringe is playing to, but I like my shows complex, dramatic -- yes, even some sci-fi -- a little wacky, and a huge part intelligent writing and excellent acting.  Abrams and his crew of talented writers and producers have done it again, Lost being another of a line of winning series (anyone missing Felicity would be well-advised to take a look at one woman's four years in college).

Fringe has continued to entertain, amuse, shock and totally take viewers on a roller coaster ride from one week to the next, and each season is better than the last.  John Noble is so excellent as the absolutely diabolical but lovable mad scientist Walter that I can't for the life of me understand why Emmy Awards haven't been thrust at him every year.  Anna Torv is that rare female actress who appeals equally to men and women, and quite possibly the only female lead on television who dresses appropriately for her job as an FBI agent.  Her Olivia is a polished jewel, both beautiful and smart!  Joshua Jackson was such a surprise to me because I didn't expect him to be up to the caliber of his castmates, but I was so wrong -- he is brilliant as the super-smart once bad boy Peter.  The threesome is surrounded by interesting and quirky characters to fill out the ensemble, especially Lance Reddick as the head of the FBI's Fringe Division, and Jasika Nicole as the utterly delightful Agent and Walter-sitter Astrid, whose name he never seems to remember correctly but always speaks with adoring admiration.

If you haven't watched Fringe yet, I recommend watching it from the very beginning. There has been a long, enjoyable and steady build-up from the first episodes of Season 1 to where we are now at the end of Season 3, and I promise you will enjoy the ride!",1304380800,116,1881,4.607784431137724

I decided to give it another try and watched the first season.  I was totally hooked.  It is the best TV show ever as far as I am concerned and I loved Lost (until the end), Battlestar Gallactica, Prison Break and Dexter.  To me what makes Fringe so enjoyable is the way they play with the graphics and create the world the characters live in.  In the episode from the 80's they changed the opening credits to look like credits from the 80's and when they went to the other side, the Fringe opening credits were different enough to make you curious.  That is so clever and I have never seen anything like that.  I love the science it is understandable and fascinating.  I love Peter, I know a lot of people don't like him because of Dawson's Creek, but I never saw Dawson's Creek and I think he and Walter are the most interesting characters on the show.  I also love Olivia she is a hell of an actress, her face is so expressive and I am a big fan of Charlie Francis.  I am glad they brought him back.

Then there's John Noble who plays Dr Walter Bishop, again amazing, he to plays two different versions of the same character, and again very well, there is a huge difference in our Walter and Walternate as we Fringies call him, our Walter is sweet, and kind, even if he is bit odd at times,talking about strange things all the time, he is a bit nutty, but lovable, Walternate has a coldness in his eyes, and is not at all lovable,and you can again tell who is who by there eyes,its wonderful to watch. Then there is Joshua Jackson, who again very good actor, never watched Dawson's Creak, maybe seen a few episodes but never cared for that type of show, so if you didn't care for it ether and decided not to like him because he was in it, that would be not only unfair but stupid too, because he is a very good actor, though he may not be my favorite on the show,I would still miss him if he wasn't in it,the fact is every character and actor on this show is great, even the bad guys are cool in this show, I love the character of Nina Sharp who runs Massive Dynamics, and is plays by Blair Brown also a great actress,she is a very cool character, even has a robotic right arm that looks like a real one,then there's Phillip Broyles, Played by Lance Reddick, another great actor,his character is always cool,and always there for his agents not like Skinner on The X Files,Skinner was wimp, Broyles will stick neck out for his people even giving his life to save another,then there's Astrid Farsworth a young FBI agent who works with and sometimes takes care of Walter, who is played by Jasika Nicole, she too plays tow versions of her character very well, some people put this show down saying it should focus more on just having the character investigate different cases each week, instead of having a on going story line,with romance,and comedy,and twists and turns that make you have to really pay good attention to the show, and stories that is about real stuff not just the weird stuff, but that is why this show is so great is it is not your run of the meal science fiction show,these people are more like real people, not cartoons like in allot science fictions shows, the X Files was like that, every episode was different,it never went with the myth of the show,that show ended after 9 years and never did explain what was really going on, even Gillian Anderson who played Scully admitted later she didn't really understand what had happened, or what it was about,to me it was almost as bad as Lost was, Fringe though is not like that, each episode even the so called stand alone's tie in to the myth of the show, almost all the weird science being used by bad people is something Walter had made and someone stole form him while he was in a mental hospital, so you can't get lost,it really like watching a movie that has 40 some hours long, but instead its a series of one hour shows that just happen to be the best hour on TV, Its right now on FOX at 9pm on Fridays, check it out, if you want to watch older episodes there plenty of sites where you can catch up on it that are free,or just buy seasons one and two here, because I swear on my own life you want be sorry, you will love every episode, and every character and actor on this show, it is addictive its so good! 5 stars for all seasons!!!",1300752000,3,4446,4.344951923076923

4151242,4,B003L77G2Y,"I know I will take flak from fanatics for giving Fringe only 4 stars, but I have my reasons.

First off the good: Fringe is perhaps one of the best Sci-Fi serials to come down the pike in a long time. It has all the potential to become another X-Files, and all of the dangers to fail where Chris Carter did too.

Carter became to preoccupied with making his show into a propaganda platform on every conceivable issue, and the shows storyline suffered as a result; and for conservatives like myself, it was especially a turn-off.
Another mistake Carter made I see the producers of Fringe beginning to do, is focusing far too much on one character to the detriment of the others. As X-Files became the ""All About Scully Saga"", so too is Fringe in danger of becoming all about Olivia.
The best Sci-Fi stories make use of COMMON folk the audience can identify with, and once having established them as such; THEN putting them into nearly unbelievable circumstances.
Giving our characters super-natural powers approaching deities will only ruin the story via making suspension of disbelief impossible.

On that last point we have the utterly unbelievable circumstance where Walter, still on parole from a Mental Institution, is apparently allowed free reign to go about creating his own cocktails of illegal drugs and regularly consuming them on the show! It truly would be an alternate universe where FBI agents allowed such to take place under their noses. NO, totally unbelievable.

4151268,4,B003L77G2Y,"Fringe has come a long way since of season one, which was often a confusing multitude of open plot threads. Season 2 brought the show into focus and streamlined the ""over here"" / ""over there"" concept, which season 3 is making great use of in alternating episodes. The downside, however, is that the ""over there"" team is far less interesting, and without the quirky charm and dark humor of the Walter / Peter/ Astrid pairing, those episodes really seem to drag for me. Anna Torv's acting has improved since the show's inception, but I still prefer the original ensemble episodes and hope the writers start giving the supporting cast more to do again.

Also, I want to address the complaints about quality and failed downloads... I've never had any problems with Unbox, and have used it for multiple TV series. The quality really does seem to be better than iTunes, and the download speeds comparable if not greater.

I ordered Primeval, which, unbeknownst to me, labels it's episodes numerically, and when you're not familiar with the Tivo dl-ing process, results in Episode 1 season one being listed immediately before Episode 1 season two with NO differentiation as to which is which. When I order a season, I'd like to GET the season, not just the first episode. Why do I have to waste time specifying that I want every episode for a season after having ORDERED the WHOLE SEASON?

Sci-Fi shows always struggle to gain viewers. This is not your ordinary sci-fi. Anna Torv is not only beautiful, but very talented, as is Joshua Jackson. The real treat though is John Noble.

4151295,4,B003L77G2Y,"Unlike ""Neal - the Gadget Guy"" my experience with Amazon VOD and iTunes was different. I downloaded the Olivia HD episode from both services to compare quality and was a little surprised. First, I should mention that I used a Windows XP HTPC to download the files, I did not stream. The size of the video files: the VOD was around 1.9GB while the iTunes version was 1.4GB. The Amazon VOD picture quality was superior on my system with better color, contrast and deeper blacks, the iTunes version appeared somewhat washed out in comparison. This could have been a one-off experience so I'm not sure if this is a fair comparison. But I do know one thing the iTunes version which plays on Quicktime was a bad experience! It stuttered frequently and the picture would freeze for several seconds before resuming. I Googled around the internet looking for a solution to the iTunes video problem and found that it is a fairly common one. The most consistent solution offered was to upgrade your computer hardware, in Apple's fine print: ""2.0GHz Intel Core 2 Duo or faster processor is required to play HD video"". I guess my machine is fine for playing standard definition iTunes videos but not HD. Meanwhile the HD Amazon VOD played flawlessly in the Unbox Video Player which is a tailored Windows Media Player 11 along with Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0. I could not play either file on third party players (VLC, GOM, etc.) because of the imbedded Digital Rights Management (DRM) copy protection. YMMV.",1293840000,4,1495,4.7984496124031

They did a great job of casting Anna Torv, Joshua Jackson, and the real star of the show...John Noble.  That guy is awesome.

I will say that to truly enjoy this season you need to have more backstory.  You probably need to at least watch the back half of season 2 to appreciate season 3.

4151300,5,B003L77G2Y,"Fringe is the show that rocks the cradle of televisions Twilight into the mysterious.  Most of my own experiences with theoretical science is as much along the fringe as was most people, I knew, who knew of Einstein Theory of Relativity.  Most people haven't had a page of information from any of Great Thinkers on the level since most text from geniuses is complex and only bookish science minded students of the arts and sciences read the entire text of people like Plato.  Works of Jules Verne are even edited for the same reasons.  Some people still don't even know about some scientific reasoning unless it was from a movie.
The first movie I actually saw in the local theater I would call a Sci-Fi movie was, ""Forbidden Planet.""  I was dropped off, by myself.
My parent's, sister's and brother's did not see it.  After I did see it all my talk about it got that, ""We don't know what you're talking about."" look.  I still wanted a pal like Robby the Robot.
FRINGE, the television show, is a show of a quality which barters with scientific studies.  The kind of studies I have had a little bit more of since I began studying Ancient Philosopher's.  Most people I talked to don't realize that Atlantis was written about, FOR REAL, centuries ago.
I found a collection of books at the library which has over 60 books that carry on the fascinating words of thought which extends from as far back as Aristotles' teachers time and up to modern times.
(I understand why more people don't watch, FRINGE.
FRINGE could go on for 30 centuries using the addition of thoughts from all the great philosopher's.  Their works could be converted into fascinating probabilities which is what FRINGE is all about.  I don't know who started the works of, ""The Great Conversation"" The Substance of a Liberal Education. By Robert M. Huthchins  I found the complete set from around 1994 set 1- 54. ""Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Plato and on to the 54th book on FREUD.  All at the local library.  I have seen the latest collection that is provided by Britannica called, ""The Great Conversation""  a. k. a. ""Great Books of the Western World"" and more books added on the set; a good number more.  All of whom we are more familiar in the 20th centuries bunch of modern philosophers.
Their knowledge is about that which is on the Fringe of Society.

If the 'verse is willing, it won't peter-out like X-Files, or disappear due to low TV ratings like Max Headroom or Serenity. Having a whole new season to watch at your own pace, w/o having to wait each week for a particular night & time, is the best. There should be some form of ratings credit for that kind of fan.

i have enjoyed every episode of this wonderful show (minus the glee spinoff) and cant wait for it every week, there is only one thing i am sad about though.

Thats the fact that this very well may be the last season. i really wish it wasnt, but i have a strong feeling that season 4 will never come. it makes me so sad that so many people won't give this show a shot, it really needs more viewers than its already got.

This started off as a promising, good show three years ago but nothing that made you think it would be fantastic by its third season.  Well, that is where we are now in the third season.  I just watched this episode and I was riveted to the screen throughout.  First, Olivia has turned into being a far stronger character than I ever imagined back in season one.  She is marooned over in the parallel world and no one back in her usual world knows an impostor has taken her place.  This fake Olivia is very sinister and has an agenda. The real Olivia is going through hell and even goes into an isolation tank where she is given huge amounts of psychotropic drugs.  Additionally, she has begun having regular hallucinations of seeing Peter.  Her nemesis of course is the alternate Walter in this other world and he is a very sinister character indeed.

As an aside, I was recently astounded to see the actress playing Olivia in an earlier British tv series.  Thus, I found out she is a British actress with the accent and all.  This series was the first season of MISTRESSES.
