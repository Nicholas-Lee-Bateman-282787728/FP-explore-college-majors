8108174,3,B0009AJRR8,"The first time I saw this movie was on HBO years ago. I was disappointed to see that the film on the VHS cassette appeared to have been edited and some of the fleshy parts diminished, not what I would have expected from Playboy. The plot is about a young film director trying to convince his reluctant wife to play a nude scene in his new film to bring in a bigger audience. The usual plot twists and movie cliches, but some beautiful women undressed.",1351728000,,451,4.317647058823529
