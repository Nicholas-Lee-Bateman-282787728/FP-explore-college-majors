2002724,5,B0001HYDCS,"I've been working out at home for 10 years and this is the most fun, innovative workout I have seen in some time.  It is totally different from anything else out there.  The music is awesome and the length (45 minutes) is just right for me.  JAC is a very motivating, likable instructor.  I've been getting tired of the same old stuff out there.  Thankfully this workout has come along and revitalized my routine.
Challenging for advanced exercisers this workout includes lot's of innovative core work mostly with a stability ball and interesting use of a paper plate.  Great results are achieved in 45 minutes without endless reps.  Buy this one, you won't regret it.",1078531200,,668,4.756521739130434
2002725,5,B0001HYDCS,"This is the best core work out I have ever done.  I never new I was in such bad shape.  Jeanne Anne is so great and the work out is so much fun.  It is different from anything out there.  It is so challenging.  The day I can master the "" Tick Tock"" move will be a very happy day for me.",1078444800,,286,3.5483870967741935
2002726,5,B0001HYDCS,"This workout is an amazingly tough stability ball workout that will produce true core strength and help flatten those abs.  The music is fantastic, and Jeanne Anne simply shines as an instructor.  At about 45 minutes long, this is a efficient effective workout that is very different from what's out there in the current home video workout world.  You will not regret buying this!",1078358400,,380,4.90625
2002727,5,B0001HYDCS,"This is an amazing, innovative and fun workout with a huge focus on the core area. Jeane Anne is a doll on camera - she's so sweet you almost forget that your abs and inner thighs are on fire! The stability ball work is very unique and extremely challenging - once you get the balance part perfected you move on to balance with motion, taking the workout to another level entirely. There's definitely enough cardio to get your heart pumping, as well. I've been doing this workout for about a month and have seen much more definition in my waistline and a hint of a 6-pack forming!",1078185600,4,580,4.429906542056075
8012747,5,B0001HYDCS,"This work out is hard to find. It took me a few months before i was able to purchase it.

The draw backs-
The set quality is terrible. Just saying that straight up. It's got a curtain hung in a garage look to it. Miss JAC has issues with her lefts and rights and rarely gets them right when cueing.

Positives-
JAC is amazingly good at cueing (besides the left and right part I mentioned). She gives really good pointers on form, and is very warm in her style. She tells you which muscle group to focus on, and how to make each move happen. She doesn't just tell you to ""focus hard!"" which so many instructors seem to say, and means nothing.. ""focus on what?"". None of that with miss JAC! She's fantastic.

The whole thing is short and sweet. It's very hard, but is worth while. It makes all your work outs better, and has done a real make over on my tummy. I've been doing it every other work out, as recomended. It's made a real difference.

If you do get the chance to buy it, do it. Just know that the first time you do it, you'll be chasing your ball all over, and falling off constantly. It gets better. It's one you have to practice at it is totally worth it. You'll have great results.",1233792000,,1193,4.173913043478261
8012748,4,B0001HYDCS,At first I did not think that this workout would get my hear rate up.  I was so wrong!  This video really works your core muscles and balance.  I have yet to get through this workout without falling off my stability ball!  It will take my a while before I master this workout!  It is a great workout and I highly recommend it for someone who wants to improve their core strength and balance.,1083715200,2,391,4.22972972972973
8012749,5,B0001HYDCS,"This tough workout focuses on building the muscles in the core region (from trunk to hips) using whole body exercises (not just ab crunches).
Most of this workout is done on the stability ball, or while using a medicine ball.  The few standing/equipment free moves are also fun--for example, Charlie's Angels, where you do twists and dips while pointing your fingers in a ""gun"" shape.  It's fun and different, and distracts me from just how hard this workout is.
The workout works the whole core region and is *very* aerobic.  Serious calories are burned.  This is a workout to grow with--I haven't mastered every move, but each workout I improve.
Important notes:
You can't do this workout in a tiny space.  The ball just requires a bit of space.  I have a ten by ten area and that's plenty.  I wouldn't want to go smaller.
You must have at least the stability ball.  I have substituted a play ball for the medicine ball (so I can use lighter weights).
The production quality is...well, okay.  The set looks kind of like a basement rec room with black curtains for walls.  This is not a lush set a la the Firm, or even the Method. The music is fine, and the cuing is good.  Just don't expect it to be perfect.
My only real complaint  is that this workout could really have used some stability ball FAQs for those of us who've never done it before.  Still, they've marketed this to advanced exercisers, so I haven't held it against them.",1080604800,7,1437,4.523255813953488
8012750,5,B0001HYDCS,"Wow! What an intense core workout. I had such a blast attempting Core Foundations for the first time that my husband said, ""Hey, that looks fun. Let me try it."" Now we are BOTH hooked. I'm going to have buy him his own stability ball. He keeps stealing mine! My core is getting so much stronger.  This is an AWESOME workout, fun and challenging!",1080086400,2,345,4.390625
8012751,5,B0001HYDCS,"This video is, in a word, excellent. If they had stock, I would buy right now. Remember how Pilates used to not be a household name? People couldn't even pronounce it.  This series from TLP is the new Pilates.  I, for one, will buy every single thing they put out!!
Jeanne Anne is awesome. I've been lucky enough- being a Charleston native- to take many classes from Tracie, Jeanne Anne, Bonnie, and Susan Harris. JA's warmth and personality comes out just like she was in the room with you.  Cuing is excellent, and the music is perfect.
This will absolutely change the way we excercise. If you want real results and change and fun and hard work, get this video!!!!",1079222400,,666,4.533333333333333
8012752,5,B0001HYDCS,"As a faithful FIRM customer, I was thrilled to see former FIRM instructor Jeanne Anne Coplestin as the lead of a new workout video.

8012753,5,B0001HYDCS,This is an excellent video!! I have been working out at home for years and this is really what I need to get that extra edge! The core work is fabulous! JAC is motivating and inspirational. And it is fun! My goal is to get through this video without modifications! I highly recommend it!,1078704000,,287,4.333333333333333
8012754,5,B0001HYDCS,"This video is great for core work.  Not only does it work the core, but it also works muscles that I didn't even know were involved in core work.  In addition you sweat like nobody's business.  I highly recommend this workout for anyone wanting to reach new heights in their exercise routine.  This tape is for the beginner & seasoned exerciser alike  :)",1078704000,,354,4.555555555555555
8012755,5,B0001HYDCS,"I have been working out for well over 10 years and really didn't think there was anything new out there to give my body a shock.  Boy, this workout sure did!  With only a medicine ball and a stability ball, my core was worked until it screamed.  And I certainly didn't master the moves my first time.  These moves are so innovative, there is a learning curve.  And balance is constantly tested. Anyone can do a bicep curl, here it takes a strong core to perform these moves with proper form.  JAC's personality shines through and I love this workout more each time I do it!",1078617600,,573,4.3584905660377355
