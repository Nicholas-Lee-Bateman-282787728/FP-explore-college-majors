8328326,3,B001NY42L0,"This Afterglow 2 DVD set is a little misleading. This package has the Afterglow cardboard sleeve, but inside the package is the previously released DVD sets for Reflections: Genesis on Genesis (DVD+Book) and Inside Genesis 1975-1980 DVD. These are unsanctioned DVDs with some live footage, but no complete songs, a few band interview clips, and a lot of interview commentary by people who were not in Genesis. Its ok for a die hard fan, but the casual fan might think this is something different than it really is. Its a documentary with a few interview clips and bootleg video snippets thrown in for good measure - nothing more.",1273536000,27,629,4.833333333333333
