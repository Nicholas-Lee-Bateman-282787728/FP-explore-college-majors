2208019,5,B0007CEXYK,"The storyline is the type of thing you find on a Lifetime Network Special or a straight-to-television movie trying to warn about the dangers of drug addiction, but this movie goes so far beyond that. It's not like it adds zany warped realities like Requiem for a Dream or it has some sort of narration keeping the audience completely informed that ""this is what you should fear to be"", it does everything so much simpler than that: It sits back and lets the actors eat the audience's collective heart out.

The drama in this film is SO UTTERLY CONVINCING. The performances get first prize for portrayals that, even when you want to try and find something wrong with it (I'm guessing this film might be considered too sentimental by some), keep the drama serious and prominent, not allowing the audience to let go of their suspension of disbelief. If it wasn't for the production quality, it would seem like this was a documentary and these were real people. And it's not just Ana and Michael, the two main characters, it's everyone, from the boyfriends to the crack addicts that have two seconds of screen time to everyone.

Secondly, the cinematography and editing are very well tuned to excellence. This movie definitely has the feel of an independent film, but more than that it doesn't have that ""Look at me, I'm independent!"" feel. Skewed angles and purposeful jump cuts exist stylistically in the film, but they come at the right times and are completely necessary, versus what tends to happen in a lot of independent cinema where the camera becomes relatively self-conscious and goes places it needn't. For example, the hand-held quality of this film is almost invisible, while some independent films tend to show off their independence via hand-held in a wannabe cinema-verite sort of conceit.

It's disappointing that I haven't heard anything about this film before. I literally picked it up because it was the first movie on the first row of the first aisle to rent because I wanted to surprise myself, and whadyaknow but it happened to be a real gem! I hope it builds a bigger audience because it deserves to be recognized.

2208020,4,B0007CEXYK,"First of all, this isn't a big budget film. It's not striving for Oscars or any of the other Hollywood fodder. It's an honest film about one woman's hell of addiction. Secondly, if you are looking for a happy, feel good, life-is-so-wonderful movie, blow smoke up yer a** movie, look elsewhere.

Having said that....

This is a very powerful film. Afterwards I felt a lot of different things, but the most prevalent was thankfulness. You see, I came out of this life myself 10 years ago and believe it or not, I forgot just how fortunate I am to be alive and to have survived countless life threatening experiences. At the end I found myself, a grown man, crying like a baby because I was so moved personally and just by the film itself as a whole. As dark as the film was at times, there was many touches of compassion and glimpse of the human spirit just trying to survive and figure it all out.

I highly recommend this film if you want to watch something that will open your eyes to the world around you and have a greater understanding of what it's like to live in the abyss of drug addcition. Hopefully after watching the film you wll have a greater appreciation for life itself.",1129075200,13,1184,4.422018348623853
2208021,5,B0007CEXYK,"Simply stated, this movie is brilliant. Beautifully directed and acted, it is one of the few movies (out of hundreds I've seen) that made me cry. It is an emotional powerhouse film, graphically portraying the horrid drug addiction that terribly afflicts a young woman's life, and consequently those who care for her. ""Acts of Worship"" is honorable in it's truly honest depiction of life as an addict, it doesn't sugar-coat anything. It definitely is an important film to see if you, like me, have it pretty good for the most part but all too often forget to count your blessings, get caught up in petty upsets and lose perspective. Great movie.",1124668800,19,644,4.8108108108108105
2208022,5,B0007CEXYK,I don't watch to many independent films but this one caught my eye.  Its a great movie about a girl in NYC living a life of troubles and drug addiction.  Digna (Michael Hyatt) takes Alix (Ana Reeder) into her life and shows her how life could be if she got clean.  The acting is great and the script is bealivable.  This film is meant to reach you whether or not you have done drugs.

I got attached to the characters (especially Alix the main character) and would love to see the directer portray her story of getting clean.

The movie gives viewers a look at the horrors of addiction, but only the slightest of Hinting that recovery is possible if you concede need for help, I believe, literally, in less than 4 minutes at the end of the movie; it was probably closer to 2 minutes, with no clear idea as to any recovery process.  I was very disappointed, thinking it would be about addiction, yes, but mainly about recovering from it: Big Mistake.

2208080,4,B0007CEXYK,"DVD picture and sound excellent, standard aspect ratio.  Story concerns a young woman struggling to overcome her addiction with the help of a recovering addict.  Based partly on the writer/director's experience with addiction in her youth.  The movie was recommended by some viewers of Requiem for a Dream.  It is not as melodramatic as RFAD, nor as gritty as ""Panic in Needle Park"" but still very interesting.  I'd almost call it a chick flick drug movie because the two lead characters are female, and the focus is on female addicts.  There are some graphic scenes of drug use and considering the subject matter, a lot of profanity.  It does not glorify drugs at all, but does a great job of showing the shallow desperation addicts live day to day.  The stealing, lying, loss of self esteem, and cold exploitation of the weak is depressing to watch, but at the same time very believable.  Some of the actors look too clean cut to pass for junkies, but Ana Reeder does a pretty good job at it and in fact practically carries the film.  It's too bad that something tragic has to happen to somebody to force them to change their ways, but again that is reality, and this Indie film conveys that very well.",1382572800,3,1204,4.610328638497653

2208082,4,B0007CEXYK,"The acting in this movie is superb. Both of the leads (Michael Hyatt and Ana Reeder) did a fantastic job. Michael Hyatt starred as a recovering addict whose photography career is just beginning to take off. Ana Reeder starred as a young woman addicted to crack and heroin on her way to bottoming out.

The interaction between these characters is nothing short of electric. Be forewarned, however, this story is gritty and quite bleak. There are no winners when it comes to addiction. There are just survivors.",1378166400,,509,4.850574712643678

Her life takes a tumble when she overdosed and was thrown out of her ex boyfriends apt left for dead.... until someone saw her, and from there on, the movie becomes the life of an addict getting help from....a recovering addict.

2208124,1,B0007CEXYK,"This movie, in my opinion, is over-hyped. I have watched lots of documentaries on drug use and lots of touching movies that stir your soul. Clearly these writers tried to do both, but it just did not come across.  The acting, the entire time, felt like I was watching actors practicing their parts. Of course, they are just actors, but the viewer (hopefully) can lose themselves in the scenes..not with Acts of Worship.

What you do get: lots of drug use and users with clear skin, lots and LOTS AND LOTS of dropping the F bomb (their effort at gritty) and many scenes where you can almost hear the violin in the background..hoping to make cheesy scenes more sincere.

A woman is a recovering drug addict and finds a user (current addict) outside her apartment door. Of course we assume the user is going to give up drugs but it will be a hard battle. Okay..forget the hard battle. It's just so pretty!

I don't want to give anything away, so let's just say that while there are scenes that could have been sad or moving or tense..they were just predictable and weakly acted.
