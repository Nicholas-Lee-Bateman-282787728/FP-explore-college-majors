8591733,5,B0011EDM5O,"Let me preface this review by saying that I was a host of this highly acclaimed underground podcast.

Okay. I might be a bit biased, but overall the DVD was worth the purchase.

Originally you could have obtained almost all of this content for free when it was published, however within the last few years the original content distribution mediums have become defunct. Websites have came, and gone since 2006, including the original publication location. This DVD is the only option for people who have lost old episodes, or have missing podcast in their collection.

Looking back on this content I shake my head, smirk, and then smile. Overall the quality of the podcast was terrible, but the content was topnotch. The podcast was funny, informative, and real. The opinions the host had were from real people, fans themselves, not out for a dollar, but for the enjoyment themselves.

The movie itself was well edited, and provided a great momentary glimpse of the host.

Ironically, the host thoughts on last generation consoles (PS3, WII[Revolution], and Xbox360) were mostly spot on, with small exceptions.

The content is for sure dated, but it is something special to have a (almost) complete gaming news archive from this time period.

The best portions of the DVD would be the bonus content; sketches, songs, and other assorted works by several of the host.

Do yourself a favor, and purchase this gem before it completely disappears from the internet.

(I have not received any kickbacks from this product, and was not paid for this review.)

Personal updates since the show finished production:

I went off to university following the last real episode. I graduated Spring 2011 with my Bachelor of Science majoring in Information Technology - Networking, and have been working in related fields since graduation.

Sadly I have mostly lost contact with the other host after departing for college, but would be interested in a reboot if the opportunity ever arose.
