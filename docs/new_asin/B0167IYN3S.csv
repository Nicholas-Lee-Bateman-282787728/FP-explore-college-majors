8735772,2,B0167IYN3S,"Good premise to make people aware, but so poorly executed.  There are so many games, so many fails--it feels like a bad reality show.

The ""Jones"" family was probably paid to be in this. Their drama was absolutely ridiculous and so many stages scenes it was exhausting.

The family agreed to put into storage their items made in China, and to not buy anything made in China for the month of December.

First, they are traumatized about not having Christmas lights this year. Then they are horrified that buying a child's wishlist, but ""Made in America"" could cost so much. I kept asking, ""Are these seemingly educated people really this clueless?"". They don't have to celebrate Christmas for a purpose, but it amazes me that their materialism is so utterly apparent more than even any sort of ""goodwill toward neighbors"". Yet, they read a ""Christmas"" passage from the Bible--their first mention of anything remotely related to religion.

Me. Jones wore the badge of honor that his dad was a fighter pilot--but my guess is that his ""patriotism"" stopped there. He was So upset he couldn't play X-Box that while his wife and kids went to a church service that appeared to be their first experience ever, he got the X-Box out of storage to use it--claiming he ""could"" have not done it if he wanted to.

Them they talked about how hard Christmas was this year (???) because in the past 5 years they have lost family members. So Mr. Jones got all glum about how it was so hard for him--my mother's funeral was 10 days before this past Christmas--but I held it together for our family.

Then they show up at the Chinese film producer's home, with some ""soap opera random illness"", but the Chinese father saves the day by doing acupuncture on them.

Mr. Jones was like a spoiled overgrown adolescent, and Mrs. Jones was like a helpless, clueless girl.

At first, Mr. Jones was anti-China, but later states he is mad at the companies that send their products over to China to be made.

The producer, ""Tom"", tries to feel like he doesn't know if he is more American or more Chinese.

I think with all their whining about giving up things, they had p-l-e-n-t-y of money and could easily have been happy enough with what they had, or what they got as a replacement.

Excellent idea of a movie for people to become aware of where things are made, whether they feel convicted to boycott certain countries' merchandise, or just want to be educated. I didn't feel any more educated or moved to either side, which used to be the point of documentaries. But it was mildly entertaining (when it wasn't annoying!) Whole I got household chores done.",1524355200,,2628,4.652267818574514
8735773,5,B0167IYN3S,Loved this documentary. It truly brings a perspective on China items.,1493424000,,69,5.363636363636363
8735774,4,B0167IYN3S,"When a young filmmaker from China hears complaining about toxic toys from China he is taken aback. He aspires to find a family who could live for a month (December) without anything from China.  He finds a family and they aspire to live without by putting all their things from China into storage.

Meanwhile, the guy's parents want to have a big American-style Christmas. Shows the differences in the cultures and the expen$e$. Insightful. Some sub-title.",1467676800,,456,4.9868421052631575
8735775,5,B0167IYN3S,"My family enjoyed this so much. My dad was a union guy for many years and was preaching about the trade imbalance w/ China and buying American products long before it was cool, so this resonated w/ us.",1460764800,2,201,4.315789473684211
8735776,5,B0167IYN3S,"I watched it before I bought it. Wanted my daughter to see it, too. The movie is extremely tender and touchy, and it provokes a lot of thoughts. Including ones of the US dependence on outside manufacturers.",1452384000,,206,4.594594594594595
8735777,5,B0167IYN3S,"This first time film by young filmmaker Tom Xia -born in China and living with his parents in Arcadia, CA (50% white; 50% Chinese immigrants) and two friends - really covers two subjects. Its not a preachy documentary in any way and yet conveys its message. Its short (at 63 minutes) and often funny at times. Xi has a great youthful personality.

The basic premise of the film is that Xia  after hearing complaints from people (customers at his parents gift shop) complain about unsafe toys and inferior goods being imported from China - tries to find at least one family in his community who would consider removing EVERY item made in China from their home for the 25 days leading up to Christmas. Believe it or not he does and the family of four soon finds themselves with a LOT of things they didn't know were made in China. ( I never realized there are NO coffee makers which are made in America, did you?  I won't give spoilers here of other things.

While I give Xia credit for a really good film, I give the family he found, more props for being involved. The mother in the family  a former school teacher  could easily win a mother of the year award for how she raises her two children!

The parallel story is about how Xias father (as well as many of the Chinese immigrants in their community) want to live the American Dream and build big AMERICAN style houses and spend thousands to decorate for Christmas (which the Chinese DONT celebrate!  they have Chinese New Year).

I see three reviews here from 2014 which are apparently from an out-of-print 2013 release. My review is based on the 2015 release coming December 8, 2015. I was provided an advance screener for an objective review.

The film is in English and Chinese and the English subtitles were easy to read for me (a rarity). No bonus features are on the DVD.
The film won awards at a lot of Film Festivals (mostly as audience favorite). I would recommend it to anyone.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8735779,5,B0167IYN3S,"This film explores cultural identity wonderfully.  What does it mean to be an American in a global economy?  What does it mean to be a Chinese-American, or anything-American?",1419120000,2,174,5.178571428571429
8735780,5,B0167IYN3S,"Xmas Without China provides a very entertaining peek into the lives of two very different American families during the holiday season. One family accepts the audacious challenge of celebrating Christmas without any products made in China (goodbye XBox, coffee maker and light bulbs!) while the other family pursues their American dream while struggling to reconcile their new country's often unflattering views of their old- China. The film is thought-provoking, educational and hilarious and a must-see family movie around the holidays!",1416960000,2,537,5.725
