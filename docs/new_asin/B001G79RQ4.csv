8304229,3,B001G79RQ4,"UGLY AUR PAGLI (Ugly and Crazy) tells of the unusual relationship between an engineering student and a girl he meets on a train platform. It's a Bollywood romantic comedy, but even more than that, it's just an odd movie. By the way, ""Ugly"" is the guy and ""Crazy"" is the girl, but all that is made obvious early on.

If you're a dude like Kabir and your parents had dressed you up as a girl when you were a baby, well, you're gonna have issues. Kabir has grown up into a pushover, a doormat in life. And when he prevents the inebriated Kuhu from getting flyswatted by an onrushing train, he doesn't know what he's letting himself in for. Without exactly knowing how, Kabir finds himself a lot in the accompany of the girl he'd just saved. Kuhu, it turns out, is a self-absorbed nutcase who seems to enjoy bullying Kabir around. Kabir thinks her ""fun and unpredictable"" but all I see is her slapping him around a whole bunch of times.

Thru the course of the film, she makes him do very uncool things like walk around in high heels and ride bicycles with no seat. Dude even goes to prison because of her (okay, it was just an overnighter). What with the mortifying hell she put him thru, I guess it was only natural a naive git like him would fall in love with her.

Bollywood's stock in trade is the remake. This one remakes the excellent 2001 South Korean romantic comedy titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Sassy-Girl-2001/dp/B000FTDVCK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Sassy Girl (2001)</a>&nbsp;(or ""Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo""). But, in UGLY AUR PAGLI, something got lost in the translation. Because it's simply not as good and, with its quirkiness, it definitely isn't to everyone's taste. There's a breezy feel to the film, though, which keeps things going, even if there's not much to the story. Narrated almost vignette-like, the film focuses on those encounters between Kuhu and Kabir, almost to the exclusion of everyone else. UGLY AUR PAGLI is made watchable mainly on the strength of the understated Ranvir Shorey, who has the skills to make his wimpy, henpecked character interesting. Ranvir doesn't have your classical leading man looks, but he can act. He's good enough that I didn't even rail too much at his character's overt passiveness and emasculation.

Unfortunately, Mallika Sherawat, as beautiful as she is, really is limited as an actress. Mallika trying to do drama is like Ajay Devgan trying to dance. Bad things happen. The film's main female character Kuhu is uninhibited and enigmatic. But, as played by Mallika, she is also made shrill and obnoxious. Even her snoring isn't convincing. Mallika is lucky to have Ranvir around to hold her up. In my opinion, this role needed to be filled by an actress with a light touch. Preity Zinta, maybe?

For me, the most exasperating thing about the film is that Kuhu's behavior goes unexplained until the last leg of the movie. By then, I was already too weirded out and my neck was cramping from having shaken my baffled head so many times. I hate to keep dropping the hammer on Mallika, but she laid an egg trying to pull off the weeping confession scene. And yet some of the blame falls on the screenplay writer. Kuhu could've been more likable and relatable if only her personality were explored more in depth. As it is, for most of the film, she remains a mean-spirited enigma. And the romance ends up lacking that spark.

There are some funny moments scattered about, the most amusing of which is the walk-to the-left-or-the-right-of-the-line slap bet. The movie also takes a time out to segue into dream sequences, brought about by Kuhu's penning of futuristic movie scripts. So we get to see Kabir and Kuhu in a shabby dystopian action thriller set and in a post-apocalyptic western (with Kuhu playing the action hero roles, of course). And, because this is Bollywood, there are singing and dancing. However, the musical numbers are interesting only so long as they're on-screen. Five minutes after, I'd be hard pressed to hum any of the tunes.

That's more or less a metaphor for the film.",1225756800,,4107,4.883787661406026
