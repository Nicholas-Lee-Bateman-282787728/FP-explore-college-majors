4233566,5,B003ZEBS7M,"Girls are under a constant and relentless assault by the entertainment and fashion industries in America today - an assault which batters their confidence and self-esteem, gives them a distorted view of the world, and has been linked to bulimia, anorexia, depression, and even suicide. In her important DVD documentary ""Cover Girl Culture: Awakening the Media Generation,"" former fashion model Nicole Clark attacks the myths propagated by fashion and entertainment - and teaches girls to discern between media imagery and reality.

""Cover Girl Culture: Awakening the Media Generation"" exposes the deceptive imagery and practices of teen-targeted fashion magazines like Teen Vogue, Elle, Marie Claire and others. A feature-length documentary by filmmaker Nicole Clark - herself a former Elite International fashion model - ""Cover Girl Culture"" explores how the worlds of fashion, modeling, advertising and celebrity impact our teens and young women. Featuring interviews with teen fashion magazine editors, the film compares the supposedly ""healthy"" and ""joyful"" images presented by their models with the pictures run in the magazines themselves. It also offers - and encourages - conversations among actual teen girls about the implications of such imagery, helps them to consider the ways in which fashion and advertising attempt to manipulate them, and encourages girls to reject the misogynistic messages in the media they consume and embrace themselves as they are.

It is crucial that every girl hear this message; and every parent, grandparent, teacher, and anyone else who routinely works with girls, should order a copy of ""Cover Girl Culture.""",1283817600,3,1652,5.577689243027889
8410200,5,B003ZEBS7M,"I recently finished watching Cover Girl Culture. I feel a profound sense of gratitude for the powerful message put forth in this film. The film's message honors the inherent beauty and goodness in all of us, especially our young. If this film was required viewing for all young girls and boys (and most ADULT women and men too!) the world and it's media outlets would be a more informed, empowering, and possibly enlightened place for this and future generations to inhabit and glean information and wisdom from. Girls and boys senses of self become brutalized by incessant demands to measure up to presented ideals of femininity and masculinity, which do not align with the highest ideals in Nature. All life is given freely and we have the choice to honor this gift with affirming images and messages or attempt to degrade it with demeaning and demoralizing content simply because it has ""market value"". What market is worth a young person's pride and belief in themselves as contributing members of society? Will one independent film tip the scales of decency and righteousness in favor of Spirit and bring the vapid money machine of mass media to a unequivocal and resounding halt in the present or distant future? Most likely not. And this precisely why this film is so important. Every person that sees this film is fully empowered to make wiser, more compassionate choices as to what we are willing to view and in turn broadcast in their personal styles.

With even a degree more sensitivity to the beauty of all living beings we may just lower anxiety levels a few notches and calm the jangled nerves of teen girls and boys starved for role models that feed their souls. Tragically with teen depression and suicide rates at an all-time high and with a media that starves kids souls with unrealistic images of models made up to role-play for a fantasy world designed to hoodwink them into believing they should belong in this fabricated reality rather than believe in themselves for the truly beautiful qualities they already possess and perhaps are just unaware of.

There's probably at least one young person in your life that would benefit greatly from seeing this film. Share this message with them. They will thank you. The world will thank you. And on behalf of them, I thank you.",1410739200,,2293,4.8320610687022905
8410201,5,B003ZEBS7M,"An extraordinary DVD that tells the truth.
By Lawrence Payne, MSW

As I watched the ""Cover Girl Culture"" DVD"", I was so happy that there is a program that is addressing the problems of how the media, and businesses are sexualizing our little girls. This film offers solutions to parents and girls, and this is what is needed to reverse this culture.

During my career, I have worked with K - 12 students, taught at colleges, and provided therapy to girls and women of all ages.

Over the years, I have felt extremely sad to see young clients come into therapy that are only concerned about being pretty. I had a client who's parents told me that their daughter took a shower, and afterwards they caught her with a camera taking nude pictures of herself. They also stated that with all the clothes that she has, she only likes to wear short dresses. The age of this client was seven years old. I also had a client who confessed that he and his girlfriend were exchanging nude photos of each other with their cell phones. The kids were twelve years old.

Young girls feel that they must be perfect, and that they are only valued if they are sexy. Many of these girls feel so inadequate that they are turning to cosmetic surgery. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, in 2010, teens from ages thirteen to nineteen received some of the following procedures: ""Breast augmentations (8,525), ear surgeries (8,763), liposuction (3,205), and nose reshaping (35,005). What is also extremely interesting are the Cosmetic Minimally Invasive Procedures, this age group also had the following procedures completed: Botox (13,467), laser hair removal (66,664), laser skin resurfacing (19,466), laser treatment of leg veins (20,991), and Microdermabrasion (9,091).

If this is not bad enough, we now have young girls posting their picture on YouTube asking strangers to tell them if they are pretty. Just like magazines that rate women, students also created an 'online poll ranking' that rated the ""Hottest"" girls in the district's middle and high schools. Is this what we want for our girls?

Nicole Clark's DVD - ""Cover Girl Culture"" addresses the problems / issues that are causing our young girls to feel that they are inadequate. This DVD depicts how the media and businesses are making a tremendous amount of money by sexualizing young girls. I also found the professionals who presented in the DVD to not only be creditable, but also extremely accurate as to what is taken place in this culture.

The ""Cover Girl Culture"" DVD allows the viewers to hear from girls. These girls discussed the need to be perfect, and also which parts of their bodies need to change so that they will become perfect. The girls also discuss how they see thin models, and then they look at themselves and feel a sense of inadequacy. The DVD does a excellent job with balancing the views of young girls, and the professionals that have direct experience in this area. It also addresses the media / businesses that only care about the money that is being made at the expense of our little girls.

As a therapist, educator, and former foster kid, I would love to see the ""Cover Girl Culture"" DVD shown at schools, girls group homes, colleges, and at parenting classes. In addition, I firmly believe that the DVD should be shown anywhere there are females (all ages) because society as a whole are given them the wrong messages about their beauty.

We have got to get to the point that female of all ages are not judged at all, let alone on beauty. Our young girls need to know that they are intelligent, and that their value is not based on what media tells them it should be.

I highly recommend three things: (1) That people purchase the ""Cover Girl Culture"" DVD and show it to girls, family members, and friends. (2) That people approach the schools not only to see the DVD, but to invite Nicole Clark in to talk about her experiences as a model. (3) For those that can afford too, donate to Nicole Clark's Program so that she can continue to make a difference in the lives of our young girls.",1410480000,,4080,4.709677419354839
8410202,5,B003ZEBS7M,"After hearing friends discuss the positive impact this film had, I purchased a copy for my family.

Unlike a lot of documentaries that are made by filmmakers who learn about a subject and fly in for filming, this was an inside look at the impact of media on self-esteem by a former Elite model. It is full of valuable interviews and examples of the range of tools used to sell us products. It balances nicely between kids, parents, models, editors, and doctors to provide a range of perspectives. It is far more believable and, frankly, newsworthy when an insider making model money leaves the business to make a movie about what really is happening.

And why it has come up in so many following conversations is because she offers solutions. While it might have been enough to leave me slack-jawed at the editors' comments about health, fashion, and their desire to ""educate women,"" clearly the film wants us to shield ourselves, to think for ourselves, and to decide with our wallets what companies deserve our advertising support.

It is a rare documentary made by someone so qualified, with such amazing access...it is truly unbelievable to see the list of magazine editors sharing the camera with Canada's top teen experts, PhDs, body-image specialists, and surgeons.",1381622400,,1272,4.934579439252336
8410203,5,B003ZEBS7M,"I purchased this product as a school counselor and could not have been more satisfied! My students were so intrigued by this documentary that it inspired them to take more action. Their inspiration encouraged me to reach out to the producer so their efforts would not go unheard. From her guidance we were able to contact the editor of Vogue and ask her to take action. This was a wonderful opportunity for them, and I could incorporate many state standards into this activity. This video should be a part of school counselor's library and curriculum. I will continue to use it in my girl leadership activities. Thanks Nicole for being a leader that allows others to take action!",1362182400,,679,4.762711864406779
8410204,5,B003ZEBS7M,I watched this Documentary and it blew me away! I watched the little girls responses and was brought to tears because I saw myself in their little faces. I am a 27 year old woman and a mother to a four year old little boy. I wish that I had seen this movie when I was younger because maybe it would have saved me years of heartache. As long as I can remember I was always on a diet and wanted to look a certain way and now I really understand why. I highly recommend this video to anyone who has girls or women in their lives who may struggle with body image/eating disorders. I really believe that this could help them to change their minds and start the process of loving themselves for who they are and not how they look. Lets put a stop to hating ourselves and lets start loving ourselves!,1332201600,,793,4.1558441558441555

8410206,5,B003ZEBS7M,"This film is a must see by young and young at heart. It is a powerful tool to use in initiating the media literacy conversation and education at home, school, youth groups, etc.

The director secured interviews not only with the editors of the top adv. industry magazines, Teen Vogue and Elle, but with many experts like Dr. Karyn Gordon - Canada's top teen expert, Dr. Deb Burgard, body-image specialist, Dr. Zarrabi (plastic surgeon), Robert Tennyson Stevens, author and holistic health educator, etc., in addition to interviewing many teachers, parents, and students.

This film conveys a very powerful message to all the parents/adults to wake up and support our youth in seeing the manipulative reality of media advertising and in learning how to discern the lies that are being fed to them. The film focuses on solutions and I highly recommend to purchase/watch/show it together with the director's ""Seeing Through the Media Matrix"" DVD, a companion guide to Cover Girl Culture.

Definitely, one of the best documentaries made on the subject. A must see!",1331683200,,1060,5.080459770114943
