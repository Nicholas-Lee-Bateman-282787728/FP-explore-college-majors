8285892,4,B001C4DTT2,"This 1952 film was done not too long after the ""radionovela"" completed its run of several years.  The actors are excellent, the plot has become commonplace since the Forties radio novels which differed from today's ""telenovelas"" in  that the latter have much shorted runs.

Gloria Marin was an ""A"" list actress in Mexican cinema in the Thirties and Forties, known for her  beauty.  Jorge Mistral, a Spaniard was as can be seen quite a looker.

The plot involves the daughter of a rich family who gets pregnant and whose father sends her ""away"" to give birth and put the baby up for adoption. Of course, the child is not put up for adoption and the plot twists follow with the boy (Albertico) growing up to become a doctor.  The ending is predictable by today's standards but not in in the setting it was originally broadcast.  The themes cover family honor, pride, racism and redemption.

Highly recommended as a period piece, but the ""radionovela"" was  better with Sarita Garcia as the adoptive mother of Albertico.",1413849600,,1016,4.787356321839081

Considering the main topic was abortion and the views and feelings at that point of time were well acted out  with powerful emotions behind the acting , i would recommend  it for people who are looking at what was going on at that point of time .",1382918400,,418,3.9879518072289155

The story is so beautiful and powerful - almost like Mama Flora family, Roots - in that setting of slavery and an unwanted child born and given away to be killed but saved by a black slave nanny. POWERFUL!!!",1347926400,,372,4.109589041095891
