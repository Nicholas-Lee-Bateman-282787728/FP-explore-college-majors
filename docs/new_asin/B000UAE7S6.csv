8212467,1,B000UAE7S6,This movie pairing was a great idea. I've had it on the wish list forever just as a reminder in anticipation of the Blu-Ray version. I've given up on the studios ability to do the right thing. I bought the BR version of Chinatown out of frustration. Sad commentary on the industry.,1357862400,,281,4.423076923076923
8212468,5,B000UAE7S6,Fast delivery. The price was good too. Product was as described. I watched both movies several times. I thought both movies were a good with good actors.,1351814400,,153,4.703703703703703
8212469,5,B000UAE7S6,"If you are a Jack Nicholson fan you will love this package, while Chinatown is the premier of the package, The Two Jakes is very good and makes you feel like you are living a part of the Old LA that makes up this movie",1275177600,,218,3.8666666666666667
8212470,5,B000UAE7S6,Packaging both movies together brings the entire story together. Without being together you have to look around and try to find the 2nd movie (The Two jakes)to complete the story.,1274054400,,179,5.0
8212471,5,B000UAE7S6,"This is the best presentation of Chinatown I've seen to date, and am very pleased with the purchase.  The quality of the films (and backstory features) are very pleasing and, in the case of the latter, insightful.  I will place the disclaimer that I am a big Polanski fan, as well as the genre in question, so that does create a natural bias.  It's the ideal product for folks wanting the whole picture.  If you follow the money, it will lead you to this superior combo... - k",1254268800,,476,4.375
8212472,5,B000UAE7S6,"I recently purchased the ""Jack Nicholson Collection"" Chinatown/The two Jakes. These are two of my favorite movies. I am extremely pleased with my purchase.",1225324800,,155,5.5
8212473,4,B000UAE7S6,"These are two of Jack Nicholson's finest films.  In so many of his films, Nicholson plays unbalanced characters with strange behaviors bordering on the psychotic.  Don't get me wrong, he has always played these roles brilliantly, but it's nice to see that he can tackle a serious role now and again and play it exceedingly well.  The plots here are complex and satisfying, the other players also accomplished and interesting.  Two very good films.",1212192000,,447,5.0
8212474,5,B000UAE7S6,Even though both films have already been released on DVD. Having both of them packaged together. With the new interviews makes it worthwhile.,1198195200,2,141,5.173913043478261
