7276828,4,B00ZE4ZYPS,I really enjoy this series,1446681600,,26,4.4
7276829,2,B00ZE4ZYPS,I am disappointed that 4Kids never finished dubbing 5D's and skipped episodes. I want to know why they skipped episodes and never finished dubbing the series. They NEED to go back and dub the episodes they skipped and dub the rest of the series.,1444867200,3,245,4.590909090909091

7276831,5,B00ZE4ZYPS,ITS GREAT .YOU NEED TO BRING LOST EPISODES TO DVD AND DUBBED THEM IN ENGLISH,1443830400,,76,4.133333333333334
7276832,5,B00ZE4ZYPS,"This is the last yugioh 5Ds DVD set released on DVD.  This has the episodes from season 3, a few episodes from season 4, and 2 from season 5.  As 4Kids thought Zexal was worth more of their time than this they just didn't dub all the episodes, others were left out due to 4Kids finding them to be to dark.  Also i know it says Season 2 but season 2 of yugioh 5Ds is the earthbound immortal saga which is in season 1 DVD box set.

What this season has(Monsters who beat Synchro monsters, Duels for fun, Duel Runner Tournament, Plot build up for season 5 that we never got, Advanced Synchro summoning, New threats, and my favorite part Crash Town).
SEASON 1 DVD SET: Has seasons 1-2
SEASON 2 DVD SET: Has seasons 3-5(ish)

Long story short if you buy this box set and the 1st one you will have all of the dubbed 5Ds episodes.  This was my favorite seasons of 5Ds and im glad its finally out.",1443312000,8,889,4.169590643274854
7276833,5,B00ZE4ZYPS,"I love this season set as much as I do the last one of the 5Ds series, but my only gripe is that it doesn't contain the undubbed episodes such as when Jack goes to the Nazca and receives his Red Nova Dragon, when Team 5Ds faces off against another team (their name escapes me) in the WRGP tournament, and finally the Divine Temple/Ark Cradle arc. The last one is what bothers me most and I'll just be over here hoping for a subbed (at least) release for the missing episodes. It would suck if GX got a Season 4 release, but this gets nothing after the dubbed episodes.",1443312000,2,568,4.220183486238532
7276834,5,B00ZE4ZYPS,"If you bought the first season then you should definitely buy this season. It's the last season of the Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's series & it was a lot of fun watching it again after all of these years since it was on TV. I do want to point out that on the back of volume 8 it says that it contains the last 18 episodes of the series, but it actually has 13 episodes total & it's still the whole series from what I remember watching on TV years ago.",1442361600,3,437,3.9213483146067416
7276835,5,B00ZE4ZYPS,"Very good series I like watching it as it has that similar tone as the first yugioh. I only hope they release the third season box set, it didn't get a English dub by 4 kids though but here's hoping they would do it and release it. Other than that I would recommend this to anyone that's a fan of yugioh.",1442275200,2,304,4.0

7276838,4,B00ZE4ZYPS,"So, as many people will tell you, the set that you are ordering here is the English cut of Yugioh 5D's.  As to be expected, quite a bit of the dialogue has been edited for the international market. This includes the removal of extreme examples of violence and religious context.  Due to this and budget cuts with the international release, many episode were not included in this set.  This includes the final arc, which takes place after the World Grand Prix and wraps up the stories for the 5Ds cast quite nicely.  So, you won't be getting the full story or any rematches here (hint...hint).  I'd definitely check out the subs through another source.

All that being said, I still loved the 5Ds cast and story!  Even for a dubbed Yugioh series, it seemed a bit more mature than the previous iterations.  The voices actors aren't too bad and the duels are still fun to watch.  If you enjoy the dubbed versions of the show, then definitely pick this up for your collection.",1460505600,,972,4.572254335260116

7276840,5,B00ZE4ZYPS,"I do like the Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds series but what makes me not like this release is all the missing information about it like how Jack Atlas got his Red Dragon Archfiend's upgrade Red Nova Dragon. and the absolutely no payoff with Z-One. (Only those who say the Japanese subs would know what I am talking about) Honestly If they were too lazy to dub it they could of just put the undubbed episodes in as just subtitled so they can at least fit the story together and make it whole and then could sell more dvds but eh getting off topic. The series as it was is good and one of the better Yu-Gi-Oh! Series, besides the original.",1458777600,,621,4.271186440677966

7276845,5,B00ZE4ZYPS,Well season 2 is here and it's pretty good. The animators added levels for the monsters to fit in with the Subbed version more. But sadly no arc cradle and this is probably the last one as well oh boy. But it is still worth the price,1451606400,2,233,3.978723404255319
