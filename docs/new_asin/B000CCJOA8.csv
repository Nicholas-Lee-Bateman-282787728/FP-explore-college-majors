2457142,5,B000CCJOA8,"I don't know who Amazon's ""Editorial Reviewer"" is, but I'm here to set the record straight.  In my life, which has been filled with mystery, intrigue and Down Syndrome, I have yet to see a more poignant story than ""Riding the Bus with My Sister.""  B-R-I-L-L-I-A-N-T.  Rosie.  Words cannot express the emotions running through my body this second.  I don't care what the critics say, we'll let the Academy Awards decide who's right this time.  Until the day that this masterpiece finds it's place in the sun, I'll be here riding the bus with my sister.",1136419200,13,551,4.6875

2457149,5,B000CCJOA8,"This gets all five stars because it was not only well done and true to my experiences as a support staff, but also because it spoke to me with a message I have remembered over the years. I am taking the time to write this review because I read a few negative ones written by viewers who thought Beth was ""overdone"" or too loud. This is extremely typical of many of the program participants with whom I have worked on every level. But the message that has stuck with me was when big sister Rachel tell the case manager, ""You have no right to judge me."" It is so common for support staff to think that families should spend more time with their adult family members who are in group homes, yet this points out that we have no idea what the family members have gone through in the past. We have no idea. I realize my review could be very controversial, itself, but the message of the film still reminds us: we have no right to judge. There were many other messages, and this was probably not intended to be the main message, but it is a valuable one, and does help one to understand the dilemma that might be faced by both individuals in need of care and their families.",1407024000,5,1167,4.261261261261262
2457150,5,B000CCJOA8,"I love this movie!  As someone who works with people with disabilities, I found this a great representation.  Some people think it's over the top but I work with people with similar personalities and thought Rosie did a good job showing the wonderful world",1406592000,,256,4.795454545454546

2457153,3,B000CCJOA8,I saw this movie on the Hallmark channel.. I found Rosie O' Donnell much too loud and a bit annoying at times..I liked Andie MacDowell part as her sister. But Rosie's character in my opinion was just too loud at times and could have been toned down a notch .This movie was just ok for me.. I know she was suppose to be mentally challenged but it was a bit over done..If you ever seen A Dog Named Christmas the boy in that movie is mentally challenged also but this movie is so good and a hallmark movie and he isn't screaming or yelling. It is a very heart-warming movie which I bought.. Wouldn't buy Riding The Bus With My Sister...,1395360000,2,633,4.239669421487603
2457154,5,B000CCJOA8,This is a GREAT movie.  I had no idea Rosie good act so superbly!  One of my top ten favorites of all time.,1394928000,,107,3.608695652173913
2457155,5,B000CCJOA8,"It's so bad it is GREAT! There is no plot, no dramatic tension, bad acting, and basically no justification for being a movie. But you should buy it anyway!",1389830400,2,155,4.379310344827586
2457156,4,B000CCJOA8,"Beth (Rosie O'Donnell) is a LOUD, mentally-challenged young woman who has a lot of trouble with authority (she doesn't like to listen to anybody).  Her sister, Rachel (Andie McDowell) comes from New York to help take care of her after their father dies, but Beth has ideas of her own.  This movie shows the challenges of tolerating a loved one with a disability on a daily basis.  It is sometimes difficult to have character sympathy with the loud, obnoxious, self-centered Beth in this film.  Don't look for a sugar coating here.",1383955200,,530,4.791208791208791
2457157,5,B000CCJOA8,"I have never, ever, in all my years of living, seen such inspired performances! ROSIE O'DONNELL! Andie MacDowell's eyebrows! D W Moffet's blatant hotness! Richard T. Jones's bike-riding skills! And if that wasn't enough, Angelica Huston wearing a HAT in the behind-the-scenes!!!

This movie has EVERYTHING! But, virgin reader - a warning - SPOILER ALERT!

This movie sinks its claws into you within the first five minutes with the riveting arousal of Ms. O'Donnell - I'll call her Beth because that's how she'll forever be emblazoned in my memory - up up and into the bathroom she runs to wash her face and to greet herself! I immediately felt at one with her character...I wanted to know more! Then of course, a plot twist! ""Rachel Simon,"" as Beth says into the receiver ""this is Beth Simon. Our Daddy is DEAD!"" I know, it was almost too much, but I had to keep watching, if not for the plot, merely to focus on O'Donnell's extreme method acting; she is the master of her craft! Not only that, but THEN we find out that Beth has HIGH CHOLESTEROL?! And Rachel is forced to leave her highly successful and public career as a wedding photographer of morose and lonely brides to move to a corporate upstate town to help Beth's lipid count decrease by buying celery and making out with one of Beth's drivers. That's right. I typed MAKE OUT. There was some of that for you perverts out there! (Edith, I see you typed there wasn't any sex! I call untrue! This was like a modern-day Lady Chatterly's lover.) Anywhichway, hijinks ensue like Beth making some cherry-flavored fish candy swim in cola, Beth looking for a new toilet seat, Beth running to and fro various geographic locations and townspeople - small minded incipient townspeople - throwing shade on Beth. But Beth is the sequoia of the Hallmark channel and she stands taller than all of them, nacho plate in hand! The strength of character she shows when Jesse almost gets his face beat by a bunch of hooligans ... EDITH! You said there was no violence! ... is an inspiration to us all. Especially those of us who like to scream in public.

Nope, this movie DID include Sex, Violence but thankfully, absolutely no condescension whatsoever. It was in no way whatsoever awards-season bait.

So that's my review. Gold Crown all the way. And for what it's worth, Rick the bus driver, I get motion sickness but I'll happily ride you!

Oh, and by the way, YO WEEYAD!",1382054400,2,2414,4.657276995305164

2457160,5,B000CCJOA8,"I bought this book after seeing it on cable.  I so reminded me of my own sister who was mentally handicapped.  It was very inspiring, and so believable. It showed what a good life people with challenges can have with a little help and understanding from everyone.  It was also humorous in places.",1371340800,,296,4.547169811320755
2457161,5,B000CCJOA8,I bought this movie to laugh at. It's the worst depiction of a mentally challenged individual I have ever seen. The movie is so bad it brings me to tears laughing.. Recommend it for therapy,1371340800,2,189,4.428571428571429
2457162,5,B000CCJOA8,"Buy it just for the laughs - it's a terrible film but very funny - buy it used if you can, not worth over $20.",1368662400,2,110,3.44
2457163,5,B000CCJOA8,I had saw this movie 9 years ago.  I had just given birth to a little girl with Mosiac Down Syndrome and Autism (I later learned) and this movie helped me to see that my daughter really would have a viable future.  I cried and cried with joy!!  What a great movie.  I didn't realize I needed acceptance therapy.,1367798400,,311,4.220338983050848
2457164,5,B000CCJOA8,"A friend of mine bought this for me as a gift. When I first saw this film I thought ""WTF?!?!?"" But then realized O'Donnell was actually trying to be serious. After that realization, the movie was just hysterical! I must confess I've not seen it thru to the end, but if you've had a bad day and need a good laugh, just throw this in your DVD player and you will have forgotten why you were in a bad mood.",1332115200,3,403,4.05
2457165,4,B000CCJOA8,"Before I started this review of Riding the Bus with my Sister, I read the reviews posted on this title.  It seems to be a ""love it or hate it"" movie, with nothing in between.

I liked this movie!  But I would not say I loved this movie.  That's the reason for four stars only.  I liked that Rosie O'Donnell was cast as Beth.  I also enjoyed ""My Sister's Keeper"" and ""The Boys Next Door"".  All three titles deal with real-life situations & how particular characters handle the life's situations that affect us all.  As I see it, each individual learns methods of coping.  It's just sometimes, some people have more choices of ""tools"" than others.  I think Beth & I could have learned to be friends.  One of the bus-drivers said she drove him nuts when he first started driving, but he learned to understand her & to like her.  I would only try to turn-down the volume of Beth's voice a little.  How can a person not be affected with meeting Beth?  How can a person remain a crumudgeon after meeting Beth, with her colorful dress & vibrant personality?  Those who rode the bus with her reminded me a little of Scrooge's reply when a group of gentlemen came calling at his place of business soliciting funds for the poor on Christmas Eve.  ""Are there no poor-houses, are there no prisons?""  Beth has found a purpose to her life - riding the bus & encouaging people.  Sure, it pays nothing, but it is a purpose.  I wish I had a ""Beth character"" in my life!

I would have gotten this title whether I had known anything about it or not.  It's a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie.  That tells me several things about it without knowing anything about the particular story-line: first, there will be little or no violence in the movie.  If violence is needed for the story, it is a quick scene or referred to in the dialog.  Second, HHofF movies have little or overt sexuality.  Third, HHofF movies have little or no substance abuse.  Fourth: HHofF movies have a good story to tell.  And fifth: HHofF movies are going to run right around 100 minutes.  Hallmark buys a 2-hour time slot on network TV &, except for one mid-movie intermission, even the commercials are for Hallmark products.  When the commercial breaks are taken out, the actual movie runs for right around 100 minutes.  And, I feel like I have gotten the most important parts of the story in that time allotment!

This year, I decided to getas many of the HHofF movies in VHS format as possible, as cheaply as possible.  I got some titles here on Amazon; I got some on eBay.  But, in the Fall of 2010, Hallmark decided to have a clearance sale on HHofF movies ordered directly from Hallmark at a HUGE savings over normal retail pricing.  I ""scarfed them up"" & now have, I think, a complete collection of titles available in VHS format.  I have a few in DVD.  When the VHS titles are cleared out from Hallmark, only DVD formats will remain.  The movies released in the past three years are only available in DVD format.

This was a good movie.  I have liked other HHofF titles more & others less; but, I am glad I watched this movie.",1293494400,5,3083,4.427807486631016
2457166,5,B000CCJOA8,"This was a heart moving story. I love the fact that Beth is so independent. I was amazed with her knowledge of the bus schedules to the minute,and she knows every driver. She is colorful and loud and well she's just Beth.",1288656000,,221,4.285714285714286
2457167,5,B000CCJOA8,"I really enjoyed this movie and it's one that stays with you long after it's over.  It's a heartfelt, funny, enjoyable movie that I hope to watch again some day.",1255219200,,161,4.366666666666666
2457168,5,B000CCJOA8,"RtBwMS is one of the greatest so-bad-it's-good movies. I'm not saying this in a sarcastic or ironic fashion either--I truly love this movie. When I picture Anjelica Huston sitting at the video village, concentrating on Rosie's ludicrous performance going, Okay, okay, Rosie? Great stuff, but could you maybe play it more offensive? Maybe like full retard? Astonishing.

There are few movies that for my friends and I have this much repeat value--truly hilarious every time, and what's more is that the movie gets even funnier when you begin questioning its logic and random assortment of details (such as the scary man who offers Rosie a doll at one point and then is never seen or heard from again).

So many stars.",1233792000,2,716,4.909090909090909
2457169,1,B000CCJOA8,This movie is terrible.  I watched it hoping the bus would drive into a ravine.,1194566400,7,79,4.266666666666667
2457170,1,B000CCJOA8,"It always facinates me when celebritys play learning disabled, retarded, depressed,etc... people.  This is because I have to assume that none of these people live in hollywood.  I used to think that Sean Penn's portrayal of a retarded man in ""I Am Sam"" was the most over the top porly done, insulting performance but Rosie blew him out of the water.  Apparently retarded women only talk as though they are screaming, and also sound like Jim the Drunk from the TV show ""Taxi"".  I guess they couldn't cast a real retarded person because apparently they don't act retarded enough.  Buy this movie for the same reason you would buy a copy of the movie ""Showgirls"" so you can laugh at how idiotic it is.  Andy MacDowell has a limited range but is usually very good at picking rolls for herself, and I have liked Rosie in other movies like Legue of their own and Another Stakeout but this was torture to sit through.",1144195200,29,910,4.552147239263804
2457171,5,B000CCJOA8,"Heroic! Courageous! Brave! Daring! These are all words I would use to describe you, if you were able to sit through this tour de force of a performance by Rosie O'Donnell. Not because it's so bad as some have suggested, but because you will NEVER forget this film. Rosie has not only elevated her acting skills, she elevates the viewer as well to a place I like to call ""Rosie O'Nirvana."" I have always been a fan of Rosie's super subtle, light on humor standup act, but her performance here puts her in the company of Dustin Hoffman and Daniel Day Lewis. If they were in the same airport bus. Her performance is never so cloying and over-the-top that I have to catch my breath after her scenes because they are uncomfortable to view. And to those out there who suggested it, NO This should not be rated X due to the fact that it may shock you, disgust you and disturb you. It will, but in a good way. I also want to salute Angelo Tsarouchas for his performance as Mean Eugene though -- it was superior.",1143763200,23,1003,4.340425531914893
2457172,5,B000CCJOA8,"Rosie is my hero. I was planning my own suicide the very night of the day i stumbled across this masterpiece. It inspired in me a will to live once again. I think we all need to try to be a bit more like beth with her colorful clothing and loud antics as she brightens everyone's day around her. I was brought to tears as from just simple cookies she was able to create a mountain from her own imagination. That right there showed how beth, despite her disabilities, can make something out of nothing as she takes on the world with her positive outlook.",1136678400,22,553,4.276190476190476

8097344,5,B000CCJOA8,"I'm reviewing this before I even get it because I loved it when Hallmark played it. Yes Beth is loud and obnoxious which is just right. I've had experience with people with her medical condition and many if not most have been just like her. It gives an accurate portrayal and is extremely well and tastefully done! Rosie was perfect and must have spent hours and hours learning the mannerisms and expressions in order to play this part. Andie was every bit as good. She had reason to feel the way she did in not wanting the responsibility of her sister. The transformation in their relationship was great! I am so glad I decidedo look for it and am ordering it right now. It's a movie everyone should see, especially if you can watch it with your kids. It will help them to understand that mentally challenged people are not someone to ridicule and laugh at. It shows that they have feelings and can be hurt just like everyone else. I say this because all my life (63yrs) I've heard too many jokes and people talking and making fun of the retard (their words not mine). They should experience someone like her, they'd learn a lot and maybe gain some patience and understanding.",1490745600,,1177,4.530516431924883

8097346,5,B000CCJOA8,"A lot can be said about any movie, the genre,message , audience.  This movie gives a whole new dynamic to movies. Just watching it left me in tears, Rosie O' Donnell is a phenomenal actress in a role as a disabled woman who lives life by riding buses daily and her sister who starred n Judging Amy shows us that if we just understood our disabled and treated each other equally the world can be a better place",1481068800,,409,4.243589743589744

8097348,5,B000CCJOA8,"This movie has to be seen to be believed! Rosie's portrayal is truly outrageous; she portrays the character as a deranged, fidgeting, shifty-eyed, screaming lunatic- almost no one acts that way. It's absolutely hilarious! What on earth was Anjelica Houston thinking when she directed this?! It's a film well suited to John Waters fans, the height of bad taste.
Drinking Game: Every time Rosie swings her feet, or screws up her face, or twists her hands, or shouts inappropriately...take a drink. (Tip: Stock up on drinks.)",1460073600,,522,5.0813953488372094
