She incorporates more upper body movement during the walk, which makes if more challenging and rewarding. This is a good fit for someone who is just starting to exercise. Unlike other DVDs, Leslie presents the exercise alone (no other walkers with her). She is very encouraging and positive. I recommend this to others starting out. For those who are already active, it's a nice warm-up before you move on to more strenuous things.",1439769600,,557,4.6938775510204085
8420089,5,B004AEQNSA,"Another high energy fav of Leslie's, though I do miss her groups of walkers.
Due to health cond., I do the walks & arm movements sitting in a chair & it works! :)",1396051200,,162,3.9393939393939394
8420090,5,B004AEQNSA,"After trying several of Leslie Sansone's earlier walk-at-home VHS tapes and DVDs, this one is my favorite by far.  As a beginner (an exercise newby, if you will), I need motivation and very simple moves, and this video provides that at a pretty fast clip to keep me moving along.  There also is no audience in the back to distract from the workout.  If you're looking for a simple and relatively painless way to start regular at-home exercise, I would definitely recommend this DVD!",1364774400,2,482,4.714285714285714
8420091,5,B004AEQNSA,Perfect workout for someone wanting that 30 min walk. It's so much more than just a walk though. This works all the body and  does it well. I have used many of Leslie's work out tapes. The best by far.,1300060800,5,201,4.025
8420092,5,B004AEQNSA,"This is an exercise program for those who don't really like to exercise.  It is so convenient to exercise in a small space with no extra items needed.  It's simple,yet can become more intense if desired.",1297468800,8,203,4.611111111111111
