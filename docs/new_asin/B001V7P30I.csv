8345536,2,B001V7P30I,"I`ve been trying to get a hold of this ww2 film for quite some time now. At the time,this was the only listing of the film that didn`t specify dvd region code,so i assumed it was the usual region 1. Well,after i bought it ,not only did the price go down,but it`s also a region 2 disc. For the uninitiated, a region 2 disc will not play on most players in the U.S., unless you happen to have a multi region player. Anyways,i was able to watch the film by playing it on my old i-mac computer after changing the region code...well, i wouldn`t say i watched the film in its entirety in front of my computer-i mostly fastforwarded to the battle scenes at the end,because most of the film looks rather boring,and i was already upset at the wrong dvd region code(product info is updated now though, thanks to me),and of course i was also upset at the ""usual price drop after i buy something""scenario. But are the battle scenes any good?Well, it sure isn`t Saving private ryan,that`s for sure. Despite surprisingly authentic equipment(German mg42,mp40,sturmgewehr mp44,panzerfausts etc.) the battle scenes are reminiscent of a typical ww2 reenactment -not bad, but then again not anything like the bigger budget films ala ...Private ryan. The movie seems to be about a group of young german soldiers and their experience fighting americans near the end of the war-i`m sure it`s more in depth than that,but i don`t really care. So there you have it-the only review (that i`m aware of) of this rather lacklustre ww2 film...well,there`s another review ,but it`s in french, and i don`t understand french...wrong language,wrong region code,price drop after i bought it...what more can i say?",1390003200,,1678,4.850174216027875
