8592002,1,B00DCTEK16,"Though the movie translates a good deal of the film into English there is one expert that was not translated at all and is left to speak throughout the movie in his own language without subtitles translating his comments.  I do not understand why the people that made this film advertize that it was also in English if they had no intentions of translating it properly?  PROBABLY TO SELL MORE OR THEIR DVDS then they thought the film was worth.

In addition in the second DVD: PART II, one of the links to the questions and answers section does not work, which further supports my views on this poorly made film.",1395100800,4,612,4.495495495495495
