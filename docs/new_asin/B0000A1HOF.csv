1901049,2,B0000A1HOF,"If you are reading this review i strongly advise you do not purchase the Ninja Scroll series! As an anime fan i have obviously seen the Ninja Scroll movie which i strongly sudgest you purchase, but this series has nothing to do with the movie, the action is repetitive and usually results in a foe beign cut in half by Jubei. If you want to ignore my sudgestion, it's your cash not mine, but you will grow tired of robotic ninjas and other un-inspired stuff.",1062460800,2,458,4.4
1901050,4,B0000A1HOF,"Since the 1996 release of the original ""Ninja Scroll"" feature, fans have suffered from misleading sub-par efforts such as ""Ninja Resurrection"" and ""Jubei-chan, Ninja Girl."" With the 13-episode ""Dragon Gem"" TV series, ""Scroll"" fanatics finally have something to latch on to, a series that fearlessly tries to live up to the standard set by one of the most important movies in anime history.
Easygoing, morally sincere, ninja-for-hire Jubei Kibagami is once again the focus of the series, alternately called ""The Dragon Stone Treasure"" or ""The Jade Dragon."" Jubei is based in fact on a character of the same name from feudal Japan, the Paul Bunyan or Wong Fei Hong legend for that country. ""Dragon Gem"" opens with a masked ninja named Rouga fleeing after stealing the precious Dragon Gem of the Hiroku, a ninja clan ""destined to live in darkness,"" and protect the gem. The first fight scenes are a pretty good indicator of what is to come: an overwhelming amount of multi-skilled ninjas, some dispatched with ease, others getting a several-episode lifespan. Rouga is cornered by Hiroku's Migai, a spider-man-type guy, as well as two ninjas from the Kimon clan, who want the gem as well (you'll remember the Kimon as the clan that produced the Eight Devils Jubei fought in the movie). One is a swordsman with a flying bike/lance contraption, the other a woman who can produce ... gremlins. Jubei interferes, simply because they've disturbed his nap, and unleashes a new skill (in addition to his swordsmanship, Wolverine-like recovery ability, and the sturdy string attached to the sword): a sword slash that projects through the air (similar to Raijuta's Izuni in ""Rurouni Kenshin""). Rouga offers to team up, but Jubei refuses, arbitrarily because he ""doesn't trust people in masks,"" and because he wants to finish his nap and his dream.
The second part of the setup involves Shigure, a teenager kept from the outside world her whole life, and unknowingly being guarded by an entire village of ninjas. Her world is shattered when the Kimon attack; she also finds out that she is somehow the ""Witch of Light"" (or Maiden of Light in other translations). Rouga buys her some time to escape at the cost of his life; as he dies, begs Jubei to deliver the gem to Shigure. Jubei agrees, an important fact seeing as the only thing more important than justice and money to Jubei is his word.
So goes the series, with the Kimon and Hiroku clans sending their minions after Jubei and Shigure, who are joined by Dakuan, the Tokugawa government spy from the movie, and Tsubute, an athletic teen thief, and a slightly annoying character. Apparently, the union of the Witch of Light and the Dragon Gem can either lead to the Hiroku treasure, or unleash a hidden horror for the Kimon. The array of characters ranges from uber-cool, to unoriginally [weak]. Two characters borrow heavily from the wasp-hive devil from the movie: one controls a swarm of moths, the other a swarm of bats. There are the cooler characters such as Rengoku, a re-animator who can re-attach body parts to others or herself, and is a sort of twisted Inspector Gadget; or Anden Yamidron, the Kimon's No. 2, who can crystalize and destroy things by touch.
Don't expect 13 episodes with the same quality as the movie. Would you expect a ""Ghost In The Shell"" TV series to seriously maintain that level of animation for even more than five episodes? Obviously not. That said, the pilot four episodes are of a significantly better level of art than the rest of the series. The TV Jubei is drawn with the movie Jubei in mind--same raggedy brown clothes and split Raiden hat--but has slightly thicker eyebrows, less slanty eyes, and a thicker lower lip: not huge differences, but enough to be noticeable. The art, direction and movement in this volume are by no means comparable to the movie, but far above average for a TV series. The fight sequence between Jubei and Jashi, a ninja with a hollow eye socket that, among other things, can use a dead person's eyeball as a sort of DVD to play back their final moments, is beautifully crafted, with the quick cuts from close-up, to far away, to just the sounds of swords clashing, to images of their shadows battling at the speed of light. The shocking level of gore from the movie is also toned down in this series, as is the [physcial] content, although it doesn't shy from implicit [abuse] scenes. The characters are semi-modern, much like those in ""Wild, Wild West"" (yes, the Will Smith movie), probably owing to the character designs of Takahiro Yoshimatsu, of ""Trigun"" fame.
You may have to re-watch Vol. 1 after getting through the second volume just to better understand what's going on, with so many characters being introduced, and with bad guys fighting not only the good guys, but each other (think three-way battle). Thankfully, the series maintains the idea that these demons still exhibit human failings: a female villain embittered by [abuse]; the aptly-named Rengoku, whose desire for revenge many times blinds her to the original mission of [physcial] desire or pride or loneliness.
It should've been a five-star series; the major, but not horrendous, drop-off in quality from the first four episodes to the rest of the series is a little bit of a turn-off, as is the over-emphasis on fights, which affects the plot development, and the story behind the gem. It's a good series that benefits from having a great movie to work off of, but may suffer from the extremely high expectations fans may put on it.",1059782400,22,5519,4.8474576271186445
1901051,4,B0000A1HOF,"I have seen 5 Ninja Scroll episodes (#1-5) and for those of you that want to know how it stacks up against the movie, overall it is pretty close. The art style is identical to the movie. There is a little less detail in the characters and not as much movement, but this is expected in a series (less of a budget). There are 13 episodes total. This series is missing the over-the-top sexuality and gore from the movie, but does contain a few scenes of extreme violence. Every episode I have seen features several villians with all kinds of crazy powers, who are quickly dispatched by Jubei and his throwing sword. Features a traditional Japanese opening theme (no singing!) and the character of Jubei is every bit as cool as he was in the Ninja Scroll film. I would rate the overall animation quality as just below Cowboy Bebop, but above Hellsing & Berserk. Bottom line, if you like Ninja Scroll, like anime and enjoy watching swordplay, this series can't be beat!  PS: The anime DVD Ninja Resurrection has NOTHING to do with Ninja Scroll. Be warned! It is a cheap attempt to cash in on the popularity of Ninja Scroll. THIS series is the only TRUE Ninja Scroll sequel. Same creators, same animation studio (Madhouse)!",1058572800,10,1217,4.608294930875576
1901052,5,B0000A1HOF,"If you saw the Movie, you must see those episodes. They are really good.

I was thinking, hey they can't be as good as the movie, but, they are, really, I was surprised.

Got to have it.

the DVD presentation is not all that, but it is OK.",1098144000,2,239,3.9375
1901053,4,B0000A1HOF,"(THIS REVIEW IS FOR ALL 3 VOLUMES OF THIS SERIES) --- Ninja Scroll TV Series was actually pretty good, regardless of some bad initial reviews I've read online. It's still not as good as the OVA, probably the best anime ever for those into violent swordplay dramas, because that was more serious, had better animation and a great overall ""style"". Granted TV series do not have the same animation budget as the OVAs and movies. I thoroughly liked the subtle humor in this series, it's not overdone or overexaggerated with funny faces, magical teardrops or the running in place B.S., especially the one-liners from Jubei when he laid the smackdown. The other thing I liked was how creative each ninja bad guy was designed. They seemed to have used the Dragonball Z'd template as every episode introduces 1-3 new ninja enemies that each have a certain look and power that talk a lot of garbage and then get their @sses handed to them. The 2nd Volume is kind of lame as they stretch out too little plot (with a couple of stand alone ""one off"" episodes), it all could have been wrapped up in 2 episodes instead of 4. Plus they changed the world a bit where there's technology present, at least in regards to some of the ninjas and their powers (i.e. guns, tires, electrical currents, butane flame, etc.)
I read somewhere that the creators wanted to distance themselves from the OVA even though they keep the characters of Jubei and the tiny old man with the hat and staff (can't remember his name). Some of the musical score was created by Kitaro, his first for an anime series. They replayed the same 5 themes over and over again, they are all pretty cool except for one of them which is like aggro 80's rock guitar, I don't know if he wrote that piece as it doesn't sound like his usual new age/traditional ""Japanese"" style work. Overall this series is definitely worth watching at least once, it's different when compared to the OVA, but still good on it's own merits. Maybe rent it first before buying if you are still on the fence. Good stuff !!!",1089676800,3,2045,4.574931880108992
1901054,4,B0000A1HOF,"I remember seeing the Ninja Scroll movie back in 1999 when i was just getting into anime. i thought it was bending backwards to accomodate testosterone-addled teen boys. i still do, but i've learned to appreciate the style and tone of the film.
the series takes a couple of the characters, and the general idea of the movie and completely changes the animation style and tone. its definitely less mindlessly violent, though still violent. i like the fact that its sort of liesurely paced, mainly because Jubei never loses his cool.
its not the greatest series i've ever seen, but its well produced, the music is actually pretty good, and its just fun and playful enough to almost act as a foil to the original film.
i recommend it, but know what you're getting. don't expect just more of what was served up with the original film and you'll enjoy it just fine.",1084406400,,860,4.627450980392157
1901055,3,B0000A1HOF,"I can't really say how the series is going to turn out. The whole thing started really good. It was just as gory and twisted as the movie. But, episode 4 was horrible. In the English version, Jubey was saying those corny lines before, during and after the fight and the animation of was horrible...they did these flash or aftereffect zooms that just made the quality of the series drop. I hope it gets better because it would be a waste to see something so good, go bad. Specially the character design of the girl (it's amazing - visually unique compared to a lot of anime characters faces).",1078099200,,591,4.481481481481482
1901056,4,B0000A1HOF,"i would say four is a little generous its more like a 3 1/2 but i cant do anything about that. I (like everyone eles) have some issues with this: first the sword thing; whats the point of watching if he kills everyone with that sonic sword thing. In the movie ( i counted) he does it 3 times but in the series its all he does. Then theres the new characters every episode; this is annoying because you really cant get into thier personality. There were things i did like however; Jubei is still a badass, there seems to be a plot(which beats to plot), and they kept the old guy who always had some funny trick.
overview:
~too many characters and they die too quickly
~uses sword thing way to much
~the characters that are used are just rip offs from the movie: the glass guy with the moths is almost exactly like the wasp guy, then theres the lady who can spawn the creatures from her skin is a rip off of that snake lady( i could go on with more rip offs)
goods:
~jubei is still the same old character
~ a plot is begining to unwind
~ old guy still kicks ass
overall id say its ok, not the best. But its worth renting (not nessecaily buying worthy), id give it another shot...",1074902400,,1177,4.166666666666667
1901057,1,B0000A1HOF,"If I could give this series a rating in the negative, I would. To begin with, the series is entirely different than the original movie, which was a huge disappointment. And I'm not talking a lower budget for animation, the whole feel has changed: they warp the characters of Jubei and Dakuan, they disregard plots and relationships from the original movie, and there is NOTHING original or even creative (original or not) to distinguish the story from any other anime.
Probably one of my largest gripes about Jubei's character in the series is his 'sonic' sword technique. Basically, instead of having to animate a fight scene, he just uses the same 'sonic' slicing technique to instantly kill every villain he encounters. In the movie, he used the technique maybe once or twice (against Tessai and Mushizo), and it was hardly a technique that defined his character. In the movie, he was just an exceedingly talented ninja. In the series, he's just like any other bum, only he's got a sword that can kill at long distance with only one blow. There's nothing to distinguish the villains in the series because they all die in about two seconds. Which leads me to my next point: The series is redundant.
In each episode Jubei encounters at least two totally uninspired villains (one guy made of glass summons moths... which, I don't know about you, but every time I'm asked what super-power I'd choose, I always pick this one) who die EVERY time. So if they're all dying... what do you do? Create more uninspired villains to kill off... because that's what makes a series great: non-repeating characters you don't care about. In the movie there were only 8 devils, which made them unique and interesting (and dare I say, believable?). There's nothing unique about the villains in the series, there's hundreds of them. By the end of the first DVD I'm under the impression that 85% of feudal Japan consists of super human freaks. And besides the unique nature that's missing from the movie, the characters in the series are totally outlandish. Example: a giant robotic Cyclops with a mechanical transmitting doll and mechanical bird that issues from his mouth... on top of that, the lead boss of the Kimones is a Buddha man whose torso rotates while bolts bob up and down from his head... UMMM... if that's the point where the viewer is supposed to say, ""WOW! Check out how cool the end boss is!"" Then this series should have hit the trashcan awhile ago. Besides being purely idiotic in design, this is supposed to be feudal Japan... And second, the most advanced thing in the movie was a primitive handgun...
For me, total let down. Even series with poor budgets can be very good with creative writing, developed characters, and involving plots (example: Berserk). With series like Cowboy Bebop, Neon Genesis, Giant Robo etc... Why even consider this series?
Recap: Poor Aspects -
Jubei can kill anything with one thrust at any range
Jubei and Dakuan have no previous history together
Jubei gets a quirky sense of humor
Villains come and go in about five seconds
Unoriginal multitude of villains don't hold a candle to the original 8 of the movie
Technology in feudal Japan?
And another Light Maiden along with a stone to protect from evil? OH PLEASE...
Good Aspects -
Only four episodes to labor through.
A lot of previews to good anime (Macross Plus, Perfect Blue, Twilight of the Dark Master)
My advice? Next time you're going to create a totally unoriginal Ninja Scroll series, just bring back Tessai so you'll at least have one cool character. And, since your not a two hour movie, you can keep the characters alive for more than 5 seconds, or better yet, one whole episode.",1066953600,7,3675,4.779874213836478
1901058,3,B0000A1HOF,"If you expecting the adept writing, design and pacing of the original movie, look no farther! - It isn't here.  None of it.  But if you just want some cut'm up samurai super hero action adventure...this MIGHT be your bag.
Taking the main characters and basic idea of the movie 'Ninja Scroll', MADHOUSE animation creates a series with very middle of the road effort in hopes of finding a gullible audience.  'Ninja Scroll' the movie succeeds in several ways this series doesnt.  1) The writing set up situations sequence by sequence culminating in a great multifaceted climax/dilemma.  There was almost NO flab writing in the movie; each scene had something to say on atleast two levels. 2) The movie established a 'normal' world and then branched into an encroaching, weird, darkness that threatened to take over the 'world'.  3) Characters were caught in moral dilemma and weaving through a tretcherous, thread of a path to save themselves and their world from chaos and destruction.  The series has none of that, and is piling up characters with weak reasons and personalities.  Freakish villains abound, and die quickly, for no real reason.  Is everyone in this world a samurai, super freak or ninja??  Where is feudal Japan???  This probably plays well to the younger crowd who want to see nice drawings and fight scenes.  Anyone else, beware.  The title doesn't transfer quality from movie to series.",1063497600,3,1405,4.952991452991453
1901059,3,B0000A1HOF,"I'm not quite sure what I expected when I picked this up.  It's been long enough since I saw the original film that inspired by this series that all my mushy brain cells can really remember is that I enjoyed it a great deal.  Given the success of the release of 'X' as a series developed from a film, I decided to dive in.  What I found was both more... and less.
The series, like the film documents the adventures of Jubei Kibagami, a legendary Japanese samurai.  In the film he is a sleepy character who keeps getting dragged into a conflict between two ninja clans - the Hiruko and the Kimon.  Not ordinary ninja either, but half-human creatures with gruesome habits.  They are fighting over a dragon stone and the light maiden, whose fate is somehow tangled up with the stone.
When the village that guarded Shigure (the light maiden) is attacked by the Kimon clan she barely escapes with her life, and the dragon stone falls into Jubei's hands.  He sets out to return it to her and the adventure begins.  Eventually the travelers will include Dakuan, a wizened old 'monk,' and Tsubute, a thief, as they try to stay alive and solve the mysteries of the stone.
Expect a good deal of wild ninja style goings on and the requisite amount of gore and you won't be disappointed.  Dialog is adequate, but only Jubei has the spark of wit and charm.  I found the art a bit weak as well, colorful, but lacking in the detail that we have come to expect in modern anime.  Consider this Ninja Scroll lite.  In addition, the series is only slated for thirteen episodes.
On the other hand the music features primary themes by Kitaro, with Peter McEvilley doing the shorter work.  An exceptional team for any anime project, and they do a wonderful job on the DVD.  On the whole I think this will be a good series to watch, but so far it lacks the intensity of the original.  If that is what you were expecting, this will be a disappointment.",1063152000,5,1928,4.4375
1901060,1,B0000A1HOF,"All right, I loved the original ninja Scroll.  Personally, I think it is, aside from the Samurai X Trust & Betrayel set, the best anime of the genre.  I bought my copy three years ago and it is still played pretty frequintly.  As a fencer, as well as a fantasy buff, I think the fights are excellent and better chereographed than many live action movies, and the story itself is both well written and executed.  For years, I have hoped for some kind of sequel or follow up.  I wanted the story of Jubei to continue.
This was not what I had in mind.  Having just bought the DVD of the Ninja Scroll series, I managed to get halfway through the second episode before I turned it off in disgust.  This is an abomination, and in fact an insult to a superb piece of anime.  Want a comparison?  Think Highlander.  Then think Highlander 2:  The Quickening.  Evil, I tell you, evil.  Don't buy this.  Watch the original movie again, then spend your money on something more worthwhile.  Like Pez.  Or an extra roll of ducttape.  Anything but this DVD.",1063065600,5,1041,4.423280423280423

I understand that this is a series and the drawing would not be close to the detail that was accomplished in the movie. The writing and plot development, there is no excuse for it being so poor.
