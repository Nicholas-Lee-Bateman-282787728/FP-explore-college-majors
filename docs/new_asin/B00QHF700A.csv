Worst yoga video ever.
Poor audio quality and not actual classes.",1504051200,2,77,5.0
8691329,1,B00QHF700A,Disappointed as I thought this would be a live class. It's actually still photos.,1503792000,3,81,4.857142857142857
8691330,1,B00QHF700A,"Going in Garbage. Who wants to do a Yoga session while following along with still pictures ? Yes pictures are good to improve the posture of the poses, but not for following along a 60 min class. Why didn't do they do a full video of a class? Plus the narrators voice is like nails on a chalkboard. Not relaxing or soothing at all.",1485216000,4,331,4.1875
8691331,5,B00QHF700A,"I too fell in love with the Bikram classes,but the class schedule and my inconsistent work schedule, meant that I ended up not being able to go, wasting money and resenting it.
This DVD is the exact class.  Same postures and sequences.  PERSONALLY, I prefer the audio and still photos. I focus more on myself and and can almost meditate while practicing.  So, that was an unexpected surprise.
Upside, I can practice anytime. ALONE.  This helps me focus more and I seem to hold postures better.  I also don't feel insecure about my body, or falling out of posture and knocking people down around me. Haha. In class I'm always distracted by looking at others and feeling like I don't belong.  I also feel like I'm always thinking about the clock and time commitment.  Fretting about things I needed to do and being away from my family wasn't helpful either.  I also like that I can shorten the class if I need to, due to time constraints.
Now I can practice whenever it suits my schedule, I feel much more calm and happy.  I enjoy doing it right before bed.  I have been sleeping much better and need less sleep.
Downside, I can't get my room hot enough.  85 is about the max, and I miss the intense heat and sweating.  Obviously, that issue has nothing to do with the product.
I was a little nervous because of the price, But I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This DVD was EXACTLY what I was looking for.",1483660800,4,1409,4.439688715953308
8691332,5,B00QHF700A,"I am a Bikram Yoga fan.  I can't afford to go to a class on a daily basis.  Of course Bikram doesn't sell a dvd, and doesn't allow others to do so.  So on Youtube, you can find individual poses, but even if you put them into a correct order play list, its still a nuisance to go from one pose to the other; too much transitional blah-blah-blah.

So this DVD gets around the lame Bikram restrictions by providing a live audio of a class, but shows multiple stills with additional written tips simultaneously.

I use to teach the beginner Bikram class when the normal instructor could not do it. I highly approve of this DVD.  Its the closest thing to a real Bikram Hot Room Yoga Class with the 21 poses in the correct order.

There is another DVD on Amazon similar to this but the poses deviate from the 21 poses that a Bikram Beginner Class does.

If you want strength, stamina, endurance and balance in your work out conditioning, and have never tried a Bikram Yoga class, I strongly recommend it. I once challenged a friend who instructs many workout classes per day all day every day and this beginner class not only kicked her butt, she is now a Bikram instructor.

There is no substitute for going to the class, and that is how you get addicted to it, but the next best thing to the class is this DVD.  But I recommend going to a class or two or three before doing the DVD.  The DVD is great to work on individual postures and to stay into the protocol when time or circumstances do not permit you to attend a class on a consistent basis. But there is no replacing going to the real class which is why the DVD restriction is so lame.

As with all Yoga, Brian Kest said it best.  ""Be where you are at.""  Don't go so far into the pose to where your muscles begin to quiver and shake.  That interrupts the breathing, and the breathing is the key to therapy. So go into the pose, challenge yourself to the point that it doesn't affect your breathing or muscle quiver.  After the class it will feel like the best message you have ever had because your spine has decompressed, toxins have been excreted and you are invigorated and refreshed.

Bottom line: This DVD is an exceptional learning tool and great home class. I highly recommend this instructor.  Because I have done this so long, I don't even to face the TV, I face the mirror, and just hear the class.  I believe Bikram sells an audio class too, but till he gets off his totally gripless DVD restrictions, I won't get it...

 I use a Vornado TVH600 Whole Room Vortex Heater to economically heat the room.",1455840000,27,2564,4.34453781512605
8691333,4,B00QHF700A,"The DVD along with the book are an excellent way for me to be able to enhance my bikram hot yoga practice. The book details the poses out very explicitly and the photographs show all the permutations of the pose and I'm especially happy with the breakdown of how to fix what it is that may be going wrong. During a classroom setting in a large group, no matter how good the teacher there are just some things that you miss and this book and DVD are excellent ways for me to improve my practice at home.",1440374400,6,502,4.185567010309279

I also find it quite helpful for days when I can't make the drive to a class.  I haven't tried the DVD with heat , however, may this summer.  A Great Buy!",1426550400,5,273,3.754385964912281
