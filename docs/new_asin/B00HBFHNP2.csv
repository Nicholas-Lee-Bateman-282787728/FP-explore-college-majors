8631478,5,B00HBFHNP2,"This is a very unique movie. I loved the way it is made, only using Herb Kane's artwork, with a narrator and Hawaiian music. A difficult challenge that Paul Csige pulled off very well. It is the story about the ""voyage"" of those who became the first Hawaiians.
If you like movie that only give you entertainment, just telling you a story, you may be disappointed. This film is more than that, it is a piece of Artwork.",1362355200,,418,4.371794871794871
8631479,2,B00HBFHNP2,I had hoped for much better based on the other blurbs I read before deciding to purchase. Really disappointed. This DVD does not really tell the story of the first Hawaiians. I had expected something really engaging and it was not.,1340064000,,231,4.658536585365853
