8138987,1,B000HDRB2A,The information was accurate however the narration was extremely boring and dull.  David Starkey's Monarchy was much much better.  I wish I could return it.,1408233600,,156,5.2

8138989,3,B000HDRB2A,"Amateurish production, but better narration (and audio quality) than Monarchy.  In my book, the best of the series is Charles I.",1377388800,,128,5.095238095238095
