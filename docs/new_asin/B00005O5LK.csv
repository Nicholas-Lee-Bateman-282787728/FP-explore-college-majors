I'm not kidding, it is so similar. Not that I mind, both are good. There is the usual amount of hijinks and humor in this episode-sized Xmas special. A bit too much emphasis is placed on the madcap antics instead of building a nice Xmasy feel. Though I think that the voice actress playing Penny is a bit too young.

Not a waste of time, but not an annual classic.",1355011200,2,715,5.990196078431373
1640563,5,B00005O5LK,Inspector Gadget was my favorite cartoon when I was young and I was very happy to find this Christmas movie. Me and my children really enjoy watching this dvd and it brings back a lot of childhood memories for me.,1294704000,,213,4.35
1640564,5,B00005O5LK,if your looking for a christmas cartoon special look no futher this is worth buying especially if your a fan of inspector gadget from the 80s,1245715200,,141,4.461538461538462
1640565,5,B00005O5LK,My grandson was a Super Hero fan but has changed his allegiance to Inspector Gadget. He plays it over and over and gives it gets 5 stars.  Don Adams' voice on this one is wonderful!,1244678400,,181,4.171428571428572
1640566,5,B00005O5LK,Another example of good clean humor. This cartoon was popular back in the late 80's early 90's but kids today still love the amusing antics of Inspector Gadget.,1231200000,,160,4.75
1640567,3,B00005O5LK,"This is an unusual DVD. It has the 1992 ""Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas"" special, as well as three extra episodes from 1983. The special is pretty neat, and the animation is a bit similar to the old series, but with newer music, as well as the original voice cast, too! The three episodes are neat, especially ""So It Is Written."" Actually, I would've preferred some more winter-themed episodes instead of the other three episodes here, such as ""Gone Went the Wind"" or ""The Coo-Coo Clock Caper."" However, like ""The Gadget Files"" and ""The Original Series"" DVD set from Shout! Factory, this one has its faults...

PROS
Three good episodes, with a fancy Christmas episode to go with it.

CONS
The lack of special features, and the following edits...

EDITS
The title of each episode is electronically added at the start of the episodes. When these cartoons originally aired, they had no episode titles!
The public service announcements at the end of the 1983 episodes were cut-and-pasted; they were taken out of the episodes and used as special features. This was highly unnecessary.
On the old episodes, the original DiC closing featuring Inspector Gadget dotting the ""i""  in the logo was cut. It was replaced with the ""Incredible World of DiC"" logo. The old LBS logo is also gone, while the Shout Factory DVD set keeps the LBS logo. The special also has the Kid in Bed plastered with the new DiC logo. This was completely ridiculous.

Overall, if you remember the ""Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas"" special, or if you just want to see the show again, this is the DVD for you.",1141257600,,1575,4.775735294117647
1640568,4,B00005O5LK,"Seven years after the original series ceased its original run, ""Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas"" was released as a prime-time special in December 1992.

Gadget is back (and still voiced by Don Adams), and this time, he has to rescue Santa and his hypnotized elves from his old adversary, Dr. Claw.  It's up to Gadget, with some help from his niece Penny and loyal dog Brain, to put a stop to his plot to give Santa a bad name.

Most revival series, specials and movies aren't usually up to par, but this one is actually pretty good.  Gadget fans will appreciate the similarites between this special and the original series, as opposed to the live-action movie with Matthew Broderick.

Pros:

*Gadget is still voiced by Don Adams.

*Most of the reoccuring gags are still used such as the exploding message, lines such as ""Chief, is that you? ...you're where?""  Also, Gadget still uses most of his original gadgets: gadget handcuffs, gadget copter, gadget legs, and so on.

*Penny and Brain are still a significant part of the episode.

*Three additional episodes from the series are included with the special: ""The Weather in Tibet"", ""So It Is Written"" and ""Birds of a Feather""

Cons:

*Unlike the original series, the music for the special was not by Haim Saban & Shuki Levy, but the music is still good nonetheless.  (Although there is really nothing that can compare with the original score of the show.) Naturally, the three extra episodes' music are by Saban/Levy so that should be some consolation.

*This Christmas special was a bit more light-hearted than the original series, but it doesn't seem to take away from the charm of the show.

Overall, any Gadget fan would enjoy this.  Hopefully, DiC will continue to release additional episodes of the original series.",1101859200,14,1773,4.86
1640569,2,B00005O5LK,"I had seen Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas and I was rather embarassed by it. For one thing, the animation here seems like it was targeted for really small kids. The old animated series was done in the Japanese anime style (fact is, all the animation was made in Japan). With Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas, it looks like all the animation was made right here in America and it comes across as being surprisingly childish, while the original series was anything but childish. I guess the point here was they were trying to target this version of Inspector Gadget to the same kids who watch Barney, totally forgetting that there were plenty of people at that time (1992) who remembered the original series (simply because Nickelodeon was airing it on regular basis at that time, and still did until recently, now ABC Family, formerly Fox Family airs it). While Dr. Claw still sounds like his old self and you still don't see his face, and Penny and Brain is still doing Gadget's real work, I find this really dumbed down and really lacks the charm and appeal of the original series. To me I think this is a disgrace to the Inspector Gadget name, but I can be only thankful it's not quite as bad as the non-animated Disney made in 1999.",1006992000,12,1237,4.601809954751131

7948395,5,B00005O5LK,"You won't find this Christmas classic from 1992 with Inspector Gadget's original series set, nor in any of the single season sets! Dr. Claw plans to usurp Santa himself and take over Christmas AND the whole world; but the only things standing in his way are Inspector Gadget's bumbling antics, and the smart and faithful heroics of his niece Penny and pooch Brain! It's a shame Cinedigm's DVD of this special has no bonuses at all; somehow, a much older DVD from another company called Sterling, before Mill Creek became popular, is still being sold new here on Amazon, and has a few extras and a bunch of Retromercials of other DiC/Cookie Jar shows on VHS and DVD from said company. If you thought something was missing from Gadget's original series set, look no further than Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas! Add Gadget's Christmas DVD to the original series set today, or for your Christmas menegaries if you want to, whether from Cinedigm or from Sterling! By the way, happy 25th anniversary, over a month late, to Gadget's great mission to save Santa, Christmas, and the whole world!",1517097600,,1088,4.823529411764706

7948401,4,B00005O5LK,"On the 1st day of Christmas 2016 I'm going to review...Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas. The animation is not great but ok by tv standards. The voice acting is not great but pretty good. The story is silly but fun in a Saturday morning cartoon kind of way. The downsides are Cree Summer being replaced by Erica Horne as the voice of Penny (even though Erica did her best), The theme song for the special is sloppy and not as good as the original,  Inspector Gadget doing more harm than good in trying to save Christmas such as torturing the real Santa with things like tickling, The creepy nature of the Elves such as their pronouncing words that sound like swearing and Penny still not getting credit in helping for stopping Dr. Claw. Overall, with a title like that, fans should know what to expect. I give this special a 8 of out 10.",1481673600,,836,4.4640522875816995
