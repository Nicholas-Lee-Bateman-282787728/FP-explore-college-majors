4713220,5,B005JX89WE,"this is excellent christmas movie for the family! Its different but excellent, in its own way! We all love it!",1322006400,7,110,4.55
4713221,1,B005JX89WE,I bought this movie because it was recommended when I was purchasing a Barbie Christmas movie. Guess I should have read more about this before buying because this is NOT a movie for children.  I was watching it with my 4 year old and ended up shutting it off because the characters scared her so much.  Not at all like other Nut Cracker stories.,1322006400,12,345,4.375
4713222,1,B005JX89WE,"The reason there are so few reviews of this film is because NO ONE CARES ABOUT SEEING IT! Elle looks about 10 in this so it probably sat on the shelf at least a few years before it was thrust upon the world. This film is so misguided, so poorly acted, so embarrassing, so inappropriately politically charged, so overblown and ultimately so BORING, it makes CITY OF EMBER (another big budget financial disaster) look like Raiders of the Lost Ark. The ""lost somewhere in translation"" seems to be from the Russian director and English speaking cast, a similar problem arose in the 1976 Blue Bird, only Nutcracker COST 90 MILLION TO MAKE and made back just under 700k in the US and to knowledge didn't even make it into a 3D theater!

I dare people to suffer through it, but if you want a brilliant adaptation of Nutcracker, PLEASE see the 1986 version by Carrol Ballard and design by the ""Where the Wild Things Are"" artist Maurice Sendak, and avoid this film, unless you're drunk, stoned or bed ridden.",1321833600,18,999,4.581005586592179
4713223,5,B005JX89WE,"This is a fun movie. Very entertaining.  I own the Blu-ray.

I wanted to follow up on a comment made by one of the other reviewers.

""This is rated PG, but the story is of the Rat King who loves to take children's toys and burn them. When a child cries, he memorializes their tears in posters he lines his halls with to be able to revisit the terror and sadness he causes.""

Good to know this in case you don't want your children watching such material. If you have very young kids perhaps you can preview it before deciding to let them watch.
 Personally I think it adds to the emotion you feel for the kids and also what you feel against the Rat King. My two cousins both under 10yo watched this with us and they enjoyed it as much as I did.

Like I said in my other review in the Blu-ray section, this is a great film and my whole family loved it.

My only regret is not being able to see it in 3-D at the theater.",1321488000,,917,4.0054945054945055
4713224,5,B005JX89WE,"Great movie. I watched it with the family and everyone enjoyed it. Excellent special effects,sets and costumes along with interesting characters kept us all entertained through out the entire movie. The blu-ray is a great transfer both sound and picture.
 Hopefully in the future the theatrical 3-D version will be available.",1321488000,8,325,5.372549019607843
4713225,4,B005JX89WE,"I think this movie got unfair reviews. Sure if you are looking for classical version of the Nutcracker this is not the film for you. But this modern version is a enjoyable film to watch and the characters are delightful. I like how it focuses on Nutcracker and Mary's fight against the rat king and his mother's evil spell, since I always thought the battle between the nutcracker and the mouse king was too short in the original version.",1321056000,4,438,4.556962025316456
4713226,5,B005JX89WE,"This one will be a classic one day.  A wonderful and complicated story told in a most grad way.  Imagine a ""Gone with the Wind"" version of a ""Nutcracker"", you will laugh and cry, and before it ends you would want more of it.",1320710400,3,224,4.068181818181818
4713227,5,B005JX89WE,I totally disagree with the previous reviewer. This is a great family movie. I do love the flamboyant characters. I laughed outloud quite a bit. I love that they put words to the traditional songs. I would so watch this movie again!,1320537600,3,232,4.5476190476190474
4713228,1,B005JX89WE,"This is rated PG, but the story is of the Rat King who loves to take children's toys and burn them.  When a child cries, he memorializes their tears in posters he lines his halls with to be able to revisit the terror and sadness he causes.  We had to turn this off.  It is nothing like the trailer leads you to believe. Even the special effects or whatever you want to call it, were not high quality.  The major characters were quite flamboyant, in a Hollywood kind of way with the swaying hips of the men and the long fingernails and feminine gait.  Not recommended for traditional family viewing pleasure. A big disappointment as we wanted to enjoy the Nutcracker in preparation for the upcoming season.",1320451200,4,705,4.519685039370079

4713230,5,B005JX89WE,Great spin on a classic tale!  My 3 and 5 year old boys love it. It's hard getting boys into this story without the great battle scenes between the Prince and the Rat King. Very creative,1487721600,,186,4.166666666666667
4713231,3,B005JX89WE,"Confusing and I really don't like the WWII aspect, though I will admit it was done cleverly.  Adore the adorable young Elle Fanning and this is my favorite ballet and Christmas story.  I prefer the animated Nutcracker Prince.  Also I highly recommend both animated and stop-animated The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus films.  I think that is the title.  It is also a book.",1486252800,,376,4.723076923076923

4713236,1,B005JX89WE,"What can say about a director that manages to turn a holiday icon into a dark twisted tale about Nazi rats.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and say what we are all thinking.  WWII bad, holocaust bad - not one of humanity's bright points.  Now, however, maybe it is time to get on with life and put a little of the past behind us.  Do Nazis still have to be the villain of every other movie?  Might I suggest therapy rather than dragging audiences down this path over and over and over and over....

The movie is just awful.  A few highlights at the start and some nice imagery, quickly descends into a mess of a picture.  I would say this movie would be enjoyable for about 0% of the viewing audience Albert Einstein?  Why?

I really can't say much else but this one is for the garbage can and not worth your purchase/time.",1468108800,,827,4.177215189873418
4713237,4,B005JX89WE,"Well, I saw this movie and, I really loved the visual and Elle Fanning as well very much.
But the story and the meaning of Christmas Holliday's sake, the original meaning of The Nutcraker's sake, it was not a classical achievement as well as as a musical movie, it can't be my top 10 musical list.
The music scores were not that great and didn't touched my feelings that much.
Only Elle Fanning's singing was kind of ok.
But, but the wooden Nutcraker's being alive was amazing and all the decoration of the model house and snowy island of the dreamy fairy taled world creation was amazing.

Also when the wooden Nutcraker turned into a real human beeing, he was so beautiful as well. The way how they defeat the evil king was kind of too easy to me but it was Elle Fanning's dream after all so it was forgivable.
But that moring when the real alive Nutcraker prince reappeared as a boy next door, that was kind of cool.

John Turturro acted as a evil king was kind of ok. He had some kind of a color of his own.

Above all this movie was not that bad like many people tried to bury it.
The director was kind of a well known guy who made movies like <TANGO& CASH><RUNAWAY TRAIN>.
He knew how to control this big budget none Hollywood European movie after all.
But still the musical part was not forgivably bad.

But again the production design covered that badness of the musical part for me.

And again Elle Fanning was so cute and beautiful.

Girls can't be good at strategy and need to care about what they look like after saving someone's life.  Terrible messages for children or adults.  Boo!",1449360000,6,476,4.511627906976744

HE LOVES IT, and has wanted to to watch it over and over.  I don't completely the understand the fear described by the other reviewers. Anyone who is familiar with the story/ballet should understand that the original story line is a little cruel, as are most fairy tales (good vs. evil and all that). This story teaches respect for others and their property; sibling relationships; believing in yourself and others, as well as sacrifice and loyalty. Again, my grandson loves it, and has watched it with friends and cousins who range in age from 4 to 11 who have all enjoyed the film.

4713258,1,B005JX89WE,"Despite its heavy promotion as a kid's movie, children under, say, 25 should be kept well away from this ill-begotten spectacle. It's about 5% ETA Hoffmann (the 1816 author of the original Nutcracker and Mouse-King story), 5% Tchaikovsky ballet, but the remaining 90% is a  mess of distracting subplots, horrific makeup and CGI effects, creaky dialog, and film-student cinematography.

To her credit, Miss Fanning bravely obliges the scriptwriter, songwriter and director, but the compassion we feel in watching her is out of embarassment over her being made to say, sing, and act the stuff she did. Nathan Lane glibly phones it in as ""Uncle Albert"", an Einsteinian character inexplicably replacing Godfather Drosselmeyer of the original story. And while I usually enjoy John Torturro's roles, he seems uneasy and maybe regretful over the script and verse of his Mouse-King, er, Rat-Fhrer, er, whatever...

Animal Cruelty: vivid but pointless electrocution-killing of a captive shark.
Cheap Allegory: making over Hoffmann's mouse-army into Nazi rat-stormtroopers.
Cheap frights: CGI-enabled overdone transformation of faces into hideous shrieking rat-faces. Jump scares aplenty.
Musical assault and battery: characters break into stage-musical or campy song for no compelling reason. Tchaikovsky brutally rescored, or rearranged into braying parodies of the original classical themes.
Child-Abuse pervo stuff: an 11-year old girl being dragged and pushed around, being compelled to wear torn and disarrayed clothing shot at sleazy camera angles, having to repeatedly mouth lines like ""I'm not afraid"" when the audience knows she has good reason to be very afraid indeed, as when being threatened with mutilation.

Fanning's Mary seems to have no clearly defined journey, faces no life-altering challenge, and demonstrates no improved attributes by the end, so the movie's a bit farcical. Sure, the parents become more parent-like, and the kid brother a little less annoying, but these should have been side characters, not allowed dramatically to distract from Mary's journey.

Ultimately this is not so much an ""untold"" version of Hoffmann's Nutcracker, but a disappointing nightmarish makeover. Maybe the Russian director's dog-eared Cold War-era screenplay should have been finally binned instead of actually produced...",1423094400,12,2323,5.702312138728324

This Movie was produced when relationships thawed between the West and Russia.  The Producer/Director Andrei Khonchalovsky and his staff hail from the United Kingdom, Hungary and the Russian Ballet of Russia.  In College classes in the USA and travel in Europe, I developed an appreciation for literature like Grimm's Fairy Tales and classic music like the Russian Composer Tchaikovsky to create his music for this iconic ballet based on the story, the Nutcracker.  The young actors, Elli Fanning as Mary and Charlie Rowe as the human Prince/Nutcracker are superb to complete this production.  An uninformed viewer may miss-understand contents of this Nutcracker because it has themes from an Eastern European point of view. In a Grimm Fairy Tale, there is a main character that is very scary but is conquered by a good hero or heroine. Rats have a double meaning for the East:  Many plagues and death were caused by rats; so Rats are a symbol of Nazism, Fascism or any form of Tyranny.  The Rat King in this movie is a narcissistic, wannabe demagogue - and his teeth show it!  I read about complaints how the animation scared youngsters:  What about some of the video games they use?!  What is the difference?  The difference is in
the metaphor - In the Nutcracker: The Untold Story, the metaphor is about hope - and a better world for the young!  I am pleased to have this DVD and applaud the Russians, Eastern Europeans, and the West for a joint effort to give the young everywhere hope for a better world.  The Nutcracker:  The Untold Story is a superb effort in that direction.  Well done!  Author!  Author!

4713276,3,B005JX89WE,"Genuinely strange big-budget children's film bombed when it received its original theatrical release and received extremely bad reviews.  The story concerns a young girl (an excellent Elle Fanning) in the early 1900's.  Her wooden nutcracker doll comes to life and turns out to be a boy prince who was cursed.  She travels to his kingdom and helps him defeat the Rat King (a very amusing John Turturro) who has taken over and enslaved the population.

Some reviewers are claiming that this movie is not appropriate for children--I guess that depends on how bland you think children's entertainment needs to be to be appropriate.  The Nutcracker: The Untold Story is about the power of imagination and friendship.  There is less violence than a child could see on a typical network television program and not a single character in the movie dies, not even the villains.  So what exactly is so objectionable?

Some adults seem to be disturbed by the fact that the villains are loosely modeled on the Nazis.  While that is certainly true it's not something that small children are likely to pick up on or be disturbed by.  And the villains are not Nazis--the Rat King burns children's toys in a huge factory to create a dark cloud that keeps the sun from shining down into the kingdom and his soldiers are more bumbling than menacing.  The Rat King also has a habit of breaking into song, which makes him even less scary.

If Elle Fanning and her prince (and, eventually, her bratty little brother) can shut down the factory the sun will shine on the streets again and the rats will be forced to retreat to the sewers because they can't stand sunlight.

Sounds really, really adult, doesn't it?

The special effects and production design are both excellent but what's most interesting about them is that with the exception of the metallic rat dogs and the Rat King's occasionally trans-morphing face they don't looks like CGI--they looks like effects you might have seen in classic Hollywood films.  It's like the makers of the film traveled back in time and grabbed the set-designers from Metropolis and the special-effects people from The Wizard of Oz and got them to work on the film.  A sequence where Fanning dances through the air with a line of fairies could have easily come from Fantasia era Disney.

The numerous songs are a bit of a surprise.  Unfortunately, they aren't especially tuneful--although, when delivered by John Turturro's prancing Rat King, they are at least amusing.

The pacing is unnecessarily draggy.  The movie was obviously a labor of love for Andrei Koncholovsky (Runaway Train) who directed, co-wrote and co-produced, and you get the impression that he couldn't bring himself to cut because he loved the world that he had created too much.

The Nutcracker is far from perfect but it's unlike any other children's film you are likely to see, is pretty wonderful visually and features very nice turns from Elle Fanning (in one of her first roles) and John Turturro, who seems to be having a blast playing the song and dance loving villain.

I would say it's absolutely fine for children with decent attention spans--it's even possible that their parents will enjoy it as well.",1387584000,8,3203,4.870848708487085

Now, if you can watch this on it's own merits without the comparing apples to oranges, you may find you really like it.  This is a remarkable production of a very different kind of story.  It is not a Christmas story except in the sense it happens at Christmas.  It is a tale of magic, love, humor, and yes, some light PG violence.  It is a story of good triumphing over evil, and it is truly beautifully done.  A number of people seem to complain about the Nazi inspired rat army, but really, what better symbol for evil is there?

4713283,5,B005JX89WE,"What the amateur, as well as most of the professional critics, missed entirely is that this isn't a story about a Christmas fantasy, nor is it a story about the Holocaust, it's the story of the enslavement of children and their subsequent joyous liberation.  All children, like Mary, have to leave the magical world of childhood, but some return to be amused by critics who can't understand that their early enslavement never ended.  You can count on Roger Ebert to get every film concerning childhood disastrously wrong.  If only Roger hadn't grown up.

  Evil rats are scary?  And the flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz weren't?  I admit, nobody got hit with those terrifying monkeys expecting to see a lovely ballet.  Oh, and should we mention the witch threatening a little girl with annihilation, and her little dog too?  And while we're on the subject, what about a witch who cooks children in her oven - even checks them daily for fatness while they wait helplessly in a cage?  Need I go on?

  I understand that the packaging was faulty.  If you put the rat on the cover, it might separate the viewer who like tales of good
triumphing over evil - especially tales of liberation - from the ballet fan.  And luring in the ballet fan with a promise of seeing their beloved Nutcracker is a bit much.  But it has little to do with the merits of the film.  Blame the marketers, not the artistic director.  If you caught the actual vision, you'd have some idea of why he wanted to make this film for twenty years.  He did what he dreamed he'd do.  He simply underestimated the mental level of the typical audience and their beloved critics.  It's an old story, and we've seen it over and over again.",1386460800,2,1700,4.541254125412541

The sleigh rides, the feathery snow, a town that is dickons in its winter setting.

4713299,4,B005JX89WE,"I found it a highly imaginative treatment of the renowned classic where the Nutcracker along with the heroine and her friends battle the Nazi-like forces of evil led by the Rat King. It is no more frightening for children than Grimm's fairy tales or many other animated features such as Myazaki's Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke. I do see it as more suited for older children and adults. As always, parental guidance should be exercised.

Tchaikovsky's music is used in the score and several songs have lyrics set to his melodies. I did not find these very memorable except for one titled ""Relativity"" sung by Nathan Lane's character who resembles Albert Einstein.

Many of the negative reviews and opinions might stem from the expectation that the film would follow the beloved traditional Nutcracker more closely than it does. The title, The Nutcracker:The Untold Story, should tell us we will be viewing a non-traditional version. By the way, this is the title on the DVD and the way it is listed on Amazon. IMDb uses the alternate title, The Nutcracker in 3D, which may be misleading.

Two critics I respect and with whom I often agree, Leonard Maltin and Roger Ebert, have panned this film unmercifully.

The problem is we all have this sparkling, magical, happy association with Christmas, well not everyone, but most of us, try our best to make it the happiest time of the year for our children, And the Nutcracker has been a part of this American festive occasion for two generations.

4713310,3,B005JX89WE,"How to describe this film?
...
In two words: fantastically weird.

Keep in mind, I am a 19-year-old with a taste for the odd and surreal. I rather liked this film, though there are a number of things they could have done better.

First off, the cover is a bit misleading. This movie is not all sparkly and fluffy. There a number of dark changes to the story, the most prominent being that the rats are a parallel to Nazi Germany.
...
Well, as the creators put it, ""there's no story without conflict"".

The story adheres more to the original tale by E. T. A. Hoffman instead of the famous Tchaikovsky musical. There is music from Tchaikovsky, but not enough. There are only around three Tchaikovsky songs. Original lyrics were made up to go along with them. Weather or not this was a good decision is up to the viewer. The rest of the songs were made specifically for the film. The best one is the Rat King's song, which demonstrates that he can be both wicked and comical (though, you wanna watch out for sudden shark electrocution). John Turturro delivers a fine performance. Although, I wish they'd have chosen a different hair style for him.

The Nutcracker's wooden form is just plain creepy. Although apparently that's what they were going for, as a lot of antique German nutcrackers were quite ugly. Despite this, the Nutcracker's appearance is easily countered by his ridiculously high-pitched, scratchy voice. I nearly burst out laughing the first time I heard it!

The Rat World is portrayed as a dark, industrial, iron-built place. It perfectly shows how antagonistic the rats are compared to the Nutcracker's cheery, colorful world. The steampunk-esque technology the rats use make them quite intimidating. The rats' main goal is to burn all the children's toys to create enough smoke to blot out the sun. Yes, this sounds weird, but hey, nobody ever questioned the Wicked Witch's death by water in the Wizard of Oz. Or Pippi Longstocking's astounding physical strength. Or Christopher Robin talking to stuffed animals. Basically, what I'm saying is, lighten up people.

The actors in this film give a fabulous performance, especially the charming Elle Fanning. I had a little trouble with the little brother's character, though. With Max (yes, Max, not Fritz. Don't ask. I don't know) you either want to smack him or give him a hug. There are two different sides to the character, and I don't feel the director managed to bridge these two sides properly. Nevertheless, the young actor plays the role very well. Nathan Lane as ""Albert Einstein"" in place of Uncle Drosselmeyer is certainly ... amusing. Certainly adds a metaphysical element to the film.

The story is done nicely, but I feel the end of the climax could have been handled better. (SPOILER: the Rat King escapes retribution. END SPOILER) Also, I wish there more fairies and toy characters. Too many flesh-and-blood humans. There were also one or two awkward moments that could have been handled differently. Such as when the Rat Queen bites her son. Or the Rat King suddenly bears his unattractively large rat teeth. Brrr...
All-in-all, it's a charmingly dark yet fantastic film with amazing visual-effects, but is suitable only for the weird of heart. Wonderful holiday nightma-er-DREAMS await you! Families beware, for the Nutcracker comes this year!!",1324166400,8,3328,4.932142857142857

4713313,2,B005JX89WE,"Having just caught the talented Elle Fanning in the movie Super 8, and knowing how good of an actor John Turturro can be (Johnny Depp movie, Monk's brother), I thought I'd buy The Nutcracker: The Untold Story from Amazon without first seeing it.

Boy, what a big mistake!

This DVD starts out well, with lovely atmosphere, unique musical numbers (written by Oscar-winner Tim Rice), great special effects and solid acting (despite Nathan Lane's perpetually quizzical visage as Albert Einstein and a wooden Frances de le Tour).

My whole family and I were transfixed, especially as the wooden nutcracker (in awesome CGI) and Mary ride an enchanted elevator sleigh up through a humongous towering Christmas tree. We had no idea what would happen next, because this ""re-telling"" of The Nutcracker had been unpredictable from the beginning (e.g. Einstein replacing Uncle Drosselmeier, Mary's mother being an opera singer about to make her debut in front of important politicians, etc.).

However, once they got into the realm of the Rat King, things start getting dicey--violent and creepy, even.

The Rat King (Turturro) and his minions all have rat faces, resembling Hitler's SS in uniform and demeanor (I can handle that--it makes sense). However, things soon turn violent (beyond capturing citizens of the magical kingdom).

For example, a large shark swims in a gigantic aquarium. He doesn't appear menacing beyond being a shark. The Rat King, as he's threatening the captured citizens with a bizarre musical routine, deliberately drops electrical lights in the aquarium. The poor shark thrashes about, as he's being electrocuted--not for a few seconds, but MANY seconds. It was distressful and disturbing to watch.

My family and I were in shock. Soon after, the Rat Queen (the Rat King's mother) summons Turturro's character. She is unkempt, drunken and barely dressed--wearing fishnet stockings (!). In a creepy Oedipal moment, she urges her son to come closer...and as he bends down for her to tell him a secret, she BITES him (hard and long).

That was it for us!

If you're wanting a magical family Christmas movie, this is NOT the one to get! However, if you revel in ""dark"", twisted holiday fairytales, you may get your jollies out The Nutcracker: The Untold Story.

I hated this movie so much and wish my children had never seen it, that I am writing this review on Amazon and I didn't even buy it online here. I bought it out of the $10 WalMart bin - no wonder it was in there. Don't waste your money or scare your children!!!!!! As I am writing this review tonight, my 6 year old and 2 year old have already called me crying because they can't get the rat king out of their head! just awful.",1323129600,50,1505,4.171821305841925

For context, upon seeing the abominable-looking trailers last year, my friends and I were disappointed at not having found the time to watch this train-wreck in theaters. After finding it online and watching the first ten minutes or so, I was surprised to find it strangely-paced but not quite in ""so-bad-it's-good"" territory. I opened Rotten Tomatoes in another tab... marveling over the hyperbole used to describe the monstrous thing the movie would go on to become as its runtime progressed, I decided I had to keep watching in order to witness it for myself.

""The Nutcracker: The Untold Story"" delivered in a big way.

Where to begin: Nathan Lane's character has gray, poofy hair, is named Uncle ALBERT and has a song called ""It's All RELATIVE."" I'm sorry, I forgot the part of the Nutcracker where freaking Einstein was a character. Let's see... there's the steampunk Rat army, the ridiculously blatant Holocaust imagery (you know, for kids!), the Tim Rice lyrics superimposed on Tchaikovsky's legendary music (Dance of the Reeds played Dixieland style, for example. Not joking.), and my personal favorite element, the Rat Queen.

You could see her in this movie as what the character Denny was to Wiseau's ""The Room."" Why is she here? What purpose does she serve? Do literally any of her character traits makes sense or further the plot? Why is she an alcoholic in the 'real world' if it's only mentioned once and there are no ramifications? Why does she randomly call the Snow Queen a 'bore' in a horribly digitally-altered line reading that clearly looks as if the script to this Children's Holiday Movie originally called for her to say, ""The Snow Queen! That whore!""? Seriously, watch the scene. Just..... WHAT. I liked to think the actress was so bored with her role in this terrible film that she just started improvising and they had to alter it later.

Needless to say, I went right to Amazon and ordered a legitimate copy of the DVD post-haste. It's so hysterically, rubberneck-inducing-ly misguided that you can't not want to add it to your inventory of true holiday classics. A featurette only serves to put a microscope on how tragic it is that hundreds of people were employed for years to work hard and create this film, a 90,000,000 dollar feature that somehow, miraculously, made it to release.",1323129600,10,2355,4.8922305764411025
4713317,1,B005JX89WE,"The movie started out magic and beautiful as one should rightly expect. I loved Nathan Lane's character.  The the Rat scenes were so horrible and scary, my almost 10 and almost 12 yr olds begged me to turn it off and then had nightmares. Most of the scenes were depressing. It is a wee bit redeeming in the end, but the horror of it all negates any value to this film.

Not a film for children and yet not sure why any adult would bother. Don't waste ant precious resources ( time nor $) on this film.",1322956800,14,501,4.154639175257732
4713318,1,B005JX89WE,"Parents, please be advised that this is NO movie for children!  The first 30 minutes of this movie are magical; what one would expect for ""The Nutcracker"".  However, the movie takes a cruel political stance with the introduction of the Rat King character.  Clearly as adults we understand that this character was modeled to be ""Hitler"" and the rat army was none other than the SS.  The Rat King actually quotes Hitler by saying ""our reign will last for 1000 years"" a direct quote by Nazis.  I find this grotesque, disgusting and completely uncalled for. When a criminal was brought to be judged by the Rat King he was sentenced to ""labor"" in a smoke camp AKA ""concentration camp""!!  This movie should have been called ""The Untold Story of White Supremacy"" and only belongs in the movie collection of racist, white supremacists.  Please, do not tell me to lighten up; it's just a movie.  Tell that to the 6+ million human beings slaughtered in the Holocaust!!  By the way, I'm not Jewish.....I'm just an educated human being that finds this movie DISGUSTING!!",1322265600,12,1058,4.769230769230769

The younger kids don't really get into the ""play"" version so this one is actually a movie. A great version of the nutcracker. Has all the music. Kids love it.

8476083,1,B005JX89WE,"I wish I had taken the time to read the reviews before I bought this movie.  There is an excellent detailed 2 star review posted here titled Descends into Creepiness by Janet Boyer.  I agree with it 500%, and can only give the movie 1 star. I would give it less, if possible.  I also agree that the cover misrepresents the movie.  I was expecting a children's story, but I do not believe this movie is fit for children.  Some have said that it is not for small children.  Another said that depends on how ""bland""  your children are.  I believe it depends on how old your children are and how sensitive they are towards scary stories and violence.  I got it for my grandchildren who are 8 and 4, both with sensitive spirits.  I will not be showing it to them. This movie may be no worse than any program on network TV, but not every child is allowed, nor desires to watch everything on network TV these days.  In my opinion, this movie is more frightening than any of the Harry Potter movies, and not as interesting or well done.  Several scenes have been described in other posts here, but the one that finally made me throw it in the trash, almost halfway through, was when the mouse king ripped a little boys head off and ordered his rat soldiers to throw the others into the furnace to burn.  I can just imagine that my grand-kids would be horrified at that point, if not sooner.  Granted, these children were supposed to be dolls, but in the movie they had turned into a real live children.  So think about your own kids and their level of comfort watching scary programs on that scale before you buy this one -or buy it and watch it first to judge for yourself whether it is suitable.  I wish I had read the reviews first.  That is my mistake.",1513382400,4,1748,4.3128834355828225
8476084,5,B005JX89WE,I absolutely loved this movie I first saw it on Netflix and then I told my husband I really wanted the movie I've had the movie for like I guess 3 years now and I'm just now doing a review but I absolutely love it I guess I never came out with us soundtrack but I wish they had because I would so buy it but if you have not yet seen this movie please check it out it's a new Twist on The Nutcracker I read some other reviews saying that there was not Nutcracker music in the movie there most certainly is if you listen to the characters sing they are singing to the tune of some of the Nutcracker music and Ellie Fanning in this movie is brilliant this is what got me to like her a lot like I like her sister and you can't please take out the movie I give this movie five stars because it's totally awesome,1510358400,2,806,3.9207317073170733

The film is not a childten's film for sure. It terrified the youngest, and it was empty...had nothing for the rest of us as well. Looking it up on Rotten Tomatoes, I saw, at that time at least, it had a 0% approval rating. Don't waste precious time out of your life. There must be other movies you've wanted to see!",1510272000,,480,4.063157894736842
