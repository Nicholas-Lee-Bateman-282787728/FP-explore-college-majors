6297105,4,B00ITSHHN8,"I ordered this DVD hoping I would get the ""Invaders from Mars 1953 version"" but didn't so ordered yet another movie! Now have some Sixty dollars invested. Ordered a VHS movie but the last 20-30 minutes was so scratchy it was a loss of money. I'm sure a lot of movies are not checked before they are sent out. I have 8,yes 8 VHS machines and 5 DVD machines and they can not all be bad. I do know how to clean tape heads. Oh,well that's life.....",1380412800,3,444,4.114942528735632

Aliens arrived in 1950s and main characters are having a hard time combating them since the aliens and the government have a joint agreement. I do wish Invaders from Mars was the original, but this 1980s offering is good, too.",1485561600,3,339,4.745762711864407

6297140,5,B00ITSHHN8,"Personally I bought this for one film and that was Invisible Invaders. It was a B film that fought hard to get the B, but because I was about 8 years old when I saw it and it was in the mid 60's, films were hardly as gory as they are now. This one scared snot out of me for that time and even today with the recollection of those days it is still unsettling.",1428278400,10,358,3.7866666666666666
6297141,5,B00ITSHHN8,"This collection gets five stars for Strange Invaders alone. This was a staple on Cinemax back in the 1980s. Seems like every time I played hooky from school, this movie was on. Yes, it's cheesy, b-grade science fiction. In my world, that's a five-star description. The Tobe Hooper remake of Invaders from Mars is fun. The other two flicks are older, but just as much fun. The price is right, if you're not addicted to the polished turds hollywood's producing these days, you'll dig it. If you remember seeing these on cable tv back in the day, you'll love it.",1427846400,8,559,4.6

6297144,5,B00ITSHHN8,"I bought this set mainly for Tobe Hooper's version of 'Invaders From Mars'. Liked the original too, but this highly campy version is very good. All movies had good picture quality. Had never seen 'Invisible Invaders'. Must have missed that one growing up. The best part of 'Strange Invaders' is the beautiful Nancy Allen.",1426377600,,321,4.962962962962963

6297157,3,B00ITSHHN8,"These movies aren't bad, but they aren't the best of the classic scifi bunch.

The big surprise for me was Strange Invaders from the 1980s. It's a slow starter, but a very good plot.

The rest are OK. Be warned that the Journey to the Seventh Planet's audio does not sync with the picture. It's storyline as been done on so many other scifi shows - including Star Trek. I'm just not sure if this was one of the first or not.

Overall, it's not a bad buy for $5, but if you want scifi you can't stop watching, Grab Destination Moon, Quatermass, Colossus - The Forbin Project, or Demon Seed (with Julie Christie).",1416182400,10,611,4.342105263157895

I enjoyed the 2 old ones, loving old Sci-Fi movies no matter how crass. They're fun watching.
Invaders from Mars is a remake and goes for thrills whereas the original was based squarely around the ""Cold War"" thinking.
