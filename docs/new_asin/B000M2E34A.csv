The set I received via Amazon was slightly bent and scratched across the front surface. One of the four DVD's was noticeably discolored (darker than the other three). Didn't bother me much, but for some it may.

The menus are very very basic. ""Play"" or ""Pick a Quarter 1-2-3-4"" for each of the discs. No special features, nothing but the game.

The video quality is as expected of a basketball game from 1995-2000. Noticeably sub-standard quality on my HD-TV, but again, expected.

The biggest gripe I have about the set is the somewhat misleading description that the games are ""in their entirety and original broadcast form."" The game itself isn't edited, and it is in its original broadcast form, but the pre-game shows, post-game commentary, in-between commercial talks, and halftime reports are obviously missing as the game goes straight from halftime to the start of the third without skipping a beat.

The games themselves are fun to watch, especially the 1994 game with Reggie exploding in the 4th while mouthing off to Spike Lee. However, they could have been a lot more entertaining with additional footage, commentary, etc. The fourth game in this set (2000 ECF Game 6 vs Knicks) will only be entertaining for big Pacers fans who want to relive the joy of finally winning the Conference title.

I really wish the NBA would have done something special for either Reggie Miller or the entire 90's Pacers team with a highlight set or something of the sort, instead of putting out this plain set with games Pacers fans own or see repeatedly on ESPN Classic.

Overall, I would recommend this set to the average NBA fan who wants to relive these historic Reggie vs. Knicks/Bulls games, or the Pacers fan who doesn't have these games recorded on VHS. However, for the Pacers fans who have these on VHS, all you're getting is the luxury of having them on DVD without having to do the transfer yourself - yet lacking all the fun commentary and special reports of the original broadcast. For $22, it's a good deal. However, I'd be willing to pay much more for a product that was actually put together with some effort.",1173916800,18,2177,4.743386243386244

Ofcourse you want to have more games but those were not in there so lives go on and i have those 4 great games and it is worth it :)",1338076800,,367,3.7051282051282053
8165894,5,B000M2E34A,"This video was everything I've been looking for. I became a Pacers fan during the 1994 Playoffs and have not looked back. The games chosen in this set are truly the best.  I believe the best way to relive sporting moments are from full telecasts, not simply highlights, and these discs have it all. Don't expect digital quality sound picture since these games were not broadcast in that format, but it is as it was (as they say). If you are a true Pacers fan, buy this!",1288915200,,469,4.390804597701149

8165896,3,B000M2E34A,I have no idea why they would have been so stingy with this package only including 4 games and even going to the trouble of putting them on 4 separate discs.  It seems they could have had 8 for the same production cost.  It would be great to see some of the other buzzer beater type playoff games the pacers managed to win and there were quite a few.  I agree that including the halftime show among other things would be nice.  The fourth game here is worth watching for any Reggie fan as he scored 17 in the fourth to will his team to the finals.  It's funny looking back how the announcers often were hesitant to give credit to Reg for making all those tough shots (they did tend to notice the buzzer beaters).  I understand that hoisting the shots is only a part of what is going on out there but at times particularly in the fourth quarter everything the Pacers were doing as a team offensively and defensively was to give Miller the chance to keep them in the game with his marksmanship and it's really amazing that he was able to deliver as often as he did.  I don't know of another team built around a shooter (sorry Rik) making it consistently to the conference finals.  Hats off to the nineties pacers.,1211068800,,1211,4.3039647577092515
