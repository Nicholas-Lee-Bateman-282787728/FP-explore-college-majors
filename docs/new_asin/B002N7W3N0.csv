3958469,5,B002N7W3N0,"This is a wonderful set of videos from John. Even though these are on you tube, the quality is much better. They did something to improve the quality. I like how it gives you a good span of his career. You get the height of his career in 1977 and some footage from 1991. I wouldn't have minded seeing something later than 1991, but, there is enough that you can hear his voice mature and sound even better.

I am not going to review every song, but, you can see how he put his heart into each performance and really was able to connect to audience.

I also found the documentaries very interesting. I love the one in Canada, I had never seen that before and didn't realize what the volume of great music he had written so early in his career (1972). I found in interesting that he one about earth day and environment, while you can see it's quite dated, the basic information that it presents is really still applicable today. It could be shown today and be just as meaningful. And, as cute as John is( and I don't just mean his physical characteristics), he can convince anyone to support him in his causes.and,I don;t mean that in an empty way, his heart is really into what he supports.

I only have one small complaint. I understand there are legal reasons for this difference that were beyond anyone's control. The UK version has the bonus tracks and the US version does not. I might just have to buy both. Or, I think in UK you an just buy the Japan 1981 show, I may just do that. And the UK versions are all regions so you need not have a PAL dvd player. But, anyone who loves John will want this. And, if this does well, maybe the next set of releases will be his TV specials which are quite funny:)",1256083200,8,1707,4.262345679012346
3958470,5,B002N7W3N0,"This is a must for all John Denver fans and of course to anyone else that just liked his music. To be able to see these shows live after all these years is truly wonderful. They are all put together with new technology and the pictures are clear and it's like being at the concerts once again. To be able not only to see John but to see the band members for different stages of their lives is great. With the likes of James Burton, Jim Horn, Denny Brooks and many others is a real treat also. You are going to love this package, it will bring back so many memories and you will feel just like you are right there at the concerts. You won't be sorry that you bought this box set, you will watch it over and over as I did.",1255910400,4,720,4.006944444444445
3958471,5,B002N7W3N0,"First of all it was a pleasure not to drive 16 hours (I did that once) to get to a John Denver concert. Just turned on the TV, sat down and enjoyed these concerts. Great seat, lovely music, the sound to me was stupendous and most of all the nice memories of concerts from the past were enjoyed again.  A most enjoyable DVD Set.  Thank you.

3958473,4,B002N7W3N0,"(1) I got this 5-disc DVD package and view most of them, first question I have is for Jeroen (of Netherlands)'s posting, I don't see those bonus tracks, are they available in England or Netherland only?
(2) Live in Australia DVD : DTS sound is good, but with this setup, John's guitar sound is at it's minimum level, video quality is OK only, most are blurry, only the close-up is clear.
(3) Live in Japan: Both video and sound are good, is this reason, Eagle Vision picked this one to release as stand alone DVD?
(4) Live in England : Both video and DTS sound are excellent, the band is fantastic, however, I believe JD must have caught a bad cold before the show, his voice in second half is horrible, otherwise, I like the songs selection as well as John's guitar playing can be heard very clear.
(5) Solo Acoustic in Japan : Both video and DTS sound are excellent, I remember John opened it with Boy From The Country but the DVD starts with Rocky Mountain High, voice and guitar sound are the best among these 5 discs.
(6) Documentary disc is nice to have, the video and sound quality are average.",1255564800,13,1101,4.401960784313726
3958474,5,B002N7W3N0,"Having only watch the first dvd Im writing an early review but a confindent one, The box is beautifully packaged and has a booklet with lots of rare pictures and a essay by Hal Thau which explains his career in a short sweet way, its also has the setlists to all the concerts, the first disc is Australia 1977 and it blew my socks off.

The Picture was so good, remaster picture, looks as if it was recorded with High Definition cameras. The sounds is as clear and the audio is faboulous, the mics picked up everything, the clips on youtube have nothing ont the quality of the dvd, much more enjoyable to expeirence plus all the tidbits of John's Jokes and stories between each song and introduction to his band memebers.

John's performance was beyond extradinary, his vocals were absoulutly flawless thorught the show and Hal Blaine's drumming was just right, big orchestra, backing vocals, keyborads, blue grass insturments for the many blue grass tunes he played, faomus rhoads keyboards! It was a long show like almost 3hours of pure fun with John playing many favorites of mine and all his hits!

The only thing that disapoints me is they had to cut out one song he did on the show and it was a gem that i've seen on youtube.
They cut out John's performance of ""Today"" It wasn't written by John but by one of his band memebers and was first heard on the ""Evening with John Denver"" album, its one of his most moving performances of the concert, I enjoy the whole concert, many of the performances I have never seen and was memorized, I was so happy when he did Love Is Everywhere and Annie's Song, and How Can I Leave you Again/ Singing Skies and dancing waters.

Overall im more then satisfied with what this dvd offers, the documentary Day at the big horn offers insight to how John feels about the natural world and showcases him in the wild, many great qoutes of his wisdom too, a fairly old one from 1972; it will be a treat seeing it in crisp clear audio and video for the clips on youtube were pretty fuzzy and mono. I can't wait to watch the other discs and I'll post some reviews once im finished, for now peace be with you my friends and god bless!",1255478400,10,2321,4.711822660098522

The concerts are all recorded in good quality sound and you will even hear John's voice occasionally slip or crack on the high notes which for some strange reason I am glad they did not edit out. There is of course repeats of his famous songs on all the DVD's but if you are a fan you want to hear them over and over again, just at a different venue. His concert in japan is cool when he brings a youngster up to help him see a song, also like his live version of ""The harder They fall"" when he rarely plays an electric guitar. It's so sad he was taken away to early and there will never be another like him.",1375920000,,672,3.841726618705036

One thing that shows up is how devoted he is and how much he must truly enjoy life and all he has done with it.  On one he sweats so much and it is evident when you see it, that he isn't letting it bother him.  He just wants to sing and he does.  I love the extra's too tho I have watched them on you tube.

Also, it is great to have all of Denver's Farm Aid performances together and to finally have ""Bighorn"" on DVD.  I would love to have had other Denver performances here (for example, his 1982 ""Man and His Music"" BBC concert), but that's a small quibble.

3958548,3,B002N7W3N0,"A must for Denver Fans.. but lots of repeated songs

This box set of five DVDs is about a complete collection of  the ""Rocky Mountain High"" singer's filmed and taped performances as you will find and covers the years from just after his hit ""Thank God I'm a Country Boy"" to his later years performing at Farm Aid. There is certainly a lot of performance time with two of the full concerts - one in Australia (20,000 people in an outside sports stadium); another in England (almost as many there too) - running two hours each, and the other three concerts spanning about 75-minutes. Add to this the Farm Aid performances and a few songs sung during the film ""Day at the Bighorn"" and there's a lot of John singin' and grinnin'. But how many times can you hear ""Take Me Home, Country Roads""? That song, and ""Matthew"" each appear TWICE on just the Farm Aid section and, of course, are in the other concerts. Same for ""Annie's Song"", ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"" and most of his big ""hits"". Sure there are lesser known songs - most of which have not been overexposed - but you have to wade through the ""hits"" (again!) to get to them.

The fifth disc contains the EPA environmental film ""Earth Day 1990"" with basically no music and ""Day At Bighorn"" (in which Denver and a friend visit the Rocky Mountains, alone - well, with a film crew, of course). The quality of the print on this is poor and the sound muffled and distorted.

Though its probably great for the Denver completist, the package is  ""overkill"" and a more carefully edited package would have given this a higher rating from me.

This is the only known live recording on DVD of this song, yet it was omitted. Sound mixing is also poor, the VHS copy I have of this show has a much better sound mix. The other shows in this collection do not hold a candle to the 1977 Australian show, thus I am putting most of the weight from my reveiw into that show.

This set was filled with so much energy and delight from the audiences - and from John! - and was a fitting tribute to the ""Prophet of the 70's"".

What a lovely and delightful walk through the '70's and 80's with John, leaving me with a ""Rocky Mountain High""! It is a must for all John Denver fans!

Unfortunately, I could never live see John, and I'm so happy that I am now several John Denver-concerts can ""experience"" - unfortunately, often with a lump in my throat!!  Even the TV special ""Day of the Bighorn,"" with amazing nature and wildlife photographs, that John with self-written texts (which he could really not??!!) commented in his own way, is great! Even subtitles in several languages - great! This is also for the documentary ""Earth Day"" of 1990 very useful !!  Not everyone can perfect English - as it is easily seen in this (my) text...  Hopefully, this unique set is not really remain the only one! Provides additional material together! Not only concerts, and everyone still so short presentation of John, interviews, etc. are yearning awaited!",1259107200,3,816,5.029629629629629

""audio"" and ""video"" are in very good quality.
It's amazing!
Every Denver fan should have this DVD box and even those who like him and who are not really fans now, maybe they will become real fans while watching anf hearing these DVD's!
I'd like to tell everybody that we'ld like more new Denver stuff like this, we allways want more!",1259107200,3,466,4.430232558139535

No one is really remembering him hardly at all and it's very sad!!!!! This man was a genius and this DVD reflects that 100%.  We need more of his DVD's like some of his documentaries on nature he did over the 70's, 80', & 90's..........Peace",1257897600,3,400,4.527777777777778
3958556,2,B002N7W3N0,"John Denver - Around the World Live

On October 13th Eagle Records released what is being heralded as the definitive John Denver DVD Release. ""Definitive"" is one way to describe it.  ""Eclectic"" is another, and ""excessive"" is also an option.

Consisting of four live concerts: ""Thank God I'm a Country Boy"" Live in Australia 1977, ""Rocky Mountain High"" Live in Japan 1981, ""Country Roads"" Live in England 1986, ""Solo Acoustic Show"" Live in Japan 1984, his ""Farm Aid Performances"" 1985, 1987, 1990, and two documentaries ""Earth Day"" 1990, and ""Day at Bighorn"" 1972, the collection has 592 minutes of material on 5 discs.

The collection is definitive in that it spans more than ten years of live performances, it is eclectic in that it includes such things as the Earth Day documentary, which may have been one of Mr. Denvers passions, and is briefly hosted by him, but it really has little to do with him, and the material is outdated, and the collection is excessive in it's repetitiveness.  The collection includes no less than six performances of ""Take me Home Country Roads"", and numerous performances of other Denver Classics.

Though it is interesting to watch how the technology to film a concert advanced over the years, eventually the footage becomes more enjoyable to listen to, rather than to sit and watch an incredibly talented man, stand in front of a microphone and strum his guitar.  The concert from Australia in 1977 is awkward from the opening where it fails to properly capture Denvers introduction, and remains awkwardly filmed throughout. As technology improved over the years, so does the footage of the concerts.

The documentary ""Day at the Bighorn"" lends the most insight into Denver, his personality, and his passion for animals and the great outdoors, but it is clumsily edited, and generally results in poor story telling.

The gem in this release is the acoustic performance in Japan from 1984, as it truly displays the immense talent and vocal range of Denver.

The sound quality of all segments is excellent, and most of the footage looks great if you are so inclined to watch all of it.

Recommendation:  This collection seems thrown together, as the Earth Day documentary seems out of place. A documentary on John Denvers Life would have made for the perfect conclusion to the story that was attempted to be told here.  Even the addition of the made for television movie ""Take Me Home: The John Denver Story"" from 2000 with Chad Lowe as Denver, would have made for a more well rounded release.  The true fan may enjoy sitting and watching all of this, but most will simply enjoy listening to some of it.",1257724800,28,2636,4.841870824053452
3958587,5,B002N7W3N0,"John Denver was at his best when singing to an audience - I always felt that his studio albums didn't do him justice.  So, this DVD set reveals the full extent of his talent!  Most of his well-known songs are here, as well as some lesser-known gems that deserve this opportunity to be enjoyed by a wider audience.  There is even an unlisted surprise - John's wonderful rendition of `The Lord's Prayer' in American Indian sign-language is included in the 1984 solo concert from Lake Biwa.  This goes some way to compensate for the omission of `Boy from the Country' from this concert.

The two documentaries on the final disc show something of John's concerns for the natural world and the environment.  The 1990 Earth Day documentary reminded me a little of Al Gore's excellent film `An Inconvenient Truth', though of course it pre-dated that film by 16 years!  `Day at the Bighorn' was, I believe, the first of John's documentaries about the natural world; it would be great to follow this with `Rocky Mountain Reunion' or `Alaska: America's Child' on the next boxed set.

Heartfelt thanks are due to Barry Ehrmann, producer of this set, and his colleagues who helped to bring us this treasure.  I look forward many more DVD releases from the John Denver archives!",1257638400,6,1265,4.76605504587156
3958588,3,B002N7W3N0,"The sound quality was very inconsistent - some clips were very poor & others were just ok.  This is absolutely not a DVD John would've ok'd for production.  I can almost feel him cringing as his fans are watching it.  I really LOVED to see John again but my heart bled while watching it, knowing that John would've been so embarassed at the poor quality of the sound & visuals.  There were some clips from the 80's where John had on stage make-up (NOT meant to be seen by close-up cameras) that really is shameful - John would've been so upset that we are seeing this.  On the plus side - I've not seen the ""Bighorn Sheep"" TV special since the 1970's - so this was the jewel, the treasure of the DVD.  I would buy it again, just for this, as the visuals and sound are right on the money for this one DVD.  The rest is really not what John would approve of.  Sadly he is not here with us anymore, which is exacly how and why this DVD got produced - John was not here to nix this project.",1257552000,6,986,4.098958333333333
3958589,5,B002N7W3N0,"In the twelve years since his death I had forgotten how much joy was shared in the live performances.  The experience was a complete sensory feast, sights, sounds, emotions, energy etc.  It is really fun to be able to see him have such a good time singing to thousands and thousands of friends.  This is an unexpected treat for the diehard fan, but I hope it proves to be an opportunity for new generations to make the acquaintance of an artist who connected one on one with his audience and sang of love and hope instead of anger, angst and violence.  It is a fantastic effort by Hal Thau and much appreciated.  It is brilliant.",1257465600,4,629,4.434782608695652

3958591,5,B002N7W3N0,We have all heard his music. This gives us the chance to see him on stage at his best. You can see the comfort and joy that he feels there. A must have for all John Denver fans. Worth every penny.,1256947200,,196,3.8048780487804876
3958592,5,B002N7W3N0,"Since I first heard about this 5 DVD Set, I was very excited to see the final result.
I have to say - I was not disappointed at all!!
Here you can find a cross-section of John Denver's work - music, music, music, but also one of his television specials (Day of The Bighorn) and an environmental documentation for Earth Day 1990, surprisingly up to date with its concerns.
The video quality may not be HDTV, but who would expect that, taking into consideration that some of the material is more than 30 years old. What ever could be done to enhance it was done, and especially the sound quality is really, really great.
If you like John Denver and/or would like to get to know him (better), just don't hesitate to buy this.
It is not only fun watching him here, it even gets you into the mood for more!",1256515200,,801,4.311258278145695

The quality was surprisingly wonderful. If the world lived by John Denvers words and music, this would be a great place. Keep up the good work, I will buy EVERYTHING",1256342400,7,380,4.277777777777778
3958594,5,B002N7W3N0,"I have been a hard core John Denver fan for most of my life. So I was thrilled to receive this 5 DVD box set and felt it was long overdue. Although the Wild Life concert was also an excellent staging of John Denver's music the concerts presented in this box set gives the viewer a more complete look at the pure artistry and talent John Denver delivered while performing live. In today's over produced concerts with elaborate dancers and stage productions the simplicity and brilliance of a John Denver concert shines through on each disk. It is a rare performer who can hold an audience in the palm of his hand while mesmerizing, thrilling and touching them with just his songs, his personality and a small backing band.

The quality of the DVDs are spectacular. Eagle Rock did a great job restoring the footage to pristine quality making you feel you have a front row seat to your own JD concert which you can enjoy any time you want to. The song selections cover his greatest hits while sampling a wide variety of his lesser known but high quality material. But what soars above it all is his voice which was clear as a mountain stream and as powerful as a thunderstorm in spring.

A bonus on disk 5 are two documentaries. The first one is a 1990 Earth Day related documentary speaking of the environmental movement and its importance to us all. It stars John and is educational, quite interesting but never preachy. The second documentary is his 1972 Bighorn documentary. This is classic John Denver in his element, out in the rocky mountains learning about the Bighorn sheep and all the other animals that live there. This documentary is peppered with Johns music throughout including the tongue in cheek tune ""How to say hello to a Grizzly Bear."" Many fans have been waiting for this gem to be released on DVD and this will not disappoint.

If you're a fan of John Denver then this is an absolute must have for your collection. Hopefully in time to come there will be concerts and more TV shows to be released.",1256169600,34,2016,4.56353591160221

Thank you to all the people that worked hard on getting these concerts together for all JD fans!!!",1256169600,4,367,3.8666666666666667

8374825,5,B002N7W3N0,"I still miss going to his concerts.  I probably didn't break the record, but I went to a tremendous amount of them.  It didn't matter to me what songs he sang, because no matter what he did, it was amazing.  This is a great compilation of live performances from around the world.  Absolutely a wonderful set of songs that just NEVER get old.  These performances are actual concert footage, which demonstrates easily why John was such an incredible performer.  Some reviews commented on the audio quality, but with maybe a hitch or two, it's not an issue.  I read that the restoration team, led by Barry Ehrmann, really did an amazing job with videos that ranged from 15 to 35 years old.  So great to see John's Farm Aid performances, and ""Bighorn"" too!!  For any Denver-die hard fans, this is a must buy - maybe the next one will have other concerts that we know are out there and missing - but overall, this is ""Almost Heaven"" compilation that I'm thrilled was put together.  Kudos to Eagle Rock Entertaniment for making this box set available.",1520294400,,1045,4.6

8374828,5,B002N7W3N0,"The 1977 performance (Disc 1) in Australia was really cool!!  The only part that I didn't like was when the camera kept showing the same 2 idiot girls in the crowd.  I bought the DVD to see John & his band--not  the audience! .  On the Farm Aid performance in 1987 JD sang  ""What Are We Making Weapons For"" as a duet with a Russian singer who did not appear in person, but his voice had been pre-recorded. Of course John sang live & it was a very strong vocal performance for both men. John looked upset (angry) when he was singing--maybe it was the subject matter that he felt very emotional about. On Disc 5 is the documentary John made with Tommy Tomkins, ""Day at the Bighorn"" about Bighorn Sheep in the Canadian Rockies. John is wearing that iconic leather hat  hiking in Winter on snowshoes & by horseback.---so enjoyable to see him in this setting!  The film quality and sound on this disc aren't the best, but it was probably filmed in the early to mid-70's so the technology just wasn't there, but it's still great to watch.  If you like/love John Denver, I think you will enjoy all 5 discs!",1486080000,,1099,4.379310344827586

I don't know why but just looking at descriptions I thought it might not be the greatest quality but I was so wrong. This has DD 5.1 / DTS sound which is really nice. Of course the concerts were originally off various TV feeds I believe but this is John Denver with all his hits and beyond. I love the '77 Aussie concert since I like that 70's style. The DOC is from '74 showing Denver in nature with a friend. Never heard of that so it's a real treat. Also a DOC about Earth Day 1990. Plus all his Farm Aid appearances. With so many concerts on this 5 disc set, you're bound to find your favorites hits and even some rarities. I highly suggest buying this, you just can't go wrong.",1463443200,3,752,4.087837837837838
