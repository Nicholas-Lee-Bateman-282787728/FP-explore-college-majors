203214,5,1933328894,"This program works great. Quadrupled my reading speed and more than doubled my comprehension. I have family member who didn't finish the program (laziness) and they still doubled their reading speed.

If you're a slow reader, reading makes you tired, or just has a heavy work load this program works very well.",1239148800,11,310,4.961538461538462
203215,2,1933328894,"I read slowly, and because I have stacks of books that I intended to read ""someday"" I decided to look into speed reading. I did some research to try and figure out what would be best, and chose the Evelyn Wood program because of my familiarity with the name.

First off let me say that I purchased the VHS tapes, not the DVD. I am writing this review under the DVD section because that's where I think it will be of most use to people. I did some research before purchasing and discovered the VHS tapes contain the same content as the DVD but can be had for much less. The VHS tapes I received did not come with a workbook, but you can purchase that from the Fred Pryor website for a few bucks which I did.

The video consists of a classroom lecture broken into three parts. Part one (about 45 minutes) advises using your hand as a guide while reading. Part two (about 55 minutes) is about scanning a document before reading it to improve memory and comprehension. Part three (about 25 minutes) is review and advises you to keep practicing. That's basically all there is to it; the instructor gives examples and exercises but there are no ""secrets"" or breakthrough techniques, and some of the concepts that intrigued me (like eliminating ""subvocalization"") are glossed over so quickly that I wondered why they bothered presenting them in the first place.

I did some research on the history of Evelyn Wood and learned that the original courses were 21 hours of classroom instruction over a period of three weeks. This video is about 2 hours. So what you have is basically an introduction to speed reading--not a full course. Although the information is good (just using my hand as a guild while reading helped increase my speed instantly), in my opinion the price they are asking for the DVD is unreasonable for what you are getting.",1233792000,56,1833,4.5823170731707314
203216,5,1933328894,"This 3 Video set is intended to be used with a workbook! You can still learn from the videos, but without the workbook you will not receive the full benefit of the program. You can sometimes find a workbook available on ebay. If you are unsure what a Marketplace seller is offering, email first to verify.

The video sub-titles are:
""Approaching Dynamic Reading and Developing Speed""
""Refining Comprehension and Reading Effectiveness""
""Putting it all Together""

Videos are narrated by Patricia Hutchings and produced by Dave Kuenstle/Nightingale Conant.",1116720000,33,553,5.344827586206897

203218,3,1933328894,"The video is fairly old and doesn't have great production quality. It seems there's a workbook that goes with this program, which is NOT included. The ideas seem good, but I'm not sure I'd buy it again.",1413244800,3,202,4.486486486486487

203223,3,1933328894,"The video must've been made it the 80s, so its a bit old-skool.  Even so, it works.  You have to keep practicing, but after I watched the video once, I found myself finishing my books WAAAAAAAY quicker.",1360281600,4,202,4.4324324324324325
203224,5,1933328894,This program is perfect for a busy person in that you don't have to attend lots of classes of wait weeks before seeing results. In a matter of 3+ hours you will see significant increases in your reading seed and comprehension.  I have surveyed over 200 people who have experienced this exact program and all have experienced results. It also helps in processing those hundreds of emails we are faced with each week. Pat Bean first helps you figure out your reading speed and comprehension and than you learn the specific techniques to read faster while still understanding what you read and remembering it! For me I went from 220 words per minute with about 40% comprehension to 890 words per minute with 85% comprehension in 3 hours and I have only increased from there.,1336262400,11,771,4.711111111111111
203225,2,1933328894,"I think some other reviewers said it, but I'll just repeat it.  Use a pacer while reading (i.e. move you finger or a pencil across the page to lead your eye along).  That's pretty much what the video says.  If I had paid full price for the DVD version for this info, I would be writing a much worse review for being ripped off.  Since I bought the old VHS copy for under $10, I'm not going to complain too much.  This is definitely not worth the full price.  BTW, there really aren't any on screen examples or cool demos, illustrations, or anything.  Just one of the company's trainers (not Evelyn herself, if she exists) giving a training seminar.  In other words, its a video of a lecture that occasionally.  I heard about this at a Fred Pryor training that my old job sent me to, which in and of itself was largely a sales pitch for the companies others products and training presentations.  They try to tell ou that this program has been used by the rich and powerful and was a key to their success.  My guess is that presidents and world leaders may have seen this video or attended a live presentation of this reading seminar, but unless they got more than what was presented in this video I highly doubt it was a key to anything.  Most of this information could be obtained in a 15 minute conversation with a reading teaching at any elementary school or middle school in the country.",1326499200,5,1390,4.38671875
