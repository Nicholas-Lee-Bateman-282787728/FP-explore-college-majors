6308827,5,B00J1Z3ZGG,"This is a great example of what I like about low budget independent films.  Filmmakers who are passionate about their craft can do so much more with their limited resources than Hollywood studios can do with millions, and they aren't restricted to formulaic stories and tacked-on happy endings.  It was a pleasure to watch this story unfold, taking enough time to build suspense but never going so slow as to lose my interest.  If you're a fan of the genre, you'll have absolutely no regrets adding this little gem to your collection.",1404172800,2,534,4.782608695652174

6308831,5,B00J1Z3ZGG,"Great suspense in a genre that very often doesn't have a plot.  It kept me intrigued and ""in the dark"" right up until the very last scene.  Highly recommend for a scary rainy night.",1401667200,2,181,4.294117647058823

6308833,5,B00J1Z3ZGG,A great thriller using amazing practical effects instead of the CGI so often seen in films. Great story and great acting too! Highly recommended.,1397606400,4,145,5.083333333333333
6308834,3,B00J1Z3ZGG,"It's not terrible, but it's not totally amazing either. I'd say it's watchable.

The main problem is that there's a long sequence of exposition in which literally all the details / clues for the rest of the movie are given to you all in one go. From there on out, it's pretty predictable. But I kept hoping to be proved wrong, so I kept watching.

And one of the strange ""mysteries"" was given away waaaay too early.

Pacing gets a little slow. Acting is okay. At least everyone knows how to do ""creepy"" well.

The song at the beginning might be the most horrible part of the whole film, though. Yikes.",1409011200,,601,4.387387387387387
6308835,5,B00J1Z3ZGG,"Andrew (Brian Sutherland) wins a radio contest to spend one night alone in an old theater. At the end of his all-night stay in the theater will be a prize of $50,000. The theater is famous for a bloody murder/suicide that took place there 80 years earlier. Andrew couldn't be more happy about this opportunity, but his wife Mira (Lisa Coronado) has been having psychic premonitions about the theater and does not feel good about her husband being alone in the theater. But Andrew has no worries. Once Andrew has entered the theater to begin his all night stay inside, it's not long before the ghosts and secrets of the theater begin to appear. Will Andrew make it through the night?

The set-up for this film may be a traditional ghost story set-up, but the old school horror approach makes it feel fresh, especially in this day and age of the horror genre. The old horror approach is what the genre was made from and this film does a wonderful job as reminding us of that.

The film was written with the existing theater location in mind and it is put to incredible use here. It is quite the interesting and beautiful location.

Jeff Ferrell, making his feature directorial debut with this film, wore a lot of hats here on this film, serving as director, writer, producer, editor and a supporting actor. And he did a top notch job with all of them. He clearly got to show his love for the genre and for cinema here and shows some real skill with framing of shots, how scenes are played out, and also working in not only some very effective suspense moments, but also some very effective twists and turns throughout.

His direction here, combined with a terrific cast results in some truly excellent performances, the kind that are not often seen in horror films. The entire cast created characters that are both right for this type of film and can be characters that someone can relate to.

The cinematography by Domenic Barbero is excellent, making this film truly feel like a different horror moviegoing experience, with the use of different colors, shadows, and even black-and-white. It at times feels like the world of a horror film from the 30s or 40s being told in the 21st century.

Overall, the film is a solid little chiller that may appeal to you if you are a fan of the old school horror films. I am, so I definitely reccomend this! Bravo to all involved in making it!",1408406400,,2380,4.575117370892019
6308836,1,B00J1Z3ZGG,Very lame. Stay away from this trash,1408406400,,36,4.285714285714286
6308837,2,B00J1Z3ZGG,"I wanted to like it....I really did.  Inconsistent pacing, dialogue, and acting detracted from what could have been a good film.  I also found it rather predictable -- not completely but I was very close.  This tried to be a high-brow thriller rather than a cheap-scare fest but it didn't succeed.  The corny ending didn't help either.
Don't waste your time or money on this one; there are others that are much better.",1408233600,,418,4.684931506849315

6308842,4,B00J1Z3ZGG,"If you're looking for splatter-fest 2014, keep looking, you definitely won't find gore, or T&A here.  However, if you're looking for a slow build up creepy ghost story with some classic ghost story elements, some good voice work, good acting chops from some of the main cast, and some great black and white throwback moments, then give this one a shot.  It's a pretty good rental, and it didn't leave me wanting to shove needles into my eyeballs after watching it.",1406160000,6,464,4.716049382716049
6308843,5,B00J1Z3ZGG,"Spending the night in a haunted theater, haunted house, haunted amusement park, haunted laundromat (OK maybe not that one) is not a new concept.

The trick is to grab your interest and hold it, so while the route may feel familiar, you still want to go along for the ride  In that, Jeff Ferrell's first full-length film, ""Ghostlight,"" succeeds.

The start of Ghostlight introduces us to the couple Mira and Andrew, who unevenly carry the weight of a yet-to-be-named tragedy.  Mira is appears to be drowning, while Andrew's attempts to cheer her up seem earnest yet futile at best.  When Andrew gets the opportunity to spend the night in a haunted theater for the chance to win fifty grand, it appears that fate has finally smiled upon them... or has it?

Ghostlight brings us along on Andrew's journey from fresh faced contestant to being at risk of becoming the latest entry on the cursed spirits menu.  We get to meet the slightly bizarre theater manager, Mr. Black, the master of the wrong affect, who describes grisly dispatchings with what appears to be unabashed enthusiasm.  We're treated to Mira's unnerving and ghastly premonitions. And without giving away any details, Ghostlight will make you think twice of spending quality time around mannequins.

In Ghostlight Ferrell displays an impressive array of talents - not only scripting/directing/editing - but by putting in a convincing turn as one of the ghosts.  Ghostlight shows that a good supernatural tale doesn't require a splatterfest or a large body-count of disposable characters to deliver it's dose of creepiness.",1406160000,2,1583,5.053846153846154

6308847,1,B00J1Z3ZGG,"Another awful movie with questionable 5 star reviews, given by people who have posted no other reviews.  I get the trick, and it works.  The filmmakers post phony 5 star reviews to get people to watch.  If you don't research and just go by the stars, you get suckered into watching the film.  I am lazy by nature so I'm the kind of people who falls for this, until now.  This film was so bad I could feel it killing my brain cells as I watched it.  Terrible acting, although, one guy was so bad he was actually kind of entertaining to watch.  However, not nearly entertaining enough to justify the rest of the film.  The story was threadbare, the actors second rate, the dialog predictable and the scary parts were poorly done.  This movie has one positive for me, it has taught me to quit going by the ratings alone and actually look at the reviews.",1405900800,21,850,4.3630573248407645

Please please please give me some Top 100 Reviewer review so I can tell if it is worth my time (and $$$$).

FIVE STAR REVIEWERS:  I'll change this rating just as soon as I can.  If it rocks, I'll have no trouble saying so - I just didn't want other viewers to see the 8+ Five Star ratings and think they had missed the next Exorcist or the like!",1404864000,5,540,3.8727272727272726
6308851,5,B00J1Z3ZGG,"Ghostlight is an excellent horror film paying homage to the classics that knew how to scare you not with fancy CGI visuals but with psychological thrills that stick with you long after the film ends.

With excellent writing, acting, directing, sound and cinematography, Ghostlight grabbed my attention from the opening scene, and kept me guessing clear up until the surprising finale!

It's refreshing to see a horror film that affects it's audience not with what we are shown, but with what we are forced to think about. Ghostlight proves that a massive budget and expensive visual effects are no match for good old fashioned writing and film making!",1404777600,2,651,5.018518518518518
6308852,5,B00J1Z3ZGG,"Ghostlight is the kind of movie where you think you know how it ends, but clearly you have no idea.  The director always kept us looking around the corner, but not knowing what you'll find. That is what kept me on the edge of my seat.  I hate watching a thriller or scary movie and knowing after the first half hour who the killer is, or how it's going to end. Mr Ferrell got a tremendous performance from his actors, some of them actually convincing me that they were twisted...for real.

The surprise for me was how it ended...and no..I won't tell you.  You will just have to buy the movie and see for yourself.  For a first time director and screen writer he did a wonderful job taking us into the lives of these characters and I am looking forward to Mr Ferrell's next project.  Hope I don't have to wait long :)",1404432000,,816,4.266233766233766

8647300,4,B00J1Z3ZGG,"The story of Ghostlight is your traditional, ghost story set-up, with a contest winner getting the opportunity to win some money, by staying in a haunted location. In this film that place is a haunted theatre, where the performance with bloody murder. This is a mature, somber thriller with a slow build to a terrifying and some what depressing ending. The arc is a proper string of suspense, with constant melodramatic, emotional connectivity, although the first half of the film is a bit of a sleeper with minimal thrills. Normally this would have me checked out permanently, however the strong story, decent acting and hints to a nice, tense ending held me to the film right until the bitter end.

The special effects in Ghostlight is a standard foray of gimmicks that one would expect in a paranormal thriller such as this. Most of the moments pay-off with some real suspense and creepy scenes taking place (most of which take place in the last half of the film). Now even though there isn't much new brought to the table with chilling effects in this one, Ghostlight manages to execute, a decent, steady ghost story that creates a haunting atmosphere with a nice finish. The sound effects and soundtrack does help build some suspense but it didn't really stand out as anything manager for me personally.

Overall Ghostlight is a well thought out little chiller. The first 45 minutes are bit slow and demand dedication when watching the film, but stick with it, the end is the big seller. The story is a mature tale that is worth a once over by paranormal fans. It is a classic tribute to both the theatrical and the ghost story that takes the genre serious. I enjoyed this film, it could have been a bit scarier, and the ending is a little more depressing than thrilling but still, it is a cool one that plays out nicely.",1431129600,,1826,4.65015479876161
