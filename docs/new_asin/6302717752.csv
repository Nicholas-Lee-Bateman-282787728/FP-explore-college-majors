497547,4,6302717752,"It's almost impossible to think that this 1949 film was made by the same studio, MGM, that earlier in the decade had still been depicting small-town life in Andy Hardy terms. The studio asked Clarence Brown to make this adaptation of a William Faulkner novel, which was a terrific choice: Brown was himself a Southerner, and lavished careful attention to this adaptation (which many consider his best film), so that the film, shot in and around Faulkner's own hometown of Oxford, Mississippi (which any Faulknerian knows is the original for Faulkner's Jefferson, the seat of his mythical Yoknapatawpha County), has a wonderful authentic feel to it. The center of the film is an elderly African-American farmer, Lucas Beauchamp (Juano Hernandez), who refuses to avert his eyes in the presence of or to defer to the town's white folk. When a white man who had become enraged by Lucas's manner earlier is found shot to death in the back with Lucas standing over him with a warm pistol, Lucas is not only arrested but put in danger of imminent lynching; a teenager (THE YEARLING's Claude Jarman, Jr.), who had previously been tormented by his offending Lucas by trying to pay him for hospitality, begs his lawyer uncle (David Brian) to take Lucas's case.

The cinematography is so sharp and imaginative that it's often genuinely astonishing. There are genuinely great sequences, including a traveling shot from Lucas's POV of the suspicious menacing white townsmen--their faces hardened into masks--as he is frogmarched to the county jail; a scene between Lucas and the teenager, Chick, through the diamond shaped grillholes of a jail cell; and a haunted moonlit forest as Chick, a friend, and an old townswoman (who all believe Lucas was set up) return to the dead man's burial site to dig up his corpse. Two of the performances are extraordinary: Hernandez as the unbending Lucas, and Porter Hall as the murdered man's one-armed father. These performances, like the cinematography, have an uncanny hyperrealism to them that almost overcome the burden of the horrible character of Chick's uncle (David Brian), who keeps mouthing stupid pieties and weighs down the whole picture.",1302825600,13,2175,5.075418994413408

497549,4,6302717752,"...director Clarence Brown (reputed to be Greta Garbo's favorite director) shows his chops with this very interesting film about murder, lynching and racial hatred in a small southern town in what looks to be the 1930's (the film is made in 1950). The black and white documentary style appears to be influenced by Italian neo realism, which makes Brown's achievement notable for a director who started in silent films. The tempo is fast, the tension as nicely built as a Hitchcock suspense thriller, and the story by William Faulkner is absorbing. I was sucked right into the characters' placid, but dangerous world of racial separatism. Brown gets good performances from his experienced character actors, Elizabeth Patterson, Porter Hall, and Will Geer (before he was blacklisted). Although Claude Jarman Jr is pretty wide-eyed and non-plussed throughout the film, his character, a teen-aged boy, is charged with saving his black friend from a lynch mob, so I guess wide eyes are appropriate for that situation. Of course the acting award goes to Juano Hernandez as the proud and innocent man charged with shooting a white man in the back. Well worth the price of admission, the film holds up 60 years after it was made.",1273881600,5,1221,5.019704433497537
497550,5,6302717752,"This was a very good classic movie about racism. I am too young to recognize any of the actors and I wonder if any of the Black actors really experienced racism while filming this movie. Example, did they have to go through the back doors of restaurants and hotels. Also, maybe did they have to drink out of the ""white only"" water fountains while filming. This movie had to be surreal to the Black actors in this movie because I am quite sure they experienced racism in their everyday real lives.",1223337600,5,496,4.461538461538462
497551,4,6302717752,"Everything in this movie is a metaphor to encase its statement in an entertaining venue.  People are singing in the full sanctuary of St. Peter's Episcopal Church while Park's barber shop is selling baths, shaves and hair cuts two blocks away.  And a crowd seen only on Saturday afternoon populates the town square of Jefferson.  The Oxford town square was dead on Sunday's and the church was empty on Saturday's.

But this is not Oxford.  While ""Intruder"" may not have been part of the trilogy about Yoknapatawpah, there is a ""Jefferson"" banner on the wall of Claude Jarman, Jr.'s character's room along with those of ""Ole Miss"" and other possibly fictional schools.

One must realize that Faulkner lived in the deep south and spoke out against the social system in the 1920's.  Clarence Brown came to Faulkner's home town and made a movie with a powerful social statement in 1949.  In both cases the statement had to be on two levels -- one a story that keeps the reader or viewer's attention, and the other a deep insight into how the human mind works.

The extras in the movie didn't worry about the social statement: they were just having fun.  But today I cannot believe that the movie was even released, much less premiered in Oxford, given that the Civil War was only 85 years gone and reconstruction was still deeply engraved in the memory of many people.

Having said all that, I hope the reader of this review understands that I am recommending this movie for more than its entertainment value. I must recuse myself from judging the art and entertainment content because my father was the location consultant and one of the extras with a speaking part.  Some of my 9-year-old friends were in it, I saw them film much of it, and I know where just about every scene was made.

I am probably better qualified to provide trivia than a review.  You probably wouldn't have known that the ice is really parrafin or that the quicksand is really oatmeal. I wouldn't have noticed either, until my father told me.  Yoknapatawpah may have had ice and quicksand, but I never saw either in the county where I lived (others may have roamed farther than I, or lived through a ""great blizzard""). The flat tire on the Sheriff's car kept coming off the rim so they had to reshoot many times.  Today they would have just added sparks where the rim hit the pavement.

Since I first wrote this review, I have discovered that the country store is now being preserved for posterity, and is not near theone I thought. My apologies to the people of College Hill.  The country store I first mentioned is a famous restaurant today.

But whereas in 1949 I just saw a bunch of people milling around, today I see at one level my home town caught and preserved before all the buidings were rennovated.  At another level I see the camera work -- the framing, the zooming, the closeups, the perspective, the black and white imagery.  And I understand the story better, too.

Find this movie, see it with someone intelligent, and discuss it.",1070928000,25,3017,4.631578947368421
497552,4,6302717752,"Based on a novel by William Faulkner, and filmed in 1949 in black and white, this is the story of an African American man wrongly accused of murder in a small Southern town.  Actually filmed in Oxford, Mississippi, Faulkner's hometown, and using local residents as extras, there's a ring of authenticity about it.
There's tension throughout, from the very beginning when the dignified Lucas Beauchamp, played by Juano Hernandez is arrested for supposedly shooting a white man in the back.  There's a huge crowd of white people lining the streets but there is absolute silence as the thud of  Beauchamp's footsteps echo as he is led to the jail.  A young white teenage boy, played by Claude Jamen, Jr., who had been befriended by the dignified Beauchamp several years before, convinces his uncle, played by David Brian, to help save Beauchamp from the inevitable lynching.
I thought the story was a good one as it kept me glued to the screen, not even walking away when my computer signaled that fresh e-mail had arrived.  But yet, with the exception of Porter Hall who played the one-armed father of the murdered man and Elizabeth Patterson, cast as the feisty elderly lady who instigated the investigation and single handedly delayed the potential lynching, the performances of the leading characters seemed wooden. This is a basically a good film though and it deals with some important themes. Yes, it could have been done better, but I still think it's worthwhile seeing.  And so I give it a warm recommendation.",1007337600,39,1516,4.90234375

497630,5,6302717752,"""Intruder In The Dust""
(MGM, 1949)

This postwar social drama, based on a novel by William Faulkner, is naturally compared to Harper Lee's ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" which was written and adapted into a film over a decade later.  Both are soul-searching novels written by white intellectuals bent on examining how the virulent racism of the post-Reconstruction South was not simply morally repugnant, but also corrosive to the souls and lives of Southern whites, and to their children as well. This 1949 film ""Intruder In The Dust"" is perhaps not as dramatically nuanced as ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" (or Faulkner's original novel) but it is no less historically compelling.  The film's power comes early on with remorseless scenes of a small-town mob bent on seeing a black man lynched for the supposed murder of a seedy white local.

The scenes in which large crowds seethe with hatred and ooze unhealthy anticipation of violence to come, of an entire town throwing a tailgate party outside the jail, and of a crowd parting respectfully for a vigilante carrying a can of gasoline (to burn the prisoner with, inside his cell) are all quite chilling.  Even more striking is the passivity and matter-of-fact acceptance of even the more liberal whites of the ""justice"" to come: if you kill a white man, what do you expect is going to happen? This isn't some trumped-up, exaggerated Hollywood version of Southern racism -- if anything, it's a tremendous understatement, particularly with the ""happy ending"" accorded the accused in this story which didn't exist in hundreds of real-life cases.  Some of the dramatic moments have an odd ring, particularly those dealing with the difficulties individuals had bridging the social gaps between black and white. Still, the film is a powerful indictment of the violence used to reinforce white supremacy, and is remarkable as a document of the black experience in the years before the Civil Rights era (including the years after this forward-thinking film was made.) Sadly, some of the issues addressed here are still with us today, decades after the march on Washington and all that came in its wake, one more reason that this movie is definitely worth watching.

497631,5,6302717752,"Intruder in the Dust was based on William Faulkner's book of the same name that won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949. Unfortunately both the book and the film have sort of faded into obscurity. Not only was the book written by one of America's best authors, the film was directed by the fabulous Clarence Brown, who also brought us Flesh and the Devil, Anna Christie, Anna Karenina, Of Human Hearts, The Human Comedy, National Velvet, and The Yearling. The story is set in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford, Mississippi. African-American farmer Lucas Beauchamp is well-known as a man who will not kow-tow to whites, a trait which does not serve him well when he is discovered standing over the dead body of a white man holding a gun that has been recently fired. He insists on his innocence and pleads with local lawyer, Gavin Stevens, to take his case. Stevens refuses, believing it to be an open and shut case. Besides, this being the deep South, Beauchamp is unlikely to survive until a trial can be held. In fact, most locals believe the accused will be lynched before the weekend is over. However, Steven's nephew, Chick Mallison, was once helped by Beauchamp, and believing in his innocence, intercedes, pleading with his uncle to take the case. To Kill a Mockingbird was a much more famous and popular adaptation of another famous courtroom trial book set in the South; most likely Gregory Peck and his outstanding performance as Atticus Finch contributed greatly to it's fame and fortune. However, Intruder in the Dust is possibly (possibly) a better film, albeit one with a much less famous cast. David Brian, Claude Jarman, Jr., and Juano Hernandez play the three central characters, and I would be hard pressed to say which gives the best performance. Together, they are quite probably the single best trio ever to play together. Together, they each bring out the best in one another. Together, they create a real feel for the old, deep South on the verge of historic change. (I hesitate to say they are typical, because none of the characters are stereotypes, not at all. But I spent a fair share of time in the South and I know these characters! Some of them are my relatives!) Filming in Oxford, and using local residents for extras, really aids in the realistic depiction of a Southern rural town. Clarence Brown utilizes  some intriguing camera angles and lighting to help create the dusty fusty ambiance of the slow pace of life in a small Southern town. Intruder in the Dust is a bit of an odd duck in that it clearly focuses on the realities, difficulties, and brutalities of a time and place when racism was not merely an unspoken way of life, it was actually the law of the land. Yet it doesn't take the easy route and portray characters as stereotypes. The characters are much more complicated than that. Beauchamp is not entirely likeable, yet still the audience feels the horror of the injustice inflicted on him. Chick, the young man, is perhaps the embodiment of the idea that the children are our future. Despite everything, as horrifying and depressing and sad as this film is, it still gives a sense of hope through Chick. This is a wonderful film, every aspect, from tip to stern, fascinating!",1347148800,3,3224,4.746880570409982

The movie was filmed in Oxford, Mississippi. I did my undergraduate work at the University of Mississippi.  Seeing Oxford and how it was in the 1940s was great.
