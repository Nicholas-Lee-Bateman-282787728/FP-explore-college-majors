8126549,4,B000FTP2MM,"Five stars for the movie itself.  It is a wonderful and thrilling roller-coaster ride with amazing scenery, music, dancing and costumes.

Unfortunately, while the Amazon description clearly states that the DVD features English subtitles, the copy I received had no such functionality.  Since I do not speak Hindi, this DVD is useless for viewing by myself and my family.  We had seen Jewel Thief several years ago (on a DVD that actually had English subtitles, that I had borrowed from a friend), and had thoroughly enjoyed it.  I had ordered this on Amazon hoping to obtain a copy of my own for our home library.  Guess I'll have to keep looking!

BTW - I have tried contacting the vendor through Amazon, but have not as yet received any response.",1437696000,,748,4.751937984496124

8126551,4,B000FTP2MM,"Unlike Bond and other detective movies, Alfred Hitchcock's hero used to be a common man who would get into trouble and then with his acumen and courage (and luck) would get out of it. Jewel Thief is based on the same principle and so in a way it is Vijay Anand's tribute to the master of suspense. The tribute as it may be but it stands its own grounds and establishes Vijay Anand as a great director himself.

It is the story of a common man Vinay who one day realizes that he has a double called Amar who in fact is a Jewel Thief. Suddenly Vinay finds himself in the middle of a hatching scheme and to save himself goes on a wild goose chase to find this Amar who remains one step ahead of him. The suspense is almost killing throughout the movie and as the plot unravels you are hit by the brilliance of the scheme. Just like Hitchcock's movies, Jewel Thief can boast of a grand climax shot inside the grand palace of Sikkim.

Everyone and I mean everyone; Dev Anand, Vijay Anand, Ashok Kumar, Vajyanti Mala, Tanuja, SD Burman, Kishore Kumar, Majrooh Sultanpuri etc. etc. are in their top forms. This is one of the best thrillers ever made in India.",1305763200,,1152,4.328703703703703
8126552,5,B000FTP2MM,"This is my first foray into older Bollywoods after enjoying many from this millennium particularly. You can't really compare old and new but have to view it within its time - otherwise you'd mark it down for bee-hive hairdos, checkerboard designs and kohl almost back to the ears at times.
However I found this a really good plot that kept moving, kept you guessing and had many unexpected plot twists.
It is about a clever and daring jewel thief on the loose. At the same time the disowned son of a police commissioner takes up employment as a jewelery assessor. Then he seems to be known under another name by some people, and to even have been taken by a beautiful woman for her fiancee. So is he a duplicate of the jewel thief? Is he involved himself? And the police commissioner has sworn to step down if the thief isn't apprehended by a particular day...
The hero/thief (Dev Anand) is a debonair cravat wearing Cary Grant type character. He charms the women and seems as knowledgeable as James Bond about jewels and action when required. He was very good as were all the other actors (all new to me)  The songs were fine for their era but I have more modern tastes. The dances were also a sort of energetic traditionally inspired ones. A few of the female dancers were wearing skimpier outfits than many modern Bollywood women do now. They were more statuesque and like a Sophia Loren. But this was the era and the Hollywoods of the era looked much the same.
It looks like the movie has been reworked as the colours are vivid and visual quality sharp so it visually doesnt look as dated as some from the 90s I've seen.
For its plot and execution I give it a 5. Elsewhere on the Net it seems to be scored above average (eg commonly 8 out of 10). I see they made a sequel so that will be another to visit I think!",1243036800,,1817,4.375739644970414
