8219634,4,B000VRXF7M,"This 3 disc box set of battle royale is awesome! Both films are in Japanese but contain english subtitles.
  The first movie is based off of a book and tells the story of these kids that are put on an island and in order to survive they must kill each-other until the Last one standing.  Great movie, I really enjoyed it, I recommend this movie to anyone Looking for a great crazy and strange thriller.
  Now the second movie which is called battle royale: requiem is alright.  The first 30 or so minutes of the film are the best, after that the movie starts to Lag and get a bit irritating in some ways, the actors act to over dramatic and the plot begins to fill with gaps, but none the Less an alright film, sorta kinda lol.
  The 3rd disc which is a bonus material DVD has sum features of both films but sadly for me I dnt know Japanese, so I only have the opportunity to Look at the scenes :(  the scenes are in optional korean subtitles too though.  And in case your wondering what the special features are, they are:
WOWOW TV special "" Prologue BR""
WOWOW TV special ""all about BR""
Battle Royale 2 or BR2 : behind the story",1290470400,3,1129,4.209302325581396

8219636,4,B000VRXF7M,"The packaging is worth the purchase, I think. The only real issues I have with this DVD is the subtitles in a few parts of the film are screwed up. They either have bizarre grammatical errors, or run off the screen entirely.

Other than that, the sound and video quality, packaging, and everything else are great.",1190851200,5,313,4.589285714285714
