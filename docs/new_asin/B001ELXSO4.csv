3555998,4,B001ELXSO4,This Shaw Brothers film has all of the venoms cast in a story that takes on many turns Fu Shengs character is an expert knife thrower who is a hired killer. Lo Meng who also is a knife tossing expect who and every other character in this film are all after a secret treasure they in turn are all fighting each other. Not a 5 star movie but has a lot of different characters using a variety of styles.,1241136000,,400,4.075949367088608
3555999,4,B001ELXSO4,"In 1977, the maestro Chang Cheh re-teamed his ""Venom"" boys (before they were known as that) with Johnny Wang, Billy Tang, Simon Li (who seemed real smug in the interview feature), Fu Sheng, and a few Shaw actresses like Kara Hui & Shirley Yu (unusual for director Chang to use females in lead roles). Not the best movie from this group, but it's pretty damn good, and that's sayin' a lot, pard'. As usual with Shaw Brothers, great, colorful sets; as usual with Chang, esoteric weapons & great performances (especially Philip Kwok a.k.a. Kuo Chui & Lo Mang); as usual with Robert Tai, Liang Ting and Lu Feng, great fu on display; don't know why Robert was so disappointed with it that he took his name off of it.

Now I'll be the first to admit the first half is a bit slow going, and the theme is redundant & obvious-greed will corrupt and kill you (it was done better in ""Disciples of Shaolin""-also with Fu Sheng), but there are some killer fights & good set-pieces in the second half. Not to mention a finale that must have inspired Chang's later ""Flag of Iron"". Navarre (I think that's the company's name who got this from Celestial) did a great presentation-beautiful, widescreen picture; re-mastered audio & subtitles. Also, a pretty good interview section with Lo Mang (really good), Ku Feng (not bad, but real long), Simon Li (dismisses his film career) & Sun Shu-Pei (also really good). Chang Cheh re-made this himself in 1993 under the title, ""Hidden Hero."" All fans of Shaw Brothers, Chang Cheh and old-school fu, take note.",1238630400,9,1534,4.681481481481481
3556000,4,B001ELXSO4,"I caught this Shaw Brothers chop sockey flick on the ""Kung Fu Channel"", a HD cable channel that shows chop sockety flicks 24/7, most of which are Shaw Brothers productions. While most of Shaw Brothers movies revolved around only a select group of characters, ""Life Gamble"", instead had a ensemble cast that swelled up to at least 16.

The story basically revolved around a group of bandits (three men and a woman) who waylayed a caravan belonging to the Nan family, who in turn was ""escorting"" a valuable piece of jade to its rightful owner. Unwilling to share the jade amongst themselves with the flimsy excuse of the fear of incurring the wrath of the Nan family, they decided to gamble for it; with only one of them walking away with the priceless heirloom. They appointed a well-known ""King of Gamblers"" called Golden Lion to act as a neutral party to determine which of the 4 will win the jade.

Golden Lion had his own ideas about acquiring the jade, and so does about every well-known martial artists who lives in town who caught wind of it. Throw also into the mix is the local constable and his daughter and a retired blacksmith, who forged most of the weapons used by the aforementioned martial artists.

""Life Gamble"", while featured its fair share of battle sequences, also featured intrigue and backstabbing aplenty, as each character makes and breaks alliances and reveal other ulterior motives with almost monotonous regularity. At the end of the day, practically the entire cast was wiped out; even the top billed actors are not immune from the rate of attrition. While Shaw Brothers flicks usually featured one token major female character (if at all), this movie has a whopping four; and these are not damsels in distress...all are capable black widows.

Given the huge ensemble cast, it is easier to keep track of who is who while watching the movie with sub-titles. I for one, do not care for the horrendous English dubbing as shown on Kung Fu HD. Luckily, the DvD release do not even give you that option. The language is Mandarin with English subs.

The extras feature interviews with various actors and producers who worked with Shaw Brothers, but the interviews were not specifically about ""Life Gamble"", they are just generic interviews in which the interviewees related their careers in the industry. The interviews are obviously edited and a couple were quite short.

In all, ""Life Gamble"" is one of Shaw Brother's more interesting efforts. With so much packed in that it is hard to believe the movie is under one hour and forty minutes long....but it gets a little predictable after the umpteenth character showed his or her true colors and try to take the piece of jade for his or herself. Otherwise, figuring out who to trust and who will make it to the credits keeps the film engaging.",1237420800,,2816,4.772073921971253
3556001,2,B001ELXSO4,For all the great/classic Shaw Brother regulars that were in this movie it was disappointing.

3556011,5,B001ELXSO4,"When people dismiss kung fu movies as having dense, inscrutable storylines full of shadowy subplots, shifting loyalties, and too many characters, this is the kind of movie they're talking about. But bear with it; it's actually a very solid story, once you've unwoven the various plot threads. There are a couple of things I'm still not sure about, but I imagine I'll figure them out during the various re-watches this is likely to get.

The action is not quite as good as in some Shaw Brothers films...it feels a bit stagey in places, particularly during the final showdown. Also, my favorite member of the Venom Mob dies waaay to early in it. But it's fascinating the way everyone in this is deadly in his (or her) own way, and the body count is unusually high. On the whole, one of the studio's best films, I would say.

EDIT UPON RE-WATCH: Man, _And Then There Were None_ has got nothing on this for introducing characters and killing them off in sudden, surprising ways. Dense, creative, dramatic and entertaining, with a truly all-star cast; definitely top-tier Shaw. I like it better each time I watch it. Not to be missed!",1470700800,,1129,4.696969696969697

3556028,4,B001ELXSO4,"First off, this is my fourth Funimation ""HK Connection"" disc and I'm very pleased with these discs.  Give them a nice extra or two (whither Bey Logan? Or anybody, for that matter?) and they'll be pure winners, even better than the earlier Dragon Dynasty releases. I understand they're not selling like hotcakes, but...get with the advertizing, guys!  And if anyone from Funimation is reading this, I'm BEGGING for a legit region 1 release of TO KILL A MASTERMIND.
Now that that's out of the way, the movie itself is not a great one by any means, but if you enjoy your Shaws, you'll enjoy this. You'll see a lot of reviews that compare this movie to a spaghetti western, and they're right about that, particularly with Fu Sheng's character. He does bring something unique to the film in that he's more of a snotty, punk kid who just happens to have the skills to back up his badass front. The way he falls for the heroine of the film and puppys after her for the last half of the movie brought a smile to my face, and gave him more depth than the typical silent, cool killer you'd have seen otherwise. Some good fights, an interesting plot (although the idea of a gang of robbers gambling for loot from their latest job, winner take all, them's the breaks, win some lose some? What could POSSIBLY go wrong?! Seriously, how long have you guys been criminals?), and plenty of colorful characters...this has what most of us watch fu-flicks for. Speaking of color, it's not just metaphorical - I don't know if it's just the quality of the print, but the movie is STEEPED in color, from the credit sequence, which is stunning, btw, to the costumes, the sets, even the lighting - watch for the sunset conversation between Kuo Choi and Li Yi-min. Even the gambling scene is utterly dependent on color, each side of the die representing a different-colored object.
The downside is that there may just be too many colorful characters. It's not that it's hard to follow, just that it's too crowded. Twists and turns and double-crosses abound, and that's good, but somehow it's too...thick? with characters and weapons and happenings. It's almost like this movie is the storage closet for all the concepts used by Chang Cheh in his following films - we have Lu Feng's iron hands from CRIPPLED AVENGERS and the flags from FLAG OF IRON appear in prototypical form, for example.  So the worst thing about the movie is that there is TOO much cool stuff to follow. That's not so bad. The only other major flaw is that the climax isn't the most exciting part of the movie - what I call ""Helm's Deep Syndrome."" The Battle of Helm's Deep in the LoTR trilogy ended up being more intense than the battle at the walls of Gondor, and something similar happens here, although the way Fu Sheng handles the final fight is pretty grin-worthy.  Now that I think about it, that's really not a separate problem - too many climactic final fights still falls under the heading of ""too much cool stuff.""
Long story short, it's good, but not great. I liked it better my second time through, so I decided to go with a 4-star rating. Maybe not a ""must have,"" but definitely a ""should have.""",1354752000,,3153,4.585106382978723
3556029,3,B001ELXSO4,"The Shaw Brothers, the company known for their many releases of Hong Kong films for many decades ran by producer Sir Run Run Shaw, knighted by the British government and founder of Shaw University in Hong Kong and even founded the HK-TVB TV network was a major power behind the company and his third brother Runme Shaw (who founded South Sea Film), the film company would become known as Shaw Brothers Studio and become the first studio to bring Hong Kong cinema with sound in 1934.

The Shaw Brothers have created over a thousand films and with several having been aired on US television and some being released on video, the 1978 film ""Sheng si dou"" (Life Gamble) is directed by Chang Cheh (known for the film ""Chinese Super Ninjas"", ""Five Venoms"", The Brave Archer"" and ""The One-Armed Swordsman), the Shaw Brothers Studio's most well-known filmmaker.

""Life Gamble"" brings together talent who have appeared in his films ""Five Venoms"" and ""Invincible Shaolin"" in a martial arts story about rivals, deception and greed.

The film revolves around a a group of assassins who have stolen a highly coveted jade piece that can earn them a lot of money.  The problem is that with four assassins having worked together, the question is how would they split the earnings.  Because some do not want to share the profits, the only way they can come to a final decision is to go to play a game to the death in which the ruthless king of the gamblers would be in charge of the game.

But the king of the gamblers has a plan, to murder the four assassins and he would be the person that will have the jade piece in possession.

Meanwhile, news of the jade piece and the assassins coming to town has reached many other assassins who have arrived in town in hopes they can get their hands on the jade statue and defeat the four original assassins.

But in order to do that, one hopes to have the famous blacksmith Kuo Chui to create them better weapons.  But unfortunately Kuo has no intention of coming out of retirement... that is until his life is threatened.

Featuring an strong cast of characters each with their own special martial arts skill such as Lo Mang (known for his seven daggers), Fu Sheng (the expert knife thrower), Lu Feng (the excellent swordsman and a man who betrayed the blacksmith), Xiao Tang (the man with the deadly whip), Zhen Liu Xiang (with her golden hairpin attack) and many more!

VIDEO:

So far, each Shaw Brothers release that FUNimation Entertainment has looked quite solid. Thanks to Celestial Pictures going through major remastering and restoration for many of the Shaw Bros. films, ""Life Gamble"" looks very good compared to its other previous releases and uncut. I will say that compared to other Shaw Brothers films, ""Life Gamble"" is the only one that does look a little aged but I have seen this film once before and this DVD looks much better than the previous version that I saw many years ago.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

As for audio, the film is presented in English Dolby Digital stereo and Mandarin Mono. Personally, having endured these Shaw films with the terrible (yet humorous) English dubs back in the late '70s and early '80s, just watching it again with the English dub just didn't make sense anymore (unless you get a kick of how bad they were acted). So, watching it with the Mandarin mono track was my choice and preference.

I felt the English stereo soundtrack was OK but felt the Mandarin mono to be much better. For listening, I had my receiver set for stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack. Some may be wondering why the film is presented in Mandarin when Hong Kong films are typically in Cantonese. The Shaw Brothers Studio had films split into Mandarin and Cantonese.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Life Gamble"" comes with no special features.

EXTRAS:

The ""Life Gamble"" DVD comes with a slip cover.

JUDGMENT CALL:

If there is one thing that you can expect from a Shaw Brothers film, especially when its directed by Chang Cheh , it's that you are going to get an entertaining story with awesome martial arts choreography and plenty of action.

""Life Gamble"" is an interesting tale that features plenty of characters which is a double-edge sword when it comes to filmmaking because a) you sacrifice character development in trying to create a cohesive story with so many characters b) awesome because there are many characters with distinct fighting styles.

For those in it for the action, there is a lot of action in this film.  Many types of weapons utilized by certain characters and if anything, you get a sense the film is more or less, who will be the last one standing.

There is a main character in the sense that the Kuo Chui is a well-revered Blacksmith which everyone knows he is a talented martial artist and wants him to assist them or create a weapon for them, anyway to bring him out of retirement.  But the story is written in a way that you don't follow him too closely.

Overall, ""Life Gamble"" may not be the best Shaw Brothers or even the best Chang Cheh film, but it is very entertaining for its martial arts choreography.  But for those wanting a deep plot, this is one of those films that is more eye candy when it comes to the action sequences and with all the characters featured, you really never get the sense that you want to root for one, you're just wondering who is going to survive in the end.  Otherwise, ""Life Gamble"" will definitely please Chang Cheh fans and also those who are in it for the action.",1276560000,3,5488,4.628865979381444
3556030,5,B001ELXSO4,"This was a beautifully restored dvd from Jade Tiger, which was some kind of branding spin-off Image Entertainment tried to use for some of its Shaw Brothers titles, but only this and Opium and the Kung-Fu Master made it out on that label.  The movie stars a few of the infamous ""venoms"" and Alexander Fu Sheng and is as always skillfully directed by the great Chang Cheh.  The plot is pretty complex in its developments compared to other similar movies of the era.  It centers around a group of 4 thieves who steal a valuable jade artifact, but none of them think the split earned on selling it will be enough.  They decide to gamble over it so just one can claim the item and it's price, so they set up a simple match to be overseen by the King of Gamblers.  Well then everyone finds out about this and tries to make a play for the item -- a famous swordsman (Lo Meng), a famous blacksmith in hiding (Phillip Kwok), a lawman (Ku Feng), and others.  Fu Sheng's character, an assassin, works for the King of Gamblers and gets caught right up in the middle of it all too.  All these stories and characters overlap in at least a dozen ways.  There's actually some great acting, some great small stories, and the finale with the flag defense, taken right out of the Peking Opera, was great.

Another of the reviews mentioned the disk itself well enough, though I'd like to emphasize that despite what I'm seeing above for product information, the aspect ratio here is NOT 1.33:1.  It's quite beautiful in its widescreen glory!  And I'd prefer a rating of 4.5 but don't mind rounding up.",1245110400,,1582,4.477351916376307
