7610355,3,B01ATOAFTC,"The first and last 5 minutes are far too philosophical for my taste.  ""Love is the greatest power in the Universe"" etc high-school poetry. Fast-forward until minute 5 and you'll be much happier.

The movie was made on a smaller budget, but that was fine. I don't need a $100M budget + CGI + famous actors to enjoy a movie.

The point of the movie: it sucks to be a soldier.  You think you are doing the ""right"" thing. You are fighting for your country, leaders, family, etc, right? Because your country is the best, right?

But the world isn't black & white. There are many awful choices you HAVE to make. Do you take enemy soldiers prisoner, or instead, risk yourself and your buddies to by taking those prisoners? Would those enemies have treated you well? Or just killed you as a prisoner? You don't know these things. You're just a soldier. You just end up fighting for your buddies around you, and trying to cling to your beliefs and patriotism. You don't have the choice to ""just stop"" - if you surrender to the enemy, they might execute you. If you desert, your own people might execute you. Or you can keep fighting.

This movie isn't revisionism. Certainly, MANY atrocities were committed by Waffen SS soldiers and officers. But that doesn't mean every Waffen SS soldier was an evil psychopathic Hitler henchman (despite what your typical Hollywood movie would lead you to believe). And it does expose the fact that Allied troops also committed atrocities (see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_war_crimes_during_World_War_II). The Allies weren't perfect. Does the movie try to ""balance"" atrocities in the right proportion according to our historical records? No. (War crimes were systemically encouraged in the Waffen SS, only sporadically so in the (western) Allied forces). The movie just shows one (German) soldier's experience. That doesn't mean it's ""PC"". The meat of this movie is just a war story, not a documentary.

Overall, I liked this movie for telling a story different than your typical blockbuster us-vs-them black-vs-white plot. I could have done without the whispered monologues or the first 5 & last 5 minutes.  Just skip over them and hit mute for a bit when the narrator starts whispering and the movie will be a lot more enjoyable.",1489708800,10,2257,4.921052631578948

7610361,5,B01ATOAFTC,"People don't realize that in history,  A lot of times  it's written by victors. Many people judge too harshly. Many people judge all around. We point fingers at people. We called them all evil sometimes. The truth is  some of them did not for Hitler or Nazism. They fought for each other, and for their selves.  I don't believe that there is a good side and the bad side. I believe there are good soldiers and there are bad soldiers. Good soldiers are those who fight for each other, and for their families. Bad soldiers follow the ways of their leader. These guys were a great army. They just fought for the wrong cause.  Bottom line, not all of them were bad.  I don't support the Nazis or any group like that. I just think that history  is not correct teaching that there is a good side and there is a bad sign.  This movie, a ""German band of Brothers"" accurately shows what a lot of them fouvht for.  And it wasn't just those guys who committed crimes, both sides, in reality,  committed crimes. War is hell. It changes man.  Bottom line, again. There were good soldiers, and there were bad soldiers.",1471564800,25,1104,4.415841584158416

7610369,1,B01ATOAFTC,"According to this movie the SS was not full of fanatical ruthless killers but ""ordinary"" men who fought for their homeland. Ridiculous. Nazi-apologia in a poorly acted film. I don't even know where to start. 1. How is invading Poland, France, Russia, and numerous other countries ""defending the homeland""? 2. The 1st. SS was a volunteer force, which accepted only the most elite and fanatical of Nazis, this movie requires an extreme suspension of disbelief to watch one of these elite visit a Jewish woman and be like ""well, I met your Spanish deserter husband in the woods and I was just coming to check on you..."" 3. This movie compared the murder of 6 million Jews, POW's, the ethnic cleansing in the Ukraine, Checkolslovakia, and Russia, committed  by the Germans to the the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan (a country that attacked America unprovoked, raped, tortured, and killed millions of Chinese, and would continue to the last man if they could). The poorly read, in the worst English I have probably ever heard, end voice over attempts to claim that atrocities were committed  on both sides. Because hey, it's not like the Germans murder of pretty much everyone that wasn't them, was really as bad as the winners of the war say it was. Garbage. This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen.",1501891200,2,1309,4.711790393013101

7610371,2,B01ATOAFTC,"I watched this movie yesterday and thought it was kind of cheezy. The uniforms were accurate enough, but were way too clean looking.

7610372,2,B01ATOAFTC,"Clearly a low budget film with historical inaccurate depictions throughout. (Aside from some strange Wehrmacht uniforms, Normandy invasion was in 1944, not 1943.) Much of the translation was inaccurate and used 90s millennial lingo that no one in 1940s Germany (or America for that matter) would use. Finally, the narrative seems to outrageously compare SS action with Allied forces.",1499299200,,383,5.508474576271187
7610373,1,B01ATOAFTC,"Historically inaccurate and the production lacks major resources...if a college student had made this I would give it a break.  Canned explosions, painted tracers, clean field gear....it was like watching a play in the theater.....If you are going to make a war movie reenacting battles... Do it right or don't do it...it is laughable...",1498521600,3,337,5.2407407407407405
7610374,5,B01ATOAFTC,"Ok, so I watched the film, beginning to end, why?  Full disclosure, my first exposure to the Shoah was a photo book in my parents' living room, about age 8.  I speak fluent German, and lived with a family (Wehrmacht father, lost a leg) in high school, living near the Dom in Cologne.
I agree with the war  veteran that some scenes were too clean--far too clean.  However, I do not think this moral play here is about ""everyone shoots prisoners.""  It is actually about one who does, and the prisoner he shoots (don't read further--spoiler altert) as a very special meaning.  We come to like this particular Untersharfueher, who is promoted at one point, for a reason.  He looks like Dr. Savage's ""Eddie""--any German-American who just happens to be born in Germany, and stayed there.  In 1940, 50% of the U.S. population had German heritage.  We like him, and he takes on further responsibilities...and learns in late 1944 from someone shipped from the Eastern Front what is going on there....the Einstatzgruppen....yes, it is shady, but that's the theme of the film....what it does to him morally, spiritually, what he witnesses, and how it makes him act.  I know other veterans, SS and Luftwaffe (disclosure) and what they went through growing up in Germany, first hand.  The theme to me is the moral ambiguity of Nationalism (not even National Socialism).  And for the veteran, you did notice much of the leather was worn (probably used), the camo uniforms were not invented until 1944 so of course they look new.  Shaving was a ritual only given up in the U-Boot Waffe (Kriegsmarine).  One scene I found mystifying and unnecessary--Minnesota, 1946, the final scene. It didn't fit in the version I saw.  The transition to younger and younger boys defending their homes, and depiction of one of them as a young Hitler youth, were poignant.

The film is not about racism per se, nor does my review say anything but that it is possible to understand how young men get caught up in horrific historical events.  Because it is a period I know well as an historian, and relatively new, I felt an obligation to review it.
Incidentally, SS-Maenner swore a personal oath to Adolf Hitler (this brief motto is on their knives, not depicted in the film).  Higher level officers are often shown displaying this personal loyalty in their decision-making....here we see it does not exactly factor into leadership behavior at the platoon (Zug in German) level.",1497571200,9,2444,4.834134615384615
7610375,3,B01ATOAFTC,I thought this might be better but it turns out it is simply to convey the idea that all combatants killed prisoners of war....it makes this point with a blunt approach that should have been more subtle.,1497484800,2,203,4.513513513513513
7610376,1,B01ATOAFTC,"I just finished watching this very peculiar, morally-confused movie.

Disturbingly, the movie appears to be an attempt to morally justify SS murdering of prisoners.  It is probable that there were instances of surrendering SS troops being shot, but this is more likely to have happened after the Malmedy Massacre of December 17, 1944.  ""Tit for tat"" likely occurred after that point.  But I know of no instances of such killing after accepting Waffen SS as prisoners - it would have been a matter of not accepting surrender in the first place (this is an important legal point).  It is a mistake to morally equate the SS and American soldiers.  I retired after 30 years in the U.S. Army, and I can attest that it is deeply-ingrained that Americans take great pains to prevent violations of the laws of war (it is drummed into all of our training); we had no extermination camps, no genocide.  The film appeared to emphasize this false equation, suggesting that it may have been intended to avert guilt from the SS, which was well-known for committing atrocities.  The Allies were not so known.  The irony that the female voice at the end of the film alleged Allied genocide, but noted that she lived in Minnesota after the war, made for unintentional humor!  There is a population of wartime-displaced Baltic people (Latvians, Estonians), and their descendants, in the Minneapolis area, so that part does ""ring true"", and many of these DPs had been involved in the German war effort, some allegedly were even SS.  This makes me wonder if this film is intended for a neo-Nazi audience.  If so, then it is socially dangerous: it could lead to encouragement of vile ideologies, worship of what is essentially evil, and ultimately to acts of violent racism, anti-Semitism, etc.  This is not to be encouraged.  And the equation of Loyalty and Honor is dangerous: one may be loyal when it is anything but honourable (as is the case here)!  This is an important lesson.  Youthful enthusiasm can be misplaced (in wartime, it almost always is).

The combat depictions were believable (if considered to be from the perspective of an individual soldier, in the swirl of battle), although in combat soldiers would have been filthier, more exhausted, bedraggled (I am familiar w/ this particular topic, because I've ""been there, done that"").  The squad movements and both visual and vocal signals used suggest that the film-writer either had professional experience or advice, although I have no idea if the signals or movements were among those trained by the SS.  I saw what appeared to be an original Russian WWII tank, and what appeared to be original German armored vehicles.  The only American tank that I saw was an M-26 Pershing medium tank, which was anachronistic (it first saw combat in Europe in March, 1945) and not the lighter M-4 Sherman.  Also the only aircraft that I could recognize was marked as German.  This would have been very odd for the time depicted, when the Luftwaffe was heavily outnumbered by Allied aircraft.  And there were a number of other mistaken details - and these could easily have been avoided (for instance, the invasion of Normandy was in 1944, not 1943) - but if this is ignored, then at least a dazed story can be discerned, from the perspective of a wounded soldier (again, ""been there, done that""; I'm familiar w/ the shock of being wounded in combat).

It also seems odd to see this movie from an Italian director.  And the introduction of the Spanish soldier in the Wehrmacht seemed superfluous to the story, detracting from it.  Could this have been a cameo appearance by the director, producer, or screen-writer?  It was quite peculiar.",1496534400,4,3673,4.863344051446945
7610377,1,B01ATOAFTC,"Poor production values, and none of the historical accuracy and grit one would expect from this movie.  They end in Normandy, when historically this division spent the end of the war in the fight for Prague.  I love history and reading and loved Band of Brothers, this is the opposite.",1495065600,4,285,4.68
7610378,3,B01ATOAFTC,"This movie was one I would classify as, well, odd, but not bad. The theme, of a German SS Squad in World war 2, was intriguing. Several things were troubling, but most evidently the stiff dialogue, the strained plot (the major character arrives at the home of the Jewish wife of his friend just in time to see her arrested and killed by Gestapo), the strange swings in location from Italy to Ukraine, to Netherlands, to France (I just can't picture that it would make sense to move a single squad to all these places in one year), but most of all the amazingly clumsy readings by American actors for the overdubs, which sounded like a first reading of the script by some community repertory actors. What did I like? The authenticity of the uniforms and random chaos of the battle scenes, the music, and the lead actor. Apparently, all the actors were WW2 re-enactors, so really some quite good effort by the lead. I can see that many will be disturbed by the notion of these SS soldiers being mainly good people caught up in a bad situation, but after my initial surprise, I accepted it. The lead character's casual references to Jews as underminers of German society gave at least a nod toward the political nature of Hitler's SS.",1493510400,6,1231,4.574660633484163
7610379,1,B01ATOAFTC,"Nazi apologist garbage. No good guys or bad guys? The SS was systematically and methodically murdering Jews and others for their Liebensraum. The Nazis were the aggressors, were  invading other people's lands, and murdering innocent men, women, and children. Say what you want about the atomic bomb, but at least there's an argument to be made that it saved more lives than it took. Can you say that about Auschwitz? I'm glad this movie exists, because it reminds us that these wackos are still out there. There just aren't two equal sides of the story in a war against Nazis.",1493251200,2,576,4.76
7610380,4,B01ATOAFTC,"Most of the movie I liked, it was realistic, from the point of view of the people in the front lines. You have an idealistic SS soldier who suddenly has to see things he didn't expect.

My only beef is with the end, when the girl says ""German leaders were accused of terrible crimes against humanity but we learned that those crimes were commited by all of them.""

Excuse me? America did not have concentration camps with crematoria and gas chambers, as to our nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, those were military targets, and let's not forget the Japanese commited horrible crimes against us.

Now if you're talking about shooting soldiers surrendering, then yes, that is a crime, don't know if it qualifies as a crime against humanity. After all, at least the soldiers had weapons at one point, at least they're trained for battle.

I also don't understand why this German woman and her husband would end up in Minnesota in 1946. He was a German patriot after all, and so is she, so why go live in the land of your enemies?",1492905600,,1035,4.578378378378378

8748421,3,B01ATOAFTC,"One gets the strong feeling of a bunch of 21st reenactors walking through whatever woods could be rented cheap. Probably weren't even allowed to use blanks so that's why CGI is heavily used.

It's highly unlikely that such small four man units were placed out in the middle of nowhere without any support (get shot at and they send a runner?!) but knowing the tiny budget it makes sense.

The movie does correctly show the no prisoners approach the majority SS units took, and indeed that's one thing I do appreciate about this movie. It's well documented by the units themselves just how much the 1st SS wiped out soldiers and civilians on the Eastern Front (read book ""Bloodlands""), especially of Jewish pursuasion, and so an SS soldier wouldn't be surprised by the extermination camps.

I do agree with the movie's premise that no side has the moral high ground; we Americans gleefully wiped out the Natives and imported vast numbers of Africans, and so our genocide and enslavement closely parallels what the Germans attempted but failed to what we succeeded a hundred years earlier. The Nazis rolled the die and lost but that makes them no worse than the victors of WWII. The Belgians in the Congo, the French in Napoleonic Spain, the British in, well, everywhere.

I would give this movie both two and four stars. Get rid of the narrative front and back, remove the scenes where he sees Eleanor (but keep the scene with Dietwolf), and you have a pretty good yarn.

I find war movies, with few exceptions (Iwo Jima movies by Clint Eastwood gets it right), don't extend early or late enough. Say this movie started in his childhood (it does have a verbal exposition though which is good), and extended into the 1950's--now that would be a great movie.

I admit I enjoyed the movie more than most war movies.",1521072000,,1811,4.697160883280757
8748422,1,B01ATOAFTC,"If you wish to see a perfect example of historical relativism, by all means here it is.  My fault for paying to watch this since I thought it was an actual account of a Nazi SS mechanized unit.  In reality, it is the story of a woman whose husband returns from war.  It is a love story to the SS since her husband was not shot based on one member of the Adolph Hitler unit.  Her running dialog is that all combatants during WWII were the same, and somehow the dropping of the atom bombs add up to Hitler's Reich.  The SS was renowned for their cruelty, execution of non-combatants, executions of POWs, involvement with the Final Solution, and served as the personal army of Hitler.  They volunteered and were selected as being specimens of the Master Race.  This film attempts to liken the SS to Russian units fighting against them, where the SS was involved in killing millions, and the Airborn units of the USA, who wound up discovering the concentration camps.  There is a scene where war-weary soldier tells his SS commander that he doesn't know why he is fighting anymore.  During the late phase of the war, he would have been shot.  The SS were hated by Germans based on their brutal cruelty to their own people, and the Allies, in fact, did take heavy retribution in combat against them.  They were not regular German military units, they were exterminators of humanity and their loyalty was not to honor, but to Hitler.",1519430400,,1427,4.556862745098039

the soundtrack is the best part of the movie because its very beautiful and amazing.

My Honor Was Loyalty was a promising movie, Alessandro Pepe did his best work on trying to make a good WWII movie, but, i can understand this was his first movie and because of that reason he could make some mistakes.

You could easily call that. If I take my knowledge about history from that movie I would think the only ones who commit war crimes was Russians and mostly - Americans. Movie completely skipped fact that 1st SS division has certain history of killing unarmed captured soldiers - at one time 4000 Russian prisoners was killed by them on place, on other occasion 80 British prisoners ( of course not in the movie). Every SS unit carried out multiple executions on civilians, when You watch this German propaganda view how SS mans from 1st Adolf Hitler division was brave and kind , just remember 6 millions of people was killed in just six year in Poland , mostly by SS. Not counting Russian casulties. Its worth watching only when You remember what SS did , and that this is totally one sided try of picturing all sides as equal.

It shows their transition during the war where some of them eventually realized they would loose and struggle to keep it together. It has all the standard war movie B stories. Family left behind. Friends are killed. Replacements arrive and must prove themselves to the vets. Good and bad leaders are depicted.
