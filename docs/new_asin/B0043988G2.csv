4254377,5,B0043988G2,"There's no avoiding or denying it: ""Bacanno!"" is at times a complete bloodbath. Characters literally drenched in blood, bursting heads, and fingers being chopped off are common fare. You would think this would create a sense of...foreboding, disgust maybe? Nope! ""Baccano!"" is above all a love letter written to life itself. Every character has something or someone they love despite having massive psychological issues. You have the (suprisingly touching) wedding plans between two murderous assassins, a sadistic beau who one day hopes to kill his lady love, and the amazing comic duo of Isaac and Myria who serve as the beating heart of this masterpiece.

After the joyous and mood-setting opening title, the style of storytelling that awaits you can be confusing upon initial viewing. Most viewers will get the hang of the changing time periods and settle into the show, but those who never quite get it will completely understand on their second viewing. Think of the plot presented here as three chapters of an enormous, endless story. It's not ""incomplete"" in any sense. In fact, the style of the story only adds to the feeling that ""Baccano!"" is a story about the joys of life, both endless and finite.

I know I promised you'd feel good, and you will. ""Bacanno!"" is filled with a wild energy. At it's most absurd moments (like when you get to follow Isaac and Myria on their ridiculous capers) it's refreshing and almost innocent in its presentation. Obviously real-life mobsters were never this good-natured and warm, but even when these fictional gangsters take to gunning down their foes, the mood stays pretty light. The main villian, unsurprisingly, is truly despicable (he has to be to make the mobsters look like good guys) and is the show's sole source of unease.

I could go on about this excellent series forever, but the more I say, the less you will get to experience first-hand. Go ahead and pick up ""Baccano!"" right away. It will not disappoint.

As a side note: Baccano! is blessed with two excellent audio tracks. The English voice work is quite spectacular. Even if you're a subs fan make sure you watch with both audio tracks. (you'll love it even more the second time anyway)",1281571200,14,2203,4.898123324396783
4254378,5,B0043988G2,"Words can't describe how much fun I had with this show. I can't really find an easy way to sumarize the lot without giving too much away so I'm just gonna tell what made this show so awesome!

 The characters are for one thing really likable and enjoyable. Ladd is definately one of the best villians in anime. Even when this guys doing something f***ed up audiances can't help but love him^^ Another character I really loved was Veno. Veno is just awesome! I think hes one of the only peaple who isn't immortal yet he kicks so much a** as the Rail Chaser. The main villian is the only one I didn't like (the old dude for obvious reasons), but thats a good think because it made his death so much more satisfying. Even lesser characters like Merium and Issac were just memorable. Those two goofballs are my favorite comic relief characters in any anime.

 The main story involves events and peaple on a train whos stories intertwined. There are also 2 or 3 ovas that come after the last episodes of the anime that are really interesting too. They take place after the main story involving the Flying Pussyfoot (yes thats the name of the train). I must warn peaple that the stories switch between past and present so you have to really pay attention to know when and where events happen.

 I hear alot of peaple say Japenese dubs are better than English. With Baccano that is false. Baccano is one of those shows you have to watch in English because the English voices and acting actually suit the characters more and have so much more life to it. This does take place during the Great depression (1928-1932 in the show) in America after all. Funimation really put alot of effort in voice acting for this one and it shows.

 I can't think of a thing I hated about this show! Just like Monster I watched this on a website and I must say this is one of thos shows I'm gonna end up buying to watch again. The story is compelling, characters are memorable, the animation is top notch, and its the right amount of episodes long. There was never a moment where I was bored which rarely happens in anime. Baccano! is extremely underrated. Its overshadowed by the mainstream anime like Bleach and Naruto. I recommend any who watches this tell friends and other anime lovers about it. Its worth a buy.",1280016000,,2291,4.477218225419664
4254379,5,B0043988G2,"Very few anime shows rank up with other 5 star masterpieces such as Cowboy Bebop and Akira. Baccano! is one of the few. The story alone is so well done and intriguing that anyone should enjoy the events that unfold. At first the time-line may confuse you, but it all unfolds so perfectly that you are left wanting more exciting story-lines and characters to entertain you. The animation is crisp and well designed and the english voice dub is outstanding, one of the few anime where I prefer the english dub to the japanese. Baccano! is a relatively unknown gem that people are now starting to find, a pinnacle of story telling and the medium of animation in general. Anyone craving for new and original anime, or any anime fan for that matter, owes them self to watch, buy, and force this masterpiece onto their friends. You won't be disappointed. 5 stars.",1271980800,4,857,4.644736842105263

Jumping from character to character, event to event to create one big picture in 16 episodes? Pure genius. (+) Awesome story. Great characters. English dub is insane! (-) The story is not told chronologically. But that is not necessarily a bad point...

4254381,5,B0043988G2,"Baccano! isn't your run of mill anime series. From its setting to its style of story telling this show does things its own way and I damn well love it for that reason. With its huge cast of wonderfully crafted characters and its multiple overlapping story lines this show is a viewing experience unlike anything I have ever seen. By revealing latter parts of the story early on this show grabs the viewers attention and holds onto it firmly as the mysteries are slowly revealed over the course of 13 episodes plus 3 OVAs. The majority of the show takes place in the Prohibition years or more specifically in the early 1930s. Throughout Baccano! we run into everything from demons and immortals to sadistic murderers and comical thieves. The current price for the entire show is terrific and you would be doing yourself a favor to pick it up right now. If your still not convinced that the show is worth your money then by all means head over the Funimations website ([...]) and from there you can view a lot of the episodes for free to see how you like it. I leave this show with my highest recommendation. Oh, one more thing, I highly suggest that you watch the dubbed episodes over the subbed ones.

I've never been one to buy box-sets brand new or for full price, but I am definitely saving up for this one!

4254385,5,B0043988G2,"Sometimes the best anime comes from really demented ideas, buckets of blood and sassy Italian mob violence. ""Baccano!"" is this type of series.

This anime about mobsters mashes together alchemy, gang wars and gunfights in a dark, action-packed series that will satisfy anyone thirsty for incomprehensibly blood-drenched fights.

In fact, the narrators in episode one puzzle themselves over which character takes the leading role. The truth is that all the characters stand on their own, since all of them suffer from the same curse of immortality. Nearly 300 years ago, a group of people aboard the Advenna Avis ship attained these powers from a priest.

Centuries later, in New York in the 1930s, these immortal people are still alive, with dreams of living and dying, killing before they get killed. Each group is defined by their unique charm and brutal fighting style. However, they each have different desires for love, marriage and sadism.

All the stories culminate in an outstanding mish mash of cast members who stand out for their courage and their sense of humor. The two comedians, Isaac and Milly, humor their friends with their jokes and eccentricities. The crybaby Jacuzzi Splot gains self-confidence by defending his girlfriend against a monster on a train. Firo Prochainezo risks his life to protect a young woman subjected as the slave of someone else.

Conflicts of pain litter the series as well. A boy named Czeslaw Meyer wishes to defend himself by killing everyone who tries to torture him. The girl Eva Geonard wishes to find her lost big brother, who is presumably dead. A mute woman named Chane Laforet wants to escape from her father's plot to hold all the people in a train hostage.

The anime is filled with countless numbers of uplifting stories, despite the brutal, shocking violence. ""Baccano!"" holds a special place in fans' hearts as one of the most revelatory displays of courage, romance and unity. This show is one of the pinnacles of Japanese animation for the 2000s.",1260748800,46,2005,5.006006006006006

Beginning more or less with a successful alchemy plot in 1711 that ends in disaster, the undying survivors scatter to the four winds, but several different things reunite many of them in the 1930's, along with gangsters, true believers, government spies, information brokers, a truly oddball set of criminals from Chicago, a handful of true innocents, and two loopy idiots who obliviously carry all before them.  On the one hand this combination of twists and tales will undoubtedly have your jaw dropping in amazement; on the other hand most of these people are dangerously crazy to start with, and from my own experience rewatching increasingly reduces its appeal.  Worth checking it out a couple of times online before purchasing to see if it holds up for you.

You have to watch all 16 episodes to get the full story.  I loved Isaac and Miria's parts.  The character's voices although I have heard most of them in other anime's were different, a little ethnic.  Most of the series was set in the 1930's, so when I noticed a US flag with 49 stars, it surprised me they messed up.  Maybe it is in an alternate universe.

4254439,2,B0043988G2,"Watched one day on a whim, having not heard anything about it previously.  I found the show to have good animation and sound, but also horribly shallow, trying to hide behind this fact with a chaotic chronology.  Imagine my surprise when I found out after the fact that this was being hailed as a masterpiece, up there with the likes of Cowboy Bebop.  A fact which completely blew my mind and made me write this review.

First, the good.  The animation is smooth and beautifully done, offering distinct characters, locales, and action, and the soundtrack is solid, if not especially memorable.

But the meat and potatoes of any great fiction is the story and characters, and what's on display here is...just not good.  Characters are completely one-dimensional, over-the-top comical caricatures focused often around one singular element which they will then proceed to beat into the ground.  As to the story, there's not much to it.  There's a few basic storylines the show jumps back and forth to and from, as if there should be some great grand reveal which ties them all together...but there's not.  It's just a few very basic stories that take an enormous amount of time to complete because they're spread extremely thin across many episodes.  The connection is often minimal and, really, pointless.  See, the story lacks an extremely key element: theme.  What is any of this about?  What's the point being made here?  What is the viewer supposed to feel about any of this, what are we supposed to take away from it?

It's this, major, story issue that I find is most overwhelmingly offensive.  Forget the characters so shallow, and even stupid, that it actually creates small plot holes across these key events.  This is a story so shallow it has no theme.  I've seen people argue that others don't get it, that the chronology just goes over their head.  No, I say.  There's nothing there to get.  The story is stupidly simple and to-the-point, given some faux complexity by cutting events up into stupidly small pieces and tossing them across a miniseries.",1444348800,3,2062,4.848137535816619
4254440,5,B0043988G2,"Baccano goes over the top and succeeds.

4254448,4,B0043988G2,"I can't give Baccano five stars because it does have flaws that detract from the experience, but it is absolutely worth watching. First for the bad. As with a lot of anime too many characters are way to over the top with back story motivations that just don't add up or make sense with the character. The voice acting matches this and can be ""over enthusiastic"" to the point of off putting at times but also add what I think is intentional humor at others when some of may psychopathic characters explain about how much they love their ""work"". I do have to say that where this emphasis on incredibly in you race personalities fail in the case of characters like Ladd and Lua and makes Claire seem like a complete contradiction- it makes Isaac and Miria some of the most enjoyable characters in anime. Quirkiness used just right at just the right times to add color and humor to the story.
Also on the plus side. It is an absolutely excellent example of non-linear storytelling and that is not an easy feet. For some the fact the story might translate the fact that it doesn't follow the straight line we are mostly used to as making it incomprehensible.

But in Baccano! there's a magnificent twist... the gangs are no longer warring over turf or drug deals or liquor or money...they're warring over a formula that grants immortality to whomever consumes it, and no price is too high for that! And considering there's plenty of wacky and psychotic criminals around, it doesn't take long for the blood to get flowing!

4254479,4,B0043988G2,"A wonderful anime, filled alot of drama and intrigue, that would have been much better off ending about 3 episodes earlier than it did. Baccano tries to make you guess as to who the main character of the story is with 18 central characters it focuses on. While it definitely isn't as mind boggling as they try to make you think, each character plays a key role in the story going on within. I was impressed with Baccano in the fact that, even though there was just SO much going on all at once, it really did a good job at giving a focus to what was important at that moment. The characters do a wonderful job in helping that along and I was honestly disappointed that some of the characters and groups themselves weren't given a series on their own. The only problem I had with this anime was the fact that it should have ended 3 episodes earlier than it did. The series spends 13 episodes building up each character, and actually has a wonderful ending point, at episode 13. However, there are 16 episodes in this series and, what took 13 episodes to build up for some characters, is utterly demolished in 3 episodes at the end. I was definitely disappointed in what they tried to do with some of the characters at the end. While the wonderful story telling was still there, the direction they took with a couple of the characters after their epic train ride in the first 13 episodes was disappointing and knocked it from a top 5 anime in my book to barely top 20. It's a shame too cause the first 13 episodes of this are beyond wonderful. It's just ruined with the final few episodes added onto it.",1419465600,,1601,4.375838926174497

4254485,5,B0043988G2,"If you've never heard of Baccano! before, you're missing out. It is based on a novel series by the same name. I can't remember the author's name, but he wrote/is writing Durarara!! also (don't get me started on Durarara!! It's been adapted to an anime too and second season is on the way *wink*) Durarara and Baccano both have their novel versions, manga adaptations and anime versions.

Baccano is intended for Mature audiences. There is quite a lot of blood and some gore in it because of the plot. But! I actually think that makes it appealing in some respects. It is also hilarious at times. Every character is fascinating in their own right. By the way, the English voice acting is INCREDIBLE. I love how they use the terms ""doll"" for instance. Jerry Jewel is amazing! He plays the red head dude. I've watched this anime over four times all the way through, twice in a 2 part marathon. The anime opening is just instrumental like Cowboy Bebop and very entertaining. Most of the time I don't skip the opening. It shows all the characters with their names which is helpful.

There are a lot of characters and the time periods skip around every single episode. You really have to pay attention. Yeah. It's one of those watch again and learn new things kinda series. Anyway, I love this anime to death. It's in my top five anime list. Go and watch it, and better yet, buy it! There's around 16 episodes. Perfect amount in my opinion.

Oh, and the dvd cases. They are thin with reversible covers with the major characters in duos! Pretty fun and nice to display.

p.s. this anime is for ladies just as much as for boys.

I think Issac and Miriam are my two favorite characters out of all the anime I have seen in recent memory you have to love the well intentioned chaos their attitude and the well intentioned chaos they leave behind .  Ladd Russo gets a mention even though I don't go for psychopath all that much.  Czeslaw Meyer also deserves a mention how many people would be psychologically able to deal with immortality let alone a 10 year old child?  I liked that its narrative structure was like a Quentin Tarantino film in that it really doesn't make much sense in the beginning up if you stick with it everything clicks in the end .

I hate animes where gore is implied or the camera shys away just as you should see a great gory death, however this series has plenty of graphic trauma.

While I did at first enjoy the two comic relief characters, they became over used and just boring to watch. I am not a anima fan so me trashing this anima is probably unfair, because I know many people who like anima like the quirky humor. So if you are an anima fan ignore me and buy it, it has great art work and a interesting way of telling its story.

4254556,1,B0043988G2,"Baccano is the worst Anime I have the misfortune to watch. The japanese thought that throwing everything into the kitchen sink is the best way to relate a Tale. Storytelling has been around since mankind occupied the earth. A good story always starts with 1 or 2
characters,and gradually builds up with introducing some more characters. Later on more characters are introduced when we have a good hang of the Plot. We have seen a good  story starting simple and later culminating into a series of twist and turns with new characters
being introduced in a timely fashion in 'Full Metal Alchemist'.These storytelling conventions are easy to follow.
Baccano eschews these well laid norms and throws a bunch of disparate events in the opening episodes  to bamboozle and
confuse the hell out of the audience. In the first few episodes you won't have a clue as to what is happening. This is a turn off for most Anime watchers. As things begin to become slightly clear,we come to know that this is just a redundant tale of the American 1930's era,that has been done to death by those big and loud Hollywood movies.
Other aspect of the show is the dialogues. Oh my God. They are the most insipid,lackluster and bland words spoken by the characters. Lot of times these characters speak about things that are outside the current situation they are facing. I found my
thoughts wandering away from those dreadfully boring conversations,a lot. These characters don't convey any emotions for us to care. There are copious bouts of shooting events,after which the conversation slips back into low gear and more boredom.
This is a niche show. It also was not well received in Japan. Also was not very successful in USA either. The above problems i have
pointed are sufficient enough for any Anime show watcher to shy away from it. There are so many other decent programs on TV
and Anime sites that offer a much entertaining watch.",1385078400,3,1914,4.779456193353474

There are charming mobsters, sinister alchemists, morbid assassins, and a motley crew of refreshingly comedic and oddly deep disenfranchised riffraff from the streets of 1920's America. Impressive animation, impeccable storytelling, and fresh characters make this a series not to overlook.

***PROS***

STORY
Anime has an obsession with nonlinear storytelling and detached narratives. Most shows suffer from this approach, their otherwise great concepts falling victim to failed attempts at this style. Baccano is the exception. The story jumps between characters and events spanning three years (in the case of some flashbacks, hundreds of years--but touching more on that would venture into SPOILER territory). A train, the Flying Pussy Foot, serves as the altar where all the characters' stories intersect, their various ambitions and goals tested against one another. Being trapped on a train with all of these colorful individuals is a tantalizing rush. There is also a resolution to this story. I only bring this up because so many animes out there are merely a snapshot of the manga or forget to include a resolution altogether, creating archives of half-told stories that, unless done well (Berserk/Elfen Lied), are maddening for the viewer. Baccano has a conclusion.

ANIMATION
Reminiscent of FMA: Brotherhood in style, character design, and fluidity, the animation is gorgeous and free of gimmicks and lazy shortcuts. The battles range from technically dazzling choreography to downright brutal clashes. This show can play rough and when it does, it's powerful to behold.

VOICE ACTING
The English dub serves this show well, as several of the characters are Italian mobsters and American street hoods. The characters are original and vibrant, and the casting reflects their individuality.

***CONS***

PACING
Some parts of the show drag and it hurts an otherwise thrilling series. I fear that the occasional disjointed storytelling and slow execution will bore viewers in the beginning and deter them from watching further or paying attention to crucial pieces of evidence that don't pay off until later. However, this is only a minor concern for viewers with shorter attention spans.

Baccano is an achievement in storytelling and execution, a tale everyone should sit through at least once. With so many failed attempts at Pulp Fiction-style anime out there, it's important to see one succeed.

I'm a writer and animator, so I'm constantly pouring through stacks of anime looking for gems and inspiration. If this review is helpful or our tastes seem to align, follow along. I'll try to steer you to the good stuff.",1380412800,,2746,5.340277777777778

Let me make this clear; I do not believe Baccano to be a bad series, far from it. I can easily say that it is a very good, even great series. The story is unique and original both in content and execution, the character designs and animation are quite well done, and the English cast is absolutely spectacular, particularly J. Michael Tatum and Caitlin Glass. I understand why so many people love this series.
However, my problem with the series is that while watching it, I found it really hard to get interested in what was going on. I knew about the confusing start to the series before going in, but while others have said it starts making complete sense after the first couple episodes, I continued to find myself confused at what was going on, despite giving the show my complete attention and desperately trying to figure out what was happening. I don't know, maybe I'm not as smart as others here. Much as I enjoyed the characters, I never found myself emotionally connecting with them or identifying with them due to how bad of people most of them are. While this made for entertaining storytelling, it came at the expense of holding me at an emotional distance, such that when an episode ended, instead of immediately reaching for the remote to get to the next episode, like I did during  Wolfs Rain and Fullmetal Alchemist to name a couple, I found myself thinking, ""I don't really care about what happens next."" Not the best thing to think about a show that's so short. The lack of an actual ending doesn't bother me, but that final conversation between Carol and the Vice-President, where he basically insults anyone who wants their shows to have an ending, rubbed me the wrong way.
In the end, something about Baccano! Just didn't click with me. I realize that I am seemingly the only person who thinks like this, and I agree that it is well done for what it is, but I gave it my best shot, and it's just not my taste.",1375228800,4,2168,4.544757033248082
4254567,5,B0043988G2,"In Baccano,

The beginning is the end. The end is the beginning. The middle is three different tales combined into one heck of a story.

Story 1. Aboard the train, dubbed Flying Pussyfoot, (okay, laugh that one out for a while) there's a three way (four way?) battle. On one end, you've got psychos in white suits, waitin' to stain 'em red, if you know what I mean. You've got crazy zealots in black suits waiting to massacre the entire train for their oh-so-beloved leader. On the sidelines, you've got Jacuzzi and Nice, bomb makers with a knack for getting in trouble. And then. . . the Rail Tracer. A fearsome monster drenched in the blood of his victims. MUHAHAHAHA! (Okay. . . that wasn't really necessary. :/)

Story 2. A little innocent girl, Eve, searches for her big brother, Dallas. (Nice and simple~ All you need to do is throw in a few mafia families who are trying to find Dallas Genoard for reasons that Miss Eve wouldn't think of.)

Story 3. A crazy scientist and his homunculus assistant search for the other half of an elixir that grants immortality.

And in the thick of it all, a pair of (awkward? hilarious?) thieves, Issac and Miria.

*~*

The soundtrack is amazing. The opening theme is so catchy, it's not even funny. I didn't pay much attention to the ending theme; I was already on the next episode.

Fair warning, there is no main character. Instead, about fifty supporting characters. :D  It's a short series with only sixteen episodes, but it's got enough story for a normal sized anime.

Baccano. . . hmmm. . . I would buy it in a heartbeat. Just trust me, it's amazing. However, if you don't like blood, be warned. :3",1373414400,,1647,4.533783783783784

Which it is. To be honest, I am incredibly squeamish about gore of any kind, even someone getting beat up in a fist fight without any blood. But the other elements of Baccano-the characters, the story, the animation, the wonderful dub, the music, the fact that whoever wrote this did actual research into the period in which they placed their story--everything is just so excellent and so fun that I watched the whole series in two days and bought it the next day. It's that good. I've only ever bought one anime before--Kino's Journey--because I have no money and have to be extremely choosy with what I do buy, so that fact that I bought it, gore notwithstanding, on the minimal budget I have, says a lot. Baccano's a perfectly fun roller coaster ride from beginning to end, and not to be missed by anyone. Even if you don't like gore. Just do what I did, and flinch and cover your eyes. It's worth it.

Set in 1930's America on the train the Flying Pussyfoot (Hardy-har-har) it is replete with awesome characters, great dialogue, a neat plot, and a neat way of telling the story that doesn't actually confuse as much as it should. The series ability to portray so many varied characters, give us a compelling plot, and have absolutely no part that makes me cringe or groan, makes this a true staple for all anime fans.

The story jumps around a lot, but it doesn't take a lot of brain power to understand the plot despite this jumping. There are about fifteen characters that are focused on to some degree and each one somehow has backstory and somehow comes across as different from the next due to the excellent writing. The story centers around the Immortals, a group of people who made a pact with some sort of devilish entity to have eternal lives. This is while they are onboard a ship, presumably heading to the New World during the 1700's. The story moves to the 1930's and focuses mainly on a train ride that goes nuts. There are mafia on board, there are assassins, there are immortals. It's a hell of a set up and makes for some awesome action. The idea of an anime centered around this time period in America is pretty fresh, and it is completely different from a lot of the typical anime fare. This is, of course, based off of a light novel series. The ideas are just so cool though and you want to see this keep going and going as the plot comes to a satisfying conclusion, but there is so much more that could be told.

The story is just fantastic and one of the main reasons to stay onboard (I made a joke!) for the whole series, including the OVA's. The show is relatively short at sixteen episodes, but it delivers with more story than a hundred episodes of Naruto can provide, and more compelling characters than pretty much every cookie cutter shounen out there. And with so many stories to watch play out, it's hard not to find one that interests you.

Quality animation, that's for sure. The character models all look good and the backgrounds look especially good. New York, Chicago, and the train all have an old timey feel that really helps create a mood and ambiance. Not that the thirties feel is pitch perfect, but I don't completely expect it to be. It still has a lot of good detail. Fluid fight scenes also help the score.

When talking about awesome anime intros, Bacanno's can be right at the top of the list. An awesome opening song along with a great intro animation makes you just want to watch it more. The ending song is meh. The music during the show is awesome once again and really fits with the time period. The voice actors are all good and the sound effects are good as well. No complaints here.

Isaac and Miria are the stand-out characters, though Ladd Russo is also pretty spectacular. All the other characters are great, but some just stand out above others. Every character is connected, though you don't see this sometimes until later on so at first it feels like the Tad Williams Otherworld series. The characters don't all seem to be connected, but as it progresses we see the connection. None of the characters are really emotionally attachable, none are seen for a long enough portion for you to care that much, but they each have great back story and some will draw you in more than others. You get to choose between young lovers, idiot thieves, mafia, insane killers, torturers. All kinds of good people. They add copious amounts of humor, violence, depravity, and awesome to the series.

This is not a perfect anime, as I may be sounding like it is. Chicago apparently has a lot of signs in Japanese, American books are apparently read Japanese style (backwards), and Times Squares biggest sign apparently advertises cup noodles. I digress though. It's a great anime, but I will state that it will appeal to a certain crowd over others. Some may not like the setting nor the plot which can be a bit convoluted at times. It's A-OK. Reviews are opinions of the author, not opinions of everyone as a consensus. But this does have a lot of excellent qualities to it. There's a lot of gore, a lot of violence, and a lot of fun characters to stick out the series with. I can't really complain about a lot because it appeals to me greatly.

Baccano is a 9/10.",1372204800,,4445,4.5280199252802
4254570,5,B0043988G2,"First of all I had never seen this series until I bought it recently.  I was just searching around for blu-ray titles that I have never seen before and decided to give this one a try based on the reviews.  Was I ever surprised by this one, but I guess I shouldn't have been since the creator is also responsible for Durarara!!  I haven't completed it yet but I'm around two thirds through it and couldn't put it down.... but had to because the sun was coming up and needed to catch some zzzz :)

Since I have never seen the DVD version I can't speak to how well the transfer to Blu-ray went but I think it looks pretty good personally.  Since I don't want to give away any spoilers I'll just describe this one at a high level.  Just like Durarara!! this series tells a bunch of different stories that are all interconnected in one way or another.  So during the start you don't really have a good idea what's going on because you are introduced to most of the characters and plots all in one shot but things become more clear as the series rolls on (I like this type of story telling).  The story has a bit of everything mixed in:  mystery, comedy, fantasy, and all in an early 30's USA setting which is pretty cool since you don't see many (or any...) animes set in that era.

The art style matches the setting pretty well.  During the comedy parts it is really colourful while during the gritty parts of the story it is dark and detailed when the gore kicks in.  Most of the voice actors do a good job, there are a few that I recognized doing their usual annoying voice but I don't find it too distracting since there are quite a few characters in this series.  The opening and ending theme songs are really good, especially the end song, it is one of the nicest I have ever heard in an anime.

I managed to pick this title up for under $50 which is pretty good considering how expensive it is being sold online.  I would say paying under $80 for this series is a steal since this one I can already tell has some replay value to it.",1371945600,,2034,4.219638242894057

4254598,5,B0043988G2,"When I first started watching Baccano, I almost stopped due to how confusing the show was in the first 4 or 5 episodes. But after pushing myself to keep watching it, I found that I absolutely LOVED it. The skipping between the years (mainly 1930 and 1931) and the fact that each character played as the lead character where a couple of the things that made this show so unique and enjoyable. Each and every character was unique and I loved each and every one of them. The voice actors also did a fantastic job with the characters. Especially the ones with accents. Having watched easily over 100 anime shows (if not more), it's extremely rare for a show to even make it onto my top ten list. But Baccano made it onto my top five list, taking the fourth spot on my list of favorite anime of all time. I HIGHLY recommend this show to anyone looking for interesting/unique characters, awesome fight scenes, and an all around good time. Although, I must warn that there is quite a bit of blood, violence, and killing in this show (more than I've seen in most others) so I definitely wouldn't recommend it for anyone younger than 16 or 17.",1362268800,2,1134,4.456730769230769

The storyline is fantastic, told through multiple viewpoints where everyone is a main character, and all of them are a joy to watch, even the terrifying and despicable villains. The storytelling design is similar to a Tarantino film, as it's non-linear and shows events from multiple viewpoints. The music is fantastic, the picture quality is flawless, and it has some of the greatest English voice acting in anime.",1361750400,2,490,4.987804878048781
4254600,5,B0043988G2,"This by far is one of the greatest anime series ever made. Narita is a genius when he crafted Baccano. It's a shame Japan didn't appreciate the series because this is a series that has everyone one would need. A great story, many lovable characters, violence and gore, competent woman (since there will always be that complaint about how some characters are useless unless they fight) and just by far the best series.

I'm fangirling over the series because it's so brilliant. Narita really did research during the time of the Great Depression as many Japanese writers tend to get a lot of things wrong during this timeline.

The plot is all over the place and that's why it's great. While the novel actually goes in order starting from 1930 and going to 1931 and 1932 hopping back into the 1700s and 2000s time period just to get a glimpse of the past and future of the characters. There is no main character or rather the main character depends solely on the arc (like I would argue that Firo is the main character of 1930 and the narrators even lampshade this). The plot in the anime jumps over the place and it takes a few episodes or even a few runs of the entire show to understand what's going on at this time. Like the first episode begins at the end of the anime and then starts over explaining how the events occurred constantly jumping back because in honestly, if the series didn't jump back, then you would get bored at some points (1932 arc is incredibly weak given it lacks any action sequence on Eve's end but then it almost always jumps back to 1931 with the Flying Pussyfoot train battle which is beloved by everyone who watches the anime).

Because the plot is different depending on the arc, its hard to keep track with only Isaac and Miria being the only people connecting the plot and characters together (as one episode title specifically states).

Of course, you'll fall in love with the 1931 arc. This arc has the most action, some of the goriest scenes in anime history (rivaling Higurashi, Umineko, Elfen Lied amongst others) and the biggest badass characters ever. Just watch the series. You won't be disappointed. I mean, if you don't watch it...THE RAIL TRACER MIGHT COME AFTER YOU~ :3",1361491200,,2215,4.6

The interwoven storyline can be confusing at first, but the characters are so compelling they command your attention.  The villains are delightful.  The comedic relief is hilarious.  And the characters in general have surprising depth.  The soundtrack is fantastic.

Be aware that this is NOT a children's anime.  The show is incredibly violent and gory.  And the storyline is probably too complicated for most young viewers.

My only objections are that Jacuzzi Splot's voice is insanely annoying and the OVA villain is terrible - in fact, just don't watch the OVA.  You will want to, because you'll want more Baccano by the time you finish the complete season, but the OVA villain is so ridiculously over-the-top that he ruins the episodes.",1355875200,,952,4.993630573248407

Even though it's a short series they managed to cram nearly a dozen really cool characters into it. It's extremely violent, but it's also quite funny. The story has a lot of crazy twists and turns and no ending in sight. But that's the whole point. Not every story needs an ending; and this one is better without one.

I would have LOVED to see more of these characters, this being one of my favourite anime series of all time (for now ;P) but I think what was done was VERY well done. The animation quality is so good, and the storyline is fantastically convoluted. I had to watch it numerous times to really appreciate it. Which wasn't a hardship at all~ I still watch it for the warm tummy feeling of happiness when I see blood spurting and insane people aboard a wonderfully named locomotive.

The few cons I had was that this wasn't BLURAY quality, which is a given, but I can't find the bluray anywhere and this makes me super sad. Nevertheless it's great dvd quality and this mollifies me quite a bit. Second, (and this isn't a con about the dvds themselves) I really don't enjoy the Eve Genoard storyline, so I tend to skip over it. However, it's kind of hard to watch this series and NOT watch that storyline because ALL the storylines are essential to each other.

Admittedly, it's probably no lower than the quality of any stream you could find of the show, but it is a lot more obvious the second that it hits the TV.

- Violence in the form of intense mob action and a scary ghost story turned real
- Romance among some very odd characters
- Unusual yet likeable characters
- Humor
- A great story
- Some supernatural happenings
- A train robbery (of sorts)
- Chaos
- Secret societies
- Change of scenery
- Guns
- Action.. lots and lots of action.

Plot:

Pro: The plot is colorful and has many twists and turns for the storyline. It gives a decent amount of background on the majority of the main characters. I guess to make it easy the plot is funny and creative and I always enjoy a new perspective for an anime series.
Con: The plot although has many twists and turns can leave a viewer a tad confused, but this allows much replay time. The plot has many sub-plots and it can very distracting at times especially if you weren't paying to the beginning and pick up some of the finer details per episode. The plot of the collection doesn't really give a huge amount of

Characters:

Pro: The characters are fun and interesting to get to know them. Certain episodes give a part of the characters' previous life and their past. Characters make the anime and the voices bring the characters to life.
Con: Some of the characters often get the stereotypical roles in their personality and it can often fall flat on its face. Some of the characters don't get too much background information. It leads some viewers pondering what the characters previous background was like.

Voice Actors

Pros: Lucky this collection allows both English and Japanese languages, so you can hear the original cast for Japan. The voice actors in the English dubbed are pretty impressive and gives a good run for the money to the original Japanese cast. I actually tend to lean towards the English dubbed for this anime series. The Japanese cast is always good. They give the English subtitles and give a deeper meaning to the script for the anime.
Cons: Can't really find any.

4254642,5,B0043988G2,"I have watched my fair share of anime and seen a few horrible dubs. This is not one of them. Baccano! is one of the three series (Hell Girl and Nerima Daikon Brothers are the others) that I will willingly watch in English. The story takes place in 1930s United States between New York, Chicago, and aboard an transcontinental train, The Flying Pussyfoot. The English dub make the setting much more realistic since the voice actors have the right accents for the characters and the roles they play. I watched a clip in Japanese and it just was not the same.

The plot itself is a confusing mess of chaos and mystery. To be honest, you don't really know everything that is going on until the very last episode, and even the three OVAs help clear up some confusion and unanswered questions in the main series. The entire series skips from 1930 to 1932 back to 1931 and so forth, but you aren't lost. People are introduced fairly quickly and you learn all the names and their relationships to each other. It also helps that the opening credits list the names as they show you their pictures.

The show starts off in the office of the Vice President of The Daily Days' (a newspaper that plays a part in the show) office. The two characters discuss who the main character is. It could be the pair of bumbling thieves, the small child getting his head blown off in the first five minutes, or the smooth-talking gangster who has the strange ability to not stay hurt, but whoever it is, it is up for the watcher to decide whose story to look forward to hearing about the most.

I would recommend this anime to ANYONE. It has a complex plot filled with mystery and suspense, with a dash of humor mixed in. Gangsters, prohibition, speakeasies, immortality, alchemy (no, not Fullmetal Alchemist alchemy), bombs, thieves, crazy costumes, guns, death, madness, and a tad bit of love, what more can one ask for in an anime?",1320105600,,1908,4.556851311953353

It is an excellent anime to be viewed, and for such a low price, that makes it even better!",1313798400,4,449,4.1976744186046515
4254645,5,B0043988G2,"So this anime is loosely based on several immortals living in the 1930's. I know your like 'wtf'. It's anime though, so those of you not saying 'wtf', you know what anime is all about. I would rate this show 4/5, with the presentation (video/audio/packaging) at a 4.5/5. The bottom line is I wouldn't rank this as a must buy, but I think it's a well above average anime that should be enjoyed by the more intellectual viewer. No one under 13. Plot and characters are much more deep than the norm, so it is very, very, enjoyable, I promise.",1309564800,6,539,4.4
4254646,5,B0043988G2,"It's a great series for anyone who likes action, some comedy, crazy characters, some romance, and New York accents! I would have liked to have more extras instead of only commentary and textless songs, but I hear that's what you get with the Viridian version.",1303862400,7,259,4.777777777777778
4254647,5,B0043988G2,"If the title above gets you interested then stop reading and watch the series. But if you are someone that needs more explanation, then this will be a basic premise of what the series is about. First off I will not discuss the characters for two reasons: 1st:I couldn't explain their motivations better than the show did so. 2nd: Like the 1st episode states. There are no main characters, anyone can be the main character.

So with that the show has 3 stories going on at the same time, they are occurring in 1930, 1931, 1932, also they are told non-linear style so at one point you will be in 1932 and then jump back to 1930 then to 1931 and so forth. If the non-linear style worries you the series ""confusing"" points wear off and the story comes together very easily. Also this style makes it worth watching multiple times. The series takes place in US going from Chicago to New York

This English dub is probably in the top 5 of dubs for animes in on my list. It works because this anime takes place in the US. Also important to note that the Japanese audio works great and if I have one complaint about the English dub is that 2 of the characters where funnier in Japanese than in English. But that doesn't mean the English dub was bad for them. This is just my personal opinion.

If you love mafia gangsters, immortals, romance, humor, action, or supernatural then this series has something for you.

This series is a lesson in storytelling and character development which hasn't been done so well in a long time let alone a 16 episode series. A must buy for any fan of gangsters or anime.",1303689600,,1594,4.41156462585034
4254648,5,B0043988G2,"Baccano is originally a series of light-novels, whose title means ""stupid commotion"" and that's exactly what it offers; a succession of characters, stories and adventures that seem so strange and unrelated but will all come together in the end. I recommend it for adventure, thriller and comedy lovers. As for the artwork, it's done very nicely and colours are vibrant. The box set is presented nicely too.",1300060800,,406,5.074626865671642
4254649,5,B0043988G2,"For anyone that purchases this series keep in mind there are not main characters in this show. This is a series tied together by a series of events that usually consist of the characters of Isaac and Miria. Kudos on the animation, it has its own style and can be distinguished as Baccano!. I loved the voice acting, it essentially was a collection of the Funimation stable of voice actors. There were characters that I wished would have had more screen time but clearly their story was meant to be small. So what is the story? In a nut shell it spans 2 years, but it could be a couple days in one time period and then it will jump back to the main event of ""The Flying Pussyfoot."" Most characters cross paths on The Flying Pussyfoot which is a train, all of the characters have some part in this event whether or not they are even on the train. I'm not sure if this version goes thru episode 16 but I'll assume it does so if you wonder why episodes 14-16 feel out of place it's because they were meant as OAV's. I call those episodes Baccano! Aftermath, it seems suitable since it does take place after every storyline is resolved. I cannot give this series enough praise, and if you've given Durarara a chance you should give this one a chance because it's made by the same people. This one just came first.",1298505600,16,1308,4.3428571428571425

This series will also set your imagination loose.,1297468800,11,422,4.4935064935064934
4254651,5,B0043988G2,"Baccano truly surpasses many other anime in its daring.

As for the actual product: unbulky boxset, great product, awesome picture and sound quality. I love both the DUB and the SUB.

It has all kinds of different characters, and develops them all in a comedic, yet serious sort of way. Full of contradictions, this anime is something that will be enjoyed, guaranteed with a great deal of dark humor.

It combines the weirdest assortment of plots: mob, alchemy, immortality, robbers, and romance into a truly unique show. It jumps around alot between the different characters that board the train, and their life stories but remains understandable and enjoyable.

Truly a awesome seriers. Definitely recommend.",1297123200,,710,5.201754385964913
4254652,3,B0043988G2,"An interesting anime, certainly worth a watch.
The story is quite captivating and had me enthralled while watching it, but there were some issues. My first issue was that the timeline is a little hard to follow. They tend to jump around quite a bit following each characters actions during three possibly four events (like I said hard to follow.) It is a great concept but it could have been executed a little better.
The next problem that I had was that the characters are a little... extreme. Certain characters that seem to be the main characters through out are a bit over the top. Whether it is being very whiny by crying almost all the time (something that got quite obnoxious), very psychotic and (multiple characters fit this bill), extremely stoic and submissive, idiotic to the point of possibly mentally handicapped, or loyal to the point of giving up ones voice. It seemed that the writers' favorite characters were the ones trying to overcome or embracing their extreme personalities, unfortunate the extreme tended to take away from the characters themselves. This being said there were several characters that were well written and I would have liked to have seen them take a more center stage role.
This leads me into the next problem. There are too many characters. When there are more than 8 main characters each doing their own thing and sometimes an entire episode where you don't see them you can forget about them and what they were doing. This in combination with the not quite chronologic time line does make it quite confusing at times.
The last thing which is only a minor thing is that when I saw the preview I thought this would be a more serious and dark anime. And while it has its moments there are certain characters that in their extreme nature tend to take away from this. So you end up with a forced goofy feeling throughout. It seemed that they were trying to mimic trigun or bebop with certain very goofy or silly moments but it just did not seem to fit with the story. There was also a scene towards the end with dominoes that just seemed... out of place. I think this could have been a better anime if they had just stuck with a dark or serious tone throughout.
All this being said the animation was great and the story was fun. It is certainly worth a watch and is worth owning but I would not pay more than $15 or $20 for it. I am looking forward to lending it to certain friends that I know will love it. And I will probably watch it three maybe four more times, but I would be fine with not watching it again. It is worth a watch for any anime enthusiast though and is a great way to kill some time. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. So at least check it out at some point.",1295568000,7,2720,4.420318725099602
4254653,5,B0043988G2,"Baccano! is another amazing anime, with voice actors from the popular anime Full Metal Alchemist. This Anime is a very fast passed, action packed show with mystery laced into the story. Every single time I have re-watched this anime, I have caught something that I had never caught before, The same thing happens to my brother and friend. This always makes it a whole new experience whenever you watch it. I have not found an anime that has ever done that. As for the mystery of this, unless somebody told you or you looked it up, you will not see anything coming. Everything will shock you and amaze you when it is revealed. There is a lot of action, and blood in this anime, and a whole lot of suspense that will make you want to watch every episode in a single day. So I hope you have plenty of time, because you will want to watch this anime several times over. I suggest you buy it, instead of watching it online, I'm all for saving money, but seeing this series on the screen in your living room with the great graphics is the best way to watch this.",1287273600,2,1056,4.311557788944723

This anime is about A Ritual that was performed to summon a demon that would tell a group of people how to live forever.. thay all drink the potion that this demon brings up... the only person that can kill an immortal is another immortal and they also gain all the knoledge that that last person accumilated throughout their life time... the demon only told the summoner how to make this eternal elixer. so throughtout years and years... there were battles over this... great acton great comic relief great story... and an unexpected end to it too... :),1287187200,2,646,4.577586206896552
4254655,4,B0043988G2,"This anime is not unique but it can be watched with an ounce of dignity. This anime is mainly about the celebration of life and the various reasons to live a life. For you bloodthirsty people out there there is a villain to root for and his name is Ladd Russo! All he does is talk about killing, praise others who kill, and takes pleasure in killing or just hurting others before he kills them! Basically this anime is about people trying to live longer with a backdrop of 1930's Chicago. The story starts out slow and is mainly told in flashbacks from different angles by different characters but its not confusing! Its a good series to watch but keep in mind its short!",1283731200,,671,4.419354838709677
4254656,5,B0043988G2,"Baccano is amazing. It's one of the few animes that can take advantage of dubbing. Because the setting is in America, it is plausible to have Italian, French and Russian accents without it sounding out of place. No voice actor is reused twice and the actors match their characters for the most part.

Dubbing aside, the action is fast paced and straight to the point. There are no filler episodes until the series ends then there are 3 OVA episodes to follow. There is no main character as the story follows all the characters to get the whole story. The whole series is out of chronological order and you must pay attention to get everything. The plot skips from 1712 to 1930-1932. It keeps the watcher interested in a mystery adventure leaving the watcher wanting more.

This series is not for young audiences. There is an excessive amount of blood, missing limbs, peoples heads being shot off with a shotgun, and people being shot up with tommy guns, and more. It is detailed. Parents I have warned you.

I do reccomend for any anime fans. I love this series so much I have rewatched it over and over and still haven't had enough. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I have.",1282608000,5,1174,4.502347417840376

It won't win any prizes for good morals and values, but the characters are too compelling and likable not to be drawn in, despite their amoral leanings. In just one month I watched it three times, and it still isn't enough. Told in a non-linear timeline, each new viewing of the series will reveal tidbits you didn't catch the first (or third) time.
