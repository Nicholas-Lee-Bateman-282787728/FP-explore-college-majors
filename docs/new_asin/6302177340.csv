7822623,4,6302177340,"This is no high-budget film - in fact, it looks so low-budget I took off a star to avoid misleading -  but it manages to be an unexpected and oddly sweet, sad film (the pugnacious title might have been an executive glue-on;  the title of the novel was Office Party) in which the hostage-taking mental  case seems, strangely, to really be the nicest guy in the workplace, and in  which a frightening crisis bares everyone's inner life to each other...  This is one of the movies that you might show someone and have them look at  you quizzically afterward - so why did you like that one so much? - but  it's worth seeing.  For me it's one of the oddball keepers.",925603200,5,661,4.360655737704918
