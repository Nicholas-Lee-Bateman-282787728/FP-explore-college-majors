3045779,5,B00104AZ00,"I ordered this DVD after previously purchasing the All About Dinosaurs and All About Recycling.  My two sons, ages 6 and 9, both continue to enjoy the All About series.  Hope there are more to come.",1209513600,,198,4.472222222222222
3045800,5,B00104AZ00,"Great product. My kids love BOTH movies (ages 3 and 5).
They watch it over and over again and can identify different planes/jets now.",1355875200,,133,4.583333333333333
3045801,5,B00104AZ00,Our 3 yr old and 1.5 yr old grandsons love watching this.  They pull out their rolling luggage and play along!,1355011200,,110,4.238095238095238
3045802,3,B00104AZ00,"Personally, as a parent, I do not like this dvd so much (visual quality, noisy BGM, not looking happy kids in the dvd etc). However, my son (2 year old) loves it. He does not stop watching. No matter how many times it's repeated, he pays attention to it for the whole time. It's a miracle. It never happens with anything else, even Thomas dvds. I do not understan what's so attractive to him, but this dvd works like a magic. So 1 star for me, 5 stars for my son.",1347926400,,463,4.0989010989010985
3045803,2,B00104AZ00,"We bought this DVD for my year old. The airplane chapter is ok. It's very corny and low budget but entertaining to my son. The Hellicopter segment is AWFUL. It looks like it was filmed with a VHS camera in the 80s. It has an awful storyline that makes no sense complete with bad acting. It's actually painful to watch. If it were not for the mediocre airplane segment, I would have asked for a refund. It's really that bad. I wouldn't recommend this DVD.",1301961600,,454,4.352941176470588
3045804,4,B00104AZ00,"My 2 1/2 year old is obsessed with this movie, so I have to recommend it, but the quality is just OK. We have both learned new terminology from the movie, expanding both our vocabularies : )",1285891200,2,190,4.162162162162162
3045805,5,B00104AZ00,"My son enjoys watching it: the music can get a little annoying sometimes, but overall it is a pretty good kids show: we have several of these All About videos and Mighty Machines, and they are all  pretty good, especially for the price.",1279324800,,236,4.488372093023256
3045806,5,B00104AZ00,"This is my (2 year old)son's favorite of the All About DVDs. This ""airplane"" topic is different from the one that comes on the other DVD (I think the other one comes with ""construction"" or ""building""). Anyway, I recommend this one! My son loves it. It holds his attention very well. From the adult point of view, Backpack Jack (in the ""airplane"" portion)is easier to stomach than the cheesey overacting of Hard Hat Harry (in the ""helicopter"" portion), but the kids don't care at all. It's all very educational, paced well, and contains lots of cool action footage. There are also ""big"" planes and helicopters, which my son loves (to him, the bigger the better). The ""airplane"" topic explains airline travel, pilot training, aircraft inspection, aircraft controls and components, etc. The ""helicopter"" topic takes the kids on a tour of different kinds of helicopters (large military/ small civilian), introduces purposes of some of them (transporting troops, extinguishing fires, surveillance, commuter travel, etc), reviews some of the controls and components and aircraft inspection.",1256601600,13,1084,5.308139534883721
3045807,2,B00104AZ00,"These ""All About"" videos are interesting for kids, but parents will be taken aback. They are ""hosted"" by the very creepy Hard Hat Harry; a strange genie who pops up in the middle of kids playing, and takes them on adventures.  I certainly don't want my kids to wander off with some weird guy who invites them to look at trains/cars/etc.  Honestly, he strikes my wife and me as a potential molester.  Finally, the quality of the videos is lousy: many of them look to be filmed - poorly  - in the early 1980's. We are not buying any more of this series, and now have to explain to our kids about talking to strangers.",1230595200,,615,4.321739130434783
3045808,4,B00104AZ00,"We purchase this DVD for our 2 year old son.  He is really into both airplanes and helicopters. He loves both programs.  Somedays he watches Airplanes over and over and other days all he wants is the helicopter program.

As the adult, who has to listen to the DVD's, I prefer the airplane program over the helicopter program.  But the helicopter program has grown on me.",1227657600,2,370,4.5606060606060606
3045809,4,B00104AZ00,"I recently purchased this DVD for my twins, age 2.  At approximately $5, it was an easy purchase decision for which I could forgive myself if the video wasn't good.  Luckily, this video is 50% great.

My twins request ""airplane show"" multiple times daily, even over Elmo!  They do not, however, request the helicopter show.  This DVD contains both shows and I have to agree with the kids.  The Airplane segment is well written and informative, and holds the kids' attention for the duration.  The Helicopter segment is informative, but is distracted by talk about magic and genies and carpets and what-not.  I assume this is because helicopters aren't nearly as prevalent in the skies above, and children are less likely to encounter helicopters on trips down to visit their Grandparents!

For 30 minutes of fun about Airplanes, and 30 minutes of snoozing about helicopters, $5 is a great bargain!",1216252800,,897,4.926666666666667

If you purchase this for the sake of letting the kids watch aircraft fly, then this is great.

FYI We watch them all on Netflix, but for $5, is well worth it!!",1367193600,2,274,4.288461538461538
8236892,1,B00104AZ00,"My 2 year old loves the airplane part. The helicopter part, not so much. The ""Ryan"" kid is an idiot. God I hope that kid never soloed. As a pilot, I can tell you his entire segment was full of misinformation. (Magnetic fluid? It's on the shelf between the roll of flight line and container of propwash. Ha ha...) This video is good for young kids who want to watch airplanes flying around. But you would be better off muting the sound and playing some ICP or something for your kid then listening to the soundtrack of the movie.

Avoid the hard hat harry segment. That guy is a creep...",1361404800,3,586,4.327272727272727
