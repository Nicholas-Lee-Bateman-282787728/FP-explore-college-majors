6351835,5,B00JB08CT6,"The performances here are beyond words. Two scenes in particular that prove this, M speaking with Father Phillip and the other being M's interaction with Joey. Both scenes are conversations, they're dialogue driven and on the surface, they're scenes we've seen before. A sex worker speaking with a priest who has ""lost his faith"" becomes a discussion on love and the afterlife. In any other film, you'd be sitting there guessing every line before it's said with a melodramatic pause between every sentence. However in Birthday, the scene results in being incredibly powerful and unpredictable. The performances from McMahon and Eleftheriadis here are exceptional, you consume every word as it's said and makes for one of the best scenes out of any film to be released this year. Then, there's the scene between Eleftheriadis and Wilson, This is the best scene to come from any film this year and possibly the past few years, without giving too much away, there's so much love and dedication in the performances and delicate care in the writing and direction.

This is Natalie Eleftheriadis' first on screen performance and I still wondering why in the hell she isn't in more films, her acting is something to behold.

The screenplay for Birthday by James Harkness is incredible, as mentioned before; scenes are handled with care and love. The story is complex and rich without convolution. Finally, a film that loves its characters so the audience can too. They're multi-dimensional and realistic with their flaws and attributes on display. How scenes are constructed and the mature approach to sex and sex workers... as mentioned earlier ""they don't make em' like they used to."" It's so refreshing to see a movie with a screenplay that wasn't written on a napkin in Crayola.

Harkness' direction is also noteworthy. Too say the least!

Anyone who avoids Australian films like the plague or just thinks of them to be cheap and/or inferior to the common blockbuster, see Birthday and be reminded that an Australian film can be great and heartfelt storytelling is universal and still exists.",1402963200,10,2089,5.028901734104046

6351860,4,B00JB08CT6,this film is about love. A very slow build and none of the expected resolutions--as is true for much love in the real world. This movie is not for folks looking for titillation or soft porn--or for conventional romance. Deliberate and thoughtful.,1444089600,2,246,4.880952380952381

6351863,1,B00JB08CT6,Ridiculous archetypal and stereotypic characters spouting drivel passing as dialogue. The scenarios were straight out of propaganda film making 101. I do not think I made it past 20 minutes of viewing. Slow and plodding. I can't believe this film got awards. The film is insulting to anyone with a shred of independent thought processes. Wayward priests and hypocrite cops bad. Thoughtfully deep and poetic prostitutes good. Slave driving madam bad. Loser psycho literature major pathetic. Young bank clerk mindless blonde shill for evil big bank. Decided to stop watching the movie before the prostitute's baby may have been fed cocaine laced formula... I'm an empathetic person but I could not relate or empathize with any of these cardboard characters straight from the PC mass media programming school of film handbook.,1442620800,3,823,5.290076335877862

8649503,4,B00JB08CT6,This movie was like a slow moving dripping with details about what it feels like in the darkness of the heart. It is about the neediness of intertwining souls in a quest for illuminated spirituality.
