8582533,3,B00CJGP0PI,"Recoil:
Ryan Varrett (Steve Austin) is an ex-cop who's family was murdered & therefore decided to take justice into his own hands hunting down the criminals responsible. He checks into a hotel ran by a woman named Darcy (Serinda Swan) while looking for the local street gang ""The Circle"" ran by Drayke (Danny Trejo) who controls the town. Drayke's brother Rek (Noel Gugliemi) goes looking for Ryan at Darcy's but ends up eventually killed by him in such as way that it causes ""The Circle"" to declare war. From here, Ryan tries to continue his vendetta only to deal with some of police force being on Drayke's payroll, having to get physical with members of the gang, death of those who just happened to get involved by talking to the other side, the F.B.I. also investigating into what's going on, and his relationship with Darcy getting more personal.

Tactical Force:
Tate (Steve Austin) is the leader of the L.A.P.D. SWAT Team consisting of Hunt (Michael Jai White), Jannard (Lexa Doig) & Blanco (Steve Bacic). After their latest hostage mission got out of control due to their questionable tactics of just walking right on & going straight after the bad guys, including Hunt using a bee-bee gun, the team was suspended & forced to undergo retraining classes including an exercise at an abandoned hangar. What the SWAT Team doesn't know is that two rival gangs are also in the same building looking for a suitcase that only one weasel named Kenny (Michael Eklund) knows where it is. So after the rival gangs realize that the SWAT Team is in the building but don't have any ammo, each one calls in backup as it's a hunt to not only take out the SWAT Team but also find the suitcase before the other crew does.

""Recoil"" was one of my favorite Steve Austin's movies behind The Condemned & Damage as the role really fit him & he played off Trejo well as it really came off as two badasses going against each other.  ""Tactical Force"" had the simple plot & with the action of some fist fighting & explosions with Austin playing no-nonsense type of guy with White also being able to be the smart alec of the group to a few chuckles in a watchable action flick that's worth a viewing if you like the names involved.  In the end, this is a double pack worth checking out.",1399852800,2,2266,4.573891625615763
