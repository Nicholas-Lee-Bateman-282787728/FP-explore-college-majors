204581,5,1937825469,"The movie was very enlightening and put to rest my confusion about global warming. It's great to have other perspectives to give a great view of what's really going on. Can't wait till their next movie comes out, the one they give you a glimpse of at the end.",1485388800,5,259,4.3061224489795915
204582,5,1937825469,"The dvd arrived very promptly, and when it was supposed to. I haven't watched the whole thing but the first few minutes have been very promising.",1485043200,,145,4.615384615384615
204583,5,1937825469,"Very well done.  The fact that temps rise before the rise in CO2 should be enough to silence the climate change propaganda, but of course it won't.",1484438400,11,147,4.444444444444445

204585,5,1937825469,Everyone should see this documentary and discover why the science is NOT settled! Highly recommend it!,1483920000,12,102,5.4375
204586,4,1937825469,"Basically this movies shows both sides of the global warming aisle- those for global warming caused by man saying that we need to stop it, and their opponents saying that there is no proof of the CO2 emissions causing it and in fact, we have less of them than in the past. They also point out the global cooling  concerns from the 70's that never materialized but were from the same alarmist perspective. I recommend it",1483660800,9,419,4.5131578947368425
204587,5,1937825469,"If you are skeptical of the global warming hoax, this documentary will definitely explain a great deal from experts who have previously been duped but now see the light. This CO2 sham is one of those ""follow the money"" deals where lots of bucks are available to those willing to advance this sham. It tell the truth about how they've duped the young into believing that carbon dioxide is a dangerous gas and is the greatest problem man has to deal with or perish! Rubbish...Buy this wonderful movie and learn the truth about this travesty upon mankind. I highly recommend this film for all ages.",1483660800,21,595,4.6761904761904765
204588,1,1937825469,Morano rambles boorishly for 90% of this movie without offering any real evidence. Graphics are amateur. It's just bad!,1483056000,,119,5.315789473684211

204593,3,1937825469,"I was disappointed that they didn't emphasize what really drives the climate which is the sun. They could have shown that the temperature is directly proportional to the activity of the sun. During the Dalton minimum the temperate had gotten cooler and the temperature drop was actually mentioned in this video but it wasn't associated to reduced solar activity. I'm a firm believer that we are entering a cold period which will really be dangerous to man, but this video spoofed any concerns of serious climate change. Listening to all these supposed science experts on both sides of the fence made me wonder how they got their degrees. I know a lot of the scientists in this video who are opposed to the global warming scam are more knowledgeable than this video aloud them to be. I don't think the producers were genuine with debunking global warming and they never mentioned IPCC's objective of global control.",1502236800,2,914,4.865384615384615
204594,5,1937825469,"Excellent summary, just left too much out. It needed to last another hour or even ten hours, give more detail, like how the data was manipulated, who was involved in the scam, I wanted names. The basic fact that underlies all their hustle is the feedback mechanism. Lord Monckton and others have proven that the feedback is less than 5% of what all their models predict. But that should be stated as common sense. The global warming activists who want everyone to believe in CO2 as a poison and that the main cause is the feedback mechanism need to go outside. What happens when a cloud passes over, when the sun is no longer shining? That is common sense, the earth cools, but the IPCC wants the people to believe the opposite, that we are fooled by our senses, that it is actually getting warmer with more clouds. Clouds are a natural thermostat for the earth, when it gets too hot, more water evaporates, more clouds cool us off. The feedback mechanism is negligible, and that it moron level to think that it warms the earth.",1501200000,,1028,4.532258064516129
204595,5,1937825469,"This ""Climate Hustle"" DVD presentation contains an impressive variety of many, many experts, giving their comments to back up each of the themes.  This flows point by point, through each segment elaborating on the theme of how the public has been ""hustled"" (mislead) on the climate topic. An excellent way to tell the story.  I recognized Dr Patrick Moore, Dr Robert Carter, Nobel prize winner--Dr Ivar Giaever,  Dr Roy Spencer, Dr. Judith Curry and so many other authorities.  All very credible with their commentaries.  I'm  impressed by scientists who have switched sides -- initially believing in climate change and its predictions of dire consequences -- then switching to skepticism.  Such scientists are finding many many excessive predictions -- not occurring in the natural world; over the top exaggerations; flaws and errors in the climate analysis; and. overblown claims. A glaring omission by climate advocates is that NO EFFORTS have been made to measure effects of NATURAL forces on climate variations.
  Only have one suggestion -- for me a bit more showing of those experts name tags and notations of their specialty fields would be a nice addition..",1498348800,6,1166,5.192513368983957
204596,5,1937825469,This is one of the best movies to date on the climate hustle scam. It methodically points out how a card hustler goes through various stages of deception and shows how the same approach is being mirrored by the climate change liars. An entertaining format that grabs the viewer. Very informative and convincingly examines almost every angle imaginable. My only criticism is that the movie ends with a pitch for Climate Hustle  part 2 but never gives any information on when it will be released.,1496793600,,494,4.811764705882353
204597,5,1937825469,"A documentary not afraid to take on An Inconvenient Truth and expose the truth, and hypocrisy of people like Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio.",1496534400,2,139,4.833333333333333
204598,5,1937825469,"I loved this DVD because it exposes the scam cooked up by the liberal left.  Climate change is obvious - a natural phenomenon, but the ""drivers"" causing the change is not that clear.  The media and politicians push a false narrative to get votes and donations.  One of the many facts brought out in this documentary is the claim that 97% of scientists agree on this issue.  This is a distortion:  over a thousand questionnaires were sent out, 79 responses were returned and of those 75 agreed that climate change was a major issue (hence 97% agreement).  This DVD is an eye-opener and well worth the money.",1494288000,12,606,4.616822429906542

204600,5,1937825469,Excellent!  Something in the media that tells the truth is always refreshing. It just tells the facts. Anyone with an open mind could watch it and then decide for themselves what is truth.,1486166400,3,188,4.696969696969697

7802077,5,1937825469,"This is a great informative DVD. If you think the Climate Change issue is a hoax, you'll like it. If not , you'll probably hate it, but you will have to just go stick your head in the sand to ignore it. People I showed it to who don't know much about Climate Change loved it.",1519344000,,275,3.9285714285714284
7802078,1,1937825469,This movie sucks. Who writes such nonsense? You suck at writing and making movies. This movie suuuuuuuckks. Curran sucks.,1519171200,,121,5.421052631578948

7802082,1,1937825469,"This video was recommended by the moderator of a PBS current affairs program.  It is quite disappointing.  It is a almost entirely an incoherent series of 15 to 30 second sound bites.  Many people who were said to be scientists were interviewed but they did not present arguments or facts, only opinions.  I don't want to suggest that this movie is inaccurate but in its demo of 3 card monte they use 4 cards.  I am not really sure why 3 card monte was demonstrated but that's the kind of information presented in this movie.

A scientific fact presented by this movie: because the Y2K bug didn't cause a crisis, climate change won't either.  As a computer programmer I can report that companies recognized the problem of Y2K and addressed it so it is hardly reason to ignore other problems.

There is bad science on both sides but presenting bad science and arguing against bad science is not a good basis for our decision making.  These climate change deniers present the ""fact"" of climate cooling that was reported by Leonard Nimoy in the 1970s.  Leonard Nimoy was not a scientist so it doesn't matter if he is right or wrong, he is reading a script, not presenting science.

This movie has several scientists (or talking heads) state that the planet is currently starving for CO2 but they present NO INFORMATION about this claim.  Something they did not address was the largest known instance of climate change was accompanied by CO2 changes an order of magnitude smaller than what man is responsible for today.  One lie repeated by many of the talking head scientists, apparently in film from the 1980s, was that arctic and antarctic sea ice is constant or growing.

The science presented here is bad on both sides.  Idiots debating idiots is what passes for informed dialogue when the lobbyists want the public to just surrender to inertia.",1504396800,,1846,4.74294670846395
7802083,5,1937825469,Does a great job exposing the tricks and traps used to sell global warming.  Science doesn't need to lie.  This movie is a step towards creating a real discussion.,1502928000,,163,4.586206896551724
