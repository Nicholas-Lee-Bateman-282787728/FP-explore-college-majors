5831787,3,B00DL6ICAA,"I've hesitated to buy these three seasons individually because I expected to see some great discount if I wait for the special three season combo pack. But, at $120 to have them all in one purchase is still quite a rip-off. It would still be $40 per season.  Some stores are selling separate seasons for like $25 to $35 per season (used, of course), so I guess with their obvious greed in play here, I won't bother to bring their box library to my home at their outrageous over-pricing. I mean, C'mon, this IS just television, after all.

I'm sure it's not Amazon's fault that these three seasons are to be sold at such a high price. It has to be the source company themselves selling it to Amazon. I'm sure that I can get all three of these seasons separately used for less than $50 total to have them all.

Now, what I don't understand is why did they release the fourth season on DVD only? I don't want to buy or watch the DVD. Do you? The fourth season has been out for months now and I'm still holding on to at least fifty bucks to order it on Bl;u-ray if they ever pull their head outta their... you know what I mean.

Anyway, I won't continue watching this series until they release it on Blu-Ray.",1379462400,5,1204,4.267543859649122
8594251,5,B00DL6ICAA,"Great show that holds the spirit of the classic television series while offering a good update for the times. The leads are charismatic, the scenery is beautiful, and the show never feels like it's trying too hard to be edgy or replace the original series by including irony and eye rolling. Thankfully, no one ever says ""This ain't your daddy's Hawaii Five-0!"" Because, as it turns out, daddy's Hawaii Five-0 was pretty fantastic, too. It's a companion, an update, not a re-imagining (re-imaginings rarely stand the test of time).
Most scripts are simple but engaging, and the show really succeeds as an escape to a tropical paradise, albeit one with some pretty gnarly criminals. This is a show that was made for Blu-ray, which makes it a shame that only the first three seasons ever got a US release. Rest assured, you can order the subsequent seasons from Amazon.de (Germany), who has released every season to date on region-free Blu-rays.
The re-launched Hawaii Five-0 is a lesson in how to update a classic show for modern times without losing the qualities that made it appealing all those years ago.",1519257600,,1107,4.862433862433862
