This Blu-Ray is not released in America. It was released in Germany and it is playable in all regions. Though the specs are mentioned above stating that this Blu-Ray is overdubbed in German and Bengali, it is NOT in Bengali. It is in fact, Thai in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. Plus, it comes in English and German subtitles so anyone can enjoy this film. If you prefer to have subtitles in French, but not German, get this film on DVD.

If you want a great story about some history of sixteenth Century Siam, get this film, and the Blu-Ray of ""The Kingdom of War"" which is an additional 5 1/2 hour story of 16th Century Siam, about the story of the rise of King Naresuan the Great.

This film has some nudity, but not for the sake of entertainment. Some familiar faces you will see in this film. It stars Sorapong Chatree and Sarunyu Wongkrachang, both from ""Ong Bak"".

Highly recommended for people who enjoy films of truly accurate Asian history.",1361577600,4,1322,4.6127659574468085
