4951334,5,B0064MMN9O,"It was a long, long wait for LA Law fans, who didn't know if or when the seminal series might ever be released, either on DVD or streaming.
Both NYPD Blue's later seasons and all of The Wonder Years were released on Amazon Prime's amazingly-price streaming service, last year, which was a terrific development. Now comes LA Law Season 1.

Revelation Films is a British -based company that has produced many lesser-known TV series and movies.

This Season One set is superb. The great theme song and all of the  episode. Quality is great, considering  how old the series is. And here's the best news for LA Law fans. I wrote to Revelation and they got back to me quickly, that they plan on releasing ALL of the LA Law seasons as the year goes forward. I hope people will look past the fact that this is an independent production house, without a big marketing budget  and have confidence to purchase Season One.

This is not some cheap, Pacific Rim knock off. This is real, honest to goodness quality DVD set. With more to come.
For all of the LA Law fans out there, it is a must, immediate buy.

 I have to say, I am a little surprised that it has been out for awhile and there don;'t seem to be any reviews of mention on the various TV/DVD websites.
 As long as everyone has been waiting for LA Law, I can't believe they aren't all over this release.",1334534400,39,1351,4.372
4951335,5,B0064MMN9O,"I was thrilled when LA Law was finally released, but was a little nervous since I did not recognize the production company who produced the set. It is in great condition with great packaging and DVD quality. I heartily recommend this addition to any LA Law fan! I just hope they will put the first 5 season on DVD since these were the great years.",1334188800,3,347,4.3538461538461535
4951336,5,B0064MMN9O,"Back in February 1987, ITV started to screen the first series of a new US legal drama LA LAW. Screening at 9pm every Thursday through until July, LA LAW quickly became a ratings hit. Previous courtroom drama on ITV had been provided by John Mortimer's Rumpole of the Bailey. LA LAW was something different.
This first series introduced us to the characters played by Harry Hamlin (Michael Kuzak), Jimmy Smits (Victor Sifuentes), Susan Dey (Grace Van Owen), Jill Eikenberry (Ann Kelsey), Richard Dysart (Leland McKenzie) and Corbin Bernsen (Arnie Becker) among others.
This UK release of LA LAW is a worldwide first. Fans in the US have been waiting for a long time for a release there without success.

4951406,5,B0064MMN9O,"'L.A. Law' was a Steven Bochco creation that succeeded the long-running, equally successful Bocho series 'Hill Street Blues' in the Thursday night prime-time slot on NBC from 1986-1994. It was a classic series that I remember well from my teenage years. The series chronicled the personal & professional lives of lawyers at a downtown Los Angeles law firm; McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney & Kuzak. The firm was headed up by senior partner Leland McKenzie (the late Richard Dysart) and managing partner Douglas Brackman (Alan Rachins). Prominent names in the firm included dual criminal defense/litigators Michael Kuzak (Harry Hamlin) and Victor Sifuentes (Jimmy Smits), divorce attorney Arnold Becker (Corbin Bernsen), tax lawyer Stuart Markowitz (Michael Tucker), and litigators Anne Kelsey (Jill Eikenberry) and Abigail Perkins (Michele Greene). Legal secretary Roxanne Melman (Susan Ruttan) and Assistant D.A. Grace Van Owen (Susan Dey) rounded out the cast. The first season covered the personal and professional battles both inside and outside Los Angeles courtrooms, including Stuart & Anne's developing relationship as well as that of Michael & Grace. In the courtroom, Michael Kuzak found himself trying to defend a convicted murderer & rapist from facing death despite clear evidence his client would kill again if set free; Grace found herself gunned down by a young gang member after she had pushed for - and gotten - a death sentence for a sociopathic gang leader who murdered a prison guard; and Stuart found himself in a tight spot while representing a client in an IRS tax audit. Seasons 2 & 3 have also been released; here's hoping Shout Factory releases more. This masterpiece is a classic of the 1980s/90s.",1436572800,,1719,5.3003663003663

Here are some of the more egregious examples. In these examples, the first part is what the captions said; the part in parentheses is what was actually said by the characters.

4951432,3,B0064MMN9O,"I don't know what DVDs the rest of the reviewers watched, but I thought the transfer here was terrible.  The sound is fine, but the image looks like a third-generation copy.  It's dark with numerous artefacts, including pronounced outlining in the faces.  (This is nowhere in evidence on the interviews on disc 6, so it's not my player.)  SUCH a disappointment after so many years waiting for this wonderful series.  That said, it is great to be able to see the series again.  And the aforementioned interviews are also very enjoyable.  It's interesting to see the actors as themselves.  The standout is Corbin Bernson, who turns out to be a slightly goofy older hippie guy.  His story about auditioning for the show and his envy of Harry Hamlin could have seemed off-putting but for his cheerful honesty about his own shortcomings.  Charming guy.  And a really great series, a classic.",1418601600,,886,4.84

 I loved the story lines, the characters and of course the clothes! I was so happy to see this well written and extremely inteligent show come to DVD. So far the 1st Season is better than I remember and maybe that is because I can now sit and watch at my leisure, I am savoring every episode! I always thought Arnie was a horrible 'skunk', but now as a woman in my 50's, I think he is just adorable and maybe just a little misguided, and Michael and Victor....I know I thought back then that they were both good looking but now I see them as two pretty gorgeous guys, more than just good looking (and they dress well too! )
It would appear that as time goes on some things get better and I can honestly say that 'LA Law' is one of them. I hope all eight seasons get released in quick sucession, please don't make us wait for years!!!",1403740800,,983,4.06701030927835

I've been wanting L.A. Law on DVD for years, so I was very excited by a release that would play on my DVD play without having to figure out how to change the country configuration or ordering a DVD player from the U.K.

The image quality if this release is not great.  Clearly no effort was taken to remaster the original and at times it looks like you're streaming this on a low grade internet connection.  But, then, this makes it feel more real; like you're watching it without cable all over again.

4951496,5,B0064MMN9O,"I was laid off sometime back in the 90s when this show was already in syndication.  Up until that point I had never watched it  but got hooked on it every weekday afternoon on Lifetime or some channel like that.  So when I saw the chance to watch it from the beginning I jumped at it.  I have bought many seasons of old TV shows (currently working through Leave It To Beaver) with my 14-year old daughter.  I have been rehooked on this show and season one is going too too fast.  It is late April and season two doesn't come out until May 20th, I think, and I've only got about five episodes to go.  I just assumed I could grab season two when I was ready.

Anyway, that's my preface.  My review is that this show is so well written and engaging.  The ongoing stories get a lot of attention and the weekly cases are just as fun and even moreso.  Keep 'em coming.  Someone at work told me that Becker's secretary, Rox, becomes a fox in one of the later seasons and I can hardly wait.  I just watched the episode  where she asks Arnie for a raise and he pulls out every whiny, self-centered thing he can.  I  love that there is no easy answer and that the problem introduced in one episode doesn't necessarily have to be solve right away in that episode.

4951498,3,B0064MMN9O,"If you're a fan of LA Law, then the long-awaited arrival of the Season 1 DVD set is an occasion for small celebration. The show, the cast, the acting - it's amazing how good this show was way back when, and how it set the stage for some of the television dramas that followed. There is truly something iconic about these characters and I remember now why I wanted to become an attorney after watching this show at such a young, impressionable age.

The Shout Factory should be commended for finally getting us this show out on DVD but, having said that, the video transfer for this DVD set is horrible. Watching this DVD set is akin to seeing it on some 20 yr old VHS tape that's deteriorated and scratched. Could they have invested more and enhanced the video/sound quality before releasing it? Of course they could have.

However, it was much easier to just slap this together and put it into the wild because they knew that there'd be fans - like me - who would buy it regardless. I doubt future seasons will be improved since I see some of them are already scheduled for release, which is unfortunate.

Still a great show, though, and for die hards this is a must own.",1397606400,9,1172,4.416666666666667

It lived up to most of my expectations except that there is a lezzy scene in it.  It seems the entertainment industry just cannot make a movie or TV show without promoting homosexuality.  As I recall, the future in this program contains another, much more extended lesbian as a main character in the show.

I'll watch them all, maybe have a few laughs, but I'm not going to buy Season 2.
ADDITIONAL COMMENT:  I've finished watching all the episodes, and I have to admit I adjusted to the lousy quality so that it was not noticeable.  Still, the program content was not all that terrific given what we have become accustomed to over the years since these were produced.

Acting was pretty good - picture is probably as good (if not better) as it was when first broadcast in 1986. My wife and tried to either watch or tape every show for many years. Eventually, due mostly to our work shedules, we started mising more and more of them. We were both retail pharmacists until the 3rd year. But by 1990 it was becoming hit or miss for us as we had new jobs plus my wife was pregnant with our daughter. But, by then, the show was already showing its age with some silly scripts, etc.

I'm not sure why people are saying that the discs dont' work in the US, because I live in Minnesota and have had no problems playing the discs at all.  Our DVD player isn't very new, so maybe that has something to do with it?

The quality was just fine..nothing special and nothing bad.  Honestly, I don't even care about the quality because I'm so happy to finally have the series!

4951560,5,B0064MMN9O,"Admittedly, I am a movie person rather than a tv series person, but I absolutely LOVED this show when it was broadcast.  It was innovative, had a great cast and the writing was/still is some of the best on television.  But...no DVD - until now!

My copy of Season 1 arrived yesterday and I watched a couple of episodes last night.  The picture is excellent - no pops or dirt in the transfer.  The storylines were as great as I remembered, with twists and turns and unexpected endings. I had completely forgotten about the transexual man who stood up at Norman Cheney's funeral - shocking in the day!  I had also forgotten (and had to laugh at) those horrible synthetic material dresses/suits with the gi-normous shoulder pads that were de rigueur in corporate America in the late 80's. Jeez! I look forward to revisiting The Venus Butterfly, Kuzak's pursuit of Grace - in a gorilla suit, and the trial over the bull semen, et al.

I do recall that towards the end of the series 8-year (I believe) run, signs of wear were showing.  I mean, the writers had poor Susan Dey hooked up with everyone except the plumber, and Jimmy Smits and Harry Hamlin had long vacated their roles.  But in those first several seasons, L.A. Law was the show to watch and the show we all talked about at work the next day.

I am SO GLAD this finally came out on DVD.  22 hour-long (roughly) episodes - what a deal.  And of course, once again, I get to hear Richard Dysart say, ""Move along, Douglas.""",1349136000,2,1476,4.4664179104477615

The discs would not play on a little Samsung netbook I have, but when I plugged the DVD drive into my new apple airbook, the discs played fine.  After watching season 1, I ordered season 2 from Amazon in England.  Scroll down to the bottom of this page to see a link to Amazon U.K.  It came in good time, but instead of just playing it, when I put it in I got a message saying that I needed to change the zone in my DVD player from zone 1 to zone 2.  It also said I could only do that 5 times.  So I clicked on the little icon on my computer screen to switch the zone, and it is playing fine now.  I've already watched the first 3 discs in season 2.

I was a little worried that every time I played a disc I would have to re-choose zone 2, which would count as one of my five switches, but that hasn't happened.  It is just staying switched to zone 2.  I don't use the DVD drive for much now except occasional movies, so it's not a big deal.  If you need to use your DVD drive all the time, this probably wouldn't work for you.

I was concerned about the DVDs playing in the US as they come from a publisher in England. I contacted the seller by email and received a prompt reply that the discs did not have a Region and would play on US machines.

My package arrived yesterday (one day early) and I opened it immediately. I did note that the back of the dvd slip cover shows PAL and the number two in a circle but I had been told that there was no region so I proceeded to remove the plastic wrapping. The six-disc set is contained in a plastic case with a colorful slip cover. The plastic disc case itself is a little difficult to open and close but the discs are securely held in compartments inside. The discs themselves are professionally made with screen-printed labels. The discs are single-sided.

The quality of the transfer to disc was very good in both video and sound. I noted a small amount of ""screening"" from time to time which could be from the original material, the transfer process or an artifact of the machine that I used to view the first episode. It could also be that this video artifact was only on the first episode. I did not find it overly distracting and will try viewing on another machine to see if it persists.

There are no extras on the discs which is disappointing but not surprising considering the age of the series. I base my buying decision on the main program and not the extras so I would have purchased this set regardless.

Overall I am extremely pleased with this purchase. I understand that the same publisher intends to release the remaining seasons of LA Law, perhaps even this year, and I intend to purchase them all.",1334880000,36,1742,4.400621118012422

Special features include in depth interviews with Larry Drake, Steven Bochco, and all original cast members except for Richard Dysart and Michele Greene. The problem with this DVD set is the dirty prints used of the masters. The show is horribly grainy and hard to watch at times. Shows 20 years older look much better. It needs to be cleaned up. At times dramatic, L.A. Law used current topics and ageless social issues to present a highly entertaining and informative episode each week from 1986-1994. It also balanced the serious with impeccable comedy. David E. Kelley worked on this long before his more famous creations. The best legal show next to Perry Mason.
