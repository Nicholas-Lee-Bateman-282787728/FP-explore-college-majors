8316904,5,B001L28GZW,"One of the most enjoyable 60s Eurospy flicks I've seen lately. Diana Lorys is one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen: her character is introduced very promisingly, as a high-ranking agent who can even cause ""spinal fractures"" to her enemies, and she develops a nice interplay with the male lead, Anthony Eisley. But then she is rather clumsily written out of the story until the very end, while the main bad girl of the film (Wandisa Guida - her ultra-tight black outfit emphasizes her jaw-dropping curves) turns out to be an entrapped good girl after all. Although the influence of ""Goldfinger"" and ""Thunderball"" on ""Lightning Bolt"" is clear, the sci-fi aspects actually predate other official Bond films such as ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""Diamonds Are Forever"". The second half takes place almost entirely in the villain's underwater headquarters: the sets are quite elaborate, but the scenes of their eventual destruction go on too long. Still, if you're in the mood for a light and unpretentious take on the less serious side of espionage, ""Lightning Bolt"" should fit the bill.",1523059200,,1091,4.967213114754099
8316905,3,B001L28GZW,There was a big disparity in the ratings of the three movies and the trailers.  Two movies were PG level movies.  One movie and some of the trailers were hard R ratings at least.,1390694400,,178,4.205882352941177
8316906,3,B001L28GZW,"American moon rockets (remember them?) are suspected of being sabotaged when the sixth one in a row blows up. It is believed a ""radiation force"" is responsible as they discover ""signals from the bottom of the sea."" So much for science. To find out what is going on they call in...

Harry Sennet (Anthony Eisley),the American version of James Bond. He works with Capt. Flanagan (Diana Lorys) who is also a love interest. It is decided the best way to scour the sea bottom off Cape Kennedy is for Harry to go to Florida and buy a seaplane pretending to be a playboy. Harry also provides some gumshoe style narration while Capt. Flanagan has her own jazz swagger music. Harry drives one of those cars that stays stationary while the same scenery quickly moves behind it.

Perhaps in 1966 this was a decent film...okay it wasn't back then either. Today this production has all that spy camp value we have come to love including hibernation chambers. Watch it for camp value only. I don't know where they got the drawing of the girl in the red tight jumpsuit. It has nothing to do with the film.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Warning: If you watch this on a Rare Flix DVD there is nudity in the movie trailers.",1363910400,,1220,4.536363636363636
8316907,3,B001L28GZW,"This triple film collection may be the best in the series, judging from trailers to the others. Bamboozled claims to be of the style of Groove Tube, but frankly the jokes are sour and the movie tries to be both a straight story & a series of jokes. Neither work. Transformed tries to be both a religious movie about redemption & an action movie with Leo Fong & Fred Williamson. They seem to be put here hapzardly and telephone their action. The commentary with Leo Fong is more entertaining. Lightning Bolt (which I noticed from a trailer on the 42nd Street Forever series) is an Itallian knock-off of James Bond and made in the mid-60s. For what its worth, if you keep the expectations down, it is entertaining enough to be worth the purchase of this collection.",1363824000,3,763,4.576642335766423
8316908,4,B001L28GZW,"I love these Rareflix box sets because they enable the company to put out movies that probably wouldn't economically justify release on their own by bundling them together. Then they price them reasonably enough that it's like you're buying a single DVD anyway. So if you're interested in any one of these movies, it's well worth buying the whole set at this price. They're individually packaged, too, so you can easily discard the ones you don't want if you're so inclined.

For me the draw was the 1966 Antonio Margheriti Eurospy movie Lightning Bolt, also known by several other names including Operation Goldman. It's a fun low-budget James Bond knock-off, one of my favorite examples of the genre, in fact. For the first 2/3 of the film, you believe they had almost nothing to make the movie with, but then in the finale Margheriti pulls out all the stops for a big underwater spy base finale with all the bells and whistles you expect of 007. This version is a beautiful widescreen transfer, and far preferable to the other gray market versions of this title available on Amazon. A word of caution, though: don't jump directly from Thunderball into the world of Eurospy knock-offs with this movie. Ease in with a glossier production like Deadlier Than the Male or Special Mission Lady Chaplin (both available on Amazon), then move on to the likes of Lightning Bolt. You have to know what you're getting into. But if you're already a seasoned Eurospy aficionado, by all means buy this at once! You won't be disappointed.",1331424000,11,1525,4.798479087452471
8316909,4,B001L28GZW,"This 1966 entry in the genre is defenetly one of the most entertaining! Its fast moving, have lots of fun, and  gorgeous locations.(Ofcourse!)
 In other words, it,s very typical for it,s kind, but directed by a good,inventive director in the action/adventure genre thru the years: Anthony M. Dawson (Antonio Margueriti) And it,s got a cool, fast moving screenplay by profilic producer/writer/director Alfonso Balcazar.

Anthony Eisley is superb in the male lead, and a far better actor then many other guys associated with the genre(No offense, Thomas Hunter, Richard Harrison, Kerwin Mathews, Lex Barker a.o. I like some of your work too!)
Wadisa Leigh and the rest of the sexy,beutiful girls, are doing a fine job with their parts.
Okay, there is some stupid scenes, aspecially one including a waterfilled silo, but its not a film to take seriousely in a way, that some weird scenes will spoil the rest.

Filmed in widescope, the dvd transfer is only 4:3 standard, and thow the picture quality is not bad, it`s far from perfect. This goes for both the anton release and the one from sinister cinema.
The anton dvd,s atleast have a menu with chapters, while the sinister version includes the original trailer.
Its NOT bad dvd products, and the color is excellent, but perhaps they could have been even better. Anyway, i defenetly recommend it!",1268697600,10,1344,4.986607142857143
