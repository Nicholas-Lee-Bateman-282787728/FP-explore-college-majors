7844594,2,6303343929,"I will not say that ""I hate it (1 star)"" because it is my favorite genre and addresses a topic I am quite knowledgeable about (the death penalty.)  That being said, there is nothing else that would save this movie from the lowest rating possible.  Sure the actors are decent...but what does that get you without some sense of a plot?  For starters, who is the bad guy?  Is the man sentenced to die in fact guilty?  And who's pulling the strings for what?  If you can figure out any of these, I concede that you are a smarter human being than me and can probably get more out of this film than I did.  Yes, I understand it was a TV movie and not a Hollywood feature, but I was nevertheless dissappointed...even TV movies have been better.",1378080000,,737,4.297101449275362

7844596,2,6303343929,"This TVM about the evil lords of pay-for-view TV hooks into the bread and circuses level of entertainment, but taking us where Jerry Springer is yet to go - live coverage of the execution of death row criminals. That the company who forms an agreement with politicians is called Tycom may be a reference to Viacom, with Sean Young as the head of programming, Len Cariou as her boss, and Timothy Daly as the convicted killer chosen for his appeal to women, who we are told control the remote in American households. Although Daly's Sean Penn Dead Man Walking bouffant gives him a sociopathic suggestion, to Young he is a pussycat, which leads her to believe that he is innocent, so director Tommy Lee Wallace gives us a race against the ""countdown to justice"". The teleplay by Thomas Baum hasn't decided what we ultimately should believe about Daly. It has Young leaning towards his innocence which would make her want to pull the program, but the case it offers in his defense is hardly believable and represented by Dee Wallace Stone in a I'm making the most of my few scenes performance. This therefore works against Young's character, who has been previously established as cynical and savvy, and Wallace skimps on any romance between Young and Daly. Looking very beautiful, Young gives some surprising line readings, and provides a memorable howl. Wallace cuts between the film and video stock  so that the TV coverage is striking, there is an amusing scene of an on-the-scene reporter being jostled by the crowd who she reports have been denied access to the event, and the climactic execution set reminded me of something from Triumph of the Will via Network, with the Big Brother/Big Business implications chillingly realised.",999907200,5,1733,4.894557823129252
