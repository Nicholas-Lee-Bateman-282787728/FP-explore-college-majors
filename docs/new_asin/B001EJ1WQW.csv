3555173,1,B001EJ1WQW,"I was disgusted by the misleading nature of this film. If this was supposed to be a parody, they failed to make it entertaining, but I believe the intentions were to propagate blatant lies in an effort to (surprise!) sell structured water. The most amazing aspect of this movie is that they drew out the nonsense for a full hour and a half. Everyone associated with the film should be embarrassed.",1236902400,8,397,4.605633802816901
3555174,5,B001EJ1WQW,This is a wake up call to our inner consciousness!!! Everybody must be exposed to this knowledge. You will not see water the same way again.....,1235779200,8,144,4.576923076923077
3555175,5,B001EJ1WQW,"This beautiful film is educational, inspiring and important. It reveals the mysteries and miracles of water. This was a world wide effort but the research, photography and production seems to be primarily Russian  and includes interviews with scientists and clergy and narrated in English. And since people are mostly water we too can absorb the imprints of our environment-good or bad- just as water does. Earth is apparently the only water planet in the known universe yet we take water for granted, waste and pollute it. Many topics are discussed here, such as holy water and structured water. We usually consume devitalized municipal and bottled water but here we see that sending good wishes to our water benefits us because that raises it's conciousness and vitality. See it!",1234656000,21,781,5.1015625

3555177,5,B001EJ1WQW,"For all of those who do not know it,  Mind over matter was the subject of the 1927, 5th Solvay Conference on Quantum Mechanics:  [...]

It was there that Heisenberg and Bohr came to Einstein to tell him it looked like the minds of the researchers were affecting the results of the experiments.  Mind was inexorably linked to matter.  Einstein later said, ""Everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe-a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble.""

In this amazing film, ""Water, the Great Mystery,"" we can see that science has made a quantum leap into understanding how mind can be recorded by the most simple element in nature (water) and on the periodic table: H20.  If water has memory, and its main component being hydrogen, then the whole universe would have memory.  Hydrogen was born between 100 and 1,000 seconds after the big bang.  It makes up 75% of the known mass of the universe and now is part of the missing mass equation.

This is the kind of film that needs to be reported by every news station in the world.",1227571200,45,1181,4.502347417840376
3555178,5,B001EJ1WQW,"I hate definitions like ""life-changing"", ""amazing"", ""unbelievable"", etc. but this movie is just that in absolutely every aspect. Why? Its just another proof we know almost NOTHING about the planet we inhabit. I did not know that :

* water has memory
* water senses human emotions and reacts to them
* water is able to communicate from a distance
* a prayer can turn bad water into good one
* both tap & bottled water are ""dead"" and bear no positive energy

Scientific proofs from different countries & parts of the world are captured in this movie and the above listed facts are just a small fraction of what has been discovered recently.

I recommend this movie to every person who wants to understand more about themselves, the world we live in and maybe even the direction in which our civilization is headed. Have you ever asked yourselves why underdeveloped people living in the nature are much more happy than us living in the most developed cities of the world? A major part of the answer may lie hidden in the water we drink.",1225929600,44,1034,4.578378378378378

3555190,5,B001EJ1WQW,"The understanding, wisdom and knowledge of WATER cannot possibly be overstated.  Without water, we would not exist nor survive.  The more you under this ""Great Mystery"" the more you feel CALLED to do everything in your power to promote the care and keeping of ""clean water"" and help this cause throughout the world to all nations, kindred and tongues.  You will also understand mor than ever those that have ministeries in providing clean, potable water to the nations of the earth, and perhaps be willing to ""tithe"" money to some of these ministeries or charities.

3555194,5,B001EJ1WQW,"I have to say this DVD is fascinating and really a good presentation of just how miraculous Water is and as the source of life for us, it has some pretty interesting properties.

3555198,5,B001EJ1WQW,"This is very good documentary on the energy side of water. I would have liked to have seen some footage of the Ganges river where the water is claimed by most of India to have healing powers. I have done a lot of study on water for drinking and you can taste and feel a huge difference in many different kinds of waters.

I love when people spout off terms like pseudo-science. Not realizing every advancement we have today like The Airplane, Space Travel, The Automobile, A/C Electricity was first called fantasy or science fiction by the top scientists of that day. Anyone or anything that it out of the mainstream accepted view is always discredited, attacked and often even covered up.

However, some of science does seem a bit...well I'd say that I'm a bit skeptical but nevertheless it opened my eyes a bit and for that I give it a great review.

3555207,5,B001EJ1WQW,"This video has important information about water, and our effect on water, and by implication our ability to develop spiritually through mastering our feelings (by intentionally improving the structure of water through non-rational means).",1284336000,8,239,6.0588235294117645
3555208,1,B001EJ1WQW,"The information and claims in this DVD are inaccurate, unscientific, and bordering on lunacy. None of the scientific claims are substantiated in any way, and the explanations and claims are purposefully cryptic, and, in most cases, scientifically untestable. This video is nothing more than an exercise in power of suggestion and borderline lunacy. And the scientific validity and outright plausibility of the claims are close to zero. If you are in any way a skeptical person or a scientist, you will laugh at the claims in this video. And if you're scientifically illiterate or impressionable, you will be astounded and fall under the spell. I'm sorry, but I have to see more evidence, so I request the creators of this video to make another DVD giving details of all the studies that back up the claims they made. A piece of paper with lines on it or people staring at a beaker of water and then saying they measured ""something"" does not convince me of anything. And using electromagnetic waves that are undetectable in most cases and then saying they had an effect on water is laughable to say the least, especially when there is no control and there are all sorts of stronger electromagnetic waves all over the place. And how do you detect and measure the ""structurization"" of water in the first place? What exactly did this experiment measure? I really want to believe everything in the DVD and hope we indeed can affect water and it can affect us, but it's very tough to swallow. They need to keep science out of this video and stick to philosophy and metaphysics. Science cannot yet test these claims, and probably never will be able to test them.",1283990400,7,1655,4.75
3555209,2,B001EJ1WQW,"There are the hints of some possibly interesting science being presented in this film, but they are heavily obscured by the rhetorical presentation, heavy religious overtones and deep inconsistencies. The ""structure"" of water is presented with cute computer graphics with no explanation as to how the structures form, how they persist and how they are erased. On the one hand the makers present the idea that simply thinking bad thoughts around water can alter its structure, and at the same time they claim to be able to capture water on a high plateau, transport it thousands of miles and then carry out experiments on it without altering its structure. There is the implication that vaporising will eliminate any stored structure, and yet also the implication that the water can retain its information after evaporating to clouds and falling as rain. Much of the theory is backed up with anecdotes which are hundreds of years old as ""evidence"".

Some of the researchers who are presented have some interesting hypotheses and evidence to present, but many of them are clearly on the fringe of their scientific communities. The titles they are given on screen are not greatly impressive in a lot of cases (in one case, being presented only as ""Researcher"") and arguments from priests, rabbis and other religious figures are presented as having equal weight to those from scientific institutes.

On the whole, the film is very wooly. As I said, there is clearly some interesting science which may come out of following some of these ideas, but this film presents nothing but the thinnest veneer of that on top of some very unstructured rhetoric.",1275955200,5,1645,5.0
3555210,1,B001EJ1WQW,"Quantum mechanics definitely does *not* say that our mind influences matter. Observation does - but that can be by a speck of dust or by a cricket bat or a light beam. Quantum mechanics is about chance - wave functions can ""collapse"" into different states, but this is random, just like playing blackjack. We can calculate the odds, but that's it. Most significantly, no experiment has ever shown an ability for humans to influence these probabilities just by thinking about it.

And there is zero evidence that water has a memory - zero evidence, and zero explainable theory for how this might happen.

I'm afraid this movie is just wishful thinking, and should be treated as nothing more than a fantasy flick.",1273536000,10,711,4.819672131147541
3555211,1,B001EJ1WQW,"The scary thing about this film is that so many people will take it serously.  Much of the ""science"" is pure techno-babble, on par with the ""science"" of a typical Star Trek episode.  Do a little research of your own and you'll find that most of the ""researchers"" quoted in the film make no claims to following scientific methodology.  NONE of the fantastic effects of water described in the film can be predictably replicated.  Most of the ""historical accounts"" in the film are pure falshoods.

A nice piece of fiction, but PLEASE don't believe a word of it!",1263772800,9,558,4.653061224489796
3555212,3,B001EJ1WQW,"As a water scientist (aquatic toxicologist), I am more interested in stripping the waters naked, and dressing those same waters with the elements and minerals we need for better health; making sure that the waters are distributed from where there is an abundance, to where we have too little. Water is the sponsor of life, and, if left fettered with some of the products of our industrial life and/or disease, it is the sponsor of death, even to the extent of an E.L.E. (extinction level event for those who didn't see the movie called Deep Impact).
But, even granting any truth to the claims that water can be affected by mind, until we learn how to use this to enhance our chances of survival in a direct causitive manner, I would say any such observations are useless; amusing, but useless.
My plea would be for us to handle those blatant problems we face with water, and then get into other aspects like mind control and spiritual manipulations, after we have rid the earth of our more obvious chemical and physical problems with the stuff we call Water...The Great Mystery. What is no mystery is that taking in water that has the wrong stuff in it can hurt all of us, especially our children. Let's clean it up first, and then play parlor games.

 It is absolutely amazing how much water retains & how our words, actions, & even things as minute as thoughts have such an overwhelming effect on water & how that transfers into our overall health & being!
 I hope many others get this message that the movie & others like it put out & choose to preserve this powerful natural resource.
 W/o it we die.  Co-existence is what it's all about.  If we grasp that concept & utilize it then things can begin to improve.  Not living off of water but rather living WITH water.

While the film interviews scientists, the level of information it provides seems ""dumbed down"".  Part of that may be that the film looks like it was made in Russia and the translation may not be capturing the message fully.
