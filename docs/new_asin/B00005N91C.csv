7946506,3,B00005N91C,"Why doesn't Amazon post what SPOKEN LANGUAGE each movie comes with and not just what captions (subtitles for those of us who prefer that word for what it should mean for movies)?!?!  Only by looking through many customer reviews MIGHT I ever learn its in Spanish or German, etc.  and just since I'll likely get crap ipby those who seem to have waaaaaaay too much time to spent trying to debunk my personal point of view about motives or anything else...This is still the USA which as far as I know that still doesn't mean United Spanish of America although with everything that already has happened to accommodate people who should learn the language of the country spoken in any country they live in, while certainly maintaining their heritage if it's that important to them.

And also for those who have no clue about the truth of American history...nearly every person of family that emigrated from another country felt did their best to learn the language of this country. And for those who were older and wanted to speak the native tongue of the country they came from, they moved into sections like Little Italy, Chinatown, Hell's Kitchen (that was for the Irish, for those who didn't know). The other countries from Europe and the Far East which was the main places new legal immigrants hail from had no places as described previously.  They had the toughest time and typically had to rely on their children to learn English, or take classes as the pledge of allegiance must be spoken in this countries primary language.

And as it relates to the problem with AMAZON not putting the spoken language of each movie...how can at most by the 2010 national census shows that Spanish speaking heritage people are only about 25% of the countries population and the leaders of this country for a few decades now have added Spanish to driving test, a phone button to push for English when calling most big company tech service and tons of food products like a box of cereal in Spanish.

When will this end and become like every other country that has ENGLISH as an additonal language, not because they have changed their own countries national languge and conceded so much for so few as this countries leaders have forced as politically correct.  It's politically inconsiderate to those of us who give a damn, and are sick of what happened.  AMAZON, PLEASE....add that line in a movies description for those of us who don't speak Spanish, and hate reading subtitles!! Now feel free to bash me, or tell AMAZON to remove my review.  Some will see it and agree with me that everything starts with just one or a few. Just like how this country was founded.",1418688000,3,2650,4.693965517241379
7946507,5,B00005N91C,Anything with Salma in it is worth watching. It's interesting to watch her mature in her acting and become more than a pin-up - She does exceptional work on and off the screen. Salud Salma!!,1289520000,3,190,4.457142857142857
7946508,3,B00005N91C,"I think Salma is pretty consistent with her acting. Her character is similar in Fools Rush in. This movie is a bit odd, and a bit different. It's pretty high quality for a ""foreign film"" and you can watch dubbed versions in spanish, english and french. There is also a good subtitle selection. The ending was very predictable, but Salma's role came in later. An ok flick, have seen better.",1094428800,3,389,4.571428571428571
7946509,3,B00005N91C,"Selma is a bit older now and plays more mature roles. This movie is one of her earlier movies, so you get to see her as a hot young fox. This is a very nice date movie.
Bad points: The first 15 minutes is a little boreing.",1072915200,4,222,3.74468085106383
7946510,5,B00005N91C,"Wow, an amazing performance by he lovely and talented Salma Hayek. The movie is wonderfully directed and the plot is magnificent. America needs to open its eyes and explore more great foreign films like this one by director Anotonio Cuadri.",1014508800,7,240,5.025
7946511,4,B00005N91C,"Summary:  The story is about a simple man who thought life has been unkind to him & therefore decided to end his sufferings.  No, it is not a tragic story, but a funny one.  What should have been sad & tragic were smoothly passed out by the Director & the characters with light humor.
Martin, the main character, was so bent on killing himself that he decided to jump off a bridge only to be derailed by a stranger's offer which he couldn't resist.  The deal was for him to loan from the Mafia $100,000,000 to be paid at the end of a week.  & since he has no means of paying it, the Mafia would then kill him -- which shouldn't be a problem since he wanted to die in the first place.  So, Martin thought, he might as well enjoy a week's life as a millionaire & end it with a bang.
But as expected, there would be a twist in the plot, which would make him change his mind & want to live longer.  Tension builds on Martin who finally finds love & happiness while the weekend nears & the debt has to be paid.  Of course, the ending could be expected to be favorable to complement the rest of the plot.
Lesson:  Martin personifies all men who are not happy with their lives & who think that ending one's life is the best way to escape reality & hardships.  He, Lola & others like them also think that being rich is the answer to all their problems.  Just to learn a few lessons along the way.. (1)  not to hate life...(2)  that money isn't everything & ... (3)that what really makes the world go around is love & happiness.",1001289600,19,1519,4.143344709897611
