8393913,3,B003BUAOQ6,"The DVD under review introduces viewers to both the secular and religious art of Europe between the 15th and 18th centuries C.E.  Superb photography, erudite comments, and non-intrusive background music allow viewers to grasp the metamorphosis of art in different media during the Renaissance, Baroque, and Rococo periods.  Unfortunately, the three-part series shows its age because it was originally released in both 1990 and 1991.  The quality of the image is at times sub-optimal.  This series should be shot again because of the importance of high definition in visualizing art.",1277078400,14,582,5.433333333333334
