ONE NIGHT STAND 2006
The previous year about about a reunion, this year was about establishing the third WWE brand. You saw elements & some talents from the original ECW mixed in with what what titled ""The New Breed Unleashed"" as there were some established WWE superstars who were aligned with ECW as well.

DECEMBER TO DISMEMBER 2006:
Between 1997-2001, if you would have told any wrestling fan on the planet that a PPV with the initials ""ECW"" attached to it would result in being one of the worst PPV's of all time, we would have thought you were nuts. Even after the One Night Stand PPV's, most people would have still thought you were nuts but man how times have changed.  I'll get right to the point in that this show was a 3 hour edition of Shotgun Saturday Night in which it was dry & heavily one-sided, all these matches were thrown together at the last minute, they did a last minute bait & switch on the main event, the PPV ended over a half hour early, and the one character who was used on all the poster & promos for the event (Sandman) only made a cameo appearance at the end of a match with the only thing that will keep you from skipping a majority of the PPV being the crowd that wasn't going to take any crap & let WWE know about it from their reaction to when they replaced Sabu with Hardcore Holly in the Elimination Chamber Match to the order of eliminations in that match.  The DVD extras include post-Chamber match comments from all the participants along with Big Show vs. Bobby Lashley for the ECW Championship on Sci-Fi later in the week.

Matches include the Extreme Elimination Chamber Match with ECW Champion Big Show vs. Bobby Lashley vs. Rob Van Dam vs. C.M. Punk vs. Test vs. Hardcore Holly, The Hardys vs. MNM, Balls Mahoney vs. Matt Striker in a ""Striker Rules"" match, F.B.I. vs. Elijah Burke & Sylvester Terkay, Tommy Dreamer vs. Davari w/Great Khali, and Kevin Thorn & Aerial vs. Mike Knox & Kelly Kelly.

The Rise & Fall Of ECW was one of the greatest presentations ever put out by WWE Home Video & was the one thing that started the resurrection of ECW, Rob Van Dam's ""One Of A Kind"" was a showcase of RVD's evolution from Robbie V to ""Mr. Monday Night"" to a WWE superstar through high quality career matches, Bloodsport was a collection of ECW matches that would satisfy any ECW fan, and the two One Night Stand PPV's were quality events from top to bottom, Extreme Rules had a good showcasing of both the original & new ECW, and the only true downfall of this set was that horrible December To Dismember PPV so I already expect fans of ECW to already have a majority of these DVD sets in their collections but I would recommend this for the newer fans of the promotion who wants to get their hands on everything ECW-themed that WWE had released (not including the recent ECW: Unreleased sets) but only at a reasonable price seeing how a majority of these sets have been out for years dating back to almost a decade to five years ago & you can probably get all of these individually at a cheaper price.",1369785600,,13988,4.7146950470732705
8204893,3,B000SAAPMA,"I would not recommend this for true ECW fans due to the December to Dismember PPV sucking, but I would recommend you get the other videos at the regular price. I have all of the ones but the Van Dam video and D2D. I've seen the Van Dam video and it's pretty sweet so I really think if you are a WWE fan and you want the true feeling of ECW, it's the way to go.",1190073600,,360,3.75
