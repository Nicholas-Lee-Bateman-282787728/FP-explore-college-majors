1828582,4,B000087F7F,"cartoons used to be escapost fun for kids. they ruled the saturday morning timeslots,a foreign concept today.
superfriends, in my opinion everything a cartoon should be. colourful fun and full of familiar characters all kids already know. it was like watching your own action figures come to life and fight on screen. true the stories were written for 10 year olds by 10 year olds it sometimes seemed. (what kid believed you could breath in space with a fishbowl on your head,or its o.k to fly towards the sun and not melt.)but there was, and this is very important to the popularity and the endearment to its fans, is its innocence. like the dc silverage comics out at the time it was mindless fun. the acting in my opinion stands head and shoulders above the drab bored voices of actors obviously on valium as they read their lines in cartoons now adays (except of mark hammils joker). look at jla now to see a difference in solomon grundy then and now. the voices just added to the drama and excitement of the show. black mantas voice was just the coolest. buy this dvd to return to those younger years where sat mornings were your time. where the only thing you escaped from was school on monday.",1046908800,8,1200,4.560185185185185
1828583,3,B000087F7F,"These previous review comments help me explain why I liked the Marvin and Wendy versions so much better:
""I always get a chuckle out of these because it seems the LOD can do ANYTHING! They can travel through time, space, send our fearless heroes into famous storybooks...whatever makes an entertaining story. It's always a hoot watching Wonder Woman float in space wearing her bustier, hot pants, boots and a plastic bubble on her head with no breathing apparatus on her back.""
The original stories with Marvin and Wendy were more grounded in a plausibly contained world.  Each week the status quo was interrupted by a scientist who appeared to break some law of physics or an alien coming to Earth and causing trouble, but usually the  status quo was restored by the end of the show (the process that turns gold into other metals turns out to be unstable, the asteroid mining operation has to be shut down because the particles are proven too dangerous on Earth, the alien's problems are solved and they leave, Superman seals off the subterranean ""lost world"" from human contact forever).
It seems like in many of the versions of the Superfriends that followed, even Challenge of the Super Friends, they don't set up the breaking of the laws of physics with a ""new discovery,"" they just assume they've been broken all along: an episode begins with the Legion of Doom using a time travel machine--no explanation given as to how they got it, making it seem they always had it; if they always had it, they would have destroyed everything a long time ago.  The Legion of Doom has teleportation devices all over the place, yet none of the Super Friends seem to be able to get their hands on one or figure out how they work. Episodes begin with them making deals with aliens as if this were an everyday event.  I just saw one last night where they were putting the Super Friends into a fairy tale book--no explanation as to how they got it (maybe it was cut?).  Too many stories seemed to use magic, like the fairy tale book and the Swamp Witch.  I know Mxlplik (not even going to try to spell it) was magic, but magic didn't seem as pervasive in the original comics as it became in the later Super Friends.  If the Legion of Doom truly has the fantastic powers over time and space that the episodes portray, the Super Friends don't really have a chance and the Legion would have destroyed everything by now.  Sure, the Super Friends have some fantastic powers but they're not bent on destroying or conquering everything.  It's just not logically consistent to have the Legion be so powerful and yet the Earth is still intact and unconquered.
Now, the Super Powers version weren't as bad because they seemed to return to more plausible stories.  At least Darkseid had to come from another dimension where our physical laws didn't necessarily apply.  An episode opens with the Penguin actually in jail instead of flying around in a time machine.  The villains have more LIMITS.
The originals with Marvin and Wendy had plenty of gaffes and mistakes, poor animation, etc., but they seemed more science-based.  They didn't have humans operating in space without suits--only Superman.  They didn't have ANY magic episodes.  When an alien came to Earth it was a big deal requiring the attention of the government and the Super Friends, not a ho-hum every day event.  Best of all--no time travel episodes at all.
I'll probably buy this DVD though--it's still bound to be interesting.",1045785600,3,3471,4.7218543046357615
1828584,5,B000087F7F,"I'm all over this like a fly on...well, you know.
This is my favorite of the early days of the Superfriends.  No Wendy and Marvin, no silly ""don't talk to strangers"" messages from Wonder Woman...just flat out rock 'em - sock 'em fun when the Superfriends meet their evil equals from the Legion of Doom.
I always get a chuckle out of these because it seems the LOD can do ANYTHING!  They can travel through time, space, send our fearless heroes into famous storybooks...whatever makes an entertaining story.  It's always a hoot watching Wonder Woman float in space wearing her bustier, hot pants, boots and a plastic bubble on her head with no breathing apparatus on her back.

1828585,5,B000087F7F,"Considered the best in the series, Challenge of the Superfriends features an all star line up of DC Comics flagship and popular characters: Superman, Batman and Robin, Green Lantern, Flash, Wonder Woman, Aquaman.  They are joined by Samurai, Apache Chief and Black Vulcan.
The vilains: The Legion of Doom, headed by Lex Luthor.  All of the major bad guys are here, from Bizzaro, Black Manta, Cheeta, Giganta, Riddler, Toyman, Gorilla Grood, Solomon Grundy, Scarecrow, and Brainiac!
Expect nothing short of a Royal Rumble when these two teams collide against each other.  This is the best interpretation of the DC comic books into animation.  No other series involving Super Heroes has ever matched it.  Hanna Barbara did outstanding work on this series, possibly one of their best on television.  The voice talents were also good.
A lot of creative forces, who are now legends in the comic book business, were involved in the series: Alex Toth, who did an outstanding job designing the characters for animation. DC staff, such as artist Carmine Infantino, writer and afficinado E. Nelson Bridwell and of course, editor Julius Schwartz (who was a major contributor to the Silver Age of Comics with his revamping of the Flash and Green Lantern)
This DVD has been long awaited by fans.  Never before has there been an official video release of the series.  A must have for anyone who is interested in Super Heroes.  (WB, release the entire series on DVD, I have my dollars ready :)",1042761600,30,1478,4.92741935483871

ive watched the new Justice League but it seems to have nothing but drama.
they seem to fight against each other more than they fight against the enemy.
and then they have a new green lantern John Stewart whos only goal seems to be is to find someone to shack up with! the old superfriends were simple yes but they worked well together and showed you what team work was all about.
iam not afraid to let my children watch these old superfriends on dvd. because i know they aren't going to be poluted with a bunch of stuff that a 5 yr old, and a 2 yr old, and a 11 month should not be seeing at there age.

1828596,5,B000087F7F,"First segment

The plots for this series were, at the time of its initial airing, arguably the best effort to portray comic book heroes in animated television shorts. As originally aired, this season consisted of two half-hour segments. The first of these was an adventure with Superman, Batman and Robin, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and the Wonder Twins, similar to those that had aired the previous season in The All-New Super Friends Hour.[1] Thanks to these episodes being shown using the opening credits of the All-New Super Friends Hour in syndication[2], the second segment along being used with the Challenge of Super Friends opening, and confused references to the show[3] it is often mistakenly believed that the first and second segments were two separate shows.
Challenge of the Super Friends is an American animated television series about a team of superheroes which ran from September 9, 1978, to December 23, 1978, on ABC. The complete series (16 episodes) was produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions for Warner Bros. Television and is based on the Justice League and associated comic book characters published by DC Comics. It was the third series of Super Friends cartoons, following the original Super Friends in 1973 and The All-New Super Friends Hour in 1977. It continues to air on Boomerang in the United States Second segment

The second segment of this season featured the Legion of Doom, a team of thirteen recurring foes, the Super Friends' worst enemies. Every episode would feature battles between the thirteen supervillains of the Legion of Doom and the eleven superheroes of the Justice League of America. The Legion of Doom dwelled in a murky swamp and launched their attacks for global conquest from a sinister looking, swamp-based, mechanical, flying headquarters, called the Hall of Doom (which also resembled Darth Vader's helmet) as a suitable contrast with the Super Friends' gleaming Hall of Justice.
[edit] Production background
[edit] Narration, music and character designs

Challenge of the Super Friends was narrated by William Woodson. The show's main theme and original music was composed and arranged by musical director Hoyt Curtin. The music supervisors were Paul DeKorte and Fred Werner. Character designs for this particular Super Friends series were done by Andre LeBlanc, while color key was arranged by Nancy Massie.
[edit] Team composition experimentation

Hanna-Barbera's writers experimented with team composition as well. Challenge of the Super Friends added The Flash (Barry Allen), Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), and Hawkman (Katar Hol) who were members of the Justice League of America, as well as several new characters: Black Vulcan (who was based on the DC Comics character Black Lightning), Apache Chief, and Samurai. These characters were created to add racial and cultural diversity to the show.",1280361600,,2851,5.328888888888889

I will review the disc itself when I buy it, but for now I just have one question which hopefully people will take notice of when they do buy it.  This is a compilation of ""Challenge of The Superfriends"" episodes, who is the dumb cluck who designed the dvd case with the ""Super Friends"" logo of the first incarnation of the series which came out in 1973?  In my opinion that will confuse customers who buy it here on Amazon.com or anywhere for that matter.  Someone should write to the manufacturer, and tell them to ease up on the red dew (I'm being nice here, could have said something stronger) when they design the package for the next disc.",1060387200,4,804,4.524137931034483

1828601,5,B000087F7F,"This DVD brings back the memories of being a kid, and enjoying the best of the years of Superfriends cartoons --- the ""Challenge of the Superfriends"" where they are pitted against the Legion of Doom.  Fantastic voices, cheesy (but fun) storylines ... this DVD is pure fun.  Its light fare when compared to the 90's Batman Animated series but still provides a good time.",1053475200,3,369,4.75
1828602,2,B000087F7F,"As with so many nostalgic chunks of youth of the 70s, SUPER FRIENDS holds up better when it's just a rose-colored memory; The actual cartoon is mostly just painful to watch, unless you enjoy counting the many bloopers (Green Lantern with three arms; fingernails on gloves; Wonder Woman with six fingers; Batman with a bat logo on his cape; disappearing and reappearing utility belts) or laughing at the many examples of lazy cartoon logic that were rampant in adventure cartoons of this era (Ancient Romans speaking English; highways that lead right off of a cliff; mortal humans breathing in space).
The introductions by story editor Jeffrey Scott are interesting, but too short. A few very quick flashes of model sheets remind us of how poor Alex Toth (the brilliant cartoonist / storyboard artist / character designer who put more effort into his work than anyone else at H-B ever did) is once again given the shaft with the bad redrawing of his Super Friends portrait that graces this cover.
This is your typical weak Warner Home Video compilation that is obviously geared towards children rather than collectors.
Which is fine if you have children; Certainly, CHALLENGE OF THE SUPER FRIENDS is a fine thing to sit down and watch with your kids (you can test how smart they are by seeing what ridiculous plot points they question), but if it's actual semi-adult superhero entertainment you want, stick with the Bruce Timm cartoons of the 90s (even if those DVDs are wanting as well).",1051488000,11,1487,4.881422924901186
1828603,5,B000087F7F,"The ""Challenge"" run of Superfriends is the most popular incarnation of the series (and second in accuracy to the comics only to the seasons tied into the Super Powers toyline), and it's easy to see why. The most popular DC heroes (Superman, Batman, Robin, the Flash, Wonder Woman, Hawkman, Aquaman, and Green Latern, plus newbies Black Vulcan, Apache Chief, and Samurai) versus some of the biggest villains from the comics-Bizarro, Giganta, Captain Cold, Solomon Grundy, Grodd, Sinestro, Brainiac, the Scarecrow, the Riddler, Black Manta, Cheetah, the Toyman, and Lex Luthor in a number of broad (and sometimes silly) adventures.
The episodes themselves look excellent, not like the fuzzy and faded prints that currently air on Cartoon Network. (Nitpickers will also notice that the byline identifying Hanna-Barbera as ""A Taft Company"" in the end credits isn't blacked out like it is on TV.) The audio is the standard mono track, which continues to serve the series well.
The special features are extremely slim, with a game, bios of the Legion of Doom (with voice overs about the Legion, in addition to video clips of each villain beating down on the Superfriends), and intros by story editor Jeffrey Scott. Of course, this has been fairly standard of Warner's DC-related DVDs, so no one should be all that surprised.
