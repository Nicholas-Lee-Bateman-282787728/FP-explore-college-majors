3789302,5,B001TEPZ06,"Patty Greer's ""2012 We're Already In It"" is the 3rd movie that I have watched on the subject of 2012.  It it by far the best and most enjoyable. Her approach is both very professional and very believable.  I have ordered her newest video ""The Wake Up Call Anybody Listening"" and can't wait to watch it.",1248566400,,302,4.375
3789303,5,B001TEPZ06,"Patty Greer's latest award winning documentary  ""2012: We're Already In It"" provides a critical and timely wake up call that is both positive and unforgettable. This is a brilliant award winning film that engages the
viewer and provides guidance and understanding about where we are, and where we're headed on the way to 2012. Patty Greer blends her work on the phenomena of Crop Circles and uses her investigative expertise
to document current events that offer hope over the gloom and doom associated with 2012. This is a ""Keeper"" worthy of being featured on Discovery, The History Channel, and shown in local theaters nationwide.

3789304,5,B001TEPZ06,"Patty Greer has done it again.  Her DVD on Crop Circles (A Wake Up Call Is Anybody Listening?) was 1st rate & this DVD opens up the Mayan Calendar with many insights & illuminations.

A worthwhile purchase.

I am looking forward to what she does in the future!!!!!",1246233600,,264,4.458333333333333
3789305,5,B001TEPZ06,"Many filmmakers try to capture the essence of the crop circle phenomena, and usually with mixed results.  This is where Patty Greer breaks leaps ahead of the pack and takes the far lead, with her beautifully crafted documentary, 2012.  She not only documents the phenomena, she also captures the loving essence of the beings who no doubt create them, as well as their enlightened messages to us.-Marshall Masters, Cut to the Chase Internet Radio",1245024000,2,445,5.0
8341128,5,B001TEPZ06,"I really enjoyed watching this and found it to be very thought provoking. The shots of the orbs of light, the UFO's, the crop circles, and the English countryside were very clear and beautiful and some of the things those interviewed had to say I found to be very interesting. Sincerity and awareness shines through as they speak. This is one documentary that I have watched many times over and still found to be fascinating and enjoyable every time I have viewed it. I even love the music. Incredibly Fabulous.",1327708800,2,511,4.688888888888889
8341129,5,B001TEPZ06,"This was a very good documentary.  It is about 90 minutes long and is really broken up into two halves.  The first half  is more on 2012 and the end of the Mayan calendar.  The second half deals mainly with crop circles.  There is quite an array of people interviewed, from Spiritual leaders, hypnotherapist, a financial expert commenting on market manipulation and a handful of other intriguing interviews.  The general theme is to not be in fear and to realize that WE are writing our future.

Being technical minded I found some of the interviews interesting but I must say I REALLY enjoyed many of the segments with Patricia Cori.  She is a spiritual leader and her sincerity and soul come through nicely in this documentary.  There are some nice graphics blended into this film and some great music of Patty's.  I was torn giving this 4 or 5 stars.  For me it's a 4 1/2 star documentary but I did not want to deter anyone who may be on the fence about seeing this.  EVERYONE should see this movie, whether they will believe in anything presented or not!",1302480000,3,1058,4.5396825396825395
8341130,5,B001TEPZ06,"I really enjoyed this documentary.  Patty Greer does such a beautiful job.  The interviews are enlightening, to say the least, and, in my opinion, information that needs to be presented.  So refreshing to look at and ponder, rather than the doom and gloom predictions that leave people in fear.  Thank you, Patty, so much, for your contribution and the hard work that you put into this wonderful film.",1271721600,2,401,4.852941176470588
8341131,5,B001TEPZ06,"A very balanced & informative film, refreshing and enlightening contrast to the Hollywood Doomsday approach to this subject. Excellent cinematography and riveting interviews. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and highly recommend it.",1269475200,2,230,6.21875
8341132,5,B001TEPZ06,"Patty has orchestrated another great piece of work. It definitely will leave you with much ""food for thought"". An assembly of deep thinkers and visionaries share their insights and reflections on the meaning of 2012, while acknowledging that the script is continually being written in our minds and hearts. What I like best is that the film provides commentary on the full spectrum of our ""earthly journey"" from the socio-political-economic perspective to the lofty spiritual awakening. No wonder it's an award winner. A must see film!",1258934400,2,535,5.232558139534884
8341133,3,B001TEPZ06,"The DVD was ""OK"". I bought this particluar documentary because, for one, the reviews were mostly very good plus it said it won an award so that convinced me. I have to say that the ""Intro"" almost made me turn it off immediately. For lack of better words the intro was over-the-top-cheezy. I am into New-Age material but it came across amateurish with its almost whispering voices with bad new age music.  My wife and I decided to give it a chance and I will say it got better from there because of SOME of the speakers.
Some of the speakers came across well and others just seemed to ramble and get lost in their own thoughts and mixed up their words which just confuses the viewer.
There were some major conspiracy theories thrown in but I found them to be interesting but sometimes laughable.
The crop circle segments were good.
Dont expect much background about the Mayans. Even though this is about 2012, there is very little to be learned about the Mayan civilization.",1254787200,6,973,4.56

8341135,5,B001TEPZ06,"Quite simply, Patty Greer has offered a gift to humanity. Open your heart and be prepared to receive the gift. This is a masterful piece of work, beautifully filmed and scored with a divine message that comes straight from the heart.

2012 is beginning to take on a life of its own (i.e., just another commodity) as so much has been written and produced on the subject lately. Unfortunately, much of it completely misses the mark and only adds to the confusion and misinformation. This is where 2012 We're Already In It really stands out. This is an exceptional film, one which delivers the message about the transformation that is taking place -- a transformation of consciousness. Hands down, this is one of the best films on the subject that I have seen. The individuals that were chosen for the interview segments were superb and their perspectives were illuminating. More importantly, it was delightful to see some fresh perspectives.

Purchase this DVD, watch it, share it with your friends and spread the message. You won't be disappointed. In fact, you will be inspired. As the filmmaker says: Stop, Look...and Listen. Yes, WE ARE already in it! I'm so grateful, and thank you Patty for the inspiration!",1252108800,2,1211,4.87378640776699
8341136,1,B001TEPZ06,"Too bad I can't get my money back on this one! ""2012 We're already in it"" is accompanied by elevator music (not jazz, or lounge-but a new breed sleepy-time music), very soft spoken talking, and 'good things' about 2012 (although one researcher says many people will go crazy-and that doesn't sound good to me).  My thing is you cannot go over one-half of 2012..you gotta cover all its aspects.  If you don't that leads to a misinformed audience.  Most of the 'reseachers' are unheard of even in the metaphysical community (sorry Crop Circle community BLT is ONLY MENTIONED). I bought it because the trailer (which was better than the documentary!) and I was going to buy more of Patti's documentaries IF this one turned out good but no....Go find your 2012 documentaries elsewhere.  The soundtrack will make you sleepy alone-if the presentation doesn't do it. Mine for 10 bucks (or should I recycle it?).",1251158400,2,904,4.85064935064935
8341137,5,B001TEPZ06,"Review of ""2012 We're Already In It"", by Patty Greer
Written by:  Lance B. White (Zany Mystic)

Patty Greer is a filmmaker, who kindly sent me her new movie for viewing, prior to our upcoming radio show on September 5th, 2009.  I must admit that it totally blew me away.  I've seen several movies about the subject, from 2012 to 2013, peopled with the usual ""experts"".  This amazing film is entirely FRESH!

There are no ""known experts"", though I had heard of Joeff Stray, but people who were ""in the know"" contributed from the heart.  It was also an uncompromising look at the ""dark agendas"" of the world's elite, (shadow government) which eloquently and briefly touches upon the subjects of 9/11, chemtrails, poisons in farming and much more.  It is done so perfectly that it creates a viewpoint from the most balanced and higher perspective.

Included is material on crop circles, as well as the government following them...  one presenter states, ""Yes, it's probably true that the Illuminati and Masons have ""ancient secrets"", but they can't have them all, or they wouldn't be following what WE'RE doing so closely!  He continues...  ""We EACH have our OWN secret, and when we COME TOGETHER AS ONE, sharing what we know, it creates a much larger story than any can imagine...""

The filming is beautiful, if not awesome.  There was coverage of ORBS; one of the presenters is a psychologist of 28 years, an abductee, who takes her clients back to THEIR abductions, and asks if what they are seeing is ""real"" or a dream... the unified response: ""It is unquestionably real!"".  She has thousands of stories of little large eyed people doing studies, etc., which we are just beginning to be able to ""hear"", even though the documentation now far outweighs the ""skeptics"".

There is an unflinching look at the FACT of UFOs and the ""visitors"", speculating that we were most likely ""engineered"", at the least ""seeded"" from the very beginning, with upgrades at certain stages of our ""evolution"".  Overwhelming evidence tells us that right now, at this time, we are in another ""accelerated journey"" of vast proportions which requires an ability to trust our own inner guidance systems, regardless of ""labels"" or affiliations.  Intuition, telepathy, our higher senses are returning.  We are awakening and re-membering our Selves, as Georges I. Gurdjieff and P. D. Ouspensky taught through ""esoteric schools"".

The time is past in this accelerated journey of the soul, for ""Gurus"", Teachers or ""leaders"", unless that is one's path to follow; and each path is uniquely ""right"" for each one of us.  The most important choice we can make is already made:  are we part of the old false paradigm that is crumbling before our eyes, or have we always been motivated through our hearts, lovingly connected to all spirit, nature, ""God"", Source, Higher Power, The Infinite Light... choose the label which feels best, but choose which ""side of the street"" feels right.

Is it joining in the last grab for some piece of the ""money pie"", which the elite have been milking long before we were born, and who have tilted the scales in their direction, at the expense of humanity, life, compassion and love?  This is the fork in the road spoken of by all prophecies and indigenous shamans... the ""Y"" in the road we all face.

This film is wise, intelligent and uncompromising.  The material on the Mayan Calendar and 2012 was excellent,  emphasizing we are IN IT NOW, as many know!  It also feels hopeful, in that we are going to make it this time, and not ""blow it"" (or blow ourselves up!) prior to finally transforming and transcending the dark aspects of our own Self.  Included is thoughtful speculation about what MAY happen around 2012, and the possibility that large numbers MIGHT ""depart"" some time prior... most of the comments have to do with our awakening to remember Who we are, in our finally returning to full consciousness, to ""HOME"", and our dearest soul families who await this grand celebration!

I've watched it twice, and plan on sharing it here, in my home, with friends many more times.  This is by far the BEST movie yet on this subject.  I look forward to whatever Patty is coming up with next, as it will certainly be worth experiencing.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie!
