8764680,5,B01H4F4VGC,"BANNING has been a favorite movie of mine since I accidently heard the theme song, Quincy Jones' and Bob Russell's, THROUGH THE EYES OF LOVE start it when it showed on TV some years ago. The song had been a favorite of mine and I had heard it many times in many places, never knowing it came from a movie. Since I am a fan of Robert Wagner, Anjanette Comer and Jill St. John, I decided to watch the movie. I found I really enjoyed it! And to find Gene Hackman in one of his early roles was an extra treat. Susan Clark, as Howard St. John's daughter, does a fine job in one of her early film appearances as well. The story is neatly written and Mike Kellin, one of the great character actors, gives the movie the right amount of menace and Guy Stockwell handles the underhanded, opportunistic dealings of social climbing with aplomb.. I don't know why this movie is not more popular or well known, at least to TV audiences.",1519257600,,922,4.304597701149425
