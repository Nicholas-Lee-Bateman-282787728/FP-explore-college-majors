7986804,1,B00008RH0N,"Another one of those movies you wish you didn't buy. But for the price what could you expect? Sometimes I get good movies I only pay a couple bucks for. This is definitely not one of them. I wouldn't buy this movie for 50 cents. But if you want to waste your time and be disappointed, buy it. I will say that the 18 bronze girls wasn't as bad as the 18 golden destroyers. But both are pretty bad.",1301788800,,396,4.025316455696203
7986805,1,B00008RH0N,"I'm an avid kung-fu collector who owns over 300 old school kung fu DVDs, and I could not even bring myself to watch either of these movies till the end. I own all three of the 18 Bronzemen movies so I thought I would like this. It was so bad that I didn't even want to return it or sell it on Amazon where someone else might buy it. I threw it in the garbage where it belongs. Picture quality is horrible, sound is dubbed badly, and the plot and action scenes are the worst I've ever seen. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! Any Shaw Brothers film is 1000 times better.",1301529600,,557,4.027027027027027
