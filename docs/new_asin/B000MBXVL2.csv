8167733,5,B000MBXVL2,"Anyone interested in the black bear will enjoy this documentary. It was made back in the early 90's but the info is all good. Pa. did a big study on the black bear and much of what they learned is in this video. Not a how to hunt or much information on actually hunting bears, so if that is what you want look at something else. This is really about bear biology more than anything, but covers a lot of other info regarding bears. If you want to learn more about the black bear this is a must see.",1376352000,,497,4.03030303030303
