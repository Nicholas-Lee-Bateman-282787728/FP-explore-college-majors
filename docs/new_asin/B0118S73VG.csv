7329905,1,B0118S73VG,"I'm a Huge fan of the original Poltergeist, everything about the 1982 film i love
the Acting Great performances all round by Craig T nelson, Jobeth williams and Heather O'rourke
the special visual effects which was amazingly Groundbreaking effects back in 1981
and in my opinion the effects still stand up today
an excellent written screenplay and Tobe Hooper's directing of course

when this remake was being released in Cinemas i thought to go check it out, bad Decision what a waste of time
i left about half way through the film alot of things i was not impressed by this remake
the Acting , the screenplay, the Directing
this new remake is only suitable for one audience, a new Generation of fans mainly teenagers/young Adults who don't know any better
for hardcore fans like myself, the film is an insult
and is Distributed by 20th century fox, not warner bros the original 1982 version is by Warner bros
who is still yet to give the old classic a special edition treatment with new interviews of the remaining cast & spielberg
the 1982 version has only had 1 blu-ray release back 6 years ago now
and had 2 new featurettes that were mainly about Poltergeists in General and channeling spirits
the featurettes had no interviews with Tobe Hooper or steven spielberg about the making of the film at all
so i found the new extras pointless actually
5 stars for the original 1982 version
1 star for this remake waste of time don't bother buying it
especially if you're a big fan of the original, you will be Disgusted with this remake",1438560000,12,1535,4.643382352941177

7329907,2,B0118S73VG,"When the Bowen family moves into a welcoming house in the suburbs, they think its the start of a new chapter in their lives. Eric (Sam Rockwell) is on a mission to find a new job and his wife Amy (Rosemarie Dewitt) is a stay-at-home mom, who also happens to be a writer. Eric and Amy along with their three children love the house immediately. But it isn't too long before their paranoid young son Griffin (Kyle Catlett) begins to develop a fear of the house that his parents brush off, thinking its just another one of his fears. But it isn't until their youngest daughter Maddie (Kennedy Clements) starts talking to people that aren't there and starts making contact with presences through the television, and from her closet. When Maddie is taken by these forces, the family enlists the help of Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris), a well-known paranormal investigator with his own t.v. show, to help get her back. They learn that what they are dealing with is no ordinary haunting, and that Maddies life is in danger.

Poltergeist is a remake of the 1982 horror film of the same name directed by Tobe Hooper. I admit I am not too crazy about the original film. It had some very good aspects to it, but in the end it didn't really cut it for me. For me I felt it dragged on a bit too much and lacked any real tension or scares. So going into the remake I wasn't sure how the result would end up being. During the first portion of the film, I found myself thinking it was going to be a borefest. However, it isn't until the events begin that it caught my attention. However, unlike the original which took its sweet time to build up, this one jumps into the events much too quickly. The big scene in which the eldest daughter is babysitting, she and the other two children are attacked, was fairly intense and well-constructed, but at the same time, it felt like they were trying to cram too much activity into one scene. The taking of Maddie, not going to lie was rather chilling unlike the scene in the original.

When Harris character is brought in, its also when it begins to slow down and drag on a bit before it picks back up. That said, when it comes to the final act, it definitely makes up for the slower moments. The final act is actually pretty intense and it also put a new twist into the story making it different from the original, but not much. The final scene involving the poltergeist and the attack on the family actually gave me the chills and made my jaw drop a little bit. Throughout the film I can tell the writers wanted to stay really faithful to the original film and capture some of its key moments, but at the same time wanted to make it fresh. As a result it feels like many things are so crammed together it prevents the viewer from really getting to know the characters. We don't really know the family too well, on the outside they seem like a typical family, but at the same time, they are certain things revealed about them that they don't go into much detail with. For example, why Rockwell can afford an expensive house when hes laid off, and the wife hasn't been doing much, or really how bad the sons phobias are. That is one thing the original definitely had on this is that we really get to know the family before things happen. There is also the factor of the Carol Anne character (this time Maddie), this version focuses way to much on the son and not enough on Maddie who is supposed to be the central character. We also don't get to know the investigator, just brief snippets of his past.

As far as the acting goes, the cast does a fine job with what they have. Kennedy Clements brings cuteness and innocence to the role of Maddie, but takes a bit a too over-the-top, whereas Heather ORourke in the original film played Carol Anne with great poise. Rockwell and Dewitt are likable as the parents, but they don't really shine much. Rockwell only stands out a bit more because of his humorous moments. If anyone in the cast did well with their role its Jared Harris, but sadly he doesnt get a whole lot to work with either, I wanted to see more of his character. As far as effects go, they weren't that bad. They didn't get too carried away with the CGI, but used just enough to satisfy the audience and bring on this paranormal world. Although the tree attack scene was MASSIVELY disappointing compared to the original and came of as not scary at all. Another weak aspect is that there was a lot of forced and unnecessary humor that detached me from the mood it was trying to accomplish in those scenes.

With all of this being said, I thought this remake wasn't bad for what it was. It certainly did everything it could to capture the original film, but with a somewhat lengthier script, they would have accomplished this much more than they did. Its one that will definitely divide horror audiences. It doesnt use any cheap scares, but it lacks the atmosphere the original had, as well as the character development. However, the finale packs a much stronger punch and we do get some good acting from our cast. I assume fans of the original won't be thrilled about this remake, but for those who either didn't like the original or thought it was okay, they mind something a bit more to like here, but nothing vastly greater.

When a little girl is stolen away by malevolent spirits, her family must band together to rescue her.

What did I think?

This remake of the 1982 film has all the modern bells and whistles youd expect, with computer-generated effects and new technology being used to try to ramp up the spook factor. The cast, including Sam Rockwell as the little girls father and Jared Harris as a grizzled paranormal investigator, deliver solidly amusing performances. But amusing isn't really what horror is going for. On the whole, however, this flick is written and shot too blandly to be especially frightening or fun. Why remake a film if you cant improve on the original?",1437091200,11,679,4.836206896551724
7329909,2,B0118S73VG,I may be prejudice being a fan of the original but this version was definitely not as good.  The whole movie fell flat and was more humorous than horror.  The ending was awful.  Go watch or rewatch the original instead.,1437091200,7,219,4.425
7329910,1,B0118S73VG,"Talk about a movie that did NOT need to be remade?!  Kind of makes you wonder what moron's are giving the ""green light"" to these movies when there are perfectly good, ORIGINAL ideas?!

For starters, if you can't create something better than the original, then don't even bother.  Poltergeist (1982) was perfectly cast and honestly had all the visuals you need (even in todays world of over-CGI'd everything).  The new version cuts out a lot of what made the original as great as it was. You simply can't replace Zelda Rubinstein.  She (along with Craig T. Nelson), is what made the original so entertaining!  While ""some"" of the acting was ok (Sam Rockwell), they dumbed the story into a coma inducing, 93 minute snoozefest!  I couldn't tell you how many times I found myself looking at the clock wondering when this was going to be over?

The clown,....this thing was so heavily promoted as the ""star"" of this movie, it was extremely disappointing to see it made an appearance for all of around 10 seconds of the film.  Not to mention they completely removed the swimming pool scene.  One of the most iconic scenes in horror and they take it out?!  Ugh!  Well, at least they didn't screw that up too?

Final Verdict:  Avoid!  Avoid!  AVOID!",1437004800,74,1241,4.675925925925926
7329911,3,B0118S73VG,"While a completely unnecessary remake, it isn't an altogether terrible one.  Then again, Im probably in the extreme minority when I admit I only regard the original Poltergeist as a just okay film to begin with, so my expectations were already tamed going into it. This review may contain some spoilers but Im writing it assuming most people are familiar with the general plotline.

Likewise, since I imagine most people will inevitably base their like or dislike of this version based on comparisons to the original, know that this film does not necessarily strive to be a copy. In fact I might not even call it a horror film at all; its more of a movie about familial relationships and the fact theres a portal to another dimension in the upstairs bedroom is entirely incidental. That said, there were some iconic scenes I was looking forward to seeing  the chairs arranging themselves on top of the kitchen table, for example  which they chose to do away with completely, but considering how flat the Theyre here line comes across maybe thats a good thing after all. In typical Hollywood fashion they make the infamous clown doll much more grotesque than necessary, but thankfully, in spite of the fact it seemed to be the films most visible marketing tool, it gets less than five minutes of screen time so it was nowhere near as silly as it could have been.

The acting is above average. Sam Rockwell turns just about any role he touches into gold, and combined with Rosemarie DeWitt they make for a cool set of parents. If anything they may be a little TOO accepting of the supernatural goings-on in their home which causes the entire pace of the movie to be super quick as theres no real build up or grand reveal, but that doesnt mean they didn't work well with what they had. Kennedi Clements held her own as the youngest daughter who gets transported to the realm of lost spirits  which we actually get to SEE in this version and it is fairly well done  but may have been just a tad too young to fully grasp the weight of her role, but that was more than made up for by Kyle Catlett as the middle son whose acting career should take off just fine if he chooses to pursue it. Hes just got one of those expressive faces that gets the point across when words wont. At first I was slightly skeptical of Jared Harris casting as the clairvoyant/exorcist who comes in to save the day  I feel Zelda Rubinstein may as well have trademarked the role, lol  but again, it was probably best they create an original character instead of try and reproduce an iconic one. The accompanying team of ghost hunters felt a little bumbling at times, which is fine, but it was right on that line where you couldn't tell if it was always intentional.

Overall I neither loved nor hated this movie, but could appreciate certain aspects of what they were trying to do and would say its worth watching once for those who may be curious. It certainly didn't break any new ground, and like I said above a lot of it simply went by much too quickly to really sink in, but the performances were solid and its a fair alternative to some of the more popular slow burn horror movies out there.",1436918400,11,3166,4.5
7329912,3,B0118S73VG,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Poltergeist""

1. This movie isn't completely terrible. But it is a perfect example of the fact that just because you CAN remake a classic movie doesn't mean you SHOULD.

2. The original 1982 ""Poltergeist"" became a kind of template for the next 30 years of haunted house movies - it's been copied countless times. So this bland paint-by-number remake seems like a copy of a copy (if you seriously don't know the plot, it's about a family that moves into a house. The house has mean spirits in it that kidnap the daughter. The family tries to get her back).

3. The movie recreates most of the famous scenes of the original, but still tries to be its own film, so it cuts other scenes out, and streamlines the whole thing. Sometimes it worked; there were a few effective and interesting parts. But parts of the movie were just boring. And there were moments where the movie tried to be humorous, but the humor didn't fit the scene, so it all just became awkward.

4. Naming the little girl ""Maddie"" just doesn't have the same ring to it as ""Carol Anne"".

5. Besides being full of supernatural forces, the house is also full of Apple products, with the logo usually pointing at the screen in a painfully obvious way.

6. The kid that plays the little boy is the best actor in the movie. The rest of them kind of suck (well, Sam Rockwell did OK as the father, I guess).

7. Strangely, the special effects in this movie are not much better than the ones in the original. In some ways, they're worse. This version is also less scary than the original, with less drama and even less blood. The whole thing is just... less.

8. The ending was abrupt, anti-climactic, and dumb. It's like the filmmakers suddenly realized they ran out of money, so they just stopped filming, capped it with a strange comedic ending, and then slapped on the credits.

9. If you really need to watch a horror film, there are worse ones than this. But there are also better ones. Like the original.",1436572800,159,1997,4.479338842975206
7329913,4,B0118S73VG,"If you are like me, you already know the plot and will be menatlly comparing this film to the classic. Eric (Sam Rockwell) gets laid off as a quality inspector for John Deere. His wife is going to write a book. They are downsizing their home and moving into a community that already has a lot of foreclosures. Apparently he didn't need a bank loan. We know the drill, cemetery, power lines, ""Poltergeist"" mowed into the lawn (opening sequel) but no swimming pool.

Their son Griffin (Kyle Catlett) is afraid of his own shadow and sleeps in the attic with left over clown dolls and wild squirrels. Kennedi Clements plays Madison, the little girl. Personally I preferred Heather O'Rourke.

In our update, the poltergeist have a plethora of electronic devices to haunt and it seems modern smart phones have a app to locate them. Rockwell plays his typical semi-disagreeable character. Zelda Rubinstein has no equal so they opted for a TV show tough paranormal hunter (Jared Harris). I enjoyed the special effects and the use of the sound track. It was a professional production, not some ""B"" movie hack job. I enjoyed the film, even though you may not.

7329921,1,B0118S73VG,"The ""Poltergeist"" remake fails on almost every level. I'm not anti-remake, so long as the people crafting the film have something new to say on a familiar story (Rob Zombie's ""Halloween""), or want to pay homage to classic by updating the story while remaining true to the spirit of the original (John Carpenter's ""The Thing""), but ""Poltergeist"" is completely pointless.

As the film starts we meet a family moving into their new home, apparently a step down as the father is now unemployed, the mother is a wannabe author who doesn't write. So they have no income coming in, but are purchasing as house? We soon learn that the family is swimming in debt, credit cards are maxed (which is the true horror of the film), and there's some funky stuff happening in the youngest daughter's room. It's not long before the tiny tyke is talking and touching hands to the TV (now a flatscreen, but still showing static). I won't go into spoilers in case someone out there still wants to subject themselves to this movie (don't), but from there the remake hits most of the same beats as the original.

There are so many problems with this film, not the least of which is that this family is TOXIC. I have liked Sam Rockwell since watching him in ""Clownhouse"", and this is the first film where it felt like he was just phoning it in. You don't really care what happens to these people because you don't like any of them.

But the biggest failing of the movie is that lacks scares and suspense. This is a movie made by committee, and you can just see them checking off the boxes; the original did this, so we'll do it too, here mix in some ""Paranormal Activity"" and some found footage stuff to keep it current, and boom cookie-cutter, soulless entertainment.

I was not comparing the movie other than ""They're here"". Everything else I treated as a new experience, and in many ways, this is a new experience, with a effectively frightening vision of the demons trying to tear this family apart. The father was surprisingly calm most of the film, as was consistent with his introduction, though it did sap some of the tension away, seeming him so calm and composed and in control of his emotions most times. The girl, Maddy, did a respectable job as did her brother, mother and sister. The movie caught me off guard more than I expected also with some clever alarming moments, and was tense and exciting most times. The evil spirits were ghastly to my liking in this film. Don't think of this as a remake, but instead another account of a similar haunting as with the original. In that sense, they should have given it a subtitle, like Poltergeist: Re-awakening or something, just to separate it and allow it to breathe on its own without direct comparison, since it's definitely not a shot for shot remake.

Poltergeist 3D was converted from 2D to 3D by Legend 3D.
An excellent high medium to strong 3D conversion that went well beyond my expectations. There is only one shot at the end of the film that they didn't convert to 3D as the car drives off with a close up inside. The strong 3D opening house shot with the weeping tree in the foreground will give you an idea of what to expect with this conversion.

7329941,3,B0118S73VG,"I wanted to really like this movie so desperately. The original is hands-down my favorite Hollywood ghost story ever, and even today, some thirty-plus years after I first saw it, hasn't lost the ability to give me the creeps. Hooper and Spielberg's version has a superb cast with amazing chemistry, a top notch script, special effects courtesy of ILM, genuine thrills, chills, and humor, and is rightly regarded as an absolute classic.

So of course, they remade it...

Leaving aside the question of ""Why bother?"" I tried to approach the 2016 version with an open mind., Unfortunately, it does not compare all that favorably to its illustrious predecessor. For starters, the casting is less than stellar. Sam Rockwell is OK in the Craig T. Nelson role, but the actress playing his wife doesn't hold a candle to JoBeth Williams. The kids are OK, and not as annoying as they might have been, but never seem as reak as the Freeling kids did in the first movie.

Structurally, believe it or not, I think the movie is too short. One of the biggest omissions is the lack of getting to know the paranormal investigators, as we did in the first film, and as a team I think that they are sorely underused. Tangina, everybody's favorite psychic medium, has been replaced by a jocular Irishman with a dark past and a sketchy TV career, which is fine as far as it goes. His performance isn't bad, though a little on the bland side. At least they kept ""This house is clean!""

Special effects are OK, though nothing jaw-dropping or particularly groundbreaking. And that really sums up the whole movie. If you're going to remake a classic such as ""Poltergeist,"" it needs to be a lot better than simply ""OK."" This isn't,

The Blu-Ray disc looks and sounds great. Special features are conspicuous by their absence, and the usual behind the scenes documentaries are missing. There is an alternate ending, if that floats your boat.

7329969,5,B0118S73VG,"A high placer on my personal mental list of Most Under-Appreciated Movies, the 2015 Poltergeist is, in my opinion, an excellent remake and a fully worthy entry in the series.  Plotwise it's very similar (though thankfully not identical) to the 1982 original, with a family of five moving into a new house in a newly built subdivision.  The housing market crash has hit the developers hard and the new homes haven't sold as well as the developers hoped, leaving the family pretty much alone in the neighborhood; there's no one around to notice or call for help when things start getting really weird inside and around the house.  Almost immediately after moving in, the strangeness begins, at first noticed only by the two young children, Griffin and Maddy (Kyle Catlett and Kennedi Clements).  The supernatural beings focus most of their attention on little Maddy, and are obviously intent on moving more fully from their world into ours.  For anybody who's seen the original movie or much advertising for this version probably knows why this house in this particular neighborhood becomes such a magnet for spririts and poltergeists, but for anyone who doesn't know yet I'll leave that part blank.  It'll suffice to say that before long the supernatural manifestations become so obvious that the rest of the family is soon converted to the camp of the believers.  With Maddy apparantly taken by the spirits, the desperate family turns to a university paranormal studies department for help, which in turn calls in an expert who has his own tv ghost-hunting show (I know this angle could have turned out terrible but they actually made it work).  From there it's the family and the team trying to find out what the spirits want and how to get their daughter back.

There are touches of comedy throughout which won't play well with some viewers, but I found the film to be more adept than many at the tricky task of inserting humorous moments into a horror movie.  Another reason it caught flak was simply for being a remake of a movie that was already good.  Years ago, when the horror remake boom was just starting, I may have been skeptical too.  But I've seen too many remakes that I loved to hold onto that skepticism, and have never had a remake (even a misfire) affect how much I love the originals.  Besides, remakes have only dominated horror at the chain multiplexes - if you look at limited release movies, direct-to-DVD, foreign markets or VOD, there's actually been a huge amount of great original horror movies made in recent years; it's just that 99% of them get hardly any attention (Altitude, Splinter, Thirst, Laid To Rest and its sequel Chromeskull, Rigor Mortis, The Atticus Institute, Track Man, A Christmas Horror Story, Isolation, Siren, Red Mist and I could go on and on here).  Anyways, I'm digressing here; my ppoint is don't think it's got to be bad just because it's a remake.

The production values and special effects are excellent, and the cast does a great job, especially the two child actors.  I think this movie was intended to relaunch the whole series (and possibly do a spinoff involving the ghost-hunting team, although that could just be speculation on my part), but I don't know if that's still the plan.  I personally would welcome a follow-up, and in the meantime I wholeheartedly recommend this one.",1478217600,,3341,4.823117338003502

Its difficult to attempt to re-boot a classic.  And more often than not people tend to be disappointed with the results.

I did not find this movie as terrible as some reviewers think but not as good as it might have been.  It seemed to be a little rushed somehow.  The parents seemed detached from what was going on around them and as a result I found it tough to care about them.  The boy and the paranormal investigator (Jared Harris, who I thought was great in Mad Men and Game of Shadows) seemed to put in the most interesting performances.

The movie also seemed to be making a point about how technology has changed since the original movie.  Now the spirits come through flat-panel displays and cell phones and we have FPV drones to send into their dimension and see them.

Having flown drones before I found myself wondering how the kid was going to get it back.  Getting it out of the dead zone is much tougher than crashing one on a roof.",1469923200,3,1137,4.291079812206573

Picture quality is good. Sound quality is outstanding. Sam Raimi has always relied on sound effects for his scares. This movie is no exception.

The original had some commentary about American values of materialism which this remake tries tepidly and half-heartedly to rehash.

When I was around 14 years old, I really wanted to see my first horror movie after watching the trailer to the Poltergeist reboot. In order to understand what was going to happen in the movie, I decided to watch the 1982 original version. Then on May 22, 2015, the exact same day Poltergeist hit theaters, I went with a friend to see Poltergeist. I was very excited to watch it. I laughed, I screamed, my eyes were literally glued to the movie screen the entire 2 hours. Comparing it to the original, I was impressed. They really captured the events in the original such as Carol Anne talking to the TV, ""They're Here"", and the strange phenomenons the Freelings encountered throughout the movie. If I could rate the Poltergeist reboot out of 5 stars, I would give it 5/5 stars because it is just like the original, and if you watch the credits closely, they gave Steven Spielberg credit for the original movie .

This was a movie that I always thought that would eventually get the remake treatment but never needed it. The first film is a classic and I think that most would agree with that. I would have eventually seen this but I ended up going to see this in theaters because I found out Sam Raimi produced it. So I had to go see it then. Then when the Blu-Ray was released I had to own it, good thing the movie is better than I thought it was going to be, for a remake.

The story like the original follows a family who has moved a house that unbeknownst to them was built upon a cemetery. So as the family settles in strange things start to happen, particularly to the youngest of the three children, Maddie. These spirits have latched onto her believing that she can lead them to the light. So as the family comes under attack and their daughter is taken they look to outside help to bring her back.

Like I said this remake was actually better than I was expecting it to be. Sure some things were changed but some was the same, I hate that clown. The acting was good as one would expect including the kids, the youngest two in particular. Writer David Lindsay-Abaire [the animated films Robots, The Rise of the Guardians and films like Inkheart and Oz the Great & Powerful] did a good job keeping the story the same but also changing it a bit. Same can be said for director Gil Kenan [animated classic Monster House], Raimi and Rob Tapert picked a good crew.

You get the theatrical and unrated cuts of the film plus an alternate ending for a special feature. Over all even though it is far from the classic first or even the best remake it is still good. I would recommend checking it out even as a rental. I am interested to see if this continues into some sequels like the original.",1463961600,,1793,4.311572700296736

It was rushed, lacked depth and felt it was more of a what not to do in hollywood, and how not to act in film. So, so poor; ridiculous reactions to life threatening situations. The family unit in Tobe's original, was so touching and the love they had for each other in the face of the super natural terror, was superbly filmed and acted, and jobeth williams, of course, was stunning.

The scare factor, really isn't there, the only scene I found interesting is behind the wall, and when they show that. Otherwise, this movie just can't compare to the original.

7330044,1,B0118S73VG,"I can't believe this movie received 5 stars from anyone. If you have the time to watch this take that time and watch the original instead. When my sister told me to watch this I had my reservations about it. After all, I knew before even watching it that it would really have to get it to be better than the Hooper version. I was right. I didn't find this movie scary at all. The cast had little chemistry and I found myself not caring what happened. I actually turned it off. I have read reviews on the original where reviewers complain about the special effects. The special effects on the original are great for a movie made in 1982. Besides I believe a lot of movies today rely too heavily on CGI and end up sacrificing story and substance.

The problem with any remake is it should at least be just as good as the original. This is where the majority of remakes fail. I feel like Hollywood keeps remaking really great movies just for the money. They take a great movie, make a B version of it with little effort and watch the money roll in. I would've much preferred seeing a spin-off version to the movie or a later day sequel with maybe a member of the Freeling family grown up or perhaps about a family living in the same suburb where the Freelings once lived. Any of those would've been better than this. Instead Hollywood seems to want to put as little effort and creativity into remakes as possible just to make a quick buck. In this day and time 'New' is sold as always better but that is definitely not always the case and these remakes prove it.

I will say the best 2 remakes I've seen so far are The Last House on the Left and Fright Night. Both of those were done really well. That said, I want to see some horror movies with original ideas coming out of Hollywood. I'm sick of Found Footage movies, movies that provide only jump scares or are full of torture porn. Come on Hollywood, where's your creativity? I didn't rent this one and I'm glad I didn't waste my money on it. I caught it while it was on Starz. If you have never seen Poltergeist I recommend you watch the original. This version is nowhere near as good.",1457395200,,2137,4.300248138957817
7330045,2,B0118S73VG,I call bull crap. I'm a huge fan of the poltergeist franchise and this was a sad remake. I know they tried but it was so far from what I expected it made it comical.,1457395200,,165,3.742857142857143
7330046,1,B0118S73VG,"On of the worst re-makes Iv ever seen. The story line was throne totally out of the window. It touches on SOME aspects of the original, but massacred it as far as im concerned. If Tobe Hooper was dead, he'd be rolling in his grave. Poorly done, waist of time.",1457395200,2,259,4.2
7330047,3,B0118S73VG,"I could list a bunch of reasons why Poltergeist 2015 isn't very good.  The many negative reviews are legit, but to be fair who really expected this updated version to stand in the same league as the original?

For one thing both parents (Same Rockwell and Rosemarie Dewitt) act like they don't even care about their kids because they never listen to their young son for one thing (Kyle Catlett) whenever he tries to explain to them that something is seriously wrong with the house and that they should move.  The young daughter who gets sucked into the spiritual dimension (Kennedi Clements) is *nowhere* as memorable as the little girl from the original Poltergeist.  She could have easily be replaced with another little girl actress without any difference.  That's a pretty big problem because we all love Heather O'Rourke.  The teenage daughter (Saxon Sharbino) is passable at least.

The film lacks not having a memorable character like Zelda Rubinstein.  Remember her?  She was that freaky little lady who was the paranormal investigator.  She had a TON of personality.  Instead the paranormal investigators in Poltergeist 2015 are REALLY forgettable.  They have no personality whatsoever, and basically act like they don't even care about their jobs.  They certainly don't care about the family's trauma dealing with the poltergeist activity because they show no genuine concern in that department.  You also sense they don't have that desire to track the evil entities like the ones in the original Poltergeist.

In a hilarious moment, the one investigator even approaches the little boy and implies that maybe his father is faking the daughter being trapped in the other dimension for the purpose of attention and money.  That was a *really* awkward moment, haha.  Even worse- the other investigator working for him didn't even say that was completely the wrong thing to say to a child.  Way too unrealistic.

With mediocre characters, what's the next thing about the film to rip apart?  Ah yes, the atmosphere... or lack thereof.  There is no atmosphere in this film.  Instead the film takes the story from the original Poltergeist and basically only shows us the most memorable and recognizable scenes.  So there's no interesting story build-up- it's just basically a highlight reel of sorts, showing many of the memorable scenes from the original Poltergeist but with less satisfying results because we've already seen them.

There probably is one exception- the boy in his attic bedroom with a ceiling window... REALLY creepy when he see the kid running out of his room after a clown doll comes to life and he kicks it in the head, and the tree branch approaches the window.  As you know if you've seen the original, the backyard tree actually comes alive, breaks through the window, picks up the boy and flings him around.  That was actually a low point concerning the original Poltergeist because it was really far-fetched, but it's decently done here at least.  But were there evil clown dolls in the original Poltergeist and rodents running around?  That I can't remember.

The movie's also missing the classic scene where the kitchen chairs stack themselves when I believe it was the mother who turns around and gets the surprise of her life in the original Poltergeist.  Instead Poltergeist 2015 goes for a box of books that stack themselves when the little boy is led into a bedroom closet by a baseball.  Unintentionally hilarious when the stacked books suddenly knock themselves down and the mother downstairs doesn't even hear it.  Yeah right!  That was loud!

And yeah, that mysterious bedroom closet- the source of all the problems.  The movie does a pretty solid job giving the closet wall the attention it needs, even if we have to sit through a few awkward moments such as the one paranormal investigator dropping his drill inside the wall and a poltergeist picking it up, pulling the guys arms and face towards the wall and threatening to drill a hole in his head.  This is typical Hollywood horror cheese.

So with all these problems what does the movie do right?  After all I'm giving the film 3 stars for a reason.  Well the biggest reason I'm giving the movie 3 stars is because even with its many flaws, I *still* like the storyline.  It's still one of the creepiest in the history of horror films.  Several angry bodies buried underneath the house combine all their energy to turn this property into a nightmare.  I like how the movie shows the spiritual dimension located behind the little girls bedroom closet.  The movie does a fantastic job showing this otherworld and it's a very dreary and unusual place reminiscent of a Metroid video game, however it comes at the cost of the movie taking advantage of today's technology- that being drones and smartphones.  Yeah I have mixed feelings with these additions.

Also I like the occasional little moments of unsettlement such as when the young son and daughter touch the bedroom closet doorknob and it produces static which makes their hair stand up on end.  And the electric charges that are felt at the bottom of the stairway.  Quality moments.  Oh and my favorite moment- when the daughter appears to return from the otherworld but she's actually a blackened demonic version of herself, so when the father chases her to the bedroom closet and she hides in the corner, the father kneels down and gets a really big lashing surprise!  From a storyline point of view this segment doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  If all the family members were to enter this mysterious place, would they too have demonic copycats roaming around?  Also the teenage daughter who temporarily gets trapped in the garage... she sees the floor crumbling so she actually picks at it and makes the black goop gushing out even worse!  Silly girl.

Jarred Harris is somewhat forgettable though.  He's the investigator brought in out of desperation.  He seems more concerned being a somewhat arrogant know it all with several stories connected to the reasons for his scars, bruises and disfigured leg instead of wanting to help a family desperate to get their daughter back.  It's the way he acts that rubs me the wrong way.  Also the memorable TV segment showing the little girl touching a hand on the other side of the screen with her famous ""They're here!"" message just seemed forced and unnecessary.

Sometimes it's best to leave the original alone, and this is one of those cases.  Poltergeist 2015 is still decent however, just nothing great.  I admit I like the film though, which is why I spend all day dodging people's rotten tomatoes!",1457222400,,6611,4.881508078994614

7330071,2,B0118S73VG,"Okay, well, I'm not a fan of the remakes or certain reboots (I really did enjoy the reboot of Fright Night. Well done!). I've always felt the originals should stay the originals for a reason and this movie proved my point. This movie should not have been made or if they did want to reboot a classic, then should've stuck with the original concept of the movie and just elaborated on some of the dated visual effects of the 1982 classic. I think what made the first Poltergeist the classic it IS is because the story was solid, and there was so much left to the imagination in regards to ""the other side"" and why in particular they wanted little Carol Anne (which you get more into with the sequel), but it left you wanting more. Not to mention, for 1982, the visuals were outstanding! I saw this movie for the first time when I was a kid and even today still ranks as one of the best horror films of all time! Now, what this recent installment tried to do and did it in a rushed sort of way was minimize the backstory into a few rushed sentences in the middle of the movie. Essentially combining the first one and the sequel into one movie. That might be alright for those that prefer a movie to move quickly and get to the point, but I think what makes older horror classics ""classics"" is how they tell the story, build it up and then hit you with the climax. I've always felt if a movie has you thinking, asking questions and makes you want to watch again to get you thinking more and enjoying it even more, that's a damn good movie. This movie lacked ""good movie"" quality to me.

The acting was awful (and I like Sam Rockwell), the special effects were overly saturated with CGI, and as it did try to attempt to pull from the original story, it didn't do it justice at all (story was patchy and rushed). They seemed to make the Poltergeist more ""technical"" than ""supernatural""---which was another more appealing aspect of the first one. I know were in the age of technology and things becoming advanced when it comes to technology, but a good ghost story doesn't or shouldn't rely on that stuff. It should stick to good old fashion supernatural feel. That's what makes it scary! Not seeing, not knowing what's going to happen next or why certain things happen. Let the suspense build and then hit us with the unexpected! That's Poltergeist (1982)! For those who haven't seen the original or those who are big fans of the original as I, there's a remastered version available now that really enhances the movie well and so worth the buy.

The original Carol Ann had a way of speaking that was more ""ominous"" than Maddie. This is not to undermine the current one, just seemed like they could have taken some of these basic elements and incorporated them into the new version. Hopefully they will do a sequel to the new one and find some more detailed depths, like the original sequel. As an independent, standalone film, it is not bad, just that if you compare the two, the first one wins, sorry to say. Craig Nelson works out better in the Father role, but Sam Rockwell is okay, however the psychic in this film is definitely the scene stealer, and I love it.",1453507200,,777,4.47887323943662

Although it is VERY loosely based on the 1982 film, that's where any resemblance ends.  Matter of fact, the only thing the two films have in common is the title.  The house, the characters, the plot, everything about this movie was just plain wrong.  The casting of characters was downright bizarre, and there's no chemistry between anyone.  The mother comes across as a frustrated housewife, the oldest daughter as a spoiled brat, the son as having serious emotional problems, and the youngest daughter who the ghosts are all so eager to catch, doesn't come across as believable or convincing at all.  Sam Rockwell, the dad, was just not suited for this role, period.  He goes through the entire movie looking like he's ready to bust up laughing at nothing in particular.  Even the cheesy ""special effects"" just don't have any scare factor here.  There were scenes that were meant to be scary or dramatic that actually had the opposite effect.  I found myself cracking up more than a few times.  All in all, I give it a big resounding ""F"".  This movie was boring, ridiculous, pointless, and completely unnecessary.  A total turkey.

This movie lacked the heart and emotion and depth of the original. The movie felt rushed and seemed like it cut MAJOR corners instead of flushing out all the elements of the story.

The family had no chemistry. Yep, the WHOLE family. The chemistry was so bad that I didn't even the mother liked ""Maddie"" let alone love her. (SPOILER ALERT!) When Maddie gets taken her brother leaves her to be kidnapped by said poltergiest. The parents are daily calm in my opinion. The over hyped clown is literally in the film all of 10 seconds and it comes off a a gag really, not a major part of the film as advertised. They use a drone to find Maddie and the poor excuse of a brother saves her. After the two children are back (a very pivotal and heart wrenching scene in the original film) was anticlimactic and just boring. AND NO POOL SCENE?!!!!!! With all the CGI effects Available to movie makers putting that scene in the movie should've been a no brainer! There was no big climax. No nothing. Nothing saved this movie.

You have a great idea to work with and you make it worse.  The dialogue is horrible and you can forget the scares as those border comedy.  And they seemed to have picked plastic actors who have never had a day of acting work in their life.  I'm sure they were paid no more than scale for this.  Sam Rockwell is decent enough and is usually a great actor, but he couldn't lift this garbage out of the sewer.  Watch it if you want, but don't expect much.  And if you've never seen the original, don't even think about watching this.  It'll give it a bad name.  This movie cost $35 million and it made $95 million worldwide.

First of all, I hated all the actors except the little girl in this movie. I think the kid they used here has that same weird look to her as the little girl in the original- and she pulled off her role well. Everyone else, eh, they could've been better. Jared Harris' character could've been removed entirely and it probably would've made the whole movie better. Not because he's a bad actor, but because it was a bad character choice. He just... didn't fit. It was too much, too over the top. 'I'm the only one left who can lead them into the light!' Come on, seriously? Zelda Rubinstein did such a better job at this character, she had this naturally weird vibe about her. She was irreplaceable in this role.

Second, what did you do to the plot?! Ok, it isn't that much different, but eh, it wasn't the same, either. I liked the idea about there being a world beyond the living world, but the FX they used to display this other world were just crappy and worthless.

7330164,2,B0118S73VG,"While I haven't seen the original Stephen Spielberg scripted, Tobe Hooper directed Poltergeist from 1982, in a long time I have fond memories and remember it was scarily effective.  So why remake it?  Why indeed.  Well it attempts to update it to some degree and does have a stellar cast including Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt as Eric and Amy Bowen, the parents of teenaged Kendra (Saxon Sharbino), pre-teen Griffin (Kyle Catlett) and 6 year old Madison (Kennedi Clements).

I was actually thrown off track at the beginning.  The seemingly happy family is actually moving into a lesser house because Eric lost his job and this is all they can afford.  Stop right there.  So he got a mortgage with no job?  Amy doesnt work outside the home, so how are they going to make payments.  We also learn that Eric has all but one of his credit cards cancelled but the one that is still alive, he uses to buy i-phones and games for the kids.  Hey, they deserved to be haunted.

As it turns out, the house sits on top of an old cemetery that was supposed to have been moved.  Yet, there house seems to be the only one in the neighborhood that has visitors from the ghostserr poltergeists.  Young Maddie is the one the ghosts seem to be most fond of and she is swallowed into their dark lair.  She appears periodically via the flat screen TV  just a CRT TV in 82  asking to be rescued.

Realizing the authorities will just laugh them off, the Bowens call for help from the university in the form of Dr. Brooke Powell (Jane Adams), who heads a team that investigates the paranormal.  It turns out she used to be mated with a TV personality named Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris) who deals in spooky stuff too.  So, somehow they come up with an idea involving a rope leading into a closet.  This will allow someone to enter and go after Maddie and then get pooped out of a brown orifice in the ceiling.

The biggest problem with the movie is that the family is dumb, as are most who decide to stay in a haunted house well past the expiration date.  The film isn't horrible and in fact, some of the special effects are pretty darn good.  But scary?  Nope.  Creepy?  Nope.  Gory?  Nope.  Sexy?  Nope.

7330197,2,B0118S73VG,"Remakes are always a tricky move and rarely live up to the standards of the original film. That is precisely the case in this POLTERGEIST remake. I didn't expect a classic in the making but I was still sorely disappointed. The story has been modernized a bit with cell phones and drones and the ghost hunter is now a TV reality star. Little Carol Anne is now named Maddie (Madison). I guess they have to go with the times.
Sam Rockwell is the father and I usually like him in films but he must have been asleep during the filming of POLTERGEIST. He shows little emotion and seems like a walking zombie. Few of the actors show much energy and there is not much life to this film (no pun intended but even the dead people are boring).
The only bright spot in this film is young Kyle Catlett as the Bowen's son Griffin. Griffin has a fear issue so why did they put him in the attic bedroom? Kyle is the believable person in the film showing genuine emotion, fear and eventually courage. This actor is one to watch for in future films.
When Maddie disappears into the ghostly limbo, the parents aren't all that upset or so it seems. Rockwell says they can't go to the police> It would be hard to explain that dead people have your 5-year-old daughter. It does border on silliness and I guess, the original even had a camp factor to it.

Other than the small supporting role of the male psychic (The actor who plays the Nigel, the British ad exec on Mad Men), all of the actors are terrible. It was interesting to see what was in the ""other world tunnel"" that was never seen in the original movie and what was chasing CarolAnn, but I wish Speilberg had had the technology to tackle it back in the 1980s. Now THAT would have been awesome!

The tragedy of this train wreck though is the utter wasting of Sam Rockwell.  He can't even rise above the material and he is very adept at creating characters and is always memorable.  Not here.

7330208,2,B0118S73VG,"I was on the fence when I heard that there would be a remake to Poltergeist, one of the greatest horror classics ever made.  But I decided to give this movie a chance.  Unfortunately this movie comes nowhere near to the awesomeness of the original.  *Spoilers ahead*

The Plot:
Follows the original pretty closely, but his one seemed so rushed.  Its about a family that moves into a poltergeist infested house and the youngest daughter gets sucked into another portal/dimension.  The family seeks the help of paranormal investigators to get her back.

The Characters:
1).  First of all Hollywood, if you want us to care about the main characters, you have to make them likable.  None of these characters are likable.  To start, you see the family moving into a pretty big, nice two-story house in what looks to be a really nice quiet neighborhood....and all they can do is complain about what a dump it is.  Really??  Right off the bat they come off as spoiled entitled brats and I have no sympathy for any of them. There is a scene early on where the parents are talking to the real estate agent and she asks if they will be commuting to work.  The mom says no as she plans on being a stay-at-home mom.  The dad on the other hand says yes he will be commuting.  When the real estate agent asks where he works, he says John Deere, and the real estate agent starts going on and on about how much she loves her mower and what an excellent quality product it is and what a great company it is.  He quickly cuts her off and says rudely something like ""yeah they were a great company until they laid me off"", leaving the real estate agent feeling and looking like a fool.  THEN WHY DID HE SAY HE WORKS THERE AND HE WOULD BE COMMUTING?  What a jerk thing for him to do.  There went any sympathy I felt for him.
2).  The kids are typical spoiled loud brats.  Apparently the youngest one is super emo for no reason.  The middle boy somehow feels the need to shout everything at the top of his lungs, and the oldest daughter seems to get away with cursing at her parents and acting like a b.
3).  The paranormal team is pretty forgettable.  You have Dr. Powell who is the lead investigator, and two others with her who are so boring I don't even remember their names.  There's also Carrigan Burke who has his own ghost hunting show, he should have been a really cool character but he seems more of a caricature than a character.  Every time he said anything I almost expected the soundtrack to go dun-dun-duuuuunnnn.

The Inconsistencies:
Too many inconsistencies in this movie.
1).  The oldest daughter complains to her friend that the only mall in town is vacant and boarded up, yet like 5 minutes later we see the dad go on a shopping spree at the mall!
2).  Also, can somebody tell me how two unemployed people get approved for a house?  Seriously what bank gives money to somebody who just got laid off and a stay-at-home mom?  Not realistic at all.  And to make matters worse, they make her a ""writer"" in this film, the go-to-job Hollywood over uses.  I cringe and roll my eyes every time I'm watching a movie and it is revealed that the main character is a ""writer"" for a living.
3).  Another inconsistency is the paranormal team.  You would think that a paranormal team would consist of people that actually believe in the paranormal and take it seriously.  Nope, you get people who seem to care less that they're there, cracking jokes at inappropriate times, and one buffoon who accuses the family of making everything up to get their own reality show, even though just 2 minutes prior a chair that he was about to sit in gets thrown across the room by itself.  Then he gets attacked by an entity while in the closet, and he decides to tell nobody...so stupid.
4).  There is one scene where the kids get attacked while home alone.  The oldest daughter gets attacked in the garage early on, and the boy gets attacked by the tree.  When the parents arrive, the oldest daughter tells her parents they were attacked and that the boy was dragged by the tree.  How did she know this?  She was stuck in the garage the whole time, there is no way she could have seen that he got dragged away by the tree.
5).  At the very end, after their original house explodes, you see the family in a brand new van out house shopping.  Again, somebody please tell me what bank on earth would give either of these two people any money!

The Acting:
The acting was pretty subpar in this movie.  Where people were supposed to be crying, you didn't see a single tear shed.  Lines were delivered very dull even though the scenes they were in were supposed to be very emotional.  Its like they were reading off cue cards just off camera.  I didn't believe for a single moment any of the emotions they were trying to display.  Nobody acted like somebody would really act in a situation like this. For example near the end, they just survived a traumatic experience where two of the kids came back from another portal/dimension, and the stupid older daughter wants the head paranormal guy to say his tv show line so she can record it on her phone for her friend.  He does it and everybody belly laughs.  They act like they're about to go on vacation instead of a family leaving their haunted house.

I only generously gave this movie 2 stars because I thought the scenes from the other portal/dimension where the little girl gets sucked into were pretty cool and well done.

In conclusion, watch the original Poltergeist.  The original is a horror classic gem that stands the test of time.  That movie had real scares, real acting, real everyday characters that you can sympathize with.",1448323200,,5657,4.470703125

7330213,1,B0118S73VG,"I'm no critic BUT if you are a horror fan this movie ranks at the bottom. First off, it is VERY hard for a horror genre film to make mega success status because a lot of people do not watch horror movies and/or horror fans are VERY picky when it comes to selecting a horror movie and rating it well. Making a horror movie today is very special because special effects will not sell the movie it has to have that creepy factor. For example it can NOT be predicable like this movie. If your movie is not scarier then what's hot at the moment then you lost, in my opinion James Wan movies are what's right .. The Conjuring and Insidious 1 and 2 excellent movies. I'm ashamed to even call them movie Poltergeist after the original movie success this movie SUCKS it was not scary, creepy, interesting even entertaining. The characters, storyline, language all SUCKED. There were so many chances during the movie to make it interesting but it fell flat. Horrible movie .. just horrible.

7330267,1,B0118S73VG,"This film is a waste of time and money. The actors have no chemistry and seem to be in a hurry to get out their lines and be finished with this mess. I really hate it. It lacks soul and there is very little plot. It is as though it figures you already know the story because little is explained or expanded on, you are just supposed to know whats going on and who the characters are. This movie has some weird points too, that actually confuse me. (slight spoiler) There is a part where the ""souls"" are seen in the house, unable to find ""the light"", yet none of them are more than 50 feet away from it (they are in giant clumps), with some of them literally INCHES away from the light, but they cannot find it?!? Also, this includes one of the absolute WORST explainations of multiple dimensions I have ever heard. The researcher draws two circles, each on a separate piece of paper. She points to one of the circles and says ""this is where we are"". She then points to the other circle on the other piece of paper and says ""this is where your sister is"". They all then nod sagely. Utter garbage. The director is crap, the actors are badly miscast (especially the father), the script is weak, and the entire film begs the question ""WHY DOES THIS EXSIST""?",1447200000,39,1253,4.313559322033898

7330378,2,B0118S73VG,"Another remake that doesn't hold up against the dated, but still good original. I have changed my viewing format choices for two reasons. One is for Amazons continued outragious charges for viewing low budget and or bad movies and two. I don't feel quite as bad when I rent a rotten movie for $1.63 Vs. $ 5.99 plus tax for the same movie such as this one as well as Amazons continued incorrect release dates (not in this case) for movies when they use IMDb for some reviews and other info.
Ok. Enough about my ranting and on to this movies review.
Production quality is pretty good overall and the special effects used in the ""other world""  scenes were very good I thought. They were the absolute high point of the entire movie. The family of five consists of the father Eric (Sam Rockwell), the wife/mom Amy (Rosemarie DeWitt) the eldest daughter Kendra (Saxon Sharbino) the middle son Griffin (Kyle Catlett) and the youngest daughter Madison (Kennedi Clements) who I thought stole the show. This is one of the WTH parts of this story. The family relocates after Eric looses his job at John Deere and Amy is a stay at home mom and aspiring writer. How they move and buy another home without either parents having an income is beyond me especially after the housing crash.
Things start happening to the two youngest kids the day they move into their new home. Madison starts talking to the entity while her brother Griffin who is afraid of everything and wants to leave the home. Everyone in the family with the exception of Griffin didn't seem to be that troubled by what is going on in the home until Madison goes missing and even then they go about their daily lives until help arrives. A college professor with paranormal knowledge comes to their aid played by Niles Cranes ex wife Mel (Jane Adams) as Dr. Brooke Powell and a cable tv paranormal investigator Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris) The team preps for war to rescue Madison from the Poltergeist, but the way this story plays out, you get the impression that they have done over a thousand takes for each scene. Not one member of this cast with the exception of the two youngest kids Griffin and Madison show any real enthusiasm in any of the scenes that their in. This can be viewed by teens without any adverse effects with some cursing and one scene of mom and dad trying to get romantic before being interupted by the young ones. Overall 2.5 to 2.7 stars. Not the worst and not that great either.",1446163200,,2459,4.5633484162895925

Some characters from the original movie were deleted and new ones substituted but they meshed well with the plot. The parents in this one, especially the father, aren't especially likable to start with, though their concern for their children once the ghosts strike redeems them.

It takes on alot, attempting to remake such an iconic film as the original is, and this remake simply sucks the balls of a rabid cow when compared. Sam Rockwell is a great actor, but his effort in this film was minimal, I believe he was actually five states away for the entire filming, and only available by phone for his parts.

7330467,4,B0118S73VG,"Ok, so first off, lets get this out of the way. ""The original is the original and of course it is better than the remake.""
Alright now that we got this off our chests lets talk about this movie, the first piece of advice I have if you are going to go into watching this is DO NOT go into it like it is a remake. As best you can clear the original from your mind, or at least your feelings and approach this movie like its own entity (lol).
Overall this movie is well done, I felt it was well acted, and the effects, atmosphere and story were well paced and well told.
It didn't blow my mind in any way, as I think the concept is a bit dated, What was scary back then, just isn't as scary now, as our culture has changed since the original.
I thought this movie was entertaining, and worth my time.
If you are looking for a good night in movie, this is worth the time. If you have never seen the original, then I'm excited for you. I would watch this one and then the original. Just my opinion.
Over all, good flick, fun to watch, did it need to be remade, NO, but, there is some fun nostalgia which comes with remake films like this, and that is what Hollywood was probably betting on. But a word of advice to Hollywood, if it was successful before as the original certainly was, probably best to leave it alone, unless you are going to let some Avant garde director give his original and new take on it. Even with that being said, it is very and should be debated. Hollywood if you are looking to make money, then go find a writer and director and say, ""Hey, we want something that had the buzz, spin and awesomeness of the first Poltergeist back in the day, can you do something like this which is similar, but new and original.""",1445472000,,1731,4.154761904761905

The original movie was one of the scariest horror movies especially for its time and given that Steven Spielberg directed it, that makes perfect sense. I guess you shouldn't try to fix what ain't broke. The plot line was so thin and the dialogue was atrocious and predictable and there was probably about 30 minutes of intricate plot detail that was left on the cutting room floor that should not have been left there.

7330479,2,B0118S73VG,"It reminded me of those old ABC Movie of the Week shows when I was younger. They weren't horrible, but you could definitely tell they were low budget and really simple story lines with second and third string actors. There are zero major stars in the movie and that should have set my alarms off right there. They pretty much took the basic plot of the original movie (family terrorized by something paranormal in their house) and tried to modernize it, I guess, for todays audience. Like people today cant appreciate anything unless its from the current decade, has a crap ton of CGI in it, and only references current pop culture.

Anyway, of course, they had to CGI all the scary stuff to make it better, which um, no. It didnt. The original was above and beyond better in the storyline, in the characters and in the scare factor. The parents in the new one are obnoxious and self-centered. They show no interest in their children and sound like pathetic losers. The kids are little brats and their bad behavior is used for laughs supposedly. The little boy in the movie was the lone person you even gave a crap about. His parents belittle him, treat his fears and psychological issues like hes a whiny baby and just treat him horribly. Seriously. I wanted to take the kid away from them and call CPS on the parents.

The paranormal group the new movie uses looks like the live action version of the Scooby Doo gang. All college goobers that I guess were told to act like socially retarded dorks so the audience would understand they were scientific types. Nice, thanks. Way to stereotype. The big specialist they call in is a TV show personality (think Ghost Adventures with Zac Baggins), yeah seriously. And the entire plot had nothing to do with ghosts like the original which is sad. The ghost idea was scary because in the back of your mind, you wondered if your own home might have ghosts, etc. No, this kept cutting to scenes of nearby electrical towers for some reason, as if to say look, see? These big, bad towers not only cause cancer in people, but they can open dimensional portals and make stuff in our house go wonky. Ugh. That totally takes away from the scariness by blaming power lines for all the paranormal stuff instead of actual, you know, PARANORMAL STUFF.

They talk about how we pass on to a different plane of existence when we die, but then their version of this plane looks like a cave full of naked, slithering mummified bodies. WTF? Nothing is really said about them being trapped there or why. The fact that their house is built on a cemetery and they are the souls from there is given a very brief gloss over. Wow. That was a big deal in the original movie. The souls in the new one look more like ghouls or mummified corpses. Not so much scary as gross looking. The original movie had the big bad demon/devil thing holding onto the little girl on that plane. The new movie doesnt really have anything other than all those corpses. Its not scary.

They mention a poltergeist  an energy in their house but never really explain it but that is supposed to take the place of the evil big bad demon in the movie. Not even close. The original movie did so much better on explaining things and thats what made it creepy. It made it sound plausible and in doing that, it made it more real to you. The build up to the scary parts in the first movie were done so much better too. In the new one, all the buildup seemed rushed, as if the director just wanted to get to the boo! as quickly as possible to get it out of the way.

The worst was the lack of plot or backstory. The dad is unemployed. Why? What happened? You see him be a douche throughout the movie and drink constantly. It doesnt make me care for him; quite the opposite  he looks like a self-centerd, alcoholic loser that deserves every bad thing he gets. The mom is vapid and while she is supposed to be a stay-at-home mom, she never seems genuinely interested in her kids or their wellbeing. She is more about herself and worrying about money. The poor little boy in this movie has past trauma that the movie basically pokes fun at which is deplorable. What parent would make fun of their 7-year-olds fears and call him a whiny baby or tell him to man up? OMG, Im not a parent and I took offense to that! Why would you put your young, emotionally traumatized child into a new house and put HIM all alone up in a creepy 3rd floor attic room away from the rest of the family like hes some kind of leper? That is beyond cruel and so thoughtless it sickens me. Why not put the older teen in the attic room? Youd think shed appreciate the privacy.

Once its found out that their home is built on a cemetery  and this comes way early in the movie sadly, no build up to it  its like no one in the movie really cares or is that horrified about it. They sort of discuss it at a dinner party and then its done.

I am very disappointed in the remake. And once again, I ponder why Hollywood keeps doing half-assed remakes of essentially classic movies from the 80s and 90s. They are not so old that they lack relevancy today, so why? Its like the idiots in Hollywood think hey, that movie was cool, and made a ton of money back in the 80s. So, lets take it, update the references, and add a crap-ton of CGI (because EVERYONE loves CGI; it adds SO much to a movie) and repackage it and make a ton of money off it too. Talk about lazy and uninspired.",1445212800,,5426,4.351778656126482
7330480,2,B0118S73VG,"Villains have a few sequences of note but story is so poorly told that the monsters aren't nearly as scary as they should be. They're definitely not individual enough, no specific monster is identified and no one spearheads the attacks on the family so there is violence, but it's too vague. Their youngest is attacked, as are all of them, but neither the family nor the audience know who. The psychics give a why, but they're just guessing. The villains are far too poorly constructed.
Story strength:
(1) acting.
Story weaknesses:
(1) real world and the story:
(a) how do two unemployed people with three children, rent/buy a house, buy food, pay their credit card bills, etc. The film makes a point of informing the audience that there's no money coming in, but fails to explain how the family is surviving. With no income you might expect tension between the parents, fights about money, an inability perhaps to buy school supplies, but all seems to be fair sailing between them. When the house destroys their teenager's cell phone the dad goes out and replaces it, the film doesn't show how he does that, though it previously showed that two out of three of his credit cards were over the limit.
(b) their youngest child, she's maybe 7 or 8, is kidnapped and the parents do not inform the police, fearing they won't be believed. The thing is, the house demonstrates it is evil to anyone who enters it and it is not at all shy. When the family turns to psychics for help, the house starts messing with the psychics. Reasonable to assume that the police would've witnessed such behavior as well, and frankly, just not believable that a couple with a missing 7 year old, who are not involved with the kidnapping, would fail to report it.
(c) when a celebrity psychic arrives to help the family the teenager is so celebrity-struck that she begins making joke(s) in an attempt to interact with him, this despite the fact that the house had recently attacked her with quicksand, and that her younger brother had been attacked by an evil tree, and that her little sister has been kidnapped.  The teen's comment: ""this house is not clean"" sticks out and illustrates that the story itself doesn't take the threat of the poltergeist seriously. If the story doesn't take it's villain seriously, why should we.
(d) cynical tech - when the house gives the technician an awful vision, instead of packing up and leaving asap, he doesn't mention it and returns to work. The visions the house gives the inhabitants are not discussed by them, and these are some really frightening visions that you'd expect people to talk about. It's not believable when the characters suck it up and don't exhibit any emotional distress. Doesn't reflect how you'd expect people to behave given these horrendous stressors.
The acting is the best thing in this story. Most of the actors do decent, not stellar, work.",1445126400,3,2885,4.747011952191235

7330488,1,B0118S73VG,"I was told that the scariest part of this movie was the clown--let's be fair clowns are scary and Stephen King just drilled that into us with It. All creepy dolls are creepy, clowns more so than most. But the truly frightening thing in this movie was the squirrel. Beware of squirrels! They can just eff up your attic and terrorize your family, who is rather unmoved by all the freaky going on in their new haunted home, yet yell and scream when faced with a glorified tree rat.

Clowns < Squirrels.

I have found few remakes that are comparable to their original stories, and this one is pretty horrible at best. The plot is roughly the same, but the storyline is poorly rearranged. The key events are condensed, and it felt like an episode of a tv show rather than a film. The racing-pacing is so brisk that the anticipation that existed in the original Poltergeist movie is completely lost because the tension isn't allowed to build in any meaningful way. The focus of the movie was on Griffin (Robbie) the young boy, not Madison (Carol Anne). It is a device used so you care about his character growth and emotional journey but what it does is dilute the shallow story to a bare trace of substance. This sort of cinematic catastrophe has happened under the screenplay writing of David Lindsay-Abaire who had his fingers in Oz the Great and Powerful which was also poorly done.

The most disastrous plot point is that the father, played by Sam Rockwell, has absolutely no investment in the home or neighborhood. In the 1982 film, Craig T. Nelson's character, Steve Freeling was part of the corporation that built the family home and he slowly gets clued into the habit they have of buying cheap land where cemeteries are to expand their communities. The betrayal being that, his work has created the terror his family is forced to go through. There is a choice he has to make between success and family. Questions about what brought the activity in their home and not neighbors could be debated about since you know he is guilty of disturbing the rest of those buried there, whether he was aware of it or not. He bares the burden. You could also theorize about the familial roles and contentions. There is no meat on this 2015 version for one to what if?

Eric Bowen has lost his job, has no money, the family is pretty much without roots, the Bowens are trivial vagabonds at basics. The paranormal/supernatural tale of new people moving into a home and raising the attention of the dead just doesn't work here. Steven Spielberg wouldn't write such a vapid narrative and he must have cried at this retelling. The escalation: start to end is so rushed that there is no story structure saying why the audience should care. Its really hard to sit through, but so short you could miss a handful of momentous happenings if you nod off. Dont worry though because **SPOILER ALERT** nothing about this film will stir you.

This is an unsuccessful horror because it leans hard on visual effects rather than psychology. It's hard to be afraid of something that can be written off as CGI. A film that leaves you with that need to sleep with a nightlight because you go home wondering, ""could this happen in real life?"" is mental magic that leaves you with something to worry about later. How many of us wondered if all pea soup came from harvesting it from those with demonic possessions after the Exorcist. Its what happens in between normal life and hell that makes people scared.

I recommend the original of this film from the early 80s so you can see good storytelling. Then if you have curiosity watch this adaption somewhere FREE, it's not worth your money.

And one last thought: No one other than Zelda Rubinstein should ever say, ""THIS HOUSE IS CLEAN."" ~That right there is blasphemy and I hope their is a Tangina Curse to punish all parties involved with that sacrilege.",1445040000,2,3873,4.62882096069869

Well I guess my positivity has died like this movie should have. First thing that I found bad about the film was the idea to change the set up of the film with the family moving into the house that's already haunted. In the original film I think the most disturbing part was the fact that the ghost invaded the peacefulness and safety of their home thus making the first psychological attack on the family. In the remake the family moves in and boom the ghost are there, nothing is built up for the family to feel that their safe home is being invaded. I do agree with the majority of the people who say the acting is sup par and the over all pacing of the film felt rushed and the ending was pretty much a joke, I mean the whole family experience this traumatic event and then they are all seen laughing like it was a fun time. The only 2 good things about this film are that I got to see it for free so I don't lose any money just my time that I won't get back.

If I didn't have such high expectations I probably would be giving it a higher rating, but it's not as bad as you might have heard either. With a raft full of respected character actors and some wise tweaks to the story-line, this should have been better. For example, the suburbs means something completely different now than they meant in the 80's, and this movie addresses that. It also shows us some extra-dimensional space we didn't see in the original film. The CGI is actually quite good, and definitely an homage to Tobe Hooper's wispy ghost effects in the original. I think what rates it down from a nostalgia contact high is that the actors, good as they are, are not going for it. They're not phoning it in, but they are downplaying it too much.

Especially when the original was as awesome as 1982's ""Poltergeist.""  All in all, this was full of plot holes, had no eerily, suspenseful ""what the hell is going on here"" build up, and a resulting movie that generally comes off as ""we knew it was terrible and we had run out of budget so let's just get something out there.""

His wife is going to write a book. They are downsizing their home and moving into a community that already has a lot of foreclosures. Apparently he didn't need a bank loan. We know the drill, cemetery, power lines, ""Poltergeist"" mowed into the lawn (opening sequel) but no swimming pool.

Their son Griffin (Kyle Catlett) is afraid of his own shadow and sleeps in the attic with left over clown dolls and wild squirrels. Kennedi Clements plays Madison, the little girl. Personally I preferred Heather O'Rourke.

In our update, the poltergeist have a plethora of electronic devices to haunt and it seems modern smart phones have a app to locate them. Rockwell plays his typical semi-disagreeable character. Zelda Rubinstein has no equal so they opted for a TV show tough paranormal hunter (Jared Harris). I enjoyed the special effects and the use of the sound track. It was a professional production, not some ""B"" movie hack job.

I saw the original Spielberg Poltergeist back the 80's and I was familiar with the charm and awe inspiring acting and visual effects of that true cinematic classic. I found that the story line of this remake had taken a different turn on many aspects. This version relied more on today's spooky formula of shock and surprise to get the goose bumps going rather than solid character acting and state of the art special effects which in the original film still amaze and create awe in the viewers eyes. Actor Jared Harris gives a good performance as the male version of the original female ghost hunter/spiritual house cleaner, but beyond that, none of the other characters drew much appeal, even the character of the little girl ""Madison"" was not as endearing as that of ""Carol Ann"" in the original ""Poltergeist"" so I can't really say that I would see this movie again but I'm glad that I finally satisfied my curiosity about it.",1444608000,,1036,4.575268817204301

I have to say that I did like certain parts of the film - parts they never showed in the original Poltergeist, but all the same I do like it.  Now, the guy who tries to drill a whole in Maddy's closet isn't what I'd call very intelligent.  The original Poltergeist had JoBeth Williams doing the central part with trying to rescue her children from a demonic esophagus that came through the children's closet, and Craig T. Nelson doing his part as a wonderful father.  Sam Rockwell did a good job, but not the greatest, and the Rosemarie DeWitt in this new version did okay as semi-emotionally charged parents (note: Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams were very charged when they did the very first Poltergeist movie in 1982.  This new version needed more involvement from the characters than what was given.

Sam Rockwell tried to liven things up and had some moments of good humor but other than that it seemed like a cheap thrill movie. In addition, Jared Harris's talents were wasted with a bad script. The only freaky thing that I saw in the movie was the uncanny resemblance between (minus the blonde hair) Kennedi Clements and the original Heather O'Rourke.

7330712,3,B0118S73VG,"I, like many others watching this, am a big fan of the original.  I found the remake to be an okay movie that is inferior to the original, but is still entertaining to watch.  For the most part, I understand what they were trying to do with this movie, but I think that it just didn't work out the way that they wanted it to.  I've highlighted some of the things that they were trying to do, but they just didn't work out right.  There may be some spoilers in here.

1.  I think to make the family more sympathetic, they made the dad recently unemployed.  So throughout the beginning of the movie, he is stressed over that while trying to provide for his family.  The thing is that this is not needed.  There are enough bad things that happen to the dad and his family that they did not need to add this extra issue to make the audience sympathetic to the family.  It just seemed like extra clutter that didn't need to be there.  Also, in the original, the dad's job was a big part of the story.  He worked for the land developer that built the neighborhood on the graveyard.  The boss became a mini-villain for the story and the scene with him seeing what he caused to happen to this family at the end of the movie was one of the great scenes in the movie.

2.  Perhaps to make the house creepier, they made it an old house instead of a new house like in the original.  Yes, older houses are scarier than newer houses, but it doesn't fit the story right.  Old haunted house movies are interesting because of the history of the house and what happened there.  In this movie, there is no history to the house, it is about the land where the house is built, the graveyard.  Since this is an old house, what happened to whoever lived there before?  When weird things started happening, why didn't they try to track down the previous owners to see what was up with the house?  You just can't create an old haunted house and not give it a history.

3.  The moment I saw the cover with the clown on it, I was worried that whoever made this move did not understand the original movie at all.  Yes, the clown toy in the original was one of the creepiest and most iconic parts of the movie, so I can see them wanting to focus on that in the new one.  The issue is that when they decided to do this, someone wanted to amp up everything and wanted as scary a clown as possible.  They did not understand the power of subtlety.  They missed the fact that clowns are already scary and they do not need to be MADE scary.  The original clown was creepy, but it also looked like the sort of toy that any kid might happen to have in their room.  I think all kids have some creepy toy in their room that some relative with bad taste gave to them and, for some reason, the kid never got rid of it.  I personally had this creepy monkey with a plastic face that wore clothes and shoes.  I think it was called ""Zippy""?  That is what made the scene in the original movie so scary.  Everyone could relate to the scene.  After seeing the movie, when they are in their room and they see that creepy toy, it makes them think of that scene in the movie.  The TV show ""Goldbergs"" did that where the mom was moving the toy that scared Adam around his room to scare him after he watched Poltergeist.  The original Poltergeist was great because the scenes stuck with you.  The clown in the remake, though, doesn't look like anything you would ever find in any kid's room.  While watching the movie, you might think, ""That is a creepy-looking clown,"" but there is no sense that this might could happen to you and later, when you are home in your room alone, nothing is going to bring back the image of that clown.

 4.  In the original movie, weird things started happening long before Carol-Ann's abduction, and the family thought it was neat.  This isn't really the way that a normal family would react if chairs started moving across the floor, so I understand why they did not do any of this in the remake.  Explaining the behavior away as weird ex-hippie parents from the 60's is flimsy at best.  However, these scenes in the original were important for the buildup to the abduction.  They started to get under your skin long before things went really crazy.  Without that in the remake, they end up padding out the film with stuff about the dad being out of work and then all of a sudden, the abduction occurs.  They tried to add some buildup to what was going to happen, such as the baseball thing, but it wasn't as effective as the sliding chairs, which wasn't as blatantly malevolent, but still seemed very wrong to the audience.

5.  I saw another person's review that mentioned how sudden the ending of the film was.  I think this was due to an attempt to ""fix"" another ""flaw"" with the original.  After everything that the family went through, why in the world would they spend one more night in that house???  The remake tried to fix this by having the family try to leave right away after getting Maddy back, which is what makes the most sense for the family to do, but because of this, the whole final conflict sequence was much more compressed and anticlimactic than in the original where they had one more night to spend in the house.  Sometimes, the most realistic behavior isn't what is right for a movie.

6.  I think in order to put the movie more from a kid's perspective, they gave a bigger part to the Griff/Robbie character.  In the original, although the movie featured the whole family, it seemed to focus on the mom's point of view more and the relationship most focused on in the movie was the mother-child bond.  The new movie tries to view things more from Griff/Robbie's perspective, though, so you see more of the brother-sister bond, but you lose a lot from the mother-child bond, which was really a core element from the original.  The mother doing anything to save her child really makes more sense than the brother doing anything to save his sister.  I think even to a kid, a kid is going to see the parents as the ones who take care of you and will be the ones who will do anything to protect you, which would make the original more relatable than the remake, even though the remake is specifically trying to be more relatable to the kids.

Another miss in the new movie is the soundtrack.  Surely they had the rights to the original Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack from the first movie, so why didn't they use it?  They could have at least written new music that incorporated the familiar tunes from the original.  Like every other Spielberg movie, one of the things that made the original so memorable was the soundtrack.  I haven't watched the original in years, but just thinking of that movie I can hear that sweet yet haunting tune playing.  The new movie had okay orchestral music playing throughout it, but there were no specific themes that stood out from it that would be playing again in your mind years, or even seconds, after watching the film.  If they really wanted to capture the spirit of the original, they should have incorporated the original tune somewhere in the movie.

They did do some things right in the movie, though.  I thought they did a good job of capturing the feel from the original in some of the family banter, such as when they were driving in the car to the new house at the beginning.  And I thought the casting was pretty good.  I really liked Sam Rockwell as the dad and the teenage girl wasn't nearly as annoying as the one in the original.  I especially liked where she was putting the younger kids to bed, showing how she did care for her siblings.  For the most part, as a standalone movie, it wasn't that great, but it did a good job of reminding us of the original and what a great movie that one was.  No matter how much people are complaining about how this movie did not need to be made, how many people went back and rewatched the original for the first time in years after watching this?  It at least accomplished that.",1444176000,,7968,4.367097212780421

The roles that Craig T.

I loved the original Poltergeist and still think it's the best haunted house movie ever. This remake brought nothing new or interesting to the table. I think the big difference between this remake and the original is that in the original you really liked the familyand of course Zelda Rubenstein was so memorable. The family in this remake is forgettable. There were no really memorable scenes either. I guess the one modern touch is that they used a drone with a camera on it to go into the spirit worldbut what was in there was just a bunch of dark and amateur looking CGI. I'm surprised they didn't do anything really with all the bodies left in the ground. That could have been a cool update to the original: have it become kind of a zombie movie at the end with the poltergeist ghosts put back in the ground and have all the bodies come up. That would have been a change from the original worth watching. Maybe when they remake this again in 20 years they will think of that. I'm glad I saw this so I can have another example of a remake that didn't bring anything special and really didn't need to be made. It's not the worst movie I saw this year, but it is a reminder of why I rarely go see movies in theaters anymore.

How on earth do you buy a house when the dad isn't working, nor is the mother (who's an author by the way, but not writing ...??????). And I'm sorry, but are the kids theirs or is one or more adopted or foster care? That wasn't really made clear. When Eric, the dad, goes to the hardware store his purchase was declined on two cards so he busts out a third. Dude, you don't freaking work! So then the next shot is him flipping out in his car, then he gets home and (this is where I was like - WTF?????) he gives the oldest daughter a BRAND NEW CELL PHONE - NICE ONE TOO, the son gets a huge four bladed drone that's easily worth far more than they can afford, he gets his wife some bling and she stands there awestruck.

Everyone was likable. They all actually had decent lines like someone actually cared if the dialog was good.

10 times better than most new scary movies all over these sites.

Now, the main cons. Not enough real scares. In the first one, the swimming pool scene with the bodies all over, that was such a drawn out intense nightmare filling scene.this needed to go heavier in a couple spots.

I will certainly say,it's one young teens and parents can watch together.

If you have never seen the original, this movie will be a nice scary treat.  If you have seen the original, this will be a neat curiosity.  In either case, you do NOT want to waste money buying this.

One reason for this is the writing.  The characters accept some insane paranormal situations with ease.  They hop to action as if it's no big deal to enter another dimension filled with nasty spirits.  People smile or giggle at the most inappropriate times.  They make cute jokes.  The teen is made out to be a useless bizzotch, yet the little boy is quite a cool character.  Which makes no sense, in my opinion.  If your sister was inside a TV, you would take things seriously and be on the verge of a mental breakdown.

The effects are excellent.  They are not explained at all.  The acting is wonderful.  But the dialogue and lack of development in some scenes really ruins the mood.

It's as if the movie could not decide if it wanted to be funny and campy or serious horror--which, as we all know, spells death for a horror movie.

When writing a moving genre film you really have to have the characters take things seriously to make it scary.  You have to have people acting realistically.  This movie fails to do so.

But if it's your first dip into this kind of film, go for it.  It has a few scares and freaky moments.  If you're a veteran, pass it by.",1443571200,,1628,4.269736842105263

It lacked suspense to begin with so the comic relief was overkill. There was no chemistry between any of the cast. I was often bored and it didn't keep my attention. You aren't really scared and when the ghosts appear you don't really feel for the family either. Its not even a remake so it doesnt stick to the original plot line w the preacher and the cemetery.

One night, while the parents are away the house comes alive, and when they get back they are horrified to find that their little girl is missing. The real terror occurs when they find out where she went to. When people ask me what the scariest movie I have ever seen is I always answer the same way, the original Poltergeist. I was about 10 when I saw it, and to this day I still get chills when I think of it. With that mind set, I was nervous to watch this movie. I finally got up the nerve and half way through I realized something, I was wrong to be worried. The movie wasn't that bad and they stayed pretty true to the original, but it was lacking the real horror aspect to it. The original just had some aspect to it that worked, this one was missing something to make it truly scary. Overall, not that bad of a movie but another example as to why not every movie needs a remake. Especially if you can't make it better than the original.

I saw the original Poltergeist in a ""movie palace"" in 1982 and it remains one of my fondest movie memories.  About the remake I thought ""Why?""  Well, in Hollywood, the phrase seems to be ""Why Not?""  And so a friend and myself sank ourselves into a cineplex seat and experienced this new Poltergeist.  And ... actually enjoyed it.  More than I thought I would.  I even found myself admiring a lot of it.  It's not the summer of '82, but this ""cover version"" of a classic isn't merely a color-by-numbers affair.  The movie addresses the concerns of home-buyers in the 21st century and how much one will go through to see the dream of home ownership come true.  Sam Rockwell is especially sympathetic in his role of man trying to assemble this dream for his family in the wake of 21st century odds.  The paranormal investigative team is very watchable, and likable, the standouts being Jared Harris and Jane Adams.  This movie may not have the memorable ""This house is clean"" Tangeena of the original, but it does provide worthy adversaries for the houseful of poltergeists.  And what it has over the first movie is subtle: the reaction of the family and ghost hunters seems to me to be more believable in this film.  In the final act of the original, everyone seemed to take time out to scream for long periods of time, making the climax a frantic and ""screamy"" affair.  This movie tones down the screams, I think to good effect.  This movie is not destined to be a classic, but as an exercise in trying to capitalize on a brand name, it holds its head up nicely.

I like Sam Rockwell's work as well so I decided to give this version a try.  I watched it, hoping at least I could say this is the ""Poltergeist version for Millenials"" but it just falls totally short of he original.  Heather O'Rourke as Carol Ann(Maddie) in the original was perfect in the roll and although this new little girl is a good little actress I preferred all the acting of the original children to these new kids.  Maybe if I had never seen or heard of the '82 version this one wouldn't have left me so disappointed and maybe they shouldn't be compared but I highly recommend anyone who is thinking of watching it, just see the original instead.  You can't beat Spielberg's touch, even on horror.  I noticed they sorta set it up for a part 2.  All I can say on that is I hope they don't bother.",1442534400,,1104,4.116822429906542

I guess there's some ""slick"" new CGI now, but the original's FX are arguably superior. Replacing the memorable little, kooky psychic woman with a bland, average man is yet another strangely poor decision and missed opportunity emblematic of the filmmakers' inability to not only improve on the original, but sour the first film's greatness. This dumb logic to replace the original's classic elements with something equal or inferior is why the project is ultimately forgettable.

Mother wasn't much better, the teenager was not believable, because she wasn't afraid, staying to participate in ""the search"".

7330847,4,B0118S73VG,"I didn't have really high hopes for this movie.  The trailer didn't impress me.  I was wondering why they felt like they had to remake the classics, but after watching the original...I started understanding.  There are many things that have changed since the 1980s as far as how we view things.  Though I realize that back then we didn't have the concepts we do today, sometimes watching the movies from the time period I grew up in can be awkward because of the weird sexual innuendo we didn't realize was inappropriate then and the quiet prejudice.

When I actually watched this movie, I was impressed more.  There are some things the original does much better--for instance, the ""they're here"" scene and the end scene where the house gets swallowed up and the bodies come out of the ground.  The poltergeist of the new version are more subtle--they are more into blinking lights, though they do have better stacking abilities.  The pace was good.  I liked that they showed the ""in-between"".  I thought the actors were decent.  I didn't think I would like the guy that plays the Tangina role...but he was charismatic.

This movie didn't seem like it was trying to compete with the original.  It had some of the elements of the original, but it seemed to do its own interpretation and its own thing.  I like that.  It allows you to enjoy the merits of both old and new Poltergeist.",1442188800,2,1382,4.652892561983471

The ""scares"" were so hamfisted and melodramatic that I felt annoyed when they occurred.  Oh, there was a scary clown doll in the original?  Let's make it a demonic looking clown doll this time that fell out of a mysterious crawl space, along with a dozen other clown dolls, which the boy is apparently required to keep in his bedroom, despite his obvious fear of them.

Can you even get static snow on a digital TV?  If the answer is, ""Ghosts could do it"", my question is ""Why would they?""  That's just an aside.  It was just so heavy handed.  The ""scares"" were a lot like telling a story but having to dumb it down a lot, so someone really stupid could still follow it.

The parents move to the big home, despite the fact that the mother is not working, so she can become a writer (despite admitting that she isn't actually writing), and the father just lost his job.  He's having to play credit card musical chairs to be able to buy dinner on his credit cards, but for some reason they decided to buy a house.  The ""attic"" room that they choose for their nervous child has a sink in one corner and a strange crawl space, like it's an old home, for no reason.  The parents come off, at best, as disinterested in their children.  They ignore the youngest child, even when she acts out; they coddle the teen, who is openly demanding and prone to histrionics (to the point of being verbally abusive); and they belittle and even ridicule their son for... pretty much, just acting like a normal child (The mother suggests that they take him to a psychiatrist, after he gets upset about not having his nightlight on in a new house, after they let him play zombie video games on the way to the house).  By the time I got to the real haunting, I was checking my watch to see how much longer it was going to be and hoping that they whole family would die and leave the son to go to a new, nice home, where he wasn't called a baby by his mother for trying to tell her about something that had really scared him.

This movie was awful.  It wasn't even awful in that fun way that you can make fun of as you watch.  It was just bad, very bad.  As bad as they were, ""Poltergeist 2 & 3"" were better than this.

This isn't a re-make persay but more like how the new Evil Dead, Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Masacre movies were.  They were like an ""updated version"" you could say.  The problem is, all those movies i mentioned were very well done and amazing.  Poltergeist fell very short of those.

***** Maybe some spoilers *****

Poltergeist basically condensed the original movie into a very shorter version.  Doing this meant there was no character developement for any of the characters.  You knew really nothing about them and actually didn't care about them.  If you saw the original, the movie built up to everything and each event that happened did so here and there.  It didn't hit you all at once.  So you grew to actully relate and care about the characters then.  In the new version, you really had no idea why they moved for the most part and you didn't know much about them.  Then you were introduced to more characters and the whole thing took place in what felt like a night versus the original that you knew built up in months.

There were some current type of scares in a way but even the clown wouldn't give ANYONE nightmares like the orginal one.

I compare this to Evil Dead (the new one) because it was telling a similar story but not a sequel, yet Evil Dead actually turned it into its own new version and succeeded and was amazing.

To sum up, this new version took the original version and condensed it so much to where everything seemed to happen like bang bang bang and done.  You had no clue who any of the characters were.  Even in the original version you actually felt something with the paranormal people who came into the house and Tangina destroys the wannabe version in this new version.

I went into this new Poltergeist with an open mind, because it couldn't help but be different movie.  I have to admit that I didn't hate this new one!!!!  I did truly enjoy it once I allowed it to be its own movie.  It's hard NOT to compare the two, but they were both handled so differently.  There were some stellar performances, speeches and moments of the original which they didn't even try to repeat or remake.  That was a little disappointing.  And, the entire movie has a completely different feel.  A very dark feel.  No magic.  There was no whimsy that easily turned into horror once it was too late.  Spoiler?  There's no Tangina Barrons.  Carrigan Burke (played by Jared Harris) replaces that character.  I was fine with it, but he could have been developed more.  I think they short cut a lot.  I was disappointed that Rosemarie DeWitt was never given the chance to be the heroine that JoBeth Williams was as a Mother who did anything to save her child.  (I think this movie was more Sam Rockwell's vehicle.)  And, Kyle Catlett was clearly the movie's true star as Griffin.  Even more so than Kennedi Clements who played young Madison.

This remake is a slavish copy that alters probably less than 10% of the original script, adds some CG, and product-places a number of Apple gadgets throughout. Somehow they even manage to make a drone a major component in rescuing the little girl. And there's a clown on the front cover for some reason.

If there were a Razzie Award for Most Unnecessary Film of the Year, this would surely win. In the 'quality drift' problem being faced by Hollywood in the last decade, this fim might well mark the point where they switched strategy. Instead of stranding audiences with unnecessary sequels, prequels and second-rate superhero nonsense, they cut straight to the chase by doing shot-for-shot remakes of classics from the 70s and 80s.

The children are 2 dimensional, like someone wrote stereotypes of what they think 2 children and a teen sound like. Mom's just kind of there.

The acting is on par as well, but the movie always feels like its missing something.

It just seems like a paint-by-numbers deal. As inferior to the original as a remake can possibly get. People saying don't judge it by the original are ridiculous people. It's silly to tell people to pretend this or that, that it's a sequel or that one needs to do something to their mind in order to accept and appreciate it.

Contains minor spoilers

The down-on-their-luck Bowen family move into their new residence in a quiet working class suburb. Due to economic hardships, they had to downsize and although their new home is not the house of their dreams, it is within their budget and their youngest daughter Madison, instantly falls under its spell. Soon, creepy things begin to happen to the Bowen family's children; the emotionally fragile Griffin, begins to get teased by otherworldly forces while Madison begins to communicate with, what she calls, ""the lost people"" through her television set and on a dark, stormy night, while the parents are away and the oldest daughter, Kendra, begins receiving strange signals from her smart-phone, a tree attacks and a child is lost. ""They're coming"" ..... ""They're here"" and a child now resides in the land of the dead. Mwahahahahahahaha!!!

Directed by Gil Kenan, ""Poltergeist"" (2015) is a totally unnecessary remake of a horror classic. Since we are living in the age of remakes, this should come as no surprise and although the film is polished, slick in its execution and made up of a cast of good actors, it does pale when compared to the original even if that film is over 30 years old. It is a shame that the makers of this film decided to create a generic ghost story, following a formula we have seen countless times. Whether you love the original or not, we cannot deny the impact it had on not only the horror genre but audiences that went to see it in the theatre in the summer of 1982. ""Poltergeist"" (1982) was not a generic horror movie and treating it as if it was, is a bit disrespectful. It became iconic and breathed new life to a genre that prior was mostly saturated by low-budget slashers and low-grade horror movies that were easily forgettable. It was also nominated for 3 Oscars and set the bar high for cinematic ghost stories. It paved the way for more high-tech tales of terror and delivered its message in a polished manner that was incredibly well acted and had a certain finesse, not to mention Jerry Goldsmith's score was haunting as it was beautiful. The remake decided not to out-do the original; it doesn't even try to. In fact, the makers actually watered down the story. Why? I have no clue. Kenan - if you are reading this, please enlighten me.

Considering I have so much to complain about, why am I giving this 3.5 stars? Well, my rating comes as a surprise to me also but I am capable of completely ignoring the fact that this is a remake and I am judging this as a horror movie first and foremost. As a horror film, it is competently made. It does not lack polish, the effects work is mostly high-tech (I could of used less CGI) and the actors all do their jobs well. It also moves along at a brisk pace and is indeed much faster paced than the original but this is not necessarily a bonus. I will say what I can in the remakes favor but I will distinguish the major differences between the two and why, in my opinion, the original remains superior.

Poltergeist (1982) took its time to build up the tension and to let the audience really get to know the main characters. Also, it seemed like Carol Anne Freeling was missing for days, weeks- an eternity; Madison, a mere 20 minutes. The family here is likable enough but only just. The kids are adorable but the relationships established are rushed- the adorable Madison (Kennedi Clements - who bears a striking resemblance to the late Heather ORourke but with brown hair) is under-utilized and we see only a couple of scenes that display her interactions with her family and with those pesky poltergeists prior to her abduction (the original would establish the childs importance from the very first opening sequence) while her brother, Griffin (Kyle Catlett), is a scaredy cat, more of an emotional wreck. His character is given a bit more depth and is the most fleshed out. The oldest daughter, Kendra (Saxon Sharbino) is given more to do here than the original films oldest daughter Dana, however she seems to be the least likeable of the siblings. More screen time is not necessarily a good thing and the pretty Kendra just comes across as a whiny teenager more interested in her shiny new gadgets than anything of substance. The parents - Eric and Amy Bowen (Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie Dewitt) are good but lack the charm of Steve and Diane Freeling but the comparison may not exactly be fair. The family dynamics here are different; the Bowens are different- struggling, impatient, down on their luck, desperate. Rockwell delivers in his performance with a couple of emotional scenes and his charm is intact; I just wished Dewitt would have been given more moments to shine, like JoBeth Williams, where we see more of her pain and anguish from the loss of her youngest child. The shorter running time of the theatrical cut did not allow much of anything as far as the family dynamic is concerned and this is a shame since this is what made the original so touching as well as terrifying.

One of the greatest characters in a horror movie and in the ""Poltergeist"" franchise, is that of mystical Tangina Barrons (played by the late Zelda Rubenstein)- the psychic dwarf who was called upon to investigate the strange occurrences and to try to figure out how to bring back little Carol Anne. She has no more than 15 minutes of screen-time, but she not only manages to steal the spotlight from the other actors (JoBeth Williams being the sole exception), she delivers one of the most iconic monologues ever in a fright film. Her performance is perfection and her delivery of the lines ""to her, it simply is another child; to us, it is the Beast,"" or ""Now clear your minds, it knows what scares you"" or ""this house is clean"" have become as legendary to the fans as her character. Unfortunately for the remake, the ""house cleaner"" these makers dreamed up doesn't even come close to matching the mysticism of Tangina. There is no haunting monologue- one that explains the mechanisms at play and why Madison was chosen by the ""lost people"" for abduction. The ghost whisperer they concocted here is a reality TV star who has his own ghostly show on TV - Carrigan Burke (Jared Jarris). He is competent enough and has enough history in the supernatural to do the job but despite his great accent and a gnarly scar, this character is not even in the same universe as Tangina. His explanations for the occurrences are also much too brief; it is to the point but that emotional monologue that had the Freelings and the other paranormal investigators cowering with fear is sorely missed. Another missed opportunity amidst a sea of missed opportunities.

The scares are here but mostly in the form of the all too familiar jump-scare. I would not have had too much of an issue with this had they not shown every single ""scare"" shot in the theatrical trailers (big mistake). The extended edition provides a bit more substance and it is a definite improvement. The iconic scenes from the original that are replicated (but not topped) are a few. Many were not even attempted and the climax, although it starts off great, ends too abruptly with minimal spooks and cadavers on display and this is where this got it wrong. ""Poltergeist"" (1982) saved the best for last. The supernatural chaos that was unleashed on the Freeling's and Cuesta Verde during those last 10 minutes are some of the most iconic scenes in horror - For those who have not seen the original *SPOILER ALERT*: a clown attack, the attack on Diane by the unseen ""Beast"" which then materializes in front of the children's bedroom door, the corpse's pit, the pulsating esophagus, the many coffins and a house imploding and sucked into a void; all are thrown at the viewer at a frenetic pace while the team at ""Industrial Light and Magic"" really used their talents and imagination to create some really effective set pieces done optically and by the use of old-school practical effects. The scene that came out the best in the remake was the clown attack. We are introduced to the smirking clown (and his friends) early on and when the attack finally happens, it is effective however if you saw the trailer, you saw most of this scene so it will most likely be ineffective - seriously whomever did the marketing for this film deserves to be [insert mode of severe punishment here]. The 2015 tree attack is merely a footnote and does not compare to the monstrosity of a tree that terrorized Robbie Freeling in the original. The extended edition expands on this scene by a few chilling seconds and I am scratching my head as to why an edited version of this sequecne was released theatrically. The TV sequence is brief and well done and when viewed in surround sound, it is chilling. There are a few other surprises included that may provide a quick jolt but nothing to torture your nights or provide nightmares. The gore? There is none and there was not even an attempt to reproduce one of the most talked-about scenes in the original- Marty's midnight snacks and hallucination.

So what's there to like? Good performances aside, there is the humor and as mentioned, the special effects are solid. There are also moments of wonderment; there is a beautifully filmed sequence where a young child is seduced by the spirits as beautiful goblets of light emanate from a bedroom lamp. It is serene but ultimately chilling in it's quiet seduction knowing that something sinister lies behind it all. The child's face is emotionless but with a touch of awe. In another scene, we see a teenager being lured into a cold, dark room where evil has sinister plans for her and another brief scene where tree branches menacingly scrape against a window- taunting and torturing a child who will soon be under attack. It is moments like these that elevates this remake to higher levels and if it hadn't been for the trailer giving everything away, there would have been more surprises. The cinematography is gorgeous and the film simply looks good on a technical level. I saw this in 3-D so I have yet to see how well this will transfer to my TV screen. I am also forgiving because, regardless of all the passionate hate geared towards this film (I think it is exaggerated especially considering people who haven't even seen it have given this film a ""1"" in IMDB by admission), in my opinion, I found other remakes to be far worse- ""Psycho"" (1998), ""The Haunting"" (1999),""The Fog"" (2005), ""Black Christmas"" (2006), ""Halloween"" (2007), ""A Nightmare on Elm St"" (2010) and countess others. After all, there is no accounting for taste.

The Blu-ray includes 2 versions of the film - Theatrical and Extended. The extended cut is superior but not by much. There are a couple of minor moments added that provide more family dynamics and a couple of scenes that may provide a chill or 2; my favorites being the expanded tree sequence and a brief scene in the basement. There are other extras which includes an alternate ending (forgettable), a gallery (not too extensive), theatrical trailers but nothing mind-blowing. The film does looks great- crisp, clean; the images are much clearer than they were in the theatres when I watched this in 3-D. Overall, the picture and sound are top-notch.

So what is my conclusion? Give it a view but try judging it objectively; base your opinion on its own merits because comparing it to the classic film it attempts to mimic, well, it falls far short. ""Poltergeist"" (1982) can continue basking in its glory- it remains an undisputed classic unhurt by time and by this remake- but these new poltergeists do have something to offer as far as PG-13 rated chills and thrills are concerned and I have to admit, I do love that clown....oh and that pesky squirrel too.

8723854,3,B0118S73VG,"I first saw the original ""Poltergeist"" when it was showing on the big screen, and since back then I was at a more impressionable age, that film has had a special place in my heart ever since (that someone stole my wallet while I had my eyes fixed on the screen did not exactly add to the overall enjoyment but made my visit to the cinema unforgettable in its very own way).

That being said, I did not find the remake as bad as I had feared. While in my eyes it never reaches the class of the original, it has its moments, and I liked the little subplot about a young boy facing his fear and finding his courage. Comparing original version and remake, I also find it interesting and telling that the new script is about a family down on their luck rather than one for which moving house means moving up.

What I did miss is the special sense of producer Steven Spielberg's humor that added such a nice touch to the original version (and of course that one brought forth one of Jerry Goldsmith's finest symphonic scores), and I also missed moments that were really scary (I may be a bit jaded, though).

To cut things shirt: Whether you're a fan of the original version or not doesn't really make a difference - the remake is definitely not a must-see. On the other hand, I feel that there are quite a few remakes out there that are a greater waste of time than this one.

The actors weren't even properly scared. If my daughter was sucked inside a TV screen I'd be beside myself with panic and horror. I'd probably be certifiable. The son, for whatever reason, is exposed to the oddities occurring in the house first and no one believes him. Then when they find out he is right, they don't even apologize for being such terrible parents. (The parents question whether they should have had him, don't listen to his fears, and push him aside). The paranormal expert, formerly played by the irreplaceable Tangina was weak in her role and unconvincing. There were some scenes that were so terribly done I couldn't imagine who wrote it such as the scene when the tree bursts through the window to snatch the son. In the original movie the purpose of the scene was to distract the parents while the poltergeists went after Carol Anne. In this movie, the parents are gone, negating the significance of the scene, and when the parents do arrive from a dinner that only served the purpose of disclosing the fact that their house was built on a graveyard, the tree immediately drops the child. Hell, he could have climbed it and gotten tangled in its branches for all they know on sight. They also tried to squish scenes form Poltergeist 2 in into this one movie such as the tequila worm scene. This movie is a mockery and disservice to the the far superior original. I couldn't even make it to the end. Do you self a favor and  don't spend a dime on this trash.
Update: I watched the ending, just because I wanted to give a valid review for the movie in its entirety. What do you know? They also squished some of the 3rd movies action scenes into the ending. I think they did this because they knew they would never get a green light for a sequel. The iconic scene where Tangina discloses what the poltergeists are and what they want with Carol Anne is one of the more terrifying scenes in horror movie history. The Irish priest/ghost chaser completely ruins the scene with his butchered explanation. The ending of the movie is both cheesy and and rushed. This is not just a case of comparing a great movie to a bad one. Had the new writers and director treated this movie with the respect that it deserved, I would have wholeheartedly endorsed the remake, but it was as disappointing as the Nightmare on Elm Street remake. Hopefully hollywood will leave remakes alone and pick up a book that can be adapted to film instead.",1515888000,2,2584,4.568965517241379
