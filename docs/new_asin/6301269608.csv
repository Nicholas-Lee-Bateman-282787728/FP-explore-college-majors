8216513,5,6301269608,Great movie about real life and the real world that I can relate to concerning my own life other than I was never a priest but I was a brainwashed catholic for many many years.,1357084800,,176,4.057142857142857
8216514,2,6301269608,"AFTER SCHOOL IS THE STORY OF A STUDENT-TEACHER RELATIONSHIP.  FATHER MCCARREN ( SAM BOTTOMS) IS A YOUNG PROFESSOR.  SEPTEMBER JOHNSON (RENEE COLEMAN) IS HIS TOP STUDENT.  THEY DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP BUT IT IS NOT PHYSICAL.  THE MOST THEY DO IS KISS.  DO NOT BE FOOLED THINKING YOU ARE GETTING A SEX FILLED COMEDY.  (ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD OF MADE IT MUCH BETTER).  IT IS DEALING MORE WITH FATHER MCCARENS DECISION TO STAY TRUE TO HIS VOWS AS A PRIEST OR JUST BE A REGULAR MAN.  ALSO THERE ARE SCENES THAT FLASH BACK TO CAVEMAN TIMES THAT REALLY TAKE AWAY FROM THE MOVIE.  NOT THAT THERE IS MUCH TO TAKE.  THIS IS NOT THE WORST MOVIE EVER, ALTHOUGH MY REVIEW MAY SEEM THAT WAY, IT WAS JUST VERY SLOW AND NEVER REALLY TOOK OFF.  I WAS EXPECTING SO MUCH MORE AND WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I DID NOT GET IT.",1215734400,,796,4.346938775510204
