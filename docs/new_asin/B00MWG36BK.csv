8675065,4,B00MWG36BK,"This is a great DVD!  It gives you every Robot Chicken Christmas related episode!  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the Dragonball Christmas episode is the edited version, and bleeps out all of the colorful language used by Santa!  Every other episode/special on this disc gives you the fully unedited language version.  It makes no sense why they would edit only this episode.",1483401600,2,397,4.7101449275362315
