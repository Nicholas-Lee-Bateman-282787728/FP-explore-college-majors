8029597,2,B0002NRRVA,Bloody Movie is a slasher movie and it sucks.,1483660800,,45,4.111111111111111
8029598,5,B0002NRRVA,It's called by its orginal title terror night it's a 80's classic to me it's good had some pretty good kills it's a lot better than the remakes that are coming out a lot better then some say. Basic plot teens go to what they thought was to be a dead actors house they were wrong. He kills them by reacting the secenes from his movies. Give it a try you'll like it.,1419638400,2,364,4.0
8029599,3,B0002NRRVA,"""Terror Night"" (also called ""Bloody Movie""). Standard horror set-up as a group of young adults provide the body-count after trespassing in old mansion. The film is given enough quirk and energy to sustain interest.

Plot centers around ""Lance Haywood"" (John Ireland), former screen idol presumed dead. Haywood kills each person according to different film roles. Great cast includes John Ireland, Cameron Mitchell, Alan Hale Jr., Dan Haggerty, Jamie Summers in bubble bath, Michelle Bauer running around naked, and a body ripped in half during the opening minutes. There are also sepia flashbacks to the killer's past screen glories, and a slashed-up head banger who fights to death with Haywood in knight's armor.

Plenty of movie posters of Haywood's films and a confusing and indifferent climax. It's like FADE TO BLACK with a great ode to old Hollywood.",1390435200,,857,5.248175182481752
8029600,4,B0002NRRVA,"Its about time I went out on a limb buying an old horror movie I never seen and was pleased afterwards. Good kill scenes!
You won't be disappointed if you are both a collector and a hunter looking for a new old horror movie to enjoy.",1383955200,,233,4.086956521739131
8029601,4,B0002NRRVA,"Never heard of this movie until I bought it. As a fan of slashers, I knew I had to have it. Great production values, however my only complaint is the fact that ******SPOILERS************READ NO FURTHER******* is that the killer, who is a silent movie star would be almost 90-100 years old. Yet he kills several people and overpowers them to boot. It was nice to see Grizzly Adams die by spear. A better then average slasher from a era when they were just spitting these out left and right.",1298505600,3,489,4.50561797752809
8029602,4,B0002NRRVA,"1920s screen legend, Lance Hayward (John Ireland) has been missing for twenty years. In 1987, he returns to murder anyone who trespasses on his long-deserted property. Of course, a group of six young preppie-types simply must visit Mr. Hayward's condemned mansion, and they have to do it late at night. This leads to many grisly deaths by impaling, decapitation, etc. A pair of randy bikers also shows up, adding to the number of victims. BLOODY MOVIE (aka: Terror Night) is a pretty grim affair w/ a surprisingly downbeat ending. On the up side, the biker chick (Michelle Bauer!!) makes sure there's a whole lotta naughtiness going on!  Recommended to all fright fanatics...",1228780800,,675,5.026785714285714
