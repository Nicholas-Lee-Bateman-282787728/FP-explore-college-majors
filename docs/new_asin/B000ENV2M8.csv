8111742,4,B000ENV2M8,"You are getting some great videos from some of the best motivational and informative speakers in the last 50 years. The videos are recorded back in the late 1990's, but again the information is timeless. Great videos to show at team meetings.",1329091200,,242,4.785714285714286
8111743,5,B000ENV2M8,"As an agency manager I have found this series of DVDs an invaluable tool for traing agents. Zig Ziglar's at his absolute best enthusiasm and information wise. Tom Hopkins as usual is a great sales professional trainer. George Walther was a first for me but he was helpful. Tony Alessandra is great with body language and non verbals. Jim Cathcart - Great with relationships Nido Qubein was also a first for me but he was very good. All in all the series went from vocal signals to vocabulary; connecting to closing, the Sales Success video suite offers hours of inspiration and practical tips to power-up your influence while building and expanding client relationships- a real sales training tool.",1193097600,,698,4.923728813559322
8111744,2,B000ENV2M8,"The only DVDs worth your money from this collection are Zig Ziglar's with an absolute 5 star and Tom Hopkins with a 4 star. The rest are really lame. Specially, the worst of all is the improvised speech by Qubein recommending to get the most expensive haircut in town to make you look as good as him and the story on how he purchased his two Mercedes Benz at the same time (where is the sales story here?). In the other two DVDs, half of the time the speakers waste time telling you personal family experiences that have nothing to do with sales at all. Including a 20 minute long recollection of how one of them survived an accident while flying his plane. Most DVDs are about one hour long.",1156982400,20,692,4.3307692307692305
