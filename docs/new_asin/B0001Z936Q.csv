2044432,5,B0001Z936Q,This is a great off the wall film. Good BBC production. Highly recommend.,1140652800,,73,4.6923076923076925
2044433,4,B0001Z936Q,"The title of this review doesn't refer to the film, but to the noble profession of selling vacuum cleaners, further ennobled by the door-to-door approach.  Marauders of the working class homefront, these sales blokes (it's a British film) pounce with ferocious, rapacious glee on the unsuspecting denizens of modularized same-look-in-every-unit apartment buildings.

One such--indeed, king of sales-driven ferocity--is Tommy Rag, an overweight, overwrought maniac whose own motivational tape (i.e., he recorded it himself)--""Sell, sell, sell, f**king sell, f**king sell""--is set to heavy metal music.  This is one of numerous hilarious pleasures of this intensely manic made-for-TV (BBC) film directed by Danny Boyle.  Played by Timothy Spall, Rag is anything but ragtag, but does manage to rag unto near-nervous breakdown his new protege, Pete (actor Michael Begley), a rookie salesguy who transitions from ""mixing cassettes for teenagers"" to selling vacs, all the better to insure that his stripper girlfriend won't leave him.

The script by Jim Cartwright is perfect, and is matched with Boyle's perfect direction to deliver a short (75-minute) film that couldn't be any longer and retain its power without flagging/fragging the viewer.  Spall is nothing short of miraculous here, an unstoppable force that seemingly only hurricane Ivan might bring down.  His intensity is so palpable you can feel yourself quaking, shaking, and roaring every time he makes an appearance (which is, in fact, most of the film).

A comic bash that pounds and astounds, Vacuuming Completely Nude in Paradise deserves a wider audience and more than makes up for Boyle's disastrous The Beach (w. Leonardo di Caprio; brilliant cinematography is its only saving grace) and lackluster A Life Less Ordinary.  This is a 2001 film and let's hope it signals Boyle's return to the intelligence and power evident in his first film, Shallow Graves.

Definitely recommended.  Guaranteed to induce hearty guffaws.",1094947200,8,1982,5.508250825082508
2044434,5,B0001Z936Q,"I'll always have fond memories of this movie.  I first saw it at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival, just 3 days after 9/11.  You won't find a much tougher crowd for a comedic movie to premiere to than the one assembled for this particular screening, but such is the power of this film's dark humor that it was able to evoke convulsive laughter even from an audience this somber.
Danny Boyle, who soared with the British films SHALLOW GRAVE and TRAINSPOTTING, then fell on his face with the Hollywood duds A LIFE LESS ORDINARY and THE BEACH, got back in form with this effort, reborn of the freedom that digital technology affords today's daring (and invariably under-financed) filmmakers. He's obviously fascinated with the limitless possibilities for camera placement that the technology affords, embedding miniature cameras all over the sets to permit individual scenes to be viewed from a rapid-fire succession of perspectives. His editing and music skills, combined with stellar camerawork by noted dogme cameraman Anthony Dodd Mantle, results in a raw, exciting new `dogme-MTV' type of look ... a look that Boyle put to good use in his subsequent hit, 28 DAYS LATER.
But `look' alone cannot make a movie. You still need a script to work with, and Boyle is blessed here with an outstanding one from Jim Cartwright. The story is nothing less than a bold and brilliant comedic re-conceptualization of Arthur Miller's DEATH OF A SALESMAN for the digital age.  And unlike Miller, Cartwright doesn't play coy with what the salesman is actually peddling -- you know right from the start that it's vacuum cleaners.
The `surrogate' character in this film is a likeable young slacker named Pete (Michael Begley) who loves dance music and has some mixing talent, but hasn't been able to carve out any kind of career in the music biz. His girlfriend has to perform strip-o-grams in order for them to make ends meet, and they both want out of this situation in the worst way. The girlfriend's plight gets especially humiliating one night when she performs at a retirement party for a vacuum cleaner salesman, and on a suggestion, Pete decides to pursue a career in this profession as a way out for both of them.
Enter the most blazing, mesmerizing, maniacal lead performance by an actor in many a moon. Pete is made an apprentice to star salesman Tommy Rag, played with incredible over-the-top intensity by veteran Timothy Spall. If there was an ABSOLUTE `best actor' award for the BEST performance, period, in a given year, Spall would have been my hands-down choice for 2001. He makes EVERY ruthless salesman in movie history (Kurt Russell in USED CARS, the gang from THE BOILER ROOM, etc.) look strictly `soft sell' by comparison. This is truly a performance for the ages ... ONE THAT NOBODY WITH A SALES JOB SHOULD MISS!
You may think that you've seen the `rookie paired with vet' thing done to death in the movies, both in dramatic and comedic contexts, but I can assure you that you've never seen anything even close to the `eye or the hurricane' variant that Boyle has come up with here. What he's managed to pack into little more than an hour's running time is astounding ... a fully realized comic tragedy of Shakespearean proportions that manages to be relentlessly and mercilessly funny.",1086652800,21,3287,4.855614973262032
8018732,3,B0001Z936Q,"Director Danny Boyle has a talented eye for unusual situations and dark comedy, and does a very good job here with one of the most peculiar commentaries about depressed western economies that I can remember. ""Vacuuming Completely Nude in Paradise"" has one of the greatest titles in film history, and has great performances from Michael Begley as Pete, a disillusioned young vacuum cleaner salesman apprenticing under the insane elder statesman of aspiradora sales, Tommy Rag, played by the brilliant Timothy Spall.

The film is filled with over-the-top moments like vacuum cleaner point of view shots and a brilliantly choreographed synchronized vacuum cleaner dancing routine to the tune of ""My Baby Takes The Morning Train"" by Sheena Easton at the Golden Vac Awards. Perhaps no scene is more visually searing (and funny) than the sight of Timothy Spall undressed in a flamenco seduction complete with castanets. (Oh the humanity!) I loved the contrast between Tommy and Pete, and the backstory that shows Tommy's downfall and Pete's increasing moral sensibility as the movie goes on. The pivotal scene at the Golden Vac Awards which results in no end of emoting from Tommy, ultimately culminating with flinging a vacuum into the Atlantic Ocean in a scene of great pathos is brilliantly staged.

The film runs about 75 minutes and even though it has lots of razor-sharp edits, it still seemed a bit overlong for the premise. The actors do a great job here, with Spall and Begley forming an absolutely perfect opposing duo highlighting the seedy side of vacuum cleaner sales; Spall is a great actor and truly convinces you of his single-sighted malevolence in this role, while Begley's journey of conscience is utterly brilliant.",1432771200,,1729,5.127659574468085
8018733,2,B0001Z936Q,"Big fan of Danny Boyle. But this is a lousy movie. Grainy, poor camera work. Choppy, annoying editing. Cardboard-cutout characters. Giving it 2 stars is being generous.",1407715200,,168,5.2592592592592595
8018734,5,B0001Z936Q,"I first saw this when I was in my early 20's.  As an aspiring electronic musician, I felt that I understood Pete's struggle.  Tommy Rag seemed like a monster.  Having had some experience in sales I had never seen anything like this.  Tommy embodies the worst of all aspects of a salesman imaginable.

However, upon making it to may late twenties, I took a second glace at this movie.  It was so different than I perceived it when I was younger.  Now, Pete seemed like a slacker, a know-it-all who knows nothing and hates himself; a proper teenager.  And, how Pete ruins Tommy's salesman competition win is just too much.

I find myself sympathizing for the devil I suppose, as Tommy Rag is anything but a good salesman.  But he has a passion, a passion to win the sales contest.  To make matters worse the internet in encroaching on the business he works for and salesmen are being let off.  The end of the movie is epic, but I feel that Pete deserves worse than he got.

An amazing movie.",1394841600,,989,4.427777777777778

8018736,5,B0001Z936Q,"At 76 minutes, I didn't hope for much in a full length movie, but what a surprise!  I was mesmerized from beginning to end by the intensity of Timothy Spall's acting.  He did an amaing job.  He should have gotten an academy award nomination at least!  He IS the movie.  I didn't even mind the ending because I enjoyed his acting so much.  Yes, ""over the top"" is quite right but really doesn't do justice to his performance.

I would recommend this movie just on his potrayal of this obsessed vacume cleaner salesman who doesn't just want to be No. 1 but has to be No. 1 at all costs.

He is funny while being deplorable, and even though you know he's wrong in his methods, in the end you want him to win because the very people denouncing him are actually worse.",1384819200,,762,4.27972027972028
8018737,4,B0001Z936Q,"""Death of a Salesman"" meets ""Glengarry Glenn Ross"" on acid, this portrait of the empty, horrible life of
door-to-door selling was made on the cheap in 20 days for the BBC. It has Boyle's characteristic energy,
and playful eye and a great, if occasionally over-the-top performance by Timothy Spall as a salesman
brilliant at his craft if without a shred or morality or self-worth left,. There's also a solid performance
by Michael Begley as the young `rookie' assigned to apprentice with Spall.

All that good stuff said, I just wish this was deeper. It's dark, certainly, but there's a certain familiarity and
even glibness to it's manic attack on capitalism. Enjoyable, fun, sad, but it feels like inside this good movie
was a great one looking to get out.",1377475200,,757,4.868217054263566
8018738,2,B0001Z936Q,"We saw previews of this on a DVD for another movie.  It looked like it was going to be hilariously amusing.  As is sometimes the case with previews/trailers for movies, it was one of those where the PREVIEWS pretty-much show you ALL THE BEST PARTS and the REST of it is ""FILLER"".  The acting was good, but the plot----if there was one----was obscure, uninteresting, & sort of ""all-over-the-place"".  We have really liked some of director Danny Boyle's flicks, like ""Millions"" for example, but this wasn't one of them.  We were sorry we wasted our time & money.  I would not recommend it.",1359504000,,586,4.696078431372549
8018739,5,B0001Z936Q,"Anybody in sales or those with pulse should watch this film just for Timothy Spall's over the top character. One of the most memorable performances in film. After renting it too many times, have now bought my own copy. You just can't beat the Brits when it comes to comedy",1288656000,,272,4.46
8018740,4,B0001Z936Q,"4.5 stars

Wow, this one really took me by surprise. Found it at me local library and brought it back to the flat for a quick look-see. Who's to know it would have one of the funnniest lead turns since Gervais' classic David Brent?

Timothy Spall takes a great script and ratchets it up a notch. No holds barred and then some, his salesman is both riotously funny and sadly disturbing. But mostly funny! There's not a dull moment here, and the 75 minutes fly right by, goosed by Boyle's slam-bang montage vision.

It's not bloody simple to make something that's both horrifying and touching, but 'ere 'tis. The horrification comes from the unblinking portraits of England and the ugly reality of salesmanship; the tenderness comes from unexpected moments of real caring amidst the surreal hilarity.

If you like British humor at all, this is some of the sweetest black comedy you could ask for. Well worth your time. He'll even knock off a hundred quid for ya.",1243468800,,960,4.696428571428571
8018741,1,B0001Z936Q,"I bought this movie because I am a HUGE fan of Danny Boyle's work. His early work (Shallow Grave and Trainspotting) are some of my favorite films. I am highly awaiting his newest film, Sunshine, and am also a fan of his take on the zombie genre, 28 Days Later. So when I saw that Danny Boyle had directed this ""hilarious"" film, I decided to give it a chance. When it starts, I only hoped the whole movie didn't look horribly pixilated. To my dismay, the rest of the film did indeed look like this. Unnecessary angles, quick cuts, and a horribly jumpy plot line make this an atrocious film. Shame on you, Danny Boyle.",1173744000,3,616,4.3652173913043475
