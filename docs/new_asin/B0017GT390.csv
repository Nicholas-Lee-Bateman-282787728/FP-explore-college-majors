3171525,5,B0017GT390,"If you are a fan I don't have to go on about how GREAT Tom is,I must tell you however This is the best looking and sounding Waits dvd I have seen. Pro shot no need to frett over what your gonna get here. Grade A",1209945600,17,211,3.608695652173913
3171526,1,B0017GT390,The audio of this DVD was one second behind the video which was disturbing to watch.,1286323200,,84,4.3125
3171527,5,B0017GT390,This is really an unexpected treasure from days that seemed gone-by. Small Change has always been one of my favorite albums and to see Waits perform most of the songs is rare. The audience seemed like German art class students that didn't understand a word. But what a nice canvas for TW !! Not for the uninitiated though.,1281398400,,322,4.568965517241379
3171528,5,B0017GT390,"Like other reviewers I was skeptical due to the very bootleg-looking box, but the video quality was a whole lot better than I expected and the sound is certainly better than acceptable, especially considering that this was shot in '77. Standard Waits fare for that era, all smokey and murky and jazzy. The audience, which looks like it's comprised of the occupants of a German tour bus that took a very wrong turn, are amusing in terms of their polite ambivalence as well as how overtly square they look.",1273881600,,504,4.674157303370786
3171529,5,B0017GT390,"Arrived lightning fast....Good quality video and sound. Except for a couple of tunes, the songs are performed in a very different jazzy improv style, not at all like the albums. I prefer the latter, but Waits' performances are like pizza...never bad, just some are better than others. A must have for the seasoned fan.",1270684800,,318,4.907407407407407
3171530,5,B0017GT390,"I received this as a Christmas gift and admit feeling skeptical once I saw the cover art, but this is a rare performance fans of Tom Waits can't afford to miss. Professionally filmed with crystal clear sound capture Tom Waits and a three-member band in support of the Small Change album performing in front of about 40 people.  This is as essential to your collection as the 5-star Small Change album itself.  With as good as this DVD is the cover could be left blank.",1265846400,,468,4.4941176470588236
3171531,5,B0017GT390,"For those of you who enjoy the early Tom Waits, this is a treasure.  Tom performs all but one of the songs on the 1976 album ""Small Change.""  The show is from the German show Rockpalast, and the picture and sound are superb.  Highly recommended!",1259798400,,245,4.4
3171532,5,B0017GT390,"I'm always skeptical about all things we fans affectionately refer to as ""bootleg"" whether they are or not. But I've had pretty good luck with buying things like this and after reading the reviews I was sold. I'm glad I bought it now! The seller is great and shipped extremely quickly first of all. But anyway, this is a great show. It's certainly not some shoddy bootleg quality video. This is professional quality. The sound quality is completely flawless!
Bad Liver and a Broken Heart is worth the price alone. As far as the earlier songs like the ones from Heart of Saturday Night, don't expect to hear the versions you might be familiar with. The days of that voice that Tom had just 4 years earlier is long gone. They are hopped-up full-on beatnik jazz versions. So if you dig the Heartattack and Vine and Blue Valentines style Waits then you'll love it. Tom is great and enthralling in every minute of the show. Some of it's kind of funny because the audience looks like they have no idea what in the hell they are watching...lol. You'll see what I mean...it's not the lively crowd from Nighthawks. Anyway, pick this one up if you're a Tom Waits fanatic like me...you won't regret it for a second.",1248652800,22,1204,4.552995391705069
3171533,5,B0017GT390,"I recently purchased the Tom Waits ""A Broken Heart"" DVD, and it was absolutely terrific.  The sound and visual quality were good. Everyone who is a tom waits fan should definitely own this DVD.  Thank you so much for having this product available to those of us who love waits!",1235433600,8,277,4.52
3171534,4,B0017GT390,"Really rare DVD, this is the only one performance you will find, It looks like a fan made DVD but the show is incdredible!
Great service too!",1230076800,,141,4.2592592592592595
3171535,5,B0017GT390,"Ok, I was a bit concerned when I got a white blank DVD inside a case that had a photo-copied cover insert, and I don't know how or where they got this German concert from 31 years ago, but its unbelievable. Its better than being there, especially since his current tour venue near us is terrible and still sold out in the first 15 minutes. When will Tom start selling the old concert footage to his fans and allow those who can't get tickets to a live show the ability to pay to watch a live internet broadcast? Give us access, Tom!

8265817,5,B0017GT390,"Good production values. Excellent early Waits. Really is a must for serious Waits fans.

The only thing missing is the stunned reaction of at least half the audiences, who at least at this time, and at least in the US (this concert is in Germany) only vaguely knew of Waits via the Eagles' hit of his song ""Ol 55."" They had no idea what was about to hit them and were shocked - some outraged - at a Charles Bukowski - Captain Beefheart beatnik jazz poet playing emotional-ballad (""cocktail lounge""?) piano. After the final #, which I remember being Waltzing Matilda, as it is here, on the way out of the hall you'd overhear people saying things like ""Those aren't the actual words are they?"" and ""How can he remember all those words to all those songs?"" And, of course, muttered outrage about ""that voice!""

This German audience is very well behaved and respectful, for better or worse.",1407110400,,886,4.60126582278481
8265818,1,B0017GT390,"Poor quality rip of a German TV program.  Very bad video, fair audio, box art is a scanned version of EU release.  Waited a long time for this and what a disappointment.",1404000000,,169,4.25
8265819,5,B0017GT390,"Never thought I would see a live Tom Waites show from the 70's again, but here it is. The lighting is a bit dark at times but the sound is excellent and well worth the money. I found myself clapping with the audience after a couple of the songs.",1390003200,,245,4.020408163265306
8265820,5,B0017GT390,"Incredible sound quality and a full seventy-nine minutes showcasing Tom at his zenith. I ordered it on 12/8 and received it on 12/12! If you love Waits, stop reading and ORDER NOW!",1386892800,,180,4.65625
8265821,5,B0017GT390,"Awesome Tom Waits footage!!! Sound and video superb for vintage 70`s. Recommend this to any Tom Waits fan, must have!!!",1375920000,,119,5.0
8265822,5,B0017GT390,"One of the reasons that I like Tom so much is that he is such a unique individual.
He has a great sense of humor.  I love his voice and the lyrics to his songs.
Sometimes he is funny and sometimes tragic.  This dvd is tragic/romantic.  I
watch it at least once a week and probably will never tire of it.",1370390400,,303,3.9344262295081966
8265823,5,B0017GT390,"""Two thumbs up on the packaging and speedy delivery. Being that this was filmed in the 70's, I thought the quality of sound/picture was very good indeed. For the Tom Wait fans out there, this DVD is a must have , as you will not be disappointed. Thanks for that bonus dvd of Waits, that was a nice surprise.",1335571200,,307,4.220338983050848
