When it became apparent that Richard Denning wasn't going to be automatically re-cast opposite Lucille Ball in ""I Love Lucy"" (the show inspired by the radio serial ""My Favourite Husband"" in which he had starred with Ball), Denning took the role of Jerry North, a publisher who also dabbles in sleuthing with his lovely wife Pamela (Barbara Britton).

MR. & MRS. NORTH was based on a series of novellas written by Richard Lockridge; the characters were later featured in a long-running radio serial, which started out in 1946 and ended up airing concurrently with the TV series (which debuted in 1952). The TV series of MR. & MRS. NORTH, sponsored by Revlon Cosmetics, played on CBS from 1952-53, and was later picked up by NBC for additional episodes in 1954.

Episodes:

""Forgotten Grave"" - House-hunting one dark and stormy night, the North's stumble upon a creepy mansion with the words ""help... murder"" scrawled on the window.

""Loon Lake"" - The North's catch more than trout when a vicious criminal escapes from prison and hides at the couples' favorite vacation spot.

""Terror"" - A crackpot doctor with a ""Jekyll-Hyde"" complex gives the North's a night of terror they won't soon forget.

""The Nobles"" - Pam becomes a volunteer nurse for senior citizens. Her first clients are kindly Mrs. Noble and her demented, homicidal family.",1290556800,4,1467,4.96734693877551
