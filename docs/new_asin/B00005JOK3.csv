1546384,5,B00005JOK3,"Before David E. Kelley went off the deep end with Boston Legal (and became a superstar, go figure), he created great, great human dramas like Picket Fences, The Practice, and Boston Public. Loved everything about BP, from Chi McBride's hyperethical principal and Nicky Katt's erratically dark history teacher to Fyvush Finkle's Harvey Lipschultz. I even enjoyed the parade of ""temp"" cast members like Dennis Miller, a white collar criminal on community service to Kathy Baker as Asst. Principal Guber's psycho girlfriend. The stories were funny, warm, and emotionally involving -- it was a perfect way to end the week. Hope to see Season One soon.",1190851200,37,647,5.171428571428572
1546385,5,B00005JOK3,"Set in a fictional high school in Boston, this show was great. I was sad to see many of the original stars leave in the later seasons. However the first season was by far the best. This show centered around the lives of both the students, teachers, parents, and administration. Everyday is something different. A teacher writes that she is going to kill herself on the chalkboard, to a Social Studies teacher who is telling students to wear bras for the good of this country. Lets not forget the nude olympics which Mr. Guber (Vice-Principal) tries but doesn't suceed to stop. Chi McBride (I, Robot) was outstanding as the principal who always knew how to get the superintendant off of his back. I miss this show and hope it comes to DVD soon.",1188086400,42,743,4.593984962406015
1546386,5,B00005JOK3,"I was about 14 years old when this show came on the air, let me tell you I watched every episode until Jessalyn Gilsig left the show. This is one of the best TV programs Fox ever put on the air! This show is about a fictional high scool in Boston, MA. I fell in love with the show and the entire cast. In 2003 (I think) a few of the original cast members left the show, I was very distraught! I stopped watching the show after my favorite actors left, yes I watched the opening credits to see if they would make a guest apperance but only to small or nor avail. The show had lost the best actors and inturn they had lost the chrisma that had brought me to the show in the first place! I think the show would still be on to this very day if the original cast would not have left, at least I know I would still be watching!",1186012800,34,821,3.9221556886227544

1546491,5,B00005JOK3,"Boston Public is one of my FAVORITE shows, and Fox (or whatever other studio holds the rights to the series) REALLY needs to release this to DVD -- even if it means that it has to be a ""Manufactured on Demand"" (like via Amazon's CreateSpace or something) release, please, PLEASE just put this series on DVD!!

During the first 3 of the 4 seasons that ""Boston Public"" was on the air, I wasn't able to see it, because its timeslot at 8 PM on Monday nights conflicted with ""7th Heaven"", another favorite TV show, that aired on the WB Network at the same time. Though I wanted to see ""Boston Public"", I couldn't watch it (though in retrospect, I can't recall why it did not occur to me to just tape one show & watch the other) until it moved to Friday nights. Then I started watching regularly, and I LOVED it!!

Like many ""BP"" fans, I was very disappointed when it was abruptly cancelled without a series finale, even leaving two unaired episodes (which did air about a year later, in syndication, on cable). Meanwhile, since I missed the first 2 seasons or so, when the WE (Women's Entertainment) Network & then TV-One started airing syndicated reruns of the show, I started watching it and with each episode, loving it even more and more!

In fact, I loved it so much, that when the syndicated reruns stopped airing on TV, I started looking for ""Boston Public"" episodes online, and eventually got an ""unofficial"" (bootleg) DVD set of the series, burned from TV - at least to tide me over until ""Boston Public"" has a commercial DVD release someday (hopefully soon!)

However, because ""Boston Public"" is one of my FAVORITE shows, ever since I got the DVDs I watched them SO much, that quite a few of the discs have actually gone bad -- and I've been wanting to replace the set, but have been holding off in the hope that there is an official release soon! But if that does not happen, then I will probably get another ""unofficial"" replacement set, to have the show until Fox (or whoever else owns the rights) gets up off their greedy/lazy butts and releases ""Boston Public"" on DVD!!

I have several favorite scenes, way too numerous to count. But one of my MOST favorite scenes (and I think one of the FUNNIEST scenes in the whole series) was in ""Chapter Thirty-Five"" (Season #2, Episode #12)

In this scene, history teacher Marla Hendricks (Loretta Devine) discovered that 3 girls were bullying another student, Melissa, even conning her into dressing up like a prostitute for class, just to humiliate her. After encountering Melissa in the bathroom, unhappily removing the gobs of makeup that the girls put on her, Ms. Hendricks storms down the hall, and pulls them out of class. She lines them up against the lockers, and as she is reprimanding them, one of the girls rolls her eyes, whereupon Marla angrily threatens to tape her eyelids shut. Then when that same girl tries to offer a lame defense, and the other two girls burst out laughing in response, Marla compares them to sheep, and starts making them ""Baa!"" out loud - right in the school hallway!!

Everytime I see this episode, I'm just rolling around with laughter at seeing those snotty, stuck-up, and nasty girls standing there baa-ing! It's just HILARIOUS!!!!

I especially LOVE seeing those girls getting their comeuppance, because a similar (if not identical) thing happened to me in the 8th grade when a few girls in my class conned me into letting them ""give me a makeover"" claiming that it'd make me more popular (and since I'd been picked on, teased, bullied & excluded almost all through school, I believed them -- until [just like the girls in this episode] they made me look ridiculous -- like a clown, Tammy Faye Bakker and the like!) But UNLIKE on the show, the teachers I had, not only did NOTHING to stop the bullying, but often (or at least on several occasions -- like the ""makeover"" in 8th grade) they essentially JOINED the bullies & cliques in laughing at my humiliation.

Which is probably why that scene with Marla Hendricks is my favorite scene in the whole 81 episode series!

Maybe its because my own high school years were totally screwed up and robbed from me (actually not just high school, but my entire school career was MISERABLE!) -- but every single time that I see ""Boston Public"", I constantly wish that IF it had not been possible to have been homeschooled, or better yet, UNschooled (because I have, for various reasons [both my own school experiences as well as other reasons], become a huge proponent/supporter of homeschooling and UNschooling, over the last few years) then I wish that at least there was some way that Winslow High School and its faculty & administration could be real and that I could go back in time, so I could go to Winslow, and have such GREAT teachers like Lauren Davis (Jessalyn Gilsig), Harry Senate (Nicky Katt), Marylin Sudor (Sharon Leal), Ronnie Cooke (Jeri Ryan), Marla Hendricks (Loretta Devine) and others. Even though I know that it's all fictional, and doesn't really exist, I can't help it!

I LOVE nearly every single main character on ""Boston Public"", even Scott Guber (Anthony Heald), and Harvey Lipschultz (Fyvush Finkel)!

In fact, although Vice-Principal Scott Guber is portrayed as a stern & tough administrator, even earning the nickname, ""The Nazi"" (which especially offends Mr. Guber, as he is Jewish) among the Winslow students, I disagree. I think that he is one of the sweetest characters on the show, and deep down, he has a heart of gold.

Same goes for History teacher Harvey Lipschultz (his last name is pronounced LIP-SHITZ) who is portrayed as a senile old bigot, which he admittedly is. However, I do NOT think that his racist/sexist/homophobic tendencies are borne out of any real malice or hatred, but rather more of the ignorance of just being of a different era, coming from a time when those kinds of views were common, even culturally-sanctioned (although that doesn't make those views right, of course!). Which is a fact that fellow teacher, Lauren Davis (Jessalyn Gilsig) also alluded to in one episode where the school administration was attempting to force Mr. Lipschultz into retirement. Even though Harvey is outdated and the bigotry resulting from that is one of his flaws, I think that, just like Scott Guber, underneath Harvey's gruff & grumpy exterior is a heart of gold -- and despite his racist/sexist/homophobic tendencies there are times when his caring ""sweet old man"" side is able to show itself.

Like, for example, in one episode an Arabic/Muslim student, Khalid Mubarek and his sister, Sabeen, are labeled as terrorists (because Khalid had visited anti-American websites on the school library computers) by the other students who then persecute, harass and even attack them. Yet, surprisingly, it is the bigoted HARVEY LIPSCHULTZ who stands up for the Mubareks! In one scene, Sabeen is leaving school at the end of the day, and the entire student body (or what seems like it!) surrounds her, taunting her, and then someone throws a glass bottle at her, knocking her down to the ground, and it is Harvey Lipschultz who helps her to her feet, and yells at the crowd, berating them for calling her a terrorist, and defending Sabeen before escorting her to safety back inside the school building. I LOVED that scene between Harvey Lipschultz and Sabeen Mubarek, because his caring & compassionate side gets to shine through!

I LOVE this TV series, and because most of the DVDs from my set (that was taped off TV) have gone bad now, and I would really rather buy a professionally-made DVD (even if it is a ""Manufactured on Demand"" DVD set), rather than another unofficial set, I really hope that it is released on DVD soon -- and preferably please release the complete series all at one time, so that us fans don't have to wait any longer for each individual season release!!

Even though the earlier seasons had more of the original cast, I still enjoyed all the seasons. This show came out right when I entered high school and I would always talk about it with one teacher who was helping me through some tough times.

1546563,5,B00005JOK3,"This is one of those shows that has an amazing theme: High School in Public. It is not only tells high school stories but teacher stories. It is well balanced where anyone can watch it. It was a minor hit for a number of years but I think the main problem was the cast changes were too much. I understand how some characters need to be written out but there were too many, too quickly. By the end of the series, the cast only featured a few members from the first show. I also thought the students needed to be structured better. Most students were only featured for a few episodes.

Either way, this was a series I have been looking forever to come out on DVD. I got my Freaks and Geeks but why not Boston Public. And I would probably only be interested in the first few seasons but it was still a strong show that I think has a decent cult following.",1213920000,15,852,4.163636363636364

The story lines were always quirky and entertaining and usually delivered thought-provoking, emotional responses in every episode. Always there was something hysterically funny and far-fetched, and the challenge of substantial story-telling with provactive and compelling performances from such a talented and diverse cast is why this show ought to be available on DVD. Not that it was perpetually perfect--it did reach at times and get smarmy, but that is often the case in high school life. It is in that same ""rare gem"" category as ""Thirtysomething""--which also should be released on DVD!! I want it NOW, if not sooner. ""SMELL that shoe!!!""",1207180800,12,751,5.163934426229508
