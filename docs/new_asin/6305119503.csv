Rusty has adult Beagles, Beagle Pups and other cuddly friends. Not much of a plot for adults but tons of Beagle fun to make up for it!",1089504000,8,269,4.0

971319,4,6305119503,"I have found Rusty to be wonderfully entertaining, sweet
and charming.  The way the animals appear to be really
talking is amazing.  In a world full of nastiness it is
awsome to see a movie that is enjoyable and almost Aesop-like.
Our whole family LOVES Rusty!!",1043625600,4,261,4.6521739130434785

7883594,5,6305119503,I have not seen the movie. I purchased it for my 4 & 7 year old grandsons to watch in the car. From the laughter that comes from the back seat I am confident that it is a fun movie. They watch it over and over.,1210032000,4,210,3.5869565217391304
7883595,3,6305119503,A+ for the film's strong family message:  the grandparents are wonderfully charming; the brother and sister get along; the kids even say prayers before going to sleep.  This along with the cute talking animals should keep the family entertained.  The worst part is the horrible overacting of Charles Fleischer and Laraine Newman as the villainous Bert snd Bertha Bimini; they're so over the top they're ultimately annoying.  Good old Hal Holbrook and Rue McClanahan are pleasant to spend a few minutes with.  The talking effects are crude but oftentimes quite humorous and hang on at the end for an animal danced version of that golden chestnut DISCO DUCK!,1154476800,6,656,5.037037037037037
