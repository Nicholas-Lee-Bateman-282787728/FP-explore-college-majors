7891741,5,6305554501,"I really wish troma would have kept the original name and cover but anyhow it is still the best B grade movie out there. First i really liked the setting (creepy old house) and you cant go wrong with a smart mouthed beer drinking no it all gerk either (Bob) Second the characters are great especially bob with his smart assed comments and negativity. The only problem i had with this film was that near the end the last 2 guys didn't talk to eachother for the rest of the movie at least 20 mins. I mean say something to eachother your helping one another to stay alive. Other than that the movie itself is more funny than scary like the amount of 2 by 4's there is lying around, 5 foot steel poles and THE TOOL BOX (i knew it would be used for something) The whole setting is like set up for a big blood bath with all the tools and all. So if you like blood and guts go and buy this one Dead dudes in the house A.K.A The house on tombstone hill. 5 Stars *****",1119312000,2,959,4.052631578947368

But when one of the guys said ""yeah, if she don't stop staring at us, I'm gonna go over there and smack her"" THAT was funny as hell!!!!!!!!",1070755200,,266,3.8545454545454545
7891743,5,6305554501,"When I Saw this movie on the TV Guide in the early 90's I saw the title I thought it was a dumb movie but I record movies off TV and I have a big collection so I watched it and recored it and I thought it was very exciting\scary I'm glad I recorded the movie. I have alot of friends that never seen the movie but a few of them seen over my house and they enjoyed it and wanted a double tape, so this movie is really good I'm going to purchase it online, I was surprised when they had this movie online so if you ask me get this movie and add it to your collection. 2003...",1043280000,6,572,3.775
7891744,5,6305554501,"ok , im going to start by saying that this movie is great. you see, i love bad movies and bad acting and bad directing and everything about this movie. the actors are the worst, in a good way. i think thats what made me laugh so hard. the gore is great too. people are getting impaled, cut in half by windows, getting buzz saw blades in their heads and much much more! i watched this again last night with a friend and he thought that it was the worst movies he ever has seen. but i loved it. also, for the guy that wrote the other review, i belive that his name is ""steve miller"", he said that it doesnt explain why the old lady kills every one in the house. it does bob broke her tombstone. when he did that she  woke up. one more fun fact iis that one of my band has a song about this movie called ""dead dudes in the house"".",1021420800,2,827,3.9520958083832336
7891745,3,6305554501,"Continuing with the B-movie kick I've been on lately, I picked up a copy  of 'Dead Dudes in the House,' based solely on the title and the knowledge  that it was a Troma film.
As it turned out, it's only distributed by  Troma, but, unlike 'Legend of the Raven' and the awful, AWFUL 'Evil  Clutch,' this one's actually a pretty decent low-budget horror flick, a  cross between a slasher movie and a haunted house flick. It's not perfect,  but it provided some neat scary moments and its characters generally  behaved as though they actually had brains in their heads, something  all-too-rare in horror flicks where character's seem to be as bright as the  plot calls for.
The story revolves around a group of 20-something men and  women (sort of like a dysfunctional version of 'Friends') who set out to  restore a decaying mansion that one of them have bought for an amazingly  low price. As they prepare to enter, one of them maliciously breaks a  tombstone in the backyard, and, in doing so, awakens a pair of malevolent  spirits that inhabit the house. What follows is a night of terror as our  protagonists are stalked and killed one by one. They don't stay dead for  long, though...
As a ""killer in the house"" movie, it works  pretty well. The victims even try to keep in a group rather than splitting  up! As a ghost film, 'Dead Dudes' is somewhat lacking. The film never gives  us any good reason for WHY the ghosts are bent on killing everyone who  enters the house, including a couple of teen boys who get added late in the  film. (Okay, so they oogle the ghost of the daughter, but that's hardly a  reason since she invites them to do so.) The reason might be ""because  they're insane""--terrible things did happen to the women who haunt the  house--but I'm not sure that reason holds up. And, in any case, there's no  explanation for why their victims reanimate as homicidal killers  themselves. Maybe I'm just thinking too hard, but I would probably have  given this film another star if it had given me a satisfactory answer to  those questions.",968716800,4,2056,4.604972375690608

7891747,3,6305554501,"The phrase ""Respect for your elders"" comes into full effect as a group of friends try to fix up a real estate agent's worst nightmare but find their having some difficulty doing so with a killer granny mutilating  them. For destroying her tombstone, no less. Do not trust the title nor the  video box, neither are correct in describing the teens who do a MUCH better  job of acting once their dead. Owes a little something in credit to THE  EVIL DEAD series, which this tops, easily. Don't watch alone!",945475200,3,502,4.544444444444444
