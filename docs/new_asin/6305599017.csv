1048954,4,6305599017,"My son is just over 2 years old & watched this entire video. (That's saying a lot, since he is very active.) The little girl kept his attention and he listened closely as she talked. We had more success with the Potty Time With Bear (Bear in the Big Blue House) show, but this one peaked his interest and made him want to sit on his potty (in clothes).",1052956800,5,352,4.115942028985507
1049106,1,6305599017,"I'm glad I only paid a dollar for this from the dollar store! I've tried having my daughter watch it twice, and both times she didn't even watch it for even a minute. It did not catch my daughters attention or interest in using the potty.",1315785600,,238,4.195652173913044
1049107,1,6305599017,"It feels like a ""home made"" video. I did not appreciate showing the potty chair being used as a toy, since young children immitate a lot and this could become a hygiene problem.  My child was not interested in it what so ever. We watched it only one time and it has been resting on our shelf since then.",1280361600,,303,4.135593220338983
1049108,3,6305599017,It taught a lot but I needed something for a younger age child to watch and understand.  It's more for a 3 or 4 year old or older child.,1278374400,,136,3.689655172413793
1049109,3,6305599017,"I don't like how the little girl tells you a story throughout the whole movie, it dosnt work for a who year old. When the little boy plays pretend with his chair through the jungle, i think this kind of movie is for a child that has problems sitting on the chair, but we are pass that stage.",1252800000,,291,4.0344827586206895
1049110,1,6305599017,"I bought this DVD without reading the reviews.  After I bought it, I read the reviews and thought maybe it wouldn't be so bad. Once I got it we watched the DVD and found out that it really is horrible.  It's not made for a toddler to understand and it will not keep their attention.  If you have a 6 year old who is still potty training, they  may watch it, but they won't understand everything the little girl is talking about because she uses adult words to explain going potty.",1242691200,,480,4.241758241758242
1049111,5,6305599017,"My toddler listened with rapt attention to the ""big kid"" talk about how to go potty. She never listens to me! This DVD is worth trying before you get frustrated with your toddler who thinks she knows everything before she even tries. Good luck!",1229731200,,244,4.568181818181818
1049112,3,6305599017,"I am a home daycare provider. I have been a daycare provider for 6 yrs nowI own 5 potty training Videos/dvd's. I Can Go Potty! is mostly for parents to get an idea on how to potty train their child. It is an ok video but you can can get the ideas from a book and not have to listen to the child host. Who isn't very good. My kids didn't care for this video at all. It does have 2 cute songs but I wish I had skipped buying this tape. It is very boring to say the least.

I would recomend the fowolling tapes/dvds

Potty Power - For Boys & Girls
It's Potty Time

and for older kids
Bear in the Big Blue House - Potty Time with Bear
This in wonderful kids who are already trained but have accidents from time to time. Potty Time with Bear show kids what accidents and how to avoid them. Very sweetly done.",1217376000,,803,3.9444444444444446
1049113,5,6305599017,"Could it be? Has our little son decided, all by himself, to use the potty? All signs say yes!

During our trip to the library last week, on a whim I rented ""I Can Go Potty."" My son studied it with intensity. He loved the song about being a ""big kid,"" and would softly repeat the lyrics under his breath: ""a big kid eats by himself, a big kid is polite, a big kid uses a potty"" as though in a trance. He watched it over and over, and then stood up, took off his clothes and sat down on his potty. Folding laundry, I smiled and thought nothing of it. Months of looking into the depths of a bone-dry potty had left me cynical and jaded. I walked out of the room to put away the clean clothes, only to hear, ""Done! Doooooooooone!""

When I returned, sure enough, there it was. I let out a cheer, we hugged, we clapped and when I called him my ""big kid"" and his eyes lit up with pride.",1186358400,3,879,3.9886363636363638
1049114,1,6305599017,"I purchased this DVD after I started potty training and that was a big mistake.  It may be ok for the very first introduction, but after that it is no good.  For one thing, the child in the video is given the potty chair to play with and has it on his head and is using it like a toy which may be well and good when the child has not attempted to use it yet. I stopped showing the video immediately because I don't want my children to immitate the video.  I don't allow my boys (twins) to play with the potty chair or toilet, they are for doing your business and that is it.  I liked all of the other videos we used (Elmo's Potty Time, Potty Power, I Gotta Go) which were silly and had catchy songs the kids liked.",1184457600,5,714,3.972027972027972
1049115,5,6305599017,"We have potty trained two little guys very easily with the help of this video.  My nephew watched it once and was well on his way.  Within 2 weeks of his one viewing, he was potty trained with no accidents and very few demands from his parents.  My two and 1/2 year old has had similar results.  He was glued to this CD for a few days.  Would watch it over and over.  2 weeks later his is well on his way to no accidents at all.  And more importantly, no pressuring required from Mom and Dad.",1183507200,,492,4.010309278350515
1049177,1,6305599017,"I bought ""Potty Power"" and it keeps a 22 month old interested but I wasn't totally happy with everything about that DVD.  As such, I bought ""I Can Go Potty!..."".  It does not keep this child interested at all.  A child does the talking/explaining which is great. It shows a boy playing with the potty chair with a plush toy and just playing with it in a non-potty way.  This may be what happens in real life but no child needs to be shown to do that.

Much of the story is of the boy sitting on the chair while day dreaming about going to outter space, under the sea and in the jungle.  Do children who are potty training age know about these places even?  The alligator is scary, that is so helpful.  I sent this back, and I hate to do things like that.",1178323200,3,754,4.116438356164384
1049178,5,6305599017,"I am so excited I can barely type this review! My 3 year old son was anti-potty training and said ""NO"" every time I brought it up. I read somewhere not to push the issue, but I thought it wouldn't hurt to buy a DVD about it and maybe he would become more interested. I ordered this DVD and just played it this evening.  He just stared at the TV for 5 minutes straight without turning away then he literally brought the potty into the living room, sat down and went for the first time! Then he kept asking to play the song part of it again & again while he was playing with his cars. About an hour later he jumps up, runs over to the potty, sat down and went again! I didn't even have to bring it up! I am just stunned at the moment and had to recommend this video immediately. Just amazing and worth every penny!",1170288000,8,812,4.043478260869565
1049179,5,6305599017,"I bought this video for my daughter when she was a year old.  I let her watch it everyday (that's all the T.V. she was allowed) and by the time she was 18 months old she really wanted to use the potty.  She loved the ""big kid"" song and wanted to be a big kid too!  Thanks to this video my daughter was potty trained at 18 months!!  Now I need to get it on DVD for my son!",1151020800,3,371,3.6582278481012658
1049180,2,6305599017,"Although friends had reccommended ""Potty Power,""  I bought ""I Can Go Potty"" on a whim when I was running another errand at Borders (sorry Amazon), and could not find Potty Power. I was not impressed by this DVD, and would not recommend it. I would have given it one star, except my daughter kind of liked it.

The main part of the DVD is really short. It contains a couple of wierd musical video montages, and the ""potty safari"" mentioned by the previous reviewer. so the actual meat of the DVD is probably 5 minutes long.  One of the ""extra's"" called ""Parent's Guide"" was actually video previews.  $15 for 15 minutes, two low budget musical montages, a strange off-topic safari fantasy, and video previews?  I'm still kicking myself for not just ordering online and waiting a few days for Potty Power.",1126915200,19,802,4.659574468085107
1049181,2,6305599017,"I picked this up last minute at Toys R Us and boy, do I wish I had checked the reviews here first!  This video is narrated by an older child who spends most of her time in the household attic (huh?)and contains monologue after monologue of her explaining the process of using the potty chair.  Because she talks AT LENGTH about potty training her little brother (even I found myself wandering off and not entirely paying attention),  it is not tailored for the short attention span of toddlers/preschoolers.  Only a much older child (such as a school-ager) could bare the length of the narration...and what use do they have for a potty training video except possibly to help their younger sibling? At one point,  the video shows the little brother playing with his potty chair,  carrying it all over the house,  stuffing toys into it,  taking it apart, dumping the bowl portion (it was empty of course) over a stuffed bear's head --and I almost stopped the tape.  While I do want my son to have fun with the potty training process and feel comfortable, I do NOT need a video giving him any ""bright ideas"" such as how to shove toys into it or dump a urine-filled bowl over toys.  In another looooong segment,  the video shows the little boy floating and flying through all sorts of scenery on his potty chair...the ocean, jungle, etc. etc. and I thought-what in the world does this have to do with potty training? What we need is a simple step-by-step demonstration with a song or two,  but that's it!  Just get to the point.  This video went right over my son's head and I totally regret the purchase.  It will be returned tomorrow.",1120003200,,1632,4.560137457044673
1049182,2,6305599017,I liked the video except that when the little boy who was potty training had a make believe journey into the jungle on a safari (on his toilet) there were horrible mean looking animals (i.e. crocodile staring into the camera snarling & snapping) that made my daughter burst out into tears and ran out of the room sobbing.  Not the best thing to happen when I am trying to make potty training fun.  She won't go near the potty again.  If you have a boy who likes wild animals it would probably be okay ..... but for younger kids it can be scary....!  ;-(,1117411200,20,553,4.288461538461538
1049183,2,6305599017,"I had this video on VHS from when we potty trained my son. It had only images of a little boy using the potty, and I don't think that it would be good for my daughter. My question is, what is the difference between the VHS version and the DVD version that says that it is for Boys and Girls?",1106179200,,291,3.8666666666666667
1049184,5,6305599017,"My 3 year old has been extremely resistant, extremely strong willed to going on the potty.  He has always gotten mad when you talk about the potty or read books about the potty.  I got this video at a garage sale on a whim, I really didn't even think I would get him to watch it.  He loves watching it over and over.  He's definitely making progress and I have to give credit to this video for making the difference in his attitude.  The songs are cute and he loves them.",1101254400,2,471,4.131868131868132
1049185,4,6305599017,"I was getting very frustrated with my 2 yr old not going to the pot. Size 6 pampers were becoming very expensive. one weekend I decided that was it, I was going to have to do something to incourage him to go to the pot. I found the tape at a Babies R US store and figure I would give it a try.
 Like most kids the first time he saw it he glanced at it and went into the other room. I figured like any other show I.E Dora, or Lil Bill or Barney, they have to watch it a few times before they catch onto it. Well by his name also being Andrew, when the girl said it, he looked at the TV like she was talking to him. He caught onto the songs very quickly. Now it didn't happen over night, but in a about three weeks he started to mimick the tape and try to go to the pot on his own. Now like most kids he will still have a few accidents in his pull ups if it is too busy watching Dora the Explorer but during the day he stays in todler underwears and he stays dry all day. I believe the songs stayed with him and it helped.

 I'm starting on my 18 mons old having him to watch the video.",1084147200,3,1084,3.745614035087719
1049186,2,6305599017,This video is cheesier than Velveeta! It is painful to have to sit through it. Most of the video is of the little girl talking and not of the little boy actually on the potty. There is even a part where the little boy goes zooming around on the potty. Extremely painful viewing. I don't think my 2 year old son got anything at all from it.,1070064000,3,339,4.074626865671642
7891800,1,6305599017,"This video consists almost entirely of a girl sitting and talking to the screen. This is extremely boring for my toddler, and she usually stops paying attention. There are some ""action shots"", but none of them are actually focused on the process of going potty. There is a super long sequence where the boy learning to use the potty plays with the potty - taking it apart, shoving his stuffed animals into it, driving around and pretending he's on the moon - but that's not educational at all. I understand that you don't want to show little children without their clothes, but he could at least teach his stuffed animals how to use the potty and do some demonstrations that way. There are music videos, but the first one has absolutely nothing to do with using the potty and the second one consists entirely of terrible animations that do nothing to clarify the process for my daughter. She enjoys the music, but she isn't actually learning.",1487808000,,942,4.680722891566265
7891801,5,6305599017,"Great Video!!!  I do like this video!  However, I think our daughter is just not ready for potty training at all yet (since she refuses to sit on the little/big potties in the house.)  It is very informative with music and a little girl narrates the video.",1473033600,,256,4.404255319148936

7891805,2,6305599017,"I found it hilarious.  My son refused to watch it.  It was like getting a classroom lecture from a 6 year old ""potty expert"".  Way too much information for my son.  After about three minutes he asked if he could watch his other potty video, ""Go, Potty, Go, Mommy?""  It was fun for me to watch the little boy fly into outer space with his potty chair, but my 2 year old couldn't grasp the concept.  He wanted hear singing and flushing. I also enjoyed the teddy bear bottom wiping demonstration.  My son just stared blankly.",1404432000,,522,4.375

7891807,5,6305599017,the kids loves this dvd im hopeing it works to potty train thame so far it looks like its going to work thanks for the dvd,1349308800,,122,3.730769230769231
7891808,4,6305599017,"I paid over $12 for this video and while I think it was overpriced, it worked.  I played it twice for my 27-month-old daughter and commenced potty-training the following day.  The first two days of training were awful, as she was scared and it was all new.  By day three she had it down - even going number two in the potty - and by day 4 we were done!

Sure, she had watched Mom use the toilet, but watching an actual child (and not a cartoon character) sit on the potty was an effective visual for her.  The video begins with a lot of talk by the little girl, and my child didn't understand any of it.  Just when my daughter seemed to be losing interest in the video, off it went in another direction with the bizarre jungle and space segments.  My daughter LOVED that part and now she was re-focused.  I believe that's why those segments are in there.

Honestly, the video looks hokey to me and I had my doubts, but it sure seemed to prepare my daughter for the days ahead.",1332806400,2,976,4.204301075268817
7891809,4,6305599017,I was a little underwelmed by the production value but my girls loved it.  They asked me to play it over and over.  My two year old got up and pooped for the first time in the potty the same day. I have tried everything with this kid and a few times watching the video and it all clicked for her.  I hope it works as well when my baby boy is ready to potty train.  It has songs and a little girl hosts it.  The kids love that.  It even goes over how the toilet works and hand washing.  It also has tips for parents too.,1323907200,,519,3.794392523364486
