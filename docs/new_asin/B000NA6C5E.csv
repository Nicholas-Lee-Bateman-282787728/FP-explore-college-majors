8176156,1,B000NA6C5E,Terrible dvd. Technically flawed. Unwatchable! Don't waste your money,1520035200,,69,6.777777777777778
8176157,5,B000NA6C5E,"A jewel I never get tired of.  Laugh along with WFB and his shipmates while they prepare for their transAtlantic crossing.  Their trial run commentary with graphics is hysterical (my favorite segment). Then hang on for the ride. I've gone through six copies--I keep loaning them out and then I forget who to.  Mind you, in the pre-amazon days it was well neigh impossible to locate replacement copies (first VHS and later, DVD). Thank goodness other folk fell in love with this gem, repackaged it and made sure amazon was its distribution go-to place. Decades back, while on the hunt for a copy I happened upon one in an out-of-the-way video library in Lake Tahoe. The second I spotted it my heart started racing.  You'd think I'd unearthed a sacred manuscript or the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves! Yes, you could say I'm passionate about Airborne. If you want to learn from a master sailor and laugh all the way across the Atlantic with him and his cohorts, treat yourself, your family & friends to this DVD adventure.",1476144000,,1017,4.728813559322034
8176158,5,B000NA6C5E,"Most sailors, or former sailors, will truly enjoy this story.  Buckley's telling of the trials and tribulations encountered while traversing the ICW in South Florida is hilarious.",1454544000,,179,5.62962962962963
8176159,5,B000NA6C5E,"WFB is at his best in this hard to find video!  The dubbing from VHS to CD is very good, not ""HD"" quality but the original video was filmed before ""HD"".  Glad I purchased it for my collection.",1386806400,,192,4.026315789473684
8176160,5,B000NA6C5E,"Quintessential WFB on every level...engaging, thought provoking, and highly entertaining...highly recommend joining him on this remarkable adventure of a lifetime.",1379721600,,163,7.2
8176161,4,B000NA6C5E,"I would give this book five stars, but for the fact you almost need PHD to understand some of the language(although that is some of the charm). I remember Mr. Buckley, being on Johnny Carson when he was making the rounds with this book, back in the day. The book is written in a very enjoyable style, the overall book is about his crossing of the Atlantic in the mid seventies, however, there is fantastic tales of his sailing life.  Mr. Buckley is very frank about the hardships of boat ownership and mistakes both he and others have made on board (over the years).  There are stories that I would never tell on myself for fear of ridicule and this shows the very nature of the man.  He is not some vain over-proud (except of his son of whom he writes of his admiration and love) man that is unaware of shortcomings, or better yet miscalculations, or perhaps better still the reliance on others to do their job as expected.  For the crossing the book is written as pages form the log, with back stories and anecdotes, that are really helpful--this is a book that everyone who reads, should read.  james smith",1261699200,2,1109,4.47029702970297
