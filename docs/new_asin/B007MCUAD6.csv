5099199,3,B007MCUAD6,"Just watched this and enjoyed the story in spite of some pretty mediocre animation.  If you are familiar with the original comic, it is pretty true to that story line.  I would give it a 4 out of 5 stars.  But the blu-ray loses another star because instead of a digital copy, they 'allow' you to access an ultra-violet version.  For someone who watches his digital copies on his Ipad, this does not work unless you are by a good wi-fi source.  IMHO, this will effect sales...and it should.",1338940800,2,489,4.449438202247191
5099200,5,B007MCUAD6,"Superman Vs. The elite.  A story taken from Action comics #775. *""That issue was called ""the single best issue of a comic book written in the year 2001"", was voted the #1 in the Top Ten Comics of the Decade, #21 in the list of ""Top 100 Comics of the last 30 years"" and named the ""Greatest Superman Story of All Time"" by Wizard Magazine.""
Alot of fan boys have been prematurely hating this adaptation (I'm talking to you SSH, love:""Cpt. Obvious.""), but I've always been up to give it a chance, as in my opinion the DC/Warner brothers direct to dvd stuff is always top notch.
The big hullabaloo is about the character design and the size of Supe's chin.  I agree...they went big.  But the simplistic, disarming animation makes the overall presentation very palatable.  The production team is still the same as it was from the previous WB/DC releases..give or take..but the whole production of this project seemed different.  The animations in the last few cycles has been leaning more toward the mature.  ""Bat-man year one"" being the most recent example..but let's not forget Sinestro torturing an addict with drugs in ""Green Lantern First Flight""  Superman Vs. The Elite is by far the most mature film in the of them...and trust me..I'm a big fan..and got um all.
I say it's mature because the character driven writing really asks the viewer to consider the situation...question morality.  It does what DC has been pushing toward which is to make Superman relevant and cool in the new era without abandoning the core of what Superman is.
Now.  Like any work taken from a novel or in this case comic, then graphic novel.  It's hard to translate everything well..and somethings will be left out...and not everyone is going to be happy.  But Superman Vs. The Elite manages to capture the spirit of the source material, and translate it well visually in the time afforded.  At some points I wished for a better animated relation of the material...but in the end I was completely satisfied...and understand the passive delivery given the heavy subject matter.
In this film Superman finds himself facing a band of super powered ""do gooders"" that don't have the moral restrictions of not killing, to inhibit their ""heroic"" behavior.  Superman find's himself in the minority and feels like an idea of yesteryear, and in moments of self doubt you see that he might be able to move faster than a speeding bullet...but he can not move faster than thought.  That is how fast Manchester black can move.  An orphan, ex secret agent Manchester Black has decided to go ""freelance"" and protect the world.  The dueling moralities meet in a story of slavery, homicide..and social and cognitive dissonance.  Easily the best Superman movie I've seen since Richard Donnor collaborated with Mario Puzzo.

""people don't want baby sitters in spandex to spank them when they are bad.  They want surgeons to cut out the
the cancers that fester in us, and make sure they never come back."" - Manchester black

I don't want to give anything away...but basically...Superman Vs. The Elite asks the question is it okay to step over the line if it gets you a clear result.

A must see..must buy..must own for any fan of the recent releases...and every one else.

5099201,4,B007MCUAD6,"I have seen this film before its release in its entirety. Superman Vs. The Elite is based on Action Comics 775, ""What's so funny bout Truth, Justice and the American Way"". It is hailed as the greatest Superman story of all time by many serious Superman fans. The issue is a great issue but not the best story of all time in my opinion. That would probably be a Bronze age story like Kryptonite Nevermore or the wonderful Whatever Happened To the Man of Tomorrow as written by Alan Moore. The film is good for being so short and like many of the other DC Animated movies it follows the source material very well. The problem that I have and I have heard this from other fans who have seen the trailers is that the art/animation style is very amateurish. It does not do justice to the comic it is based on. The acting is done very well however. It feels as though you are watching a low rent cartoon for small children like something from the channel, Nickelodeon. I would say watch this, download it, but do not purchase the DVD or Blue Ray.",1338336000,6,1040,4.338461538461538

Two drawbacks to the video include:

1) The opening sequences were not original artwork related to the story but drawn from ""The New Adventures of Superman"" cartoon series of the 1960s and some materials from the 1970/1980s ""Super Friends"" series. I'm not dissing those series (I grew up watching them) but the use of the pre-existing/non-related images really make the intro look like it was done on the cheap.

2) The art for this video adaptation was a far cry from the art of the original comic book story which DC/Warners try to emulate with these videos. Again, it looks like they did this one on the cheap.",1438560000,,857,4.66887417218543

5099237,4,B007MCUAD6,"Upon meeting the Elite, Superman hopes to have found new allies in his quest against evil, but when he discovers they bring a new brand of justice to the table, he must make a stand against them.

Thats basically the premise of the movie and its not so much a story with the fate of the planet hanging in the balance, but rather a story about the fate of how villains should be dealt with hanging in the balance. Bottom line is the question: is the world ready to move on from using temporal solutions to stop criminalssuper or otherwiseto permanently stopping them by simply killing them?

Superman believes in the potential good in everyone whereas the Elite, led by Manchester Black, believes that if you mess up, you should die to a) bring justice to whatever crime you did, and, b) stop any future chance of it happening again. While in a way you can see where hes coming from, his black-and-white view of how to deal with evil leaves a lot to be desired. If anything, his view mirrors Supermans in that justice must come to pass, but Superman also believes in mercy and forgiveness and the idea of learning ones lesson then trying to make a positive go at things versus getting one shot and if you blow it then thats it.

Part of this movie asks the question about Supermans place in our modern society and if his ideals and motives are still relevant. Face it, we live in a very cynical, hard-edged world where people would sooner see the worst in otherswhile missing the bad in themselves, of coursethan acknowledge peoples shortcoming(s) for what they are, try to fix the issue(s), forgive and move on. This is the product of a self-centered societyespecially in the Westso self-centered that we won't even acknowledge we have this issue (or get mad when confronted with it), thus creating the need to produce movies like Superman vs the Elite as, it seems, there are only a few who want to bring it to light.

Thats the deeper stuff. The lighter stuff is this movie has a fairly interesting story to bring the above to pass. I did find it slow in parts. The action sequences were pretty good, especially when Superman starts battling the Elite. I wasn't a fan of the art direction, though, and have seen better presentations of Superman and his supporting cast in other direct-to-video DC movies.

If it weren't for the strong themes of this movie, I wouldve given it a three, but because its about something important, it gets bumped up a point.

I do recommend this movie if you're not sure if Superman is still relevant today or if you find him an unrelatable hero. This flick might change that for you. Take a look and decide for yourself.",1428969600,2,2653,4.563025210084033

This animated movie is based on Action Comics #775 where Superman meets four super-powered individuals who have their own methods of handling criminals. It was most interesting seeing Superman be outmatched and witness how these newcomers perceived Supermans values. Equally as thought provoking was viewing how Superman himself had to deal with their different approach of handling many types of issues. Some viewers might be put off by the character-design, but aside from that, the film is solid from beginning to end.

5099262,5,B007MCUAD6,"Note: This review gives plot details but not many spoilers, I think!

The only complaint anybody can have about the movie is the 80's style Saturday morning cartoon animation. But it really fits perfectly with the theme of the movie, which is ""Does the idealistic Superman fit in today's modern, cynical society?"" It's a perfect visual representation of the contrast between the traditional and the post-post-modern preference for meaningless abstract art.

The philosophical (and even theological) implications in this movie (and the comic it's based on, A.C. 775) are immense. You will find yourself rooting for the bad guys, as the moral ambiguity of their methods seems more practical, and as Manchester Black (leader of the Elite) points out, Superman doesn't understand the fear that mortal humans feel when dealing with evil and violence because he can't be hurt. The Elite decide who's bad, and kill them. Period.

The Elite and Superman get along at first, until Superman learns that the Elite will simply execute anybody who they decide are ""bad guys"" including politicians, terrorists, criminals, etc. without due process or rule of law. That's when they get sideways with each other.

The movie climaxes with Manchester Black naming himself the ultimate dictator of the planet, as he lectures everybody about the superiority of his survival of the fittest, might makes right philosophy, and the world watches in sorrow and horror as the Elite annihilate and destroy Superman.

But finally, Superman caves to the Elite's philosophy, and...well, it can be summed up in this simple exchange:

""Is that... Superman?""
""Not anymore...""

(Spoiler: it's still Superman, but he's SERIOUSLY P.O.'d)

Moral of the story is be glad that Superman is an idealist, you do NOT want to see the alternative! Except in this movie!

5099266,4,B007MCUAD6,"Manchester Black: ""This is a call-out to the shadow cabinets, petty dictators and all-around tossers of the world. You're on notice. We're not bound by lines on a map or political alliances or government bodies of any kind. We are our own bosses, and we have a very simple job. There are the good guys, namely us and the bad guys, namely anyone who treats anyone else like trash to further their petty aims. We turn bad guys into memories. So mind your manners, lads and lasses or we'll blow your house down. We're the Elite. You asked for us, world. Now you got us.""

What happens when the ideals that Superman espouses and represents come up against the reality of a public that wants permanent solutions and a team of ""heroes"" that is willing to provide them?

The Elite are a group of four super-powered heroes who weren't raised in idyllic environments and who have a decidedly different outlook than Superman, an outlook where might makes right, where heroes can be judge, jury, and executioner, and where ultimate solutions are to be embraced rather than avoided. The group consists of Manchester Black, psychic powers, Coldcast, energy absorption and generation, Menagerie, generating alien weaponized bioforms, and the Hat, a magician who can produce wonders from his hat. There are no lines this group is unwilling to cross, no boundaries that they fear to violate.

Ultimately, this is a story about a battle between two opposing views of the world. And the debate itself is centuries old, with Ben Franklin in 1775 noting: ""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."" Initially, the Elite have the advantage, as they are more media-savvy than is Superman, they are seen as the next generation, they're taking down people like the Atomic Skull who everyone agrees should die, and so on. In fact, the Atomic Skull plays right into their hands, as Superman had fought the villain and had imprisoned him, only to see him escape and murder more innocent civilians before Manchester Black takes him out once and for all.

These two visions of the world and of being a superhero collide as the Elite take on Superman, head to head, with the former willing to use deadly force to make their point. As Lois says in talking to Superman on the eve of the battle, ""I think they can beat you!... I'm sorry. But they're willing to go places you won't."" I'm not going to go into the details of the battle or the outcome other than to say that it's a very satisfying and nail-biting fight and solution.

The animation is decent, with the depictions of the Elite particularly effective. I was a bit less impressed with this version of Superman, whose massive chin detracted a bit. The voice acting was superb, with great performances from George Newbern (Superman) and Robin Atkin Downes (Manchester Black). All in all, a satisfying movie.",1390608000,3,2909,4.81

5099274,5,B007MCUAD6,"I just took a look at a relatively recent animated Superman film, Superman vs. The Elite. I am very glad I did. This has been, without a doubt, one of the best Superman media in recent years, and one of the best representations of the character that I have ever seen.

The plot of this animated feature is based on one particular issue of the comic series, and a relatively recent one at that. Taken from Action Comics #775, ""Whatever Happened to Truth, Justice, and the American Way?"", written by Joe Kelly back in 2001. Kelly himself wrote the adaptation, so he pretty much gives his approval on the faithfulness of that adaptation since he did himself. The plot of this film (and by extension, the comic book on which it is based) is that Superman must deal with this new team of superhuman antiheroes called the Elite. The elite are led by Manchester Black, who has telekinetic and telepathic abilities. The other members are Coldcast, who can manipulate electromagnetic energy; the Hat, who possesses a magical hat from which he can summon demons and other things; and Menagerie, who has access to some sort of symbiotic alien life form that summon and control alien creatures from her body. The Elite are of the persuasion that superheroes who simply turn in criminals to prison, as opposed to killing them outright, are being too soft on evil, with Superman being the metaphorical embodiment of this ideology. To this end, the Elite make use of lethal force when combating their enemies, in direct opposition to Superman and his methods. The world, it seems, are on the side of the Elite, and they want more permanent solutions to problems like criminals and violence. Superman begins to question his place in the world, and whether or not his ideals are outdated in an ever-changing world. A climactic showdown is imminent, of both powers and ideologies, as the Elite prove a formidable test of not only Superman's abilities, but also the very core of his morals.

This film has great art direction and style. It is very similar to what we've seen before from the DCAU, but distinctive enough for its own look. Superman, for the most part, looks pretty good, although, his massive chin makes him look like genetic fusion of Jay Leno and Bruce Campbell. The voice cast, as is per the norm with DC in general and these animated pictures, his stellar, and a mix of the old and the new. George Newbern returns as the Man of Steel, back from the Justice League animated series. As here as it was there, Newbern can perfectly convey both Superman's authority and strength with his human vulnerability. Another returning DCAU alum, David Kaufman as Jimmy Olsen also does good, although he only gets a few throwaway lines. Pauley Perrette (whom you may recognize as Abby from NCIS) acts as a good replacement for Dana Delany, conveying both the sternness and caring of Lois Lane/Kent. Robin Atkin Downes also does really well as Manchester Black. His English accent is sick, but not to the point of being not understandable, although I will admit that a few of the British idioms that he used went over my head, but that's not a big deal. The rest of the cast does pretty good as well, with some people I haven't heard of, and other veteran voice actors like Dee Bradley Baker, Tara Strong, and Fred Tatasciore.

The opening credits have an interesting feel. It's a montage of old-time Superman footage (like from the Ruby-Spears cartoons and even the George Reeves serials) against 1980s pop-culture art like that of Roy Lichtenstein. We gives a very appropriate introduction of both the home watch two and a critique of ideas of an older time. There is also footage of a cartoon-within-a-cartoon that seems very much in the style of Rocky & Bullwinkle that depicts a clichd interpretation of Superman. It serves to open the debate of a simplistic viewpoint versus reality and how to deal with the evils of that reality. Shortly thereafter, Superman battles Atomic Skull (the Joseph Martin version, for the other nerds like me who actually care about that sort of minutiae), and instead of killing him, Superman sends him back to prison at Stryker's Island (the Metropolis super prison version of real-life New York's Riker's Island) rather than kill him. Superman then gives a press conference at the United Nations. This scene in particular is done well because it furthers and demonstrates the central ideological conflict of this film, that is should superheroes that possess sufficient power right out kill criminals and other evil people and take along to their own hands as opposed to allowing the legal system to determine and levy punishment. Superman claims he is not judge, nor jury, nor executioner of anyone. This is a brilliant discussion of Superman's principles and what he stands for and represents both to his fictional world and to our real world.

Not long after, Superman encounters the Elite. The introductory scene of the elite is good, in that it shows that the Elite are both morally ambiguous and dangerous to those whom they considered to be against them. At first, it seems the Elite are Superman's allies, and they help him with a terrorist incident in England. The story that Manchester Black gives about his origins serves its purpose in being sympathetic, although it does seem fairly standard ""tragic childhood backstory"" for comic books. It quickly becomes apparent that not only are the Elite willing to use lethal force against their foes, they embrace it. This confrontation reaches a head during a battle between the fictional nations of Bialya and Pokolistan (which I assume to be real-world analogies to nations like Israel and Palestine, or essentially any other extreme regime from the volatile nations of that region). I admit that this part of the film seems a little odd, in the sense that the weapons that these two nations use seem particularly bizarre unrealistic. However they don't fully break my suspension of disbelief because I am familiar with this sort of thing and it's fairly normal for comic book stories. In particular, it seems reminiscent of the extreme science fiction of the Silver Age. Shortly after that confrontation, the Elite challenge Superman to a final fight, to cement their assertion of their ideology over Superman's. I won't give away the details of the climax nor the ending, but I will say that this climactic battle is legitimately intense and actually frightening in some aspects. The film will get those were not familiar with this story to believe the things that they are seeing on screen.

Another aspect of this film that I enjoyed is that there is a great dynamic between Clark Kent/Superman and Lois. At this point in the history of the comic books, they had been married for some time, and it shows here. They have good ""couple banter"" and Lois serves as a good confidant in Superman's life and to balance his alter ego.

For the most part, the DVD extras are very good. There is an interview with the writer, Joe Kelly, about his original comic book story and the characters of the Elite. He explains each one well and also he goes into more detail of the other comic book stories that they featured in. There is also a brilliant documentary that serves as a sort of philosophical treatise on the methodology and ideology of Superman and his role in both his fictional world in our real world. They bring in various experts from various fields to discuss this idea both in context of the story and the realities of the real world. It fits brilliantly in with my overall feeling of this film and that it perfectly captures the character of Superman. Also as per the norm with these DC animated films, there are a few selected episodes of Superman: The Animated Series, although I may be mistaken, but I think one of them may have appeared before on a previous film release. Nonetheless, they're both good episodes. There are also standard trailers. What negative thing I will say about the DVD extras is that it advertises a digital comic version of the original issue that the story is based on, but in only offers a preview of a few pages towards the end of the story. I was disappointed in this; I was expecting the full issue, but I was let down in that regard.

Overall, I love this film. The animation and voice direction are superb, but what really nails it down is the story and the moral weight it carries. It is a brilliant discussion of Superman's morality, and the place it holds in our national conscience. This film perfectly understands the character of Superman, something that I find a welcome reprieve when another recent live-action film, which shall remain unnamed, completely failed to do this, in my opinion. I definitely recommend this to all fans of Superman and comics in general. This is the real Superman, and no other film that I've seen with him in it perfectly captures what it means to be the Man of Steel like this film does.",1372896000,15,8945,4.782018111254851

5099282,3,B007MCUAD6,"Superman vs. The Elite is the third standalone Superman movie in the DC animated direct-to-video lineup.  In a way, however, it does not feel like a Superman movie at all.  I probably like this a bit more than All-Star Superman, but I still found it underwhelming.

Superman/Clark and Lois are very likable in this film.  Superman especially is made very human in this which is the best thing about the movie.  In fact I will say that Superman is made more human and down to earth in this film then in any other movie or series since Superman TAS.  In the movie through the Elite (the villains of the film) Superman faces a great moral dilemma of whether his ideals still hold up in today's time or if his morality is outdated and no longer needed.  This is easily the best aspect of the film.  This is also a very personal story for Lois in whether she still has faith in Superman or not.  I also like how smart Superman is in the film, especially at the end.  People always say Superman is all brawn, but that is not the case.  Watch this movie or Superman TAS and you will see that Superman can be pretty smart when he needs to be.
The voice cast does a great job here.  George Newborn, who voiced Superman in Justice League, reprises his role here and he is great.  Pauley Perrette voices Lois Lane here and she does a good job.  She is not my favorite Lois Lane, but she is far from the worst that I have seen.  The other voice actors did fine as well.  The voices for The Elite work well for the characters.

However, I do have issues with the movie.  As I said earlier this does not really feel like a Superman film.  This film does not even feel like it takes place in the DC universe.  The film feels more like it takes place in Vertigo comics and they just chucked Superman in there.  The Elite themselves do not feel like villains Superman would fight.  They do not even seem like villains of the DC universe.  The movie does have Atomic Skull in it.  He and Superman himself are the only things that verify that this is a DC story.  Personally, I do not like The Elite as villains.  I like the moral conflict they present, but other than that I do not care for them.  I do not buy them as foes that would pose a huge challenge for Superman either.

The art style of the film, like All-Star Superman, takes some getting used to.  To be honest I still do not care much for the art.  The animation is nice and the fights are fun to watch as usual.

Overall out of all the Superman animated movies that have come out so far this one is probably the second best (in my opinion), but there is not much competition.  I like how human Superman is made here.  I also like the moral dilemma Superman is put in throughout the movie.  However, I am not a fan of the look of the film, or the Elite themselves.

The good: the clever dialogue, great voice acting, and original action sequences. The villains have interesting new tricks so that the fights don't have to be a slug fest. The environments are beautifully rendered. The animation is fluid and beautiful: I loved seeing the Supes fly up, stop and turn in mid-air, with the cape flowing. I also love Newbern's performance,  he brings certain vulnerability to his Superman. Supes may be invulnerable physically, he still has emotions.

The character design is an acquired taste. So is the voice of Lois. But after watching it a couple of times,I don't mind them.

What doesn't work is the debate. Why would people blame superheros for criminals escaping and killing again? That just means the law enforcement system did not work. Superheros don't have to kill because that's what death penalty is for.

Overall, the clever dialogue and beautiful animation made it worthwhile.",1369612800,,944,5.143790849673203

When i finally got aroudn to watching it, which was actually before my purchase, I was taken aback with how good it was. Like GOOD.

This isn't to say that the story isn't good.  It's a good solid story, and particularly appealing if you are politically liberal.  But the artwork detracts from the story like persistent static on a radio station.  The only exception to this seemed to be the lavish backrounds and (oddly) the airplane pilots in one scene.  Everyone and everything else was well below the Bruce Timm's normal standards, and disappointing as a result.

5099288,4,B007MCUAD6,"First, a word of warning.  This film is rated PG-13 for a reason.  Do -not- show it to young children.  Apart from the violence and sexual innuendos in the film, most children just wouldn't understand the message, and would probably find it too terrifying as well; especially near the end.

The history of the development of this story doesn't really take long to explain.  Back at the end of the 90s, and the start of the new millennium, a comic book was published (oddly by DC, under the Wildstorm imprint,) called ""the Authority.""  The series was essentially about a group of self-centered, gang-like, deeply amoral jerks with superpowers, who nonetheless fight crime and protect the Earth, but also take it upon themselves to act as judge, jury and executioner, even over whole governments.

The series became rather popular when it was first published, and in response, in March 2001, a comic book was published (Action Comics 775,) called ""What's so Funny About Truth, Justice and the American Way?""  In this comic, Superman does battle with a group called ""The Elite;"" who are very much like the Authority in most respects.  The comic's premise refuted (I think, quite successfully,) the ethical standpoint of the ""Authority"" books, and reaffirmed the reasons that Superman has always had for his devotion to truth and justice.  The book sold wonderfully, though it wasn't -universally- liked, largely because there are people out there who just don't like Superman, and never will, regardless of how well he's written.

I hate to say it, but I think a fair number of people will claim to dislike the movie for this reason alone.  Some people just don't like Superman, and they want him to lose, and suffer along the way.  Needless to say, I'm not convinced by this viewpoint, and I don't think I ever will be, though I admit, some of the Superman films have made it awfully hard to like him at times.

The premise of this movie is that the Elite; (a lizard-like woman named Menagerie who can produce powerful, destructive slugs/snakes/bugs from her body, an electric-powered tough guy named Coldcast, a drunken magician named Hat, and their leader; a powerful psychic called Manchester Black,) appear and assist Superman in stopping a rampaging monster.  However, Superman doesn't trust them, because they seem to enjoy hurting people, and soon, the elite set themselves up as judge, jury and executioner, claiming to act outside of, and above, any legal body.  This, of course, leads to a conflict between them and Superman, when they begin to murder people for their crimes.  However, he has a hard time fighting them, not just because of their power, but because the world at large seems to prefer the Elite, and enjoy watching them work.

Spoilers for the next paragraph.

Superman's solution is ultimately to pretend to adopt the philosophy of the Elite, and he defeats them, one by one, in a way that looks as if he were killing them ruthlessly.  When people react to this in horror, he reminds them that they're reacting that way because murder shouldn't be used as a weapon of justice; that a better way needs to be found, and that, after all, the old Superman's philosophy was the correct one.  He then reveals that it was all a trick, and that he didn't really kill anyone.

I certainly agree with Superman that murder is not a viable moral option in solving our problems.  Even if we're under attack, if we have the chance to disable our enemies without killing them, we should take it.  Killing is moral, only in instances where you are legitimately defending someone's life, and killing is the only way to do so.  Murder, however, is never justified; even in legitimate defense.

Superman gets some good lines in this movie, about how we can't just toss morality in the garbage because it's inconvenient, and how we need to all be working, not just for the crushing of evil, but for good.  These are all important moral lessons.

Sadly, such lessons often lose much of their force in the modern world, which has rejected all of the tried and true moral lists (such as the Ten Commandments,) and if you don't have a -list- of what's moral and what isn't, how can you tell when a person is being immoral?

It could also be said that there's something not quite kosher about Superman deceiving the people of the Earth about what he was really up to.  I wouldn't go so far as to say it was -immoral,- but it's a little awkward, for someone who claims to represent truth first.

On the whole, though, I enjoyed this movie, and I thought it was much needed, in this age of amoral selfishness and moral relativism.  It's just sad to see so many people treating it as just another chess piece in the hand of their opponent, rather than actually listening to what it says.",1369008000,2,4784,4.7334137515078405

5099296,4,B007MCUAD6,"I've always enjoyed comic author Warren Ellis' work.  His voice was new, jaded, and cynical - in a world where superheroes were black and white, Ellis was a dark shade of gray.  I collected issues of Stormwatch and Planetary, both of which reinforced Ellis' ethos: the inherent evil of corporations, a corrupt America, and a selfish nature of humanity.  This is the new world of superheroes: global, amoral, and casually violent with their power.  All of this is critical in appreciating ""Superman vs. the Elite,"" which is Joe Kelly's response to Ellis' jaded world view.  And what better vehicle to defend the American Way than with Superman?

""Superman vs. the Elite"" is an animated version of the comic that answered this question, ""What's so Funny About Truth, Justice & the American Way?""  The Elite consists of superheroes that play at the level of Superman: super-psychic Manchester Black (Robin Atkin Downes), energy-absorbing bruiser Coldcast (Catero Colbert), oversexed bioform Menagerie (Melissa Disney), and monster-summoning magician The Hat (Andrew Kishino).  Black is a Brit (he wears a Union Jack shirt - actually, it's a tattoo!) who has little respect for anyone, including Superman.  But the methods of his Elite team soon become globally renowned for their methods against Bialyan ""terrorists.""

It's not hard to see echoes of 9/11 and the War on Terror lurking on the fringes of this philosophical argument between justice and the ends justifying the means. Superman (George Newbern, reprising his role from the DC Animated Universe) at first tries to get along with these newcomers, leading them with tactics he's earned as a seasoned superhero. It doesn't last.

The Elite believes in torture and murder to get the job done - and their methods are soon endorsed by the world in the face of endless war. It's not long before Superman is forced to defend first his ethos, then himself when psychotic villain the Atomic Skull (Dee Bradley Baker) escapes from a justice system Superman endorses, only to kill again.

What makes ""Superman vs. The Elite"" so interesting is that it's not afraid to play on a higher level.  Superman endorses a cheesy cartoon because it spreads his message, just as The Elite ensure that their every move is telecast to the world. This is a war of ideas that just happens to be settled with fisticuffs.

If you're not aware of the dichotomy between old and superhero styles, ""Superman vs. The Elite"" seems like a curious detour for an iconic character.  The Elite are powerful enough that it's hard to believe they've never crossed paths with Superman before.  But if you can accept that they're a foil for Superman to test his super-brand, this is a very compelling entry in a grim-and-gritty world defined by Batman ethics.",1362268800,7,2773,5.008714596949891

5099298,4,B007MCUAD6,"DC animation is just crushing Marvel in this deparment.  DC shows how committed Superman is to his values, and how strong he is within those values.  While you'd find yourself understanding why the Elite make the decisions they make - which is more on the emotional ~ grey side ~ Superman just proves that they boyscout in him won't let up!",1361318400,,340,4.557377049180328

5099300,5,B007MCUAD6,"Superman is typically known for his action sequences rather than plot, but this particular film proves the exception to the rule. Often the argument has been made that the big blue boy scout is too dated to be relevant. It was only a matter of time before writers decided to focus on the issue to develope a new story. Thus we get Superman vs. the Elite.

I was worried that this film was just another slugfest pitting olde Supes against another generic team to lay waste to the city. Luckily, it turned out to be much more than that. The Elite are a new age group of anti-heroes that pose as a perfect foil to Superman's traditional values. The film runs the gamut of all the issues on hand, from the tights and capes to the twisted and violent origin stories.

The animation also isn't nearly as bad as other people say. The artwork is a bit simplistic compared to other animated features like the direct-to-dvd marvel features, but for a DC animated feature it's par for the course. The design is a bit simplistic, but still much better than your average DC television animation, like the Justice League and Superman cartoons from back when. The animation is very smooth and there are some excellent effects for the various action sequences. This film may be more focused on the story, but there's plenty of hard-hitting, flashy action scenes to distract you.

It's rare to come across a quality Superman animation. This is one. I highly recommend it to anyone, whether or not you're a fan of Superman.",1360540800,3,1505,4.629213483146067

5099302,5,B007MCUAD6,"This movie is completely fantastic! This movie takes place around the moral dilemma when it comes to the original golden age Superman of Earth-One (or at least I believe so in my opinion), and his high moral plane of authority. A new superhero squad calling themselves, the Elites, are making a stand against the Man of Steel saying that the villains of the world should be put down. While Superman of course is standing by how superheroes like themselves are not above the law and are certainly not executioners. That super heroes should lead by examples! You would think by just reading that, that everything would be leaned towards Superman's point of view, but quite frankly, both sides make very powerful and persuasive arguments. Now the Elite kind of come off as a-holes, which is to be expected from an anti-hero team, but yet again, the popular vote swings greatly in their favor rather than Superman's ""old ways of thinking"". The theme is so embroidered into this movie that even the style of animation even exemplifies it, from Superman's old fashion big chin and barrel chest, to the Elite's slicker more modern as well as punk look. I guarantee you that if you watch this with a group of friends that it will spark up a moral debate on the matter! And that is the marker of any great movie!",1359849600,2,1303,4.6695652173913045

That being said I still have a hard time dealing with Bruce Timm and the writers of these stories as they choose to use in my opinion extremely bad language in conjunction with this and all new DC animated movies. The B word was thrown all over the place in Wonder Woman, and has found its stage on most of the DC animated Superheros films along with just about every other swear word that you can think of. This is my concern and should be yours if you have children that are use to Young Justice and you believe that how much worse can it be, say if I purchase Superman VS The Elite, trust me Its over the top.

The message of this movie is to poise the question of why we should like superheroes like Superman and not like the titular villains who would be better described as anti-heroes. The Elite are superheroes who are not afraid to kill. The movie does a fair job at answering this question, but too often it feels like they have to preach the message instead of simply showing it.

The only fault with th argument is that there's a halfway point between the views - Superman KNOWS that Atomic Skull will kill people, and at this point it's absurd that he hasn't gotten a death penalty from the legitimate law. On the other hand, the opposition view, that serial killers who have been killing scores of people for decades should die, is represented by kill-happy psychos - can't there be a halfway point, like someone who understands the need for killing metavillians, but doesn't get off on it?

Overall I loved it, and I don't understand the complaints about the animation. I thought it totally lived up to the standard that the Animated DCU has established over the last 15 years.",1356998400,2,985,4.69364161849711

We have Superman, the butt of cartoon jokes, trying to protect Metropolis.  He takes down one villain but at the expense of much property damage.  Why not just kill the guy?  Think of how much money we would save in property damage!

Clearly Supe's pals are a bit twisted in what they consider moral and ethical.  Even the people want a rougher treatment of criminals.  The Elite, a loosely put together band of anti-heroes, takes up the Superman mantle and beat him up in the process.  Possessing no morality, they have little regard for the bad guy.

The real challenge can't be stopping a plane from crashing, it's gotta be more. DC animation knows this and nails it pretty much every time.

5099324,3,B007MCUAD6,"I have mixed feelings about Superman Vs. The Elite.  On the one hand, I appreciate the decidedly darker and more mature content than we're used to seeing in these DC direct releases.  This movie poses the question that people have long had on their mind--namely, should superheroes, and Superman in particular, adopt corporal punishment as a means of combating crime?  The public is, frankly, quite weary of super villains who destroy property, harm innocent people, and constantly find ways out of society's revolving door prisons.

On the other hand, while it seems like a good plot the delivery is a bit skewed.  Superman stands as a steadfast example of compassion and moral justice, but the Elite and their message is sometimes hard to swallow.  Granted, the Elite's dialogue is decent enough and several character deaths give credence to their harsher stance on crime, but in all honesty, they are poor candidates to make the message.  Manchester Black, especially, with his nonchalant attitude and English accent seems to detract from the seriousness of this philosophy.  The rest of the Elite, who range from a pedestrian looking drunkard and a serpentine female, also appear unworthy as champions to Superman's dark reflection.

It's an okay watch if you want to kill some time, but you're not missing out on anything if you decide to skip it.",1351468800,,1352,5.026905829596412

5099329,1,B007MCUAD6,"This recent DC animated movie was just not good on any level. The basic premise is a philosophical debate/battle between Superman and a ""Squadron Supreme""-style knock off of Warren Ellis' The Authority.  Mimicking Ellis' ""Under New Management"" Stories in The Authority, The Elite want to use their powers to run the world, quickly and brutally kill the bad guys, and bully nations into following their directives.

The first problem is that The Elite are an-all-too-pale knock off of The Authority. So it becomes a bit of a strawman argument instead of a debate between equals. The characters are not likable or engaging. But we do get to hear the word ""wanker"" a lot and the word ""ass"" even more. Hey, it's PG 13, so why not? Because it's Superman, people! Language!

The second big annoyance is that Superman himself is not even a little bit consistent with his ideals in the way he fights for them, nor is he sensible, thoughtful, mature ... or anything you would expect Superman, the old hand at superheroics to be. Supposedly, he is letting everyone think he has gone to the ""dark side"" in order to then teach a lesson about NOT going to the dark side. It makes about as much sense as Batman in The Dark Knight deciding he has to let the world think he is a murderer and a terrorist so people won't lose faith by finding out Harvey Dent is a killer and a psycho. Huh?

All indications and comments seem to suggest that Superman's Justice League team-mates do exist in some form in this version of things. Yet, when their superfriend is apparently being killed on worldwide TV, none of them are available to even try to help. Are they all on vacation? Taking a personal day? Bad hair day?

The worst thing about Superman vs The Elite is that it is just so, so much weaker in every way than the Bruce Timm, Paul Dini version of Superman seen in Justice League, Superman: The Animated Series, and occasionally Batman and Batman Beyond. It has been almost ten years since that series, but it still far, far outshines this current effort by any standard by which you care to measure--except maybe most uses of the word ""wanker"".",1348876800,9,2128,4.604221635883905

5099335,5,B007MCUAD6,"** This review is for Superman vs the Elite BD**

Conscience versus the Will to get something done. A new group of heroes march onto Superman's block and leave him feeling less than positive of a first impression. It quickly degenerates into a world who wants to get back against the villains - with due prejudice. And soon, the world is put against its axis. When is wrong being right? Well, we are talking about Superman, aren't we?

So we've got a new DC animated flick. While us fans want to see a feature with the Flash, Martian Manhunter, Hawk Man, et al. I'll shelve that argument for now. DC once again gives us a mature look behind the philosophy of the difference right and wrong, and how hard it can be to maintain the good above the bad. And they do this little morality tale with strong storytelling, amazing voice acting, kind of a throwback animation that reminds me of the great animated series. An the music, it brings in the Superman theme very well without overwhelming us with the same refrain every time.

The special features are just as elite. Featurettes, a digital comic, commentary, a look at the upcoming the Dark Knight Returns (part one), Bruce Timm top two episodes of the Superman animated series and a photo gallery for the Dark Knight Rises film.

This is just solid gold. While Marvel rules the theatres, DC knocks the animated tales out all animated films so hard they don't land. Never. Here's hoping they keep it up.

For all of us who are huge fans of DC comics and their animated adaptations I have to say this one is a definite keeper.  At first the Elite appear as a force to stand along side the Man of Steel and promote justice in all its forms, but over time the Elite's true nature appears, they believe they can be judge, jury, and executioner.  Superman wasn't meant to be political at first but the more the movie progresses the more political the plot seems to get, who is right?  The Elite say that people who commit heinous  crimes should be punished heinously, Superman says everyone deserves a chance for redemption, it's a harder road not to take these people out, it would be easier to skip due process, but due process is the right thing to do.  Superman believes he is a symbol to inspire people to become better than even they believe is possible.  In the end it appears Superman falls away from his principles and takes the Elite's stand, that sometimes you have to put the animals down...  Is this the end of the Man of Steel as we know him?

We live in a world today where people are alive that are crazy enough to push a button that can wipe out an entire people's existance. While it is never the right way to fight violence with violence, do we now live in a world where it may the right solution? Superman is really put to the test for his character and his morals and in this film we see just how far he would be willing to go before he gets pushed off the edge. The other question is, if the greatest hero of a generation did in-fact go off the edge...what happens next?

Again another enjoyable film with a great story voice cast and plenty of action. The animation is something that makes you a bit uncomfortable at first, but as the film goes on it ends up being the least of the films' problems. The next film will in fact be one that will stand a true test, being taken from debatibly the greatest comic book story ever told. I have a feeling knowing how things have been up until this point in the DCAU it's all good.",1344384000,3,1574,4.296296296296297

5099345,4,B007MCUAD6,This was a good movie with a decent plot. The animation was a bit blocky but tolerable. The fight scenes are full of action and the Elite are a formidable opponent for Superman but not because of shear power only but the alien tech these guys have helps a lot.,1343606400,,260,4.22
5099346,3,B007MCUAD6,"As much as I love the story line and the script, the animation level is unforgivably low. In fact, it is so low, that the movie opens with Kent and Lois commenting on the poor animation of a Superman fund-raising cartoon, kind of a joke-within-a-joke. The intention of this may have been to get the audience to look past the poor animation quality, rather it calls even more attention to it.

While I agree story comes first and matters most, in an animated movie the quality of its animation matters! In short, if the question is ""Which is a better animated movie, strong writing and weak animation or weak writing and strong animation?"" the only true answer is ""STRONG WRITING & STRONG ANIMATION.""

5099348,4,B007MCUAD6,"I had a lot of hope for this one.  George Newbern (along with Tim Daly) are the best Supermans since Christopher Reeves.  The story was very well adapted and has been noted, very timely.

However...why was it necessary to draw Clark as if he had just stepped out of a page from a MAD Magazine parody?

In a story line where Clark's ideals, methods, and credibility are being questioned, Clark needed to be taken seriously.  It is very difficult to take ANYONE seriously who looks like the Tick! This was a very inapproriate artistic choice on someone's part. (Also it is difficult to hide that jaw behind a pair of glasses!)

5099349,3,B007MCUAD6,"For the Parents - It's okay to let the kids watch this.  Although, there are a lot of adult themes  There is also lots values; right and wrong, and redemption stuff.

For the rest -  Don't expect to see anything on-par with Pixar, Dreamworks or Cartoon Network.  The animation is a hybrid of Anime and the 1970s Hannah-Barbera; which is just awful.  The entire animation team is Japanese, so my guess is that someone came along and said, there can't be an Anime Superman.  But it was too late to fire the team, so they had to change to a more traditional style of animation, or at least try to.

My biggest complaint is that the characters look like, well, cartoon characters.  If your going to take on Superman, you probably should look more like Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones, or Ray Stevenson; you don't want to look like Steve Buschemi.

The story is based on Action comics #775, ""What's So Funny About Truth, Justice & the American Way?""  Not trying to go all geek on you, but it is an amazing comic and story.  I won't say this is loosely based on that, since the key components are there.  But the added sub plots do nothing for the story.

The plot takes you the long way home and eventually gets you to a conclusion.  If you've got 90 minutes to kill, and you've seen everything else, it won't be the worst movie you've watched.

Although, this movie does make me long for more digital comics.  Where the actually comic, as if you were reading it is brought to life.",1342483200,,1473,4.41635687732342
5099350,5,B007MCUAD6,"I loved Superman vs the Elite. It has all of my Superman essentials, and none of my deal breakers.

My favorite parts were the scenes with Lois and Clark/Superman. This movie shows their relationship in its perfect form. No hero worshiping Lois, no Clark with an unrequited crush and no hot/cold Superman, these are just two people very much in love without any over the top sugary sweet sappiness or complications of a 2.5 sided triangle. It shows Lois being herself, a three-dimensional character with all the beauty and grace of a rose without losing any of the thorns. She will poke, pinch and bite with every word out of her mouth, but Clark can see right through that and even smiles at her all too real threats. We also see that Clark doesn't pull any punches either, at least where their professional lives are concerned.
For Instance...
Lois: ""It's a given I'm getting the scoop on these newbies, right?""
Clark: ""Not unless you can type 5,000 words a minute.""
Lois: ""Don't make me unleash my feminine whiles on you, Clark Kent.""
Clark: ""Too Late."" [Hitting send button]
Lois: ""For someone who plays fair, you can really suck sometimes.""
...[Perry talking to Clark about the story story.]
Perry: ""Clark, you've got the point on this story"" ... ""take Lane if she's still talking to you.""
Lois: [to Clark]""Hope you like cold showers, Smallville.""

This entire scene is delivered tongue-in-cheek, and exploding with subtext. This dialogue really brings out the characters love for each and makes the scenes where Clark is confiding in her about his relevance in this modern world just that much more poignant. But even after Lois admits there are times when she personally wants the bad guys dead, she never varies in her support of her hero, even attempting to sway the crowd chanting for the death of The Atomic Skull, shouting ""Stop! Listen to Superman!""

As to the animation, while being totally forgettable, it also doesn't detract from story. Once I was three minutes in I was completely immersed and wasn't even thinking about the animation.

At this point I must point out my ignorance of pieces of the Superman story. I have only caught hit and miss of the books since the wedding arch, including not having read #775. (Insert excuses citing, real life, career and two small children.) Therefore, if there is any backstory of the Atomic Skull other than what little is mentioned in the movie, I don't know it. This being said, I wanted to say I was taken aback when Supes uses his cape to cover the body of the Atomic Skull. If there was some back story where they were friends at one point this makes more sense, but in the context of the movie, this makes Superman look like he is honoring a fallen hero and is too off-putting for me. I agree with Superman giving the corpse of Atomic Skull dignified treatment, but not an honored one. Get a body bag from the city morgue, give him an impromptu pyre or even use a clean white sheet, don't use a flag and definitely not the cape.
All in all, this is still my favorite animated Superman film to date. There were plenty of moments that kept me guessing. I loved Supes freeze and smash of the mech-bio-weapon bugs once he learned they were not alive. I loved the moment when Supes `goes bad' and started taking the Elite out. But in all honesty, I still hadn't bought `bad' Superman even with the ""Is that Superman?"", ""Not Anymore,"" reaction from the public. It wasn't until the moment he let the car hit Lois that I thought for second, ""OMG! NO!"" It was at that moment that the realization of what an out of control, angry Superman actually would mean. And to be frank, it scared me.
Thank you, Warner Brothers, DC Entertainment and Joe Kelly, for keeping Superman relevant in the age of modern warfare and terrorists. And thank you Jerry and Joe for giving life to the character in the first place. But most of all thank you, Superman, for being the beacon we will always need and for never failing to believe in us.

5099351,5,B007MCUAD6,"This is a great story for those fans that wish to understand the way Superman operates.

It would be so simple for him to kill his enemies and being done with it (like so many other so called 'heros' and 'heroines').

I recommend this story to all Superman fans, although I would be careful in showing it to small kids, as some scenes are very strong for an infant to process.

Have fun!",1342310400,,387,4.273972602739726
5099352,3,B007MCUAD6,"I thought this was a decent movie, however, I had 2 major problems.

First, I wanted more information on the villains. We all pretty much know what's going on with Supes, how about where does that conjuring dude get his dragons from, etc. The voices were well done, but pretty much there were only 2 characters featured. An expanded role would have been more interesting imo.

The ending was pretty ""Super Friends-ish"" What I mean by that is, it was kinda goofy to have 20 superbots to help superman defeat the villains. I suppose he could use the bots for any and all villians. Why not install thousands of superbots and just control them from a command center and retire?",1342137600,,673,4.6

5099354,5,B007MCUAD6,"For me this is probably the best DCUA FILM that has been relesed, the animation isn't perfect but its the story thats really engaging and thought provoking, it can be a bit of an eye opener and reflects alot of what we as people go through in order to solve everyday problems personally and politically. Alot of what superman has always represented becomes questioned, threatened, and attacked for reason being that when truth, justice, and the american way just doesn't work anymore, the alternative just seems better suited and easier in the present day world, if that sounds too cryptic its because I don't want to spoil the movie, just watch it and see for yourself.",1341964800,,670,4.7844827586206895

This is among their best work ever and a must watch for any fan of Superman, or DC Animation. First and foremost recognize the PG13 rating as it is well deserved and not something appropriate for under 13 year olds. This movie deals with some very powerful themes that should be taken very seriously and this movie thankfully does. The title, cover art, and look of the films films all said to me that this was going to be a so-so Superman movie aimed at kids, that follows typical animated super hero cliches. What I got was easily the best Superman story told to date and maybe even the best story about capital punishment as well. The ending of this film I never saw coming and was deeply moved by it's message that I won't spoil here. I plan to watch this with my son when he's old enough and then discuss the films themes.

5099356,5,B007MCUAD6,"And if you aren't either you'll love this entry in the DC universe, produced by (in my opinion) the best super hero producer, Bruce Timm. The story line is adult and serious, dealing with topics like terrorism, capital punishment, what is justice, and even who should be the judge of terrorists. I very much appreciate the adult format in the animation Timm produces. This topic has never, to my knowledge, been done in this form. I know many Japanimation movies deal with vengeance as justice, but to actually ask the question, ""Should horrible terrorists be executed without trial?"" as part of the story line is both unique and stimulating. Also, I am much more a fan of Batman than Superman, and I really enjoyed this. So if you are like me, you want intellectual animated movies and aren't too upset if they aren't cutting edge with their artwork, then this is a great buy!",1341619200,2,877,4.701298701298701
5099357,3,B007MCUAD6,"Before you read this, please remember the following:
1) I'm not a comics reader. I haven't bought a Superman comic since 1993.
2) I am by no means a fan boy. 90% of what I know about Superman comes from DC movies and the Superman animated series from the late 90's.

Now I consider myself a fan of the DC animated features, in fact I own most of them. I can honestly say I haven't run across one I regretted purchasing before I had seen it. Superman vs. The Elite is teetering on that line. The voice acting wasn't great, I felt like Perry White was someone doing an impression of J.K. Simmons playing J. Jonah Jameson from spider-man. Lois was so far off the mark that I don't even know where to begin. Everything about her just felt wrong, the voice, the attitude, the fact that she didn't even feel like the Lois Lane I know. If I had to pick the one thing that bothered me most about this movie it would be Lois. She just doesn't fit. Superman himself isn't terrible, the voice was believable, but overall this Superman just felt like he'd pretty much given up. He did more whining than I'd expect from an invulnerable man who can toss railroad cars around like they're toys.

The animation is sub-par as far as what I've come to expect from the DC animated features. Not nearly as good as All Star Superman, Green Lantern First Flight or Justice League: Doom. It felt kinda cheap and half hearted, almost as if they decided to take the animation team from the animated series and said ""make us a movie with just a little more detail than you do on the show"".

So what was good? Well the story itself was pretty decent. Done right Superman vs. The Elite could have been great, but the shortcomings in the animation and voice acting don't do justice to the story. Although, it was fun. I mean it's hard not to enjoy a cartoon about super powered people doing what they do.

All in all, it wasn't a bad movie, but just not as good as others I've seen. If you're considering buying this one, I'd say pass on it and go pick up All Star Superman or Justice League Doom.

Bottom line, if I had it to do over again, I'd have waited and picked up Superman vs. The Elite when I saw it on netflix or at redbox.",1341273600,5,2204,4.275779376498801
5099358,2,B007MCUAD6,"Don't let your youngsters watch! The violence is mean spirited, the language is not your normal comic book banter, and the story, . . .if you want to call it that, goes no where.  Through the whole torturous event I kept hoping another masked crusader would come to the aide of Superman, if only to save him from this dragging dialog.  My son, who loves this stuff was asleep before the first action scenes. Which was lucky, since the antagonist decided to start spewing his unnecessary expletives as soon as the violence ramped up.  There is a feel to comics, when they leap from page to screen, or from mental concept to visual experience. Unfortunately, this film never even came close, starting with the hard edged art work.  Marvel should fly back to Planet Hulk, and recharge some of its lost style.",1341100800,3,805,4.647887323943662
5099359,3,B007MCUAD6,"Superman has already had two of his own animated movies as part of the DC Universe line, including two team-up films with Batman, and been in all three Justice League movies. Trying to give fans a new boost of the Man of Steel in the pop media(probably because of the upcoming reboot film), this is an adaptation of the anniversary special in Action Comics #775 introducing an Authority-like superhero team into Superman's personal universe.

Superman fights the marauding Atomic Skull in the middle of Metropolis, but not without a few honest citizens getting disentigraged. Superman then finds out a foreign country is using giant monsters in their civil war, but is suprisingly helped by a new team of young heroes who call themselves The Elite. Their leader is the cocky telepathic Manchester Black. His teammates are Coldcast who can project and absorb nuclear energy, the winged Menegerie who can summon bizarre creatures directly out of her body, and their resident magic-user, The Hat. Superman is at first happy to recieve some new help in the world protection biz, because apparently like in all Superman movies there aren't any other superhero teams like the JLA. It becomes apparent though that The Elite don't pull punches as they kill some terrorists and waste Atomic Skull after he busts out of jail even more powerful. This makes The Elite new flavor of the week around the world. Superman begins to doubt whether his way of being a hero is effective in the 21st Century, but realizes that The Elite has to be stopped. After they go to far by axing the leaders of a war-torn nation, Superman challenges The Elite to a fight to the finish. They teleport to the moon, and at first it looks like Superman is deader than disco. Things go nightmarish for The Elite though as Superman seems to turn into freakin' General Zod, using his powers to take them down one-by-one. He finally stops Black by destroying his mental powers by giving him a heat-vision lobotomy. Superman reveals he was faking the whole going crazy thing at the end with some help from his Legion of Super-Robots. Truth, justice, and all that jazz are restored, but hopefully next time Supes will remember to call on Batman for some help!

This movie had some more harsher tones than the previous DC Universe entries, but the more cartoonish look to the characters seems to really derail alot of the maturity involved. George Newbern from the Justice League animated series returns as Superman, but aside from him there isn't much any remarkable voice actors in it. I'd suggest at least renting or downloading it, but not really worth shelling out the money to own it.",1340928000,2,2648,4.830396475770925

But... the artwork was breathtakingly inconsistent. It was as if the movie was drawn by two entirely separate teams that never communicated with each other at all. Unfortunately, some of the worst of it appeared during some of the most dramatic scenes. Fortunately, the final confrontation had a consistent look to it.

All in all, a flawed gem; but still highly recommended for teens and up. (This is not a children's story - pay attention to that PG-13 rating; they mean it.)",1340841600,,649,5.362745098039215

  It has action, STORY, romance and human believes about good and evil. Here you'll actually feel like the world can do well without Superman. The elite, a super-power team, enters the stage with a promise of world piece. Doing what Superman didn't do all this years: KILL the bad guys so they stop keep coming back for more chaos.
  For the fist time Superman will face his own believes and values, feeling that his outdated and outnumbered. But will he keep his goals or join The Elite? Watch the movie to find out!
  Many people complained about the animation. Well imo it was excellent! The fight scenes and the background were very good drawn same with the character designs. My only little problem was that in some scenes Superman had a big chin. I think they made it this way so you'll feel that superman is outdated and as the story progress you'll be cheering for the Man of Steel.
  So i just want to say to all Supermans and Dc fans out there to givi this a try. Its a very good movie with lots of serious questions and issues waiting to be answered!",1340841600,2,1253,4.3247863247863245

Having Superman as the hero at the center of this quandry made it more real to me, seeing as how one of his mottos is never to kill.  The Elite didn't seem to have that problem, and apparently neither did the fans that began to support them.  It a movie about morals and strength, even though the world that adopted and love you seem to be sliding toward the other side.  The animation, I must admit, was a little bit cartoonish for me, but the message was loud and clear.  Good work!",1340582400,,638,4.3277310924369745

This isn't like an entire series where a show can have a couple of bad ""filler"" episodes but still be deemed overall brilliant. DC had one shot to get this right and failed miserably. The look and quality of the animation, not to mention the Peter Griffin appearance of Supes, doomed this stinker. This direct-to-dvd movie has the cheapest quality animation yet. I'm shocked at Dc and hope they don't use that Korean animation studio again for any future titles. Some backgrounds are nicely composed/drawn -like the exterior of the Kent's Smallville farm house- but in some scenes the haven't even fleshed out the character faces (as they do in comics when the viewer/reader is ""really far away""); there is no need for that here. Some of the faces were literally two dots for eyes and a line for a mouth -- all while delivering dialog!

I will say that Manchester black had some nifty dialogue (probably lifted from the comic) and Pauley Perrette made for a spunky Lois - even if she had not much to do but fret over Clark/Superman.

Overall, I put this at the bottom of my DC Warner Premier pile. Yes, even under Emerald Knights.

It really shines near the end when Superman goes over the top - showing his abilities when he doesn't cut any corners. The animation is sub par. BUT on second viewing it seems good, and the story itself and the people in the Elite are quite varied. I also appreciated the nod to ""Chronicle"". You could almost say this is the last episode of ""chronicle"" if the immoral kid had survived. Best Superman overall, to date. If the live action movie could be 1/10 as good as this, it would make a billion dollars. But I suppose we'll see yet another film about Luthor making some crazy land deals and Superman stopping him. Without ever throwing a punch. Also, we all know that SM can't actually land a real blow on a human, as the person would become plasma. But they need to relax the rules as they did here in this movie. Perhaps have fun with it like the Hulk in Avengers (no spoliers!). Superman could flick his pinky VERY slowly (for him) and fling people across the room, for example. I also appreciated showing superman in real time - if you watch closely in some scenes there is a flash of red and blue, almost to quick to be seen.

5099368,3,B007MCUAD6,"I'm not here to bash Superman vs. The Elite per se but the movie left me feeling a bit uneasy and confused. I have nothing against a lighter-hearted, intentionally absurd approach to the increasing stream of dark and gritty DCU Animated movies as of late so I was pleasantly surprised by the opening titles omage to the more family-friendly Superman incarnations from the days of ol' as well as the first few minutes in but then the tone changes dramatically.

So people are dying, real world geopolitical debates are highlighted and a new breed of 'anything goes' superhumans emerge onto the scene. This is all fine and good but the problem is the art direction never changes and just doesn't fit the serious tone from here on. Superman's disproportionately oversized chest and arms are only dwarfed by his even more disproportionately oversized jaw, looking more like Heavy Metal's 'Captain Lincoln Stern in tights and a cape. I was expecting Stephen Colbert to step in for voice over this time around, which would have been great, btw.

The Elite: A group of young mutants with extraordinary abilities but act like a bunch of street rats, half of which are horribly underused, especially 'The Hat', a supposed master of the mystical arts but spends most of his time kicking back and drinking wine. He doesn't really have much use other than a seemingly inspired homage to Daisuke Jigen of the Lupin III series. Then there's Coldcast, a generic big, angry black guy till the last 5 minutes of the movie where, he gets angrier.

At the story's core, it's a Superman story. Truth, Justice and the American way. Superman is probably the only hero, super or otherwise, who's never really had to struggle with walking the line between defending justice and administering justice. He's 100% committed to his ideals, even when those ideals are tested, even sometimes in doubt.

Again, I didn't hate it but I simply didn't enjoy it as much as I would have liked.

That being said, I'm ready for a Mitzelplik storyline.",1340236800,,2012,4.837209302325581
5099369,4,B007MCUAD6,"I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. It had a good story, great flow, good voice acting, and fitting animation. This feels like a really strong episode of the Superman: Animated Series and should be viewed as such in terms of quality.

The story is about how far the ""good guys"" should go to stop the ""bad guys"". Is throwing a criminal in jail so he can escape or make bail and hurt someone else a good solution, or should criminals be put out of action permanently? This story explores that question using Superman to support the former and the Elite, a new super group whose leader was trained by British Intelligence, to represent the latter argument. The story is very solid and moves at a nice pace. There are several parts where characters stop and give speeches to discuss the issue, but the speeches are short and to the point so they don't sound preachy. The plot is tight with no lags in story. There are not twists or surprises--the movie ends how you would expect it to.

Several voices from Justice League were used and were welcome. The new voice for Lois Lane did not fit and seemed whiny compared to previous portrayals. Otherwise it was a solid cast.

Many reviewers have attacked the animation as being to simple and low quality. The animation is simpler and slightly more cartoony than previous DC Animated Movies, but for good reason. The point of this movie was the idea and the message. To effectively convey that message, it needed to be the focus. Simpler animation allowed the story to take center stage instead of competing with it. And the style animated very smoothly and  nicely even if it was fairly simple. I think it'll just take time to grow on some fans.

Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.
----------------------------------------

**Brief Review of Film**

Bought this from FYE last week.  My copy came with a full sized poster as well!!!  14.99 for the price, a fair amount in my opinion.  12.99 would have been better.  Anywho...

I had some concerns with this film even before I popped it into my aging DVD player.  Number one, for a long while the listed run time of this film was like 57 minutes.  NOT EVEN AN HOUR!!!  Well, DC seems to have fixed this and added in some more footage, bringing the elapsed time to 74 minutes, better but still not perfect.

I was also concerned about Superman having the chin of Jay Leno.  I know he's supposed to have a chiseled jaw, but come on.  Well, you get used to his unique appearance after about 10 minutes, so this is not a big deal either.

**Some Spoilers Ahead**

The film centers around Superman and his encounter with The Elite.  The Elite are a group of fledging superheros who want to fight the bad guys as well.  The only difference is they don't take prisoners, they down right KILL the bad guys.

This film really does delve into the philosphy of most superheroes.  Pummel the villians and send them to prison.  They break out, kill more people and cause even more damage, the good guys beat them up again and re-send them to prison, where they break out again...  The point being is that if you simply ended them, you would be sparing many people a lot of potential suffering.  This concept is one we face here in real life.  People to this day argue over the death penalty, is assassinating terrorists right, etc.  This animated movie is kind of like our current times meets a comic strip, and it's not funny in the least.

Should bad people just be killed, no trial, no jurys?  The Elite certainly think so.  Of course Superman is appauled by this and wants them to turn themselves in to be judged for their crimes.  Here's the funny part, we the people are fine with The Elite killing, in fact we applaud them for it.  Just as people stormed the White House fence and cheered for hours after Osama Bin Laden was executed, people cheer for The Elite after they bring down villians.

Eventually Superman and The Elite come to a show-down.  How can Superman (who doesn't kill) stand a chance against an entire team of ""superheroes"" who do it like it was breathing?

--Pros Of Movie--

Good thought provoking story/premise.  Some characters I've never seen before.  Film shows the pros/cons of both Superman's methods of justice AND the Elite's.

--Cons Of Movie--

Superman is not very powerful in this movie.  He gets his ass kicked pretty well and bleeds quite a bit.  He's missing his left eyelids at the end of the movie for crying out loud!!!  While violence and blood are not bad things in cinema, I am not used to seeing Superman this beat up.

Back stories of The Elite are not delved into enough.  In fact only Manchester Black gets his back story looked into, and briefly at that.  How did the rest of the team get their powers?

Film is too short.  Not enough time to hash things out.

Also animation was a bit crude for my taste, not worthy of being labeled film quality.

--In Conclusion--

Overall a great film, not perfect, but still really good.  I will definitely be watching this again soon.  A film that not only delivers punches, but makes you wonder as well, wonder about what really is the right way to handle evil.

Also, FYI there is a bonus feature.  A featurette that gives you a preview of DC's next release.  They are bringing 'Return of the Dark Knight' to film!!!  Peter Weller (Robot Cop) is voicing the aging Batman!!!  The movie is going to be released in 2 parts, meaning it will not be light on content!!!  Fall 2012 is the apx release for Part 1.  I can't wait, I am shoving money into my PC's disk drive right now, trying to reserve myself a copy.  Good things on the horizon for us the fanboys...

Only one last gripe with DC Comics.  I love 'Batman' & 'Superman' as much as the next guy or gal, but come on, you've got other characters.  You have other wells to tap into.  Is it too much to ask for a 'Deadman' animated movie?  How about 'Etrigan The Demon'?  The 'Spectre'?  Give us something fresh and new, PLEASE!!!

All right, I'm off my soap box now.  Now go check out 'Superman Vs The Elite'.",1340150400,,4600,4.531135531135531
5099371,5,B007MCUAD6,"With the recent DC animated films that have been coming out, many of them have received mixed reviews. I own Superman Doomsday and have watch Superman All Star, and I feel it is a struggle to produce a good Superman film animated or live. For Superman vs. The Elite, all I can say is I thought it was pretty amazing and well done. As I watched the movie further in, I realized that this Superman animated film was so good, that it could be adaptable to live film given the right director.

The themes of the movie simply scream real world. It touches on topics on what is considered right and just, and it reflects how some of the world feel about these topics. It had those scenes where you felt simply stunned by what just happened.

With other details, it's definitely a plus with returning voice actor George Newbern. The voice actor for Lois Lane, Pauley Perrette, was right on character rivaling the ones from the Superman Animated Series. There are some criticisms about the art style, but to be honest, I didn't care because the story line just outdid itself.

My review may not be thorough simply because I never read the comic. But I'll really emphasize this, this Superman storyline would make a great live movie.

Things I didn't like: The overall animation style/quality. I have seen DCU do much better.
The voice for Lois Lane, not the best I have heard.
The very lame opening title credits. UGH!! Some weird 70's, 80's style psychedelic crap.
Finally Superman's MASSIVE chin. WTF? This thing was huge and distracting.

Things I liked: The use of the ""super"" theme from Superman/Doomsday movie.
Superman's voice.
The action and story line.
Lost of awesome super-powered asskickery!!
This was a good translation from the comic (on which its based) to the screen.

5099376,2,B007MCUAD6,"I'm a DC fan of over 40 years (I remember the ""old"" DC multi-verse and never had a problem keeping it straight), and I'm again disappointed in another lazy DC animation.

I particularly hadn't read the comic issue, so I came into this with no preconceptions or expectations of the plot, so my comments are only concerned with the adaptation.

(you have been warned about plot spoilers)

Simply put, the concept of ""how far do you go? Is the superhero a 'global nanny', or 'judge/jury/executioner'?"" has been done and redone over the years, so it's an old concept put in a revised context (Heck, even ""Superman 4: Quest for Peace"" touched on it decades ago, as bad as it was).  Usually, it's an internal battle within the hero, not the hero as observer/interventionist with other heroes, as in this case.  This story fails because Superman never really questions himself, only the world's attitude. Superman doesn't execute.  No, but he will involuntary lobotomize, which doesn't close the question on him.

The debate could have been better addressed as a conflict with Black and his sister, who obviously had the same differences as Black and Superman (using Superman as the connecting device).  In the video, she's really only barely mentioned as background and with a quick cameo.  That same story should have played out between them years before.

Oh, and Black rants about the heroes in ""thongs""...  Where are they?  The world's going to hell, unbridled super-vigilantes run amok, and NO JUSTICE LEAGUE in this universe?  Handled in the comic as mentioned in the special feature interviews, but not a glimpse in this script (Black makes reference to other superheroes, with Superman as being ""the first"").  Big plot hole.

But that's ok, because it will keep me off a rant about DC's already screwing up the Justice League in animation (and causing audience confusion with their own big feature releases... good plan).

And Joe Kelly uses the old magic ""deus ex machina"".  Can't think of how to develop an adversary powerful enough to challenge Superman? No problem, we'll just give him MAGIC..  nice cop out, Joe...

I missed Andrea Romano's voice direction and casting.  Dawn Hershey really fumbled this one.  Most were a caricature and over-the-top, or just wrong (I have a huge crush on Pauley Perrette, so I let her slide ;P).

The animation is the same off-shore crap that I've come to expect from DC Entertainment.  It was mentioned when DC re-animated Superman that it was just ""too difficult"" to animate the yellow shield on Superman's cape, so they just dropped it.  That's not ""difficulty"", it's just laziness. And it continues here, going on to all the animation in general.  The animation direction/quality just plain sucks.

Even the opening titles blew chunks.  If I was the agent/manager of any of the voice talent, Id be raising holy hell about that mish-mash in the opening credits.  The retro comic flashes only served to make me miss Julie Schwartz (old-timers know who I'm talking about).

Truly ""a swing and a miss""... could have been much more with more work.

Given what I saw in the extra feature ""sneak peek"", I expect to be even more disappointed when DC releases ""The Dark Knight Returns:Part One"".

Just my 2 cents.  Take it for what it's worth, and keep the change...",1339891200,4,3302,4.883093525179856
5099377,5,B007MCUAD6,"This is the question asked by this new movie from DC Comics and Warner Premiere: ""Superman vs The Elite"". Based on the comics' story, ""What's So Funny About Truth, Justice & the American Way"" by writer Joe Kelly (2001), the relevance (or lack of) Superman is examined in the light of modern day America, times and thinking--not 1938's. Do Superman and his moral values still count for anything in today's day and age? How about in the comic book world? Especially in light of more modern, grittier characters such as Wolverine and The Punisher.

*Spoilers Ahead*

The movie starts out with the ""Superman status quo."" He's the hero, maybe can sometimes come off as a bit cheesy...especially with a new Superman public service cartoon (a not so subtle dig at the old ""Superfriends"" series) he's promoting...but nevertheless, he's still America's number one hero. And, kids and adults alike love him.

Things quickly change.

From across the pond, a quartet of new superheroes show up in Metropolis: These British ""Heroes"" call themselves The Elite. Led by Manchester Black (trenchcoat, union jack tee, ever-present cigarette in the corner of his mouth--yeah, he *does* look pretty damn cool) these MI-5 special agents make use of psychokinetic, as well as superhuman strength, in quickly going about Superman's business of ""protecting"" the world...in a darker, grittier way.

The Elite do not care about collateral damage--just getting the job done. Yes, this means killing the bad guys, too.

As you may expect, The Elite are an overnight sensation (with a great backstory I won't give away here). People quickly drop Superman and cheer for them. They're cool, hip, and get the job done ""right"" the first time...permanently. Why waste time ""capturing and recapturing the same bad guy over and over? We get the job done the first time?""

What's worse, Superman isn't a match for them. At first, The Man of Steel tries to play nice and get them to see his side of things (""having morals is *always* relevant), but when this route doesn't work, Superman's powers don't, either. Manchester Black, psycho-kinetically, is Superman's match...and he's got a team to back him up. Protect Metropolis? They're going to ""protect"" the world; even going as far--despite Superman's pleading with them to stop--as to get involved in wars overseas.

All of this sets the stage for a final showdown in Metropolis, with the whole world watching via satellite relays .

Before the battle begins, Superman has one request: Let's take it outside. ""I don't want spectators getting hurt."" The Elite agree and warp all of them into space--bringing the satellite relays with them so everyone on earth can still watch.

Superman is in over is head...he has virtually no offense at all in this four-on-one fight, and, with blood coming out of every visible orifice, he gets crushed into atoms.

Remember the old saying, ""You don't step on Superman's cape?""

The world is in shock and disbelief. But then, out of the blue (sorry) a whirlwind forms. You hear Superman's voice emanating from within it thanking the Elite for showing him the ""error of his ways."" He then proceeds to QUICKLY kill all of The Elite except for Manchester Black--who flees back to Metropolis and surrounds himself with a psychokinetic force field.

It doesn't do him any good.

On literally a world stage, Superman attacks with a vengeance.  Without giving thought to person or property, Superman rampages through Metropolis, quickly smashes through Manchester's force field...and to the horror of literally *everyone* on earth, he prepares to deliver the final blow.

He doesn't deliver it.

Turns out, to the relief of everybody, Superman didn't kill anyone (shame on you for thinking he had). With help from a few ""friends"", all of the spectators *and*  all of the members of The Elite are alive and well.

It also turns out that The Elite were never a match for Superman. He took a few ""beatings"" while analyzing their respective strengths and weaknesses...and came up with quite a clever plan for defeating them (watch the movie!).

Finally, is Superman relevant? This movies answers the question with a resounding YES! Superman will always be relevant: whether it's today, or way back in 1938 (a very gritty time in its own right), or even 2138. I encourage you to give this movie a try--it is the best animated feature to come from DC with only one exception: ""Batman: Under the Red Hood"".

Five Stars.

DVD NOTES

The voice cast is exceptional. George Newbern and ""NCIS's"" Pauley Perrette are spot-on with their portrayals of Superman and Lois Lane; I hope they will continue to voice the characters in future Superman releases. Robin Aktin Downes all but steals the show with his portrayal of Manchester Black. I hope we will see him again, reprising this character. Also look for ""Metal Gear Solid's"" Paul Eiding, and ""Uncharted's"" Nathan Drake himself, Nolan North.

5099378,4,B007MCUAD6,"Along with many other reviewers, I found the biggest flaw with this movie to be the animation. The entire time I was watching it I couldn't help but think Superman should make a trip to the dentist because of his ridiculously oversized (or swollen) jaw. The story seemed to cover too serious a topic for such a ""cartoony"" animation style. Watching the credits it's very obvious that the animation was done entirely in Asia, so I'm guessing it was a studio that typically handles Japanese anime.

Aside from the animation the story was very good. It puts Superman in a modern day setting and poses the question, ""Is capital punishment out of the question when it will save the lives of innocents in the future?"" How many times have the villains been captured, jailed, and escaped or been released only to cause more damage and kill more innocent people? It gives you a good look to see if Superman's non-lethal approach of subduing and again imprisoning the villain are indeed the right way to handle the situation in a modern-day world in the eyes of all the people he's there to protect.

If you can get past the animation I highly recommend watching it.",1339804800,17,1155,4.6568627450980395
5099379,4,B007MCUAD6,"I enjoyed it, but WB DC could have let someone else done the animation work.  The animation looked like it was done by the same animator of the Christmas Classics cartoons of frosty the Snow man, Twas the Night Before Christmas.",1339718400,2,228,4.560975609756097
5099380,4,B007MCUAD6,"In Superman vs. The Elite, the Man of Steel faces his most daunting foe yet: public opinion. In an era where the realities of terrorism and global strife have created a cynical and hardline attitudes about the concept of ""justice,"" Superman's idealistic optimism seems more and more outdated (both in the film, and in the real-world). So when a group of younger super-powered vigilantes known as The Elite appear on the scene, Superman is not prepared for their brutal stance against criminals - nor the resounding public approval that follows.

The greatest super hero in the world soon discovers that changing times and public opinion are not things that even his god-like powers can control. Even with the world turning away from him, Superman must find some way to win back the support of humanity, before The Elite do something truly reckless and get themselves - and/or others - killed in the process.

Superman vs. The Elite is an odd entry in the canon of DC Universe direct-to-DVD/Blu-ray animated features. On the one hand, the story (based on the Action Comics storyline ""What's So Funny About Truth Justice & the American Way?"") is actually one the most timely and interesting Superman tales to come along in awhile. (It certainly covers thematic ground that bears examination - as the upcoming feature-film reboot Man of Steel will attempt to do next year.)

The story works in this animated feature as well as it did on the comic book page - primarily because the writer of the comic story (Joe Kelly) also wrote this animated feature version. The plot-points - sketching the modern world and how Superman's idealism is outdated; edgy anti-heroes being more popular than classic super heroes - are all directly addressing questions that fanboys and average people alike have been asking - namely, why does Superman still matter?

With The Elite, we get an interesting antagonist - not really evil, per se, just grittier and darker than the classic superhero archetypes. There will no doubt be healthy debate amongst viewers as to whether The Elite are, or are not, the heroes we need in modern times, and whether or not Superman is the dinosaur some claim he is.

While the narrative is intriguing and well-told, the visuals in Superman vs. The Elite leave something to be desired. DC Animation has long been praised (usually in comparison to Marvel Animation) for its character designs and animation quality - but this film looks as though it had a fraction of the usual budget for a DCU animated feature. The character designs are much more cartoony, in a 1950s comic strip sort of way; the quality of movement is also fairly shoddy, which is entirely noticeable during the action scenes. Strangely enough, the film looks like ""Superman: The Nickelodeon Version,"" even though it's dealing with mature material and themes. Blu-ray viewing will only make these discrepancies more apparent.

The voicework in the film is pretty solid, with Superman being voiced by George Newbern - who has been doing animated Superman since the Justice League days in the early 2000s. NCIS star Pauley Perrette has a pretty good go at playing Lois Lane, while The Elite are suitably voiced by some talented character actors - including voice work veteran Robin Atkin Downes, who voices the group's leader, Manchester Black. (He was also the ship computer in Prometheus, the ""soccer announcer"" in Battleship, and has done voice work in more video games than I'm willing to count).

All in all, Superman vs. The Elite is a Superman flick that's actually interesting to watch for intellectual reasons, but won't blow you away in terms of visual splendor or action. In that sense it's an easy recommend to those who maybe haven't been able to connect with the character in a long time (Batman crowd, looking at you); though it may be less satisfying to the hardcore fans, who already know why they love Big Blue.",1339718400,48,3905,4.9165402124430955

For a newcomer this movie will be a super treat.  But to me it feels very much like another episode of the Justice League.  Different design and animation but similarities in story arcs and the way things get wrapped up in the end with a nice bow.  George Newbern has done some great work with Supes in the past but to continue to use him in these newer releases doesn't seem to further the concept of new material.  They also are recycling some of the music from Superman Doomsday which is slightly distracting.

Superman has to reevaluate if his moral code has finally been left behind by a modern era that would rather shoot first and never bother asking questions.

This is a hard movie to judge. This is the first DVD based on a single issue from the comics (Action Comics #775, ""What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, and the American Way,"" by Joe Kelly and Doug Mahnke). For better or for worse, lots of stuff had to be expanded upon to make it fit the 74 minute run time. But, they did get Joe Kelly to come back write this adaptation, and he inserted a few details from later comics with the Elite. A big difference is that the Elite act like they want Superman to be their Number 5 member and get some heroic moments, before turning against big blue. They did managed to conserve the big battle at the end, which is what everyone is hoping for.

Sadly, the biggest problem is the animation style. In the other DC DVDs they always try to replicate the original artist's style for the animation. While Mahnke does occasionally use exaggerated proportions, most people would say he's known for a gritty ugly style. Instead they chose a rubbery, super-deformed, cartoon style, that's distracting given the serious nature of the material.

One more thing, Action Comics #775 was written in March 2001, so it was written as a reaction to Antiheroes that were prevalent during the 1990s. But in this post-9/11 adaptation, you're definitely going to feel the post-9/11, modern slant.

I can't say much about the performance. All of the Elite are great. Manchester Black sounds almost exactly how I'd imagined. Everyone else is fine, I just can't take them seriously because of the distracting character designs.

It isn't long before The Elite are embraced by the public and Superman is looked at as being behind in the times, but naturally, things with The Elite aren't all what they seem, culminating in a violent showdown.  The script (adapted by comic writer Joe Kelly, who wrote the original comic story the film is based on) is smart and the film as a whole enjoyable, even if its animation is sub-par and the voice acting nothing too special compared to other animated DC Universe films.  Still, Superman VS The Elite is worth a look at the very least regardless.",1339459200,,1022,4.7897727272727275
5099390,4,B007MCUAD6,"Superman vs. The Elite is a wonderfully entertaining story but the character styling isn't the best. I own all the Warner Premiere titles and this title ranks low on the technical execution. The character's proportions change from shot to shot. This is most noticeable with Superman's chin. In some sequences his chin is rounded and in others it is squared in the way that the animation fans have been accustom too. I'm not saying I have an issue with a rounded chin on Superman but the fact that it changes from one shot to the next in some sequences is a little irritating. It seems like more attention was paid to the ""villains"" keyframes and in-betweens than our super hero. That being said it is still a good movie and a great story but being an animator myself, it is sometimes hard to overlook the technical mistake. Especially when you look at the previous Superman Batman title. There has also been a history of emulating the art style of the comic book art the story was taken from and this title's art doesn't come close. The colors of the characters remain true to the comic but the re-design of the characters falls a little short. The cover art is closer to the original art than the animation. I am glad I purchased this title but when I have a Superman jones it most likely won't be the first title I grab from my library of movies but it is worth the money for any Superman fan.",1339459200,,1395,4.453125
5099391,5,B007MCUAD6,"Superman is a character that can be tough to write without going into cliches or just making it a slugfest. I've always been more of a Batman fan, but the Bruce Timm series finally won me over on liking superman. However, when Superman is at his best, I can't get enough of him and I just want to rub it in the faces of people who think that Superman is lame just because he's not ""edgy"" enough. I didn't have high hopes for another DC Universe animated movie, but two things interested me once I knew about it. First, is that Joe Kelly is the writer and I've absolutely loved his work on Deadpool, which told me that this would very likely be well written. Second, is that this is based on a one-shot comic, which would do wonders for the length of these Direct to Video movies, which often feel too short at around 70 minutes. I saw this film on the internet and my hopes were answered because this movie was great! I had heard what Joe Kelly wanted to do with this story and the themes he wanted to explore and he totally delivered. This film almost feels addressed to people who don't appreciate what a good character Superman can be. The animation is not as slick as the past DC Direct to Video Movies such as Batman: Under the Red Hood (my favorite in this line) and Justice League:Doom, but the story makes up for it. I still would say that the animation was at least decent and I feel that they did put work into the animation. The voice acting is great with George Newbern delivering his best performance as Superman and Robin Atkin Downes was incredible as Manchester Black, the main antagonist of the movie. I thought that Pauley Perrette as Lois Lane was doing a very poor job at the beginning of the movie, but she improved a lot and at the end I'd say her performance was very good except at the beginning. Overall, Superman vs The Elite is definitely worth watching and a great study into Superman's morals, as well as the effect the Elite have on the world. I look forward to actually purchasing this film to own in my collection.",1339372800,4,2046,4.3727034120734904
5099392,3,B007MCUAD6,"I have watched most of the WB DC DTV movies and found this to be one of the better stories.  I know that the animation style was a an artistic choice (hopefully), but the animation looks horrible.  AND I MEAN HORRIBLE!!!  The animation looks like someone without training tried to do a movie in their basement.  Really difficult to get used to given the quality of previous releases (see the Green Lantern DTV or the JL: Doom).  Again, the story makes up for the poor animation.  HOWEVER, GIVEN THAT THEY ARE CHARGING AROUND $20 FOR THE BLU-RAY, IT SHOULD INCLUDE A TRUE DIGITAL COPY!!! (Read the capital letters as they are intended).  This release includes the Blu-ray copy, a DVD copy, and the relatively useless internet-streaming only copy.  Essentially WB is saying ""PLEASE JUST RENT ME"".  I guess the dvd/blu-ray sales do not make as much money as the pure rentals.  So I definitely think the movie is worth watching, but my suggestion is to make this a rental.  Maybe Warner Bros. will support digital copies in the future after Ultraviolet meets its deserved end.",1339372800,,1072,4.7405405405405405
5099393,3,B007MCUAD6,Best supeman DVD ever?  hardly.  However it does more than enough to be worth watching.  I could do without the style of animation but i have seen worse.  Where this suffers is that the story is overly cliched; even for an animated movie.  The people as well as the hero flirts with the darside only to come back at the end.  I haven't been a comic book reader in  a really long time but I am sure there are better superman stories to tell than this one.,1339372800,,454,4.149425287356322
5099394,4,B007MCUAD6,"The introduction of this movie (opening credits), shows animation of the old 1940/50 superman drawings.  It reminding me of all of the old vintage superman shows I watched as a child.  And, the good ol' statement ""truth, justice and the American way"", is even uttered in the movie, which seemed a little like propaganda, considering the fact that Superman's standards/view toward LIFE is not like any race or people on Earth-- not even Americans.  But, it did make me smile.

But, on to the review.

ANIMATION:  The drawing for Superman is consistent with the drawings found in the other DC films.  However, the surrounding characters are sub-par.  I do not get it.  All of the other characters have a weird, cheap look about them.  You have to see it to understand it.  It's almost like there were only two people drawing the entire film-- one drew the backgrounds and characters and the other drew Superman and Lois Lane.

STORY:  The story is very good.  It forces the viewer to analyze the definition of ""Justice"".  Namely, what is real justice?  Who has the right to exercise execute that justice?

WHY PG-13: There is one female villain in the movie that is VERY sexual in her speech.  I had a 17 year old niece watching the movie with me and I felt uncomfortable because of all of the sexual innuendos this character used. While she is drawn with curves, her appearance is standard and is not risque (she's no Wonder Woman). In fact, her appearance is kinda gross; she will remind you of Poison Ivy.  But, there is scene where there are two ""bad guys"" sitting down in chairs and their arms are tied behind their back and this female villain sits in their lap straddling them as she draws intel from them.

Three people are actually killed in the movie in the introduction (by being turned into ash and then dissolved similar to the action scenes in the Tom Cruise movie War of the Worlds).  And, the fight between Superman and the Elite is very intense.  In other DC movies, Superman's attire remains intact when he fights; not in this movie!  Superman is seen with ripped clothes, bloody scratches, tattered cape and blood shot eyes are just some of the violent things you will see in the movie.  I cannot say much without giving it away, but, Superman has NEVER been in a fight like this one.  Superman/Batman Most Wanted had Rated PG fighting in comparison to this movie.

The movie was really good.  I just wish the drawings were better.  The fact that I am mentioning it again is because it really bugged me and I am sure it will bug you too.",1339286400,3,2554,4.578366445916115
5099395,5,B007MCUAD6,"I must confess that I was a bit skeptic about this one. The trailers were too short and scarce, the animation seemed too low key for my taste and the announced 58min length didn't do it for me. But guess what: it's a keeper. Yes, the animation is not up to par with Doom or Superman vs Doomsday, not to mention the one with Green Lantern. But the action is, pun intended, superb! The voice acting was spot-on, except for Perry White who was too over the top, but they really nailed with Manchester Black and Menagerie. Also, I liked the characterization of Lois Lane: it is not your usual damsel in distress as always.

I'd give it only 4 stars, but just to counter-act a bozzo who give it 3 stars because of the 58 min length (which by the way is 72min), without even bothering to watch it.

Another thing: THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDREN!! Even for a 10-year old boy, you will have to sit with him and explain, or he will have nightmares for the rest of the week.",1339113600,6,958,4.229508196721311
5099396,4,B007MCUAD6,"A friend sent me an advanced copy of this b/c I'm not just a fan of Superman, I have always believed the things he stands for are important...and this film explores that.

The comics story it's based upon explored it too, but this take was definitely sharper and smarter.

I've not enjoyed virtually ANY of the previous WB/DC direct-to-DVD animated movies (Wonder Woman's ani movie being the only exception I can think of) -- their rampant misogyny and gratuitous violence aren't my cup of tea (I'm all for an actioner, but I like it with a side of intelligence). Virtually every past DC animated movie is the victim of poor writing and more plot holes than I can count (the recent Justice League: Doom movie being a perfect example). Also, in nearly every past film in which he's included, in order to make the story work, the writers/directors/producers make Superman a schm-ck whose powers are ignored (i.e., his super-hearing or super-speed) when they would interfere with the plot.

This story has no misogyny, the violence is a necessary part of the story (and it's actually less gruesome than, say, Superman/Doomsday while making a point) There are only a few minor plot holes at the start (see below), and Superman almost always is using his powers to the fullest (again, see below).

As others have said, the animation isn't the greatest, but if you're not a connoisseur, you likely won't notice; if you are, it's certainly clicky and uneven at times. This is par for the course for DC animated movies however. Character designs are also odd -- while Lois and some (but not all) other random female characters have a strong anime influence, none of the males have that kind of design (although action sequences are also anime-influenced).  Superman's design changes here and there ever so slightly -- but again, most won't notice these sorts of inconsistencies. And, overall, I like the design of him in this flick.

It's also good to see the return of strong voiceover work -- if you were able to sit through more than a few minutes of Batman: Year One, between its hokey acting and incredibly bad animation, you deserve a medal of some kind. I was thrilled with the strong actors this go-round. George Newbern, the Superman of TV's Justice League cartoon is Supes/Clark Kent, and is in perfect form. NCIS's Pauley Perrette plays Lois, and while she's definitely good, her voice in no way fits the Lois character's design. It's actually jarring in most scenes, but I can't deny Perrette's talent.

Also, if you're a fan of Chip Kidd's artwork, the fun titles sequence seems to be influenced by him and helps underscore the point of the story about the relevance of Superman and his ideals.

If you've read the comics story this is based upon, the ending -- don't worry, NO spoilers here -- is far more clever (if not a little Superfriendsy/juvenile) and a little more FUN here. And Superman *should* be FUN. The comics version is very dark, and while I liked the ending in the comics, this takes the same basic idea from the comics' climax and turns it around in a really exciting way.

Overall, highly recommended.

And, finally, as alluded to above, here're some random questions that came to me in the first 25 mins or so (very minor spoilers ahead):
- Why doesn't Clark hear trouble until it's right on top of him and Lois?
- Why does Clark just stand there as a second person gets killed in front of him before he decides to run into an alley to change?
- How is it even possible Superman didn't spot a guy crouching in the bleachers (and who, albeit sotto voce, goes ""Huh!"" at one point) at the U.N.? I'd think of all places he'd be on the look out for trouble, that'd be it.
- In a foreign country, Superman again stands around (er, in mid-air) while watching a monster kill people without taking action/reacting immediately.

Those things are the kinds of minor things which bug me that should NOT have gotten past professional writers, producers, directors, etc. However, to this movie's credit, there's just this small handful of issues. The last couple of DC movies I've seen (JL: Doom & another I can't even recall the name of w/Superman, Batman, and Supergirl) had endings which made no sense...and barely made sense throughout. So, again, this was a nice change of pace.",1339027200,3,4294,4.719626168224299
