3132096,5,B0014FAIX4,"Some Years ago -- I wrote a review of this Yet-To-Be Born DVD.  This series was -- unequivocally -- the Greatest Dramatic TV Series -- In fact -- One iof the Greatest Dramatic Stories -- of all times.  The running began when I was 13.  It was the first show I was allowed to stay up to watch. For a while -- the choice was -- imagine this -- The Fugitive -- or Star Trek!!! I chose TF without blinking an eye-- opting to rely on the simmer reruns (Series' were always repeated during the summer in those days). for my Trekky fixation.  I used to film the Fugitive from my Bolex 16mm.  In fact, I was so taken by the plight of this beleaguered & innocent man that I decided to emulate the man he really needed dig up the truth -- Perry Mason (another favorite -- though not on the same scale).  Now I often represent people accused of murder -- and -- too often for comfort -- people who didn't do it.  Death Penalty fans should be force-fed this series.  Richard Kimble ""looked"" guilty.  The evidence was strong indeed.  But the truth --as it turned out -- was both illusive and yet believable (What great writers!!!).  Janssen was  ""The Fugitive.""  Fortunately -- he evaded capture by the evil Gerard(well -- he kept a man in Hell -- for four years) He did so long enough for Gerard to come around (Nice Gerard) so far that -- in the end -- it is Gerard that saves Kimble's Life.  I am indeed thriiled that after the first season -- when things were looking glum -- Kimble didn't just change channels and ""Beam Up.""",1206835200,4,1516,4.292253521126761
3132097,5,B0014FAIX4,"I don't understand why this is being dribbled out 1/2 a season every few months?  How hard can it be to transfer the original film to DVD?  There are no extra features; the menu is very basic; what's taking so long?  Why can't they just release the entire four years at once, in a nice box, just like they do with every other TV series that comes out in DVD?",1205971200,8,358,4.085714285714285
3132098,5,B0014FAIX4,"At long last, the groundbreaking television series, ""The Fugitive"" comes to DVD. This show, which lasted from 1963-1967, was suspenseful, moving, engaging, and original. This was the first successful television show that took the dramatic formula of putting the hero with new characters and in new situations every week to another level. In previous shows such as Cheyenne, Maverick, and many others, the hero was a wanderer going from town to town to earn a living. In this show, the hero had no choice. He had to run to stay out of jail.

Charged with murdering his wife, a crime he did not commit, Dr. Richard Kimble, played by David Janssen, escapes from the law when the train taking him to his execution wrecks. Tracked doggedly by police inspector Gerard, Kimble wanders across the country running from the law while trying to track down the one-armed man he saw leaving his house the night his wife was murdered. As he wanders the country, he helps many people with their problems, all the while trying to find the one armed man and trying to avoid Gerard.

This classic show had all the goods - great acting by Janssen, Morse, and the many guest stars, fantastic narration by William Conrad, clever, well-written scripts, and taut direction. This show had it all, and made Dr. Richard Kimble one of the most famous and sympathetic characters television history. We can be glad that it has finally made it to DVD.",1205280000,13,1421,4.772357723577236

3132132,1,B0014FAIX4,"Back in 2008 when I read the reviews for the then new season 2-1 I decided to skip season two and instead wait for season 3 which I did. The replacement music for seasons 3 and 4 was noticable but bearable since not all episodes were equally hit. I then bought S2-2 for a very cheap price when it was on offer and it was bearable as well. Since I didn't like the hole the missing half season made on my DVD shelf after almost 5 years I decided to risk buying S2-1 as well thinking that CBS would have switched to the ""half-destroyed"" music in the meantime. That certainly was a big mistake, because what I got obviously is the same version all the one-star-reviews were about back in 2008. The music is so bad and that I couldn't bring myself to watch more then the first disc before giving up - the music was so distracting I just couldn't keep my head on the story - and I do love the series. So if you think about completing your collection - don't do it, you'll just end up with 4 unwatchable discs.",1373414400,5,1003,4.175257731958763

3132134,4,B0014FAIX4,"OK. So I give it only 4 stars because lots of folks are whining about the music. I have this season. Watched it. Enjoyed it. Alot.
1. I had no idea what the original music was supposed to be.
2. The music did not seem ""inappropriate"" or any sort of immediate ""bad fit"" to the episodes. Nothing ""wrong"" stood out at all.
So why would I care? Its not like I'm watching some action-packed chase scene and they're playing Sesame Street music. If you didn't vividly remember the original, I doubt new viewers would know. Still, I admit there is something to be said for keeping things the way they were originally. Genuineness is good.

This is a good batch of episodes. The nice things about The Fugitive are:
1. It was believable.
2. It wasn't all ""Blood-n-guts & explosions"" like so many shows these days.
3. Very good and creative situations that Kimble (played by David Janssen) finds himself in.
The show isn't dull at all and holds my interest watching it.
So Treat Yourself! Buy a half-season (or more) of this show. Its Good TV.  Kimble is on-the-run. Will someone recognize him? But he's really innocent. Will anyone believe him? Will he ever find the one-armed man who killed his wife? And Lt. Gerard is pursuing him relentlessly. Good suspense. Enjoy!",1364342400,2,1258,4.63677130044843

If anything, they underestimated the absurdity of this preposterous soundtrack, which has some of the most idiotically and incompetently composed music I've heard on a TV show. Literally 9/10 middle schoolers with a synthesizer could have composed something that sounded better. Not only is the soundtrack bad, it's very loud and very obtrusive, utterly ruining many scenes.

It's difficult for me even to conceive of the levels and layers of incompetence involved in this soundtrack. Someone with little understanding about the law had to decide to redo the entire soundtrack. Someone else had to decide to hire a composer who is just this side of tone deaf. Someone else had to decide to score it as loud as possible and as often as possible. It's like Idiocracy come to life.",1342051200,8,878,4.9324324324324325
3132140,1,B0014FAIX4,"[Addendum at bottom]
I am a very new fan of The Fugitive, and, after seeing one episode on television a couple weeks ago,I grabbed a DVD copy of Season One, Volume One that I saw on a store shelf. Since I watched the first episode, I've been completely hooked (I am not exaggerating; I suspect I will soon need to enter a rehabilitation facility for my addiction). I quickly decided that I must add the entire series to my shelves, which, being on a college budget, is something I never do at once (especially on a split-season basis). However, though I was not alive during the time of the original airing of this show, I was raised on classic television and watch little else. I decided to make an exception and dip into my meager savings for The Fugitive.

I'm sure whoever reads this will, by this time, know of the near-complete music replacement of all volumes of Seasons Two and Three of this show with what other reviwers have endeared as ""Crap Synthesizer Music"". Because of this, I need not go into detail about the incredible disservice this does to not only to the timeless masterpiece that is The Fugitive, but to the show's loyal fans, both old and new. However, in this review I would like to emphasize that this deplorable error is causing CBS/Paramount to lose a ton of business.

I was fortunate enough to read the other reviews in their entirety before clicking the ""add to cart"" button, and was spared the anguish of recieving a needlessly desecrated version of my now favorite TV show. That being said, I refuse to purchase this set, and the other sets with the replaced music. Originally, I was going to buy it anyway, having heard of a Replacement Disc program that CBS offered. My plan was to buy the set and mail in my request for replacement discs right away. But, BUYER BEWARE: CBS no longer offers this program. On top of that, after spending the money to make the replacement discs (and re-producing the entire set was no cheap endeavor, I'm sure), CBS IS STILL MANUFACTURING THE DISCS WITH THE REPLACED MUSIC, instead of producing the replacement discs in newly manufactured sets!!!! It seems that CBS does not understand that appreciation for this show is not limited to the original viewers. Classic TV shows have an ever-growing, dynamic fan base, so not only is CBS screwing over the original viewers, but their children's generation, and their children's and children's children's generations, and, if DVDs are still in existence then, CBS will still be facing livid consumers for this grave business miscalculation. And yes, CBS, your lack of profits will show this.

CBS was about to make a huge bunch of money off of this show. Not only are new viewers such as myself flocking to the show, these same new viewers are demanding that all their friends of younger generations watch it with them, and now they're hooked. These friends have friends, and, let's face it, with the greater onslaught of reality TV being forced down people's throats, shows like The Fugitive have little competition. Over the past couple of weeks, I have introduced exactly 23 friends to the show, who are also hooked but refusing to buy these sets. I am proud to say they are also showing their friends and spouses, and reminding their parents of how wonderful the original show was. So just on one outraged customer, CBS, you have lost a ton of money. Now imagine that this same phenomenon is occuring with most, if not all, other livid fans.

I wish CBS/Paramount good luck with their future business, because not only will I not buy these sets, but I will be incredibly careful of any CBS/Paramount products in the future. Multiply that by all my friends and their friends, and it equals a chain reaction of CBS's lost business.

[Addendum]
I have found that CBS was going to put out a complete series set on 33 discs, including a CD of the original music. CBS stated that most of the original cues were in place ([...] ). However, though it was released on November 1, 2011, it was recalled for technical disc issues ([...]). If this edition comes out, with indeed the music intact, then I would very gladly stop bashing CBS.",1341360000,5,4142,4.676268861454047
3132151,5,B0014FAIX4,"I have read previous reviews concerning Season 2 of The Fugitive & complaining about the music.

We are just greatly enthused that these shows have been made available on dvd so that we can see them once again! We are thouroughly enjoying them! Moreover, we are extremely happy with the deal we got from Amazon-$19 as opposed to the $33  other outlets were asking for. Judging from this experience, we will gladly do business with Amazon in the future! Thank You Amazon for making The Fugitive affordable for us!",1334966400,,687,4.540322580645161
3132152,1,B0014FAIX4,"Another 'WKRP In Cincinnati-style' hack job from CBS featuring a dismal, vomit inducing overdubbed synthesizer soundtrack in place of the original score. If you enjoy classic 1960's television set to a 1980's style soundtrack then this will be right up your alley. Personally, it's not my cup of tea. Glad I checked this out of the library rather than bought it.

Note to CBS: If you're not willing to do the job right from the outset it's best not to even bother trying. Really. Just leave it unreleased because honestly stitched-up affairs like this are not worth the material they're printed on.",1328659200,4,598,4.862745098039215
3132153,2,B0014FAIX4,"I recently(and sadly)acquired a 'complete' Fugitive box set after having previously bought a legit copy of the entire first 'season'[or series as we would say in the UK!].Myself(58)and my mum(83)were great fans in the black and white run on UK tv,and loved 'Season 1'.The Complete Box Set turned out to be 'Made in China' pirated shows off US tv. S'pose could use discs as mirrors to stop unfamiliar budgies attacking each other!--picture quality etc being AWFUL.The original empathic Rugolo? music's on there though for these episodes that constitute Season 2 on this genuine article set. The seller was quick/wonderful. I thought 'Doesn't take much to satisfy me....why are these[perhaps]overly-picky guys complaining about the new(added)apocalyptically-loud 'non-Peter Rugolo'musical score?.I know now!...CBS have bloody-well ruined these episodes!.One turns up the volume to catch soft nuances of speech,and...the 'potentially tv speaker-ruining' muzak comes in like the Battle of the Bulge!.I had ten years at and six years down my local coal mine,so I'm no stranger to loud sounds in a confined space. For this cultural vandalism,though,some one at CBS wants hanging out to dry!.",1305590400,6,1185,5.588888888888889
3132154,4,B0014FAIX4,"I bought this disc of ""The Fugitive"" hoping that they would have replaced the discs with the replacement discs.  This was not the case and from what I have been able to find out, you can no longer get the replacement discs.  However, given that this volume of the discs were on sale, I do not feel too ripped off.

That being said, what of the music that many have been critical of?  Unfortunately, I found that at times, the music did not quite fit what I was watching.  There were instances where it was OK and I did not notice it, but on other occasions it lacked subtlety.  I must admit I have not seen the original version of these episodes to see how it compares, though I do not remember the music in season one sticking out like a sore thumb at times.

The real winner on these discs are the stories themselves.  The moral dilemma for Kimble in 'Man on a String' of does he let an innocent go to prison or does he allow himself to be revealed to all is a fascinating question for our hero and ourselves.  The tragic consequences of mental health in 'When the Bow Breaks' is nothing more than a true tragedy.  Through the eyes of a boy (Gerard's son played by a young Kurt Russell) asks an interesting question of can two men be right is a wonderful look at two opposing characters in 'Nemesis'. 'Dark Corner' is truly dark with a protagonist who I am not sure is not just evil of character. How will Richard Kimble escape from Gerard is a key hook for 'Escape into Black' (where Kimble has lost his memory), 'The Cage', 'Detour on a Road Going Nowhere' and 'The Iron Maiden'. The further enticement of 'Escape into Black' is the fact that Kimble who has no idea is within spitting distance of the elusive one armed man!

Sadly, there are no special features on the series in this (and I do not think there are any) on any of the discs.

It is the quality of the stories which makes this disc worth the purchase.  The story of a man who struggles with his battle between caring for others and doing what he believes to be right, and the risk to his own freedom and the pursuit of the one armed man who will clear him once and for all.  It is that which means this release does deserve four stars!",1299110400,,2203,4.251798561151079

the way he had to be constantly on the run yet be on the look-out for Kimble or
Lt. Gerard.

3132156,2,B0014FAIX4,"What a shame having to watch poorly recorded foreign dvd copies of Fugitive Season 2(3, & 4 as well), rather than be able to completely enjoy those seasons' CBS/Paramount's remastered dvds instead. Primarily because of that abominable remixed synthesizer background music;  which totally ruins those fond memories us auld skoolers have for this classique A.B.C. series. Video quality on S2 Volumes 1 & 2 are just as crisp as A.B.C.'s broadcasts of nearly 5 decades ago; possibly better. But those damn synthesizers are just plain jarring(kinda like Ozzy fans wondering why he replaced the original rhythm section on recently remixed/remastered ""Blizzard of Ozz"" cds). To the uninitiated, it's a credit to the Fugitive's cast-n-crew-n-writers that newbies enjoy that taut suspense these great episodes delivered. Even after knowing Dr. Richard Kimble will eventually be vindicated. CBS/Paramount could have easily afforded Pete Rugolo's background music copyrights via nearly three decades worth of profits from moi's Star Trek purchases alone! To charge premium prices for an inferior product is an insult, pure & simple! Bought the combined Seasons 1 & 2 package last year, wishing against hope that the Season 2 dvds were the updated remasters. Contacting CBS/Paramount for replacements has been futile. Therefore, haven't had any reason to buy Season 3's piecemeal offerings. Maybe Quinn Martin should have let Desilu produce the Fugitive instead, because there didn't seem to be any hassles acquiring music copyrights for I Spy's three seasons. Am sure Gulf Western/Paramount received quite a few complaints about ""Good Night Sweetheart"" not being on ""City on the Edge of Forever""s vhs release, because it sure as hell wound up on the dvd!  Hopefully, Paramount will issue a mea culpa, & offer the entire series with Rugolo's music restored! Or is it true, as Lt. Gerard once noted, that holding on to false hope really is the cruelist form of punishment???",1286236800,6,1961,5.32258064516129

3132158,1,B0014FAIX4,"The Season 2 Fugitive DVDs are a complete disappointment due to the replacement music. For a short time, CBS was offering to exchange Volume One for an edition with more, but not all, of the original music.  I had bought Volume One as soon as it was released, and I was not aware of the exchange policy until after the Sep 2009 deadline.  Instead, I bought a second Volume One from Amazon under the assumption that it had the original music. WRONG!  They're still selling the edition with the replacement music.  Volume Two proved to be almost as bad as far as the replacement music is concerned.

Since then, I've dug out my old A&E Network Fugitive VCR recordings from the early '90s. They're a much more enjoyable way to see the series without having to be periodically jarred by out-of-place music.  Obviously, I've given up buying anymore of this CBS reissue.

3132159,1,B0014FAIX4,"Here is my two-cents worth:

I purchased this dvd set on June 12, 2010 from Amazon, long after it was a known fact that CBS/Paramount intentionally changed all the original musical score with that awful synthesizer music and long after they attempted to make it right with outraged fans by issuing replacement discs with most of the original musical score in-tact.

I give ""Fugitive - Season 2, Volume 1"" one star, not for the series but because the dvd set that I received from Amazon still contains the synthesizer music.  Apparently the replacement program was a limited time offer.  I wish now that I had bought the series before the replacement offer expired so that I could have taken advantage of that offer.  The cost of the dvds were still very expensive and I was waiting for the price to come down before buying.

I need not talk about the synthesizer music because there are plenty of other reviews out there which have covered that subject.  This is the first time that I have viewed The Fugitive so I decided to take my chances, where I have never had a chance to hear the original music from season 2.  Later, I decided to aquire a couple of VHS copies of the original season 2 Fugitive.  Having now compared the original music to the cheesy synthesizer version, I can understand why many diehard fans of the series were so outraged.

CBS/Paramount should have done more than just offered replacement discs for a limited time. They should have issued a total recall to all retail and online stores to pull that garbage off the shelves and replace it with discs containing the original music.",1276732800,11,1606,4.663120567375887

I just got my copy the third week of Sept. so I can not get it replaced, whats even worse is I e-mailed the address on the form they had to see if they would still replace my copy and they did not even accept the e-mail I guess they closed down the site.

Kimble's adventures take him all around the United States, where - because of his medical background - he invariably winds up helping people, who in turn wind up helping him.  There are plenty of split-second escapes - ""Nemesis"" comes to mind - and plenty of action.

3132178,4,B0014FAIX4,"The original release of this set was worth only one star. Stripping out the entire underscore for replacement music by Mark Heyes was a disaster. Heyes tried to match the period, and some of his cues were pretty decent, but the use of synthesizers was obvious at some points and the overall result was nowhere near as good as the orignal.

The replacement disc program changed everything. Note that what you buy on Amazon is likely the original release with the music changed. You have to download a form from CBS/Paramount, fill it out and tape the proof of purchase to the form. Send it off by September 2009, and CBS/Paramount will send the replacements by return mail at no charge. You're only out the cost of a stamp, and you don't even have to send back the original release. You end up with two sets of disks.

I've received the replacements, and almost all the original music has been reinstated. A few CBS cues and the Capitol cues (the fogginess of the rights issues on the Capitol cues is what caused the wholesale music replacement and began this saga) are all that's missing. The remaining Heyes music is hard to pick out unless you have a doctorate in The Fugitive's music. Those folks may well not like the replacement disks, though many of those experts who have posted on other forums have been quite pleased.

I am very happy with the replacements. The remaining Heyes blends well into the original cues. In short, it feels like The Fugitive again.

What keeps this from being a 5-star release is the treatment of ""Ballad for a Ghost,"" which has been significantly edited. A song written specifically for it has been removed. If you have that episode on VHS, transfer it to DVD and keep it with this set. Then you'll have a 5-star volume.",1236556800,6,1756,4.600638977635783
3132179,5,B0014FAIX4,"UP-FRONT NOTES ABOUT THE MUSIC:

After eight months of supreme displeasure and backlash from fans of ""The Fugitive"" due to the fact that every single bit of background music for these fifteen episodes on DVD was replaced with new (and less-appealing) musical arrangements, CBS/Paramount pulled a real surprise out of their hat on February 17, 2009, when that DVD studio officially announced that it was introducing a Replacement Disc Program for ""The Fugitive: Season 2, Volume 1"".

And I'm one of those ""Fugitive"" fans who was certainly thrilled to hear that particular announcement, because it means that Peter Rugolo's exquisite music for this series has been inserted back into each of these 15 episodes on the replacement DVDs. And most of the CBS Library music that accompanied each of these shows when they first aired in 1964 has also been put back onto the soundtrack for these four DVDs as well.

Thank you, CBS/Paramount, for listening to the many outraged fans of this outstanding TV series, and for re-doing these DVDs with Mr. Rugolo's music intact. Some of the newly-created music score (composed mostly by Mark Heyes) can still be heard in several of these episodes. But for the most part, the original 1960s background music is back where it belongs.

""The Fugitive"" is a series that relies quite heavily on its musical arrangements (composed mainly by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Rugolo/dp/B0000560K3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Rugolo</a>). A lot of the mood, soul, drama, and atmosphere of this television series rest within its music.

And when Paramount ripped the musical guts out of the first fifteen episodes of Season 2 by releasing this DVD set in June 2008 with completely-different background music, it was a very bitter pill to swallow for fans of the series (and fans of Mr. Rugolo). The episodes just aren't the same without that famous Rugolo (and CBS Music Library) underscore. And, thankfully, Paramount Home Entertainment has apparently realized that fact as well.

Overall, I'd have to say that I'm very pleased with the final ""music"" results on these replacement discs, and even Mr. Heyes' arrangements seem to blend in fairly well with the original Rugolo and CBS cues in the locations where Heyes' material is retained. I haven't heard any of the annoying and loud ""blasts"" of Heyes' music that appear many times on the 2008 re-scored discs.

I think ""Man On A String"" is probably the episode that has the most Heyes music retained for these replacement discs, especially in Act IV, which is ""Heyes heavy"" to be sure.

==========================

REVIEW OF SEASON 2, VOLUME 1:

David Janssen is back as Dr. Richard Kimble in ""THE FUGITIVE: SEASON TWO, VOLUME ONE"", the greatest dramatic series ever put on television (in my opinion anyway).

Like the two first-season sets, CBS/Paramount serves up 15 ""Fugitive"" programs in this 4-Disc DVD collection. The episodes appear to be complete and uncut, running about 51-and-a-half minutes each, just as they did when they were first aired on ABC-TV in late 1964.

Just as a sample, here are the exact run times for the four episodes that appear on Disc #1:

""Man In A Chariot"" = 51:35
""World's End"" = 51:35
""Man On A String"" = 51:25
""When The Bough Breaks"" = 51:38

The 51+-minute average run time includes the ""preview"" segments that appear prior to the opening credits for every show. These previews (or trailers) were a new feature implemented for the second season of the series.

However, I'd advise first-time viewers of these classic '60s shows to skip the previews and go directly to ""Act I"" of each episode, in order to avoid any ""spoilers"" (or even mini-spoilers) revealed within the preview clips.

Even after having seen each of these episodes numerous times, I still tend to want to skip past the preview/trailer snippets, to avoid having some of the scenes diluted or spoiled when watching the complete program.

Clicking ""chapter advance"" or ""skip"" on the remote control after the episode begins playing will bypass the preview section and the opening credits too. You can go straight to ""Act I"" with one click.

There are a total of 7 individual DVD chapters per show, logically placed at the end of each of the four ""Acts"" and at the end of the ""Epilog"" scene for every episode.

The video and audio quality for these fifteen black-and-white shows is very good indeed, with only one (partial) exception to this rule--and that's during a small portion of ""Cry Uncle"", where parts of Act II of that episode suffer from some apparent damage to the original film print, resulting in white lines and dots showing up on the screen.

The outdoor scenes (which are abundant in number throughout the four-year history of ""The Fugitive"") look particularly clear and pristine throughout these DVDs, with only a small amount of grain visible in the indoor scenes as well.

All things considered, I couldn't be more pleased with the way this series looks and sounds on these Paramount DVDs (as of March 2009, that is, thanks to the replacement discs). Like with the Season-One sets, this first volume of Season Two contains a notation on the back of the case which indicates that these episodes have been ""TRANSFERRED FROM THE ORIGINAL NEGATIVE WITH RESTORED AUDIO"".

Every single episode in the 120-show lifespan of ""The Fugitive"" (1963-1967) is definitely a worthwhile experience (IMO). Of course, different people are bound to have their personal favorites vs. some episodes that didn't quite make the top grade.

Among the fifteen shows that comprise this four-disc DVD set, my favorites are: ""World's End"", ""Nemesis"", ""Man In A Chariot"", ""Escape Into Black"", ""Tug Of War"", and ""Tiger Left, Tiger Right"".

==========================

DVD INFO:

Packaging -- Nice and compact. For the ""replacement"" DVD set which was made available to customers in February 2009, a standard-sized (0.5-inch wide) Keep Case is used, with two swinging ""pages"" in the middle of the case that hold all four discs. And no ""overlapping"" discs either, which is a plus, because the discs don't have to touch each other.

The first version of this set that was released in June 2008 (the set with the butchered music soundtrack) comes in a slightly-different type of case, with only two discs attached to a single ""page/leaf"" in the middle, with Discs 1 and 4 being housed on hubs that are attached to the front and back panels of the case, thus covering up the episode descriptions that are printed underneath those two discs.

So, this packaging switch is another reason to say ""Thank You"" to CBS/Paramount for a change they made to this DVD set -- because the new (and better) case design allows for the episode titles and synopses to be easily seen without having to remove Discs 1 and 4 from their hubs.

In my opinion, DVD companies should always provide a list of episodes on the back of each case (just like CBS/Paramount has done in the past with  some of its TV-on-DVD releases, such as the last six seasons of ""The Andy Griffith Show""). That type of at-a-glance episode list on the back of a DVD case, which is not provided for ""The Fugitive"" sets, is very useful and helpful.

Video -- 1.33:1 Full-Frame. Black-and-white.

Audio-- Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono.

Subtitles -- None. English Closed-Captioning is available, however.

Bonus Stuff -- None. (Except for some DVD Promos on Disc 1.)

Discs -- Single-sided, Dual-layered.

Chapters -- 7 per episode.

Menus -- Static; No music; No Episode Sub-Menus. A ""Play All"" button is included on all four discs.

==========================

THE EPISODES:

Here's a look at the fifteen ""Fugitive"" episodes that are included in this 4-Disc collection (episode numbers 31 through 45 in the series), plus original air dates, Richard Kimble's aliases, and a few descriptive passages for some of my favorite shows:

31. ""Man In A Chariot"" (First Aired: September 15, 1964) .... Alias: ""Frank Borden"". .... Season 2 begins in fine fashion with ""Man In A Chariot"", which stars Ed Begley Sr. as ""G. Stanley Lazer"", a bitter and partially-disabled college professor/lawyer.

This episode doesn't feature the always-welcome presence of the late Barry Morse as Lt. Philip Gerard, but it's a winner nonetheless, thanks to an intriguing script and the fine acting performance turned in by 63-year-old Begley (and Janssen too, as always).

32. ""World's End"" (September 22, 1964) .... Alias: ""Mr. May"". .... The great Suzanne Pleshette, who passed away at the age of 70 in January 2008, makes her first of two very impressive guest-starring appearances in ""The Fugitive"". Suzanne perfectly portrays ""Ellie Burnett"", a former love interest of Richard Kimble's from their hometown of Stafford, Indiana.

Ellie, who has a lead on the possible whereabouts of the mysterious and slippery one-armed man, is able to contact Kimble via a personal newspaper ad, which brings about a reunion between the two in Kansas City, Missouri.

But there's a slight hitch -- Lt. Gerard knows Ellie and her family and is once again hot on Kimble's trail, with the help of the Kansas City police, including guest star Dabney Coleman.

""World's End"" ranks as one of my very favorite episodes. Everything about it is just about perfect, including more ""Gerard Chasing Kimble"" action, a good script with a few twists and turns to keep us guessing, and (best of all) the beautiful Suzanne Pleshette in a good role with lots of screen time.

While looking through Ed Robertson's excellent 1993 book, ""The Fugitive Recaptured"", I found the following excerpt which relates to this ""World's End"" episode. It's a 1993 quote from Suzanne Pleshette:

  ""It was wonderful to see 'World's End' again, because I hadn't seen that show since I did it back in '64. .... David [Janssen] was a natural--ahead of his time in many ways. His talent was so great that he made it look seamless, and effortless. He was a skilled professional who never really received the kind of appreciation as an actor that he truly deserved.""

As far as the background music in ""World's End"", it sounds to me as though the entire original 1964 score is here, which I was happy to hear, particularly for the scene at the beginning of Act IV when Lt. Gerard is trying to pry Ellie's and Kimble's whereabouts out of Ellie's mother. That scene's music exudes a lot of deep feeling and emotion, and having it placed back into this episode where it's supposed to be is a major benefit to this first-rate ""Fugitive"" installment.

33. ""Man On A String"" (September 29, 1964) .... Alias: ""Joe Walker"".

34. ""When The Bough Breaks"" (October 6, 1964) .... Alias: ""Pete Broderick"".

35. ""Nemesis"" (October 13, 1964) .... No alias used. .... This is one of my very favorite episodes and probably the one I've watched more than any other (thanks to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-VHS-tape/dp/6304865457/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this VHS tape</a>, which teams up ""Nemesis"" with another all-time Season-Two favorite, ""World's End"", on the same videocassette). The VHS version is pretty good too, but the quality on these Paramount DVDs is, as to be expected, much better.

""Nemesis"" is a unique episode, in that it places Lt. Gerard's son (""Phil Jr."", played very nicely by 13-year-old Kurt Russell) in a situation where he unwittingly becomes the travelling companion of the fleeing Dr. Kimble.

But this unlikely teaming of Phil Jr. and Kimble manifests itself in a very natural and believable way through the show's excellent script (written by Harry Kronman).

When Lt. Gerard discovers that his young son is in the company of the convicted murderer that the Lieutenant has been chasing for these many months, it puts him in a rather precarious and awkward position. He wants desperately to recapture Dr. Kimble, but he's also concerned, quite naturally, for the safety of his son at the same time.

""Nemesis"" offers up several memorable moments, such as Kimble's initial reaction when he finds out who his back-seat stowaway really is (David Janssen's facial expression is spot-on perfect).

The scene where Kimble slugs a police officer is a good one too (with the good doctor using not only his fists as a weapon, but also a radio that happens to be handy). And after disabling the policeman, even though he's just belted an armed officer of the law, we get a taste of the kind of non-violent man Dr. Richard Kimble truly is--deep down inside--when he decides to NOT take the officer's rifle with him as he escapes.

That's a pattern established by the writers of ""The Fugitive"" throughout the whole four-year term of the series, i.e., even when given the perfect opportunity to arm himself with a weapon (be it a handgun or a rifle or whatever), Kimble always opts to abandon the weapon.

Those very types of small, easily-overlooked moments have always struck me as instances of subtle nuance injected into the scripts by the show's many very capable writers, permitting a little more of Dr. Kimble's true, inner character to be revealed, without the doctor ever having to utter a word.

I also want to take a moment to say some (very) good things about the DVD picture quality of ""Nemesis"". Now I must say that all of these episodes look excellent on these DVDs, but I happened to notice an extra level of excellence emanating from ""Nemesis"", and I noticed it especially in the nighttime scene of Kimble and Phil Jr. in the woods (the scene where Phil Jr. builds a fire, much to the dismay of Dr. Kimble).

It helps if you watch that nighttime scene in a darkened room, in order to fully appreciate the deep level of black and the blemish-free overall quality exhibited in that scene. Perhaps I'm nuts, but that scene just looks exceptionally sensational to my eyes.

""Nemesis"" Music Note -- I'm happy to report that this episode (one of my all-time favories in the history of the series; did I say that already?) seems to have every bit of its original '64 musical score back in place. And it's a darn good score too, particularly the pulse-pounding scene at the fish hatchery when Kimble escapes in the sheriff's station wagon. And all of the great Rugolo music that makes that scene so extra good and tense is exactly where it should be on Disc #2 of this DVD set.

36. ""Tiger Left, Tiger Right"" (October 20, 1964) .... Alias: ""Frank Jordan"". .... Leslie Nielsen puts in a strong guest-starring performance here, as a disgruntled disabled man who kidnaps Kimble by mistake.

37. ""Tug Of War"" (October 27, 1964) .... Alias: ""Paul Kelly"". .... Arthur O'Connell is excellent as one of the main guest stars in this episode. Kimble is captured by O'Connell, an ex-sheriff. But does Dr. Kimble remain a prisoner for very long? (I'll bet you know the answer to this one already.)

But there are a few good twists and turns along the way. ""Tug Of War"", like the vast majority of ""Fugitive"" episodes, is a good, solid entry in the series.

38. ""Dark Corner"" (November 10, 1964) .... Alias: ""Jim Russell"". .... 21-year-old Tuesday Weld plays ""Mattie Braydon"", a scheming, manipulative blind girl who takes a liking to Richard Kimble. Does Kimble return Mattie's affection? Watch ""Dark Corner"" and see.

39. ""Escape Into Black"" (November 17, 1964) .... Aliases: ""Frank Barlow"" and ""David Merrill"". .... An accident lands Dr. Kimble in an Illinois hospital suffering from amnesia.

The ""Kimble Can't Remember Anything"" premise is a good one on which writer Larry Cohen and director Jerry Hopper build the foundation for ""Escape Into Black"". And since Kimble can't recall who he is during this episode, he also cannot remember whether or not he really killed his wife.

There's a classic scene in this episode which has a confused and groggy Dr. Kimble actually calling Lt. Gerard to say he is going to turn himself in. ""I understand you've been looking for me,"" Kimble tells Gerard on the telephone.

Kimble then arranges for Gerard to meet him at the train station in Stafford. But Gerard decides he'll intercept his elusive prisoner a little earlier, which brings about another ""oh so close to getting caught"" moment for Dr. Kimble.

40. ""The Cage"" (November 24, 1964) .... Alias: ""Jeff Parker"".

41. ""Cry Uncle"" (December 1, 1964) .... Alias: ""Pat Thomas"". .... 10-year-old Ronny Howard, who must have been given a break during the filming of Season 5 of his regular TV series (""The Andy Griffith Show""), appears as ""Gus"" in ""Cry Uncle"".

Other familiar faces in this episode include Edward Binns, Brett Somers, and Donald Losby. You might remember Losby as Vera Miles' and Brian Keith's son in the 1963 pilot episode of ""The Fugitive"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fear-In-A-Desert-City/dp/B00065X2OU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Fear In A Desert City""</a>).

42. ""Detour On A Road Going Nowhere"" (December 8, 1964) .... Alias: ""Stu Manning"".

43. ""The Iron Maiden"" (December 15, 1964) .... Alias: ""Mr. Parker"". .... There's a solid guest-starring performance in this episode turned in by Nan Martin, who also was excellent in her guest role as the boozing wife of Pat Hingle in the Season-One ""Fugitive"" episode&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Search-In-A-Windy-City/dp/6302767946/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Search In A Windy City""</a>.

44. ""Devil's Carnival"" (December 22, 1964) .... No alias used. .... Warren Oates makes a return ""Fuge"" appearance here (he also had a part in the Season-One episode ""Rat In A Corner"").

""Devil's Carnival"" is a bit of a misfire when compared to other episodes in the series. The storyline is a little on the strange side (IMO), but David Janssen and Warren Oates are always worth watching on screen (regardless of how strange the script might be).

45. ""Ballad For A Ghost"" (December 29, 1964) .... Alias: ""Pete Glenn"". .... Richard Kimble encounters a woman (played by Janis Paige) who strongly resembles his late wife, Helen.

Paige does a nice job in her part as Helen's look-alike, although she doesn't really look like Helen Kimble (who was played in other episodes of the series by Diane Brewster). But, I guess we'll have to overlook that difficulty.

Unfortunately, Janis Paige's musical number has been replaced by Paramount for this DVD release (even in the 2009 ""replacement"" set). Apparently the studio could not secure all of the rights to some of the music in this episode.

A little ""Ballad"" trivia -- This 45th episode of ""The Fugitive"" was originally going to be called ""Just One Road I Travel"", but the title was changed prior to the show's December 1964 telecast.

==========================

FINAL THOUGHTS:

45 episodes down and 75 to go.

Paramount Home Entertainment has done a very nice job of presenting the first season-and-a-half of ""The Fugitive"" in exceptional quality on DVD (particularly since Paramount has decided to make available to consumers [at least for a limited time period, at any rate] a version of Season 2, Volume 1 that reflects the way it should have been released in the first place--with the vast majority of the original 1964 music intact throughout those 15 episodes).

I would prefer to have the seasons available in complete-season DVD sets instead of the half-year compilations we're getting, but I'm certainly not going to throw any stones at Paramount because of that decision. I'm just pleased that this superlative TV series is being released on DVD, period.

Only watched one episode so far, where I left off on the original discs, ""Devil's Carnival"".

From the very first Part I introuduction music, it was a welcome relief. Not sure if some of the other backround music is original, such as jute box in the cafe playing for a few seconds, but the familiar classic variations we came to know and love ARE BACK.

Here's what's happening. Paramount is now offering free replacement disks to purchasers of Season 2, Volume 1, with ""much"" of the original music restored. It's an incredibly easy process. You simply attach the two proof-of-purchase tabs from the Season 2 Volume 1 package insert onto a one-page form and send it in. In 4 to 6 weeks (supposedly), you'll receive four replacement disks AND a replacement for the package insert that you had to ""mutilate"" to get the proof-of-purchase tabs. You don't even have to part with your original disks. This is supposed to be the ONLY way to get the disks with unaltered music--they will never be available in the off-the-shelf set.

Amazon apparently won't let me put in the link here, so just google ""paramount fugitive replacement program"" or something like that and you'll find it.

I really didn't have a strong opinion either way in the debate raging over the replacement of the music score in Season 2 Volume 1. I lean toward the viewpoint that; a) Dicking around with a work of creative art like ""The Fugitive"" is never a good thing, but b) I'd rather have the series with altered music than not have it at all. However, now it seems that Paramount has listened to the true purist fans and is trying to make things right.

  Kimble hides in a station wagon to avoid the police and it takes him to a foster-center for kids, where a troubled young bully manipulates Kimble with a plan to use him to escape the place.

12. Detour on a Road Going Nowhere * * *
  Kimble enjoys a somewhat comfortable job at a vacation resort until the manager's safe is robbed and the cops take his finger-prints. He flees the resort on the next bus but a radio plays the police report and he is exposed, after which an older guy gets hold of a gun and decides to hold Kimble for the cops. Luckily for Kimble, the roads are blocked by an avalanche, the axel of the bus is broken, and they are stranded in the woods for the night.

13. The Iron Maiden * * * *
  While working deep underground for a government missile silo under construction, Kimble, a state congresswoman, and 3 other men are trapped by an explosion which buries them under tons of rubble. A careless reporter who took a picture of the congresswoman while Kimble was beside her publishes the photo and Gerard waits for the rubble to be removed to take Kimble in.

14. Devil's Carnival * * * *
  Kimble gets a ride from a notorious bank-robber and while they are getting chased by a local sheriff through a tiny little town, he grabs the wheel of the vehicle just in time to prevent them from hitting a young man crossing the street. The vehicle crashes and they both get out and run into a restaurant, but the sheriff nabs them and they both land in jail. The young man helps Kimble escape after he learns who he is and can't believe he's guilty.

15. Ballad for a Ghost * *
  Kimble befriends a night-club singer with a severe medical problem at the club he is working and tries to help her. The night-club owner, who is her ex-hubby, creates some friction and pegs Kimble for a drug-addict after finding his wife's needle in his room. Apparently, nobody knows about the singer's problem except her agent, who has been keeping it a secret to avoid bad publicity.

The great theme is the same, and of course, David Janssen is wonderful.  Now I am hooked, and really wish there were more available.  I must admit that, if I had not read the bad reviews, I probably would not have realized the music was not all original, as it was period music, appropriate for TV shows in the 60's.

unlike the orginal music it is intrusive.  There is a local station
here in Chicago that is airing the series in the order it aired and

3132202,4,B0014FAIX4,"First fell in love with this series in the 80s when they were broadcast from a local station. What an incredible series. All the elements of this show is top notch, they all fit so well. I bought the 2 volumes of the first season as soon as they came available and was very happy with them. But after reading the reviews for season 2 vol 1, I decided to rent it via netflix and make my own judgement.

The Good:
CBS/P as with the first season did an excellent job with the video quality.

The Bad:
To give credit to the new composers, they did make their music in the style of the era well, but too often I can tell that it was done on synthesizers which is strange to hear when watching a show from the early-mid 60's.

Despite their efforts, not hearing the identifiable and beautiful Pete Rugolo theme variations throughout the episode really takes something out of it. You realize how much Pete's music was a vital part to the mood and feel of The Fugitive. The episodes are just not the same without it.

The Ugly:
Those who made the decision to completely change the episodes music either don't realize how important theme music is to a specific show (especially this one) or don't care.

The Hope:
That those in the position please hear us fans and correct this release and keep future releases as intact as possible. I'm aware some music from the first season was changed but I didn't notice it. Why couldn't they do the same with this release? I'm also aware there were some ownership issues with some of the music cues. Why not replace just those? AT THE VERY LEAST PLEASE KEEP THE RUGOLO MUSIC!

Here's hoping they listen...

UPDATE: Received the replacement discs. I'm very satisfied. Most of the original music is back and blends well with the Hayes music left.

Originally gave it 2 stars and would've given it 5, but ""Cry Uncle"" still has that damage during some scenes and ""Ballad for a Ghost"" still missing that Paige scene. But overall very happy. 4 1/2 stars!

Thank you to whoever at Paramount listened to the fans of this great series, keep 'em coming!",1223596800,,2073,4.477453580901857
3132203,1,B0014FAIX4,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of this DVD and I was MORTIFIED to hear the severe musical alterations which plague this production.  I knew that Paramount thought of The Fugitive as an illegitimate child when I heard musical substitutions in the Ballad For A Ghost episode with Janis Paige.  Having the VHS versions of The Fugitive, it is easy for me to decode where untrammeled recording ends and when edited or dubbed offering begins.  None of the manhunter musical elements which Pete Rugolo injected into this masterpiece exist save for the opening and closing credits.  In fact, the closing credits have the names of entry level musicians and vocalists superimposed on the screen.  This is farcical!  I truly believe that Paramount figured on keeping all of the profit money for themselves rather than pay the estate of the series music composers.

This latter statement doesn't encompass The Fugitive only, though it should.  But there are other series Paramount releases on DVD which have their original music libraries tampered with also.

In short, the main reason Paramount has messed with The Fugitive mood music is because the show is not really theirs.  And nor is Gomer Pyle.  Incredibly, neither Mission Impossible or Mannix, both Paramount productions, feature no altered music.  Hmm...

Anyway, it is SO great to see The Fugitive on DVD.  As fans our issue is not with the film prints (the show is 46 years old),  or the stories (they still weather the test of time),  which is why we anxiously awaited the program's release.  But we identify with the musical inflections of Pete Rugolo which speak in a way that the protagonist doesn't always have to.  We fans are a sentimental, nostalgic lot who only wanted Paramount to share the same convictions.  And now that Paramount knows how we feel, maybe, maybe, they will feel disposed to do what what Infinity Entertainment has done for its Route 66 customers.  That is, the complete re-release of Season 2 of The Fugitive with its original music.  A few bonus features such as original retro commercials or commentaries from surviving components of the series would be great, too.  But at this point, PLEASE re-release The Fugitive volumes in their pristine glory.

This series is great for a whole lot of reasons, many of which have been well- documented here. It shows what life was like in America, before McDonalds and WalMart and Target and Hollywood trash culture--- before the tyranny of political correctness and focus groups--and before popular culture became a comic book.

 It reflects a morality and grace in the larger culture that has long  since disappeared.

David Janssen IS the Fugitive. He was perfect casting for the part. Just watch him; he never looks happy even when he smiles, his mannerisms suggest constant nervousness, he constantly checking his surroundings because of his paranoia. And with all of this his compassion & human kindness still comes through. When someone else is down & out he won't leave that person behind. When a person is hurt he will care for that person. There is no moral ambiguity in Richard Kimble, he's about doing the right thing, even when it might cost him his freedom. This is the kind of person we all want to be & should be but, sadly, few of us are.

Barry Morse is Lt. Phillip Gerard. Lt. Gerard is after Richard Kimble. He's relentless in his pursuit. He doesn't question Kimble's innocence, he only wants to recapture him. He's a good policeman just doing his job which doesn't include determining if Kimble is innocent. But the underlying truth is this: Kimble escaped while in his custody, this makes him feel as if he were personally responsible, this is an unstated truth.

This collection of The Fugitive has fifteen episodes on four discs. They are in great condition except for one episode. One of the most interesting episodes is ""Nemesis"". In this episode we discover that Lt. Gerard has a son, Phil Gerard, Jr. They are going camping & it becomes obvious that they haven't been able to spend a lot of time together. Then Lt. Gerard discovers that Kimble is nearby & that becomes the most important thing once again. Kurt Russell portrays the son & in an interesting bit of casting, Russell's real life father (Bing Russell) has a part as a police officer. In another episode, ""Cry Uncle"", another famous child actor is featured, Ron Howard (The Andy Griffith Show & Happy Days). Howard's role isn't the featured role but it's interesting to see him in glasses, chewing gum, portraying an orphan. Tuesday Weld is the only other person to guest star in these fifteen episodes that had any prominence in the profession. She portrays a blind person in ""Dark Corner"".

(EDIT) Other guest stars of note: Warren Oates, Suzanne Pleshette, Leslie Nielson, Janis Paige, Ed Begley, among others. I apologize for not mentioning these superb guest stars.

3132245,1,B0014FAIX4,"If CBS/Paramount had bothered to check, they would have discovered:

1) Rugolo's underscore is a work-for-hire and royalty-free to use;

2) The five or six ""questionable"" cues from their own CBS/Capitol library were in fact not so questionable, since the very cues appear not only in the season one sets still on shelves, but in sets they are still releasing (e.g. Perry Mason, S3V1, etc.);

3) Editing out the song from BALLAD FOR A GHOST was unnecessary as the song was not only written for the episode, but included in the script, which makes performance rights a non-issue.

I'll stop at three points because I've made my point.  Even if I concede the five or six stock cues had to go (and I don't), it would have taken a lot less time to fill the holes with Rugolo's underscore than to totally rescore.  No question this would have been a better solution, but since cutting and altering has become a reflex for CBS/Paramount, a rule instead of an exception, they probably didn't even consider it.

The buyer had a choice, but not so with this edition of ""The Fugitive"" TV series. No choice is possible as only this altered version of the 15 episodes with new music is on offer. I purchased it before I realized this was the case. I actually need a magnifying glass to read the disclaimer on the back as it is in as small a font as possible without disappearing from view, ""Some music has been changed for the home entertainment version."" From what I gather from CBS Video's own admission is that ""ALL"" the background music has been replaced, so this is not only almost hidden, it is not honest and would not fit into very many people's definition of ""truth in advertising."" But even more dishonest is the fact that in a much larger font and all caps and in a much more prominant place on the back cover is the statement, ""TRANSFERRED FROM THE ORIGINAL NEGATIVE WITH RESTORED AUDIO""... As I have read from another review, this is not a ""restoration"" as the audio portion should really be termed ""desecrated"" as the music is not restored at all. To restore something in my opinion is to bring it back as close to the original as possible, not re-do it almost entirely.

The only way I know to really get the attention of the marketing folk at CBS is to vote with our pocketbooks. I will not buy any future releases that have altered music such as this volume. The majority of people posting reviews here are very disturbed by this release and I would guess sales have been affected compared to the prior two volumes where the background music was in place. I have to wonder what legal difference there was between the first and second seasons to make this change necessary. I would guess that it would not be hard to resolve any issues. The point is that after lulling purchasers into expecting the original music found in the prior released volumes, which both carried the same disclaimer phrase but in larger type, there is no real warning before purchase except in forums such as this. I can read the phrase on both earlier volumes without the magnifying glass, especially the first volume where all caps have been used. I find it ironic that it can be read on the versions with the background music intact, and is barely legible on the one where all the background music has been replaced. Was this the intent, to dupe unsuspecting buyers? Whatever the case I feel defrauded.

Perhaps there is a chance that the popular opinion of fans of the series, my all-time favorite, will hold sway and we can get essentially orginal versions in the future. Reduced sales would help send the message.",1216166400,51,2812,4.566336633663366
3132248,3,B0014FAIX4,"I'm updating my prior review since I just received my replacement discs on April 20, 2009. They came in exactly four weeks as indicated in the order form! There's no doubt that the soundtrack is much better now. You can really hear the difference in specific episodes like ""Nemesis"". There is absolutely no reason to not buy this DVD set now. I wish I can change my previous rating from 3 to 5 stars, but apparently that's not possible. From the technology, clothing, and terminology used in the episodes you can cleary tell that these stories take place in a different era, but the underlying themes and human dramas are still as relevant today as they were 40 years ago!

[Start of old review] I have the old VHS anthology series of The Fugitive (that have the Barry Morse intros) and compared its music with that on this DVD set. Sadly the familiar Fugitive cues and transitions into the various acts are all gone. The replacement music is not bad, but clearly inferior to the original. That's too bad since the video is excellent. I'm not as down as others are about the missing original score since the acting and stories are still superb, and watching them on DVD is so much better than on video tape.",1216080000,5,1207,4.56221198156682

Even though ""Stock Music"" was frequently used throughout the series,it's STILL an issue of comforting nostalgia to Fugitive fans, something that one is used to hearing, as well as the originally composed cues by Rugolo being an integral part of the show's ""Magic"". And to take that away is lame. It's also an injustice to new,  & younger viewers watching this show for the first time, since they'll miss out on experiencing one of the KEY elements of the show's success.

In addition, as a Professional Composer, NOT hearing the classic Fugitive motif during the episodes, as well as the use of obvious samples for this new music, is ESPECIALLY annoying to me.

It's probably TOO late to hope that the same thing didn't happen with Vol. 2 of the 2nd season's episodes. So one can only hope that CBS gets on the ball with the music clearance issues, and prevent spoiling the remaining season DVD releases of such a  special show!",1216080000,31,1091,4.666666666666667

3132262,1,B0014FAIX4,"A lot of discussion has occurred on this site and other outlets about the music replacement that was done on ""The Fugitive, Season 2, Volume 1"".  If you would like to learn more about the original music artists there is an interesting web site ""David Janssen Archive"", which goes into great detail about the work of Pete Rugolo, Ken Wilhoit, and others.  The site also does a great job of providing some information on what background music should have been used on some of the episodes.  The site can be found at:

[...]

The David Janssen Archive also urges individuals to send letters to the CBS President and the VP of CBS Home Entertainment--mailing addresses are included.  The site urges individuals to write ""rationally and intelligently.""  I agree with this approach, however one can't help but feel very angry about CBS/Paramount's behavior.

I was one of those individuals who pre-ordered Season 2, on the relatively pristine product that was delivered in both installments of Season 1.  I wasn't put off by the disclaimer ""Some Music has been changed for this Home Entertainment version"".  The same disclaimer was used for Season 1, and I didn't find any glaring problems.  One also couldn't help but to be encouraged by the further statement on the Season 2 set which read ""Transferred from the original negative with restored audio"".  Everything seemed in line for an outstanding release...and then I received this bastardized version.  I was further angered by what seemed to me to be the dishonest attempt to deceive the public by how the closing credits on the shows were altered.  ""Music by Mark Heyes"", ""Additional Score by Sam Winans and Ron Komie"" made it seem that they were part of the original artistic team working on the Fugitive during the 1964-65 season.  As we now know, that was not the case.  Heyes, Winans and Komie are contemporary musicians who apparently made the ethical choice to hire themselves out to CBS/Paramount in order to perform a type of musical butchery which allowed the studios to virtually eliminate the musical contributions of the original artists--Pete Rugolo, Ken Wilhoit, and others.

CBS/Paramount has attempted to sell DVDs under the slogan ""We don't just put TV on DVD...We put TV on a Pedestal"".  Well, that is not the case with ""The Fugitive"".  If ever a show deserved the ""pedestal treatment"" it is this landmark show from the 1960s, and indeed one of the more important shows in television history.  I guess the only leverage we have is to try and continue to make our dismay known to the company through these types of postings, letter writing, etc.  The only thing corporate America seems to pay attention to (beyond low sale totals) is widespread consumer discontent and public ridicule.  Ideally, this public approach would lead CBS/Paramount to do the right thing and stop this type of egregious tampering.  If that doesn't work, then maybe those who were duped into buying this set should band together and try some sort of consumer lawsuit for false advertising/product misrepresentation.  If ever there were a legal test case to try out these issues, this would seem to be the one.",1215820800,38,3151,4.924242424242424
3132263,4,B0014FAIX4,"I have aways liked ""The Fugitive"" TV series starring David Jansen.  Why TV Land doesn't take some of the lame shows off their line up and run ""The Fugitive"" a few days a week is still a mystery to me. Each episode features great acting with a variety of skilled players.

I was pleased to learn of the show being released on DVD and have purchased the complete Season 1 and the first half of Season 2.  Like other fans of the show, I was also disappointed that the original sound track has been altered and ask why the producers of the DVD series would do such an injustice to the original works of art and to Pete Rugolo's fine job of enhancing the mood.

The original music provided much of the charm and without it the show is basically flat. The new music is so generic and alien it might as well have been from the soundtrack of Star Wars.

I would rather the episodes not be released at all if the originals are going to be altered in any way. If any of these episodes were ever released uncut on VHS, they would certainly be worth obtaining.

I was captivated by ""The Fugitive"" as a young teenager, and now that I'm in my mid-50's, I enjoy looking back at the great character actors that filled each episode. The stories were well-written and the ""Fugitive"" theme music gives me chills every time I hear it! Everything from Barry Morse's Lt. Gerard to William Conrad's narration (and, of course, David Janssen's perfection of Dr. Richard Kimble) come together to create one of the great T.V. series of all time!!

3132268,1,B0014FAIX4,"From the start the Fugitive could easily have been too depressing a show to watch.  An innocent man mercilessly hounded, forced to run for his life, ""to hide in lonely desperation.""  One big reason that it wasn't unwatchable is that Richard Kimble did have a traveling companion.  It was his theme music.  Particularly during the superior first three seasons, his theme helped form him and his world.  Along with Kimble himself, it was what remained most familiar to fans from one story to the next.  The Fugitive theme continually reminded us that this was Kimble's story, and reassured us that he would survive, as it urged him to move on.  It even added prestige to his quest.  Kimble seemed nobler because of his theme.  But Paramount/CBS has destroyed all of that in their Season Two Volume One release by stripping the original music from the body of the show.  What remains is a kind of disconnected ""vanilla"" dramatic mix that offers none of the previously existing sense of reassurance.  In part because of the condition of American society when the Fugitive was born, the show's message of hope made it much more than just a TV series for many Americans who were feeling pretty alienated and isolated at the time, and that's part of the reason Fugitive fans are taking Paramount/CBS's mutilation of our memories so personally now.  The show had also used other recurring music themes, such as that used to underscore the appearance of the police (especially Gerard), and to otherwise sensitively and effectively maximize the emotional potential of each adventure.  Not all of the music used in the show was original of course, but it all represented the choices of those who had a moral right to make those choices, and it came to be part of the memories of the fans.  The clueless reviewers and the apathetic customers who disregard the damage done by this release are paving the way for more of the same.  Future generations may believe that this release represents all that the Fugitive was. I suggest that those who would respond, ""So what?"" compare the Paramount/CBS first season releases to the second.  This new release is a demonstration of Paramount/CBS's contempt for David Janssen, Pete Rugolo, and the rest of the show's team, for those who have embraced the show for over four decades now, and for new viewers who are being deprived of an authentic Fugitive experience.  To argue that the show is good enough to survive this second season mutilation is a sad cause to champion.  When I watched this new release I felt that Richard Kimble was truly alone in a barren world.  Paramount/CBS has now created a Fugitive that absolutely is too depressing to watch.

3132291,2,B0014FAIX4,"I once attended a class lecture by the great film composer Jerry Goldsmith.  In the class, he showed a scene from a movie (Damnation Alley) which he had scored two separate musical versions for.  He asked us to choose which of the two versions was most appropriate.  It was rather obvious which was the better score, and he agreed.  The point is, there is music which fits and music which doesn't.  The necessity of a successful musical track is fundamental to both movies and television.  It can make or break the incredibly hard work that everyone else involved in the production contributed.  That is why finding the right composer for a project is as important as each person hired in the cast and crew.
  Pete Rugulo's score for the Fugitive is legendary. But when I started reading what Paramount had done to Season 2, I had to hear it for myself.  And I must agree whole-heartedly with those that are criticizing the changes.  It's not that the ""new"" music is bad.  It's just not appropriate.  To those of us who grew up as Fugitive junkies, it's just too weird.  Our familiarity with the original music legitimizes our contention that the score has been ""dumbed down"" to an unacceptable level.
What made the original score so compelling was hearing the main theme refrained throughout the show.  The music was scored to convey the plight of Richard Kimble.  And (as all good scores do), it blended with the action in such a way that you were almost unaware of it and how it was affecting your responses.  But that is no longer the case.
This ""new"" score is so blatant, it was hard to enjoy the action (which I've grown to love so much).  Of course the action and the acting is great.  Of course the writing is second to none.  Of course all the cast and crew gave us one of the best shows ever televised.
And now that we all have the opportunity to finally own the series on DVD, it's not the same show anymore. Paramount has succeeded in making the show lackluster, by depriving it of its necessary entirety.  It's as if you were given your favorite dish, minus one of its best ingredients.  The ""chefs"" at Paramount have served us a familiar meal, but it tastes and smells different.  It may be palatable for some, but for us Fugitive gourmets, it's very hard to swallow.
Was this a legal problem?  The music in Season One is exactly the way it should be.  Why change the body of the score and leave the theme intact?
It is certainly a difficult decision for buyers who crave a complete collection of The Fugitive, but who will end up with much less than they anticipated.
I can only recommend this DVD on what is left for us.  The sound and picture quality is fine.  But this ""new"" score is mixed too loudly and has no soul.  It diminishes the greatest TV show of the 1960s.  One can only hope that the rest of the series will be restored to its original luster.
Otherwise, all we have left is a phantom...someone's version of a show that was completed decades ago, and has now undergone some strange surgery by a bunch of quacks.",1215043200,37,3041,4.4781818181818185

The cues they couldn't legally use easily could have been substituted with appropriate Pete Rugolo music used elsewhere in the series.  There are people out there - I know these people - who are intimately familiar with TV music from this era, who could tell you within SECONDS which pieces came from which library.  They easily could have been tapped for the project - probably for cheaper than what they paid the hack who did the new score.  The studio took the lazy, inefficient and artistically wrong path.

True, the greedy company decided to release each season of the show in two parts, but I swallowed my pride and purchased both volumes of the first season and waited in anticipation for the release of the second. I was in for a huge disappointment.
  Upon viewing the second season volume one, I discovered to my horror that CBS had removed all the wonderful music from the show and replaced it with garbage music. No more Pete Rugolo with supplemental music from Jerry Goldsmith and Bernard Herrmann. Instead we get nothing better than elevator music. My experience watching this disc was thus ruined.
  Now I understand why music could be altered for DVD release. There could be copyright or labor union problems, but this does not excuse the deceptive way CBS informed the consumer of the music modification. They did so on the back of the case in letters so small that only Superman could read them. Normally, if there is some kind of modification, it should be indicated in letters large enough for people to see so that they can be more informed about what is inside.
  CBS apparently has little respect for the consumer and instead hoped that we would buy the tainted disc and never realize a change had been made.

But come on, every single person who doesn't mind the change HAS to be from Paramount? Only a company employee would like it? That's crazy, this is not a religion it's a TV series. I know it's upsetting and alters the original artist's vision, but CBS probably didn't think it was a big deal. It was a business move that backfired. It sucks, but let's get a grip. There's a reason why CBS / Paramount took this chance, if you wanna hear it.

Fact of life: a lot of people (not die hard fans) just don't care about the background music. To them, TV and film scores are just there and hardly even count as music. ""Dude, where are the words?"" ""This just instrumental?"" ""Oh, this is like that boring classical music."" I'm not one of these people, I love film and TV scores and don't listen to much else. I know how important the proper underscore is to a film. But we are in the minority. Oh, not on Amazon, but only die hard fans would care enough to make these posts. And, yes, I realize die hard fans are the DVDs bread and butter, so when a company does this, they will lose a lot of revenue.

But, my point is, not everyone will be upset by this. People who don't notice the music or think it's important to the show just don't mind the change. Again, I'm not talking about the fans who've watched the show for decades and memorized the music and bought the CD. These are people who love the stories, enjoy the acting and direction. The people who fast forward through the credits. And, believe it or not, THOSE are the majority of actual TV viewers today. Which is why we don't have shows with opening and closing credits like we used to.

Just because someone posts a positive review does not make them employees or affiliates of Paramount. That's Para-noid. Lighten up on the consumers, they didn't do this.

Anyway, the prints LOOK great and that's the one star this set gets. As an old school fan, I can't help but notice the altered music and how the new music sounds woefully modern, synthesized and out of date. I would rather have paid $20 more per set to get the series as it was originally aired.

This sets a bad precedent and the reaction from fans will get CBS / Paramount to do one of three things:

1. Pay the licenses and go back and fix it
2. Pay the licenses and have future sets come out unscathed
3. Cut their losses and forget releasing any more sets.

I get a bad feeling that option #3 will be the choice. This is why you don't see new releases of WKRP from Fox. Glad I still have my ""taped from 1991"" VHS cassettes, I guess...

Call me crazy, but I would have gladly waited -- or else paid a little extra for uncut episodes. I also do not understand how CBS/Paramount does not own the musical rights to the CBS Music Library.

The strange thing about this is that CBS/Paramount has a great history with its DVD releases. ""The Twilight Zone"" was given the red carpet treatment for all of its 5-season releases. Such a fine program deserved it. So does ""The Fugitive.""

What a testament to the quality of this program that, despite this unpardonable sin, the show is still engaging, still able to hook the viewer with its taut pace and gentle humanism.

It's a shame - a true shame -- that CBS/Paramount isn't treating this gem with the respect it deserves.",1214611200,21,1294,4.806306306306307

So they get some guy in a garage with a synthesizer that they pay at minimum wage to rescore the show. What these big production studios don't realize is that loyal fans are perfectly willing to pay a little more for the complete show, how it originally aired. I've seen this done a million times with other DVD sets. Take ""The Greatest American Hero"" for example, where a song called ""Eve of Destruction"", which is actually crucial to the plot of the episode, (and is actually mentioned by name 5 or 6 times by William Katt in the episode) is cut out for some muzak garbage, just because the studio didn't want to pay for the rights to use the song. Releasing old tv shows onto DVD is great, but the WHOLE show needs to be released, as it originally aired, or the fans won't have it.

This is just as good, if not better, than most dramas on the air today. I'm mesmerized by David Janssen's performance in every episode, and the cat and mouse game between Kimble and Gerard keeps me on the edge of my seat.

All the other ingredients that made this show great are still there in abundance.  Furthermore, I think the replacement music is quite functionally adequate.  I can understand the upset of purists who remember the show from its original airing.  However, CBS media may not have made this change capriciously or stupidly.  The rights to the music used in these episodes may be under different ownership or contract and the owner may be making ridiculous demands (can you say extortion?) of payment for useage.  I'm not trying to play devil's advocate, it's just that I've seen similar cases involving CD releases of old popular music albums where there are ownership disputes over cover art(see Moby Grape, for instance).  Even at 47, I'm too young to remember much about the show, so to me, nothing is missing and I would not wish to wait for the conclusion of a greed-fueled game of licensing tug-of-war for these sets to come out.  That being said, I am ticked off about episode 3 on disc three (Cry Uncle).  Unless my disc has a unique manufactured flaw, the transcription was made from damaged source material.  If such is the case this could have and should have been rectified before this production was transfered to disc.  Has anyone else experienced this problem?",1214352000,4,1431,4.847736625514403

3132331,1,B0014FAIX4,"I have purchased the first season of The Fugitive, my favorite show of all time. I am thrilled to have them. I will not buy Season Two, Disc One. The reviews here are reason enough. But reviewing CBS/Paramount's lame and deceptive explanation cements the deal.

I do not for a minute believe CBS/P released these adulterated discs just to get them more quickly into the hands of fans who would otherwise be disappointed by delay. No doubt the truth is they made a corporate decision to keep up the cash flow from the release of Season One without delay.

Defacing art is never justified. True curators who value art restore it as best they can to the original, to keep the artistic elements intact but perhaps remove age damage to make it more visible or audible. But they keep all elements of the original. They do not redo it, erase it, overdub it, change its color, splice new scenes, remove scenes, or change its sound, including the musical score. When Orson Welles was on his death bed Ted Turner was busy ""colorizing"" black and white classic films from the past.  Welles told a friend, ""Keep Ted Turner and his crayons away from my films.""

I will not purchase abridgements or adulterations of any type because it is a slap in the face of the artists who created the works. So I join the chorus, fearing that CBS might replace that, too, if it has the chance. And a real shame as I was busy applauding CBS/P for getting these released in such perfect form. If you want to do it right and add to the price, I will buy it.

Venus de Milo is missing her arms. Should we replace them? And yet this is worse, the equivalent of knocking her arms off and replacing them with mannequin limbs. Please, rethink this.",1214179200,24,1713,4.477564102564102
3132332,2,B0014FAIX4,"Okay, I've given this set a 2-star rating instead of a 5-star rating solely because of the missing episode music.  I'd toyed with a 3-star rating, but after watching the first 2nd-Season show ""Man In A Chariot"" with the new music and the same show (dubbed from a video tape) with the original music back-to-back, I concluded that a 2-star score was more appropriate.

THE GOOD:  David Janssen, Barry Morse, William Conrad, et al., and the teleplays!  And I should also mention the beautiful video quality!!

THE BAD:  The new music scores!  Look, a couple of times the new music is comparable to the original music; but overall it is clearly inferior to the original score for that episode (and sometimes the new music even sounded downright out-of-place).  Perhaps what was most disturbing about this ""new score"" was the fact that they totally deleted and replaced the music notes that are the trademark for The Fugitive - in other words, the haunting notes that played many times when something sad or dramatic or just interesting was happening to The Fugitive (i.e., the characteristic theme for the David Janssen character, Richard Kimble).  Yes, believe it or not, you heard me right:  Except for the opening and closing theme music, throughout the entire episode, the trademark ""Fugitive"" notes have been deleted and replaced!  (DELETE THE MUSIC NOTES THAT ARE THE TRADEMARK FOR THE RICHARD KIMBLE CHARACTER? THE MIND BOGGLES!!  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING WHEN THEY DID THIS??? WELL, I GUESS THEY WEREN'T THINKING AT ALL!!!)

WHY did they do this?  Well, according to info on the website of [...] the excuse that CBS/Paramount has given is that there were many new ""music cues"" in the 2nd Season that they couldn't identify the owners of, so they just decided to do a completely new score for the episodes.  (Again, they've kept only the opening and closing theme music.)  And they replaced ALL the music insteading of keeping some of it (such as the trademark notes for The Fugitive) on the lame theory (pretext to cut costs??) that it would give viewers a ""more seamless"" viewing experience(!).

We'll I bought it in ignorance and it's worth 2 stars because it's better than NOTHING - but this really does need to be fixed by CBS/PARAMOUNT!  (And anymore new music they have for Fugitive episodes needs to be erased before they use it in future Fugitive DVD sets!)

THE UGLY:  Okay, here's what I'd call The Ugly about what they've done...it's one last insult to both creators and fans of this classic TV show - THE GUYS WHO DID THE NEW UNDERSCORE FOR ""MAN IN A CHARIOT"" HAVE BEEN GIVEN CREDIT IN THE FINAL CREDITS AT THE END OF THE SHOW - IN FACT, THEIR NAMES HAVE EVEN BEEN PLACED ABOVE PETE RUGOLO'S!!

SO NOW, FUGITIVE FANS, you've heard The Good, The Bad & The Ugly about The Fugitive, Season 2, Vol. 1, and if you ask me there's a whole lot more of The Bad and The Ugly than there is The Good about what CBS/Paramount has done to to hack up the first half of Season 2 of the best dramatic TV series of the 1960s!!

Again, THE MIND BOGGLES!  There must be intellectual carrots in charge over there at CBS/Paramount Home Video!!

Yes, David Janssen's amazing performance is the best thing about the show.  But as great as Janssen and Barry Morse were, the music made the show all the greater.  I can still recall as a youngster the chill I would feel when Gerard's appearances were introduced by the menacing theme that was used.  And I'll never forget the rush of excitement at the pulse-pounding cue that accompanied many of the show's most thrilling moments, such as when Kimble searches for the one-armed man at the bus terminal.  And now I'm hearing that they have cut/replaced ""Just One Road I Travel"", the poignant tune from ""Ballad for a Ghost""?  The tune that was composed by the episode's writer, George Eckstein??  Sheesh, why not rewrite all of the dialogue, redub the whole thing and call it ""What's Up, Fuge?"".  This is madness.

3132337,1,B0014FAIX4,"This wanton and callous castration of a great television series speaks volumes to the arrogance of studio executives who believe that they can do anything and get away with it.  This perception by corporate ""suits"" that the purchasing public is made up of morons who will buy anything that is put before them must be ground to a halt before it becomes the norm, rather than the exception.  ""The Fugitive"" is a landmark show, a ground breaking series that inspired numerous imitations and a major motion picture.  It's a pivotal program in series television history.

There remains in Hollywood a blithe ignorance of the importance of music in both movies and television.  This self righteous sense of superiority has proliferated corporate corridors at all of the major studios since sound first uttered a breath.  Symphonic scoring for motion pictures provided much of the most memorable music of the twentieth century, producing such giants of screen and concert composition as Miklos Rozsa, Bernard Herrmann, Alfred Newman, Franz Waxman, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Dimitri Tiomkin, Victor Young, Hugo Friedhofer, Elmer Bernstein, Jerry Goldsmith, and John Williams.  Such snobbery cannot be tolerated.

Pete Rugolo's haunting accompaniment to Richard Kimble's lonely flight from incarceration and execution is both Emmy winning, and unforgettable.  It is as much an integral part of ""The Fugitive"" series as its star.  Why not replace David Janssen with Kevin Federline?  That will save Paramount even more money.  This is sheer butchery, and it must be stopped by boycotting a series I deeply love and admire.  I, for one, will no longer support this cruel castration with my hard earned money.  Until the brain trust at Paramount wakes up to the fact that we are not supid, or insensitive to their arrogance and penny pinching, I will purchase no further episodes of either ""The Fugitive"" or any of their other products that have been tampered with.  As far as I'm concerned, only one season of this great series has been released and I will have to settle for that.

I have only watched the first five episodes so far, and, while the rescoring is disappointing, it is not as bad as some would have you believe. The music is a bit loud at times, especially at the beginning of acts, but overall is not a bad effort. Admittedly, I have not seen these episodes in years, and do not have any tapes or previous copies, so I do not have the original score memorized. That said, compared to the excellent job on the first season, the new score is obviously inferior, but the superb writing and acting still offer some value in owning this set.

The real question is why such changes had to be made in the first place. I am most troubled by the fact that such drastic changes were not disclosed more fully. While I can accept that certain legal matters may require changes to the score, I wonder why these same problems did not surface prior to the release of season one.  Customers expected the second season to be of similar quality.

I can enjoy what this season two set offers, but unless the studio can solve whatever problems are involved, or, at the very least, come clean with what issues prevent including the original score, I will probably pass on any future releases.

EDIT:  It seems that the studio has agreed to replace the rescored season two release.  This is great news.

3132376,1,B0014FAIX4,"The Fugtive is my number one TV series of all time!  I have had barriers in my life seeing this show! When it first came out, I was too young to stay up and see it for the first 2 years. I could only see the intro and than had to go to bed. At the young age of 9, I knew it was a good show! Than, the last 2 years of its run I got to stay up and see it and they were also showing repeats in the day time! After it ended its run of 4 years in 1967 I did not see it for another 23 years until 1990 on A and E
As I had to work when it was on, I timer recorded all 120 shows and got my first wife hooked on it!
Than, 15 years later it comes out at last on DVD and Season one was such great fun to see and introduce to my second wife and others!
So, I know its a great show and was looking forward to more great stories, great guest stars, more great acting by David Janssen and more of that great music score after June 10th 2008 when it was to come out!
Just for the fun of it I took a look at the reviews for the first half of season 2 planning on buying it within a day or two. Well, I have to say I got very upset from what I learned from all of these reviews on what these Knuckle heads did to it by replacing the music score! What are they smoking? To me it would be like replacing all the James Bond music scores! That would go over like a fart in church! I am trying to find out how to contact this awful company and make a strong loud protest! I tried calling the tv station in my town that is with CBS but they had no info! I tried calling directory help with the phone company and got nowhere! I will keep trying! Everyone should bug the hell out of them! Also, We should suggest Amazon have a talk with them on this !
 There are other ways than the so called offical set to get more Fugtives the right way. Just do a google search and even on Amazon if you look there is another company! One has to be careful who they go thru, but its worth a try!

Even though I obviously wouldn't miss the classic background music like loyal Fugitive devotees, I still cannot condone such a bastardization. I will change my mind if Paramount is able to go back and re-score all of Season 2, but otherise - FORGET IT.

3132426,4,B0014FAIX4,"This is a revised review. CBS has heard the complaints of the fans over having Peter Rugolo's music replaced. They are now issuing replacement discs for the travesty that was Fugitive Season 2, Vol. 1. See here for details: [...].

The new discs restore MOST of the Rugolo music that was replaced, and also many of the CBS library cues (e.g., from The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits). If you are happy with the new discs, I urge you to delete your original review and submit a new one - that appears to be the only way to change your star rating.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

After the first two excellent volumes in the series, I preordered the third volume of The Fugitive. Well, that was a mistake! As others have said, the music has been replaced. And not just the songs that might be heard on TVs or radios in the show - the actual incidental music that plays throughout the show (composed by Peter Rugolo). No more haunting Fugitive theme. It was always such an integral part of the show. How could you replace it? There shouldn't have been any rights issues. The composer should have signed away any rights at the time of creation, so I don't know what the explanation is. Royalties, maybe? Whatever it is, it's not acceptable. It's quite ridiculous.

I should have known it was too good to be true that we could actually get the entire series on DVD. I don't even care about extras - I just want the original series as it was meant to be seen. Is that too much to ask? Paramount, you've already done it twice, why mess it up now?

They're worse.

You don't even have to be familiar with ""The Fugitive"" to know that something is horribly wrong as soon as you start listening beyond the opening credits.  (Actually, before that -- since the music replacements start during each episode's pre-credits teaser, which for this season is simply a repeat of a scene that occurs within the episode itself.)

Absolutely nothing distinguishes this new music, other than its bombast and blandness.  You can tell the composer was trying for a '60s dramatic TV show flavor.  Didn't work, to put it mildly.

It's interesting that a reviewer below used the word ""abomination"" for this hack job.  That's exactly what it is -- and it harks back to Vestron Video's botched 1984 VHS release of ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes,"" where they replaced a lot of the original music.  THAT movie eventually got released with the right score -- took just 17 years, when MGM/UA issued the the DVD in 2001.

We can't wait 17 years for ""The Fugitive"" to have the original music.  Please: Do not buy this, and demand that Paramount get it right.",1213142400,27,1155,4.812182741116751

I'm disheartened to learn of this alteration to the Fugitive's scoring as the original music is crucial to the appreciation of this series.  If Paramount needs to pay the composer's estate more money to obtain rebroadcast music rights, then so be it.

I buy classic series to see them intact, with all of the unedited memories and nostalgia associated with the original broadcast; that includes the music.  If the reviews I'm reading are accurate, and I have no reason to doubt the consensus, then what has been done here is truly a crime.

One can always hold out the hope that the real criminal behind this act will have a conscience, correct the error and try to appease those of us victimized by this injustice before this favorite series meets it executioner.",1213142400,19,859,4.662251655629139

Yes, I would prefer that Pete Rugulo's background music had been retained. And I absolutely hate the way that our overly-legalized and fearful society prevented this DVD from being released intact. But the engrossing stories and poweful acting still make this TV series a pleasure to watch, even as presented on this adulterated Season Two video. Normally, I would rate this DVD a five-star.

It is some other incidental music that sounds newly written and recorded, and is of very mediocre quality.  It is not worthy of this very fine show and does indeed detract from the essence of the production.

Some people unfamiliar with the show may wonder what the big deal is?  In a show like this, the music set a very high standard and was perfectly suited to the atmosphere and action on the screen.  To replace it with the insipid and vulgar tripe found on this DVD is an insult to the creative minds behind the show, and an insult to its viewers as well.  It doesn't completely ruin the show, but it comes close.  I've already written to Paramount and complained--not that they'll listen.  Maybe they'll listen if more people write and we stop buying what they're selling.  Based on this DVD, I've given up all hope of looking forward to future releases.

3132444,4,B0014FAIX4,"[Addendum added below]

Back in June of 2008, when this set was first issued, CBS/Paramount had replaced all of the original underscore with newly commissioned music.  It ripped the heart and soul out of the show and its fans.  But CBS/Paramount wisely listened to its fans, through letters to the company, from online reviews at places like this, and Internet chat forums where the subject was discussed at great length.

In February of 2009, CBS/Paramount announced and instituted a program whereby purchasers of this set could send in their proofs of purchase and receive a revised set with nearly all of the original music restored.  Early returns are in among fans, and overwhelmingly this set is now back to where it should be, given the limitations of some ""minor"" music replacements.

Music replacement is a reality in this litigious society, so if it has to be done, then CBS/Paramount has done its homework and given us an acceptable Season Two Volume One set for THE FUGITIVE.  The vast majority of Peter Rugolo's magnificent music cues are back, as are most of the CBS library cues that originated with shows like THE TWILIGHT ZONE and GUNSMOKE.  There are minor instances of some apparently troublesome cues now replaced with fairly innocuous newer cues.  The important thing is that the soul of the show (the music) has largely been returned.

As Amazon doesn't allow revised ratings in edited reviews, unfortunately, the star rating system for this release will tend to skew lower than it should.  I'm unable to change my initial one-star review to anything higher, but if I could, I'd raise it to four-and-a-half.

The video, as is customary from CBS/Paramount is exceptional, and the series has never looked so good.  The black-and-white imagery is sharp and clear, with great shadow detail.  The original mono sound quality is also good with clear, understandable dialog, and now with the corrected music, is no longer much of an issue.

While there are no extras with these FUGITIVE sets thus far, it's not a critical factor.  This series doesn't NEED extras - the show itself is good enough to sustain anyone's interest and holds up well to repeated viewings.

For reference, it took about two weeks from mailing in the proofs of purchase to my receiving the corrected set.  By the way, you get a full and complete second set - complete with artwork, improved keep case, and printed inserts, which are now readable on the inside without removing discs!

CBS/Paramount has taken our issue to heart and made good on their promise to put classic TV on a pedestal.  Support their efforts with your purchases of this exceptional series on DVD.

[Addendum, several years later.  I'm learning that new orders of THE FUGITIVE, Season 2, Volume 1, are still being shipped with the totally replaced music.  If indeed THAT is the case, then this set should be avoided at all costs.  CBS/Paramount did the right thing in re-issuing the set with largely corrected music, but, if this is true, have dropped the ball again by foisting the replaced-scores-by-Heyes upon an unsuspecting public.

I have watched DVD 1 and scaned DVD 2 and it appears  they changed the back ground music for this entire release. I have been waiting years for this show to hit DVD and Paramount/CBS screwed it up BIG TIME!!!. The opening and closing are still the same but the rest is changed. No light Fugitive theme in the back ground and no Lt. Gerard theme when he comes on the screen. To me, this SUCKS! One of the best things of The Fugitive is the back ground music and how it ""fills"" the episode with Fugitive quaility! I have no idea why Paramount changed the back ground music! There is no reason sinced it is actually music made for the show. I guess when they said restored audio they should have said tampered with audio. I think Paramount has done this show and the fans a great injustice. They should go back and re-do the DVD's on this set and put the origianl music that was made for the show back in and offer us all replacements! The quaility of the episodes are still as stunning as the previous releases! But the changed back ground music totaly destroys the show!

February 21, 2009 (update)

First a grateful high-five to CBS/Paramount for listening to consumers, taking the time and going to the expense to largely correct and re-issue the set. Watching the episodes felt like I was watching The Fugitive again. What makes this show special for me--the forlorn feeling of Kimble, alone, stirred by Rugolo--has been fundamentally restored. I believe most fans will be pleased, and I encourage those who hesitated to buy the set because of bad press to consider picking it up and giving the exchange program a chance.

We were told ""much of the music"" had been put back. This is true for the ten episodes I sampled.  Sadly, however, some, if not all, of the CBS and Capitol cues are gone.  And it stings (although there may be some remaining in areas I haven't checked).

Here are a few specifics.

In ""Man in a Chariot,"" the bulk of the cue from Begley's closing summation has been removed and for most of that great oration we hear only silence beneath him. I'd prefer the Goldsmith cut, yet given the choice, silence works better than Heyes.

In ""Man on a String,"" the identical cue was also expunged. Here Heyes blares over a nervous Kimble in court. Even so, good judgment prevailed, at least in terms of spotting; leaving silence for Begley while potting up replacement music when the drama demands it demonstrates discrimination by the restoration team. The thoughtfulness so desperately needed in the original release is, at least, attempted here. On the downside, portions of the synthesized underscore remain hot, erupting all too pristinely between vintage Rugolo.

In ""Escape Into Black,"" original strains are with us when Kimble is on the train at the end, but when it derails, Goldsmith derails with it and Heyes is screaming on the tracks.

Still, watching ""Tug of War"" made me forget I was viewing a replacement disc; I stopped thinking about all the months of frustration and anguish. I was simply enjoying an episode of The Fugitive, an old friend I'd seen dozens of times and will always love seeing again. Gradually the betrayal, the anger I felt at CBS/Paramount, started to wane.

Of course I wanted every original element returned where it belongs. As a purist who cringed when background music on a jukebox was changed in season one, it's hard for me to swallow my standards, but I would rather return the goodwill the studio has shown in restoring what they can, and see this series head for the finish line, so my children and their children will someday see these beautiful transfers, even if they are only singing at eighty percent.  It's too great a show for me to be stubborn and dwell on the tinge of disappointment I admit I still feel when confronting the reality that my beloved Twilight Zone cuts may not all be there.

But I believe the big picture is, for now, more important than pining for missing cues, especially when I think back to what I believed not so long ago--that the show's legitimate life on DVD was over.  Done.  Dead.

Now it has a chance.  I'm choosing to view kicking out for the rest of the series like buying a starter house.  Sure--maybe I won't live in it forever.  Maybe I don't like everything about the house.  Some things downright bug me about it.  But the equity I accrue is undeniable, and when I do finally sell the house, my equity allows me to get a bigger house, maybe even the one of my dreams.

I have the same hope for The Fugitive.  If we can all come together, support the release--imperfect though it is--and get this run out, then who knows what the future holds for the rights issues.  Meantime the series, in a more or less respectable form, will be in circulation.  To me the odds seem better right now that some day every missing element can be corrected than the odds seemed a week ago to expect Paramount to suddenly announce that not only would they mail me a free set, but a set with much of the music restored.  It's still amazing when I think about it.

The going may get tough when we come to stock-filled episodes like ""Landscape with Running Figures.""  But Kimble never lost faith.  He kept running even when it looked hopeless.  I, for one, don't think it looks hopeless anymore.  I'm ready to dig in my wallet and keep running with the good doctor, hurtling over Heyes if necessary, through season two and beyond.

I hope all true Fugitive fans do the same.

(Original review)

I'm not going to rant and rave, I'll just say that with the exception of the opening and closing title, every piece of music in all the episodes on disc one has been altered (I don't have the heart to check the other discs right now). This is hardly The Fugitive without the great music. I know I am in the minority and others may think it makes little difference, but to me the music is half the show. It's too painful to watch, so I'm giving my set away and not buying any future sets where ALL of the music has been replaced.

I didn't complain too much when non-instrumental music in season one had been changed--music on juke boxes, etc., because that music was not composed for the show. They REMOVED ALL the music composed for the show. I could understand if they even replaced the stock music (cues heard in other shows like The Twilight Zone, etc.), but they REMOVED ALL OF MUSIC COMPOSED FOR THE SHOW except the opening and closing titles. What the....?

I still can't believe it. I've waited for years for this show to come out on DVD. I am tremendously sad and disappointed. I sat there in front of the TV and couldn't believe what I was hearing.

Why would Paramount/CBS do this? I can understand them not wanting to deal with clearance issues for a series that will probably sell modestly. But how can it be a clearance issue when it's ALL the music composed specifically for the show? The only thing I can think of is that they didn't want to bother figuring out what was stock and what wasn't, so they replaced it all (added comment--this turned out to be right!)

In any case, I believe people should be made aware that ALL of music has been changed.

To me, it would be like watching the original Star Trek series without the music. What would be the point?

I still can't believe it. Part of me thinks if I go to bed and wake up in the morning and put the DVD back in, it will all have been a bad dream.",1212969600,3,6415,4.524263431542461
3132447,5,B0014FAIX4,"As a young teenager, I was introduced to Dr. Richard Kimble by my older brother, who came home one night and told the family gathered around the television watching ""The Garry Moore Show"" that we just had to switch channels and watch ""The Fugitive.""  I was hooked from Day 1.  David Janssen graced the covers of a lot of show business magazines in those days, and reviews of the show in TV Guide got me reading ""Les Miserables"" (who was Javert? who was Jean Valjean? what about the 'noir' look of the series as compared to the underground sewers in Paris?). It would be great if Paramount includes all episodes (some were missing from the ""World Vision"" production that aired on A&E 18-20 years ago) and some extras for the huge Fuge fan base (baby boomers).",1210291200,,758,4.5661764705882355
3132448,5,B0014FAIX4,"Every once in a while a movie, or in this case a TV series captures the hearts and minds of those lucky enough to find it.  ""The Fugitive"" was just such a series.  Why??  First is the show's basic premise.  Dr. Kimble, a good man, is wrongly accused of killing his wife.  He is indicted, placed on trial, and a jury of his ""peers"" quickly finds him guilty of her homicide.  Later, as a police lieutenant, named Gerard, escorts him in handcuffs to a state penitentiary to be executed by the state for his ""crime"", fate steps in and the train they are riding suddenly, and with warning, derails.  The handcuffs that restrain him are broken by the force of the crash.  Suddenly.... Kimble finds himself a free man - the police lieutenant is nowhere to be found.  The train crew is much too busy trying to recover their own wits and attend to the medical needs of the injured and dealing with the dead to worry about this one escaped fugitive.
Dr. Kimble spends the subsequent weeks, months and yes.... years trying to prove he didn't kill his wife.  His only chance is to find that stranger he saw leaving his neighbohood, a one-armed man who he believes broke into his home to commit burglary, only to kill the woman who became a tragic witness to his crime.  She saw too much - she could identify him.  She had to die - period!
Each week, our intrepid hero scoures obscure towns and villages, hoping and praying to cross paths with his quarry and force him to answer for his wife's murder. That was just one problem to solve.  Keeping one step ahead of the dedicated, perhaps even obsessed clutches of Gerard would prove to be even more difficult - especially since he knew Gerard would never believe his story.  Kimble was found guilty.... he had to pay for his ""crime""  Lieutenant Gerard considers Dr. Kimble's miraculous escape to be the one stain on his record that will not, no... MUST not be allowed to ""just go away"".  Even his supervisor, Captain Carpenter, thinks Gerard has lost all sense of reason or perspective.  The lieutenant's efforts to recapture Kimble are akin to events found in Victor Hugo's Les Miserable.
In traveling from town to town, Kimble assumes the identity of many, many occupations to elude detection or even suspicion.  Migrant worker, bartender, fishing net maker and so on.  He meets many people in his travels.  This allows us to see many newcomers to the acting industry, such as Robert Duvall, Susan Oliver, Vera Miles, Brian Keith and many (really) others to hone their young crafts.
Like millions of other people in this country, my late father loved this show.  I'm sure, on some level, he and these others really identified with Dr. Kimble's sense of loneliness.  David Janssen was an actor with considerable skills.  He had many acting credits during his career, but Dr. Kimble was made for him - no question about it.
If you haven't had a chance to see this series.... if you want to see quality television.... run, like a fugitive, and get this series on DVD.
Whoever it was that claimed that television was a vast wasteland obviously never saw this series.  I can only hope they eventually put every episode on DVD.

This series was -- unequivocally -- the Greatest Dramatic TV Series -- In fact -- One iof the Greatest Dramatic Stories -- of all times.  The running began when I was 13.  It was the first show I was allowed to stay up to watch. For a while -- the choice was -- imagine this -- The Fugitive -- or Star Trek!!! I chose TF without blinking an eye-- opting to rely on the simmer reruns (Series' were always repeated during the summer in those days). for my Trekky fixation.  I used to film the Fugitive from my Bolex 16mm.  In fact, I was so taken by the plight of this beleaguered & innocent man that I decided to emulate the man he really needed dig up the truth -- Perry Mason (another favorite -- though not on the same scale).  Now I often represent people accused of murder -- and -- too often for comfort -- people who didn't do it.  Death Penalty fans should be force-fed this series.  Richard Kimble ""looked"" guilty.  The evidence was strong indeed.  But the truth --as it turned out -- was both illusive and yet believable (What great writers!!!).  Janssen was  ""The Fugitive.""  Fortunately -- he evaded capture by the evil Gerard(well -- he kept a man in Hell -- for four years) He did so long enough for Gerard to come around (Nice Gerard) so far that -- in the end -- it is Gerard that saves Kimble's Life.  I am indeed thriiled that after the first season -- when things were looking glum -- Kimble didn't just change channels and ""Beam Up.""",1206835200,4,1516,4.292253521126761

3366595,5,B0014FAIX4,"At long last, the groundbreaking television series, ""The Fugitive"" comes to DVD. This show, which lasted from 1963-1967, was suspenseful, moving, engaging, and original. This was the first successful television show that took the dramatic formula of putting the hero with new characters and in new situations every week to another level. In previous shows such as Cheyenne, Maverick, and many others, the hero was a wanderer going from town to town to earn a living. In this show, the hero had no choice. He had to run to stay out of jail.

Charged with murdering his wife, a crime he did not commit, Dr. Richard Kimble, played by David Janssen, escapes from the law when the train taking him to his execution wrecks. Tracked doggedly by police inspector Gerard, Kimble wanders across the country running from the law while trying to track down the one-armed man he saw leaving his house the night his wife was murdered. As he wanders the country, he helps many people with their problems, all the while trying to find the one armed man and trying to avoid Gerard.

This classic show had all the goods - great acting by Janssen, Morse, and the many guest stars, fantastic narration by William Conrad, clever, well-written scripts, and taut direction. This show had it all, and made Dr. Richard Kimble one of the most famous and sympathetic characters television history.

I then bought S2-2 for a very cheap price when it was on offer and it was bearable as well.

1. I had no idea what the original music was supposed to be.
2. The music did not seem ""inappropriate"" or any sort of immediate ""bad fit"" to the episodes. Nothing ""wrong"" stood out at all.
So why would I care? Its not like I'm watching some action-packed chase scene and they're playing Sesame Street music. If you didn't vividly remember the original, I doubt new viewers would know. Still, I admit there is something to be said for keeping things the way they were originally. Genuineness is good.

This is a good batch of episodes. The nice things about The Fugitive are:
1. It was believable.
2. It wasn't all ""Blood-n-guts & explosions"" like so many shows these days.
3. Very good and creative situations that Kimble (played by David Janssen) finds himself in.
The show isn't dull at all and holds my interest watching it.
So Treat Yourself! Buy a half-season (or more) of this show. Its Good TV.  Kimble is on-the-run. Will someone recognize him? But he's really innocent. Will anyone believe him?

3366637,1,B0014FAIX4,"[Addendum at bottom]
I am a very new fan of The Fugitive, and, after seeing one episode on television a couple weeks ago,I grabbed a DVD copy of Season One, Volume One that I saw on a store shelf. Since I watched the first episode, I've been completely hooked (I am not exaggerating; I suspect I will soon need to enter a rehabilitation facility for my addiction). I quickly decided that I must add the entire series to my shelves, which, being on a college budget, is something I never do at once (especially on a split-season basis). However, though I was not alive during the time of the original airing of this show, I was raised on classic television and watch little else. I decided to make an exception and dip into my meager savings for The Fugitive.

I'm sure whoever reads this will, by this time, know of the near-complete music replacement of all volumes of Seasons Two and Three of this show with what other reviwers have endeared as ""Crap Synthesizer Music"". Because of this, I need not go into detail about the incredible disservice this does to not only to the timeless masterpiece that is The Fugitive, but to the show's loyal fans, both old and new. However, in this review I would like to emphasize that this deplorable error is causing CBS/Paramount to lose a ton of business.

I was fortunate enough to read the other reviews in their entirety before clicking the ""add to cart"" button, and was spared the anguish of recieving a needlessly desecrated version of my now favorite TV show. That being said, I refuse to purchase this set, and the other sets with the replaced music. Originally, I was going to buy it anyway, having heard of a Replacement Disc program that CBS offered. My plan was to buy the set and mail in my request for replacement discs right away. But, BUYER BEWARE: CBS no longer offers this program. On top of that, after spending the money to make the replacement discs (and re-producing the entire set was no cheap endeavor, I'm sure), CBS IS STILL MANUFACTURING THE DISCS WITH THE REPLACED MUSIC, instead of producing the replacement discs in newly manufactured sets!!!! It seems that CBS does not understand that appreciation for this show is not limited to the original viewers. Classic TV shows have an ever-growing, dynamic fan base, so not only is CBS screwing over the original viewers, but their children's generation, and their children's and children's children's generations, and, if DVDs are still in existence then, CBS will still be facing livid consumers for this grave business miscalculation. And yes, CBS, your lack of profits will show this.

CBS was about to make a huge bunch of money off of this show. Not only are new viewers such as myself flocking to the show, these same new viewers are demanding that all their friends of younger generations watch it with them, and now they're hooked. These friends have friends, and, let's face it, with the greater onslaught of reality TV being forced down people's throats, shows like The Fugitive have little competition. Over the past couple of weeks, I have introduced exactly 23 friends to the show, who are also hooked but refusing to buy these sets. I am proud to say they are also showing their friends and spouses, and reminding their parents of how wonderful the original show was. So just on one outraged customer, CBS, you have lost a ton of money. Now imagine that this same phenomenon is occuring with most, if not all, other livid fans.

I wish CBS/Paramount good luck with their future business, because not only will I not buy these sets, but I will be incredibly careful of any CBS/Paramount products in the future. Multiply that by all my friends and their friends, and it equals a chain reaction of CBS's lost business.

[Addendum]
I have found that CBS was going to put out a complete series set on 33 discs, including a CD of the original music. CBS stated that most of the original cues were in place ([...] ).

3366651,4,B0014FAIX4,"I bought this disc of ""The Fugitive"" hoping that they would have replaced the discs with the replacement discs.  This was not the case and from what I have been able to find out, you can no longer get the replacement discs.  However, given that this volume of the discs were on sale, I do not feel too ripped off.

That being said, what of the music that many have been critical of?  Unfortunately, I found that at times, the music did not quite fit what I was watching.  There were instances where it was OK and I did not notice it, but on other occasions it lacked subtlety.  I must admit I have not seen the original version of these episodes to see how it compares, though I do not remember the music in season one sticking out like a sore thumb at times.

The real winner on these discs are the stories themselves.  The moral dilemma for Kimble in 'Man on a String' of does he let an innocent go to prison or does he allow himself to be revealed to all is a fascinating question for our hero and ourselves.  The tragic consequences of mental health in 'When the Bow Breaks' is nothing more than a true tragedy.  Through the eyes of a boy (Gerard's son played by a young Kurt Russell) asks an interesting question of can two men be right is a wonderful look at two opposing characters in 'Nemesis'. 'Dark Corner' is truly dark with a protagonist who I am not sure is not just evil of character. How will Richard Kimble escape from Gerard is a key hook for 'Escape into Black' (where Kimble has lost his memory), 'The Cage', 'Detour on a Road Going Nowhere' and 'The Iron Maiden'. The further enticement of 'Escape into Black' is the fact that Kimble who has no idea is within spitting distance of the elusive one armed man!

Sadly, there are no special features on the series in this (and I do not think there are any) on any of the discs.

It is the quality of the stories which makes this disc worth the purchase.  The story of a man who struggles with his battle between caring for others and doing what he believes to be right, and the risk to his own freedom and the pursuit of the one armed man who will clear him once and for all.  It is that which means this release does deserve four stars!",1299110400,,2203,4.251798561151079

Primarily because of that abominable remixed synthesizer background music;  which totally ruins those fond memories us auld skoolers have for this classique A.B.C. series. Video quality on S2 Volumes 1 & 2 are just as crisp as A.B.C.'s broadcasts of nearly 5 decades ago; possibly better. But those damn synthesizers are just plain jarring(kinda like Ozzy fans wondering why he replaced the original rhythm section on recently remixed/remastered ""Blizzard of Ozz"" cds). To the uninitiated, it's a credit to the Fugitive's cast-n-crew-n-writers that newbies enjoy that taut suspense these great episodes delivered. Even after knowing Dr. Richard Kimble will eventually be vindicated. CBS/Paramount could have easily afforded Pete Rugolo's background music copyrights via nearly three decades worth of profits from moi's Star Trek purchases alone! To charge premium prices for an inferior product is an insult, pure & simple! Bought the combined Seasons 1 & 2 package last year, wishing against hope that the Season 2 dvds were the updated remasters. Contacting CBS/Paramount for replacements has been futile. Therefore, haven't had any reason to buy Season 3's piecemeal offerings. Maybe Quinn Martin should have let Desilu produce the Fugitive instead, because there didn't seem to be any hassles acquiring music copyrights for I Spy's three seasons. Am sure Gulf Western/Paramount received quite a few complaints about ""Good Night Sweetheart"" not being on ""City on the Edge of Forever""s vhs release, because it sure as hell wound up on the dvd!

Instead, I bought a second Volume One from Amazon under the assumption that it had the original music. WRONG!  They're still selling the edition with the replacement music.  Volume Two proved to be almost as bad as far as the replacement music is concerned.

Since then, I've dug out my old A&E Network Fugitive VCR recordings from the early '90s.

I purchased this dvd set on June 12, 2010 from Amazon, long after it was a known fact that CBS/Paramount intentionally changed all the original musical score with that awful synthesizer music and long after they attempted to make it right with outraged fans by issuing replacement discs with most of the original musical score in-tact.

I give ""Fugitive - Season 2, Volume 1"" one star, not for the series but because the dvd set that I received from Amazon still contains the synthesizer music.  Apparently the replacement program was a limited time offer.  I wish now that I had bought the series before the replacement offer expired so that I could have taken advantage of that offer.  The cost of the dvds were still very expensive and I was waiting for the price to come down before buying.

I need not talk about the synthesizer music because there are plenty of other reviews out there which have covered that subject.  This is the first time that I have viewed The Fugitive so I decided to take my chances, where I have never had a chance to hear the original music from season 2.  Later, I decided to aquire a couple of VHS copies of the original season 2 Fugitive.  Having now compared the original music to the cheesy synthesizer version, I can understand why many diehard fans of the series were so outraged.

CBS/Paramount should have done more than just offered replacement discs for a limited time. They should have issued a total recall to all retail and online stores to pull that garbage off the shelves and replace it with discs containing the original music.",1276732800,11,1606,4.663120567375887

Heyes tried to match the period, and some of his cues were pretty decent, but the use of synthesizers was obvious at some points and the overall result was nowhere near as good as the orignal.

The replacement disc program changed everything. Note that what you buy on Amazon is likely the original release with the music changed. You have to download a form from CBS/Paramount, fill it out and tape the proof of purchase to the form. Send it off by September 2009, and CBS/Paramount will send the replacements by return mail at no charge. You're only out the cost of a stamp, and you don't even have to send back the original release. You end up with two sets of disks.

I've received the replacements, and almost all the original music has been reinstated. A few CBS cues and the Capitol cues (the fogginess of the rights issues on the Capitol cues is what caused the wholesale music replacement and began this saga) are all that's missing. The remaining Heyes music is hard to pick out unless you have a doctorate in The Fugitive's music. Those folks may well not like the replacement disks, though many of those experts who have posted on other forums have been quite pleased.

I am very happy with the replacements. The remaining Heyes blends well into the original cues. In short, it feels like The Fugitive again.

What keeps this from being a 5-star release is the treatment of ""Ballad for a Ghost,"" which has been significantly edited. A song written specifically for it has been removed. If you have that episode on VHS, transfer it to DVD and keep it with this set. Then you'll have a 5-star volume.",1236556800,6,1756,4.600638977635783
3366676,5,B0014FAIX4,"UP-FRONT NOTES ABOUT THE MUSIC:

After eight months of supreme displeasure and backlash from fans of ""The Fugitive"" due to the fact that every single bit of background music for these fifteen episodes on DVD was replaced with new (and less-appealing) musical arrangements, CBS/Paramount pulled a real surprise out of their hat on February 17, 2009, when that DVD studio officially announced that it was introducing a Replacement Disc Program for ""The Fugitive: Season 2, Volume 1"".

And I'm one of those ""Fugitive"" fans who was certainly thrilled to hear that particular announcement, because it means that Peter Rugolo's exquisite music for this series has been inserted back into each of these 15 episodes on the replacement DVDs. And most of the CBS Library music that accompanied each of these shows when they first aired in 1964 has also been put back onto the soundtrack for these four DVDs as well.

Thank you, CBS/Paramount, for listening to the many outraged fans of this outstanding TV series, and for re-doing these DVDs with Mr. Rugolo's music intact. Some of the newly-created music score (composed mostly by Mark Heyes) can still be heard in several of these episodes. But for the most part, the original 1960s background music is back where it belongs.

""The Fugitive"" is a series that relies quite heavily on its musical arrangements (composed mainly by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Rugolo/dp/B0000560K3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Rugolo</a>). A lot of the mood, soul, drama, and atmosphere of this television series rest within its music.

And when Paramount ripped the musical guts out of the first fifteen episodes of Season 2 by releasing this DVD set in June 2008 with completely-different background music, it was a very bitter pill to swallow for fans of the series (and fans of Mr. Rugolo). The episodes just aren't the same without that famous Rugolo (and CBS Music Library) underscore. And, thankfully, Paramount Home Entertainment has apparently realized that fact as well.

Overall, I'd have to say that I'm very pleased with the final ""music"" results on these replacement discs, and even Mr. Heyes' arrangements seem to blend in fairly well with the original Rugolo and CBS cues in the locations where Heyes' material is retained. I haven't heard any of the annoying and loud ""blasts"" of Heyes' music that appear many times on the 2008 re-scored discs.

I think ""Man On A String"" is probably the episode that has the most Heyes music retained for these replacement discs, especially in Act IV, which is ""Heyes heavy"" to be sure.

==========================

REVIEW OF SEASON 2, VOLUME 1:

David Janssen is back as Dr. Richard Kimble in ""THE FUGITIVE: SEASON TWO, VOLUME ONE"", the greatest dramatic series ever put on television (in my opinion anyway).

Like the two first-season sets, CBS/Paramount serves up 15 ""Fugitive"" programs in this 4-Disc DVD collection. The episodes appear to be complete and uncut, running about 51-and-a-half minutes each, just as they did when they were first aired on ABC-TV in late 1964.

Just as a sample, here are the exact run times for the four episodes that appear on Disc #1:

""Man In A Chariot"" = 51:35
""World's End"" = 51:35
""Man On A String"" = 51:25
""When The Bough Breaks"" = 51:38

The 51+-minute average run time includes the ""preview"" segments that appear prior to the opening credits for every show. These previews (or trailers) were a new feature implemented for the second season of the series.

However, I'd advise first-time viewers of these classic '60s shows to skip the previews and go directly to ""Act I"" of each episode, in order to avoid any ""spoilers"" (or even mini-spoilers) revealed within the preview clips.

Even after having seen each of these episodes numerous times, I still tend to want to skip past the preview/trailer snippets, to avoid having some of the scenes diluted or spoiled when watching the complete program.

Clicking ""chapter advance"" or ""skip"" on the remote control after the episode begins playing will bypass the preview section and the opening credits too. You can go straight to ""Act I"" with one click.

There are a total of 7 individual DVD chapters per show, logically placed at the end of each of the four ""Acts"" and at the end of the ""Epilog"" scene for every episode.

The video and audio quality for these fifteen black-and-white shows is very good indeed, with only one (partial) exception to this rule--and that's during a small portion of ""Cry Uncle"", where parts of Act II of that episode suffer from some apparent damage to the original film print, resulting in white lines and dots showing up on the screen.

The outdoor scenes (which are abundant in number throughout the four-year history of ""The Fugitive"") look particularly clear and pristine throughout these DVDs, with only a small amount of grain visible in the indoor scenes as well.

All things considered, I couldn't be more pleased with the way this series looks and sounds on these Paramount DVDs (as of March 2009, that is, thanks to the replacement discs). Like with the Season-One sets, this first volume of Season Two contains a notation on the back of the case which indicates that these episodes have been ""TRANSFERRED FROM THE ORIGINAL NEGATIVE WITH RESTORED AUDIO"".

Every single episode in the 120-show lifespan of ""The Fugitive"" (1963-1967) is definitely a worthwhile experience (IMO). Of course, different people are bound to have their personal favorites vs. some episodes that didn't quite make the top grade.

Among the fifteen shows that comprise this four-disc DVD set, my favorites are: ""World's End"", ""Nemesis"", ""Man In A Chariot"", ""Escape Into Black"", ""Tug Of War"", and ""Tiger Left, Tiger Right"".

==========================

DVD INFO:

Packaging -- Nice and compact. For the ""replacement"" DVD set which was made available to customers in February 2009, a standard-sized (0.5-inch wide) Keep Case is used, with two swinging ""pages"" in the middle of the case that hold all four discs. And no ""overlapping"" discs either, which is a plus, because the discs don't have to touch each other.

The first version of this set that was released in June 2008 (the set with the butchered music soundtrack) comes in a slightly-different type of case, with only two discs attached to a single ""page/leaf"" in the middle, with Discs 1 and 4 being housed on hubs that are attached to the front and back panels of the case, thus covering up the episode descriptions that are printed underneath those two discs.

So, this packaging switch is another reason to say ""Thank You"" to CBS/Paramount for a change they made to this DVD set -- because the new (and better) case design allows for the episode titles and synopses to be easily seen without having to remove Discs 1 and 4 from their hubs.

In my opinion, DVD companies should always provide a list of episodes on the back of each case (just like CBS/Paramount has done in the past with  some of its TV-on-DVD releases, such as the last six seasons of ""The Andy Griffith Show""). That type of at-a-glance episode list on the back of a DVD case, which is not provided for ""The Fugitive"" sets, is very useful and helpful.

Video -- 1.33:1 Full-Frame. Black-and-white.

Audio-- Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono.

Subtitles -- None. English Closed-Captioning is available, however.

Bonus Stuff -- None. (Except for some DVD Promos on Disc 1.)

Discs -- Single-sided, Dual-layered.

Chapters -- 7 per episode.

Menus -- Static; No music; No Episode Sub-Menus. A ""Play All"" button is included on all four discs.

==========================

THE EPISODES:

Here's a look at the fifteen ""Fugitive"" episodes that are included in this 4-Disc collection (episode numbers 31 through 45 in the series), plus original air dates, Richard Kimble's aliases, and a few descriptive passages for some of my favorite shows:

31. ""Man In A Chariot"" (First Aired: September 15, 1964) .... Alias: ""Frank Borden"". .... Season 2 begins in fine fashion with ""Man In A Chariot"", which stars Ed Begley Sr. as ""G. Stanley Lazer"", a bitter and partially-disabled college professor/lawyer.

This episode doesn't feature the always-welcome presence of the late Barry Morse as Lt. Philip Gerard, but it's a winner nonetheless, thanks to an intriguing script and the fine acting performance turned in by 63-year-old Begley (and Janssen too, as always).

32. ""World's End"" (September 22, 1964) .... Alias: ""Mr. May"". .... The great Suzanne Pleshette, who passed away at the age of 70 in January 2008, makes her first of two very impressive guest-starring appearances in ""The Fugitive"". Suzanne perfectly portrays ""Ellie Burnett"", a former love interest of Richard Kimble's from their hometown of Stafford, Indiana.

Ellie, who has a lead on the possible whereabouts of the mysterious and slippery one-armed man, is able to contact Kimble via a personal newspaper ad, which brings about a reunion between the two in Kansas City, Missouri.

But there's a slight hitch -- Lt. Gerard knows Ellie and her family and is once again hot on Kimble's trail, with the help of the Kansas City police, including guest star Dabney Coleman.

""World's End"" ranks as one of my very favorite episodes. Everything about it is just about perfect, including more ""Gerard Chasing Kimble"" action, a good script with a few twists and turns to keep us guessing, and (best of all) the beautiful Suzanne Pleshette in a good role with lots of screen time.

While looking through Ed Robertson's excellent 1993 book, ""The Fugitive Recaptured"", I found the following excerpt which relates to this ""World's End"" episode. It's a 1993 quote from Suzanne Pleshette:

  ""It was wonderful to see 'World's End' again, because I hadn't seen that show since I did it back in '64. .... David [Janssen] was a natural--ahead of his time in many ways. His talent was so great that he made it look seamless, and effortless. He was a skilled professional who never really received the kind of appreciation as an actor that he truly deserved.""

As far as the background music in ""World's End"", it sounds to me as though the entire original 1964 score is here, which I was happy to hear, particularly for the scene at the beginning of Act IV when Lt. Gerard is trying to pry Ellie's and Kimble's whereabouts out of Ellie's mother. That scene's music exudes a lot of deep feeling and emotion, and having it placed back into this episode where it's supposed to be is a major benefit to this first-rate ""Fugitive"" installment.

33. ""Man On A String"" (September 29, 1964) .... Alias: ""Joe Walker"".

34. ""When The Bough Breaks"" (October 6, 1964) .... Alias: ""Pete Broderick"".

35. ""Nemesis"" (October 13, 1964) .... No alias used. .... This is one of my very favorite episodes and probably the one I've watched more than any other (thanks to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-VHS-tape/dp/6304865457/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this VHS tape</a>, which teams up ""Nemesis"" with another all-time Season-Two favorite, ""World's End"", on the same videocassette). The VHS version is pretty good too, but the quality on these Paramount DVDs is, as to be expected, much better.

""Nemesis"" is a unique episode, in that it places Lt. Gerard's son (""Phil Jr."", played very nicely by 13-year-old Kurt Russell) in a situation where he unwittingly becomes the travelling companion of the fleeing Dr. Kimble.

But this unlikely teaming of Phil Jr. and Kimble manifests itself in a very natural and believable way through the show's excellent script (written by Harry Kronman).

When Lt. Gerard discovers that his young son is in the company of the convicted murderer that the Lieutenant has been chasing for these many months, it puts him in a rather precarious and awkward position. He wants desperately to recapture Dr. Kimble, but he's also concerned, quite naturally, for the safety of his son at the same time.

""Nemesis"" offers up several memorable moments, such as Kimble's initial reaction when he finds out who his back-seat stowaway really is (David Janssen's facial expression is spot-on perfect).

The scene where Kimble slugs a police officer is a good one too (with the good doctor using not only his fists as a weapon, but also a radio that happens to be handy). And after disabling the policeman, even though he's just belted an armed officer of the law, we get a taste of the kind of non-violent man Dr. Richard Kimble truly is--deep down inside--when he decides to NOT take the officer's rifle with him as he escapes.

That's a pattern established by the writers of ""The Fugitive"" throughout the whole four-year term of the series, i.e., even when given the perfect opportunity to arm himself with a weapon (be it a handgun or a rifle or whatever), Kimble always opts to abandon the weapon.

Those very types of small, easily-overlooked moments have always struck me as instances of subtle nuance injected into the scripts by the show's many very capable writers, permitting a little more of Dr. Kimble's true, inner character to be revealed, without the doctor ever having to utter a word.

I also want to take a moment to say some (very) good things about the DVD picture quality of ""Nemesis"". Now I must say that all of these episodes look excellent on these DVDs, but I happened to notice an extra level of excellence emanating from ""Nemesis"", and I noticed it especially in the nighttime scene of Kimble and Phil Jr. in the woods (the scene where Phil Jr. builds a fire, much to the dismay of Dr. Kimble).

It helps if you watch that nighttime scene in a darkened room, in order to fully appreciate the deep level of black and the blemish-free overall quality exhibited in that scene. Perhaps I'm nuts, but that scene just looks exceptionally sensational to my eyes.

""Nemesis"" Music Note -- I'm happy to report that this episode (one of my all-time favories in the history of the series; did I say that already?) seems to have every bit of its original '64 musical score back in place. And it's a darn good score too, particularly the pulse-pounding scene at the fish hatchery when Kimble escapes in the sheriff's station wagon. And all of the great Rugolo music that makes that scene so extra good and tense is exactly where it should be on Disc #2 of this DVD set.

36. ""Tiger Left, Tiger Right"" (October 20, 1964) .... Alias: ""Frank Jordan"". .... Leslie Nielsen puts in a strong guest-starring performance here, as a disgruntled disabled man who kidnaps Kimble by mistake.

37. ""Tug Of War"" (October 27, 1964) .... Alias: ""Paul Kelly"". .... Arthur O'Connell is excellent as one of the main guest stars in this episode. Kimble is captured by O'Connell, an ex-sheriff. But does Dr. Kimble remain a prisoner for very long? (I'll bet you know the answer to this one already.)

But there are a few good twists and turns along the way. ""Tug Of War"", like the vast majority of ""Fugitive"" episodes, is a good, solid entry in the series.

38. ""Dark Corner"" (November 10, 1964) .... Alias: ""Jim Russell"". .... 21-year-old Tuesday Weld plays ""Mattie Braydon"", a scheming, manipulative blind girl who takes a liking to Richard Kimble. Does Kimble return Mattie's affection? Watch ""Dark Corner"" and see.

39. ""Escape Into Black"" (November 17, 1964) .... Aliases: ""Frank Barlow"" and ""David Merrill"". .... An accident lands Dr. Kimble in an Illinois hospital suffering from amnesia.

The ""Kimble Can't Remember Anything"" premise is a good one on which writer Larry Cohen and director Jerry Hopper build the foundation for ""Escape Into Black"". And since Kimble can't recall who he is during this episode, he also cannot remember whether or not he really killed his wife.

There's a classic scene in this episode which has a confused and groggy Dr. Kimble actually calling Lt. Gerard to say he is going to turn himself in. ""I understand you've been looking for me,"" Kimble tells Gerard on the telephone.

Kimble then arranges for Gerard to meet him at the train station in Stafford. But Gerard decides he'll intercept his elusive prisoner a little earlier, which brings about another ""oh so close to getting caught"" moment for Dr. Kimble.

40. ""The Cage"" (November 24, 1964) .... Alias: ""Jeff Parker"".

41. ""Cry Uncle"" (December 1, 1964) .... Alias: ""Pat Thomas"". .... 10-year-old Ronny Howard, who must have been given a break during the filming of Season 5 of his regular TV series (""The Andy Griffith Show""), appears as ""Gus"" in ""Cry Uncle"".

Other familiar faces in this episode include Edward Binns, Brett Somers, and Donald Losby. You might remember Losby as Vera Miles' and Brian Keith's son in the 1963 pilot episode of ""The Fugitive"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fear-In-A-Desert-City/dp/B00065X2OU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Fear In A Desert City""</a>).

42. ""Detour On A Road Going Nowhere"" (December 8, 1964) .... Alias: ""Stu Manning"".

43. ""The Iron Maiden"" (December 15, 1964) .... Alias: ""Mr. Parker"". .... There's a solid guest-starring performance in this episode turned in by Nan Martin, who also was excellent in her guest role as the boozing wife of Pat Hingle in the Season-One ""Fugitive"" episode&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Search-In-A-Windy-City/dp/6302767946/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Search In A Windy City""</a>.

44. ""Devil's Carnival"" (December 22, 1964) .... No alias used. .... Warren Oates makes a return ""Fuge"" appearance here (he also had a part in the Season-One episode ""Rat In A Corner"").

""Devil's Carnival"" is a bit of a misfire when compared to other episodes in the series. The storyline is a little on the strange side (IMO), but David Janssen and Warren Oates are always worth watching on screen (regardless of how strange the script might be).

45. ""Ballad For A Ghost"" (December 29, 1964) .... Alias: ""Pete Glenn"". .... Richard Kimble encounters a woman (played by Janis Paige) who strongly resembles his late wife, Helen.

Paige does a nice job in her part as Helen's look-alike, although she doesn't really look like Helen Kimble (who was played in other episodes of the series by Diane Brewster). But, I guess we'll have to overlook that difficulty.

Unfortunately, Janis Paige's musical number has been replaced by Paramount for this DVD release (even in the 2009 ""replacement"" set). Apparently the studio could not secure all of the rights to some of the music in this episode.

A little ""Ballad"" trivia -- This 45th episode of ""The Fugitive"" was originally going to be called ""Just One Road I Travel"", but the title was changed prior to the show's December 1964 telecast.

==========================

FINAL THOUGHTS:

45 episodes down and 75 to go.

Paramount Home Entertainment has done a very nice job of presenting the first season-and-a-half of ""The Fugitive"" in exceptional quality on DVD (particularly since Paramount has decided to make available to consumers [at least for a limited time period, at any rate] a version of Season 2, Volume 1 that reflects the way it should have been released in the first place--with the vast majority of the original 1964 music intact throughout those 15 episodes).

I would prefer to have the seasons available in complete-season DVD sets instead of the half-year compilations we're getting, but I'm certainly not going to throw any stones at Paramount because of that decision. I'm just pleased that this superlative TV series is being released on DVD, period.

There is no mention that it is the new original music package . I imagine if I look closely , the codes on the back might be different than the ones I cut out and mailed in two weeks ago. Only watched one episode so far, where I left off on the original discs, ""Devil's Carnival"".

From the very first Part I introuduction music, it was a welcome relief. Not sure if some of the other backround music is original, such as jute box in the cafe playing for a few seconds, but the familiar classic variations we came to know and love ARE BACK.

OUR LONG NATIONAL NIGHTMARE IS OVER !

Let's go on to finish the season , and get some extras on these discs already !",1236297600,6,791,4.090322580645161
3366688,5,B0014FAIX4,"I'm surprised no one else has posted this information prominently. I only found out about it by reading all of the obscure comments to a previous review. This is so important it should become a part of the Product Description for both Season 2 Volume 1 and Season 2 Volume 2.

Here's what's happening. Paramount is now offering free replacement disks to purchasers of Season 2, Volume 1, with ""much"" of the original music restored. It's an incredibly easy process. You simply attach the two proof-of-purchase tabs from the Season 2 Volume 1 package insert onto a one-page form and send it in. In 4 to 6 weeks (supposedly), you'll receive four replacement disks AND a replacement for the package insert that you had to ""mutilate"" to get the proof-of-purchase tabs. You don't even have to part with your original disks. This is supposed to be the ONLY way to get the disks with unaltered music--they will never be available in the off-the-shelf set.

Amazon apparently won't let me put in the link here, so just google ""paramount fugitive replacement program"" or something like that and you'll find it.

I really didn't have a strong opinion either way in the debate raging over the replacement of the music score in Season 2 Volume 1. I lean toward the viewpoint that; a) Dicking around with a work of creative art like ""The Fugitive"" is never a good thing, but b) I'd rather have the series with altered music than not have it at all. However, now it seems that Paramount has listened to the true purist fans and is trying to make things right. Bottom line: If you're collecting ""The Fugitive"" series but have held off buying Season 2 Volume 1 because of the de luxe music flap, you should now go ahead and buy it. For the additional price of a stamp, you can have your cake and eat it too.",1235088000,18,1790,4.570093457943925

The great theme is the same, and of course, David Janssen is wonderful.  Now I am hooked, and really wish there were more available.  I must admit that, if I had not read the bad reviews, I probably would not have realized the music was not all original, as it was period music, appropriate for TV shows in the 60's.

miss the first words the actors are saying. Not only is it loud but
unlike the orginal music it is intrusive.  There is a local station
here in Chicago that is airing the series in the order it aired and
they are now on the second season they have the orginal music.
Why they had to change the music for the video release is beyond me.

story lines.",1223769600,19,709,4.01418439716312
3366699,4,B0014FAIX4,"First fell in love with this series in the 80s when they were broadcast from a local station. What an incredible series. All the elements of this show is top notch, they all fit so well. I bought the 2 volumes of the first season as soon as they came available and was very happy with them. But after reading the reviews for season 2 vol 1, I decided to rent it via netflix and make my own judgement.

The Good:
CBS/P as with the first season did an excellent job with the video quality.

The Bad:
To give credit to the new composers, they did make their music in the style of the era well, but too often I can tell that it was done on synthesizers which is strange to hear when watching a show from the early-mid 60's.

Despite their efforts, not hearing the identifiable and beautiful Pete Rugolo theme variations throughout the episode really takes something out of it. You realize how much Pete's music was a vital part to the mood and feel of The Fugitive. The episodes are just not the same without it.

The Ugly:
Those who made the decision to completely change the episodes music either don't realize how important theme music is to a specific show (especially this one) or don't care.

The Hope:
That those in the position please hear us fans and correct this release and keep future releases as intact as possible. I'm aware some music from the first season was changed but I didn't notice it. Why couldn't they do the same with this release? I'm also aware there were some ownership issues with some of the music cues. Why not replace just those? AT THE VERY LEAST PLEASE KEEP THE RUGOLO MUSIC!

Here's hoping they listen...

UPDATE: Received the replacement discs. I'm very satisfied. Most of the original music is back and blends well with the Hayes music left.

Originally gave it 2 stars and would've given it 5, but ""Cry Uncle"" still has that damage during some scenes and ""Ballad for a Ghost"" still missing that Paige scene. But overall very happy. 4 1/2 stars!

Thank you to whoever at Paramount listened to the fans of this great series, keep 'em coming!",1223596800,,2073,4.477453580901857
3366700,1,B0014FAIX4,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of this DVD and I was MORTIFIED to hear the severe musical alterations which plague this production.  I knew that Paramount thought of The Fugitive as an illegitimate child when I heard musical substitutions in the Ballad For A Ghost episode with Janis Paige.  Having the VHS versions of The Fugitive, it is easy for me to decode where untrammeled recording ends and when edited or dubbed offering begins.  None of the manhunter musical elements which Pete Rugolo injected into this masterpiece exist save for the opening and closing credits.  In fact, the closing credits have the names of entry level musicians and vocalists superimposed on the screen.  This is farcical!  I truly believe that Paramount figured on keeping all of the profit money for themselves rather than pay the estate of the series music composers.

This latter statement doesn't encompass The Fugitive only, though it should.  But there are other series Paramount releases on DVD which have their original music libraries tampered with also.

In short, the main reason Paramount has messed with The Fugitive mood music is because the show is not really theirs.  And nor is Gomer Pyle.  Incredibly, neither Mission Impossible or Mannix, both Paramount productions, feature no altered music.  Hmm...

Anyway, it is SO great to see The Fugitive on DVD.  As fans our issue is not with the film prints (the show is 46 years old),  or the stories (they still weather the test of time),  which is why we anxiously awaited the program's release.  But we identify with the musical inflections of Pete Rugolo which speak in a way that the protagonist doesn't always have to.  We fans are a sentimental, nostalgic lot who only wanted Paramount to share the same convictions.  And now that Paramount knows how we feel, maybe, maybe, they will feel disposed to do what what Infinity Entertainment has done for its Route 66 customers.  That is, the complete re-release of Season 2 of The Fugitive with its original music.  A few bonus features such as original retro commercials or commentaries from surviving components of the series would be great, too.  But at this point, PLEASE re-release The Fugitive volumes in their pristine glory.

 It reflects a morality and grace in the larger culture that has long  since disappeared.

If the original work is modified beyond what I watched in the 1960's, I will stick with my memories.  The Fugitive series is very dear to my heart and modification of the work, no matter the excuse, is not acceptable.  I will also refrain from buying any products from CBS Entertainment until the policy changes.  Wake up folks.  We don't want repackaged goods -- we want the original as close as it can be.

Indeed, more of the same ""modifications"" of the musical score could be forthcoming in future releases.  Like many, many others, I will not purchase this series any longer under these conditions.

David Janssen IS the Fugitive. He was perfect casting for the part. Just watch him; he never looks happy even when he smiles, his mannerisms suggest constant nervousness, he constantly checking his surroundings because of his paranoia. And with all of this his compassion & human kindness still comes through. When someone else is down & out he won't leave that person behind. When a person is hurt he will care for that person. There is no moral ambiguity in Richard Kimble, he's about doing the right thing, even when it might cost him his freedom. This is the kind of person we all want to be & should be but, sadly, few of us are.

Barry Morse is Lt. Phillip Gerard. Lt. Gerard is after Richard Kimble. He's relentless in his pursuit. He doesn't question Kimble's innocence, he only wants to recapture him. He's a good policeman just doing his job which doesn't include determining if Kimble is innocent. But the underlying truth is this: Kimble escaped while in his custody, this makes him feel as if he were personally responsible, this is an unstated truth.

This collection of The Fugitive has fifteen episodes on four discs. They are in great condition except for one episode. One of the most interesting episodes is ""Nemesis"". In this episode we discover that Lt. Gerard has a son, Phil Gerard, Jr. They are going camping & it becomes obvious that they haven't been able to spend a lot of time together. Then Lt. Gerard discovers that Kimble is nearby & that becomes the most important thing once again. Kurt Russell portrays the son & in an interesting bit of casting, Russell's real life father (Bing Russell) has a part as a police officer. In another episode, ""Cry Uncle"", another famous child actor is featured, Ron Howard (The Andy Griffith Show & Happy Days). Howard's role isn't the featured role but it's interesting to see him in glasses, chewing gum, portraying an orphan. Tuesday Weld is the only other person to guest star in these fifteen episodes that had any prominence in the profession. She portrays a blind person in ""Dark Corner"".

(EDIT) Other guest stars of note: Warren Oates, Suzanne Pleshette, Leslie Nielson, Janis Paige, Ed Begley, among others. I apologize for not mentioning these superb guest stars.

3366742,1,B0014FAIX4,"If CBS/Paramount had bothered to check, they would have discovered:

1) Rugolo's underscore is a work-for-hire and royalty-free to use;

2) The five or six ""questionable"" cues from their own CBS/Capitol library were in fact not so questionable, since the very cues appear not only in the season one sets still on shelves, but in sets they are still releasing (e.g. Perry Mason, S3V1, etc.);

3) Editing out the song from BALLAD FOR A GHOST was unnecessary as the song was not only written for the episode, but included in the script, which makes performance rights a non-issue.

I'll stop at three points because I've made my point.  Even if I concede the five or six stock cues had to go (and I don't), it would have taken a lot less time to fill the holes with Rugolo's underscore than to totally rescore.  No question this would have been a better solution, but since cutting and altering has become a reflex for CBS/Paramount, a rule instead of an exception, they probably didn't even consider it.

Since 2002, believe it or not, I have spent more than $5500 on Paramount and CBS/Paramount DVDs (most of that was 29 seasons of Star Trek).  The days of feeding them my greenbacks are over.  I have written several letters and received no response.  The disingenuous spokesperson's comment, and the suspicious positive reviews here, suggest CBS/Paramount has no plans to correct or re-issue this set.

3366744,1,B0014FAIX4,"I really did not like the concept of colorization, but at least when Ted Turner issued a colorized version he also issued a straight B&W one, often bringing some titles out for the first time and making them available. The buyer had a choice, but not so with this edition of ""The Fugitive"" TV series. No choice is possible as only this altered version of the 15 episodes with new music is on offer. I purchased it before I realized this was the case. I actually need a magnifying glass to read the disclaimer on the back as it is in as small a font as possible without disappearing from view, ""Some music has been changed for the home entertainment version."" From what I gather from CBS Video's own admission is that ""ALL"" the background music has been replaced, so this is not only almost hidden, it is not honest and would not fit into very many people's definition of ""truth in advertising."" But even more dishonest is the fact that in a much larger font and all caps and in a much more prominant place on the back cover is the statement, ""TRANSFERRED FROM THE ORIGINAL NEGATIVE WITH RESTORED AUDIO""... As I have read from another review, this is not a ""restoration"" as the audio portion should really be termed ""desecrated"" as the music is not restored at all. To restore something in my opinion is to bring it back as close to the original as possible, not re-do it almost entirely.

The only way I know to really get the attention of the marketing folk at CBS is to vote with our pocketbooks. I will not buy any future releases that have altered music such as this volume. The majority of people posting reviews here are very disturbed by this release and I would guess sales have been affected compared to the prior two volumes where the background music was in place. I have to wonder what legal difference there was between the first and second seasons to make this change necessary. I would guess that it would not be hard to resolve any issues. The point is that after lulling purchasers into expecting the original music found in the prior released volumes, which both carried the same disclaimer phrase but in larger type, there is no real warning before purchase except in forums such as this. I can read the phrase on both earlier volumes without the magnifying glass, especially the first volume where all caps have been used. I find it ironic that it can be read on the versions with the background music intact, and is barely legible on the one where all the background music has been replaced. Was this the intent, to dupe unsuspecting buyers? Whatever the case I feel defrauded.

Perhaps there is a chance that the popular opinion of fans of the series, my all-time favorite, will hold sway and we can get essentially orginal versions in the future. Reduced sales would help send the message.",1216166400,51,2812,4.566336633663366

There's no doubt that the soundtrack is much better now. You can really hear the difference in specific episodes like ""Nemesis"". There is absolutely no reason to not buy this DVD set now. I wish I can change my previous rating from 3 to 5 stars, but apparently that's not possible. From the technology, clothing, and terminology used in the episodes you can cleary tell that these stories take place in a different era, but the underlying themes and human dramas are still as relevant today as they were 40 years ago!

[Start of old review] I have the old VHS anthology series of The Fugitive (that have the Barry Morse intros) and compared its music with that on this DVD set. Sadly the familiar Fugitive cues and transitions into the various acts are all gone. The replacement music is not bad, but clearly inferior to the original. That's too bad since the video is excellent. I'm not as down as others are about the missing original score since the acting and stories are still superb, and watching them on DVD is so much better than on video tape.",1216080000,5,1207,4.56221198156682

And to take that away is lame. It's also an injustice to new,  & younger viewers watching this show for the first time, since they'll miss out on experiencing one of the KEY elements of the show's success.

In addition, as a Professional Composer, NOT hearing the classic Fugitive motif during the episodes, as well as the use of obvious samples for this new music, is ESPECIALLY annoying to me.

It's probably TOO late to hope that the same thing didn't happen with Vol. 2 of the 2nd season's episodes.

3366759,1,B0014FAIX4,"A lot of discussion has occurred on this site and other outlets about the music replacement that was done on ""The Fugitive, Season 2, Volume 1"".  If you would like to learn more about the original music artists there is an interesting web site ""David Janssen Archive"", which goes into great detail about the work of Pete Rugolo, Ken Wilhoit, and others.  The site also does a great job of providing some information on what background music should have been used on some of the episodes.  The site can be found at:

[...]

The David Janssen Archive also urges individuals to send letters to the CBS President and the VP of CBS Home Entertainment--mailing addresses are included.  The site urges individuals to write ""rationally and intelligently.""  I agree with this approach, however one can't help but feel very angry about CBS/Paramount's behavior.

I was one of those individuals who pre-ordered Season 2, on the relatively pristine product that was delivered in both installments of Season 1.  I wasn't put off by the disclaimer ""Some Music has been changed for this Home Entertainment version"".  The same disclaimer was used for Season 1, and I didn't find any glaring problems.  One also couldn't help but to be encouraged by the further statement on the Season 2 set which read ""Transferred from the original negative with restored audio"".  Everything seemed in line for an outstanding release...and then I received this bastardized version.  I was further angered by what seemed to me to be the dishonest attempt to deceive the public by how the closing credits on the shows were altered.  ""Music by Mark Heyes"", ""Additional Score by Sam Winans and Ron Komie"" made it seem that they were part of the original artistic team working on the Fugitive during the 1964-65 season.  As we now know, that was not the case.  Heyes, Winans and Komie are contemporary musicians who apparently made the ethical choice to hire themselves out to CBS/Paramount in order to perform a type of musical butchery which allowed the studios to virtually eliminate the musical contributions of the original artists--Pete Rugolo, Ken Wilhoit, and others.

CBS/Paramount has attempted to sell DVDs under the slogan ""We don't just put TV on DVD...We put TV on a Pedestal"".  Well, that is not the case with ""The Fugitive"".  If ever a show deserved the ""pedestal treatment"" it is this landmark show from the 1960s, and indeed one of the more important shows in television history.  I guess the only leverage we have is to try and continue to make our dismay known to the company through these types of postings, letter writing, etc.  The only thing corporate America seems to pay attention to (beyond low sale totals) is widespread consumer discontent and public ridicule.  Ideally, this public approach would lead CBS/Paramount to do the right thing and stop this type of egregious tampering.  If that doesn't work, then maybe those who were duped into buying this set should band together and try some sort of consumer lawsuit for false advertising/product misrepresentation.  If ever there were a legal test case to try out these issues, this would seem to be the one.",1215820800,38,3151,4.924242424242424

I was pleased to learn of the show being released on DVD and have purchased the complete Season 1 and the first half of Season 2.  Like other fans of the show, I was also disappointed that the original sound track has been altered and ask why the producers of the DVD series would do such an injustice to the original works of art and to Pete Rugolo's fine job of enhancing the mood.

The stories were well-written and the ""Fugitive"" theme music gives me chills every time I hear it! Everything from Barry Morse's Lt.

3366765,1,B0014FAIX4,"From the start the Fugitive could easily have been too depressing a show to watch.  An innocent man mercilessly hounded, forced to run for his life, ""to hide in lonely desperation.""  One big reason that it wasn't unwatchable is that Richard Kimble did have a traveling companion.  It was his theme music.  Particularly during the superior first three seasons, his theme helped form him and his world.  Along with Kimble himself, it was what remained most familiar to fans from one story to the next.  The Fugitive theme continually reminded us that this was Kimble's story, and reassured us that he would survive, as it urged him to move on.  It even added prestige to his quest.  Kimble seemed nobler because of his theme.  But Paramount/CBS has destroyed all of that in their Season Two Volume One release by stripping the original music from the body of the show.  What remains is a kind of disconnected ""vanilla"" dramatic mix that offers none of the previously existing sense of reassurance.  In part because of the condition of American society when the Fugitive was born, the show's message of hope made it much more than just a TV series for many Americans who were feeling pretty alienated and isolated at the time, and that's part of the reason Fugitive fans are taking Paramount/CBS's mutilation of our memories so personally now.  The show had also used other recurring music themes, such as that used to underscore the appearance of the police (especially Gerard), and to otherwise sensitively and effectively maximize the emotional potential of each adventure.  Not all of the music used in the show was original of course, but it all represented the choices of those who had a moral right to make those choices, and it came to be part of the memories of the fans.  The clueless reviewers and the apathetic customers who disregard the damage done by this release are paving the way for more of the same.  Future generations may believe that this release represents all that the Fugitive was. I suggest that those who would respond, ""So what?"" compare the Paramount/CBS first season releases to the second.  This new release is a demonstration of Paramount/CBS's contempt for David Janssen, Pete Rugolo, and the rest of the show's team, for those who have embraced the show for over four decades now, and for new viewers who are being deprived of an authentic Fugitive experience.  To argue that the show is good enough to survive this second season mutilation is a sad cause to champion.

3366788,2,B0014FAIX4,"I once attended a class lecture by the great film composer Jerry Goldsmith.  In the class, he showed a scene from a movie (Damnation Alley) which he had scored two separate musical versions for.  He asked us to choose which of the two versions was most appropriate.  It was rather obvious which was the better score, and he agreed.  The point is, there is music which fits and music which doesn't.  The necessity of a successful musical track is fundamental to both movies and television.  It can make or break the incredibly hard work that everyone else involved in the production contributed.  That is why finding the right composer for a project is as important as each person hired in the cast and crew.
  Pete Rugulo's score for the Fugitive is legendary. But when I started reading what Paramount had done to Season 2, I had to hear it for myself.  And I must agree whole-heartedly with those that are criticizing the changes.  It's not that the ""new"" music is bad.  It's just not appropriate.  To those of us who grew up as Fugitive junkies, it's just too weird.  Our familiarity with the original music legitimizes our contention that the score has been ""dumbed down"" to an unacceptable level.
What made the original score so compelling was hearing the main theme refrained throughout the show.  The music was scored to convey the plight of Richard Kimble.  And (as all good scores do), it blended with the action in such a way that you were almost unaware of it and how it was affecting your responses.  But that is no longer the case.
This ""new"" score is so blatant, it was hard to enjoy the action (which I've grown to love so much).  Of course the action and the acting is great.  Of course the writing is second to none.  Of course all the cast and crew gave us one of the best shows ever televised.
And now that we all have the opportunity to finally own the series on DVD, it's not the same show anymore. Paramount has succeeded in making the show lackluster, by depriving it of its necessary entirety.  It's as if you were given your favorite dish, minus one of its best ingredients.  The ""chefs"" at Paramount have served us a familiar meal, but it tastes and smells different.  It may be palatable for some, but for us Fugitive gourmets, it's very hard to swallow.
Was this a legal problem?  The music in Season One is exactly the way it should be.  Why change the body of the score and leave the theme intact?
It is certainly a difficult decision for buyers who crave a complete collection of The Fugitive, but who will end up with much less than they anticipated.
I can only recommend this DVD on what is left for us.  The sound and picture quality is fine.  But this ""new"" score is mixed too loudly and has no soul.  It diminishes the greatest TV show of the 1960s.  One can only hope that the rest of the series will be restored to its original luster.
Otherwise, all we have left is a phantom...someone's version of a show that was completed decades ago, and has now undergone some strange surgery by a bunch of quacks.",1215043200,37,3041,4.4781818181818185
3366789,5,B0014FAIX4,"I had received promptly THE FUGITIVE - Season Two - Volume 1 from Amazon.com. I will look forward (perhaps rather impatiently) for the next collection which is Volume 2. There may be a change in the style of presenting each espisode - beginning and the end parts.
Well...as fans, we have no control whatsoever over the way the producers do it as it is their perogative. Fussing over the matter and keeping on complain would not help. Best thing is that those who are not satisfied should write to the producers so that they might rectify the issue and resolve the matter. Threats will not change things but diplomacy and tact would...!  As far as I am concerned , as a fan of The Fugitive, it makes not one iota of difference so long as the contents of each episode remains untouched  and unedited and preserved the same  way it was presented originally.

The fact is, a good percentage of the Fugitive music WAS LEGALLY AVAILABLE for this project - the music from the CBS Library.  Trouble was, the studio was too lazy to determine which musical cues came from the CBS Library.  The cues they couldn't legally use easily could have been substituted with appropriate Pete Rugolo music used elsewhere in the series.  There are people out there - I know these people - who are intimately familiar with TV music from this era, who could tell you within SECONDS which pieces came from which library.  They easily could have been tapped for the project - probably for cheaper than what they paid the hack who did the new score.  The studio took the lazy, inefficient and artistically wrong path.  If the studio expects people to shell out money for these discs, they should do a better job.  This is a travesty.",1214956800,6,914,4.633540372670807
3366792,1,B0014FAIX4,"I grew up loving the ABC series, The Fugitive, so when CBS released it, I was quite happy. True, the greedy company decided to release each season of the show in two parts, but I swallowed my pride and purchased both volumes of the first season and waited in anticipation for the release of the second. I was in for a huge disappointment.
  Upon viewing the second season volume one, I discovered to my horror that CBS had removed all the wonderful music from the show and replaced it with garbage music. No more Pete Rugolo with supplemental music from Jerry Goldsmith and Bernard Herrmann. Instead we get nothing better than elevator music. My experience watching this disc was thus ruined.
  Now I understand why music could be altered for DVD release. There could be copyright or labor union problems, but this does not excuse the deceptive way CBS informed the consumer of the music modification. They did so on the back of the case in letters so small that only Superman could read them. Normally, if there is some kind of modification, it should be indicated in letters large enough for people to see so that they can be more informed about what is inside.
  CBS apparently has little respect for the consumer and instead hoped that we would buy the tainted disc and never realize a change had been made.
  If you are looking for a great Fugitive experience, you will not find it on this disc, especially if you believed that the music was just as important to this series as the stories and images were.
  For myself, I will not buy anything from CBS video, especially the Fugitive series until they indicate that their future releases will be uncut and unmodified.",1214956800,27,1673,4.640677966101695

The music is 30-40% of this show as it sets the dramatic tone for each scene and act.  It is like stripping the guts out of someone.  I will not buy any more sets in this series if they neglect the music.  The show has been off the air for 41 years; why would they have a problem with music clearance?  How could they present the 1st season (both DVD's) with the music and then all of a sudden drop it?  They think they are doing us a favor by releasing these at all; they have done us a grave disservice.  Why were the VHS copies distributed with the original music and now they pull it?  Stay away.  Stay away in droves and maybe they will get the message.,1214784000,24,775,4.140939597315437
3366807,1,B0014FAIX4,"I don't like the removal of the music anymore than the rest of you. I've loved this series for years and the new music just sounds wrong. But come on, every single person who doesn't mind the change HAS to be from Paramount? Only a company employee would like it? That's crazy, this is not a religion it's a TV series. I know it's upsetting and alters the original artist's vision, but CBS probably didn't think it was a big deal. It was a business move that backfired. It sucks, but let's get a grip. There's a reason why CBS / Paramount took this chance, if you wanna hear it.

Fact of life: a lot of people (not die hard fans) just don't care about the background music. To them, TV and film scores are just there and hardly even count as music. ""Dude, where are the words?"" ""This just instrumental?"" ""Oh, this is like that boring classical music."" I'm not one of these people, I love film and TV scores and don't listen to much else. I know how important the proper underscore is to a film. But we are in the minority. Oh, not on Amazon, but only die hard fans would care enough to make these posts. And, yes, I realize die hard fans are the DVDs bread and butter, so when a company does this, they will lose a lot of revenue.

But, my point is, not everyone will be upset by this. People who don't notice the music or think it's important to the show just don't mind the change. Again, I'm not talking about the fans who've watched the show for decades and memorized the music and bought the CD. These are people who love the stories, enjoy the acting and direction. The people who fast forward through the credits. And, believe it or not, THOSE are the majority of actual TV viewers today. Which is why we don't have shows with opening and closing credits like we used to.

Just because someone posts a positive review does not make them employees or affiliates of Paramount. That's Para-noid. Lighten up on the consumers, they didn't do this.

Anyway, the prints LOOK great and that's the one star this set gets. As an old school fan, I can't help but notice the altered music and how the new music sounds woefully modern, synthesized and out of date. I would rather have paid $20 more per set to get the series as it was originally aired.

This sets a bad precedent and the reaction from fans will get CBS / Paramount to do one of three things:

1. Pay the licenses and go back and fix it
2. Pay the licenses and have future sets come out unscathed
3. Cut their losses and forget releasing any more sets.

I get a bad feeling that option #3 will be the choice. This is why you don't see new releases of WKRP from Fox. Glad I still have my ""taped from 1991"" VHS cassettes, I guess...

If you never saw the show before, or don't care about the music, then go ahead and buy the series. At least the show will be getting more fans. For everyone else, don't waste yer money.",1214697600,23,2877,4.275735294117647

Few classic TV series are as well respected as ""The Fugitive."" It was well acted, well written and beautifully scored -- although you wouldn't know about the latter if you've looked at this latest CBS/Paramount DVD release.

Some genius at CBS/Paramount decided to redo the entire underscore in each of the included episodes. Its replacement is a hasty hack job, synthesized and out of place.

CBS/Paramount issued a rather lame statement saying they didn't want to hold up the release by mining out all the unlicensed music. Call me crazy, but I would have gladly waited -- or else paid a little extra for uncut episodes. I also do not understand how CBS/Paramount does not own the musical rights to the CBS Music Library.

The strange thing about this is that CBS/Paramount has a great history with its DVD releases. ""The Twilight Zone"" was given the red carpet treatment for all of its 5-season releases. Such a fine program deserved it. So does ""The Fugitive.""

What a testament to the quality of this program that, despite this unpardonable sin, the show is still engaging, still able to hook the viewer with its taut pace and gentle humanism.

What these big production studios don't realize is that loyal fans are perfectly willing to pay a little more for the complete show, how it originally aired. I've seen this done a million times with other DVD sets. Take ""The Greatest American Hero"" for example, where a song called ""Eve of Destruction"", which is actually crucial to the plot of the episode, (and is actually mentioned by name 5 or 6 times by William Katt in the episode) is cut out for some muzak garbage, just because the studio didn't want to pay for the rights to use the song.

All the other ingredients that made this show great are still there in abundance.  Furthermore, I think the replacement music is quite functionally adequate.  I can understand the upset of purists who remember the show from its original airing.  However, CBS media may not have made this change capriciously or stupidly.  The rights to the music used in these episodes may be under different ownership or contract and the owner may be making ridiculous demands (can you say extortion?) of payment for useage.  I'm not trying to play devil's advocate, it's just that I've seen similar cases involving CD releases of old popular music albums where there are ownership disputes over cover art(see Moby Grape, for instance).  Even at 47, I'm too young to remember much about the show, so to me, nothing is missing and I would not wish to wait for the conclusion of a greed-fueled game of licensing tug-of-war for these sets to come out.  That being said, I am ticked off about episode 3 on disc three (Cry Uncle).  Unless my disc has a unique manufactured flaw, the transcription was made from damaged source material.  If such is the case this could have and should have been rectified before this production was transfered to disc.  Has anyone else experienced this problem?",1214352000,4,1431,4.847736625514403

I do not for a minute believe CBS/P released these adulterated discs just to get them more quickly into the hands of fans who would otherwise be disappointed by delay. No doubt the truth is they made a corporate decision to keep up the cash flow from the release of Season One without delay.

Defacing art is never justified. True curators who value art restore it as best they can to the original, to keep the artistic elements intact but perhaps remove age damage to make it more visible or audible. But they keep all elements of the original. They do not redo it, erase it, overdub it, change its color, splice new scenes, remove scenes, or change its sound, including the musical score. When Orson Welles was on his death bed Ted Turner was busy ""colorizing"" black and white classic films from the past.  Welles told a friend, ""Keep Ted Turner and his crayons away from my films.""

I will not purchase abridgements or adulterations of any type because it is a slap in the face of the artists who created the works. So I join the chorus, fearing that CBS might replace that, too, if it has the chance. And a real shame as I was busy applauding CBS/P for getting these released in such perfect form. If you want to do it right and add to the price, I will buy it.

3366829,2,B0014FAIX4,"Okay, I've given this set a 2-star rating instead of a 5-star rating solely because of the missing episode music.  I'd toyed with a 3-star rating, but after watching the first 2nd-Season show ""Man In A Chariot"" with the new music and the same show (dubbed from a video tape) with the original music back-to-back, I concluded that a 2-star score was more appropriate.

THE GOOD:  David Janssen, Barry Morse, William Conrad, et al., and the teleplays!  And I should also mention the beautiful video quality!!

THE BAD:  The new music scores!  Look, a couple of times the new music is comparable to the original music; but overall it is clearly inferior to the original score for that episode (and sometimes the new music even sounded downright out-of-place).  Perhaps what was most disturbing about this ""new score"" was the fact that they totally deleted and replaced the music notes that are the trademark for The Fugitive - in other words, the haunting notes that played many times when something sad or dramatic or just interesting was happening to The Fugitive (i.e., the characteristic theme for the David Janssen character, Richard Kimble).  Yes, believe it or not, you heard me right:  Except for the opening and closing theme music, throughout the entire episode, the trademark ""Fugitive"" notes have been deleted and replaced!  (DELETE THE MUSIC NOTES THAT ARE THE TRADEMARK FOR THE RICHARD KIMBLE CHARACTER? THE MIND BOGGLES!!  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING WHEN THEY DID THIS??? WELL, I GUESS THEY WEREN'T THINKING AT ALL!!!)

WHY did they do this?  Well, according to info on the website of [...] the excuse that CBS/Paramount has given is that there were many new ""music cues"" in the 2nd Season that they couldn't identify the owners of, so they just decided to do a completely new score for the episodes.  (Again, they've kept only the opening and closing theme music.)  And they replaced ALL the music insteading of keeping some of it (such as the trademark notes for The Fugitive) on the lame theory (pretext to cut costs??) that it would give viewers a ""more seamless"" viewing experience(!).

We'll I bought it in ignorance and it's worth 2 stars because it's better than NOTHING - but this really does need to be fixed by CBS/PARAMOUNT!  (And anymore new music they have for Fugitive episodes needs to be erased before they use it in future Fugitive DVD sets!)

THE UGLY:  Okay, here's what I'd call The Ugly about what they've done...it's one last insult to both creators and fans of this classic TV show - THE GUYS WHO DID THE NEW UNDERSCORE FOR ""MAN IN A CHARIOT"" HAVE BEEN GIVEN CREDIT IN THE FINAL CREDITS AT THE END OF THE SHOW - IN FACT, THEIR NAMES HAVE EVEN BEEN PLACED ABOVE PETE RUGOLO'S!!

SO NOW, FUGITIVE FANS, you've heard The Good, The Bad & The Ugly about The Fugitive, Season 2, Vol. 1, and if you ask me there's a whole lot more of The Bad and The Ugly than there is The Good about what CBS/Paramount has done to to hack up the first half of Season 2 of the best dramatic TV series of the 1960s!!

Yes, David Janssen's amazing performance is the best thing about the show.  But as great as Janssen and Barry Morse were, the music made the show all the greater.  I can still recall as a youngster the chill I would feel when Gerard's appearances were introduced by the menacing theme that was used.  And I'll never forget the rush of excitement at the pulse-pounding cue that accompanied many of the show's most thrilling moments, such as when Kimble searches for the one-armed man at the bus terminal.  And now I'm hearing that they have cut/replaced ""Just One Road I Travel"", the poignant tune from ""Ballad for a Ghost""?  The tune that was composed by the episode's writer, George Eckstein??

This perception by corporate ""suits"" that the purchasing public is made up of morons who will buy anything that is put before them must be ground to a halt before it becomes the norm, rather than the exception.  ""The Fugitive"" is a landmark show, a ground breaking series that inspired numerous imitations and a major motion picture.  It's a pivotal program in series television history.

There remains in Hollywood a blithe ignorance of the importance of music in both movies and television.  This self righteous sense of superiority has proliferated corporate corridors at all of the major studios since sound first uttered a breath.  Symphonic scoring for motion pictures provided much of the most memorable music of the twentieth century, producing such giants of screen and concert composition as Miklos Rozsa, Bernard Herrmann, Alfred Newman, Franz Waxman, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Dimitri Tiomkin, Victor Young, Hugo Friedhofer, Elmer Bernstein, Jerry Goldsmith, and John Williams.  Such snobbery cannot be tolerated.

Pete Rugolo's haunting accompaniment to Richard Kimble's lonely flight from incarceration and execution is both Emmy winning, and unforgettable.  It is as much an integral part of ""The Fugitive"" series as its star.  Why not replace David Janssen with Kevin Federline?  That will save Paramount even more money.  This is sheer butchery, and it must be stopped by boycotting a series I deeply love and admire.  I, for one, will no longer support this cruel castration with my hard earned money.  Until the brain trust at Paramount wakes up to the fact that we are not supid, or insensitive to their arrogance and penny pinching, I will purchase no further episodes of either ""The Fugitive"" or any of their other products that have been tampered with.

Licensing of popular songs is one thing... but to go back and re-score an entire television series forty years later without any credit to the original composers nor consumer notice prior to purchasing is utterly despicable and I would urge anyone who has bought a copy of this set to send it right back and demand that the studios take responsibility and make amends for butchering this classic series! Every dollar spent restoring these episodes have been completely wasted by what the DVD producers have done to these episodes.

3366854,2,B0014FAIX4,"Unaware of the music issues at the time of ordering, I DID buy this set, simply for the brilliant acting chops of David Janssen and I will say from the point of quality teleplays, writing, directing and the magnificent performances by Janssen and accompanying guest stars, the video content is simply superb!  Watching this set has been a guilty pleasure but I feel as if I crossed a picket line of a cause I truly believe in.

BUT, good people, the entertainment industry is in a true crisis with the issues of music rights, the DMCA of 1998, digital rights management of intellectual property, and so on and so forth.  Associates of all professions of recorded entertainment MUST come together, NOW, and that includes the greedy suits at ALL the major & minor studios.

IMHO, you do NOT alter the history of music and film by alteration & substitution, pan and scan, the dreaded practice of colorization and releasing music and especially films with grainy reproductions filled with dirt, trash and other distracting artifacts.

Seeing this volume of ""The Fugitive"" released in such an irresponsible manner is just inexcusable!  The act of substitution of original music indefensible by CBS!

I'm not going to buy some clownish, artificial substitute for my good memories because corporate honchos think they can put one over on the dummies out there. David Janssen deserved better.

Strike 3 was the wreck they made of ""Ballad For a Ghost"".  The song previously sung by Janis Paige was removed and something innocuous put in its place.  This required them to edit the show to remove the closeups of Janis as she sang.  The song became background for the other characters.  The singer was left out.
Fortunately, like other reviewers, I still have my own VHS tapes.  I'll live with the A&E logo on the bottom of the screen rather than watch these shows again on DVD.

3366868,3,B0014FAIX4,"I hesitated to watch any of this set after reading so many negative comments, but finally decided to view a few episodes to form my own opinion. It seems many of the reviews here have been made by people who have not even sampled the product.

I have only watched the first five episodes so far, and, while the rescoring is disappointing, it is not as bad as some would have you believe. The music is a bit loud at times, especially at the beginning of acts, but overall is not a bad effort. Admittedly, I have not seen these episodes in years, and do not have any tapes or previous copies, so I do not have the original score memorized. That said, compared to the excellent job on the first season, the new score is obviously inferior, but the superb writing and acting still offer some value in owning this set.

The real question is why such changes had to be made in the first place. I am most troubled by the fact that such drastic changes were not disclosed more fully. While I can accept that certain legal matters may require changes to the score, I wonder why these same problems did not surface prior to the release of season one.  Customers expected the second season to be of similar quality.

I can enjoy what this season two set offers, but unless the studio can solve whatever problems are involved, or, at the very least, come clean with what issues prevent including the original score, I will probably pass on any future releases.

EDIT:  It seems that the studio has agreed to replace the rescored season two release.  This is great news.  While some of the ""new"" music may remain, it seems the majority of the original score will be restored.

When it first came out, I was too young to stay up and see it for the first 2 years. I could only see the intro and than had to go to bed. At the young age of 9, I knew it was a good show! Than, the last 2 years of its run I got to stay up and see it and they were also showing repeats in the day time! After it ended its run of 4 years in 1967 I did not see it for another 23 years until 1990 on A and E
As I had to work when it was on, I timer recorded all 120 shows and got my first wife hooked on it!
Than, 15 years later it comes out at last on DVD and Season one was such great fun to see and introduce to my second wife and others!
So, I know its a great show and was looking forward to more great stories, great guest stars, more great acting by David Janssen and more of that great music score after June 10th 2008 when it was to come out!
Just for the fun of it I took a look at the reviews for the first half of season 2 planning on buying it within a day or two. Well, I have to say I got very upset from what I learned from all of these reviews on what these Knuckle heads did to it by replacing the music score! What are they smoking? To me it would be like replacing all the James Bond music scores! That would go over like a fart in church! I am trying to find out how to contact this awful company and make a strong loud protest! I tried calling the tv station in my town that is with CBS but they had no info! I tried calling directory help with the phone company and got nowhere! I will keep trying! Everyone should bug the hell out of them! Also, We should suggest Amazon have a talk with them on this !
 There are other ways than the so called offical set to get more Fugtives the right way. Just do a google search and even on Amazon if you look there is another company! One has to be careful who they go thru, but its worth a try!

Even though I obviously wouldn't miss the classic background music like loyal Fugitive devotees, I still cannot condone such a bastardization. I will change my mind if Paramount is able to go back and re-score all of Season 2, but otherise - FORGET IT.

Paramount, if you think you'll do okay with sales base don naive people, don't be so sure.

The absence of Rugolo's score hurts this set.  No argument there.  The music substituted was described by one reviewer here as ""elevator music"" -- that description is far too kind; better no score at all than what was inserted to replace Rugolo's.

But The Fugitive was outstanding primarily because of the writing and the performances, and those are intact here.  What really made The Fugitive memorable is present in this set.

And, to top it all off, synthesizers weren't even around when this series was produced! I doubt that Paramount will spend the money now to put the original score back on new DVD's and exchange the sets or give us all refunds. But I'm sure going to wait until after ""Season Two Part Two"" is released and check the reviews to see if the original music has been restored before I order any more ""Fugitive"" DVD's. We want the original ""Fugitive"" or else what's the point! So, Paramount, what do you plan to do to resolve this debacle?",1213142400,22,887,4.584905660377358
3366923,4,B0014FAIX4,"This is a revised review. CBS has heard the complaints of the fans over having Peter Rugolo's music replaced. They are now issuing replacement discs for the travesty that was Fugitive Season 2, Vol. 1. See here for details: [...].

The new discs restore MOST of the Rugolo music that was replaced, and also many of the CBS library cues (e.g., from The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits). If you are happy with the new discs, I urge you to delete your original review and submit a new one - that appears to be the only way to change your star rating.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

After the first two excellent volumes in the series, I preordered the third volume of The Fugitive. Well, that was a mistake! As others have said, the music has been replaced. And not just the songs that might be heard on TVs or radios in the show - the actual incidental music that plays throughout the show (composed by Peter Rugolo). No more haunting Fugitive theme. It was always such an integral part of the show. How could you replace it? There shouldn't have been any rights issues. The composer should have signed away any rights at the time of creation, so I don't know what the explanation is. Royalties, maybe? Whatever it is, it's not acceptable. It's quite ridiculous.

I should have known it was too good to be true that we could actually get the entire series on DVD. I don't even care about extras - I just want the original series as it was meant to be seen. Is that too much to ask? Paramount, you've already done it twice, why mess it up now?

Very sad.",1213142400,,1542,4.396491228070175
3366924,1,B0014FAIX4,"The music replacements aren't as bad as you've heard from the other reviews.

They're worse.

You don't even have to be familiar with ""The Fugitive"" to know that something is horribly wrong as soon as you start listening beyond the opening credits.  (Actually, before that -- since the music replacements start during each episode's pre-credits teaser, which for this season is simply a repeat of a scene that occurs within the episode itself.)

Absolutely nothing distinguishes this new music, other than its bombast and blandness.  You can tell the composer was trying for a '60s dramatic TV show flavor.  Didn't work, to put it mildly.

It's interesting that a reviewer below used the word ""abomination"" for this hack job.  That's exactly what it is -- and it harks back to Vestron Video's botched 1984 VHS release of ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes,"" where they replaced a lot of the original music.  THAT movie eventually got released with the right score -- took just 17 years, when MGM/UA issued the the DVD in 2001.

We can't wait 17 years for ""The Fugitive"" to have the original music.  Please: Do not buy this, and demand that Paramount get it right.",1213142400,27,1155,4.812182741116751
3366925,1,B0014FAIX4,"As a caveat, I haven't received my copy yet, but it has been shipped and may yet be returned.  I'm disheartened to learn of this alteration to the Fugitive's scoring as the original music is crucial to the appreciation of this series.  If Paramount needs to pay the composer's estate more money to obtain rebroadcast music rights, then so be it.

I buy classic series to see them intact, with all of the unedited memories and nostalgia associated with the original broadcast; that includes the music.  If the reviews I'm reading are accurate, and I have no reason to doubt the consensus, then what has been done here is truly a crime.

One can always hold out the hope that the real criminal behind this act will have a conscience, correct the error and try to appease those of us victimized by this injustice before this favorite series meets it executioner.",1213142400,19,859,4.662251655629139
3366936,4,B0014FAIX4,"I got my DVD today and, based upon the reviews stating how the original soundtrack had been replaced, I was afraid that the series would be spoiled for me. I was wrong. The acting and screenwriting are so strong that I was able, for the most part, to overlook the disppointment with the tampered soundtrack. Yes, I would prefer that Pete Rugulo's background music had been retained. And I absolutely hate the way that our overly-legalized and fearful society prevented this DVD from being released intact. But the engrossing stories and poweful acting still make this TV series a pleasure to watch, even as presented on this adulterated Season Two video. Normally, I would rate this DVD a five-star. But, because of the altered soundtrack, I am downgrading it to a four-star. The encouraging thing is that, even with tampering, this brilliant TV series can hold its own against anything being produced on TV today.",1213142400,6,914,4.903225806451613

I just received my Replacement Discs for THE FUGITIVE S2V1.

Unhappily, I noted many instances where the original music has been replaced.  The replacement music is nowhere near as good as the original.

These replacement discs are NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

CBS/Paramount's lawyers are OVERCAUTIOUS.  They're replacing music right and left.  This is a recipe for disaster, because this alienates their core group of customers.

It's time for CBS/Paramount to make a decision.  Do they want to make their lawyers happy or their customers happy?  They can't have it both ways.

CBS, either replace all of the music in The Fugitive, or else stop screwing around with the music and give us the original shows!  MAKE A DECISION !!",1213142400,3,745,4.919354838709677

It's true, the music is not the original music, and is not any of the Twilight Zone stock music either.  It is some other incidental music that sounds newly written and recorded, and is of very mediocre quality.  It is not worthy of this very fine show and does indeed detract from the essence of the production.

Some people unfamiliar with the show may wonder what the big deal is?  In a show like this, the music set a very high standard and was perfectly suited to the atmosphere and action on the screen.  To replace it with the insipid and vulgar tripe found on this DVD is an insult to the creative minds behind the show, and an insult to its viewers as well.  It doesn't completely ruin the show, but it comes close.  I've already written to Paramount and complained--not that they'll listen.  Maybe they'll listen if more people write and we stop buying what they're selling.  Based on this DVD, I've given up all hope of looking forward to future releases.  They won't get another dime from me if they can't take the effort to do it right.  I'd rather wait for it to show up in reruns.",1213056000,27,1259,4.402597402597403

I was unhappy about period songs being removed from Tour Of Duty, but at least I understood the economics of it. Does anyone have a phone number/e-mail address where we can contact Paramount to complain? I won't be buying any future sets unless this is corrected - and we're talking about my favorite show of all time! At least I have my VHS tapes.",1213056000,26,682,4.598360655737705
3366941,4,B0014FAIX4,"[Addendum added below]

Back in June of 2008, when this set was first issued, CBS/Paramount had replaced all of the original underscore with newly commissioned music.  It ripped the heart and soul out of the show and its fans.  But CBS/Paramount wisely listened to its fans, through letters to the company, from online reviews at places like this, and Internet chat forums where the subject was discussed at great length.

In February of 2009, CBS/Paramount announced and instituted a program whereby purchasers of this set could send in their proofs of purchase and receive a revised set with nearly all of the original music restored.  Early returns are in among fans, and overwhelmingly this set is now back to where it should be, given the limitations of some ""minor"" music replacements.

Music replacement is a reality in this litigious society, so if it has to be done, then CBS/Paramount has done its homework and given us an acceptable Season Two Volume One set for THE FUGITIVE.  The vast majority of Peter Rugolo's magnificent music cues are back, as are most of the CBS library cues that originated with shows like THE TWILIGHT ZONE and GUNSMOKE.  There are minor instances of some apparently troublesome cues now replaced with fairly innocuous newer cues.  The important thing is that the soul of the show (the music) has largely been returned.

As Amazon doesn't allow revised ratings in edited reviews, unfortunately, the star rating system for this release will tend to skew lower than it should.  I'm unable to change my initial one-star review to anything higher, but if I could, I'd raise it to four-and-a-half.

The video, as is customary from CBS/Paramount is exceptional, and the series has never looked so good.  The black-and-white imagery is sharp and clear, with great shadow detail.  The original mono sound quality is also good with clear, understandable dialog, and now with the corrected music, is no longer much of an issue.

While there are no extras with these FUGITIVE sets thus far, it's not a critical factor.  This series doesn't NEED extras - the show itself is good enough to sustain anyone's interest and holds up well to repeated viewings.

For reference, it took about two weeks from mailing in the proofs of purchase to my receiving the corrected set.  By the way, you get a full and complete second set - complete with artwork, improved keep case, and printed inserts, which are now readable on the inside without removing discs!

CBS/Paramount has taken our issue to heart and made good on their promise to put classic TV on a pedestal.  Support their efforts with your purchases of this exceptional series on DVD.

[Addendum, several years later.  I'm learning that new orders of THE FUGITIVE, Season 2, Volume 1, are still being shipped with the totally replaced music.  If indeed THAT is the case, then this set should be avoided at all costs.  CBS/Paramount did the right thing in re-issuing the set with largely corrected music, but, if this is true, have dropped the ball again by foisting the replaced-scores-by-Heyes upon an unsuspecting public.  Unfortunately I know of no way to tell in advance whether you'd get a set with bad music or good music, but buyer beware.  The exchange program is long gone, as far as I know.]",1213056000,133,3275,4.877034358047016

No light Fugitive theme in the back ground and no Lt. Gerard theme when he comes on the screen. To me, this SUCKS! One of the best things of The Fugitive is the back ground music and how it ""fills"" the episode with Fugitive quaility! I have no idea why Paramount changed the back ground music! There is no reason sinced it is actually music made for the show. I guess when they said restored audio they should have said tampered with audio. I think Paramount has done this show and the fans a great injustice. They should go back and re-do the DVD's on this set and put the origianl music that was made for the show back in and offer us all replacements!

3366943,4,B0014FAIX4,"I see the date of my original review remains.  I have retained its text at the bottom.

February 21, 2009 (update)

First a grateful high-five to CBS/Paramount for listening to consumers, taking the time and going to the expense to largely correct and re-issue the set. Watching the episodes felt like I was watching The Fugitive again. What makes this show special for me--the forlorn feeling of Kimble, alone, stirred by Rugolo--has been fundamentally restored. I believe most fans will be pleased, and I encourage those who hesitated to buy the set because of bad press to consider picking it up and giving the exchange program a chance.

We were told ""much of the music"" had been put back. This is true for the ten episodes I sampled.  Sadly, however, some, if not all, of the CBS and Capitol cues are gone.  And it stings (although there may be some remaining in areas I haven't checked).

Here are a few specifics.

In ""Man in a Chariot,"" the bulk of the cue from Begley's closing summation has been removed and for most of that great oration we hear only silence beneath him. I'd prefer the Goldsmith cut, yet given the choice, silence works better than Heyes.

In ""Man on a String,"" the identical cue was also expunged. Here Heyes blares over a nervous Kimble in court. Even so, good judgment prevailed, at least in terms of spotting; leaving silence for Begley while potting up replacement music when the drama demands it demonstrates discrimination by the restoration team. The thoughtfulness so desperately needed in the original release is, at least, attempted here. On the downside, portions of the synthesized underscore remain hot, erupting all too pristinely between vintage Rugolo.

In ""Escape Into Black,"" original strains are with us when Kimble is on the train at the end, but when it derails, Goldsmith derails with it and Heyes is screaming on the tracks.

Still, watching ""Tug of War"" made me forget I was viewing a replacement disc; I stopped thinking about all the months of frustration and anguish. I was simply enjoying an episode of The Fugitive, an old friend I'd seen dozens of times and will always love seeing again. Gradually the betrayal, the anger I felt at CBS/Paramount, started to wane.

Of course I wanted every original element returned where it belongs. As a purist who cringed when background music on a jukebox was changed in season one, it's hard for me to swallow my standards, but I would rather return the goodwill the studio has shown in restoring what they can, and see this series head for the finish line, so my children and their children will someday see these beautiful transfers, even if they are only singing at eighty percent.  It's too great a show for me to be stubborn and dwell on the tinge of disappointment I admit I still feel when confronting the reality that my beloved Twilight Zone cuts may not all be there.

But I believe the big picture is, for now, more important than pining for missing cues, especially when I think back to what I believed not so long ago--that the show's legitimate life on DVD was over.  Done.  Dead.

Now it has a chance.  I'm choosing to view kicking out for the rest of the series like buying a starter house.  Sure--maybe I won't live in it forever.  Maybe I don't like everything about the house.  Some things downright bug me about it.  But the equity I accrue is undeniable, and when I do finally sell the house, my equity allows me to get a bigger house, maybe even the one of my dreams.

I have the same hope for The Fugitive.  If we can all come together, support the release--imperfect though it is--and get this run out, then who knows what the future holds for the rights issues.  Meantime the series, in a more or less respectable form, will be in circulation.  To me the odds seem better right now that some day every missing element can be corrected than the odds seemed a week ago to expect Paramount to suddenly announce that not only would they mail me a free set, but a set with much of the music restored.  It's still amazing when I think about it.

The going may get tough when we come to stock-filled episodes like ""Landscape with Running Figures.""  But Kimble never lost faith.  He kept running even when it looked hopeless.  I, for one, don't think it looks hopeless anymore.  I'm ready to dig in my wallet and keep running with the good doctor, hurtling over Heyes if necessary, through season two and beyond.

I hope all true Fugitive fans do the same.

(Original review)

I'm not going to rant and rave, I'll just say that with the exception of the opening and closing title, every piece of music in all the episodes on disc one has been altered (I don't have the heart to check the other discs right now). This is hardly The Fugitive without the great music. I know I am in the minority and others may think it makes little difference, but to me the music is half the show. It's too painful to watch, so I'm giving my set away and not buying any future sets where ALL of the music has been replaced.

I didn't complain too much when non-instrumental music in season one had been changed--music on juke boxes, etc., because that music was not composed for the show. They REMOVED ALL the music composed for the show. I could understand if they even replaced the stock music (cues heard in other shows like The Twilight Zone, etc.), but they REMOVED ALL OF MUSIC COMPOSED FOR THE SHOW except the opening and closing titles. What the....?

I still can't believe it. I've waited for years for this show to come out on DVD. I am tremendously sad and disappointed. I sat there in front of the TV and couldn't believe what I was hearing.

Why would Paramount/CBS do this? I can understand them not wanting to deal with clearance issues for a series that will probably sell modestly. But how can it be a clearance issue when it's ALL the music composed specifically for the show? The only thing I can think of is that they didn't want to bother figuring out what was stock and what wasn't, so they replaced it all (added comment--this turned out to be right!)

In any case, I believe people should be made aware that ALL of music has been changed.

To me, it would be like watching the original Star Trek series without the music. What would be the point?

I still can't believe it. Part of me thinks if I go to bed and wake up in the morning and put the DVD back in, it will all have been a bad dream.",1212969600,3,6415,4.524263431542461
3366944,5,B0014FAIX4,"As a young teenager, I was introduced to Dr. Richard Kimble by my older brother, who came home one night and told the family gathered around the television watching ""The Garry Moore Show"" that we just had to switch channels and watch ""The Fugitive.""  I was hooked from Day 1.  David Janssen graced the covers of a lot of show business magazines in those days, and reviews of the show in TV Guide got me reading ""Les Miserables"" (who was Javert? who was Jean Valjean? what about the 'noir' look of the series as compared to the underground sewers in Paris?).

3366945,5,B0014FAIX4,"Every once in a while a movie, or in this case a TV series captures the hearts and minds of those lucky enough to find it.  ""The Fugitive"" was just such a series.  Why??  First is the show's basic premise.  Dr. Kimble, a good man, is wrongly accused of killing his wife.  He is indicted, placed on trial, and a jury of his ""peers"" quickly finds him guilty of her homicide.  Later, as a police lieutenant, named Gerard, escorts him in handcuffs to a state penitentiary to be executed by the state for his ""crime"", fate steps in and the train they are riding suddenly, and with warning, derails.  The handcuffs that restrain him are broken by the force of the crash.  Suddenly.... Kimble finds himself a free man - the police lieutenant is nowhere to be found.  The train crew is much too busy trying to recover their own wits and attend to the medical needs of the injured and dealing with the dead to worry about this one escaped fugitive.
Dr. Kimble spends the subsequent weeks, months and yes.... years trying to prove he didn't kill his wife.  His only chance is to find that stranger he saw leaving his neighbohood, a one-armed man who he believes broke into his home to commit burglary, only to kill the woman who became a tragic witness to his crime.  She saw too much - she could identify him.  She had to die - period!
Each week, our intrepid hero scoures obscure towns and villages, hoping and praying to cross paths with his quarry and force him to answer for his wife's murder. That was just one problem to solve.  Keeping one step ahead of the dedicated, perhaps even obsessed clutches of Gerard would prove to be even more difficult - especially since he knew Gerard would never believe his story.  Kimble was found guilty.... he had to pay for his ""crime""  Lieutenant Gerard considers Dr. Kimble's miraculous escape to be the one stain on his record that will not, no... MUST not be allowed to ""just go away"".  Even his supervisor, Captain Carpenter, thinks Gerard has lost all sense of reason or perspective.  The lieutenant's efforts to recapture Kimble are akin to events found in Victor Hugo's Les Miserable.
In traveling from town to town, Kimble assumes the identity of many, many occupations to elude detection or even suspicion.  Migrant worker, bartender, fishing net maker and so on.  He meets many people in his travels.  This allows us to see many newcomers to the acting industry, such as Robert Duvall, Susan Oliver, Vera Miles, Brian Keith and many (really) others to hone their young crafts.
Like millions of other people in this country, my late father loved this show.  I'm sure, on some level, he and these others really identified with Dr. Kimble's sense of loneliness.  David Janssen was an actor with considerable skills.  He had many acting credits during his career, but Dr. Kimble was made for him - no question about it.
If you haven't had a chance to see this series.... if you want to see quality television.... run, like a fugitive, and get this series on DVD.
Whoever it was that claimed that television was a vast wasteland obviously never saw this series.  I can only hope they eventually put every episode on DVD.

RIGHT!
So.

Hey!  Thanks a lot, QM Productions!
We find out NOW that his wife's name was Helen!
We find out NOW that his son was stillborn!
We find out NOW that his wife had started drinking!
We find out NOW that they had started having arguments about adoption!

What on earth was the matter with you lot at Q M Productions?
Well, nothing. Nothing at all!
They did a great job with this! The true fact being that this Pilot Episode went missing!
There are two crucial points here.
a)  Q M Productions were not aware that this Episode was never included in the Series after they sold it.
b)  CBS Paramount  were never aware that it ever existed in the first place.
Both companies.
NOT GUILTY.
