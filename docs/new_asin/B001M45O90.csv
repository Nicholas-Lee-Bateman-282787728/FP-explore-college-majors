3692217,5,B001M45O90,This movie arrived in a timely manner and was great to watch as I had close friends play predominant roles in many scenes of the motorcycle club the NAM KNIGHTS! No issues with product!,1314230400,,185,4.470588235294118

3692219,1,B001M45O90,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen, it was so bad I'm actually writing a review and I have never done this before.  The plot line was so bad it was actually shocking, but the acting was below the standards of some adult films (mostly the main character).  I did not pay anything to see this movie and felt like I was cheated.  If you spend $17.99 on it I'm positive you will regret it.  I don't know what movie the two people who gave it a 5 star rating were watching, but trust the 1 star people because this movie sucked.",1296259200,,529,4.0576923076923075
3692220,3,B001M45O90,"Actually, the movie itself deserves 5 stars, but the copy I got had two scenes missing toward the end of the movie, and the timing seemed to be important to the overall story. I returned this copy to the Amazon.com seller and got a replacement. Guess what? The second copy also had the same two portions missing. I then returned that copy, and got a refund. I still want this movie, because the plot was excellent, the actors were very believable, and the scenery was great. I am hoping that the same company produced both (faulty) copies, and I realize that sometimes you definitely ""get what you pay for"" ($2.32 +$2.98 S&H), but now I hesitate to pay $[...] from Amazon.com just to prove that old adage. If anyone has a good copy, without obvious missing scenes, please write a review and specify whether you paid retail or wholesale. (Both copies were advertised & sold as NEW from [...]). This was in September of 2009. I'm more than willing to pay the high price, because the plot and acting were so good.",1266969600,,1010,4.554945054945055
3692221,5,B001M45O90,"I really enjoyed this suspenseful police crime-drama, beautifully filmed in the crisp autumn colour of northern New Jersey, coupled with the movie's multiplicity of historical inter-linkage to that frighteningly tragic, 1963 November day in Dallas. The day America changed forever, and not for the better, right up to the present era.

The movie begins slowly with young (ex)NYPD officer, David Secca (Carl T. Evans) and his expecting wife Jennifer Secca (Arija Bareikis) relocated from Queens to a small, rather boring little township across the Hudson, in sleepy, suburban New Jersey. This small town is also where the officer Secca was originally born & raised, along with his recently deceased father, who served with distinction on the local police force.

Very soon into this picture David joins the same northern New Jersey town's police department as a detective.

While the young couple were antique shopping for their new home, Jennifer really likes an old wooden jewelery box, which the couple purchases.  At home Jennifer & David discover something crucial inside the jewelery box, which develops into an exceedingly dangerous Pandora's box of multi-layered, far reaching, ongoing government conspiracies, involving the vicious, assassination of President Kennedy.

Chris Noth plays a local N.J. college professor, Steve Lynde, who recently authored a good selling book on the events surrounding the assassination of JFK, however he does not buy into conspiracies, nor the New Jersey detective's extremely interesting discovery, who sought out professor Lynde's assistance -- until, the professor himself is swiftly drawn into the mounting danger, directly resulting from his contact with detective Secca.

The additional fine cast members include some familiar faces from films as well as TV shows, such as Tony Lo Bianco, Barbara Barrie, Vincent Curatola, Don Harvey, Frank Gio, Noelle Beck, April Ortiz, Sharon Angela, Peter Criss, among many others.

One thing I would have liked is that this well done, intense, crimes-in-high-places thriller went a bit longer.

3692222,1,B001M45O90,"Even though I had read the other one-star review, I had to purchase it anyway, for I had been an Extra in the cocktail party scene, so I wanted my own copy to add to my acting reel. The creators of the film promised all of us that they would send us a copy of the finished product as soon as it was ready to be released. After contacting several people and realizing that they had duped us, I had to purchase my own copy, which I did not appreciate. Back to the film: I'm embarrassed to have been a part of it, for the acting was very sub-par, especially the overabundance of corny, cutesy lovey-dovey scenes. But my negative opinion definitely does not include Vincent Curatola, Christopher Noth,Tony loBianco or the great Thom Christopher (who was not even mentioned in the credits) who I adore!",1244332800,3,797,4.465753424657534
3692223,1,B001M45O90,"My husband and I both found this movie painfully slow and unconvincingly acted.  We hung on, hoping that a good story could move it along, but the subplots (or what we thought might be subplots) went nowhere.  I normally don't write reviews for Amazon, but I rely on them heavily.  Therefore, when I saw that the only 2 reviews written for this item were so glowingly enthusiastic, I felt it my social responsibility to warn would-be customers.  If you are curious about this movie, borrow it from the library, or even rent it - but please don't spend 17.99 for your own copy.",1241481600,8,576,4.563106796116505
3692224,5,B001M45O90,A suspenseful thriller! The possibility of finding new evidence that may shed light on the JFK assasination is mind-blowing. A MUST SEE for any American history buff.,1236038400,3,166,5.185185185185185

8320412,1,B001M45O90,"I was very excited for this movie to be released because I think that Chris Noth is a great actor.  When I finally got the movie and sat down to watch it, I was sadly disappointed.  By the time I got over 1/2 way through, I had to start fast-forwarding due to boredom. I love Chris Noth and figured that any movie with him in it had to be good but he is only in the movie for maybe 30 minutes total!  His face was clearly put on the cover of the case to sell the movie. The male actor who IS the star of the movie is so boring and non-talented that watching him could put one to sleep. The movie is not rated but if I had to give it a rating, it would be a big fat ""T"" for turkey. What a dud.",1387152000,,692,3.7260273972602738
8320413,4,B001M45O90,Pretty good plot with some good acting. I don't agree with the reviews of bad acting.  This movie had some actors in it from the sopranos.  Chris Noth is a pretty good actor also.,1386720000,,179,4.235294117647059
8320414,4,B001M45O90,"I was surprised by this one. Almost passed it by when I saw it was yet another spawned by the Kennedy Assassination. It turned out to be a modest production in which most things were done right and done well. Acting was on the mark in character and action creation, actors conveyed their very  ordinariness in a melodramatic situation. The police, including the new guy on the block, the hero of the film, act like members of a small town New Jersey force. The villains acted suitably villainous, both the gang members and the big fish behind the scene.  Those who were frightened by the set-up were shown to be responding realistically. Some of the action scenes were abbreviated, not I think for lack of money, but because they evoked the appropriate responses without expanding upon them.
I was hesitant to indulge in yet another Kennedy  Assassination after-effect. We had too much of that in all media in the years following the murder. The absence of a trial, the dramatic death of the killer right in front of the TV cameras a few feet away, in the area of  the police station, no less, was more than enough to stir seemingly endless debate. This repetition was acceptable because it was controlled for cinematic purposes. The damped down emotions also contributed to make a touchy subject palatable.
In sum, while this is yet another Kennedy assassination media presentation, it does rest on premises that are clearly fictional. This makes it a  picture  for most people who like conspiracy films that they don't have to get churned up about. There are some weak scenes; on the whole, however, it is a good one for almost every viewer.
Note this is one of ten films in '10 Movie Action Pack'. Buy that and get nine other films for not much more than you would pay for this one.",1376438400,2,1785,4.650793650793651
