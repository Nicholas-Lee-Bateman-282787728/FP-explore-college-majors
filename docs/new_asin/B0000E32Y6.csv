To me it is a fun example of children at play and using their creative mind in story play - ""playing along"" always has its awkward moments because children in real life do not us scripts.",1514419200,,429,3.988372093023256

8001716,2,B0000E32Y6,"The trailer of The Ghost Club describes the characters as the next generation of Ghostbusters. To that trailer voice man I say, Sir, Ive watched the Ghostbusters. Ive read the novelization of Ghostbusters. I played Ghostbusters with my friends. These characters Sir, are no Ghostbusters.

I started watching Ghost Club with my 7yr old niece. I allowed my niece to stop watching when she asked; why was she being punished? My niece actually said shed rather go to church. And thats really saying something because thats my niece who hates God.

The plot of Ghost Club primarily revolves around 4 kids hunting the Brandle Banshee, but oh yeah, theres also an evil golf course man trying to steal a ladies restaurant too. It is basically an episode of Scooby-Doo, if Scooby-Doo was just a video of a dog s***ting.

The movie does not make it clear why the ghost is a banshee instead of a regular ghost. But to be fair it also doesnt explain what the white people of the town Brandle did to all the minorities either. Nor does it make clear why none of the kids have dads.

What is clear is that the banshee is the mother of the kids grandmother. This is especially weird to find out since the grandmother tells the kids about the banshees (her mothers) death as just sort of a fun, silly, scary goof. You know, how anyone would talk about the death of their mother.

Despite the Grandmother telling the story you're not really sure how the banshee died. But, they do show a flashback of a branch falling in the woods during a rainstorm followed by a woman screaming, leading this viewer to assume that after the branch fell, got up, dusted itself off, and shot the woman who would become the banshee with a gun. Several times. It was gross.

Movie highlights include; grandmother casually fainting and being hauled away in ambulance while the kids watch an Ebay auction, an evil businessman hitting golf balls into a coffee cup, and a girl asking a tape recorder questions about her body.

They never show the banshee, but the tape recorder girl talks to the wind a lot.

The go-kart on the cover of the DVD is only in the movie for about 5 seconds and is totally irrelevant.

Ghost Club teaches us that there is a reason kids are often played by older kids in movies. Turns out, kids are terrible actors and unattractive. The nerdy science kids voice was completely dubbed over by what is best described as the voice of a 2 pack a day, in her mid-fifties, female truck driver. He was the only character I liked.

I would like to note Ghost Club does pass the Bechdel Test. Some of you might be familiar with the Bechdel Test. Its a test I created in 10th grade. Its based on; would I sit through this movie if Carrie Bechdel from 3rd period said she would give me a hand job at the end? The answer is yes, a thousand times yes. Because despite the rumors you might have heard hand jobs are still pretty great. And this movie is short. My final review, two stars.",1445644800,,2960,4.474953617810761
8001717,3,B0000E32Y6,"Although this was an OK movie, I think many viewers may have been mislead by the movie name or the artwork. This is not a movie about Ghostbusters and it doesn't feature the haunted house scenario with bats flying around as shown on the cover. It is actually more of a family film about a woman who is about to lose her restaurant to developers and four kids who are trying to stop ""the bad guys."" Even though the movie was enjoyable on a certain level, it was also fairly predictable, with few things to keep us in suspense. The acting was subpar, but the four kids did seem to work well together. This is obviously a low budget film, but if you're looking for something the whole family can watch together, this movie is fine. Just don't expect a Hallmark Hall of Fame production. The film did feature good location shooting--it was filmed entirely on location in Chester, South Carolina. So, I cautiously recommend this film; just don't let the name and cover picture fool you.",1322956800,,980,4.5423728813559325
8001718,1,B0000E32Y6,"The best part about this movie is the fun our family had making fun of the poor acting. This is worse than any after school special, worse than any kid show on Nick. It's as well-acted as a poorly-acted school play. And who wants to watch that if your kids aren't in it (I suspect the positive reviews were well-meaning relatives of the kid actors. It's the only explanation I can think of.)? Pass on this one---unless you put it in the category of so bad it's funny or if kids want to torture their parents by making them watch.",1149292800,2,529,4.3
8001719,1,B0000E32Y6,"My family and I did not enjoy the movie The Ghost Club.  My children thought the acting on the part of the kids in the movie was not only poor, but very unconvincing. The children didn't seem natural and they seemed to act as though they felt what they were doing was silly.  At times my younger son (9) would say, 'Now it's starting to get interesting' only to have it continue down the same boring trail.  My daughter (11) enjoys scarey movies and books similar to the books by R. L. Stine; she was quite disappointed with this movie.  I felt our time could have been better spent doing something else.",1081900800,3,604,4.366071428571429
8001720,5,B0000E32Y6,"Having seen this film, I was impressed with the child actors and the overall story. For an adult, it's an obvious plotline but I found myself sucked into the story and rooting for the kids against the evil villain.
Overall, obviously a low budget production, but with a talented cast and an well-brought-to-life script, this film will be great for kids and the parents who sit through the film with them.",1074988800,4,404,4.704225352112676
