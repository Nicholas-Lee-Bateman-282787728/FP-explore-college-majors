2777124,4,B000NPASR2,I enjoyed this program very much.  The backgrounds and inter-relationships of the main characters are interesting as well as heartbreaking.  The last few episodes have poor subtitles.  You'll need your thinking cap on to decipher them.,1350518400,3,235,5.472222222222222
2777125,4,B000NPASR2,"Note: This review is for the drama and not this specific DVD set.

I enjoyed this show while I was watching it, but overall it wasn't all that memorable for me. (I am looking up character names to write this review and having really jog my memory over what they did in the show, whoops.) It is a 'forced cohabitation' drama, as I am learning is a common trope in K-Dramas.

It starts with the worst friends ever. No joke. Dong-wook and Hee-jin have been friends with Jee-eun since they were kids.  DW and HJ just found out that they are expecting a baby (this is probably the silliest pregnancy in TV history that I have seen, no baby bump...it pretty much is convenient whenever HJ needs an excuse not to do something--which is in character).  Neither has any money, but their friend, poor Jee-eun, who also doesn't have much does have the house her father left her.  They some how scrape together enough money to convince her she has won a free trip to Hong Kong and send her off with a one way ticket.  While she is gone they sell her house and empty her bank accounts.

She has the luck on the plane to sit next to Lee Young-jae.  He happens to be an obscenely famous actor. He is also wearing a vomit inducing shirt. It is a seriously loud print and she does get motion sick...all over it... (His fashion through the whole show is sort of awful.  This was made before&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boys-Over-Flowers-Korean-Drama-Complete-Set-8-DVDs-with-English-Subtitles/dp/B002D11UIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boys Over Flowers - Korean Drama Complete Set (8 DVDs with English Subtitles)</a>&nbsp;which from what I've read was a bench mark in Korean male fashion.  He has wide lapels, loose fitting pants and atrocious prints...)  He wants nothing more to do with her--which is pretty understandable.  While she, as she slowly figures out just how stranded in Hong Kong she is, comes begging to him for help.  She ends up pretending to be romantically involved with a friend of his ( and in comes the secondary male lead) in order to get enough money to fly home.

Both think they are done with the other at this juncture. Of course not, what sort of drama would that be? Who bought Jee-eun's house but Young-jae.  He feels bad enough for her situation to agree to let her stay there if she will be his housekeeper. However, his unrequited love, Hye-won, drives him to a crazy place where he thinks being married to Jee-Eun for a year in fake arrangement would be better.  Hye-won, herself, has a case of unrequited love for the man that Jee-eun pretended to be involved with earlier, Yoo Min-hyuk. Ah love square.

Bi/Rain is great with the twinkling boyish charm that Young-jae needs to get away with the stunts he pulls. There is always a wonderful little twinkle in his eye. Song Hye-gyo is adorable as Jee-eun and the woman is impressive for the number of times she is running all over Korea and Hong Kong in crazy heels. (I'm not kidding, she has tons of running scenes and they are all in shoes that were meant to be cute not comfy.)

A pretty enjoyable romantic romp, but like I said, it has already faded pretty quickly from my memory and it has only been a few weeks since I watched it.",1325030400,3,3249,4.7406749555950265

8180395,2,B000NPASR2,"Watch this, if you want to see a woman, striving for independence, fall for an emotionally and a verbally abusive jerk.  This KDrama is dated and was apparently popular, in 2004.  The storyline, about mostly hearing an immature man/child verbally abuse a woman, over and over again, is draining.  Each episode was pretty much the same as the last one.  I'm amazed that this was even popular.",1506988800,,391,4.791044776119403

8180399,2,B000NPASR2,"I have watched this series before and I enjoyed it although it wasn't my favorite series of all time, but I thought it would be perfect for my grandma who also loves watching Korean dramas. I purchased this as a birthday present for her and I know when buying these kinds of DVDs that I need to watch out for the region locks and if they're NTSC or PAL compatible with the DVD player. The product details clearly stated that it is only compatible in Region 1 which is U.S. and Canada. With that being said, I also made sure that my grandma's DVD player was compatible for it and it accepts NTSC DVDs. Great, it seems like I'm good to go. I ordered them and they came in time for her birthday. She was excited to try it out and when she put it in the DVD player to load, it said error. Thinking it was just a fluke, we took it back out and put it back in and it said error on both the t.v. and the DVD player saying it was region locked. I tried it on my Macbook and it played on there, but that just defeated the whole purpose of getting it for my grandma's DVD player since I can only visit every once in a while. Since it didn't play on the DVD player, it is safe for me to assume that it's PAL format.

I was thinking of returning it, but I think I can burn it somehow to a blank disc and get around the region lock. Surely there are tutorials of getting around this. If I can't get around it, I will return it.

Please be careful when purchasing because it may not play on your DVD player even if it is NTSC compatible. Overall, I would not recommend anyone to purchase this if you live in the U.S. just incase you have this region lock problem. With this lock on, you absolutely will not be able to play any DVD from this series.

Besides this problem with the DVD set, I hope this doesn't discourage anyone from watching this series. Song Hye Kyo and Rain are cute together in this series. As an avid Korean drama watcher, I highly recommend the series, just not this particular set to buy if you're in the U.S.

Another note: English subtitles were alright... they definitely weren't the best in terms of spelling and grammar, but they were good enough to at least understand what was going on.",1422316800,2,2201,4.171764705882353

I KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY SOUND CRAZY BUT I DON'T LIKE TV SERIES STORIES OR I NEVER SAT LONG ENOUGH TO WACHED ANY OF THEM.  I SURE SAT AND WATCHED THIS ONE AS MY STRESS RELIEVER MOMENT.

But Han Ji Eun is swindled by her best friends and loses her cherished home. Because of her friends betrayal she is stranded in China, while they sell her house.

On the airplane and in China, she runs into the self-centered actor, Lee Young Jae and they don't quite hit it off with each other due to a few awkward incidents. But thanks to the actor, she is able to return to Korea. However, she soon finds out that he is the one that bought her home.

Ji Eun and Young Jae continue to run into each other. For different personal reasons, they wind up in a one-year marriage contract. But as these two live together and argue consistently, they start to develop feelings for each other.

This is a great and popular romantic comedy. It was a hit drama in 2004. There are lots of funny, endearing, and romantic moments throughout the show. I recommend watching this drama. (16 episodes)",1388448000,,1050,4.458333333333333
