7835341,5,6303050204,Best Tracy and Dvorak ever!!!,1412121600,,29,5.0
7835342,2,6303050204,"This film isn't worth much. But its a good explaintion of why the production code regulating film content came about in that era. Its sleazy in a real cheap explotation sense. Its not shocking in a modern sense. It just came across as stupid or even funny. Lots of lingering shots. Lots of exposition about stockings. And at one point a landlady reassures her new tenant that she runs a good house with no vomit on the floor.

Molly Louvain is a girl gone bad according to most of the classic formula. She gets pregnant, has baby and then goes on the road with a gangster. She eventually ends up driving the getaway car in a robbery which puts on the wrong side of the law. There is a reporter character running around for no particular good reason. She eventually turns herself in to save her baby and then someone at warner factory decided they had enough film which leads to an abrupt pointless end.

Like a lot of the warner films from this era, the film is somewhat saved by the heroic work of the actors. Ann Dvorak acts her heart out and somehow makes the script kind of work. The rest of the cast somewhat does archtype character actor roles. While the character roles are one-dimensional, they are competently done.

I saw this thing on pay tv stuck inside during the day in the middle of the week. Its not something I would normally seek out, but it kept my interest for a couple hours which is somewhat surprising and why gave it a second star.

The difference between classic explotation (like this) and modern exploitation is that in the older films there was a level of professionalism shown by the talent working with bad material thats rarely seen today.",1330992000,,1670,4.5198675496688745
7835343,4,6303050204,"This is your standard Warner Brothers Pre-Code - gangsters, cops, reporters, fallen women - you name it, this film's got it. Lee Tracy and Ann Dvorak were ideal players for this type of movie. They reteamed for Love Is A Racket, another Warners gem. Molly doesn't make much sense but it's a lot of fun.",1299024000,,302,4.509090909090909
7835344,3,6303050204,"Ann Dvorak, a talented actress with an intensity to rival Bette Davis, was destined for big things in 1932 when this pre-code Warner Brothers programmer was released. She was a smash hit in ""Scarface"" the year before but was a rebel long before Davis. Her career never really hit the heights because she quarrelled with her employers and walked out on her contract. Warner's took revenge by relegating her to lousy parts, thereby thwarting her route to real stardom.

She stars as the ""tinsel"" girl, Molly Louvain, a naive small town girl dumped by her rich boyfriend, pregnant and on the downhill slide. The film is a typical sleazy Warners mini-production but without Dvorak's great performance, it would be a complete mess. The script has the usual quotient of one liners including one hilarious moment when a group of men are betting on the sex of pedestrians but the plot falls apart with far too much talk and improbabilities poured on with a trowel. Lee Tracy plays his typical role of the fast talking amoral reporter and the finale is completely unconvincing. This is one time when the usual Warner's economy fails, leaving only the skeleton of a melodrama.

This is a Warner's Archive release so it is a no frills DVD with no extras at all and very expensive. The good news, however, is that the print is generally excellent with only a little popping and a vertical white line in a few spots. It is only worth seeing for Dvorak.",1280275200,,1439,4.7063492063492065
7835345,3,6303050204,"Molly Louvain is a girl who has become pregnant by a rich young fellow that loves her and wants to marry her. He has told her that he intends to tell his mother that night before Molly gets to his house to attend his birthday party. However, when Molly shows up at the family estate she is told by the butler that mother and son left suddenly for Europe. Apparently Molly's fianc loved mother's millions more than he loved Molly and no doubt Molly's would-have-been mother-in-law could not tolerate the idea of a member of the huddled masses being her future daughter-in-law. All alone in the world, Molly turns to shady character Nicky Gant, who takes her away from her home town and out on the road. Molly figures he's possibly financing their way with stick-ups, but Molly asks no questions as she has a baby to think of. One day Nick gets in a shoot-out with the cops with Molly at the wheel of the car, and suddenly Molly is up to her neck in Nick's past and present illegal activities. She dyes her hair and decides to hide out under a false name in a small apartment until the heat is off. She has two problems that complicate matters even further - she is unable to go check on her baby, who she has left with kindly acquaintances, and ambitious reporter Scotty Cornell lives across the hall and is determined to find Molly Louvain and crack the story of a lifetime.

This film is watchable largely because nobody plays a woman suffering from the internal moral struggle of good versus evil like Ann Dvorak (as Molly Louvain) and nobody plays the smart aleck reporter that will do anything for a story like Lee Tracy (as Scotty Cornell). However, the film seems incomplete in so many ways. There is no chemistry between Tracy and Dvorak at all, and a story like this needs their chemistry in order to have their relationship in the film seem something other than tacked on. The ending is also woefully incomplete. It seems like Warners ran out of budget and the powers that be just said ""stop here and write some dialogue to round this thing out"". I'd recommend this just to see Lee Tracy and Ann Dvorak do the kind of acting they do best, just don't expect the kind of precode sizzle you saw in any of James Cagney's and Joan Blondell's films.

The video and audio on the DVD-R of this 1932 film are just about perfect. There are no visible defects and the audio has no distortion or hiss. Do note that there are no extras and no chapter stops. You may only go forwards and backwards in ten minute increments. Also note that you may purchase this product directly from Warner Brothers for under twenty dollars.",1261872000,8,2619,4.488469601677149
7835346,4,6303050204,"The Strange Love of Molly Louvain is a film about a girl (Ann Dvorak) who seems to be on her way up in life. She is adored by all the men around her where she works and she has a wealthy boyfriend who might ask her to marry him. However, the man leaves Molly and she's on her own, pregnant with his child. Molly gets mixed up with a gangster (Leslie Fenton) who gets her and an innocent friend of hers (Richard Cromwell) in a jam with the police. In hiding, she meets a reporter (Lee Tracy) who she falls in love with.

Ann Dvorak is beautiful as Molly Louvain. It takes a while to get used to her as a blonde, but with lighter hair, her beautiful eyes are more noticeable. She has a smooth voice and is very expressive.

Richard Cromwell is sweet and sincere in his part. His character is cute but strong, and incredibly likeable.

Lee Tracy is incredibly natural in this film. He is wonderfully playful and comical at times and no-nonsense at others. He and Dvorak have great chemistry together.

This film is part of the Forbidden Hollywood series for several reasons. The most obvious is that a woman is depicted as having a child out of wedlock. Also, the gangster elements are more raw than in later films. This film also displays Dvorak in her underwear.

The drawback to The Strange Love of Molly Louvain is the ending. Only part of the story is concluded; the rest is left unanswered. This leaves for a bit of an unsettled feeling.",1132617600,7,1440,4.398496240601504
7835347,3,6303050204,"A tough, steamy pre-code film which is fascinating but hugely melodramatic. Ann Dvorak plays title role: a hotel cigar counter person who gets herself in trouble by having an affair with rich man. Molly then leaves town with a would-be petty thief, Nicky Grant. She tires of him and takes her little girl to a woman who will care for her while she finds work as a dance hostess. Molly meets an old friend who worked as a bellboy at the hotel: he's a student now and they talk over old times. But as soon as they are outside, Grant reappears....Twisty and not terribly convincing plot-wise, because she is - to put it bluntly - dense. Dvorak, however was always a competent actress and she keeps the viewer watching. As Scottie Cornell, Lee Tracy is pretty good: he gets her in the end (oh, boy!- goody gum drops!) The working title of this little potboiler from Warners was THE TINSEL LADY (!) which was based on an unpublished play called TINSEL GIRL by Maurine Dallas Watkins. Dvorak quickly rose from a hoofer in early talkies into an interesting leading actress. While never quite a star, her performances are always worth watching. Born Ann McKim in 1912, Dvorak had her last role of any consequence in a fair 1950 film entitled OUR VERY OWN - in which she played the peroxided natural mother of adoptee Ann Blyth.",1041465600,6,1319,4.593220338983051
7835348,3,6303050204,"Ann Dvorak stars as Molly Louvain, a woman who aspires to a better life and doesn't want to turn out like the mother who abandoned her.  However, she attracts all the men she meets, and in the space of seventy minutes, she goes through four of them!  One of them is particularly bad news, leaving her on the run from the police, and another leaves her a single mother.  Like most Warner Brothers films from this time period, it's a tough little film.  Ann Dvorak is good as Molly, although it's hard to feel sorry for a character that makes so many bad choices.  Lee Tracy has a lot of charisma as man #4, perhaps the only man that really understands her.  The film is well directed by Michael Curtiz, and it has some great dialogue.  But it's not the kind of film that really involves you, since none of the characters evoke enough sympathy (except Molly right at the end).  It was probably cutting edge in its day, with its depiction of an unwed mother, but it doesn't have the same kind of impact today.",1015804800,,1006,4.370967741935484
