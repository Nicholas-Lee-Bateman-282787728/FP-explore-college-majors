8279874,5,B001AVBXTK,There are very few documentary products dealing with North African Berbers or with dances related to the region.  This documentary presents both in a wonderful mix of still photos and live video footage.  Unfortunately the footage is older and subsequently offers lower quality images but what is captured is really spectactular.  The information is presented by Dancer and Dance Ethnologist Aisha Ali who is well known and respected for her knowledge and ability in the Middle East and North African styles of dance.  I would have liked to been able to put subtitles on while watching though since the audio quality is also not as good as I would like.  There were a few times when I couldn't make out what was being said even after repeating it several times.  All in all this is a great tool for any dance historian interested in North African Dances and Berber (Imazighen/Amazigh) Dances.  It's also a useful tool for bellydancers interested in dances from this region as well.,1257638400,3,981,4.873493975903615
