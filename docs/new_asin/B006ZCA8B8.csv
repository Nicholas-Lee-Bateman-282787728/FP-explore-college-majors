8506872,5,B006ZCA8B8,I loved this documentary.  My mother grew up in Lake Chapala and Guadalajara.,1479772800,,77,4.923076923076923
8506873,1,B006ZCA8B8,It's the exact film as the 2013 film,1476921600,,36,3.625
8506874,1,B006ZCA8B8,Not as described. This is a slideshow of pictures on an outdated PowerPoint format. It has little to nothing to do with the daily life of expats. Severely disappointing. Beyond boring. Don't waste your money. The other two reviews must be from the 76 year old photographer and his wife.,1460851200,,286,4.74
8506875,1,B006ZCA8B8,"I'm not going to waste a lot of time writing about how bad this 'video' is, but someone needs to take the time to put a bell on the rat! This is less a video and more a slide show. It's virtually devoid of information and, unbelievably, it spends more time on places 2 hours from the Lake than it does on the Lake. Don't bother with this. At $1.99 it is WAY over priced!",1348704000,2,370,3.9466666666666668
8506876,5,B006ZCA8B8,"This DVD is just a pure pleasure to watch!  To move to Mexico, or to simply visit, it is obvious that you are going to need your camera! Fabulous photography and narration that simply ""draws you in"" combine to make this show superior!  If you're going to Mexico, Lake Chapala is a must-see!  I loved this show!  Thank you, Mr. Jackson, for such a beautiful interpretation.",1329091200,3,372,4.590909090909091
8506877,5,B006ZCA8B8,"If you are thinking of moving to Mexico, this is a must see.  It is so informational and is filled with great pictures.  As considering moving to Mexico for retirement, you will find this to be priceless in your decision making process.  Very down to earth host and commentary make it very realistic and very exciting to learn more about the country, safety, culture, cost and dining.  Rent it, you will not be disappointed.",1328659200,3,424,4.6891891891891895
