8674144,5,B00MR2LBVG,"This movie defines Andrzej Zulawski (and his fascination with Sophie Marceau).  It's a melange of Beckett, Pasolini, Harold Lloyd and Almoldovar.  He bags every facet of civilization, both civilized and uncivilized, and shakes it all up.  You never know what's going to happen next except that it's going to be more outrageous than anything before.  It's satisfying to me that there is a renewed interest in Zulawski which has also stimulated a new interest in La Femme Publique beyond Valerlie Kaprinsky (who, incidently  deserves a deeper recognition than she's gotten in her work and curious neglect as an actress).",1458691200,,618,5.202020202020202
