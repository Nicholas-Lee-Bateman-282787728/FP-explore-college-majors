4126168,5,B003ICWTR4,". . . and blew us all away !!

I was there
It will be great.
And if you know where to look you can find DVDs of the Jersey gigs - and I am told (ahem) that they're pretty good too !!!
I was lucky enough to catch Bruce at three gigs on that tour and he was wonderful each time - trust me from what I have seen, read and heard about this DVD/blu ray you won't be disappointed",1275436800,4,373,3.6049382716049383
4126169,5,B003ICWTR4,Have been to many concerts in the UK and in the US. This concert is still the best concert I have ever been to. CAN'T WAIT!,1273708800,7,123,3.769230769230769
4126170,5,B003ICWTR4,Though not listed in the amazon tracklist Rosalita (Come Out Tonight) WILL be on the DVD after 'Born To Run' This is the amended track list from Bruce's official site.,1272931200,24,167,4.6
4126171,5,B003ICWTR4,"now we look forward to the (nearly) whole show...with a Bruce live concert, 5 stars is a lock!!!",1272844800,3,96,4.388888888888889
4126172,5,B003ICWTR4,"In answer to the sceptic who thinks we all work for Mr Landau, I was there and have seen the opening track on Youtube as filmed by [...], so would like to think that rest of the concert is filmed in the same way! The concert was fantastic, but the final set by Bruce and the E Street band was the closest someone as young as myself is probably ever going to get to seeing these guys in their prime. Glastonbury was a warm up for this show remember, and for those who caught that on the BBC, or live, believe this was one step up! They gave it their all, and when a group like this with a frontman like The Boss give it their all, you simply can't ask for anything more. By the way I don't work for Bruce or Mr Landau in any form, other than to shout loud and proud about anything Bruce and the E Street-er's release that warrants such devotion. Having said that, bar what should have been a double album from him in the mid 90's, (Human Touch and Lucky Town), which had some great tracks, but lacked that certain something, I've shouted for everything i was alive to see released, from Tunnel of love, through Tom Joad, the seeger sessions and Magic! Come on, the greatest rock front man, with the greatest comrades backing him up! This is not to be missed. And if you have any jobs going Mr Landau get in touch!

4126173,5,B003ICWTR4,"Since I heard that Jon Landau announced the forthcoming release of a live DVD of the working on a dream tour I was wondering which concert might be chosen. Bruce decided to release a concert from the European leg of the tour (once more after live at Hammersmith, live in Barcelona and live in Dublin). In fact, it was a great show in London at a fantastic festival location, a huge audience and with a solid, well diversified but (let's be honest) pretty average setlist (as in most venues during the European leg of the tour). As you can read out I am slightly disappointed about that choice. Because the last shows of the U.S. leg in late 2009 were that exceptionally outstanding one could hardly imagine that any other show would be chosen for release. Bear in mind, entire classic albums (including Born to run, Darkness on the edge of town, Born in the U.S.A., even The River!) have been played from start to finish at these shows, rare songs never heard live for more than 30 years were played (a dream came true for many long time fans). As a (European) die hard fan I, therefore, was hoping that either a Meadowlands gig (it would have been the first 'live in New Jersey' Concert DVD!) or a Philly Spectrum show would have seen the light of day.
Anyhow, it is always great to have something new to wait for and after all there is even more to come (announced Darkness box set, why not enriched with a complete darkness excerpt of a late 2009 show?).
So five stars as always for Bruce and a an incredibly outstanding E Street Band playing better than ever throughout the whole tour, but from the point of view of a die hard fan I'd give 'em a three.",1272067200,12,1656,4.415032679738562

4126217,5,B003ICWTR4,"I've been a fan of The Boss since 1974. I own almost everything he's done, and this live show is as good as rock n' roll gets. If you don't like this show, then you don't like rock n' roll, because Bruce and band flat nail it down, here. I first saw him live in 1980, and he floored me then. Somehow, he's even better now. I don't know how he does it, and I don't care. I just know that Bruce and the 'E' Streeters do it better than anyone else out there, and this DVD is living proof !",1390953600,,486,3.8217821782178216

4126221,5,B003ICWTR4,"As is widely known, there's just nothing like attending an E-Street Band concert. I'm so glad this Blu-Ray is available because, as far as trying to approximate being at a concert by watching one on TV, this is just about perfect. Great setlist, terrific performances, beautifully shot and edited, first-rate sound quality. Also, there's the matter of Springsteen's mood. Although he always take the stage to honor his fans and give them a good time, I've seen him, on occasion, be in SUCH a good mood that it take a bit of edge off the show. In this concert, he's a bit on the serious side and many of his songs are best with just a bit of angry edge. That just makes it really, really great. Last thing: There's no end to superlatives about the band. To the last person, whether officially E-Street Band or one of the supporting musicians, these people are tremendous. (By the way, in a fully just world, Soozie Tyrell, would be granted ""full membership."") But, that all said, holy cow: Max Weinberg. This guy is a beast. Plays the holy living hell out of the drums for 3 hours, looks like he's dressed for dinner, and doesn't even appear to break a sweat until about 2 hours in. Amazing.",1388534400,5,1190,4.53953488372093

4126224,5,B003ICWTR4,Incredible recording of a concert that goes from midday to dark without a break. One of the best guitar solo recorded by Lofgren on Youngstown. Bitton's work incredible giving a thread of continuity through the folk/hard rock/pop(?) presentation. How does this man  do it? Don't ask just enjoy the full force presentation of Springsteen and the E street band as they prove it all night! Live does not get ANY better on a recording.,1383868800,4,431,4.824324324324325
4126225,5,B003ICWTR4,"I have seen Bruce live twice and he never ever disappoints. This was such a stunning performance and to think he has been performing for over 40 years. A must see for every fan, anyone who watches it must become a fan!!",1382832000,,219,4.238095238095238

4126230,5,B003ICWTR4,"Amazing live show in Hyde Park in London. Bruce and the E Street Band give everything they have as usual.

4126233,5,B003ICWTR4,"I purchased this one when it came out and was amazed at how great the performance and quality of video and audio is. My wife and I saw the tour in the fall after this show. We saved watching the disc until almost the one year anniversary of the show and watched it with the lights off, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, yeah! This is in my book, by far, the best Springsteen concert on video. This was the closest that you can come to feel like you were there. While I think the Live in NYC disc is good, I never really felt like I was at the show, and don't get me started on changing the running order of the songs. London Calling is a great, great Springsteen disc and one I recommend to anyone who has not been fortunate enough to see the band at full power. I only wish Bruce could take a cue from Pearl Jam and release every single show to the fans.

I agree with the one reviewer who said the biggest fault was that Bruce was not close enough to the audience, and that does take a bit away, the man lives off the crowd, and they him. But it is still as close to being there as you can get. Just buy this one and pretend you were there!",1374969600,,1144,3.9310344827586206
4126234,3,B003ICWTR4,"I am a huge Bruce fan. I was looking forward to see this DVD but i was a little dissapointed. Its not with the concert per se or Bruce's performance. As always they were great. The problem that i had with this concert is that i didn't like the set list. I mean, come on, Bobby Jean? Good lovin? Seeds? Jungleland? Out in the Street? Dont get me wrong,this songs are great and i have heard them lots of times. But that's precisely the problem. This songs should not have been included in the DVD because we have heard them lots of times before in other formats. For me it was a little tiresome to hear those songs again. Do i recommend this DVD? Yes, i will, but with a caveat: you have heard most of the songs previously.",1370822400,,721,4.194244604316546

I always liked him, but finally got to see him last March perform live in Greensboro. It was for my 51st birthday. I waited too long, and if I have the chance to see him live again, I will. It was a near religious experience. You can't fully grasp who he is as a person, as a musician, as our unofficial poet laureate unless you see him live. This DVD captures all that including his humor, and the great relationship he has with the member of the E-Street band, minus Patty (she's not on it). But the Big Man is--probably one of the last well recorded videos of him. It's really not to be missed, well worth the purchase ( I bought it for my husband)",1358208000,,765,4.175675675675675

A great combination of songs such as ""Badlands,"" ""Rosalita,"" ""Glory Days,"" and ""American Land,"" plus terrific arrangements of ""She's the One,"" ""Johnny 99"" and ""Good Lovin.""

My family and I watched it after work/school over the course of a couple of nights, and even those who aren't as fervent Springsteen fans as I am, and had never seen him in concert before, commented on what incredible energy he has and what an amazing performer he is.

4126267,5,B003ICWTR4,"There is no question in my mind that this is not only the single best Springsteen/E Street live concert video, it is probably the best I've ever seen by anyone. This is an epic, powerful, joyous, splendid 3 hours of the power and joy that Bruce brings to rock and roll. From his covers of London Calling and Stephen Foster (yes the 19th composer of ""Oh! Susanna"", ""Camptown Races"", ""Old Folks at Home"" and ""Swanee River"") to his buoyant ode to hopes of the Irish immigrants in ""American Land"", he delivers. There isn't a break in the three-hour set which starts in the afternoon and ends in the darkness of evening. Of course they do BTR and an achingly beautiful version of ""Jungleland"" where you can hear the strain on his voice near the end of the set, the smokiness that allows you to hear his age but sung with the original phrasing, not the rushing-through-the-lyrics phrasing that we've seen for the past 10 years. The sound is impeccably mixed and the variety of the show--he does songs from ""Working on A Dream"" and ""The Rising"" that blend in now as beautifully as the classics of BTR, Darkness and The River. I love the New York live set. I love the Barcelona live set. I love Hammersmith Odeon London live set from 1975. I love the older versions before Clarence's back forced him to stop vamping and dancing with Bruce. But at this point, if I could only have one live performance of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, it would have to be this one. Get ""London Calling: Live from Hyde Park.""

4126268,5,B003ICWTR4,"At 60 years old, there is no equal to Bruce & the band when it comes to concert performance......even those pretenders at 1/2 his age cannot compete when it comes to a Live Concert performance.  Clocking in at about 3 hours, the London Calling concert is (1) awesome (2) unbelievably CLEAR sound for outdoor concert (3) has great mix of fan favorite songs from the last 30 years.  From opening note to last encore, Bruce does not let up, slow down, or take a break......it is non stop, wonderful, clear sounding, floor stomping music.

For fans that already have the Live in NYC or Barcelona concerts, this is a MUST for your collection, as this also includes super live versions of Outlaw Pete, Working on a Dream, Trapped, No Surrender,  of course opening to a rocking London Calling, and haunting The River, plus 20+ other songs.

Bruce takes audience signs of songs and makes changes on the spot, which is pretty amazing.  Touching scene was Bruce reaching out to  what looked like a 6 year old, held up by the parent, and Bruce stretching the microphone out to the boy ( while being held up by other fans ) so that we can hear the kid sing "" Waiting on a Sunny Day"".....

4126271,5,B003ICWTR4,"Amazing. That's the one word that comes to mind when thinking aboutd this DVD.

The performance is great, almost of it in broad daylight. As always, Springsteen and the E-Stree Band are giving their best.

Sound is great, and gool-old Bob Clearmountain is the mixing engineer. Also, I must thanks director Chris Wilson (or his editeur) for the great editing, that thanfully does not follow the actual trend of blinding-fast cuts where you can not even see what's happening! Other than Bruce, the the one who clearly gets more screen time is drummer Max Weinberg. The relacement of deceased Danny Federici of course handles the job well, but has very few screen time. Garry TAllent as always is almosta invisible and like a statue, but giving his best and absurdly precise.

Pat Scialfa is absent, but that's due to taking care of the children at home. Sosie Tyrrell is strong, as also are Van Zandt (apparently the most affected by age) and Lofgren.

The set list is a gem. Bruce's catalogue is so vast and high-quality, that he can choose effortlessly to change it from tour to tour or even from show to show. Tha inclusion of ""No Surrender"" and ""Bobby Jean"" were a plus for me.

Image quality is top. Sound is also top. I'm not sure enough if I can rate this as good as the unvincible ""Live in NYC"", but it's a winner anyway.",1290297600,,1327,4.582278481012659

But how does one man get quite so sweaty, and with all that money why not change your shirt Bruce.  There were times when the running down to the crowd was a bit labored and in a few songs a bit less shouting and more singing would have been good, but all in all a very good set.

4126276,3,B003ICWTR4,"I caught Bruce Springsteen just as he was building a national audience. He had recently been on the cover of Time magazine concurrent with the release of ""Born To Run."" He was named as one of 3 male artists that were destined to change the face of music. The second was Jackson Browne and one could make an arguement that these two men have had a tremendous impact on music for over 3 decades. Third on the list was a young man named Nils Lofgren. I was a huge fan of Nils and to this day recommend his ""Cry Tough"" album whenever I get the chance. Some years later, a struggling Lofgren joined the E Street Band. The night I saw the Boss he was drunk. Very drunk. So drunk that during the solo for ""She's The One"" he leaned forward too far and pitched himself off the stage and fell six feet to the floor below. I was very unimpressed.

Through the years I've still enjoyed many of his studio releases and heard nothing but rave reviews for his live show. I watched him perform at the Hall Of Fame concerts too, most notably playing ""London Calling"" when the Clash were inducted. I was impressed enough that I jumped at the chance to buy this concert when it was released.

Midway through the first song I realized that Bruce's voice is absolutely shot. I'm not talking ""seasoned"" the way Tony Bennett's voice has become either. I mean shot. No range, no texture and the capacity for little more than screaming into the mike with enough gravel in his throat to pave the length of E Street.

Midway through the first disk I almost gave up. The band is as tight as ever. What Max has lost in ability at the drums he's more than made up for in efficiency. Being an older drummer myself I can't help but admire how well he still drives the entire band. God bless Clarence Clemmons. If you've kept up with the music media you are already well aware of the painful battles ""The Big Man"" has fought with his damaged hips, spine, and knees. If you focus on him during the show you can quickly see that the man can barely move. Yet he plays with such signature style and tenderness that his axe is immediately recognizable. His style has a signature sound all its own, much like Clapton's guitar work. His bravery and skills should not be missed. Little Steven is a well-known musicologist but his voice, never as good as his best friend Bruce, has lost what little luster it once had.

Then came Lofgren's moment to shine. He plays an absolutely magnificent guitar solo that takes the audience's breath away. It's long and shows all the reasons why he was once held in such high regard. Although the camera focuses on his effort, you can frequently see Bruce and Little Steven watching him across the stage. The look on Steven's face can only be described as ugly jealousy. The Boss simply looks bored. Although Springsteen calls for applause for virtually every other band member several times during the show, when an exhausted Lofgren finishes the solo, Bruce simply starts the next song without acknowledging Nils at all. I've played enough gigs in my time to be able to recognize when a band member isn't welcome. Nils apparently will be the E Street Outsider. He's treated like a black sheep throughout the concert and during the finale he follows the Boss out to the crowd and stands beside him. It takes Little Steven less than 5 seconds to race after him and crowd him away from Springsteen and the camera. These may be middle-aged adults, but they act like spoiled children for much of the show.

I was so unimpressed by the first disk I almost didn't put part 2 into my machine. I'm SO glad I did. The second half of the show is light years ahead of the first and is packed with highlight moments. The band sings a heartfelt and gorgeous version of ""Hard Times Come Again No More"" and then jumps into a version of ""Rosalita"" that is so packed with fun and energy that it should be illegal. It was also a special joy to see ""Jungleland"" performed with all the love and emotional passion that the song deserves.

Buy this concert. It's more than worth the price for just the second disk. Had this been the only disk in the set and included versions of ""Backstreets"" and ""Thunder Road"" it would have been worth twice the price. Unfortunately, it's a two disk set and the only use I've found for disk one is as a drink coaster. Your mileage may vary and you should watch the first half of the show at least once (you did pay for it after all) but the closing hour of the concert is so superior to the opening don't be surprised if that's the only spin you ever give disk one.",1284595200,6,4574,4.4263657957244655

4126287,3,B003ICWTR4,"Almost anyone who's seen Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band between 2007 and 2009 would agree that it was their strongest period on the road since the River Tour. Defying the restrictions of time and age, and even after the death of a key band member (Danny Federici in April of 2008), Bruce and the E Street Band electrified the stage each and every time they went out there, putting on some of their most legendary shows in years, culminating in the fall of 2009, when Bruce and the band performed their first six albums (""Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J."" up to ""Born in the U.S.A."") in their entirety. With so many wonderful performances to choose from, one would think a truly special dvd release could be made to commemorate such a landmark period in the band's history?

Unfortunately, it was not be. Like previous Bruce live releases, Bruce and co. have once again taken the easy way out, going for a show that had already been properly shot, mixed, edited and aired on television prior to its release, rather than take a little extra time to sit down and sift through the endless hours of pro-shot footage out there to create something fans would truly appreciate.

""London Calling"" Live in Hyde Park"" was a show Bruce had done as part of a festival rather than an official Bruce show. Granted, the majority of the audiences were there for him, but you can certainly feel a difference in this show then ""Live in New York City"" or ""Live in Barcelona"" or even ""Live in Dublin."" The show has an incredibly bland, standard set list, as opposed to the many long lost gems Bruce had revived over the course of two years.

Performance wise, Bruce and the band are at only 80 % total. Having done Glastonbury less than 24 hours earlier, Bruce's voice is tired and hoarse, with no force or power, robbing him of the expressive emotional coloring he's able to give his material when he's at his best. Even at 59, Bruce is still usually able to muster up the same energy he had at 29 or 35, but here he gets powered out quite often. The show's horrid stage setup, including a troublesome staircase that saps a lot of the connection Bruce is able to make so easily with his audience.

The band's playing is strong, aside from Clarence Clemons, whose health woes have sapped a great deal of his playing skills. Steven Van Zandt in particular is the most lively he's appeared on stage in years. But even the band, great though they still may be, aren't quite up to their game here. The opening ""London Calling"" cover is a mess thanks to Steve's slurring of the lyrics, and ""Racing in the Street,"" ""The Rising,"" and ""Jungleland"" lack the power of previous versions. ""Jungleland"" is particularly disappointing here, with Bruce's voice in tatters and the tempo brought down to a snail's pace (Clarence nails the solo, though). ""Lonesome Day"" also suffers from similar faults.

There are some highlight to be sure - ""Badlands"" and ""Born to Run"" never seem to get old, ""Out in the Street"" and ""Rosalita"" are a blast, ""Glory Days"" is given its definitive rendition, and ""No Surrender"" with Brian Fallon is sublime. The three song stretch of ""Seeds,"" ""Johnny 99,"" and ""Youngstown"" is also excellent, and represent the band at their most intense.

But these highlights don't seem to outweigh the many tired, overplayed fluff that is ""Bobby Jean,"" ""Waiting on a Sunny Day,"" and ""The Promised Land."" And ""Outlaw Pete"" and ""Working on a Dream"" just don't hold up to the new stuff.

As I said, there were so many other options they could've gone for - Danny's last shows in Boston and Indiana. The magnificent trio of shows at Giant Stadium in 2008. The St. Louis '08 show that many fans ranked up there with Roxy '78 and the Vietnam Veterans show in 1981. And, of course, the album shows - intense, once in a lifetime performances that brought some of Bruce's most underrated gems to life. All of these are now gathering dust.

The sound and picture quality are the best of any Bruce release to date, which stings all the more since such aethestic goodies ae wasted on an inferior product.",1280448000,27,4078,4.62292817679558

4126294,5,B003ICWTR4,"This is the best Bruce Springsteen DVD out there on the market.  Great film from afternoon into evening.  Springsteen is soaking wet after just 4 songs, what a performer!  Saw 2 of his shows on his last tour excellent stuff.  The band is top notch form here, Max plays the drums with unrestrained abandon. Nils Lofgren is still a great guitarist, and still jumpin' around after hip surgery, great interplay between Bruce and Stevie Van Zandt during the whole concert.  On the song ""Out In The Streets"", Bruce goes down in front of the crowd and has to get back up the stairs and states ""Give me a f---ing elevator, i'm 60!"" classic.  This is one of the best concert disc i've seen and you can get it for only $15 or less.  Let's hope Bruce doesn't wait to many more years for his next rockin' album and tour.

No one can rock a stage like Bruce, and this DVD is like being there, on-stage, backstage, in the front row!  It's obvious he and the band LOVE what they are doing, and from a purely selfish point of view, I hope they keep right on doing it.  I have seen them live several times over the years (starting in the late 60s before anyone had even heard of him, playing Cafe Wha? with a band called The Castiles!!) and can tell you this performance definitely lives up to the hype!!

which was very good but didn't set me on fire , and I was hesitant to buy another
live DVD & for some misplaced , preconceived reason , I didn't think the Hyde Park
concert would be that exciting , but I bought this DVD just to see him do Outlaw Pete live .

I knew from the opening song this DVD was going to be a cracker ,
by the end of the 1st disc I had to go and relax for a while ,
so involved did I become in the concert .

This is just a fantastic concert , visually , musically and technically .

I give it a solid 5 stars , go buy it , at the price its a bargain .",1279411200,8,654,3.617021276595745
4126298,5,B003ICWTR4,"To be honest, i was not really excited when it was announced that this wld be the show that would be released on DVD/Blu ray.
 I had seen a few songs which was telecast in england , which someone was kind enough to send me a copy of, and what i was disappointed with was the distance from the stage to the audience. But after reading the initial reactions here, i picked up a blu-ray player just for this and got the disc.
It is nothing short of phenomenal. While i am  a fan of his earlier two official releases too(NY and Barcelona) this is the first video which does full justice to the briliant E-Street Band. Bruce, pls don't ever let Bob Clearmountain go. The difference in sound between this and Barcelona is like night and day.
The band is in fine form and Bruce as always is brilliant. At times, it does feel that he is feeling the strain of having performed the previous night in Glastonbury( in his voice) but the man is incredible. Where he gets his energy from is mystifying.
Oh and the distance barrier is broken very early in the show. I was also surprised how well outlaw Pete works in live setting.

I have been watching this everyday for the last 3 weeks and even my aunts who don't watch rock like  this concert.they have always like Bruce though :)
Been a huge (obsessed?)fan since i was 12, more than 25 yrs back and yet to see this man live(live in India) so till the time i get to watch him, i will have to be contecnt with these videos and as long as he keeps releasing such great work, i will be happy.

4126299,5,B003ICWTR4,"Aurally this is far from the best of Bruce, but it's a visual treat and gives you the real Springsteen concert experience.  The quality of both visuals and sound is terrific, and the Boss is his usual entertaining ringmaster self.  For anyone who's never been to an E-Street show, it will be a revelation; for the rest of us it's a pure-pleasure reminder of the exhiliration that defines a Springsteen concert.

Bruce's voice is very hoarse and quite weak through the whole thing, and Patti is disappointingly missing, but I haven't heard Stevie so strong in a long time, and, as is always apparent in concert, Max is as mighty as ever.  Nils has plenty of energy and Clarence's sax still rules, so even in their 60s the E-Street boys give us a show well worth watching. I don't think you have to be Springsteen-obsessed to love this, but I have to admit, I wouldn't actually know about that!",1279238400,2,892,4.591194968553459

Does anyone else see this or is it just my copy? Please let me know.  This performance is so good that even with the audio a little out of synch, it still rocks.",1278979200,,324,3.9692307692307693

4126303,4,B003ICWTR4,"I have seen and reviewed several Springsteen videos over the years and I must say that this is one of the finestcaptures of a Springsteen concert that I have seen. From its beginning in broad daylight with a cover of the Clash's London Calling to the final notes of Dancing in the Dark some three hours later this set captures all of the energy and enthusiasm of an evening spent with the Boss.

The show is provided across two DVD's that did not show any of the sonic problems of earlier releases. The sound and picture quality is a constant.  The somg selection is a nice mix of the catalogue through the years with a tad emphasis on the newer material but nuggets from the past do arise fairly frequently in this show.

This is a low priced concert that is definately woth the price of admission and the evening provides a good dose of hard hitting rock and roll played to perfection by one of the best band working today.

See it.",1278892800,2,934,4.381502890173411
4126304,4,B003ICWTR4,"I don't know why so many people are raving about the audio portion of this blu ray disc. It sounds like it was recorded in the middle of the Hyde Park crowd using a single microphone on a mediocre recorder. Maybe that's the goal of the engineer, but I was expecting something better than that. Aside from the sax and guitar solos, everything else about the instruments seems indistinct. The voices come across very well, though. What redeems the disc is Bruce himself - as always he gives the crowd its money's worth and more, putting on a tireless performance of a well-chosen set of songs. Despite the audio quality lacking (in my opinion), I was still smiling when watching this because the songs themselves are so good and so is the performance.",1278720000,4,749,4.639097744360902

The sweat, passion, sincerity and unbelievable energy these guys put out in every performance is captured in all its majestic glory with this DVD, as well as showing a Bruce concert in its entirety for the first time in a commercial release.  When you see one of their shows, you are drained of every human emotion by the time it ends.  And in a wonderful way.  Thank you, guys, for putting this out.",1278115200,11,613,4.536363636363636

I've been a fan since '75 and saw him OPEN for Chicago Transit Authority in 1973 at Madison Square Garden, so I've seen dozen of shows from New York to Las Vegas to Cleveland to Philadelphia. Watching this is as close up as a fan get get without being on stage. Since he changed set lists at every show on the recent tour, this compilation has some fine versions of oldies and new ones.
If he includes the full concert version of the ""Darkness"" album when the anniversary set is released later this year, I'll be satisfied.",1278115200,7,620,4.447368421052632

I have the New York and Barcelona concerts, and while both are very good, this one knocks me over. Put on Rosalita and watch The Boss command the stage like no other.

4126313,5,B003ICWTR4,"The first official DVD of an outdoor Springsteen show is by leaps and bounds the best Bruce DVD so far, bootleg or official.  The outdoor setting and the gigantic Hyde Park crowd completely change the perspective on the show from any previous DVD.  You can see deep, deep, deep into the crowd unlike the previous indoor show DVDs.  And so many of Bruce's most loved songs tap into the summer evening vibe that this is the best setting they have ever had.  To see Jungleland at dusk sent chills down my spine. There has been a bootleg in circulation of an outdoor show in Berlin from the TOL tour, taken from a German television network's feed, but this DVD's production values blow that one away.  The picture quality, the number of shots, the number of cameras, the number of stage hands and staff, the number of songs, the covers of London Calling and Good Lovin - this is a the first show to capture the sprawling, wild, innocent magnificence of a Bruce Springsteen outdoor show. A very special treasure for Bruce fans.",1277596800,7,1022,4.593406593406593
4126314,5,B003ICWTR4,"How anyone could rate this any less than 5 stars mystifies me. I've been a fan since 1975 when ""Born to Run"" was a new album and have stuck with Bruce through thick and thin. I've seen him solo and with the E-Street Band 9 times since 1978, have about 25 live shows on CDs and LPs and this DVD is nothing short of brilliant. One of the highest-energy performances I've ever seen from the man and the song selection is incredible. The cover of ""London Calling"" must be making Joe Strummer smile from beyond (and it's not that well-known that Joe was a huge Bruce admirer) and the closing video of ""Wrecking Ball"" is spine-tingling.

Over the years I've known many people who just never ""got"" Springsteen, but they've never doubted the quality of his work. If a show like this can't turn you into a believer, then nothing will. BTW, the video and audio quality are fine throughout, so I don't know what some of these reviewers here are expecting.

If this really is the last we hear from the E-Street Band (and I'll bet it isn't), then they're going out on the highest note possible.",1277596800,7,1081,4.454545454545454

4126317,5,B003ICWTR4,"First, its a stunning bluray quality picture!  This by far is the best live show picture quality I have ever seen.  Like someone said you can read the mouth piece from the Big Man's sax.

Second, its a great show.  Full Springsteen ahead!  This by far in my opinion is the best live show Bruce and E street has released.  Yes, Bruce's voice has become even more rasp, but come on, he's 60.

Third, this show captures the power as close as anything to being their in person.

Forth, the only negative....  Its obvious Bruce didn't like being so far away from the crowd.  Thats not typical Bruce, he likes the crowd interaction and it was a long ways from the stage to the crowd at Hyde.

Final, if you have never seen Bruce and E street in person, spend the money and go see him.  You see it in this DVD at 3 hours, and he plays that long at every show and puts forth all the effort you see in this DVD at every show.

No I don't work for Landu.... That comment is too funny!",1277251200,67,974,4.117021276595745

The 163 min recording encompasses songs from his massive  repertoire including favourites ""No Surrender"" & ""Hard Times (Come Again No More)"" among others (the usual suspects). Rarities in this 2 DVD set include ""Trapped"" (Jimmy Cliff),"" Good Lovin'"" (The Young Rascals) & ""London Calling"" (The Clash). As usual with ""The Boss"" Bruce Springsteen & E-Street Band,the performance is impressive (but not spectacular, as compared to shows like 'Live in Barcelona', released in 2003) but visuals are rather breathtaking (as recorded in HD). The set has however only two tracks from ""Working On A Dream"" : ""Outlaw Pete"" & ""Working On A Dream"". One would have expected more tracks from the new album as promo!

4126321,3,B003ICWTR4,"While Mr Springsteen and his band of merry musicians have earned their spot in the pantheon of popular music, their propensity to haul out the same show periodically needs to be put to rest. There is enough media for the uninitiated to get a sense of where they've come from and provide a drop of variety to the performance. Bruce has earned the right to explore many avenues as he has on the Seeger sessions, Nebraska, and so on without having to resort to the jukebox hero performances that have come to highlight his most recent efforts. Energy and passion are high at any show in any venue where he performs and it is doubtful that this will ever change. I'm waiting for the wordplay of his first two releases to make a return to his writing but that's one fool's opinion. Finally, I struggle to understand how he and his camp missed the irony of bloated millionaires trying to perform London Calling with any urgency or relevance the original group unleashed on an unsuspecting world.
