8171693,4,B000MTANPQ,"The synopsis is misleading.  This isn't some formulaic action thriller.  While a single attempt is made to kill John Collins, it's not the theme of the film.  This is an OUTSTANDING character study.  You may've known guys like John, and wondered whether there's really anyone inside.  In Skip Tracer, you find out.  Some of the actors are weak, but this is David Peterson's Hamlet.  He is unforgettable in the title role.

Available only in used VHS tape format.  Until recently there was only a single $75 offering on Amazon.  I kept checking back, until a reasonably priced ($15) videotape appeared.

A word of caution:  If you buy a 30+ year old videotape, carefully watch it during the return period.  Some of these elderly VHS tapes develop ""bleed-through"" of signal from adjacent loops of tape on the reels, causing annoying ghost images.",1343174400,,844,4.900709219858156
