8627536,5,B00GU05N7O,"This is wonderful. I saw it on TV, recorded it for my brother his wife to enjoy when they visited. They were thrilled with it and immediately want it. Luckily I found it on Amazon and ordered it for him. He told me he has shared it with several others. Made him very happy.",1493251200,,273,4.074074074074074

8627538,1,B00GU05N7O,"I saw this program on PBS and loved it.  BUT the DVD Amazon sent was DEFECTIVE, so I returned it for a replacement which was also DEFECTIVE.  To add insult to injury, Amazon charged me for returning the second DEFECTIVE DVD.  I am an unhappy customer because not only was I disappointed a second time with the replacement DVD, but when I decided to give up and get a credit, Amazon deducted approximately $3 from the purchase price for the return -- granted, not a lot, but irritating nonetheless, especially as I have been unable to figure out how to contact Amazon to complain about it.  So, to sum up, the program itself is terrific and deserves five stars.  The one star is for the poor quality of both DVDs and for Amazon's service.  Do not buy this from Amazon.",1453680000,,767,4.442857142857143

8627540,5,B00GU05N7O,Isaw this as a special on PBS and I knew that I had to have a copy for my collection. It was amazing how they were able to perform some of the song that I would never dream of by the bells and I love the humor! It is a great Christmas show to watch with your family!,1425513600,2,266,3.603448275862069
8627541,5,B00GU05N7O,We had seen this on PBS and loved it and that is why we ordered it from Amazon and gave it as a gift. Really interesting and uplifting.,1421107200,,135,3.857142857142857
8627542,5,B00GU05N7O,"I belong to our church handbell choir, and  can't get enough of the Raleigh Ringers.  They only have 2 DVD's to date and I have them both.  The group is incedible.  In addition to their astounding musical talent, they are amazingly entertaining.  I hope they do more DVDs because while their CD's are great to listen to, seeing them is a tremendous treat.  Even if you don't play handbells, this DVD (and their first one too) is well worth purchasing.  It's great for the whole family.",1413417600,,485,4.569767441860465
8627543,5,B00GU05N7O,So amazing to watch!  Showed it to young handbell ringers and they were impressed!,1410998400,,82,4.857142857142857
