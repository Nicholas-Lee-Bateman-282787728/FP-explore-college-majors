8465120,5,B005CCT16U,Enjoying the history of WWII. Learning many new facts about the war I was never taught. The actual film footage puts realism in anew light that Hollywood seems to leave out. Great history lesson!,1502236800,,195,4.764705882352941
8465121,5,B005CCT16U,Great for WW11 history buffs,1487203200,,28,4.8
8465122,5,B005CCT16U,I enjoyed this series very much.  It really helps one to understand the scope and intensity of the Pacific war.  Most WWII documentaries are about the European theater of the war so this was a welcome addition to my collection.,1458604800,,227,4.65
8465123,5,B005CCT16U,"This item was purchased as a gift, I cannot rate it appropriately",1455235200,,65,4.5
8465124,1,B005CCT16U,"First of all it is not a boxed set. You get two disc in one plastic case. The titles of the episodes on the back are not all correct and there are misspellings which makes me wonder what kind of quality to the actual DVDs are. Well, if you can watch them on Amazon Prime then do that, but if not these are OK. I watched as many as I could on Prime and watched the others from the disc. I wish they had put a bit more effort into the DVDs and into the labeling and packaging.

Later: When we watched more of these we found that some of the titles are missing and are mislabeled. For instance the program labeled ""The Road Back: New Guinea"" was actually the first program in the series again and that episode is missing altogether. It is a disappointment and I would not recommend you buy this. Other sets of these programs are more expensive, but worth since this set is unreliable and the quality is not that great. When you put 26 episodes on one DVD it makes for pretty poor quality: very pixelated. Save yourself some grief and get a decent set of these programs.

The programs themselves are very good to get a good overview of the war in the Pacific and I highly recommend the series, just not this version.",1430697600,4,1212,4.242424242424242
8465125,3,B005CCT16U,The problem with this set is not in content but in presentation.  There are too many episodes on two dvd's.  The picture pixelates quite often and forget visual details because of the poor transfer.  I saw one of these episodes (Battle for Peleliu) on Amazon's Prime streaming.  The visual quality on Amazon Prime was 10 times better than the dvd version.,1427846400,2,355,4.770491803278689
8465126,4,B005CCT16U,"It is pretty cool for what it was and when it was done. The sound effects are hokey and irritating. But for WW II aficionados it is worthwhile. I did get it on Amazon but also acquired  it at WalMart as a $2.99 bundle including the ""Crusade in Europe"".",1420243200,,252,4.142857142857143
8465127,5,B005CCT16U,"I enjoy watching WWII movies.  I've watch many movies/documentaries on the European conflict.  The Pacific War was just as brutal, albeit much different terrain.",1390262400,,161,5.666666666666667
