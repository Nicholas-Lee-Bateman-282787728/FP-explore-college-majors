2849351,1,B000QXCP54,"Once again, we have a program that tells only of the trageies that befell the Greeks. But not much is said of how the Greek Army invaded Turkey in 1919 -- as a surrogate force for the British -- and began to massacre Turks in its drive toward Ankara. Not much is said about how Mustafa Kemal and his Turkish nationalist army stopped the Greeks and forced them back toward Izmir, or how the Greeks massacred thousands of more Turks on their retreat. (Arnold Toynbee reported on atrocities/massacres committed by Greeks.)
 As with the Armenians, there is more to this story than a ""genocide"" committed by the Turks. The historical record indicates that all sides were guilty in a bloodbath that lasted many years in the late Ottoman Empire. Armenians and Greeks have a difficult time with the gruesome history of their own ancestors, preferring to blame Turks as the ""other"", the enemy responsible for all the horror.
 That horror is a shared one. Western audiences need to understand the simple fact that most programs (like this one) about ""genocides"" committed against Greeks and Armenians are propaganda...not carefully researched chronicles of the historical reality. Hundreds of thousands of Turks and other Muslims were tortured and massacred by Greeks and Armenians during the World War I era. Shall we also call that a genocide?",1182988800,8,1335,4.982062780269058
2849352,1,B000QXCP54,"I'm a ""greek"" Cypriot. Greece invaded Turkey and was defeated. Unfortunately the Greek community of Asia Minor paid the bitter prize of this defeat.
This documentary does not show the atrocities the Greek invading army committed against the Turks.
In 1974 Greece did the same in Cyprus . It overthrew our elected government and opened the door for the Turkish invasion. Greece was defeated once more. One third of our population who still live as refugees in our own land paid a dear prize. For both ""olokaftomata"" I blame Greece more than Turkey.",1181520000,9,547,4.89247311827957
2849353,4,B000QXCP54,"The interviews with survivors of the Greek Holocaust are real and gripping and easily overcome the less-than-Hollywood standard production values.  The emotional stories come through loud and clear and that is what is most important.  The topic is especially important as few people, other than Greeks and Turks, know about it.",1179792000,17,327,5.392156862745098

8197905,1,B000QXCP54,"You would NOT expect a professor, assuming Prof. Kapetanopoulos is a professor, to create a documentary without referring to primary sources or including any citations.  This video is an attack on the legacy of those who suffered as much as it is an attack on common sense.  The microphone seemingly finds itself in front of anyone willing to speak at a mishmash of Greek Independent day parades.  None of the speakers have any first hand knowledge nor are they citing sources.

What is terrifying is that this terribly made video cost money and someone paid to gift it to me, under the false pretense that it was a documentary of the horrors my ancestors had gone through.  Expecting a serious historical documentary to paint the picture of years of the Armenian and Greek genocide, I was floored and appalled to find this childish production of comedic proportions.  There are no historians, nor are there primary sources, including any documents that were and are abundantly available.

Not only is there a lack of knowledge or information being presented from start to finish, but there is a tremendous lack of structure to this hobbled and lazy production.  What you are left with is a series of elderly Greek and Greek-American people that are either baffled by ridiculous questions or outraged about something they neither studied nor lived through.

The most tragic part about this disaster video besides the fact that it is misleading to those expecting a serious documentary, is that it appears to have been compiled in 1993.  In 1993 the genocide was roughly 70 years old and many of the surviving witnesses of the genocide were still alive.  However, the ""professor"" wastes that golden opportunity by interviewing people with no actual knowledge of the events.  The few people old enough to have lived through the events are instead asked pointless generalized questions and not about their own personal experiences.

Considering that the events of the genocide were never presented in an organized fashion, this video is a complete and total waste of time.  It is insulting to those willing to learn about the events that took place in 1915-1922 that Prof. Kapetanopoulos considers this garbage to be educational.

Thank you Professor, because of this garbage, my ancestors are turning in their graves.  If you truly cared about the events that took place, you would have documented them, in an organized, educated, scientific, historical, and professional fashion.

If I want to watch random and terrible, home-made videos, I would watch my own.",1422144000,2,2559,5.040380047505939
8197906,1,B000QXCP54,"It is deceptive advertising to show a picture of Smyrna burning and then show us a film that mainly consists of people at a number of demonstrations that have to do with Greek objections to the name of the former Macedonian Republic of Yugoslavia.  There was absolutely no fim footage of the burning of Smyrna even though such footage exists. This advertisement together with the title, ""Greek Holocaust 1915-1922"" confuses this amateurish home movie with another professionally created film that has been circulating in movie theatres in Greece and in the USA that contains first party footage.  This film contains second and third hand accounts, often inaccurate.  This film also contains blatant inaccuracies, spouted by an elderly gentleman who was obviously suffering from some physical malady and by the professor wh0 made the film. Firstly, Kemal Ataturk's mother was not Jewish, she was a devout Muslim. Secondly, the Spanish Inquisition was not the result of Jews secretly pretending to be Christians. Numerous Jews pretended to be Christians because they were persecuted by the Inquisition. Their secrecy was the result of the Inquisition, not a cause.
The elderly sick gentlemen suggested that the Greek army reluctantly disembarked in Smyrna in 1919, as a result of pressure from Lloyd George and  Woodrow Wilson. While said landing was at the urging of the British in order to head off an Italian occupation of Asia Minor, the Greeks under Venizelos were enthusiastic participants of the invasion. It should have occurred to the elderly gentleman who was relating the accusation that if the Greeks were not ready for an invasion of Smyrna, they would not have had the Greek army aboard ships in Smyrna harbor. I believe that Amazon should have researched this film and known of the existence of the professionally produced film about this very serious and forgotten tragic episode of the 20th Century. TO NOT HAVE DONE SO IS  FALSE ADVERTISING AND I DEMAND A REFUND FOR THIS REASON.",1387584000,9,1995,5.08868501529052
8197907,2,B000QXCP54,"Turks were in Anatolia since 1200s and they had the total control of region for almost since 1400s .When Ottoman Empire collapsed it was a good time for Greeks to save their Asia Minor but they failed. It was a war. Not a holocaust.
Greeks started loosing the war when France, Italy left occupied territories and became neutral to the Greek-Turco war..NOT when they started selling weapons to Turks. Greeks was being supported by UK and other countries since the beginning of the war.

 It is sad for a nation being a part of another nation for over 400 years. This  is the grounding of hatred for Turks.

Islam is not a religion of peace(this is a BS) but Turks were very tolerant (for its time) to the nations they occupied. This was major reason  why the Empire lasted over 600 years.

Just a simple question, if they were not tolerant, how more than 20 nations could have kept their religion and national values.",1294358400,,916,4.554878048780488
8197908,3,B000QXCP54,"First of all the Armenian and Greek genocide happened before the invasion/liberation of asia minor this was our land 500yrs prior before the turks arrived in the 1300s , for thousands of years Greeks lived there .Just as your precious israel was before being occupied by the palestinan arabs yet you invaded /liberated there as well in 1948 right ???. Do not be a hypocrite . In 1915-1919 the genocide happened"" before"" the Greeks landed in asia minor .The Greek army was sent and allowed to go there by Britian , France and the USA . We were winning the war ""UNTIL"" France and Italy decided to sell all their weapons to the turks . The Greek army was 50 miles outside of ankara . After fighting continously from the balkan warsin europe , as well as WWI till 1922 the army was exhausted , and over extended and was eventually defeated . But remember the provacation for the Greek army being in Asia Minor was to relieve the suffering of the christian minority there, both Armenian and Greek Both sides did bad things to each other and as a Greek i do not hate turks regardless of what happened 85 yrs ago .Do not distort history . Got it.... good .",1225324800,11,1149,4.4245283018867925
8197909,5,B000QXCP54,"This is a documentary on historical facts, using primary sources for information. History cannot be changed to suit whatever interests someone has today. As for the people that claim that Greece invaded Turkey, they should be reminded of the fact that what they now call Turkey was part of Hellenism for centuries -- the population in Asia Minor was Greek, this is another fact of the Hellenistic history and culture. Of course, today NOTHING reminds us of those very recent times, that is a job that the Turks know how to do very well -- i.e., genocide, killings of the innocent, and ethnic cleansing.
The same process was followed in Constantinople, Pontos, Cyprus, and all of Asia Minor.
That's for history's sake -- Smyra was just stolen from its Hellenic population, let's not forget that fact!!!! The truth is always hard to accept.",1221868800,13,838,4.8671328671328675
8197910,1,B000QXCP54,"Even the title of this so called documentary is ridicoulus. Greeks invaded Turkey and they got beaten, how is this genocide??? It seems that anyone these days can put out a DVD and call themselves a historian. So, you are going to invade a nation, get beaten by them, get kicked out, and you are going to turn around and say, they committed genocide because after we invaded their land they didn't allow us to beat them...how dare they fight against us, we just came to occupy their land, why are they killing us, we don't understand it?

8197912,1,B000QXCP54,"This is not a documentary it is interviews at some damn parade. There was not a lot of information when this product became available and I thought someone had made a film like the armenians have about the history and what happened at that time. I tried to watch this cd, but lost interest very quickly. I have tried to watch it several times, but what the heck don't waste your money. I will never buy a product ever again that does not have more info. I am the child of a survivor and I would have been happier if you had used more info from survivors and some pictures from smyrni and made it more like a documentary. If you see the cover of the cd that is what really fooled me. Well live and learn.
