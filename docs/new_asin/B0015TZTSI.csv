8259857,5,B0015TZTSI,One of the best westerns of all time from the Indians point of view.,1436486400,,68,3.9285714285714284
8259858,5,B0015TZTSI,"I'm very pleased with this fine movie.  It is filled with good acting, lots of action, and a good story from the Indians' point of view.  I give it 5 Stars in some measure because of the astounding DVD quality.  The widescreen format really showcases the rich, deep, vibrant colors and crisp photography.  Highly recommended.  The only detraction (and it's minor) is Victor Mature's age vs. his squaw played by Suzan Ball, who is a full 20+ years younger than he.  One cowboy-Indian fight made me chuckle.  About 2/3 into the film, Chief Crazy Horse manages to split up the cavalry and steal their ammunition.  With all the bullets now owned by the Indians, they attack the remaining troopers twice.  In their first attack you see two troopers immediately die:  one falls off a wagon toward the camera and the other guy is shot off his horse.  Then the Indians regroup and quickly charge a second time.  In the opening salvo of the second charge, guess who the first two guys to die are?  Yup, the same two troopers.  They used the same footage from the first charge.",1430870400,,1067,4.6063829787234045
8259859,5,B0015TZTSI,Who said this version of the audio is only in German  its also in ENGLISH.  I was very shocked that they sent this order out so quickly  than I anticipated.  I would recommend this movie to everyone because we only see the Indians always losing and never winning. I am  always for the underdog and this picture quality is excellent.,1419724800,,332,4.466666666666667
8259860,2,B0015TZTSI,"I spent less than $10.00 for the DVD, but I spent over thirty dollar in returning it because it was in German not English.  I would be nice to get a English one because the story was done very well and it show the Native America side of a great Native America Chief who did much for his people.",1399852800,,294,3.983050847457627
8259861,1,B0015TZTSI,"Haven't viewed it yet,,all the writing is in German I hope that it is English, otherwise not much good for me..wil let you know...it did arrive today...Very disappointed the movie was in German and the disk did not fit my player. This was not mentioned in the write up when reviewed to order.",1360281600,,292,4.528301886792453
8259862,5,B0015TZTSI,"I've seen my share of PAL DVDs, but this production is by far one of the best in quality I've ever seen.  The company that produced it is clearly a serious one, in that the film is re-mastered to the highest standards.  It's well worth the money, since it's clear that there won't be an American release for some time, if at all.",1328140800,5,329,4.2063492063492065
