7814067,5,6301694163,"I first saw this movie on TV, and was later able to get it on VHS. A DVD version finally became available, but it was in Region 2, PAL format which meant it wouldn't play in the US. I finally got an All-Regions DVD player and watched it. I love the movie. It's about a former Army Captain who served in Vietnam. Years later, when he was married and had 2 children, a Vietnamese woman approached him and identified herself as the woman he had had an affair with when he was in Vietnam. He also found out that he had a son by her which he didn't know about. To make matters worse, the boy's mother was dying from leukemia and the boy had no other family. The man finally tells his wife about the boy and she is very upset and doesn't want to deal with the news. Wayne Rogers (from M*A*S*H) played the man. I also loved Bryan Price who played the little boy Quan. He was one of the most beautiful kids I have ever seen. This movie is based on a true story. The acting was great and the story was very moving. I wish it would get released on a Region 1 DVD so more people could see it. It really is a great movie.",1439078400,,1109,4.02262443438914
7814068,5,6301694163,"Wayne Rogers (Trapper Mcintyre from T.V's M.A.S.H.) gives a polished, restrained performance as a Houston family man, working for his father in law's construction company, whose present is suddenly rearranged by his past. When serving as an interpreter in the Vietnam war ten years earlier, Craig Weston had an affair. Now back home with his wife and daughters, he is contacted by his former lover, who tells him he has a son, Quan, who he never knew. Rogers shows Craig's discomfiture at discovering this, and that his lover is dying, and wants him to adopt Quan, in a very palpable manner. His wife Janet, (Bonnie Bedelia - Homecoming) is caught between her love for her husband and her love for her caring yet controlling and prejudiced father, who holds the purse strings and refuses to have an asian child in the family. On the whole, very well executed.",1353196800,,859,4.8108108108108105
7814069,5,6301694163,This movie arrived quickly as promised and in excellent condition.  I first saw this move on television in 1984 but I did not see all of it.  I was hoping it would come back to television but it never did. In the 80's I went to Blockbuster but they did not have it and it was not even in their book where it could be ordered. I then called movie companies across the country and all said they did not have it any longer as it was made for tv only. For over 25 years it could not be found at all anywhere.  One day I was reviewing other movies from amazon and I took a chance of checking to see if they had this and sure enough there it was. I was surprised. I liked the movie and now go to amazon for any dvd or cd first.,1310428800,,721,3.825503355704698
7814070,3,6301694163,"Craig Weston (Wayne Rogers) is happily married to Janet (Bonnie Bedelia), whose father (Pat Hingle) is Wayne's boss and owner of a large Houston-based international construction firm.  The couple has two young daughters, a beautiful home in Houston, and a secure future, but all of this might be expunged after a Vietnamese woman with whom Craig had a love affair in Saigon during the War there, ten years prior, arrives in Texas to confront him with a surprise package - a son from their liaison, along with a request to assume custody of the youth because she is dying of leukemia.  It becomes immediately clear that this is an unabashed melodrama in the trite soap opera manner but, because of strong contributions from cast and crew, there are few dull passages, the actors giving their best efforts to pull what they can from what is rather weak material, with the accomplished Bedelia gaining performing honours for her intensely detailed turn as Craig's bewildered wife, whose comfortable existence is challenged by unexpected events.  Direction by Robert Day is leisurely as is appropriate for milking the tepid screenplay, and production quality for this piece made for television is generally high, particularly noteworthy efforts coming from dependable Mark Snow for his illustrative scoring, and from Judy Summers for well-crafted designing and employment of colour, while editor Ira Heyman in his final assignment and costumer Donna Barrish in her first are quite skillful, and whereas substantial cutting does not serve to elevate the below standard and predictable storyline, it makes of this fare a satisfactory experience for a viewer.",1123891200,,1652,5.226415094339623
