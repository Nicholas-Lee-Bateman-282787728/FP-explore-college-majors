8221696,1,B000W90L8U,"This review is for the Synergy Archive Series version. I a word - crap. I was hoping to get, not necessarily a restored version, but at least a decent transfer. The picture is blurry, dark and red tinged. For the price I was very disappointed. I will be returning this version, because I got one just as good (and including Nightmare Castle) from EastWestDVD for half the cost. It's a shame, because I actually like this movie. Maybe someday somebody will put together a decent copy of this and other 60's Italian Gothic movies.",1391126400,3,528,4.627659574468085
