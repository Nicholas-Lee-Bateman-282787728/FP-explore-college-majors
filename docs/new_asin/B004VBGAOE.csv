4482321,5,B004VBGAOE,"I have just finished watching The Last Curtain Call for the 2nd time.  The music is stunning, breathtaking and simply amazing.  I never was able to see this band live and it is hard to believe they are not selling millions of copies of their records. The dvd is mixed well with all instruments and vocals sounding clear.  The track listing covers songs from their entire career.  If you are a fan of gothic melodic doom metal, do yourself a favor and buy this DVD.  You will not be sorry.  I will watch this one again and again.  Their majestic sound is powerful yet calming at the same time.  The female leads voice (Nell)is exceptional. I cannot say enough about the profound effect this band has had on me over the past decade. Highlights include Hide and Seek, Ashes and Dreams, Hollow, Venue, Fade and the very emotional Forever Is The World.  It would be impossible to find a bad track on this disc. The video is clear and well done and the sound is fantastic.  For fans of Within Temptation, Leaves Eyes, Revamp and so many others..run do not walk to your store and demand this release. 5 stars and I would give them 6 if it was allowed.",1310688000,15,1144,4.404761904761905

4482324,5,B004VBGAOE,This is my favorite of TOT's albums. Not a single track can be skipped on this album and it is a shame they haven't released new albums lately,1399161600,,142,4.107142857142857
4482325,5,B004VBGAOE,"I wasn't familiar with any TOT material except for ""Storm"", but that is about to change.  This DVD is simply stunning and it grows and grows on you. The opening track, ""Hide and Seek"" really sets the tone of this DVD, but there are many more highlights, such as ""Lorelei"", ""Venus"", ""Hollow"", ""Fade"", the infectious ""Machine"" and ""Forever is the world"". I have an extensive music DVD collection of bands such as Nightwish, Dream Theater and Within Temptation, and this is as good as it gets!",1386288000,3,490,4.6976744186046515
4482326,5,B004VBGAOE,"I own every ToT album and this DVD is so good. I was not expecting much in production value when I purchased this DVD, as I learned that donations was needed to complete this DVD. To my surprise, the sound and picture is excellent. Excellent song selections, interviews, and rehearsals. Nell is perfect on the classic slections originally sung by Liv. Since this was there only DVD during there whole career, I wished they had added all there videos on here, would have been the complete ToT package.",1365897600,5,500,4.693181818181818

Lo nico malo es la caja, esta con el tiempo se daa al ser en cartn y no tener ninguna proteccin.

4482329,5,B004VBGAOE,"My first exposure to Theatre of Tragedy. Love the rich operatic sound of Venus, the heavy guitar rock conclusion of Hollow, and the energy of Storm. DVD is well worth waiting for (rather than just downloading mp3 album).",1334361600,2,220,4.815789473684211
4482330,5,B004VBGAOE,"To be honest...i gave up on this band after the musique release. Always was and still am a huge fan of their early stuff.
This dvd is outstanding! This is how i would like to remember Theatre of Tragedy... doom and dark...excellent quality on both audio and video. Just a jaw dropping show! Any fan or musician needs this dvd!",1329609600,7,326,4.45

8443194,5,B004VBGAOE,"In this day and age, it isn't really necessary to describe what a music DVD is like, when you can just watch clips of it on YouTube.  Nonetheless I will express my personal comments and opinions about this DVD package (which includes a CD of the concert as well!)

I really enjoy the beautiful and dark Gothic sound of Theatre of Tragedy here. Nells angelic vocals are inspiring. Raymonds gruff growling vocals are an effective contrast to Nells, in classic beauty and the beast styling.  I get a kick out of the fact that the band looks clean cut and absolutely normal, even approachable, while playing music that is savage as well as soothing. Its a plus that Nell looks quite attractive. The keys add a lot to the sound, and seeing the musicians gave me an extra appreciation for the music.

Im glad I bought this combo CD/DVD!",1521331200,,830,4.550335570469799
8443195,5,B004VBGAOE,"Let me start by saying that I have been a HUGE TOT fan for a lot of years, and even with the departure of Liv Kristine, and the entrance of Nell Sigland (which is a phenomenal vocalist btw) I still never wavered and even understood some of the differences within the band that they faced. This DVD is the 1st, last, and only DVD concert release that they put out and though many on here will gripe about sound, picture, or it not cooking them breakfast in bed, while massaging their over exaggerated egos, I firmly believe and is my opinion that this DVD is definitely a must have for every TOT, and any fan of this genre. The picture quality is great (no it's not HD, or 4K or anywhere close) but is watchable and normal DVD quality, the sound to me is simply perfect with the 5.1 mixdown. I wish I would have been there at that show to witness the last and very memorable performance as it is spectacular to watch on this DVD. Nell's performance along with Raymond's is spot on and you can tell that it was an emotional performance for them, even when singing the older songs. I actually appreciate and love Nell's versions of Liv Kristine's songs! Lorentz, Frank, Vegard & Hein Frode's signature music is very powerful and as a musician myself, I could tell that they put everything into that performance and without missing a note or signature nuances that makes Theatre Of Tragedy so unique and stands out from all the rest. The one song that really moved me was their performance of the song: ""Fade,"" simply heartfelt and powerful and to me way better than the studio version, especially Hein's drumming, which was more up-front and hard hitting than on the studio album. The behind the scenes interviews, extras, and rare practice sessions are a blast to watch as it shows a side of TOT that you may not have ever known. I really appreciate their humbleness as musicians that are doing what they love to do and take the time for their fans as much as possible! The bonus CD (IMO) should have been the duplicate of the DVD as far as list of songs, but it's missing 8 songs on the CD that was on the DVD but otherwise good. If you are look at this DVD and wondering if you should purchase this, seriously, don't hesitate just buy it! Even though TOT is no longer making music, this and their entire catalog of albums from ""Velvet Darkness"" to ""Forever Is The World"" and every one in between, has made it's mark on the music industry and a league of fans across the world. They may be gone now, but will Never be forgotten.",1519776000,,2527,4.413276231263383
8443196,5,B004VBGAOE,"I loved this show, not as full of sound as Nightwish or Epica but a decent show. My dvd freezes up on one song but otherwise plays fine...",1515974400,,138,3.9642857142857144

8443198,5,B004VBGAOE,"This was a great find.  The sound was so good you could understand the female vocals which is not always easy, and the videography was excellent.  Musically they will appeal to a wider range of listeners then some of the more radical of the Goth Medal genres.  As with many European groups they sing in English.",1456012800,2,311,4.517857142857143
