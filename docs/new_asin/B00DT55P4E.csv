8597386,5,B00DT55P4E,"A shrew, thoughtful gangster flick.
Screenplay produces a driving, intense plot and makes character motivations real.
The narrative style overlaying the visuals is a crafty way to introduce characters, explain motivations and orient the viewer to London Gangster's reality.

Violence only when the plot requires.
Characters are nuanced, and layered.  It doesn't take long before viewer is swept up in the multiple struggles of the two protagonists.

Casting was flawless. Each character looks exactly like he or she should look. They are dressed the way you would expect them to dress. The camera loved the protagonists and their cohorts
each of whom has a problem they need to fix.

This film outdoes gangster movie  like the Krays, The Long Good Friday and Layer Cake.

This movie was titled ""St. George's Day"" in England and ""Berlin Job"" in the states.

Frank Harper produced the screenplay, did the directing and stars. I don't know if the also did the casting but who knows.",1396915200,6,979,5.043478260869565
8597387,1,B00DT55P4E,"1. The usual shoot a few people then blow up your getaway car for no reason but makes good movie effects.
2. The usual over the hill drug mobsters with lots of young females to boost their egos and provide visual candy to hide a poor script.
3. Usual club party scenes with people acting tough in a writer's stereotypic cloistered imagination - acting tough with posing and every four letter word beginning with ""f"" - that dialogue film crutch got old decades ago. The usual close up shots of bad guy tats (tattoos if you didn't know).
4. The usual drug sale goes bad and the usual Russians are upset. Help, I'm choking on unimaginative redundancy.
5. The usual hood brothers as drug transporters. The usual white lawyer type guy as intermediary between groups.
6. Usual tricky ending where the over-the-hill mobsters stroll away from the usual dumb cops.
7. Almost forgot, how can you not have a diamond heist. Yes, one of those is tossed in.
8. Bad acting; low budget as found in poor audio level control and no subtitles. English is a base language in many parts of the world, but regional dialects, enunciations and descriptive words vary so much that listening to those variations can be as daunting as a completely different language.",1383782400,7,1240,4.692660550458716
