7827011,5,6302484758,"I loved the Bway version of Silk Stockings but it was never recorded to vhs so I got the Astaire/Charisse version on cd and it was very good.  What's not to like with those two dancing and singing along with Peter Lorre as a Russian courier.  The other two movies were also excellent. If you like Astaire, this should be a must for your collection.",1388016000,,348,4.338461538461538
