If you were expecting a serious treatment of September 11, Afghanistan, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and/or Osama Bin Laden, then you will be utterly disappointed with the September Tapes.

On the other hand, if you enjoy excessively dramatized documentaries that ooze with hokey dialog, transparent story lines and bogus sentimentality...",1106870400,8,388,5.344262295081967

2175206,2,B00068CUO0,"Initially I thought this was a joke. A Spinal Tap goes to war. Why? Because the hero and his sidekick, ""Wali,"" seem so ridiculously inept. Over the top.  The hero seems momentarily spastic and nerdy, and then to have this death wish which then moves him into Rambo territory. Only Rambo as imagined by a Lower East Side hipster. Which makes it obscene. But then somewhere in the movie... for me it was the battle scenes, where I started to get a sense of how violated everyone in the midst of a war zone becomes. Watching these bullets and rockets dancing through the night, vicious and also beautiful, left me feeling empty and sad. That life could be cut short within a second for people in the crossfire. In that respect, the movie is effective. Even if the characters are totally unbelievable.",1214524800,,797,4.612676056338028
2175207,2,B00068CUO0,"If you are an old vet like me and want to revisit Afghanistan then this is a good vessel for doing that.  I loved the images of Kabul, the Afghan countryside, the kids, etc. Lot of ""Oww! I've been there!"" moments for Marines and Soldiers who have served over there.
If you want to watch a good movie however (say...one with a plot?) then I would not recommend ""September Tapes.""  The whole (alleged) plot centers around an American reporter who is looking: 1.  To find a way to get himself killed, and 2. Track down Osama Bin Laden to get ""the real"" story of 9/11.  The Reporters constant stupidity resulted in a frustrating two hours of my constantly shouting at my TV.  Like a very predictable horror movie, you can always bet that our Hero will make the wrong decision whenever faced with what appears to the viewer to be an obvious choice.
Kind of entertaining, great ""real"" shots of Afghanistan and ""actors"" who appear to be genuine Afghans, but totally lacking in anything resembling a storyline or reality.",1208908800,,1013,4.636871508379889

I found this film emotional and gripping.  I enjoyed a lot of the ""insider"" moments, for people familiar with the culture and references, it is interesting.  I liked the ""blair witchyness"" of the film as the first comment crushed the film for..

I did find the ""secret"" audio (the main characters wife calling from Tower I prior to its collapse) an anti-climax to the film.  This could have been revealed from the start.  I believe the back cover of the DVD case describes this as the motivation for the characters quest ~ why bother saving this?  Overall I found this film emotionally connecting, not only on a sadness level, but I felt irritated, annoyed, etc...by some of the actions of the characters, I would say this film has excellent acting.

I watched this gilm shortly after its dvd release, it was timely and touching.  I think this film-writer created a film which sought out the hunt so many families have wanted to personally take...

The characters truly seem geniune, and the irriation and annoyance they experience with each other, themselves and the entire search adds depth to the storyline.

I consider this one of my favorite films.",1188000000,,1236,4.783018867924528
2175210,1,B00068CUO0,"I'm not sure if I found September tapes outrageously offensive, or just plain stupid--take your pick.  Opportunistic, psuedo war porn of the most insidious type--that which exploits true tragedy, and does so with the sensitivity, integrity and complexity of a pickle.  Schwarzenegger could have done 10 times better--at least he wouldn't have tried to mix tragic, complex, political realities with horrible action film bravado, truly uni-dimensional characters, absurd acting and pathetically trite plot ""revelations.""  The ""documentary"" falls apart after the first 15 minutes, and the only element of value left for the viewer is in trying to figure out what was real footage and what was manipulated and/or constructed as an exercise.  Unfortunately, any value that might have been found in the documentary footage has been completely eclipsed by the overall absurdity of the project and its opportunistic, shallow, self-important motives.  Oh yeah . . . the dialogue (especially the voice overs) . . . . it's like watching a middle class, suburban, white-boy tossing out phrases ""Whaz-up brother"" and ""damn dawg, you my nizzle"" and trying to pass it off as serious--not only serious, but dramatic, intense and engaging . . . .

As a young veteran who has done all of the previous things mentioned; this movie had my heart pumping. He did not turn into Rambo at the end. (granted this is a movie). Any soldier, whether they were a soldier for 2, 4, 9 years would be able to shoot a gun. Granted at times he sprayed and prayed. I don't want to spoil it, but at the end when he really gets kicking, I could see that. I know that if I went through the [...] he did, I'd be like that. It wouldnt be that hard. I guess you would have had to be in a situation similar. I thought the movie was real until the end. As a veteran, I'm not afraid to admit I cried at the end when I got to hear what he was playing on his IPOD. The ONLY thing I truly questioned was how he went so long with what seemed like minimal food and water. It's hot over there :P Again, that movie was spectacular.

2175212,5,B00068CUO0,"No, most big budget film productions like ""Syriana"" is little more than art imitating art, just being a movie that imitates the fictional (or should I say ""speculative,"" so as not to too deeply offend any liberal readers?) feel of other big budget films.  This friggin' movie is actual art!  Why?  Because it is actually art imitating life!  God knows what kind of brutality continues in Afghanistan to this day, and pardon my ""jingoism"" (or should I say, ""factual statement?"") but communist Russia failed to bring the Afghanis to capitulation; Great Britain failed to do the same thing...twice!  But America?  The Afghanis have had their first free elections in its entire thousands year long history because of those damn Yankees!  But I digress too offensively.  I should be talking about a movie, here.  And, I will say it was an excellent film. Maybe I was one of those turds that let himself get drawn into the ""Blair Witch Project"" movie (the sequel sucked), and going to the theater, I knew ""Blair Witch"" was fake.  It didn't stop me from letting myself get immersed into it.  When I started watching ""September Tapes,"" I had no idea that it was nothing more than a ""sensationalized"" documentary. I really did think it was real. Imagine how enraptured I was! Imagine my wondering about how a revelation of recovered tapes be so fantastically sensational not be placed more into the public spotlight, or get more MSM coverage?  In the end, I had to ask, is this real?  And THEN I saw the disclaimer, ""All characters and events are fictionalized, etc."" in the end credits, and I slapped myself in the head, laughing as the puzzle pieces came together.  No amount of excellent footage could be that decently compiled. I mean, I've been to Afghanistan. I'm a veteran. I should've asked myself why the folks in the southern regions were speaking Farsi and not Pashtu (which is actually what the majority in southern Afghanistan speak). No, I did not ask myself how the dude could suddenly become Rambo towards the end, because he stated earlier that he's been in the army, and believe it or not, the army can produce some pretty good shooters (ironically, many of the army jokers with the best marksmanship are usually the guys who haven't spent their whole childhood lives carrying a rifle, hunting...at least the ones in basic).

See, when I go home on leave, I'm going to show my sisters this film, but I'm not going to tell them it's fake. I think they will enjoy it as much as I did. And I hope there will be many others who enjoy it as well!",1149638400,3,2550,4.67337807606264

2175216,4,B00068CUO0,"This film is about three men who go to 'search' for Bin Laden.  Some portion of the film is acting while other parts are real.  it combines documentary with some hard to believe scenes and some bad monologue 'acting'.  This is the central problem here.  Although divided into 8 'tapes' the film is really set in three scenes.  The first is the most realistic, shot in Kabul.  The second, the lead up to the battle and its aftermath where the American character metamorphosis's into a combat soldier is problematic when you question its authenticity.

The last sequence is the most problematic with its 'Blair witch project' feel, toooo many night sequences! The parts that feel 'real' mix with the parts that are just too obviously staged. For one the RPG's being fired at them!

But why do many call this the 'worst film' or 'how not to shoot a film'?  This a disservice, as is calling it the 'osama witch project'.  The clear reasoning behind the deep seated hatred for the film is accusations that it is 'jingoistic' which is a pure fabrication given that the 'translator' spend the first third of the film explaining how we must 'understand the terrorist demands'.

Great footage of Afghanistan.  Truly realistic scenes of dealing with problems in other countries. It is a highly recommended film.  It is not as 'bad' as everyone claims.  Most will get through 2/3 of the footage with the feeling it is real, only about 1/3 has serious problems.  A truly brave and original concept.

2175217,5,B00068CUO0,"Here's the thing; if you are browsing the reviews of September Tapes on Amazon, you already know that it is a fictional movie, and not a documentary, which ruins it.  So it is too late for you to enjoy it, but not too late to pass it on to a friend.  If you watch this movie under the impression that it is a real documentary made from the found tapes of these three, it is an incredible experience, until 75% of the way through, when you start to think, ""Am I being had?""

A lot of the criticism of this movie in these reviews is pointless.  For example, many call it ""stupid"" to take a film crew into Afghanistan.  Who cares what you think?  Whether or not the crew did something dangerous should be of no concern to a viewer.  Repeat after me, ""I am not the moviemaker's mother. (Repeat).""

A second stupid criticism is that the movie disgraces people who died on 9/11.  Let me get this straight -- a fictional movie about the aftermath of 9/11 is offensive, but (I presume you would argue) our very own country basing an entire war, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians and two thousand Americans, on phony-baloney associations between 9/11 and Saddam Hussein is patriotic?

Second, the DVD feature where they show just how dangerous it was for them to shoot this movie. Everything else was pointless. Why fake being in danger when you really ARE in danger? They could have been killed so many times. Why not make a REAL documentary? And as for their fake documentary, it is so unbelievably stupid. Nobody in their right mind would think this is real. The guy who plays ""Lars"" is a bad actor and the script is just terrible. It starts out being something believable but then it turns into an action movie where Lars becomes Rambo.

The movie was so touching and to find out in the end that the thing that drove this man to go to Afghanistan was the death of his wife who was flying on one of the planes on September 11 was just touching.  This man lost his world that day and although this movie wasn't real they showed something that many American probably wanted to do that day.  He went out to find the man who killed his wife.  He didn't just sit by and let this happen to him.  He wanted to do something about it.  I don't think that anyone should run over and do something like what this character did.  This was a movie, but I am sure that many people who lost someone that day wanted to find Osama Bin Laden and ask him a few questions themselves.  This is a War on Terrorism and we are all fighting it together.  This movie just shows what the fight is like in Afghanistan and although it has been four years since 9-11, the search for Bin Laden is still on.",1127779200,4,997,4.0717948717948715

It's rah-rah America so over the top that I would have been happy to climb into the movie and machine gun all the idiotic Americans myself. It's offensive beyond belief (the main character's wife was supposedly killed in the Twin Towers on 9/11 - pretty offensive to all of those people who had family who DID lose their lives on 9/11).  The acting is atrocious, the characters are morons, and the movie has no point at all.

Once I'd watched it, I actually snapped the DVD in half and threw it in the garbage.  Dreadful.  Don't waste your money.  There are many other war movies that are 100 times better than this.

2175223,4,B00068CUO0,"I've been in Afghanistan since November of 2004, it is June of 2005 as I write this and I am amazed I have never heard of this film until 1 week ago.

Some think it is good, some think it is bad, I respect and feel similarly about this film.  I myself see weak points and incredibly strong points.

Regardless...

For a group of Americans to go into Afghanistan to make a small independent film should be enough to motivate someone to watch this largely unknown film.  But more, for them to have succeeded in making a film which almost gives equal time to both the average Afghan point of point of view while still paying respect to the intensity of anger and confusion many Americans felt at this time after the events of 9/11, that is a small feat in itself.

This is not a political film, it is not a great film, but it is a film which shows an Afghanistan I have grown to love and hate while being over here.

I am not a soldier and I do not live in a compound, so seeing the streets, the people and chaos which is filmed very competently in this film impressed me. Nothing is out of place or looks staged, even if at times the acting isn't up to par.

There are moments and directions the film goes which aren't Hollywood perfect, but this isn't a Rambo movie or just a ""Blair Witch Project"" in Afghanistan.  I think that the director just wanted to show a man who, like many in the country who were affected very personally by these events, lost enough that he had nothing to lose and found himself compelled to do something that to most would seem irrational, immature, or insane.

If you have never lost someone that close to you, or you object to the U.S. action if Afghanistan than you probably would think this movie is silly, politically unsavory or would be simply unable to suspend disbelief from the moment any flaws (which the film has) arose during the film.

This film is very well captured even if not well executed throughout.  If you are interested in watching this film, do so, even if you don't like the film, at least you will feel or think something which is more than most films provoke.",1119225600,5,2113,4.348600508905853

The acting is so completely first rate that I really couldn't tell if it was real or not - only some of the too good to be true scenes - the live filming of assassination, and the most realistic firefight I've seen ever - eventually gave it away. The attitude of the lead character was so  typical of too many fundamentally decent people who I observed overreacting to 9-11. The movie was deeply frightening as I watched helplessly as he dragged his hapless associates deeper and deeper into a pit that had no bottom. Yet it was all too easy to believe that someone schooled in the Woodstein myth of journalism and the implicit assumption that being an American renders one basically invulnerable to the normal risks that other human beings are subject to, could have made the decisions that he did. Ultimately I found the film worked effortlessly on multiple levels, the most compelling being the central character standing in for America in Afghanistan and, indeed, the whole of the Muslim World itself, driving deeper and deeper into an incredibly dangerous place that he can't begin to understand, taking those foolish enough to believe in it along with it on what could prove to be a one way ticket to disaster.",1114732800,6,1369,4.776371308016878

It has airs of the Blair Witch project, and even (less well known) Tim O'brien's book ""Going After Cachiatto"" (sp?) and the classic ""An Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge"" (right title?).

This movie isn't great, but as an independent film on a relatively tight budget and compared to most other movies, it's really good. We get a first hand tour through an extremely dangerous place. How many other films give you such a look at Afghanistan?

Someone critisized the film because they didn't understand the lead character's motivation--that makes no sense at all. Maybe that person wasn't watching closely enough.

The character isn't terribly likeable. He's pretty slick and kind of arrogant. Some of the things he does seem either stupid or suicidal. While it's all a little hard to beleive, it fits in well with his overall character. I think 9/11, for personal reasons, pushed him over the edge.

I won't say the acting is bad, though it certainly isn't great. The plot is kind of like ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"".

The directing is non-existant. This is due to a mixture of inexperience and the circumstances surrounding the shooting of the movie which is perhaps the most interesting things about it. It was all shot, with a few exceptions, inside Afghanistan. This fact gives it a lot of ""authenticity"" however one must question the decisions and actions of the crew.

My first problem is that Afghanistan isn't a safe place. To knowingly take a crew and actors into a warzone, and make no mistake about it: Afghanistan is a warzone, is at best extremely unprofessional and it at worst shows a complete and utter lack of regard for the safety of everyone involved and that includes the unsuspecting Afghan people.

The second problem I have is the movie is dishonest at it's very core. While it certainly displays the situation in Afghanistan it ruins any crediblity it could have by going around and pretending the interviews and such are going to be for a documentary. Some people very well could've been putting their lives on the line in order to tell their story so these ""documentary film makers"" will spread the word to the world. Instead they are put into a film that is fiction with little sprinklings of truth here and there.

I would've had less of an issue over the misleading nature of the film if they had included a serious and well researched documentary on Afghanistan as a special feature. Sadly they do no such thing.

On top of that it makes all Americans look like complete and utter morons.

Is this movie worth watching? Yes because if you are smart enough to tell what is true and what isn't you get a glimpse, not a very detailed glimpse but a glimpse none the less, of Afghanistan and it's people. Unfortunately though the bad outweighs the good.",1111881600,3,2069,4.636612021857924

Wake up!",1111622400,9,328,4.4
2175235,1,B00068CUO0,"Not worthy of the star system. I rented this movie with a few suspicions. Why for instance had I never heard a thing about this movie if it was such an ""Amazing. Brave. and Scary"" movie? Who puts reviews from ""Aint It Cool News"" on their DVD case? Unfortunately I took the chance and rented it before I got to read all the terrible reviews of it on the internet. This movie should be retitled ""Survivor In Afghanistan"". Its a lame attempt at reality TV gone Hollywood not unlike The Blair Witch Project only not nearly as interesting. I didn't walk away feeling as though I witnessed some amazingly ""inside"" view of conditions in Afghanistan since the actors were so fake one can only assume their depiction of conditions there were equally as artificial. In fact I have my doubts that this movie was even filmed on location. If you take a hand held video camera out into the desert and shake it around enough you too can tell your friends that you were in the dangerous war torn country of Afghanistan. The amateur nature of the whole production and ""acting"" makes one question everything about it including why it was even made. It would be much easier and more interesting to watch some neighborhood kids playing cowboys and indians at least they wouldn't insult your intelligence by expecting you to buy it as reality or worse yet pay money to watch it.",1111104000,9,1357,4.588477366255144

2175237,1,B00068CUO0,"This ""Osama Witch Project"" is the hands-down worst film I saw in 2004, worse than even ""Catwoman"" - which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction.

In ""September Tapes,"" a ""film crew"" of ""documentary journalists"" heads to Afghanistan - despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip, the conditions and, oh yeah, the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wife's death on Sept. 11 - to track down Osama bin Laden.

They ""made"" eight tapes on their journey, which now ""document"" their travels and, of course, their attempts to kill the terrorist leader. (The eight tapes, thankfully, all end at points significant in the narrative, which is convenient for a ""documentary."")

The psychotic, idiotic protagonist - who is given to long, significant speeches that he probably learned watching ""MacGyver"" - cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps. I don't know why he didn't just wear a sign on his back that said ""Shoot me.""

The crew's translator, supposedly their sensible voice-of-reason, does little more than whine and gets baffled as the idiot hero leads them into doom.

You wish they'd brought along someone on their trip to call them all morons.

Around ""Tape 4,"" I began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew.",1109030400,37,1394,4.910638297872341
2175238,1,B00068CUO0,The film presents itself as a documentary but it isn't.  The main characters in it are actors using 9/11 and the war in Afghanistan for their own profit.  I feel bad that they duped actual Afghani officials into helping them get this trash brought to the screen and I feel bad for people who are duped into thinking this is real.

The movie left me with a horrific feeling in the pit of my stomach and unlike so many other things out there today this offering did not disappoint at the last hurdle. I was sad, I was scared, I was captivated but I could not for the life of me turn it off and I am a harsh critic when it comes to movies. If you have a strong stomach and you want to perhaps find out what life in this lawless part of the world is probably like post 9/11 then watch this film.",1108339200,6,674,3.856115107913669
2175240,1,B00068CUO0,Any American affected by 911 and the seriousness of the subsequent wars will be offended by this pretentious piece of garbage. Just another film maker who finds war to be an exciting little game played by children. I guess the next move for these filmakers will be to dramatize what it must have been like in the two towers. Maybe they can strap a camera on the back of someone and jump off a building just to get a 'cool' shot. If I were to meet the people responsible for this Jerry Springer inspired trash I would love to accompany them as we visit some of the family members. This call this film a disgrace is giving it too much credit.,1107907200,10,640,4.297520661157025
2175241,4,B00068CUO0,"Is it real or make-believe? Regardless this independent film offers a stunning, tension filled ride through the streets of war torn Afghanistan. Filmed in a documentary filmstyle with hints of bravado it will definitely hold your attention from beginning to end.

The film begins with a reporter Don Larson (George Calil) aboard a plane destined for Kabul. His goal is to capture video coverage of the Al-Qaeda operatives and to possibly get in on the bounty for Bin Laden. He is young, exuberant and bold in his pursuit of the men he believes to be responsible for the 9/11 attacks and he does not back down from questioning by Afghani supporters of the attacks. Larson places himself and his crew into all sorts of hairy predicaments fully aware that his life is at stake such as an arms deal gone wrong, an ambush by Afghani police and a shoot out with unknown assailants in the complex mountain areas bordering Pakistan. Acting as Larson's interpreter is Wali Razaqi, an American of Afghani descent and the often unseen camera man follows their every move. The footage is both chilling and authentic and the actors bravely insane.

Although the filming style of this movie is its draw I found the writing to be absolutely effective. The characters are allowed to be more than war mongers in pursuit of blood. The script allows for Calil to be the action hero as well as a very vulnerable and afraid man. Calil is excellent in this role and stepped out on a limb in order to play it. But it is the ending of this film that really hits home and ties the tangled web together with more than just tape.",1107734400,21,1602,4.617543859649123
2175242,3,B00068CUO0,"Although it looks and feels like a documentary, SEPTEMBER TAPES (First Look) is an unsettling movie that purports to be a quest to find the truth about the terrorist attack of 9/11 and those responsible.

A year after September, 2001, three men with fake documents go deep into Afghanistan.  With the help of hired translators, bounty hunters and arms traffickers, they find answers to questions they weren't even asking.

Slow going and talky at times, the sudden and surprisingly visceral action scenes jolt and are greatly enhanced by the harrowing location filming and the terrific surround sound design.  Extras include 40 minutes of bonus footage and commentaries.

Too bad more attention wasn't paid to making the script as gripping as some of the action cinemtography.  It could've been unforgettable.",1107475200,2,809,5.232558139534884

The on-site filming and the use of actual Afghan police and other locals heighten the documentary ""look & feel"" of the movie.  The Dolby/DTS 5.1 soundtrack ROCKS!  The gun battle and the chase scenes will have you feeling like ducking for cover from the bullets and rockets.  You'll hear the rockets whoosh from your front to rear speakers and then explode behind you.  You'll hear the bullets whiz from L to R and front to rear speakers.  The explosion of the 2,000 lb bomb"" will give your subwoofer a resounding workout.  The final scene sheds welcome light on the main character's relentless pursuit of Osama Bin Laden.
