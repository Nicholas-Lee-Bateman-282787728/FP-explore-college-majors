8248790,5,B00132D7UE,"Fireball was pretty good, as usual with with the star of the show, Harrison Ford there's always action!  Never heard of this movie before but liked it along with my other favorite 16 Blocks!",1454889600,,190,4.588235294117647
8248791,5,B00132D7UE,"Both of the movies on this double feature were ones that I had never seen before. Harrison Ford & company in Firewall was an edge-of-your-seat,
high-tech robbery & kidnapping thriller. Highly exciting. 16 Blocks, starring an almost unrcognizable Bruce Willis, was a cops-gone-bad, action packed chase trying to get a wittness to the courthouse to testify against the baddies. The ending of the movie was a surprisingly satifying happy one for both Bruce and the wittness he was protecting. An all around great deal for the money!",1435622400,,529,5.091954022988506

8248793,4,B00132D7UE,"Firewall is an intriguing flick with Harrison Ford as the victim of a high-tech robbery. 16 Blocks is a good addition to all Bruce Willis fan collections, hes a bad cop gone good and is trying to get a witness to the grand jury in time. Two good movies for around 5.00",1378684800,,268,4.173076923076923
