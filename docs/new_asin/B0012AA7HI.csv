8244896,5,B0012AA7HI,"This series is so much fun and is hard to stop watching. I hate spoilers but I will say there are strong and likable characters, a unique and clever premise that keeps you intrigued and guessing, written by someone with a wicked sense of humor and enough fantasy/sci-fi background not to be predictable or trite. I watched this on netflix first. They sent disc one alone and I nearly went crazy waiting to see the end on disc 2 which came in the mail later.
I loved it so much I ordered it from Amazon.
I also gave it as a gift to someone who watched both discs in one sitting;he could not stop watching it.
Great to watch over and over, with friends, and inspires lots of conversation and speculation as each of the objects have their own gifts...
