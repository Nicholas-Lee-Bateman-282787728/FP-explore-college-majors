7917903,1,B00003CWID,"I am a huge fan of the original story, Notre-Dame De Paris and many of the film and musical adaptations.  In fact this was the first adaptation I ever saw.  I must have been between 3-6 years of age and it aired on Nickelodeon during a segment titled, Special Delivery.  For years I've been looking for this adaptation to see if it lived up to my memories.
No, it does not.  It's bland!  The story, characters, animation, sets are all bland.  Nothing stands out and the color schemes scream of the '70's (when it was animated/produced.)
Based on my memories, I kind of hate giving it one star.
Bottom line: If you're like me and a big NDDP nerd it's worth a watch and the price is cheap.  If not and you're just looking for an alternative to the Disney adaptation, skip it.",1366070400,,773,4.363636363636363
