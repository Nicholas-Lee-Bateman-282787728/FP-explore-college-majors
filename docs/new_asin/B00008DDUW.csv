1840946,5,B00008DDUW,"This is the most fun I've had in a long time! Phil Cook's film just kicks off and rolls non stop till the finale. The visuals are very cool, and the whole film has another worldly look and feel.  It's a great story, awesome action and terrific filmmaking. In a sea of boring blockbuster action films, this little gem rates 5 stars.",1049500800,3,331,4.338709677419355
1840947,3,B00008DDUW,"What would happen if Purgatory ceased to serve it's primary function of moving departed souls along to the next and final phase of their Afterlife? Certainly would mean there'd be a lot of human souls piling up in a hurry. It's quite an interesting concept for a storyline don't you think?

The 'Despiser' has a truly inventive storyline and does the best it can to deliver some entertainment value to the viewer. Yes it was filmed on a very low budget with a cast of unknowns and the special effects are somewhat disconcerting but when all is said and done I think it does a surprisingly admirable job of delivering the goods. The ending is absolutely perfect!

Again, don't expect too much and you might be surprised. I would say it's worth a watch or two.

My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-.",1205539200,7,785,4.553191489361702
1840948,5,B00008DDUW,"""Despiser"" is a great fantasy and action sci fi film!  It takes you into Purgatory and back while experiencing unique computer generated worlds.  The acting is fantastic and the props and virtual sets are amazing.  Some reviews criticized the effects, but don't see this movie thinking you can compare it to Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith.  This film has it's own unique style that does remind one of a video game.  I found myself totally into the story while rooting for the good guys!  This is an awesome adventure at a wonderful price.  Definitely worth checking out!",1191974400,2,570,4.755102040816326

1840951,4,B00008DDUW,"First off, you should not watch this movie by yourself. It will just bore you because you won't have anyone to disguss how disgustingly horrible this movie is with. On the other hand, this movie is so rediculous that it becomes insanely comedical. From beginning to end (although in the middle it tends to get a little boreing) this movie is incredibly hilarious in the so-bad-its-funny way. Amazingly ugly special effects, A plot that not even the cast understands, below average acting, and some absolutely classic lines. The 4 main characters all try to portray different races and fail misreably -- especially the ""Japanese"" actor. For one, he looks mexican, and two, since when does having a Japanese accent of broken english make you sound like a neanderthal? It is absolutely hilarious. If you have a taste for ""bad"" movies, I strongly encourage to watch this movie. Very, very, very funny.",1141516800,,897,4.947019867549669

1840953,4,B00008DDUW,"If you enjoy this movie simply because of the story, acting, etc. you must be borderline retarded; but, if you appreciate the film for its comedic mastery than I applaud you. 'Despiser' is not a movie you watch alone (I tried that the first time and wound up angry because of how bad the movie was), this is the movie that you get all your friends together to watch and laugh about how bad it is. So far I have watched this movie 9 times and have found something new ever time. With this movie you will get some of the worst dialouge ever (""I'd like you to shed some light on a subject."" ""What?"" ""Dying.""), an actress who's accent changes ever scene, an attempt to pass off a Hispanic actor as a kamikaze piolet (why do they let him drive so much?), and hands down the worst special effects ever to grace my screen at least. But again, the movie is absolutely hysterical. So I guess I would reccomend you buy this.",1136937600,4,914,4.289017341040463
1840954,4,B00008DDUW,"DESPISER is a wild little film. Made for almost nothing, I found it refreshing and innovative for its budget. I could easily have seen this as a main stream Hollywood flick with some star power and money behind it -- an imaginative and cool fantasy. It's certainly better than most of the shot on video features that liter the shelves of rental stores. If you like a fantasy adventure that's not cynical, has a lot of action and an fairly original storyline, check it out.

I would rather punch myself in the face than see this again.",1130716800,,220,4.425
1840956,5,B00008DDUW,"Despiser gets a bad rap on this board for being so low budget, but if you watch the 'making of 'stuff on the DVD you realize that this is made by a guy who isn't connected to Hollywood geographically or otherwise ( Philip Cook). The actors are mostly friends and obviously aren't Hollywood types- I find that refreshing. While people complain about the extensive use of low-end CGI effects, I find the effects to be one of the elements that makes Despiser such a charming experience. The effects don't try to fool you, they serve the overall look and ingenuity of the production. Hollywood effects often cost millions of dollars and are created on extremely expensive workstations but usually don't fool you either so this makes the effects in Despiser feel more honest and artistic. .This film is a very large and ambitious vision pulled off for very VERY little money, with a decent video camera, home computers, and sets built from stuff purchased at the home depot. In spite of it's home-made feel I don't consider this to be amateur or naiive cinema because it actually consists of a well thought out story and production. I totally admire this films gusto and ingenuity. 9 out of 10 stars.",1116374400,4,1195,4.722488038277512

They must sneak into the video stores with trench coats, and instead of stealing movies, they put their own home-made, camcorder stinkers on the shelves.  Then, the video store people just go ahead and enter them in the system, not knowing what crap they are.  Movies like this make me want to blow up all of the digital camcorder factories and save the world.",1115942400,,558,4.56

There is undeniably a lot to enjoy in Despiser. It's an ambitious project ... Given its budget, it achieves much... I'd like to see what Phil Cook could do with some Hollywood resources or even some decent indie financial backing.

What a waste of my time! Philip Cook has the nerve to flash his name above the movie title like in the styles genre of steven spielberg or m night..well now at least I know..avoid the movie when you see Philip Cook!",1106179200,,381,4.232876712328767
1840960,1,B00008DDUW,"This is the worst movie I have seen in my entire life, without exaggeration. The effects are horrible, and while I know that CG alone doesn't make a movie (just see the new Dune), I don't want to feel as though I'm watching an old video game instead of a film. The actors...wait a minute, what actors? Half the time they're needlessly replaced by plasticky computer figures, and the rest of the time their expressions are so wooden, they might as well not be real. The idea behind the story is vaguely interesting, but the director doesn't deliver on the promise, and the entire work just falls flat on its face.

There are some movies that are so horrible, they become entertaining simply because it's funny to see how low we can go. This movie doesn't even give that to us.

It's only redeeming feature was that it cost a dollar, and that it was my friend's dollar. And if you were for some reason planning to shell out the $25 Amazon asks from you--think about all the good things you could do with that money. Like buy $25 worth of eggs and throw them off skyscrapers. Or maybe make your own movie on a home video camera. It's guaranteed to be better than this.",1105833600,,1165,4.413953488372093

1840962,1,B00008DDUW,"There are some interesting ideas in Despiser, certainly, but it's hard to deny that the film is a mess. Tacky CG aside, the acting is sub-par and the plot is full of holes and never seems totally cohesive. You'll find yourself asking, ""Why are there malls or car dealerships in purgatory?"" or ""How long have they been driving down that bridge?"" Character development isn't great, either, with an older, wise, black man doing what older, wise black men do in these films and a Japanese character who looks more Latino than anything else.
It's the kind of film you and your buddies might rent for laughs (you get to see the main character fight one of those tiny, plastic, pink-haired trolls on more than one occasion), but I can virtually guarantee that it's not worth paying $25 or more for.",1081641600,,791,4.6571428571428575

Sure, its done all the time... but what makes this film special is that it didn't have the hundreds of thousands of dollars to do it... With a small budget, Cook brought the Despiser to life...  I think what's wrong with audiences today is that they refuse to accept things that aren't done like everything else...

The explosive finale was pretty impressive for a little direct to video flick and the animated car chase over the lava bridges was pretty cool--sort of a SPEED RACER in CG.  As far as the graphics are concerned, they not as real as say the animated HULK which cost millions more?  Please!  At this point, the graphics in both pictures requires suspension of disbelief.  The bottom line is does the story have a heart and soul and have something to say?  Do you get involved with the characters and their quest?  In my view, the answer for DESPISER is yes.",1057363200,4,694,4.585365853658536

  The director takes a more down-to-Earth approach to depict this fight; mixing car chases and gunfights along with the traditional demons and monsters. I also liked the way the director used computer generated images as a cost cutting way of depicting the underworld and certain action scenes. The CGIs are not great, but they are decent enough. This is a very solid B-Grade movie.",1050537600,3,594,4.871287128712871

The ""computer generated special effects"" are horrible I can't even begin to explain how bad it is, the sad part is half of the movie uses these special effects in scenes where it's totally unnecessary so all it does is make the movie that much more painful to watch.
The whole thing was filmed on someone home VCR camcorder so not only does the cgi look horrible but so does the rest of the movie.

7982175,1,B00008DDUW,"It's bad.  I mean really bad.  I like B horror movies, don't mind lousy (or no) effects and a bad actor or two, but this went way beyond that.  The premise is that a regular guy dies and goes to Purgatory, learns that Purgatory is no longer controlled by God but by aliens who want to break out into the real world.  He's revived and leaves Purgatory, and the aliens kidnap his wife from the real world so he will come back and show them how to get out of Purgatory.  There are *a lot* of plot holes that could have been filled in fairly easily, but they simply just don't bother, leaving it feeling incomplete.

Production values are terrible.  It looks like really, really old CGI with some live people superimposed - think Playstation era gaming when developers were just getting into 3D.  This is explained in the movie by Purgatory being a 'dream like' environment, but the normal world isn't much better.

The actors are uniformly bad - every one of them.  Stilted and unnatural.  Not much else to say.

It sounds like I have a bone to pick with the movie, but I really don't.  I just want others to be warned before they watch it.  And the 5 star reviews?  There's no way those are consumers.  They're from cast, crew, producers, or family members trying to get someone to buy it.",1332028800,4,1287,4.412765957446808
7982176,4,B00008DDUW,This movie was fun. Acting by the three lead actors was very good. The plot is wilder than three or four Hollywood sci-fi movies put together. The behind-the-scenes DVD extra shows how the special effects were created for the feature on desktop computers with off-the-shelf software. But maybe you don't like low budget movies... Watch the trailer and other clips on Youtube before purchasing.,1298592000,2,393,5.15625
