Thanks!

8466826,2,B005DI44YW,"I first saw this movie when I was six years old and was bowled over. I have long wanted to reacquaint myself with it. I'm sorry to say it doesn't live up to expectations. 1940's effects don't quite live up to what they appeared. However it was delightful to catch up with a very young Dorothy Lamour and Robert Preston. I would have given it four stars for sentimental reasons except the DVD quality is appalling. It has obviously been transferred from a very bad VHS tape. Shame, as the film itself deserves better.",1432512000,,516,4.5

8466828,2,B005DI44YW,"It's a very old movie and time takes its toll on the film. It appeared that the actors  looked heavier than they should.  I was trying to relive the past, as I originally saw it as a young adult.  I was disappointed, but still have my memories.",1409702400,,244,4.148936170212766
