2615268,4,B000GNOSCM,Old but great movie. Picture quality wasn't that great and the subtitles were big and took a lot of space. Makes you wonder how being gay was difficult at that time in a society not so accepting. It's a good thing times have changed.,1453248000,,233,4.318181818181818

2615272,3,B000GNOSCM,"This film is okay.  It has 2 very close people in real life AND Professional (both German): the brilliant director Wolfgang Peterson with his favorite actor (also brilliant) Juergen Prochnow, who would both go on (6 years later) to make the by far the greatest and submarine film ever made: ""Das Boot"" (1984/""The Boat""), which shows the consequences of their torpedoes; hulls crushing with men screaming in the final throes of their death.",1439856000,,439,5.013698630136986
2615273,5,B000GNOSCM,"I first saw this movie in an art-house theater in the late 70's, and it deeply resonated.  I saw every remaining showing before it moved on, and have been searching for it for years.  Probably just me, but struck me hard.",1346284800,,221,4.365853658536586
2615274,5,B000GNOSCM,"I purchased the DVD of THE CONSEQUENCE (Die Konsequenz) without knowing a thing about it, and I am so very glad I did.  Although thematically very different, it reminded me of another 1970's film concerning a love affair between an older man and an underage boy.  That film was titled ABUSE; I rented it one snowy weekend several years ago and proceeded to be blown away.  Such a film is THE CONSEQUENCE, made for German television and released in 1977.

THE CONSEQUENCE concerns a handsome actor named Martin (Jurgen Prochnow) who is sent to prison for seducing a minor.  During his initial processing at the jail, he is asked, ""How old was he?"" Sadly he replies, ""Fifteen.  If it had been a girl, I would only have gotten two and a half years.""  The intake guard notes that Martin has already served much of his sentence while awaiting trial and may be released early for good behavior.

Shortly after his arrival, Martin is approached by a fellow prisoner, who relates that he has written a play, and asks Martin's help in staging it.  As luck would have it, to keep him out of trouble, the Warden allows his wayward, rebellious son, Thomas, to be cast in the play with the adult inmates, portraying Martin's son.  The Warden has no way of knowing that, not only is Thomas gay, he develops a strong crush on Martin and immediately falls in love.  On the closing night of the jailhouse play, Thomas finds a way to sneak into Martin's cell, and their love is consummated.  Thus begins a romantic tragedy as gripping and powerful as just about any I've ever seen.

After Martin is released, Thomas and Martin approach the Warden and his wife, and declare their love for each other.  Their love is rejected by his parents, and the Warden tells Thomas to get out and never return.  They run away and set up a home together, but the Warden soon changes his mind, and has Thomas arrested and sent to a Reform School until he is twenty-one.

The rest of the film details the horrendous incarceration that the Warden has mandated for Thomas, the young man's efforts to escape and return to Martin, and Martin's desperate attempts to free him.  When Thomas does emerge, finally free and of age to determine his own destiny, he is horribly scarred both physically and mentally from the cruelty that he's experienced in the Reform School.  The tragedy does not present a happy ending.

Director Wolfgang Petersen (DAS BOOT, ENEMY MINE, and THE PERFECT STORM) has constructed an atmosphere of repression and cruelty that many gay men will identify with, and one that is doubtless still being played out in many parts of the world, even thirty-five years after THE CONSEQUENCE was made.  Filmed for German television and clearly intended to present a sympathetic portrait of the struggles encountered by same-sex couples, this heartbreaking story will resonate with many gay men who remember how difficult our lives could be in years past, and how difficult some would make it today.  The tender, romantic love that Martin and Thomas feel for each other is contrasted by the frustrating lack of understanding and compassion of everyone they come in contact with.  This is not a story about pedophilia.  Although no precise age is given for Thomas when he meets Martin, he appears to be about 17, which happens to be the legal age of consent in many States in the U.S.  And the film makes it clear that Thomas is already quite aware of his longings and desires when he and Martin first become acquainted.  In fact, as often happens when a young gay men falls in love with someone older, it is Thomas and not Martin who aggressively initiates their romance.

THE CONSEQUENCE is a sad, beautiful film, filled with tender romantic moments and heartbreaking cruelty.  Although some of the plot was a bit of a stretch, the situations somehow felt very genuine.  And as with the previously mentioned film ABUSE, the black and white photography and grainy picture somehow added a realistic feel.  At one point in the narrative, Thomas writes to Martin in prison and tells him that he feels as though he's in prison himself - the prison of living with parents who will never understand him and being forced into a job he dislikes intensely.  The supreme irony of the story is that fact that the only happiness they seem destined for is that which they experience while Martin is in prison and Thomas, on the outside, is able to hope they can someday have a life together.  Once they think they're free, the real tragedy begins to emerge.

Neither ABUSE nor THE CONSEQUENCE are easy films to watch.  They both tackle subjects which are adult and controversial, and although handled in a sympathetic and intelligent way, many audiences will be extremely disturbed by the subject matter.  But dramatically, THE CONSEQUENCE packs a powerful punch, one that easily overcomes many of the stiff, contrived circumstances proffered by some modern gay dramas.  If you like raw, hard-hitting stories, THE CONSEQUENCE just may surprise you.

A word about the subtitles in this DVD: many reviewers have complained about the large, yellow-boxed English subtitles, which are easy to read but obscure the lower portion of the screen.  It must be noted that the DVD includes the original white subtitles, which are less obtrusive but more difficult to read.  As a remedy to this, I found I could easily toggle back and forth between the two by using the ""Subtitle"" button on my remote.  I watched the film with the white subtitles on and when I found them hard to read, I just switched back to the large subtitles momentarily.  Yes, it was a bit of an effort, but surprisingly, it did not really detract from my enjoyment of the film - I felt that THE CONSEQUENCE was that good.

THE CONSEQUENCE is highly recommended.",1341100800,,5781,4.746746746746747
2615275,3,B000GNOSCM,"Made in the 70's, this black and white film seems to be even older than it is. It's a story about difficult love relationship and hostile attitude towards gays in Switzerland (which looks here like one of the countries in eastern Europe).
Martin is imprisoned because of having a sexual relationship with a young teenager and Thomas is a son of a prison warden. They decide to be together and it causes the title consequence. However, the title can also refers to the decision taken by the court later on (Thomas must spend some time in a centre for juveniles and it has a lot of consequences for his life).

Aformentioned lack of colors on the screen intesifies the pessimistic feeling of this flick. It also made it sometimes difficult to read the subtitles (at least in the version I have seen).
I think it's worth to watch it (just to realize that being a gay not so long time ago wasn't so ""gay"").",1308182400,,902,4.5
2615276,5,B000GNOSCM,"A great film. Non manipulative, matter of fact, non-sentimental. A powerful love story. There is a priceless scene in this film: Meet My Parents.  The conversation becomes impossible when the parents are IGNORANT fools and do not want to listen or understand what their son or his friend has to say.  They came in good faith, but got kicked out. From here on, the story is unwinding masterfully and emotionally.  What a great testament of time for European gay history, what a great lesson for parents!  Bravo!",1276905600,,510,4.827586206896552
2615277,5,B000GNOSCM,"I think this movie deserves the five stars I've given. It's a very, very good film for those young people struggling and coming out to their parents of which the parents don't want to understand about their child. although it's got some years on it and the subtitles it still should be watch by all..... that are open- minded...",1242604800,,328,4.576271186440678
2615283,5,B000GNOSCM,"The look is a bit dated, but the subject matter holds up really well.  This is a touching love story about a gay couple trying to live their lives together.  The orange subtitles can be very distracting.  The black and white subtitles are hardly readable but this is a good movie.  Both lead actors give great performances.",1236816000,,323,4.614035087719298
2615284,3,B000GNOSCM,"Fantastic, considering the time. This is truly part of the cannon of early gay cinema that must be seen. Jurgen Prochnow gives an outstanding performance as the older man. The story is a brilliant snapshot of survival in a time of legal and societal oppression that must be remembered. This film reminded me that it was not so long ago being gay was synonymous with the idea of deviant behaviour punishable by law. Highly recommended.",1202428800,,434,4.8
2615285,4,B000GNOSCM,"Wolfgang Petersen's The Consequence is a wonderful reminder of what great film making is all about.  Petersen did not need a huge budget, overpowering soundtrack and special effects to tell a compelling and heartfelt story about two doomed lovers.  Instead he was able to concentrate on filming a convincing story while eliciting two subtle yet powerful performances from his lead actors.  This is not just a gay interest film; the themes of loneliness, persecution and love are universal and the result is a film that resonates long after viewing.

Thank goodness The Consequence has been preserved on DVD.  It's a film that deserves to be seen.  If it were not for the overly large and distracting subtitles, I would have given it five stars.  Buy it, rent it, see it!",1166486400,,770,4.876923076923077
2615286,5,B000GNOSCM,"I agree with the previous reviewer that the film itself deserves 5 stars, but  wanted to give the DVD zero stars because of the new superimposed subtitles.

I also found the new subtitles annoying, but I have given this DVD 5 stars because you can TURN THE NEW SUBTITLES OFF.  First of all, this is a great piece of gay cinema history that I first saw in 1977 and thought I would never see again...so I'm very grateful this DVD is now available.  Apparently the DVD was transfered from a print that had English subtitles and someone who thought they were too hard to read came up with the idea of the new large orange subtitles that are now superimposed over the original ones.  The original subtitles are not THAT hard to read and the new ones take up way too much of the screen.  Simply turn off the new subtitles and enjoy the film.",1164585600,,835,4.354838709677419
2615287,1,B000GNOSCM,"My purpose here is to warn potential customers about the defacement that whoever now has the rights to this title has done on this fine German film. It stars Jurgan Prochnow and is directed by Wolfgang Peterson;the two would later collaborate on another film--Das Boot. The Consequence was made for German television and released theatrically in the U.S. in 1978, which is when I saw it. It was never released on video but was available for 16mm rental until the rental company was absorbed by another and the film diappeared for about twenty years. I was so looking forward to a new dvd of as it became available at last.  BUT someone has superimposed large gray-white solid rectangles over the original unobtrusive subtitles (which still are visible from time to time) and put bright large yellow subtitles. I suppose the reasoning was that the original subtitles, which consisted of the dialogue in white superimposed directly on the film image was too hard to read. It WAS here and there when the letters would be white on a light background image. However, now about twenty percent of the image is masked by these large, very annoying rectangles that block out the film image, sometimes cutting off the lower parts of characters' faces or otherwise blotting out the lower portion of the screen. It's maddening to see the original subtitles showing up between when the screen is blocked out and thinking how much more preferable and less distracting it would be to be able to see the full image. I give the film 5 stars and what they've done to it 0 stars (1 is all I could show above)",1159833600,,1589,4.715827338129497
8133471,5,B000GNOSCM,"It was great to see Jurgen Prochnow a very sensitive roll. Past experience has been completely the opposite. This is a beautiful love story in that these two people, Jurgen's and Ernst Hannawald's characters cared deeply for each other during a very difficult time. This could have been a romance between and man and a woman who were facing ethnic/religious/racial prejudice.  This film focused on a gay relationship and showed a true and wonderful closeness between these two men.  Mr. Hannawald's character had to endure estrangement from his family and harsh treatment at a ""reform"" school.  I'm sure there are parents today that would do the same thing that his parents did; try to change him back into a ""normal"" person. Hopefully, we can all see this sort of prejudice come to an end in the near future. I felt a real connection with the performance and enjoyed the movie despite the ending.  As for the sub-titles, I have to agree with another reviewer that they helped me a lot. I don't think I could have read the original titles and I appreciated the larger print and deeper color.  It did not detract from the film for me.",1516060800,,1133,4.702020202020202
8133472,5,B000GNOSCM,Great film!!!,1509840000,,13,6.0
8133473,4,B000GNOSCM,"First, let me weigh in on the yellow subtitles -- I actually think they're great for people like me. It is good that there is an option for those who find it trying to strain mightily to read white subtitles on a black and white background. Years ago I had a terrible experience with a very famous Italian film called La Dolce Vita, which I had always wanted to see. It was such agony trying to read the (for me) almost invisible subtitles while keeping track of the action that I finally gave up. I even tried again -- with the same result. To this very day, I still have not seen that film. I decided that until they make copies with the option of yellow subtitles I won't even bother since I am much older now and presumably my eyesight didn't get any better. So for all the purists who lament yellow subtitles: sorry, guys but we don't all have the eye-sight of eagles..
As for the film itself, I found it deeply moving albeit depressing. I honestly feel like I lived this film, although thank God I skipped the reformatory. It was a long time after the period of this movie, but enlightenment is quirky-- now you see it, mow you don't. I remember well the concerted efforts to keep gay lovers apart--both by the intolerant and those who only wanted a piece of the action. I thought the film was truthful and poignant--would have given it a higher rating if it hadn't stirred so many unpleasant memories of my own experience as an embattled gay teenager.",1480291200,,1458,4.4237918215613385
8133474,5,B000GNOSCM,"A look into what a community has gone through during a certain period in history. Could have had a much better ending, however...still noteworthy Well acted and written, a film worthy of saving for historical value. A nice piece of work and message for its time.
 I agree with a fellow Amazon reviewer, that the biggest flaw was a hack job on the subtitles. They were over imposed on the old ones with dark patches. I did look for this film to add to my collection but...not with that flaw.",1475366400,,490,4.444444444444445
8133475,4,B000GNOSCM,"The movie should be one of the best classic gay love story. Although it was made a long time ago by today's standard,the theme was still relevant today. Everyone should have the right to love.",1472860800,,192,4.514285714285714

8133477,3,B000GNOSCM,"I watched this through Prime so there's no way to get rid of the tacky yellow&white subtitles. However, the movie really is so compelling that in the end I kind of forget about them. I want to say this is such a dated movie, but it really isn't. LGBT people trying to live their lives TOGETHER out and proud, depending where they live and how intolerant those around them are, could just as easily experience some of the problems that Martin and Thomas face in the movie. The only thing that pissed me off about the movie was the ending. Obviously I won't spoil it for future viewers, but if you're expecting a neat and tidy, fully resolved conclusion to this love story, you will be disappointed. Otherwise, I can't believe this movie was made in the 70s! It's definitely a groundbreaking film that should be preserved for future generations. I do wish the lighting in this film could be improved, it's so dark you can hardly see at times.",1466726400,,940,4.535294117647059
