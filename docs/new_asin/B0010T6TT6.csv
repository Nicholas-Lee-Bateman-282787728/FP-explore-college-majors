3050016,5,B0010T6TT6,I gave this movie 5 stars cause it's super fun. Very entertaining! Love to see the stars when they were younger. not too many people know that Cameron Crowe wrote this.,1413158400,,168,4.451612903225806
3050017,5,B0010T6TT6,"I'm happy to have an officially released, widescreen DVD version of this film. This is one of my favorite movies from the 80s. Many consider this a companion piece to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Although it doesn't hold the iconic status, it still holds up.

I would love it if this was a Directors Cut edition with deleted scenes and a Cameron Crowe commentary (he's great at those). However, based on articles I've read, Cameron Crowe wasn't happy with how this movie came out and never seemed interested in revisiting it. In addition, Edward Van Halen said he wasn't happy with the score he wrote and performed which may have held up music publishing. (much of the music was eventually turned into Van Halen songs).

I was a little hesitant about this Universal Vault Series because of the DVD-R technology. I didn't know what to expect. You do get a nice widescreen transfer of the film.  (VHS and LD versions are 4x3). One thing I would have liked to see included would have been a basic menu screen and to have the disc chaptered.

3050022,5,B0010T6TT6,"First of all, I won't even begin to say this is a GREAT movie.  Did I enjoy it when I was younger?  Of course!  But I was in my early teens, and this movie had some boobies.  That was about the only criteria for me back then.  But because I'm a nostalgic, I was thinking, ""you know, I wonder if ""The Wild Life"" is available on DVD.  Not thinking it would be, I was VERY surprised to see it.

But I admit, I was also reticent to order it, because I noticed it was a DVD-R...and as we've all seen, many times a DVD-R disc has very 'average' quality at best.

Boy was I wrong on this one!!!  Not only was it widescreen (figured it'd be a 4:3), but the quality was quite good!  Is it blu-ray?  No, but it's a VERY high quality DVD.  Especially for a movie that is so out-of-rotation that it probably shouldn't even have a DVD release.

Again, am I recommending the movie?  Well, not really...because it is a rather silly mid-80's attempt to cash in on Fast Times At Ridgemont High (they even cast Chris Penn, Sean's brother, to play the same sort of lunkhead pot smoker that Sean played in FTARH).  But if you liked it back then, and would like a silly memory in your DVD collection, and actually enjoy the quality of the DVD, then by all means, buy this one!",1389830400,15,1255,4.170833333333333
3050023,3,B0010T6TT6,"This review is for the Universal made-to-order DVD edition of ""The Wild Life"".

The film's picture, though not high-definition, is a big improvement on the VHS edition I got years ago.  The picture is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen.  The film timed out for me in 96:30 and seemed complete.  There are no extras at all.  When I put the disc in my player, the film just started.  When it was done, the DVD stopped, sending the screen went back to the DVD player's default one.  One change noticed was in the music credits.  My VHS shows eleven song credits.  The DVD shows the same eleven with eight additional ones.  There was a note that the original soundtrack was available elsewhere.

The film itself is a series of lightly linked stories filmed in greater Los Angeles.  Party boy Tom Drake (Chris Penn) has a summer job in a bowling alley working with studious high school graduate pal Bill Conrad (Eric Stolz).  Tom wants Eileen (Jenny Wright), who works the summer as a clothing salesperson for Harry (Rick Moranis), but wants more than Tom.  Bill has just broken up with Anita (Lea Thompson) but is still alarmed to learn that she may have a new boyfriend, David (Hart Bochner), who turns out to be a police patrolman.  Bill also plans to move out of his home to a glamorous apartment and live ""the wild life"".  Bill's younger brother, Jim (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) obsesses over the Vietnam War and finds ways to reenact various aspects of that war vicariously.  He has a doting pal, Tony (Brin Berliner), and a possible veteran hero, Charlie (Randy Quaid), who has maybe too many problems for Jim to feel comfortable with.  The various stories all have happy-enough resolutions.  The acting was solid.

The film is rated ""R"".  There are no language issues.  Only one person has an explicit drinking or drug problem.  There are a few fist fights.  There are a couple of explosions damaging property.  There are various forms of bad, risk-seeking behavior, including wild parties and adultery.  Probably the key to the rating is the amount of skin shown.  We get Jim, Eileen, Bill, Tom, two female strippers, and a number of party people of both sexes giving the traditional T&A shots.

It's all good fun, without any particular insights.",1382400000,9,2242,4.768229166666667

8238470,5,B0010T6TT6,"Now this is really a special movie... I first saw it while living in LA on cable and I thought it was one of these silly ""coming of age"" comdies BUT with instrumental music courtesy of the great Edward Van Halen (who at the time was putting his 5150 studio together)... being a guitar player and a fan of his was sure reason enough to watch it. Well, as far as the music is concerned, I certainly was not disappointed for there is more than 40/45 minutes of instrumental stuff played by ED alone (with a drum machine) and some of it is really interesting : some jazz moods he never displayed with Van Halen, little lead parts which are quite reminiscent of Jeff Beck's 80's work, some Keyboard stuff as well... pity this never appeared on vinyl/CD, there was enough substance to release a great solo album (the song they put on the official soundtrack LP doesn't appear throughout the movie and is very average compared to what was actually used !). But the movie itself si quite surprising with an excellent cast who is both believable and at times even moving, and a storyline which is much darker and meaner than you'd expect... for instance, there's a scene in a strip which would normally be funny and voyeuristic and becomes thanks to great acting and wise direction quite disturbing. I am not surprised the movie did not perform at the box office for it's not what people would expect and, when it comes to the end, one feels both blue and confused... it's actually more about losing teenage illusions and ""real life"" experience hitting you with a vengeance than having fun and getting laid as often as possible... but nevertheless, instrumental music by Van Halen is a joy to listen to and since having a copy (very decent picture quality by the way) is the only way to listen to it, well all you fellow guitarists should order it NOW !!!",1486771200,6,1846,4.546546546546547
8238471,5,B0010T6TT6,Saw this for the first time in the eighties when it first came to cable.  Glad to finally have it on DVD as part of my Chris Penn collection.  Also nice to be able to watch early work from Eric Stoltz and Lea Thompson.,1477267200,,218,3.9318181818181817

8238474,4,B0010T6TT6,"Great 80's teen flick that went under the radar. Good cast and good soundtrack, by Eddie Van Halen. This is a no-frills package and it is just the movie, without any extras. It is a pretty decent transfer and better than the last time I saw it on VHS, but since it is a DVD, not blu-ray, the price should have been closer to $9.99 than $19.99, but still a good purchase.",1471651200,3,370,4.152777777777778
