8255772,5,B0014I7JZQ,"Of the three Miles David concert DVDs I have, this one is my favorite. I know a lot of people had 'trouble' with electric-Miles, just as many had trouble with electric-Dylan. Get over it. Miles was a genius, who followed his muse where it led him. You don't have to like it; but if you can't do better, who are you to dismiss it?",1431043200,,329,4.15625
8255773,5,B0014I7JZQ,Miles and crew tear it up in Germany. Rickey Wellman on drums and Kenny Garrett on sax. This is the Miles Davis your dad didn't want to listen to but the Miles Davis the daddy of all things cool.,1373241600,3,195,4.0256410256410255
8255774,5,B0014I7JZQ,This is a great collection to add to you concert videos.... Great footage.... Should be added to any collectors collection,1356393600,,122,5.15
8255775,5,B0014I7JZQ,"I don't get many music videos, but this one made me want to check out more. The music was, of course the best from a great Miles driven team. Camera work was serious and flowed with the music. Miles is very cool. Any one who likes Miles should have this.",1342656000,,254,4.1
