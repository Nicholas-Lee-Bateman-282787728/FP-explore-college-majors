8302794,1,B001FVKUBM,"This was given to us as a gift- it is NOT a US blu-ray & will NOT play in US machines.  It's a UK edition.  If that's what you're looking for I'm sure it's worth 5 stars. Fantastic movies!  But since my kids were hoping to actually watch this in the US & the sales info on this disc isn't clearly marked, the grandparents who purchased it for them didn't realize & wasted their money.  Don't make the same mistake.  Just a warning.",1261872000,9,431,4.144578313253012
