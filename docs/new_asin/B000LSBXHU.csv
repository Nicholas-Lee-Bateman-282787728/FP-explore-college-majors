8163989,5,B000LSBXHU,"Ok. This is not going to be your disk if you are looking for entertainment. It IS your answer to learning how to swing or to correct those bad habits in an exsisting swing. Best golf video ever. It breaks it all down to the basics. BTW, I am a woman golfer. These lessons will help anyone, old, young, male, female...you can do it if you follow his lessons and practice step by step.",1438041600,,383,4.1891891891891895
8163990,4,B000LSBXHU,"I have been to several pros and watched several golf videos, with limited success.  My problem was trying to do all the things they told me to do, all at once.  This video breaks the swing into four distinct, sequential parts, each with clear physical markers to tell if you're in the right position and doing the right thing.  I was able to build my swing one piece at a time into a unified whole.  The ""Educating the Hands"" drill in particular got me around and cured my slice in about three practice sessions.",1280448000,2,512,4.414893617021277
