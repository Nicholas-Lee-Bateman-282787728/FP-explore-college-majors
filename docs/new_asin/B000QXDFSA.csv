2851420,5,B000QXDFSA,"I have 1st season of dog whisper,  I am delighted to understand why dogs react the way they do.
I have 3 dashounds ""barkers"" They have improved 90% or more since I have applied his way of correction.
1.out side with the neighbors
2.at the door when company comes.
3. I'm teaching the neighbors also to correct them. ""IT WORKS""
4. Every body will be happy.
They are becoming more dog, rather than my children. I am delighted to have learned of Cesar Millan ,""Dog Whisper""
I recommend this way of correction and respect toward my friends.
To see dogs can have a life, rather than a needle.
My next correction is jumping on people,
that will also be a success.
Thank you Cesar,,JoAnn Otto",1183593600,15,685,4.48

2851488,5,B000QXDFSA,"Great DVD! I don't have cable so haven't been able to see the show that I have heard about until I bought the DVDs (I purchased seasons 1 and 2). I love Cesar and just admire his ability! I have a puppy and have to keep watching these to see what I am doing wrong. Ugh... I only wish he had a couple of episodes dealing with puppies. All the dogs in these DVDs are grown dogs that have bad habits and he comes in to rehabilitate the dogs and train the owners how to pack leaders. Within hours you will see a completely different dog--he is just remarkable.

I try to use the same techniques on my puppy, but the key is consistency and frankly who has that much energy after a full day in the office? I just can't watch him every single minute and I hate to put him in a cage when I can't keep an eye on him. But, in just 10 minutes - the length of my shower, he can and did chew off the end of a power cord to a new fan I bought just for him. And, I even gave him a nice bone to chew on before I jumped into the shower--he just preferred the cord! In fact, power cords are his favorite chew toy and that is the 6th cord he has destroyed and he is only 5 months old:-( I guess I am lucky that none of the cords were plugged in at the time my dog chewed them up, but then again, maybe that would have broke his habit real quickly. lol. Nonetheless, it is my own fault for giving him too much freedom as a puppy.

Cesar he is also very easy on the eyes and has a cute accent to go with it; those traits make the DVDs even that much more enjoyable:-)",1406419200,2,1546,3.858490566037736

And we know the importance of rules, boundaries, limitations, exercise, and affection!",1367193600,,328,4.47457627118644
2851547,1,B000QXDFSA,"I bought this video based on the recommendation of a neighbor. Then I started researching Cesar Milan and his methods. Turns out his way has set the world of dog training back 20 years. Modern methods of dog training give positive rewards to dogs and teach them to think for themselves. In the human world we would call Cesar a bully.

Yes, Cesar takes a snarling, scary dog and turns it submissive, but why is he letting the dog snarl in the first place? I have seen videos of dogs with the exact same issues--one being manhandled by Cesar and another being gently coaxed by an assertive, positive trainer. Oooh, Cesar could get that dog to snarl, the positive trainer wouldn't do that to the dog. Which is why Cesar makes so much more money than the positive trainer...snarly makes for more intense television watching.

Not all trainers are equipped to handle dogs with issues like are shown on these dvds. We once called a trainer for dog fights. The trainer was worthless but we were too ignorant to know it and we had to re-home one of the dogs. However, when we recently brought in a rescue dog with food issues, we did find a trainer who had some skill. She recommended the techniques described in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mine-A-Practical-Guide-to-Resource-Guarding-in-Dogs/dp/0970562942/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mine! A Practical Guide to Resource Guarding in Dogs</a>. Our dog has flourished using these techniques.

If you don't have time to read the Unleashed book which gives you lots of theory, this book quickly gets issues under control:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fired-Up-Frantic-and-Freaked-Out-Training-the-Crazy-Dog-from-Over-the-Top-to-Under-Control/dp/0985934921/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fired Up, Frantic, and Freaked Out: Training the Crazy Dog from Over the Top to Under Control</a>

I have read, and spoken with experienced quality trainers, and the consensus is Cesar's methods lead to an increase in aggression in dogs. Also, he puts himself in a position to let dogs injure him. That is a bad road for a dog to go down and can often lead to the dog being euthenized as dangerous. As one person experienced with rescuing Australian Cattledogs said, ""Cesar has great editors."" He can cut out the scenes that show him in a bad light. Another trainer told me she watched a video of Cesar while she attended a dog training seminar and unless you were experienced you would not have realized he had knocked a dog unconscious. Yeah, good for Cesar's bank account, but not the dog.

If you're interested in reading an article that addresses many of the comments Cesar's fans make in response to his critics, there's a great article at 4pawsu (dot) com /cesarfans (dot) htm",1367020800,3,3129,5.7182795698924735
2851548,3,B000QXDFSA,"I've watched 5 of the 6 discs and enjoyed them, but disc 4 wouldn't play on the 2 DVD players I've tried. Since I live abroad I received the DVD set after deadline for returns so I can't return it. I hope the manufacturer will pay more attention to quality in the future.",1364169600,,271,4.132075471698113
2851549,4,B000QXDFSA,I ordered this quite a while ago and I haven't finished reading it so I couldn't give it 5 stars yet,1362960000,,100,3.8095238095238093
2851550,5,B000QXDFSA,"One baffling thing that's become apparent to me since I reacquainted myself with dog ownership in the past few years, is how very, very few dog owners pay any real attention to their dogs.  I know, that statement might be making some of you shake your heads in disbelief.  After all, America is rife with dog-owners who pay a neurotically intense amount of attention to their dogs, right?

That's what I thought, too.  Then I finally was able to have a dog of my own after thirty years of dogless-ness, and began spending a good deal of time outdoors with her, among other dog owners and their pets.  What an eye-opener!  So far, I've seen only two dog owners who truly pay attention to what their dogs are ""saying"" as they interact with people, other animals, and the environment.  The rest are almost completely clueless as to the canine ""conversations"" happening right under their noses.

This must explain why so many people seem to carry an aversion to Cesar's methods, even when they've seen ""The Dog Whisperer"" at work.

If Cesar was hurting or frightening these dogs, you would see it in their bodies.  No amount of editing could hide that, because the dogs would broadcast it loud and clear. That is not what happens, though.  The dogs Cesar works with all visibly relax.  You see the tension going out of their bodies.  If you watch carefully, you'll also see them poke him with their muzzles for attention, and look to him (rather than their owners) for guidance.  This is not the behavior of dogs who've been intimidated.  I've seen that many times, in other places, and it looks nothing like what ""Cesar's"" dogs express.  I would respectfully suggest that the reason Cesar's detractors see violence and fear at work is because they simply don't yet know dog ""language"" well enough to decode what they're actually seeing.

How do I have the right to make a claim like that?  Well, I'm no recognized expert, but...

I was raised with as many as forty dogs living in and around our home, some of which were our summer ""tenants"", which we dog-sat.  Most were malamute/husky/wolf mixes, working dogs more than pets, but just as well-known and loved by us as the one non-working dog that lived inside.  We kids had the tasks of feeding, grooming, de-mosquitoing, de-pooping, and generally watching over the dogs.  To someone only accustomed to the behavior of the typical domesticated house dog of modern America, the behavior of these dogs might seem almost alien, but I believe they were actually the more normalized of the two.

When one of those dogs acted up, the other dogs immediately corrected it's mistake, sometimes painfully, but never angrily.  The bitches corrected their pups just as immediately and dispassionately.  Dogs and pups who'd been disciplined were never found in the corner feeling sorry for themselves; they demonstrated submission, then got right back into the life of the pack, with no hard feelings.  I never saw any sign that any dog was emotionally ""damaged"" by the disciplinary fang-baring, nipping, or all-out, forced submission on the ground they received.

These dogs were quite capable of seriously injuring or killing their human companions.  Instead, they willingly submitted to all manner of unwanted attention with mosquito-repellant and currying tools, from three young kids.  Why?  Because, having learned by example from the adults, we kids instinctively knew to respect and manage those powerful dogs, according to their canine understanding of social relationships, not our human one.

  All Cesar is trying to teach people is what their dogs innately understand; that they're dogs, that they only understand doggy-ness, not human-ness, and that they have no problem with being doglike.  What is truly brilliant about his work, I think, is how flexibly he is able to accomodate and work with the various human psychology he encounters, while maintaining the integrity of his canine intentions.  He builds up even the most irrational of the people he works with, when he could easily do just the opposite, which shows that he does indeed have the dogs' best needs at heart.  You can see him adjusting his thinking about the situation and developing compassion for the human ""problems"" in each case, even as he wades in to rescue the situation for the dog.  That is a person who pays real attention.",1361491200,4,4350,4.917695473251029

I think season two is by far the best overall season for all types of dog behaviors and instruction. I purchased this one only because I think I'll be referring back to it from time to time.
I have seen results with my male dominant Basenji dog. He also is responding to the Illusion collar with walking and training. Would highly recommend it for increased control, good fit, no sliding of the leash from ears to the neck and less wear on the hairs of the neck.
All of his recommendations have worked for me and Echo is a changed dog. He and I now both enjoy our walks, training challenges, and continue to work together 24/7. Now that I know what I'm doing, he's a pleasure to work with and I'm reaping the benefits of putting my knowledge to the test and enjoying the results.",1254873600,12,837,4.3312101910828025

2851584,5,B000QXDFSA,"... about dogs, just one episode of Cesar Millans show might prove you wrong.

You can't repeat it often enough - dog training is NOT dog psychology.
As someone who grew up with a German Sheppie, learned all about ""Schutzhund"" training from an early age and later on was known as ""that lady with the polite and friendly Rottie"", I was stumped to find I have NO idea how to deal with an insecure, fearful dog. Sure, our newest addition to the family knows how to sit, stay, and all the other stuff in her sleep. But getting her to be an outgoing, happy-go-lucky pup when all she wanted was to hide behind me, was obviously beyond my abilities.

Lucky for us, along came National Geographic with the ""Dog Whisperer"" show. I didn't find out about it until mid-season one, but it proved to be a revelation- a completely different approach to helping a dog, focussed on the most simple tools: instinct and body language.

While season one helped me to observe our dog's behavior (as well as mine!) and interpret it better than I ever thought possible, season two with its increased focus on the human part of the equation has helped us all to make some significant progress.
Every single episode has excellent hints and tips - even if you see something you DON'T have a problem with, it's reassuring to know you must be doing something right (never miss an opportunity to get a boost for your calm assertive energy ;-) )
For example, our dog has no aggression issues whatsoever, but watching fearful aggressive dogs has shown me what might happen if our pack were to move in the wrong direction. The fact that she's as polite as she is large (100 lbs) means at least we're on the right track.

Apart from all that, the show is incredibly entertaining to watch, from hilarious to heart wrenching, and season two also offers some glimpses ""behind the scenes"" which give you a little insight about the human Cesar Millan.

So if you've ever shared your life with a dog or plan on doing so, I'd highly recommend watching this show - your pooch will thank you for it!",1226620800,9,2057,4.533692722371968
2851585,5,B000QXDFSA,"My Dad got a puppy.  My friend at work told me about the Dog Whisperer, so I could watch it and talk to my Dad on the phone about his puppy.  Little did I realize that I would learn so much about myself even though I don't have a dog!  (as soon as I retire, I plan to get one, though.) I have always liked cats, so this comes as a complete surprise to me that a person's realtionship with a dog can change your life in such a positive way. I use the episodes to calm me down and remind me to be calm-assertive in my life.

Laugh, if you will.  Also I have had several encounters with dogs in my neighborhood, and have immediately improved my posture, set my mind to be calm assertive, and the dogs responded.

My Dad has tried several of my (Cesar's) suggestions as well, and has had some luck with his energetic and intelligent Chihuahua puppy.  I will be visiting them in September and am interested to see if my new awareness helps me with the puppy.

I believe in what I have learned, and am employing the philosophy in my daily life.  It seems that humans react also to calm-assertive state of mind.

What a treasure this progam is to the public in general.  I have changed.
Thank you to Cesar and his production team and his pack.",1219449600,5,1236,4.194915254237288

2851590,5,B000QXDFSA,"I purchased this season set after purchasing the first season set. When comparing the two, I believe the second complete season is even better than the first. Cesar's methods are so simple in many ways, but really do make a difference. I have been able to improve my two dogs' behavior by following his methods. It truly is almost like magic. If you are debating about whether to purchase season two or season one, I would choose season two, although both are excellent.",1208563200,5,470,4.674698795180723
2851591,5,B000QXDFSA,"I defy anyone to watch Dog Whisperer and not get an uplifting surge of good feeling.  The DVD sets make a good gift for anyone who is feeling down.  Cesar and the gang* will cheer them up in no time.

The show's typical format might be termed ""Better Homes & Gardens, So-so Dogs.""  Cesar climbs into his fire-engine-red Jeep to make emergency calls at dream homes to help dogs and their owners battle their demons.

The root of the problem is that dog owners do not assume the role of ""pack leader.""  They're afraid of hurting the dog's feelings.  Someone has to be in charge, however.  It's not a democracy.

Dogs instinctively look to humans for leadership.  The dog world doesn't have indulgent mommies and daddies, just leaders and followers. Dogs are not happy in the unwanted role of de facto pack leader in a human house, so they become unbalanced. They can become unruly monsters.  They might be fearful, obsessive, aggressive, destructive, or insanely protective.  It's fascinating to observe Cesar gently counsel dog and owner alike to assume their natural roles.

The show might get stale if it was just Cesar on one emergency call after another.  Blended with these episodes are ones that show Cesar's other public-spirited exploits.  He works with dogs rescued from Hurricane Katrina.  He helps inmates of a women's prison prepare delinquent dogs for adoption.  He helps develop ""service"" dogs.

An episode addresses the growing problem of unruly dogs and inconsiderate owners at dog parks.  It may come as a surprise that there is such a thing as dog park etiquette.  The main point: the dog park is not a substitute for the walk.  Walk your dog, THEN visit the park.  Don't think you can turn your dog loose to run amok while you catch up on phone calls.

The show has plenty of laughs, from the wacky antics of the dogs and Cesar himself as he mimics dog behavior and comical human body language.

Some of the episodes are real tear-jerkers, for example ""Scared Sonny,"" featuring Cyndi Reynolds, who works at a center for humans with special needs (developmental disabilities).  She has rescued Sonny, a feral German Shepherd pup.  Cesar helps Sonny conquer his paralyzing skittishness.  Sonny warms up to the folks at Cyndi's job and starts filling a role as a therapy dog, or service dog, bringing joy to the lives of the center's clients.  As tears well up in Cesar's eyes he says Sonny's story ""will stay with me forever.""  Same here, Cesar.

In one episode Cesar shows two clients his ""relaxation space,"" a special enclosure at the Dog Psychology Center replete with futon, buddha statue, plants, etc.  I enjoy these glimpses into Cesar's personal life.  I think a lot of viewers are curious.  His life story would make a good movie.

I was surprised to see Cesar's relaxation enclosure because I assumed being with his dogs is all the relaxation he needs.  Just watch him fixing doggie dinner.  Note his blissful look.  He seems so at peace and happy mixing the chow with his hands.  He's proud of the feeding routine he has devised.  You can't get more relaxed than that.

A minor gripe:  The viewing experience with the season one DVD set is far better.  National Geographic's excellence in photography is easier to appreciate.  The season two widescreen format makes the picture look stretched or squashed and throws the framing off.

I have already touted how great the first season DVD was in my review there, so I am not going to repeat myself.  For fans of the show who came on late (like me), this is a great tool to catch up on all the past episodes.  This DVD provides hours of entertainment and the problems that he is able to cure ceases to amaze me (especially with how he deals with owners who don't ""get it"" at first).

For me his ideas are the only ones that have ever rung true.  He is never mean to the dog and he helps people see that their dog is not a little person in a fur coat.  I love my dog and to me that means fulfilling her needs, not just mine.  From the first time I watched Cesar's show he blew me away and I decided that I was going to follow his lead.  We rescued our dog and she was in terrible shape, mentally and physically, to this day I credit watching the 'Dog Whispherer' for having saved her life.

2851607,5,B000QXDFSA,"Cesar Millan has popularized and made accessible no-nonsense, practical solutions for even some of the most challenging (and sometimes hilarious) of dog behavior problems. For people who may not have access to much in the way of dog obedience classes nearby, or who don't find the local offerings working for them for whatever reason, this Season 2 compilation is affordable,convenient, and provides the added opportunity of allowing the entire family to learn together. In virtually every episode, any dog owner experiencing obedience challenges will find something to relate to and something to learn.  These episodes are also terrific because they portray a variety of households (single dog parents/blended families with children/gay & lesbian families/overly-scheduled families/single dogs/multiple dogs, etc.) all of whom are experiencing difficulties for a variety of reasons. The episodes provide many teaching moments throughout, often highlighting that everyone in the household has to be willing to be a pack leader to the dog, and consistent in their expectations and practices. Cesar has been critiqued by some for being too much of a disciplinarian, but in my experience a lack of boundaries and limits is what gets most dog parents into obedience challenges in the first place. Cesar prescribes Exercise, Discipline (rules & boundaries), and Affection--in that order, and no one should have a problem with that. What I like is that his emphasis on exercise is good for most Americans also...you can't be a couch potato and expect that your dog will be one also. I respect Cesar for telling the truth about dog behavior and obedience and for being one of the first reality-checkers to come along in a long time.",1200009600,7,1725,5.295620437956204

2851609,5,B000QXDFSA,"Cesar is motivating, fun to watch, and informative.  Each episode progresses further and further.  He brings new information, consistent and humane techniques, and gets people excited about dogs.

Our dogs have become calm, submissive, and balanced companions after using many of his psychology techniques.  Mastering the walk was crucial and it is amazing how responsive and pleasant our dogs (and some friend's dogs I've worked with) have become.

Dogs have needs very different from humans and showing them love and affection is not at the top of their list.  Showing strong leadership paired with exercise, rules, boundaries, and limitations, your dog can be what it has always been preached to be, Man's Best Friend.",1198540800,6,721,5.280701754385965
2851610,5,B000QXDFSA,"Watching Cesar rehabilitate dogs is an experience of absolutely amazement. His ability to relate to canines is almost unbelievable and I think his techniques can rehabilitate almost any dog in a humane and caring fashion. Far too many people give up on their dogs too easily when the problems of their dogs are simply a reflection of their own problems. Cesar first 'rehabilitates' owners before getting onto the job of helping a dog and implementing techniques for letting go of excess energy. For all dog lovers, Cesar is the holy grail and he's made me a lifelong fan.",1197936000,,571,4.836734693877551
