8188178,4,B000P1KHE8,I love quick workouts for my morning routines! This one will take 2-3 times of doing it to get the steps but its not hard. Didn't get my heart rate up to Zumba level but its just fine for burning a decent amount of calories when you are short on time. I have about 200 DVD's and many of them are 45-60 minutes. I have a VERY short attention span and its so hard for me to do the longer videos. I hope that the trainers keep putting out the shorter ones!! Remember that you can preview just about any of these videos on youtube.com or collagevideo.com BEFORE you buy them!,1372636800,,571,4.153153153153153
8188179,3,B000P1KHE8,"This was my first Karen Voight DVD.  She seems like a good instructor, but some of the choreography was too complex for me in this DVD.  She moved into new moves really fast, and I found myself stopping to try to figure out what she was doing.  Each time that I watched this DVD, I turned it off partway through and chose something else that I could follow and have fun with without getting frustrated.  This DVD seemed like it was at an intermediate level, but it was hard to focus on making it intense enough for me when I was concentrating on simply getting the steps right.  I really like doing half hour cardio segments, so the format of this DVD was great for me, but it's not one that I do very often.",1259971200,,708,4.214814814814815
8188180,5,B000P1KHE8,This is a great workout if you only have 30 minutes to work out.  It gets your heart rate up but you don't feel totally exhausted after you do it. Great workout.,1203206400,2,161,4.03125
