8258516,5,B0015I2S42,I ordered this disc after seeing it previewed on a Peach disc.  It showed Erin Avery was in it.  Erin has two good scenes.  Jamie Lynn and the other women all put on a good show as well.  Very pleased with this purchase.,1380931200,,220,4.046511627906977
8258517,3,B0015I2S42,"Jamie Lynn is the only reason to watch this snoozefest. The other four models are mostly no-names, with Lela Starr's being a minor-league exception.

If you've seen Peach shows before, you know the drill: Several themed solo vignettes, usually a couple of two-girl ones thrown in for good measure. Varying degrees of explicitness. Run time nearly always about an hour.

That's what you have here, except that there are just five girls, most of them unappealing (I don't know who the skinny ginger, but yuck...she looks emaciated). The production plods along and the  women seem inexperienced or uninspired, not to mention unattractive.

All in all, one of the worst Peach DVDs of the past five or six years (it was released in 2008), and without Lynn I would have given it two stars, and that only barely.",1378080000,,805,4.854014598540146
8258518,5,B0015I2S42,"Peach and Red Dragon Releasing make excellent dvds and 'Uptown Kittens' is no exception. It's a very sexy dvd and I'm glad I picked it up. This is the most recent release from Peach that I've acquired, and right now, it's pretty cool. There are five models featured here this time: Jamie Lynn, Erin Avery, Heather Carolin, Lela Star and Kina Kai. I purchased this one specifically for Heather Carolin, who is a former 2002 Playboy Playmate and a red-head lover's dream come true. She's smokin' sexy to me and it's great to see her get the true, full erotic treatment she deserves here. Just under an hour runtime with basically a chic, uptown, luxury 'loft' living theme for ambiance. Good lighting, excellent camerawork and shots and the usual languid posing Peach connoisseurs have come to expect. Since only five models are featured here, four of the five appear in two vignettes (only Lela Star has just one scene), and the feature culminates with Jamie Lynn and Heather Carolin pairing up in the final vignette for a red-hot, ultra-sapphic, lesbian lickdown that's sure to send most red-blooded male viewers into meltdown! We never really get to see any real, actual depictions of cunnilingus and therefore it can't truly be categorized as XXX, but it comes close. A great Peach release with good replay value. Highly recommended.

Oh, and while I'm at it, two personal grievances I have with Peach's dvds in general I feel like I gotta address:

1) One common element present not just in 'Uptown Kittens' but almost all of the Peach dvd releases that annoys me to no end is the fact that in nearly all of the features, the models all strip fully naked but still insist upon wearing their high-heeled shoes. Why the hell do they so stubbornly insist upon constantly keeping their shoes on??!! Is it so their feet won't get cold???!!! Geez .... somebody help me out here! Is it too much to ask for them to shed their footwear, too??? The shoes are fine if you're making a video that has a high-heel fetish theme to it, but in EVERY release it kind of starts to get annoying.

2) And by the way (and this one is directed to Peach Studios and Red Dragon Releasing, specifically), on a personal note of constructive criticism, Peach definitely needs to, um, DIVERSIFY its pool of models. As any regular viewer of Peach videos has noticed, there's a conspicuous lack of women of color in the videos ------ specifically black women. Nearly all of Peach's mainstay models are almost exclusively white. Sure, there's a few Asian and Latina chicks here and there and even an occasional gal of mixed ethinicity, but I think I have yet to see an actual, real, 100% bonafide black model appear in a Peach release. Mostly the lineup is about as lilly white as it can be. As a man who appreciates the female form in ALL of its colors and shades, I think it's very important to have ALL of those colors represented in these otherwise great feature presentations. Let's celebrate sexiness in all its colorations. Note to Peach: I implore you to please come out with an exclusive, all-black model dvd release or at least start adding in black models along with the white ones in future releases, okay? Just sayin'.",1219449600,23,3202,4.693950177935943
