8758390,4,B01EDZWHY4,"The DVD is great. Richard makes an effort to explain Krav Maga to all people.
The translation to english needs improvement, so my advice is - buy the DVD and then work on getting the most from the comments in English. Work for yourself to improve technique and use also the books to make sure details on training are matching execution.
Probably a companion site for english language is needed.
From my view I'll start providing it in the US with some more content in english language, due to copyright it is not possible to use any of the content, so as soon as possible I'll post content in the FEKM USA website that will refer to the execution with the associated time and technical program code.
Krav Maga from the EFKM is a responsible way to learn the best self defense system in  the world.",1469404800,,797,4.458904109589041
