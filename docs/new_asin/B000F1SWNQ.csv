8116488,1,B000F1SWNQ,"This series should be taken off the market. I viewed them in a class with my child, and then had to go home and say: ""But you know you should never go with a stranger, right?"" In the first episode, a few young children see a man they don't know and are afraid of him. (Good -- they're right to be cautious -- he's a stranger.) Then one boy's mother asks him to deliver a package to the man, who is named ""Mr. Wo."" Mr. Wo brings the kids into his backyard and invites them to use a building there for a playhouse. Now, no one's afraid of him anymore (and most of the parents don't know where there kids are.) In the second episode, Liz is supposed to be watching her baby brother but instead lets another friend babysit him. Liz goes off with other friends. When her mother comes home, Liz doesn't know where her friend and little brother went -- and Mom is furious. Then Mr. Wo comes home with the boy. Mr. Wo had taken him swimming -- without his mother's knowledge or permission -- and Mom's not angry with Mr. Wo at all! In view of all the problems the Church has had protecting young people, this series should NOT be used anywhere.",1486425600,,1136,4.215596330275229
