8650687,5,B00JGJIZC6,I used to watch the TVseries back in the 1980's. The movie centers around Oshin as a child. The acting and cinematography were well done. I don't often post publicly but this movie is an exception. I highly recommend this movie. The story pulls you in so deep you forget you are reading subtitles.,1459296000,,297,4.518518518518518
