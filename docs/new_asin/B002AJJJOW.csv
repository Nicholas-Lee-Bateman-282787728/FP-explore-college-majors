The reasons I liked it include the fact that they take a bull on public land in the Gila National Forest, harvest bulls humanely, and show some clear hunts. The down side is that the pacing seemed off, and made the whole video seem slow. It should be noted that this issue was fixed in later years. Yes, you will also see them discuss their products to a limited degree. Still, Will and the guys produced another video worth watching if you are an elk hunter.",1501891200,,515,4.431578947368421
