2559974,5,B000FBVDAU,"This DVD tutorial came a few days before my Boss DR-880 arrived so I took full advantage of the time to prepare.  This is an excellent tutorial. Period...  Even without having the Machine in front of me I was able to follow the instruction very closely and understood the training fully. The instruction is thorough and interesting.  The instructor actually adds some life to the training (what could have been a boring and head-banging overload). He did a great job keeping me on track and interested throughout. I know I will be reviewing this DVD tutorial time and again until I've got this thing mastered. Great DVD, great price, and a can not do without, resource. Trying to learn this machine with just the owner user manual would be utterly exhausting. Thanks again to Amazon for providing another great product.",1300752000,10,819,4.835714285714285
2559975,5,B000FBVDAU,"Great DVD and really helping me with the DR-880.

However the disappointment was the Customs Duty. I had to pay 12.43 to collect it from the Post Office. Beware if you are buying in the UK.",1265760000,,189,4.25
2559976,5,B000FBVDAU,The DVD makes learning the Roland DR-880 very clear and simple.  A must for anyone using this machine to its full and incredible capacity.,1231113600,3,138,4.75
2559977,5,B000FBVDAU,"The DR-880 is an amazing machine! It's literally a band in a box and if you love to read and figure things out for yourself, then reading the owner's manual alone will be a fun challenge for you! But if your like me and understand things better after someone shows you first, then the Roland (Boss) DR-880 DVD Owner's Manual is a must have! Everything and anything you want to know about this drum machine can be learned in minutes watching this DVD, as opposed to hours reading the manual. You want to master this drum machine, buy this DVD and thank yourself over and over and over again.",1207872000,9,590,4.422018348623853
2559978,2,B000FBVDAU,Not much help in making the DR-880 productive. A little help but I'm still not getting any songs from it.,1192233600,,105,4.3
2559979,3,B000FBVDAU,"I think a whole lot of slow down and show everything your doing, up close would be a real huge help to new owners of this type of gear, I think there is too much thinking people have experience with this stuff, and lots of small things are left out...",1419897600,,251,4.04
2559980,5,B000FBVDAU,This has helped me with some shortcuts to do what was taking hours of time to getting the same results in minutes,1418601600,,113,4.181818181818182
2559981,5,B000FBVDAU,Well Made.,1410825600,,10,4.5
2559982,5,B000FBVDAU,Essential purchase if you are lucky enough to own a DR-880!,1410134400,,59,4.454545454545454
2559983,5,B000FBVDAU,"An absolute must for any owner of the daunting DR 880! In fact, Roland should package this in the shipping box with the machine.",1396051200,,128,4.375
2559984,5,B000FBVDAU,This DVD arrived as promised and as soon as I started to watch it I had learned some important highlights. A good tool for anyone wanting to dig into the DR 880 quickly.,1393027200,,169,4.151515151515151
2559985,5,B000FBVDAU,"The DR-880 is a powerful machine and requires a learning curve.  If you start out just using the build-in patterns, the more you use it, the more features you will want to use.  The video definately helps getting started.

The real learning starts with the doing...modifying patterns and building songs.  What I first thought I understood, turned out not to be as clear as it seemed.  I continue to go back to the video and catch details that I missed...coupled with the manual, it all comes together.

My objective is to make music and not to fiddle with a machine.  After you do a few patterns and songs, the process becomes more natural.",1375401600,,640,4.610619469026549
2559986,2,B000FBVDAU,"The DR-880 is not easy to program but don't look for answers here; the producer demonstrates zero mastery of this rhythm machine.

The very best and useful features of the DR-880 Rhythm Machine are the ""FILL IN,"" ""GHOST NOTE"" and ""VELOCITY MODIFY"" features. These are the two features that will make drum tracks sound natural, human and professional -- like a real drummer.

The producer of this video omits a detailed explanation of the very important ""VELOCITY MODIFY"" claiming [paraphrased] ""you will not be able to hear this feature on your little television speakers so I'm not going to explain it."" In this, the 21st century, what electronic musician views and listens to a musical instrument training DVD on a television? Are you kidding?

The ""FILL IN"" feature is presented in all of about two minutes, essentially saying ""here it is; how cool is that? That is  very, very cool."" The FILL IN feature is comprised of 50 short and 50 long fill ins. What the producer should have told you, at the very least, is that the short fills will seem completely useless to you unless you first understand that they are best applied to a 2/4 measure. So if you need or want to use a short fill you need to apply it to a 2/4 measure and then write another 2/4 measure of your own to complete the full 4/4 measure. Or if you need short fills covering a full 4/4 measure you need to use two short fills spanning two 2/4 measures. That wouldn't be so difficult or take much time. (BTW, there are only 100 fill-ins and they can't be edited in the DR-880 -- only as a MIDI file in a DAW -- so you won't use many of them, there's a high risk of repetition. They're not as useful as you would hope.)

The Ghost Note feature is not explained well either. It requires considerable ""clean up"" if not used in a particular sequence when applying it to patterns and this DVD has nothing to offer there either.

I had close to zero experience with rhythm machines coming into this video. I already knew as much or more than the producer after having used the machine for just two weeks prior to the arrival of the video.

In the producers defense, there are a lot of features in the DR-880 and the producer felt a responsibility to cover them all. But I doubt the producer went to the trouble of creating any pro-quality tracks with the DR-880 before creating this video. It feels as though he learned just enough to _find_ all the features so that once on camera he wouldn't look silly by being completely clueless. He failed in a few places at that simple venture, too.

This video needed to be 1/3 again long or even longer. I did learn half a dozen or so undocumented shortcuts but beyond that this video offered nothing more than could have been gleaned from the manual and hands-on trial and error.

Most of the samples and signal processors in the DR-880 are great (the pads truly suck) but as much as I tried, it is a bear to program and I never got used to it. In this decade, the software and interface are just way to clunky to be truly useful. My solution was to buy a used Native Instruments ""Maschine MK I"" (dirt cheap and EVERYWHERE now that the MKII came out). The DR-880 is till worth owning for the great samples; just program in Maschine and use the DR-880's samples when they are more appropriate.

Caution: If you buy any used Native Instruments product, be absolutely certain that the original owner ""released"" the license for resale (accomplished only by the original owner on NI's website). Otherwise, even if you received the software disks with the serial numbers, that NI product is still licensed to the original owner and you will have purchased a piece of hardware that has zero functionality and no way to make it functional unless you can find the original owner and owner agrees to release it.",1370649600,9,3807,4.51233671988389
2559987,4,B000FBVDAU,I purchased this tutorial prior to my purchase of the DR-880. I used it as a review of the DR-880 and it did influence my choice.,1353110400,,129,4.0
2559988,5,B000FBVDAU,"Just what I needed to start using my DR-880's features that other ""drum machines"" don't have.  The video is easy to follow but I still need to finish it.  After watching about half of the video I was creating songs!  I have had other drum machines for years and never used the song mode, only the pattern mode...really just a fancy click track.  I think the last half of the DVD is on the more advanced functions.  I will watch that later, right now I am busy making music with my DR-880.",1350691200,,488,4.260869565217392
8120466,5,B000FBVDAU,Excellent tutorial - everything you need to learn the DR-880 inside and out!...,1524528000,,79,5.153846153846154
8120467,5,B000FBVDAU,"I teach instructional design, so am sensitive to the nature of good online or media-based training materials.  This DVD is one of the most effective tutorials I have ever seen.  It arrived on the same day as the Boss DR-800 and I'm very grateful it did.  While the DR-800 manual is very good, going through the DVD first was very helpful -- it totally demystified the nature of the device and instilled enthusiasm for using it.  The gentleman providing the instruction is fantastic.  He is clear, personable and articulate.  He has a real talent for knowing when to elaborate.  Every time I was unclear on a particular point, it was like he anticipated it and, in the next 10 seconds, addressed that point.  He also communicated his genuine appreciate for how cool a tool the DR-800 is.

I can't recommend this DVD highly enough.  I think it's saved me hours in getting up to speed.  I found it to be more than worth the money.",1492732800,,927,4.557575757575758
8120468,5,B000FBVDAU,"It is a manual and I found it to be very useful as I don't retain what I've read as well as I once did. It answered all my questions about the functions
of this unit and I would buy other products of this type from the seller. Did just what I expected it to do.",1489536000,,261,3.6785714285714284

8120474,5,B000FBVDAU,Very useful. Like having a one on one lesson. Highly recommend. It's easier to see it done than read it in the manual. Over two hours long.,1427587200,,139,4.185185185185185
