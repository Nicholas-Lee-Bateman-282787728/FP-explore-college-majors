1665997,3,B00005UM4F,"I am a great fan of Denise Austin, but this video puts significant strain on your lower back.  The workouts are effective for toning your abs.  As with many other Austin videos, I appreciate the 10-minute and 15-minute workouts for my busy schedule.  Just be sure you can afford the chiropractor bills!",1029196800,,302,4.769230769230769
1665998,5,B00005UM4F,"I just had a baby 2 months ago. I bought and started this video about 4 weeks ago, and have already noticed a difference. I'm getting my waist line back as well as shrinking my lower tummy (below my belly button). I would recomend this video to everyone who wants to tone up there tummy!",1021852800,17,287,4.236363636363636
1665999,5,B00005UM4F,"I am very happy with this video. I started six weeks ago and sure enough, I have gotten some pretty nice results. While Denise is not my favorite instructor, this video is really good!",1019174400,9,184,4.4411764705882355
1666000,2,B00005UM4F,"my husband has heard enough about me complaining that Denise Austin makes videos that seem to put the body at risk, and these ab workouts might help some, but they are very hard on the lower back and caused my intense pain, i will not keep using this video, and think many people will agree that this video is not the best ab video for all levels, it is a typical Denise Austin video that will allow you and grate on your nerves, as she does so easily...try something else!",1103414400,3,473,4.266666666666667
1666001,5,B00005UM4F,"I've been using this tape, along with the abs and legs Get Fit Fast videos, for about two weeks (one video a day). I haven't exercised in a really long time, so I consider myself a beginner.

The 10-minute session aspect of these videos makes them very accessible, especially for newbies like me who might be freaked out by jumping into a really long session.

Since there are three sessions per tape, however, you can work up to 30 minutes at a time. I try to do the full 30 minutes to get a range of movements.

Denise recommends using two different weight sets (3-5 lbs.) but I've been using only 5-lb. weights, since that's what I have. I may move up to 7-lb. weights after I get a bit stronger.

These cover a wide range of muscle groups, and none of the moves seem likely to cause injury if done properly.

The only drawback, as I've mentioned on my reviews of the other tapes in this series, is the poor quality of the tapes (fuzzy audio at higher volumes; slow rewind). At $10 each though, you could replace these if they ever break entirely. I hope they're issued on DVD eventually.",1095984000,6,1091,4.381188118811881
1666002,5,B00005UM4F,"I'm a beginner exerciser, and I've been using all three Get Fit Fast tapes (legs, arms, abs) for about two weeks now, doing a different one each day.

The abs tape is definitely the most challenging of the series for me, but that's probably because my abs are just ""flabs"" at this point.

There are three 10-minute sections, divided by difficulty. I try to do the full tape in one session, but there are a few moves that are just completely out of my league at this point. I think that's good, though, because it gives me something to work toward.

After two weeks, I can already do quite a bit more than I could in the beginning. She really emphasizes ways to avoid putting pressure on your back muscles, which is important.

The exercises target the lower and upper abs (not sure what the scientific terms are), as well as the sides of the tummy and the waist. There are also a few back exercises to strengthen those muscles and provide balance with the abs.

I'll know I've made progress when I can get through all of the exercises in the third segment. It's good to have something to work toward, and I find her chattiness encouraging, rather than annoying.

My only gripe is with the tape quality. The audio is fuzzy in some sections and they take about a million years to rewind, which my husband says can indicate poor tape quality. It would be great if these were offered in DVD format.",1095984000,24,1394,4.447058823529412
1666003,5,B00005UM4F,"I did this video faithfully for 4 weeks, until my pregnant belly wouldn't let me do push-ups anymore, but my arms improved so much it really was amazing. I can't wait until my baby is born, so that I can do this video, as well as the legs and buns, and the abs video, which I also own. It's so encouraging that I only have to work out 10-15 minutes each time and will be seeing results! It's amazing. I recommend this video very highly. You will need one set of 5-lb weights and one set of 2-3-lb weights, though, just so you know, but it works! Oh, and Denise's voice does not bother me at all - I think she sounds really sweet. I say that because some other reviewers said they didn't like it. Great video!",1088035200,9,708,4.13768115942029
1666004,5,B00005UM4F,"I do not usually take the time to write reviews, however, I must write a review for a few of Denise Austin's newer videos that I have been seeing fabulous results from recently.  I am the 35 year old mom of 3 young girls under the age of 8.  I had gained more than 40 pounds that were (VERY) unwanted, from having kids, and dating my honey in college.  Using a sensible, nutrition plan like Denise descibes in her ""Shrink your female fat zones"" - which means moderation, not short term deprivation which eventually results in you bouncing back and gaining extra pounds: Thus, I watch my carbs (focusing on consuming the ""good"" ones, eat lots of fruit and veggies, drink lots of water, and do have a sweet bite if I feel like it - but KNOW I must then go exercise it off).  I have focused on learning about ""proper"" nutrition - what foods do to me literally, and sucking it up and cutting out the bad things like transfats, refined ""dead"" flours,  and soda (yep, sorry - it can be tough to quit - but it's worth it!! And PLEASE do not drink diet sodas - unless you really are willing to accept that you may end up with Fibromyalgia or other negative side effects.  I honestly feel fabulous since cutting out soda! I do have up to 2 cups of coffee per day - using Splenda to sweeten the coffee.  For my exercise routine I am walking on my treadmill about 3 days a week (walking 2 miles at 4mph, takes 30 minutes = excellent cardio fat burner - put music cd on headset, read while walking or just get into the music and 2 miles goes by quickly) and then using Denise Austin's Get fit fast 3 video set (Abs, Arms and Shoulders, and Legs and Buns) a couple days per week, then also I have added the new Shrink you female fat zones video which is 2 - 20 minute segments - one with a stability ball, and one without.  I am telling you that this simple easy-to-follow plan rocks! The short videos are awesome spot training - and you WILL know you worked your muscles! Each of the 3 videos has 3 different segments on them; advancing in difficulty as you go.  All the newest, most effective moves are used - like ballet, kick boxing, etc. Then as far as the ""Shrink your female fat zones"" video - I just got it and I LOVE the workouts - both are short (easy to fit in with kids - you can workout while a baby is strapped in a high chair eating breakfast...hint, hint) yet like the other 3 videos, you'll KNOW you got a workout!  And the stability ball... I LOVE IT!!!  I noticed immedietly it gave me added support for my back and neck and it eliminates the need for a fancy, space-consuming weight machine!  The results: I have gone from a size 12 medium/large to a size 8 small/medium - in only 2 months!!!!!  I do not weigh myself often as per Denise Austin's teaching - because she is so right - the muscle I am creating is heavier than fat, BUT takes up MUCH less space!  I do know from the last time I weighed myself, that I only have 20 more pounds to reach my target weight of 120 pounds for my petite 5'2"" body - and I feel great!  My husband told me a couple of days ago when he pinched my rear end ;-) that he noticed how firm I am getting!!!!! YES!  I also have noticed that my abs (even after having a c-section 5 years ago) are very firm, my thighs are finally toning and shrinking, and my upper arms are finally near strapless-top condition!!  The muscles are defining and cut! I have only made changes that I could keep for LIFE and done a little exercise nearly every day, just like Denise said.  It has set the example for my children as well - since I have explained to them that the importance is that I am physically fit and strong and taking care of my muscles (which includes my heart!)  I also highly recommend getting on Denise Austin's daily motivation and nutrition/exercise email list via Lifetime - I have gained so many nuggets from Denise!  I also wanted to comment that I have been a long time (5 year) user of TaeBo - and it also is very effective and great for adding to Denise Austin's workouts for diversity.  Using TaeBo over the past 5 years I have lost more that 3 inches in each thigh, my buttocks, etc - over 25 inches lost using the diverse but simple program I described - and YOU can do it too!",1078358400,15,4229,4.222084367245658

1666006,5,B00005UM4F,I got this video acouple of months ago when i started weight watchers and i was very new with exercising. i started using it here and there and i could feel it. and now atleast 7 months later i can get through all 3 levels. and when i looked back i'm amazed at what this video has done! i could've never done this whole video 7 months ago! nor could i have gotten past the first or second level. I remember in one of my amazon lists i put this on and i put the 2nd level is really hard and now i laugh when i look at it because its a breeze for me and my abs look great now! i swear on this video and it does miracles!,1057363200,,618,3.7615384615384615
1666007,5,B00005UM4F,"I USE TO BE IN EXCELLENT SHAPE. DID CHEERLEADING AND WAS ALWAYS AT THE GYM. AFTER HAVING MY BABY, I GAINED TOO MUCH WEIGHT. I BOUGHT THIS VIDEO HOPING I COULD GET BACK IN SHAPE. I LOST 27 POUNDS BY USING THIS WORKOUT VIDEO EVERY DAY AND THEN I ALSO ADDED IN JOGGING FOR 10 MINS A DAY. NOW, THAT I AM ALMOST @ MY OLD WEIGHT, I HAVE MORE SELF CONFIDENCE AND AM HAPPIER N HEALTHY. I AM ALMOST DOWN TO A SIZE 3 AGAIN. IN THE SUMMER (AUG) OF 2002 I WORE A SIZE 9 IN JR'S. AND BY  OCT OF 2002 I WORE A SIZE 7. NOW IN JUNE OF 2003 I AM WEARING A SIZE 5!
I LOVE DENISE FOR HELPING ME THROUGH HER VIDEO.",1055721600,16,594,3.604651162790698
1666008,5,B00005UM4F,I've owned this video for two weeks now and I'm already seeing results.  There are a variety of tummy tightening exercises and it is very fun! I also learned some new exercises that I had never tried before that are very effective in tightening the upper and lower abs.  This video is fantastic and I highly recommend it!,1042761600,31,321,4.517241379310345
7954902,5,B00005UM4F,I really like this exercise video by Denise. It works!!! My abs are tighter and my waist is smaller.,1458000000,,100,4.315789473684211
7954903,4,B00005UM4F,Love it...still on the first phase. It really works your abs.,1456185600,,61,4.636363636363637
7954904,5,B00005UM4F,"Denise Austin brings us a complete 45 min.workout to work the whole entire abdominal area in 3 separate workouts! The 2 levels are each 10 min.long,and the last level is 15 min. The awesome thing about this workout is you can move at your own pace,and have time to work up to the ultimate ab workout,level 3. I have been doing this workout for around 7 weeks (3 times a week for 2 weeks)The results are so awesome! My abs are back, and strong and toned. Thanks Denise Austin!",1184371200,,475,4.348314606741573
7954905,3,B00005UM4F,"THIS VIDEO ISN'T AS BAD AS EVERYONE SAYS IT IS. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WANT YOU TO BUY HER PRODUCTS OR NOT. I PASSED BY A LOT OF STUFF BECAUSE OF WHAT PEOPLE SAID. TRUE, IT IS QUICK ROUTINES THAT IS BECAUSE SHE ONLY HAS 10 MIN. THE FIRST TWO ROUTINES, BUT IF YOU FOLLOW HER INSTRUCTIONS YOU'LL SEE RESULTS.",1148428800,,304,4.0
7954906,2,B00005UM4F,"This video has some very effective routines, but the moves are performed much too fast for safe form.  Because they are done so fast, injuries can incur.  She starts out slowly but quickly go into, what she calls, super sets.  I have several videos, and that is definitely not the proper way to super set.  Normally, you could modify the moves by performing them slower, but, because they are time crunch workouts (about 10 minutes each segment), you really don't have the time to do that.  Definitely, not one of her better videos.  The routines are easy, but because of the improper form used, not recommended for the beginner, as it could do my damage then good.  If you are a Denise Austin fan (even though her voice is a bit annoying and this is not one of her better videos, she's still a great instructor), try one of her Hit The Spot segments.",1128643200,3,851,4.487012987012987
7954907,5,B00005UM4F,"Denise does it again.  Hard to top her when it comes to spot toning.  I like her chatter as it gets you through the workout

quickly.  Her exercies work!!!  Highly recommended.",1124841600,3,176,4.548387096774194
7954908,4,B00005UM4F,"i love denise, she always gives me a good work out, and this tape is no different. if your looking to tone up your arms i would highly recomend this work out tape",1124323200,2,162,3.9393939393939394
7954909,2,B00005UM4F,"I guess studio time must be very expensive, cause Denise Austin rushes through the exercises like the set is on fire.  Maybe if she had cut down the intro, there would have been more time for exercising.

It seems a little disjointed with the constant change from floor to standing exercises.  Before you can get to the floor, the exercisers are on rep 2 or 3.  Then it's back up again.

There's a lot of talking going on, with exhortions to ""sqeeze, sqeeze, sqeeze!""  Perky is an understatement.",1124236800,,496,4.579545454545454
7954910,5,B00005UM4F,"I will still swear that Denise's ""Super Stomachs"" is my favorite ab video of all time but Get Fit Fast Abs is my number two.  This video has three short 10-15 minute levels which is great for those who don't have a lot of time to devote to working out.  The excercises are slow and controlled which makes them challenging.  Denise spends a lot of time with her back ups demonstrating the correct form and is very motivating in all the right parts when you feel like giving up.  I highly recommend this video if you want to see fast results from a short period of excercise time.",1123372800,4,578,4.324074074074074
7954911,5,B00005UM4F,"This is an excellent tape for people who have been out of the workout zone for a while.  There are three levels of workouts - each one lasting between 10-15 min.  The first two are designed to build up your strength for the third one which is pretty challenging.  Denise knows the areas that women want to work on and knows the excercises to get results.  I know a lot of people can't stand Denise for various reasons... her constant talking with ""that voice"" seems to be a big one, but I find her to be informative and motivating.  I like how she points out the correct form and give tips while her back ups perform the excercises.  I've only ever owned five pound weights but did go out and buy 3 pound weights because a few of these excercises were a little much using the heavier ones.  I highly recommend this tape for people who don't have a lot of time to work out and want to see fast results in their upper body.",1123372800,3,921,4.228571428571429
