8702710,2,B000H8RYJ0,"Capt. Ken offers a few good tips and a bit of fun watching him fish, but for the price I recommend you find something more structured and professionally produced.  The overdub of some of the most irritating and repetitive elevator music, randomly inserted in the oddest places, causes one to want to mute the audio and just watch him fish.  You can't, however, because he also randomly overdubs a good tip here and there without any order or sequence to the madness.  I gave it two stars because Capt. Ken seems like a nice guy and a knowledgeable kayak fisherman and I did get a few pointers. But I was left feeling unfulfilled and a bit cheated due to the price of the video.  The worst crime in this low budget production is his gimmick to try to get you to watch the entire video to the end.  The video starts with ""Capt. Ken"" hooking into what appears to be a big, rod-bending tarpon (although you can't see it) and the fight is on.  After a few minutes of watching the fight, he cuts away to other fishing footage while he interjects a narration or two, then every so often throughout the video he ""checks back in with Capt. Ken"" (speaking about himself in the third person) and his tarpon fight.  At the end of the video, he cuts back to ""Capt. Ken"" fighting his tarpon with his rod bent almost double, turns to the camera (which throughout the video is mounted on the stern looking over his shoulder) and comments ""I'm getting tired"" and THE END pops up on the screen.  I kid you not!  The entire video he is enticing you with this epic tarpon fight, dragging his kayak on a ""sleigh ride"", and just when you thought you are going to see this monster, he unceremoniously signs off. The End.  ""fishis interruptus"".  I haven't felt this disappointed since high school prom night.",1320969600,,1784,4.458461538461538
8702711,5,B000H8RYJ0,"This video is chock full of good information and video about fishing out of a Kayak. I started doing this sport a couple of years ago and I believe this video is the best ""education"" you can find on the subject outside of getting out there and just doing it!",1264982400,,258,4.18
8702712,5,B000H8RYJ0,This is the video for the kayak fisherman. I have seen virtually all the videos on kayak fishing and this one covers both kayaking and fishing in a way that links both subjects together and does everything except catch the fish for you. You literally feel like you are in the kayak and you are the one fighting the fish.,1220918400,,320,4.35
