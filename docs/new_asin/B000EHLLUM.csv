8109690,5,B000EHLLUM,"Yes its an older video and the characters look the age of the video (some people think they are kinda creepy, remember when this video was made its not new!) but I watched this as a child and it is a smart video for the right age group big time.  It did save me as a child, I was walking with a friend  when we noticed a sketchy car and man driving and following us as we walked along by ourselves.  We ran into the first store that came along as we walked to report him and when the police came he was gone but said there has been several reports of this car and man watching kids.  Not saying I would not have known to do something had I not seen this video, but what they show you in this video will come to mind if god forbid the situation were to come up. I'd def show it to my kids.",1421884800,2,788,3.845679012345679

8109692,5,B000EHLLUM,"I used to go around to childcare programs and teach ""Stranger Danger"" and ""Good Touch, Bad Touch"" programs and this is one of my favorite video's to use.  The kids really loved it and WANTED to watch it over and over to the point that the information was retained.  I'd suggest this video to anyone who asked me about it, it's incredible.",1268956800,6,338,4.435483870967742

8109694,5,B000EHLLUM,"When I was a little girl, my mother made me watch this movie. I loved it and watched it over and over again. One day, my friend and I were playing outside when this white sedan drove up to the side of the road where we were playing. He said he was lost, and that if we helped him find his way he would give us the stuffed animal he had. We knew what the video said to do. We took three big steps back, yelled ""NO,"" and ran directly to my mother. This sedan was eventually found and had been wanted in connection with five other abductions.
I am buying this video for my daughter, and I hope she likes it as much as I did.",1217894400,9,621,3.8976377952755907
8109695,5,B000EHLLUM,"True story. A friend of mine said her parents had her watch this video when she was little, and later on she was almost abducted, and it SAVED HER LIFE. I am buying it for my little girl today.",1217289600,2,193,3.9743589743589745
8109696,5,B000EHLLUM,This is an old childhood favorite and was thrilled to find it here.  I have three children and wanted them to share the same things that I had when I was little. I was amazed and relieved to find how wonderful condition this was in when I received it.  The picture quality is perfect and I am very pleased with my first purchase.  Thank you for bringing a classic back into my home.,1175040000,,382,4.205479452054795
