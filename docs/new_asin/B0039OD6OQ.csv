I have these on DVD but these are ones I was not necessarily going to upgrade to Blu-Ray.  But since this packaging puts the two movies at around 11.00 each it's worth it.",1275350400,3,207,4.15

8392130,5,B0039OD6OQ,"Great movies for the guys in the house.  Defiance is a little better, and has a better story line, than Enemy and the Gates.  Also the Enemy movie is very far from the correct and real story of the Russian Sniper.  He even made a number of complaints and wrote articles on how much Hollywood changed his story.  But both are great movies to watch.  Get the guys together and enjoy...",1386288000,,383,4.338028169014085
8392131,5,B0039OD6OQ,This is a great combo of movies.  each movie has its own case.  well worth watching again on blue ray,1354924800,,101,4.0
8392132,5,B0039OD6OQ,"These two films are great.  The fact that they are cheap and in a Blu ray double pack is even more awesome.
Defiance is a very different type of war movie.  It is like a cross between Band of Brothers during the siege of Bastogne and Shindler's List.  It presents a much different view of the war than the typical war dramas.

Enemy at the gates is the only major (American released) film I know of to focus on the Russians in WW 2.  Specifically it focuses on the battle of Stalingrad.  Much of the story  is embellished to create a better movie and to ad in Romance, etc but this is one of the greatest war films made in the past quarter century.",1298851200,,648,4.17741935483871
8392133,5,B0039OD6OQ,"From the packaging I thought that the movies would be in a double cheap case, but they come in their own cases which is nice. These are great movies with plenty of action and great stories. Highly recommended.",1296000000,,209,4.526315789473684
8392134,5,B0039OD6OQ,"I received my Blu Rays each in seperate cases and both cellophaned together (no slipcase). These are both great movies and being offered on value for price. These 2 are also great examples of blu ray quality.....especially Defiance! it couldn't have been better. Defiance actually is the first blu ray I have seen with a wow factor for resolution and color.

I love Enemy at the Gates, however I am put off but the blatant English accents by many of its British actors, if they're actors why couldn't they sound like Russians, to me this is a great flaw in its making otherwise a great movie. At least in Defiance they don't sound like they come from Putney Green and Brixton but eastern europe. So 'Enemy' gets deducted a star ie 4 stars for Enemy and 5 well earned top stars for defiance.

Oh, and you must watch the extras of Defiance after the movie, very informative and revealing as told by their children.

If you found any of my words helpful to you at all, please vote on it. Thanks.",1287273600,22,992,4.469613259668508
8392135,5,B0039OD6OQ,Great deal for 2 awesome movies on bluray!  They come in 2 separate bluray boxes wrapped together.,1286582400,,98,4.764705882352941
8392136,5,B0039OD6OQ,"I liked Enemy at the Gates, but i bought this set for Defiance.  Since seeing the previews I had wanted to see Defiance. Great actors in this movie, great story telling.  Looks amazing on blu ray, and I would Highly reccommend all people to see this movie & remember those who lost their lives for what they believed.",1280880000,2,317,4.448275862068965
8392137,5,B0039OD6OQ,"Enemy at the Gates is one of my favorite movies of all time.  If you enjoy WW II and/or sniper movies, I believe you too will enjoy it.  The Blu-ray version may not be a reference quality, but it is still quite good.  You can see very good detail of the buildings and streets of Stalingrad.  The movie itself is great, but watching it as a good quality  Blu-ray makes it that much better.

Defiance I have only see twice but it is also a good movie, and one that benefits greatly from being on Blu.  In several shots, the detail in the forests is fantastic, along with great facial detail. I don't like the movie as well as Enemy at the Gates, but if you are into the genre it is a must see.  Good action and a powerful look at some of the Jewish people who took a stand against the Nazis.

Getting both of these on Blu for $20 is a good deal.  For anyone who is curious, they come in their own cases just  as though you had bought them separately, but there is a cardboard cover that holds both cases together.

Overall, I agree with everything D.Doppes said in his review, right down to the 4/5 stars for Defiance and 5/5 stars for Enemy at the Gates.",1277164800,,1153,4.1441441441441444
8392138,5,B0039OD6OQ,"This is an excellent value. Two good WW2 films on blu ray for $20 bucks! The packaging contains the original art work and they include the special features from the original dvds. The movies are in seperate cases, not a cheesy single case housing both films.  Both movies benefit greatly from the blu ray treatment. If you have these movies already and thought of upgrading- this is your chance.

Enemy at the gates- I like this film for many reasons. First of all its a rare look at the eastern front. It would be great if the Russians would start making some good films about their WW2 heroics. But until that day, we will have to watch films like this and Stalingrad. I also like the battle of Stalingrad. Although this is a small part of the overall scope of the battle- these dueling snipers were a factor for moral and are a fascinating subject to learn about. The acting is very good in this film too. Ed Harris is always excellent and I think Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz were great as well. The amount of work  and detail with regards to the set and the city of Stalingrad was very well done. Even the fountain with the children and the aliigators is recreated for this movie. Great detail.

Defiance- Another subject that is rarley covered- partisans against the Nazis. These mini armies of freedom fighters were a major problem for the Germans as they advanced through newly conquered territories. That makes this subject an excellent choice for film.  Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber star as the famous Bielski brothers. There are some good action sequences here, but the film also centers on how these people made their lives work while being on the go so much. Living in the woods with a group of people adds tension and doubt. But everyone is resolute about defeating the nazis. This film also has some interesting special features.

I would rate Enemy At The Gates a 5 and Defiance a 4- but having both of these films on blu ray for $20 bucks is a 5 star deal.",1276128000,15,1989,4.5264623955431755
