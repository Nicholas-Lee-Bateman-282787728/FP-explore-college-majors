3122379,5,B00144IMHE,"To be honest, the reason I purchased Yoga Link: Core Integration a Total Abdominal Awakening wasn't because I wanted to strengthen my abs.  It was because it promised an extra feature of a Spinal Undulation.  I was curious about how Jill Miller demonstrates undulation.  In the typical fashion of not finding what you are looking for, I went through the entire DVD before I found spinal undulation in the core extra segment.  However, I was delighted to see that undulations were included in the practice and thoroughly enjoyed the entire sequence.

If you follow the DVD through the menu, you'll start with a breathing primer after the short introduction.  Miller's method of describing yoga breathing and her ability to explain why it is foundational to practice are exceptionally well done.  This segment is as valuable for advanced yogis as for beginning students.

Next on the menu is the Workshop, in which each asana is explained in detail.  If you are new to yoga or don't feel confident in your core, then it is worthwhile to learn each piece of the practice as Miller leads you through each part of the abdominal core and how it is used in the practice.  The instruction is complete including a warm up, and asanas for the diaphragm and pelvic floor, rectus abdominis and obliques (which are technically not part of the core, but important to get moving so the underlying core can activate), the transverse abdominis, psoas, and total integration.

She teaches a version of Happy Baby in the warm up segment with undulations of arms and legs.  I find this a wonderful way to gently activate the core, similar to the Waking Spider undulation (now renamed Blooming Lotus).  There are also lovely undulations in the locust sequence.  All of the poses are available to beginners, although a few progress to an advanced level.  As yoga teacher and practitioner of 9 years, I was not able to progress through the entire leg lift and side winding sequences.  Since I have the DVD, I'll be able to practice them regularly and eventually be able to complete every one.  Now that I've been through the whole DVD, I simply use the Core Integration Practice for a one hour morning practice.  I'm pleased to have a yoga practice designed by someone else that includes undulations.

Speaking of the Spinal Undulation, which is the Core Extras, Miller demonstrates a version of Cat and Cow where the movement travels sequentially through the spine.  Although I do think undulations are better experienced from internal experience rather than trying to duplicate another person's movement, in this case I find Miller's description and demonstration to be a useful aid.

Whether you are interested in strengthening your core, deepening your yoga practice, or adding undulation to yoga, this DVD has something to offer.

3122381,5,B00144IMHE,"If I had discovered this DVD prior to Jill's Quick Fix Rx DVD I might have found it a bit too slow and not really spent time on it. But her work on Quick Fix convinced me that she is brilliant. I have recently dealt with issues related to the sacroiliac joint, hip dypslasia and knee - and for each of these gaining strength and flexibility in the core has been a key to improvement. So, I decided to take the time to go through the workshop in detail, and am glad that I did.

The DVD includes a Workshop (71 min), Core Practice (57 min), breathing primer (15 min), and bonuses. The Workshop is broken into segments - timing below is from the workshop:

Core Warm Ups / Diaphragm:  (8:20)
* Bridge-based uddiyana bandha - abdominal lock in bridge pose
* Ab Baby - think of a baby on it's back with arms and legs raised and moving around, rotating to the side, and then to a flowing version of locust pose with arms and legs flowing around, and back over

Rectus Abdominals (spinal flexion) - This is the long flat muscle runs vertically in the center of your abs - the term six-pack abs is referring to this muscle. (11:41):
* Ab Mama - arms and legs overhead with a folded blanket between your legs, lifting your head and tailbone further and further
* Ab Mama with Navel Gaze - similar to the previous pose except moving your legs towards your head, and your head towards your legs
* Half Boat Pose moving to straight legs
* Locust pose with arms clasped in back, practicing abdominal breathing to raise and lower the body from the breath
* Uddiyana Bandha in Traction - abdominal lock while lying on your back, knees bent and pushing your hands against your thighs

Obliques (lateral flexion/extension/rotation):  (20:29)
* Sidewinder - on several of Jill's DVDs.  A lateral move while lying on your back and moving your and head from side to side. Very helpful for the lower back as well.
* Side Boat pose - the pose on the DVD cover
* Boomerang - a very nice side-lying lateral stretch with side extension and flexion
* Revolved Abdominal Pose - four variations: knees bent; top leg straight and bottom knee bent; legs straddled into a V overhead and meeting on the floor; both legs straight but with a hip swivel
* Gate Pose and asymmetrical Gate Pose with a block under the bent knee
* Uddiyana Bandha in Seiza - Abdominal Lock, sitting with knees bent under you, arms pushing against thighs

Transverse Abdominal - runs horizontally like a belt around the torso and helps stabilize the spine (14:51):
* Forearm bridge alternating with Locust Pose
* Tadagi Mudra on Foam Roller/Pond Seal - lying with back on a foam roller, with different variations of hand and arm movements
* Uddiyana Bandha with Knee Pop - Standing version of abdominal lock

Psoas (spinal extension):  (11:42)
Performed prone with arms stretched overhead against a wall
* Three variations of yogic leg lifts alternating legs - static (holding pose), dynamic alternating legs, dynamic with legs turned out.  The fourth variation is both legs together with one foot placed behind the other.
* Yogic leg lifts with block under sacrum and alternating legs (creates a baby backbend to isolate the psoas muscle) - static (holding pose) and dynamic alternating legs
* Static yogic leg lifts with block turned on side to raise sacrum higher and increase the backbend, alternating legs
* Uddiyana Bandha with block under sacrum

Total Integration (2:35)
* Runners Lunge on Block

Core Extras include Agni Sara and Spinal Undulation

I completed the Workshop over two sessions before completing the Practice. I enjoyed the Practice more than the Workshop as it flowed better, although certainly best to go through the Workshop first!

I did find the Practice a bit choppy as you grab for this thing or that, or re-arrange your mat, but all in all I really enjoyed it.  I like that she works each side independently for the obliques, transverse abdominis, and psoas - I have hip dysplasia and I am definitely weaker on my right side than my left.  I was prepared to stop the Psoas work at the point she put the block under the sacrum as not sure that was good for my hip, but it actually was fine.  Maybe a little sore after, but not bad. (I found the Runners sequence on Jill's Post Athletic Stretch DVD was perfect after Core Integration).

I do wish she had chaptered the Practice similar to how she did on the Workshop.  Even better, I wish she had included a shorter version of the Practice, maybe a 20-30 minute version, as an hour seemed a little long and may be difficult to fit in with everything else I do.  But overall, this is a terrific DVD and one I'm glad to have added to my library.",1273795200,17,4667,4.565269461077844

Don't worry there are modifications for the props! The practice has all these new yoga poses, for me, that I have never done-so, watch the workshop/instructional section. I've been practicing yoga for some time and I found these exercises challenging in a new, enjoyable way.

3122383,5,B00144IMHE,"This is a very complete core workout. It is intended for yoga practioners, but anyone would benefit from it really. There's a workshop section where Jill Miller gives a clear explanation of the exercises and a practice section which obviously is meant to lead you during your practice. The exercises are hard and you won't smile as much as Jill when you perform them. A small minus: the practice session is one hour long and there's no shortened version.",1259020800,4,454,4.7594936708860756
3122384,5,B00144IMHE,"This DVD is part of the Yoga Link series produced by the Pranamaya web site. The instructor for this series is Jill Miller, who had previously created her own self-produced video series called Yoga Tune Up (and who now has a web site under this same name). This Pranamaya series incorporates many aspects of Miller's prior work but adds excellent production values plus a variety of additional workout and DVD options. For starters, there are two main aspects to this DVD, the Core Workshop, in which Miller uses live instruction to break down the individual moves in great detail, and the Core Practice, which Miller presents the same exercises via voiceover for a more flowing practice experience. Also included is a 15-minute Breathing Primer: this same segment appears on all three of the DVDs in the Yoga Link series, and it offers an opportunity to obtain detailed instruction on the types of pranayama, or yogic breathing, which Miller utilizes in these practices.

The Core Workshop further breaks down into several segments.  In the 3-minute Core Muscle Primer, Miller reviews each of the muscles that make up the ""core"" of the body as well as their various directions of movement.  The workshop itself is 71 minutes long (the longest of the three Yoga Link DVDs), and then there are two ""Core Extras"" which review more specific techniques, Agni Sara (2m), an abdominal rolling motion, and Spinal Undulation (3m), a spinal rolling motion.  There is also a submenu which lists the chapters of the workshop as follows:

Props for Core Sequence
Core Warm Ups/Diaphragm
Rectus Abdominals * (spinal flexion)
Obliques * (lateral flexion/extension/rotation)
Transverse Abdominal
Psoas * (spinal extension)
Total Integration

As you can see from the above, Miller's aim is to address every muscle in the core region, taking these muscle in every possible direction of movement.  To do this, she uses various props, including a yoga block, blanket, wall, and a foam roller (in her props intro, she provides instructions on approximating a roller using a yoga mat and blanket if needed).  Miller also borrows some of her moves from her previous homegrown videos; I recognized several of the exercises from both her Spinal Tune Up and her Triangle Tune Up DVDs.  There is no relaxation to conclude the workshop, but a brief (2.5 minutes) savasana occurs at the end of the Core Practice, which comes in at 57 minutes total.

One of the the things I liked best about this DVD is that Miller teaches unique techniques for achieving uddiyana bandha, or the abdominal lock, throughout.  I actually liked the first, ""Bridge-Based Uddiyana Bandha,"" the best, but Miller offers several other exercises to help you achieve uddiyana from either a lying, seated, kneeling, or standing position.  One (minor) thing that I didn't like about the sessions is that Miller occasionally gets a bit too fussy with the props--she makes a joke about snapping her fingers and suddenly having a bare floor to practice on, but obviously, those following along at home cannot adapt so easily.

Overall, I think this is definitely an excellent DVD to work on building core strength from all angles.  Miller has clearly made a name for herself based on her amazing knowledge of yoga anatomy and her ability to translate that knowledge into incredibly useful, valuable, and enjoyable yoga practices that deserve a place on the shelf of any intermediate to advanced yoga student.",1250467200,10,3448,5.036906854130053
3122385,5,B00144IMHE,"I've been buying Jill Miller's DVDs (and CD) for quite a while and have always found them to be very helpful in my home yoga practice.  Since they've been self produced (until this series) they've seemed a little homemade, although I love them anyway.

With this Pranamaya series the sound issues and editing have improved greatly, moving her videos to a new level and, I hope, opens her approach to a wider audience.  Jill's focus on the core is deep and intense. She makes it possible to understand and connect to how the core works as stabilizer for the spine and as conduit for movement.  I particurly like how she uses bridge to sync with uddiyana bandha and offer a progression toward nauli -- side boat is also innovative.

The instruction is terrific, as is Jill's own execution.  Jill is very direct and down to earth (and funny).  Her language is refreshingly concrete, rather than poetic. And, best of all, she's not chirpy!

The design of this DVD is very user friendly: there's a 50+ min. practice, a 70+ minute tutorial (wonderful, slower and more detailed look at the principals in use) and a 16 min. breathing primer.  The material is well-chaptered so you can work selectively.

My only quibble is that the interior seems a tiny bit too stylist-driven.

I've been a home exerciser for over 20 years, have been doing yoga daily for over 10 years (including a teacher training).  I think this DVD is best for somewhat experienced practitioners (experienced beginners+) who already have some sense of their core.

8254279,5,B00144IMHE,"I bought her hip and core dvds so much I looked online for an upper body dvd by her and found that if I'd bought all three in a package I would have saved $20! I suggest going for the package. Really. I'm kicking myself now.
Oh, and she's nothing like any other yoga instructor I've used. I love kundalini and astanga. I always thought hatha was for wimps. NNNNNNOOOOOOOOO. The style, as done by Jill Miller, is awesome. If you do Power, Ashtanga, Kudalini (all with better or worse instructors) and you didn't think Hatha had anything to offer anyone under 80, you are in for a treat.",1358467200,5,585,4.376146788990826
8254280,5,B00144IMHE,"This DVD is part of the Yoga Link series produced by Pranamaya. The instructor for this series is Jill Miller, who had previously created her own self-produced video series called Yoga Tune Up (and who now has a web site under this same name). This Pranamaya series (which also includes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Link-Shoulder-Shape-Up-with-Jill-Miller/dp/B00144IMHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Link: Shoulder Shape-Up with Jill Miller</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Link-Hip-Helpers-with-Jill-Miller/dp/B00144IMHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Link: Hip Helpers with Jill Miller</a>) incorporates many aspects of Miller's prior work but adds excellent production values plus a variety of additional workout and DVD options. For starters, there are two main aspects to this DVD, the Core Workshop, in which Miller uses live instruction to break down the individual moves in great detail, and the Core Practice, which Miller presents the same exercises via voiceover for a more flowing practice experience. Also included is a 15-minute Breathing Primer: this same segment appears on all three of the DVDs in the Yoga Link series, and it offers an opportunity to obtain detailed instruction on the types of pranayama, or yogic breathing, which Miller utilizes in these practices.

The Core Workshop further breaks down into several segments. In the 3-minute Core Muscle Primer, Miller reviews each of the muscles that make up the ""core"" of the body as well as their various directions of movement. The workshop itself is 71 minutes long (the longest of the three Yoga Link DVDs), and then there are two ""Core Extras"" which review more specific techniques, Agni Sara (2m), an abdominal rolling motion, and Spinal Undulation (3m), a spinal rolling motion. There is also a submenu which lists the chapters of the workshop as follows:

Props for Core Sequence
Core Warm Ups/Diaphragm
Rectus Abdominals * (spinal flexion)
Obliques * (lateral flexion/extension/rotation)
Transverse Abdominal
Psoas * (spinal extension)
Total Integration

As you can see from the above, Miller's aim is to address every muscle in the core region, taking these muscle in every possible direction of movement. To do this, she uses various props, including a yoga block, blanket, wall, and a foam roller (in her props intro, she provides instructions on approximating a roller using a yoga mat and blanket if needed). Miller also borrows some of her moves from her previous homegrown videos; I recognized several of the exercises from both her Spinal Tune Up and her Triangle Tune Up DVDs. There is no relaxation to conclude the workshop, but a brief (2.5 minutes) savasana occurs at the end of the Core Practice, which comes in at 57 minutes total.

One of the the things I liked best about this DVD is that Miller teaches unique techniques for achieving uddiyana bandha, or the abdominal lock, throughout. I actually liked the first, ""Bridge-Based Uddiyana Bandha,"" the best, but Miller offers several other exercises to help you achieve uddiyana from either a lying, seated, kneeling, or standing position. One (minor) thing that I didn't like about the sessions is that Miller occasionally gets a bit too fussy with the props--she makes a joke about snapping her fingers and suddenly having a bare floor to practice on, but obviously, those following along at home cannot adapt so easily.

Overall, I think this is definitely an excellent DVD to work on building core strength from all angles, although I would suggest that it is most appropriate for experienced yogis at the intermediate level and above.",1292544000,3,3702,5.603571428571429
