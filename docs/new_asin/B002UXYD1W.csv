3993638,5,B002UXYD1W,"We got this for our daughter who loves Fraggle Rock.  She's had the complete original series for quite some time, but she had only caught glimpses of the animated series.  Now she's hooked.  She doesn't even seem to be bothered that the voices are different.  It's not as good as the original series, but that's a tough act to follow after all.  If you are a Fraggle Rock fan, this is a must-have.  It's lots of fun and gives a glimpse back to a simpler time with less focus on cutting edge animation and more focus on telling fun stories.  If you've never seen the original series or didn't enjoy the muppets, you should definitely give this a shot.",1300233600,2,650,4.411764705882353
3993639,4,B002UXYD1W,I loved this show growing up. Fraggle Rock as a cartoon was great and alot of fun. i just wish that it had lasted longer than it did...,1278115200,,135,3.857142857142857
3993640,5,B002UXYD1W,"Hello I purchased this set from amazon about 2 years ago when it first came out in Australia.  I have enjoyed this show so much and I will definatly be purchasing this to show support from the dvds in my country.
Also I really like the cover art better than the one I have now lol.
Anyway the episodes are great, and if you were a child in the mid 80's you know that there was nothing like running to the tv in your under roo's getting a big bowl of cereal and watching Saturday morning cartoons... I am lucky I have been doing this with my children now for almost 2 years. This is one of those dvds that needs to be with your set. No Fraggle collection is complete without it.
I know mine wasn't hence the reasoning for getting it from another country.
Again this dvd will so be worth it, and with the low price why shouldn't you?
This is a show that you will want to have the family gather around and watch, even if you don't have kids and are feeling nastaulgic pick it up, its worth the money you invest.",1257120000,6,1008,4.116751269035533

3993642,4,B002UXYD1W,"This show is worth taking a look at for fans of the original Fraggle Rock and 80s animation fans. The writing is fairly good, though not in the same league as the original show. The animation is above-average for the era, though not so good that I'd recommend the series on its weight alone. The voice acting is quite nice; while a different cast than in the original show they manage to sound fairly similar to the original cast.

All in all, it's not going to blow anyone away with its quality, but it's a fun way to pass the time.",1438214400,,533,4.2772277227722775

3993644,4,B002UXYD1W,I'm a cartoon collector of sorts.  I collect cartoons from the 80's and 90's.  This was a cute little show that was made from the original Fraggle Rock that used muppets.  This is the animated version but is still good.  It has all the episodes of the animated show.  Great little gem.,1420502400,,285,4.403846153846154

3993648,4,B002UXYD1W,"If you love Fraggles, or just 80's cartoons, you'll love it. A lot of the songs are there, two seasons for a great price! The animation is rough, but hey, what do you expect! it's on-par with like She-ra and He-man and Wuzzles. If all this sounds good, get it!",1341878400,,260,4.22
3993649,4,B002UXYD1W,"As a child of the 80's, I recall a great many good and terrible cartoons of the era. For whatever reason, Fraggle Rock and its spin-off animated cousin always held a somewhat special place in my memory.

So, just for old time's sake, I picked up the animated series to re-watch it. It's neither as great as I remember, nor as bad as it could have been. But, I think that, as an 80's cartoon, it stands up pretty well to the test of time and probably rivals such classics as Muppet Babies and the Smurfs, despite its short run-time (2 discs, somewhere around 14-16 episodes?). Strangely enough, after watching it, it does kind of make me nostalgic enough to want to check out the original Jim Henson muppet-y original...

It's aimed at the young'ns, probably 4-8 y/o? It's colorful, it's got a lot of the 80's ""built-in messages"" about friendship, trust, courage, etc. It's a bit nonsensical at times, especially since they like to make up random pseudo-baby talk-ish nonsense phrases. While kind of catchy, they're also a little annoying. Most episodes have a very brief musical number of some sort. Maybe a minute or two.

Unlike so many cartoons aimed at kids today, this show didn't pander too much to the educational mottos of repetition and such that you see all over young kids programming today (Dora, etc.). Rather it just providers cartoonish kid-level adventures with good dialogue / ""messages"" etc. I think that most young'ns would probably enjoy it considerably, as would a few of their parents, who grew up with it themselves.

Overall, it's not the greatest cartoon out there, but it's pretty good. If you want a popular show, see Scooby Doo or the Smurfs. If you want to go off the beaten track see this one. For the $8-15 you might spend on it, I'm pretty sure it'll give your kids hours of enjoyment.

Ohh, and as far as special features go, well, a little out of luck there. The discs have a play all feature and the ability to select specific episodes, but not much beyond that. But the picture looks good and the audio seemed good too. Just don't leave it on the main menu screen too long or the theme song on repeat MAY drive you temporarily insane. Fair warning! Heh.",1332460800,2,2189,4.602564102564102
3993650,5,B002UXYD1W,"Watching the Fraggle's is like getting home from school and forgetting the woes of the day to immerse yourself in imagination, exploration and of corse the magick of Jim Henson!
