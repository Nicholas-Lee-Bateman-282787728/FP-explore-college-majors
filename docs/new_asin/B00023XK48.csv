Super Natural (not featured here) and Captain Underpants have become a fixture of our lives, pretty much.  We picked this up at the last show we saw for Santa this Christmas.  Well, she uses every minute of her TV time to watch this video!  And what inspired me to leave this review is that my daughter is currently drawing a picture of Sleeping Beauty and Winky, talking animatedly about the silly characters and quoting them.  Fifteen minutes ago, she had a scarf tied over her shoulders, pretending to be Super Natural herself.  I just hope that, with the Denver library's awesome Super Saturday program coming to an end, we'll be able to catch a live performance or two in 2010.  As good as the video is, they are even better live.  Mia and Jeff hit all the right notes for the kids and manage to entertain the adults accompanying them as well. Great stuff, pick it up!",1262131200,,1014,4.502732240437158
8021579,5,B00023XK48,"My 3 daughters aged 9, 6 and 22 months all laugh out loud at the zany antics of these two original children's performers.  There is nothing commercial or ""disney-fied"" about the twisted takes on classic fairy tales and original stories.  They even throw some bits in for mom or dad to chuckle.  I hope they come out with a part II soon to keep us laughing!",1252800000,,356,4.363636363636363

This type of entertainment is what is proving to be the glue that keeps families (however you define yours) hanging out, instead of spread out all over the house. Kids think The Play-Ground Theatre antics are really funny and parents will appreciate the humor as well. I always keep a copy of this close by and I've given several copies as presents, always to a terrific response. You won't be disappointed with this DVD.",1084406400,,464,4.602409638554217
