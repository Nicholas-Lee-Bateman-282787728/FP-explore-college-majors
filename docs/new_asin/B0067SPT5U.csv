8494444,5,B0067SPT5U,"I think fly fishing DVDs are hit or miss: They either have great fishing action, scenery and fish OR they are focused on conceited, overpaid guides who just gloat about how great they are.  This one is mostly a good DVD, but does contain a small amount of the 'personality/character' aspect but it comes off in a tasteful amount.

The first section of the DVD is of two men in Minnesota and the DVD gets a little tiring and slow during that part, hearing them talk of how great of anglers and how super they are without showing the fishing, but after that scene it slowly takes off, and soon you realize you are seeing great action, great casts, great fishing and great scenery.  They still touch on the personalities, but it is all about the fishing.  I had almost given up on buying fishing DVDs and this one, while not perfect (in my opinion-how I define what a good fishing DVD is all about) is worth $25 or so.  Its not one solid video, but 2 medium-long videos and a number of smaller clips that are entertaining.  As with most fishing DVDs, the music is well integrated and cool.

In short, while the movie drags and stutters at times highlighting the overdone backstories of the guides, it is full of great fishing action and will keep you locked in for a few hours.",1390608000,2,1274,4.418803418803419
8494445,4,B0067SPT5U,This flick puts you in the mood to throw some line. It also gives you a healthy breadth of fly fishing technique and places. I personally liked the section on western US flyfishing (cause that's what I do). Entertaining and informative.,1351814400,5,236,4.780487804878049
