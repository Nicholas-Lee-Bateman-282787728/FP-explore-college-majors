8522474,2,B007WB5DKC,"Despite its brevity, ""La Vida Breve"" is not the most dramatic of operas. That might explain why it is seldom produced. However, it is graced with a beautiful early Falla score, and therefore deserves to be heard......but not necessarily seen. Thia production hardly makes a case for the opera. To begin with, the Salud, while affecting as an actress, is not an optimum singer. Her quavery voice is not always attractive, she seems to have difficulties in the upper register, and I noticed a tendency to have to find the note. The real deal killer, for me, is the production itself. Not only is the set purely minimalist, but the stage lighting is so monochromatically red, that it is actually difficult to watch. I mean everything is red, from the sets and costumes to the performers' skin, eyes and teeth. Furthermore, your HD monitor may have trouble making sense of all this, as the color blossoms out, and artifacts commonly appear. My suggestion is to skip this, and try either the great De Los Angeles or Berganza audio recordings.",1372636800,5,1037,4.798882681564246
8522475,1,B007WB5DKC,"This work has maybe 10 minutes that provide any pleasure, mostly the well-known dances. The plot is a trivial Spanish mini-melodrama, with the usual clichs and a lot of atmosphere. The story is rather crudely developed dramatically. The stage is too dark and as a result the singers' skins have ugly artifacts - the video quality is poor. The orchestra is well miked but the singers sound as if they sing from another space - both audio mixes are simply botched. This review will receive of course a lot of negative votes, but believe the positive reviews at your own risk.",1346803200,3,573,4.683168316831683
8522476,5,B007WB5DKC,"I have always been fond of de Falla's instrumental music, but my exposure to this opera has been limited to the orchestral dance music from it. However, coming in at just over an hour, it should appeal to more than just the diehard opera buffs. The music is an amalgam of Andalusian rhythms and French impressionist harmonies. The arias owe a great deal to Puccini.

The plot is definitely of the ""he done me wrong"" variety. The lower class heroine, who does most of the singing goes by the name of Salud, and is cheated on by Paco, a high born cad, who has been planning all along to marry a woman of his own class, while helping himself to a little Salud on the side. I must have been hungry when I first watched this, because all I could think of was how close Paco & Salud was to Taco and Salad.

The Chilean soprano, Christina Gallardo-Domas, exhibiting copious amounts of cleavage, does a bang-up job playing Salud, wild-eyed and ready for combat with Paco - she's a more enticing proposition altogether than the rather sedate fiancee alternative. She has sung Mimi (Boheme) and Butterfly, so her Puccini-style chops are well developed.

The rest of the parts are small, but well sung, particularly the Flamenco singer, Esperanza Fernandez, who captures the non-vibrato, shout-y quality of that style admirably. The dances are well played and choreographed.

The very minimalist staging offered here is quite fitting for this opera - it keeps everything in focus.

Lorin Maazel conducts the Valencia orchestra very idiomatically, capturing the Andalusian color to great effect.

Video in bluray and the DTS-Master Audio sound is beyond reproach. I don't often watch the same opera over and over again in the first week, but this one I did. Very enjoyable. In a lot of operas, the casting can be iffy, heroines either being too old or too Reubenesque or both, but Gallardo-Tomas is perfect in the role of Salud. It makes the singing all the more believable.

Give it a try!",1345075200,5,1978,4.7492711370262395
8522477,4,B007WB5DKC,"This is a relatively short, about an hour, Spanish Opera. The dances are well known, so it is interesting to be able to watch and listen to the whole Opera.  The staging is minimalistic and, in my opinion, very effective. The drama is almost all played by Salud (Gallardo-Dumas), and this production is very inventive and in fact Salud is on stage almost all the time.  Gallardo-Dumas is a very good actor, and she has to be to respond to the requirements imposed by the director. There are some small changes and variations from the original vision as detailed by the composer, which I think enhances the drama. In terms of the music, I found Gallardo-Dumas voice a little bet harsh, in particular in the high tones. I don't know if this is a result of the sound recording or she sang that way in front of the audience. In any case, I strongly recommend this BlueRay. The dramatization is interesting and profound. The music beautiful, and the overall experience enjoyable.",1341792000,8,974,4.690058479532164
8522478,4,B007WB5DKC,"This opera is considered by many to be the outstanding Spanish opera. Performances of it are relatively rare though and so this recording has to be seen as a significant event. It is unlikely that there will be a great deal of choice for purchasers in the near future so it is fortunate that this disc can be seen as generally successful but very much on its own terms as follows:

The plot is very straightforward as befits a short opera lasting in this case for just 81 minutes. Essentially the plot concerns a gypsy girl of a low social order who has become amorously involved with a wealthy Spaniard of a higher social level. The first act concentrates on the social divide as illustrated by the off-stage chorus taking the part of the local forge workers who see themselves as the anvil rather than the hammer in social terms. The gypsy girl relates to this and fears for her future with her wealthier lover.

Meanwhile her fears are shown to be well founded as her lover is due to marry a similarly advantaged girl the following day. This information is discovered by the girl's relations who choose not to pass on the information. The second act concerns her discovery of the marriage, her attendance at the post wedding celebrations and her eventual exposure of the duplicitous lover. She then dies having guided her knife, now held by the groom, into her own body.

The action in this production is very static, almost presented as a series of cameos. This is particularly true of the second act. The intention presumably is to throw the whole of the drama onto the girl, her feelings and her reactions. This is a heavy responsibility and Chilean soprano, Christina Gallardo-Domas, rises superbly to the challenges throughout. It reminded me of her fine acting and singing abilities as shown in her portrayal as Mimi in an earlier Boheme. The rather minor supporting roles of Paco the groom and her two relatives are done as well as could be expected in these circumstances.

The chorus sings excellently, mostly off-stage, and the orchestra under Maazel are equally good. The flamenco singing and the Spanish dancing after the wedding are all well performed in convincing idiomatic style. The staging is minimalist as might be expected in this production and largely consists of high red walls which act as a backdrop to the action. This is complemented by the use of subdued lighting effects to emphasise the drama as part of the staging options which is arguably appropriate given the dark nature of the plot. On its own terms this minimalist conception remains an effective experience.

The actual recording offers crisp imaging and involving camera work which is sympathetic to the concepts presented. It copes with the rather dark settings remarkably well and the definition and depth of the colour range is very successful. The sound is presented in DTS-HD 5.1 and stereo and delivers a satisfyingly wide range and definition.

I found this to be an interesting performance and production although it is possible to imagine that it might be possible to offer less minimalist approaches to presenting the opera. The music is still well worth owning as an example of a major Spanish opera and the musical values of this production remain consistently excellent and the leading role of the gypsy girl offers a stand-out performance by Christina Gallardo-Domas as mentioned earlier.

In conclusion, I would suggest that, provided that a minimalist production is acceptable, this disc would be worth considering for purchase, especially as it is not likely that there will be many alternatives to choose from in the near future.",1341532800,3,3639,4.907317073170732
