8245296,3,B0012DUD60,"As long as it was free, it was worth watching. As noted in other reviews, the historical narrative was very poorly written with English grammar so bad that it was often a bit funny. Still the home-movie quality videos of Japanese shrines was of interesting Japanese Shinto and Buddhist shrines so that was interesting. As long as it stays FREE, it's okay. Otherwise, skip it and most other Flying Monk Films. At least, they are consistent.",1473897600,,439,4.7894736842105265
8245297,3,B0012DUD60,Please note that this is more of a home video montage rather than a true professionally made travel video. Some footage is shaky and the camera work is so-so.,1440979200,,158,4.482758620689655

8245301,3,B0012DUD60,The quality of the video wasn't that great; narration was mediocre at best and the historical content was no better than a tourist pamphlet.,1395100800,,140,4.875
