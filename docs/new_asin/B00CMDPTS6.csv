5726648,5,B00CMDPTS6,"Awesome show! I loved watching it when I lived in London. The family is out of control but they will help you if you ever need them. This show is in no way, shape, or form for the sensitive viewer",1387670400,2,196,3.925
5726649,3,B00CMDPTS6,"1st season is great,then apparently they decided to turn american sitcom like,and it turned rather mindless. I still love Lip. Cute guy.",1382227200,,136,5.2272727272727275
5726650,5,B00CMDPTS6,"I've watched Shameless (UK version only; have seen American version but just a carbon copy of the master) over & over, including all 11 seasons. It all starts here: Shameless 1 & 2. But these are the only seasons available in region 1, which works on DVD systems in North America only. So, wake up British distributors, Americans want all the series available. Shameless is the quintessential show about everything bad, wrong, f'd up, & bizarre; then it's the funniest show you've ever belly-laughed at; then it's the most poignant & sentimental. My only negative is the Pikey accents the cast talks in, which makes it harder to understand than other British dialects.  But subtitles takes care of that. Shameless is in my top 5 shows of all time, & I have discriminating, eclectic tastes. If you watch this show & are not mesmerized by the complex characters teetering from one side of the moral spectrum to the other, then you're just not paying close enough attention.",1380844800,26,971,4.81437125748503
5726651,1,B00CMDPTS6,"I love Shameless on television.  However, DVD #1 will not play on either of our machines.
The display reads ""Error"".  The machine accepts DVD #2 and I hope to enjoy it later today.
But so far I'm not impressed ... Not with Shameless but with the product received.
This is the first year I've experienced problems with purchases thru Amazon.",1379548800,,340,4.65
5726652,5,B00CMDPTS6,"I am now addicted to this series. It is funny, It is also a bit raunchy and has some violence so not a great series for little ones at all. However, it does show the funny side of community in UK quite clearly. I bought more to send to family for Xmas. Watching for good pricing on the next Region 1 seasons to come to Amazon.",1378339200,,326,3.9545454545454546
5726653,4,B00CMDPTS6,"While I really enjoyed season one, I found season two to be very disappointing, with a dramatic drop in the quality of the scripts, and a sometimes drastic change in the behaviour of the characters compared to season one. Season two varies from clumsy to just plain stupid and awful.
If you can get it cheap, it's worth it just for season one.",1375833600,,343,4.4603174603174605
5726654,5,B00CMDPTS6,Having watched the US shows and thoroughly enjoyed them I now know why people were raving about the UK original. I liked them both and it's great fun comparing the actors playing the different characters from each version.,1375401600,5,222,4.868421052631579
5726655,1,B00CMDPTS6,"The UK version of Shameless is an excellent show. I was very happy when I saw that they were making some seasons available on dvd. Unfortunately, this release does not have subtitles. While the cast is speaking English, it is very difficult to understand much of what they are saying due to the dialect. Half the fun is in being able to understand what they are saying. Without subtitles, I can't give this dvd release more than one star. I'm disappointed.",1375056000,12,456,4.6419753086419755
5726666,5,B00CMDPTS6,"After watching The Graham Norton Show for the past few months non stop  I quickly sharpened my ear to British Dialect and Language thus making it easy for me to understand.
I so fell in love with this cast. UK's  Lip is so adorable and cute and I am mad in love with James Mcavoy.  If you love the US version than purchasing this and adding it to your collection is a must. It is interesting to watch and compare the storylines of both. It's a Bonus having both versions.",1471132800,,471,4.211111111111111

5726672,1,B00CMDPTS6,Nothing but nasty. We were outraged about how nasty it was and absolutly no where near the describtion of it. Its obvious whoever wrote the describtion never watched it. After about 12 min. Into the first show we turned it off and threw the whole series in the trash where it belongs forever.,1456531200,,292,4.528301886792453
5726673,1,B00CMDPTS6,"The most overrated British sitcom of all time.

Firstly, the writing is just silly.  Basically the Jerry Springer show turned into a sitcom.  Banal and prosaic.  Secondly, the lower class accents are so strong, most Americans will struggle to understand a word of it.  What's worse--NO SUBTITLES. I was literally raised on British television, music, and film, but even I had a hard time it.

I regret not demanding a refund.",1456531200,3,424,4.901408450704225
5726674,5,B00CMDPTS6,I love this show however I need to find out who I got it from as two of the cds skip and I am super super pissed WTF! It took me FOREVER TO FIND THE UK VERSION. I LOVE THE CAST AND EVERYTHING ABOUT THE SHOW! BUT I AM SO MAD ABOUT THE DAMAGE AND WANT A SERIOUS WORKING PERFECT CDS OF SHAMELESS! WTF!!!!!!!!!!!,1456185600,,308,3.828125
5726675,4,B00CMDPTS6,"First off my interest in this series started with the American version of this series, I had heard people talking about it and how good it was so I started looking at reviews for the show and saw that they were all good (also found out William h masey was the lead actor who is one of my favorite actors, you must see a little gem called PLEASANTVILLE everyone should see this movie simply amazing!!) So I became very interested in the series, since I don't have cable I decided to buy the seasons so I promptly went to Amazon to look for it and was surprised to find the original UK version, so I thought to myself it would be nice to see where it all started and let me tell you I am VERY GLAD I DID! This is an excellent show (from what I know there were only seasons 1&2 made and was shown on the BBC which is great Britain they stopped making episodes when it was Americanized which is a shame) excellent acting performances all around even from the people who pop in and out and are not members of the cast, you will laugh, you will cry, you will cheer and the best part you will care about Fiona and her brood, even the no good alcoholic father who left them and mother who ran off to be with her lesbian lover will make you care about them too, family values? Completely thrown out the window!! but are they?? I cannot say enough good things about this show if only American shows were made like this, there is cussing and nudity so it's not for the little ones but do yourself a favor as a adult and get this series YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!! my only gripe is and the fact that I didn't give this a five star rating, the British accent it is soo thick that in some cases you will often find yourself rewinding just to understand what is being said, with the American version now taking over I have a feeling you won't be able to get this for much longer so do yourself a favor and get it.",1453593600,3,1901,4.140540540540541
5726676,5,B00CMDPTS6,"Hadn't followed ""Smike"" since Nicholas Nickleby, but David Threlfall is a great Frank. I think William H. Macy outdoes him, but that's just my preference. A great series that makes you laugh and cry at the same time.",1448841600,,216,4.7105263157894735

5726681,4,B00CMDPTS6,Not as good as Anerican series. I think just about all the actors in the U.S. version are better. Most of the plot lines in the Brit version were followed in the U.S. Version,1435622400,,174,4.147058823529412

5726685,4,B00CMDPTS6,"Very interesting series, wild characters, and it's fun to see James McAvoy and Ann-Marie Duff in a story together--great chemistry.  But the US version desperately needs subtitles--sorry, but with the strong accents and regional dialects, it's just too much to fully grasp.  Lots of rewinding/replaying to catch what was said (especially for the drunk Dad).",1430265600,2,357,5.472727272727273

5726695,5,B00CMDPTS6,"Even though I am 84 years old, I fell in love with the car thief (James McAvoy).  This is a very funny series and I am so thankful that I can finally see year 2.
This series was so funny that the Americans copied it.  All the ad libs that James and his wife made were copied into the script in the American version.
I wrote many times asking for year two that would play on an American DVD player. I was delighted when I saw that it is now available.  I have loaned my copy of Shameless year one to many people. One person I worked with had a wife who had a broken leg.  He said she loved year one and played it over and over again.",1414972800,,632,3.875968992248062

5726697,4,B00CMDPTS6,"This is a funny, raunchy series, and my husband and I have enjoyed it.  There is a problem, though, because when I bought it I thought it had subtitles.  There are so many British accents, some much broader than others.  This is often difficult to understand and we just figure out things by the plot.  Some have the gift of understanding heavy accents, but we don't.",1410048000,6,367,4.515151515151516

5726700,5,B00CMDPTS6,"I caught the first few seasons, beginning reluctantly, on Netflix. I manage to find ways to see the penultimate season and began the last. I wanted to see what people who gave it a one-star rating had to say, because I was shocked it would receive such a low rating. It is a GREAT show. The one-star ratings I read were all technically related, most complaints being about the inability to understand all of what is being said and there is apparently no subtitle option. That deserves mentioning. In this day and age, everything available in terms of video use should allow a choice of subtitles. I can understand that frustration when I watch American TV with CC. Some things can just not be understood no matter how well you understand dialect.
The show is so well rounded. It deals with poverty in Northern England, on a public housing development known as Chatsworth Estates (I believe it is a fictional area of Manchester). It does so with a lot of humor, but also a deep humanity. Alcoholism is shown to not equal lack of intelligence, but represents the disease that befalls many who are not given the proper chances to succeed in life. Homosexuality is addressed in both humorous and sensitive ways. Organized crime is depicted often as a means by which the people of Chatsworth survive. It encompasses sensitivity and reality while remaining humorous. The cast is exceptional. Their interrelationships poignant (and out little Ygrytte from GoT gets some screen time as does The Hound!). I am trying and failing at expressing the depth of this show and how it deals with social issues and humanity on every level those things deserve. I hope that they fix the Subtitles problem by the time they are ready to sell the box set! I think I made my point. It's Art. :-)",1399248000,2,1772,4.70096463022508

I could only watch one episode on the cd and it kept freezing every couple seconds and my dvd player didn't have any issues. And the cd didn't play any of the other episodes on that one cd.
