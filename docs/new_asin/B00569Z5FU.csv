Is Anyone else selling this ????",1510099200,,89,4.294117647058823
8459378,5,B00569Z5FU,A wonderful work of anime. I wouldn't have expected anything less for a truly work of art especially for a manga book set,1399852800,,121,4.304347826086956
8459379,5,B00569Z5FU,"My favorite video, that I watch again and again.
 . . . We have Winter Storms, that knock out electricity to the whole state and
 . . . last for weeks at a time,
 . . . so it's fascinating to see, what life was like before Electricity,
 . . . TV, Radio, Cellphones, Appliances, etc.",1360972800,,282,3.982142857142857
8459380,4,B00569Z5FU,"Single discs have their own case, and both seasons have their own box, which is nice. I haven't gotten around to reading the Victorian-styled booklets that came with the set, but they definitely have lots of material in them (they are quite think, especially the one that came out of the season 1 box).

I only have two complaints. One, the packaging from Amazon could of been better. The product was placed in a sturdy cardboard box, but that's it... no paper or anything to keep it from sliding around in the shipping process and denting its self (the box they shipped it in to me was actually pretty big for what was inside). My second, more major, complaint is how the background to the subtitles would flash every so often. The show automatically plays in wide screen, so the subtitles are show in the empty space below the show. It was very distracting at first, but after a while I could ignore it. It didn't happen every single time someone talked... but sometimes it happened a lot (currently I've only watched the first season, so I don't know if there is flashing on the second season as well). But other than that I am very happy with my purchase.",1348185600,,1159,4.519047619047619
8459381,4,B00569Z5FU,Bought as a gift for my sister and a set for me.  She loved it.  I thought it was sweet.  It would have been nice if it was a little longer.,1341360000,,140,3.4516129032258065
8459382,4,B00569Z5FU,"Over all the show was great. The animation was fun to watch and the characters jumped right into your heart. I was a little sad that this show wasn't dubbed into English, while it has been dubbed into other languages, even though the story takes place in England. This bundle version comes with some booklets that further informs you about the characters as well as the time period the story is based. Even my mother borrowed the show to watch it after seeing my sister and I watching an episode.",1331424000,5,496,4.522222222222222
8459383,5,B00569Z5FU,"About a month before buying this I read the manga version. I instantly became an Emma fan, and decided to buy the anime version. While it's not exactly true to the source material, it's mostly the same and it's still a great work in it's own right. It will make you cry, cheer, and laugh no matter which version you use.

Both versions are well researched and written. Mori-sensei and everyone one the team for this adaptation really went the extra mile to deliver an accurate yet beautiful story of love that transcends social boundaries.",1329523200,5,539,4.673684210526316
