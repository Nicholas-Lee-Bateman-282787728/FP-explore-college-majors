8206534,1,B000SRP46A,There are some good photos but there is no sound commentary; instead it depends on a few printed identifications that are flashed on the screen too quickly to read. Much of the coverage is about officials awarding pilots after flights. Lindberg coverage after his flight is a major part of the film.,1249862400,,299,4.769230769230769
8206535,3,B000SRP46A,"The description for this item is completely WRONG.  Carranza was MEXICAN, not Spanish, there's (literally) an entire ocean of difference.  Not only Carranza was Mexican but also he was an officer of the Mexican Air Force.  I hope a serious historian could correct this big mistake in the product description.  Anyway, I will buy it and I just hope this is a description mistake, hoping this won't show up in the middle of the documentary...a description mistake as ridiculous as the fact that they call us Mexicans ""Hispanics"", since we are not from Spain...or ""Latinos"", since we are not Italians (the real Latinos).",1210291200,3,617,4.961165048543689
