The Troma edition I've bought here presents an awful copy of the film, not much better than my old VHS, with interviews as bonus features. The different stakeholders, I understand them very well, prefer to talk about Samuel Fuller than to try to convince us that SHARK! is of some interest.

5731182,1,B00CMY3JOQ,"Bad Bad Bad! This picture opened in theaters October 8 1969 Starring Burt Reynolds as Caine. Caine is overseas running guns for foreign countries. He's stop by three guys dressed as cops and they go through the cargo that he has on the back of his truck. After the first look, Caine starts to leave when the three men decide to look again.  While going deeper into the cargo the discover the guns that Caine is hauling. While running from the three men Caine looses his brakes and the truck goes over the side of the mountain. Now Caine not only has to find away into the nearest town he also needs to find another way to make money. Now a few thoughts on the movie itself. This was a bad bad picture to the point where I turned it off 15 minute into it. The movie has no leading lady in it and the well known star was Burt Reynolds. This was not only I a waste of Reynolds talent, this movie should've never been shown in public. I give this movie 1 weasel star only because there's no other number to use lower then 1.",1201478400,,1020,4.177664974619289

The sharpness and beautiful color make this film a must to own on blu-ray.  Starring Burt Reynolds. Barry Sullivan and Sylvia Pinal. This is a great Samuel Fuller classic.  Burt Reynolds is a down and out gun runner who is recruited by Barry Sullivan and his wife to help them recover gold from a sunken ship. Filmed in dangerous shark infested waters. A stunt man was killed in the making of this film.  Betrayal, and a love affair between Reynolds and the professors wife, make for a great story. Great music. You must get the blue ray version as the regular ones are of poor quality.",1376784000,5,715,4.6141732283464565
8583667,4,B00CMY3JOQ,"I happen to love this movie. I have a Troma release of this film on DVD (which is nice as Kaufman is an avowed Fuller enthusiast). However, the image was lacking, all smeared and pasty. Although it's true that Fuller wanted nothing to do with this after it came out, there are still some true Fuller flourishes, including some high angles and great action; kernels of typical Fuller greatness! I am looking forward to this blu-ray! To illustrate Fuller's disappointment with this film (one of many after 'Shock Corridor' and 'Naked Kiss'), here's some content from the Olive website:

""Sam Fuller is most likely spinning in his grave upon hearing the above headline! 'Why?' you ask? Unbeknownst to most, Shark! is one of the most controversial titles of Fuller's colorful career ... Let's just say there was a lot of drama surrounding the infamous Shark! (1969) (originally titled as Caine, then Shark! and finally Man Eater).

As the story goes, Sam Fuller was asked to create an original Sam Fuller Picture starring an unknown Burt Reynolds as Caine--a black market arms dealer caught up in Sudan. The film's production was cursed with tribulations from the get-go ...

First of many problems--the producers of Caine had a very different notion of what a Fuller Picture actually was! Throughout the making of the film, they kept insisting on creative control, constantly at odds with Sam over the direction of the film.

Problem number two--a shark killed a stuntman, on camera, during filming of the underwater scenes. The producers, without pause and to Fuller's disgust, begun to drum up publicity for the film by using the death to score at the box office, even renaming the film from Caine to Shark!

Problem number three-- as Sam went to work in the editing room, the producers edited their own version of the picture. When Fuller saw the results of their work, he blew his lid and (according to legend) had to be restrained by director Peter Bogdanovich from physically assaulting the men who ruined his project. At this point, Fuller has finally had enough! He unsuccessfully, filed a petition with the Director's guild to remove his name from the credits and wanted never to be associated with Shark!""

Then, of course, there's Fuller's autobiography, released posthumously, in which he wrote: ""I delivered my cut of 'Caine' on time to the producers, a good little adventure movie with reasonable commercial potential...A few months later, the producers invited me to a private screening room back in Los Angelos to see the finished picture...What a horrible shock I had! They'd completely recut the movie, retitling it 'Man-Eater,' refashioning almost every scene to suite ther tastes, which were lousy...Over and over, the producers had butchered scenes, destroying all trace of timing and subtlety. I was flabbergasted with their reediting...When the lights came up, I hit the ceiling...I never want to think about sharks again...""",1376524800,4,2945,5.049382716049383
8583668,3,B00CMY3JOQ,In my view you would probably need to be a Burt movie lover to really enjoy this film. I liked it.,1375401600,2,98,3.7142857142857144
8583669,1,B00CMY3JOQ,"Originally titled ""Caine"", this caper film made in Mexico was recut by Fuller's Mexican producers into this incomprehensible, unexciting bore that now survives. After delivering his cut, Fuller returned to Mexico for a screening a few months later to discover it had been re-titled ""Shark"" and re-cut into incomprehensibility. ""Turkey"" would have been a more accurate title. Burt Reynolds is good but he can't keep this boat afloat.",1374364800,2,432,5.367647058823529

8583672,3,B00CMY3JOQ,"A young man, scuba diving in the Red Sea off the coast of Sudan is killed by a shark.  Anna (Silvia Pinal) who with ""the Professor"" (Barry Sullivan) had been his employer is seen paying off his mother...now the two must find someone new to help them in their hazardous (and semi-secretive) operation, but none of the locals are interested, understandably.  But wait!  Here's Caine (Burt Reynolds), an American gun-runner who winds up in town tired, dirty and broke after losing his truck and weapons shipment after a chase at a border crossing - maybe he's just the sucker they need!.  Anna tries to seduce him, while Caine is trying everything to get passage out of this little town, and back to civilization.  He meets Doc (Arthur Kennedy) a drunken American ex-pat who may or may not be a real doctor, and Runt (Carlos Barry), a kid who tries to steal his watch but soon becomes a fast friend, and the two become his only real allies as he eventually falls in with Anna and the Professor's underhanded schemes, and eventually must face...SHARKS!

How and why the great, great Samuel Fuller ended up cowriting and directing this Mexican-produced low-budget piece - his first since his 1964 masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Naked-Kiss/dp/0780021088/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Naked Kiss</a>&nbsp;- I don't know.  The stories go that he had lots of problems with the film, and it was taken away and recut by the producers.  Certainly the end result isn't very satisfactory, and it's no wonder he wanted his name taken off it (though that never happened).  The whole thing is suffused with cheapness - most of the secondary cast is pretty bad, the marketplace that is a major set for a couple of scenes is laughably tiny, the underwater footage is all obvious stock material that doesn't mesh with the rest of the film, and the film is all, or nearly all, postdubbed.  The narrative has quite a few abrupt elisions; it's simple enough that I don't think anybody's going to have trouble following it, but certainly it makes the film choppy.  The odd music by Rafael Moroyoqui doesn't really evoke Africa where the film is set or Mexico where it was filmed.

But it's not a total loss.  Reynolds manages to rise a little above the material with charm and a sort of lazy animal sexual charisma; this was the fourth film he made that was released in 1969, very much his breakout year - and those who find his physical charms enticing will be glad to know that he's bare-chested through much of the film.  And Arthur Kennedy is excellent as the worn-out, cynical drunk Doc, and he seems somehow to fit into this low-rent ""Casablanca""-type setting, almost enough so that you can imagine him and Reynolds for a moment or two in an earlier, bigger-budgeted noir or exotic drama of the 40s, back when they could turn out this stuff every week, and do it a lot better than Fuller managed in 1969.  There are a couple of decent action scenes where the old, punchy Fuller style seems in evidence, and the dialogue isn't bad when it's more about the characters and not so much about driving the simple plot forward.

I have the old, crappy VHS - apparently the Troma DVD isn't any better; both are full-screen, though I'm not sure what the original aspect ratio was - probably not Cinemascope or anything.  I can't recommend this really to anybody but big fans of Fuller or Reynolds; I've seen most of the former's work and love it, and this is one of his weakest films.  I'm glad I have it, it's not without some small merit - but I wouldn't be missing much if my copy went swimming with the sharks.",1289779200,8,3648,4.781847133757962
8583673,5,B00CMY3JOQ,"This film was made when Burt was in the prime of his action films...has one of the best fight scenes I've seen (almost as good as his fight scene with Jack Warden in The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing)! It has a good story line and if your a fan of Burt Reynolds, you'll want this one along with Shamus, The Longest Yard (far superior to the remake), Deliverance (of course), Sharkey's Machine and the western The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing. Exciting Burt stuff here!",1264636800,5,461,4.372093023255814
