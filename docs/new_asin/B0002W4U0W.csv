2128157,4,B0002W4U0W,"The name of Sweeney Todd is, and will be, associated with Stephen Sondheim's great musical (and a Tim Burton film perhaps), but there once was another Todd, an underrated artist who played the role of this murderous barber like no one else could do. In fact, no actor can act like Todd Slaughter today, and even Sir Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal `Cannibal' Lector sitting at dinner table cannot beat Todd who gleefully hams it up, grinning like a true demon barber.

The basic premise of this British-made film (in 1936) is not much different from that of the Broadway musical. The barber `polishes up' his unsuspecting customers sitting in the ingeniously-made chair that drops the body into the basement. There Mrs. Lovatt awaits the poor victims who end up being meat pies made and sold by herself.

But of course this is not Sondheim. Though Sweeny Todd is romantically attracted to a young and beautiful girl Joanna, the film (directed by George King, who churned out numerous cheaply made thrillers during the 1930s and 40s) is nothing romantic. Except for the brief frame story at the beginning and ending, the film is a melodrama told in a purely Victorian fashion. If someone like Charles Dickens had directed a movie, it would have become something like ""Sweeny Todd"" with a terrified kid, the hero/heroine in disguise and comical moments before and after the suggested shocks. The story actually includes many plot devices you may find in Victorian novels, and even brief, unexciting scenes of the `natives' attacking the voyagers, most of which we rarely watch on screen today.

But the star of this real curio is Todd Slaughter, whose theatrical acting style is the exact opposite of the method actors'. His hammy performances as demon barber chuckling and cheerfully chattering about his `job' have a peculiarly attractive quality that only Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff could realize. Surely Todd Slaughter is Sweeny Todd, the Evil that is fun to watch, though uncomfortable to be with.",1171411200,,1999,4.979041916167665
2128158,4,B0002W4U0W,"Sweeney Todd (Tod Slaughter) and his accomplice Mrs. Lovatt have a strange business relationship. Todd brings the rich victims into his barbershop, where he throws the secret switch to his trick barber-chair, sending them into the basement for a throat-cutting and fleecing. Mrs. Lovatt then makes mince-meat out of the poor saps in her shop next door. Sort of an ancient forerunner to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, SWEENEY TODD is a perfectly gruesome little story. I especially like the new apprentice, Tobias, who goes next door for those tasty meat pies whenever his new master gets a new victim for his razor. Tobias is the eighth boy in eight weeks to fill the job. The other seven have all gone missing! It's a crime that this film has not gotten the notice it deserves. It's creepy, ghoulish, and humorous. Tod Slaughter is menacing, and no more silly in this than Bela is in DEVIL BAT for heaven's sake! Sheesh! Well worth owning...",1103760000,3,940,4.808641975308642

8033591,5,B0002W4U0W,"Todd Slaughter is perhaps one of Britain's most underrated actors. He is the blue print for the modern day villain and sadly he seldom gets the credit he is due for being so. This film in my humble opinion is Slaughter's best, along with murder in the red barn. He is mesmeric as Sweeney Todd and as much as he plays the villain, you cannot take your eyes off of his over the top flamboyant performance. The story is a London classic horror story and the the film and the  melodramatic horrors of today all owe a huge debt to Todd Slaughter who not only made Sweeney Todd his own, but became the DNA for villains across the board. Next time you watch a scooby doo cartoon villain or you watch  Dastardly and Muttley, you will see where the inspiration comes from, the one and only Todd Slaughter !!!! (How nobody has done a documentary or movie about his life is beyond me).",1485216000,,874,4.355828220858895
8033592,3,B0002W4U0W,"VERY entertaining oldie, poor print, lousy transfer.",1479254400,,52,6.571428571428571
8033593,5,B0002W4U0W,"This was Tod Slaughters second film role.  He plays Sweeney Todd with great relish.  As with a lot of his films, Slaughter plays a man with designs on a beautiful young woman (Eve Lister as Johanna).  Of course, she only has eyes for another man, a poor sailor of little means (Bruce Seton as Mark).  He takes off to win his fortune, leaving her in the evil clutches of Sweeney Todd, barber extraordinaire.  Sweeneys fortune comes from the customers he loves to polish off.  First he quizzes them, do they have friends or relatives, anyone whod miss them?  If no, then he pulls a lever and the chair flips over, dropping them on their head in the basement.  If they survive the fall, they most certainly don't survive his razor!  His partner next door (Stella Rho as Mrs. Lovatt) quickly bakes them in a pie.  All goes well until Mrs. Lovatt saves the sailor.  With an enemy who now knows the layout, will poor misunderstood Sweeney escape justice?

I love this early version of the classic tale, especially without the tunes.  The film quality though, is quite dreadful.  The images are scratchy and the sound is intermittent.  Even so, Slaughters performance shines through.  The man is a menace onto himself.  Every gesture, all the sly looks askance; what a wonderful ham he was, and not nearly as appreciated as he should have been.  Mores the pity.  I count myself lucky to have just a few of his films (I presume the rest were lost to time and disinterest).",1451520000,,1464,4.604651162790698
8033594,4,B0002W4U0W,"For 1936 that was a good English film? No embellishment, just the drama, the horror, the descent into hellish London when Fleet Street was really deserving its name when it was the disembarking entrance into London for all ships that still went up the Thames beyond Tower Bridge.

The Barber is Sweeney Todd and the pie-maker is Mrs. Lovatt. They are associates in crime to share the profits since it targets isolated travelers arriving on the ships mostly from the Indies, West or East, or even in-between Africa. The objective of their waiting for them and then on them is to rob them and make them disappear, though there is no real allusion to any cannibalism.

Johanna is the daughter of a shipmaster who sends a new ship at sea and has accepted to be associated to Sweeney Todd (12,000 pounds mind you). But the contract was probably not correct and the ship is announced as lost. Sweeney Todd will then bring the shipmaster down or if the latter wants to save his bones he can give the former his daughter in marriage. The father refuses.

It is then the arrival of the supposedly lost ship is announced and the captain is apparently Johannas lover. Be careful we are in the Victorian period. Lover only means that he expects to marry her one day, virginal and pure of course.

And thats when the plot sickens without thickening too much. Rivalry between the pie-maker and the barber, greed on both sides and mishaps on all sides leads to the happy ending we are expecting. The evil ones are punished by death and the good ones are rewarded with marriage and the loot of the evil ones. Isnt it moralistically pure?

It is classified as a horror film. It is in fact a rather bleak crime story from the 19th century sandwiched between an introduction and a conclusion in a barbers shop of the 1930s. The modern time customer suddenly doesnt fancy the razor..

8033600,2,B0002W4U0W,"Although some have tried to argue that he was an actual person, it seems likely that the story of a throat-cutting barber Sweeney Todd arose first as a bit of urban myth that was developed into an 1846 story titled THE STRING OF PEARLS by writer Thomas Prest. A year later the story was adapted to the stage as SWEENEY TODD, THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET. The story has remained popular into the 21st Century and is today best known as a musical by Stephen Sondheim.

The 1936 English film came about due to English laws which required film studios to produce a certain number of films for every film imported. George King was among the producer-directors who specialized in ""quota quickies"" and Tod Slaughter was his ""star.""  Born in 1885, Slaughter was never among the great actors of his day--but he was a stage favorite with provicial audiences, most especially when he played villians, and most especially when he played Sweeney Todd.

This particular version of the story differs a great deal from later versions, but the basic story remains the same.  Todd is a London barber who occasionally cuts a throat; Mrs. Lovatt (Stella Rho) is his partner in crime, who bakes the victims up into pies.  Now, make no mistake about it: this version of SWEENEY TODD is essentially one made by a pack of hacks, so you'll find no art here.  It really is a ""quota quickie,"" badly written, badly filmed, with a cast that goes from adequate to inept.  Even so, Slaughter and Rho are quite entertaining, playing so broadly and with melodramatic glee that offers a window onto the playing styles of a by-gone era.  The whole thing is so over-the-top, ultra-Victorian, English-gothic that it really can be quite a bit of fun if approached in the right spirit.

It would, however, be quite a bit more fun if the DVD prints available today were good quality.  They are not.  Indeed they are so poor that the film is barely watchable, and it goes without saying that there are no bonuses of any kind.  Recommended, but really only for those who are interested in tracing the history of Sweeney Tod in his various incarnations.
