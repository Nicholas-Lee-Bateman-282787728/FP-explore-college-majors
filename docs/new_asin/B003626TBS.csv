8389417,5,B003626TBS,"I have been liberated from the imperialism, thank you Eugene Hutz, thank you Margarita.
I loved the old footage, and insightful information without hammering my brain with didactic tactics. I could actually enjoy it and make my own free associations with the important issues such as Gypsy culture, immigration, and the music industry.
I feel free now! Well and a bit tired of jumping to the music!",1292457600,,398,4.955223880597015
