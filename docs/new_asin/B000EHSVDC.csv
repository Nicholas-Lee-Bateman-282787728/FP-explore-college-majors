2520474,5,B000EHSVDC,"I have all of the DVDs of King of the Hill and watch them frequently. (I can't wait to get the entire series...) The show has its finger on the pulse of America and the situations portrayed in King of the Hill are humorous because they are so close to real that almost anyone can relate. The DVD collections are getting better, although in the rush to get them out so quickly (average 2 per year,) I think the producers are overlooking a great deal of potential in additional features. Isn't that what buying the DVD collections is all about any more?",1151452800,6,551,4.411764705882353
2520475,5,B000EHSVDC,"Hi. Someone else asked why this show is still on the air. The reason is some people see Hank as just a redneck and laugh at him. Other people, for example people who dislike mega stores and their bad service or the touchy feely vibe that came out of the 60's and 70's can empathize with Hank. Please direct any other questions to denys55@hotmail.com Great show, another great season.",1148428800,5,383,4.565217391304348
2520476,5,B000EHSVDC,"I used hate King of the Hill (or at least thought I did). I avoided watching it because I thought it was a show about some ""hicks.""  Anyway, this is the season that turned me around. Now I have all the DVD's and love every single episode.  Great characters and storylines. Unique and funny. I LOVE King of the Hill!",1147132800,13,315,4.233333333333333
2520477,1,B000EHSVDC,"I am not a snotty reviewer who just likes giving 1 star reviews. I was hoping maybe someone could explain to me why this show is funny. I have watched several episodes (mostly because it comes on after Malcolm in the Middle, which i deem to be a far superior show even if its losing steam after 7 seasons) and maybe cracked a smile through a few of them, but i have never, to my recollection ever laughed. I am not too picky with what i watch (except for reality tv which i think is the worst thing to hit america since 9/11) and like many different kinds of shows ex: Frasier, Seinfeld, Simpsons, Family Guy, Malcolm in the Middle, Lost, 24, Prison Break,and that 70's show. But in my humble opinion in order for a show to go on you have to stop trying to be so damn smart (unless your the brilliant Arrested Development, which was unfortunately canceled:() and start trying to be funny. And also the show has way to many touching moments. The simpsons had them but didn't use them too much, and they only work once in a while because no one really cares if a cartoon dad loves his son no matter what, its a frikkin tv show. Anyways, if someone could please politely explain what is so funny about this show, i would appreciate it.

ps. I have looked over all 6 seasons out on dvd and from the amount of reviews i have seen no one else really gives a [...] about the show. I wonder how its still on the air?",1147046400,2,1408,4.214814814814815

2520480,5,B000EHSVDC,"Season 6 of King of the Hill is one of the best season ever. However season 6 is when the show started to reach it's peak. One of the reasons why the show peak is because of the fact that the season got moved back due to 9/11 as well as the fact that this season is when KOTH started syndication. But this season proved that this show has alot of potential. Here are the episodes.

1.) Bobby Goes Nuts 11/11/2001

The episode opens innocently enough with Bobby's girlfriend Connie inviting him over to add some spark to her dying slumber party. But after Bobby's beaten up by a crasher, Hank urges him to enroll in a boxing class at the Y. That class is full, so Bobby enrolls in the next best thing: women's self-defense. There, he quickly masters the technique of targeting an attacker below the belt (while yelling ""That's my purse!""). Armed with this training, Bobby makes sure that his next encounter with that crasher has a different outcome. And Hank couldn't be more proud---until he learns the secret of Bobby's success.

2.) Soldier of Misfortune 12/9/2001

Dale is running for re-election as Gun Club president, but his chances seem to be shot when he accidentally discharges his gun.

But Dale bungles the job, and nearly gets his friends killed by his opponent at the Gun Club.

4.) The Father, the Son and J.C. 12/16/2001

When Buck Strickland has to build a house for Habitat for Humanity as part of his community service, Hank does all the work. Buck is so pleased that he promotes Hank to manager, but when Hank tells Buck ""I love you,"" he is demoted back to assistant manager. Cotton becomes jealous that Hank likes Buck better, and Peggy, determined to celebrate Christmas by repairing Hank's relationship with his father, tries to get Hank to tell his father that he loves him. But when the plan backfires, this Christmas problem can only be solved by a carpenter with the initials J.C.: Jimmy Carter.

Kahn tries to bribe Bobby to break up with Connie. Connie and Bobby decide to pretend to break up so they can get the money.

10.) The Substitute Spanish Prisoner 3/3/2002

Peggy takes an online I.Q. test sponsored by the ""Intelligence Institute of Texas,"" and is declared a genius. When the head of the Institute, Dr. Vayzosa, offers her a chance to get a PhD for only $900, she uses the family savings to pay for it. When Luanne takes the online I.Q. test and also scores as a genius, Peggy realizes that she has been conned, and she comes up with an elaborate sting to get the money back.

Cotton admits to Hank that the ""widow"" was never married, and the ""action"" did not occur in battle. Meanwhile, back home, Dale and Bill prove themselves dedicated house sitters by dressing up as Hank and Peggy; and Luanne finds a replacement dog when she thinks she has killed Ladybird.

2520527,5,B000EHSVDC,"I think we can all agree that like most animated shows, King of the Hill took a few seasons to find it's audience, develop it's characters and truly hit it's stride. Season Six is in the midst of that stride. With classic moments such as Bobby taking a Women's Self-Defense class at the local Y (because all of the other self-defense classes were full) where he learned to scream ""THAT'S MAH PURSE! I DON'T KNOW YOU!"" just before kicking his assailant(s) in the testicles to the brilliantly written Hankisms such as ""Well I am the Best Man at this wedding so I'll do it; I'll talk to Dale's dad. *sigh* With the joy of responsibility comes the burden of obligation."" We learn that Nancy calls everyone including God, ""Shuug(s)"" (short for ""Sugar"") and that Brittany Murphy really did a brilliant job in creating a character out of Luanne that truly demonstrated her talent as a voice-over actor.",1486598400,,895,4.707006369426751

2520578,1,B000EHSVDC,"To save production costs, Fox made these discs as single layer flippers.  There is a DVD on each side.  Flippers are notorious for being extremely poor quality technology.  They damage far easier and often times they leave the factory unplayable, even before they get scratched during shipping.  On the copy I received, Disc 1 Side 2 had 2 large scratches on it that rendered the disc partially unplayable.  The discs were damaged during shipping because there is not a label side to protect them from being jostled around.

This is a shame.  King Of The Hill is a good show and Season 6 contains one of my favorite episodes, Bobby Goes Nuts.  However, Fox must be faulted for doing this DVD set on the cheap and should be punished for it.  Punished by not roping in anyone else into buying this inferior release.",1465257600,,813,4.629370629370629

I ordered seasons 2-6 and every one was in a single plastic case with this plastic wing in the middle holding two dvds. EVERY case was damaged in some manner and almost every dvd throughout all of the seasons had experienced some kind of scratching. Some of it was due to the spindle holding the dvd being broke allowing the dvd to just rattle around, some had the plastic wing just rattling around with the two dvds on it just rubbing back and forth, and others were just rubbing each other to the HORRIBLE case design. I am currently trying to get a refund or exchange for the sets that have each dvd individually cased. I suggest you do the same if you order these sets.

Great show, horrible case design.",1382832000,,964,4.379888268156424

2520721,5,B000EHSVDC,"For whatever reason, I didn't watch KofTH when it aired on Fox for so many seasons.  Now its my favorite show, and Season 6 is my most favorite. The last two episodes about the trip to Japan are hilarious, but they also teach a lesson about tolerance.  The episode about the Renaissance Fair is pure satire.  The animation on all of the episodes, specifically Peggy Hill, is ingenious the way Peggy's facial expressions consistently reflect her feelings at the time. The humor, for the most part, is in good taste considering the topics that are highlighted; e.g., Bobby working as an apprentice animal feces remover.  I probably wouldn't recommend the show for young children, as it could teach them some bad habits (but then, so can Sponge Bob).  My only problem is that now that I'm a fan of the show, it is no longer included in Amazon Prime, with no cost unlimited streaming. Yet, the decision to start charging for the show is likely due to contractual/cost issues, since Net Flix has removed the show completely.",1380758400,2,1019,4.734463276836158

I purchased season six the day it came out and eagerly opened it and found a notecard inside telling me to expect season seven sometime in fall of '06.  I waited, and waited, and waited, no season 7.  So really my one star review is for Fox.  I understand that KOH may not be the most popular or best selling series around, but what about the fans who only have half a collection because Fox values large sales over the fans who actually do the purchasing.  After seeing some of the junk available to purchase in stores and online, it really disgusts me that I only have six seasons of KOH to watch.  Punky Brewster, Third Rock from the Sun, Alf, great series?  No, but they are available for  purchase in their entirety.  FOX RELEASE THE REST OF THE SEASONS!!!!

2520822,5,B000EHSVDC,"Not a lot of mystery here - if you are looking at buying this - then you have probably seen it on TV!  If you like it on TV, you will like it even more on DVD - no commercials.

I just dig this show.  Some episodes, in my opinion, are suitable for showimg at church - as a sermon.  I think you could actually sing some praise songs, show an episode (I am talking about certain ones now, not just any of them), and say a closing prayer.

A couple of this nature come to mind -

1, When Hank goes to anger management and meets a guy who tells him anger is fine, look at God, he got angry and killed all sorts of people in the Old Testament.  Then, when getting angry later on, the guy drops dead of a stress heart attack of some sort.  There are some great teaching points in that episode - and it is funny!!

2, When Bobby starts hanging out with the Christian Heavy Metal band and Hank doesnt approve.  There is a great scene when Hank and the dad of the Rocker dude come face to face.  Though he has all sorts of tattoos and looks like a rough guy, they get along.  The guy shows his kid his tattoo of the 10 commandments on his back and reminds him that children should respect their parents, and that if Hank doesnt want Bobby worshiping the same way, that is okay.  Hank says something to the effect of, ""I didn't think we would get along"".  But they did.  This is the Body of Christ.  Some wear suits to church, others wear flip flops and baseball caps.

So, yeah, the ""Church of the Hills.""

God Bless

2520833,5,B000EHSVDC,"Fans of the Hill's will need no convincing to buy this fantastic season that ups the ante on every level. If it weren't for the cultural juggernaut that is 'The Simpsons' this relatively quiet achieving show could well be judged best animated show of all time. It's easy to see why: Beautifully developed characters who are both painfully real and hilariously funny. Great scripts packed with empathy, wit and often riotous fine character detail, all coupled with top shelf voice talent. Every character is expertly tuned to have their time to shine, and in the case of such extremes as Hank's 24 carat abomination of a father Cotton, or his ever more paranoid neighbour Dale Gribble, the levels of creative delirium and outright savage lunacy have never been funnier. Hank's ongoing relationship to his loony Dad provides humour that's close to the bone and damn funny, as is his hilarious relationship with his blustering boss Buck Strickland.

But it's the incredible warmth of the folks in Arlen Texas that makes 'King of the Hill' so darned good. Hank and Peggy are all too human in their struggles, insecurities and victories and son Bobby is often as poignant as he is funny.

2520837,5,B000EHSVDC,"King of the Hill is a consistently funny cartoon/sitcom. Whilst not as laugh out loud as the Simpsons, like that programme it portrays a loving family made up of disparate characters with a resulting  comic tension.  The programme doesn't patroniseits charactersand as with real life gives them varied personalities. Hank is a working man with ""simple"" tastes but is not a redneck and his willingness to give others a fair hearing (usually after some soul searching!) puts plenty of liberals to shame,Peggy is occasionally as smart as she thinks she is and even Dale, a paranoid fantasist, is redeemed by his devotion to his family. Season 6 is amongst the best of the series delivering a new brother for Hank, an indication of a better relationship with his father and a bluegrass career for Konnie...",1176076800,2,802,4.933333333333334

2520839,4,B000EHSVDC,"why are there no special features at all? theres like a puzzle on the 3rd disk case and thats it! its a great show and probably one of its best seasons, but come on. no commentary? no anamatics? no making of? nothing! after the third season dvd they just gave up on special features. wwwhhhhyyyyy!?!?!

i would say more about this season but the episode list speaks for its self, its fan-friggin-tastic",1165881600,,402,4.583333333333333
2520840,5,B000EHSVDC,"Bobby goes nuts, Hank has two brothers now, Bill is a human guinea pig, and of course Boomhauer and his dang old this and dang old that all continue the laughs in this season six DVD set.

Many have said that season is six is when King of the Hill hit its high point of the series, with the following seasons at somewhat of a decline in quality.  While I agree that this is possibly one of the best seasons I do not think the series has lost any of its charm.  We all know the episode list from other reviews, but this season does an exceptional job in giving each character more individual story lines.  Extras are lacking, but for those who just like to have the episodes this is a solid five star outing.

So everyone watch out as the fat, drunk, hairy Army guinea pig comes through in season six.",1159228800,9,800,4.2026143790849675
2520841,5,B000EHSVDC,"""King of the Hill,"" quite simply, is one of the most intelligent shows on television.  It doesn't try to cram in slapstick comedy, or slip in jokes every 10 seconds, but it does a wonderful job of giving you character-centered plots that are extremely satisfying (and often hilarious) to watch. By about the third season of this series, the characters' individual personalities had been developed to the fullest and from that point onward, the show simply took off.  This season is the best yet.  If you've never seen the show, this is a great season to start off with.",1154995200,15,569,4.7272727272727275
2520842,5,B000EHSVDC,"Okay, if you don't like King of the Hill, then don't watch the show. I commend the producers creating a TV character that has forgotton how to be a man in today's world of political correctness. Hank Hill offers a moral center to the show in a time when most tv characters have virtually forgotton the definition of morality. Hank Hill reminds men to be men and to not be ashamed of it.  If women can be women, why can't men be men? Hank is more than just a pick up driving beer drinking man from Texas. He's simply a good man, period. What do you have against good ole boys anyway? There are good ones and bad ones just like there are with any groups of people. I'm a good ole boy, drink beer, drive a pickup and proud to be an American and not ashamed of it.  The only difference between me and Hank is I live in Georgia, but I do want the Yellow Rose of Texas to be sung at my funeral.

8110146,4,B000EHSVDC,"It's KOTH in it's prime. That said, the DVD set was a bit disappointing for me; not in terms of the shows, but just because it has none of the special extras that some previous seasons had. No audio commentaries from the characters, no deleted scenes or animations, etc. So if you just want to have access to the season, it's here- but if you were looking for extras you can't find elsewhere, you might be missing them.",1525737600,,419,4.384615384615385
