5468065,5,B00AQ590IC,It reminds me of when i was younger and couldn't wait for the next episode. Of course it's only one season and you never get to see them get their father back but it was still a great show.,1363219200,,189,3.871794871794872
5468066,5,B00AQ590IC,"I remember watching these as a kid. I love older retro toons so i had to add this to my collection. It holds up very well and has some good action and comedy. It will definitely take you back some years seeing some things like retro fashions, slang, colors/artwork. Just all around good fun.

Its a great set and i actually kind of like the packaging toy box uses. The cds are inside individual sleeves that are securely held in place inside the case. I hate getting a dvd case and hearing a loose dvd inside. A loose dvd inside means damage or scratches and i haven't had that problem with toy box dvd sets.",1362787200,,608,4.28695652173913
5468067,5,B00AQ590IC,This cartoon was very popular in the mid 90's human turned into sharks to save the world and it's jawawasome!,1362700800,,109,4.5
5468068,4,B00AQ590IC,"Animation series conquered the television screens during the 1980s until the mid 1990s. Growing up during that time period, I watched dozens of cartoon series, but by the mid 1990s I was out of my cartoon stage and became interested in other stuff. Now as an adult, I have taken an interest in revisiting the cartoons that I grew up with and others that I never got a chance to watch. One those series was Street Sharks that aired from 1994-1996. The complete series has recently been released to DVD for the first time from Mill Creek Entertainment, who sent me a complementary copy in exchange for my honest review.

Street Sharks was based on the Mattel toy-line of the same name. The main plot involved Dr. Paradigm experimenting on gene-manipulation. His assistant, Dr. Robert Bolton, tried to destroy his research, but ended up being mutated before escaping the lab. Bolton's sons, John, Bobby, Coop, and Clint, investigated his disappearance, but were kidnapped by Dr. Paradigm, who turned them into sharks.

The rest of the series focused on the brothers', now known as Ripster, Jab, Streex, and Big Slammu, attempts at capturing Dr. Paradigm, so he could return them back to their human form. Each episode has Dr. Paradigm turning people into mutants and the brothers must stop them.

The 40 episodes on the two disc set are:

Disc One: Sharkbait (Mini-Series Part 1), Shartsbite (Mini-Series) Part 2) Sharkstorm (Mini-Series Part 3), Shark Quest, Lone Shark, Shark N' Roll, Fresh Water Sharks, Shark Treatment, Road Shark, Shark Fight

Bonus Episode: C.O.P.S. The Case of the Boy Who Cried Sea Monster

Disc Two: Sky Sharks, Sharks of Steel, Shark Source, Jurassic Shark, Sir Shark-A-Lot, Shark to the Future, First Shark, Rebel Sharks, Space Sharks, A Shark Among US

Disc Three: To Shark or Not, Eco Shark, Close Encounters of the Shark Kind, Satellite Sharks, Cave Sharks, Shark Wars, Sharkfather, Shark Hunt, Card Sharks, Shark-Jacked

Disc Four: Turbo Shark, 20,000 Sharks Under the Sea, Ancient Sharkonauts, Sharkotic Reaction, Sand Sharks, Shark Quake, Super Shark, Jungle Shark,Trojan Sharks, Shark-Apolypose Now!

I never watched Street Sharks during its original run, but I do remember it being advertised along with the toys. The main plot of four mutant brothers reminds me a lot of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. There is plenty of action every episode, but the plots are silly and outrageous. The series was short-lived and Im glad that Mill Creek Entertainment is bringing these almost forgotten cartoons to DVD for a new generation. Just like similar releases, each disc is in a paper sleeve. Overall, I enjoyed watching each shark attack episode and I recommend it to other cartoon fans.",1361664000,5,2717,5.046875
5468069,4,B00AQ590IC,"Street Sharks The Complete Series
The radically jawesome 90's cartoon finally makes it to DVD in one complete set.  The show is filled with action and cheesy shark related one liners such as ""let's chomp on out of here!"" and the most notable being ""jawesome!""  The show itself is similar to the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon except that the Sharks hate pizza(but will eat most anything else!)

Overview:
This set is offered at an incredibly low price but only at the cost of cutting some corners.  The video quality, packaging and bonus features are nothing special but the important thing is every episode is here and the show is actually better then I remembered.

Packaging:
Unfortunately the packaging is lacking, as with many DVD's produced by Mill Creek, the case does not have hubs where the discs can click into and instead are inserted into paper sleeves.

-Standard size black DVD case(Not an eco-case)
-Paper sleeves to hold the discs
-All four discs feature the same art work on top
-Episode listings on each disc

Bonus Features:
There is only one bonus feature on this set which is an episode of the 1988 cartoon C.O.P.S.(The Case of the Boy Who Cried Sea Monster)

Episodes:
All 40 episodes are spread across four DVD's with ten episodes on each disc.
As far as I can tell the episodes are presented in order.
The episodes on this set are as follows

Disc One
1.  Sharkbait
2.  Sharkbite
3.  Sharkstorm
4.  Shark Quest
5.  Lone Shark
6.  Shark N Roll
7.  Fresh Water Sharks
8.  Shark Treatment
9.  Road Shark
10. Shark Fight

Disc Two
11. Sky Sharks
12. Shark of Steel
13. Shark Source
14. Jurassic Shark
15. Sir Shark A Lot
16. Shark to the Future
17. First Shark
18. Rebel Sharks
19. Space Sharks
20. A Shark Among Us

Disc Three
21. To Shark or not To Shark
22. Eco Sharks
23. Close Encounters of the Shark Kind

5468070,4,B00AQ590IC,"I've only watched the first three episodes but man it took me back.  Those episodes looked fine, sounded fine, it's all good.  Cheesy and nostalgic maybe, but who cares it was one of those fun shows of the 90's that you wouldn't see nowadays because of picky viewers and even pickier TV stations.  The biggest drawback is the packaging.  I was totally surprised to open it and find the four discs waiting in paper sleeves.  I mean I get not wanting to do maybe a middle dvd holder thing or whatever...but paper sleeves?  Sure it's $10 for 40 episodes but I mean I bought a copy of Moribito the complete series and all eight discs were stacked on top of each other on one tall peg.  Not the greatest, but debatable that it's better than a stack of paper sleeved discs.

Though really, it isn't the most horrible thing, just surprising and new though I hear from others this is how Mill Creek releases their dvds.  But for $10 it's still such a sweet deal if you were ever a fan of the show definitely buy it.  Share it with your kids if you have any, or just enjoy it yourself!",1361577600,,1076,4.308457711442786
5468071,4,B00AQ590IC,"It's as silly and ridiculous as I had hoped.  I knew nostalgia alone wouldn't be enough for me to enjoy this series as much as I did when I was younger, but $9.99 for a piece of my childhood, let alone 40 episodes, is an amazing steal.  The only negative about this release is the poor DVD packaging.  It's in a DVD case as shown, however each individual disc is in it's own sleeve inside.  There is just a square inside with four discs inside four sleeves, one on top of the other, in the center of that square.  First time I've ever seen a DVD case like this.  Buy this if you used to be a fan, but you may want to lower your expectations a little.  Also buy this if you've got a child who you want to experience some heroic sharks in some great action scenes with a ton of the usual childish cartoon humor.  It's entertaining to say the least and well worth the price.",1361232000,6,871,4.112426035502959
5468072,5,B00AQ590IC,"About time these came to DVD, pre-ordered as soon as the option became available.
Will update review when it arrives.

JAWSOME!!!

Update 26/02/2013

Finally arrived, however the poorly thought out paper sleeves for DVDs scratched them... Yeah all my discs have scratches which sucks.

So yeah... Sucks but that's life for ya. Amazon are great though, sending me out a new one.

They contacted the correct people about DVDs packing so hopefully this won't happen for anyone else.

Update 28/02/2013

It's nice that MilCreek can continue pushing out these titles, I've bought almost everything they've done, except a few here and there. The video quality is a lot better compared to some of the other (older) MilCreek releases, the audio is ""Slamming"" as well. Pun intended.

I was expecting the quality to just be terrible, due to other 80s/90s shows I order usually are, but the quality is actually pretty good.  His TV is around 42 inches and it still looks good!  The sound quality is great.  My only complaint is the packaging.  It is just one DVD case with only one ""nub"" that all the DVDs are piled on.  Makes it easy to scratch them, and since they are stacked it is hard to get to the disc you want.  Besides that I am happy with this set.",1473897600,4,543,3.8035714285714284

It would have been 3 stars if I had paid more than I did, but for the $6 price tag I can let anything slide. My mom was actually a bigger fan of this show than me when I was a kid. She was super excited when I sent her a picture of this, I might grab another one. There's just something special about 90's animation that you can identify immediately. It's really nice having shows from my youth that I can't see elsewhere available to me at any time. I just wish I could mix them into other DVD's and have myself a custom TV channel...maybe a DVD player that holds multiple discs? Get this and have a jawsome day!",1468281600,,683,4.104477611940299

Fast forward to today, now with all 40 episodes on DVD, I am catching up to what I had missed. In more ways than one, I have my weekend cartoons back and from this point on my Saturday mornings of just sitting around and eating cereal are back!! Anyway, the animation is great!! Honestly, they should bring them back and make a new show and if whoever owns the rights to the Street Shaks is reading this, then please, bring them back!!!

5468359,3,B00AQ590IC,"Arrived at my door in perfect condition. That's great!
However, before purchasing this DVD set, I watched episode 1 on YouTube first which kind of inspired me if you will, to buy this complete series.
I was thinking, man purchasing this with the quality of a DVD set should be much better than watching it for free on YouTube. As much as I loved this show as a child and show interest in it even now that I'm older, the quality wasn't any different than it was on YouTube at 240p and so it's made the viewing experience less appealing. The desire to watch it just isn't as strong since it's really quite pixelated, even though it's brand new, on DVD's and all. Was expecting the video quality to be much better than YouTube quality at the very least, but it wasn't. I don't exaggerate when I say it was just the same as YT. It's not much though at only 8 bucks and I still hold the interest and fond memories of this show. I haven't watched even the 3rd episode just yet though, as the very poor video quality just leaves so much to be desired! If you want go ahead and buy it to fill your memory void or whatever aha but really YouTube has it in just the same 240p quality so I'd recommend watching it for free on YT instead.

5468392,3,B00AQ590IC,"Nostalgia, again, is the only thing recommending this series to the consumer. The production values are unilaterally abysmal, and the premise is obviously derivative of a certain martial reptilian foursome. What this set DOES offer is quantity over quality, and when you're doing other things around the house or have friends over for the evening, it will suffice as droll video wallpaper.",1407542400,,389,5.290322580645161

5468395,3,B00AQ590IC,Its great that street sharks was finally released on dvd. The downside is that Millcreek released it.  Like many other reviewers have mention each dvd comes in paper sleeves. so chances are they well have scraches as soon a you open it. If you do manage to get a set that is scratch free I suggest you go buy a lotto ticket cause it might be your lucky day. The other bad thing is that sometimes the dvds works well in one dvd player but not in another. If you have problems with a disc try it in another dvd player since millcreek has terrible quality assurance. I didn't get my set from amazon so I cant exchange it but even if I could I bet I would be getting the same problem. If you want to keep your dvds from getting scraches from the sleeves I suggest that you look at amazon or ebay for multi disc cases and switch the disks and artwork to them. You might want to buy more then one since millcreek is sadly the only company pumping out old classic out of print or never been release obscure cartoons and tv series.,1404864000,7,1023,4.166666666666667

5468412,4,B00AQ590IC,One thing I must caution buyers is that the DVD comes with them stacked on top so you have to be careful when using them. A fantastic series albeit with a few animation glitches and plot holes but generally all you have to is ignore them. If your were a nineties kid like me this series should give you a perfect case of nostalgia. And parents of today this will be a great series for your children.,1401408000,,399,4.194805194805195

5468415,3,B00AQ590IC,"Other than about the last half of disk 3 (Which is where the show started to get horrible) and all of disk 4 (Where NONE of the episodes were even OK, all were horrid), this was a pretty good show. I would only recommend this if you grew up on it, the first 2 disks and some of the 3rd disk were fun. Sometimes the animation is rubbery, sometimes the voices didn't match, especially with the sharks, most the episodes (Like He-Man or Thundercats) had the same villain and similar or the same plot and just felt like the same thing over and over. The show had little human involvement and treated humans (regular civilians and villains) as stupid, bad, irrelevant, etc. The sharks never know why the humans don't like or trust them a lot and I think if they stopped causing more damage in almost every single episode to their city then that may help their image a bit. Some episodes had these like music montages towards the end of them and this was a really lame and bad idea I felt, it would ruin some good episodes. The main villain was kinda cool, but some of the mutants he creates are really cool, be it hero or villain.

5468503,5,B00AQ590IC,"I bought this series for nostalgia purposes, mostly for the end episodes featuring the Dinovengers (AKA Extreme Dinosaurs). I ended up thoroughly enjoying the entire series. It is a cartoon made for the sake of entertainment. It's not a memorable cartoon, or a deep cartoon, but overall it is a lot of fun. It's campy in a good way, despite being a little dated. It obviously a 90's cartoon which adds to its charm.

I've watched some of the episodes on Netflix, which were blurry and gritty (sound was a bit off). The latter episodes featuring the Dinovengers were left out, too. The DVD has a much, much better quality than Netflix.

Only gripe: the sounds is a bit off in a few episodes. This is very noticeable in disc 3, with sound getting either very quiet, or very loud. Given the price and overall quality, I can't complain.

All I can say, I really, really hope Extreme Dinosaurs comes out on DVD as well.",1373414400,,914,4.527272727272727
5468504,5,B00AQ590IC,I use to watch this show growing up. It reminded me of the show 'Biker Mice From Mars.' Very action packed and humorous at times. I am so glad the whole series is available for this cheap!,1372377600,,188,4.108108108108108

5468509,5,B00AQ590IC,"I watched Street Sharks with my son as a toddler...he's an adult now and still loves them! He was so happy when this DVD came out that he bought 2 of them right away...an extra one, ya know...just in case!! High quality DVD in a great case.  All episodes included on 4 disks.  A LOT OF FUN!!!",1368057600,3,292,4.105263157894737
5468510,5,B00AQ590IC,"The 80s and 90s were a time when cartoon action shows featured animal-warrior superheroes, and the Street Sharks are the most ""Jawsome"" of them all.  While the series maybe ""corny,"" as some adult viewers might say, it's a good comedy, all-action packed type of corny that most cartoons from the 1990s were known for.  The Street Sharks not only exemplify heroism but also family values.  The four super hero sharks (Ripster the Great White, Streex the Tiger Shark, Slammu the Whale Shark and Jab the Hammerhead) are brothers who work together to save the citizen of Fission City, thwart the evil schemes of the diabolical Doctor Paradigm and look for their beloved father, who remains secretly close by and helping his four sons in their quests.  They also form allegiances with other victims of Dr. Paradigm's mutation formulas, and even gain the friendship of humans who see the Sharks for who they are on the inside.

I placed an order for this DVD complete series and received it three days later.  I was impressed with the fast delivery, but even more so with the amazing quality preserved in all 40 episodes. The whole collection is 10 episodes of the show each placed chronologically on four separate DVDs, which are all packaged neatly in individual sleeves into one DVD case.  The case is presented with a simple and fantastic looking cover, and the entire collection is priced at just $10, which is an excellent bargain for a four-disc DVD set.

All in all, it was well worth the money spent to add this collection of animated memorabilia to my home video library.",1367798400,14,1574,4.782287822878229
5468520,5,B00AQ590IC,"I can't believe Street Sharks is on DVD. I totally forgot about this show. I actually don't even know if I ever saw this back in the day, all I remember is I had the blue shark toy. This show is pretty amazing. Interesting plot with some great action sequences. I really can't believe you get all the episodes in one set for dirt cheap. I would recommend this to any old school animation fans or those that rember Street Sharks. It's an old school good time.",1367625600,,458,4.275862068965517

5468523,4,B00AQ590IC,"Towards the end of the original Ninja Turtles series alot of spin-offs were happening, Street Sharks was one of my favorites.  It has all the classic trademarks of a 90's cartoon: copious catchphrase usage, lots of crazy technology (great for merchandising!), brain-damaged badguys, and most importantly, attitude.  Before Cookie Jar released Street Sharks on DVD this show was lost to time, so props for the release.  I am starting to get tired of these cheap paper sleeves though, and that's why I rated it 4-star.

At such a low price, it only makes sense to add this to your collection if you were ever a fan.",1365120000,,613,4.754716981132075
