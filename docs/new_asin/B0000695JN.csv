1730463,4,B0000695JN,"It is a good general overview of the wives of Henry XIII, but I feel like there were some strong biases for and against various Queens, both in the time spent on them, and the type of information provided.  David Starkey is a good narrator, carrying the story along in a way that keeps you watching.  Some of the drama-ization was a bit much, especially as they used scenes they had filmed for one scene in a later scene.",1506816000,,421,4.3164556962025316
1730464,5,B0000695JN,"I watched this with Prime. Very well made. Lots of on-site commentary/narration. Well acted and informative and stays away form the speculations, rumors, and sensationalism that are present in a lot of documentaries. The only thing I could knock is that the fake beards are REALLY fake looking. Don't let that stop you, though.",1505433600,2,327,5.074074074074074
1730465,5,B0000695JN,"This is a no-frills look at the wives of King Henry VIII. And of the empty life the King himself.

In a struggle for dynastic preservation and recognition, the King was continually at the head of a rebellion against the mores of the time and this led, intentionally or not, to a decline in the value of his royal wives through plots and schemes that look insulting and petty in present time. The king, his families, and his country went through great religious and political turmoil taking the survival of each to dangerous, disastrous limits. His wives suffered a staggering number of miscarried royal babies in a string of attempts to provide an approved male heir. It did not seem to occur to the King that the problem might be his own royal self.

This was a roller-coaster adventure. I recommend watching.",1502928000,5,810,4.697183098591549
1730466,3,B0000695JN,"This is a wonderful looking documentary but outdated with inaccurate information. Katherine Howard was only 10 years old when a man began coming to the dorm room she slept in. The host says she finally agreed to sleep with him. A grown man and a child is called rape! He calls her, at the time of her beheading, a flighty woman. She was just a young teenager married off by her uncle to a king in his 50s with open ulcers on his legs. She was treated dreadfully. And the so called 'ugly queen' is not thought to have been unattractive at all. Henry was sickly, couldn't do his part in bed anymore so blamed it on the women and girls he married. The days of treating these six queens without respect is over. Watch Lucy Worsley's excellent documentary on the six wife's. It shows life from their sad point of view.",1502841600,18,813,4.355263157894737
1730467,5,B0000695JN,"If you like cute bearded gingers in Ren Faire outfits you really can't beat this series. Ok ok, there was actually great historical storytelling and it was honestly better than I expected considering it's free...but you def might get distracted by the cute ginger king as he alternates between Happy In Love Face and Bored With This Wife Now Face. Worth a watch, though.",1502668800,,370,4.796875

1730470,4,B0000695JN,"Very enjoyable docu-series. The re-eneactments are well done, well produced and the information is well told. Basically it's a nice live action Cliff's Notes version of Henry VIII and his not so lucky wives. Totally worth watching if you enjoy history,",1501891200,8,252,5.170731707317073

7965161,4,B0000695JN,"When Henry VIII ascended the throne in the 16th century, Christopher Check tells us that the Catholic ""faith was vigorous in merry old England. Whereas heresies had brought war to France and Bohemia, and clerical scandals had plagued the whole continent, Henry inherited a country with a thriving Catholicism. The English nobility supported hundreds of monasteries that looked after the corporal needs of the poor and the spiritual needs of all English souls....All this, Henry would destroy"" (The Great Divorce: The Evil Fruits of Henry VIII's Adultery, April 2007).

While reported to be a seasoned adulterer, Henry had remained in communion with the Church.  Yet in the midst of his affair with Anne Boleyn, Henry decided that his marriage to Catherine of Aragon could not be valid.  After the Vatican did NOT grant Henry an annulment, Henry decided that he himself was the ""Supreme Head"" of the Church in England.

Henry's ""personal"" shortcomings had dire impact on his country and changed history.",1517702400,,1002,5.166666666666667
7965162,5,B0000695JN,"I do not get people that praise Hollywood Tudors above this rich story told by no other than royal historian Dr David Starkey. For me is an honor listening to his accounts of such interesting subject. Also, there is a review out there that declares that Starkey's talks about a 10 year hold girl being in company of men when he did not say such thing. He only mentions that Katherine Howard came to the household of her guardian at that age and later came about all the allegations about her premature promiscuous life but not that she ""started"" at that age.
I certainly recommend this historical show to anyone interested in the Tudors times. He also made a documentary on Elizabeth I I also highly recommend.",1516838400,5,710,4.5984251968503935

7965165,2,B0000695JN,Moderately liked. Didn't learn much that I already hadn't learned from watching the show The Tudors.,1515283200,,100,5.3125
7965166,5,B0000695JN,"Initially, I thought this would be a movie about King Henry's six wives.  It's not.  It has actors but they don't talk.  Instead, they mime what the narrator is saying.  It's basically a more entertaining form of documentary.  Much more interesting than following a scholar around various castles and scenes while they describe the action.  In this production, you watch the actors do a great job acting out the scenes as the narrator is dubbed over top.  One you can accept that this is the style of film you are watching, this series is extremely informative and well done.  I've watched the 1970 BBC production of Henry VIII's Six Wives (which was very good), but this one was just as good.  The film and sound is updated, which makes it easier to watch, even if the story line isn't there.  This is an excellent choice for educational purposes.",1508198400,6,848,4.668918918918919
7965167,3,B0000695JN,"Informative, but not as detailed as I would have liked. I think there was a missed, but significant detail that I don't recall being mentioned... Jane Seymour (3rd wife) was the only wife out of all six that received a queen's funeral... if it was mentioned and I missed it, then my bad =)",1507334400,2,289,4.37037037037037
