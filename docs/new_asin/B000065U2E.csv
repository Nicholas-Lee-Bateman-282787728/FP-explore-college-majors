1710920,5,B000065U2E,"I totally disagree with the reviewer who said don't waste your money. The reason `some' of the scenes are stock footage is . . . there wasn't that much color footage taken in the Pacific Theater. What is in this film is very well done. The real surprise is the extra's which include: captured Japanese footage (including Pearl Harbor), Japanese propaganda films, and U.S. News Reels. Also, all types of Kamikazes are covered, Naval, Cherry Blossoms, and individual soldiers. I think this film is a real jewel. I highly recommend it if you enjoyed the WWII In Color `The Lost Archives' DVD's and/or WWII in Colour The British Story.",1184025600,10,631,4.798165137614679
1710921,2,B000065U2E,"The only reason for the star is that the color and DVD quality are ok.  As for the content:

Most of this DVD is stock footage.  If you've seen a fair number of vintage war movies and World War II documentaries, much if not all of this will be deja vu.  Not only is stock footage used, but it's used badly.  In a segment on B-29s, we see stock footage of B-17s.

There is extensive padding, with scenes repeated over and over for supposedly different battles.  There is further padding, with extensive segments that have nothing to do with Kamikazes; yet there's no attempt to provide historical background. (The narration contains silly, distracting grammatical gaffs.)

I'm watching a WWII movie from 1949 (Task Force), and I've already seen much of what the DVD has taken, plus some better scenes that the DVD omits, probably because they couldn't get the rights.  So much for this self-described ""extraordinary production"".

Which leads me to suspect that this is just a slapping together of public domain newsreels, held together with routine narrative.  It's mediocrity in a fancy package.

Don't waste your money.",1148774400,6,1120,4.898936170212766
1710922,5,B000065U2E,"Your perception of the decisive battles fought that turned the tide in the pacific for the Americans in 1944 - 1945 will change once you finish watching this title, I know it changed my mind. I thought the war was all against the Japanese and were slaughtered countless times but then again this ""declassified"" video has exposed that they fought valiantly at terrible results. 400 planes were used against the whole might of the Americans during their campaign of ""island-hopping"" and were so effective that some of the ships were sunk and some were to be withdrawn for repairs. Kamikaze or ""divine wind"" is rich in footage that will keep you in the edge of your seat. You will fully understand the reasons why the Japanese empire employed such bold move and embodied the ""samurai"" persona because of its effectiveness and tenacity. Although at the end you will see that the futility of the method you will appreciate what our great forefathers have done for the price of freedom during world war II. This title embraces all audiences from the american point of view and to the japanese. I rated this documentary 5 stars because of the sheer impact it has made to my perception of the ""kamikaze"".",1114646400,14,1196,4.7548076923076925

7961612,4,B000065U2E,"This is part of the ""in Colour"" series, including ""WWII in Colour,"" ""Japan's war in Colour,"" ""Hitler in Colour,"" and possibly one or two othersI've never been able to find a definitive series list.  In general, the series is well made, but it tends to jump around, treating topics not in any systematic way but I think mainly based on what color footage happened to be available.  The series also tends to be melodramatic and occasionally anachronistic.  Even so, I like them as a complement to more complete documentaries.  This particular documentary shares all the series' standard characteristics, but impressed me as being more comprehensive than most of the others.  This is, in fact, the most comprehensive documentary on the Kamikaze phenomenon that I have ever seen.  It is thorough, and includes a discussion of Kamikaze tactics in addition to technology and philosophy.",1394496000,2,880,5.118881118881119
7961613,4,B000065U2E,"The feature running time is revealed as 82 minutes, It is difficult to restrict yourself to primarily color footage available during WW2 and narrow the focus to kamikaze's, but it still manages to be interesting.  There is also some resorting to color paintings and a little CGI.  The explosion of the ammunition ship SS John Burke after being hit confused me at first with the Pacific nuclear bomb tests, it was that powerful looking.

The bonus features running times are hidden,  but I roughly clocked them at 2 hours and 7 minutes.  The Japanese footage would benefit from intros and English subtitles.  US Newsreels (b/w) are:  US Ships Fight Off Jap Planes; Army Navy Magazine #46 Second Battle Of The Philippines; Jap Zero w/Ronald Reagan (damaged VHS transfer); and silent footage of the sinking of the USS Franklin.  Japanese Newsreels (b/w) cover:  fleet fighting off American attack; Kamikaze mission flying off; attack on Pearl Harbor; floatplane operations; daily life aboard combat ships; and fleet operations.  Color Bonus footage covers: Kamikaze attacks on ships; gun camera footage from American planes; and Betty/Ohka shoot down.  Japanese Movies covers: recreation of the mini sub attack on Pearl Harbor; Japanese war games between the fleet and it's own aircraft; recreation of attack on a Far East British airfield; and a recreation of the bombing attack on the HMS Prince Of Wales(?).

Media appears to be DVD-R.",1382918400,,1435,5.137931034482759
7961614,5,B000065U2E,This is a great DVD about Kamikaze attacks in World War 2.  It is very informative and tells you why the Japanese High Command turned to these extreme measures.  It explains what the Japanes pilots believed and why they went through with these attacks.  If you are a Pacific theater buff like myself you will find it very interesting.  Our Navy took a pounding and sacrificed alot during the attacks but they never gave up.,1290038400,3,423,4.6
7961615,5,B000065U2E,"People just don't know what a great privilege it is to view footage such as this. These men should be reckoned immortals. Those great men spilled there blood on what was at the time regarded as ""our land"". I honor and welcome the reborn spirits of them with awe and admiration of the highest.",1271894400,3,292,4.425925925925926
7961616,4,B000065U2E,"The Japanese Kamikazes are the World War II equivalent of today's Muslim suicide bombers. Both had/have similar motivations. Both had/have the expectation of a reward in the afterlife.

It's easy to become inured to the frequent reports of the gruesome missions undertaken by men who are willing to take their lives as well as the lives of others for the sake of vengeance or as an expression of moral superiority.

If we need to be reminded that killing people en masse by suicide is nothing new, then this disc effectively drives the point home.

Most of the footage is not new. I've viewed the scene of the chaplain administering the Last Rites to the mortally wounded sailor many times before. But being able to see the kamikaze story on one disc gives one a wallop in the gut.

The explosions and fires aboard the ships that have been hit by suicide bombers are all the more terrible when seen in color. Cinch marks and other defects on the films are hardly noticeable when one is glued to the action.

We see the pilots on the ground, for example, drinking a glass of sake -- a gift from the emperor -- as well as in the air. And the horror aboard the ships is graphically depicted.

This is a good disc, well worth the cost.",1228780800,,1231,4.473214285714286
7961617,5,B000065U2E,"This is an outstanding video. I have watched many other videos in the course of my WWII research, and there are many scenes here that I have never seen before. They must have been recently declassifed since they are graphic and vivid. They show damage to US vessels, victims on both sides, Japanese video of pilots etc. They give a very comprehensive review of suicide operations, including my area of specialty, kaiten. Although explicit, this work is never exploitative. Highly recommended for the serious scholar.",1211328000,5,516,5.08235294117647
