8376673,5,B002P6X9IC,"Okay, let's get this out of the way right away... Most of these movies are all in the public domain, so they are easy enough to find on youtube or google vids if you want to watch them online. That said, the selection of movies and the transfers are actually surprisingly good!  If you are someone that would rather watch some classic films from the comfort of your couch in front of your television, as opposed to sitting in your office chair watching a 5x3"" video window on your monitor, than you'll probably appreciate having these films on dvd.

Admittedly, referring to some of the included features as 'science fiction' is a bit of a stretch.  Some would be more widly recognized as classic horror, but even these features find their horror based in science fiction or science gone wrong.

There are some real gems here however... Metropolis and the Phantom Planet alone are both heavyweight classics of the genre and should be in every serious science fiction fan's collection (in some format or another).

As I noted earlier, the transfers are all suprisingly good.  I was particularly surprised at the crispness of the Phantom Planet transfer along with a few others.

Factor in that you get a good quality wall calendar and this is a pretty good and fun investment.  I have my calendar hanging beside my desk at work and in 3 or 4 short weeks, it has become a real conversation piece.  Several clients have asked me where i got it and the indicated that they are going to look for this one or one of the other related calendars that the same company put out, including the horror calndar, the classic musical and the westerns.",1266364800,3,1636,4.633217993079585
