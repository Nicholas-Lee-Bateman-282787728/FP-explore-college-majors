8605130,5,B002RBNNIQ,"This must be one of the very best UNAVAILABLE films of recent years. There are some valid criticisms in the imdb reviews, but the fact is that this film plays out like a great tragedy, combining some of the most thrilling action scenes with absolutely believable performances by some of the best French actors today. This is not a ""star"" vehicle, it is never overplayed, and there is a tragic feeling at many times during the film and you will find yourself biting your nails all the way. Perhaps there are some continuity issues, but read the imdb reviews, almost all very enthusiastic, and try to get a hold of this film anywhere and any way you can... it's mature yet exciting European cinema at its best.",1281398400,,708,4.582677165354331
8605131,5,B002RBNNIQ,"I've to say that i was surprised by the quality of this movie. It's based on a true story and the director, Olivier Marchal, did an amazing job. From the actors (all, not only Depardieu and Auteuil), to the music and the picture, everything flows together. I hope Hollywood won't do a remake and destroy the charm of this movie!",1260662400,,328,4.483333333333333
