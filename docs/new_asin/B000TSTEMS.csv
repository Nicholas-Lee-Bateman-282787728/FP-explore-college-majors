2909822,4,B000TSTEMS,"I wrote to Warner and asked them to release the Superman Aquaman Hour in full. So they left the accompanying Superman stories out of both this and  their Superman release from earlier this year.
Add the fact that they left out the guest star segments originally in the show (Teen Titans, Justice League, Atom, Hawkman, Flash, Green Lantern), and I'm very disappointed. However, all36 Aquaman stories are here to enjoy, and they are among Filmation Studios' best work.
Let's keep nagging Warner to plug the gaps",1189209600,18,510,4.930232558139535

2909850,2,B000TSTEMS,"This one, like another early Filmation Saturday morning creation, The Adventures of Batman, are part of my Sunday morning memories. Sundays were the junkyard for what was previously hot on Saturdays. I remember this one quite fondly, but seeing it again, there's really very little that I could recommend. It's not that it's all that bad, there're just so many better examples for this period. Filmation just wasn't a phenomenal studio, truthfully, as popular as they were in the day, but they had the licensing for the DC comics characters. Also, Aquaman was much more popular at the time than now. A more entertaining example of the character can be found on the 2008 animated series, ""Batman: The Brave and the Bold"".",1407715200,,720,4.909836065573771

2909861,5,B000TSTEMS,"Aquaman is a much miligned hero. he is very underated. this is a pity as he is a great hero in his own right.

while I don't mind watching Superfriends I feel that they never treated Aquaman right. allthough some could argue many of the superheros on that show are not fully treated well.

be that as it may here in this series Filmation gets it right. they show Aquaman in all his glory as King of the Sea and protecter of the underwater world.

Aquaman and Aquaboy have many fun filled adventures. with their pet walrus Tusky, their steeds Storm and Imp. Mera aids them at times (though its never implied she and Aquman have a relaitonship). they face many of their well known villains. Black Manta, The Fisherman, Torpedoman. new villains show up in the form of Queen Vassa and the Brian.

in this full set of his complete adventures Aquman defends the underwater world. its all in the spirit of the Silver age comics. this show aided the sales of the Aquaman comics and is the best repesentation of a much maligned hero.",1402185600,2,1024,4.489247311827957

Unless you are a 100% true fan of the king of the shrimp you may want to pass this by, but if you love crab head you will adore this set! It has some of the most glorious cheesy moments in it that you could ever hope for, its all underwater so the plot devises are far and few but its a joy to see what comes up episode after episode. The villains are hilarious and would not strike fear in a grandmother with one leg and a fear of water.",1398297600,,672,3.8768115942028984

2909869,4,B000TSTEMS,"Aquaman always seems to be the punchline of jokes nowadays. However, for those who know the DC world, Aquaman used to be one of the cooler superheroes in the DC universe. Although he still gets made fun of, theres still a bit of coolness and chic that remain with the character. For instance, theres a reason he was chosen as the big superhero movie in the HBO series ENTOURAGE or just look at his recent escapades in the recently rebooted DC comics. Back in the day, before Aquaman was even more popular than Batman and from 1967-1968 he starred in his own half of a Saturday morning animated tv series: THE SUPERMAN/AQUAMAN HOUR OF ADVENTURE.  Later, when Superman was teamed up with a double billing with Batman, the Aquaman shorts were repackaged as 30 minute episodes. THE ADVENTURES OF AQUAMAN THE COMPLETE COLLECTION brings together all 36 of those AQUAMAN episodes. These cartoons are from a simpler time. Aquaman was molded in the same vein as Superman and The Lone Ranger, so he never tries to kill his enemies, only the hurt them before they can be captured or (in the case of meddlesome aliens) sent away. The plots often the same, but only with different characters. It usually goes like this: a villain wants to invade Atlantis or steal some precious items or something like that. Aquaman prevents it, but Aqualad gets in the way. Sometimes they mix it up and Aqualad saves Aquaman and saves the day. Othertimes, its a walrus named Tusky that gets in the way or saves the day. Those raised on the modern violence and extreme animation of the current era might not be able to appreciate a cartoon like AQUAMAN. However, the show is far more relaxing, contains many more values, and actually instills ideas the people can live up to. These are things many modern cartoons are completely lacking. The episodes in the series are as follows:

1. ""Menace of the Black Manta""
2. ""The Rampaging Reptile-Men
3. ""The Return Of Nepto
4. ""The Fiery Invaders""
5. ""Sea Raiders""
6. ""War Of The Water Worlds""
7. ""The Volcanic Monster""
8. ""The Crimson Monster From The Pink Pool""
9. ""The Ice Dragon""
10. ""The Deadly Drillers""
11. ""Vassa, Queen Of The Mermen
12. ""The Microscopic Monsters""  Black Manta reappears.
13. ""The Onslaught Of The Octomen""
14. ""Treacherous Is The Torpedo Man
15. ""The Satanic Saturnians""
16. ""The Brain, The Brave And The Bold""
17. ""Where Lurks the Fisherman!""
18. ""Mephisto's Marine Marauders""
19. ""The Trio Of Terror"" - Black Manta, Queen Vassa, and The Brain join forces.
20. ""The Torp, The Magneto And The Claw""
21. ""Goliaths Of The Deep-Sea Gorge""
22. ""The Sinister Sea Scamp""
23. ""The Devil Fish
24. ""The Sea Scavengers""
25. ""In Captain Cuda's Clutches""
26. ""The Mirror-Man From Planet Imago""
27. ""The Sea Sorcerer""
28. ""The Sea-Snares Of Captain Sly""
29. ""The Undersea Trojan Horse""
30. ""The Vicious Villainy Of Vassa
31. ""Programmed For Destruction""
32. ""The War Of The Quatix And The Bimphars""
33. ""The Stickmen Of Stygia""
34. ""Three Wishes To Trouble
35. ""The Silver Sphere""
36. ""To Catch A Fisherman""

There is a special feature on the DVD set entitled Aquaman: The Sovereign of the Seas. Its a retrospective that not only looks back at the AQUAMAN series, but also to Aquaman throughout his media history: in comics and on tv.
Overall, THE ADVENTURES OF AQUAMAN THE COMPLETE COLLECTION is a great DVD set for anyone who enjoys Aquaman or who likes action cartoons made in the 1960s and early 1970s.",1392595200,9,3432,4.753355704697986

It's obvious it did not get any special remastered type treatment. However, that is to be expected and it is still very viewable.  Also, it's fairly cheap on Amazon...",1377388800,,429,5.130434782608695
2909879,4,B000TSTEMS,"Following Filmation's success with their first season of 'The New Adventures of Superman', the next step was, logically, to incorporate other known DC characters into their animated world of sixties-era superheroes.  What Filmation came up with to fulfill this quota was 'The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure', which incorporated different segments of well-known (and some less so) DC Superheroes into one full hour show that ran from 1967-1968 on CBS.  This show was made up of the second seasons of 'The New Adventures of Superman' and 'The Adventures of Superboy', guest spot segments starring the Atom (Ray Palmer), the Flash (Barry Allen), Hawkman (Carter Hall), Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), the Justice League of America (incorporating all main heroes together) and the Teen Titans (Kid Flash (Wally West), Speedy (Roy Harper), Aqualad (Garth) and Wonder Girl (Donna Troy)), plus two segments starring Aquaman (Arthur Curry) and Aqualad, each roughly lasting 6-7 minutes in length.  It is these segments, 36 in total from the complete season, that are included in this DVD release distributed by Warner Brothers, forming part of the 'DC Comics Classic Collection'.
With each segment lasting six-seven minutes at best, the stories are not exactly plot-driven, but have more action and moral messaging aimed towards its young target audience of seven-eight year-olds.  The opening sequences open two Aquaman segments from each episode of the show, and these are subsequently followed by the programme end-credits, making eighteen fifteen-minute or so complete episodes of thirty-six segments (I know - it's a tad confusing!).  Aquaman is accompanied here by his quirky young sidekick Aqualad (who spends each episode exclaiming in a 'humorous' tone, some sort of undersea quip ('galloping guppies!' and 'leaping lampreys!' are among my favourites), Mera - Aquaman's wife and queen of Atlantis, Tusky - the aqua-duo's pet dog-like walrus, and their respective sea-horse helpers, Storm and Imp.  Many of the stories are very faithful to the show's comic book counterpart, and this is probably due to the fact that most were written by contemporary comic-book writers, such as George Kashdan and Bob Haney, amongst others.  Villains from the aqua-team's minor rogues gallery appear here for the first time in animated form, including Black Manta on a few occasions, the Fisherman, Torpedo Man, Captain Baracuda and Starro, as well as original villains the Brain and Queen Vassa of the mermen, amongst many others.
The stories, being pretty one-dimensional, may seem a bit repetitive at times, especially with Aqualad exclaiming 'Holy Haddocks!' at any given opportunity.  Also, there is not a lot of physical fighting on the part of the aqua-team and/or the villains, mainly due to the parents at the time complaining that comic book violence was the reason for childhood delinquency.  There is, however, a lot of on-screen action that was mainly achieved via the utilisation of stock footage, being a famous staple of Fillmation's productions, in order to keep costs down and to retain American employees within the country without the need for exporting.  This era of the silver-age of comics was made up of stories that explored the far-reaches of space and incorporated more science-fiction elements that were a direct response to the space-race of the sixties.  This meant that the animated shows at the time also reflected these silver-age exploits, and 'Aquaman' was no exception, with the aqua-duo having to explore a newly-discovered planet made of water upon the request of NASA on one occasion, and fighting off would-be sea conquerors from the planet Saturn on another.  Subsequently, these segments were re-packaged into a thirty-minute re-run series during 1970-71, simply titled 'Aquaman', and decades later it's influence can be seen in flashback sequences within episodes of 'Batman: The Brave and the Bold' that feature Aquaman as a guest-star, along with his supporting cast.
The DVDs themselves are placed in a fold-out cardboard sleeve, in the same vein as many other Filmation and Hanna-Barbera shows released through Warner Brothers, and is decorated with some rather colourful art-work from the series.  All thirty-six segments are presented, in original air-date order, across two discs, which can be viewed with or without English subtitles for the hearing-impaired.  The second disc includes trailers for other Warner Brothers DVD releases, such as 'The Smurfs Season One' and the 'Loony Toons Golden Collection Volumes 1-3', but the main extra is a twenty-six minute or so retrospective featurette exploring Aquaman's publication history and characterisation during the golden, silver and modern-age of comic books, as well as his depiction in various televisual media over the last few decades. This is a rather interesting look into the character of Aquaman, and how certain writers have approached him in showing his undersea kingdom to the many readers who have inevitably made this release possible.
All in all, 'The Adventures of Aquaman - The Complete Collection' is a great addition to the ever-expanding collection of classic sixties animation on DVD, as well as DC Comics' library of classic animated series.  As a useful accompaniment to this DVD-set, it is worth exploring two other releases from the Warner Brothers archive, including the first season of 'The New Adventures of Superman' and the two-disc set entitled 'DC Superheroes - The Filmation Adventures', which includes the aforementioned guest-spot segments from 'The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure'.  With luck, later seasons from the Filmation Adventures will become available on DVD in due course, and this collection will form a part of the complete package for all the world to see.",1372377600,2,5793,5.377483443708609

For all it's worth this was as wholesome a cartoon you can get for it's time.  I just consider the irony that had they not been removed by parents groups they would have enjoyed a much longer life.

2909929,4,B000TSTEMS,"First, a little history behind the series. These Aquaman episodes were originally broadcast in 1967 - 1968 as part of the Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure. The show featured not only the two heroes of the title, but also guest appearances by other characters such as The Atom, Green Lantern, Hawkman, The Flash, and even the Teen Titans. Then in 1968, just the Aquaman episodes were repackaged by CBS and the animation studio, Filmation, as the Aquaman show, which then ran from 1968 - 1970 on Saturday mornings. All 36 episodes (running about 6 - 7 minutes each) are included in this brand new two DVD set.

The show starred Marvin Miller as the voice of Aquaman and Ted Knight as the shows narrator as well as Aquaman's nemesis Black Manta. Miller provided the voice of Robby the Robot in the sci-fi classic, Forbidden Planet. Knight of course is best known for his portrayal as news anchor Ted Baxter in the Mary Tyler Moore Show and also as Judge Smales in Caddyshack. Knight also did a lot of work in animation. Besides Aquaman, he was the long time narrator of the Super Friends animated show. My only complaint about Knight is that he pronounces the characters name as if it were spelled ""ACK-waman"", and it's quite annoying.

The show was produced by Filmation, a fairly prolific animation studio during the 60's through the 80's. Among the classic Saturday morning shows they produced were The Archie Show, Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, Star Trek the Animated Series, the live-action Shazam series, The Groovie Goolies, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, and Bravestar. Filmation really has an incredible resume. Like rival studio, Hanna Barbera, Filmation perfected a low-cost approach to animation, particularly in their shows of the 60's and 70's. Backgrounds were repeatedly used over and over. An example of this is when Fred Flintstone runs through his living room and passes the same chair five times. They used rotoscoping a great deal as well to cut down on high animation costs. Still, they put out great TV shows and this is the kind of stuff I grew up on in the 70's. If only they would release the Jerry Lewis series on DVD!

These episodes are very basic. With the short running time there isn't much in the way of plot or character development. Generally we find out the threat in the first minute or so and then Aquaman along with Aqualad and his host of undersea allies has to save the day. There are some villains such as the aforementioned Black Manta but more often the threat is some kind of undersea monster like The Volcanic Monster, Ice Dragon, The Devil Fish, or the Satanic Saturnians. I was never a big Aquaman fan as he just seemed to me to be so limited. Everything had to be a sea adventure and how many times can you fight sea monsters. The animation, while budget, is pretty good and fluid. There is a pretty good featurette on the DVD called ""The Sovereign of the Seas"" and gives a history of the character from his creation in the 1940's to his Silver Age revamp to the present and includes comments and interviews with notable comic personalities as Paul Levitz, Mark Waid, Dwayne McDuffie, as well as former Filmation Director Hal Sutherland.

The summer of 1967 was one of the most exciting times of my childhood, once CBS began to run their ads for the ""Superman/Aquaman Hour Of Adventure."" I'd been an avid fan of Aquaman and Aqualad stories since their days in Adventure Comics, and, being that Aqualad was my favorite hero, I also followed his adventures with his land-bound friends, The Teen Titans. I watched the ""Aquaman"" series every Saturday for two years and for several years after on Sunday mornings at 7am. Thanks to ""The Adventures Of Aquaman"" DVD, I can now get my sleep and enjoy these cartoons any time.

The voice actors in the ""Aquaman"" series were amazing, most notably the manic performances of Ted Knight as the narrator, as well as playing nearly every villain featured. I can only imagine the contortions he went into while delivering lines for the Sea Sorcerer or Captain Barracuda. Marvin Miller, previously the voice of TV's ""The Millionaire,"" made for a wonderfully regal yet benign Aquaman, and Jerry Dexter's voicing of Aqualad quite nicely matched the innocent zeal of Aquaman's faithful friend and sidekick. (Every time I see the ""Jumpin' Jellyfish"" ride at Disney's California Adventure, I hear Jerry's voice in my head saying that line). Diana Maddox had more work at playing the trouble-making Queen Vassa or the winsome Wonder Girl in the ""Teen Titans"" filler cartoons of this series than as Mera, here featured as the Aqua-Duo's gal pal, rather than the wife she was to Aquaman by that time in print stories. (Let's hope that the Teen Titans and Justice League member cartoons which are regrettably missing from this DVD release will soon appear on a companion release).

This series closely reflected the innocent, uncomplicated and gleeful sort of stories in which Aquaman and Aqualad appeared during their Adventure Comics run, facilitated by fan-favorite comic book writers such as Bob Haney, Oscar Bensol and Dennis Marks, with consultation by Mort Weisinger. It didn't seem to matter that Aquaman borrowed Mera's hard water magic from the comics for a power boost here, or that Tusky thwarted as many of the villains' attacks on Atlantis as the Aqua-Duo did, nor that Aqualad, everyone's favorite purple-eyed future mage, spends part of nearly every episode unconscious. (""Three Wishes To Trouble"" almost foreshadows Aqualad's future role as the wizard Tempest, in its way). These characters are rendered with so much care and sense of fun that it was easy for an Aqua-fan to forgive such alterations. The artists at Filmation Studios made these undersea outings as inviting as that image of the ever-illuminated dome of Atlantis featured at the end of every show. Additionally, John Marion's lush soundtrack matched the sumptuous seascape backgrounds, making these undersea romps just that much more memorable.

Unlike the far more sinister and serious Aquaman later featured in Warner Bros. Animation's series ""Superman"" and ""Justice League,"" these jaunts with the Aqua-Duo (or ""Marine Marvels,"" take your pick) are a joy: light on violence (though Aqualad gets banged up early and often) and long on aquatic splendor, always ending in mirth and a hearty ""Let's head for home, Tadpole"" ...or ""Sardine,"" ""Squirt,"" ""Shrimp"" or ""Minnow."" (You'd think Aquaman could have had the decency to give the kid a real name, wouldn't you)? It's sad that it took forty years for WB Animation to clean up those bleeding reds from the old film stock and issue these fabulous cartoons as they originally appeared. If all you know of these episodes are the edited versions from USA Network or Boomerang, treat yourself to this set of the real deal. It is, as Aqualad says, ""great fun"" to see our intrepid aquatic heroes riding the waves to adventure in glorious comic book colors once again. Filmation owned my Saturday mornings in the late 1960s and I love reliving that era through this marvelous series.",1200960000,3,4168,5.329787234042553
2909932,4,B000TSTEMS,"Great gastropods!  Aquafans everywhere are all a-tingle over this swell 2-DVD collection of 36 six-minute animated adventures starring the King of the Seven Seas, Aquaman (that's ""ACK-wa-man,"" not ""AH-kwa-man"").  These charmingly corny programs, narrated by Too Close for Comfort's Ted Knight, are dripping with nostalgia and bubbling over with fun!  Sadly, the discs come in one of Warner's universally despised el cheapo, super-skinny digipack cases.  That means you can't remove Disc 2 without first removing Disc 1.  Sufferin' starfish!--I loathe this type of case!  On the plus side, the artwork printed on all sides of the cardboard is sensational.  The picture quality of the cartoons themselves is also good, with vibrant colors that will make your eyeballs water with delight.  As with most Filmation shows, the characters are drawn very simply with bold black outlines.  The Sea King's suit lacks the scales seen in the comics, and the whites of his eyes are incorrectly flesh colored.  The exotic undersea backgrounds are nicely detailed.  But--holy haddocks!--doesn't that exact same school of fish appear in almost every episode?

As any comic book aficionado worth his saltwater knows, Aquaman has the power to communicate telepathically with sea creatures via a series of white rings that emanate from the center of his forehead.  Oddly enough, the denizens of the deep always obey his commands.  Wailin' wolf fish!--I wish my dog was half that obedient!  What's more, the orange and green-clad marvel is able to keep his wavy blonde hair perfectly coifed at all times, despite the fact that he's constantly swimming in the ocean.  Slitherin' seaweed!--his skin doesn't even get wrinkly in the water!  Tragically, Aquaman cannot survive on land for more than an hour...which, as you can imagine, is quite an inconvenience.

The Sea King's ability to breathe in the ocean is shared by his excitable teenaged ally, the underwater boy wonder, Aqualad (a.k.a. ""Tadpole"").  Since he lacks the power to talk to fish, or to do anything else that's particularly useful, Aqualad spends much of his time thinking up clever new interjections to blurt into his ring radio whenever there's trouble.  These exclamatory word-pairs typically consist of the name of a sea creature preceded by a verb, preferably beginning with the same letter of the alphabet, for example: jumpin' jellyfish, leapin' lobsters, bouncin' blowfish, etc.  Note that it is customary not to pronounce the `g' at the end of the action word.  Aqualad greatly enjoys repeating his alliterative exclamations with intolerable frequency.  If the lad's hapless pet walrus, Tusky, could speak to him by way of mental telepathy, the toothy mammal would undoubtedly ask the ebullient teenager to stop yelling ""Leapin' lampreys!"" every other minute, and try barking for a change.  And--mumblin' mantas!--Tusky does bark quite a bit, as he has a penchant for getting into trouble and becomes panic-stricken at the drop of a seashell.

The amazing Aquaduo, together with their freakishly overgrown seahorses, Storm and Imp, monitor the seven seas from the Aquacave--an ultra high-tech underwater laboratory crowded with waterproof computers and giant maps.  These extraordinary electronics allow Aquaman to keep tabs on his countless enemies, such as: the infamous Black Manta and his red-faced Manta Men; the green-skinned mermaid queen, Vassa; the sandstorm-conjuring Sea Sorcerer, keeper of the vile Book of Magic; Captain Sly, with his invisible plastic bag traps; the demonic Mephisto, with his deadly vibro-beam; Snork the Great, the untrustworthy undersea genie; the blue-faced Sea Scamp and his trio of bear-like Bulks; and the hideously deformed diabolical genius known only as The Brain...just to name a few.  Jumpin' jackfish!--the oceans are practically overflowing with bad guys!

Although the multi-talented A-man is sometimes called upon to solve problems in faraway places--like the time the golden-haired meddler traveled to Planet Q344 in a waterlogged spaceship to organize a peace conference between the Quatix and the Bimphars--he is primarily concerned with the protection of the shimmering city of Atlantis.  Because the citizens of Atlantis breathe air, the underwater kingdom is shielded from the ocean by a massive glass dome.  For some reason, most of Aquaman's adversaries desperately want to smash said dome so the seawater will--sputtering spoonbills!--rush in and flood the city!  True, Aquaman can hurl balls of compressed water, and spin like a propeller to create powerful waves, but the oceanic guardian relies heavily on his fishy friends to assist him in thwarting the sinister plans of the myriad villains that threaten Atlantis on a daily basis.  Of course, a great deal of strategy is required in deciding which gilled critter to employ to successfully carry out each required task.  Nevertheless, the vulnerable people of Atlantis ultimately owe their lives to the whales, sharks, dolphins, and octopi, who are always willing to lend a fin, a flipper, or a tentacle to do their water-breathing master's bidding without hesitation or complaint.

The coveted Aquaman DVD set includes just one interesting extra: a 25-minute featurette entitled, ""Sovereign of the Seas.""  Unfortunately, this mini-documentary focuses on the history of the Aquaman character, and offers little to no information about the making of these uniquely entertaining Filmation shorts.  Weapin' weakfish!

I leave you with these words of wisdom from that pupilless clam-dweller, Oceanus, the sagacious Old Man of the Sea: ""A two-legged fish can only be caught by a two-legged bait.""  Buzzin' barracuda!--that old man is smarter than The Brain!",1200268800,4,5717,5.403607666290868
2909933,5,B000TSTEMS,"As a kid, I recall watching the Aquaman series as a afterschool program, and enjoyed the adventures of him,his sidekick Aqualad and Tuskie the Walrus. Seeing these retro cartoons finally being released on DVD is a big treat for me even today, because we all still have a little kid inside of us.

I also purchased The Adventures of Superman cartoons, that aired the same time as Aquaman. I enjoy watching these also. I hope the company that released The Adventures of Superman and Aquaman, will eventually release more of the original Superhero series from that time. For example, The Adventures of Superboy,Green Lantern, Flash, and the Atom all shows which I watched as a kid afterschool. I'm sure all who purchase this and watch them, will enjoy them even now.

2909935,5,B000TSTEMS,"I will be the first to tell anyone that the Filmation animated series were responsible for some of my greatest childhood memories. From the Archie cartoons to the DC Superheroes interpretations and even the  Star Trek animated series which is part of my DVD library. When I read that the Aquaman series was finally going to be released, to say that I was overjoyed would be an understatement.

This is by far one of the best interpretations of the underused and underappreciated characters in comic book history  and might I add,one of the most beloved series.

This series was so cool. It had the classic Aquaman villains such as The Fisherman,Torpedoman and of course,Black Manta. My favorite cast members were Storm and Imp the giant seahorses and Tusky the walrus who always were able to get the Aquaduo out of any jam and each episode had plenty of fast paced action.

If I had any complaint is that Mera, Aquaman's wife was depicted  as more a teenager and a thorn in The Sea King's side instead of his queen but other than that this was, and still is, a great series and one I recommend to anyone to add to their Aquaman and/or superhero DVD collection.",1199145600,2,1160,4.606796116504855
2909936,4,B000TSTEMS,"Aqualad: ""What's the matter, Aquaman?""

Aquaman: ""I don't know. The fish are trying to tell me something.""

My man Arthur Curry (aka Aquaman) has been around a long time, having debuted in More Fun Comics in 1941 and off-and-on starring in his own comic book. And, despite the longevity and near-but-not-quite iconic stature, there are busloads of people who just aren't feeling Aquaman. And I guess I can see where they're coming from. He's a bit hard to pigeonhole, this outsider, as he's forever tiptoeing the line of superhero and undersea sovereign. Priorities are a definite issue. With much cooler capes like Batman, Superman, the Flash, and Green Lantern doing their thing, Aquaman as a superhero pales in comparison, right? I mean, he's a guy whose super powers are chit-chatting with fish, breathing underwater, and swimming really fast. And these talents don't really translate well when he ventures to shore. Not to mention, remove him from his watery environs for longer than an hour, and he croaks. Wussy stuff, right? But here's the thing: I dig Aquaman. I liked him lots when I was a mere tadpole, and this was because of his cartoon show. When I was a teen it became more of a pity liking, a rooting-for-the-underdog thing. I felt bad for the guy, relegated all the time to secondary status in the Super Friends show and in the JLA comics. But at least he had his own cartoons.

From 1967 to 1968, CBS thrilled kids of all ages with THE SUPERMAN/AQUAMAN HOUR OF ADVENTURE, a Filmation-produced animated series. This hour-long show, comprised of 7 minute episodes, not only starred the titular superheroes (and Superboy) but also provided ""guest"" episodes featuring the Flash, Hawkman, the Atom, Green Lantern, the JLA, and the Teen Titans. Later in 1968, this show was retooled as a half hour show and titled simply AQUAMAN, although the ""guest"" spots were still re-ran (Superman and Superboy, however, were ix-nayed). Maybe, someday, we'll see a dvd with these ""guest"" episodes, but for now I feel good that the high muck-a-mucks are releasing the entire Aquaman cartoon collection.

THE ADVENTURES OF AQUAMAN - THE COMPLETE COLLECTION returns us to a time when Aquaman was perceived as clean-cut, straight-laced, and non-controversial, long before writer Peter David got his nervy hands on him in the mid-'90s and proceeded to do the big makeover. Fans of the Justice League Unlimited TV series would now know him as a burly, long-haired, bearded figure, arrogant and lordly, naked to the waist and with a hook for a hand. And someone NOT to be effed with. I don't know what DC Comics has in store for Aquaman because I haven't been keeping up with his current title (although I hear AQUAMAN: SWORD OF ATLANTIS just ended its run with issue #57). Anyway, his more recent incarnation is quite a drastic change from his erstwhile squeaky clean image. Speaking of which, let's go back to the Aquaman cartoons.

The Aquaman cartoons shy from typical superhero fare, certain limitations coming with having the ocean as your workplace. No cops and robbers as we know it. No familiar cityscapes. The rules are different. And, yet, there's evidently more villainy in the waters than one would assume. Assisting Aquaman (and sometimes hindering him) in his policing of the Seven Seas and safeguarding the domed city of Atlantis are Aqualad (a clear sidekick ripoff of Robin) and the lovely Mera, whom I don't think is Aquaman's wife here. Aquaman doesn't really have a standout cast of supervillains on his rolodex, perhaps another reason why he's not more popular. Black Manta, his most vaunted superfoe, makes two appearances (""Menace of the Black Manta"" and ""The Silver Sphere""). The Sea King is equally busy with other recurring nasties the Mer-Queen Vassa, the Fisherman, and the Brain. Aquaman also tackles a bevy of vile deep sea monsters or creatures and dastardly space aliens, one race of whom merely wanted to shrink and collect ocean life samples, but they should never have taken Tusky. And, sometimes, Aquaman's adventures enter into the realm of the just plain weird. ""War of the Water Worlds,"" for one - in which Aquaman stumbles onto another water world lying beneath the ocean - is memorable for the grotesque fishes and monsters.

All 36 shorts are here in all their 7 minute glory, and they look fabulous on my screen. These Aquaman cartoons didn't try to change the world or champion a cause or go overboard with plot or character development. At seven minutes long, is you crazy? Not much chance here for intricate world shaking stuff. Instead, these episodes are ideal for the kiddies and their miniscule attention span. Aquaman made an impression on me when I first saw him on the idiot box, what with the aquatic superheroics and the nutty walrus and cool seahorses and the science-fictiony Aqua Cave and the very cool watery kingdom. The clearest memory I probably have of this show is Aquaman fashioning hard water spheres or swirls with his hands and then pelting 'em at whatever. The undersea world is conveyed in a wash of brilliant colors, lending it a truly mysterious and otherworldly feel. And I remember how I keenly marveled at the grace with which Aquaman and company navigated thru the deeps. For late '60s animation, Filmation did excellent work, with special note to the characters' smooth movements. I try not to use the adjective ""gorgeous"" too much, because, well, you know...But, what the hell, this show looks gorgeous! And, if nothing else, you get to learn more about the many denizens of the sea as Aquaman is forever asking for help from the fishies.

Special Feature: ""Aquaman: The Sovereign of the Seas"" - A neat 26-minute-long retrospective featurette which covers Aquaman's comic book evolution, his involvement with HBO's Entourage, his guest spots in SMALLVILLE and the TV pilot which was supposed to (but never did) lead to an ongoing live-action series.",1193788800,84,7223,4.913934426229508
2909937,5,B000TSTEMS,"Ah Filmation, first THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN and then THE ADVENTURES OF AQUAMAN (originally THE SUPERMAN/AQUAMAN HOUR OF ADVENTURE 1967)! Well done by all. Good times, good times.

I gotta give Lou, Norm, Hal, and the FILMATION crew credit, they made Aquaman and his world exciting. From stopping an invasion in an inter-dimentional water world to halting a civil war on another planet Filmation's Aquaman ran the gammit. Along with his teen partner Aqualad our hero showed every super-villain and would-be conqueror that if you invade his seas you will get your butt kicked (either by bull-whale or a super-dense hard water ball upside your face). In Filmation's series Aquaman was truly The King of the Seven Seas!

Filmation did right what Hanna-Barbera's SUPER FRIENDS later did wrong: TREATED AQUAMAN WITH RESPECT. In THE ADVENTURES OF AQUAMAN our hero has his enhanced strength & super-speed. He's a excellent strategist and leader. He throws a mean punch and hard water jet. He doesn't believe in killing (""Treacherous is the Torpedo Man"") and is a strong believer in peace (""The War Between the Quantix and the Bimphars"").
No riding shot-gun for this Aquaman (like he would later to in SUPER FRIENDS). Riding his loyal sea-horse Storm looked much more heroic than sitting in the Invisible Jet.
On this show Aquaman GETS THE JOB DONE!

And his Rogues Gallery is pretty decent too. Yep, Black Manta is here (of course) but so is The Fisherman and The Torpedo Man. Plus newbies: Queen Vassa, The Brain, Captain Barracuda & Starro (not THAT Starro, sorry JLA fans), and many monsters, rogues, and hidden realms.

One major factor about Filmation's Aquaman is in his use of his telepathic powers. On this show Aquaman had an undersea army and he definitely used it (seeing a bull whale smash a super-villain sub is always fun). Plus it was cool to see what ""specialist"" he'd call for a particular task.

The animation was an improvement from last season's SUPERMAN, especially seeing the Aqua-Duo swimming into action (the introduction is VERY COOL). It was very fluid (pun intended).
And the bonus extra documentary of the History of Aquaman was very nice indeed. I won't spoil it but I will say I'm glad to see Aquaman getting his props.

Is the show faultless? Of course not (Aqualad's ""Holy Haddock"" can ride the nerves sometimes) but it played the hand it was dealt and was a ratings hit in 1967/68. The show proved when treated with care Aquaman can easily rank with the best of them.

It was fun and I'm glad I bought it.",1193529600,25,2537,4.831797235023042
