8015814,5,B0001OGV9O,"There are two kinds of television show DVD collections, at least from what I've seen. You've got those which try to release each and every single episode that ever came out of a program (including the ones that never made it to air), and then you've got those which try to serve as compilations, giving people a taste of multiple programs by using select episodes to try and give viewers a feel for what the shows primarily entailed. This definitely falls into the latter category, and serves as an excellent sampler of more than a few legendary westerns. Talk about a hall of fame... this box set presents episodes from several of the greatest westerns of all time, all taken from the original master reels (which is made evident by the presence of some rare and uncommon closing logos at the end of each program) but which appear to have been remastered for the best video/audio possible with shows that go this far back. Most certainly some broadcast-quality episodes, and ones that you probably won't see on TV any time soon (at least not THIS well-preserved). Since this is a DVD box set, you don't have to worry about annoying logo bugs or split-screen credits. You get the original programs, untouched/unaltered/unedited/unchanged. From the opening sequences to the episodes themselves to the closing credits and everything in between, nothing has been butchered or manipulated. You can rest assured that this is a quality box set, and one that you will not regret purchasing if you decide to buy it.",1361577600,5,1507,4.844961240310077
