I watched  92 minutes of 2 girls running away from their father, twirlling around for the camera, going into this bazarre fifth dimention where what you want to come true does.  One girl wants a boyfriend,and gets him.  The boy likes her sister so the first girl shoots him. Within minutes each girl is acting is if nothing has happened. Twirlling around in sunlight. In the end they wave to a train as they finally decide they want to be back to civilization.  Stupid stuff like that is NOT family entertainment. Wanna waste your money on garbage? Buy this one. This is a Wonderworks DOG!",1032739200,,672,4.467213114754099

Haunting & lyrical, it has a very European feel to it, despite the fact that it was filmed in Texas.  I have a theory that moviegoers who are also big readers with adore this film & its pacing.  Others simply won't have the patience to discover & treasure this film's unique subtleness.
If you own a Disney film, or need every single frame of a film spelled out to you well, or you think Spielberg is great don't bother; this isn't a film for your type.",1021939200,5,618,4.3478260869565215
7879359,4,6304909705,"This movie is not for everyone. If you don't like independent, artsy, indee like films then I wouldn't recomend watching this. If you do, you will proably really enjoy this film.  It's about two sisters who embark on  a journey through their imagination. You never really know if what is going  on is real or pretend. This isn't really a family movie because I don't see  children enjoying it. It's definatly for the art loving type.",961027200,4,433,4.657894736842105
