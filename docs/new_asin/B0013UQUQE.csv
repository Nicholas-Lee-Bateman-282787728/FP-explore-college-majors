3119531,5,B0013UQUQE,"The life and work and personality and emotions of Sally Mann are beautifully filmed and evoked, a must to understand her complex, rich, intense personality, her relationship with her children and particularly her husband is deeply touching. Some scenes when she is photographing dead bodies for her show and book What Remains are hard to cope with, but resonate in her artistic , so Southern soul in mixing life and death and love and memory so intensely",1214006400,21,454,4.909090909090909

3119533,4,B0013UQUQE,"I saw this documentary when it premiered at Hot Docs in 2006, and have been waiting since then for its DVD release.  As a documentary producer myself, it inspired me to delve into a project that would reveal the intimate and personal details of the life of an artist.  I found it compelling, funny at times, sad, and very informative of Sally Mann's life and creative process.",1213142400,8,376,4.597014925373134

3119535,5,B0013UQUQE,"I saw this documentary at the Look Photo Festival in Virginia last June and it was incredible.  It shed so much light on her thought process and ideas and even showed footage of her actually taking some of her most famed photographs.

3119540,5,B0013UQUQE,"Phenomenal look at a working artist. Done in the late-1990s-early 2000s, so a bit dated as her career goes. Devastating news this summer as the reports of her son's suicide were made public. Emmett was such a beautiful kid. What a tragedy for the family and the art world. His death amplifies the work she was doing capturing death in her project, ""What Remains.""",1475539200,2,363,4.6875
3119541,5,B0013UQUQE,"Because Sally Mann has been my favorite photographer for the last 22 years, I probably spent most of this film with tears in my eyes. I loved seeing what she saw, how she made some of her indelible images, and how she confidently embraced her artistry and her peculiarities. I was rapt. I also felt a little redeemed for the way I also find beauty in unusual things--bones, bugs, death. This was a powerful way to spend a rainy Saturday.",1475280000,,437,4.475
3119542,5,B0013UQUQE,You simply will not believe how ridiculously good this memoir is. Some artists are brilliant at one thing. Photographer Sally Mann proves that she is GREAT at (at least) two.,1473638400,,174,4.833333333333333

3119565,5,B0013UQUQE,"Frankly, Sally Mann's photography makes me uncomfortable. Top that off with the fact that this video is a very personal look into her life, which in some ways is as unsettling as her art, makes for a fascinating view into what makes this great artist.",1454976000,,251,4.6
3119566,2,B0013UQUQE,Sally is a very gifted photographer and talented writer.  The movie does not do her justice.  The movie kept my interest because I was hooked by her abilities.  Her concentration on the use of antique view cameras and photo processing techniques is interesting but surprising given the unlimited potential she would be able to show us in this digital age.  Most everything she does through her huge antique processing effort could be digitally duplicated.,1454457600,,455,5.108108108108108

Clear, easy to follow, personal but not too personal...a perfect look into the life of one great photographer, Sally Mann.

I'm not sure I would be comfortable with sharing nude pictures of my children as a parent, given the world we live in. But in a better world there's nothing wrong with it. Her children seem well-grounded and happy, and the photos are certainly thought-provoking and beautiful. The artist is lucky (and so are we) that she has a supportive husband who also shares an artist's perspective, providing an environment in which she could create freely. It's also good that Mann was able to find an appropriate venue for her photographic exploration of death, which is an inevitability whether we like it or not.",1419292800,4,699,4.882352941176471

3119616,5,B0013UQUQE,"I studied with Sally at the Maine Photo Workshop in the late 80's. I later visited and dined with her in Lexington. The film represented the Sally I knew and loved and gave a good description of her wet plate technique and creative process. I was happy to see her kids grown, I remember chatting with them at her show at Joe Tart Gallery in DC in roughly 1989. I was so sorry to hear of larry's illness. I remember him showing me some creative blacksmithing on my visit.  I enjoy daily the photo I made of her lying on the Maine forest floor.",1401062400,3,542,4.211538461538462

3119618,5,B0013UQUQE,"This is the second documentary Steven Cantor made on Sally Mann. The first was a 30 minute film titled ""Blood Ties: The Life and work of Sally Mann"". ""Blood Ties"" concentrated on Sally's very controversial publication ""Immediate Family"", this is a much longer documentary being an hour and twenty minutes in length and is a far more comprehensive view of her life and work.
This documentary discusses several aspects of her life, from childhood to the time the documentary was filmed. Sally talks at length about her father and other things from her childhood which affected her, especially her view of art. She also describes how and when she met her husband.
A brief discussion of her series ""Immediate Family"" is included but is only a small portion of the overall film, which does include some information on what her now grown children are doing. (When ""Blood Ties"" was made they were still young children.) Sally discusses the morphing of her work from children to landscapes, which resulted in her ""Deep South"" series.
She goes on from there to explain how the death of an escaped convict on her property and other deaths got her started on a new project about decay. That is project for which this film is named. This film spends more time on her ""What Remains"" series than on her other works. Video of her walking through the Forensic Study Facility for the University of Tennessee and examining and photographing the bodies decomposing there is included in the film.
This is an amazing look into the life and work of Sally Mann. It does contain some nudity, both of her children and of her husband. This nudity in mainly in the display of the photographs she has taken of her husband and children.
""Blood Ties: The Life and Work of Sally Mann"" is included with the extras on this DVD (and is also available on a separate DVD from Amazon.com). The extras on this DVD also include eight deleted scenes, excerpts from a photojournalism conference at which Sally spoke, and a few photos from her ""Deep South"" series, her ""Immediate Family"" series, and from her ""What Remains"" series.",1394582400,5,2089,4.773480662983426

3119620,5,B0013UQUQE,"I love Sally Mann.  This documentary is interesting because it starts off almost like a biography, but then it takes a turn in showing the recent ups and downs of her career.

I ended up watching it several times. Once to acquaint myself with the film as a whole, then again and again to glean information from it. I like that it gives insight into a broad span of Mann's life, not merely the ""What Remains"" era as the title might imply.",1356566400,,410,4.074074074074074

How it kept such coherence while relaying so much information about Mann as well as her family as well as her photography as well as photography in general.  The landscape, the home, the family and Mann herself -- all eloquent subjects.  What a jewel to discover one night--and it continues to haunt and inspire days later.

3119629,5,B0013UQUQE,Sally Mann is one of my favorite photographers. This was an amazing film. I cried a few times because it was so touching. It was very inspiring and informative. I am going to show this to my photography studnets and strike up the conversation about what is being debated in terms of her work...is it art? This is a great educational tool and will be a great addition to my personal library.,1321920000,,390,4.430555555555555
3119630,5,B0013UQUQE,"Easily one of the best documentaries on photography and the artistic process that I've seen. This film is interesting to me in so many ways. Technically, it's amazing to see Sally work with the 8x10, especially in the field with wet plates. As a photographer, I'm inspired to see the marriage of technical skill and personal vision that we all of us strive to achieve, but few of us do. As an artist, it's incredible to see the struggle that Sally goes through to express her view of the world... moments of self doubt, failure, and triumph. This is the life of one of the best photographers of the 20th century, beautifully and shamelessly captured. Buy it, watch it, learn. I did.",1295222400,5,682,4.598360655737705

3119632,5,B0013UQUQE,"If you want to learn more about Sally Mann as a photographer, this is great. If you want to see how people struggle with the creative process, this is a great film. If you want to be inspired with how some people deal with adversity and come back even stronger, or how life events shape one's art, you will also appreciate it. For me personally, what I take away from the film is how when scary or bad things happen to most people, they avert, avoid, bury, and forget. The real artist keeps looking, never blinking, and really examines everything, even death, until they find or make something truly profound.

I have my photo students watch this, and at first they are creeped out. Eventually they come around and love it too. Every time I watch it, I see something else that the film maker did, subtle but great transitions and cuts that add layers of meaning. Totally worth buying.",1266624000,5,884,4.525
3119633,5,B0013UQUQE,"Sally Mann is one of my art heroes.  Mann approaches relatively simple subject matter (such as landscapes, her family & death) & makes them profound through exploration & representation.  Mann sees these subjects through a lens (literally & metaphorically) which compels the viewer to reevaluate meaning and thus, hopefully, to grow psychologically and emotionally.  In my eyes, this is the ultimate purpose of art.

This documentary presents Sally Mann & her family in intimate terms.  The viewer gets a good feeling for whom she is, what motivates her and her style of working process. I highly recommend this for any photographer/artist whom is interested in pushing the limits of their own arts.",1241740800,2,699,5.205357142857143
3119634,5,B0013UQUQE,"Sally Mann is one of the most important photographers of our time, and this dvd is essential to understanding her work as an artist. This dvd deserves 6 stars because in the extras it includes the 30 minute oscar nominated documentary ""Blood Ties"" that aired on HBO in the early 90's during the ""Immediate Family"" photos. As well as the new full length doc that takes you through the ""What Remains"" era and how that concept unfolded from her husbands illness, into the death of her dog, into the suicide of a prisoner on her farm, into the civil war landscapes, into the photos of decaying bodies, into the photos of her children. She really challenges all of our concepts and fears of the subject of death and breaks it down to a beautiful idea of a natural process. I really can't say enough about how important her work is, but this dvd will. All i can say is this is worth your time and money.",1239840000,16,897,4.409638554216867

3354099,4,B0013UQUQE,"This documentary was very thought provoking for me.  After watching, I did a little research of my own and found that Mann gets lots of Federal funding.

3354109,4,B0013UQUQE,"Idyllic views of the Kentucky landscape and lovely insights into an artist's mind and family. I'm not sure I would be comfortable with sharing nude pictures of my children as a parent, given the world we live in. But in a better world there's nothing wrong with it. Her children seem well-grounded and happy, and the photos are certainly thought-provoking and beautiful. The artist is lucky (and so are we) that she has a supportive husband who also shares an artist's perspective, providing an environment in which she could create freely. It's also good that Mann was able to find an appropriate venue for her photographic exploration of death, which is an inevitability whether we like it or not.",1419292800,4,699,4.882352941176471

3354113,5,B0013UQUQE,"I studied with Sally at the Maine Photo Workshop in the late 80's. I later visited and dined with her in Lexington. The film represented the Sally I knew and loved and gave a good description of her wet plate technique and creative process. I was happy to see her kids grown, I remember chatting with them at her show at Joe Tart Gallery in DC in roughly 1989. I was so sorry to hear of larry's illness. I remember him showing me some creative blacksmithing on my visit.  I enjoy daily the photo I made of her lying on the Maine forest floor.",1401062400,3,542,4.211538461538462
3354114,4,B0013UQUQE,Interesting to see how an artist takes photos.  Great to see someone using 100 yr old cameras to get such interesting subject matter.  Great affects from the way she develops the negatives onto glass panels.,1399766400,,207,4.885714285714286
3354115,5,B0013UQUQE,"This is the second documentary Steven Cantor made on Sally Mann. The first was a 30 minute film titled ""Blood Ties: The Life and work of Sally Mann"". ""Blood Ties"" concentrated on Sally's very controversial publication ""Immediate Family"", this is a much longer documentary being an hour and twenty minutes in length and is a far more comprehensive view of her life and work.
This documentary discusses several aspects of her life, from childhood to the time the documentary was filmed. Sally talks at length about her father and other things from her childhood which affected her, especially her view of art. She also describes how and when she met her husband.
A brief discussion of her series ""Immediate Family"" is included but is only a small portion of the overall film, which does include some information on what her now grown children are doing. (When ""Blood Ties"" was made they were still young children.) Sally discusses the morphing of her work from children to landscapes, which resulted in her ""Deep South"" series.
She goes on from there to explain how the death of an escaped convict on her property and other deaths got her started on a new project about decay. That is project for which this film is named. This film spends more time on her ""What Remains"" series than on her other works. Video of her walking through the Forensic Study Facility for the University of Tennessee and examining and photographing the bodies decomposing there is included in the film.
This is an amazing look into the life and work of Sally Mann. It does contain some nudity, both of her children and of her husband. This nudity in mainly in the display of the photographs she has taken of her husband and children.
""Blood Ties: The Life and Work of Sally Mann"" is included with the extras on this DVD (and is also available on a separate DVD from Amazon.com). The extras on this DVD also include eight deleted scenes, excerpts from a photojournalism conference at which Sally spoke, and a few photos from her ""Deep South"" series, her ""Immediate Family"" series, and from her ""What Remains"" series.",1394582400,5,2089,4.773480662983426

3354117,5,B0013UQUQE,"I love Sally Mann.  This documentary is interesting because it starts off almost like a biography, but then it takes a turn in showing the recent ups and downs of her career.  This documentary is an intimate portrait of Sally Mann in her personal enviroment.  Rich with honest emotions, vulnerability and perseverance.  Definitely inspired me.",1385769600,,343,5.181818181818182
3354118,5,B0013UQUQE,I highly recommend this to photographers and alike. Sally Mann is wonderful and her work has so much feeling. Not just a picture. I look up to her and she is aspiring. You won't be disappointed.,1383609600,,194,4.416666666666667

3354122,5,B0013UQUQE,"I used this as a source for a paper in my History of Photography class, and while I had watched it before, I did not find myself bored in the least. I ended up watching it several times. Once to acquaint myself with the film as a whole, then again and again to glean information from it. I like that it gives insight into a broad span of Mann's life, not merely the ""What Remains"" era as the title might imply.",1356566400,,410,4.074074074074074
3354123,5,B0013UQUQE,"The scope of this was surprising and powerful.  How it kept such coherence while relaying so much information about Mann as well as her family as well as her photography as well as photography in general.  The landscape, the home, the family and Mann herself -- all eloquent subjects.  What a jewel to discover one night--and it continues to haunt and inspire days later.  Congratulations to this artist of a director and to the cinematographer.  What a collaboration all the way around.  Stunning.",1355270400,,498,4.9397590361445785

3354125,5,B0013UQUQE,I was slightly sad when I ordered this item because I was told it would probably not be here by Christmas. It was my own fault for buying it so close to the Holiday. In reality the item arrived several days before Christmas and I was elated. It was in perfect condition.,1326672000,,270,4.211538461538462
3354126,5,B0013UQUQE,Sally Mann is one of my favorite photographers. This was an amazing film. I cried a few times because it was so touching. It was very inspiring and informative. I am going to show this to my photography studnets and strike up the conversation about what is being debated in terms of her work...is it art? This is a great educational tool and will be a great addition to my personal library.,1321920000,,390,4.430555555555555
3354127,5,B0013UQUQE,"Easily one of the best documentaries on photography and the artistic process that I've seen. This film is interesting to me in so many ways. Technically, it's amazing to see Sally work with the 8x10, especially in the field with wet plates. As a photographer, I'm inspired to see the marriage of technical skill and personal vision that we all of us strive to achieve, but few of us do. As an artist, it's incredible to see the struggle that Sally goes through to express her view of the world... moments of self doubt, failure, and triumph. This is the life of one of the best photographers of the 20th century, beautifully and shamelessly captured. Buy it, watch it, learn. I did.",1295222400,5,682,4.598360655737705

3354129,5,B0013UQUQE,"If you want to learn more about Sally Mann as a photographer, this is great. If you want to see how people struggle with the creative process, this is a great film. If you want to be inspired with how some people deal with adversity and come back even stronger, or how life events shape one's art, you will also appreciate it. For me personally, what I take away from the film is how when scary or bad things happen to most people, they avert, avoid, bury, and forget. The real artist keeps looking, never blinking, and really examines everything, even death, until they find or make something truly profound.

I have my photo students watch this, and at first they are creeped out. Eventually they come around and love it too. Every time I watch it, I see something else that the film maker did, subtle but great transitions and cuts that add layers of meaning. Totally worth buying.",1266624000,5,884,4.525
3354130,5,B0013UQUQE,"Sally Mann is one of my art heroes.  Mann approaches relatively simple subject matter (such as landscapes, her family & death) & makes them profound through exploration & representation.  Mann sees these subjects through a lens (literally & metaphorically) which compels the viewer to reevaluate meaning and thus, hopefully, to grow psychologically and emotionally.  In my eyes, this is the ultimate purpose of art.

This documentary presents Sally Mann & her family in intimate terms.  The viewer gets a good feeling for whom she is, what motivates her and her style of working process. I highly recommend this for any photographer/artist whom is interested in pushing the limits of their own arts.",1241740800,2,699,5.205357142857143
3354131,5,B0013UQUQE,"Sally Mann is one of the most important photographers of our time, and this dvd is essential to understanding her work as an artist. This dvd deserves 6 stars because in the extras it includes the 30 minute oscar nominated documentary ""Blood Ties"" that aired on HBO in the early 90's during the ""Immediate Family"" photos. As well as the new full length doc that takes you through the ""What Remains"" era and how that concept unfolded from her husbands illness, into the death of her dog, into the suicide of a prisoner on her farm, into the civil war landscapes, into the photos of decaying bodies, into the photos of her children. She really challenges all of our concepts and fears of the subject of death and breaks it down to a beautiful idea of a natural process. I really can't say enough about how important her work is, but this dvd will. All i can say is this is worth your time and money.",1239840000,16,897,4.409638554216867

8253046,4,B0013UQUQE,"I have always been a fan of Sally Mann's earlier work, the truth and confrontation of her images and the emotions they instill in those who view them.  What Remains pushes that truth even further into the uncomfortable subject of death and decay in a ""wabi-sabi"" sort of way.  I gave it 4 stars and not 5 as I thought I could be more powerful, but not sure in what way, I just felt ""something"" was missing, but still a film worth watching for any artist or Sally Mann fan.",1485561600,,472,4.233333333333333
