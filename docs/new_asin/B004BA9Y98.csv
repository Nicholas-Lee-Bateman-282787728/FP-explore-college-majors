8421817,4,B004BA9Y98,"One of the earliest shows I remember enjoying as a youngster, which makes it fun to see again, but B grade acting, C grade writing, and D grade special effects. However, some of the ideas were copied by Star Trek and Star Wars, so I'll give the writer credit for imagination. Some of the original commercials were included, which was fun too, but thankfully not too many times.

Four shows, each nearly a half-hour long: BIG WHEEL NAMED FERRIS; MAN SLAVES OF CYDONIA; THE WILD MEN OF PROCYON; THE MARTIAN TOTEM HEAD. Audio pretty bad, but video clarity better than expected - some thin black lines at times and editing a bit choppy. Overall, pretty good considering the source, as another reviewer wrote.  Format DVD-R from Grapevine Video via Amazon.",1348358400,3,751,4.769230769230769
