8107112,2,B000E8LQUQ,"Murder By Television, 1935 film

The film begins with articles on building a television receiver for ""ultra short wave"". A corporation must fight to hold its position against the competition. An ""employee at large"" is paid to get results. [Industrial espionage?] Television has tremendous importance for the future. ""Clever these Chinese."" Will television benefit humanity? [It depends on its use.] Mr. Mendoza represents a very powerful group, they do not want the tests to go forward. TV signals are transmitted from White Plains NY. They show Paris and London, then China. [Using low bandwidth telephone lines or short wave radio?] Then Mr. Houghland yells and falls; he is dead! Did someone sneak in or out of the house? Where is the critical tube from the television sender? Somebody broke into the safe in a bedroom and stole the secret papers.

One scientist has a machine that tests a person's brain for faults. One man asks if Houghland was murdered, he has a clue. But Perry is also found dead. There are strange things in the dark night. Did they see a ghost? We meet a Federal Investigator. Can a telephone call cause a death? Yes, it's a ""death ray""! Foreign governments want this invention. The guilty man made a mistake and is identified. ""The eyes can see but the mind won't believe.""

Most people are unaware of the pre-war history of television in the 1930s. This is low-budget film that shows what Bela Lugosi did in movies after ""Dracula"". He was a very good actor who was handicapped by his accent except when he played a foreigner (""Ninotchka""). Was he as typecast as Basil Rathbone?",1270512000,,1605,4.829090909090909
