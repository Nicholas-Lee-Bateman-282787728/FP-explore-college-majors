1268094,5,B00003CXAI,"This may be the spookiest film ever made. No, I don't mean spooky in the sense of a bunch of teenagers getting hacked up at camp - I mean DOWNRIGHT CREEPY. Filmed in glorious black and white and with the perfect cast this  film hits the ground running (Robert Wise's voiceover:""Hill House has  stood for ninety years..."") and never lets up. There are a ton of  great lines (""No one will come...in the night...in the dark."")  and memorable scenes (The ""hand holding"" scene remains a  high-water mark in Horror films). I'll refrain from using the term  ""Thinking man's horror"" because this film is just too much fun to  fall into that category. Buy it & watch it this, and every, Halloween.",960422400,,688,4.636363636363637
1268095,5,B00003CXAI,"Robert Wise topped himself with this chilling, atmospheric masterpiece.  If you like slumbering, creepy haunted house movies this should be on your list.",955929600,,153,5.6521739130434785
1268163,5,B00003CXAI,"The original motion picture version of The Haunting is much closer to the classic short story by Shirley Jackson. An excellent, and very scary, film. As the best films have always proved, no blood or guts were necessary to give you a good fright. Buy it.",1014508800,,254,4.543478260869565
1268164,1,B00003CXAI,"I am always at a loss to understand why so many horror movie afficianados love this movie? I saw the newer one 1st & listened to numerous reviews stating that the original was so much better. Fortunately, it came on AMC one night, because i would have been very angry had I paid a rental fee for this snooze fest! I didn't find this film the least bit creepy. I actually found it almost silly. I was bored throughout, waiting patiently for SOMETHING to happen, but it never did. The lead characters are more lifeless than the supposed spooks. The atmosphere was hardly eerie & the effects, what few there were, were lame. As I said, I'm mystified why so many so called authorities on horror love this flick, but i'd leave it on the shelf & wait for it to come back on cable before you shell out a few bucks at blockbuster! Rent the new version! At least the special effects will keep you entertained.",1011312000,5,900,4.395209580838324
1268165,5,B00003CXAI,"This is the definitive ghost/horror movie and is an example of excellence that all ghost/horror movie makers should strive for. A wonderful close adaption of the Shirley Jackson story, this is no gory blood/slasher hack-em-up film or special effects blood bath. It is simply one of the scariest films I have ever seen. Spooky noises, cold spots in the house, a breathing door that almost frightened me out of my wits! A particular scene where Julie Harris and Claire Bloom are very frightened and holding hands in a dark room while ""something or someone"" is trying the door, only to find that they were on opposite sides of the room! Julie Harris' comment was, ""then who was holding my hand?"" I have seen this film dozens of times, and each time it still makes the hair on the back of my neck rise. Not a movie to watch late at night by oneself! This, and ""The Uninvited"" are two of the best ghost story movies of all time.",1011139200,2,923,4.5
1268166,5,B00003CXAI,"This is a masterpiece unlike the over teched new version.
(...) Robert Wise(genius) knows how to use imagination of the viewer to extreme.
The setting really is in England and the Music is everything.
No Color Needed with this work of art. Everytime you watch it
again you pick up more storyline that you missed the last time.",1006992000,,326,4.637931034482759
1268167,5,B00003CXAI,"This movie is a must-buy for fans of a good haunted house / ghost story.  I think that it is, perhaps, the BEST haunted house movie that I have ever seen.  It's a kick to watch the movie in complete darkness.  But don't watch it by yourself, unless your very brave, or unless you like to be scared witless!  This version beats the remake HANDS-DOWN!!!",1006732800,,351,4.3538461538461535
1268168,5,B00003CXAI,"Read the earlier reviews than mine.  They say just about all that needs to be said.  One of the best movies ever made.
Unlike any other version of this story that I've seen - this is the one that leaves you with the question 'Was it all in her head?'",1003449600,2,250,3.98
1268169,5,B00003CXAI,"For a long time now, I have searched for a movie to scare me as much as ""The Omen"" did when I was 13, and I've finally found it. And the reason it get's top rating from me is not only because it were scary, it's superb directed as well. Astonishing effects for its time too.  This movie is a ""must"" for every horror-film collector. don't even doubt getting it, you won't regret it. PS: Stay clear of the '99 remake, that movie is awfull and a disgrace to the '63 version. Not to mention the book.",984614400,2,496,4.11340206185567
1268170,5,B00003CXAI,"I first saw Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"" on TV in the late '60s, along with my 2 sisters. We were chilled to the bone! My sister and I still love this film-it sends out enough information, and then lets your imagination take over-no one can frighten you as badly as you can yourself! Robert Wise got his apprenticeship at RKO in the early 1940s, where the Val Lewton-produced thrillers such as ""The Cat People"", ""I Walked With a Zombie"" and ""The Body Snatcher"" were made. These films chilled you because they DIDN'T ""Show you everything"".  He utilized these skills to perfection in ""The Haunting"", where its bedeviled heroine is the prime target of the house's malevolance.  The 1999 remake was, in my opinion, a garish, shrill, heavy-handed cartoon, and that maudlin ""explanation"" about the ""exploited"" children (which has nothing to do with the book or original film) was embarassingly naive. I'm so tired of all these ""Poltergeist"" wannabe films! I have been in some bizarrely decorated abodes, such as the Sir John Soane Museum in London, but NOBODY'S home looks like the laughably over-decorated, over-scaled house in the remake. The house looked like it was decorated for a 50-foot Liberace! The characters just cardboard cutouts (a waste of a talented cast), but there was eye-candy in the luscious Catherine Zeta-Jones. Now, when is the 1963 ""The Haunting"" going to be released on DVD?",976233600,2,1393,4.9742489270386265
1268171,5,B00003CXAI,"Simply the most understated, yet powerful Horror Movie of all time.when Julie Harris has her hand held...when the walls thunder and you can see your breath, make sure you don't watch it alone!",971568000,,192,4.848484848484849
7917421,5,B00003CXAI,"I noticed that the original, ""The Haunting"" is going to be released, but noticed it might be coming out in full screen.
This is one movie that should be released in it's aspect ratio
of 2.35, you would lose so much of the atmosphere to it.
It came out in laser in 2.35 and should in DVD, or at least give the option on the other side of disc.
Can you please suggest this  to Warner Brothers who are releasing it.  Thanks a lot.
I think a lot of people will be disappointed if it only comes full frame.",1051228800,,501,4.05050505050505
7917422,5,B00003CXAI,"I sat down to watch The Hauting on TCM last night, wondering if I really wanted to watch this for about the 75th time. I am very glad I did, because the print they showed was utterly spectacular. I see from the site the DVD is not available, but this version almost certainly was a DVD. In any case it was like watching the movie for this first time, and what a pleasure that was.
It was an incredible wide screen cinemascope view, razor sharp with superb sound. The lighting and black and white photography were absolutely stunning. The sound was excellent; I heard sounds I have never heard before.
Robert Osbourne, in his introduction, revealed that Robert Wise used a lens that introduced a slight distortion to the entire movie. Indeed, the entire film had a slightly ""off"" look that was rather disorienting, in keeping with the nature of the house!
Throughtout this screening, all my attention was on the incredible cinematography of this movie. Only know do I really see this movie for the masterpiece it is - I thought I already knew. I didn't think I could be scared by this movie after so many years, but I actually was.
If you haven't seen The Haunting you are missing the best ""haunted house"" story ever made. And if you haven't seen this version, you still haven't seen it. Can anyone enlighten me about what prints/DVD versions may be available for purchase or rent?",1033689600,4,1380,4.6138211382113825
7917423,5,B00003CXAI,"Robert Wise's 1962 film ""The Haunting"" is simply the best, most riveting haunted-house drama ever filmed.  Superb performances by Claire Bloom, Julie Harris, and Russ Tamblyn, as well as an utterly marvelous supporting cast, make this film the one all others should emulate.
 Based on a masterful short story by Shirley Jackson, the actions takes place at an old New England mansion (although the film was made in England, and a sharp viewer can catch that).  The leading character, Nell, is tormented by her past and we have access to her thoughts throughout as the tension continues to build.
  The settings are excellently done.  When is the last time you encountered a silver toast server-rack, in which the slices are stacked vertically to keep them crisp?  I viewed this movie a second time just to enjoy all the ""perfect touches"" like this one.
  If you are a fan of the suspense/psychological thriller, don't miss out on this one!  Robert Wise's 1962 production is by far the best, so don't be fooled by others of the same name.  Five enthusiastic stars!",1029974400,7,1062,4.844444444444444
7917424,5,B00003CXAI,"Psychic spinster Eleanor Vance (Julie Harris) is invited to spend a weekend in America's most notorious haunted house, Hill House, to share her feelings and observations in a study being conducted there by parapsychologist Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson).  Along for the ride are lesbian psychic Theodora (Claire Bloom) and alcoholic Hill House heir Russ Tamblyn, who are later joined by Markway's unwisely headstrong wife (Lois Maxwell).  Eleanor's recent history eerily echoes that of the house's last tenant, and over the group's stay, the house seems to progressively more insistently extend an invitation for Eleanor to become one of its more permanent residents...
This movie is flawless.  Robert Wise's direction is sure and steady, making the most of light and shadow and sound effects, utilizing them to create an unbearably tense atmosphere of terrifying expectancy.  He makes the house itself the central star of the story, filming it from cockeyed angles that make it appear to be voyeuristically watching its occupants, throughout.  Nelson Gidding's adaptation of Shirley Jackson's famous novel streamlines it to maximum dramatic effect, and the music score is haunting and downright unsettling.  The actors are fabulous, and the action and suspense never flag for a second.
Simply the best  -  don't miss it.",1029974400,12,1320,5.404878048780488
7917425,4,B00003CXAI,"This is a far superior version than its remake.  It shows a woman tormented by what she believes to be an insignificant life until the death of her mother.  Then she is touched by an inspiration which brings her to an old mansion where she feels adventurous and welcome.  The house gives her life purpose and comfort.  She is finally consumed by the spirit of the house.  I found this much more ""haunting"" than the modern version which tried to put an involved story with and ending to something which needed no ending; and in fact would not have had a Hollywood ending in real life.",1029888000,,583,4.462264150943396
7917426,5,B00003CXAI,"This is my all time favorite ghost story, and like a good Hitchcock thriller, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, and jumping at every bump in the night until it's over.  Julie Harris is excellent as Eleanor!  The movie stays true to the novel, and the black and white film keeps it edgy and completely spooky!",1029110400,,313,4.288135593220339
7917427,5,B00003CXAI,"With much anticipation, I went to see the remake of this classic horror flick, and came away feeling that they had ruined such a great movie for all that had not experienced the original. Such classic scenes as when Elinor experiences the tremendous squeezing of her hand from an unknown hand assailant, and the explanation of the reason why the House is sooooo bad are just lost in the techno fun house remake. Please release this fine classic on DVD!!!  I'm Waiting...........",1029024000,,478,4.829268292682927
7917428,5,B00003CXAI,"I saw the movie back in the 70's, bought the book, read other
S. Jackson stories, bought the VHS, saw it over and over.  The
only thing that better the experience of ""The Haunting"" is if
it will come out in DVD in widescreen format.",1027123200,,232,4.155555555555556
7917429,5,B00003CXAI,"Of all the films ever made about ghosts and haunted houses, The Haunting directed by Robert Wise (1963)is unsurpassed and I recommend this film highly.  I'd be the first in line to buy this film on dvd!  I can't get enough of this beautifully directed classic and I can't say enough great things about this wonderful film.",1020297600,,322,4.631578947368421
7917430,5,B00003CXAI,"ALTHOUGH THIS MOVIE IS NOT YET AVAILABLE ON DVD, IT NEEDS TO BE.  THIS IS THE ULTIMATE IN HAUNTED HOUSE MOVIES.  IT HAS ALL THE RIGHT INGREDIENTS; CAST, MOOD, ATMOSPHERE, AND THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF FEAR.  THIS MOVIE SET THE STANDARD FOR FUTURE HAUNTED ABODE MOVIES (""THE SHINING"", ETC.) AND PROVES THE ADAGE THAT LESS IS MORE.",1019606400,,323,4.631578947368421
