2081341,5,B0002EJ7JY,"One of my favorite shows of all time! I grew up watching Saved by the Bell and have always loved the show. I found it to be so relatable and so enjoyable and even though the college years are not like the earlier seasons---this one was a regroup later after the show stopped airing---it was still enjoyable to watch. It doesnt have Lisa, although she makes a cameo, and Jessie is also not present but I love that they didn't neglect mentioning them. I loved some of the drama and how they get themselves out of the predicaments. I am a college administrator and it is such an embellished view of college life but so enjoyable to watch and laugh about!",1469577600,2,651,4.3884297520661155

2081370,5,B0002EJ7JY,This show is just a little more mature than the original saved by the bell series. Shows great college life with not too much drama with (SBTB) style and humor. Plus a treat for die hard (SBTB) fans we get to see Zack and Kelly get engaged!!,1373500800,,241,4.148936170212766

I would've wanted to see more of the college years!! But I also got the two movies so that fills the gap. I have all the SBTB seasons in my collection!!!

2081380,4,B0002EJ7JY,If you want to watch good corny tv shows this is one of the best. Makes you miss the days of TGIF programming.,1340323200,,110,3.8260869565217392
2081381,5,B0002EJ7JY,"Ok, I know many people, including myself, are skeptical about spending roughly $70 on this single season of Saved by the Bell.  I had previously purchased seasons 1-5 and the 2 movies on DVD, all for less than this single season.  I watched all the seasons and both the movies, but when I got done, I felt uneasy about the gap between the end of their high school days and the wedding between Zack and Kelly.  Then, MTV2 starting showing re-runs of this season and I got hooked watching them.  Many other reviews trash this season because many of the original characters like Kelly, Zack, Screech, and even Slater, drastically changed upon starting their college career.  After having been in college myself for 2 years now, I do not see how anyone would not change upon entering college life.  All the characters mature over the 18 episodes and come out with a better grasp on life and the ability to distinguish what is really important.

As for the product itself, I can almost guarantee you that you will not find a brand new, still sealed copy of this season because it went out of print in late 2010.  Of the few used copies that are out there, the typical price you will pay is $70-$80, with a slight chance of finding one cheaper.  So, if you are a true Saved by the Bell fan, or am looking to add to your DVD collection, I highly recommend this set.  Who knows, maybe sometime in the future you will decide to sell this DVD set, and it will be worth even more at that point in time.",1338768000,3,1491,4.389090909090909
2081382,5,B0002EJ7JY,We have some  new chactors but we still have Zach Kelly Slater and Screech and that makes for a good show. Halfwayway through the one and only season Zach and Kelly got back together althouth it took a crush on a youthfull  or at least a youthfull looking professer to do it. That was tghe biggest and only mistake Saved By the Bell made. Other good things happened in this show too and youll be sorry and disappointed if you don't get it.,1338163200,,439,4.27710843373494
2081383,3,B0002EJ7JY,Don't get me wrong...I love Saved by the Bell. I have all of the seasons minus the College Years and that's because I can't find it for a good price. Why would anyone want to buy one season for over $40 or $50? Amazon has this season on instant video for a normal price. I'm just buying that. Ridiculous!,1323993600,4,304,4.169491525423729
2081384,3,B0002EJ7JY,"We bought the college season (used from a third party amazon seller) to add to our Saved by the Bell dvd collection. The college years are okay, but just not as good as I remember. But if you are like me,vans want the entire SBTB collection, then buy it. It's definitely worth watching for memories.",1305590400,,299,4.454545454545454
2081385,5,B0002EJ7JY,"I was just a couple years younger than Zach when I started watching these shows. I was born in 85 and started watching the shows around 94. I think. I always felt so much older and this is definitely the show to encourage your children to watch if they tend to hang in the older crowds too. Even though, corny at times, looking back, these shows provided great entertainment for teenagers supported by morals and lessons to be learned. Of course as children we didn't think about the lessons we we're taught, rather, just watched the show because we could relate to them. I will most definitely be encouraging my kids to watch them when they are 10-20 yrs old. These shows are great for any ages however. I could go on and on about how much I loved having this show apart of my life...I only wish the college years continued. It would have been great to see a ""career years,"" where the gang is experiencing their lives as young adults. Next, I plan to check out the new class. I would not be interested if it weren't for Screech and Mr. Belding playing in these series as well. I encourage all to watch!!!",1262476800,,1105,4.3951219512195125

2081390,5,B0002EJ7JY,"The guys are back, Zack, Screech, and Slater...Kelly as well.  Lisa and Jessie are gone, but this doesnt' slow down the new series.  No more HS and now into college, where they are all at square one and learn it the hard way.  A great short lived show, that had you laughing in a different environment.  Had some guest appearances as well from other celebs...i suggest get the Wedding in Vegas/Hawaii movie to cap this set off!",1220227200,,427,4.5064935064935066

Now that I'm 25 and I had the chance of watching it in the original version, I can't help loving it even more: amazing cast, funny stories, catchy songs...what more can you ask to a tv show?

Thank you, Amazon, for giving me the opportunity of affording to buy the whole collection! <3",1208217600,2,368,4.183098591549296

We want Miss Bliss and Zack's original dad and the original Slater what was that curly-haired guys name?  Tifani amber thieson ruined this show that names sounds more like a porn star name.,1157068800,,301,4.622641509433962

2081403,4,B0002EJ7JY,"As good as this 1st Season of Saved By The Bell, The College Years happens to be, what bothers me is that the viewers are left hanging at the end of the 1st Season.  Zack is going to ask Kelly to marry him and Kelly excepts Zacks marrage proposal and they get married.  The only problem is that all of this and alot more occures within the 2nd Season, and they haven't yet come out with this one on to DVD, why not?  I'm still awaiting for this one to come out on to DVD;  Once the 2nd and Finial Season comes out, then I will have the entire Series of Saved By The Bell; begining with when they were in High School, and then moving onto College.  Other then that, I consider this show to being very good as well as Educational, uplifting and well done, despite the fact that the Company making up these DVD Disks had elimanated a number of eposoides from the very begining of the series from when they were back in High School!",1151193600,4,928,4.162011173184357
2081404,3,B0002EJ7JY,"First of all, I do enjoy watching this dvd...I have been a fan of SBTB since Miss Bliss, and really liked each character..its like Lark Vorhiees says on the SBTB 3 & 4 seasons commentary, they all had great chemistry.  They were an ensemble that really worked!

To me, this dvd is what it would be like if Seinfeld did a show where only Jerry and Elaine moved somewhere, left George and Kramer behind, and met new friends. Then, change elements about Jerry and Elaine that people enjoyed, and that is what the College Years are to me...

As mentioned, Kelly is different-nothing like Kelly Kapowski from Bayside...I know people change, but I don't see any sort of similarity! Different hair, different style choices, different acting person...it is just weird!!

Slater's niche is also taken away-he was the jock, and now falls to low status at the school..I know he is a new freshman, but...that takes away part of who his character was! Also, as mentioned, he is paired with Alex, who seems odd, and she doesn't have near the amount of charm as Elizabeth Berkley!

There is more to say, but I don't want to bore (too much!) I am just pointing out that if you have not seen SBTB The College Years, and expect it to be just like Bayside and the kids there, you are in for a surprise! This doesn't make it a BAD show, but I was shocked to see the differences in these two shows...I thought that after not seeing the College Years since I was about 12, that these episodes would seem different to me now that I am older, but now I notice the differences all the more!

I would recommend this dvd if you saw and liked The College Years originally, or are a Saved By The Bell collector (like myself)...otherwise, if you haven't seen the show, I would rent it (if possible!)",1142985600,20,1769,4.478260869565218
2081405,4,B0002EJ7JY,"This series on DVD is as good as can be expected for an SBTB.  However, the college years were a bit more realistic in that these kids grew up and stopped making everything positive.  In one episode where they throw a rave, Slater tells Screech (finally, someone said something!) that he is acting like an idiot and it is not 'ok' to do so as it was back in Bayside.  Otherwise, the set is nicely laid out with 3 DVDs, it could always use a bit more in the way of extras, but I do not think that there are too mnay extras to be shared.

The show had more adult-like themes and a more adult-like feel, except for the idiot, Screech (Dustin Diamond) who should hang his head in shame for ruining most of the sophistication (I use this word loosely) of The College Years.  They should have dropped him for other characters.  Anyway,if you are looking for some relaxed, low-key predictable humor...go for it.

I was shocked at how much my six and four year olds enjoyed some of the episodes...they, too, think Screech is a fool!",1140912000,,1024,4.386243386243386
2081406,5,B0002EJ7JY,"Well! actually my friend bought me Saved By The Bell The College Years Season 1 and Wedding In Las Vegas from AMAZON.CO.UK. I actually bought Season 5 end of last year by another friend. After watching it, I was addicted and after knowing that Zack And Kelly will fall in love all over again and marry, I was desperately wanting to buy The College Years and Wedding In Las Vegas as they are really a cute couple. Tiffani looks so hot, cute and sexy as well as smart playing Kelly and Paul aka Zack is really a Down To Earth guy as eventhough he might be playful, he still have MORAL VALUES which is lacking in most of Teen TV Series now these days. During the last moments of Wedding In Las Vegas, I was so touch when Zack and Kelly look at each other at their wedding, they started to think of all the sweet memories they had together in Junior High School until they are in College. It really make me cry!! They are really High School sweethearts meant to be together. Boy! I wish I would have that kind of girl when I was in Junior High Or High School. This is really a true Romantic yet very funny TV Series and I really ""LOVE"" the ending compared to ""DAWSON'S CREEK"" which had such DISAPPOINITNG ending and Dawson DIDN'T get to be with Joey. It is the ULTIMATE Favourite TV Series beside BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER which is my all time favourite as I grow up in High School following this show. Thank to NBC , PETER ENGEL and the crews of Saved By The Bell for giving such another great TV Series of all time!!",1140393600,2,1513,4.2387543252595155
2081407,5,B0002EJ7JY,"I can't believe I was in the 6th grade this lone season aired, but getting off of me. I am glad they released this on DVD, and I watch at least an episode or two of Saved by the Bell before I go to bed. I think there should have been extra features on this, such as 'Where Are They Now?'. We all know what Mario, Tiffani, Screech, and Mark-Paul are doing now but what about the drama chick, Leslie and Rogers? I'm sure there are websites about them somewhere but I think since this was aired in primetime NBC should have put some TV promotions or at least something to spice this up. Otherwise you'll enjoy the incomplete college story of the former Bayside guys and Kelly.",1122854400,,673,4.265625
2081408,5,B0002EJ7JY,"I think I might be the only Saved by the Bell fan to say this, but I think I may like this more than the original SBTB. I got the DVD two days ago and I have already watched every episode. I really wished they would have kept making more episodes. I hope every Saved by the Bell fan gets this.",1121040000,2,293,3.819672131147541
2081409,4,B0002EJ7JY,"In many ways more unintentionally funny than the originals because it strives with all of its might to be a more ""grown up"" kind of show. It ultimately fails at this and is also weighted down by massive amounts of cheese (""The Rave""...the whole Lassky and Kelly and Zack love triangle) but is well worth the cost if you are a fan of the original series (for all of the wrong reasons and some of the right ones) This set gets a definite recommendation.",1120176000,,451,4.380952380952381
2081410,5,B0002EJ7JY,"When i was in school & college the original saved by the bell was on tv, when i went to university, so did the gang from saved by the bell. I guess that's what makes this series so special, you, like them, grow up. In the college years you see them go off, and encounter the ups and downs of college life (although none of my mates or girlfriends where ever as attractive as this lot!)

There was only one series of College years, maybe because the first few episodes where, well, not the best. However as the season continues the cast settle in and the show improves.

Fluffy fun for rainy days!",1116979200,2,596,4.265486725663717
2081411,4,B0002EJ7JY,"I am a huge Saved by the Bell fan. I watched it as a kid every day when I got home. I also loved the College Years as well. Now, the original gang was better than the College gang, but there are still many entertaining moments in the college years. I, for one, feel that the college years was cut way too short and thought it should have continued. I guess others didn't feel the same way though. Zack, Slater, and Screech are very entertaining in the college years and Leslie, Alex, and Kelly are good assets to the show. The theme of Zack still chasing Kelly never gets old and continues in the DVD set. If you are a fan of Saved by the Bell, I suggest the College Years to you. It's not as good as the younger years, but it's still filled with many great things that make this a great addition to your collection.",1110412800,,816,4.170886075949367
2081412,4,B0002EJ7JY,"Maybe I'm partial to the series because Zack (Mark-Paul Gosselaar)and myself are about the same age and I grew up with him during the 1st series too during my high school years. But now as I look back, I can't believe how stupid the shows actually were. Notice how the show was always recorded in the same hallway, the same people were always together, the principal was nothing short of a moron, and the stories were as realistic as Elvis being alive.

The College Years, while the critics may say otherwise, is clearly better than the high school episodes. Maybe it's because ""I was in college during the ""College Years"" but they really seem more entertaining to me and is definitely fun to watch if you're fan of no-brainer nonsense entertainment like me. Saved by the Bell is about ""stupid"" plotlines and loop holes of stories that really don't make sense, and that is what makes them fun.

Although shortlived, the series was unlike it's high school counterpart. Alot has changed since Bayside. How convenient that Slater, Kelly, Zack and Screech all end up in the same dorm room together. Once again ""unrealistic craziness"" that the show survives on.  Too bad Lisa Turtle (Lark Voorhies) and Jessica Spano (Elisebeth Berkley) couldn't make it back, although lark does make a cameo toward the end of the series. ""Berkley was too busy taking her clothes off for the grammy award winning movie ""ShowGirls"". The series basically brings back Zack's non-sensical antics to college life at California Univeristy. Towards the end the story, the series focuses back on Zack and Kelly falling in love and then eventually talking about getting married. AC-Slater (Mario Lopez) really shines during the series and shows his fine acting abilities in a ""silly"" but sometimes serious way. Some newbie (nobodies) come around for the show and help it along the way too. Mark-Paul Gosselaar and the conflicts of college life really made me laugh throughout every episode. Every  tongue and cheek cliche' and trick to make 30 minutes go by is used up on every episode. Screech still ruins of the episodes better moments when the unrealistic feel of the show is brought out almost to the point of being absurd, but Zack, Slater and Kelly seem to keep the show at bay. It's too bad the show was cut, because some of the last episodes were getting a bit more serious and believable and I wanted more.

Saved By The Bell: The College Years is a good DVD buy and people  who are like me, will watch it over and over, we just don't know why we watch it?",1105920000,32,2534,4.721719457013575
2081413,4,B0002EJ7JY,"You don't have to wait on pins and needles to find out whether they're ever going to release the Wedding in Las Vegas (Final episode/Movie), or the Hawian style movie either. We have them over here in England for dirt cheap. You can find them in a box set which includes three random episodes aswell, and I would reccomend it whether you have the episodes or not, because it's cheaper to buy the set than to buy the movies seperately.

It's about 11:99 in pounds. So it's around $20.

2081414,5,B0002EJ7JY,"This show is not looked upon favorably by some of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saved-by-the-Bell/dp/B00ELKDDWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saved by the Bell</a>&nbsp;aficionados because of all of the changes that were made.  Zack is no longer top dog on campus, Kelly is is not so much sweet as she is sassy, Slater struggles to win wrestling matches, while Jesse & Lisa's replacements are not as well-defined.  Despite these differences, the show still manages to make the audience care for the struggles of four familiar characters (and some new ones) as they adjust to college life.  This series will undoubtedly hold a greater fondness for those who remember life in dorms, campus get-togethers with friends, and those boring professors who seem to make a lot more sense after college.  Granted, relationships on this show still never go beyond kissing, but the gang seems just as preoccupied with trying to prove that they are ready for adulthood.

As the series progresses, so do the characters, which is not something that could be said of the original series.  Even though there were only 19 episodes, it was clear that each character was evolving and finding their particular niche in the social rung of society (as defined by college standards at least).  This is not to say that the students did not get into a fair share of trouble with the resident authority figure played by Bob Golic.  While he lacks the sweet gullibility of Mr. Belding, Golic still succeeds in walking that fine line between mentor and friend.

This DVD set does not include any bonus features, although there are chapter stops for every episode enabling the viewer to skip to certain scenes (a basic feature lacking in the previous SBTB releases).  The 90 minute&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wedding-In-Las-Vegas/dp/B000QUEQ4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wedding In Las Vegas</a>&nbsp;movie, which concluded the show's plotlines is available separately on DVD.  Overall, this is a great series that holds up much better in hindsight.  The words to the opening theme song summed up this series best, ""I'm standing at the edge of tomorrow, and it's all up to me how far I go.""",1095984000,9,2262,5.524637681159421

2081416,4,B0002EJ7JY,I really like this DVD because of a hidden episode that you can access through a secret series of codes at the main screen. It has a hidden episode of where the gang decided to join a frat and Screech had to do some crazy stuff. It made me visibly excited to watch that episode.,1094688000,2,278,4.072727272727272
2081417,2,B0002EJ7JY,"I used to watch this show, yeah for like two episodes!

I remember seeing the first episode and thinking, man this show kind of sucks.  They should have Tiffini Amber-Thiesan's character Kelly on it, and what do you know, halfway through that first episode:  she appeared.

This show had Zack, Slater, Kelly, and that annoying Screech, other than that - all new people.  Well hey, it was a new TV show.  A spin-off.

Wasn't the R.A. on the show a former football player or something?  I don't recall.  Oh well.

I remember the final episode of this show, probably not on this set, was a lead-up to a TV movie where Zack and Kelly got married.

Anyways, enjoy this DVD, if you enjoyed the show",1094256000,2,692,4.456

The pilot is pretty good as we even see Zack and Slater in nothing but their boxers! Of course Jesse could not join them at Cal U. She was too busy in Vegas stripping at the Cheetah before landing a spot in the Stardust hotel's Goddess show. At least she did make it to Zack & Kelly's wedding and I think I even saw Cristal Connors hitting on Mr. Belding...or was it Leslie and Alex???",1092873600,,539,4.242718446601942

This is still a really good show and I am excited to get all of the Saved by the Bell series on DVD!  I am also hoping Good Morning Miss Bliss and the last season of the high school years, with Tori, come out soon.  Thanks for reading!",1092009600,2,498,4.082474226804123
2081421,4,B0002EJ7JY,"With the benefit of age, I now cringe at most of the STB empire (and wonder what we were on in the 1980's for throwing our time and money at it) but still like the short-lived college years. It is a shame the uneducated will continue lumping in the earlier efforts with this product, because it is vastly superior.
Finally graduated from Bayside, Zack, Kelly, Slater, and Screech all end up going to the fictional California University. Residing together in the world's cleanest dorm (sorry, these buildings are not actually that spotless) they meet new friends Leslie Burke (Anne Tremko) and Alex Taber (Kiersten Warren) and their goofy 'non traditional' RA Mike Rogers (Bob Golic) who is always around to dispense advice and the mild rebuke because Zack has not grown out of his scheming ways.
Gosslear and Diamond especially look genuinely happy to have worked on this series. Having been in all of the incarnations of the STB empire, they've definently worked through cheese in the past. The now relaxed presentation of both actors makes each episode very enjoyable and akin to really soothing lip balm.
Overall, I like this series much better than other teen shows 'college' efforts (oh....90210 comes to mind!) because the students actually go to classes, study, and are stressed about the above activities while trying to juggle a social life. Plus, even though they came from fairly posh homes, the rigors of college life quickly encourage these same students to adopt very casual oulfits.
Again, the only concern is that each scene looks too spotless to actually take place in a 'big name' university. The students would not have time to keep their dorm that spotless if they were actually experiencing the frazzled nerves in the season.",1088899200,7,1746,4.962457337883959
