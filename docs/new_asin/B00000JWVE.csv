8299497,4,B00000JWVE,"Movie for Kids.  I don't usually like to look at comedy movies alone but, for a Frankenstein movie collector, I enjoyed that one.  The people are just foolish enough.  As usual, anyone related to the Frankenstein family  want to hide their identity, which leads to some funny situations.  And the  classic encounter with the blind man is going worst than in ""Young  Frankenstein"".  Enjoy the movie.  The Frankenstein castle is there to  stay.",961718400,2,442,4.931506849315069
