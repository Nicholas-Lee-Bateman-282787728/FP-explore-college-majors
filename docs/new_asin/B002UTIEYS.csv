8381522,4,B002UTIEYS,"This is a 2-DVD set. It is in Chinese with English subtitles. The subtitles are occasionally misspelled or use incorrect words, but overall its ok. Master Wang Ping is quite skilled (look up ""WuDang BaguaZhang"" on youtube to see the routine that is recorded on the DVD).

It is important to understand that this set does not teach bagua, it teaches Wudang bagua. That is, it does not teach some of the key fundamentals of bagua - it is presumed that the viewer has learned them elsewhere.  For example, mud-wading step is mentioned, but not really described or taught. Some good books to include for self-study are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Liang-Zhen-Pu-Eight-Diagram-Palm/dp/1883175003/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Liang Zhen Pu Eight Diagram Palm</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lion-Shape-Baguazhang/dp/1517321530/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lion Shape Baguazhang</a>.

With that said, the first DVD is very good. He patiently and in detail describes and demonstrates an 8-posture stepping exercise, where the hands are held in a fixed posture around the circle several times, and then are reversed while walking the circle in the other direction several times, then the process is repeated for the next posture and so on. This exercise is itself quite good for building up basic leg and arm strength, and I find that completing 10 circles for each posture in both directions (so walking the circle 160 times total) takes roughly a half-hour, so its a good little workout with a very small space requirement. (Adding wrist and/or ankle weights can also be useful once one has the basic strength covered.) The latter half of the DVD moves from holding the arms fixed to hand-circling exercises, each one based on the corresponding fixed arm posture in the first exercise. Also, a very good workout for the shoulders, although it takes a while to get coordination in some of the circling methods while maintaining good stepping.

The second DVD, however, jumps up quite a bit in difficulty. It is broken into 8 sections, each one comprising fairly dense and complex movements and palm changes of around 30 seconds each. Either the DVD could have been longer or there should have been a third DVD because the instruction is rushed, and I find it hard to follow, since the breakdown of each section is not repeated as much, or as slowly, as I think would be useful. Sometimes he even says ""...and just do the same pattern in the other direction..."" without demonstrating it.

Finally, after all of this, the routine which he performs on the DVD (and which I referred you to on youtube) is NOT taught on the DVD. That's right. After the 8th and final segment of palm changes is is shown, that's the end of the second DVD. Now, in a sense, it is in the essence of bagua that movements are constantly changing and so a fixed routine might be considered to impede the student, who instead must learn on their own to transition dynamically and spontaneously from one set of movements to another in no particular order. Or, it might be that they just didn't have the desire or the budget to go to a third DVD! In any case, its an important point to know.

Even if you buy it just for the first DVD's exercises, I think it will be worthwhile.",1523750400,,3337,5.136279926335175
