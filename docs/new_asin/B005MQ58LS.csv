4834955,5,B005MQ58LS,"Standing by their word that all 6 seasons of the beloved 1960's sitcom ""The Lucy Show"" would become available in its entirety, CBS/Paramount has just announced ""The Lucy Show-Season 5"" comes to DVD December 6, 2011 just in time for Christmas in a 4 disc set! This leaves just one more full season left before the entire library of ""Lucy Show"" episodes will be made available for posterity for legions of Lucille Ball fans to enjoy.

 Season 5 (1966-1967) finally gave Lucille Ball an Emmy win as Best Actress in a Comedy after three nominations. This would be followed yet by another win in ""The Lucy Show's"" final year.

 22 episodes were made and have been restored in pristine condition and are in beautiful color.  The rarely seen ""jack-in-the-box"" opening of this season is shown during the first 10 episodes. During the summer of 1966 Lucille Ball ordered that there be a new opening. When the series premiered, without seeing the opening beforehand, she was mortified and demanded the opening be dropped. It was. When ""The Lucy Show"" reaired the series' opener on CBS the regular, more popular opening was used. In subsequent reairings of the show in syndication the ""jack-in-the-box"" opening was never seen again. I have seen that opening and it is tacky, stupid, and simply tasteless.

 The bonuses so far that have been announced for Season 5 include the great ""Lucy in London"" special that aired on October 24th, 1966 featuring Anthony Newley and the Dave Clark Five, a new documentary on the series, and outtakes.

 Like ""I Love Lucy"", ""The Lucy Show"" never left the Nielsen Top 10 rated shows, and the fifth season came in at a very impressive #4!

 Guest-stars this season include George Burns, John Wayne, Carol Burnet, and the wonderful Vivian Vance makes an appearance.

 The following are the complete 22 episodes of ""The Lucy Show"" along with their original CBS airdates:

1. ""Lucy with George Burns"", Sept. 12, 1966
2. ""Lucy and the Submarine"", Spt. 19, 1966
3. ""Lucy the Bean Queen"", Sept. 26, 1966
4. ""Lucy and Paul Winchell"", Oct. 3, 1966
5. ""Lucy and the Ring-A-Ding Ring, Oct. 10, 1966
6. ""Lucy Flies To London"", Oct. 17, 1966 (This episode would serve as the starting off point for Lucy going to London and taping her TV special that aired the following week in ""The Lucy Show's"" timeslot).
7. ""Lucy Gets a Roomate"", Oct. 31, 1966
8. ""Lucy and Carol in Palm Springs, Nov. 7, 1966
9. ""Lucy Gets Caught Up in the Draft"", Nov. 14, 1966
10.""Lucy and John Wayne"", Nov. 21, 1966
11.""Lucy and Pat Collins"", Nov. 28, 1966
12.""Lucy and the Monkey"", Dec. 5, 1966
13.""Lucy and the Effiency Expert"", Dec. 12, 1966
14.""Lucy's Substitute Secretary"", Jan. 2, 1967
15.""Viv Visits Lucy"", Jan. 9, 1967
16.""Lucy the Babysitter"", Jan. 16, 1967
17.""Main Street U.S.A."", Jan. 23, 1967
18.""Lucy Puts Main Street on the Map"", Jan. 30, 1967
19.""Lucy Meets the Law"", Feb. 13, 1967
20.""Lucy the Fight Manager"", Feb. 20, 1967
21.""Lucy and Tennessee Ernie Ford"", Feb. 27, 1967
22.""Lucy Meets Sheldon Leonard"", March 6, 1967

 One more important note: many Lucile Ball fans already own many of these episodes that have been cheaply packaged over the years and the prints were down-right terrible. Trust me: buy this set and discard your old copies of these episodes because the one's that have been on the ""public domain"" and released time and time again were taken from cheap negatives, not the series' original prints like these have.",1315958400,26,3432,4.8013582342954155
4834956,4,B005MQ58LS,"I won't make this one of those lengthy reviews that include a full episode guide for the season, or detailed background information. I will say that the best thing about Season Five of ""The Lucy Show"" arriving on DVD is that it FINALLY renders all those terrible public domain releases obsolete!

If you already own all of those inferior releases and are asking why you should dump them and spring for this set here's the scoop. Every official CBS/Paramount release of ""The Lucy Show"" so far has featured eye-popping, beautifully restored prints and a bounty of bonus features and this one is no exception. (NOTE: See the screen grabs in the Images section of this product). The fact that the 1966 ""Lucy In London"" special will be included is reason enough. Even the infamous rare ""jack-in-the-box"" intro is here and it was aired only once and then replaced because Lucy hated it so much. My favorite of the bonus features is short and sweet: Lucy's 1967 Emmy win where she actually gets teary-eyed and thanks the voters by saying ""I love my work. Thank you for giving me this for it"". It's a great moment that speaks volumes about Lucy. Also short but hilarious is the blooper reel, worth watching to see Mary Wickes get accosted by a randy elephant!

I have to admit the script quality was still deteriorating at this point, but there are still a few keepers this season. Carol Burnett makes her first of many appearances on a Lucy series in a two-parter; there's a charming and memorable musical number in ""Main Street USA""; and best of all Vivian Vance returns in my favorite episode of the season. ""Viv Visits Lucy"" has the two donning psychadelic costumes and hitting Sunset Strip to rescue a wayward teenager. It's a hilarious script with many memorable lines and the two veterans knock every one of them out the park.

The rest of the season is hit-and-miss but CBS' fantastic presentation has always managed to allow these episodes to provide me with much more viewing pleasure than I thought they would.

Useless trivia: This is the season that Lucy won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a comedy series beating out Marlo Thomas, Elizabeth Montgomery and Agnes Moorehead.",1315958400,8,2193,4.7631578947368425
4834957,5,B005MQ58LS,"Season five of ""The Lucy Show"" is one of the best seasons.  ""The Lucy Show"" finished in fourth place in the Nielsen Ratings for the 1966-67 season with a 26.2 rating and 40% share of the audience.  It killed its' competition - ""The Roger Miller Show,"" ""Captain Nice"" and ""The Rat Patrol"".  It also marked Lucy's third Emmy nomination for ""The Lucy Show"" and a win for Best Actress In A Leading Role In A Comedy Series (1966-67).  The Emmy was long overdue.  Season five also reunites Vivian Vance and Lucy and takes them to the Sunset Strip posing as hippies. The episode is a classic.  Most of the 22 episodes for season five are excellent except for maybe two or three.  My favorites include:  Lucy's Substitute Secretary w/Rutha Lee trying to take over Lucy's job with Lucy doing an hysterical impersonation as a mod interior decorator; Lucy teaming up with George Burns, Carol Burnett (in a two-part episode), the now classic John Wayne episode, Main Street USA (two Parts), Lucy Bags A Bargain, Lucy Goes To London (episode) that leads into the ""Lucy In London"" special, Lucy w/Paul Winchell, Lucy And The Ring A Ding Ring, Lucy and Phil Silvers and Lucy Gets Drafted w/ a cameo by Jim Nabors.  All these episodes are so well written and done with such love it's no wonder that everyone loves Lucy.  In addition, ""Lucy In London"" TV special with Dave Clark Five and Anthony Newley will be one of the extras.  The special was very innovative for its' time and probably gave us one of the first and very best music videos with Lucy posing in all the mod costumes of that time.  It's a really enjoyable special and is probably Lucy's best TV Special ever.  Again, thank you CBS/Paramount Home Entertainment for putting such love in ""The Lucy Show"" DVDs.  Can't wait for the sixth and final season.",1315958400,11,1799,4.616352201257862

4834969,4,B005MQ58LS,"The fifth of six seasons of the top ten, Emmy-winning ""Lucy Show"" is more familiar to modern audiences than others, in part because of a copyright goof, most of these episodes have been available on cheaply-made DVDs over a period of years when the rest of the series was unavailable.  Fans of the show who have seen the same 30 episodes packaged and repacked over and over with shoddy video quality will be pleased to see these professionally restored episodes.

Many of the episodes are inventively written: ""Lucy and the Bean Queen"" has Lucy taking advantage of a ""double your money back"" offer, but in the end she gives up her hard-schemed fortune in order to be honest.  Lucy horns her way into a John Wayne movie; gets hypnotized as part of a nightclub act; and loses Paul Winchell's dummies.  A two-part episode, ""Main Street U.S.A.""/""Lucy Puts Main Street on the Map"" features a memorable original song.

Even if you already have some of the cheap DVDs with these episodes, it is worth it to get the real thing.

4834971,5,B005MQ58LS,What an amazing job they did on the restoration of this classic show. Season 5 even includes the rarely seen Jack in the Box Intro. Every episode is fully restored with great picture and sound quality. Finally these shows that have only been available as poor public domain releases get the full treatment. Season 5 is one of my favorites. There are guest stars galore and we have worked through the awkward transition of losing her children from the first two years and Vivian Vance retiring. In the previous season they were still working out the new format. Everything is in place and the laughs are galore in this season. If you love the Lucy Show you will love this restored version of the Fifth season.,1360627200,,708,4.626984126984127
4834972,5,B005MQ58LS,"I used to watch ""The Lucy Show"" with my mother as a child, so this show brings back fond memories. The episode I remembered the most was ""Lucy In London."" I admit I bought Season 5 for the chance to watch ""Lucy In London"" again. And it did not disappoint! Seen in beautiful, restored color was such as treat, especially since when I watched it as a child, we only had black and white TVs. So I had never seen ""Lucy in London"" or ""The Lucy Show"" in color until now. I got a kick out of seeing all the ""Mod"" fashions and Twiggy has a cameo in the episode. (If you're a Baby Boomer like me, you know who that was!)
It was my understanding that ""Lucy in London"" was only broadcast once on 10/24/66, and I often wondered why it never found its way to Nick At Nite, TVLand or Antenna TV. So I'm delighted it was included in the Season 5 set. That alone makes this set well worth the price, and my son loves Lucy as much as I do. An interesting tidbit: Phil Spector wrote and SANG the ""Lucy in London"" theme song. What was disappointing is Lucy planned on making two more specials like ""Lucy in London"", but due to poor reception of this episode, she decided against it.",1357776000,,1163,4.173333333333333
4834973,5,B005MQ58LS,"After four successful years, Lucille Ball entered another season of ""The Lucy Show.""

4834974,5,B005MQ58LS,"Growing up, I always loved watching older shows, being that I was raised by my grandparents, I was a Baby Boomer at heart, and was raised to respect my elders, and never had a desire to watch the trash on TV nowadays!

  I loved The Lucy Show from the very beginning! So much that not only did I purchase One copy of Season 5, but 3 additional copies from BestBuy just to make sure that I never have to be without Lucy. There is no if, ands, or buts if you love Lucy. Either you do or you don't. If you don't, you have poor taste in Comedy. Buy this set along with Season 1-4. You won't be disappointed ! I personally guarantee you will be very entertained.",1340755200,4,657,4.1171875
4834975,5,B005MQ58LS,"The Lucy Show-The Fifth Season(66/67),is Paramount's official release of,I think,the best season of the series since its first season. The show started to wane with Vivian Vance on it,she departed,which left a hole that the writers couldn't successfully fill until this season. Everything seems to be swinging in high gear. This season finds the likes of John Wayne,Don Rickles,Carol Burnett and George Burns dropping by to heighten the proceedings. Of course John Wayne's appearance harkened directly back to the I Love Lucy series,when Wayne appeared in two classic eps with Lucy and Vivian ""messing up"" his footprints in cement. Even Vivian Vance was a welcome sight this season in her return for an ep.
The unexpected highlight of this set however is the Lucy in London hour special. I had not seen it since its original airing and was gobsmacked to see it added into the set. I recall it as kind of an odd duck,so far as Lucy was concerned. It was as if she was trying to appeal to the younger crowd and show them how ""hip"" she could be,which she needn't have had to do. It also smacked a little of a psychedelic film with Lucy suddenly bursting into a dance routine in the park or on some steps,with fast edits and cuts for emphasize. To add to the `hipper`Lucy image,Lucy was dressed to the nines in the appropriate Mod outfits direct from Carnaby Street. Phil Spector wrote the theme music and the Dave Clark Five appeared,to add some street cred to the proceedings. There is a featurette on the making of this ep and you will see the makers talking of their ""wise"" decision to use the ""talented"" Anthony Newley as the basis around which everything else was shot. Unfortunately their choice of Newley as their centerpiece was a mistake to a certain degree. As creative and talented as Newley was,the hottest act,selling millions of records and the hottest ticket around,The DC5,were underutilized;not one song did they perform. Well technically speaking,they did help Lucy and Anthony sing London Bridge while performing a dance routine with them,but that was as good as it got. Otherwise they were in and out,only involved in these weird dance montages. They even let Newley do a little routine and sing a few of his signature numbers on a stage,which made it obvious then,and it remains so today,that as ""hip""as the producers wanted to make it all seem,they were still old school. Why didn't they get the DC5 to play just one number;and as this was a ""feel good"" kind of thing,the DC5 could have played one of their big hits Because,right to Lucy,as she sat watching it. It would have been hip and sentimental at the same time showing even England loved Lucy! Well the special is what it is,and at the time got razzy reviews from TV critics(who could really understand it),but it is still really nice to have it out there once again for all to see.
Paramount,again,has done a fantastic job of remastering these eps which are crisp and clear. And as always the extras are to die for,as they include:""Lucy In London"",""Lucy In London Revisited"" (Documentary),clip From 1967 Emmy Awards,clip From 1966 Affiliates Presentation,clip From ""Victor Borge Comedy Theatre"",""25 Years of Savings Bonds"",bloopers,rare promos,vintage openings & closings,guest cast bios,production notes and photo galleries.
This series was not I Love Lucy by any stretch,but it still shows pro Lucille Ball doing what she did best,and that was making people laugh. She was ably supported in this season by Mary Jane Croft as her neighbour,and the ever brilliant Gale Gordon as Mr. Mooney. The writing and skits seemed to flow the best in many a season and Lucy finally got an Emmy for this years work;which she deserved. Highly recommended.",1329523200,5,3719,4.89540412044374
4834976,4,B005MQ58LS,"Why do I love Lucy? The shows are comedy, nothing less, no sadness just funny.

EIther you love Lucy or you don't - there's no middle ground - and if you don't, shame on you! But for those of us who do, what more is there to say? We will never see the likes of her again - no celebrity before or since has been able to match her brilliance for comedy while maintaining class and dignity. Lucille Ball was and is an American treasure... and many thanks to all those responsible for the production of these classic collections - the quality is amazing....",1326067200,7,654,4.198412698412699

I have never seen this because the syndicated prints omitted it and inserted the kalidescope opening instead. It's really corny and I can see why Lucy hated it.  On a better note, the ""extras"" are fantastic, the prints are pristine. I couldn't believe these episodes are 40 years old!! Seeing Carol Burnett, Vivan Vance, John Wayne, George Burns amongst other legendary actors are great. A true must for any Lucy fan out there.",1324944000,7,564,4.814432989690721
4834979,5,B005MQ58LS,"Okay, I admit.  I'm a Lucy nerd.  I have all the seasons of all the shows.  Before the first ""I Love Lucy"" release, I had all the episodes of all the shows on home-recorded VHS!  So, I was a little skeptical at first about this set.  (In my opinion, ""The Lucy Show"" season 5 is probably the nadir of her television career, but in Nielsen's opinion, it was the #4 show, pulling an impressive 26.19 rating that year.)  I guess one could say season 5 is when Lucy got her ""groove back.""  Unlike season 4, season 5 has a stable cast and a stable back story.  Every episode is not a trial balloon for the future of the show.

However, I felt the episodes started to get stale.  The episodes were written by a troupe of writers not regular to ""Lucy,"" and the plots seemed far-fetched, even for the zany redhead.  Who would cash in 3,000 cans of beans?!?  Anyway, this aside, the episodes are beautifully restored to optimum quality!  Throw your old recorded season 5 from the 1990's reruns (Oh, that was only me?  My bad.) away, and buy this!  Now, I'm going to feel pretty silly if someone else has already bought this for me and has it wrapped and ready to give -- but I just couldn't wait.

Anyway, final verdict:

Quality: 6 stars!
Plots: 3 stars
Acting: 3 1/2 stars (a little over-the-top at times)
Bonus features: 5 stars
Physical stunts: 4 1/2 stars
One-liners: 4 stars

Get this for the Lucy nerd!",1324684800,4,1399,4.377431906614786
4834980,5,B005MQ58LS,"Lucy Show Season 5 is here and the shows look fantastic! Of all the seasons we have waited for the shows in this volume I think I have seen the most, but only in cheap DVD & VHS distribution companies that make their masters from old worn out 16mm prints that have been in public domain for years! This is the first time we can see these shows in all their glory with restored openings like they have never been seen. My favorite part is being able to finally see the ""Lucy In London' special with Anthony Newley. This is one of the best parts of this season and was truly a treat to watch. The 'Lucy In London - Revisited' documentary is also extraordinary,and very informative.

CBS along with Lucie Arnaz & Desi Arnaz Jr. really add so many wonderful extras to all the DVD sets that they have a hand in and this one is no exception!

There's good reason Ms. Lucille Ball is, was, and always will be crowned the ""Queen of Comedy"".
She did it first, she did it right....and most of all....she did it FUNNY, and without being crass.
I concur with other reviewers that i'll continue to add remaining seasons to my DVD collection of both ""The Lucy Show"" & ""Here's Lucy""...and HOPE the release of ""Life with Lucy"" will see the light of day on DVD as it deserves just as much recognition and respect as all of Ms. Ball's work prior.",1323302400,5,738,4.474074074074074

But thankfully we finally have season five, now I remember some of the episodes from when I watched them as a kid back in the early to mid 1990's on Nick at Nite, but it's been so long since I have seen them of course since it really hasn't been on the air since, so I can't comment on the quality of the episodes yet, but anything with Lucy is excellent to me, and of course Gale Gordon and the numerous guest stars that will be in this season, John Wayne, Carol Burnett, Claude Akins, Phil Silvers, and so on, so yes, great guest stars, and a special mention to Vivian Vance who appears in 'Lucy and Viv' they were a great pair.

Now I know most of these episodes were previously released on those cheap public domain copies, I had two of them, and the episodes were unwatchable, well this morning I threw those away once I got this, and the episodes look fantastic as usual, all digitally remastered, and the audio is perfect, and packaged the same way as first four seasons, which I really like, and you get a ton of fun extras with this set, including 'Lucy in London' and the documentary that goes with it which is about a half hour in length, nice!, 'Smile Pretty' is a nice little extra that captured Lucille's gorgeous face posing, plus a couple of original promos, photo's, production notes, all that fun stuff, and her receiving an Emmy in 1967, so great extras.

I am looking forward to reliving my childhood once again with watching these episodes, many of which I haven't seen for about 15-16 years, I am really excited, and one more season to go people, so keep reviewing and it will be on DVD before you know it, and also 'Here's Lucy' Season 5 will be released on February 28th next year, so I say by the end of the year next year, we will have ALL of Lucy, except maybe 'Life with Lucy' but who knows!",1323129600,4,1916,4.290055248618785

Finally, after countless times of buying the public domain episodes, with some companies having varying quality prints of the episodes, I can now get rid of them!  Some of those public domain prints are so damaged, they're almost unwatchable.  The worst quality episode is ""Lucy and Carol in Palm Springs"".  Half of the prints look like they were just left on the floor and had been stepped on countless times, and nothing has been done to fix them in any way.

These episodes have also been seen on many low power TV stations throughout the years, and sometimes, they look even worse on TV!

It will be so nice to see these episodes from what is most likely the most popular season among fans of the show in pristine quality, and in their entirety, without splices and lines in the film.

I can't wait 'til this is released, and it will be just in time for Christmas!

Edit: I now own this set.  I bought it for myself on Christmas Eve, and started watching it as soon as I got home.  The quality is amazing!  The episodes look like they're from this decade!  The first 10 episodes contain the original ""Lucy in the Box"" intro, which hasn't been seen in years, and I can see why Lucy hated it.  Very tacky and tasteless.  Who wants to see their head pop put of a box, for Heaven's sake?

Anyway, this set is amazing, and I'm glad this season is finally here.  Target only had one copy left.  Not anymore!  I got there just in time.  I'm currently on the 3rd disc.  Halfway done with this season.  I haven't noticed any edits so far, even though it says some episodes have been edited for the home video release.

If they are edited, they left more in than the TV syndication prints ever did!

4834985,5,B005MQ58LS,"At the start of Season 5, Lucy was contemplating about selling Desilu Productions. At age 55, Lucy decided that she still loved performing, but at this age could easily give up the enormous responsibility and stress of running an entire production studio on top of acting and producing her own show.  With the thought of selling Desilu this season,  Lucy's focus was on the shows more than the previous years. Her focus on the great musical numbers and great guest stars really paid off, as Lucy won her first Emmy for The Lucy Show as Best Actress in a Comedy Series. Lucy had won Emmy's twice earlier in her career in 1953 for Best Comedienne and in 1956 for Best Actress in a Continuing Performance for the beloved I Love Lucy Series.  Gale Gordon was also nominated for an Emmy this year for Best Supporting Actor In A Comedy Series, but lost to Don Knotts return to The Andy Griffith Show. This Season of The Lucy Show held a solid 4th place in the Nielsen ratings for the year.

This Season 5 starts out fabulous with Lucy and George Burns singing and dancing and Lucy doing the old Gracie Allen routines. You can see the friendship between Ball and Burns as they move together like one. Lucy had plenty of parties at her home during these years, and a staple trio was Bob Hope, George Burns and always next door neighbor Jack Benny. Lucy also out does herself, playing a perfect dummy with ventriloquist Paul Winchell. She is simply brilliant! When Lucy gets a new room mate in Carol Burnett, the shy librarian, who does Tarzan yells, you can't stop laughing. John Wayne is always a treat to watch and is one of the few who never complained about Lucy's directing him. The first time John Wayne appeared on television was on I Love Lucy, where Lucy immediately told him where to stand, how to act and what to say, so he may have thought this was normal.

The beloved Vivian Vance makes an appearance with Lucy as the two go mod on Sunset Strip- and their dancing is too much! So touching is Main Street USA, set in a town called Bancroft, where Mel Torme, John Bubbles, Paul Winchell and Lucy sing, dance, lead a parade and bring back memories of penney candy and the local drug store's home made ice cream sodas. This is a two part episode, where Dan Rowan also guest stars in the second part. Don Rickles boxes with Lucy, Tennessee Ernie Ford has a fantastic hoedown at Mr. Mooney's Bank and Sheldon Leonard, the old gangster movie star who in real life turned producer of The Danny Thomas Show, The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Andy Griffith Show, The Gomer Pyle Show and I Spy, wants to shoot a pilot at Mr. Mooney's bank.

One of the highlights of this Season is The Lucille Ball Special- Lucy In London, which was actually filmed in London and aired on October 24, 1966 on CBS. This one hour special starts out with Lucy winning a one day trip to London by writing the winning dog food jingle for a dog food campaign. When she gets to London, Anthony Newley gives her a fantastic tour of the sights in his sidecar of his motorcycle.  Lucy has the most mod wardrobe and sports some great mod wigs and The Dave Clark 5 sing the song Lucy In London written by Phil Spector. A true rarity is a few glimpses of the then skyrocketing to fame in 1966, model Twiggy. Watch for the darling little waif sitting at a table on the sidewalk in London's great mod clothing shop areas with some other girls. You won't miss her in her mini and bright orange Mary Jane shoes. It is truly rare to see Twiggy on film in 1966, instead of on a magazine cover! How wonderful that Lucy filmed her back then- even if it was only sitting at a table! CBS has graciously included this fantastic one hour special in this Season 5 dvd set for us Lucy fans! They are also including a couple other goodies, including a new 2011 Lucy In London Documentary. CBS has outdone themselves on this series and have my gratitude!

The 22 episodes with the one hour London special equal the usual 24 episodes per season for this Season 5 of The Lucy Show. Gale Gordon and Mary Jane Croft are in almost every episode and together they really took the place of Vivian Vance. An interesting note on Mary Jane Croft is that she was one of the few women who Lucy could trust completely, going way back to the I Love Lucy series. Since Mary Jane Croft was married to a producer, Desi never hit on her, due to his respect for her husband, making her a trusted friend for Lucy.  Lucy's trusted friendships lasted forever, as she knew Mary Jane since the radio days. I can't wait to enjoy these great shows, great musical performances, great guest stars and the Lucy In London special just in time for the Holidays this December 2011!  Now, we only need one more Season 6 to complete The Lucy Show! THANK YOU AGAIN CBS!

4834986,5,B005MQ58LS,"The fifth season of The Lucy Show is very funny.  In fact so funny that Lucy won and Emmy award for her work in this season.  In this season, Lucy is Mr. Mooney's full-time secretary, and she gets into some of the craziest situations!  Some of the funniest episodes are, ""Lucy and the Ring-a-ding-ding,"" ""Lucy, The Babysitter, ""Lucy flies to London,"" and those are just a few.  This DVD set was put together beautifully.  The episodes are crystal clear, the sound if perfect, and it's jam packed with extra features, including Lucy's emmy award speach in 1967!  This is a very entertaining season, and the""Lucy goes to London"" special was great as well.  If you love Lucy, then you must buy the 5th season!",1315958400,8,706,4.645161290322581

8479559,3,B005MQ58LS,"Since Season 4, The Lucy Show began to have some very silly, nonsensical episodes that just seemed very unrealistic. Season 5 started to have episodes that placed more emphasis on musicals and guest stars, rather than actual comedy itself. Up til now, the comedy had seemed to worn out dry and stale. I don't consider Season 5 to be the best of the show, but there were some episodes that I did found to be interesting and perhaps stimulating.

My top picks:
Lucy And The Submarine
Lucy and Paul Winchell
Lucy Flies To London
Lucy Gets Caught In The Draft
Lucy and John Wayne
Viv Visits Lucy
Lucy, the Babysitter
Lucy and Tennessee Ernie Ford

I just started watching Season 6, and this is how I would rank all the seasons I've watched on the The Lucy Show so far:

1) Season 1 : still remains the BEST season so far in terms of the comedy and quality of the writing. It's the only season that reminds me of I Love Lucy the most, probably due to the fact that Desi Arnaz was the executive producer of this season. I wish he could have remained for the rest of the show's seasons. No other season after this one has been able to surpass it in that aspect, I'm sorry to say.

2) Season 3: A far better improvement from season 2. Better opening credits, better quality in writing, and more funnier episodes.

3) Season 4: Vivian Vance wasn't in this season, but I love the opening credits and I thought the season itself was as good as Season 3.

4) Season 5; Not much comedy thrown around. Too much emphasis on musical numbers, dancing, and celebrity guests that it felt more like a variety show.

5) Season 2: The most boring season of them all, despite having Vivian Vance in it.",1472860800,,1679,4.379421221864952
