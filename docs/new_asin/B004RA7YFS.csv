8438800,3,B004RA7YFS,"THE WAR TO END WAR 1914-1918 is a ten-part series of 40 minute episodes that seem geared to those already familiar with the battles of WWI. Some viewers may get lost in this program's rapid flow, for there's few maps to illustrate specified maneuvers or troop locations. The narrator's constant mispronounciation of place names isn't helpful, either.

The first episode covers pre-war Europe and the June 1914 assassinations in Sarajevo of Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife (Sophie). Included is a photo of the couple lying in state.

B&W interview footage of aging veterans is featured. One man describes the drowning effect caused by poison gas, and the helplessness of watching the agonies of those exposed to ground-hugging yellow clouds. Their memories of horrid conditions endured during long years of trench warfare defy belief.

One of the better chapters, ""Flyboys"" offers incomplete and/or inaccurate data. We're told that all eight original American pilots in the Lafayette Escadrille were KIA, including the son of an American president. Which president?

Teddy Roosevelt's youngest, Quentin was a pilot who died in battle in 1918, but he was a member of the 95th Aero Squadron, an American unit from Texas.

On the plus side, it's interesting to see massive multi-engined eight-man bombers the Germans came up with later in the war. Zeppelin warfare, including a glimpse inside one of the enormous airships, and another going up in flames, is also quite fascinating. Best of all, this episode doesn't make us sit through numerous sequences of marching infantry, like in so many of the others.

Among the many new weapons introduced between 1914 and '18 is the motion picture, used in aerial reconnaisance of troop positions. Cameramen were also on and behind the lines. Their surviving footage is an invaluable record of a new type of war that became obsolete almost as soon as the 11/11/18 armistice was signed.

Although not perfect, THE WAR TO END WAR makes a sincere effort to explain a complex struggle, one in which anywhere from 15 to 65 million perished.",1371686400,3,2088,5.087719298245614
