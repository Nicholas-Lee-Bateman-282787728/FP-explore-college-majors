8395555,2,B003ELKNNQ,"I'm not sure whether 'Tour de Force' is highly stylized or just poorly lit and sloppily edited. It reminds me very much of a short video, an espionage adventure, my brother and a few of his friends made when they were in high school, except theirs was better lit. Perhaps it was meant to be comic bookuh, I mean graphic novel in style. If so, it was markedly inconsistent. I can't comment on the dialogue, since my only experience of it is in subtitles, but there seemed to be some discontinuity in the behavior of the characters; their expectation of results did not seem to be a logical outcome of their actions. There's a twist ending, but, IMHO, they twisted it right off. Finally, I can't decide if this film was bad or just different. In either case, though I watched it through, I didn't care for it.",1451606400,,807,4.45945945945946
