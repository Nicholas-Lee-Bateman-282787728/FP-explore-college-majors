8449528,2,B004Z8ZW7Y,"I ordered and received 3 Lucy Neatby DVDs and was so looking forward to Tips and Techniques 4 and Sock Knitting 1 and 2. I am very disappointed with all three. They are quite similar and I find the same presentations on all three DVDs. Not only kind 'of like the same, but THE SAME. I'm an intermediate knitter and I thought I was in for all sorts of new ideas and good stuff about knitting in general and socks in particular, but alas, not true. See if you can preview these before you buy them, or try to rent from your public library.
I'm going to return all 3.",1311638400,7,564,4.136363636363637
