2189457,5,B0006J28DM,"As many others have thought after the release of the Freshman year, that we didn't know if they will release the whole series.  I've been waiting for this one to come out to complete my collection.  I think that this was the best year in the series and I can't wait to see it!",1104278400,,276,4.092592592592593
2189458,5,B0006J28DM,"If your looking for consistently amazing acting, then ""Felicity"" is the show for you. Sadly the fourth was the last season of ""Felicity"" and thus the graduating season. Nonetheless, many fans would have loved to see Felicity's life unfold outside of collage. This season of Felicity deals with the hardships of commitment. Many characters this season deal commitment issues, such as relationships, education, and with following a particular career path. Most viewers would assume that by now Felicity would know exactly what it is that she's meant to do, and who she is meant to be with, however this is not the case. No show has come closer to displaying this sense of regret and uncertainty as ""Felicity"" does this season. Just because we get older doesn't mean we know everything. Felicity's confidence has grown with each passing season, but much of her season one and two uncertainties come back to haut her. So just when you the viewers think they know her, she does something completely out of character. It keeps the show interesting, and along with the funny and charismatic cast, this show deserves much praise.

Because Felicity was only signed on for 17 episodes this season, like season three, the writers and directors wanted to make sure that the fans got their graduation episode. However, the show was picked-up for another five episodes. Because of this, the writers decided on a neat twist, and unrealistic twist of Felicity going back in time. Many complained of the unrealistic direction this took, others like myself enjoyed the lightness and comedy that these episodes portrayed. It was a nice change from the dramatic, and often melancholic undertone of the first 17 episodes. My piece of advice is to have fun with these 'extra' episodes and not dissect every piece of inconsistency, it was meant to be 'far reaching'. In the end, something may be learned from all this silliness, that no matter how much you may think you could have done better, or changed things for the better, on the grand scheme of things it doesn't really matter, because you're always where you're suppose to be, and who you want to be with is a decision you must make considering where you've been, and everything you've overcome- together.

Also, we are spoiled with another spectacular quest appearance from John Ritter, ""Ben's father"". He and Scott Speedman share many touching scenes.

Lastly, I came across a quote from a ""Felicity"" Website ([...]) that sums up why so many people love this show:

""I think the reason that so many people love the show is because it mirrors our own lives at times. Although our circumstances may not be the same, we can appreciate the emotions and situations of the characters. Life's lessons are hard, but it helps to know that you're not alone in it all.""

Just found out what kind of bonus material we could be seeing on this DVD box set. This is what is being reported on the trusty site [...]
1)""The Lost Elena Scenes: This exclusive, never-before-seen footage provides the long-awaited answer to Felicity fans' biggest questions."" (this may make the inconsistencies that I was talking about a bit clearer to the audience.)
2)""Fade Out: Behind-the-scenes reflections on Felicity with Keri Russell and the show's creators.""

I'm sure they will once again have some episode commentaries, but that's just me speculating, anyway for now that's all they're saying, I'll let you know if it changes.",1100822400,57,3435,4.9342560553633215

2189511,3,B0006J28DM,"There is a LOT going on in this season. Maybe it being the last but a lot that is kinda boring (ben's dad/lauren) & all the craziness going on with Ben's dad/Lauren/Ben/Felicity/Noel/Elena
No offense to Javier's character b/c I loved him previous to this season. They gave him more of a character but it was kinda boring too. Megan Rotundi & even Richard Coad is seriously funny. They could have done more with those 2. The time travel one was really confusing & interesting to watch & sad too bringing you from present to the past. I'm not sure if the writers were just overloaded with ideas or just wanted to get it over with in the end.
The one thing I noticed more in all seasons is everyone's always whispering! I wish Felicity had more of an aggressive voice in the show. Don't get me wrong - a huge fan of the show but just like Angela Chase in My So-Called Life both characters were kind of passive. Miss the show. I wish they would play re-runs on regular tv as they do my ultimate fave show BH 90210. FELICITY can be a really funny show to watch. And I loved just like My So Called Life & BH 90210 (Original) that there was soo much emphasis on school & being in school. It made it very timely.",1433548800,,1204,4.262008733624454

2189523,3,B0006J28DM,I love Felicity but I forgot how boring the last season was. I kinda got sick of the whole Ben or Noel question.

2189530,5,B0006J28DM,I enjoyed the entire series of Felicity. I have watched the entire thing twice and am sure I will watch it again and again over the years. The end is kind of corny but I enjoyed it and just didn't want it to end.,1403913600,,212,3.840909090909091
2189531,5,B0006J28DM,"Felicity was a great show it starred Kerri Russell who was one of the top teen stars in the day (which is why I watched it in the first place). It follows a young woman named Felicity as she goes journey's through the next chapter of her life which is adulthood and college. As we know life is full of ups and downs and winding roads, Felicity's experience was no different however, she met people on campus who became her second family and they tried their best to help each other navigate life.

It's a series about enduring change, finding your way and friendship. Though it was a drama series it was very calm and very balanced, it dealt with serious and realistic issues and it also had some hollywood made up issues that would not have happened at least not in those days.  It was a great show that will be missed by those of us who grew up watching it. Hopefully those of you who are new to this series will love it just as much as the original fans.",1400630400,2,957,4.252747252747253

2189539,3,B0006J28DM,"Even though it might've been awkward to inject 9/11 into the first episode (which probably would've aired sometime in late October or early November, almost two months after this tragic event took place), since the first several episodes were already completed before the season premiere, it still seemed rather strange to see a show that took place in the midst of the city most directly affected, during and after this event. Also strange were the ""extras"" who appeared so unaffected by what had so recently happened to them. And, no flags anywhere? The producers must've looked far and wide to find a place, anywhere in the city, where there weren't any.",1393804800,,657,4.927927927927928
2189540,5,B0006J28DM,"I bumped into this show many years after it went off the air and for some reason it grabbed me.
A good ensemble cast with the nice continuity that a plot of four years in college with the same cast brings. Another good show from J.J. Abrams (along with Matt Reeves). The show was so convincing that it was hard to watch Keri Russell (Felicity) in a complete turn-around role, years later, as the cold-blooded Elizabeth Jennings in The Americans. Goes to show how talented and versatile an actor she is. Good ensemble cast with the cast chemistry needed to make any show work. This one worked. Well.",1392163200,3,598,4.546296296296297
2189541,4,B0006J28DM,"That a TV series set in NYC from 2001-2002(Felicity began her freshman year in 1998 and graduated in 2002) would make no reference to 9/11. I know at least the first 4 to 6 episodes were probably broadcast-ready when 9/11 happened and maybe that producers would've felt awkward putting their first reference to 9/11 in the Thanksgiving episode (probably the first one filmed after 9/11 happened, but there is such a thing as editing the episodes finished before 9/11 by filming and adding some additional footage.

2189556,3,B0006J28DM,"Not as ""real"" as Season one, Freshman Year. In fact, the episodes were a bit too unbelievable. Characters and plots were too ""Hollywood.""",1344470400,,137,5.0
2189557,5,B0006J28DM,"""Felicity"" has two endings but only one resolution.  The real ending, the planned one, takes place at the original end of Season Four, Episode 17, ""The Graduate"".  The second ending, at the end of Episode 22, is an attempt to resolve a few hanging issues, and in so doing, make a few extra bucks for the producers and crew working too quickly and evidently without the knowledge of how brilliant their work was through four seasons, graduation to graduation; the last five episodes are 4.9 episodes of Felicity dreaming and working out her angst and decision self-doubt.  They're obviously flawed judging by the public's misunderstanding of exactly what's real and what's not.  It would have been easy to fix the final scene to make it clear where the dream began.

The dream starts with the first scene of Episode 18 and continues until Felicity awakens from her fever fueled fantasy.  Nobody has actually died and the viewer doesn't know exactly what Ben is apologizing for.  Did the cheating actually occur?  Was it consumated?  And since Episode 18 begins with Felicity in her old room talking to Sally via tape recorder, time-travel happened IN HER DREAM.  The explanation of Ben and Felicity's split (or maybe they're just having problems -- we don't really know) happens in the dream, so we don't really know what happened.  Maybe it's an accumulative thing arising from four years of Ben not being ready for adulthood.  But no one knows the answer to why he's asking for forgiveness.  We only know that he is, but we don't know the ""real"" details.

This series, even with the clumsy final five installments, is still an A+.  It isn't a silly, adolescent, fluff show as most who haven't watched it straight through regard it.  It shouldn't be lumped in with ""Dawson's Creek"" and the WB clones that followed.  ""Felicity"" is one of the best love stories ever put on television -- and that's what it is, a love story.  The weekly episodes are just the backdrop and the vehicle for that love story.  We watch Felicity grow from a socially stunted seventeen-year-old brainiac with controlling, filtering parents to a self-assured young woman who doesn't need love but who will accept it with open arms if it's finally reciprocal.  The four year arc from high school crush to eduring love is the perfect amount of time to watch these characters grow, learn, and love.  The five episodes that follow the real ending are interesting and thought provoking but are like putting lipstick on The Mona Lisa -- and smearing it a bit.

Don't watch this without tissues, Gatorade, and Doritos; you're gonna cry.  A lot.",1341532800,2,2610,4.8157303370786515
2189558,2,B0006J28DM,"I have been trying to get through the Felicity series for about 5 or so years now. When the show was actually airing, ratings dropped in season two (they moved the show to Sunday nights) and they blamed the drop because of the Felicity character's seriously chopped haircut.

Despite the wonderful cast and an awesome first season, I think the rating's are due to some of the annoying character's on the show (Julie in particular) as well as the overly used and whispered (?) ""hey's"" and ""hi's."" On the slightly-even more-annoying side, two questions are used in EVERY episode...""can I ask you something?"" and ""can I talk to you for a second?"" The predictable characters (Sean is currently working on an invention, Meghan is casting a spell in her ugly black clothes, Elena is studying yet again, Julie is crying yet again) do nothing to help this show gain viewers.

But the true pitfall of the series is the despicable love triangle between Noel, Felicity and Ben (pictured above). Noel and Felicity are best friends, they have fun together, they ""click"" with each other and Noel spends most of the series pining for her. This causes Noel to look pathetic, like a sad little puppy following her around. Don't get me wrong, he has his ""oh, I love Noel"" moments but for the most part he is just annoying and in the way. Ben on the other hand is a little more independent...sometimes a little too much which always causes trouble between him and Felicity. Ben went through a period where he was without substance, a little too ho-hum and to be honest, flat out boring. It seemed the longer his hair got, the more lame he became. In the end, you just wanted her to pick a guy-which one? Who cares! Just choose one already!

The poor series held on and deemed itself worthy of watching but became a depressing mess in the last season (season 4). It has taken great dedication, and tolerance, to finish this series. I look forward to seeing these actors in more creative, less rediculous/predictable roles. 2/5 stars... for the effort...",1338940800,2,2033,4.689075630252101

He should have been way over Felicity and trying to hurt Ben by using Felicity against him. He wasn't as focused as he should have been in his life. However, this is the season where I fell the most in love with Ben's character. He gets more mature and more focused into what he wants. He finally finds a career choice and sticks with it. Felicity was a bit more selfish in the season because she wants to have her cake, eat it, and the ice cream. She's no longer the innocent lost girl, but she keeps acting like it which was kind of annoying. The ending episodes weren't really needed and confused the audience into wondering what the heck was going on. i would have loved to see how all the character's lives turned out after college besides the short clips with Noel getting married. Anyway, if you've ever seen Seasons 1-3, then you definitely have to complete the series with the 4rth.

2189576,4,B0006J28DM,"FELICITY ends where it should have ended, with Felicity's graduation from college.  Well, her graduation with a bit of an alternative-reality twist.  But as a fan of Philip K. Dick I'm completely at ease with that.  Twist or no twist, FELICITY ended by being with no serious competition the finest show about being a college student ever made.  Although two other series were overall much better shows -- BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and VERONICA MARS -- neither did as good a job of dealing with college life; in both instances they remained great series despite the dip in quality created by the college setting.  Although the final two seasons of FELICITY were not as strong as the first two, it nonetheless remained consistently fascinating.

Season Four -- like the first three seasons -- focused on Felicity Porter's relationships with Ben and Noel.  As in each previous season those relationships were complicated by bad decisions or misunderstandings on the parts of the various individuals involved.  The major event of this season comes early on, as a depressed Felicity in a moment of weakness sleeps with Noel on the top of the building Ben and Noel live in with Sean and Meghan.  There is no short-term fall out from this, but when Noel tells Ben about this in a moment of weakness, all hell breaks lose.  Things are patched up, but something remains broken in Ben and Felicity's relationship.  There are many other events in the season, from the near death of Ben's dad to his sexual encounter with an older woman during the time when he and Felicity were broken up resulting in her becoming pregnant with Ben's child.  But the expected end of the series comes to a close with Ben and Felicity at Stanford, where he cheats on her.

This is where the series takes an unexpected and uncharacteristic twist.  Felicity, deeply regretting all the events following her infidelity with Noel, laments the course of her life to Meghan, who in turns attempts her most sophisticated spell yet, a reversal of time.  Felicity wakes to a time before the night that she slept with Noel.  But redoing her life does not go anywhere near as smoothly as she had hoped.  Suffice it to say that the author of the spell that Meghan cast undertakes a new spell, sending her back into the future.  Once back, she forgives Ben his own infidelity and -- as the series draws to a close -- they apparently patch everything up for good.  My major complaint with the series finale is that it was essentially a clip show.  A substantial portion of that final episode was footage from other episodes.  Fans of the show surely deserved better than that.  That being said, at least it was a better than normal clip show.

And so FELICITY comes to an end.  It remained a strong show from beginning to end, though there are multiple signs of unwanted and unhelpful network interference.  Still, we are lucky that the show managed to get all the way through the four years it took Felicity to make her way all the way through college.  Hopefully we will someday get another first rate show about going to college.  If we don't, at least we have FELICITY.",1218326400,,3127,4.6899082568807335

They claim that the final episode was about 20 minutes longer than the usual 43 minutes allocated by the network... no wonder, with all those flashbacks! they could've been more creative, maybe they didn't have to show the full scenes and just have Felicity describe the moments and the emotions attached to those memories to that spell guy.

2189583,5,B0006J28DM,"When Felicity first started I was obsessed with it. I found it charming and refreshing; such a simple plot line gave space for so much. I stopped watching at the beginning of season 2 (not because of the haircut thing, actually I thought she looked great with short hair). And not until now had I felt the urge to know what happens to this loveable bunch of people. I've finished watching Season 4 (after a long marathon of seasons 1-2-3) and I have to say that this season is by far the most heartbreaking. I didn't want to watch it because I had read so much about how the vision of the show got destroyed and how characters behaved differently, anyway I decided to give it a chance. I don't regret it at all. Yes, I was mad when Felicity cheated on Ben (why?), I didn't like at all that Ben got a woman pregnant (I agree with the one of the reviewers that this was a big dissapointment and the way Felicity handled it was a little bit dissapointing too, a little bit of anger a l ""Avery situation"" would've been nice to see), I didn't like all the on-off situation between B & F, etc.. etc.. but at the same time I understand why it was handled that way. That's how life unfolds, unexpected things happen, people and things change. This is what this season was all about, growing up, making choices, facing ""real life"". Also the acting in this season was superb, especially from the two Scotts. I think the storyline with Ben's father (the oh so good John Ritter may he R.I.P.) was a great chance for Speedman to show that his character was much more than met the eye. And S. Foley captured perfectly the anguish of someone that's just LOST.

I was a little bit skeptical about the last 5 episodes (the time travel episodes) and how I would feel about them. But I have to be honest, I LOVED them. I think they changed the heartbreaking mood that we were left with in ""The Graduate"", because they were lighter and with some really funny moments. Also it was great to see that even if we could travel back in time to change something, probably when we get there we can't change anything at all (Felicity realizing she couldn't change the ""force"" between her and Ben as case in point). This cast (especially Keri & Scott S.) had a magical chemistry, and in the end they made it work no matter what. I really miss this show.

To ball your eyes out watch:

* The Last Thanksgiving (one scene in particular is heart-rending)

* Ooops Noel did it again (why Noel why?!!!)

* The Graduate

* Back to the Future

To relieve the Ben & Felicity magic

* A Perfect Match

* The Power of the Ex

* Felicity Interrupted

* The Graduate (the bed scene)

To laugh a little

* Spin the bottle",1171929600,5,2678,4.332

2189586,4,B0006J28DM,"i would always be happier with MORE special features on felicity, but having short clips of interviews with some of the cast & creators and explaining the enigma that was elena's disappearance/reappearance (via some deleted scenes w/commentary) were two that i particularly appreciated.

the few available audio commentaries didn't do much for me -- the actors mostly chat about whatever, make fun of themselves, and forget what some fans might consider key plot points from the show (!), it having been a handful of years since they shot the show.

as to the episodes themselves, i had not seen all of them when they aired so it was important to me to watch them sequentially & fill in the blanks.  it was a pretty strong season--some creators/producers/directors from the first season came back and lent a hand, which i believe is noticeable.

even though the 'time travel' episodes after the graduation one definitely twist the show's realistic precedent and leave some lingering questions apart from the elena issue, they ARE an enjoyable and somewhat interesting 'what if' addition.  despite the fact that some of those episodes start to feel redundant in their similarity to stories we've already seen, they diverged enough to hold my interest and offered the chance to bring back jennifer garner's and amy jo johnson's characters.

most importantly, by the final episode, felicity returns to 'the present' and the show ends on that note and with a big event (wedding).

personally, i would have preferred that the final episode included fewer flashbacks to past seasons' scenes and MORE of the 'return to present' & wedding (incl. resolving the elena mystery) / new footage in general, but oh well.

all in all, i do enthusiastically recommend the felicity senior year collection.

**sidenote on felicity's hair & appearance:  i like her hair straightened and can agree that a new, more mature look was appropriate for her this season, but her eye brows are plucked so thin that to me, they scream 'porn star' and it's bothersome!  but maybe that's just me?",1162512000,,2064,5.005847953216374

The fourth season of this series is my favorite - a little more of the trials and tribulations of life that many people in society have to overcome.  It is nice to see a show that deals with these types of issues from a young adults life and how they overcome them.

Many loyal followers of the show seem to be disappointed with the departure of the last five episodes of the series (4th season), but I thought it was a bit refreshing to see a departure from the norm.

2189593,2,B0006J28DM,"I am a big Felicity fan, but the Senior Year really hit a terrible wall.  One of the creators admitted in interviews later that he had already moved on to Alias, and it shows.  This is a mess.  He and all the producers and writers should be ashamed to have let their fine project peter out like this.  The scripts no longer make any sense.  Characters act out-of-character, many things go unexplained, plotlines are dropped right and left, minor characters are played by the same person, and so on.  Apparently, people at NYU have multiple jobs, working in the mailroom one month and in counseling the next, working in the health center one month and in the library the next.  The producers can't even take the time to hire separate people to play these parts.  But the worst is having Felicity copy her final paper and then be allowed to graduate.  This after they had a show about cheating in season 2, making it a very big deal.  Now, suddenly, there are no consequences.  It is apparently OK to plagiarize papers and throw library books in the garbage and steal dissertations.  I am not being a moralist here, I am just pointing out that all this completely goes against Felicity's character, a character developed over three long seasons.  The Senior Year has many similar examples, which show that the new writers could not even be bothered to become familiar with the previous material.  The scripts don't just have a different feel, they are nonsense.  There is no continuity even week to week.  And this is before all the additional mess caused by extending the season.  I own all four years now, but I think I will stick with the first two.  I doubt I will ever subject myself to the 4th year again.

I personally never lived in a dorm, but this kinda lets you know what it was like, and also all the post-dorm, apartment living too.

I'll also comment that I think everyone on the show did great acting. Scott Speedman's portrayal of Ben is the hottest pain-in-the-ass with a heart who repeated screws up. Its so easy to sympatize with Scott Foley's character, Noel, and get frustrated with him every single time.

2189597,5,B0006J28DM,"Nominated for 2 Emmys and 2 Golden Globes, including Best TV Series - Drama, Felicity gathered a large cult following in its short four season stint. Premiering on the WB network in September 1998, the show (along with Dawson's Creek) helped ignite a firestorm of highly successful original series on behalf of the upstart network, with such hit shows as Angel (1999), Gilmore Girls (2000), and Smallville (2001). The brainchild of writer J.J. Abrams (creator of the two hit series Alias and Lost), Felicity follows the life of a recent high school graduate, not through seasons 1, 2, 3, and 4, but through Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior years. Similar in genre to its contemporary, Dawson's Creek, Felicity's cast is of approximately the same age, but the setting is college instead of high school...

Felicity begins when the star of the series, Felicity Porter (Keri Russell), graduates from high school. Having harbored a four-year crush on classmate Ben Covington (Scott Speedman), despite the fact they've never talked, Felicity musters the courage in the aftermath of their commencement ceremony to ask him to sign her yearbook. When Ben writes some surprising comments, Felicity decides to follow him to fictional University of New York (UNY) instead of pursuing her goal of pre-med at Stanford. Against her parent's wishes, she enrolls in the school and moves cross country where she becomes roommates with Meghan Rotundi (Amanda Foreman), a girl whose lifestyle clashes with her own, and where she meets resident advisor Noel Crane (Scott Foley) who immediately develops a crush on her. When Ben learns of the true reason for Felicity's enrollment, he's both flattered and a little uncertain about Felicity's mental stability. In the ensuing four years, Felicity goes through the basic trials and travails of a maturing college student, experiencing the ups and downs of life, love, and adulthood...

The Felicity (Season 4) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The Declaration"" in which the summer before Felicity's senior year is coming to an end. Felicity's father is putting a lot of pressure of Felicity to decide what she's going to do with her life and even goes so far as to accuse her of wasting her college years. Meanwhile, Ben has decided he wants to become a doctor, thus forcing him to spend at least one more year in school to satisfy the pre-med requirements. His contrasting attitude from that of Felicity drives a wedge between them, and Felicity begins spending more and more time with Noel... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""Oops... Noel Did It Again"" in which Ben must deal with the impending death of his father while Noel reveals the truth about his and Felicity's relationship, and ""Raising Arizona"" in which Ben decides to transfer to the University of Arizona in order to be near Lauren and his unborn child...

2189598,5,B0006J28DM,"I was completely addicted to this show during it's prime time viewing and I now own all 4 seasons on DVD and have watched them all repeatedly.  I also love the scene where Ben proposes to Felicity in bed..Oh so romantic.  The acting is amazing in this show.  Some people(men mostly)  are always complaining about the teeny-bopper shows and how the acting is so bad, etc..But this show wasn't like that at all.  I loved these characters.  I wanted to be Felicity's friend because she was the most caring person I know.  How sad is that?  Anyway, this series was amazing and I am still not sure though she chose the right guy for her.  Noel was sooooo sweet.",1113177600,4,656,4.445378151260504
2189599,4,B0006J28DM,"I am a huge Felicity fan.  I have loved and will always love this series.  I do not normally write reviews, but I just finished a 3-night marathon of watching this final season.  Do not read any more if you don't want to know what happens.

I was at first skeptical about the time-travel storyline, but found that it brought a much-needed lightness to the show which was very heavy in this final season.

This is where I have my main complaint.  Felicity and Ben were facing very difficult times due to her insecurity about the future and Ben's dad illness (by the way, an outstanding dramatic performance by John Ritter).  The added sub-plot with Lauren's pregnancy and Ben becoming a father, was too much.  For me, this was the element that spoiled this series from being perfect.  I don't think they really needed to include this in the show, for many reasons, but mostly because in our dream world it would have been nice to imagine what the show could not give us, their life after college.  It would have been nice to imagine Felicity and Ben getting married, and experiencing the joys of parenthood together and for the first time for both.  For me, this sub-plot is a dark cloud that will stay with them forever.

Another problem with the show is the final episode's  omission of the scenes which explain how Elena is present at Noel's wedding after we know she dies.  Before seeing the bonus material, I thought it was her spirit, even though I could not explain Tracy's presence.  This was a huge thing, and it was very disappointing to see the creators explain that they had to cut out some scenes from the last show because it was too long; when they used many clips from previous shows that we did not need to see again.  This said, I was glad for this twist.  I was glad to have Elena alive again.

In any case, this was one of the best series on television.  In my perfect world I dream with Felicity Again...a new series five or ten years after graduation.  A new Thirtysomething with the whole cast.  J.J. Abrams, I hope you read these reviews, but I'm sure you're too busy with Alias.

Thank you Felicity and Good-bye.",1111881600,10,2136,4.4935064935064934
2189600,4,B0006J28DM,"After ""Felicity"" had filmed its ""final"" episode, ""The Graduate,"" whatever show was suppose to replace it in the WB's lineup quickly tanked and the network requested another five episodes from creators J.J. Abrams and Matt Reeves.  Their exercise in retroactive self-reflexivity almost redeems the final season, but having Felicity end up with Ben not once, but twice, is just adding insult to injury as far as I am concerned.  For me the point where the show threatened to jump the shark was not when Keri Russell cut her hair but when Felicity chose Ben over Noel, so when we stopped getting the WB on our cable system I forgot about ""Felicity"" and worried about getting copies of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" on tape.  I caught the endings of this fourth season when they original aired and now with ""Felicity: Senior Year Collection"" on DVD, I can see what I missed.

The major premise of the fourth season can be reduced to the idea that while Felicity (Russell) and Ben (Scott Speedman) are going to end up together no matter what, they should make the ""no matter what"" part as complicated as possible.  If Felicity's concern about being admitted to the college's honors art program puts Ben's plan of becoming a doctor in danger is not enough to derail them (""The Declaration""), then maybe Felicity having sex with Noel will do it (""My Best Friend's Wedding"").  It is not a true episode of Felicity if we do not get to the point where Ben is not talking to Felicity and she insists on talking anyway (e.g., ""The Last Thanksgiving"").  It is not enough that Felicity have a pregnancy scare (""Miss Conception""), because it is even more fun if Ben spends a night with another woman during one of his fights with Felicity and the other woman shows up pregnant (""Future Shock"").  When Meghan's sister shows up pregnant (""Fire"") your first impulse is to point a finger at Ben.

This all underscores what I realized when I watched ""Felicity: Sophomore Year Collection,"" which is that I watch ""Felicity"" despite the title character and not because of her.  While Felicity and Ben go through their revolving door relationship the other characters become more important.  The one-note couple of Elena (Tangi Miller) and Tracy (Donald Adeosun Faison) finally get to the wedding day (""My Best Friend's Wedding""), at which point we get to forget about them and pay more attention to Meghan (Amanda Foreman) and Shawn (Greg Grunberg), a.k.a. Shmeghan, who are much more interesting, especially once their parental units become involved (""Your Money or Your Wife"").  Even Ben's troubled relationship with his father (John Ritter) becomes more interesting than his roller coaster with Felicity (""Oops...Noel Did It Again"").  But my favorite part of this fourth season is when they decide that the comedy team should be Meghan and Javier (Ian Gomez) who end up taking drama together (""Future Shock"").  Meanwhile, Shawn and Noel (Scott Foley), become partners in the computer graphics business (""A Perfect Match""), which is good because Noel has been suffering from depression (""Moving On"").  Lord knows the man has reason.

All I can say is that if Felicity was one of my students she would have failed for the stunt she pulls with that paper (""The Paper Chase""), and then everybody would have graduated except Felicity, as irony would have ruled supreme.  But Felicity gets her diploma (""The Graduate"") and then makes a decision concerning her future education that pretty much makes the four years she spent at NYU an absolute wash.  I was going to say a farce, but they save that for the last five episodes when the producers had to come up with a creative way of telling more stories after the series has reached its natural climax.

The idea that Felicity would go back in time to rectify her mistake and choose Noel instead of Ben was just the sort of thing to get my heart pumping again.  It was like the heavens had opened up and a shaft of light had descended on Felicity along with that all-important dollar that would allow her to buy a clue.  Hit with a pair of tragedies, Felicity confesses to Meghan that the biggest mistake of her life was not picking Noel (as opposed to following Ben to New York so she could not be a doctor).  Noel is about to get married so the only intelligent thing to do is for Meghan to use a spell to send Felicity back in time to the start of their senior year (""Time Will Tell"").  Of course, since there are four more episodes to go and living happily ever after is not that interesting dramatically, trying to fix her own troubled life causes some major problems for the rest of the gang.

All the birds come home to roost during this mini-story arc, including both Julie (Amy Jo Johnson) and Hannah (Jennifer Garner), as Felicity undoes everyone's past.  When we get to the point where Ben and Noel are both convinced that Felicity needs psychiatric help (""Felicity Interrupted""), the show turns really dark.  Unfortunately, most of the final ""final"" episode (""Back to the Future"") is a clip show done in the context of Felicity talking to Korsikoff (Kurt Fuller), the man who wrote the book from which Meghan got the time travel spell.  The shift in tone does not work for me, and given that this was so much of a clip show I find it hard to believe they had to cut the deleted Elena scenes that appear in the special features on Disc 6.  On the plus side, the show does end on a happy note for Noel and I can cherish that idea while reminding myself that I never need suffer through Ben and Felicity not talking ever again.  This is what happens when you like ""Felicity"" more than Felicity.",1111708800,15,5623,4.697556008146639
2189601,4,B0006J28DM,"Having adored Felicity in it's first season to the point of obsession and then abandoned her like so many fans when she cut her hair, I was always curious about how the series ultimately played itself out.  Fortunately through the miracle of DVD I now know, and in this final fourth season I felt a wrap up and conclusion that is rarely realized on TV - ever.

The fourth season was bit melodramatic for most of it's mid point as the whole Ben/Lauren subplot was probably my least favorite storyline in the series.  By some odd almost improbable means though the series ends incredibly strong and ironically it's because it was cancelled a bit earlier than usual, then suddenly ressurected for several more episodes.  What's amazing is that even though the ""first"" ending (episode 17) is emotional, I would never have felt as satisfied with the end of the series had the plot twist in episode 18 not played out so well with such a competent group of people to pull it off.  It makes me sad to catch up and see it end finally three years after it was cancelled, but fulfilled nonetheless at a great achievement in television production.",1111363200,2,1135,4.626865671641791
2189602,5,B0006J28DM,"I just got my copy of  season 4 yesterday and i've finished it in just a day or two. I just cant stop watching it. The episode ""The graduate"" which Scott Foley directed was the best episode ever. The ep is full of emotion in which every women have experienced or will be experiencing. Ben (scott speedmand) was at his very best. I love the way how he propose to felicity in bed. That scene should be included in the ""best proposal in a tv series"".The DVD set in general is excellent and a collector's item to every felicty fan.",1111190400,,527,4.27
2189603,5,B0006J28DM,"I was a sophomore in college the year Felicity started and have to say that for anyone about to enter college, this is a great show to watch.  I honestly found myself feeling the same things Felicity did.  The Graduate episode is by far my favorite because it takes me back through all the emotions that I felt on my Graduation day.  The extreme joy of graduating and the pure fear of entering the ""real"" world.  I love the last 5 episodes b/c everyone at some point or another has wondered what would happen if you chose a different path.  The bonus features for this season are the best.  The fade out gives the viewer an opportunity to see how much these people truly loved each other.",1110931200,2,688,4.377952755905512
2189604,5,B0006J28DM,"Well... I just have received my DVD pack of this 4th season, and I have to say that is the best season of the show... And the last scene of the last episode is so emotional... I mean, I remember when I saw the final episode two years ago and by that time I could see the meaning of this scene for the cast... Megan almost cry with Felicity, Javier had tears in his eyes... and last week when I saw the fade out (a part of the bonus features) I realized that what I felt two years ago was for real...

Is so sad that this is the last season, but what can I say... I'll keep watching all the seasons during long time",1110758400,,614,3.912
2189605,5,B0006J28DM,"I'm giving this set of DVDs 5 stars mostly because of the extra features found on the DVDs. They are sure to please any fan of the show. But the contents of the final season, I felt, were wanting. I would give the final season 4 stars because even when this series hit low points, it was still better than many other shows on TV at the time.

I watched Felicity from the very first episode. I liked the show because it felt very real. Felicity's friends were the kind of people one meets in real life. They were not overdone or over explained. The conversations did not feel forced or complicated, they were very natural. That's why I had such a problem buying the fantasy sequence at the end of the show. I didn't have a problem with the B&W 1950's episode in Season 2, in fact, it's one of my favorites. I liked this one because it was an acting experiment, it did not interfere with the series' story line, it just used it as a setup and showed off the actors' range.

On the other hand, the split fantasy sequence felt like a desperate attempt to satisfy viewers like myself who felt Noel had been short-changed. But overall, I enjoy watching the episodes over and over again. They're smart, funny, and highly entertaining.",1110499200,2,1227,4.424778761061947
2189606,5,B0006J28DM,"I have watched ""Felicity"" since the show first aired.  Honestly, since it's series finale I can't put my finger on what makes me watch the previous seasons over and over on DVD.

I agree with most watchers that there is something about the show that makes you feel like they are ""real"" characters and you feel like they are part of your lives.  The characters portray real-life subjects and probably things that most have us have already been through or are going through in our lives.

I think that is what makes this television show so special.  Since ""Felicity"" I have not found a show that I can relate to as I did with this one.  I don't know if it was the fact that I was going through college the same time as the Felicity was on the show or if it was that I could relate to each character to someone in my own life.  Whatever it may be...""Felicity"" is one of those shows that are ""unforgettable.""",1110240000,2,904,4.313609467455621
2189607,5,B0006J28DM,"This season's ending certainly does tie things up...

You are no longer left unsettled, uncertain, or afraid for Felicity Porter. She has grown into an independent, challenging, though a still emotionally-driven individual.

The creators of Felicity deserve a job well done...

I hope you all have enjoyed, what is 'Felicity', as much as I have grown to love her.",1109894400,2,363,5.11864406779661

It's classy, and funny, and most important, has no no silly soap opera-ish drama. Just enough to make it realistic, and just enough sex to make the characters seem passionate. I love that they're all normal college students. I love that they go through ups and downs, and that the heroine, Felicity, doesn't win all the time. These college students are people I could be friends with, I relate and I love them all. Defintely one of the best, classiest shows out there.",1480550400,,580,4.533333333333333
