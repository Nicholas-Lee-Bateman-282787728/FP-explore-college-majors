2469630,2,B000CQLZ6A,Quite slow moving and nothing like the artwork.  It is only worth a watch if you want to say you've seen a worse love story than Twilight.,1447027200,,138,4.111111111111111

2469633,4,B000CQLZ6A,"Surprisingly well written and directed this is a major departure from the other movies produced by Troma. While definitely intended to be a comedy this movie relies more on dialogue, irony, and character development as opposed to just being wacky. It's definitely slow paced and it's only barely a horror movie, if it even is one at all.

I think the guy who directed this wound up becoming a philosophy professor, somewhere, which really shows in the dialogue and situations explored by the characters. Don't let the low budget and amateurish acting deceive you, this is a really smart movie.",1442880000,2,593,4.93
2469634,4,B000CQLZ6A,I thought it was great. And it is quite rare. Great 80s genre. If you love the 80s like I do. Thanks seller for making a rare movie available.,1393804800,2,142,3.9310344827586206

8100535,1,B000CQLZ6A,"Worst movie ever!!!  a COMPLETE waste of my time!!  Horrible acting, horrible script, horrible filmography, horrible sound and sound effects!!  I would call this a ""class F"" movie!

I can't believe that this was even accepted by Amazon for its viewers!!  If you want to waste your time, watch it.  I skipped around to see if it ever got any better, but this movie should have been titled, ""Dumb and Dumbest!!""",1465257600,,409,4.690140845070423
