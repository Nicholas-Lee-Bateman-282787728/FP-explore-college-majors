So with those memories in mind I searched this out for my 6 year old granddaughter to see, I was elated with joy when I found it and could hardly wait for it to arrive. When that day came I made such a production out of what we were about to share together that you could feel the excitement in the air. You could also feel the disappointment in the air when it started to play. IT was soooo grainy,Haha. You could barely see it. My granddaughter looked at me like I  had three heads, she said WoW! you really watched this ?? I said yes but I remember it sooo differently. Save your money and let your old memories be good ones but leave them in the past , it was good 40 + years ago...Really it was !",1471737600,6,840,4.0

Most impressive of all is the lovely and breath taking gown that she wears at the ball. An outstanding performance of what it is to be poor, humble and meek, and to finally fulfill one's impossible dream. I gave this an undisputable rating of 5 stars.

I'm a child of the 70's, but since I don't remember having seen this as a child, I'm missing the lenses of nostalgia that I suspect many are viewing this through.  I'll give it this:  Lesley Ann Warren is exceptionally beautiful.  That's it.

If you're like me and just can't pass up any version of Cinderella, go ahead and buy this, but be forewarned. And don't let this sour you on Rogers & Hammerstein's Cinderella. The 50's version is dated, but adorable.  I didn't mind that it was in black and white.

One disappointing cut is ""Your Majesties"", a fun number for the King and Queen. The reasoning behind this seems to be that the director was going for a less comic royal couple.

695643,4,6303646689,"Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Cinderella"" was such a success upon its premiere as a live television event in 1957, that the decision was made to mount another production in 1965, but to record it for posterity this time around. It starred Lesley Ann Warren, Ginger Rogers, Stuart Damon, Celeste Holm, and Walter Pidgeon (among others).

I viewed this one in conjunction with the 1957 version; it had been quite a while since I've seen either one, and I wanted to compare the two. They certainly are very different, though the songs and orchestrations are pretty much the same in both versions. (The main difference with the music is that one song was dropped from the 1957 score, and another---""Loneliness of Evening""--- was added. It's a lovely little tune, which had originally been written for ""South Pacific"" but which was not used in that show.)

However, apart from the music, this is completely different from the original teleplay. The 1957 script was scrapped entirely (not a trace of it remains) and replaced with an all-new story structure, dialogue---the works. And I'm afraid the new script doesn't compare to the old---it's dull and stodgy and lackluster, where the original was light and witty and vivacious. There's a certain lethargy present throughout the production, in fact. It isn't dull, exactly, but it doesn't have much energy either.

Interesting to see how Lesley Ann Warren played the role quite differently than Julies Andrews did. Lesley's Cinderella is shy and retiring, wistful and lonely, while Julie's was cheery, hopeful, and energetic. I think both interpretations work well, but there's a slight problem with Lesley's performance, in that the actress really is not a singer and doesn't have a strong voice. She doesn't sound BAD, but she's obviously not a trained singer.  In fact, NONE of the actors in this production have particularly good voices apart from Stuart Damon as the prince---and in my opinion this is a big problem in a musical. When you're working with a musical score as lovely as this one is, you want to hear it performed at very high standards.

The set design is an extremely stylized mediaeval concoction (in 1960's colours!)---there's no attempt at realism, but rather it's deliberately made to look like a stage play. The results are rather interesting, but everything is lit very brightly using a flat, uniform lighting design that robs the production of any shred of atmosphere. It's a pity, but I daresay this type of lighting was necessary for the primitive early colour video cameras in use during this time period.

The costumes likewise are mock-mediaeval; I can't say I like the colour design, but they're kind of fun---I always got a kick out of those huge elaborate headdresses, particularly the tall pointy ones with flowing drapes on the tips. Unfortunately I thought that Cinderella's ball gown was most unimpressive---it flowed nicely when she was waltzing, but that's the best that can be said for it. Ginger Rogers likewise was dressed in an extremely unflattering gown---and hey, why on earth would they use Ginger Rogers in this picture if they didn't feature her in a dance with the king?

So, despite the higher level of technical proficiency, and the fact that the original video elements are much better preserved, this version does not really measure up to the 1957 original, in my opinion. A mixed review from me---and yet I have a very strong fondness for this production, because it was the one that was broadcast every year when I was growing up. It was a big deal when this would be shown on television, and we would watch it without fail. And I still re-watch it every now and again, all these many years later. So, if you like the music, I'll recommend this one as well as the 1957 production.

Inexplicably, this DVD is now out of print, but it much sought-after (if you read the reviews here, you'll see that most people remember this very fondly indeed). It regularly sells at a certain on-line auction site for sums between forty and eighty dollars---but if you keep an eye out for it, you can occasionally find a relatively inexpensive copy that somehow has been overlooked. The soundtrack album, however, is still available.",1328227200,,4217,4.929577464788732

They managed to save most of this original Cinderella movie but it was badly burnt in areas and I believe the scene with the bluebirds and that dress was one of the parts that was damaged. So the Lesley Anne Warren, Cinderella one that everyone has a copy of is actually the one that was saved and missing some scenes.

My 9 yr. old grandaughter and I viewed it together and she could see why the movie so enchanted me for the majority of my life. She agreed that there has not been another version of Cinderella (and she has seen them all) that even comes close to this one.
Sharing this movie with my daughter wasn't an option, as the movie wasn't available anywhere....so sharing with my grandaughter was PRICELESS.
I totally and completely recommend this version of Cinderella to all """"Princesses"""" out there, young and not so young.",1249430400,5,917,4.485029940119761

Watching this movie, you can't help but compare it to other versions of the Cinderella tale. This one ends up looking like a high school production. The colors are a little off, the video quality is not up to par, and my generation (and younger) will not recognize any of the stars in the film.

I could remember certain scenes, Leslie Ann, the colorful gowns at the ball, the melodies...OH the melodies. My goodness, this score is so beautiful and even haunting. It is not simple happy major key tunes, but has such depth and conveys the evocative painful longing of love. Leslie Ann Warren, then and now, still one of my absolute favorite actresses of all time * PLEASE see Choose Me!!!*
she was such a beautiful wise soul at 18, able to convey everything with her eyes, with that gorgeous smile, her angelic voice... Everyone in this movie, the breathtaking Celeste Holm, the elegant beauty Ginger Rogers... even the stepmother and sisters, their talent shines!
Even though the sets were kind of simple and certainly not up to the big budgets of today, the story still works. The simplicity and colors convey the storybook feel, and certainly children will not mind that!
I don't exactly know why I was crying my eyes out... the beautiful songs and how they were sung, the memories of my childhood, the simple story of love and magic?
I can not recommend this enough for children and dreamers and lovers of all ages. Exceptionally magical!

696670,3,6303646689,"The wonderful classic Cinderella story presented as only Rodgers & Hammerstein can: melodic music, delightful lyrics, and humor too. A retelling filled with charm and elegance.

 Lesly Ann Warren (only 18 in her first film role) simply enchants you. She glows with youthful charm, heartfelt acting and lovely singing. Stuart Damon really sings and carries his princely role well. Walter Pidgeon, Ginger Rogers, Celeste Holm, Jo Van Fleet, Pat Carroll, Barbara Ruick complement the supporting cast. (After Warren, my favorite acting vote goes to Jo Van Fleet for her role as stepmother: her expressions delightly blend with her biting tone in dialogue.)

 The TV production has theatre/playhouse-like sets which are okay, a blend of elegance and quaintness. Yet what surprises you is the below par video reproduction. The DVD is presentable but looks as if it's taken from a video film. By comparison, the Retrospective Featurette made in 2001 has distinctly superior quality to the feature selection itself.

 Overall: genuinely recommended for the heartwarming portrayal with Lesly Ann Warren, yet with a caution note that technical reproduction is below dvd standards.",1192752000,2,1170,5.43646408839779

696672,3,6303646689,"I can remember watching this version of Cinderella on T.V. when I was like 6 years old. Earlier this year, a co-worker mentioned this production and I decided to see if it was out on DVD. What a nice surprise to find it on Amazon - and at such a bargain! I watched it alone as soon as it arrived. It was not quite as good as I remembered, but what is as good as when you were six? I decided to ""modify"" my re-evaluation, and invited some friends who work at a local ""cabaret"" to come over the following evening for a viewing. The use of alcohol (among other things) was involved as well. Needless to say, the circumstances of THAT showing provided a much different, but very enjoyable experience. We all sang along with the songs like a bunch of crazed R&H groupies and made campy comments about the costumes - especially the men in tights. What's not to love about Ginger Rogers as the Queen and Celest Holm as the Fairy Godmother? Of course, being the dementites we are, we could not avoid altering the lyrics of ""The Prince is Having a Ball!"" (I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.)

Everybody, but everybody remembered it with love.  It's still treasurable.  But I cannot recommend the DVD edition.  The VHS edition was fine-the overture and closing credit music was flown in from the stereo album master (nice, although it accounts for the ""glitch"" at the closing that one reviewer mentioned-the album take was different so the music did not match exactly).  The picture was fine-definitely better than the Mary Martin version of ""Peter Pan."" (The master tape of that production was destroyed by an incompetent video tech. and what survives is a composite of five backup copies.) The laser disc was even better.  But the DVD has a horrible ""enhanced"" stereo soundtrack that is all echo.  The picture is very soft.

It almost becomes a tear jerker from Leslie Ann Warren's very convincing cry in ""her own little corner.""

Actually, here, the wicked ancestors are a bit more comical in order to appear more clumsy, and ill mannered. Celeste Holm almost magnifys the extreme kind essence brought once before in ""The Wizard Of Oz"" Glinda, as the wonderful fairy god mother. The prince is fortunitely portrayed here, as not only handsome and dashing, but kind, considerate, and ""in love.""

I bought the DVD when I realized that my VHA version was missing the last 5 minutes.  I'm glad I did, since the quality was soooo much better.

The songs are wonderful and the costumes are vibrant, somewhat making up for the historical fudging.  Cinderella (Leslie Ann Warren) is not a strong character in this film, though.  The supporting cast are older, more established actors (Ginger Rogers, Walter Pigeon, Pat Carroll, Don Heitgerd) and their voices are much stronger and their screen presence better.  Stuart Damon is a somewhat unfocused Prince.  I have to wonder if he was looking off-scene for cues.  The Herald (Don Heitgerd), who was the original actor chosen for the Prince role, would have been stronger.  Prunella (Pat Carroll) out-acts her mother and sister in their scenes.  I will say that when the Prince and Cinderella are together, they match up well -- two unfocused, unexperienced, children.  But isn't that what fairy tales are about?

It has even improved with age.  The cast is perfection with a young Stuart Damon as the dashing, handsome prince, Ginger Rogers as the regal Queen, Walter Pidgeon as the king with the dry wit, Jo Van Fleet as the haughty stepmother, Barbara Ruick as Esmerelda, the stepsister with the batty eyes and Pat Carroll as Prunella (what a name for a character), the other nasty stepsister who manages to steal every scene she's in.  The scene where she's trying on the slipper is a howler!!  And let's not forget Celeste Holm as the epitome of goodness as the fairy godmother.  Oh, and the music???  My favorite is ""Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful"" and you'll find yourself singing along to ""Impossible"", ""In My Own Little Corner"", ""The Prince is Giving a Ball"", ""Ten Minutes Ago"", ""A Lovely Night""...and all the rest.  There is a charming fifteen minute retrospective featuring a much more mature Lesley Ann Warren who considers this film as a ""Gift"" to her career, (a now sadly bloated and yellow teethed) Stuart Damon and a still regal Celeste Holm reminiscing beautifully about this labor of love.

Cinderella (played by Leslie Ann Warren) is just so sweet, pure and HONEST.  You just can't help bawling your eyes out whenever some injustice is done to her.

The singing, the acting and the story line are all great.  The variations in the plot from that of the fairy tale you probably are familiar with from childhood are enough to keep you in suspense and surprised even though you know what happens at the end.

I understand this was a television movie, but they couldn't at least choose good actors and provide a better set?  Cinderella acts and sounds like a complete ditz, all starry-eyed and breathless voice.  It's partly the fault of the camera-work though.  Every 10 seconds and it's an extreme close-up of Cinderella's face.  It's frightening.  I love the music and this musical, but if it's not well-acted or well-sung, it's not enjoyable for me.  I've only heard the Julie Andrews version in soundtrack form, and already that one is 100X better.  There's none of the pleasant, exciting, and lovely performances of the original cast.

Although I love all the songs, ""In My Own Little Corner"" is my favorite.  I even sang it for choir Cabaret at my school, dressed in Cinderella's rags and all.  It is such a sweet heart warming song.

My children of course thought some of the dialogue and the flying pumpkin coach were pretty cheezy (okay, I agree) - but they still watched it a second time.  My daughter has now acquired the sheet music for ""Ten Minutes Ago"" and is learning to play it on the piano.  Like the story of Cinderella itself, the songs are timeless.

697131,3,6303646689,"Since, in 1965, the 1957 TV production of Cinderella starring Julie Andrews was unavailable, CBS television decided to videotape a new production in color. This version starred newcomer Lesley Ann Warren as Cinderella, as well as Stuart Damon, General Hospital's future Alan Quatermaine, as the Prince. Also in the cast were Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon as the King and Queen, Celeste Holm as the Fairy Godmother, and Jo Van Fleet as the Stepmother.

In this version, The Royal Dressing Room scene is omitted, a South Pacific outtake, Loneliness Of Evening, is added, and several scenes were rewritten and rearranged. In addition, Celeste Holm's Fairy Godmother is a sweet wishgiver, whereas Edith Adams' Godmother in the 1957 production was quite sarcastic and had not previously made her fairy status known to Cinderella. However, all of these differences do not matter much. It's a charming slice of classic TV.

The DVD, unfortunately, is not as charming. In 2001, dual layer technology HAD been invented, and should have been put to good use by giving more space for the show itself and maybe some more bonus features. The movie only takes up about 3.5 GB on this disc. The movie also could have used some serious remastering, and it's obvious from the style of the still frame used during the overture that an old video transfer was used for this DVD. Due to the source material, there will never be an amazing mind-blowing transfer, but this one could still be improved. In addition, the 9-minute retrospective featurette leaves you hungry for more. A lame sing-along featurette is included, as well as ""bonus"" trailers for Oliver, Annie, and Bye Bye Birdie. It would have been nice for a longer making-of documentary, maybe vintage TV spots and interviews and some photo galleries to be included.

Although it's wonderful to have this movie on DVD, this DVD seriously could have been improved, and hopefully in the future, this title will be revisited and given the royal treatment that Image Entertainment gave the 1957 TV production. Until then, while a disappointing release, you MUST own it simply to own it on DVD, unless you own a video cassette of it and have the ability to record it on DVD - you'll basically get the same quality.",1142208000,4,2251,4.918421052631579

697241,5,6303646689,"Famed composers Richard Rodgers And Oscar Hammerstein wrote ""Cinderella"" as an original television musical (their only one) for young star-in-the-making Julie Andrews. Supported by a cast which included Edie Adams, Howard Lindsay, Dorothy Stickney, Ilka Chase, Kay Ballard, Alice Ghostley and Jon Cypher, it received a tremendous publicity campaign and aired on March 31 1957. At the time, it drew a record number of viewers, although only the East Coast saw the live color broadcast (the rest of the country saw a black-and-white kinescope.) And, due in part to the poor quality of the kinescope, it was not repeated again until 2004.

Meanwhile, in 1964, Rodgers decided to mount a new production himself (Hammerstein had since died) with a new cast and adaptation, replacing the farcial quality of the original with a more traditional version. The result was another ratings smash, and as intended, a television perennial which was repeated for years. This time, the title role was played by young Lesley Ann Warren, who was introduced in this production and began a career which is still going strong today. Stuart Damon (later to gain fame on ""General Hospital"") played the prince. The supporting cast had Academy Award-winners Celeste Holm, as the fairy godmother, Jo Van Fleet as the stepmother, and Ginger Rogers as the queen. The beloved Walter Pigeon was cast as the king. And, as the two stepsisters Prunella and Esmerelda, were Pat Carroll and Barbara Ruick. Although the story stuck to the familiar fairy tale this time, the original songs were , of course, retained.

What more can be said for this near-perfect treasure? Ms. Warren is simply glorious as Cinderella, her fresh beauty complimented by her sweet singing voice, and Damon is her ideal Prince (Christopher) Charming. Celeste Holm sparkles as the fairy godmother, and she and Warren share one of the best numbers ""Impossible/It's Possible"". Van Fleet is a beautifully caustic stepmother, and both Carroll and Ruick are outstanding as the step-sisters. Unfortunately, both Rogers and Pigeon have little to do as the king and queen, but they ARE regal in their roles.

There are a couple of drawbacks--although critics at the time praised the ""lavish production""; in reality it is done in the manner of a stage show, with sparse (and very basic) settings, and typical television camera-work. But the biggest error was using videotape instead of film for this production. Because of it's limitations, videotape does no justice to a show like this, severely limiting the visual values needed to compliment the other elements. It may be fine for situation comedies, but it was totally wrong for a musical fantasy. It must be admitted, however, that after a few minutes, one gets used to it, but what a difference film would have made! Because this version is the traditional one, it is my favorite of the two, but both are so different in approach and treatment, that each can be enjoyed on their own terms.

Two cast members of the 1965 version were already professionally acquainted with ""Cinderella"". Walter Pigeon provided the uncredited narration for the 1955 MGM film adaptation ""The Glass Slipper"" and Barbara Ruick was the daughter of character actress Lurene Tuttle, who played ""Cousin Loulou"" in the same movie. Another winner, that version featured Leslie Caron as Cinderella. [phillindholm]",1134777600,10,3372,5.136612021857924

If you are a mom reading this, wondering if she should purchase this for her little girl, do so, without a doubt.  Watch it with your girls.

My sisters and I waited, with great anticipation, every year for this musical to be played on TV. Back in the 60's, you didn't have VHS or DVD recorders so you set your whole TV schedule on when ""Cinderella"" was going to be aired. Ma made us popcorn and my sisters and I snuggled up together in front of TV screen. What a great time! What great memories! We loved the magic and fantasy of the perfect love and the perfect couple with dancing and music and dresses and colors and .................well, you know the rest. If you would like to have something that is wholesome and fun and allows the innocence of childhood to be entertained, then please consider this for whatever little girl you love in your life. Many people have scoffed at the purity and absurdity of promoting a ""Prince Charming"" to their children; they want the reality of life instead. Why? Isn't childhood the only time that you can dream? They'll become adults soon enough, but until then, let them enjoy Rodgers and Hammersteins notes and lyrics, the kindness and magic of the Fairy Godmother, and all the anticipation of what lies ahead for our Cinderella and her Prince. And when you think about it, being good and having faith, does bring you a greater reward than you might realize!!",1122940800,9,1442,4.593023255813954
697334,5,6303646689,"There is such a connection with my childhood when I first saw this.  I was six years old we were living on a military base in North Carolina. My parents  had just left for a Christmas party  and my older brother and sister who were in High School were left in charge of  us (there were a total 7 of us at that time.)  As soon as my parents left the party was ON for us!  I know we ran my brother and sister crazy.  We jumped on the furniture, ate way too many sweets and yes....we probably ran with scissors!  The only thing that got us to calm down was this.  I think it was a double feature with  Mary Martin's Peter Pan playing the same evening.  Nureyev's  ""Nutcracker"" played later that week.  It's such a vivid memory.

Lesley Ann Warren's wild-eyed enthusiasm was contagious.  Her expressions and reactions drew me in.  The way she flinched at one point when Jo Van Fleet ( the step-mother who I'm sure Billy Idol stole his famous sneer from) snapped at her was heartbreaking.  I think I cried for her back then.  The acting on her part was superb considering how young she was and who she was acting with.  Van Fleet's persona alone usually eats up all other characters appearing with her in other films.  She was a bonafied scene stealer and a force to be reckoned with, but Lesley Ann Warren held her own beautifully.  Stuart Damon was and still is very nice to look at and his voice was very soothing and endearing.  (Although a bit stilted  and stiff in his acting at times.  I think the big names intimidated his some.)  Pat Carroll's comedic timing is on cue as usual, she was perfect.  Although I may have wanted to see more of Ginger and Celeste,  (Walter always bored me to tears)  the presentation was called  ""Cinderella""  after-all.

The sets were so 60's it makes me laugh, but that was part of the charm back then.  Rodger's and Hammerstien were fantastic with songs that will stay with you a lifetime.  On the whole it's truly wonderful and magical as it should be and definitely worth picking up for your kids to see!",1121126400,8,2041,4.386058981233244
697335,3,6303646689,"This 1965 remake of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical of Cinderella was justified by CBS because the original 1957 production could not be videotaped. Allegedly once it was broadcast, it was lost forever. That turned out not to be entirely true; it was preserved in a black-and-white kinescope recording that was recently released on DVD. This production, while technologically advanced and in full color, none the less lacks the magic that the original production had, largely because the producers decided to truncate the script and to make the entire production into a largely forgettable affair, wasting the talented actors they hired. While the production is not without charm, the charm pales in comparison to the original 1957, which is now available on DVD.

Lesley Ann Warren, a newcomer when she appeared in the title role, never really seems to become the princess type. She sings beautifully, but comes across as less than graceful throughout the production. Stuart Damon, in the role of the Prince, sings well, but his acting leaves much to be desired; he always seems to be reading from a cue card. The talents of Barbara Ruick and Pat Carroll are not adequately utilized in this production. They sing well, which comes as no surprise, but their full potential was not explored in this production. Celeste Holm is charming and regal as the Fairy Godmother, but her role has been pared down to almost nothing, a far cry from the original role. The roles of King and Queen in this production, played by Walter Pidgeon and Ginger Rodgers, have been reduced to walk-on roles that could have been just as easily played by extras; the banter that made the roles of the King and Queen so endearing in the original production is gone in this version completely.

It is hard to understand why the story was mutilated to such an extreme when the original story could have just as easily been used and given this production far more life than it had. The original story had so much verve that this production lacks that the two barely resemble one another. There is something very tragic in the waste of such a shabby production; it really was not necessary.

Someone will really have to explain what was the meaning of having that woman leap up in front of the camera on the last beat of the song ""The Prince Is Giving a Ball."" It was embarrassing, to say the least, for her. It was one of many oddities in the production that really defied all explanation. This production adds one song to the score -- a leftover song from South Pacific, Richard Rodgers explained in the program notes in the soundtrack album, ""Loneliness of Evening,"" sung by Stuart Damon -- but it added nothing to the production.

The quality of the DVD itself is fair; it's a shame that the contents don't justify making it. From reading the other reviews, I have a feeling that most of the others who gave five-star reviews never saw the 1957 version; otherwise, they would never have praised this version so highly. There really is no comparison. If it's quality you want, get the 1957 version with Julie Andrews; you won't regret the choice.",1113523200,13,3122,4.7652495378927915

Since then, she's been one of my favorite actresses. I think she's underrated, too. Stuart Damon is a very handsome prince. If I had been Cinderella, I would have fallen in love with him myself.

 Reviewer: FEEMEISTER1 (Tallahassee, Florida United States) - See all my reviews

 (UPDATE--12/17/04--I just saw the Julie Andrews version on PBS for the first time.  It couldn't TOUCH this version!  (And Julie Andrews has always been my favorite lady singer!!)  I thought the 57 version was flat, and the only thing really good in it at all were the ""Stepsisters, Kaye Ballard and Alice Ghostley!""  I thought I would be blown away by Julie singing these wonderful songs, but I was not.  I much prefer Lesley Ann Warren's versions of the songs.  THIS VERSION RULES!!!!!)

 This rendition of Cinderella is superb! The music is abolutely beautiful! I remember all the songs almost word for word from when I watched it when I was a child. I really loved it then, and watched it every year it came on. Now I'm 47, and I love it more NOW than I did THEN! I feel sorry for some of the reviewers here that can't see the beauty of this with their imagination, and who think everything has to have expensive new special effects and must be made with the greatest singers in the world (like Julie Andrews. No one can touch her singing!) But that is NOT what this is! This is a beautiful, unique, heartfelt rendition. Cinderella is fresh and sweet and tugs at your heart! The prince is gorgeous and nice and decent! The stepmother and sisters are FANTASTIC! They really make this complete! Jo Van Fleet's sneer is the best! (She even sneers when she's talking and has her back to you. ""There's no pleasing THAT prince!"" Her VOICE even sneered!!!) And Pat Carroll is so REAL!!!! And Esmerelda (Barbara Ruick) is hysterical with her eye batting!

 I LOVED the Prince's song at the beginning! It was warm and searching and heartfelt, and really set the tone for the singing! ""The Prince is Giving a Ball"" was novel and catchy, and I've remembered parts of it for almost 40 years!!! ""In My Own Little Corner"" I have loved and remembered all the words to for all this time! This song really comes alive and she puts SO much into it! Ms. Holm is a beautiful fairy godmother, and makes me wish I had been able to see her films when she was young! Her and Cinderella singing ""Impossible"" is wonderful! It's the usual Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""nonsense"" song and is very fast-paced, ""wordy"" and hard to sing! But they did an excellent job of it, and Cinderella's eyes absolutely sparkled! (This is another catchy one I've remembered ALL the words to for ALL this time!!!) The Prince and Cinderella dancing is just too wonderful for words! I wish I had all that room to waltz in while they're waltzing, but I only have a tiny living room and I don't know HOW to waltz, but I really wanted to! The movement of the dance was GREAT!!! (It would have been nice to see Ginger Rogers do a whole dance instead of one turn around the floor--but it was nice to see the legend dance in this for only a moment!) The stepsister's song (Stepsisters' Lament) was really a masterpiece! That was for all the normal girls, who aren't sweet and beautiful and ethereal like Cinderella! (She's a frothy little bubble--with a flimsy kind of CHARM! And with very little TROUBLE--I could break her little ARM!!!) This song is TOPS!!! ""Ten Minutes Ago"" and ""Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful"" are beautiful gems of songs. They are truly memorable! ""A Lovely Night"" is another lovely one (there really are NO bad songs in this one)!!! And when the Prince comes to their home to try the shoe on them!!! JO Van Fleet tries to steal the scene again, by sitting down for them to try the shoe on her old ""sneery"" self when she sees her daughters can't make it at all! The man just gets up and walks away--he wouldn't give her the satisfaction! But to me, the greatest scene in the whole thing, is when the Prince wants to try the shoe on Cinderella and the stepmother starts screaming and squawking, and the Prince yells ""SILENCE!!!!"" and they show the frozen tableau of the stepmother and sisters when they actually were made to shut up! THAT SCENE IS ABSOLUTELY indescribable! I truly can't think of words for how funny it was and how satisfying!

 This is not ""Gone With the Wind"" acting and it's not performed by opera queens. It wasn't high budget and out to make billions of dollars!

 However, the songs in it are beautiful. I rate it up there with Mary Poppins (Chim Chim Cheree and Feed the Birds) and of course, the Sound of Music.

 This is an operetta meant to entertain. It is witty and funny and heartwarming and fun and beautiful and memorable. I have remembered it and loved it since 1965 and find it truly unique and recommend it to all!!! (Except for people LOOKING for only Gone With the Wind Acting or Prima Donnas!)

The story is simple and straighforward, we all know it, so there's no need to go into any plot details.  This story does not deviate from the story we all know and love.
What makes this particular rendition a bit unique is simply that it's filmed as a play, rather than as a movie.  The sets are very stage-y, and the acting is overdone and a bit cheesy for a movie -- but you'll find that it works well on the stage.
The reason it works in this is because they didn't TRY to film it like an ordinary movie -- because it wouldn't have worked.  They filmed it as though they were just video-taping a play, and it was charming.
Leslie Ann Warren is positively adorable in the role of Cinderella.  The rest of the cast is wonderful as well; the stepsisters can be a riot sometimes, I can't help laughing at ""The Stepsisters' Lament.""  This is a movie any fairy tale lover will enjoy.",1071446400,70,1126,4.213953488372093

697534,5,6303646689,"Simply stated, Richard Rodgers is America's finest composer. No other composer in our history equals the consistent quality, innovativeness, range, and sublime beauty of his compositions. Rodgers' exquisite, unforgettable melodies are crafted with such subtle ingenuity and sophistication that they never lose their freshness or their appeal.
Rodgers' musical genius was brilliantly matched in two legendary partnerships, the first with lyricist Lorenz Hart, and the second with librettist-lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II. Rodgers' collaboration with these two gifted men elevated and transformed musical theater into a true and distinctive American art form.
The magic of the Rodgers & Hammerstein partnership is beautifully realized in their definitive version of ""Cinderella"". No other composer was more adept than Rodgers in translating character and plot into music.  And in ""Cinderella"" as in all of his compositions, he does so with perfect clarity, inventiveness and irresistibility.
Hammerstein's ever elegant lyrics are alternately and appropriately wise, witty, rapturous, and heartbreaking. Hammerstein had an unerring understanding of the human heart which is why he is able to consistently evoke profound empathy for his characters and their predicaments.
Rodgers' graceful and exceptionally beautiful score is infectious and exhilarating.  And those Rodgers waltzes- perfection, as always!
""Cinderella"" is blessed with a sterling cast including a young and very handsome Stuart Damon as the Prince.  Damon has a beautiful voice and is quite appealing.  Newcomer Lesley Anne Warren, who sounds like an angel singing, is captivating and lovely.  The maturity, intensity, and poise of her performance as Cinderella belie her tender age of 18 when this production was mounted.  Celeste Holme as the Fairy Godmother, Ginger Rogers as the Queen, and Walter Pidgeon as the King add gravity and warmth to the proceedings.  And the comedic performances of Pat Carroll, Barbara Ruick, and Jo Van Fleet as Cinderella's nasty stepsisters and stepmother, respectively, sparkle, amuse,  and delight.

I have to say that I thought it was FANTASTIC!! I have a 3 1/2 year old and she loved it !!
The actors did a Great job!! especially Lesley Anne warren who in my opinion is Cinderella... no hype or overdoing it, she did the part simply and classy, taking her scenes beyond what most actresses would do. (you really feel sorry for cinderella with all the amount of neglect she gets,I enjoyed the fact that she tries to remain good natured and happy spirited with the situations that were given to her). Beautiful singing voice and a great dancer! (""In my own little corner"", ""Impossible"",""A lovely night"" are wonderful songs).
. Her together with the prince were a match made in HEAVEN!, BRAVO to the both of them!! they look, act and sing VERY well and speaking of Stuart Damon....(where do I start) He is SO HANDSOME in this movie my jaw dropped!! I thought he was very humorous in many scenes,(He new what he was looking for in a woman and test ran all the maidens at the ball, maybe he was a little harsh with the step- sisters but he had an idea of who wanted him for her ""prize""). . His singing voice is Excellent (especially with his songs ""loneliness of evening"", ""10 minutes ago"" and ""do I love you because your beautiful"". I loved how he would look at her especially at the ball when he saw her at the top of the stairs(one will never forget that gaze along with the silence that followed as they walked toward each other...aaaaah!)and the end when he realized that this poor gal was his true love, and when he tried the slipper on her, My gosh where did they find him! -A GREAT CHOICE OF A MAN FOR THE PRINCE.
The rest of the cast is great!... Pat Carol was quite funny as Prunella especially at the ballroom,and when the prince tried on her slipper!) she has alot of humor (especially her little laugh) and with her wicked sister they make quite a pair( I thought the sisters were supposed to be Anastasia and druzella??) Unfortunately Walter pigeon and Ginger Rodgers didn't have enough ""Air time""(I thought) but made a grand King and Queen when they were shown. Jo van fleet's version of the wicked stepmother was very interesting (she really does not like cinderella) and the interplay between her and Cinderella was very good, her facial expressions are priceless, you have to pause your vcr and have a good laugh!!. Celeste Holmes was a very convincing Fairy god mother(a very silly one)her singing voice was good.
The sets/ special effects are totally fake but you tend to overlook that and concentrate on the story. The movie rolls right along ,(no time for boredom). There are parts in the original ""Cinderella"" children's book/film (the WALT DISNEY version) that are not shown in this film (examples: the mice that help Cinderella, her trying on the dress the mice made for her and having it ripped by the stepsisters, and getting helped at the end to get out of her room to try on the glass slipper.)etc

(As a guy now in my 40's, I admit to modern-day fairy tales having more sophisticated effects, but when I was a kid I thought the spinning prisms of light coming out of the fairy godmother's wand was the real thing!) Because it is a videotape, it does resemble a live performance, and may be as close as you can get to live since the next version was, in fact, filmed. I had a big crush on Lesley Ann Warren (all of 18 years old when this was taped), with her beautiful eyes and long swan neck, and was glad that this production expanded the ""Lovely Night"" sequence to accomodate her talents as a dancer. I enjoy this *and* the 1997 remake, and am not the least bit bothered by the multiracial casting as many others here seem to be. ('Politically Correct?' It's a fairy tale!!)

697540,3,6303646689,"This version of Rogers and Hammerstein's ""Cinderella"" is decent but can not hold a candle to the original with Julie Andrews. Anyone who was lucky enough to have seen the original can not help but remember what a magnificent production it was. The cast was so good that any others playing the roles pale by comparison. Julie Andrews WAS (and still is) Cinderella. Kaye Ballard and Alice Ghostly were a riot as the stepsisters and Edie Adams was a young, sexy, very funny godmother. The final image of her twirling her wand like a cheerleader with a baton at the wedding is unforgettable. She also had a much better singing voice than Celeste Holm.
When this second version was produced, a new book was written that took out all the humor given the stepsisters and godmother. It became a rather straightforward almost cardboard version. Gone was the great song for the king and queen - one of the real delights in the original. (Luckily it can be heard on the CD of the original.) The king and queen were delightful off beat characters but were made too dignified in the new version. The roles were cut so drastically that casting Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon wastes the talents of these major stars.
Leslie Ann Warren is an acceptable Cindy but the part was written for Julie Andrews so anyone else is at a disadvantage. It is rather ironic that she and Julie are both in ""Victor/Victoria"". Two more different actresses you could not find. Simply compare them in ""V/V"" to see this.
But, even fondly recalling the first version - though it was in black and white, this would still be a production to watch over and over. Even with eliminated songs, the score is wonderful. The production design is storybook lovely with great color.
""Cinderella"" will be successful in almost any version (except the one with Whitney Houston and Brandy - a real mistake) so perhaps comparing the Julie Andrews version to this one is a bit unfair. They use some of the same material but are very
different shows.",1024704000,5,1996,4.689458689458689

Lesley Ann Warren (fresh from her first Broadway musical ""110 In The Shade"") makes for a ravishing heroine, while Broadway's Stuart Damon is a suitably-charming Prince.
However, it is the star-studded supporting cast that really impresses; including Celeste Holm as Fairy Godmother, Ginger Rogers as the Queen, Walter Pidgeon as the King, Jo Van Fleet as the Stepmother, Barbara Ruick and Pat Carroll as the Stepsisters.
Simply delightful, this classic presentation looks as good as expected for its DVD debut; the original master tape was used for the first-ever digital restoration of the story.  There is some instances of grain and some imperfections with the mono sound but nothing we haven't seen before.

03-15-02 Update:
I wonder if those who are complaining about the poor picture quality are comparing it to a DVD of a theatrical movie. A motion picture (35MM or whatever) when transferred to DVD gives a pure, crisp, almost perfect picture. Cinderella was recorded on video tape in the mid 60's. Tape images are composed of lines the same as a TV picture. You can't get a perfect image. A DVD has a higher image resolution than tape. But an image with many trace lines transferred to DVD still has many trace lines. Not a fault, but a result. Thanks again.",1014508800,5,1154,4.526315789473684

states it was a movie which I always remembered as a child and was so excited when I found it on Amazon.
Thank you for making a fairy tale come back again.
Always,

But the beautiful score and songs are well worth it. Prunella, the stepsister of the creaking knee, later did the tremendous voice of Ursula in ""The Little Mermaid.""
1/27/02  OK, OK. . . am I the last one to figure out that by putting my TV color setting on the lowest setting, I can make this video black and white?  I've changed my rating to 5 stars!",1011312000,,524,3.980952380952381

697725,5,6303646689,I loved it when this came on tv every year. I am listening to the soundtrack from this production. I can't wait for this to come out. Lesley Ann Warren had the perfect innocence to play Cinderella. Anyone who remembers this and who have daughters needs to buy this.,1009324800,2,265,4.428571428571429
697726,3,6303646689,"I bought this yesterday (...) and I was thrilled to get my hands on it. I, like many of you have grown up with this enchanting version of the classic fairy tale. But the DVD picture is full of blurriness, lacking a lot of clarity, random lines cross the screen throughout, and it looks like a poor quality VHS that was recorded from TV 15 years ago. The sound is okay, but I'm just happy enough to be able to own this, so I try to look over the many picture flaws of the DVD while watching it. If you love this film, you must buy it, but be warned, it is nowhere near the capabalities of DVD or even a regular VHS.",1008979200,5,614,4.0
697727,5,6303646689,"I have not seen this as an adult. As a child it was one of the best movies i had seen, next to Wizard of Oz.",1008374400,3,108,3.1923076923076925
697728,5,6303646689,"Every year since the dawn of vhs, I have searched high and low for this movie.  It is with great joy that I have finally found it!  Leslie Ann Warren has captured the fragile, though ever gracious Cinderella in a profound and moving way.  As a child, my heart broke, as I  witnessed the misdeeds done to poor Cinderella.  New  versions of the same tale lack the touching emotion that this version so magically holds.  When Stuart Damon hits the scene as the Prince, little girls everywhere suddenly believed that dreams really do come true!  Behold, wee ones, for here is the kind, generous, and ever-so-handsome Prince!  The characters were not animated, they were not ""glammed up""; the choreography was simple, the costumes tasteful, not showy.  The actors told the story themselves - and they did so with an eloquent passion that is unforgettable.  It was magic then, and I cannot wait for my daughters to see this film - of a tale that so captured my attention at their age.",1008288000,12,978,4.6608187134502925
697729,2,6303646689,"I saw a regional theater production of Cinderella, then bought the VHS to relive the great show, and was very disappointed. Reading the other reviews, and realizing how well-known this 1964 version is, I realize I must be in the minority, but I really do not think it is a good production. I read somewhere that though the original tapes for the 1957 Julie Andrews version were lost, some sort of version does exist. I wonder if it will ever be released. I have that CD, and recommend it highly.
(2006 update to this 2002 review: 1957 version now available on DVD; rather a dated TV production, but Julie Andrews shines!)",1006992000,,621,4.603603603603603

697801,5,6303646689,"I first saw this version on Cinderella when i was five. I loved it! i remember singing along to all the songs. I was horrified when i saw the resent remake, at how badly it was done with Brandy as Cinderella. I have nothing against brandy, but she just didn't do as well as Ginger Rogers. I would strongly recommend, if you like fairy tales and musicals that you order this movie :)",1005091200,8,382,4.2465753424657535
697802,5,6303646689,"My wife believes this version of Cinderella is tied for first place with another entitled The Glass Slipper with Leslie Caron. Cinderella is more musical, whereas The Glass Slipper has more dancing and ballet, as fans of Leslie Caron would expect. Both are 5 star.",1003622400,3,264,4.888888888888889
697803,5,6303646689,"For those who, like me, grew up with this version, you are going to be thrilled it is coming out on DVD. It is the 1965 TV version directed by Charles S. Dubin starring Lesley Ann Warren and Stuart Damon. I love this version, when I was young, my mother taped it for me and I still love it. The songs are wonderful. The actors' singing may not be the best but, since I never saw the Julie Andrews version, I still prefer it to the 1997 version with Brandy and Whitney Houston.
This was an exceptionnal musical and it's great that it is being released on DVD, so if anyone knows the date, please write a review and tell me.",994982400,23,622,4.148760330578512
7851909,4,6303646689,"Note that this is a DVD of a 1965 TV production with a lovely Leslie Ann Warren at the beginning of her career in the title role. While it suffers from the limitations of most TV productions of  the era, this version is solidly cast and still quite enjoyable. It remains a family favorite in our household, first with our daughters and now with our granddaughters. If you're unsure about purchasing this version, check with your local library first. Odds are they will have a copy that you can check out.",1521158400,,504,4.538461538461538
