1890488,5,B00009V7OB,"I have always been intrigued by the Japanese samurai movie, but rarely satisfied by it.  Even ""Seven Samurai"" I found to be off-putting and at times almost impossible to watch, that screechy ingnue for instance.  And, for me, of all the actors in it, only Mifune registered.  It was in equal parts a relief and an embarrassment when he showed up on screen  Then there was the ""47 Ronin"" or was it 48 or 49?  I'm not sure.  That was total and unrelieved excruciation, almost.  In that one, it was the ingnue who provided the relief as the grief stricken fianc of the youngest ronin, determined to prove herself worthier in self sacrifice than all of them.  The power of that performance made me sorry that the whole movie hadn't centered around her rather than the dry, dull and boringly self satisfied ronin.
When I found the dvd of ""Samurai Fiction"" at Blockbuster, I was wary.  But, always hopeful, I rented it anyway.  I watched the trailer first and was appalled.  It described the movie as hilariously funny.  The footage shown was not particularly hilarious.  I steeled myself for another disappointment and clicked on play  and found enchantment  It is not hilarious, at least not to my western sensibility but it is light and humorous, accessible and at times humanly moving.  The action and the swordplay is clean and uncluttered and still exciting.
It is a very self aware send up of a genre.  But there is nothing smarmy or smirky about it nor is it overly reverential.  In fact, it is perfect in tone and  in all its performances.  It has a certain amount of cleverness going for it, the black and white photography interspersed with flashes of red at  intense moments, the musical score which uses rock and roll and even in one funny and sublime moment the music of Steven Foster.  But what really sustains it and makes it all work is its warmth and real affection for the characters and the genre.  It is a remarkable movie and a remarkable experience. At last, a samurai movie I can really enjoy.",1065225600,6,2011,4.61864406779661
1890489,5,B00009V7OB,"This DVD was filmed in black and white-the best format for Samurai movies.  Not really designed for foriegn audiences, Samurai Fiction was meant to be watched by young Japanese and make them say, ""Cool!""  But others people who are into Medival Japanese Culture may also get a kick out of it.
  The basic story is about two great swordsman and their eventual duel( What, did you expect An original story line?).  Its not the story that counts in this movie but the modern reselling of the image and fantasy of Bushido to an audience who probably never saw a Kurasawa film.  America has cowboys, Europeans have Knights, and the Japanese have Samurai.  So, if your into this, I recomend this DVD highly.",1063670400,7,700,4.688524590163935
1890490,1,B00009V7OB,"This is one of the worst films this one has had the displeasure to have purchsed and have watched.  The other reviews that praise this movie are very misleading.  To put it simply, this film stinks.  The cinematography is horrid, the music is worse (Western pop from the sixties), the story line is pitiful and there is no acting in this film.  It is not a drama nor a comedy.  It is a tragedy.  This movie was given one star because reviewers are not allowed to give no stars.  Amazon.com should be more honest in the reviews they promote if they want return customers. DON'T BUY THIS FILM.  IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY.",1304640000,3,616,4.342105263157895
1890491,5,B00009V7OB,"This is an old school meets the new school type of samurai film. It is old school in that the story is fairly traditional. I won't give it away, but a guy takes a sword he is assigned to guard and other samurais go after him. What it new school is that many of the shots and the camera angles really push the realms of cinematography. At least for 1998 when this movie was made.

A few years after this movie, the birth of the new style of samurai film came out of Japan. The movies where the characters may appear riding motorcycles while heavy metal or electronic music is playing and there is all kinds of crazy colors and cinematography. This movie is not like that, except in some cases for the music, but I can't help but believe that some of the camera angles and filming techniques used in this film may have inspired the next generation of Japanese samurai filmmaker.

This movie should be seen for two reasons. It is a samurai film made in recent years that captures the old style of story and sword fighting, and in someways even overemphasizes some of the traditional charter expressions and actions. In a good way. Which makes it fun to watch. The second reason is that it is different from samurai movies that were made before. It is one of those transitional films that set the stage for the modern era.

Mostly it is a good film. A good samurai film and those are always fun to watch.",1299542400,2,1400,4.376923076923077

1890493,4,B00009V7OB,"Winner of various film awards in Asia, including best new director, Hiroyuki Nakano's ""SAMURAI FICTION"" (1998) is a visual and aural feast for the audience. At first look, it looks very much like the classic samurai films of old, shot mostly in black and white with some use of color in certain scenes. The film is a phenomenal exercise in style, and despite its very simple premise, it stays true to classic chambara films such as ""Yojimbo"" and ""Seven Samurai"" while maintaining a touch of cool satire. This film may be one of the many inspirations for Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"". (just look at the cover)

Year of the Shogunate, 1696. When a sacred sword bestowed by the Shogunate gets stolen from a clan, Heishiro Inukai (Mitsuru Fukikoshi), the son of the clan's lord is adamant in recovering the stolen blade and seeking vengeance from the culprit, a master swordsman named Rannosuke Kazamatsuri (Tomoyasu Hotei) to restore his clan's honor. Aided by his friends, Heishiro departs in a bid for fame. Heishiro is a skilled swordsman but untested in the ways of battle while Kazamatsuri is battle-hardened and has killed several men in his time. Failing in his first encounter, and nursed back to health by a kindly master swordsman named Hanbei Mizoguchi (Morio Kazama) and his daughter, Koharu (Tamaki Ogawa), Heishiro must find the true meaning of dying for the sake of pride. Heishiro is torn between reaching a peaceful resolution or a bloody showdown.

This is Hioyuki Nakano's first full-length feature film debut after directing several music videos in Japan. Despite his inexperience in directing a full-length film, his skills shines through as he makes the simplest scenes seem like a work of art, as the scenes are given life and the characters are given room to breathe. While the story is pretty simple, it is a quest for a samurai's honor and one that seeks pride, Nakano brings a beguiling cinematic experience the way the film's plot is structured around its characters. The style is shot mostly in black and white with certain key scenes having a red splash of color (when someone is cut down) and a sort of a colored moon or sky that gives tribute to the Earth. I thought the film had beautiful cinematography, as the sceneries are further brought about to complement its style.

""Samurai Fiction"" is indeed fiction. Dubbed as ""episode one"", the film revolves around a screenplay full of satire, but interestingly, the comedic parts don't seem silly or goofy. You might say that it delivers its silliness mostly with a straight face and is a very inherent part of the film. The film has a large share of unique and interesting characters, and admittedly, some are given more exposure than others, all are developed quite well. The old ninja master, the gambling madam, Okatsu (Mari Natsuki) and her simpleton-aides, the students and the master of a fencing dojo, all characters contribute well to the plot's development and aids in our main protagonists' exposition without glorifying them.

The cast of the film is quite excellent. Heishiro is a man of honor but well too eager to serve his clans' cause. Quite gullible at times, but Mitsuru Fukikoshi's portrayal does make him feel very real. I guess his nave nature is also his main strength and also his weakness. The kindly swordsman, Hanbei (played by Morio Kazama) is a man with regrets and seeks to atone for his killing of another man. He has tried to relinquish violence and always pursues a peaceful resolution to any disagreement. Koharu is the beauteous daughter that inspires love and even-mindedness, played by Tamaki Ogawa, the character manages to charm the viewer. (Heck, even Hanbei is charmed as he experiences a nose-bleed when he sees some skin). Hotei's portrayal of Kazamatsuri is an enigmatic one. One may see small similarities to Nakadai's character in ""Sword of Doom"". One would be led to question his motivations, and the answer does make perfect sense in the climax.

With all the plot's devises, one wouldn't be hard-pressed to assume that this film is a bloody affair and an action-packed experience. Well, while there are quite a few fight sequences, the film is a quasi-bloodless affair and most of the violence is toned down. The swordplay in the film is simple, nothing too elaborate or stylized, but does have a realistic feel. Thankfully, even with the toned down action, the film is a superb cinematic experience because of its structure and lush cinematography. The film's soundtrack is an odd choice for Nakano, some beat up rock (70's rock) and some jazz were used to accompany certain key sequences. It was a little unorthodox to use traditional black and white camera work mixed in with a modern soundtrack. I guess this maybe (?) where Tarantino got his idea for ""Kill Bill"".

The film is indeed a masterwork in Japanese cinema. Samurai fans will definitely eat it up and non-fans will have to watch it at least once. The film is brilliantly simple--and so beautiful in its simplicity.

""A Superior Man can have dignified ease without pride, and a common man can have pride without dignified ease."" This is indeed Fiction...""Samurai Fiction"".

Highly Recommended! [4++ Stars]
Video/Audio. 1.85 Anamorphic widescreen. The picture is extremely sharp and full of contrast. There are noticeable image enhancements on some scenes but not enough to make it ugly. The 2.0 Dolby Digital is capable of giving the film its required `zest'. The English subtitles are perfectly timed and doesn't scroll too fast.",1241913600,2,5514,4.947084233261339
1890494,4,B00009V7OB,"Very enjoyable movie. It had a great story, enough action to keep people interested in that happy and also made me laugh quite a bit. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I hated the rock & roll music in it.",1210118400,2,222,3.9555555555555557
1890495,5,B00009V7OB,"""Samurai Fiction,"" by director Hiroyuki Nakano delivers as both a drama and an absurdly funny satire. Now, one does not usually hear the sound of an electric guitar blasting away in a samurai flick. Moreover, to be truthful, I usually like to hear the shimasen playing, or the sound of Taiko drums beating in my samurai films--but for this film, I will make an exception. The film is in black and white, and as mentioned before, one gets the sound of an electric guitar blasting away. Yet, it works. This is not your typical samurai film, in the mode of Kurosawa, nonetheless, it is an appealing tribute in many ways, especially with the  black and white film. However, it is updated to a more modern audience. The films narrative begins in the year 1696.

The film deals with three main characters. The first one is the antagonist, who is a ronin by the name Kazamatsuri (Tomoyasu Hotei). He is extremely skilled with the sword, and has killed many. Further, he has stolen the sword given to the Inukai clan by Lord Tokugawa, over 80 years ago. For the honor of the clan, the sword must be returned. If the sword is not taken back, the clan will be dissolved. Which introduces us to the second charcter named Heishiro Inukai (Mitsuru Fukikoshi). He claims that he will take back the sword, and dispense with Kazamatsuri. This to the chagrin of the father, who is the head of the clan. Therefore, he sends two ninjas to look out for his son. Heishiro Inukai is not as good with the sword as Kazamatsuri. The father knows this, therefore, for the protection of his son, these ninjas are to look out for him. The third samurai, who no longer wishes to wield a sword is Hanbei Mizoguchi.

Hanbei Mizoguchi is one of the funniest characters in the film. However, the entire film has its share of funny characters and moments. It is due to the intervention of Hanbei that Heishiro Inukai is spared after an altercation with Kazamatsuri. Heishiro Inukai vows to hunt Kazamatsuri down until he has the sword, and avenges one of his friends death at the hands of Kazamatsuri. Hanbei is skilled, and Kazamatsuri knows this and promises that he will return the sword if Hanbei will fight him in a duel. However, Hanbei has had his fill of killing many years ago. There are some funny interactions between Hanbei and Heishiro that were just hilarious. Along the way on his journey, Heishiro falls in love with Hanbei's daughter, which is a story in itself I don't wish to divulge.

Will Heishiro and Kazamatsuri have a duel? Or will Hanbei decide to pick up the sword again even though he has vowed not to do so? There are some very good action scenes in the film, but it is the satire I especially enjoyed. Now, I know there are purists out there who do not like this film because it is not your usual samurai film. And thats okay. I like Kobayashi and Kurosawa to name just two great directors of samurai films. But once in awhile a film like this is refreshing. I found the film entertaining, exciting and funny. And once again, this is a different sort of samurai film that is just as good as some of the old classics. I recommend the film highly. I own it, but to be on the safe side, I recommend that you rent it first. It is a great film, and will one day belong right up their with some of the all-time classic samurai films, if it isn't already. [Stars: 5+]",1191110400,4,3355,4.486088379705401
1890496,5,B00009V7OB,"If you like people flying around and play fighting then don't get this!!  This is how the samurai fought, thought, and lived.  Great cinematography, music and storyline!!  I never get enough of this one!",1182038400,5,203,4.911764705882353

1890498,5,B00009V7OB,"I love this move because it is unique. Somehow, this sentence says it all. This is a unique movie and very original, even it is somehow a parody but also a serious one about Samurai movies. The whole movie is B&W and the actors are sometimes playing like in a 'silent movie' with strong, overdone expressions esp. Tamaki Ogawa. However this is not overdone and the movie itself is IMO far away from being too serious. In fact it is hilarious and fun to watch. I have to admit that for people who do not know very much about Japanese culture, this movie might be boring and senseless. This is not a martial arts movie even there are some fighting scenes in this movie. They story is told using a valuable sword stolen by the incredible Tomoyasu Hotei, who acts in this movie as the villan and wrote most of the music for this movie too. He also wrote the IMO unforgettable music for the big battle in 'Kill Bill 1'.

If you can lower your expectations and let yourself dive into the story, watched some Kurosawa Samurai movies before and share a general addiction to Asian culture, you should give this movie a try and I believe, you will be positively surprised. For the real lover of Japanese movies this DVD comes in the only way, it is suitable for the fan: Original Japanese language with English subtitles. If this annoys you, put it back on the shelf.

For all others, highly recommended. It features a wonderful love story, some criminal story and how the underdog Samurai can beat the master Samurai in the best sense of a drama.

For me, this is an absolute gem and stands for it's own. As I wrote at the beginning: Unique.

I am writing this here, because you can't buy this movie in Germany but I can order it in the US and I highly appreciate that I can do this and Amazon is just a very reliable company. I am not paid to write this, it reflects my true opinion :-)",1152748800,12,1878,4.357142857142857
1890499,5,B00009V7OB,"I have watched many samurai movies and I am a huge fan of the genre. This movie uses many different styles to tell it's very simple story.
  The music ranges widely. The film, though set in the past, has a modern feel to it. It's also very funny (the guy who keeps appearing/ dropping from the cealing and nearly falling over). The actors do a good job and are believable. Overall, a very fun, watchable movie. If you are into the genre, you'll like it even more.",1133222400,7,463,4.310344827586207
1890500,2,B00009V7OB,"If you want to see a contemporary samurai film with great acting and a moving storyline, check out 'Twilight Samurai.' If you want to see a rock-n-roll samurai movie that is cool, funky and a slap in the face to the Edo gravitas of that well-known Tom Cruise vehicle, check out 'Zatoichi.' If you want to see a film that fails to be either of these, 'Samurai Fiction' is for you.

Director Nakano is a cross-over from music videos, and by God, it shows. Slow-motion flames, swooping crane shots, random spots of colour on a black-and-white canvas. Characterisation? Forget it. Every one of these characters is two-dimensional. Acting? The pros put in performances, but the musicians who are scattered throughout the cast to thrill Japanese teenagers are very wooden. Hotei looks downright nervous at times, and I could swear he is looking to the side for direction in some scenes. Direction? Ham-fisted, unless you are looking for an extended music video.

The comic elements barely raised a smile. The antics of the aging ninja were mildly amusing, but the shock-horror of a potentially homosexual samurai villain was embarrassing, and hardly iconoclastic - how many decades is it since Clavell had samurai offer up a duck for sexual pleasure in 'Shogun'?

'Samurai Fiction' is a watchable piece of fluff that will remain in the memory fleetingly after viewing. It didn't annoy me; that's about the best thing I can say for it.",1133136000,12,1428,4.91701244813278

1890502,4,B00009V7OB,"A good friend of mine recommended this to me and I checked it out.  The film's own PR is ""a samurai movie for the MTV generation""  -- I think we're talking the early days of MTV, not ""Road Rules"" or ""Cribs"" MTV.

This is a lively, funny movie that pokes fun of the genre while proposing new virtues of the samurai world (family, integrity, and --most important -- coolness).  There are a lot of unusual casting choices made -- all of them very good choices.  Having rock star Hotei Tomoyasu as the ""villain"" was a brilliant move.  He has a very minimal style, but he really is fun to watch.  The other great choice is Natsuki Maki as the gangster boss O-katsu.  As the costume designer says in the extra features, ""Women have 2 times when they really blossom:  when they're young, first budding; right before they die out, they bloom gorgeously.""  That's Natsuki Maki --> she's a real joy to watch, especially when she picks up her knickers during her dances.

Is this a good movie to own?  I dunno.  Rental maybe.  The one flaw with the film is that it is too long; it tells the story, essentially, of 3 samurai when you wish it would tell 1 character's story at a time.  Maybe the ""2nd SF"" movie ""Red Shadow"" does a better job.  Definitely a fun rental.

Last note:  The soundtrack is great.  Hotei's music (obtainable on ""Electric Samurai"") contains many songs from the movie plus others (Kill Bill ""Battle ...Honor""); I wish I could get my hands on the whole Samurai Fiction soundtrack though.  It's very lyrical.",1117670400,6,1517,4.527675276752768
1890503,5,B00009V7OB,"A new bar has been set for the nomination of ""coolest actor alive.""

Bruce Willis?  Nah.  John Travolta?  Ferggedaboudit.

Tomoyasu Hotei, the anti-hero or ""Samurai Fiction"", is a force of nature in this pop comedy-drama Samurai epic.  He isn't given a lot of dialogue, but his 6' 2"" lean angular presence, intensity and eyebrow-twitching expressions steal scenes from the remainder of the capable cast, including a mime artist (the main character).  And Hotei did all the music, which is a fine rock score, and not for nothing is a Hotei tune included in ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1."".  He is pretty handy with a katana, too.  Hotei may be the Next Big cross-over star from Japan.  And check out a clip from his music video in the ""special features.""  Who else can do this?

The movie includes samurai duels, ninjas, and modernist shots one can see in Tarantino, red, B&W.  It is not particularly gory (unlike Tarantino), and has an interesting little moral message about non-violence toward the end of the film (way not Tarantino).  Like Tarantino, there is a declared effort to not take things too seriously and maintain a high ""coolness"" quotionent (Hotei's sidekick in the movie gets to exclaim the word at length.)

This is a very creative and fun take of a Samurai period-piece.",1115769600,3,1276,4.815668202764977
1890504,4,B00009V7OB,"Samurai Fiction begins in the year 1999. Inukai Heishiro-san (Fukikoshi Mitsuru) speaks to us from the great beyond about his life as a young samurai in feudal Japan. As he tells us how his life was changed by his encounter with two ronin, we are carried back in time from the present to the past, from color to monochrome, digital to analog, until we find Heishiro practicing fencing among giant shoots of bamboo.

It's important to remember that Samurai Fiction is not a return to the period classics of Kurosawa and the like. Rather, it is an homage to that genre, full of references and allusions and humor. If you prefer dour, scowling celluloid samurai--well, you can find them here, but this might not be the film for you.

The plot is deceptively simple. The villian of the piece, the ""cool samurai"" Kazamatsuri (Tomoyasu Hotei), presents unexpected depth as he goes from rescuing a father and daughter from a band of brigands and finding an honored place in the Inukai clan, to stealing the clan's treasured heirloom sword, to falling in and out with the yakuza.

Likewise, Heishiro, a brash young man, takes it upon himself to recover the clan's stolen property and honor against his father's wishes. He is eventually turned from his self-destructive path by the ""peaceful samurai"", Mizoguchi Hanbei (Kazama Morio) and his engaging daughter, Koharu (Ogawa Tamaki).

Along the way there are conspiracies, sword fights, gangsters, and nose bleeds. Oh, yeah -- and ninja.

The score, also created by Tomoyasu Hotei (late of Kill Bill fame), is unusual for a period movie, with growling electric guitars and burbling synthesizers. It's tongue-in-cheek, sometimes startling, and punctuates the rock-and-roll sensibility of the director, Nakano Hiroyuki.

No, it's not Noh. Nor is it Kurosawa. But it is loads of fun. In its promotional material it is described as ""peaceful, funky, and cool"", and if that doesn't create a strange set of expectations for a samurai flick, nothing will.",1109635200,4,1989,5.0303951367781155

Back to the Japanese youths. This was a movie with great satire and humor, including action and a good story. It didn't take itself seriously. It just said ""get in, sit down and shut up"".

I should have sticked to Douglas's Review and the other review.  This film is not a classic.  Stick to Kurosawa films and ignore this one.  I don't wanna sound harsh but I didn't enjoy this film one bit, it wasn't funny though it was trying to be, obviously this film is trying to be hip and new which is totally fails at, I thought the characters wern't great at all and I had no sympathy except for one of the characters and for some reason that villian looked so annoying!  I just wanted to slap him in the face!

And what's with the music!  It was like watching a really bad MTV original movie.  I agree with the reviewer saying this was more for the MTV generation since the Film had terrible lame music.  Overall the Music was one of the reasons that really got me ticked.

Samurai Fiction is entertaining I guess but not the epic classic I was expecting.  I loathed almost everything about it.  The characters, music, and especially that idiotic villian who was seemed very gay(literaly).  Overall this was one of those films that I didn't enjoy one bit.  Though I like the clever the black and white, and some witty dialoug which I enjoyed for about 3 seconds.  I will probably get some negative review(unless people are mature enough to mind there own buinsness and let people give there opinions instead of bashing them)and in the end...I give this film a

Now, that being stated, I must point out the evolutionary weights and measures, so to speak, upon which this film stands to reason. Certain persons have pointed out that this is not traditional and feel cheated by the ""light-hearted"" aspects therein. On the contrary, this film maintains a certain subtle tonality that is not easily recognized as depthy or textured. It remains epic in nature, yet steps outside the genre to throw a nod back to traditional pioneer filmakers and to break a little ground, as the very definition of pioneer is as thus. Plus, it rocks, literally. That being said, one should enjoy this movie, not sit there wishing it was done by Akira himself. And, I'm pretty sure if the man were still kicking, he would commend this effort of bringing a newfound faith into the cinema of today. Buy this film, fans and non-fans alike should enjoy it.",1098921600,3,948,4.716867469879518
1890510,4,B00009V7OB,"I saw this DVD in the shelves several months ago and was intrigued.  Later I saw both installments of the ""Kill Bill"" saga and was particularly taken with a jam from the first volume's soundtrack called ""Battle Without Honor Or Humanity"" (which can now be heard in Jaguar ads, by the way).

Eventually I had heard that not only were some of Tarantino's scenes from ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" taken directly from ""Samurai Fiction"", but the composer of ""Battle Without Honor..."" also scored the film and had a major starring role in it.  I decided I had to give it a look.

And it was worth it.  The movie is a different take on Akira Kurosawa's old skool samurai epics from the '50's and '60's.  In some ways it's a bit of a send-up, but this is no lampoon in the vein of ""Airplane"" nor is it a knock-off/homage similar to...well, pretty much every movie Quentin Tarantino has ever made.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, but the plot twist that brings the movie to its conclusion is hardly that of traditional martial arts movies (there seems to be more of ""kinder and gentler"" school of martial arts flicks being produced today...Jet Li's ""Hero"" is not dissimilar to ""Samurai Fiction"" in this regard).

There are enough old-skool elements that tie this film to its predecessors, but the film is marketed as ""an MTV generation samuari movie"", and I don't really see the connection (other than having prominent Japanese musicians playing roles and the score being more contemporarily pop-oriented rather than Japanese classical music), but the attitute is decidedly lighter.  This is a good thing; Jackie Chan has longsince proved that comedy has a place in an otherwise serious action movie, and the humor in ""Samurai Fiction"" is nowhere nearly as obvious or Chaplin-esque as in Chan's work.

For me the real revelation was Tomoyasu Hotei, Japan's pop/rock superstar guitarist.  He plays a master swordsman (Kazamatsuri) without alliance or direction who sets the events of the movie in motion by stealing a ceremonial samurai sword from the clan who enlisted him to be its guardian.  No reason is ever given for his doing this; his motive seems to be simply ""because I can"".

He is not a typical martial arts antagonist; there are aspects of his character that make him seem to be far more honorable (and at times even more likeable) than Heishiro, the film's protagonist sworn to kill Kazamatsuri and return the sword to his clan.  Complicating matters is the baggage taken on by Heishiro in the form of his two childhood friends and a pair of quasi-competent ninja sent by Heishiro's father to keep an eye on him.  But I found Heishiro, though obviously intended to be cast as the ""hero"", to be rather an annoying personality.  Chihuahua-like in both his manner and effectiveness, he was an annoyance whose physical (and especially mental) shortcomings were obvious to any other character in the film save himself.

The plot development (and the angle that makes this a ""peaceful samurai"" movie as described in the DVD's bonus materials) takes a unique twist when a mysterious stranger intervenes on Kazamatsuri's inevitable defeat of Heishiro and his companions and, with the help of his daughter, nurses the injured man back to health.  Heishiro of course wants his revenge, but his saviors are pacifists who encourage the renunication of violence...even though Kazamatsuri is suspicious of the stranger's identity and begins to obsess over the idea of challenging him to a duel...

But Hotei is just amazing.  It's difficult to tell what (if any) acting ability he has due to the minimal dialogue written for his character, but he definitely has presence.  You can't take your eyes off him whenever he is onscreen.  He is literally head and shoulders taller than anyone else onscreen, and he moves as effortlessly as the wind.  And his eyes...he could cut diamonds with that stare.  Terrific performance.

Watching this was a pleasing experience.  The action is decent and the fight scenes are passable; none of the actors are professional martial artists and the production values aren't those of a Hong Kong action flick wherein a great number of special effects are used to enhance the action.  But it is a well-shot film, mostly black-&-white with enough color scenes thrown in at intense moments to delight the arthouse crowd.  The DVD extras are multiple (the documentary footage seems a bit redundant; an extra feature on scoring the movie would have been more appreciated by this reviewer); a nice ""extra touch"" are two scenes shown in color just to give an idea as to how the movie would look if shot naturally.

In short, this is a very interesting movie.  It's artsy enough for the hipster sect, and it's got enough action to appeal to martial arts buffs.  And it's not excessively violent despite the swordplay, nor is it sexually explicit despite a fair amount of the story taking place in a brothel (failed to mention that part, did I?  You'll just have to see it in order to find out how that angle plays into the story).  It's worth a viewing to anyone who's a fan of or at all curious about the genre.",1096243200,23,5121,4.822654462242563
1890511,1,B00009V7OB,"Like one review on this film,I was turned off very early because of the tone of the film(to lighthearted for my taste).

I'm a big fan of the Kuroswawa film epics,and this film(or so I thought),would be like that in every sense. The main character had no screen presence at all. The music score just didn't do it for me. Look at the making of the film,it was stated that this was a MTV generation film,they were right on the money. To bad I'm not of that generation...You cant always go by other people glowing recommendation,I should have gotten ""Seven Samuari""..",1095206400,7,564,4.584158415841584
1890512,5,B00009V7OB,"Samurai Fiction is a brilliant ""re-imagining"" of the Samurai film genre. It simultaneously honors and makes light of traditions of the Samurai films of the past, while stylistically striking off on its own. The black and white cinematography (originally color, but made Black and White per-Nakano's request) is truely striking! At times the white will be filled with a sharp, biting red tone. Indeed, the opening of the film (which was inspired by Seijun Suzuki's stylistic absurdities) where two samurai fight against a retro-60's-style-screen backlit with red was stolen and used in Kill Bill vol. 1 (but Tarrantino changed the color)!

This really is a film not to be missed. Fans of the Samurai genre can appreciate the traditions honored by the film, and laugh along with Nakano at some of the absurdities of the genre. People unfamiliar with Samurai will still have a blast here, though, becuase the humor is universal and the characters are quite convincing.

The film won praise and scowls for its use of a primarily rock-driven soundtrack in this jidai-geki, but I think it works brilliantly. It complements the film's visual style, helps to set the tone, and just sounds incredible! Kill Bill also took something from the soundtrack, as the original trailer music (the best song in either film, for me money!) was written and peformed by Hotei Tomoyasu (who stars in and provided the score for SF).

Nakano has made othere interesting films, Red Shadow and Stereo Future are both very entertaining and have some strong aspects, but he has yet to make a film as all-around well done and satisfying as Samurai Fiction.

A note on the DVD: Media Blasters has really begun to prove itself. I still remember when it was putting out bare-bones, letterboxed, menu-less DVDs (like Fudoh), but now that really know how to please audio/visual buffs! The transfer on Samurai Fiction is beautiful, and while it is not the best MB has done (Red Shadow, another period film from Nakano, has for my money their best transfer so far) it is on par with any major studio release. There are also some very interesting and entertaining extras on the second disc that take you behind the scenes to stand witness to Nakano's unique artistry.

A must own DVD!",1093219200,6,2246,4.9
1890513,5,B00009V7OB,"Being a huge fan of samurai films, an Asian, and an art student, its no surprise that I truly enjoyed and appreciated this film. The camera work was lovely, I absolutely love black and white, and the story had enough elements; cliched, yes, but meant to be I think, to keep things running smoothly. The modern music also surprisingly worked pretty well, unlike in other efforts than have attempted to accompany newer music into a film with an old timeframe (A Knights Tale, for example). Come to think of it, the pop culture edge the film contained was actually quite cool and to me is what really helps this film standout from others in the genre. Many issues are touched upon, like revenge, redemption, friendship, peace, love, and honor, and its just fun to watch. A great way to occupy your time.

Oh, and for the boring, uncreative, closed minded worker bee who gave this film one star WITHOUT even watching the entire film, I hope you enjoy the remainder of your life as a number in a world with a beauty you will never understand.",1092960000,6,1037,4.575268817204301

Upon hearing this, a young swordsman and his two best friends go on a journey to retrieve the sword.  Their first confrontation causes each of the three warriors to take a path separate from the other.
The plot is fairly basic (the stealing of the sword reminds me of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""), but the way director Hiroyuki Nakano sees it is very original.  Shot mostly in black and white, it's an obvious way to get the audience to appreciate his artistic vision.
Perhaps my favorite aspect of ""Samurai Fiction"" is the musical score, composed by Tomoyasu Hotei, who you may know as ""...the guy that made that song from Kill Bill"" (Battle Without Honor or Humanity, the part where O-Ren is entering the house of blue leaves).  Every fight scene and many simply well directed scenes are pulled from 1696 to modern day with hard rock or techno anthems.

1890518,5,B00009V7OB,"I'm not sure why this movie is as far under the radar as it seems to be, but here's hoping it doesn't stay there.
I bought this film sight-unseen, which is pretty rare. Like most people, I like to have some idea of what I'm plunking down my money for. For some reason, though, this movie sort of snuck off the shelf, took the twenty-five bucks out of my pocket, and came home with me before I'd even realized it. Maybe it was the cool, minimalist cover, or maybe I was still coming down off my ""Kill Bill vol. 1"" kick and wanted a Samurai film, I don't know. Either way, I found myself watching it last night, and I was floored by what I was seeing.
You know those happy coincidences, where you realize you wound up with a lot more than you thought you were going to get? Like when you go to a new sushi place and realize they've got the best stuff around for less money than that other place you've been going to for years, plus you get more maki roll for your money? This movie brings a similar feeling to mind; ""This is great! I'm glad I took a chance here.""
The story revolves around a young Samurai named Heishiro Inukai, who is on a quest to retrieve a clan treasure stolen by a wandering, steely-eyed Ronin by the name of Rannosuke. It's classic Samurai fare through and through, and for a Japanese film is remarkably straightforward, though it's never dull. Quite the opposite, actually.
Director Hiroyuki Nakano uses the relative simplicity of the story as a blank canvas, and paints in a masterfully blended portrait of a classic Akira Kurosawa Samurai epic lovingly clothed in a hip, MTV Asia-style update. The effect sounds overwrought on paper, but Nakano pulls it off without seeming to bastardize the source material. In fact, it's one of the more respectful homage films to date, cinematography wise.
Kurosawa film buffs (and I'll just get this out of the way right now, I am a MASSIVE Kurosawa fan) will instantly pick out the lifted scenes, from the busy, always-moving village shots of Seven Samurai to the dark, packed-earth barren landscapes of Throne of Blood. There's even some subtle references to Kurosawa's editing style, with extremely longs shots arranged horizontally, reverse-field cuts, and even a single (and therefore very obvious, and also very funny if you get it) horizontal wipe. Of course, it goes without saying that the movie is almost completely shot in black and white.
Because really, why would one make a color Samurai Film?
The best part about the movie, however, are the characters in it. Every cast member turns in a fantastic performance, and the people they portray are as memorable as you could want in a film. We've got your headstrong young Samurai on a quest for honor and glory with his two friends (one of whom is actually named Kurosawa, go figure) and along the way they come up against a conniving brothel mistress, a retired master fencer, his ridiculously attractive daughter, and the super-powerful, taciturn, skilled, very tall, and possibly gay antagonist. We also get an old master ninja who steals every scene he's in, and his two bumbling ninja students who manage to seem like they know what they're doing...Most of the time.
It all blends in a great way because the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. It's not goofy or silly, and the fighting is quite realistic, but it's also a very funny movie. Heishiro's aptitude to spring nosebleeds at inopportune moments (and his love interest's apparent ignorance as to what that means) made me chuckle, and the movie's playfulness over the sexual orientation of Rannosuke is hysterical -- but you have to be quick or you miss some of it. The old ninja master is my personal favorite; you can't beat a guy who makes his first appearance by basically falling out of a hole in the ceiling.
I don't want to ruin any more of the movie than I already have, but suffice to say that nearly everyone can enjoy Samurai Fiction on whichever level they like. It's simple and funny enough that even young kids can watch it (provided they don't mind subtitles - there is no dub, thankfully) but there's plenty of depth here to satisfy veterans of the genre.
On a final, technical note, the DVD transfer is very good, though there is no surround sound, only Stereo Japanese. No matter, however, since the stereo mix is perfectly clear. One of the best things about the disc is actually the subtitles; they absolutely nailed it. My Japanese is admittedly quite poor, but it's good enough that I can pick out poorly-translated subtitles from a mile away. Thankfully, no such problems exist here. The titles flow well and keep the pace of the movie to right where it should be.
There are a few extras that come with the film, one of which is inexplicably on Disc 1 while the rest are regulated to Disc 2. The main draw here, called ""Samurai Non-Fiction"", appears to be a spot shown on Japanese television regarding the making of the film. It's worth watching, and rounds out a nice package that is of much higher quality than a film like this would normally get with a U.S. release.
Grab a copy of this film as soon as you can. This is one of those rare movies that has blanket appeal without diluting it's core concept, and looks great in any collection.",1082505600,37,5253,4.6373390557939915

Originally recommended by one of my fellow students at my Iai-jutsu class, I rented this movie, and it instantly became one of my favorites. Unlike many martial arts movies, it avoids taking itself too seriously, therefore avoiding many downfalls that are common with 'americanized' martial arts movies. It is, in fact, what I would classify as a comedy. Nevertheless, it is surprisingly historically accurate, and the martial arts demonstrated are much closer to traditional study than anything I've seen in any other martial arts movie, period. Definitely worth seeing!",1068854400,8,619,5.2
7993068,2,B00009V7OB,"An irreverent take on the samurai genre with a religious bent, and sprinkled with lots of humor an ""don't take it so seriously"" bits in order to sell the religious message at the end.  Although told from a Japanese pagan or spiritualism point of view, it is in fact meant to sell christianity without using aspects from the judeo-christian tradition.

The humor is typical the Japanese non-sequiter kind of stuff that doesn't have so much of a punch as a kind of bizarre take on whatever it's meant to be commenting on.  As a for instance this film takes place in the mid to late 1600s, and yet there's pop cultural references, even a rendition of ""Swanee River"" with a musical saw.  On top of all that there's a Japanese hard rock score underlying the story adding to the irreverent aspect, but also adding to the adventure feel of the film; i.e. this is serious, but not so serious kind of stuff.

I like good samurai flicks, and this is not a good samurai flick.  It's well put together for what it is, and again this is a ""boy meets girl"" kind of story with a side bar of a plot of having to overcome the sociopath who puts a kink in the local nobility social works.

Overall I found this film tiring.  I'm familiar with the irreverence of Japanese comical film making, and am thoroughly dissapointed with the religious bent at the end, the combining of both makes for a cliche film, even though it does have a number of surprises.  However, if you're familiar with Japanese cinema in the least, then the surprises probably won't be all that surprising, so much as ""oh, they had to throw that in there"".

The other bottom line is that I like serious samurai films, and this film reminds me a lot of what was done in the US and UK during the 60s and 70s, taking a traditionally serious genre, and turning it into a comical genre for the sake of it, and also because someone thought that the audiences were taking the ""serious genre"" too ""seriously"".

Whatever.

If you like irreverent Japanese cinema (and I really don't, at least not this particular film), then give this thing a try.  Otherwise anime offerings which have the same film making style and can ramp up the humor, should offer better options for the same sub-genre.

7993074,2,B00009V7OB,"I bought this encouraged by good reviews - but I was terribly disappointed! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

In feudal Japan a wandering samurai named Rannosuke Kazamatsuri stole a precious sword. Inukai Henshiro, a young samurai from the clan to which this treasure belongs, goes on a quest to find the thief and recover the stolen property - but this is a perilous task, as Kazamatsuri is a skilled swordsman and a very huge, powerful man... On his way Henshiro will meet an old master at arms, who may be one of few people able to teach him how to defeat his colossal enemy...

This film is a very strange thing and I couldn't really decide what it is. Is it a kind of comedy parodying the clichs of samurai films? Or is it maybe a ""real"" samurai film trying to parody a comedy? Or is it something else still? The one thing which is certain for me, is that I was unable to find any humour in it... Of course, it is not entirely serious either, but it is definitely NOT funny. In all the film there was only ONE scene which was a nice joke - and it lasts like 5 seconds...

The story and the actions of main protagonists didn't make any sense for me: why did Kazamtsuri steal the sword when he clearly has no use for it and doesn't even care for money? Why is the old master at arms seemingly so opposed to violence when Henshiro wants to fight, but has no problem with violence at all when he himself faces this colossal foe? What is the POINT of all this story?

This film also mixes styles - parts of it are in colour but most of it is in black and white. OK, granted, this gives a couple of nice scenes - but definitely not enough to make it a good film. The inclusion of rock music in a samurai film was supposed to make it special - but for me it didn't work AT ALL!

Even if at 111 minutes it is not all that long, this film bored me and I had to fast forward some moments. I really didn't enjoy it much. Two stars just for technical originality. AVOID!",1402963200,,1989,4.1827676240208875

This means that all his energy is directed towards perfecting his swordsmanship and until he does, he is forced to avoid all the standard vices such as getting drunk, chasing women, getting married etc because those things would reduce his focus on the way of the sword.  Women, money, houses, land etc will come after he feels he has mastered his craft, which involves seeking out other master swordsmen to learn their form and defeat them.  The villian's one vice in the movie is to make sarcastic jokes to shock those around him (this, and the strict monkish life of the way of the sword, has mistakenly led some viewers to think he is a homosexual character).  I suppose his only other vice would be killing people.  But then he really never kills unless he is attacked first anyhow.

Pros:

* Excellent cinematography - several shots in this film are breathtaking and near-perfect.  This film felt like it was done by a Director of Photography.
* Casting - all the major characters in this film are almost bleeding charisma.  The evil temptress, the stoic samurai, and the three friends are all a joy to behold.
* Personality - each character doesn't have that sometimes tedious and flat honor-bound Japanese.  There's comedy, flaws, and nuance in each one.  Each character has a pulse.

Cons:

* Story - not much here.  Despite liking them, I really didn't care what happened to the characters as the predictable outcome was visible from about halfway through.
* Action is a stilted and painful.  Even in a Samurai film 10 years before this one, you expect some serious capability with swords.  There are some skilled folks in this but when attacking, everybody's obviously aiming for a bug next to the person they're trying to stab.  It looks like they just used the rehearsal reels and never actually filmed the scene.
