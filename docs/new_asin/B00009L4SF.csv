7991136,3,B00009L4SF,"Kids world was a movie that i had never heard of and i thougt it was going to be the worst movie ever created, but i thought that,when i first saw it ,it was pretty good. Although it was the sound in the movie that could have been better. But i still think the story was a 3 out of 5 because some scenes did not make any sense like the hands pulling the kids into the hole. I give Kid's World a 4 out of 5",1174262400,2,405,3.6666666666666665
