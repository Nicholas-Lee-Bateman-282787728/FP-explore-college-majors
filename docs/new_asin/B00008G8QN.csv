1844476,5,B00008G8QN,This will be greater than Card Captor Sakura! I saw the trailer for Super Gals on the Sailor Moon Season 1 uncut boxset. It was very funny. Its a must see!,1060300800,,155,4.032258064516129
1844477,5,B00008G8QN,"Super Gals is mainly based on 3 teenagers.  Kotobuki Ran and Mami Honda often have fights against one another due to the fact that they're both leaders of 2 different places in Japan, Shibuya and Bukure(sumthin like that).  This anime doesn't really have a plot to follow, but each episode gives people a laugh of humour and comedy.  Though later, it might sorta become a love story between couples.  And you know,a guy likes a girl but the girl likes someone else and there's a fight... blah blah blah.  Anyways, it's a anime that must be watched.",1059955200,2,548,4.608247422680412
1844478,5,B00008G8QN,"Super GALS! is based on the manga GALS! that ran in Ribon, the same mag Kodocha ran in. GALS! may not be as hyper and silly as Kodocha, but it has crazy moments just like Kodocha and should soothe your cravings for Kodocha until it arrives on these shores.
GALS! is the story of a group of kogals (trendy girls) living in Shibuya. Ran Kotobuki is their ""leader."" While she considers herself to be a good kogal, she's going against her parent's wishes to become a police officer like the rest of the family. Ran rebels against their pressure and vows to be a gal as long as she lives. Miyu Yamazaki used to be in a gang and she got into fights frequently. But after falling in love after being taken into a police station, she straightened up and became a good gal. Aya Hoshino, not being able to have a part time job, turned to doing escort services as many bad gals do; but after crossing Ran's path, she learned that she doesn't need to do bad things and becomes a good gal.
Ran, Miyu, and Aya rule Shibuya defending it from crime and other gals who wanna take over. But no one will be greated than the #1 kogal in Japan: Kotobuki Ran.
If you're just waiting on the edge of your seat for some Kodocha, try some GALS! It's hyper shoujo for the fashionable!",1059523200,6,1257,4.285714285714286
7983106,5,B00008G8QN,"I remember I first started watching this anime On Demand for Comcast around 2007. I was curious to see what it was because I had been on a Sailor Moon kick, so I started with episode 18 cause that was the first one available. After those 22 minutes were over I had fallen in love! Super Gals is undoubtedly my favorite anime show ever! Now as other people are saying, it might be because I was a preteen girl when I first started watching it, but after a decade, I decided to buy the DVD series on a nostalgic whim and I still love it. Even though Ran is a fictional character, I'll admit to envying her as a person! I think learning about the whole ""gal"" or ""kogal"" culture is super interesting too! I haven't gotten a chance to look at the DVD extras yet, but they seem pretty interesting.

At the very least, they need to do an English dub of the second season or bring it back for another season because this show is literally one of the best animes I've ever seen. PLEASE ADV FILMS! DUB THE SECOND SEASON!",1368403200,,1010,4.233160621761658
7983107,5,B00008G8QN,i got this really cheap! i thought i was only getting vol1 with boxart i got the whole damn series lol,1367107200,,102,3.9047619047619047
7983108,5,B00008G8QN,"When I first bought this I didn't know what to expect, but now I see that despite the ""girlish"" tone of voices. This show is actually good, and it's more about friendship and life lessons than boys and fashion. So, if you want to buy this I would highly recomend this to you.",1146960000,,275,4.2075471698113205
7983109,3,B00008G8QN,"Are you interested in fashion? Cute boys? Cliques? Lots of bright colors? If you do you will absolutely love this anime! If not, I suggest you move on and try something else. This is the kind of show I would have enjoyed when I was twelve years old. I'm no longer naive enough to believe a kick here, and a speech there, will suddenly change people. The main character Ran is a loud, obnoxious, cute, super strong girl who lives life all in a flurry. Her main concern is to have fun, fun, fun and more fun. She's the only character I really liked, all the other characters are quite boring and don't do much than stand around in the background unless a particular episode happens to revolve around them. Too bad for Ran-chan...if only this character had been in a different show...

The best thing about this show is the ending theme song, ""Dakishimetai"". It's slow, touching, and very sad. The animation itself is decent and colors very bright.",1134777600,4,945,4.5588235294117645
7983110,5,B00008G8QN,"This series is about the amazing adventures of Ran Kotobuki and her friends, who are high school freshmen and live in the hip, trendy Shibuya district of Tokyo. Ran is the self-proclaimed ""world's greatest Gal"" [SEE: ""kogal"" subculture], and she's more than willing to take on any challengers. She hangs out with her friends, Miyu (speaks in the third person most of the time) and Aya (excellent scholar). This trio has frequent run-ins with a pair of ""teen idol"" boys, Okahata (very cool and laid-back) and Yuya (spastic, major crush on Ran), a trio of heavily-tanned ""ganguro"" [SEE: ""ganguro"" facet of ""kogal"" subculture] gals, and a pair of gals from another district who are always making trouble.

Defying her family (mostly police officers, including her mom, dad & brother), Ran's goal in life is to live each moment to the fullest, and let the future take care of itself. Don't miss an episode; that's an ironclad rule for gals! My rating: 10/10.",1129248000,4,954,4.888888888888889
7983111,5,B00008G8QN,"Super gals is definetly a girl directed anime with a good message, but quite a bit of swearing. But for all those that can handle that, it's pretty cool. Ran and the others are very cute and very funny and enjoyable to watch. If you can't stand prep-type voices, this might not be the anime for you, but if you can get past that, it's a good show. I recommend this for all gals out there! So, 5 stars is good for this. I'm getting number 2! Ja ne! ^_^",1125360000,2,451,4.022222222222222
7983112,5,B00008G8QN,"This is definitely a breath of fresh air from mecha and fantasy, just in case you wanted a break. The truth is, even though this looks like the type of series where three girls prance around with no purpose, I'd be right to correct you. Honestly, there's not much of a plot, but it's interesting because it leaves you with mountains and rivers and valleys of questions.
The style is definitely one of its own, especially when it comes to the art. The music is bouncy and the ideas are original, and all the characters are very likable. Even the main antagonist you meet in episode 5 is awesome!
The first episode is a blow, but really all it's doing is introducing the characters. And then there's the slang, which isn't offensive, but pretty annoying. Once you progress through the series it's either you're used to it, or you've heard so much that you don't notice it. In either case, it's not bad after the first DVD. Speaking of which, there's a lot of swearing, a lot more than I expected for this series, and I suppose that's why it's 15+. The English VA's are fine, but I'm a dub lover, so you'll have to determine that for yourself ^_^; I also listened to the Japanese actors and they do phenominal work. The Aya voice is a lot better, anyway.
If you're looking for something fun and lighthearted without fan service, then here you go.",1083628800,8,1343,4.485714285714286
7983113,4,B00008G8QN,"I have to admit I hesitated over started this series for a while until there was nothing else out there that I really wanted and decided to give this a shot.  Now, I have to wonder what I was hesitating for because this is one wild, funny, and at times, thought provoking anime.
I don't think I've laughed as much at any one time as I did when I first sat down to watch the first five episodes of this series.  Just watching Ran do her thing and try to live her life as a gal, as her family tries to convince her to follow in the tradition of the family and become a police officer, is a real hoot.  Ran also demonstrates a serious side as she tries to convice a fellow classmate not to sell herself short or to sell her body, that it's all right not to have much money and that you can still have fun.
All five episodes maintain an almost frantic pace except for the last one where things get a little serious and it seems like the group is going to be split up.  However, Ran is never one to back off from a challenge or to give up on her friends without a fight.
All the characters in this show are great, from Ran, the terminal gal, her best friend, Miyu who's in love with Ran's police officer brother, to Aya, their new friend, who is the class brain and the last person anyone thought would be selling herself.  The male characters are funny too, especially Yuya, whom Ran dubs as second place since he came in second place in a teen idol popularity contest.  Rei, his best friend, is also hilarious, especially when he tried to caution Yuya away from Ran, whom he dubs as being trouble.
This anime is rated 15+, mainly for some violence and a bit of vulgar language.  If you fall in the proper age group, this is one anime that I can highly recommend.  You won't find any giant robots or attacking aliens here but just some good old fashioned crazy fun.  I highly recommend it.",1074729600,2,1885,4.213888888888889
7983114,4,B00008G8QN,"Yeah I admit, I was a little embarressed to be buying this anime. But it also looked so cute I just couldn't help myself. After watching the first DVD I was impressed. Not only is the Super Gals alot of fun but you also see a different side of the ""Kogal"" lifestyle. In reading the manga ""Peach Girl"" I was given a brief understanding of Kogals; they were stupid tanned bimbos who were easy and might sell themselves to you. In Super Gals I saw in Ran that not all Kogals are like that. She shows it's possible to have fun being a Kogal while also keeping her dignity. I also really enjoyed the fact that there are cultural notes on the backside of the poster. Something I have not seen many anime distributors do except for fansubbers and I always thought there should be more of instead of just trying to ""Americanize"" it for us. So yeah, all and all I really enjoyed Super Gals because not only is it fun but it actually provides some pop culture education about one side of Japan.",1073520000,2,984,4.324324324324325
7983115,5,B00008G8QN,"This is a classic series, and it's finally here! Hallelujah, we're saved, can we have an Amen! AMEN!
I've been waiting for GALS! to rock the United States since a couple years ago, when I first heard of Ran and the gang. YEAH BABY! That's what I'm talkin' about! Time to get me that DVD! This is what I've been waiting for! Hopefully this is going to hit the airwaves as well! GO GO KOTOBUKI RAN!!!! *waves fans in the air, fireworks explode*",1066521600,2,442,4.337349397590361
