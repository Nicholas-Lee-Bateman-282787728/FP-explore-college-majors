186788,5,1567301568,"A daring movie for India. For any country really, but especially for a country like India where the issue of female homosexuality was a big taboo in the mid-1990s and it still is. We learn a lot about an India which travelers hardly ever read of hear about, let alone see with their own eyes. It is an optimistic movie, in the end the right of the women to pursue their own path to happiness wins the day.

The pace of the movie is deliberate, with no rush and no slack, it is just right. We are taken into the home of a traditional Indian family where the modern lifestyle of one young husband contrasts with the stale tradition of another husband of a generation earlier. Both neglect their women and this brings the two ladies together more than they would ever have planned. It is ultimately a movie about freedom and love, not necessarily a movie about male chauvinism in India.

It is also a movie about changing India: millenary traditions crumble under the impact of modernity, and the movie suggests that this is a necessary transformation for the country.

This movie is one of three sometimes referred to as the ""Elements Trilogy"" by Mehta, including ""Water"" and ""Earth"".",1418169600,,1182,4.619047619047619

186790,5,1567301568,"This film is one of three by the same director.  It is an intimate look at a traditional culture which can lead to a death of the soul in women having no voice in what they may or may not want in a marriage.  Reduced to being wives without feelings or desires, subjected only to their spouses' wants or needs, assuming them devoid of any expectations of their own.  The taboo storyline moves along gently, releasing pent up emotions, desires and needs which overwhelming drives them to cross the forbidden line.  It disturbed me that the younger brother was so insensitive to his wife given his relationship with another, believing he should have been more enlightened about women because of it.  Read the detailed reviews since it will help you understand it better as the subtitles may not be enough as to how and why the 'family household' comes about.  As to the reality of the younger brother's indifference at first to his bride, I happen to know this actually happens.  The exact situation, marrying to appease his father (who was paying his college education), not sleeping with her, being in love with someone else.  I understood his love for his girlfriend, yet could not understand his lack of thought for his bride.  The film brought back that conversation years ago sadly enough..........",1411516800,,1301,4.798206278026906

What I liked? the dramatic content, the fact that each story flows without obvious prompting and that each is vividly told, explicit without any seedy edge, associations.

This film, one part of his Earth, Water, Fire trilogy, is extraordinarily moving and its courageous lesbian love theme in a male-oriented culture like India's is poignant, sad, and in the end, triumphant. The two lovely actresses responsible for the film's emotional impact - Nandita Das and Shabana Azmi - are perfection in their roles. All the male characters in the film are, perhaps inevitably, despicable - and very well played, too.

186806,5,1567301568,"I have had nearly a lifelong love affair with India, and all things Indian. This has not been a vicarious love affair. I have been to India many times, and stayed longer than just a visit each time. Indian culture is a part of my life, and I am pleased here to come to full reconciliation with Planet Bollywood as a purveyor of that culture here in the States.

When 'Fire' was brought to my attention by my Ayurvedic doctor, I ordered it immediately. When 'Fire' did not arrive, but another, by mistake, I was upset. My communication with Planet Bollywood was direct, I did not hold back. I was harsh, perhaps unduly harsh. In response, as it should have, both in writing and in fact, Planet Bollywood made it right, very right.

Here, now, I, too, make it right. Planet Bollywood has regained my respect, my admiration, and, very importantly, my unreserved willingness to order again from them, and to recommend them to others.

186811,5,1567301568,"`Fire' (1997) is a powerful, emotional, and inflammatory film about a highly taboo subject in India which is why writer, director, and co-producer Deepa Mehta had the good sense to release it in English instead of Hindi. Not only is this film extremely bothersome to Indian sensibilities because of the central lesbian storyline but even more so because of the negative commentary it levels against such longstanding, honored and ""holy"" traditional institutions such as marriage, religion and some of the possible ulterior motives that may lay behind a husbands personal spiritual practices.

It's difficult to determine what a given viewer might find more disturbing about this film; discomfort over a lesbian relationship, the overwhelmingly negative male, Indian stereotypes or possibly the fact that the two women involved in a romantic relationship happen to be named Radha (the consort of the god Krishna) and Sita (the consort of the god Rama). Tying this tale of forbidden lesbian romance to popular personages within the Hindu spiritual tradition maybe going just a little bit too far don't you think?

By now you might assume that I didn't like this movie. If you thought that to be the case you would be incorrect, I loved it! Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das are absolutely perfect in the roles of long suffering Radha and the spirited, untamable Sita. Shabana is such a beautiful and amazing actress, in my opinion she can do no wrong and the younger Nandita Das is more than up to the challenge, balancing Shabana's wisdom and disillusionment with equal amounts of youthful rebelliousness and naive expectation.

While Shabana and Nandita are unquestionably the stars of the film there are other wonderful performances as well. The two most notable being Kulbhushan Kharbana in the role of Ashok, Radha's aloft, celibate husband and Ranjit Chowdhry as Mundu the household servant.

There are so many levels and subtly interwoven themes to this film that tend to be lost or go unnoticed because of the focus placed on the overt lesbian storyline. `Fire' is a deeply insightful, searing social commentary that pushes the viewer into avenues of self analysis that they usually would not wish to travel. 'Fire' is definitely the appropriate name for this amazing film. My highest recommendation!

Note: This is the first film in Deepa Mehta's trilogy, followed by 'Earth' (1999) and 'Water' (2006). I recommend them all!",1303862400,,2426,5.131645569620253
186812,2,1567301568,"This dvd works fine until it reaches a certain point/chapter. Then it stops and I have to go to chapters and click the chapter I was on and then it works. The dvd also makes an odd and loud noise at the very end of it. I had never watched the film before until last night. I am a big fan of this film and the films Earth, and Water by the same director. This dvd was rather expensive, but I was willing to pay the price because the last time I ordered it for a cheaper price from another seller it ended up being out of stock later, and I did not get it. What would you like to do about this situation? I am an honest person. The dvd has no scratches. I really want this film in my dvd library.

186813,4,1567301568,"This movie explores desire in many of its forms and all of them under the same roof. Forbidden, repressed, ""controlled"", denied, unfulfilled desires. Kulbhushan Kharbanda's character, Ashok, insists that all desires are the root of evil, and a local swami reinforces this belief in him. He does his best controlling all his desires but never takes into account his wife, Radha, for that matter. Being this a male dominant heteropatriarchal society she's just useless and unworthy of any consideration.  The same goes for the other characters and family members. The newlywed couple, Jatin and Sita, has issues of its own. Being frustration the main one.

However, desire is involuntary and spontaneous, and whoever falls prey of desire doesn't own it either.  We can act against our impulses, but these stay alive, demanding and insistent. Some desires are more irresistible than others. And this is how we get to the point where the only thing left is to abandon ourselves into it. All control is lost. We then are willing to be seen whole and as we truly are. Reason is lost. All we are left is our desire knocking at our door, and sooner or later we have to decide between opening the door or shutting it forever with all the consequences both choices imply.  Their family dynamic is so emotionally unhealthy, but yet so expected in their society, that no one could have imagined that these ladies would succumb to their desires. Radha and Sita end up entangled together, contacting with and unleashing their own desires. Desire for each other, for love, for passion, for life itself. It's truly interesting to see how this desire shakes everyone and everything around.

It's a good movie, but if English is not your mother tongue you might have a hard time getting some of the dialogues. As it's expected they speak with a heavy accent as many us foreigners do, and I couldn't get all the dialogues all the time which frustrated me a bit. I wish the DVD had at least close caption so I could read what they were saying in some parts. The only character I understood well whenever she appeared was Julie, the Chinese mistress. Still, it's a beautiful movie and if you like foreign cinema you might enjoy it. But be warned, the movie is kind of slow and feels week at certain points, and most Westerners are used to live life and expect almost everything on it to happen in a rush. Still, if you decide to give it a chance, the topic and plot are quite interesting.",1278806400,,2467,4.701388888888889
186814,5,1567301568,"Fire is a very classy movie.  Deepa Mehta has directed a touching, sensual, exotic (for those of us in the West) and controversial film that is, without a doubt, one of the best lesbian love stories ever filmed.  But it's more than that.  It's a story about the plight of women in a deeply sexist and repressive Indian society.  Two beautiful women - Shabana Azmi as Radha and the stunning Nandita Das as the young Sita - meet and bond over their loveless marriages.  That they also fall in love, become lovers and have the courage to break free of their cultural chains proved extremely confronting for many Indian men on the film's release.  Violent demonstrations and death threats against the director followed.

Perhaps if the movie were not so powerful, it wouldn't have been so threatening.  Then again, the mere idea of women who do not need men is still revolutionary in many countries.  For those of us in more liberal societies, the film is quite an education in a culture rife with conflict between traditional attitudes and contemporary behaviour.  The acting is excellent, the humour unexpected, the spirit of these women exhilarating.  I've watched Fire many times over the 14 years since its release, and it doesn't date.  This is one to treasure.

If you love Fire like I do, Nandita Das is just as charming in Earth, another of the films in Mehta's Elements trilogy - about the partition of India and Pakistan.  She's an outstanding find, and Deepa Mehta is one classy filmmaker.",1277769600,,1497,4.77431906614786
186815,5,1567301568,"Deepa Mehta is a brave filmmaker and in Fire she has made a timeless story of repression and liberation - two women fall in love and find the courage to change their lives.  Shabana Azmi and the stunning Nandita Das are touching and real as the sisters-in-law who both find themselves in loveless marriages and discover happiness together.  Banned in India, where women's lives are tightly constrained and lesbianism is still very much in the closet, the film inspired riots and death threats.  Yes, it's that good!  You know it's got something going for it when the wowsers hate it.  Highly recommended, this is an important, sensual and beautifully made film.",1271376000,,661,4.918918918918919

186820,3,1567301568,"There are many plot points which were easy to see coming, which is the fault of the screenplay by Mehta. But the film is far too suffused with politics to approach greatness, even were it better written. It is not as overtly preachy and hammy as Brokeback Mountain, but it does make excuses for its adulterous lesbians, just as the Hollywood film basically makes heroes out of lying lowlife bastards. As example, while Jatin is certainly a fool and cheater, and Sita owes him no allegiance, the same cannot be said of Radha, for Ashok is certainly a devoted and loving husband. If she was not getting what she wanted, it was her right and duty to speak up and demand change, or leave with honor. His response to her barrenness may have been silly and wrong, but it was not accomplished without her complicity. Radha, in this sense, is the villain of the film, for while Jatin is a letch, he is shown as utterly void of depth. Mundu is a slimebag, but an insignificant little bug. But Radha has the ability to think and choose. She does not merely fall into her relationship with Sita, she chooses its deceptions over her first allegiance to her husband. If she wanted out or change, she should have spoken up, for the energy and will she displays in leaving him could have earlier been displayed within her marriage. Thus, she is an agent of the ill that befalls the family, not a victim, the way the nave and forcefully betrothed Sita is.

  The other aspects of the film are well done, such as the musical soundtrack by A.R. Rahman, and the cinematography by Giles Nuttgens, but nothing that approaches greatness. The DVD, put out by New Yorker Video, has the 108 minute version of the film, and is shown in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. There is no audio film commentary, but there is a theatrical trailer, cast profiles and production notes, and a documentary on the controversy the film caused in India, which led to its banning. All in all, it shows Indian culture in a very silly and puerile light.

  That said, the film, aside from its objective artistic flaws, also suffers from an insular take on its culture. To the non-Indian, as example, there are many political points meant for Indian society, alone, that are lost outside that milieu, and without these touchstone hot buttons as references, the film's political relevance fizzles- the best example being Sita's and Radha's names being based upon Hindu goddesses, and Sita being purged by fire- although in the film it is Radha who is purged by fire; a point Indian film critics lash out at, but which seem silly criticisms to foreign ears. Yet, ultimately, what causes Fire to only reach passable mediocrity as a film is the more immanent artistic flaws of screenplay, characterization, and political imposition. It is a film that is solid, but nothing worth viewing a second time, save for glimpsing the two gorgeous lipstick lesbians. Not that that is a bad thing, of course, but why not try Penthouse, instead? At least there you won't be subjected to puerile political statements.

  The film is the first of a trilogy of films, and was followed by Earth and Water, which seem to be less `controversial,' as well as less pointedly provocative. Whether or not this equates with a genuine upgrade of the art is something to be seen, but there is potential here. It's just that Mehta's desire to make a cogent statement so overwhelms her desire to make it endure to future generations, and outside its natal setting, that this film fails. Rein that in, and she has the makings of an artist of consequence. I'll be watching.",1248825600,,3584,4.6761904761904765
186821,5,1567301568,"I find this film to be an intense intellectual experience on several levels.

Ostensibly an Indian movie on the taboo subject of female relationships there is a clear parable involving the spiritual versus the secular where one brother, married to a barren wife seeks to overcome his human desires through following the teachings of a swami. His brother, the proprietor of a video store, has a relationship with a Chinese woman but goes through with an arranged marriage in conformity with family tradition. The strains of tradition force the two women to seek comfort in each other, developing a relationship between them where desires are awakened and love overcomes the taboos enforced by a patriarchal society. In the background is the handicapped matriarch who's care is the responsibility of a young man who abuses the responsibility entrusted to him, but which heightens the lack of respect women hold in that society.

On a different level, the film nicely illustrates the conflicts involed in a society which is in the throes of a transition to modernity. The ols quasi-religious notions are being usurped as contemporary capitalistic globalisation forces drive deep into the urban population. The brothers sybolise the old and the new. The old holds that spirituality is the glue which holds society together whilst the new stresses individuality and business meeting individual needs. In this sense the two women show how the new notions corrupt and subsume the old. the relationship which develops is based on desire and the concept of selfishness which may or may not be long lasting and worthwhile.

Choosing thus overlooks the plight of those women in India who are excluded from society upon divorce or widowhood and other social issues but neverthe less this is an important film not just for the representation of the modernisation of India but to gives us a glimpse of some of the issues involved in the West in our own journey to industrialisation and beyond.

186824,4,1567301568,"This isn't Biji's Bollywood. This is Deepa Mehta's New Delhi, India, during a time of transition.  Fire is about burning desire-- for passion, for life, for the vision that is behind the eyes. This is not a love story, per se, but a liberation story.

The story line is quite basic: in a middle class family, one husband devotes himself to his swami and vows celibacy while his younger brother, forced into a traditional wedding, continues to see his lover. Both wives tend to the restaurant and their husbands' mother, following traditional roles of subservience. Until they discover, or uncover, their passion for one another.

So if the plot is not the draw, why watch this film? It gives a glimpse of the upcoming middle class (late 1990s) life--the juxtaposition of uberurban cosmopolitan life and traditional mores.  It is India trying to grow into itself.",1218412800,,862,4.924137931034482

186831,4,1567301568,"Deepa Mehta's engaging film FIRE is by Western standards a very tame story about the love of two Indian Hindu women, the sisters-in-law Radha and Sita. Both are in loveless male-dominated arranged marriages with two insensitive men. They are part of an Indian extended family that includes an elderly matriarch who cannot speak because of a stroke but lets her wishes be made known often and loudly with the assistance of a hand bell. A servant, kinky enough to be a character of a Carson McCullers novel, completes this dysfunctional family.

The fire within the movie is nothing compared to the storm that erupted when the movie opened in Bombay. Middle-class men and enough women to bring shame to their species caused a riot, breaking glass, tearing down the advertisements for the film, etc. Not only do the two women in the film love each other, but they kiss, they have the fortitude to say no to boorish husbands, and their ultimate sin is that they are Hindu.

Too often the added footage to a DVD is actors and directors patting each other on their egotistical backs and should best be avoided. Not so in this instance. The interviews with the directors, the actors and the poor joker who had the misfortune to own the theatre that was attacked are included.

My one complaint about the film is that some of the characters' English is difficult to follow. Subtitles would have made the story unfold a lot more smoothly. Nevertheless, both the movie and commentary are not to be missed.",1181520000,,1495,4.742307692307692
186832,5,1567301568,"Like many viewers I delayed seeing this film. I hesitated due to the subject matter and my possible reactions to it. However, curiosity won out and once I viewed it, I was thoroughly impressed with how Deepa Mehta so beautifully and artisically addressed so many social issues and taboos in her society of India. The story revolves around a traditional Indian household where modern life interferes with tradition  - twisting it into knots which become even more tightly pulled together as the film develops. The man of the house Ashok is played by Kulbushan Kharbanda. He becomes a religious fanatic after it is discovered his wife can not conceive a baby. He has chosen to be celibate and a follower of a Hindu guru who teaches that by withholding sexual expression he will advance more quickly in his spiritual growth and come closer to discovering ""truth"". Ashok's younger brother, Jutin had agreed to an arranged marriage with the beautiful Sita. His true love is Julie, who is Chinese and very modern in her behavior. He felt she would not be accepted as his wife by his traditional family, so he entered into the marriage for the wrong reasons. Sita is welcomed into the household but soon learns Jutin has no interest in her. Sita is a young woman who has some modern ideas about personal freedom and expressing her needs and desires. When she and Jutin visit the Taj Mahal together, Jutin stays behind, near a building to smoke a cigarette. When Sita attempts to converse with him, he indifferently replies to her questions, exactly when the tour guide is describing how the Taj Mahal was built to honor the wife of a King due to his great love for her after she died. The contrast and symbolism is so clearn and evident. Sita has certain expectations about marriage and how a husband should behave towards his wife. They are very basic expectations, such as he should show an interest in her likes and dislikes and be gentle and kind ...

Through chance and fate, the two women of the household are thrown together to work in the family business, a restaurant where they cook take-out food. Each is wrapped up with her personal problems associated with their marriage. They share a common bond of friendship and eventually talk to each other about how they feel rejected by their husbands. They gradually develop a closeness which turns into a more intimate physical relationship. Initially, it makes both of them  uncomfortable but the relationship continues to grow into something real. The film does not show any explicit physical behavior but implies it by showing the women together in bed ... Unfortunatly, the servant Mundu becomes aware of what is transpiring between them. He eventually reports it to Ashok.

I love how a Hindu religious story from the Ramayana about how a god tests the purity of his wife through fire is symbolically played out within this film to represent how the love between these two women is tested as the household disintegrates when many truths are revealed about different family members as well as the behavior of the servant Mundu. Even Biji, the mother-in-law who is honored and cared for by the two daughter-in-laws shows her disgust for their behavior by spitting in the face of one of them when she leans over to help Biji eat ...

This film explores what are true and authentic feelings between two people in an unacceptable relationship compared to the false expressions of the more acceptable relationships sanctioned by society. It exposes the imperfections and false behaviors associated with traditionally accepted roles. The main theme of the film is honesty in love, even a love that exists within a socially unacceptable situation ... between two women. Many false relationships are exposed. For instance, the superficial physical desires expressed between Jutin and his lover Julie, shows neither dared to defy tradition and express their true love by bringing their relationship out into the open. Ashok physically denies himself in the belief that he will attain a higher expression of truth and achieve a higher spiritual development as a result of his celibacy. In the end, only the courage of the two women remains after the household disintegrates when the truths which are hidden are revealed. While this film will not appeal to everyone, those with an open mind and curiosity about different expressions of love will find it to be a satisfying viewing experience.

Deepa Mehta depicts these women in a traditional light, and yet breaks taboo by showing how tradition never applies to true love. The two main characters are named after Hindu Goddesses, Sita and Radha, which one must supect symbolizes the ascending of love from above, no matter what form that love may take.

The Scenes in this movie are beautifully done, as well. Sort of dark in the beginning, but somehow taking on a very colorful tone as the film progresses. The soundtrack is one i've always appreciated, it's rare that a film fully meshes with it's music, and i would argue that Fire is one film where this is evident.

Deepa Mehta's films are quite deliberate and slowly paced,allowing the senses to be awakened properly. There is much silence and hesitant longing in her films, and the viewer must be aware that they will be slowly and deliberately drawn along at a very exacting pace.

186842,4,1567301568,"I saw this film on the same evening as I watched Deepa Metha's Earth. This film features many of the same actors but exposes a radically different topic--personal freedom and sexuality within the confines of a traditional Hindi family. But I found the first film more compelling and believable, somehow.

The film opens as Sita (Nandita Das) visits the Taj Mahal with her new bridegroom, Jatin (Javed Jaffrey), who seems surprisingly standoffish, considering the circumstances. ""We've only been married three days,"" he tells Sita, when she asks if he doesn't like her anymore. Soon after her arrival at his home, she discovers a dysfunctional family, Indian style.

Her new brother-in-law Ashok (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) frequently leaves his video and sweets shop to visit the local swamee, who gave him a new spiritual lease on life after he learned that his wife Radha (Shabana Azmi) could not bear children. They seem oddly distant, too, although in due course, viewers learn that Ashok vowed to become a celibate shortly after his wife's barren condition--""no eggs, madame""--was diagnosed. Jatin, it shortly turns out, is obsessed with a longtime Chinese girlfriend, despite her rejection of his marriage proposal. Audaciously, he even recommends that Sita meet her.

To cap off this odd bunch is Mundu (Ranjit Chowdhry), a sweet shop employee who often ducks upstairs when no one is around to watch pornographic movies and jerk off. It doesn't bother him at all that Ashok's ancient, bed-ridden ailing mother Biji (Kushal Rekhi) spends most of her time in the TV room.

As others have noted, the inconsiderate men in this family inadvertently cast their wives into a close relationship that soon becomes loving, and eventually, sexual.

It's an intriguing film, but I found Earth to be of far more consequence. And from what I hear, Metha's film, Water, is better than either of them.

186843,5,1567301568,"Fire... is a great story about the dynamics of freeing yourself from the sometimes unbearble chains of tradition. The hidden treasure in this story is the discovery that even the ones who seemingly hold the keys to the locks on these chains are themselves bound by them.

With the third installment of this trilogy (Fire, Earth and Water) finally completed, I thought I would throw in my take on this wonderful movie. In short this is a study that proves my understanding that everyone in this life needs attention and everyone seeks it and obtains it in their own way...sometimes without regard for themselves, others, their traditions, or for the society in which they live.

Until Radha and Sita connect in spirit, each lacks in the fulfillment of knowing their value, self worth, purpose, potential for happiness or the warmth of intimacy that any human desires. Unfortunately too often too many fail to realize this need until it is too late. For Sita and Radha, they manage to break through the veil of oppression and do so because of their new found selves.  Sita, too young to go gentle into that dreariest of dreary life, and Radha who long ago accepted her fate as a wife filled with guilt instead of life, must embrace each other to feel themselves and their worth...and their desires. How inspirational!

Truly this discovery has nothing to do with the sexual side of the relationship. This is not about being lesbians...which I am. For some lesbians this is precisely the thread that draws us to another. It's about needing to feel alive. In which case we are no different than anyone else. Neither are Sita and Radha.

But if it were about sex, which it is not, in truth sexual desire has been a driving catalyst for many fairy tales, wars and the sole inspiration of many conquerors.  Why shouldn't it be the same for these two? They have conquered the norm through tremendous risk. Not unlike Snow White or Sleeping Beauty, they are brought back to life with a kiss. It is a revelation for both women. They desire life. Isn't that what any of us wants?  A desire to live and feel...not just exist.

In Hindu tradition, even after walking through the fire to prove her purity and faithfulness...Ram still send his love away...and it breaks his heart to do so. The truth is that she has proven to be too pure of heart.  A purity that even he was not wirthy of. Radha walks through the fire of her life, survives and is cleansed by the rain. It is predictable but still poetic.

I love all of the characters in this story.  From the muted bell-ringing- see all grandmother to the hopelessly in-love self-pleasuring saboteur servant.  It is all poetic because in life the flicker of flames and pangs of desire are, in all their pain and glory, poetry.

It's just a story but I believe it to be very inspiring.",1151539200,10,2821,4.629258517034068

India needs a lot of that kind of film and books. Women as well as lower caste members need to learn about their inner dignity and their right to lead a free and loving life and I hope this will happen in the next decades.

It may be natural for a woman to love another woman and have sex as the physical basis of that love. Also, Hindu fundamentalists violently condemn the projected homosexuality in their tradition but there is hardly any evidence that lesbianism is absent in Hindu culture and, as an Indian is likely to be a Hindu, the names Radha and Sita are justifiable.",1132704000,7,631,4.906542056074766

In spite of the controversy, Mehta's treatment in large part, is subtle, tender and evocative.

186848,4,1567301568,"""Fire"" is a movie that is unfortunately known more for the firestorm (pardon the pun) of controversy surrounding the themes of the movie than it is for its delicate and passionate story.

Sita and Radha are sisters-in-law bound by the strict rules of tradition and what it means being a wife. Together they find themselves trapped in loveless, empty marriages and therefore find they share many common grounds, such as the need to feel and express desire, the necessity of breaking with tradition to experience the freedom of both self-expression and Self, and the love of those who love them.

""Fire"" is more a story that focuses on these themes rather than a titilating story about lesbianism. The love between Sita and Radha is organic and honest, although several Western stereotypes concerning lesbians are visible (for example, the older woman-younger woman relationship), but despite this rather easily-overlooked shortcoming, we're presented with a movie that, as a whole, is brilliantly acted and filmed, educational and most importantly, moving.",1115251200,18,1055,5.311377245508982

By Hollywood standards, this is an intriguing movie, where two women rebel against their traditional roles, and turn to each other for love, respect and sexual gratification.

By Bollywood standards however, this shocker has committed several major offenses, the least of which are the on-screen love scenes between two women.  The issues that shocked the traditionalists to the bone are that firstly, the women are Hindus, secondly the movie challenges the very core of male dominance, and thirdly, that women have the right to be independent and happy in their marital relationships.

Radha (Shabana Azmi) is married to Ashok (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) and has been unable to fulfill his desire for a child.  Ashok has been consulting a Swami, and in the belief that desire is the root of all evil, keeps her close to him without intimacy so that he will become a better person.

Sita (Nandita Das) is a young bride with a longing for love and adventure, married to Jatin (Javed Jaffrey) who is unwilling to provide her with either, because he is in love with someone else.  Their marriage is a sham, as Jatin only married to please Ashok and his grandmother Biji.

As per custom, the whole extended family lives under one roof, and their unhappy marriages draw Sita and Radha together.  Sita turns out to be the one who inspires the break with tradition, and finds a willing convert in Radha.

Director Deepa Mehta handles this controversial movie tastefully and tenderly, the romance balanced by traditional family values and the comedic activities of the servant Mundu (Ranjit Chowdhry, a Mehta regular).  Shabana Azmi is perfect as the more mature woman, but Nandita Das sparkles as the enlightened abandoned bride.

My only regret is that the DVD version lacks subtitles, as even though the actors all speak English, their accents and Hindi references are sometimes difficult to catch.

A beautiful and powerful movie, but not your usual Bollywood fare.

186855,3,1567301568,"This film was really quite good, but there were a few things that made this film far from perfect.  While the content and message of the film was powerful, I didn't really feel comfortable with the lesbianism that took place between Rhada and Sita.  Their physical exchange didn't seem authentic.  They seemed to turn to each other because they longed for touch, a touch that might have been satisfied if their husbands had truly cared for them both emotionally and physically.  Furthermore, I didn't like how the film seemed to portray lesbianism as the outcome of two women caring for each other. This is not always the case.  Female friendship doesn't have an inherent element of lesbianism.  In addition, I didn't particularly care for the cinematography.  I found it to be a bit static, and unpoetic, whatever that means.
On the other hand, this movie was very powerful due to the idea that women can imagine something different for themselves, despite traditional structures that are oppressive, and despite what some might consider the insidious influences of patriarchy.  This is why the film constantly returns to Rhada's attempt to envisage the ocean.  So long as she can't imagine the ocean, she can't imagine a situation different for herself.  The most powerful scene in this film was when Rhada declared that she ""desires to live.""  Similarly, Sita seems to imagine something different for herself when she dresses in Jhatin's clothes.  Wearing his clothes seem to empower her in a way that wearing her sari does not.
While some might tout this end of this film as a triumph for Western values, I really think this film took the approach of Third World feminism, that there are other ways to create a woman friendly situation.",1064793600,9,1740,4.921232876712328

It isn't about lesbianism because the sister-in-laws were desperate to be loved by someone who's understanding, tender and selfless and they found that in each other without considering that they are about to embark on a lesbian love affair.  This is believeable when you see that there is an abyss  in their lives that only the other can fill.  I think this is more like a sociology film that attempts to show the cultural and moral constraints that are burdened on Indian women and on some level, Indian men.  It is a lot to absorb in one film but Deepa Metha did such a great job in keeping the story tight that you never lose interest.  It is also clastrophobically filmed in a tight apartment complex, that is both physically and mentally choking.  I dropped one star because I think Mehta had a chance to make a stylistic sequence with the two women.  Nandita Das and Shabana Azmi are etheral and this fact was not taken advantage of.  Other than that, I really like this movie.  I do recommend the DVD version because it includes a news footage of a religous cult attacking and smashing a theater in New Delhi showing this film because it did not conform with their dogmatic beliefs. It also includes interviews with the director, the actresses and the cult leader(she's a real Hoot).

You don't have to be a fan of  Bollywood films to enjoy this picture,  it is very uncharacteristic of most Hindi films and was actually banned in India.  Filled with firey passion, scandel, and intrigue, it is a film centered around 2 women (both emotionally and sexually ignored and stiffled by their husbands) who discover a beautiful though forbidden love between each other.  Although the story ends with a bitter sweet tone it is nontheless emotionally electrifying and a must see for ALL movie fans especially those interested in romance, culture, tradition, and namely the cultural and marital restrictions put on Indian women.

- 'It is hard for some to truly understand how little freedom; either in opinion or in movement women have in some eastern cultures.'
- 'Understandably, most westerners would find it difficult to relate to the reality of a culture which has traditionally allowed men to get away with such MCP attitudes.'
- 'This film tackles the subject of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviations from the norm. It criticises a great many Indian customs that many find oppressive -- such as the arranging of marriages by others, the importance of status and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, the valuation of women in terms of their baby-making capacity, the binding concepts of duty and so on.'
A few posters go on to speculate that Indians did not like this film because 'many saw this movie and feared that it would cause women to question their own place in society.'
- 'I wondered to myself, what could be so controversial in this film that it would cause an entire country to ban its existence? I rented it and do you know what? It turned out that the threat was new ideas that challenged traditional culture.'
- 'The violence and controversy it sparked in the conservative Hindu state of Maharashtra are documented in the ""extras""; more than anything else, the ability of this film to panic conservative forces, and thereby elicit mob violence, speaks to its power and lasting value as a challenge to institutions that (however benign they may seem on the surface) keep women down.'
I must first of all point out that (as others have noted) the film was initially released in India, but subsequently banned due to the violent reaction of certain extremist groups and the inability of the police to prevent it (not because of the lesbian content or fears that Indian women would get all out of control), which only resulted in a national backlash against the Censor Board, so that it was re-released three months later ""without a single cut.""
Second, if anyone is actually interested in the *informed insider's* response to 'Fire' (for a refreshing change of pace), check out Madhu Kishwar's, a well-known Hindu feminist and editor of the Indian feminist journal, Manushi, review in which she critiques both the film and Western chauvinism and condescension. I recommend that you watch the movie and then read Kishwar's review and then give some serious thought to the issues that *both* bring up.",1050451200,13,2583,4.886104783599089

Mobs attacked the theater, tearing out the furniture, and the actress was accused of being ""wicked"" and ""criminal"" by extremist Hindu parties such as Shiv Sena. The film was withdrawn, which created a backlash. Spontaneous street demonstrations brought the return of ""Fire"" after three months ""without a single cut,"" the actress noted.
So everybody is right. :-)  I don't know if I have ever written a review before but I found this movie to be sad and one that stayed with me...  Most movies I tend to forget fairly quickly, and I don't even watch a whole lot of movies, but I found scenes in this movie to be truly disturbing.

186861,4,1567301568,"This 1996 film from India was written and directed by Deepa Mehta, not known to shy away from controversial themes.  Here, she introduces the viewer to a beautifully photographed bustling city where an extended family live together and run a video store and restaurant.  When the younger philandering brother marries in an arranged marriage and brings his bride to the household, we get to meet the family through the young woman's eyes.  There's the bedridden elderly mother who cannot speak but uses a small bell to make her wants known.  There's her husband's brother who has taken a vow of celibacy because his wife is infertile.  And there's the male servant who indulges in his own kind of gratification.
The two sister-in-laws are unhappy.  A forbidden romance between them ensues.
The entire theme is handled in an understated way and the romantic scenes between the women are clouded in shadow.  There's a lot unsaid.  And yet, the film is about a lot more than just these two women and their predicament.  It is about the emerging role of women to make choices in a modern Indian society.  It's about the deep conflicts between tradition and the reality of modern times.
The entire cast does an excellent job.  I felt I was right there in that household.  And the director even introduced some mysticism and epic poetry.  It was a gentle film though, in spite of its bold theme.  And that is what made it interesting.
The characters all spoke English, which made the film easy for me to watch.  But, in spite of it being well done, I found it slow and boring in parts.  There were few new plot developments  to hold my interest, just an elaboration of the same theme.  It was only 104 minutes long but was too long to me.
If Indian films are new to you, this might be a good introduction.  It really brings the viewer right inside the experience of having to deal with forbidden love in contemporary India.",1034985600,23,1916,4.648809523809524

Made with obvious love by an Indian woman who currently hails from Canada, ""Fire"" tackles both arranged marriage--a topic that makes the West uneasy--and lesbianism--a subject that makes East and West alike squirm. The film is beautifully framed and shot. The plot is straightforward (I knew what was coming most of the time), but the nuances seem sharper, since we're plunked into a different culture. Or is it so different? And the ending was a complete surprise, and powerful.
Even on the honeymoon, a new husband has no interest in his young bride.(""The fool!"" you'll say, because the actress is truly gorgeous!) And as if to rub it in, the dolt spurns her at the Taj Mahal, the world's greatest monument to love. We know it's not going to work, but he takes her home to his extended family anyway, ensconces her in his proper middle-class household, and goes out every night with his Chinese mistress, who makes him paint her toenails. (Okay, I didn't see that one coming--but I should have. Why did I expect a proper Indian family to be more proper than families anywhere else?) The bride has to stay home and tend to family business. That means she cooks, cleans, prays and fasts for her husband's health, cares for her husband's aged mom, and waits to see if her husband ever wants to have sex with her.  (He does. Sort of. Once.)
The bride has a mind, however, and is bored--to the point of secretly cross-dressing while dancing to light rock. (Well, I guess I didn't see that coming either, but once it got going, I knew she'd get caught.) You soon understand that she desperately needs to learn how to avoid offending the Master of the Household--her husband's elder brother.
Happily, along comes her older--and stunning--sister-in-law (played by lovely Shabana Azmi, one of the most popular actresses in India).  This poor soul hasn't been touched by her husband in thirteen years. (He's on a soul-strengthening celibacy kick prescribed by his guru.) She undertakes to teach the young bride how to be a proper wife. The sister-in-law, however, is clueless as to the feelings she inspires in her young protege.  But delightfully, we're not. In fact, the household sizzles with so much repressed desire that you'll be rooting out loud for the protagonists when they finally get together and let off some steam. And the erotic scenes are beautifully done, understated and tasteful.
I won't tell you any more, except to say the pair gets into trouble, trouble that will make your heart ache in recognition and race with hope. The ending will grip you. I've watched this film many times and am always touched by its beauty.
PS: As a bonus, you'll get to see a short enactment of the Indian epic ""The Ramayana,"" with the part of the goddess Sita played in the traditional Indian way--by a man dressed as a woman and singing in falsetto.",1016841600,15,2881,4.790744466800805

I read about the controversy surrounding the movie in international newspapers and how the conservative Hindu government and censor boards banned the movie.  As a strong believer in freedom of speech, I checked this movie out...what a mistake.  I would have been better off renting a lesbian porn flick than the nonsense I witnessed during that painful 100 minutes; it probably would have a better story than the fluff in this film.  The men in the film are nothing but caricatures with little, or no character development.  As Mr. Maltin has pointed out, all the male characters are portrayed in a negative light; as chauvinistic and self centered, while the women are shown has Angel's of God.  And the argument that the reason they are portrayed in that manner is because they truly do act that way is as stereotypical as saying that women are nothing but gold digging opportunists.  The character development for women was also absurd.  Radha being married to her celibent husband for more than a decade suddenly has feelings for sister-in-law.  Come on!  I can't believe that utter nonsense like this stupid premise are so easily accepted by the general public.
If you're thinking of buying or renting this movie, don't.  Not unless you greatly enjoy being in utter agony for nearly 2 hours.

It criticises a great many Indian customs that many find oppressive -- such as the arranging of marriages by others, the importance of status and face, rligious hypocrisy, sexism, the valuation of women in terms of their baby-making capacity, the binding concepts of duty and so on. At the heart of the film is a touching love story that goes beyond such limitations of the society which the two protagnonists find themselves. The film is well-acted and genuine, completely believable from beginning to end, unlike most Bollywood flicks. The main faults of the film as I saw it was first, that the two lovers seem drawn to one another not necessarily by a natural affinity for each other as much as the fact that they are stuck in dead-end marriages with no passion and no rewards. This may play a part in the sexual awakening of the characters, but most people stuck in the same situation will not ""turn homosexual"". It seems clear from the beginning of the filmm that the two characters are quite heterosexual -- when Radha does her scene at the end of the movie with Aashok, she makes it quite clear that ""without desire she was dead"", and the implication was that if he had desired so, he could have fulfilled her quite completely, and also when Sita seemed very disappointed when her husband seemed to not like her. Such situations do not turn people into homosexuals -- they may seek comfort in others in the same position, but inthe film it is not at all made clear that they are lesbians from the beginning -- quite the opposite. Some people are bisexual, it is true, but most tend to be either hetero- or homosexual. In the case of the ladies in the film, both had insensitive jerks for husbands . . . if this had not been the case, would they have naturally found the need to express their desire in a relationship that they may have otherwise not have considered? The film ignores this. The other fault is the naming of the characters . . . the names Sita and Radha seem contrived deliberately to shock and outrage (imagine a film in America depicting a gay relationship between a man named ""Jesus"" and another named ""Paul""!) by using names associated with various Hinddo scriptures. The film is strong enough to stand on its own and needs no such devices in my opinion. At any rate, the faults do not take much away from the power of the movie. It is indeed a very touching and powerful story -- the images and characters will stay with you a long time after you leave the theatre.",979344000,15,2650,4.522916666666666

Now that is what I call ho-bloody-hum (ahem, Mr Maltin).  This film is a blessed relief from that genre.
Although sexuality is openly portrayed and discussed in the film, intimacy between the two female protagonists is handled tastefully and without that nasty overtone of voyeuristic exploitation.  Leonard Maltin, useful though his reviews are, has a history of getting really defensive (and dismissive) about films with any feminist content.  If overbearing patriarchal authority is honestly and accurately portrayed, he's liable to diss the film as unfair to men.  Notably he has very little to say about insulting or belittling roles for *female* actors!
I thought this was a good-hearted film, honestly challenging  and critical of male privilege and selfishness, yet also extending compassion and dignity to its male as well as female characters.  Even the nastiest person in the film (the unfortunate servant) is not treated with genuine contempt by the scriptwriter or director.  Everyone gets his or her day in court; we feel a little sympathy with every character at least once or twice.
It's also a sensitive and poignant portrait of the cost of tradition, and the cost of defying tradition.

I was instantly  transported back to Delhi and could smell the spices and hear the sounds of  the street. As a widow of a man from that culture I understand from a first  hand basis the differences women face, the lack of independence that we  take for granted here. As Americans it is sometimes hard to understand the  strong bond and sense of duty that other cultures have for the family. The  social stigma carried by anybody who questions or god forbid chooses a path  other than the expectations of the family. It is hard for some to truly  understand how little freedom; either in opinion or in movement women have  in some eastern cultures. I felt this movie portrayed the life's struggle  of one family. The inertia felt when acceptance of one's circumstance no  matter how unhappy is the only option. Each character in the movie was so  carefully developed and portrayed. The older sister in whose strong yet  calm and dutiful disposition is sparked with life again upon the arrival of  her new younger sister in law. The eagerness and vibrancy of the new  arrival can be felt in every corner of the room. Yet with this vibrancy is  still a strong sense of duty to a husband who does not love her, nor does  he want her. He is chasing a woman who only uses him for her own pleasure;  he is also trapped in cultural and family expectations. I see the  attraction between the women as the joining of two kindred spirits,  searching and finding happiness in each other, when no happiness can be  found otherwise in the lives they have been forced to accept. I offer a  standing ovation to the cast and crew. A better job couldn't have been  done. It's not about lesbians, or chauvinists, it's about humanity in all  forms and the search for the humanity that matches your own. Finding your  self in another and finding them in you is an issue without borders or  culture.

It  follows the story of two sister-in-laws (Azmi and Das) who dare to fall in  love with each other.  Not only do they fall in love but they conspire to  leave their inadequate husbands.  Azmi is married to a man who is unable to  consummate their marriage, and Das' husband is unfaithful to her, desiring  his Chinese mistress over his chosen bride.

7796757,4,1567301568,"The film Fire by Deepa Mehta explores the lives of two married lesbian women in New Delhi, India. The tale of two families, both religious followers, gives an insight into the lives of married women and how homosexuality and freedom are viewed in a Hindu community. Although the film provoked controversy in India, Mehta revealed the tragic and difficult sacrifices women, especially those like Sita and Radha, must make to please their husbands, follow family tradition and hide their true feelings. The film introduces a new and unique concept of staying loyal to a religion and still being able to fulfill the sexual desires and love between two women, which is one of the four goals of Hinduism called Kama.
 The history of homosexuality in Hinduism dates way back to when the Vedas were written, which would be at about 4000 BCE to 1000 BCE. Although it is not stated in the Vedas, there is reference to homo-eroticism and pictures depicting homosexuality can be found on temples. It can also be found in the Kama Sutra. There is no one view on homosexuality from the religion because it has to be judged according to the context. However, Hinduism generally has a neutral and healthy opinion with homosexuality as there is no specific doctrine that must be followed. Hindu teachers have stated that people are born with different interests and tendencies due to their Kama in their previous life. Despite the views of Hindu teachers, the biggest conflict that many people have with homosexuality is the tradition of having an family with multiple children. Although this is slightly more cultural than religious, the conflicts with homosexuality usually lie in the desire and normality to have many children. The film mainly focused on the families who were against homosexuality and their traditional belief system. Homosexuality was viewed as a negative thing and was condemned by everyone in their household.
 The craft of this film showed both the beautiful and disturbing aspects of purity and loyalty in Hinduism. The two aspects of religion and love are shown in the film through the traditions and relationships that are formed. The traditions, such as Pujab and Karva Chauth, educated me about the devotion practices of religion while the love and marriages educated me about the emotional aspects. Additionally, the varying scenes showed the different lives of many women and men that all shared a common belief of Hinduism. Each scene reflected on many of the social injustices that Hindu women face because of how their culture has evolved. In addition to this, the film adds on another layer of inequality that the LGBTQ+ community faces everywhere in the world. However, the film shows the opinions of those who are against homosexuality in Hinduism which allows anyone in the audience to connect with the movie no matter what their opinions are.
 Personally, it was easy for me to connect with the younger character Sita. Sita is surrounded by those who have experienced and know more than her and is learning from the outcomes of her choices. While she may be young, Sita is also full of passion and excitement to learn about and explore her life. Despite the fact that I will never be in her position, I can connect my excitement and learning in my life with her motivation to find love and passion where ever it may lie. Throughout the past 14 years, I have been trying to explore my life by traveling and making the most of my opportunities and education. This is similar to how Sita tries to explore her life within the traditions of Hinduism by learning how to cook and follow Hindu marriage traditions from Radha.
 Deepa Mehta has created one of the only films in the world that explores the perspectives and lives of two lesbian Hindu women in modern India. The film spreads awareness of the hidden and challenging circumstances that would otherwise not be know to audiences around the world. Despite the small minority that fall into this category, Mehta has crafted a film that can connect with an audience to create a more accepting and empathetic society for these women. Although the film can be graphic and disturbing at times, I would rate it 4 stars for the interesting plot and unique method to educate those about Hinduism and the social pressure that comes with it.",1449532800,,4305,4.8931506849315065
7796758,4,1567301568,"The movie ""Fire"" by Deepa Mehta is a story about the battle between duty and desire.  Sita is a newly wed, but to a man, Jatin, whose heart lies elsewhere. Jatin was forced into marriage by his parents because of tradition. Radha is barren and married to a man who rejects all desire, including to matters concerning her. Through the movie, young Sita questions the way things are and soon she and Radha are caught in a lesbian love affair.

  From the two movies of hers that I've seen, Deepa Mehta is able to portray somewhat sensitive topics quite well. When it came to the relationship between Sita and Radha she did not rely on obviously sensual acts to portray their feelings for each other. Instead it was shown through small touches and small acts. This includes Sita asking Radha to oil her hair and when Radha gave Sita her water to drink during the fast. In reality it is more like this, too. It also shows Deepa Mehta's great ability at showing us the hidden feelings instead of having to bluntly throw them in the audience's faces. This movie doesn't only touch on homosexuality, but arranged marriage. There are a many scenes where the tension between husband and wife are evident. In these scenes you can tell that the wives are fed up with their husbands, but it is their ""duty"" to serve their husbands and be ""faithful"".  Near the end when there are high stakes and a plan of action needs to made there is a lot of talk about whether you should obey your duty and follow the traditions, or do what you desire. The decision is more difficult for Radha as her husband has always viewed desire as destruction. She starts to question how something that makes you feel alive, when you once felt so dead inside, could be so bad.

  I really enjoyed this movie and Mehta's other movie, ""Water"", very much and am considering watching the third one in the trilogy. I appreciate that she is not afraid to portray topics such as homosexuality, arranged marriages, suicide, prostitution, etc; Another thing I have noticed is an underlying theme in both movies. No matter the context of the film there is a choice the character must make. They must decide to follow the rules as they currently are, or they can break free in the attempt of happiness and freedom.  ""Water"" is slower in the beginning, but as the emotions start to rise and strain it does pick up the pace. Overall I really enjoyed the portrayal of the struggles and themes throughout. I rate this movie a 4/5.",1449446400,,2478,4.563063063063063

It took her several years to get funding for each, production was stopped in India when topic became known and the movies banned in India. One deals with partition into India and Pakistan, another about child widows and the third focus is a relationship between two women.  These are not new releases so harder to find all three with English/English subtitles as a single package.",1433894400,,501,4.617977528089888
