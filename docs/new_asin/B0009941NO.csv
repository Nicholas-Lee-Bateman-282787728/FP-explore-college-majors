8058491,4,B0009941NO,"I have a bunch of Kung Fu sets in my collection and this is a pretty good one, the movies are fairly entertaining and some feature zombies, vampires, ghosts, and supernatural stuff, not just your typical revenge plots. The quality of the transfers varies from film to film, and isn't great, but the transfers on this set are actually better than several other Kung Fu sets I have.",1456272000,,380,4.602941176470588
8058492,4,B0009941NO,DVD. Genre. Okay.,1426204800,,17,5.0
8058493,4,B0009941NO,"I really just bought it for the Ninja Untoichables movie included in the set.  It was surprisingly entertaining, and I hope more Pierre Kirby/Godfrey Ho flicks make it to DVD! This set is good for anyone who wants to let their hair down and watch a poorly dubbed king-fu movie!",1426204800,,277,4.54
8058494,3,B0009941NO,"I bought this pack along time ago at a best buy, and the movies aren't actually bad (though sadly are in some cases in bad quality) but it was real cheap anyway.

Kung Fu zombie: really crazy horror/comedy type movie that i wish could have been better quality

Black eagles blade: a really great intrigue movie with a famous actor (the name of whom i forget) but can be found in better quality elsewhere

monkey with 72 magic: possibly one of the only martial arts movies made on the ""journey to the west"" mythology? Never seen it anywhere else which is a shame, due to the quality presented here

Snake strikes back: Probably the best quality movie on here, and while low on plot, makes up for it with action.

Ninja Killer: ""hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"" <--- truer words have never been spoken. Watch this for the crazy plot twists and ending, (being that this is most likely a ""new"" movie which is actually two separate movies sewn together.)

Bonus note: The cover of the DVD is actually from another movie entirely which is ""kung fu hustle"" Which was probably chosen to promote the movie which i had no idea of at the time I made the purchase",1405814400,2,1158,4.438679245283019
8058495,4,B0009941NO,"Fist Full of Talons...Quality of film to dvd transfer okay.  Audio is good and shots are a little on the tight side but watchable.  Billy Chong is at his best.  The ending is cut very abruptly, but okay.  Kung-Fu Zombie...Quality of film to dvd transfer not to good, color shifts and audio dropouts occur.  Quality control could be better with film print.  Movie is a comedy, Billy Chong is funny but very talented.

8058496,1,B0009941NO,"Nothing on here reached out and grabbed me. The only real gem is Monkey King with 72 Magic, and that's only if you were a fan of the Monkey Magic series back in the 70s (80s?).

The ones that are good are only decent, and the ones that are bad are so horrible even mst3k fans will have a hard time having fun with them =\",1156032000,,321,3.8636363636363638
8058497,5,B0009941NO,"The films are not too bad on this compilation.

Unlike Martial Temple Collection they don't have a theme so it's a mixed bag of genres ranging from sword to kung fu films.

The price is what makes this set well worth buying.

10 films for under 20 dollars is a no brainer.",1149206400,,272,4.1923076923076925
