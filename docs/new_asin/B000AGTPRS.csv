8078467,1,B000AGTPRS,"I can imagine the writer, director, and actors having a good time filming this.  I can imagine them thinking how incredibly funny it all is.  But it just isn't.  The jokes are lame, and production values scarce.  The only thing worth viewing is the performance of Alison Crane in the lead female role (no offense, Dustin).  She seems to know how awful the movie is, and gives a sincere and subtly humorous performance.  Her character is the only one who behaves as if she exists in a real world, and not aware that she's in a low-budget comedy.",1152144000,,544,4.5
8078468,5,B000AGTPRS,"I rented this not knowing what it was about but it had me laughing so hard I almost peed myself.

Its about this guy who gets run over and the truck driver who ran him over has to train him for a breakdance contest.  Its a fake documentary- kinda.

Honestly its really hard to explain.  Just check it out if ya wanna laugh. It's a low budget indie flick so be ready for that.  But if you have an open heart and wanna just laugh at the world after a long hard day- check out ""The Breakdance Kid""",1130803200,4,494,4.0
