A young Nick Cuti wrote and submitted ""Grub"" to a fledgling magazine called Creepy in the early 1970's.  Joining Creature Productions, he turned the story into a feature length film.  Denis McCourt, Niki Spiridakos, Bridget Hansen, and Daryl Baldwin star in a well produced low budget space opera.

The crew of the Deep Blue Sea descends into fantasy with the star fish/eye creatures infecting the 3 x 3 ground crews.  Beautiful women seduce a 'disposable' member (who picks his nose), and 2 others are lost leaving 6 behind to live lives in suburbia near the swamps.  'Eye' symbols abound, and even the mountains include an eye in the sky. (hmmm sounds like Alan Parsons a little there).  A big question that comes up is that of reality vs illusion.  Which is more 'real'?

Over time, they live 15 years, have children, and even begin having the same dream every night.  A book collects the dream and finally awakens the 3 couples to the truth.

As a film, it is full of good direction, but as it is a low budget production, it does show the effects of that.  Blue screen effects are not so seamless.  A couple of the stunts are not as good as we have come to expect from Hollywood, and the props look too cardboardish (guns that is).  The casting is good, and only the captain is a little too pudgy for the stereotypical hero.

However, once you realize that this is a production done on a shoestring budget, you settle into a groove and roll with it.  I enjoyed it and highly recommend it for fans of space opera.
