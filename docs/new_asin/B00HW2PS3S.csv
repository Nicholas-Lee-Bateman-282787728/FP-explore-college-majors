6230141,5,B00HW2PS3S,its always great to see the wiggles. both old and new. even thou this is the same like the last one with the same songs. its always great tp see the wiggles both new and old. happy too soon add this one to collection.,1402272000,,217,3.9545454545454546
6230142,4,B00HW2PS3S,"We've watched the old group from the Wiggles in the past and have always enjoyed their songs and videos! The new group was good as well - and their songs are equally as enjoyable. We did prefer the old group over the new one though - just for some simple reasons, such as modesty is a big deal in our home, and with a girl on the new team, we did find that *some* of her outfits were a little bit immodest for our taste. Normally I would veer away from something like this. Other than that small con, the Hot Potatoes DVD is a great one full of fun songs with lots of opportunity for the kids to get involved with dancing along or doing actions!

One other point - our children range in age from 2-8 years old and I'd definitely say that this was a DVD that caught the attention of our younger ones (ages 2-6) much more than our 8 year old. In my opinion, it's a great way to encourage the love of music for younger children!",1402185600,,925,4.082417582417582
6230143,4,B00HW2PS3S,"Both my daughters loves this Hot Potatoes:The Best of The Wiggles DVD.  It was very entertaining and they enjoy watching and listening to the music.  My favourite music video is the ""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing"".  I guess I still like disco songs.  This DVD has tons of great songs - some new and some old.  The whole family enjoyed it and we had played the DVD many times.  This DVD is great for all ages and contains only kid friendly videos and songs.

6230144,4,B00HW2PS3S,"Hot Potatoes! The Best of the Wiggles DVD is unique in that it combines favorites of the Wiggles music spanning from the groups inception to the present day. It includes music from the original foursome as well as performances of more recent hits by the new cast. The DVD has some fun special features such as bloopers (which my kids thoroughly enjoyed), the Taba Naba episode from the Ready, Set, Wiggle! television series, a photo gallery and some original film clips. The DVD has a running time of about 100 minutes and contains 35 of the Wiggles most popular songs. My sons are ages 2,6 and 7 years. My older boys had watched the original cast when they were little, so it was fun to watch them reminisce over the old songs and witness their little brother now enjoying the former hits along with the new ones. The Wiggles cast may have changed over the years, but their cheerful and energetic style remains. This is like a greatest hits collection of the Wiggles!",1401840000,,968,4.601156069364162
6230145,4,B00HW2PS3S,"My Daughter has always liked the Wiggles- and calls the movies sing along songs.  She did her share of singing to the songs she knew on this new greatest hits DVD. She kept telling me there was a girl Wiggle, she was pretty impressed by that. This is the first time we have watched any Videos with the new Wiggles. She seemed to like the new as well as the old songs that were featured on this disk- and it kept her entertained on a long car ride! She especially liked wiggling along to the Fruit Salad song, and Do The Monkey! All around- perfect for my preschooler and lots of old & new Wiggley fun.",1401753600,3,601,4.181034482758621
6230146,4,B00HW2PS3S,"Disclosure:  I was sent a screener copy from the vendor in order to write up an honest review. All views shared are mine and mine alone.

What are your thoughts on the new cast members?  Both of my girls miss the original cast, and will prefer watching reruns of the old Wiggles episodes rather than the new one.  I thought they would like seeing a girl join the cast.  But, after watching the show with the new cast, like them, I can't seem to get into it.  They don't seem to have the relationship as Anthony, Greg, Jeff and Murrary.

Even though my girls are not fans of the new season, they did enjoy this recent DVD release, which features 35 favorite Wiggles songs including ""Hot Potato"", ""The Shimmie Shake!"" and my girls' favorite, ""Do the Propeller!""  Each of the 35 fan favorites will have your little one dancing and singing along.  And, when they are done enjoying these popular songs (over and over again), don't forget to check out the bonus features which include Wiggly Bloopers (always a favorite of my family, and provides great laughs), original Wiggles Film clips from 1991, a photo gallery covering the many years and cast members of the hit show, as well as the Ready, Steady, Wiggle! TV Series episode, ""Taba Naba.""

So, even if your kids are like mine and can't seem to get into the new series, with the new cast, they will still love this new DVD release, as it contains the old cast singing their hit songs.

We have owned this DVD for about a week now, and I can personally say that I am all wiggled out, thanks to the DVD being on repeat in the house and car, as the girls sing at the top of their lungs some of their favorite Wiggles songs. :-)",1400457600,12,1673,4.39935064935065

If you like the previous wiggles, this would be a good buy.  If you're a fan on the new wiggles, I'd suggest buying Apples and Bananas or Taking Off instead (which we LOVE!)",1475884800,7,512,4.1

6230246,5,B00HW2PS3S,"It is hard for me to rate this five starts because I can't stand the wiggles, but this isn't for me -- it's for my little girls who LOVE them and my wife is the stay at home mom who is exposed to them a lot more and doesn't mind them.  So, since the ones it is actually for adore the Wiggles and this whole DVD, it gets five stars.

It is a collection of much older episodes up to some of the ""newer"" ones.  Has what I believe are all of the different Wiggles (I think blue is the only one that has never changed) from over the years and a lot of their most popular sketches/songs.  It has a couple of guest appearances from ""famous"" people that you may or may not recognize as well.

To me, the most important part of it is that it is wholesome.  There is nothing that I wouldn't want my three year old or one year old watching/repeating.  If you need something to entertain your kids for a few minutes while you take care of something around the house, you could easily do much worse than the Wiggles and I would be very surprised if your little ones didn't love them.",1428537600,3,1070,4.090909090909091

6230250,2,B00HW2PS3S,"A dark night at the Wiggle's world, in this horror episode that transformed the genre by locating the monster inside ourselves. This Wiggle's masterpiece blends a brutal manipulation of audience identification and an incredibly dense, allusive visual style to create the most morally unsettling Wiggle's episode ever made. The case for the Wiggles as a modern Conrad rests on this ruthless investigation of the heart of darkness, but this episode  is uniquely Wigglodian in its positioning of the godlike mother figure. It's a deeply serious and deeply disturbing work, but the Wiggles, with their characteristic perversity, insisted on telling interviewers that it was a ""fun episode""! Macabre and deep, NOT for the faint of heart...",1422576000,2,734,5.3826086956521735

We have heard some of their sons on the radio but never seen video.  My 1-year-old danced around to the music while my other kids didn't really get into it until they began to hear songs they knew.  My 13-year-old babysitter was very disturbed by the fact that it wasn't the original cast but instead they had new cast members.  Obviously she isn't their target group so I didn't think much of her concern.  :) Overall my kids enjoyed the video and dancing to the songs.,1403740800,,612,4.380530973451328
