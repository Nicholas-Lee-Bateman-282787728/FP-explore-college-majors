8594608,4,B0095XJMOS,"VAMPIRELAND is a fun indie horror about vampires taking over the earth in a single night. The most striking aspect of the flick is how old school tough the vampires are - not a hint of romance or feelings whatsoever. They're just mean and tough monsters; not sexy in the slightest. The vampires are basically terminators!

As tough as they are, they still seem governed by the legendary rules - they can't cross running water, are afraid of crosses, and must be invited in, etc. All in all, a nice change of pace from TWILIGHT, which I am sick of at this point.

VAMPIRELAND moves from scene to scene quickly and doesn't bog down too much. The acting in general is OK, with Michael Bugard standing out as the lead vampire - boy does he have a potty mouth! Very funny at times, while still being scary.

The special effects and make up are much better then you'd think they'd be for an indie film - there's a sequence where the lead vampire battles a tank that's awesome. Good gore. Good music too.

Is it the best movie ever? Nope - but it's certainly one of the best vampire films to come out in years. It's lots of fun - this is the kind of vampire film they don't make anymore, which might be this film's greatest strength.",1346716800,4,1226,4.364035087719298
