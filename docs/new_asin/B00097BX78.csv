8058316,5,B00097BX78,I recorded this documentary back when it originally aired. Over the years it became misplaced or lost. I was happy to be able to return it to my library because it is the best documentary about a tall ship I have seen. Video tapes have a limited lifetime and I was pleased to discover that the tape was not copy protected so I was able to dub a dvd from the video.  Now I don't have to be concerned with the eventual deterioration of the vhs tape.,1303516800,,447,4.137931034482759
