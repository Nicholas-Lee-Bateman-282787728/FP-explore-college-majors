8622955,3,B00GGZ7Q4Q,Just seeing the Who clips was good.  The commentators didn't add much.,1502755200,,70,4.833333333333333
8622956,3,B00GGZ7Q4Q,"A halfway decent 2005 documentary on The Who even though none of the band members worked on this or did any special interviews for it. It does feature a lot of performance clips and two or three snippets of a Pete Townsend interview done yonks ago. You will get sick of seeing the critics and musicians explain and explain and explain why The Who were so great. Personally, I think you're much better off finding out what The Who are all about by watching a concert film or listening to their albums.

A couple of times brief lessons on how to play a song or two (including Pinball Wizard) which I liked -- and it was different from listening to the critics blab on and on.

At one point I did get so caught up in watching the Pinball Wizard footage that I burst out singing. Scared the heck out of the dog (my voice -- not The Who.)",1496188800,,833,4.232704402515723

Maybe the people who gave it less stars don't really like the band!?!",1493942400,,90,4.294117647058823

8622959,4,B00GGZ7Q4Q,"This is actually two films presented, back to back as one production,.about The Who from their first album, ""My Generation"" through ""Who Are You"" their last album before Keith Moon's death . A host of critics give their takes on each album. Also there is film footage of the band performing live and in studio. Most Who fans will have seen these film clips but it is still entertaining to see the energy of the band in performance. For people not familiar with The Who's work this is a great introduction to their music and artistic development. For fans of the band this is a very good refresher and reminder of what The Who were and their development while Moon handled the drumming.",1486598400,,685,4.5772357723577235

8622962,2,B00GGZ7Q4Q,"Nothing new to be found here on the band. Low cost production with no input from the band, just some no-name lame reviewers who somehow manage not to give Quadrophenia 5 stars. Save your money.",1391644800,,193,4.542857142857143
