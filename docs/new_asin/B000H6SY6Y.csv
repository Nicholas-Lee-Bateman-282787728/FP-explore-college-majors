2630239,5,B000H6SY6Y,"This is an absolutely terrific documentary that I first saw on ""Independent Lens"" on PBS.

As ""Sesame Street"" spreads around the world, the creators of the show go to great pains to involve local people and cultures in the local version of the show.  Oftentimes this is happening in unstable countries and involves considerable risk on the part of the producers.  The rhythm of the film builds and builds, the tension rises, and it becomes quite an emotional journey.

At first you may wonder why it's important - why do the kids of war-ravaged Bosnia need Muppets?  But when you see the desperate conditions of these kids, you are made to realize how important a tiny bit of education - even via TV - can be in the life of a truly vulnerable child.

I found myself caring a great deal about whether or not the producers would get ""Sesame Street"" on the air in Bangladesh.  I had tears in my eyes watching a bunch of kids clustered around a TV, watching the first show ever created to help them learn more.

This is a wonderful piece of film work, an inspiring story, and an unscripted drama all in one.  I'm not even a big fan of the Muppets, to tell the truth - but I loved this film.",1163030400,21,1186,4.378995433789954

8137267,5,B000H6SY6Y,I had to watch this for an Education class and I loved it so much I purchased it. It really touched my heart in so many ways. This is not a documentary for children (WHICH was not the intention) so I do not know why people are negatively commenting on this. This is definitely a good political documentary.,1392422400,,306,4.293103448275862
8137268,4,B000H6SY6Y,"This documentary is an in-depth look at how productions of acclaimed children's show Sesame Street ""translates"" into similar series in other countries. While this movie is not for children, it does share the thoughtful, caring process used to include each country's unique set of values and issues in a children's show.  The DVD does not have any special features - I was hoping to see one international episode in its entirety so I could see the final product after watching the behind-the-scenes work that goes into making it.  But the documentary itself does show clips from a handful of various countries.",1182902400,2,609,5.01980198019802
8137269,3,B000H6SY6Y,"I found it very interesting to learn about how sesame street was branching out into other cultures and countrys, but I had expected it would be more like a sesame street episode exploring different cultures and countries. I was hoping for something for my kids to enjoy and learn from instead of a documentary. My kids weren't interested and I didn't even watch the whole thing.",1179964800,,378,4.742424242424242
8137270,5,B000H6SY6Y,"If you like Sesame Street and its history and worldwide scope, then this is a DVD you'll enjoy. It won't hold the attention of small children who are expecting Elmo to pop out singing the ABCs.

This is more in-depth regarding the making of the Sesame Street franchise around the world.",1175299200,6,286,4.607843137254902
8137271,2,B000H6SY6Y,"I love the muppets, but find this particular SS episode too politically-correct for my kid.  Given the fact most other peoples want us Americans dead and our great nation destroyed, I think we should teach our kids how to defend themselves and their homeland, instead of making friends with people who hate us and want us slaughtered.",1173744000,4,334,4.859649122807017
8137272,5,B000H6SY6Y,"This is a wonderful film that demonstrates that Sesame Street's core strength  lies not in its characters, but in its process for uncovering and manifesting each culture's core values - while staying true to Sesame Street's core values of equality, equal opportunity and hope.  Inspiring, fun, educational and very, very moving.  A model for any and all cross-cultural discussions.",1168300800,6,381,5.423728813559322
