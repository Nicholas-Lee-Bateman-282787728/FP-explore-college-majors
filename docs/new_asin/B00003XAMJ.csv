7919574,4,B00003XAMJ,"In ICWS, Joe leaves his small country town for the big city. Once there, he meets Tina. She's a nice simple girl who works at a club where she performs live sex acts onstage for the audience. Joe gets a job at the club, and eventually becomes a performer himself because of a certain part of his physique, where nature was very generous. The movie turns all of this into a very predictable love story that's every bit as campy as it sounds.

The story obviously provides plenty of opportunities for the cast to have sex. There are ten sex scenes. Eight are boy/girl, one is girl solo, and one is girl/girl. The women in this are all smoking hot and include Brande Roderick, Ahmo Hight, Monique Parent, Nancy O'Brien, and Taimie Hannum. Unfortunately, the sex scenes don't really utilize the women to their fullest potential. Several of them were a bit too short and a couple were too tame. For instance, in the solo scene, Ahmo seems to have some magical ability to achieve orgasm without actually doing the things to herself that would be necessary for that to happen. And there is no sex at all in the girl/girl scene. Brande and Taimie just shower together.

I still recommend this. Brande Roderick is one of the few Playboy Playmates (Miss April 2000) who has appeared in softcore. You get to see a lot of her here. She has five scenes in this movie and hasn't appeared in much else. Similarly, Ahmo Hight has a body that must be seen to be believed, and you'll see more of it here than in anything else she's done.",1143763200,6,1519,4.48014440433213
7919575,5,B00003XAMJ,"This wasn't a great movie, even by softcore standards, but it does it's job.  A barely-there plot combined with pretty, yet flexible women equals a decent way to spend 85 minutes.  Ahmo Hight doesn't get as flexible in this movie as she does in Hotel Exotica, but she's good to look at anyway.  Once again, Monique Parent steals the show.  This time around she's a primary character instead of a supporting character like in the first ""Club Wild Side"" movie.  Look for plenty of naked chicks; don't look for anything else.",1020038400,4,522,4.6923076923076925
