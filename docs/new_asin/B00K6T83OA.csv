I can honestly say that this is the first one I would actually recommend to my players. The drills that Jesse explains and demonstrates so well are the core fundamentals that a basketball player MUST have to be successful.  Thank you Jesse LeBeau for such a wonderful product!",1412467200,,403,4.597222222222222
8656448,5,B00K6T83OA,"This DVD exceeded expectations. Solid fundamentals with a modern approach, plus awesome music and filming. So many of these instructional dvd's have a look and feel of ""old time"", and the quality is extremely poor. BUT this DVD makes it is easy to select drills and tailor the workouts needed on different days. There are terrific break downs of various drills in slow motion, amazing filming, and upbeat modern tunes. Jesse did an awesome job on this DVD! I look forward to reading his inspirational, autobiography, ""Among the Giants"", that will be released Oct 7, 2014.",1410825600,,571,4.958333333333333
