8214453,5,B0002VEPEY,What a great video! I have bought several workout videos in the past few years but none of them have motivated me to stick to them until now. I look forward to working out!!!,1127606400,2,174,4.147058823529412
8214454,5,B0002VEPEY,"A friend of mine I noticed started losing weight FAST. She tuned me into the magick of Tae Bo so I went and purchased my own copy. I BLASTED through a weight loss plateau in less than two weeks! After that time I gasped when I saw the scale. I couldn't believe any workout could have that great of results in such a shorter time period. I own several other kickboxing tapes/dvds but this is the first Tae Bo one I ever owned. Billy Blanks says wonderful encouraging things and uses REAL women/men in his video and my FAVORITE part that made me stick with it when I thought I was too tired was when he pointed out a certain woman and said how she had two c sections and was told she could never get her stomach back but here she was with rock hard abs. He goes on to say things like ""This will be YOU. You will have a stomach like this."" You get to workout while the camera focuses on healthy/toned men and women of a realistic size. You don't have to workout while being forced to look at women the size of twizzle sticks and compare. After you make it through this tape you feel wonderful and inspired to keep it up. It helped give me a better self image and it goes at a paced you can go slower/faster however  you choose. I started seeing my abs getting toned within that two week period. I plan to go broke buying ever Tae Bo tape there is. Go for it. You won't regret it.",1100476800,13,1376,4.115241635687732
