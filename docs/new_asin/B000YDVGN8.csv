3028129,5,B000YDVGN8,"Wow! It's hard to put this one into words.

I bought ""Earthly Edens: Kauai"" to use as background when I read or work. Today I decided to try it for the first time. The scenery is so stunning that I couldn't take my eyes off of it. It's as intense as you want it to be. Just turn the sound lower and it's calming. Turn up the sound and it's invigorating, just as if you were standing there on the beach with loud crashing waves or the rushing water from a selection of Kauai's many waterfalls. I found later that in order to read or study, the sound has to be at a lower non-distracting level.

Most of it includes the ocean with magnificent waves crashing onto the beaches, but there are also multiple scenes with waterfalls, streams, a river, etc. The combination of sights and sounds ends up being so very relaxing.

At one point I actually felt my tension disappearing and I hadn't even been aware I was tense. I felt totally relaxed and was breathing deeper.

There's no narration. You don't need it. This isn't a travel video. What you have here is an experience of Kauai, the way I remember it at least. My favorite parts of Kauai are included. Wisely, the camera doesn't just briefly scan through a scene like a travel video, but it stays there, often for a couple of minutes, just as if you were really there, enjoying Kauai in person.

You just need a little bit of wet sand under your feet. Pull up a chair, or better yet a hammock, get yourself a refreshing drink, get barefoot and comfortable. You're in for an experience. Well done!

Tomorrow I think I'll try the ""Earthly Edens: Bora Bora"" DVD.",1267920000,14,1608,4.397306397306397
3028130,5,B000YDVGN8,"45 minutes of perfect tropical island scenes! All nature, from the shore, to inland vistas, waterfalls, and closeups of small streams, waterfalls and tropical plants. The soundtrack is only natural sounds. Video and audio quality are excellent to very good. This video is better than being there since there are no distracting crowds. (And it's cheaper.)",1265587200,3,354,5.339285714285714
3028131,5,B000YDVGN8,"I thoroughly enjoyed Earthly Edens:  Bora Bora, and I was delighted to find this companion DVD exploring the scenic beauty of another paradise on earth, Kauai.  You can pop in this DVD, kick your shoes off, and relax with the incredible sights and sounds of Kauai.  You may even find yourself thinking that you are on the beach and not your living room!

I sometimes wonder if travel planners and travel agents use the Earthly Edens DVDs... they will certainly make you think about visiting Kauai and Bora Bora yourself!",1259107200,,520,4.7444444444444445
3028132,5,B000YDVGN8,Earthly Edens: Kauai is an excellent relaxation video.  The imagery and sounds of the island are mesmerizing.  Highly recommended for yoga and meditation. One can get lost in time and find freedom from worries while enjoying this masterpiece by Horton Productions. Definitely 5 stars.,1238025600,,284,5.431818181818182
3028133,5,B000YDVGN8,"I've enjoyed the Bora Bora dvd from Earthly Edens so much that I decided to purchase their Kauai dvd.  Due to its larger size, Kauai has some geographic features that Bora Bora does not.  So this DVD shows several waterfalls, plains, and a river.  I think the Bora Bora dvd showed a stream that was flowing after a rainfall.  Unfortunately, the Kauai dvd doesn't have any scenes where it is raining.  But maybe the Kauai sunset scenes are a little more colorful. Both DVDs have wallpaper of various resolutions.

This dvd has the same excellent video and audio quality that the Bora Bora dvd has.",1235174400,3,596,4.628571428571429
3028134,5,B000YDVGN8,"The DVD brought pleasure to my parents whom we are planning a Kauai trip for their 50th anniversary.  They wanted to know more about Kauai before they arrived there.  This DVD truly measured up.  They were excited about the spectacular scenery that was displayed in HD.  Sights included many beach scenes, waterfalls, canyons, valleys, natural flowers/foliage, sunset scenes.  The entire length of the DVD includes natural sounds including birds, waves, wildlife.....  If you are looking for a DVD with commentary and history, this DVD is not for you.  This is more like a relaxation, picturial DVD.",1228608000,8,599,5.177083333333333

8232422,4,B000YDVGN8,Well this DVD is beautiful it shows various scenic spots on the island of Kauai my issue is I'm getting ready to go there and it would be really nice if it said the name of the places there is no narration at all and there is no music that said it would be good as a meditation to relax at night.,1504310400,,296,3.7903225806451615

8232428,1,B000YDVGN8,"After reading all the great reviews on this DVD and then actually watching the DVD I wonder how and in the world it got so many great reviews! This was the lamest video I've ever seen! The scenes shot were pathetic. I've watched other DVDs of Kauai and the scenery left you breathless. This DVD; however, clips of a close-up of rocks in a stream... a flower blowing in the wind... the ocean water coming in with a tiny hill in the background. THIS DVD WAS A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT! On a brighter note, the video quality was great. There was no narration in the entire DVD which really didn't bother me as I was more concerned with the scenery than a narration. I liked how it had stationary clips of scenery of Kauai for about 60 seconds with about 30 or so clips total on the DVD. However, A BIG HOWEVER, the scenes shot were just pathetic and looked like a low low budget production. Let me give you an example of how lame this DVD was. There was one clip of a baby waterfall in the background of one scene. The next clip of 60 seconds the producer zoomed in a little more. The next 60 second clip the producer zoomed in more. The waterfall was just the saddest thing you've ever seen in your life. The same applied to the rocks in the stream. Closer, a little closer and then a little closer. If you're looking for a travel video of Kauai so you can have a sense of what to expect, I can almost assure you that you'll regret spending your money on this and you might even want to cancel your plans to Kauai after seeing this DVD. If you're looking for a relaxation video of scenes of what would seem the coast of Ohio, this would be up your alley. No, nothing wrong with Ohio, but the beauty and grandeur of Kauai doesn't even compare to that of a beach in Ohio. And honestly, that's the impression you are left with after watching this!",1357084800,,1838,4.269340974212034
8232429,5,B000YDVGN8,"I bought this DVD as a gift for my hubby for his 1st Father's Day with OUR son (yours, mine, and ours).  We got married on one of the island's many beautiful beaches last year, and fell in LOVE with it.  This DVD truly highlights one of the reasons we fell in love with the island:  It's amazing beauty and tranquility.  Whether you are just looking for a DVD for relaxation exercises, or something to remind you of that wonderful trip you took to Kaua'i, you cannot go wrong with this DVD.  I loved it, and so did he!  :)",1276473600,2,522,4.17
8232430,3,B000YDVGN8,"If you want a video of some of the same areas of the island, but from different angles, or to fall asleep to something peaceful, this DVD is for you. I thought the scenes would be of beautiful vistas all over the island, maybe with narration, but this was not the case. There seems to have been only a few specific areas highlighted, from many different vantage points.",1274313600,6,369,4.4411764705882355
