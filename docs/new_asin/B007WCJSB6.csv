8522507,5,B007WCJSB6,"There been a number of books, documentaries, films, footage plus theories and the aftermath what really went down that fateful day which forever changed America and the entire world included. Such a sad and tragic story but almost like a nightmare you've never expected or hope to see. It goes to show why who we are in today's world and why at the moment we got to rewrite history and re-educate ourselves.

Without going into no speculation, mess nor details, I feel I have to review this from the bottom of my heart. I couldn't get it outta my hand while watching it numerous times plus several others I seen in the past. Dr. King was our real Faith, our real Hope to why we must carry on the legacy and help one another. Today as we know in this world is not where it used to be back then, it constantly changes all the time.

If if weren't for Dr. King, JFK, RFK and Malcolm X whom all die during their times in the 1960s and why they all been killed by gunpoint is a warning sign to let us know why there's no need to hate, nor criticize, nor put down, nor judge but to love and appreciate one another, the truth we ask ourselves where will we be if it weren't for their legacies?

Ok, back on the documentary, great props to Tom Jennings for directing this feature with alot of footage that's already been seen or not yet seen since the assassination, I wish it was even a bit longer but who knows? Very mind blogging, strong, informative and researchable in its own right.

People who need to hear the real truth and why should watch this plus dig into William Pepper's books on the King assassination, the trial plus the aftermath, the King miniseries with Paul Winfield, Conspiracy? episode on King assassination, Betty and Coretta TV movie, RFK TV movie, Robert Kennedy and His Times TV Miniseries, Ripple of Hope documentary, to name a few.",1405296000,,1852,4.438235294117647
8522508,3,B007WCJSB6,This documentary is basicly clips and reruns of all versions past. No new information. If you've read the story....this will be boring! Very dissapointed.,1380499200,,154,5.458333333333333

8522510,5,B007WCJSB6,"This DVD was produced for the Smithsonian. It contains some news footage that was transmitted in limited areas and not rebroadcast.  I saw this on television and purchased it for donation to the University library where I work.  Before it's donation, it was reviewed by the librarian in charge of African American Studies.  She recommended it's inclusion in our collection.  While the dvd is not long, it is very powerful, and gives an insight into that tumultuous time that cost us Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.",1370736000,,510,4.895348837209302
8522511,3,B007WCJSB6,"Pros:Colour film of events surrounding the assassination with very good picture quality considering age.

Cons:The title of this dvd is misleading,it should refer to events surrounding the assassination. A very short
  section given to the actual murder by forces unknown. 46 minutes long overall,should be double that.

Summary:This dvd is suitable for 12 year olds,as a starter on the subject. If you want to go straight for the
  main meal then watch Evidence of Revision which by comparison is for adults only.",1358208000,2,514,5.2073170731707314
