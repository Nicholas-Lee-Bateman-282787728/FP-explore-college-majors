8467645,5,B001675YMU,"THIS VIDEO IS A STORY ABOUT THE 48TH ASSAULT HELICOPTER COMPANY, ONE OF THE MANY U. S. ARMY AVIATION UNITS WHICH PARTICIPATED IN OPERATION LAMSON 719.  THE STORYLINE HIGHLIGHTS THE DIFFICULT AND DEMANDING OPERATIONAL TEMPO OF AN ASSAULT HELICOPTER COMPANY AS PILOTS AND CREWMEN FLEW INTO THE ""JAWS OF THE TIGER"" EVERY DAY FOR OVER A THREE MONTH PERIOD.  THEY DID SO WHILE LIVING, OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THEIR AIRCRAFT UNDER THE MOST AUSTERE CONDITIONS AND ENDURING CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE ENEMY.

THE UNIT'S ""JOKER"" GUN PLATOON DEDICATED ITSELF TO THE MISSION OF PROTECTING THE LIFT SHIPS AND, THROUGH THE SACRIFICE OF TEN OF THEIR PILOTS AND CREWMEN, ENSURED THAT NOT A SINGLE MEMBER OF THEIR LIFT PLATOONS WAS LOST. THIS DVD, THROUGH THE EYES OF THE LIFT CREWS THEY SUPPORTED, TELLS THE STORY OF EACH OF THOSE ""JOKER"" CREWS WHO WERE KILLED IN ACTION OR STILL REMAIN MISSING IN ACTION WHILE SHOWING HOW THE MEN OF THE UNIT ENDURED UNDER THE MOST DEMANDING AND DANGEROUS CONDITIONS.

THE REAL TIME AUDIO, INTEGRATION OF ACTUAL 8MM FOOTAGE OF MISSIONS, USE OF PERSONAL PHOTOGRAPHS AND AN INTERVIEW WITH AN ENEMY SOLDIER WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE UNIT MAKE THIS A VERY COMPELLING VIDEO.  THE PRODUCER, TED DUVAL, DOES A TREMENDOUS JOB TELLING THIS UNBELIEVABLE STORY OF A HEROIC UNIT WHOSE PILOTS AND CREWMEN WERE TRULY SOME OF THE UNSUNG HEROES OF AN OPERATION WHICH IS RECORDED AS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN THE VIETNAM WAR.",1348185600,4,1441,4.91358024691358
