8557241,5,B00ARWWRYS,I rented this movie once from Redbox for my son and he could not stop talking about it. I didn't know he wanted a copy until after we returned it and I couldn't remember the name of it. After a year of sporadic reminders from him I finally found out what it was called and tracked it down. I got it juts in time for his birthday and he was so excited. He loved this movie and the dreamcatcher (which he asked for) more than all the toys he got. Not your conventional 6 year old but definitely a happy one :-),1443571200,,508,3.9901960784313726

Somewhere on the way he discovers he's part of some kind of universel Alinement by music>also he can change his shape to any animal,but why not people also.
