7754521,3,B01G43HFDQ,"Allow me to preface this with the statement that the show itself is AMAZING!!!!!!!! This is my favorite show EVER and I'm beyond sad that the fourth season will be its last! That said, this DVD set was disappointing. I rarely buy DVD sets of shows anymore because it's easier & takes up less space to just buy the digital versions online. However, for a select few shows, I also enjoy the DVD sets. The first two seasons of Reign had special features in their DVD sets - including deleted scenes. This set, unless I'm missing something, has NOTHING EXTRA. You get the episodes & that is it. I don't know why they stopped including special features in the DVDs, but there's no point in buying the DVD set if you can get the exact same episodes online. Disappointed in that.",1482710400,4,772,4.4822695035460995

Reign (2013-2017) is a silly, talky, dumb version of a castle and royalty show. The scenery, locations, and costumes are beautiful, but the characters, dialog, and situations are stupid. Reign joins the ranks of other inferior castle and royalty shows such as Camelot (2011), The White Queen (2013), and World Without End (2012). If you want to read some of the many things I didn't like about Reign skip down a few paragraphs past my recommendations of better shows to watch instead of wasting your time with Reign.

If you want to see a good castle and royalty show watch Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The Last Kingdom (2015- ), Merlin (2008-2012), Pillars of the Earth (2010), The 10th Kingdom (2000), The Tudors (2007-2010), or the Vikings (2013- ).

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), and Taken (2002), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.

Reign began as a show about Mary, Queen of Scots. By the last season it had morphed into a show mostly not about Mary, into a show about the French Court and Queen Elizabeth of England. Meanwhile Mary was forgotten in Scotland. The last scene in the final episode of this mess is a mashup of parts of scenes from earlier seasons in the show, as if to remind viewers, Hey, remember when this was a show about Mary?

Reign started off with an obnoxious drumbeat, which constantly thumped in the first episode, which thankfully was toned down in the second episode and eventually went away, otherwise I wouldnt have been able to watch the whole series. The series started as a sort of a silly fashion show/music video thing, then turned into a somber show with numerous scenes of Mary crying and making silly pronouncements, during the scenes that were actually about Mary. Like some other four season series such as Farscape (1999-2003) and Enterprise (2001-2005) the first two seasons of Reign were better than the last two seasons.

I liked the character Megan Follows played in Anne of Green Gables (1985), but I didn't like the despicable character she played in Reign. When Mary isn't throwing the scheming, treacherous character Follows plays into the dungeon they're hugging. Its ridiculous.

One of the many things about Reign that annoyed me was the formulaic, repetitive scene structure. The scenes were so predictable the show became boring. Heres an example of a typical scene: Two characters talk. Background music begins playing. One of the characters talks faster as the music swells into a crescendo and then the character delivers a declarative statement in a loud voice as the music reaches a climax, then flash cut to black. There are literally dozens of these repetitive scene structures in a single episode, which means there can be hundreds of them in a single season. The scenes were so predictable they put me to sleep. Slight variations of these repetitious scenes have one of the characters suddenly kiss the other character or start ripping their clothes off as the music swells to a climax, then flash cut to black.

Its hard to like moronic characters. In the first episode Mary sees a girl die after eating food meant to assassinate her, Mary, Queen of Scots. Later Mary survives another attempt to poison her at the castle. Then Mary is raped. Does Mary learn? No. She constantly courts danger by forever wandering around the castle alone, into the estates, and the woods by herself, and goes sailing all by her lonesome, without guards or a single servant as an escort, so that assassins and rapists have constant access to her. She doesnt learn. She doesnt change. Shes a moron.

Mary, Queen of Scots, is the character viewers are supposed to care about, at least at the beginning of the series. I don't know what character the viewer was supposed to care about in the fourth and final season. After Bash (Sebastian) disappeared in the beginning of the final season I didn't care about any of the remaining characters, including Mary.",1522627200,,5221,5.087616822429907
