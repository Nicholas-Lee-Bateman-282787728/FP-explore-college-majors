2099510,5,B0002J58HY,"This is the best fitness concept that I have run across in a very long time.  All fads and trends aside, this is a basic necessity for anyone who is trying to get fit, lose weight, or stay fit.  Whether you are a beginner or a pro, you can use this DVD.  You have your cardiovascular/aerobic workout, upper body toning, lowerbody toning, and ab workout all on one DVD, with different fitness levels included.  No more popping in several tapes to get your daily workout.  Everything you need is all on this one DVD. Simple as that. What could be better?",1102377600,19,552,4.425742574257426
2099511,5,B0002J58HY,"Having recently decided to get fit, I searched and searched for an exercise video that could take me from beginner to as advanced as I want to be in just a few short weeks.  The custom workout is perfect for gaining not only strength but confidence in the fact that you know you are getting better with each workout.  I have only been using this DVD for 5 weeks and can now make it through 95% of the abs workout without missing a beat...and that's after laying on the floor through most of it the first time (I'm 44)!!  I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to get fit and stay fit.",1101427200,209,588,4.232142857142857

I have many videos/DVDs in my collection but this one I keep coming back to again and again.  Many times, I do a different video, but put this one in for a round of legs and abs.  The sections are only 10 minutes each, so there is plenty of time to fit it all in.  For anyone trying to lose weight and just starting out, this is a must have!",1099612800,10,447,3.868131868131868

This is the first cardio-type workout I've done with her and she was so upbeat and energetic!  Much different from her relaxing tone in the pilates tapes.  I love how I can choose which workout to do...this way I won't get bored by doing the same thing over and over again.  What a great way to keep things new and exciting.  Overall, I love this video and can't wait to see the results!",1098835200,7,486,4.228260869565218

2099516,5,B0002J58HY,"I bought this because I like the option of short workouts and the programming ability.  I am a beginner and this is a DVD I can grow with.  This would also be good for intermediate.  If you are advanced, it would be good for light days or you could do more of the workouts back to back.

Here is what you get:

2 - 20 min. Cardio (low and high intensity)
3 - 10 min. Upper Body (low, med., and high intensity)
3 - 10 min. Lower Body (low, med., and high intensity)
1 - 10 min. abs section
1 - 10 min  stretch section

These are good workouts especially the toning sections for medium and high intensity! The cardio isn't exciting but it gets the job done.  These workouts don't require much space.  All you need is weights and a chair for the toning.

If you don't take to Denise's personality style then don't buy this.  I personally feel she really cares, is sincere and wants to motivate you so she does not annoy me.

This one DVD will add a lot of versatility to your exercise routine!! (and you get alot of different routines for the money!)",1094774400,452,1047,4.206030150753769

This is a great idea; you can select what order the routines go in so you can focus on different areas. There's cardio, and strength training so you can mix it up.

Denise Austin is by far my favorite fitness trainer because she gets the job done and her programs are in easy to manage increments. Plus she is good about giving you time to warm up and cool down without feeling bored. Plus she offers time in the middle for that as well.",1416614400,3,630,4.0

I have enjoyed mastering each level and moving up to the next. There is only one abs segment, but some of the exercises can be done different ways depending on your fitness level.

I prefer to do abs first, and then either lower and upper body strength work or cardio, or both if my baby stays asleep long enough. I read that someone complained that Denise says ""one more time"" and then does three or four more sets. She doesn't in any of the low intensity workouts, but she does say ""one more time"" and then does one more set, so maybe that's what they were thinking.

Denise does a great job cheering you on, explaining moves and what muscles you are using, reminds you to stand straight and tuck in that tummy, she is fantastic. I have several from her collection so it was no surprise when this became one of my favorites.

I like that you can pick higher or lower intensities, or if you want to work a particularly muscle group, you could do low, medium, and high and get a really good workout.  I get bored easily, so I have several DVD's and different pieces of exercise equipment, and I do keep this in my rotation, but not for cardio.  You seem to need a huge room to really follow along with the cardio, and I don't have it, so maybe that is part of it.  I feel like I am constantly running out of space.  She does have some good low-impact moves, though, if you need that.  I was hoping to get some good cardio out of it, so that's why I am just saying 3 stars.",1350604800,,724,4.099290780141844
2099543,5,B0002J58HY,"This DVD is great for anyone looking to get off the couch and start exercising again. The low intensity is only 20 minutes long, and that is perfect for someone just getting started. There are also great ab, upper body, lower body and strecthing segments that can be added to your workout. Finally, when you master the low intensity workout, or if you just want to mix things up, you can try the high intensity workout.

One other great feature with this DVD system is that you can set the audio to ""Denise with Music"" or ""Just Music""(great for those who can only handle so much of her perkiness).

Cardio is only 20 min and there's only 1 variety of cardio but hey, you can put leg  high intensity before or after it and there you got your 30 minutes! I just love this one. You don't have to keep changing channels and clicking dvd to pause or switch something on the menu; you set it up and off you go. I love Denise! She is so encouraging and easy to follow. She doesn't complicate things yet as many years as I have been working out with her (and other trainers too) she doesn't bore me! I hate doing same routines and switch from dvd to dvd all the time and yet she is one of my most favorites!!!! If you are considering to buy a set as opposed to renting or borrowing from the library, you should get this one for sure!!!! It has various intensities and you can mix and match so amazingly!!!

2099546,3,B0002J58HY,"I really feel like I get a good workout with this DVD.  I enjoy the customizable cardio/strength combinations, and my abs feel nice and sore afterward.  But the inconsistency of the reps sort of bothers me.  She often says ""two more"" [reps], and there will actually be either more or less than two.  She jumps into new moves and reps without warning and if you haven't done the workout a million times (as I have) you won't be able to keep up.  The pacing is also a bit terrible.  I always thought the standard number of reps should be 8, or at least an even number, but she switches around and does odd numbers of reps - like 11.  That said, this DVD is one of the reasons I lost weight several years ago, and I'm determined it will help me lose weight again.",1309132800,2,760,4.236111111111111

2099548,5,B0002J58HY,"This is my absolute favorite workout video!! I've owned it for over 5 years, and it still remains one of my favorite at-home workouts.  I try to get to the gym whenever possible, but when I can't, I always turn to this workout video.  I think it's great that you can choose the intensity level you want (high, medium, low), and choose to do any or all of the different workouts (Aerobic workout, Upper body workout, Lower body workout, Ab workout, Stretching).  I usually pick the high intensity aerobic workout, followed by the medium intensity upper body, the medium intensity lower body, and the ab workout, and by the end I feel like I've gotten an amazing workout and worked every muscle I own! Even on medium intensity, there are parts of the upper body workout I still can't hack (tricep push-ups!), and I like to think of myself in reasonably good condition (hit the gym 1-2 times a week on average, albeit mostly just the treadmill).  So I think the video offers plenty of difficulty for those who want it.  I've had noticeable results from using this video - especially in my abs.  I used to do crunches all the time, and I never got the results that I get from the ab workout in this video.  When Denise says that you will target the abs ""below the belly button"", she is not kidding!  I love how optimistic and encouraging she is too!  One of my favorite quotes is ""Keep going! We're burning butter!"" - I always think of it whenever I'm doing other workouts too and want to push myself!  This video is definitely a keeper - it never gets old, and I highly encourage those who are considering it to buy it!",1301702400,6,1616,4.447457627118644

Very good instructions, and I have always appreciated Denise Austin's enthusiasm and sincerity and passion in her work.

I'm at a beginner to intermediate level and went from 3 pound to 5 pound weights in just a week. I really like the low to med workouts best and I like the fact that it works all the muscles in my body. It has such a big variety to choose from and  only 10min each, with the custom options I have no excuse not to find time. The time goes by fast but I do feel it working. Plus Denise Austin has such a cheerful fun and positive encouraging personality. She has a nice soothing soft husky voice. I personal don't want to feel like I'm working out with an angry drill sargeant.  I don't mind her being chatty, I need to be encouraged and reminded to hold my shoulders straight and zip up my abs since these are problems for me. I also feel inspired that Denise is now 52 years old and the mother of 2 children and still has a gorgous feminine figure. This video may not be the hardest workout out there, but I don't want to workout to the point of pure exhaustion, if I did I would never look foward to the workout and be finding excuses not to do it.

2099558,3,B0002J58HY,"I love Denise Austin as a person, and I have become very toned doing her workouts. I use this workout in my weekly rotation, but two things about Denise's DVD's drive me crazy.

First, there is no rhyme or reason to the instructions she gives vs. what is actually happening. She'll often say ""Okay, two more!"" and she'll do one. Or she'll say ""This is the last one"" and then do 4 more. I know what reps and sets are - so I'm not confused. She converses so much that I think she can't keep up with where she is in the set. This is why you'll see her backup crew being off count. Also, she'll do a move 16 times and then the next time it's four. She needs to be more consistent in her count.

The major thing that bugs me, particularly in this video (and I only have done the high intensity section), is the camera shots. If Denise is instructing me and changes to a new move - the camera should be on her, not on a backup person. There is one move in the aerobic section where everytime she announces a move, the camera goes off of her to a shot of her backup person, and it's not even a full body shot. There is no excuse for such horrible editing.

You can get in GREAT shape with DA workouts, even if they don't seem all that taxing. Where Denise excels is on the strength-training and floor work. She is much clearer about how to do the moves and what the move is doing for you. If she could become more consistent and quality oriented in her aerobic sections, the workouts would be even better. Oh, and one more thing - she throws in moves just to jazz up a certain set (""okay, turn here!""). This turn adds no benefit to the workout, it just confuses the move. That's not necessary. And that's not so much in this workout but in others of hers that I have.

I love Denise, but she needs to hire a new cameraperson, editor, and put some thought into her routines.",1263686400,3,1866,4.160664819944598
2099559,4,B0002J58HY,"I recently started incorporating cardio into my yoga and walking exercise and Denise Austin's DVD's have helped me do this easily.  She makes her workouts fast, effective, safe and time efficient.

This DVD is no different. There are two 20 minute cardio sections...both of them effective, challenging (at least for me) and fun.  I notice that within minutes of working out with Denise I am feeling good.  I love that I can squeeze in just 20 minutes to get in my cardio and then go about my day.

I am not as crazy about the toning only because the ""low"" and ""medium"" intensities move very, very slow for me...but that doesn't mean they are not worthwhile or that they won't work for you. I am used to more yoga/dance/pilates style and perhaps they are too basic for me.  The ""high"" intensity toning is better but I still prefer to use the ball or other workouts as they just feel more interesting.

My only other wish for her workouts is to have more interesting music!  The music, although cheerful and upbeat, is kind of banal.  How much more fun it would be with more fun music.

One warning for those with small living rooms. In Denise's workouts she moves...but not too much (four walks to right and left and front and back). If you have a small living room like mine you will have to adjust and get creative.  Also, even though Denise wears sneakers I do all her workouts barefoot on a carpet and it works.

Although not my favorite Denise Austin DVD it's a worthwhile one.  A workout where you get so many choices and two very nice, quick, low impact, effective cardios to turn to.",1262736000,3,1590,4.498257839721254
2099560,4,B0002J58HY,"I love this DVD. I like that I can pick and choose what I want to do. The high-impact cardio workout wasn't the most intense workout I have ever done - but it was FUN! I actually look forward to doing it after work! I mistakenly thought that maybe the abs workout would be easy, but it is a tough, effective workout. The yoga-inspired stretch is the perfect way to unwind after exercising. It's only about 10 minutes long, so I'm trying to end my other workouts with that, too. Finally, Denise Austin's attitude is amazing. Every stretch is ""wonderful"" or ""my favorite."" She loves what she does and that attitude is contagious! (In fact, I am writing this minutes after doing the dvd because I wanted to share it, too!)",1260576000,,719,4.4961832061068705

2099562,4,B0002J58HY,"This is a decent workout dvd.  I have grown to get over Denise's perky personality and focus in on her strengths.

This dvd works perfectly for me because each segment is fairly short so that by the time I've finished with one, I feel motivated and encouraged to do another segment.  I actually prefer the intermediate lower body workout rather than the advanced.  I put on three pound ankle weights, do the beginner lower body segment and then the intermediate segment.  After that I move on to upper body, abs and then stretch.  a pretty good workout.",1250640000,,553,4.649484536082475

AND I LOVE IT. Denise Austin is one of the best things i discover in USA. She helps me to lose my weight, to be in shape...

The dvd is easy to follow and you can increase your levels. Denise tells you always some explanation and the way she is motivating and smiling help us to go on.

Well done !",1244592000,,463,3.7142857142857144
2099564,5,B0002J58HY,"This was my first experience with Denise Austin. Whenever I had caught a few minutes of her show on TV I always thought, ""What is WRONG with that woman?"" But, now that I've experienced her workouts I really enjoy her personality. She is peppy and encouraging and you can't help but feel energized by her enthusiasm.

As for the workouts, I am doing all the low level stuff because I am not in shape at all. They kick my butt, however, not in an exhausting painful way. I feel really worked out and stretched after doing the aerobics routine and then all of the toning and stretching. The aerobics section has variety but is not so complicated that it is hard to follow (like a lot of other aerobics workouts).

The customize option is really wonderful because you can vary intensities depending on your fitness level or, if you're pressed for time you can just do a couple of segments.

I love the low intensity option for the cardio segment since I have touchy knees and ankles. The only thing is if i'm feeling good in the knees and ankles I go for the high intensity and that it's more challenging, which I like, but I definitely could not do it on a daily basis with past knee surgery and many ankle injuries in volleyball. Oh well, however I VERY MUCH ENJOY HER UPPER, LOWER, and AB WORKOUTS! The low, medium, and high intensity for all 3 are great! You can really feel your muscles get worked! Its great also because its broken down so well you don't need to rush to buy a new DVD when you plateau if you stick to all low, then to all medium when you plateau at low and then to high when you plateau at medium, or mix and match!

2099578,4,B0002J58HY,"I've had this dvd for over a year now and have used it on and off.

But only recently, 5 weeks ago, did I decide to start this dvd as a program doing each of the low, medium and high intensities for two weeks each. I started high this week and wow. It's tough but I'm finally there. I definitely see more definition in my arms and legs! Instead of doing her cardio I've been doing the treadmill. Her low cardio is useless, I don't break a sweat. And the high is a little all over the place, I can't really keep up.

The high intensity workout killed me today, I was impressed since a lot of the time her exercises seem a little easier than some other dvd's I have.

Anyway, I'm going to keep with this one doing the high intensity and maybe doing the medium and high together. I also have her Get Fit Fast and Shrink Your Female Fat Zones. I love them all, they're wonderful!

UPDATE: This dvd definitely takes an exercise from beginner to moderate. However, now that I've been exercising regularly this DVD is a little too easy. The low and medium for the arms and legs are way too easy unless I do all of them together. Even when I do all three of the arm routines in a row my arms are barely sore the next day. The high intensity for the legs is still tough for me but in total the dvd isn't enough of a challenge. Now I'm looking for something to take me to that next level. I do love the stretch on here though and even if I don't use the exercise routines I always go to the stretch.

I don't like Denise Austin - I find her way to cheerful and I don't think she looks or sounds anything like someone enjoying her workout. I even think she looks a little insane. There's something about her eyes. No, she's just not for me.

I took about 2 years off of exersise to battle cancer and when I was healthy again I wanted to lose the steriod wait I gained. Who'd I turn to? Denise!

I know some people don't like the way she talks, but I like that. If she were dead silent it would be boring. This DVD is great because 5 months ago I started off at the lowest level. And I struggled. Now, I'm doing the higher level of cardio and I'm still only on the middle difficulty of the arms and legs!

I feel like I'm not only getting a workout, but I'm just might get a little rhythm too.

I started out slow and LOVE the custom workout option on this DVD.  What a great use of technology!  I mostly do the high intensity upper body, medium intensity lower body, abs and stretch routines on a daily basis.  For cardio, I've added walking, as I don't care for the cardio routines on this DVD.  I've lost 25 pounds over the course of 3 months and I haven't felt this good in years!

UPDATE (October 26, 2007): I've added running to my routine and I've made it up to running one mile straight!  But for strength training, I STILL go back to this DVD.  Love the high intensity upper and lower body workouts.  Eating right and moving has really paid off!

2099601,4,B0002J58HY,"This is really a great video.  None of the exercises will be new to most users, but the setup of the dvd makes up for that!  You are able to pick and choose from cardio, strength training (arm, core, and lower body), and stretching, select the intensity, and then combine your selections into a personalized workout.  This allows for a great deal of variety and is wonderful for ensuring that you do no overwork certain muscle groups.  Arms a little sore today?  Select low intensity arms and choose a more advanced level for your abs or legs.

The cardio section is a favorite of mine for days where I don't have time for the gym.  Even the lowest level of the the cardio will get your heart rate up-- combine two of the cardio sessions and you will definitely be sweating! The routines are actually enjoyable- -Denise doesn't chat too much and the incorporation of dance steps keeps things interesting.

While I don't know if this dvd alone would lead to a great body, it is definitely a good place to start for those who are just beginning physical activity and it is equally helpful for those trying to maintain a current level of activity on a tight schedule, when a full hour or two at the gym is not possible every day.

2099602,5,B0002J58HY,"I am a big fan of Denise Austin's exercise DVDs since they helped me lose some weight earlier this year. This DVD is one of my favorites that Denise has made.

I like that you can create a custom workout in this DVD, putting together specific workouts that you want to do and having them play back to back. I also like how there are different levels for all of the exercises (with the exception of the abs workout).

This DVD includes: (1) High and Low impact cardio; (2) High, medium, and low difficulty leg exercises; (3) High, medium, and low difficulty arm exercises; (4) ab exercises; and (5) a stretching segment. The cardio segments are 20 minutes each. The rest of the segments are 10 minutes a piece. The cardio and arm exercises require a set of hand weights. The latter requiring two sets of different weight.

I am not overly fond of the cardio on this DVD, as the high impact isn't quite as intense as the cardio is some of her other DVDs, such as Boot Camp Total Body Blast. This DVD is great for its strength exercises. I very much enjoy the leg and ab segments. The ab segment is quite a challenge, which surprised me as I had been doing Pilates to strengthen my core muscles previous to purchasing this DVD. The stretching segment is relaxing and one of the more effective stretching workouts I have used - it really prevents soreness.

Overall, I recommend this DVD for its flexibility and wonderful strength training segments.",1184889600,2,1445,4.546153846153846
2099603,2,B0002J58HY,"I bought this based on all the great reviews and was very disappointed.  I have a couple of other Denise Austin videos, but this is my first with aerobics.  She should stick with Pilates.  The movements did not have a natural flow at all and I got the feeling while I was trying to follow along that she forgot the script and was thinking up moves along the way.  I would call the aerobics beginner, except for the difficulty in trying to figure out what Denise is doing.

The toning is better, but still beginner, not intermediate, even at the most advanced level.

The ab workout was quite good and was a decent challenge, but her rhythm is off.  I also really liked her stretch at the end.

2099609,5,B0002J58HY,"I am very pleased with the Personal Training System. Ten minute workouts for upper body - light, medium, and heavy; lower body - light, medium, and heavy; cardio light and heavy plus abs and stretching.

I started with abs, and light upper and lower body. After a week I progressed to abs and medium upper and lower. The advantage with these workouts is you get a total body workout in a minimum of time and you don't have to worry about over doing it. Results aren't immediate but progressive and quite noticable after the first two weeks. The T stands which were very difficult for me the first week are getting much easier.

I don't due the cardio for lack of space. I don't fine Denise's personality annoying at all and I find her suggestions quite useful.",1176163200,5,760,4.54014598540146
2099610,4,B0002J58HY,"I just started getting serious about fitness, so I bought this DVD. It's worth the money!! First, you get a lot of fitness options, second a lot of vartiety and her bubbly personality can be really encouraging when you're having an off day.

The dvd's got a lot of segments. I found her cardio cueing to be less than stellar, but once you do it a couple of times, it's no big deal. The high intensity cardio is great. I haven't done the high intensity arms or legs segments yet, but I'm taking the assumption that they are good.

I can't say anything bad about this because once you get the basics, it's a great workout.  I've been alternating low and high intensity cardio with her Core Complete workout and am slowly seeing results.

4 stars because nothing is totally perfect.",1176163200,5,779,4.50354609929078

You can choose any combination of cardio or strength training that you want, and you can also choose between high, medium, and low intensity for most workouts.  Each of the cardio workouts are relatively short, only 20 or 30 minutues, I think.  At first I believed that this wouldn't be enough time to really sweat, get my heart pumping, and work my muscles.  I was wrong.  I'm 22 and in decent shape, and for the first few weeks, my thighs, butt and back were sore after each cardio workout.  I started to see improvement in the mucle tone of my thighs and calves after about a month.  I love the abs and upper body (high intensity) workouts.  They are just long enough for you to really feel the burn without being too long that your day will be significantly interrupted by the workout.  After about 5 weeks, my abs, arms, and back look better.  I'm much stronger all over.  I do the workouts 3 to 4 times a week.",1175731200,5,1035,4.256410256410256

As soon as I turned it on and heard Denise talking, I could understand what everyone meant.  She may be sweet but I found her voice and what she was saying completely unmotivating.  Even worse was the fact that I was bored stiff.  I felt like when I worked out at Living Well Lady back in the late 80's.  I couldn't even finish the segment.  I had to turn it off midway.

You'd need to work up if you're new to weights.  Denise is in great shape and isn't all ""fake"" like some of those video queens.  I especialy like that you can turn off the voice and just listen to the music.

I played the first 5 minutes of the low intensity workout and I was pumped up!  It was a little difficult but I felt so revived!  My husband (yes I married young) wants to do it with me!  And the options on how you want to customize is so neat!  I'm so excited!

********I've been reading on here a lot and noticing that there are a lot of people who dislike hearing Denise talk and motivate you through the whole thing.  I'm not one of those people but IF YOU ARE...before each workout you can choose whether you'd like to hear Denise & music, or just the music itself through out the workout.  And the music is very upbeat and motivating.  So, if Denise gets on your nerves...turn her off and just listen to the upbeat music!

The cardio is by no means hard core, but it gets my heart pumping. I love that I can adjust my levels for the other sections. I have very little upper body strength and this DVD lets me work on my upper body at a lower intensity, without compromising my intensity on the cardio and lower body.

She gives alternate moves within the workouts and that coupled with the ability to pick the intensity is just great.  I love that the workouts are short and when combined together you get to focus on the areas where you need the most work.

2099641,5,B0002J58HY,"I love this dvd.  It's very easy to use and you can pre-program what workout you want to do, depending on your time constraints, your own physical needs and level.

1.  20 minute cardio workout. I'm doing the low intensity (a high intensity is also available) cardio and I find it very enjoyable to do.  I love all the workouts in this segment - those which include the grapevine, shuffle, lunges, rainbow, and almost all the movements.  Even my 3-year old daughter loves them, so she imitates me while watching me workout.  I went through the high intensity and for me, the low intensity is a lot more fun.

2. 10 minute upper body.  I'm also doing the low intensity (but dvd has medium & high too) but instead of the chair, I use the stability ball when I'm doing the weights.  I find it's more flexible to do it with a ball than on a chair.

3. 10 minute lower body.  I don't consider my lower body a main problem spot, so for now, I skip this section due to time constraints.  That's why this dvd is so good, you can choose what you want, depending on your needs!  This is also available in low, medium and high intensity.  I went through the section, though, and find variety of lower body exercises which I haven't seen some yet.  I have to try this when I have the luxury of time. ;-)

4. 10 minute abs.  This is my problem spot so I always make it a point to do this all the time.  This is tough and you would really feel it working in all sections of your abs.  There are a lot of variation in the basic crunches which I find very useful.  I hope it works visibly, though!  I have a lot of flab hiding my 6-pack.  LOL!

5.  The last segment is the stretching which is basically the usual stretching we see, but of course, very important in the cool down.

All in all, I give this dvd a 5+ stars for being easy to use and the workouts being doable but effective.  I guess I'm fast becomming a Denise fan.  I enjoy her workouts and for me her talkies are not distracting.  But if you get annoyed with her voice, there's also a function to play music only.

You can choose an all Low level, Moderate level or high intensity workout (which includes abs and full body stretch) or you can truly customize your workout.  The DVD lets you preset what level you want for every specific workout before you even start so that there aren't any interruptions between the chapters. I almost hate to admit it but... I choose the Low intensity workout starting out.  I was sweating more than what I thought I would.  I even still found some of the Abs and thigh exercises challenging!!

If you get this workout, try all three levels.  Some levels I liked more than others and my liking of them didn't go by low, medium, and high.  For instance, I dislike the medium level lower body using a chair but I love the high level with no equipment needed.

I can do most or the majority of these exercises which I like, and the only equipment needed is a chair and weights which are only used in certain workouts.

My least favorite component is the cardio section.  I don't really feel like you get to do enough so that's why I rate this DVD 4/5 stars.  However, if you're on a budget crunch and/or are looking for a DVD that includes everything - cardio, toning, and stitching - then I highly recommend this DVD.  Plus, you'll get Denise's bubbly personality to go along with your workout, and I enjoy her moreso than any other fitness expert out there.",1144886400,19,1347,4.512396694214876

Denise Austin is perky (immensely), but sometimes when I'm tired her contagious smile is helpful. The ab workout is great, and I love the lower and upper body sections, also. However, I rated this DVD 4 stars, because of her Cardio workout segments. Even the high intensity workout is too repetitive and without difficulity! If you're looking to get flat abs, a tight butt, lean thighs, and sculpted arms, this DVD is for you; but if it's cardio you're looking for, I'd recommend another DVD.",1143504000,11,631,4.693693693693693

Total body workout. Starting to see results by losing inches although the scale has not moved much yet. Would highly recommend. Denise is a little too ""perky"" at times, but you can put it on a music only and not have to listen to her, although when you are feeling tired her perkiness can help.

I found the cardio extremely boring, and the medium intensity upper body workout completely lacking in the ""Workout"" department.  I have only been exercising since the beginning of the year (less than two months) and the medium intensity upper body didn't leave my muscles feeling anything at all.  I have been doing a variety of other vidoes that I do enjoy.  I also feel that her moves and techniques are stuck in the 80's.  Not that they necessarily are less effective, but they bore me to tears.  Maybe her style is for older people who are new to excersing. (I am 30)  I do not recommend this at all.

Like most people, I am very busy and there are days here and there that I can't get to the gym. That's when I love to pop in Denise's DVD to get a workout in. Sometimes I just do aerobics; other times I do the strength and stretching only. Whatever you choose is available on the tape.

Love the fact that there are different levels of workout as well. So, this would be a great DVD workout for beginners, too. Another great feature is that when you pop in the DVD, you can have ""music only"" to workout by; or have music AND Denise guiding you (just like you are at an aerobics class in person).

Denise makes it fun and she is energetic and supportive.

You can mix and match to create your own ideal workout. I really enjoy the ability to focus more attention on the areas I feel I need to do the most work on. Another good thing about this is that the workouts aren't all that unpleasant, so most people probably won't give up, like they may with a lot of workout dvds.

I use this dvd along with my 5-star suggestion, Denise's Indoor Walk dvd. With these, I have a good variety, and my workout provides just what I need at exactly the difficulty level I'm ready for. Recommended, along with Indoor Walk.",1138320000,3,717,4.558139534883721

Not being the most coordinated person in the world, most dancing tapes are out AND since I have a high energy job I can't do anything that will make me so sore I can't work for a few days.  Denise does a great job in this video and its nice to have different levels to work with.  It gets your heart pumping and body moving with easy to follow routines.  Its great for someone who already does a lot of work during the day and just wants something else to help keep them in shape.  I will say however there's a HUGE difference between the low and high intensity cardio workout and she spends less time teaching moves in the high intensity workout.  Otherwise, its a great way to get yourself moving and starting to tone up :)",1136937600,2,834,4.246835443037975

Anyway, this DVD sounded interesting and seemed to offer a lot of options so I gave it a try. Without her voice the cardio, lower body and abs were ok.  Not awesome but ok.  Problem being is that without the voice you don't get any ques. I found that the sections with arm weights are very poor in terms of form.  BE CAREFUL WITH THIS ONE.  She combines moves that have your joints rotating in unsafe ways and the pace it too fast to do it in good form and actually build any muscle.  This is aerobic weight training! I am not in bad shape and do work with light to med (3-5 lbs) hand weights at least 3x week.  High intensity is one thing but that doesn't mean do it faster when it comes to working with weights.

  You do not need ANY equipment - not even shoes!  I did this workout on the first time in my PJ's - without  even a brassiere!

The exercises are the same as I did when I was in the Army - basic stuff that even the most uncoordinated - like me - can easily do.

I started using them again,but wanted something more recent. This fits the bill for people like me,and for beginners,as well as those who are more advanced. It can be totally customized to each user's level,for example-LOW on cardio,but MEDIUM or HIGH for each segment on arms,abs and thighs.

My lower body is very weak, so the low routine was perfect. My legs weren't screaming like they usually do from other routines. I thought this video would be great to finally start building up my leg strength. Because other lower body videos tend to work your legs harder, I'd be in so much pain, I wouldn't want to do the video ever again. This is one that I will continue to use.

2099671,4,B0002J58HY,"Being in New Zealand, I went on an internet shopping spree recently, purchasing a whole lot of DVDs not available in New Zealand while the exchange rate NZ/USD was competitive.  On the whole, I probably was taking a rather large gamble with my exercise DVD purchases since I have very little idea as to who many of the personalities are and what sort of credibility they have.

Out of the DVDs that I have ordered, Denise Austin's Personal Training System is one of my most valued purchases.  It takes into consideration everyone's personal fitness ability, and as always, Denise shows her understanding that there are only so many minutes in a day.  This is a DVD that I can develop with, and I can customise my workouts to match my mood, time, and progress.

I find it very difficult to get myself motivated to exercise, and any form of exercise that encourages me to stick at it and is convenient is valuable.  It is only with Denise Austin's workouts  that I have the enthusiasm to make exercise a habit.

On this DVD, you get:

2 x 20min Cardio - Low and High Intensity

3 x 10min Upper Body Toning - Low, Moderate and High Intensity

3 x 10min Lower Body Toning - Low, Moderate and High Intensity

1 x 10min Abdominal Routine (3 levels, but one rountine)

1 x 10min Stretch

I have one of Denise Austin's other toning DVDs, 'Shrink your Female Fat Zones', and there is an overlap with some of the exercises in that DVD with the toning segments on this DVD, although because on SYFFZ she moves from zone to zone, while on here she spends a targeted amount of time on one zone, you 'feel the burn' a lot more, even if the exercises are similar.

My only gripes are related to the Cardio routines.  The high intensity cardio routine is not as difficult as I thought it would be.  The choreography for both routines isn't very exciting, and the music isn't totally synchronised to the movements, I have been known to 'switch off' and work out to the music rather than to Denise - though for a DVD less than $15 and purchased on a whim, I didn't expect rocket science.  And as I said before, I have respect for any exercise that I can stick with, and despite these flaws with the cardio routines, I still do them regularly and feel good about myself after I've done them.

The set is gorgeous, and Denise is her usual, perky self - and if by now you are fed up of her catch phrases and her 'unorthodox' referrels to buttocks and abdominals (Tight tushies! Flat tummies! No more jigglies! Am I the only one that finds this sort of chatter cute?), don't expect a personality metamorphosis in this DVD.

All in all, I think this DVD is great bang for your buck and would recommend it to anyone as a good base for their exercise collection.",1119657600,12,2737,4.425149700598802
2099672,5,B0002J58HY,"I am a fit person who has been running and doing yoga for a few years but wanted to mix things up by trying aerobics for the first time.
I really enjoy this dvd because it gives you several options (2 cardio workouts, 3 upper body, 3 lower body, abs, & stretch). You can choose a pre-programmed workout or customize one yourself.
This was important to me because as a runner I have very strong legs so I immediately jumped to the high intensity lower body. However, my upper body is not developed so I started out on the low intensity and have now worked my way up to the moderate intensity version.
The cardio/aerobic routines are fun - she has a positive and enthusiastic attitude which keeps you going. She mixes up different styles (traditional sport, yoga, pilates, etc) to keep it interesting. I prefer the low intensity cardio, just because I think it's more fun.
One of the most important factors for getting into shape is variety & surprise: you have to keep your muscles guessing in order to make them work, and you have to vary intensity to burn fat most efficiently. This dvd gives you the chance to do these things.

2099676,5,B0002J58HY,"Denise Austin is in my opinion, one of the most inspirational women. This tape is a great addition to any home-exercise-video collection.

It is divided into separate segments - Cardio, Upper body, Lower body, Abs and the Stretch. Because of DVD technology, you can customize and create your own personalized workout based on how much time you have, how much energy you have, or just if your conscience will be guilty if you don't do any exercise.

If you are in a hurry, but you want to get some workout in, this DVD is great - you can do just one of the segments (usually about 10-15 minutes) and actually feel like you've just worked out for hours.

Denise knows exactly how to target tone your body, by finding the precise exercises that target the specific zone of your body. Her exercises are well defined, easy to follow and well explained.

I recommend this DVD for ANYONE who wants to get FIT FAST!

Denise is a lot better than her opponents, in the sense that she knows how to encourage her fellow exercisers!",1117756800,7,1019,4.546448087431694
2099677,5,B0002J58HY,"I have been doing Denise Austin's Shrink Your Female Fat Zones for 6 weeks, and 2 weeks ago added this DVD to put some variety in the routine.  I love it!

What I love most about it is the technology in the DVD, which allows you to customize your routine, choosing from a menu (in most sections with subcategories covering your level of expertise) of arms, legs, abs, stretching & cardio.  If you pick one from each category, you'll get an hour long work-out, but you can go as low as 10 or 20 minutes.

Denise is her usual chatty self in these routines, offering you encouragement and explaining what muscles you're working--occasionally piping in late with an essential bit of instruction (like how you're supposed to be breathing during a particular exercise) and on one exercise forgetting a step (which she does perform on the other leg).  As with my other Austin tape, I like her and her presentation enough to make allowances for this, but you do need to remember these belatedly mentioned techniques so that you can begin to anticipate them on later use of the DVD.  When you're familiar enough with the routine, if you like, you have the option of shutting off Denise's voice and working out to the music alone.  Since I can't watch the screen during many of these exercises, I'm not sure that's a route I'll ever go.

The cardio routine seems a little complicated to me.  It feels like a slightly frantic line dance, but it does get the pulse going, which is the point.  The stretches, arms, legs & ab exercises are nothing too unusual, but as with the other tape I have, Austin presents a good variety to cover all the major muscle groups involved.  I find some of the workout here more difficult than on Austin's Shrink Your Female Fat Zones, which moves around from area to area, even though I suspect you're hitting the same muscles with the same intensity.  When you group the exercises together as they are here, you really feel it.  By the end of the 10-minute arm workout, my muscles are really straining.

Equipment required: 3 to 8 lb. handweights, a towel & a dining room table type chair (I'm using my stability ball).",1117497600,66,2140,4.582677165354331
2099678,3,B0002J58HY,"I was, until recently, fortunate enough to work for an employer with a fully-staffed on-site fitness center, including some terrific aerobics instructors.  I bought this DVD to maintain my workout routine after I got laid off, having no idea who Denise Austin was.  I am about as unfit as anyone who works out regularly can be, so unlike some other reviewers I found the workouts appropriately challenging, and I like that you can create a customized workout that includes both aerobics and strength training segments.  What I don't like is the fact that the music is not properly synchronized to the action--I'm a musician, and this drives me CRAZY!  Also, the aerobics combos don't always follow the 16- or 32- count convention I'm used to, and the choreography is rather unimaginative.  What I end up doing is using Denise's moves as a guide and making up my own routine, following the music more than Denise and her girls.  The poor synchronization of the music to the action is less annoying on the strength training segments than in the aerobics segments, but is a major oversight and not what I would have expected in a mass-market, professionally produced video.",1117065600,4,1170,4.883838383838384

The workout was not that hard at all (I was on Low Impact) But I worked up A LOT of sweat. The most I've ever sweated, without even finishing the complete workout. My whole body was sore (not painful sore) that made me feel good. Now, about Denise's chattiness, I find it hard to recognize because she's just instructing you and motivating you during the workout.

2099682,3,B0002J58HY,"(I rented this DVD - deciding whether I should buy it or not)

This DVD really uses the format of the media to its advantage.  You can customize to do cardio of 2 intensities, and then strength training from 3 intensities, upper body, lower body, and abs all separately, and also you can opt for a stretch. I chose to do a low intensity cardio, and mid intensities of lower body, upper body, and abs. I also did the stretch.

To be honest, I have never seen Denise Austin live before. I have a book of hers that I haven't used much, but I heard good things about this dvd...

I found the cardio way too dancy for me, and I wanted to throttle her during it... she was SUPER annoying. It reaffirms why I really love Walk Away the Pounds. While Leslie Sansone is also a bit annoying, at least I don't find myself flailing to try to keep up with her! I did not feel like it was a good cardio workout. It only lasted about 18 minutes... barely enough to feel like you have started. I was very glad that there was more to the workout, though I was almost ready to pop the darn dvd out and throw it in the mailbox immediately because of her stupid dance routine.

BUT - the strength training was GREAT! I felt that the abs workout was the best, and I was impressed by some of the more advanced moves she was able to do (could I ever do that?). There were some upper and lower body moves I hadn't seen before, and they felt really good! The stretch was also very effective. I might be willing to get this dvd for myself just for the strength training bits! There are a lot of options for the strength training (as I mentioned before, the 3 intensities for each) so I think it would stay fresh.  Each section is 10 minutes long.

So - I would not use this for aerobics unless you like Jane Fonda-esque aerobics.  But - try it for the Strength Training!",1111363200,17,1843,4.186440677966102
2099683,5,B0002J58HY,"There is just so much on this DVD:

Two cardio workouts:  one low intensity, one high intensity.

Three workouts each for the lower body and upper body.  You can pick from low, medium or high intensity.

One ab workout.  Denise incorporates three different levels for many of the ab exercises, so you can stay at one level or step up the intensity as the workout goes along.

There's also a separate ""chapter"" for cool-down and stretch.

You can customize your workout in many ways.  You can choose to have music only or music with Denise talking.  You can simply choose ""low"", ""medium"" or ""high"" and it will put you through the cardio and appropriate toning segments or you can go to custom workout and put together your own.  Since you pick everything out on the custom workout all at one time, once it's playing, it's seamless...no flipping back and forth to the menu at all.

Because you have so much variety to choose from, I think this is a DVD you can really grow with.

Denise is Denise.  If you've never enjoyed working out with her, don't buy this.  But for those of us who enjoy her ""company,"" I unhesitatingly give this a strong recommendation.",1110240000,16,1156,4.570731707317073

Although I'm not sure if this is the best workout for those who are more advanced.",1109548800,5,458,4.218390804597701
2099686,5,B0002J58HY,"I think this is Denise Austin's best workout.  It gives alot of variety, and the toning for upper and lower body, plus abs, is very effective.  The set up is great, too, because you can create your own workouts based on your schedule and needs.",1109548800,4,244,4.4
2099687,4,B0002J58HY,"Although advanced exercisers may not be all that impressed with this DVD, there is no reason that beginning or intermediate exercisers should not get a good workout with Denise, regarding both cardio and toning portions.  I think she could have done a little more with the stretches, but it fulfilled the requirement.  She does not cue as stated in other reviews, but after doing the DVD a couple times, its easy to follow.  There are two reasons I didn't give this DVD five stars.  First she did promise to give everyone a good workout, from the beginner to the ""top athlete"", which I don't think is the case here.  But since most of us are not top athletes, it shouldn't make a difference.  Also, there is a recipe booklet inside, but none of the recipes have any nutritional information.  Not a huge deal, but since she also states in the booklet (and among her other books) the number of fat grams and calories people should consume a day, she might have included that information.  But I think this is a good workout in general.",1109116800,,1033,4.576086956521739
2099688,1,B0002J58HY,"First thing I thought when I got this DVD was who is this lady and how and why did she get so popular??  I can see how this workout may be good for someone who has never worked out a day in their life, but for someone who works out regularly, this DVD is not for you!  First of all, the cardio section was horrible!  Denise just kind of jumps here and there and throws her arms about.  She doesn't really give any instruction or cues and even the ladies behind her had no idea what she was doing as they were frequently getting lost trying to follow her as well.  For me, Denise is just strange.  She opens her eyes really wide when she talks and is kind of like ""weeeee"", I guess to try to motivate you, but it is not motivating at all.  I would say that the only ""ok"" portion is the ab workout.  Overall, I would not recommend this DVD or any Denise Austin workout DVDs.  If you are looking for a good workout with good instruction then I would try any of Tami Lee Webb's exercise DVDs.",1108598400,9,988,4.077720207253886
2099689,4,B0002J58HY,"I own alot of Denise's Video's and I have to say this one is a really neat way to work out. With other Video's you can get borned pretty fast, with Denise's Personal Training System you have choices so you don't get borned. The any thing that could be longer is the toning and ads, but you still get a work out.",1108425600,2,311,4.032258064516129
2099690,4,B0002J58HY,"I have only begun to exercise in the last year, and this was the first time that I have ever done aerobics.

Denise's video impacted my body in a way that aerobic walking and jogging have failed to do.  Even at the ""low intensity"" level I have seen noticable changes in my arms and abs.  I sweat a lot! Another reviewer who said she didn't sweat at all must be in great shape.

However, you need a lot of space in your apartment to do Denise's workout. I have to rearrange the furniture because her routines all have a tendency to move very far to the left and right.  Also, it is true that it's very hard to keep up with her as she changes the routine.  She doesn't do a good job of telling you when she's going to change, and sometimes she's not even following the rythym of the music.  Even the toning portions of the video move around too fast for me to reposition.  I have done this workout probably ten times and I still get lost.

But all in all, I like the video and I will continue to do it. I like being able to have so many exercise options in one video, and the results I've seen in my body encourage me to keep it up.",1108252800,5,1130,4.054054054054054
2099691,4,B0002J58HY,"Good investment.  Total ability to customize is a great advantage.  Work part of your body or all of your body on any given day.  I do wish the aerobics segments were about 10 minutes longer but if you want a good aerobic workout try Denise's ""Ultimate Fat Blaster"" work-outs.",1107907200,2,276,4.591836734693878
2099692,5,B0002J58HY,"I seldomly write reviews although I appreciate them.  However, I felt compelled to praise this DVD because it helped me continue to exercise and keep up my moral even with a fractured wrist.  I've always exercised:  aerobics, running, walking, Curves, etc.; however, this recent injury really cramped my style.  (Live on the East coast and with all the snow it was difficult to go out walking). With this DVD and its variety of workout options-I was able to select and choose modules that worked for me right in my own livingroom.  Now, I'm even at a junction where I'm using the weights (allbeit with one hand).  I'm well on my way to recovery and believe that this DVD helped.  I really didn't look extensively at other exercise gurus so I can't really compare.  I was familiar with Denise's style from TV and mainly looked at the choices under her name.  I will continue to use this DVD when I'm completely recovered and have the use of both hands.",1107820800,,951,4.613095238095238
2099693,5,B0002J58HY,"I initially did not want to buy a Denise Austin DVD, because I found her voice annoying. (saw a 60 second preview online).  I read recommended reviews and got it anyway.  Boy, am I glad I did.  There is variety... 3 different intensity levels and seperate workouts focusing on different parts of body in addition to aerobics.  pick and choose what you want to work on a particular day.  you create your workout.  The time just flys by for me.  It's like having a coach along side you.  Very easy to follow.  Unlike the Tamilee Buns of Steel tapes. (which I don't like, from the ninety's). anyway, denise is peppy and wants you to do well.  she reminds me of a school teacher who is encouraging and she lets you know what muscles are being worked on.  I will definately buy another dvd. seems like such a nice person.  just love her.  great for beginners who will work up to intermediate.  I am starting to workout again and am active.  Perfect for your first workout tape. If you regularly workout will be too easy for you.  aerobics part is definately for newbies, but rest is effective.  I like Kathy Smith tapes, too.",1107561600,4,1120,4.465346534653466
2099694,3,B0002J58HY,"Maybe I'm just lame, and I've never done the aerobics thing before, but she changes the routine too quickly.  Just as I get into the groove with one thing, she's got another move.  It's too frantic, even the low impact version.  Other than that, I like the other workouts on the tape, especially the lower body and the stretches.

The aerobics routines she does on the daily tv show seem a little more attainable.",1107561600,2,413,4.54054054054054
2099695,5,B0002J58HY,"I bought this for my wife.  This is actually quite a nice exercise DVD.  The routines are quite good.  The main benefit however is not the routines, it is the custom feature.  On movie DVD's there is the ""set up"" feature where you can customize sound, language etc.  Here they use this feature to customize a work out, so you can select what you like to do and what intensity you would like, this allows you to vary what you do each time you use the DVD and how much of a work out you want, very nice.  The folks who put this DVD together could have taken just the VHS tapes and slap them on this DVD, but instead they came up with this ""custom exercise"" routine, which is very cool.  Definitely recommended.",1107302400,5,708,4.2388059701492535
2099696,5,B0002J58HY,"I spent 2 years gettign myself into a workout routine only to stop completly when I went on vacation. I just now two months ago decided I needed to get back into so I went and bought soemthign new to add to my workout collection.

This DVD is so easy to customize to whatever you feel liek doing it's great. I love that it has not just low impact and high impact but an in between as well. The cardios are easy to follow and take you through stretches as well. The daily stretches have pilates fluid movements which makes it easy on your back and legs as well as easy to do anytime.

and the ab workout ont his dvd is the best workout i have ever done! I love a workout i can actually feel working and this is it.

i reccomend this to anyone who wants a full body routine thats easy to follow and Denise Austin fans.",1107216000,2,816,4.055900621118012

2099698,3,B0002J58HY,"Every time try to follow Denise, she fails to prepare the viewer with what is going on next. In this program, following the exercisers is challenging with the abrupt body changes and pivots. Liked the toning segments, but again not much time to get ready to follow as the moves come fast with no warning. Did not feel got a good workout. Her eyes widen with wild energy, lots of talk, but hey can't you cue and instruct??",1105833600,3,421,4.410256410256411

I was looking for something quick to add to my walking routine for a little bit of strength training, and this is perfect.  After my walk, I choose abs, arms, or legs, and the stretching segment, and I've got a well-rounded workout in about 45 minutes (including my walk).  The cardio segments are also good for a rainy day.  Highly recommended.",1105056000,11,415,4.5675675675675675
2099700,2,B0002J58HY,"I bought this DVD based on other reviewer's comments and it's 5 star rating. This DVD may be good for beginners but if you have been working out don't bother!!! The routines are boring, monotonous, and very uninspiring. Also, the routines are not long enough to actually have any effect. I have other DVDs that are set up like this in which you can choose which routines to do and even those, in 10 or even 8 minute intervals, give me more of a workout than this. The only good thing about this DVD is that you can shut out Denise's voice and just follow with the music. Save your money.",1104883200,8,587,4.297297297297297
2099701,5,B0002J58HY,"This workout dvd is wonderful. It lets you choose what level of intensity you can do. I am starting out with the low and working my way up to high. Even at the low intensity level, you are really burning energy (or as Denise says ""burn that butter"") and toning your muscles. I can't wait to advance to the next level. Denise Austin is a good role model. I just had a baby and my main problem are my stomach muscles. Her exercises for flattening your stomach really work.",1104883200,9,470,4.292134831460674
2099702,5,B0002J58HY,This is the one video I can't live without. The combo's are fun to do and feel more like a dance than exercise. I have so much fun and so much energy after doing this workout.

Already all the other ones I have are gathering dust on the shelf as I find myself reaching out for this DVD everytime. I can customize my workout which is super convenient, i can tailor it to exactly what i need for each part of my body and vary the intensity of cardio or have no cardio at all! you can't get bored, cos its several workouts in one! plus she has an excellent abs and strech section. After just the first 2 days of the workout I found my abs and my body feeling tighter, my muscles stronger and I can't wait to work out everyday even after a long, stressful day at work.  I love her energy, I don't think she's annoying at all, ok the ""beautiful face"" thing she says is cheesy but such a small and insigficant detail compared to the great workout you get.

I was definitely sweating and her stretch seemed even better than some of my other exercise dvds. I like that you can customize and make your own work out. Especially for those who do not like to work out none of the segments are that long. The cardio ones are the longest both are 20 minutes each. Everything else is only 10 minutes. There is abs, upper body, lower body, stretch, and the low cardio and high cardio. It is worth getting if you are wanting to exercise in the privacy of your home and get you back into working out for those of you who are out of shape like me.
