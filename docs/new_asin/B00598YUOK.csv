4620805,4,B00598YUOK,"Interestingly, I felt that this story was more about the story between the friendship between the two minstrels - one who was the protector and the other who was the pretty ""flower boy"" who was constantly exploited. As common street clowns, their show is quite bawdy (think Shakespearean in nature) so this could be shocking but is probably accurate to the time period. We quickly discover that the leader of the first minstrel group ""pimps"" out Gong-gil (played by Lee Joon-Ki) to earn extra money for the troupe and his friend, Jaeng-saeng (played by Kam Woo-Sung) is sickened by this and goes to protect him (getting themselves in trouble). This sets the stage for what is to come. They escape and form another troupe, mocking King Yeonsan (Jung Jin-Young) and his court and end up playing before the King himself for their lives. We then discover that the King has his own issues but he becomes enamored with Gong-gil and is entertained by the bawdiness and mockery of the troupe. However, we are constantly reminded of the vicious nature of the King. There are no actual ""sex"" scenes - other than the bawdiness of the troupe and one ""stolen"" kiss when Gong-gil is passed out drunk - everything else is implied and is exploitation - or is with the King and his courtesan.",1400630400,5,1275,4.721973094170403
4620806,5,B00598YUOK,I was bored one night wondering what on Earth could I watch when I stumbled upon this rare jem. This movie was beautiful. I fell in love with it the first time I watched it.,1385596800,,173,3.9714285714285715
4620807,5,B00598YUOK,"Do not hesitate to purchase this movie.

The acting is superb and the story telling extra ordinary.

I have to read the subtitles and it's still worth watching.",1370563200,,160,4.678571428571429
4620808,5,B00598YUOK,"I hoped to see this in theaters, but it never came out in Italy. I think I saw an article about it on some French movie mag and put it on my ToBuy list. I wasn't disappointed. If it's historical or not, I have no idea, I just loved the idea of the king falling in love with the young actor who plays women's parts (I guess Korea was a lot like England back then).",1358553600,,363,3.8533333333333335
4620809,3,B00598YUOK,"This movie looks gorgeous, with very interesting sets and absolutely stunning, fantastic costumes. Most of the acting is okay, particularly by Woo-seong Kam as the chief clown and Jin-yeong Jeong as the king; but Jun-ki Lee as the girl-like clown of the title is embarrassingly bad - a real ham who can simper and pose and wail and shed real-looking tears, but that's about all. What the king sees in him is beyond my imagining, but then the king is insane, so....

The story is so ridiculously overwrought and melodramatic, though, that hammy acting almost fits better than good acting. This movie is fantastic to look at as long as you're able to ignore the two-hour soap opera that makes Dynasty seem like Shakespeare.",1350086400,,721,4.814516129032258
4620810,5,B00598YUOK,"Takes place during the centuries long Joseon Dynasty period of King Yeonsan-gun who was disposed in 1506 by court noble officials. Supposedly the arranged death of his mother when he was young left him with some psychological issues reminiscent of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"". Anyway, the story revolves around his tyrannical despotic behavior and even more so while being entertained by a minstrel group. That group includes an unusual, especially for Korea, sympathetic portrayal of a eunuch who, as the story unfolds, is able to sympathize with the psychological turmoil that the King's experienced through the death of his mother. The blending and range of human personalities displaying greed, selflessness, love, anger, deception was quite well done.

A well written creative and controversial storyline; well acted and directed with exceptional costuming, props and setting.",1336348800,6,879,5.609022556390977
4620811,4,B00598YUOK,"This is a good movie.  It has a peculiar ending like a lot of Korean movies have, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  I will not give away the ending.  Good choice of actors for this movie, also.  Glad I purchased it.",1323216000,6,212,4.097560975609756

8462919,5,B00598YUOK,"Truly interesting Korean historical movie.  I am told that Korean histories have different structures than ""typical"" ""Western"" movies.  This one moves from comedy to drama to tragedy.  Wonderful costumes.  Great actors.  The comedy parts were hilarious.",1476230400,3,253,5.916666666666667
8462920,3,B00598YUOK,I watched this movie on YouTube when it came out. Most people do not know that this movie is based on a book about lee jun ki's character who was able to control King's mind even his class was not even closed a royal. He was a clown in actual history but he wasn't as weak as it shows in the movie. He was a humble and kind person before received the power. He became a cold hearted man when he started to get involve with politics and killing off his own friends and governors. King was his puppet. He later on got executed for high treason by governors decision of his behavior to his royal Highness. Author got upset the way gong kil was described in the movie and the director made the movie based on his book without his permission. Last thing i heard was that they weren't able to sell DVD version of this movie because author disapproved the movie. I like the book better as that's always going to be the case.,1470614400,3,917,4.215909090909091

8462923,5,B00598YUOK,This is one of the very best Korean films that I have ever seen.  Korea consistently produces brilliant and beautiful films and TV series with great actors and actresses.  This movie has to be experienced to be appreciated and words can not begin to describe it.,1452384000,,262,4.673913043478261
