(which is sad to have to have something dirty for it to be funnier)LOVED HIM!",1350172800,,244,4.212765957446808

3762607,5,B001Q1HL18,"As usual, another funny DVD by Tim Hawkins.  He never disappoints.  Shipment was quick and in received in great condition...",1302048000,,124,5.15
3762608,3,B001Q1HL18,"This video originally was produced as a segment for a TV show about comedians.  It's funny in places, but the format of the TV show does break the comedic flow somewhat.  Also, this video is a TV length program and not full performance videos, which are available under separate titles.  The comedy is funny, but the three stars are for length and format.",1275696000,5,355,4.603174603174603

3762611,5,B001Q1HL18,"Tim Hawkins is in my opinion the funniest comedian out there.  Our family has all his Dvd's and will continue to get any new ones he makes.  Tim's re-make of songs are hilarious, and he plays the guitar quite well.  Tim is a Christian comedian, so you get the joy of laughing about ""clean"" things.  Don't miss out!",1251072000,,314,4.362068965517241
3762612,5,B001Q1HL18,"This is good clean comedy, it shows you don't have to be dirty to be funny.",1241049600,4,75,3.75
3762613,5,B001Q1HL18,This is his second time on Bananas. He has another DVD. Tim Hawkins: I'm No Rock star. It seems that he has taken parts from I'm no Rock star plus added some other jokes if you will. I may have been to judgemental about his first Bananas DVD. I have enjoyed all of his DVDs that has been produced. His Approach to Christian Humor is enjoyable and fun without the bad language.,1238457600,6,376,4.236111111111111

8334913,5,B001Q1HL18,"Comic relief from the current overly PC and vulgar genre of stand-up comedy. A very good, very clean comic. I have seen friends and guests watching video start saying ""how can it be funny, if it's clean?"" --- and shortly into the DVD they're rollin' on the floor with laughter ... !!",1434672000,4,283,4.461538461538462
