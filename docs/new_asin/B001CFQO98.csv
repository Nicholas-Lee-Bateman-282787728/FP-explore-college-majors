8287574,5,B001CFQO98,"I liked that they studied the Gorillas closely and found that they do many things just like humans.  The study of particular families of Gorillas led by the big Silverback was exciting. But, very heartbreating when the government allowed poaching again bringing the numbers of Gorillas to the brink of extinction. So many orphans, that cannot live without their mothers, as the mothers care completely for the babies for about four-five years. Mothers were shot while holding their babies, traumatizing them. It showed man in the worse and best of light. There were people finding the wounded and orphand babies bringing to shelters to be cared for 24 hours a day.  Dedicated people who give their lives to protect the Gorillas.
I have a great love and respect for all wild life but, mostly the Gorilas.  They are very intelligent animals and are being slaughtered for trophies. I'm glad I purchased the DVD and the book.  I will continue to advocate surival of this great, majestic creature.

This is a must see video for the lover of the animals of Africa.

8287575,5,B001CFQO98,"This documentary covers the life of the most studied Mountain Gorilla in history, Titus. Titus's life has not however always been one of standard Gorilla behaviour. From his unexpected birth, through his survival of the death of his father, then his non violent takeover of his family group and the subsequent years as it grew to be the largest known Group in the Virungas. The documentary team arrive just in time for Titus loss of control of his group, again in a non normal manner.

The doco features some great footage of Titus right through his life. This is backed with a clear factual voiceover and commentary from various researchers who have studied Titus and his groups over the years.
