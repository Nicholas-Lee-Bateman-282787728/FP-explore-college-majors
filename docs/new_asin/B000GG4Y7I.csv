When people came over and I had it playing on tv, they were like ""That was a DVD?"" when it went back to the tittle screen at the end. It really feels like you are watching regular cable tv. It's actually better because there are no commercials and some of these things no longer appear on tv. Great gift and I would definitely recommend it.",1332288000,,418,3.9761904761904763

It gives him a great variety of characters to get to know, and keeps him quiet, occupied and happy for quite some time. Especially while on family road trips. The price was great, considering you're getting 3 dvd's!",1314230400,,291,4.3090909090909095

Its very hard to find these cartoons on Nick anymore (Danny Phantom, Cat Scratch, The Teenage Robot)as well as their staple toons (Spongebob, Rugrats, All Grown up, Jimmy Neutron, Fairly Oddparents).  All great cartoons and my son loves watching them.  I recommend for anyone who wants a nice sampling of some of the best cartoons Nick put out.",1298073600,,428,4.72972972972973
