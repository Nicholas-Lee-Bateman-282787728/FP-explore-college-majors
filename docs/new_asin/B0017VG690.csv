It's odd, a lot of shows I liked as a kid I didn't like later in life for one reason or another, but not Family Ties. It's the perfect show to watch when I want to be transported back to the 80's, if only for a brief time. My thoughts on the show have changed a bit, like when I was young I liked Michael J. Fox's portrayal of Alex the most... which makes sense because most kids did... he was kind of the star of the show. But now, I find Steven to be more interesting. He's definitely funnier to me now that I'm older.",1222128000,3,595,3.845528455284553

However, I have noticed a pattern developing with Paramount television series being released on DVD.  It seems they produce 60% of a particular T.V. season in a decent amount of time, next they release a boxset of all previously released DVDs together... then production stops altogether.

For example the first three seasons of ""Taxi"" came to us fairly quickly then a boxset of all three seasons together graced the department store shelves only to have Paramount cut us off completely after that.  The last two seasons are still not out and any sort of release date or even a mention of production of such seasons is nonexistent.

Has anyone else noticed this?  Does this boxset signify the extinction of Family Ties on DVD?  Feel free to comment, rant, and rave...",1217980800,6,887,4.796052631578948

Season 4 of Family Ties was the Year of Alex and Ellen, and if you were a child of the '80s like me, you still know all the words to ""At This Moment"" by Billy Vera and the Beaters because you heard it on Family Ties in the 2-parter where Alex and Ellen met and fell in love. (The song has just GOT to be in the episodes! It's a vital part of the story!) Season 4 was also the year Mallory brought Nick home to meet her family for the first time, and the reactions of the Keatons to Nick were comedy gold. And all of the Keatons, plus Skippy, being kept awake by Alex's insomnia (and a faulty burglar alarm), with Elyse finally providing a cure for her firstborn's sleeplessness (one of my favorite ever scenes between Meredith Baxter and Michael J. Fox), is one of the best episodes of all time. This season is a must-have for every true Family Ties fan's collection!",1211760000,14,914,4.258620689655173

3175614,2,B0017VG690,"Love the show, that's why I ordered the DVDs, however, from season three on there are episodes missing, episodes that are from other seasons, and it upsets the viewing pleasure.  Andy will be of preschool age in one episode, the very next show he's only one year old, then the next he'll be in preschool again.  Mallory is dating Nick, then an episode will show up from two seasons prior when she broke up with Rick and Alex is fixing her up, then there will be another old episode, and then it resumes with her being with Nick again in the correct season.  Jennifer is in high school is season 5 but there are two episodes of her 13th birthday party mixed in and it's painfully obvious she's younger in those than the rest.  Ellen was gone in last season, but she's here in season 5!  It's rude for the production company to not give a you-know-what about continuity when we're paying for these shows.  So, the two stars are for the lousy arrangement, the episodes being mixed up and in the wrong seasons, not just within one but within several seasons, and the interference in viewing pleasure, not the show itself or the DVD quality which are both great.",1396569600,,1157,4.485714285714286

3175626,4,B0017VG690,"FAMILY TIES was an American sitcom that aired for 7 years on NBC from 1982-89 regarding a Midwestern family in suburban Columbus, Ohio reflecting the move in America from the cultural liberism of the 1960's and 1970's to the conservatism of the 1980's that was particularly expressed through the relationship between young Republican Alex Keaton(Michael J. Fox), materialistic Mallory(Justine Bateman), athletic tomboy Jennifer(Tina Yothers), independent architect Elyse(Meredith Baxter), and local TV station manager Steven(Michael Gross).

Additionally; FAMILY TIES was an instant smash when it made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982 and even won various awards, including 3 consecutive Emmy Awards for Michael J. Fox as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.

FAMILY TIES 4th Season is also the season when Scott Valentine joins the cast & crew as Mallory's boyfriend(Nick).

This 1985-86 Season takes me back to memory lane to when I was 13 years old in 7th grade and when NBC's motto was ""Let's All Be There"", which was NBC's slogan from the Fall of 1984 thru the Summer of 1986.

3175634,5,B0017VG690,"The 1980s were a very different time for both TV and the real world. No internet, no cell phones, no reality TV. No threat of mass terror. Despite the 1970s trend of  taking on social issues--see Maude and All In The Family for starters--TV still centered around family life: back when communications were slow and limited and the world was what you saw around you, as far as you could drive. Even cable TV was a luxury.

This is the world that the Keaton Family lived in: when the 1960s counterculture had long since joined the establishment. Many kept their liberal values, but traded the sit in and the be in for the local food drive or advocating a nuclear freeze.

Then there was Alex. Alex P. Keaton. Alex was, like a lot of teenagers, young, conservative, ambitious and ready to make a killing in the corporate world. I never met Alex, but went to high school with 300 of em'. Reagen youth, completely rejecting the 1960s ties of their parents.

Actually, Alex had a heart of gold--just don't tell him. All the Keaton's did. Airhead Malory, the wisecracking Jennifer, and Steven and Elese and even little Andy.

What makes Family Ties so amazing is to see this family, of so many colors and of such opposites, come together. Alex tries speed, has a friend die in a car accident. Malory divebombs Alex's college interview, Jennifer has issues with not being the baby, anymore. Watch the classic ""A My Name Is Alex."" to get to know what this family is made of.

THey really,  really, love one another, forgive one another, are there anytime for any problem. Under Alex's wisecracks and Malory's powder puff image, these individuals are SOLID. This is not shown with triteness, but with the real connective tissue that binds them.

All with amazing, laugh out-loud humor. Not many shows can make me cackle. But Family Ties does: with irony, not meanness. Wit, not barbs. It is amazing how well this hold up. While trash like ""Full House"" and ""Saved By The Bell"" was on, Family Ties was the real family show-not in a exclusionary, conservative, ""family values"" way, but showing the need we all have to be connected to those who love and understand us, warts and all.  This show  has universal appeal. If a secular, rock-jazz cigarette chewing guy like me can love Family Ties, anyone can.

Michael J. Fox, we all know, is sick now. The images have cracked. The world is too big and fast for a show like Family Ties. We're in a swamp of Google and texts and twitter and facebook  and Al Queta threats and airport patdowns. We're circling fast even beyond a Spin City. Sometimes I am glad the 1980s are over--I couldn't be publishing this in sixty seconds in 1986. But we have also lost the beauty of a local, slower,  safer world.

It is always comforting to go back in such a realistic and funny way. It will never be like this again, and that might be good. Still, I'll bet you you'll get warm inside watching, remembering. If not, you'll at least laugh.

And in 1986 or 2010,  what more can we  ask for than laughter.

 Sit, Ubu. Sit. Good show.",1292371200,10,3050,4.563302752293578

When I started watching Family ties almost 30 years ago, I jumped in somwhere between the first and the last episode and I kept watching it until the last episode. This DVD offering gave me the chance to see the very first pilot episode and all the following ones from the first season and on.

3175637,5,B0017VG690,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

The fourth season of ""Family Ties"" is absolutely phenomenal, although it is technically preceded by a misguided TV movie called ""Family Ties Vacation,"" where the Keaton family goes to England.  Even this has its good points, as the snobbish nature of Alex is severely tested and the script treats Mallory as an intelligent character.  This is also the one episode of the series shot on film.  As the season opens its basic run, the two-part proper season premiere is one of the best episodes of the series.

""The Real Thing"" sneaks up on the viewer with its power, at first seeming like an average episode in its opening act.  As the show unfolds, the natural chemistry of Michael J. Fox's Alex Keaton and Tracy Pollan's Ellen Reed makes for an engrossing half-hour.  The show also humanizes Alex over its two parts, as in Part I, he callously picks a potential girlfriend out of a directory and in Part II things don't seem so simple anymore.  Michael J. Fox often turned in some of his best work on ""Family Ties"" when he had to find the emotion in a character that was frequently written to be comically emotionless.  This is exactly the tone of ""The Real Thing,"" and the realistic undertone of the Alex Keaton-Ellen Reed relationship in this episode help make it my personal favorite show of the entire series.

This season also introduces Scott Valentine as Nick Moore in the episode ""Mr. Wrong.""  The boyfriend that would stay with Mallory Keaton until the end of the series, Nick is the classic nightmare boyfriend for parents.  The storyline also provides hypocritical conflict, as ex-hippies Steven and Elyse are now united against the kind of person they once were.  Some of Michael Gross' best moments of humor on the series came within the context of his rivalry with Scott Valentine's Nick Moore.

Also featuring a young River Phoenix in the episode ""My Tutor,"" the fourth season of ""Family Ties"" is very special.",1285891200,2,1942,4.792792792792793
3175638,3,B0017VG690,"Well, you really need not bother with the Fourth Season of this show if you're not already a fan. It delivers more of the same from the Keatons; harmless humor and situations that go down very pleasently and without much drama.

Here there's a new Keaton in town, Andy, and the crowded household finds itself having to sort through various problems that arise. There are new additions as well as Scott Valentine joins the gang as Mallory's not-so-desirable boyfriend Nick and Tracy Pollan (the real Mrs. Michael J. Fox) enters as...you guessed it; Alex's girlfriend Ellen.

The standout episode here is the one where Alex can't get any sleep and gradually drives everyone insane in the process. As for the whole season; every cast member has perfected his character and they work really well together. Scott Valentine is a very welcome addition to the show as Nick proves to have a bit more layers than you might have expected and he provides many solid laughs.

Overall; if you liked the previous three seasons than this is a no-brainer. Quite often it's a treat to pop one episode in before you dose off and see a happy family sorting things out...and on that note; Sha la la la.",1260748800,4,1181,4.695652173913044

Season 4 of Family Ties was the Year of Alex and Ellen, and if you were a child of the '80s like me, you still know all the words to ""At This Moment"" by Billy Vera and the Beaters because you heard it on Family Ties in the 2-parter where Alex and Ellen met and fell in love. (The song has just GOT to be in the episodes! It's a vital part of the story!) Season 4 was also the year Mallory brought Nick home to meet her family for the first time, and the reactions of the Keatons to Nick were comedy gold. And all of the Keatons, plus Skippy, being kept awake by Alex's insomnia (and a faulty burglar alarm), with Elyse finally providing a cure for her firstborn's sleeplessness (one of my favorite ever scenes between Meredith Baxter and Michael J. Fox), is one of the best episodes of all time. This season is a must-have for every true Family Ties fan's collection!",1211760000,14,914,4.258620689655173

Andy will be of preschool age in one episode, the very next show he's only one year old, then the next he'll be in preschool again.  Mallory is dating Nick, then an episode will show up from two seasons prior when she broke up with Rick and Alex is fixing her up, then there will be another old episode, and then it resumes with her being with Nick again in the correct season.  Jennifer is in high school is season 5 but there are two episodes of her 13th birthday party mixed in and it's painfully obvious she's younger in those than the rest.  Ellen was gone in last season, but she's here in season 5!  It's rude for the production company to not give a you-know-what about continuity when we're paying for these shows.  So, the two stars are for the lousy arrangement, the episodes being mixed up and in the wrong seasons, not just within one but within several seasons, and the interference in viewing pleasure, not the show itself or the DVD quality which are both great.",1396569600,,1157,4.485714285714286

3410123,4,B0017VG690,"FAMILY TIES was an American sitcom that aired for 7 years on NBC from 1982-89 regarding a Midwestern family in suburban Columbus, Ohio reflecting the move in America from the cultural liberism of the 1960's and 1970's to the conservatism of the 1980's that was particularly expressed through the relationship between young Republican Alex Keaton(Michael J. Fox), materialistic Mallory(Justine Bateman), athletic tomboy Jennifer(Tina Yothers), independent architect Elyse(Meredith Baxter), and local TV station manager Steven(Michael Gross).

Additionally; FAMILY TIES was an instant smash when it made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982 and even won various awards, including 3 consecutive Emmy Awards for Michael J. Fox as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.

FAMILY TIES 4th Season is also the season when Scott Valentine joins the cast & crew as Mallory's boyfriend(Nick).

This 1985-86 Season takes me back to memory lane to when I was 13 years old in 7th grade and when NBC's motto was ""Let's All Be There"", which was NBC's slogan from the Fall of 1984 thru the Summer of 1986.

3410131,5,B0017VG690,"The 1980s were a very different time for both TV and the real world. No internet, no cell phones, no reality TV. No threat of mass terror. Despite the 1970s trend of  taking on social issues--see Maude and All In The Family for starters--TV still centered around family life: back when communications were slow and limited and the world was what you saw around you, as far as you could drive. Even cable TV was a luxury.

This is the world that the Keaton Family lived in: when the 1960s counterculture had long since joined the establishment. Many kept their liberal values, but traded the sit in and the be in for the local food drive or advocating a nuclear freeze.

Then there was Alex. Alex P. Keaton. Alex was, like a lot of teenagers, young, conservative, ambitious and ready to make a killing in the corporate world. I never met Alex, but went to high school with 300 of em'. Reagen youth, completely rejecting the 1960s ties of their parents.

Actually, Alex had a heart of gold--just don't tell him. All the Keaton's did. Airhead Malory, the wisecracking Jennifer, and Steven and Elese and even little Andy.

What makes Family Ties so amazing is to see this family, of so many colors and of such opposites, come together. Alex tries speed, has a friend die in a car accident. Malory divebombs Alex's college interview, Jennifer has issues with not being the baby, anymore. Watch the classic ""A My Name Is Alex."" to get to know what this family is made of.

THey really,  really, love one another, forgive one another, are there anytime for any problem. Under Alex's wisecracks and Malory's powder puff image, these individuals are SOLID. This is not shown with triteness, but with the real connective tissue that binds them.

All with amazing, laugh out-loud humor. Not many shows can make me cackle. But Family Ties does: with irony, not meanness. Wit, not barbs. It is amazing how well this hold up. While trash like ""Full House"" and ""Saved By The Bell"" was on, Family Ties was the real family show-not in a exclusionary, conservative, ""family values"" way, but showing the need we all have to be connected to those who love and understand us, warts and all.  This show  has universal appeal. If a secular, rock-jazz cigarette chewing guy like me can love Family Ties, anyone can.

Michael J. Fox, we all know, is sick now. The images have cracked. The world is too big and fast for a show like Family Ties. We're in a swamp of Google and texts and twitter and facebook  and Al Queta threats and airport patdowns. We're circling fast even beyond a Spin City. Sometimes I am glad the 1980s are over--I couldn't be publishing this in sixty seconds in 1986. But we have also lost the beauty of a local, slower,  safer world.

It is always comforting to go back in such a realistic and funny way. It will never be like this again, and that might be good. Still, I'll bet you you'll get warm inside watching, remembering. If not, you'll at least laugh.

And in 1986 or 2010,  what more can we  ask for than laughter.

 Sit, Ubu. Sit. Good show.",1292371200,10,3050,4.563302752293578

3410134,5,B0017VG690,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

The fourth season of ""Family Ties"" is absolutely phenomenal, although it is technically preceded by a misguided TV movie called ""Family Ties Vacation,"" where the Keaton family goes to England.  Even this has its good points, as the snobbish nature of Alex is severely tested and the script treats Mallory as an intelligent character.  This is also the one episode of the series shot on film.  As the season opens its basic run, the two-part proper season premiere is one of the best episodes of the series.

""The Real Thing"" sneaks up on the viewer with its power, at first seeming like an average episode in its opening act.  As the show unfolds, the natural chemistry of Michael J. Fox's Alex Keaton and Tracy Pollan's Ellen Reed makes for an engrossing half-hour.  The show also humanizes Alex over its two parts, as in Part I, he callously picks a potential girlfriend out of a directory and in Part II things don't seem so simple anymore.  Michael J. Fox often turned in some of his best work on ""Family Ties"" when he had to find the emotion in a character that was frequently written to be comically emotionless.  This is exactly the tone of ""The Real Thing,"" and the realistic undertone of the Alex Keaton-Ellen Reed relationship in this episode help make it my personal favorite show of the entire series.

This season also introduces Scott Valentine as Nick Moore in the episode ""Mr. Wrong.""  The boyfriend that would stay with Mallory Keaton until the end of the series, Nick is the classic nightmare boyfriend for parents.  The storyline also provides hypocritical conflict, as ex-hippies Steven and Elyse are now united against the kind of person they once were.  Some of Michael Gross' best moments of humor on the series came within the context of his rivalry with Scott Valentine's Nick Moore.

Also featuring a young River Phoenix in the episode ""My Tutor,"" the fourth season of ""Family Ties"" is very special.",1285891200,2,1942,4.792792792792793
3410135,3,B0017VG690,"Well, you really need not bother with the Fourth Season of this show if you're not already a fan. It delivers more of the same from the Keatons; harmless humor and situations that go down very pleasently and without much drama.

Here there's a new Keaton in town, Andy, and the crowded household finds itself having to sort through various problems that arise. There are new additions as well as Scott Valentine joins the gang as Mallory's not-so-desirable boyfriend Nick and Tracy Pollan (the real Mrs. Michael J. Fox) enters as...you guessed it; Alex's girlfriend Ellen.

The standout episode here is the one where Alex can't get any sleep and gradually drives everyone insane in the process. As for the whole season; every cast member has perfected his character and they work really well together. Scott Valentine is a very welcome addition to the show as Nick proves to have a bit more layers than you might have expected and he provides many solid laughs.

Overall; if you liked the previous three seasons than this is a no-brainer. Quite often it's a treat to pop one episode in before you dose off and see a happy family sorting things out...and on that note; Sha la la la.",1260748800,4,1181,4.695652173913044

Here in season four with changing family dynamics of Alex, and Mallory in relationships, younger Jennifer, and parents mom Elyse, dad Steven with new baby Andy., featured the two best episodes (the first two, two-part) titled The Real Thing. Alex (Michael J. Fox), a sophomore in college, tries to find a girl (named Trisha), using the freshman student directory, and meets the roommate of the girl, named Ellen. After, the initial meeting with Ellen (Tracy Pollan, the real future wife of Michael J. Fox), and moments thereafter with her, Alex sees he likes Ellen. At the fall pledge dance with Tricia, Alex and Ellen dance, and kiss. She leaves in a hurry, and Alex learns something about Ellen. On the day of a exam, Alex can do nothing but think of her (Ellen). And, the night of a big school dinner, he talks with his Mom, Elyse (Meredith Baxter Birney), and tells her the feeling he has for Ellen. Elyse, asks Alex does she (Ellen) know this? Alex, states ""I should have told her. "" Ellen, whom is in a relationship, is on her way by train to Pennsylvania to be with her fianc, to be married on Sunday. Alex, on his way to the dinner, who earlier had taken Ellen to the train station, and talked indirectly, turns around, and drives many miles to get to Ellen's destination before she arrives, and almost misses her. During their moments together, at the dance, the song ""At This Moment,"" by Billy Vera, and The Beaters is featured. And of course the theme song (by Jeff Barry, and Tom Scott) at the beginning of the show,  is sung by Johnny Mathis, and Deniece Williams. The end music is composed, and played by Tom Scott.

8267408,5,B0017VG690,"Family Ties was one of the NBC shows that almost didn't survive due to low ratings in their earlier seasons. You can thank the late Brandon Tartikoff who kept the series and it slowly thrived. The series had sixties hippies, Steven and Elyse Keaton, and their four children living in Columbus, Ohio. Their fourth season is probably one of the best seasons in this comedy series where Alex and the family going to England for a vacation. Alex studies at Oxford where he doesn't fit in with the British noble set and Mallory falls in love first with a British Lord to be and then Nick Moore, the struggling artist.

There are memorable and funny series in this sometimes serious and loving comedy. I always felt Michael Gross (Steven Keaton) deserved more credit. I'll never forget the episode where Nick becomes more like Alex to please Steven where makes an unforgettable scene in the shoe store. Alex falls in serious love with artist and dancer, Ellen Reed (played by his real life wife, Tracy Pollan). Mallory too falls in love with artist, Nick Moore, (played brilliantly by Steve Valentine). Twelve year old Jennifer is becoming a young woman and Andy is still a cute baby.

This four DVD compilation of the fourth season includes a gag reel and a public service announcement by Michael J. Fox about Parkinson's disease. I wished there was more bloopers or behind the scenes of this season. Fox had just acted in the big hit film, ""Back to the Future,"" and returned to the series. Fox won primetime Emmys for Outstanding Leading Actor in a Comedy Series. I wished they had showed clips of his winning speech.

Family Ties makes me wish for the eighties again or a wish to see this show in syndication like it used to be. Of the seven seasons, my favorite line is ""there was a kangaroo in my living room"" Steve tells the kids in one of the past clips in the third season. The fourth season had Meredith Baxter Birney (mother Elyse) return from a maternity leave after giving birth to twins in the previous season.

Family Ties had always given equal attention to all the characters in the fourth season. The writers paid as much attention to the parents and to the kids as well.
