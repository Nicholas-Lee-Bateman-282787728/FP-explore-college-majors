8208235,5,B000T9KIIG,"The DVD is elegant and very well produced. It is everything I hoped it would be. Signing along to Christian Hymns makes learning sign a very spiritual experience. The performer Hayden Riley is so beautiful and truly inspirational. I recommend this DVD to anyone who wants a joyful experience learning sign language. I am now going to order A Praising Spirit Vol. 2, and all the other DVD's with Hayden Riley performing. Thank you Hayden, and God bless you.",1363910400,4,456,4.784810126582278
8208236,4,B000T9KIIG,"I enjoyed the video.  I wanted to use the video to help learn some sign language.  However, even the ""slow"" speed of the video was too fast to pick up alot of words.  The signs used for the same words were sometimes different too.  I think more basic and consistent words would be much easier for beginners.",1309132800,4,307,4.333333333333333
