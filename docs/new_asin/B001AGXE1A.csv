8277369,5,B001AGXE1A,"Berenstain Bears shows have great morals. Stories on this dvd include
Green eyed monster- Brother gets a new bike and sister is jealous. She tries to ride the bike but isn't big enough.
new neighbors- a new family moves in and does things a lot differently than previous neighbors or even the bear family. The family learns about accepting people that are different.
prize pumpkin-papa grows a pumpkin and wants to win at the fair. He gets upset with Farmer Ben and learns about doing his best and being happy for others instead of jealous.
think of those in need- the cubs clean their room and wind up with a lot of things they no longer need. While trying to bring the items somewhere they pass a retirement home and decide to donate their things there.
bad dream - the family watches a show and it scares sister. She has a bad dream about the characters in the show and then is scared to watch the show the next time it is on tv.

8277370,2,B001AGXE1A,"I just spent almost 2 hours trying to convince my 4-year old that the green eyed monster is not going to come to him in a nightmare. He watches a wide variety of television shows, and has never had this reaction before. We have read and enjoyed the books - but watching this episode felt sinister.",1389484800,2,297,4.321428571428571

8277373,1,B001AGXE1A,"While many things from years gone by are superior in quality, creativity and craftsmanship to todays goods and services, this DVD of Berenstain Bears episode is quite the contrary. This DVD is not the modern version of the cartoon. Rather, this DVD is a collection of out dated, and rather shallow, cartoon programming. What a shame!",1292198400,,333,4.964285714285714

8277376,5,B001AGXE1A,"I thought kids shouldn't watch movies until they are five. Then I had twins! We limit movies to 1/2 hr a day and some days don't watch any. That said the Berenstain Bears immediately appealed to all the family because the stories are sweet and simple, but deal with real world problems. There's a focus on values and ethics, but it's still fun and cute for the kids. My girls (age three) never tire of seeing these stories over and over. They especially like the ones that are just a little bit scary such as the ""Green Eyed Monster"" in which Sister Bear has a frightening dream about her envy.",1243728000,4,594,4.409090909090909
