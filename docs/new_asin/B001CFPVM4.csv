8287531,1,B001CFPVM4,"After having problems to watch this DVD it turned out to have the same basic contents written in his book, his many Youtube movies and in person ""teachings"". A lot of cloudy words simulating ""deep meanings"" which appear to me just more or less as empty cans -but empty cans can make quite a noise! I know people which are fascinated by him and yes, he has some charisma in person. But looking close up to what he says, not much of substance remains. I know he has quite a legion of marketing folks behind him, but this does not make anything better. Sorry, but I can really not recommend this DVD like any other products of him. Obviously the main intention appears to me: How can I get as many dollars out from nothing...",1513555200,,722,4.355555555555555
8287532,1,B001CFPVM4,"I tried this cd on three different players and it did not work.  Could be just a bad cd. Thomas Hubl is absolutely an excellent teacher and important message.  Highly recommend Thomas.  I will return the cd and request another, assuming there is just a malfunction here.  I wanted to give it no rating but the system requested I do at least one star.  I give this cd problem no stars.  I give Thomas Hubl 10 stars!!!",1307232000,2,416,4.337662337662338
