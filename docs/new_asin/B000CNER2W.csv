2466257,5,B000CNER2W,I was probably the only person I knew that went to go see this movie. I dragged my girlfriend along and I throughly enjoyed the movie!! Very funny and not your typcial brainless teen comedy.,1133740800,5,190,4.457142857142857
2466258,5,B000CNER2W,"The movie is about a bunch of teens going against the principal and thats pretty much it Some scenes were stupid but the rest of the film will make you laugh I promise,I say buy it,it is worth the money.",1133568000,5,203,4.1
2466283,1,B000CNER2W,"Except for Nicole Richie's delusion that she has comic (or any) talent, the movie's worst sin is that it is inept 95 percent of the time. The remaining 5 percent is kind of cute.",1256083200,,178,4.264705882352941
2466284,1,B000CNER2W,"I was very offended when I saw this movie played on a local TV station. I am relatively young (26), but even I see the danger these kinds of movies are to our society.
1. This movie encourages and promotes rebellion. The adults are portrayed as stupid and hardheaded. Already kids/teens are very disrespectful to adults and teachers. Teaching them to swear at and fight authority is utterly wrong; no wonder we have so many people breaking laws. There is no respect for authority.
2. This movie showed a scene were students were all kissing/making out with each other; guys with guys, girls with girls, etc. What is next on movies for teens- naked orgies??? Lets get this straight- I work as an emergency department RN, and I see teens come in with STD's on a daily basis. WE DONT NEED MORE MOVIES TO ENCOURAGE TEEN SEX!!! Already kids are oversaturated with sex everywhere; there is no need for this. Studies are showing that just promoting condoms do not work; condoms are not 100% effective against HIV, Herpes, HPV, Chlamydia, pregnancy, or Gonorrhea; only abstinence is!! (a HIV virus is hundreds of times smaller than a sperm cell, and condoms were only invented to prevent the passage of sperm; but are still only 80% effective against pregnancy... who would gamble with their life that way???)
3. Why don't we encourage sweet innocence on movies anymore??? I am going back to watching Little House on the Prairie and Brady Bunch; shows that were clean, healthy for families, and taught good lessons. I do not want my children watching movies encouraging them to ridicule teachers. I want my kids to look forward to learning, to be kind and respectful, and to spend their time studying hard and getting good grades. TH
4. Most teens in the USA are spoiled and selfish. I've been overseas where people are grateful for even the basics of life. THE KIDS IN THIS MOVIE SHOULD GO OVERSEAS TO INDIA AND SEE WHAT LIFE IS LIKE WITHOUT HIGH SCHOOL OR TEACHERS!!! THEY SHOULD BE THANKFUL THEY EVEN HAVE FOOD, HOUSING AND BOOKS TO LEARN FROM!!! (And that they even have teachers in the first place!!!)
5. Let schools get like what is being promoted in this movie and people will even more so: cheat, lie, sleep around, murder each other, etc... WE NEED MORE MORALITY AND RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY IN THE USA- NOT LESS! No wonder our violence is so high compared to other countries.
I'm so disgusted by what this movie represents, and sadly is becoming more prevalent in today's society... We will just have more and more school shootings in the future...",1254614400,,2547,4.713004484304933
2466285,1,B000CNER2W,"Borderline propaganda thinly disguised as entertainment...  This movie is so preachy and politically heavy-handed, that after watching it you'll feel like you've been socked in the jaw by Michael Moore.

The gist of the movie is that the ""hero"" kids want to dictate how and what they're taught in school, particularly regarding sex education.  Sort of defeats the purpose of education if the kids are so convinced they already have all the answers, but this irony/hypocrisy is apparently lost on the filmmakers.  The kids go to such obnoxious extremes to enforce their will on the school administration, that it's hard to imagine that any objective viewer will still be rooting for them by the end of the movie, and yet that is clearly the filmmakers' deluded intention.  I found myself rooting for the ""evil"" high school principal.  I wonder if the filmmakers would be proud that I rebelled against their establishment, or disturbed that I chose the ""wrong"" side.

Some of the things held up as liberties are so laughably absurd, that it makes the kids look more stupid than bravely idealistic.  (Pretending to commit suicide during a school talent show is a constitutional right?  Seriously?)  As one might expect, this movie follows the disturbing trend of portraying all kids as good and wise and most adults (except for those that agree with the kids, of course) as bad and buffoonish.  The characters are all one dimensional.  The ""antagonist"" adults are portrayed as having no redeeming qualities whatsoever.

This movie was ""inspired"" by actual events.  Somehow, I have the feeling that the ""real"" kids probably did have a legitimate gripe against an overbearing principal.  However, the kids in the movie are so blindly convinced that they are right and everyone who disagrees with them is wrong, that they elicited no empathy from me at all.",1184803200,4,1851,5.022950819672131
2466286,1,B000CNER2W,"A movie that champions freedom of speech for Bigots as the only freedom they promote is freedom for themselves but not for any who has different points of view...This piece of piled on propaganda is uneven and a great example of card stacking argumentation....It is the usual technique of like minded folks to portray anyone who disagees with them as totally stupid and evil...
First of all it portrays a crowd of conformists..Whenever ever everyone thinks a lot...NO ONE THINKING...
These are the same people who would shout down any conservative speaker who might appear on their campus...I taught school for years and these are not typical high school kids....
What 'principles/"" did these infant minds brains champion? Drugs, homosexuality, free sex on demand...No counter arguments are given any space...
These 'champions of freedom?' would protest against any science teacher who would offer arguments championing the theory of creation science, any stuent starting a Bible club, the formation of ROTC classes...
These are examples of the people who have controled our culture since 1963 and helped to champion new sexually transmitted diseases, 40% of children being born to unwed mothers, increased drug use, ignorance of American history, falling graduation rates....
THE SLOGAN OF THE PEOPLE WHO CREATED THIS TRASH....
FREEDOM OF 'ME' BUT NOT FOR 'THEE'...Jack Schlatter",1182470400,2,1380,5.364055299539171
2466287,4,B000CNER2W,"Yes, it's some of the jokes like the one in the title that do sort of mar this otherwise brilliant, quick paced movie that pulls out all the stops to make its' point. Like the slightly smarter and more realistically presented Pump Up the Volume, Kids in America delves deep into the root of a major issue, a principal who has nothing but her own interests and future as a superintendant in mind. Unlike Pump whose high school population only really becomes active at the end, Kids' high school's students get involved right away. Throughout the movie they create some positive havoc in some truly jaw dropping ways. At the end, we hear our head revolutionary offer us ""So, did we change the world? If not, its still early in the week"" and yes, it seems that a phrase such as this is a perfect way to end this all too short film. They may have just got the ball rolling, which is exactly as it should be. There is work to be done in this fashion within schools all across America. We send our kids to these learning institutions every day. So as you watch Kids in America, take the cheesy jokes in stride and see the hugely important issues presented. You'll be glad you did.",1168560000,2,1174,4.414746543778802
2466288,5,B000CNER2W,"I loved this movie

I am huge fan of Julie Bowen and she was fantastic in the movie

Also the cast of students were really GREAT

The movie was a lot of fun for me and the commentary track made it worthwhile to own rather than to rent",1168300800,,234,3.8333333333333335
2466289,5,B000CNER2W,"Really enjoyed the movie, and loved hearing ""Summertime"" from New York's very own Brother Love!",1153872000,2,95,5.4
2466290,5,B000CNER2W,"I bought this movie not really knowing what it was about. I watched it and I was amazed. It's based on a few true stories of kids in schools who were suspended and that really made it stand out. The acting was incredible and the story was just plain amazing. Seeing as I'm in high school, I could really see where the teens were getting their ideas from, but I'm not pulling those stunts! Really, this movie was awesome and I really recomend it.",1145059200,3,445,4.309523809523809
2466291,5,B000CNER2W,"I bought this DVD on the strength of Gregory Smith being in it, and I have to say that Gregory does not disappoint. Neither does the rest of the film. The movie is most enjoyable, and in some places, rather reminiscent of that glorious TV series from the early 1990's Parker Lewis Can't Lose, except with rather more serious content and intention.

Amd what can I say about Gregory Smith that has not been said before?This young man is a most wonderful and natural performer, and I certainly look forward to many years of seeing his work in the movies and on TV.

Excellent effort all round",1142640000,9,590,4.5046728971962615
2466292,4,B000CNER2W,"I almost turned this off during the first five minutes, as the jokes were obvious and painfully unfunny, the budget was glaringly low, and the dialogue didn't ring true.  I was thinking about winging an email to Roger Ebert, who liked it, asking him what was he thinking.

But for some reason I stuck with it, and I ended up liking it a LOT.  True, a lot of the jokes throughout the rest of the movie were still bad, but I also laughed out loud more than a few times.  Moreover, the movie's simply a lot of fun, with smart politics--objectionable only to Neanderthals--and a cast full of recognizable faces.  Though I had to go to IMDB to figure out that the Oriental actress, Emy Coligado, who is obviously too old for this high school kid role, plays Piama on ""Malcolm in the Middle.""

Be sure to check out the outtakes on the DVD.  On many DVDs these would consist of a lot of lame, unfunny mugging for the camera, but many of the outtakes on here are actually pretty good.  Julie Bowen is particularly funny, singing that cameltoe song, and explaining why she ""hates"" Angelina Jolie:  ""She has a big chest, big lips, skinny legs, and she's philanthropic.  I'm a selfish, flat-chested, big-assed bitch.""",1141948800,10,1206,4.567441860465117

8099390,5,B000CNER2W,"The movie is good to pass the time and is entertaining, of course it won't blow you out of your seat but it will keep you happy.

That's all there is to it, 4 of the 6 bad reviews on amazon are ignorant individuals who hate Nicole Richie and focused so much on her, despite her minor part in the film.
Watch the entire movie for what it is, don't focus on a single 'actor or actress'.
Also the other 2 bad reviews are those that over thought what the movie meant at the time and seem a bit crazy. So overall there's only decent good reviews on this movie :) enjoy!",1367712000,,564,4.035714285714286
8099391,1,B000CNER2W,"The movie is not engaging,

The acting is not realistic, You have actors doing a bad job of playing actors ... you just can't believe the actors.",1359158400,,145,4.37037037037037
8099392,4,B000CNER2W,"I saw part of this on TV and then never heard from it again, so I bought the DVD so I can see the complete movie.  I was particularly intrigued by the cute red-haired star who came from nowhere and then disappeared into obscurity after this movie was made.  Her name is Stephanie Sherrin.  The movie is your less-than-average High School comedy movie and gets a 2-star rating.  But I really liked watching that cute red-haired girl so I added two stars to give it a 4-star rating.  I'm surprised that Caitlin Wachs didn't shine in this movie.  Caitlin has one of the most beautiful faces I've ever seen.  But in this movie she just looked like another pretty cheerleader.  It seems in this case that it's the girl with the cuter personality that shined.",1283212800,2,753,4.525925925925926
8099393,5,B000CNER2W,"I found this little gem on Netflix--well, actually, my wife found it.  Netflix suggested that I would like it about 3.5 stars, I'd find it cute, but nothing really memorable.  Instead, I was led on an amazing journey of reliving my high school days and how they could have gone.  The movie is about a school that is held under the iron fist of a totalitarian principal that refuses to let students express themselves.  One of the first transgressions that occurs is the principal suspends a girl for gluing condoms to her shirt for condoning sex.  The girl argues that no matter what people say, students will have sex and it's better for them to be safe than girls getting pregnant.  This and a few other things sparks a school-wide revolution where the students protest for their right of freedom of speech.

I read a few reviews on here where people said this movie is ""dangerous.""  Are serious?  When I went to high school, a student was arrested for sitting in one of the ""popular"" kids seats.  I kid you not.  He was almost charged for resisting arrest because his mother came to the school and challenged the school's wisdom.  These are the types of situations going on everywhere--high schools and colleges alike--and I agree with the movie's morals entirely.  We need to teach students to learn.  We need to teach students how to think for themselves instead of just accepting things because ""that's the way they are.""  A powerful message hidden in a popcorny, teeny bopper camouflage.  I rank this one up there with Freedom Writers as one of my favorite movies to show students.",1277683200,3,1588,4.699275362318841
8099394,1,B000CNER2W,"The video store was completely out of all the major movie titles, so I'm looking around and land on Kids in America. At first I didn't really want to rent it, but since there really wasn't much else I just went ahead with it. This movie was absolutely horrible from start to finish. This movie has no plot, terrible acting, among other things that make this movie terrible. It is honestly an unwatchable movie. I literally had to turn it off 45 minutes into it because I was bored and Nicole Richie's acting made me lose braincells. So please stay away from this movie it will rot your brain and bore you to death.

8099395,1,B000CNER2W,"I think the fact that Nicole Richie didn't have to audition for kids in america says it all. She has no discernible talent and she gets by in this film by playing the only role she is capable of: herself - an ego-maniacal uber-slut. I've have seen cardboard boxes act with more personality, charisma, talent, intelligence and professionalism.",1275264000,,342,4.913793103448276
8099396,1,B000CNER2W,"AWFUL!!! If ever there was a case for barring someone from the film industry, this piece of trash is it. Money DOES NOT equate talent (or common sense in the case of Nicole Richie).

This movie has little plot and Richie's zombie-like ""acting"" puts the deep freeze on anything you might want to get out of the film. There's a reason the rest of the cast is made up of unknowns and little known bit players in Hollywood.

There have been some pretty dense actors through the years, but Nicole Richie is by far the runaway winner of all time. She even believes her award from Harvard is something good! Some people learn they don't have the skills to be in the business after the first flop, or at least after the second bomb. Nicole, however is obviously too blinded by her bedazzled sunglasses and purse to be able to recognize she has been in FOUR of the worst movies of all time, been to jail many times, does daily drugs, makes sex tapes, and spends her dads credit card. So the next time someone wants to cast Nicole Richie...nevermind. Said enough. Stay far away from this movie!

8099397,5,B000CNER2W,"I can't say it better than Rodger Ebert: ""Once in a blue moon a movie escapes the shackles of its genre and does what it really wants to do.

Here's what one would look like if it had brains.""",1263686400,2,317,4.213114754098361
