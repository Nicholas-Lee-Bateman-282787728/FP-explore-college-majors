Thank you for your quick delivery.",1373328000,,155,3.727272727272727
8324311,2,B000G1ALHK,"This was pretty boring. Alot of hand and partner work. Not much foot work. You really can't tell from this video the distinct swing style, maby that is why they call it ""modern jive""",1282867200,,182,4.382352941176471
8324312,4,B000G1ALHK,"I have purchased numerous instructional dance videos and I rank this ""very good"".  The dance moves in this video are well presented and organized, starting from simple moves to the more advanced.  The instructors provide good explanation on how to lead & follow, and how to position and move the upper body and hands.  The short coming in this video is that they do not explain the footwork.

The dancers, especially in the Jive section make the dance look really fun.  However, it should be noted the moves for the followers have a lot of turns that for someone that gets dizzy easily, it would not be fun.",1207094400,4,607,4.583333333333333
