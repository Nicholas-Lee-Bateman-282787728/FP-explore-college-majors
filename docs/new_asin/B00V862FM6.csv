8709584,5,B00V862FM6,"Such a wonderful recording (My actual rating is 4.9).
My only diappointment is, I wanted to see more of the things I heard on the audio cd that are not part of the DVD. Some of the interludes, intros and personal engagements on the cd were missing (I.e. those involving Uncle Peanut). The DVD  however does have Kirk up close spitting knowledge relevant to music and social history.
The music entertains you, while the Whalums display a cohesive and talented FAMILY....something loved by The Almighty God.",1458000000,2,505,4.872093023255814
