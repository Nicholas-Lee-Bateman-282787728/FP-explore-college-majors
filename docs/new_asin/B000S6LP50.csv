With that said, I also showed it to my PK-5th grade music students (we had just finished a unit on the Nutcracker) and they loved it. The 5th graders weren't as into it as the younger grades (and also didn't seem to get all the humor) but the 4th and under really enjoyed it. I will definitely show it again in a few years. A great way to expose the music of Tchaikovsky to kids with (or without) them knowing it...",1451433600,,499,4.05050505050505

2881452,4,B000S6LP50,"My daughter loves all things Tom & Jerry, so we bought her this to watch in our holiday movie rotation. Honestly, for grown ups, it's a bit boring, but for young Tom and Jerry fans, it's a great movie to introduce them to the world of The Nutcracker.",1433894400,,250,4.229166666666667
2881453,5,B000S6LP50,"It was said that Tom and Jerry's Nutcracker Tale came from Joe Barbera's own ideas, as the end credits point out, in fact this movie was dedicated to the memory of an original toon pioneer. (As Bill Hanna passed on working on The Magic Ring 5 years earlier.) This whole hour-long special is set to the Nutcracker music, in a similar fashion to the Nutcracker segment of Fantasia. After Fantasia debuted in the early 1940's, the Nutcracker eventually became a beloved Christmas tradition, the story AND the music (and Deems Taylor, the emcee of Fantasia, thought it wasn't played much anymore; Mr. Taylor's been eating his words about it ever since)! Never has a cat-and-mouse-chase been so classical, and slapstick-comically-filled, at Christmastime. Somehow, the DVD of this special has it in Fullscreen, just like with Bah, Humduck!: A Looney Tunes Christmas only 1 year earlier, as both modern Christmas classics were originally filmed in HD-Widescreen. If you always wanted to see how Joe Barbera finished his legendary career before he passed on, make no hesitation to add Tom and Jerry's Nutcracker Tale to your Hanna-Barbera Christmas classics collection today (since it was never in the Santa's Little Helpers set just last year), no regrets!",1429488000,4,1250,5.132352941176471
2881454,4,B000S6LP50,"This is a great original take on the Nutcracker suite. The only things that it has in common with the Nutcracker is the music and that it was animated as a stage production. The show never stops reminding the viewer of that. Tom, the leader of a bunch of cat soldiers, is trying to stop Jerry and Tuff, the little gray French mouse, are on a mission to save their village from the cat king and his cat flunkies. They are shot out of a cannon by the cats and land in a snowy forest where they spy the north star that eventually leads them to the toymaker's house. Tom and his soldier cats try to stop them along the way. Tom runs through several stage back drops to and from the toymaker's house.
The movie is unique and at the beginning of the movie Tom and his fellow cats are actually singing. Tom has a couple of solo lines, otherwise he doesn't speak. The music is very beautiful throughout the show.",1426291200,2,904,4.261627906976744

2881499,5,B000S6LP50,"I'm a sucker for classical music with kids. I grew up on Tom and Jerry, and a lot of the really old episodes use some great music.  My daughters love the old shows, so I decided to try this, as it still has a lot of elements of the classic Tom and Jerry. The plot is cute, the additional characters are funny, and the original songs catchy. For someone expecting classic Tom and Jerry, this might be a let down. But for those looking for a mash of the old and newer format, or for the younger generation, it's quite enjoyable. My 5 year old especially liked it, so after renting it, we ended up buying it.",1414195200,,605,4.170940170940171

DVD-ROM Special Features (I didn't try this)

The Good:
A cute little fairy tale, Nutcracker themed cartoon. It's fun to see these characters do ballet and you really can't beat the Nutcraker Suite as the majority of the background music. Aside from the Tchaikovsky, there is some neat numbers that were added.

I think this is the first time I've seen the Triplet Kittens from ""Triplet Trouble"" used for more than just cameos

This movie really has a charming feel to it. What is really enjoying about this feature is how much the music is involved in the animation. Yes, there are characters that speak, but more often then not it's the music that ""speaks"" more and drives the action.

The Bad:
Tuffy's atrocious French accent! BOO! Speaking of accents, the Toy Elf's accent is far worse than Tuffy's. The Cat King, not really liking the introduction of a new villain like that, not sure why they chose a different cat as a main villain, than say, Butch who has always been a foil for Tom.

The Ugly:
The accents! Really! Couldn't someone have found better voice actors for Tuffy and the Elf. The voices of these characters are totally distracting from the enjoyment of this little film.

Overall I like this. It's a fun little movie once you get passed the accents and the cat king. This will have some rotation during the Holidays in my house.",1371772800,,1731,4.83728813559322
2881538,5,B000S6LP50,Originally I saw this on TV and just HAD to have a copy for both my grandchildren and myself. A new and different variation of the Nutcracker.,1365724800,,142,4.296296296296297

2881544,3,B000S6LP50,My grandson was not as happy to watch this as he is the other Tom and Jerry DVDs.  I guess it is too musical and not enough to laugh over for him.,1358380800,,146,3.5625

2881556,5,B000S6LP50,I grew up with Tom and Jerry.  They must be good to have been around that long. Better for little kids that the current ones of which some should be rated R and seem to have been written more for adults.,1357084800,,203,3.951219512195122
2881557,5,B000S6LP50,My 3 year old grandson adores this movie and never gets tired of this movie and wil watch it over and over. Good introduction to The Nutcracker music.,1356825600,,150,4.392857142857143

2881565,2,B000S6LP50,I grew up watching Tom and Jerry and I couldn't get through the first 15 minutes of it. I love the old time Tom and Jerry's when the music spoke for what was happening in the cartoon. This would probably be a good one for little kids that aren't very familiar with the way the older cartoons are.,1292544000,6,296,4.120689655172414

2881585,4,B000S6LP50,"My daughter is 5 years old and performed in the Nutcracker Ballet.  She loves the music and loves Tom & Jerry.  There were a few phrases used in the movie that caught me a bit off guard, something like ""hang on like a fat guy to a doughnut"".  But we talked about it and she knows it is not a nice thing to say.  She can watch it over and over and over and over again.  Good thing I like the music too.",1265760000,,401,3.783132530120482

2881589,5,B000S6LP50,"It started out slow to set up the story. At first it did not seem like your typical Tom and Jerry story, but that soon changed and they were off and running. The three year old was intrigued, not moving the entire time on the first viewing of the show. He loves it. He may wear out this DVD in a few weeks.

Update: This DVD continues to be a favorite with our three year old. He anticipates much of the action and hums along with the music.",1231372800,,441,4.011363636363637

2881591,5,B000S6LP50,"This movie is great! My 4 year old saw it once on TV and loved it! I came to Amazon to find it, since it was hard to find being not one of the most popular movie/cartoon titles that are out these days. It is definitely an enjoyable classic and well worth the money!!",1201046400,4,266,3.9444444444444446

8204399,1,B000S6LP50,"We thought this was pretty terrible. My husband and I love watching the old original Tom & Jerry episodes to relax. We saw this one had great reviews and though it might be a nice longer movie similar in funniness to the classic Tom & Jerry. This is more like a weakly done spoof done for a little girl who is into Barbies, maybe, with the very occasional dash of the usual rip-roaring Tom & Jerry chase and crash. The humor is very cheesy, nothing to make an adult laugh, but I wouldn't even show this to kids because there are some moments that are so overdone they are distorted and kind of brutal or just plain weird.",1515715200,,621,4.271186440677966

8204401,2,B000S6LP50,"First, I love animation.  And Ive enjoyed other Tom & Jerry movies. So, I decided to watch this one, being in a festive mood and all. But it ruined my holiday evening.
Except for a couple of chuckles, this movie stank!
Bad animation, terrible story that made no sense, and horrible dialogue. Now, you may think this is a movie for kids so is it any wonder I didn't appreciate it. But I say I have enjoyed many good kids movies as an adult - if you can call me that. So, avoid this movie whether you are young or old.",1513814400,,516,4.108910891089109
