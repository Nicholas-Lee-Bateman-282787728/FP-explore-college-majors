8399233,3,B003L16F5O,"We bought this and the PBS ""Cezanne in Provence"" at the same time. This was okay, but not spectacular, whereas the PBS video was great. Even though we thought we knew a lot about Cezanne, including having walked through his home area in Aix, seen Cezanne exhibitions in Muse d'Orsay and elsewhere, seen other films and read other books, we still got substantial new information from the PBS video.",1363737600,9,397,4.768115942028985
