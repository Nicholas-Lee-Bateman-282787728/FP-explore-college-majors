8566631,5,B00BD7FTKA,Nice job of presenting valid science and reasons we should be funding psychedelic medicine research. My parents understood better what I've been trying to explain about consciousness and the potential for healing related to psilocybin and other entheogen/psychedelics.,1470441600,,268,6.078947368421052
8566632,5,B00BD7FTKA,"Psychedelic entheogens have certain negative perceptions in ""modern"" culture because of abuse.  Many people are unaware that alcohol itself was originally an entheogen (some 5000+ years ago), strictly confined to those ""priests"" administering it.  Today alcohol is the most popular entertainment drug in the world and it is generally accepted as useful, social, fun even chic. Alcohol also causes far more abuse, harm, misery and premature death in the world than all other mind altering substances combined.  Another fact is that most cultures (around 90%!) regularly use psychedelic entheogens as an part of their medicine and religious/spiritual beliefs.  This video contains an excellent short introduction to early research and application of psychedelics into ""modern"" science/medicine, along with a smattering of experiences, associations, and current work...a sorta ""must watch"" for anyone!",1412640000,,898,5.884615384615385
8566633,4,B00BD7FTKA,"I found the subject matter fascinating, its sad that it has taken so long for research on psychedelics to begin again  as they could be of real help in conditions that don't respond to traditional medication",1392940800,,207,4.75
8566634,5,B00BD7FTKA,"An extremely well presented and tasteful documentary on the profound healing, creativity and deep insights that can be gained from the intelligent use of psychedelic medicines such as psilocybin (magic mushrooms), mescaline (from the Peyote cactus), DMT admixtures, cannabis and LSD.

Details the discovery of LSD by Albert Hoffman and the exciting research that began as a result of its extraordinary effects on human consciousness and awareness, and how the altered states from this and other hallucinogenic compounds closely resemble spontaneous spiritual or mystical states, near-death and out of body experiences, and themes and visions commonly found in both religious and mythological literature.

Briefly talks about the well-documented history of naturally occurring visionary-plant use by indigenous cultures all over the world for thousands of years, as both religious sacraments and as devices for accessing hidden knowledge of the natural world. I find it ironic that these so-called ""primitive people"" have safely and respectfully incorporated hallucinogenic plants into their way of life and lived in harmony with nature for tens of thousands of years, whereas modern, industrial, materialistic societies have demonized hallucinogens and almost destroyed the planet in only a mere hundred.

After government intervention in the 60's and subsequent shutting-down of all medical research on these remarkable substances for almost 3 decades, research has begun again and their efficacy in treating alcoholism, drug addiction and to reduce anxiety and allay the fear of death in terminally ill cancer patients is being shown with extremely positive results. Psychedelics are powerful medicines that work on the psyche, leading to deep introspection and understanding of how things are beyond the limits of our 5 senses and have the potential to affect lasting positive change on people's outlook and way of life. They are not drugs of dependence, nor are they normally abused like cocaine, heroin, alcohol and tobacco. Society's habitual, ignorant attitude towards these substances has come about from brain-washing through media hype, the education system and knee-jerk governmental legislation, however this is slowly starting to change.

This presentation goes a long way to bringing the information back to the common people. It provides viewers with a much more balanced view of psychedelics and will hopefully help to remove much of the unwarranted stigma associated with them. It will undoubtedly help to promote further interest and research in this fascinating area, provided it gets the exposure and air-time it most certainly deserves.

Highly recommended viewing.",1373673600,3,2686,5.6716417910447765
