8508520,5,B0071N9FDW,"An intriguing movie with a tragic love story. A man who does not seem to care about anything or anybody, focused only on the job he had at hands, which is crossing the line that divides the two Koreas and smuggling people and things back and forth.

A mysterious man that does not talk (the movie does not make clear if he cannot speak or just chose not to) and is known as Poongsan, which is at the same time a North Korean hunting dog breed as well as the brand of the cigarettes he smokes.

Hired to smuggle a politician's mistress across the border and being betrayed, he is asked by the woman he brings to the South to take her back to the North.

A love connection develops between them and the aftermath is tragic.

In my opinion, this one is a must see movie.",1427500800,,767,4.197278911564626

8508522,4,B0071N9FDW,"Emotionally wrenching and philosophical, Poongsan (alternatively titled, Poongsan Dog) grabs you from the first scene and doesn't let go until the last.

The story revolves around a man (Yoon Kae Sang) with no apparent political alliances (either for the North or the South) who appears to put humanity before political ideology.  He goes to the DMZ, photographs messages left on the outer fence by family members for those living on the other side, selects one and ultimately crosses the border to seemingly soothe the pain of separation in some small way.  The pain portrayed by the separated family members is visceral and you as the viewer know in the back of your mind that the separated family members are getting older and this one opportunity to connect is all the more urgent.  At the same time, you are left wondering why someone would risk his/her life to connect individuals he doesn't know.

Due to his success in crossing the border, the South Korean National Intelligence Service then hires him to bring the girlfriend of a high level North Korean who had previously defected to South Korea.  Everything starts to fall apart when the courier and the defector's girlfriend begin to fall for each other.

Most interesting to me was how the lead character's unclear political allegiance played out and how damaging political ideology can be.

Also, please note, the editorial review on the product page appears to contain content for two movies.  This movie does NOT have anything to do with Captain Sakae Oba.

Finally, for those with children, this movie contains mature themes and violence and would likely be rated PG-13.",1350432000,5,1637,4.985294117647059
