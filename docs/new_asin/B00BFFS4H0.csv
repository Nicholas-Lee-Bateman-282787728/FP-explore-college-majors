5614935,5,B00BFFS4H0,"This video is for beginners, however, if you spend time practicing the techniques that he shows you you could be spending months to perfect his basic instruction. Kilani is a music therapist by profession in addition to being a superbly talented conga and hand drum player. His teaching style is honest, relaxed and focused. The video is not a long one but it does not need to be. There is enough work to do in this video to keep the beginner busy for quite a while.  For the price, when  private instruction can cost as much as $100.00 an hour with a person of Kilani's caliber; I would say $16.00 is a gift!",1374883200,8,609,4.380530973451328
5614936,4,B00BFFS4H0,"This DVD is providing clear and user-friendly instruction. While journey through enjoying the Congas, it is primarily intended for musicians with beginner and an intermediate skill level. I absolutely found the whole instruction easy to follow. This video will certainly prove educational for anyone with an interest in Latin music. It is sure to expand your musical range by introducing you to these timeless rhythms.",1362009600,6,418,5.446153846153846

8567720,5,B00BFFS4H0,"I ordered this video for the percussionist for the community band in which I play.  I gave to him as a gift, with the hopes that he will watch it and learn from it in playing the congas.  It's a very good instructive video and I would recommend to anyone wanting to learn to play any type of latinl percussion. .  Excellent presentation.  R. P.

8567726,5,B00BFFS4H0,"My first of this type, but recommended. Only an hour into it, but well worth the money. Perfectly paced. I'm an experienced drummer and multi-instrumentalist, so have no problem with rhythm. But as a beginner hand percussionist this is just right for me, and well worth the price. Well shot camera angles, really help. Ability to repeatedly review & practice with, makes it preferred over live lesson. Live instructor could help you with any specific fault or problem you may have developing proper technique.",1430265600,5,509,5.071428571428571
