6597503,1,B00MP2FQ0U,"MGM have decided to do another blu-ray reissue of the Chuck norris films for some reason which makes no sense
again with absolutely no new extras at all, just typical barebones release
i Guess MGM are trying to sell their Chuck norris films on Blu-ray but having no much luck doing it
so they Decided to re-issue the films in Different packaging which is not the solution at all

For fans like myself what MGM should have done is add some new extras to the films
either a Directors commentary, or a new making of featurette with Chuck norris
 with some of the films or one or 2 of the films in this new keepcase collection, but no
MGM just decided to do a reissue of the films in different packaging which i think is pointless, waste of money.

LONE WOLF MCQUADE, MISSING IN ACTION, CODE OF SILENCE, & THE DELTA FORCE
are the Chuck norris films being re-issued here in a clamshell keepcase with Disc trays
again no new featurettes, no new interview chuck norris at least
just another re-issue that's all,  an insult from MGM i think
these classic chuck norris films deserve more respect, at least a new interview with chuck norris would be Good
he could give fans his recollections on his experience making the films
but MGM could not be bothered otherwise there would be new extras

these 4 films are exactly the same as the previous blu-ray versions
which are still available to buy Individually on amazon.com anyway
from a Direct amazon listing for $10-$11 each anyway

so this new keepcase with Disc trays i think is total waste of money
Don't bother buying it, i gave it 1 star, a Disgusting effort from MGM",1413331200,,1612,4.52233676975945

6597521,5,B00MP2FQ0U,"Overall these films round up a majority of Chuck's uhh ""good"" films. Missing in Action and The Delta Force are Cannon Films, which means they have ridiculous amounts of violence, with an awkwardly handled political message. They are good for a laugh, though Delta Force plays it pretty dramatic for the first half, before completely losing its mind. Code of Silence tries to pull off a more serious cop drama, and for the most part succeeds before slipping back into all out violence. Lone Wolf McQuade is what Walker Texas Ranger should have been; a rebellious and trigger happy Ranger who beats people senseless while drinking a case of beer a day.

If you are buying this because you think it will be wholesome family fun with a positive message about friendship, faith and patriotism, just re-watch Walker Texas Ranger on TV Land. This set is exploits and endorses violence, and kills brain cells! Which is a good thing..",1426550400,31,925,4.817610062893082
6597522,5,B00MP2FQ0U,GOOD PRODUCT,1419292800,,12,5.5
6597523,5,B00MP2FQ0U,"As I write this, the wallet- and space-saving CHUCK NORRIS ATTACK PACK 4-disc set has just one non-review attached to its Amazon listing, from a disgruntled customer who purchased some quantity of the prior individual Blu-Ray releases of these titles, then was shocked and disgusted that ""MGM""--which has little to do with its own catalogue anymore--didn't reward him with special editions instead of simply repackaging the discs for those who perhaps couldn't afford the single editions the first time around, or for newcomers looking for a cheap way to bliss out on Mr. Norris' 80's goodness. How DARE they?!?

So, while ""Ben30"" was more than happy to assign a four-star rating to the individual BD release of DELTA FORCE, when the exact same disc is repackaged here with THREE ADDITIONAL CHUCK NORRIS discs, he deems the whole thing worthy of only one star. Because he didn't get what he wanted from MGM. Umm, yeah . . .

Anyway, in the real world, where FOX is the actual distributor of most of the MGM catalogue at this point, and where companies like Shout! or Twilight Time have yet to grace us with Special Editions of these titles, and may never, we're forced to suffer the apparent indignity of buying this FANTASTIC four-pack of some of Norris' most high-profile 80's productions, all presented in solid high definition, in their original aspect ratios and with mono DTS HD master audio on LONE WOLF McQUADE, MISSING IN ACTION and CODE OF SILENCE, and stereo DTS HD master audio on THE DELTA FORCE.

No Chuck Norris ""making of""  featurettes

No Chuck Norris interviews.

No Chuck Norris bloopers.

Just the movies, which have withstood the test of time better than you might think, and theatrical trailers for each feature. Considering Chuck Norris couldn't even be nailed down to participate in ELECTRIC BOOGALOO, Aussie Mark Hartley's phenomenal 2014 documentary ode to Cannon Pictures (look it up, then IMMEDIATELY run out and see it!) and considering his advancing years, it's unlikely we'll ever see the man sitting down to wax nostalgic over his cinematic oeuvre, so unless Shout! Factory--by far the most likely candidate to procure and release these pictures as BD special editions--knows something they're not telling us, this set will just have to do. Oh, the humanity!

And believe me, as a verified Amazon buyer, I can tell you it's well worth every penny, ESPECIALLY if you can find it for around $10, which is actually the going rate for this set at various retailers, though sadly not Amazon.

Further to this, I'd point parties interested in 80's B-movie nirvana in the direction of the CHARLES BRONSON TRIPLE THREAT COLLECTION (which repackages previously-released, gorgeous Blu-Rays of DEATH WISH 2, 3 and 4, plus trailers for each) as well as the JEAN CLAUDE VAN DAMME FAVORITES triple feature set (which likewise re-bundles extant BDs of CYBORG, DEATH WARRANT and the legendary DOUBLE IMPACT). Like the Norris set, these shelf-saving collections can be found for as little as TEN BUCKS if you keep your eyes peeled.

So, you can moan about what this set ISN'T, as did the ""disgusted"" customer who first attempted to skew the star rating of this product in a feeble effort to shame ""MGM"" into bending to his will, or you can fork over a lousy ten spot and get a good SEVEN HOURS of Chuck Norris forcing your television to surrender to his sheer willpower.

The choice is yours, friends.",1418601600,16,3416,4.902946273830156
