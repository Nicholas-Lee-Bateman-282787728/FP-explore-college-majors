7938893,4,B00005JJRX,"I am a teacher, and I bought this video to share with my classes as part of a unit on tolerance for prejudice. I am fascinated by Anna Deveare Smith's capability to fully portray each character, down to the voice and facial expressions. It takes a few minutes to adjust to her style, but after a while you forget you are watching the same person. I was nervous about how my students would take to something non-Hollywood, but because this is a documentary-style performance based on true events, they were drawn in to the human element, and many curiously followed the story all the way to its conclusion.",1237161600,,605,4.611111111111111
7938894,5,B00005JJRX,"Wow. That was my initial reaction upon first viewing this  film. And remains so. Conceived , written by, and starring Anna Devere Smith, this one woman show of the events surrounding the Rodney King verdict, and the riots that followed, is a must see. It is not only an  artistic achievement, but an incredibly moving and effective social commentary. She creates brilliant portrayals of different characters, with varying observations of the destruction around them. The fact that Anna Deavere Smith not only wrote this , but acts it out, is a revelation. I have seen Miss Smith in several supporting roles, and thought she had a commanding presence, but this truly shows what a wonderfully talented artist she is. A powerful testament to the possibilities of what just one person can create, given the opportunities which everyone deserves. Not to be missed.",1026259200,7,859,5.042253521126761
7938895,5,B00005JJRX,"This video is fantastic. Anna Deavere Smith does an incredible job at playing so many characters realistically that you won't believe your eyes. Of course, the social and political statements in the film are very important, but watching her bring these characters to life is worth every moment.",1006646400,3,294,5.145833333333333
7938896,5,B00005JJRX,"I was first exposed to this book in the classroom and have since read and read it many times.  The form of the book creates a new genre in literary representation by capturing the essence of each character's idiosyncratic voice.  This video is a condensed version of the dramatic play.  The first time that you see it, you will realize the sheer brillance of Smith's ability; not only has she written a great drama but she has the skill of a virtuosa on the stage, bringing the voices within the play to vivid life.  I cannot stress how important this play/ book is in terms of our American identities.  It is complex and intense; it provides us with the opportunity of seeing ourselves from the outside without ever reducing the multiplicity of us all.",990748800,8,753,4.58955223880597
