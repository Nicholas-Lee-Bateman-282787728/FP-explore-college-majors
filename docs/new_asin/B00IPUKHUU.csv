Thank you.",1402963200,,123,4.857142857142857

8644580,5,B00IPUKHUU,"It was informative and interesting and came at such an amazing time:  right before the Canonization!
Most of what was said about him on TV had been covered by this DVD.",1402185600,2,168,4.419354838709677
8644581,5,B00IPUKHUU,"Considering the impending canonization of Pope John XXIII, this 36 minute documentary, hosted by Fr. Mitch Pacwa S.J. of EWTN and Prof. James Hitchcock of St. Louis University is welcome and indeed necessary, in understanding the person of Pope John XXII and separating the man from the myth.
In a scholarly, dexterous and yet interesting way, these two gentlemen take us on a journey to meet this controversial figure, from his early days as a boy from a village in northern Italy to his ascending the throne of St. Peter. His character, personality and intellect is laid bare to us, so much so at the end of this short documentary one will have a whole different perspective of this Pope.
Initially I thought that this was to be a dull documentary and that my money was wasted. I was pleasantly surprised by its ability to garner my interest and this is enhanced by black and white movie clips of the Pope during his pontificate, the Vatican II council and photos of himself.
We are also given insights into the council and the role certain element/s had in purposely conveying a falsified message that has erroneously made this man a darling to certain groups and being vilified as a demon by others.

Please take note that this documentary does not cover every aspect of his life but is a sort of a summary overview, which covers the more important aspects.

For those of us who do not approve of Pope John's canonization or have been tempted to think ill of him or his legacy, let the scripture passages below serve as a meditation and a prayer aid.

""For my thoughts are not your thoughts: nor your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are exalted above the earth, so are my ways exalted above your ways, and my thoughts above your thoughts."" Isaiah 55, 8-9.

or again

""For who among men is he that can know the counsel of God? or who can think what the will of God is?: Wisdom 9,13

As mentioned earlier this documentary is 36 minutes long, in English with NO subtitles. The only added special feature is a trailer from the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-XXIII/dp/B001EPKKV4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John XXIII</a>, which is a good and interesting dramatized biopic on his life.

This DVD will serve to make us think, revisit and re-evaluate a very misunderstood man, who is today God's saint.

St. John XXIII, pray for us!",1397433600,9,2400,4.836585365853659
