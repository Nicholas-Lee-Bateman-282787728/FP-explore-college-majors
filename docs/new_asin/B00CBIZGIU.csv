5711587,1,B00CBIZGIU,"Worst movie I ever seen. Very incomplete or pointless!! Ending didn't make sense, and some story lines didn't fit into original story. I wasted money renting this movie from the video store.",1373328000,,190,4.96875
5711588,1,B00CBIZGIU,"This movie has no recognizable story line. The movie starts with three African-American men congregating at a radio station and three African-American women drinking and getting high in a living room. The women are paired with the men; one married couple and two couples that are dating. This is one of the first significant scenes. The men eavesdrops on the women's conversation and find out things about their mates that they did not anticipate. It leads to a very heated exchange between Tracy and Jay where he pulls a gun on her and aims it at her head, point blank. The way they treat that particular scene so nonchalantly boggles my mind. Is this a common event in the singles dating scene now?

The movie deteriorates very quickly because it seems the story dies there. The rest of the movie is filmed in a gym with the introduction of random characters. There is no apparent story line.

This movie was just a waste of time!",1372550400,6,932,4.642424242424243
5711589,2,B00CBIZGIU,"Jay (Christopher Howard) is in the entertainment industry. He has a medical condition he keeps from his girlfriend Tracey (Ebony J Lewis) as he is ready to pop the question. His friend Don (Ron Bruce) is trying to fix him up with other girls, which Jay to his credit, refuses. Meanwhile Tracey has a baby secret she is keeping from Jay. The film moves forward with the expected and formulaic twist. Up until that point, the production was pretty good. After the twist, and our happy couple goes separate ways, the film dies as we watch their uneventful lives at the gym.

The acting was alright, the plot was decent until it fell off a cliff. A film you can turn off after 25 minutes and you won't miss anything.

Parental Guidance: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1371254400,8,758,4.525547445255475

I like to think that everyone tries their best but it's hard for me to feel that way about this ""film"". I mean if you really want to produce a movie or write a script then try at least reading one book on the subject or I don't know...watching a movie? May be a couple of spoilers ahead: The only thing I liked about this film (I didn't finish the movie by the way) Is the part where the men were listening outside of the door to the women. I think that was actually a good little element to add into the movie. It would have just been nice that if after this moment there was a little more tension and what not rather than the main character just confronting the girl right away.",1461801600,,783,4.157894736842105

5711658,1,B00CBIZGIU,"This movie glorifies the worst in everything with no other purpose or goal other than to point it out. It is wrought with random acts of unforgivable betrayals, that after they are found out there is no logical, or otherwise resolution for them.

The plot took a while to develop and just never materialized... and the ending... SMH..

the movie ended with no conclusion. SMH... I commented 1.5 hours of my time to watch this and it doesn't even have a legitimate conclusion. It just cuts off and rolls to credits... Why..

people should watch this movie as a testament as to how not to make a movie.",1455667200,5,625,4.235294117647059

As a movie fanatic it is rare that I find a series/movie where I cannot tell where the storyline is going but with this show I was pleasantly surprised. In Defense of the mediocre story writing, this is this woman's FIRST TV series that she has released to the public. Please support her in her journey and give this show a chance! If you are still a bit unsure, the first few episodes are available to watch on Youtube then you can make you decision to buy the DVD after that.",1376092800,,646,4.30327868852459
