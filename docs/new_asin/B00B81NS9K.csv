And that's part of its charm and fun. This is a underdog film with a lot of heart. This movie oozes love for the 80's splatter films and pays homage in ways that come out of left field. It has its flaws, as would any DIY film, but where most of its contemporaries fail, Mold! succeeds with honors. Go in expecting an updated DIY version of Street Trash or The Stuff and you won't be disappointed. Go in expecting a glossy Hollywood shocker then you're just too st*pid to know any better anyway.",1398384000,,644,4.330578512396694

8563908,5,B00B81NS9K,"This is campy fun the way it should be.  I bought this over a year ago from Forbidden Planet in NYC when it was being sold as a DIY DVD.  It was a what the hell purchase because, well, what the hell.  It was there, it sounded cool, the cover art was pretty damn impressive and it was a reasonable price.  I wasn't expecting much honestly, and boy was I surprised.  It's a damn good time with the right amount of overacting you expect from a film like this.  The story was cheesy, but it was the right amount of cheese.  It just balanced it all out perfectly, and it's a great way to kill an hour and a half.

I can't talk about the quality of the DVD by Wild Eye Releasing because my copy is a DVD-R produced by the director for sale at the comic shop.  If it's like any of the other Wild Eye Releasing DVDs, it will be of quality (whether the movie is good or not),  But I can say this, you won't be disappointed in this film when you purchase it.",1382572800,,948,3.99468085106383
8563909,4,B00B81NS9K,"The 80s were a truly special decade for me; I was born in '74, so I was a true teen in the 80s and thus got to experience a lot of groundbreaking firsts in the movie industry.  The rise of the slasher flick, the splatter-fest obsession and Cold War conspiracy movies were just a few of these milestones.  MOLD is a fun throwback to 80s horror that gives homage to splatter and the cruel Cold War mentality.  Chocked full of gore (sorta), quirky humor, and outrageous characters, this is one movie that you'll have to see to believe.

First of all, you have to go into this movie with the proper knowledge of what to expect.  This is a lower-budget, tongue-in-cheek masterpiece that doesn't take itself very seriously.  If you start watching MOLD with any other ideology in mind, you are probably not going to like it.

With that being said, this is one excellent movie that can take you on a helluva ride if you'll let it.  The film pulls no punches when it comes to cheekiness, and it definitely knows what it is:  dark humor mixed with political satire amidst a horror backdrop.  How can you not be interested?

MOLD is shot well overall and the script is not half-bad.  The acting is actually not too bad either, although I feel like a couple of characters might have over-played their parts a bit too much.  I'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but I sorta got annoyed with it about 3/4 of the way through.  Still, it's nothing that truly detracts from the overall films itself, though.

The special effects are excellent, with lots of mold-covered, vomit-blasting fun.  If you like `melting' humans, explosive puke and face-eating antidotes, you're going to love this film.  I'm not sure how big of a budget the special effects team had to work with, but it appears they used it very wisely.

MOLD might not be for everyone, but I loved it, and I recommend checking it out if you like 80s throwbacks and/or splatter flicks.  It's hokey, but in a good way.  And if you watch it, be sure and stay for the credits...there's more to see.  I give this one two thumbs up...but just so long as my thumbs don't succumb to the titular growth!",1369180800,3,2145,4.4909560723514215
