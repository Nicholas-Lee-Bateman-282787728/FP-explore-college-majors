2901408,5,B000TJ6P88,This movie was for my daughter and she loved it. It is a cute movie and the movie was new and in great shape!,1356825600,2,109,3.5833333333333335
2901409,4,B000TJ6P88,"Christmas movies never get old for me, and Santa Trap is no exception to that rule. That being said, I will tell you that the wonderful cast is burdened by a less than stellar script. I also found the jumping in scenes to be sometimes poorly timed. However, if you are looking for a an uplifting family film for the holiday season that is fun and inoffensive, you would not go wrong with Santa Trap. And, of course, in the end we discover that there really is a Santa.

But, didn't we know that all along?",1353283200,,505,4.260416666666667
2901410,5,B000TJ6P88,A great family movie.  We enjoyed watching it with our granddaughter.  Our original copy was damaged so we purchased this copy to replace it.,1337299200,,141,4.833333333333333
2901411,2,B000TJ6P88,"Looking at the cast of actors one would think a good movie was in the offering. I knew Shelley Long wasn't a very good actress but I hoped the rest could pull this movie through.
The basic idea for the movie is pretty cool: Santa is captured by a little girl (Judy Emerson played by Sierra Abel who is just a dreadful actress) and hauled off to jail by the local Keystone cops. OK, OK, it's a little hokey I know but I thought it had potential.
The dialogue was just awful. Everyone, including the good actors spoke in monotone and appeared to be reading their lines off cue cards. The camerawork was average with several occasions of un-centered characters and shifting too soon. Scenes in the beginning of the movie were shifting faster than a NFL quarterback running from Ray Lewis.
Other than these complaints the movie was fine.",1293408000,,833,4.56
2901412,5,B000TJ6P88,Very cute movie I really liked it it's like the Parent Trap only this time it's the Santa Trap. I love christmas movies and wanted to add this one great for the whole family to sit and watch and laugh I had read aboout it on Amazon and went looking for it but couldn't find it so I went back to Amazon and got it it's a fun movie for Christmas. Totally enjoyable.,1264636800,3,363,3.9863013698630136
2901413,5,B000TJ6P88,"Love Christmas, great addition to my collection",1264550400,,47,5.857142857142857
2901414,4,B000TJ6P88,"Released in 2002, The Santa Trap has an easily recognizable cast - Shelley Long, Robert Hayes, Corbin Bernsen, Dick Van Patten, Stacey Keach and Adrienne Barbeau.  All are terrific actors, and given a better script this movie would be vastly improved, but that said, it is still a good movie. It was particularly entertaining to see Stacey Keach as an aging biker dude.

As with most Christmas movies, the viewer must suspend disbelief, and this is no exception. Santa, Dick Van Patten pays a visit to a family newly moved to Los Angeles (Long, Hayes and their two children) and they are in need of some Christmas spirit. Through a series of missteps Santa is first arrested, then while incarcerated his cell mate (Keach) switches clothes with him and is bailed out. Meanwhile, after the reindeer returned without him, the elves are searching for Santa. One improbable event happens after another, but it is all harmless and turns out just fine in the end.  This is a lightweight Christmas movie with an interesting cast.  For those with small children, please note that the son tells the young daughter that there is no Santa Claus. Santa does appear and the family ends up believing in his existence.",1258761600,8,1202,4.820388349514563
2901415,5,B000TJ6P88,I am a big kid at heart.  So every Christmas I make it my business to watch this movie on T.V.  Now that I have it I can have Christmas all year long. It is a wonderful movie to sit down and watch with your children.,1258761600,5,216,3.6739130434782608

2901444,3,B000TJ6P88,"I give this one 3 stars ONLY because it's not my favorite kind of Christmas movie.  What it does it does very well.  I miss snow during November & December so the mention of 92 degree temperatures (the movie is set in very sunny California) is enough to make me cringe.  The humor is not really my cup of tea either, but it too is well done.
  It is a nicely done movie for kids and those who like a story where adults don't seem to get anything right and Christmas (and Santa) have to be saved by kids who are simply wiser and able to handle those foolish adults and especially the town sheriff who has Santa locked up.  There are some good things in it and the story is not bad, just not my favorite kind of movie.",1418169600,,716,4.078571428571428

2901447,5,B000TJ6P88,I bought The Santa Trap years ago for my now 10 year old grandson. He loves this movie and has watched it so many times that I decided to get him his own copy. Maybe he can share it with his children.,1389225600,2,200,3.7857142857142856
2901448,1,B000TJ6P88,"I'd say bad plot, but there wasn't any.  Bad acting, no continuity.  I wouldn't recommend anybody waster their time on this one.  It took me three times to get through it.  I'd watch 20 minutes and say I'll get back to this when I have nothing better to do.  I kept hoping it would get better, considering some of the actors have been involved in some pretty good projects.  How they got roped into being seen in this thing boggles my mind.

Santa Trap is a little more uplifting to watch.
I give 12 Days a D- and Santa Trap a B grade. I wish I could
cut the dvd in half--I am not happy with 12 Days of Christmas Eve!!!!
Of all the dvds I have purchased on Amazon--the worst movie!  I only want
""Kosher"" uplifting dvds in my personal library. I prefer to have Santa Trap
by itself. Igive Santa Trap a 3 star review.",1506297600,,429,4.107142857142857
