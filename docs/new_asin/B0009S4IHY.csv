2315173,3,B0009S4IHY,"Interesting movie.

You've got slaptstick Keystone cops like comedy, impressive serious kung fu fighting, some brutal violence, special effects -good and bad and a cute mute ice cream seller with a lollipop. It seems though that this movie doesnt know what type of movie it wants to be. I think this is what made me keep watching it as I wanted to see what film genre it would next try to be.

Quality of the DVD was good both sound and picture. As far as the story goes, it was a little loose but generally kung fu movies aren't known for their quality plots and executions anyway so I wasn't expecting much anyway.

Overall entertaining, at least on the first watch.",1112227200,3,668,4.5041322314049586
2315174,4,B0009S4IHY,"This is a comedic Kung Fu movie with some flying / air fighting elements in it, as well as comic book style fighting. There is also what appears to be CG special effects.

Although I don't usually like movies with flying style moves (save The Iron Monkey), this movie is actually a decent mix of choreographed ground moves, air moves, and comic book style moves. They did a very good job in blending the moves together seemlessly.

As far as the plot goes, it is fairly well done. You don't really know for sure what's going on at first, although there are plent of hints, but eventually about half way through the plot you'll figure out what's going to happen at the end. As I stated earlier, this is a comedy, and the jokes are pretty funny, at least to my immature self.

End note: I viewed the chinese DVD of this movie -> only cantonese and manderin audio with english subtitles. I'm guessing the english version differs only in the audio track.",1110844800,4,950,4.479768786127168
2315175,5,B0009S4IHY,"Stephen Chow's follow-up to 'Shaolin Soccer' (which was virtually killed in US market) is totally different from 'Shaolin.'  'Kung-hu' is a comedy, sure it is, but the star/director Chow takes this martial arts very seriously, and the film itself gives more emphasis upon martial arts actions (including silly ones) than the parodies or sight gags.  And look, the film is credited with TWO choreographers -- Sammo Hung and Yuen Wo Ping!

[THE STORY] is set in pre-Revolutiona China.  The city is ruled by ruthless mobsters 'Axe Gang,' and now remember, they are really ruthless.  Even though they dance like 'Cotton Club'-Meets-'Gangs of New York' style.  And of course, they wield axes while dancing in the street.

Then our hero Sing (Chow) enters.  He wants to join in the 'Axe Gangs,' and to prove his 'ability' as gangster (whatever it is), he tries to extort money from the locals living in the 'Pig Sty Alley.'  What he didn't know was, the people are much, much more strong and resourceful than he expected.

The plot may sound rather pointless, and in fact it is.  In short, it is about two wannabe gangsters, and the fights between gangsters and the residents of the 'Alley.'  You see several references to other films, but the film's greatest merit is not them.  It is kung-hu action.

[ACTIONS] For Stephen Chow shows unexpectedly exciting fight sequences between the unique characters -- assassins who use musical instruments like invisible swords (and this scene is very violent), the tailor and cook who fight like devil, the Landlord and Landlady, and The Beast ... yes, he fight like a beast, or a toad (literally).

[THE STAR] Stephen Chow as hero Sing displays considerable martial arts skills, especially in the finaly act which goes like the climax of 'Matrix Revolutions' -- and Chow is better than Keanu! -- but it is the extraordinary supporting actors that really are rivetting.  The hen-pecked landlord by Yuen Wah (known as 'magnificient villain' in Hong Kong films) and his chain-smoking wife landlady by Yuen Qiu (coming back to screen after almost 30 years) are real scene stealer, always surprising us with their outrageous personalities.  And wait for 'The Beast' by Leung Siu Lung (himself a major Kung-hu star during the 70s, and comes back to movie after 15 year hietus) whose initial appearance as a bald and plump middle-aged is very deceptive.  And look for Yeun Cheung-Yan (as a suspicious-looking seller of 'kung-hu manuals'), brother to Yuen Woo Ping and action choreographer of 'Charlie's Angles.'

The film may not as funny (and silly) as 'Shaolin Soccer' and if so, that's because Stephen Chow really respects the art of kung-hu and its masters.  It is still a comedy, and it is often funny, but perhaps you should see it as an action film -- with ridiculously exaggerated fight styles based on the traditional kung-hu.  So, my advice: Don't think, just feel, and enjoy yourself.",1108944000,100,2923,4.948770491803279

Recently, it seems, the networks are only showing the original version with subtitles.  I was happy to find this version on Amazon and within the disc's features there is an option for the English dubbed version.

The kung fu fighting in this movie is so beautifully choreographed that it is comparable to Crouching Tiger, but the storyline is so funny that it created its own category similar to what Kill Bill has accomplished.

The con-artist connect and form an alliance with the real hoodlums. To save face, the ""Ax Gang"" come in force to the neighborhood. Only, the neighborhood residents are populated with kung fu masters!

When we turned the movie on its in Mandarin & you can not adjust the settings to hear it in english!

Overall a great movie.,1478563200,,367,4.388059701492537
2315514,5,B0009S4IHY,In my top five movies. At first glance it is a comedy but it is really a way to address many touchy subjects in China. Watch it in Chinese with subtitles for the real dialog and experience - you'll remember it in English anyway.,1478563200,,228,4.204545454545454

Really...LOL.  It just pays homage to the feeling of wanting them to be a SUPERHERO.  These incredible fight scenes.  Bad guys, Good Guys.  Is that guy supposed to be a bad guy?

We all wish something would change our lives and turn us into superheroes.  We all love the wacky flying and moves and hidden weapons of Kung Fu movie genres.  This is so amusing.  Watch it and see.

No, no one has actual movies like Bruce Lee, Jet Li, or even Jackie Chan.  They do have old masters though...guys who in their day could do the same moves those first 3 i named could.  These guys are just lesser known.

2316180,5,B0009S4IHY,"I first watched Kung Fu Hustle in theaters when it came out, with a whopping 3 other people in the theater on opening weekend. Back then, I didn't know what the heck I was watching. One minute it was serious, with this opening scene showing how fearful the Axe Gang is, then wed get one character running around like Wile E. Coyote, complete with rotating legs. Coming out of the theater, I didn't know how I felt about it. It wasn't until I watched it again on dvd a few months later that I finally got it, and Kung Fu Hustle has since been one of my favorite movies ever. It may be on the weird side, but theres something for everyone here. Ive watched the movie with many people over the years, with a lot of them not being big on martial arts movies. You know what? They loved it. It had been a while since I saw the movie, so I watched it again recently, and Im happy to say that it definitely still holds up for the most part.

The movie opens showing us the dreaded Axe Gang, who rules over the city with an iron fist. Other gangs fear them, and even the police have to do what they say if they want to survive. Two bumbling would-be Axe Gang members, Sing and his chubby friend, waltz into Pig Sty Alley one day, claiming to be members of the gang, and try to blackmail their way out of paying for a haircut. Things go sour fast, and the residents of the lower class apartments won't have it. Luckily for Sing, the real Axe Gang shows up, and they start a huge fight with several martial arts masters in the building. They clear out the Axe Gang, but are banished for fear of brining more danger to the area. Meanwhile, Sing needs to prove himself if he wants to be a real member, and is sent out to find The Beast- a man who became so obsessed with fighting, that he was put in an insane asylum.

The plot may be a little cluttered, but trust me- it works. Its best not to take the movie too seriously, even with the dramatic bits, as it flows better once you do so. There are some truly touching moments here and there, including someone from Sings past, yet Stephen Chow never pushes it too far. Kung Fu Hustle is all about great fights and good laughs. Every time I watch it, I notice something new, even during the fight scenes. The opening fight is great, and every one that comes after it manages to be just as exciting. Theres one key fight scene where two characters utilize a guqin (think of it as a harp that lays down) to deliver attacks, and combined with the music they make while attacking, it makes for something youll never forget. All of the characters are memorable as well. From a tailor who fights using the rings on his clothes hanging poles to a baker that fights with various sticks in his bakery, to a hard working man with lethal kicks to a landlady you wouldnt wish upon your worst enemy. I absolutely -love- the characters in this movie! And I know I sound like a complete fanboy at this point, so it shouldnt be a surprise that I love the soundtrack too. Originally, Stephen Chow was going to go with a more hip hop oriented soundtrack. Instead, he went with more traditional instruments, and Im very glad he did. Not because I don't like hip hop, but because some of the pieces here really set the tone of the fights. Look up Blade of Guqin, Decree of the Sichuan General, Fishermans Song of the East China Sea and Zhi Yao Wei Ni Huo Yi Tian. Theyre masterpieces.

Honestly, the only downside to the movie is the CG. The CG special effects weren't passable when the movie came out, and watching some of them now is embarrassing. The first one that comes to mind is when one character is bitten on the lips by a snake. Its not all bad, maybe around 70%. Its not enough to bring the movies score down, its just a little bothersome when watching it, knowing that some movies with even lower budgets in this day and age look a lot better than some of the things here.

Its worth mentioning that the Axe Kickin Edition DVD is still the only uncensored version of the movie, with slightly more blood in one key scene, and something else uncensored on a floor (take a guess). It was kind of disappointing to see that the blu-ray version is the same as the original dvd release, but its no big deal. The extra blood never added anything anyway. I also have to point out that the subtitles here are better than the original DVDs. All the special features are included, with my favorite being the commentary track with Chow and several others. Its subtitled, and they talk about lots of things regarding the movie, as well as regular stuff, like trying to decide on a place to go for lunch after they're done recording.

If you're looking for a martial arts movie thats different from anything else out there, Kung Fu Hustle is all you need. Its one of the few movies Ive seen where Im constantly thinking about the fight scenes and different characters on a weekly basis. I cant wait to see what Chow does with the sequel when he finally gets around to it.",1410998400,,4985,4.321581196581197

2316218,5,B0009S4IHY,"The coolest kung fu thriller ever devised. An instant classic. Stephen Chow's comedy genius gets its best platform here. I especially love how all the legends and secrets of kung fu are sprinkled into the story. You can learn some culture when watching a Stephen Chow movie, even though the presentation is certainly more surface than in any serious depth (for that, read a book!). Otherwise, entertainment value is ginormous here. And it's relatively safe for children depsite some comic book style violence, so use discretion regarding age-appropriateness and sensitivity all the same.",1407024000,,587,5.32258064516129

No, but it is funny, it has plot turns and Stephen Chow is a hoot as our wayward hero.  I had the movie on DVD and liked it so well I bought it on Blue Ray.  I didn't think it could be done, but it is even better on Blue Ray.

I was so pleasantly surprised and thrilled from the very beginning that I could actually feel the shift in my mood.

2316402,5,B0009S4IHY,"At first glance `Kung Fu Hustle' seems to be just another very well done Kung Fu movie from China on the order of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon & Co... and the plethora of first class Jet Li action martial art movies.  The fight scenes in Hustle are every bit as good as any of those movies, but it has a plot unlike any of those movies.  A plot, in my opinion that is BETTER than any of those movies.

Yes, `Hustle' is funny, an amazing accomplishment across the usually insurmountable language and cultural barriers between China and the West (which made Bruce Lee's movies unintentionally funny at the wrong times and for the wrong reasons, and made intended funny scenes fall flat with Western audiences), but also a movie with a great historical message.  The unwitting viewer is receiving a history lesson while being entertained by great plot and action sequences.  This is because the Axe Gang in the movie is a fictional (and often befuddled) derivation of a very real Chinese historical reality.  The movie is greatly entertaining without being even a tiny bit preachy...just your basic Good vs. Evil with a unique twist, plus a great romance to boot!

During the first half of the 20th Century, China was run by corrupt regional business magnates, often romanticized as ""warlords"", who headed regional criminal business syndicates, often deceptively described as mere ""gangs"".  These various ""gangs"" relied on enforcers to enforce their monopolistic and criminal will, the most famous of which were the so-call Axe Men, from which we get our modern terms ""Hatchet Men"" and ""Hatchet Job"".  In fact, China's leader before Mao was Chiang Kai Shek, a former member of one these criminal gangs who was regrettably backed by the United States.  The evil that characterized the criminal gangs of pre-Mao China is symbolized in the movie by the perfectly named ""The Beast"", the world's most prolific and psychopathic killer, who symbolizes the gangster-for-hire killers/enforcers of China, a symbolization that is characteristic of criminal syndicates (what Mussolini admirably and accurately termed ""corporations"", or corporati).  Sing, the unlikely hero fantastically played by Stephen Chow, becomes transformed during the course of the movie as the embodiment of Good.

Kung Fu Hustle was one of the few movies I've seen that was so damn good I had to watch it several times in a row.",1377561600,,2391,5.040609137055838

Recommended by a friend and I thought this might be just a guys movie but my wife watched it and said it's about as generally entertaining as a movie can get, because if its comedy, romance, drama and action.
Wong Kar Wai meets Harold and Kumar? Crouching Tiger, Mr. Bean? Anyway, give it a shot, if you like comedy and you can appreciate Kung Fu themes, you'll like it. Note: not for kids, as it approaches very intense, though stylized, violence.",1368662400,,840,4.532894736842105

Unlike most people I don't think Stephen Chow is a genius, but he is smart. This film has a mix of comedy, adventure, crime caper and martial arts action. Most notably is some nice fight choreography ssections, But Chow takes from fight scenes of Kill Bill vol. 1, Fearless, The Matrix, Hero etc. He also mixes up some cheap special effects at the very end. I however am bias with the inclusion of some real Kung Fu Masters who play themselves by their styles.

2316497,5,B0009S4IHY,"This movie is one of the best martial arts movies I have ever seen. The reason it is so exemplary is because of the inverted themes with the hero of the story. The protagonist isn't heroic or humble or kind or even competent, he's a street thief who's trying to get into the violent and ruthless axe gang.

We find out that he tried to be a hero and wanted to be one as a child, spent his life savings on an ancient manual and attempted to defend a girl against bullies. He was beaten down and humiliated, everything he knew crushed, and then was show kindness by the person he was trying to protect, making him weaker than she was, in his mind. Rejecting his nature, he became what he previously hated, what he previously wanted to destroy.

The main focus of the story is him, but also the town-village and how they all relate to the axe gang. The plot of this follows typical martial arts plots, paying favors to the martial arts cinema heroes of older martial arts films and the escalating and stylish battles there-in. All the fighting is beautiful and while it tends to be referenced to other works, it still completely owns them and makes them their own.

It is in the final fight of the village and the axe gang that we see just who the protagonist truly is. It is in that powerful moment that this movie is something more than generic, something better than traditional, and something closer to magical. The way he changes, his final acts in that scenes, and the conclusion of the girl he tried to save so long ago and the fate he reject so long ago, end up in a cathartic moment rarely rivaled in any other cinema, let alone kung-fu movies.",1362960000,6,1650,4.38562091503268

2316573,5,B0009S4IHY,"I'm not a huge fan of martial arts movies and had no idea what to expect when I first saw this film. But it wouldn't have made any difference, because the first choreographed scene of the ""ax gang"" swinging their wares would have shattered any amount of preconception.

The hero, Sing, is a disappointed young man who wanted to be...well...a hero. But when his younger self purchased a pamphlet promising the ultimate secret in martial arts it took almost no time at all to get his butt kicked half way to America. Now he's living in squalor, committing petty crimes, and longing to pass the initiation and join the powerful Ax Gang.

But poor Sing's heart isn't in it and every time he tries to do something bad he gets his butt kicked again. Against this backdrop, an increasingly powerful, exotic, and inventive array of martial artists line up on either side of the escalating tension between the Axe gang and Sing's slum.

Kung Fu Hustle is full of twists and turns, witty satire on martial arts movie, and amazing special effects. But it's the human story of a young man's search for redemption that won my heart and gives the DVD pride of place on my shelf.",1340668800,,1164,4.586538461538462

2316576,5,B0009S4IHY,"Stephen Chow is a true performer and entertainer, out of all the actors ive seen, from old black and white films and all the way to today, only a few people are truly special. And Stephen Chow is one of those few joining a list of geniuses of cinema history.

Kung Fu Hustle is a showcase of the sheer potential this man has. I loved the characters, and over the top story. A great use of imagination here. Only limited by its budget, which is nowhere near that of whats produced in hollywood, but give Chow a license to create a priceless epic, and he will inspire the world.

This film though is mainly advertised as a comedy....but its oh so much more than that. Chow is clearly influenced by the great showman ship and scope of the great musicals and love storys of classic hollywood, along with classic chinese theater. Its a brilliant film in terms of its vision and plays out very well.

The audience should be encouraged to use some imagination and keep an open heart while watching this, because its truly a fine piece of work from Stephen Chow, if not his best yet.

I loved his earlier work like ""King Of Comedy"", but those were super low budget. But now it seems Chow has payed his dues in Asian cinema and is now getting higher budget allowance to really try to realize his dream on film.

I would say that if you love film, and all that moving pictures offer, then i highly recommend this fantastic film thats filled with laughs, love, some epic moments even, and some unique style of camera work and presentation.
Stephen Chow's world is like a dream come true. Action packed, hilarious, lovable , inspiring and even powerful.

2316606,5,B0009S4IHY,"I've always been a fan of Stephen Chow and his uniquely quirky sense of humour and I had watched his earlier films like the ""God of Cookery"" for example and his secret agent spoof but his films always seemed to start and develop well but to always have lame endings in addition to being rather shallow and one-dimensional at times.  That is until this great film which balances the same comedy with a very good story of redemption and of how two ""losers"" finally make it good.

In ""Kung Fu Hustle"" we finally get a very good Stephen Chow ending which never fails to bring a tear to my eye each time I watch it.  This is why this film has now become my favourite movie of his and this Blu-ray release doesn't disappoint.  The picture and sound quality is very good and has to be watched in the original Cantonese with English subtitles if necessary to truly appreciate this.  The special features are really nothing to crow about if you are into these extras but for me I'm not too fussed about these and the interview for instance was quite pathetic here with the condescending tone and stupid questions of the interviewer clearly frustrating Stephen Chow who looks like he'd rather be having a root canal than to have to endure it.

As for the movie itself it was the usual brand of Stephen Chow comedy where he intersperses spoofs of various western movies with madcap/slapstick comedy and we clearly get allusions to ""The Matrix"" even to the point of him being called ""the One"" like Neo at the end when he finally achieves his full potential.  We even get a spoof of Kubrick's ""The Shining"" in one scene when he helps the Beast to escape not to mention the reference to the Roadrunner cartoons when he is running away from the landlady etc.  What makes this rise above the usual Stephen Chow outing is the great other story within the story with the flashbacks explaining why the Chow character behaves the way he does as an adult and how he finally finds redemption.

This is an excellent Stephen Chow film and it is in my opinion his best to date and this blu-ray version is a real treat with its excellent picture and sound quality when viewed in the original language.

I love old skool kung fu movies with the terrible acting but good coordinated fight scenes but I also love the newer more visual effects movies such as Ninja Assasin. Kung Fu hustle is a pretty good kung fu movie with a little added twist of humor here and there. The plot is pretty good the first few fight scenes are pretty damn nice. My only problem  with the movie and why I don't give it five stars is because the last fight scene isn't all that great. After the first few fight scenes of the movie I expected something a lot more awesome and intense than what was given. It was a pretty good let down but other than that, I rewind or track back to the other fight scenes and watch them all the time.",1276041600,,745,4.20979020979021

The title to my review really says it all, this movie is as close as I've seen to a live version of a bugs bunny cartoon.  Yes, the humor is geared more towards those who are familiar to asian customs, but the actions and the story line are universal.  Plus I love the fact that the main heros and villians do not look like the cookie-cutter heros and villians that Hollywood bombards us with on a daily basis.  Check it out and you will love it!

2316639,4,B0009S4IHY,"The movie, Kung-Fu Hustle, didn't strike me as something I would go and buy- but someone introduced me to the flick, and by the end of the first scene, I was hooked. Nothing is funnier than classic archetypes portrayed in the most animated way possible, over-the-top hyper-serious scenes that are peppered with the absurdity of the human need to be better than one's self. The characters, acted perfectly, are written to be likeable, bizarre, and even intrinsically identifiable. But the action, whether it be a gang slaughter at a police station, or a dance scene in the middle of a street, fits well with the wit of the play within the players. Had this been written as a non-comedy, I'd likely be horrified by every action- but as it is- it makes the idea of violence for violence sake a concept that only clowns and buffoons can master. Kung Fu Hustle is a film of martial arts mastery, high energy comedy, the twists of the human condition, and certainly a statement of the Haves and Have-Nots. Just a wild ride, escapism in its truest form.",1268524800,,1046,4.65945945945946

Also, it is subtitled and I know some people don't want to have to read subtitles.  It's honestly hard to describe.

Once they submitted and pretended not be enduring it, they quickly surrendered that it was ""surprisingly good"" and ""really entertaining"". That's the great thing about Stephan Chow; he makes his movies so unrealistic and overdone that you don't ever try to take them seriously; they are just plain ol' entertaining. His films and this one in particular seem to be a perfect hybrid of martial arts, comedy, and fantasy and comic book movies. This movie is not realistic, it is surreal, in a good way, the action scenes are fast, furious and Kung Fu...nny as heck.

2316674,5,B0009S4IHY,"Stephen Chow outdid himself in ""Kung Fu Hustle"", a movie he wrote, directed and stars in.  The humor is slapstick and off the wall, reminiscent of Road Runner vs. Wile E. Coyote in some scenes.

The plot is as follows:  Chow and his chubby sidekick want to become members of the Axe Gang.  The two commit a few petty crimes to prove they are worthy criminals.  When they enter the tacky slum run by a chainsmoking landlady and her womanizing landlord husband and try to intimidate the slum dwellers, the real hilarity begins.  The scenes with the knives and snakes are beyond funny!  (""Hey!  Who's throwing handles!"" the landlady squawks.)  The leader of the Axe Gang sends Chow on an assignment to release the most fierce criminal of all time.  If Chow accomplishes this feat, he will be accepted into the gang.  In the final scene, the ""world's greatest criminal"" and Chow face off and Chow's chi is ultimately realized.

Along the way, the viewer is introduced to a cast of interesting characters including the ""coolie,"" the tailor, the noodles and congee maker, the buck-toothed siren, the gay hair-cutter, and the deaf/mute vending girl who has a special tie with Chow's character that he has forgotten, but she never has.

Kung Fu Hustle is an odd mixture of violence and comedy and it works.  There are so many comedic surprises in this movie it's easy to watch it numerous times.  I own it and it is one of my children and my all time favorites.",1223510400,,1453,4.643137254901961

It had a few rather funny moments (few being the operative word). Other than that it was pretty much just an unredeemed bloodbath and not especially funny.

I really didn't care much for this one, sadly. I'll stick with some of the better actual martial arts movies and keep an eye open for a GOOD martial arts spoof (I think it finally found them in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaolin-Soccer/dp/B000286RNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaolin Soccer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Pow-Enter-The-Fist/dp/B000O76T72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Pow - Enter The Fist</a>).&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-White-Dragon/dp/B000BNXD6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The White Dragon</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kung-Phooey/dp/B000244GOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kung Phooey!</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Where-Is-Mama-s-Boy/dp/B000NA2TS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Where Is Mama's Boy</a>&nbsp;just didn't do it for me either.

2316690,5,B0009S4IHY,"Kung Fu Hustle paints, from a palette consisting of badassitry, comedy (in true Chow fashion) and nostalgic emotion, a unique, exciting, hilarious, heart-felt film that dazzles and entertains from beginning to end. The main character Sing, played by Stephen Chow (Shaolin soccer), chooses a life of crime after an experience as a child which causes him to view chivalry as a futile path trodden by the weak, and thieving and killing as the true path to success and power. Thus, he desires to be in the evil Axe Gang, and not being a member, decides to pretend he is a member of the nefarious gang. But he is not alone in his ruse, his overweight underachieving sidekick goes along with him. They enter a town and begin to pick on the inhabitants. The town is run by a landlady and her husband, and its inhabitants consist of hardworking poor residents who struggle to get by. Perhaps due to skepticism, pride, or stupidity, the town's people do not fall for or submit to Sing's threats. Sing backs off in one hilarious scene, muttering excuses for why he cannot physically take out certain of the town's inhabitants who are much more than meets the eye (no, they are not transformers). He fires of a firework, the distress call used by the actual Axe Gang, and the gang actually shows up. A huge kung fu battle ensues. Much of the rest of the film amounts to an escalating feud between the Axe Gang and the town. The kung fu becomes more awesome and unbelievable as the film progresses to a final climax which clearly took a few ideas from Neo's final battle with the Mr. Smiths in The Matrix. In other words, there is Kung Fu aplenty. The artistic ability, cinematography and special effects in the martial arts battles is very artistic and at times it is difficult to find the line between comedic excess, beauty and badassitry. That, in essence, is the most wonderful quality of this film. But there is a story here and it is quite nostalgic and beautiful as well. We see Sing quivering between the two sides, the kind-hearted town's people, and the dreaded axe gang's members, until finally he chooses good over evil. Perhaps the most beautiful moment in the film involves Sing executing a particular kung-fu move that has him flying quite high into the air. I will not spoil it for you, suffice to say that it is one of the most awesome scenes I have ever witnessed in Cinema, blending together the aforementioned qualities of comedy, badassitry, beauty and emotion and tying together the entire story quite well. It is the final kung fu scene in the film, and following that, the film wraps everything up quite nicely in a heart-felt manner and then seemingly ends where it begins. But alas, the film is not for everyone. Some may not appreciate the story, and find the whole affair silly and over-the-top. But I am not one of those people. The first time I watched this film, I immediately started it over and watched it again. It has immense replay value for me and each time you watch it you seem to catch something new, whether it be a new joke, a new thought, or a new image of beauty and artistry, this film just keeps calling me back again and again.",1215993600,,3163,4.580246913580247

The pacing reminds me of James Cameron's directing, with never a dull moment.  The Hong Kong style action is awesome and beautifully choreographed.  The comedy, albeit slapstick and dependent on high school level humor, nevertheless tickles our collective funny bone (again with the exception of the wifey). We especially love the sequence where Bone, the sidekick, keeps stabbing Sing in Pigsty Alley in a comedy of errors, and Sing ends up running from the Landlady a la Road Runner, using the knives stuck in his shoulders as sideview mirrors. Those who liked ""Shaolin Soccer"" are definitely in for a treat.

Feature-wise, the blu-ray disc is loaded with content, including a revealing interview with Chow.  You'll get a kick watching the movie in the original Chinese and reading the subtitles, since the translation was not exact in the English version.  Picture and audio quality are adequate and are slightly superior to the DVD counterpart.

I hope Mr. Chow never gets corrupted by Hollywood, and continues to churn out more movies like this gem.",1208390400,3,1382,4.978260869565218

This ""Axe-Kickin' Edition"" doesn't add a whole lot to the previous American release, it just puts back some of the details that were edited out of the original Hong Kong version, presumably for the delicate, easily offended American masses. Nothing too dramatic, just a little blood and such. For some reason Hollywood seemed to think that American audiences couldn't handle it. Which I don't get at all. I've seen other ""R"" rated movies with 20 times as much blood and violence, as the Hong Kong version of this movie. Plus the violence in Kung Fun Hustle is presented in such a totally over-the-top manner that makes it seem much less harsh than the mostly realistic violence found in American movies. (Like the Oscar winning ""No Country For Old Men"" for example).

Kung Fu Hustle is not a ""spoof"" of martial arts movies, it's more of an ""homage"" with a wild mix of crazy, laugh out loud humor and amazing martial arts action. Bottom line, if you like fun and awesomeness you will love Kung Fu Hustle. I guarantee it.",1207526400,3,1247,4.5625

I loved this movie. From the perspective of a beginning movie maker (amateur), this movie was breathtaking. I loved the camera angles, costumes, props, and the action scenes. This is a really well done movie.

2316715,5,B0009S4IHY,"(1) This one is a martial arts parody film co-written, co-produced, directed by and starring Stephen Chow.

(2) The plot centers around a poor Hong_kong semi-slum locality which defies surrendering to the opressive axe gang who are known for their looting and oppression.

(3) The Land Lord and land lady of this locality are superior kung-fu fighters which we come to know later on in the film

(4) Stephen Chow plays an axe-member wannabe. He wants to be part of the axe gang.

(5) There are 3 mind blowing action sequences in the film

(6) Setpiece 1: The axe gang come to intimidate and get the slum locality to bow down to them; Three of the dwellers in the locality happen to be super kung fu gurus; The three of them send the axe gang packing

(7) Setpiece2: Axe gang sends the world's 2nd best assasin team; 2 guys who by playing notes on a stringy-madarin kind of intrument,can summon and create swishing swords, arrows, axes all from thin air from the vibration of the musical notes and these weapon are flung onto the the 3 saviors of the slum locality. The assasins kill all three of the saviors.

(8) This brings the landlord and landlandy into the foray; The landlord can do superior kungfu and the landy apart from kung fu has a scream that shatters glass, stone, anything.

(9) The landlord/landlady team team up against the No 1 killer of all. He had been locked up in a cell, but is freed by the axe gang to kill the landlord/landady team after the musical killer assasin team fails to kill LL/LL team. This killer is No 1 because apart from being a kung fu master as everyone in this movie obviously is, he has the speciality of being so fast as to even catch a bullet with his fingers.

(10) Major setpiece 3: The LL/LL team fight their hearts out, and finally we get the stephen chow's matrix parody ""the one"" experience. There is  the famous paraody of the matrix reloaded sequence where Keannu fights 100's of agent miths. Here we have 100 of axe gang members against stephen Chow who has had a change of heart and has turned against the axe gang.

(11) In this action setpiece we see the ""crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" physics defying fly-kicking spiderman gravity defying kungfu. We see the all new toad style, where the villain very much becomes a toad. We also see the farthest a human being travels (upto the stratosphere actually) when getting head butted via someone conversant with the toad style of kung fu. Incidentally Stephen chow goes so high up, he puts his feet on an eagle and becomes as light as the bird and floats around before zooming back in with friction burn like one of them spiralling down satellites before he just uses his palm of ""the one"" and makes a devastating handprint on the earth big enough to cover 5 men.

A novel and insane comic caper with great special effects. A movie which makes fun of the kungfu genre and at the same time hieghtens this surreal kung fu experience.

The fight scenes with wire work and special effects are very effective.  There is also a thread of childhood friendship which adds a sweet note to the film.

2316733,5,B0009S4IHY,"This is an excellent film that crosses a few boundaries. It's first and foremost a kung-fu action movie, fused with numerous comedic moments and slapstick, as well as some heartwarming (and heartbreaking) scenes. The Chinese name for this film is simply ""Kung-Fu"", but ""Hustle"" was added to the English name to set it apart for western audiences. Fans of Stephen Chow will recognize many familiar faces and long-running gags. If you're a fan of kung fu movies (and Chinese cinema in general) and haven't seen this yet, you owe it to yourself to buy this disc.

I would say this is Chow's most universally accessible film. But like all foreign movies, some things just don't translate and there will be jokes you won't get. Some of the references and imagery are distinctly Chinese and only funny or understandable to Chinese viewers. The abundant insults and cursing (especially by the landlady) are hilarious if you understand Cantonese.

Visually, this film is stunning for its representation of 1940's Shanghai, and the transfer to BD does a very good job. Lots of wonderful and clever fight sequences by famed fight choreographer Yuen Wo Ping, as well as some great use of CG to exaggerate the action which draws inevitable comparisons to the Matrix (which used a lot CG and also involved Yuen).

Features-wise, there's a fair amount of extra stuff in here for a Blu-ray disc, including a 42 minute featurette (all Chinese with subtitles), a 30 minute interview with Chow (all English), bloopers, and deleted scenes. The featurette is for Chinese audiences and looks like something taken from HK television. The interview, on the other hand, is aimed at western audiences who are completely new to Chow's work and HK cinema. It seeks to explain a lot of the influences, gestures, and symbolism in the movie for the benefit of American audiences.

Avoid the English audio track at all costs. My player defaulted to English and I had to laugh at the really bad voiceovers before switching back to the original Cantonese. The English dub actors all attempt really bad Chinese accents. It's embarrassing and distracting.

The other complaint is that the commentary track is several seconds out of sync with the film in certain places. This is quite distracting when they talk about some very specific things like how they accomplished an effect or point out a small detail in the frame that audiences might miss.

All in all, this is a great BD to have in your collection.",1193529600,8,2472,4.901913875598086

The action sequences, both the real ones and the animated ones, are fun to watch. As do many other Stephen Chow movies, this movie tells the bittersweet (yes, somewhat simplistic) story of a downtrodden person, managing to be entertaining along the way.

Since the laughs are mostly based on action and surprise, its entertainment value diminishes the second time you watch it. So, bottom line: you should rent this movie, watch it together with friends, and have a very pleasant movie night. Just do not watch it a second time.",1191974400,,684,4.896551724137931

One day the gang shows up in a small town -- a town which tried to stay out of trouble -- to see about a small disturbance. Instead of imposing its will, the Axe Gang discovers the town's secret: Three Kung Fu masters have taken refuge there, unbeknownst even to each other. With damaged pride and reckless determination, the Axe Gang sets out to eliminate the three masters and take over the town. While the war wages, one enterprising young man tries to gain membership with the Axe Gang.

The movie was made in an entertaining style that is satirical of decades of martial-arts movies. Consider it Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with a sense of humor (I hate to use CTHD as an example, but it seems to be the most well-known movie to use the exagerated fight scenes).

This was so close to being a great movie to me. I really liked it and only have one complaint, and it is minor. One of my favorite elements to the movie was the dancing. It was a perfect element to a martial arts movie. Here was another choregraphed scene, dancing not fighting. And can't we get philosophical and say that in many ways fighting could be viewed as a crude form of dance? (Maybe I'm reaching a little bit there.) But the dancing occurs only when the Axe Gang has its confidence and as soon as it sees there is a legitimate challenger to its power, the dancing stops. And that disappointed me, but like I said before, it is only minor.

The plot is completely outrageous. If you do not like live-action movies with ridiculous story lines, Kung Fu Hustle is not a movie for you. If you want an atypical martial-arts movie that might make you laugh, check it out. I really liked Kung Fu Hustle.",1189555200,,1778,4.447852760736196

The New ""AXE KICKING EDITION"" soon to be released by Sony is actually the REGION-3 Hong Kong release which I have. (I am certain)The Hong Kong release is still the one to go for if you have a multi-region dvd player. Since I almost know for certain that only fans of the film will be interested in this new edition, I will skip the plot summary. ( for those of you who haven't seen it, you may look up my review under the original U.S. DVD.)

I will go straight to the differences between the previous dvd release and this new ""Axe-kicking edition""(original Hong Kong release):
Mild spoilers ahead---
 Scene 1; The landlady throws her husband out of a window and drops a flower pot that ended up on the back of his head. The original cut showed a small pool of blood coming from his face, but the U.S. version digitally omitted it. The blood now appears as part of the film.
Scene 2; Sing heckles/insults the residents of Pig Sty Alley and gets hit in the tummy by a woman. The original cut showed Sing spitting up blood which landed on the woman's face, but the earlier U.S. version digitally removed the blood (though some still appeared around Sing's mouth). The blood now appears in this release.
Scene 3; This may be more offensive to others; it takes place on the eve of the big attack on Pig Sty Alley. The Hong Kong cut showed a man taking a d--p onto a piece of paper as the camera panned by, but the American version digitally removed the offensive feces. Now the paper is no longer blank. ""Mr. Poo"" makes an appearance!
Scene 4; Sing confronts ""The Beast"" in the casino, he gets hit hard on the chest twice. After the 2nd hit, blood sprays on The Beast's face and Sing is shown reeling backwards from the force of the punch with blood spurting from his mouth. The U.S. version PREVIOUSLY removed both of these sequential shots.
Scene 5; Also in the casino, Sing's head is hit on his face, hammered into the ground by The Beast. After the first hit, The Beast's bloody fist is shown emerging from the floor in slow motion...but the U.S. version removed this shot entirely.
Now for the DVD Picture and Sound quality--
2.35 Anamorphic Widescreen. The Picture is extremely sharp with solid Black levels. Colors are natural and enhancements are not noticeable. CGI effects suffer a bit of softness. But the transfer is clean and nice. It is the Hong Kong transfer from what I can tell.
Sound is in 5.1 Dolby/2.0 surround in English, French & Cantonese. I am a bit disappointed why Sony still didn't include the Cantonese 5.1 DTS track as in the original Hong Kong release. Why?!
EXTRAS: Stephen Chow interview--Bloopers/outtakes--Featurettes: w/ Yuen Woo-Ping, Oliver Wong(Production designer), Shirley Wong(Costumes)
Storyboard comparison--trailers--audio commentary
CLOSING: Kung Fu Hustle is one of the more entertaining (if not the most fun in 2004) imports. It mixes pop culture blends, over-the-top comedy, hard-hitting action while maintaining a profound respect for the spirit of Kung Fu. This new region 1 release is a bit confusing, while it contains the original cut of the film, it misses the original special features and the powerful DTS Cantonese Language track. I wouldn't advise a ""double dip"" for fans who own the first REGION 1 dvd, but for fans who doesn't own the movie, pick this new version up. However, the lack of DTS sound is a huge minus for this version. I STILL prefer the ORIGINAL Hong Kong region-3 release!

2316745,5,B0009S4IHY,"Inventive. Action-packed. Absurd. Hilarious. Touching. Violent. Lively. Smart.  And above all else- Superb.

You don't need all of those adjectives to describe a great movie, but you do when describing Stephen Chow's masterpiece Kung Fu Hustle.  Taking place in 1940s China, our story involves the hundreds-strong Axe Gang, their efforts to take over the impoverished and dilapidated Pig Sty Alley, and the effects on Pig Sty's tenants.  The gang believes taking or Pig Sty will be a cakewalk, but a few of the residents aren't about to let that happen.

Perhaps the most unique thing about the film is how our attention is shifted from one protagonist to another.  The first part focuses on three Kung Fu experts (a baker who carries a wooden staff that can shatter metal guns, a hardworking laborer, and a sensitive homosexual tailor).  The second part is about Pig Sty's tyrannical chain-smoking landlady and her philandering landlord husband.  And the third part concerns a loser (played by Chow) who tries to take up life of crime because of a traumatic childhood incident when he tried to do good deed.  I've read critics pan KFH because it lacks one true central character, but I just call it doing something different.  Oh well, whatever gets those critics through those long and lonely nights.

Unconventional narrative style aside, there are plenty of other reasons to watch such as the eye popping effects and the humor.  Ordinarily, I can't stand CGI, but I really love the way it was used here.  Chow succeeds in using it in ways that most American filmmakers can't even dream about.  A gut-busting Looney Toons inspred foot chase and a fight with two evil street musicians both have to be seen to be believed.

But the best part is..It's FUNNY!! I mean hilariously so. The action scenes are well choreographed, but don't look choreographed. The acting is superb. I love this movie!

2316773,5,B0009S4IHY,"There is a local cable station where I live that, late at night, often shows these tedious kung fu films that I can only assume are or were the mainstay for Hong Kong, Taiwan and some main land China film goers. Most of the action is between one or two young assailants and one older defender made up to appear older with white hair, puffy eyebrows and beard.) Foley artists I expect were exhausted after adding loud snaps and bangs to every contact between the fighters who, except for an occasional flip or ricochet off a tree, are fairly earthbound. And it is impossible to deduce from their barely subtitled dialogue what they are fighting about. Also, these battles almost always take place in a forest or rocky glen.

Recent kung fu epics like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Hero; and House of Flying Daggers, to name only a few, have raised the bar both stylistically and in terms of production values. Stephen Chow, director and co-writer of Kung Fu Hustle, has taken the genre one step further: while keeping the high standards in fight choreography, special and trapeze effects, camera work and editing found in the aforementioned films, Chow produces an at first glance comedic kung fu movie that also incorporates American film genres, not only to inject this latter iconography into his story but also to expand the viewer's consciousness of the toll and meaning (or meaninglessness of) violence. It is obvious that Chow is an avid devotee of Hollywood: he appropriates 1930s musicals a la Fred Astaire in the dance Axe Gang leader Brother Sum and his mob do in their stronghold. Pig Sty Alley is a Chinese version a Bowery Boys back alley. Music, both traditional Chinese string orchestra and snippets from Western classical violin concerts, is used as a continuous underscore. And the physical comedy employed in the first half of the film - among them falls from buildings that do not injure, fist distorted features that snap back like rubber, running legs reduced to a cyclonic blur, people moved dozen of yards in less than a blink of an eye - all draw on Hollywood prototypes, especially the cartoons produced by Warner Brothers in the middle of the last century.

While the callous execution of a rival gang in the middle of the street has the expected comic twist and is nonetheless tolerated despite the carnage, the early death of the coolie, tailor and Donut the baker - the three initial defenders of the Pig Sty Alley - come, on reflection, as something of a shock. Who now is going to step up and defend Pig Sty Alley? The landlord and his wife come forward, revealing their mastery of the martial arts that is almost enough to conquer the Beast - almost, but not quite. Their salvation, and Shanghai's deliverance from the murderous tyranny of the Axe Gang is the transformation from street thug and gang wannabe (and secretly noble) Sing (played by director Chow) into a superfighter who finally vanquishes the Beast.

Throughout, the most vicious and powerful kung fu attacks barely graze the combatants, which maintains the sense of comedy even while the good guys are dying. Chow plays with this violent-comic, good-evil dichotomy with a master's touch. And yet on reflection we realize that more than good entertainment is at stake here. The violence is neutralized by the comedy, and yet the characters, who are so well drawn by this talented cast and its director, are taken from us too soon. Kung Fu Hustle plays this crafty game with us: amazing us with special effects-enhanced fight scenes, making us laugh with well timed and conceived comic bits and pratfalls, but in the end leaving us with an odd dissatisfaction, as much with the film as with the genre. Hollywood inspired images transcend the nominal crudeness of run-of-the-mill chop-socky far, but also raise the stakes in that the characters gain dimension, and in doing so leave the view bereft by their passing. While being more cartoonish, Kung Fu Hustle becomes more real.

Hung Fu Hustle comes highly recommended, and we can only hope that its sequel, due out in 2008, lives up to the standards set by this imaginative and unsettling film.",1170806400,3,4144,4.8406205923836385

I think he mastered what makes people laugh in the cinema. And, he used all the graphic to best lead the story.

I won't say any more, I was hurting myself and tearing in the cinema laughing so much, And, I have watched it more than 5-6 times now. And, it is still amazingly funny.

The making documentary also give a good insight of the movie. I wish the creative Asian movie should debut directly in USA market. Then again, Americans don't like to read subtitles. And dubbed voices tend to work in the animation or comedy.

In this case, the dubbed English version on DVD is equally as good as the original  with the subtitle.

I'm sure Asian humor is different from American humor, but I'm surprised there's THIS MUCH DIFFERENCE.  I've seen plenty of kung fu movies, old and new, and most of them are pretty far-fetched.  With that in mind I thought this was a semi-typical kung fu movie.

Was I entertained though?  Sure I was.  I thought the story and action were very original and intriguing.  The two musicians and their deadly music didn't seem comical or hokey to me.  I thought it was very inventive and probably the most compelling scene of any kung fu movie I've watched.  The ""Budda Palm"" and the ""Frog Style"" might have been funny to some people but who am I too say what doesn't count as a mystical martial arts style.

I only rate it 3 stars because the label ""comedy"" disappointed me.  When I watch a comedy I want to laugh.  If it were labeled as ""action"" or ""martial arts"" I would've rated it higher.

This movie has subtle and slapstick humor (e.g., the unremovable cigarette in the matriarch's mouth), but is quite intelligent, and encompasses good cinematography with subtle effects (such as the visually vibrating heat waves as the bad guys first approach the slum village).

2316812,5,B0009S4IHY,"My first experience with Hong Kong producer/director/writer/actor Stephen Chow came when a good friend recommended Shaolin Soccer (2001), a film which I enjoyed a lot primarily due to its kinetic energy and off the wall, mind bending special effects, so when I heard Chow was coming out with another feature, titled Kung Fu Hustle (2004), I was very interested...sadly, I missed the theatrical release, but I was able to catch it on video and I wasn't disappointed.  Co-written and directed by Stephen Chow (God of Cookery, Shaolin Soccer), who also shares credits in producing, writing, and original music, the film features Chow, along with Qiu Yuen (Kung Fu Mahjong), Wah Yuen (Kung Fu Mahjong), Zhi Hua Dong, Kwok-Kwan Chan (Shaolin Soccer), Chi Chung Lam (Kung Fu Mahjong), and Siu-Lung Leung (Kung Fu 12 Kicks).

As the film, set in the 1930s, begins we learn a ruthless group known as the Axe Gang pretty much control everything through intimidation (and axes), except for an area known as Pig Sty Alley, a poor, residential block not worth bothering with as those who live there have very little, if anything, to offer up.  As a result the residents of Pig Sty Alley live a relatively peaceful life under the thumb of their chain-smoking, hag-like landlord who's always dressed in a natty nightgown, rollers in her hair, and funky flip flops.  One day a pair of hapless buffoons show up, one of them named Sing (Chow), pretending to be Axe Gang members, and start pushing people around (in a really funny sequence), resulting in the appearance of the real Axe Gang.  Well, turns out three residents of Pig Sty Alley are actually powerful, semi-retired warriors, and a crazy battle ensues as the trio single-handedly beat the crud out of the gang.  The gang retreats to lick their wounds and ends up hiring a pair of musicians who moonlight as professional killers and another fantastic fight sequence ensues.  Meanwhile, Sing and his fat friend, eager to join the Axe Gang, are tasked to perform some evilness, in which they fail miserably.  Things get a bit murky around this point, but the gang ends up having to hire the number one killer, someone known as The Beast, played by Siu-Lung Leung, who's currently locked away in a mental institution due to the fact he studied kung fu so intensely it caused him to go crazy (I guess).  Anyway, turns out Sing, the bumbling would be criminal, has within him a power even he's not aware of, one rivals even The Beast himself.

While I'm not an expert on Asian cinema, I have seen enough of it to know at least one thing...a good deal of it doesn't often make a lot of sense, to me at least (but then again I'm an idiot).  Maybe this is due to translation issues tied to my own Westernized sensibilities, I don't know, but I've come to expect, and even rely on, the fact that whenever I watch an Asian import, specifically within the martial arts genre, there's going to be aspects I won't understand, and that's certainly true of Kung Fu Hustle.  I don't see this as a negative aspect as generally I can get the gist of the story (the student avenging the death of an authority figure theme is pretty common) even if some of the finer points are lost.  Here the main theme seems to be protectors coming forth to stand up for the little guy against seemingly insurmountable odds.  I went with that, letting the rest (the parts that didn't make sense) slide, managing to get through the film quite easily, helped immeasurably along by the virtual non-stop, high flying, kinetic, highly comedic action and crazy go nuts special effects work.  At times the film seemed like a live action Looney Tunes cartoon given the balls out silliness involved (there's a foot chase sequence that's right out of a Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote cartoon).  One of my favorite parts of the film occurs near the beginning when Sing and his fat friend venture into Pig Sty Alley.  Sing, trying to appear tougher than he actually is, starts antagonizing a gathered crowd of residents, challenging individuals to a one on one fight.  In doing so he tries to pick out those who would seem easy to beat, the first being a man in the crowd who actually turns out to be a giant (seems when the man was in the crowd he was sitting down, so Sing, only seeing the man's head, assumed the man was a relatively small guy).  Once Sing sees how tall the guy actually is he decides to choose another, resulting in similar scenarios.  Obviously this is a visual gag, so much will be lost reading about it here.  There's so much overall nuttiness going on in this film it's hard to describe it, but if you dig on zany Three Stooges antics, you'll probably enjoy this feature.  Hardcore film fans may also get a kick out of the film as there's plenty of references to other films, in particular The Shining (1980), The Blues Brothers (1980), and Spider-Man (2002), to name a few.  One thing to keep in mind is this is the American theatrical release of the film, so some aspects have been toned down (apparently some of the bloody bits have been removed from the fight sequences).  As far as the computer generated effects (CGI), they look as sharp here as in a film like The Matrix (1999), and there's a lot of it, so if you're not a big fan of that type of effects work, you probably won't enjoy the film.  I can accept a lot of it, if it looks good and ties within the story (which felt like the case here), but I dislike its extensive usage meant to fill gaps in a production, the intent being to draw focus away from said gaps, as is generally the case with films from someone like Roland Emmerich, responsible for such features as Godzilla (1998) and The Day After Tomorrow (2004).  All in all I thought this film a blast, one worth multiple viewings.

The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1), looks exceptionally sharp, and the audio, available in original Cantonese Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, dubbed English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound track, and dubbed French Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround comes across beautifully.  As far as extras there's a commentary track with Chow and a few performers (with English subtitles), a forty minute featurette titled Behind the Scenes of Kung Fu Hustle, two deleted scenes, an interview piece with Stephen Chow, an outtakes and bloopers reel, a poster gallery for the film, a whole slew of previews for other Sony releases, and subtitles available in English and French.  All in all a great package for a highly entertaining film, one I'm probably going to watch more than once.

2316816,5,B0009S4IHY,"This was my introduction to writer/director/producter/actor Stephen Chow and the genre of kung fu films.  I have to say that though a lot of the inspirations for this film are derived from inside jokes (mostly easily comprehendable to fans of the genre), they still succeeded in making me laugh (or at least smile), plus computer generated special effects and broad, self effacing humor and you will definitely see why ""Kung Fu Hustle"" stands out from the other films of its kind.

Sing (Stephen Chow) is an aspiring--if clumsy--kung fun master who was told by a begger/con artist as a child that he was the chosen kung fu master and would unlock his potential if he purchased a special book for only $10 (his life savings).  Though, Sing hasn't been able to successfully execute a single kung fu move in all the years that followed that chance encounter, his one true wish it become a part of the very violent ""Axe Gang"" that terrorizes the---seemingly--humble residents of Pig Pen Alley in 1940s Hong Kong.  What Sing doesn't realize is that the residents have some martial arts moves of their own (particularly the landlady who has NEVER lost a yelling contest, the tailor, and virtually everyone down to the little boys).

Honestly, I can't begin to articulate in this review just what style--visually--this film would fit into.  This, like other films of its kind, has plenty of action packed sequences, gravity defying fights and eye popping depictions of stylized violence (or should I say injury?  you literally see someone's teeth popping out of their head!).

This is the biggest blockbuster in Hong Kong history, for good reason.  You will definitely be entertained.  A note:  This is not suitable for young children or young teens.  This is an R-rated film for good reason.  The title speaks for itself.....",1153958400,5,1819,4.924590163934426

2316840,3,B0009S4IHY,"The stylish and stylized ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is, as its name implies, a goofy martial arts parody done with rare good humor and a keen sense of the absurd.  It is a tale of gangsters and wannabe gangsters going up against a half dozen or so of the finest fighters in the lower class part of town.  However, the plot is merely a framing device for a series of amazing fight sequences that showcase not only the performers' incredible skills as stunt men (and women) but the filmmaking prowess of those behind the camera as well.  Writer/director Stephen Chow (who also plays the main role) turns his flesh-and-blood actors into the equivalent of cartoon characters, unaffected by the laws of gravity and physics, as they are stabbed repeatedly, fall from impossible heights, and suffer incredible bodily abuse, only to pick themselves up, dust themselves off, and continue on fighting as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.  The razor sharp editing and multi-speed camerawork - ranging from fast-motion to freeze framing - also contribute immeasurably to the surrealistic tone of the film.

It's true that ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is definitely an acquired taste, and to those who are not aficionados of the art form, much of the movie can seem repetitive and silly.  And even for the most passionate of devotees, it can still be too much of a good thing.  The plot is frequently incoherent and the characters wafer-thin, but the stunning look and extraordinary energy level of the film make it a must-see for diehard fans of the martial arts.",1151625600,,1540,4.832699619771863
2316841,3,B0009S4IHY,"""Kung Fu Hustle"" is the most beautifully crafted of my three favorite Stephen Chow's films -  ""Shaolin Soccer,"" King of Comedy"" and this one.  Comedy, martial arts and traditional Chinese fairy tale are all rolled up together in Chow's hilarious, inventive and masterfully told tale, ""Kung Fu Hustle."" If you're not familiar with Stephen Chow's enormous talent, you're in for a big treat.

Chow's leads, always played by himself, most resemble Charlie Chapman's characters.  His physical comedy is especially reminiscent of Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Charlie Chase - characters that are inept yet endearing and enduring.  Chow's hero is a loser who always falls in love with a poor girl, innocent and trusting. Both of them apparently destined to remain at the bottom rung of society's ladder.  But the similarity to Charlie Chaplin ends there.  Ultimately, this comedy is about the resurrection of one's higher nature.

While he's a child, Chow's character is conned into buying a pamphlet that supposedly holds the secret to great spiritual power.  Shortly afterwards, a humiliating incident causes him to lose faith in that power, and mistrust his better impulses.  Consequently, as an adult, all he wants is to be a really bad guy -in the worst way, literally.  Most of the film's humor comes from his ridiculous and self defeating attempts to prove just how bad he is.  Like a misguided Don Quixote, his quest is to align himself with evil. At his side is his bumbling, confused and even more ineffectual, but ever loyal, companion.

Our hero chooses Pig Sty Alley, a rundown housing complex, for his first attempt to prove how bad he is.  Thinking he's picked an even bigger bunch of losers than he himself, he tangles with the strange assortment of seemingly ordinary characters who inhabit this Chinese tenement. However, they aren't in the least intimidated by his criminal pose, and they prove to be a lot tougher than he anticipates.  They're much more concerned about what's going on in the neighborhood than about any potential danger he might bring.  Desperate to be taken seriously, he accidentally gets himself involved in his first dicey situation.

His determination to hook up with evil takes him, and the people of the neighborhood, into ever more challenging,  frightening, and serious confrontations with really bad guys, which brings out surprising strengths in the people of Pig Sty Alley.  When finally faced with evil personified, the hero's true spirit emerges.

This movie is wonderful entertainment for all ages.  But for anyone who wants to be a filmmaker, it's a lesson that shouldn't be missed.  Stephen Chow is one of the best filmmakers of today. He writes, directs and acts in all his movies.  He pays equal attention to every aspect of filmmaking - whether special effects, editing, set and costume design, sound effects, music, character, or story development.  Every character is unique and distinct.  He works against the expected. In one very funny chase scene, he uses classical music instead of typically comic music.  Listen for the pinball sound effects during a free-for-all fight scene. I've seen this movie many times and I never cease to marvel at his ingenuity, complexity and originality.

As a bonus, his story is powerfully optimistic. It shows us that fighting courageously for the good, and to be truly yourself, can elevate you to heights you never dreamed of (really!)  That the least among us may carry hidden greatness.  That together we can win against enormous odds.  That once we understand who we really are, and what we are here to give, love will be ours.  And, last but not least, that we can laugh at ourselves along the way.",1148083200,4,3692,5.00327868852459

2316843,5,B0009S4IHY,"On the recommendation of a friend, I picked up Stephen Chow's ""Kung-Fu Hustle"" -- ""It's a martial arts comedy,"" he said.  He may have committed the worst case of under-selling a product I've ever come across.

""Kung-Fu Hustle"" contains the most surprising, you'll-never-see-this-coming humor I've seen in a movie since I saw Steve Buscemi's leg (with sock) meeting its destiny in a woodchipper in the Coen brothers' ""Fargo.""  I will be brief, so as not to spoil any of the surprises for you, but without giving too much away, you will see subtle and not-so-subtle references to such moments as Sean Connery's death scene in ""The Untouchables,"" the ""hallway of blood"" from ""The Shining,"" the fight scenes from ""The Matrix,"" and the Roadrunner versus Wile E. Coyote.

Some movies, such as Stanley Tucci's ""Big Night,"" just make you smile with their tone and general warmth.  I never thought I'd say that about a martial arts film, but from the moment the Axe Gang shows up in ""Reservoir Dogs"" apparel, kills a few gangsters, and then dances some fantastic mish-mash step/line dancing, I was enthralled with ""Kung Fu Hustle.""  Also, who can't love a movie mainly set in ""Pig Sty Alley,"" ruled by the Landlady, a witty spoof of all ""dragon lady"" stereotypes.

Avoid all reviews and spoilers for this movie -- while I expect ""Kung Fu Hustle"" will hold up on repeated viewings, I will never again be as surprised or thrilled as I was the first time I saw it.  A wonderful addition to the film library.",1145232000,8,1495,4.767441860465116

It could have come off as grandiose and silly  but instead it is a spectacle-fest, thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. The violence may be slightly disconcerting at first. I'd heard it was action-comedy but I didn't expect that level of violence. However, when you get into the meat of the movie, it's priceless. I laughed harder than I had done in a long time. It's rather difficult to find adjectives to describe this movie, which stretches imagination and caricature. The synchrony is lovely. I loved the dance by the Axe Gang and the general kung fu choreography. The CGI effects are first rate. I've seen this movie more than once.

Stephen Chow is a born comedian to make comedies. He is the writer, director & lead actor of this movie. He knows exactly how to make a great comedy with his talent. The inspirations and creativity that Stephen put into this movie liberalize the limitation of the comedy. It demonstrated that a comedy can still be funny & enjoyable in a special way. This movie shows the sophistication of how Stephen handles an unusual comedy fabulously.

The visual are simply amazing because of its action choreography & cinematography. Every movement of this movie is so refreshing & enjoyable. The art direction and costume design are remarkable.

If you want to see an unusual but fantastic comedy, please check this one out. I highly recommend this movie all the comedy fans. This movie was full of joys, surprises & laughter.

His other movie Shaolin Soccer about the Kung Fu master trying to find a life's purpose and does so by incorperating Kung Fu into Soccer was a good story and quite funny. But his new story for Kung Fu Hustle had a more serious tone to it. I really enjoyed the story a lot more in this installment. The scenery for the time period was done well and the comedy was not overpowering but just right. If you've seen some of his other films this one may shock just a little when serious parts occur but this film is nevertheless one that is done quite well and should be given a good review for it.,1142121600,2,632,4.231404958677686

2316855,5,B0009S4IHY,"Kung Fu Hustle is supposed to be a comedy but it's so much more than that. The story begins with a rather serious scene when the entire Crocodile gang is taken out by the dancing, powerful, and notorious Axe Gang. After getting to know their power you are then introduced to the stupidity of Sing and his sidekick.

The two want to be members of the Axe Gang but they can't fight and they are too wimpy to pull off any crimes. Sing tries to fool a barber in Pig Sty alley, which is a district that had no trouble because of poverty. Sing starts something he can't finish when he sends a fake distress call used by gangs when in the need of help. The Axe gang isn't pleased when they find a district of broke people picking on two fake members of their gang but somehow they didn't notice they had nothing to do with their gang.

Not only does Sing get the district in trouble he unknowingly gets the Axe Gang in trouble. There are heroes within the district but you would never think these guys  were anyones hero, one is a tailor, the other a cook, and the last is just a hard labor worker. None of them look like heroes but they are and man can they fight. I know Kung Fu Hustle is supposed to be funny but to me it was just a perfectly blended masterpiece. The fight sequences were amazing and like nothing you've ever seen before and the story is gripping. There's one scene where these two assassins use sound waves as a weapon so maybe that helps to show how unique this is.

My only problem was some things were a little too fake or digitalized and this made some of the fights not as good as others. I recommend watching this film in subtitles and not in the English dialogue. Seeing it in English just takes away from the film because you miss most of what is really being said.

2316856,4,B0009S4IHY,"KUNG FU HUSTLE is clearly one of the silliest, funny, genuinely well-produced comedies to come around for a long time.  It is so very refreshing to lose yourself in this farce knowing that the entire purpose of the film is to entertain.  But as in all good comedy there is also a message.

Talented director/writer (with Tsang Kan Cheong)/star Stephen Chow has the whole concept of Kung Fu as entertainment down pat.  With the brilliant choreography of Yuen Wo Ping as partner, Chow tells a skeletal tale of two wannabe criminals (Chow himself and his obese sidekick Chi Chung Lam) who will stop at nothing to become members of the Canton mafia Axe Gang. They blunder into a hick town run by a smarmy landlord and his bellicose wife  to find someone to kill, as that is the only way they can join the Axe Gang. But this sleepy little town is unafraid of gangs, why? - because they happen to be the home of some expert Kung Fu practitioners.  After some absurd events the Axe Gang happens into the town only to come up against impossible odds and a lot of hilarious surprises.

The choreography and setting parodies everything in the Hollywood repertoire: the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone, High Noon antics, Busby Berkeley type staging, Keystone Cops zany shenanigans, Marital Arts films - name it, the film takes a shot and the shot outdoes the original!  The color and cinematography are terrific, the musical score (to which Chow also contributed!) is a little masterwork of ancient Chinese instruments garnished with contemporary sounds, and the actors, when not engaged in the nonstop fighting sequences, just seem to be having the best time being silly.  For pure diversion and giggling entertainment, spend an evening in the  company of Stephen Chow and crew.  Recommended, even for serious movie aficionados!

There are many scenes that imitate the Road Runner and Coyote.  Other physical humor scenes include trying to light a cigarette, trying to put a fire out by using alcohol.  But one of the funniest sequences is how to try to keep a snake from biting you. ""handle, who is throwing a handle???""

The extra footage and behind the scenes and enlightening and provide a fun way to learn how the movie was developed, actors selected, and movie filmed.  The behind the scenes footage is really informative, but the dialog is in Chinese, thank goodness for subtitles.

The actions sequences were rehearsed by the same artist from the Matrix.  How tough is the fighting at the end, it is so much that the bad guys are raining like cats and dogs.

Ordinary objects used as powerful kung fu weapons include laundry hooks, cigarette butts, a Chinese lap guitar (from which swords come flying out when strummed.) Yet, the movie also looks uncomfortably familiar. Steven Chow, the street bum, after beaten senseless suddenly resurrects and, unbeknownst to anyone, inexplicably becomes The One to face the Kung Fu Armageddon.

2316886,5,B0009S4IHY,"Let's face it:  there is an irreducible silly element to many kung fu movies.  What Stephen Chow has managed to do in both SHAOLIN SOCCER and KUNG FU HUSTLE is take the silliness and raise it to the nth degree, creating some of the most marvelous parodies that I have ever seen.  What is amazing is that while he expertly picks out the more absurd elements of those films, his own films, though comedies are in fact far less silly than those films that intend to be far more serious.  A fruitful comparison is some American comedic parodies, such as JANE AUSTEN'S MAFIA, which never rises above silliness.  The comedy here in KUNG FU HUSTLE is broad, but it is never simply dumb.

The story concerns the conflict between the Axe Gang in Shanghai and the residents of Pig Sty Alley.  The time is supposedly the forties before the Revolution, but it seems oddly ahistorical, a Shanghai that never really existed.  World War II seems never to have occurred or left a mark on the place and there is no hint of the Communist uprising that had been taking place since the thirties.  Still, the film has a believable period feel despite this.  A petty thief named Sing (played by the film's writer and director Stephen Chow) pretends to be a member of the Axe Gang and attempts to bully some residents of the slum.  This inadvertently pulls in the real Axe Gang, which descends on the community only to be turned back by three of the residents who turn out to be kung fun masters incognito.  The rest of the film consists of escalations in kung fun mastery as the Axe Gang brings in their own kung fu masters, until the end when one individual proves to be the greatest kung fun master of all.  This would all be insufferably dull except that every twist and turn is handled expertly by Chow.

It should be noted that the two most elaborate fight scenes were directed by the great Sammo Hung, the legendary Hong Kong star and director perhaps best known in the United States for his highly underrated television series MARTIAL LAW.

I think this film will appeal both to fans of Hong Kong cinema and to fans of the more surreal shaolin films.  Whether it will appeal to a wider audience I am unable to say, but I would urge those with even slightly open minds to give this a try.  If you enjoyed CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON or HERO, you would probably enjoy this highly accomplished parody.",1135555200,6,2386,4.511627906976744

***2009 Notes on the 2007 ""Axe-Kickin"" Edition***

I still love this movie, and recently came across a 2007 reissue called
the ""Axe Kickin' Edition"". I bought it because it was only four bucks and
the jacket touted all-new features, including ""Never-Before See Footage from
the Hong Kong Version"".

If you have the original 2005 release, hang onto it -this newer version isn't as
good - both versions have the same run time -there is no additional footage
in the 2007 reissue.

The difference movie-wise is the 2007 has more graphic blood effects:

- When the Landlord falls from the balcony and then hits the pavement, a
trickle of blood runs from his head up the pavement.

- When the ""Cattle Raising"" woman punches Stephen Chow after he challenges
her, she gets sprayed with Stephen Chow's blood.

- More blood effects when the Beast first beats up Stephen Chow.

Unfortunately, I think the additional blood takes away from the slapstick feel
of these scenes, making them more violent/less funny (maybe the original DVD
release was cleaned up for this reason).

The new extras are pretty much run-of-the-mill movie prodution featurettes. The
special features on the original DVD release were more entertaining.

So if you haven't seen this movie, try to get the 2005 release. If you own the
2005 edition and are a fan, there's nothing earth-shattering in the 2007
""Axe-Kickin' Edition"" that makes it a must buy.

Still, this is a classic comedic movie, either way!",1135123200,4,2003,4.883928571428571
2316889,5,B0009S4IHY,"This movie has taken a place among my all-time favorites; it absolutely cracks me up every time.

The only movie that I have seen which is similar to this one is Kung Pow.  However, I found Kung Pow to have only a few truly funny moments, and it rapidly grew annoying.  Kung-Fu pulls of the jokes perfectly, where Kung Pow ultimately fell flat.  Stephen Chow's previous film, Shaolin Soccer, was equally hilarious in its mix of the martial arts and sports genres of film.

It focuses mostly on spoofing Kung-Fu films, as well as the Matrix movies, but you'll also see a Roadrunner scene, and a reference to Spiderman and The Untouchables (which left me in stitches), among others.  Besides the way-over-the-top spoofing, the comedy also involves slapstick, irony, and sometimes being just plain goofy.

Unless you have trouble reading fast enough, I definitely recommend watching it subtitled rather than dubbed.  Some of the best jokes don't come across as well with the voice-overs.",1134604800,3,984,4.9573170731707314

At times serious and at most crazy hijinks, Kung Fu Hustle is perfect for any action/martial arts/comedy/gangster/hong-kong movie afficiado.  Basic storyline is this: two bums off the streets are trying to join the most ruthless gang in the city, The Axe Gane, by showing everyone how tough they are...by posing as members of the gang.  When they try to push their weight around a dingy appartment complex they accidently spark a war between the Axe Gang and the certain members of the appartment community who are secretly legendary kung fu masters.  Needless to say, when the kicks and axes start flying the body count rises faster than a pinball machine score (which by the way is the sound effect for when the bad guys go flying and crashing into everything).

2316892,5,B0009S4IHY,"I buy very few videos, as there aren't many movies I want to see repeatedly.  Intrigued by posters at the local video store, I rented ""Kung Fu Hustle"" with the comment to my wife ""This is either going to hilarious or incredibly stupid"".  We agreed to give it a try and shut it off if we didn't care for it after 30 minutes.

Well, we not only watched the end, but when we got done went back and watched parts again and two days later bought a copy.  The movie is best described as the Matrix crossed with ""Dumb and Dumber"" and a Bruce Lee movie mixed in.  Somehow it manages to be satirical, silly while being occasionally gripping, artful and even slightly (very slightly...very, very slightly) spiritual.

The movie is not perfect.  I would actually rate it 4.5 stars.  Some of the acting is uneven, the dialogue a little strange and occasionally it is just as dumb as I feared it might be.",1133654400,4,892,4.396341463414634

Yeah, this movie has them.  In fact this flick is just about the craziest thing that I have seen in a long time.  Not much of a plot, but an excellent movie in all other respects.

Interestingly enough, this movie (according to the extra stuff on the DVD) used all Chinese music.  I would have to say that the music is great in it.  Especially the opening credits and the dance sequence.

Also, I ended up with the subtitle version of this movie.  I didn't know that there was an English dubbed version.  However, in thinking about it now, I prefer the version I got.  The acting is excellent, and I wonder if some of that might have gotten lost in the dubbed version.  I didn't mind reading the subtitles, and you can still hear the voices of the original actors.

Finally, my wife also liked this movie.  She liked it, I think, because of the lady landlord (who kicks it pretty nicely).  She also liked the silly humor (which really brought back memories of old Warner Brothers cartoons).  There is also a tiny bit of romance.",1133308800,4,1200,4.611374407582939
2316894,4,B0009S4IHY,"What do you get when you cross Stephen Chow with Stephen Chow? Invariably a movie about Kung-Fu. This is no exception, but at least it holds up to the standard established for American audiences by Shaolin Soccer.

Kung-Fu Hustle has that same irreverent feel to it, and astute observers will notice that every actor and actress of note from Shaolin Soccer has returned here as well, with a few notable exceptions from Team Evil.

This film doesn't try to break any new ground, convey a moral, or do any other such nonsense. Instead, it stays true to its core and emerges as a fun way to spend an hour and some change watching the hybrid offspring of The Matrix and an old Kung-Fu film.

All the classic elements are here: there is the good guy who is trying to be bad but can't, the girl who has a link to the good guy's childhood and who anchors him, the supernaturally-powerful heros who -- of course -- meet up with an impossibly tough bad guy, the resurrection-themed ascension of the aforementioned good guy to power, and the axe-wielding mobsters whou seem to double as dancers in an off-Broadway musical.

You know, the basic elements of any Kung-Fu film.

Overall, a very enjoyable bit.",1133049600,2,1195,4.617924528301887
2316895,5,B0009S4IHY,"Kung Fu Hustle is the best martial arts film of the year. I agree, this is Kill Bill meets Looney Tunes. Stephen Chow wrote and directed this film and I have to say that this is awesome! He is sure to be the next big martial arts star of Hollywood. The script is your typical Kung Fu story, but the fight scenes are excellent and I can't say enough and the fantastic special effects. The Lion Scream, The Buddhist Palm, I could just go on and on, this film is amazing.

My personal favorite scene of the movie is when the kung fu masters fight the two assassins that play their instruments while tossing swords at their opponents. I have never seen anything like that in my life on a movie; the best part! Worth seeing the movie just for that battle sequence alone!

This is an EDITED DVD!  Don't support this watered-down version!  Get another region release.

From dvdcompare.net:

Scenes that were edited for US consumption:

* After the scene where the landlady knocks the landlord out the window onto the ground, the original Hong Kong version shows a bit of blood flowing out from under the landlord's face after the plant smashes his head. The American version removes the blood.

* Sing's failed attempt in intimidating a Pig Sty village farmer, who punches him square in the stomach. The Hong Kong version shows Sing spitting out blood, which ends up appearing on the farmer's face after Sing asks her what she does. The American version digitally removes both the blood being spit out (but blood is still seen around his mouth implying it was ""coming up"") as well as the blood splats on the farmer's face.

* During the night scene right before the attack from the musicians there is a long take showing what most of the residents of Pig Sty are doing, including someone crouching on the ground having a ""bowel movement"". The Hong Kong version shows a piece of paper with excrement on it implying what he was doing, while the American version removes the paper and its ""contents"", leaving the viewer confused as to why he's simply crouching down with his pants partially down.

Two scenes were completely cut:

* When ""The Beast"" punches Sing in the chest in the casino, two extra shots appear in the Hong Kong cut, with the first being a slow motion shot of blood spraying upward The Beast's face, and the second being another slow motion shot, this time of Sing's head flying back with blood spraying from his mouth.

* Soon after this, Sing's face is punched into the ground by The Beast, and a several second slow motion shot of The Beast's bloody hand being raised from the ground is shown in the Hong Kong cut. The American cut simply jumps from the shot of Sing's head being punched through the ground to the low angle shot of The Beast pulling his fist up.

Don't buy it!  Order from another region (Hong Kong and South Korean versions are UNCUT)!",1132444800,26,2138,4.621693121693122
2316918,5,B0009S4IHY,"I'm going to have to agree with T. Nakajima on this movie. This is one of the best kung fu movies, ever. If you are a Jackie Chan fan like myself and like comedy in your kung fu, but you still enjoy Jet Li, Ekin Cheng, and Chow Yun Fat fliks with powerful fight scenes and crazy flying around, then this is right up your alley. But, don't expect this to be Kung-Pow! It's funny without being overly goofy and stupid about it. It helps to understand the eastern sense of corny humor sometimes too. There's some pretty good CG as in Shaolin Soccer, and Chow makes good use of the CG even in sight gags. But, there's good romance to this story as well, and overall you'll be pleased by the time it ends.

Another point of note. If you're going to read reviews by people who have problems paying for their DVDs, or compare kung fu flicks to unrelated western fish-out-of-water comedies, or for some reason get frustrated reading subtitles and think that actors in Hong Kong films are somehow speaking Japanese instead of Chinese, then be my guest. Otherwise, take it from me, I'm a Hong Kong and Japanese film fan, and this one is going right next to Shanghai Noon, Gorgeous, and The Duel.",1132444800,,1185,4.435779816513762

I like dumb kung fu movies but this one crossed the line. It might've been better if the entire movie you didn't have to read the bottom of the screen or be fluent in Japanese to undertand what they were saying. The movie it self is not good. Very boring and the fight scenes are overrated. There is one good scene where these people with nine inch nails kill off some kung fu masters, but that is it. The rest is gay as Fing he11! Don't by this DVD. If you really want to see it rent it so you don't waste your money.

2316920,5,B0009S4IHY,"This movie is a work of pure comic genius, from an unexpected source! Who would have expected a Chinese director to come up with a Warner Bros.-style, Kung Fu, live action cartoon? Not me! Stephen Chow has OBVIOUSLY spent some time either in Hollywood, or in a history of film class drinking in the work of Tex Avery and Robert Clampett! This movie is a HOWL! Imagine if you will, (submitted for your approval,) The Zucker Bros. or pre-""High Anxiety"" Mel Brooks getting a hold of a troupe of Chinese kung fu actors and using every ""Looney Tunes"" gag they can think of to milk the laughs for everything they're worth!

Stephen Chow has all the earmarks of a master of kung fu slapstick, something this country hasn't really ever seen before. Aside from the great sight gags, he has also assembled a real soupcon of characters, from Rabbit-Tooth Jane, an unusual girl to say the least, (she acts VERY effeminate and has a look I really haven't seen in oriental women before,) to the bossy, battle-axe landlady, who also happens to be a dormant kung-fu doyenne, to her husband, a fellow, middle aged kung fu master, to a sweet, mute, Japanese-looking girl who sells ice cream. There are others, too numerous to mention here, without tiring you out!

The director himself is the hero of the film, and he goes from being a sleazy, gangster wannabe to being a deadpan kung fu messiah during the course of the movie. One hilarious scene, while he is still a sleazebag, is when he tries terrorizing a poor community that has managed to avoid the wrath of an evil cabal called the ""Axe Gang"", in order to IMPRESS said gang. He calls for a challenger to step forward and to take him on, and he warns them ""No cheating!"" He calls on a humble lady farmer and dares her to hit him in the stomach, which she does, doubling him over immediately. Recovering from that, he starts picking at random...first a fella he refers to as ""Shorty"", who turns out to be about 7 feet tall when he stands up from his sitting position. After reminding the crowd ""No cheating!"", he then calls out a mousy looking guy with glasses, asking him to step forward. He does so, exposing a physique all out of character to his nerdy face. He then scans to what looks like a seven year old boy, who steps out, ALSO revealing a Charles Atlas-like upper torso! Fed up, (and completely cowardly,) he moves on.

There is one very poetically done scene involving two hitmen who don't work in the ordinary way...and this is where a major fantasy element joins the cartoon zaniness: In the still of a nearly cloudless night, two assassins hired by the Axe Gang seek to take out the brave inhabitants of Pig Sty Village, who have stood up to their terror. These assassins use a long, autoharp-type instrument to strum out very sino-fiendly chords that somehow manage to produce lethal weapons and figures out of thin air. They set these against the tailor, the baker and the landlady, the tailor and the baker having surprised you earlier with their kung fu expertise...with images of flying sabers, armored zombies and spears. The landlady manages to take them out with her patented ""Lion's Roar"", sending them whee-wee-wee, all the way home!

If you buy but ONE kung fu movie in your life, make it this one! This is, hands down, the funniest, most enjoyable martial arts movie I've seen so far, and I've seen all of Bruce Lee's major releases!",1132272000,2,3397,4.609917355371901
2316921,3,B0009S4IHY,"The official release here is 3 equivalent ($5.50?), but the eventual pirate release will be 1/3 of that (ahem). Money better spent, in my opinion - on other fare. Apart from the bemusement of seeing the local tenants somewhat incredulously thrash the hide off the baddies, and the recurring theme of the near-indestructible chain-smoking landlady, the film is just one lengthy fight-fest, a Chinese comic (literally) equivalent of a more violent Steven Seagal or JC van Damme brawl. Once you've seen one flying kick and wire-assisted swoop, you've seen them all. There are some nice CGEs and comic touches, but it's hardly belly-laugh territory.  Probably comes across better on the big screen than a small one, as the studio localised set becomes a bit restrictive, and tedious to view continuously, albeit with different lighting effects and slow-mo. Others have mentioned borrowings from other films, but I betcha Mr Chow saw ""The Mask"" at some stage beforehand. Conclusion: A cinema version of ""having a Chinese"", - reasonably tasty initially, but eventually unsatisfying, and not really worth going back for seconds either.",1131753600,,1128,5.266666666666667

I thought it surpassed Lord of the Rings in action and imaginative and special effects, which I thought was fantastic.

Then what a pleasant surprise to meet Sing... what a great character! The movie exceeded all of my expectations and I hated to see it end.  Stephen Chow is brilliant.",1130803200,2,484,4.5813953488372094
2316924,5,B0009S4IHY,"For the most part, I like my martial arts films to be as realistic as possible, but I have no problem taking a walk on the cinematic wild side, especially when the special effects are as impressive as those in this film.  Kung Fu Hustle can't be compared to any other single movie or genre.  Regardless of its excesses, the martial arts action in the film is something to behold.  Underneath all of the comedy and over-the-top visual delights (and it can be almost cartoonish at times), there's also a seriousness to the film.  It's all about good vs. evil, self-realization, and stepping up to meet your destiny.  And, as much as I hate to say it, I thought the ending was quite sweet.  The extraordinary special effects dominate the film and any viewer's discussion of it, but don't let that fool you into thinking there isn't a substantive story behind all of the flash.

The toughest hombres around are the members of the Two Axe Gang; put a Japanese face on John Dillinger, give him a pair of axes, and you've the old-time mobster look and feel of these guys down.  They usually leave the slum areas alone, but Pig Sty Alley, run by a seemingly wimpy landlord and the toughest landlady you'd ever want to meet, ends up in the gang's crosshairs thanks to a couple of bad guy wannabes (and perpetual screwups) trying to insinuate themselves into the gang.  Sing (Stephen Chow) desperately wants to be a bad guy, having paid a price as a child for trying to live up to his destiny (a rather questionable one, at that) of bringing peace to the world.  The landlady's mean attitude isn't enough to hold off untold dozens of axe-wielding gangsters, but the town is saved by three kung fu masters who had moved there in search of a peaceful life.  Rest assured there are repercussions, as the Two Axe Gang brings in some of the world's most deadly killers to exact revenge - starting with a pair of musicians with a unique, decidedly deadly playing style.  Later, they have Sing engineer a breakout of the Beast, the deadliest killer of them all.  He doesn't look like much, but the Beast is an almost unstoppable force.  The only person who can possibly take him on with any chance of success is a natural-born, kung fu genius - and those are pretty darn rare.

The special effects of the many fight scenes go way beyond the kind of wire work seen in, say, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and also out-Matrix The Matrix; on occasion, you'll see stuff right out of Hanna-Barbera cartoons.  Does this make the movie too goofy for its own good?  Somehow, it really doesn't.  If you're going to go to the extreme with your action, you might as well go all the way - and that is most certainly what Kung Fu Hustle does.  From a chase right out of Road Runner cartoons to the perfectly ridiculous Toad Style of fighting perfected by the Beast, you'll laugh - but you'll also be in awe at how well the scenes play.

Basically, Kung Fu Hustle is just a complete hoot of a movie.  As writer, director, and star, Stephen Chow has produced a pure winner capable of entertaining fans across a range of genres.  Even he cannot steal the limelight from Leung Siu Lung, however, as this landlady, with a cigarette perpetually hanging out of her mouth, truly roars - both literally and figuratively.",1130544000,2,3282,4.555366269165247

Special effects dominate the movie but don't intrude, leaving an oddly believable style of action behind (floating characters, super strength punches, puffed-up breasts).

Wild martial arts, genuinely funny comedy (which is really pretty rare in this genre), and at least one scene that if pure cinematic brilliance... really, one of the most extraordinary moments I've ever seen on film. If you've seen this movie, you probably know what I'm talking about. If you haven't all I can say is: when you hear haunting music, don't... look... away. Great stuff.

2316929,5,B0009S4IHY,"I read a few reviews of Kung Fu Hustle before deciding to buy it. They were universal in their praise but probably failed to capture the full charm of the film. The opening is a bit disconcerting in its brutality. I thought, 'oops!', but advise viewers to hang on in there - it only lasts about 5 minutes but it is enough to ensure we know the depths of depravity and evil of the bad guys. The film then moves into its true tale - one of appearances being deceptive and that fame of the sort sought by the hero is illusion. The film uses obvious symbolism. The hero is a loser who wants to join the bad boys' Axe Gang, but he has such innate goodness that all his endeavours to become foul enough to belong fail. He does, however, have one talent they need and this talent allows him to join the gang.

The slum where much of the action takes place has a kind of lunatic charm, ruled by the most awful landlady and her comic husband, it and they are another case of the deceptive nature of appearances. Our hero eventually comes into his own becoming a hero we can all enjoy - truly magnificent!

There are references to other films, which do not detract from the delight we take in this happily ever after story, in fact I take a particular pleasure in noting influences, 'Matrix' and even old 'Monkey Magic' touches.

Virtue is rewarded and the bad guys suitably punished and all is well with the world. One leaves the film with a lighter step and laughter in your heart - not a bad mood to enjoy!",1128729600,10,1499,4.289752650176679

The fights are original and exaggerated, which is perfect from the typical fighting found in most action films. The Landlady has to be one of the funny but annoying characters ever.

I gotta say, my expectations for this movie were great, but in some ways I felt let down after watching it. I was expecting more comedy, which started to wane toward the end (pardon if this sounds like a spoiler please). The film might take repeated viewings to grab your interest and get the humor.

2316934,5,B0009S4IHY,"Fresh from the worldwide triumph of Shaolin Soccer, Stephen Chow surpassed its critical and commercial success with Kung Fu Hustle. He took the winning formula he perfected with his previous film and elevated it to a more ambitious scale. He also wisely decided to have Sony distribute his movie in North America instead of Miramax who notoriously bungled the release of Soccer. The results were a modest success because, unlike Miramax, Sony knew how to market Chow's movie.

As he did with Shaolin Soccer, Chow uses CGI in very clever ways to express his ideas visually. The action sequences play out like live action Looney Tunes cartoons as he playfully pokes fun at over-the-top, pretentious action spectacles like The Matrix: Reloaded. Kung Fu Hustle is bursting at the seams with one hilarious visual gag after another. In one scene, Sing is chased by a grumpy, bossy peasant woman and they chase each other through the countryside like Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. Chow understands that the enjoyment in watching his movies is reveling in the visual spectacle of them. His movie has the visual inventiveness of ten movies.

Kung Fu Hustle is a movie about other movies. It playfully quotes from such diverse movies as Spider-Man and The Untouchables. One of the pleasures of watching this movie is to see what film it references next. Meanwhile, Kung Fu Hustle continues to top itself with one breathtaking action sequence after another, each one building up to the penultimate showdown. Chow's movie is so eager to please, such an unabashed celebration of movies that it makes the ones that come out of Hollywood every year look boring and outdated in comparison.

There is an audio commentary by Stephen Chow, actor Lam Tze Chung, Axe Gang advisor Tin Kai Man and actor Chan Kwok Kwan. If you're reading the subtitles of this track it is near impossible to figure out who's talking and so you just have to go along with it in the hopes that some relevant information will appear on screen. They go into detail about the filmmaking process in this informative and engaging track.

""TV Special - Behind the Scene of Kung Fu Hustle"" is a 42 minute look at how this movie came together hosted by two of the film's stars. This is an entertaining and well-made featurette that is a step up from the usual fare that populates DVDs.

There are two deleted scenes that feature the residents of Pig Sty Alley trying to convince the two kung fu masters to save them and more footage of Sing's initiation into the Axe Gang.

""Ric Meyers Interview with Stephen Chow"" is a nice conversation between the two men. He talks about some of the cinematic influences on this movie as he comes across as a very smart and articulate fellow.

Also included is an ""Outtakes and Bloopers"" reel that is a very funny collection of blown lines.

There is also an impressive collection of 15 TV spots!

2316946,5,B0009S4IHY,"Stephen Chow wrote, directed, and starred in this entertaining adventure, a cinematic ensemble of interesting and unique characters.  I haven't seen a martial arts film this good in a long time.  In my opinion, this was like the movie Grease without the singing and dancing, although there was some dancing.  I picture wedding parties doing the axe-gang dance all over the world.  In fact, I think an axe-gang dance video would be a big seller!  Workout tapes could follow.

  From the opening scenes of the movie, where a gang leader takes out his anger and frustration on the local police department, to the rolling of the credits, Stephen Chow and his cast of dedicated actors have put together one of the best comedies ever.

  But Kung Fu Hustle is not just a comedy.  It's a story with a message, a message about doing what's right, even if that means you are going to take a few lumps, serious lumps!  And what makes the movie so much fun is that director Stephen Chow knows when to jump back and forth between the serious and the not-so-serious scenes in this movie.

  Chow's character, Sing, is best described as a gangster wanna-be who has a long series of failures in this film.  But we never stop wondering exactly what he will screw up next, and when he becomes entangled in a bit of gang warfare, his ridiculous antics rise in their comedic value.  There is a scene where Sing demonstrates his knife throwing ability that had me literally crying I was laughing so hard.  Stephen Chow is a natural on the movie screen.

  Some of the clashes between the people of the besieged slum and their attackers are so visually stimulating that I shall never forget them.  When the two harpists come to kill the defenders of the slum, we are witnesses to some amazing cinematic treasures, as the special effects are top-notch.  Famed action choreographer Yuen Wo Ping goes beyond the call of duty in Kung Fu Hustle, working both the realistic approach to fight scene creation and the ""hey, nobody-could-ever-do-that"" sequences.  That unique tactic made the film stand apart from almost anything I have ever seen before.

  I think Stephen Chow is a genius, and I am going to go rent Shaolin Soccer as soon as possible!  I highly recommend Kung Fu Hustle.  It is a great movie!

Think early Jackie Chan meets the Matrix.

The classic ""bad guy"" makes good scenario is worked to great effect, with state of the art CGI and live action wire work to make an audio visual treat that doesen't take itself too seriously.

The battle scenes are excellent, if over the top in places. This works because both the makers and the audience know it is overboard, that is what makes the film such great fun.

Most action/scifi fans should have their eyes and ears peeled for some subtle and not so subtle homage to the best films in the field.

Serious martial arts fans may not appreciate it, but it is intended for a wider audience.

I found it a visually stunning treat, the story is plausibly consistent, given the film has already marked its territory as a comedy.

Because I fell asleep the first I missed alot of storyline and when I woke back up, I didn't think it was that great, but I gave it another chance and really enjoyed this movie.  It is dubbed in English or you can just read subtitles, but you will miss a lot of the movie while you are reading.  The actions is great and made to be over done but that's what makes this movie cool.  It's like watching a cartoon knowing that real people would never survive half the things that happen to the people in this movie, but we accept it because it is funny to see what happens to them, just like in a cartoon.  I didn't care too much for the axe gang dancing around, I thought that was kinda dumb, but I did really enjoy this movie.  Check it out.",1127260800,,945,4.048387096774194
2316950,5,B0009S4IHY,"Stephen Chow has done a remarkable job in putting together a film that is stripped down to the essentials necessary to tell a remarkable story with a touch of both comedy and dramatic flair. The coreographed combat scenes are simply gorgoeus while not seeming at all out of place. I have watched this film twice now, and intend to watch it several times more. It tells a story that has been done to death - the ""chosen one"" style of kung-fu movie, but does it with such flair and panache that it's easy to fall in love with it. Rather than dwell on the mystical or get lost in the glory of computer graphics, Kung Fu Hustle manages to use all of these elements to advance a very simple and elegant story of redemption.

If you get this film, thinking that your kids liked Shaolin Soccer and you want to give them something fun to watch, you should screen it first just to be sure that it's appropriate for them, as the feel of this movie is completely different than the neutered ""American"" cut of Shaolin Soccer.

There was also alot of comedy which I enjoyed. Overall I'd say this is a must have.,1126828800,,415,4.333333333333333
2316953,4,B0009S4IHY,"When I saw the foreign language DVD from Hong kong when the movie itself wasn't even in theaters, I knew I had to see in the big screen and luckily Netflix invited to a free advance screening.
I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this movie. It is a good mix of action-fantasy, comedy, mysticism and crime caper. I have seen a lot of foreign films from asia and I have to say this film is among my favorites.
The movie is not just a action wacky comedy, at times it shows its soul, and delivers a good message to audiences: Everyone deserves a second chance, and do not underestimate your own true potential. Stephen Chow really does have a profound respect for KUNG-FU. It has the humor of looney tunes and the dark humor of Quintin Tarantino films. The movie reveals the hidden mysticism of Kung-Fu, I for one do not like movies with too much wire work, with exaggerated fight scenes but this was done decently, YUEN WOO-PING(KILL BILL, THE MATRIX, HERO) is an excellent fight choreographer. Those fighting styles really does exist in Martial arts, however a bit exaggerated. I've seen SHAOLIN MONKS do perform the Buddhist Palm, the toad technique, the five shaolin kicks etc. The movie does praise the Chinese Martial Arts at the same time adapted it to a very entertaining screenplay.
The story is about people who live in the poorest part of the city, who unintentionally gets mixed up with the foremost crime gang at the time, the Axe gang. The criminals got more than they bargained for when they had to deal with 5 Masters who only wanted to live in peace. There is also death and despair but I don't want to spoil it for anyone else. To sum it up, near the end, a true KUNG-FU master was revealed.
The fight scenes were humorously great and the last battle with the ultimate killer was short but awesome. Yeh-Baby!! The CGI effects was also pretty good and fits the atmosphere of the movie.
The bottom line is: ENJOY THE MOVIE, you are in for quite a RIDE. This is not a movie for people who think they can only appreciate intelligent movies. I saw it 5 times and I haven't gotten tired of it.
The dvd quality is great. It contains bothe subtitled and Dubbed versions. However, I prefer the movie with subtitles. The script is much more effective than the Dubbed version. Picture and sound quality are outstanding!!",1126828800,3,2326,4.5536992840095465

The references to other movies were so pathetic:  The Untouchable reference - ""What are you preparing to do"" should be ""What are you prepared to do"", the english subtitle translator should have actually done their job properly and learnt english. The - Gone with the Wind reference - standing in front of a Gone with the wind movie poster is not a reference.

Scenes like the road runner scene were so pointless and stupid and irritating.

2316977,5,B0009S4IHY,"This is by far, the most exciting and one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen.
However, it is a funny cartoonish movie. So those very few who only want to see real kick or think heroes should always act cool may find this is not the move for them.

I'm going to give few of my points about how serious this movie is made, behind its funny and cartoonish look.

1. Story line is easy to follow and easy to understand, but actually its structure is more complicate than most people thought. The story is composite by three parts: The conflict between Axe Gang and Pig Alley, the Sing's story and the love story between Sing and the mute girl. The Axe Gang and pig alley part is straight forward, but the Sing's part is backward by recall his past little by little. And the hearty love story pined 3 parts together and gives the ending. Very clever and well constructed.

2. The director use camera to explain details rather than just speak out by actor/actress. For example, when the two musician assassins first tuning their instrument, you notice small things in surrounding start to ""off"", and as the music goes to intense, you realize the potential of its power.  Most movies today has some one like Q in James Bond series to reveal you those gadgets, this movie does not do the same.

3. Music in the movie is well composed. It tells the story too. Take the Axe Gang music for example, there is some thing sounds like people laughing. This music is played every time when Axe Gang appears. At the beginning of movie, it feels like the Axe Gang are very success and laughing at others. But when they are defeated by two masters and Brother Sum's hair is on fire in the midle of the film, the music sounds extremely funny like laughing at themselves.

There are many more than this, but you can find clues in other reviews. So this is all I want to say.
Oh, and don't forget to select original Chinese language, the sound actors of English language don't perform well in my opinion. So leasten to Chinese is better since the camera will guide you most of the time, and the subtitle is easy to read.",1126051200,3,2109,4.408740359897172
2316978,2,B0009S4IHY,"Kung Fu Hustle is a really cheezy movie, with a bunch of badly acted stereotype characters. The Voiceover work is horrible, and only barely can be interpreted as being the same dialogue as the subtitles show (and probably even worse from the original chinese).

Despite claims to the contrary, it is not 'Crouching Tiger meets Looney Tunes'. The plot is nowhere as complex as a Bugs Bunny cartoon, there are scenes that seem to have nothing to do with the plotline at all, and some of the characters (especially the gay characters) are so ridiculously inslulting as to annoy me to an extreme. The Kung Fu was also pretty bad, the over use of wire work for humor side downright boring, and the reasoning behind what was going on even more ridiculous.

There's a point where funny becomes ludicrous and unacceptable... where I lose interest and can't regain it. This movie went there.",1125964800,3,882,4.758169934640523

2316980,4,B0009S4IHY,"Very funny, extremely silly, surprisingly violent with adult situations and a childrens fairy tale-like ending.  I liked it enough to watch it twice at the theatre.  Though I rarely watch movies twice, especially at the theatre, I knew my kid would love this.  So I forked over the wad and enjoyed it again!

My eleven year old loved it.  The violence is cartoon-like except at the very beginning when the director is demonstrating how mean the gang is.  They shoot a frightened women in the back with a shotgun after they tell her they would never harm a female.  Of course, that is after they hack her boyfriends legs off with an ax and then finish the job in front of her.  Very funny stuff!

The story is a combination of Kung Pow (by the way 'Betty' is the landlords husband) and the cartoon called Dragon Ball Z.  The good guys find better heros and the bad guys find badder rascals to fight the good guys heroes.  Eventually, there is the ultimate battle which is truly climactical!  The fight scenes were amazing to watch.  Very clever, energetic, creative, silly and fun.  Each battle gets successively better!

It really works well because the characters are outlandish and colorful, yet sympathetic and real.  For example, one of the heroes is a cigarette-puffing landlady with a special power.  Another good guy is a drapery maker, who's fighting skill is related to his occupation.  I was drawn into their strange lives.

The movie actually had a non-hollywood (Asian?) ending, which I guess was meant to teach a lesson or moral.  The good guys win!  It brings the movie full-circle and certainly made that first scene less important and gave the movie a fairytale ambience that I mentioned I liked in the first paragraph.  Feel free to reread it if you like.  Just kidding!  The ending made it possible for me to bring my eleven year old to see this ""R"" rated movie.

I guess I should give it five stars.  But, there were a couple of scenes that seemed a little odd and it would have been better (for me) if the movie did not have subtitles.  Regardless, I highly recommend this entertaining film.",1125705600,,2111,4.635135135135135

It didn't turn out to be quite that, but I'm not saying I was disappointed in the film, it just wasn't exactly what I thought it would be.  What it is, though, is a very enjoyable, amusing film that can be outrageously silly at times, and genuinely heartfelt at others, managing each with a refreshing ease.

2316982,5,B0009S4IHY,"I am a devoted and long time fan of Hong Kong action movies and pleased to report that Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle is the best of the hundreds I have seen since the early 1970's. Chow's film is at once a loving tribute to and canny summary of the past 35 years of Chinese martial art cinema. KFH is also hysterically funny and the one kung fu DVD I'd gladly show to someone who was not a fan of the genre. The film is beautifully shot and cleverly scripted. It contains old school fight choreography along with marvelous wire-work stunts and up-to-the-minute CGI effects. The cast, mostly unknowns or lesser players in Chinese cinema, is a pure joy and includes several bona fide kung fu masters in key roles. There is really nothing in Chow's previous films that would hint he is capable of creating such a wonderful entertainment. If you didn't see this one in the theaters, stop reading and buy this DVD now.

Note 1: Despite the R rating, I'd be willing to show this gem to pre-teens. With the exception of the first few minutes, the violence is either wildly cartoonish or standard action film fare.

Note 2: As with almost all foreign language films, I recommend watching it in its original language with English subtitles even if an English language track is available. Dubbing is just too damned distracting and can ruin a good movie like this one.",1125532800,10,1358,4.584362139917696

2316985,5,B0009S4IHY,"When I think about pure entertainment I'm not necessarily thinking about a traditional comedy.  Rather, I think about a feeling I get when I'm sitting there and watching outrageous actions on the screen and I'm constantly giggling.  Such is the delight of Kung Fu Hustle, a brainchild of Stephen Chow from Hong Kong who wrote, directed and stars in this rather outrageous spoof of martial arts movie.  He's also captured the spirit of American cartoon characters, the ones that get hit on the head with a hammer and come up smiling, or whose legs turn into a roadrunner in order to flee disaster.  This is the stuff that this 2004 film is made of - a rare piece of clever entertainment.

The plot revolves around a group of poor but hardworking people who live in Pigsty Alley.  However there just happen to be three accomplished martial artists in their midst.  One is a tailor.  One is a hen-pecked husband.  And one is a matronly woman in a shapeless housedress and curlers who always has a cigarette dangling from her mouth.  Into this neighborhood comes our star, Stephen Chow and his chubby sidekick.  They pretend they belong to the Axe Gang so that they can shakedown the people for a little money.  They're stopped cold in their tracks though.  And soon there is more than only the three unlikely martial artists of Pig Sty Alley they have to contend with.  There's the real Axe gang itself.

The action never stops and the story plays out with outrageous martial arts scenes enhanced by the use of modern technology, concealed wires, and special effects.

On the negative side, the film did drag a bit though, especially near the end when the jokes had already worn thin.  But I think just a few more feet on the cutting room floor would be all it needs.

Kung Fu Hustle is a rare treat.  I definitely recommend it.",1125446400,,1825,4.611801242236025

2316997,5,B0009S4IHY,"While I was watching and thoroughly enjoying Stephen Chow's film ""Gong fu"" (""Kung Fu Hustle""), I was also trying to think of the best cinematic reference point that would succinctly explain what is really going on beyond what we see on screen. That would be Pig Sty Alley, a slum in Shanghai that is run by a landlady (Qiu Yuenm who I defy any viewer to recognize from ""The Man With the Golden Gun"") who does absolutely everything with a cigarette dangling from her lips. There are gang wars going on all around them, but the Axe Gang, the biggest and baddest bunch around, ignore Pig Sty Alley because there is no money to be made there. This is just as well because if anybody causes trouble in that neighborhood it turns out that there are not one, or two, or even three, but four kung fun masters. This is discovered by Sing (Chow), a would-be gangster who figures he can impress the Axe Gang by what he does in Pig Sty Alley. But things go very poorly for him and his would be employers visit to clean up his mess. This precipitates a great deal of martial arts action.

At the height of the action in this 2004 film it suddenly hit me that the movie it most reminded me of was ""The Princess Bride."" The key commonality between the two is the inherent sense of joy that infuses both films. This is not a spoof in the ""Airplane!"" tradition, but more of a humorous homage along the lines of ""A Mighty Wind,"" where you have to get it right at the same time you are making your comic points. You might be able to reduce ""Gong fu"" down to a combination of karate and slapstick, but you have to grant that Chow has to get both parts right, which is why this works. The comedy is integrated as well as the wirework, which is why I found this film so utterly enjoyable. The goal is to have fun and it is well met here.

The more you know the conventions of the genre the more you can appreciate how Chow's film plays with them, especially with the revenge of the supporting characters mentality that is at play. One of the reasons I thought ""Spider-man 2"" was the best comic book superhero movie made to date was because of the match up between Spider-man and Doctor Octopus allowed the fights to exist in three dimensions; fighting on the side of a building or a subway is not a problem for those two. I think ""Gong fu"" has a similar advantage and perhaps the simple idea that the action here is three-dimensional explains why the look of films like ""The Matrix"" and ""Wo hu cang long"" have become a cinematic rage in terms of special effects. Here we are in the early days of the 21st century and perhaps it is because of the advances in CGI that wirework comes across as still being quite impressive, even the two of them are mixed the way they are here.

If anything, Chow's film is a Kung Fu fantasy. Reality starts to be displaced when wirework is involved, and here the judgment as to what action choreographers Sammo Hung Kam-Bo and Woo-ping Yuen can come up with that looks good on camera. If it looks good, then do it. Without conventional restraints Chow can make things bigger, culminating not only in the Lion's Roar through a speaker but the really big imprint of the hand of power. The paradigmatic scene for me in ""Gong fu"" is when all of the kung fu masters emerge to take on the two harpists, named Harpist No. 1 (Kang Xi Jia) and Harpist No. 2 (Hak On Fung), who pluck strings on their large instrument to send swords (and worst) hurtling towards our heroes. I would give credit to the kung fu masters, but part of the fun here is finding out who they are. This might not be a great film, but it is certainly great fun, so much so that the best thing I can say about it is that people who do not like kung fu movies should enjoy and be impressed by this one.",1125100800,3,3773,4.296348314606742
2316998,4,B0009S4IHY,"Imagine a movie with the over the top action stylings of a Jackie Chan film but a funnier script.  No, scratch that; how about a clever martial arts cartoon fleshed out with live action and a little CGI?  As soon as I saw this I realized that I've been unconsciously yearning for this weird combination of the ridiculous and the impressive. Kung Fu Hustle is long overdue.

Kung Fu Hustle is a bona fide comedy.  It has an original plot, action, and jokes that don't reference any other particular movie.  What's more, it would seem that filmmakers have finally discovered how to use CGI to simulate cartoon action in a live action movie (who even knew that would ever  be called for? And yet...).  This is an entirely new category of martial arts film, deserving of its own evaluation apart from spoofs like Kung Pow.

The story is basically the universal archetype of poor people being oppressed by a powerful but corrupt man, and an unlikely hero emerging out of nowhere to save the day.  That much is old hat, I will admit.  And I'm not sure that I'd go so far as to say that the entire film is good, because it does drag on in spots.  On the whole, though, I found myself enjoying it and being continually surprised by the irreverent tone, the sometimes silly humor and the very entertaining fight scenes.

If you like your kung fu movies straight and serious, this one might seem silly.  But I think that's its odd charm, so I will give it a solid four stars and call it a good pick for a contrarian in a lighter mood.

LMAO ! Eccentric and zany - best film since the Gods must be crazy and lock stock and two smoking barrels... Action comedy without borders as every culture watching this can relate..,1125100800,2,481,5.259740259740259
2317000,5,B0009S4IHY,"Very, very funny movie with plenty of dazzling fight scenes and incredible sound!  I have not heard sound this precise in a movie in a long time.

A few new faces who do a fantastic job and ideas that are so unique and refreshing that it puts a smile on your face.

Nothing western film makers could ever pull off, which is why it is a must see!  Motion pictures have gone down hill in the US for years except for a few gems like I, Robot, The Last Samurai, What Dreams May Come, and the Kill Bill series, among a select few others.

This slump we have had has forced Westerners to take a look at a lot of foreign films, and guess what?  We love them!  You can account some of that success to the fact that American Politics/PC seem to be absent from these films.  And that's a good thing, to be sure.  But most of it comes from the beauty...the ambience of these films.

Sadly though, a lot of Westerners miss a lot of what is supposed to be experienced from these films.  But I say just laugh at them and be glad that you have the capacity to enjoy it!

So yeah, you can't watch this movie in English.  It ruins the entire movie, as is the case with most foreign films.  Again, DO NOT BE TOO LAZY TO READ!  It's worth it times ten to just read the subtitles :)",1124928000,4,1262,4.073170731707317
2317001,4,B0009S4IHY,"I saw this movie in the theaters twice and loved it both times. It has a lot of comedy, tight graphics, and even though it does have subtitles you get used to them afterwhile. Definitely one of the best comedy/action moives that have come out recently.",1124928000,,252,4.5
2317002,2,B0009S4IHY,"I know I'm in the minority on this, but I was VERY disappointed by this move. I had seen Shaolin Soccer, another supposed comedy, and found it mildly amusing at times, but overall a let down. After all of the hype for this film, I thought maybe Chow had improved, so I gave it a shot - I was let down again. The problem with these films is that Chow can't resist inserting flat out unfunny violence and sadism that completely takes you out of a comedy mind frame, and it takes a long time before you can start laughing again. The opening sequence is one example, it is absolutely not funny watching someone hacking repeatedly at someone with an axe, neither is it funny to have a character shot in the back with a shotgun, even if they get blown out of their clothes. Some may say that this is to make you understand how evil the gang is, but at no other time in the movie do they come off as anything other than clowns, so this just hurts the film. There are other moments, but it basically comes down to Chow not being sure whether he wants to make a cartoon or a real kung-fu film. This is definitely a very original film and by the end it does redeem itself somewhat, but the humor is rarely very funny. This is definitely the last Stephen Chow film I will ever see.",1124841600,4,1270,4.209016393442623

It should have been in theaters much longer. Steven Chow has captured the light Charlie Chaplin,Buster Keaton,Mack Sennett,Preston Sturges,Howard Hawks and so many other early screwball directors had and even the zaniness of the Warner Brothers Cartoons. What a great time at the movies. I highly recommend it.",1124755200,2,475,5.2631578947368425
2317004,4,B0009S4IHY,"What do you get if you blend a Jackie Chan movie, a Warner Brothers cartoon, the Matrix's wire work, some odd dance numbers involving men carrying axes, and a huge cast of Chinese martial artist actors?  I don't know, but it probably looks a lot like Kung Fu Hustle.

If you're reading the above, you're probably figuring this sounds pretty lame.  In a way, it is.  But the entire movie is executed in such a way that you almost don't care that there's no story.  There is a ton of action, in the form of kung fu fights and Matrix-style wire work that lends a ""much larger than life"" aspect to it all.  There is quite a lot of humor (some of it perhaps unintentional) in the less-than-stellar acting, the Warner Brothers cartoon-style chase scene between the landlady and the young con artist, some great effects of ""nearly invisible"" flying knives, and some dance numbers that seem a bit out of place but somehow just ""work"" in the movie.

I found myself laughing out loud at several parts, and finding it very hard to take my eyes off the screen (kind of like that natural need to look at a train wreck).

I'm not sure I can explain why, but I think this may be one of the coolest and most interesting movies I've ever seen.  It's campy in places, flat-out weird in places, plain silly at times, and yet somehow it all works and becomes a true work of art.  My advice for someone watching this for the first time is to pretend it's a cartoon from overseas, played with live human actors.  This should put you in the right frame of mind to enjoy it.  Don't look for character development, a fleshed-out plot, or for parts of it to make any sense at all.  Just enjoy it.

I had such an incredibly good time watching this that I have to give it about an 8.5 out of 10 (where 10 is excellent).  I'd rented it from Netflix, but I think I'll be buying it after I send it back.  It's that entertaining...",1124755200,2,1899,4.322033898305085
2317005,5,B0009S4IHY,"First up this review is a very different review i will not be describing the story here but rather more of my points of views of stephen chow and his vision...

Having seem Stephen Chow's previous comdey films(hong kong films) i must admitt he's surprises me more as an director with in depth vision eastern traditions and all that is good from the chinese culture than just a comdian actor...  Since Shaolin Soccer which i absolutely loved he yet again produced another delightful film...

I think he and the director for hero and house of flying dagger stands out of the group of chinese Actor/director trying to break into the western market, their approach is simple and pure almost all elements of the film is eastern, the chinese music, actors, story and action(kung fu), this is an aspect i admire about these actor/director becos its what it is and not purposely packaged for the western market... these films are made to reveal how the eastern world is, its rich chinese cultures and its customs... on the contrary, jackie chan and jet lee's films are designed for the western audience(which is fine) but loses its some of its orenital qualities...

Stephen chow brings out all the great things chinese, kung fu hustle is the result of his passion for the martial arts...the script is very well written unfortunately subtitles can never do justice to the original language, there are soo many gags and funny dialogues that just disappear in the subtitles... oh well what can you do.. learn chinese

being a chinese this film makes me feel good after watching it, its funny and touching not to mention at some stages totally crazy but its all what stephen chow whats to deliver ENTERTAINMENT...

2317008,5,B0009S4IHY,"I can't say enough about this film.  I grew up watching the Shaw Brothers and Golden Harvest films on the USA network every Saturday morning.  I was a seven year old captivated by the stories of the unlikely hero, the oppressed communities, and the reluctant masters.  Practically every classic Kungfu film follows these guide lines, but if you are a true fan, the topics never tire.  You love them because you share in there triumph over evil and their struggle in defending their true love.

And then came Kung Fu Hustle.

Stephen Chow has taken all of the plots and twisted them lovingly into hilarity.

It is a parody in which it is evident that it was made out of love for the genre.

The camera shots are crazy and the fight scenes are some of the best ever shot.

If you are a fan of the genre, do yourself a favor and buy this.  It will, without a doubt, become a favorite.",1124496000,,881,4.3496932515337425

2317010,5,B0009S4IHY,"This imaginative film is a slapdash collection of sight gags, jokes, serious kung fu, poor taste, and a love story.  Chow doesn't seem to be able to make up his mind what kind of movie he wants to make.  Instead, he gives us some of everything.

Thank goodness! This is not like any other movie you've ever seen.  One moment there will be a complex kung fu ballet, and the next moment two characters are chasing each other down the road like the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote.  It's confusing at times, but it's all fun.

You'll probably enjoy this flick more the second time you see it, because you'll have figured out who the heroes and villains are, and why they are doing what they are doing.  Chow proves there is a place for cheesy in action/humor/cartoon cinema.",1124409600,,770,4.457142857142857
2317011,5,B0009S4IHY,"As a majority of the other reviews state, this is a wonderful movie. Incredibly funny and innovative. Stephen Chow is a genius, be sure to catch other films he has both directed and starred in, such as Shaolin Soccer.

HOWEVER, if you watch this movie with English audio, you will NOT experience the movie everyone else loves so much. Watch it in Chinese with English subtitles first!

It's one thing to adjust the script so that the voice-over synchs up to the actor's mouth. It's another to COMPLETELY REWRITE the script. The people responsible for this dub should be blacklisted from the entertainment business. Not only is the voice-acting filled with horrible acting and lame accents that don't fit the characters, but they changed most of the dialogue and added things they thought would be ""funny."" The movie's original Chinese script, which is translated nicely in the English subtitles, is what you were intended to see. The English audio is like an amateur writer's attempt at making his own ""Kung Pow,"" by ""spicing it up"" with jokes they think are funny.

The changes made to the script in the English audio version are inappropriate. Not to mention that these changes will confuse the viewer (for example, the line ""Where's the car?"" was changed to ""Where's the limo?""... there were no limousines in the 1930-40's). Had the English voice actors simply read from the subtitles, it would be a tolerable way to watch the movie. But, the dubbers ""improvised,"" thinking their brand of cheesy accents and lame embellishments would appeal more to an American audience. And that is an insult to the audience's intelligence.

The original Chinese audio is superb, and the actors are wonderful. It doesn't matter if you speak Chinese, you'll get it, and you'll see the characters the way they were meant to be seen. The subtitles are simple and easy to follow. Do yourself a favor and pretend that this DVD didn't come with an English audio option.",1124323200,4,1950,4.882175226586103

However, there was one good thing about the first half-the battle scenes. They were great, but it only heightened my liking a small amount. Then there was the second half. More fighting, less dumb humor, and a lot more coolness, especially in the final fight. It was awesome. And I loved the ending, where the protagonist and the girl he knew for trying to save got together again, and married each other. I do think they'll be a grand couple. Though it was a good second half, there was just to much loser stuff and stupidity at the start for it to be one of my top movies. But, it  was OK overall, and I thought I'd hate it. Good thing I gave it a  chance to finish. This is the kind of movie you should see if you have nothing else to do(at least in my opinion).",1124323200,2,885,4.224852071005917

2317025,4,B0009S4IHY,"In 2004, Stephen Chow directed, co-produced, co-wrote and starred in the imaginative kung fu film named ""Kung Fu Hustle"".  The fictional story is set in China probably before the Japanese invasion in the city of Shanghai.  A ruthless black-suited gang, known as the Axe Gang, controls the police and spreads terror where ever it is in control.  It also thrives financially on casinos. However, the Axe Gang (and other less influential gangs) tend to ignore the poorest areas, including a little-known set of dilapidated apartments and shops known as Pig Sty Town.  Its landlord (Wah Yuen) and extremely loud landlady (Qiu Yuen) often fight with each other and make frequent calls and demands upon their poor renters.  One day, two men claiming to be part of the Axe Gang pass through Pig Sty Town.  The two men, Sing (Stephen Chow) and his sidekick (Chi Chung Lam) try to bully themselves with the poor Pig Sty Town residents, but are quickly thwarted by the noisy landlady.  In at attempt to call for help, Sing shoots a firework beyond the walls of Pig Sty Town and it happens to land upon the head of a real Axe Gang boss, who is traveling with a dozen or more black-suited gang members and immediately demand to know who attacked them.  Amazingly, three of Pig Sty Town's poor residents attack the gang with heroic kung fu fighting.  Angered, The Axe Gang leader, Brother Sum (Kwok Kuen Chan), hires two kung fu masters to attack Pig Sty Town.  He also makes Sing an offer: if he can prove himself by killing someone, he can join the Axe Gang; but Sing and his sidekick can't quite be as evil as they would like, especially when they encounter a mute young woman (Si Lu Ren?) and her ice cream stand.  Using an unusual stringed instrument filled with weapons, the two kung fu masters (Kang Xi Jia and Hak On Fung) attack the three poor Pig Sty Town residents that have superb martial arts skills, while the landlady screams at them from above to keep quiet.  The two kung fu masters are very good until they the landlord and landlady come out to confront them.  The Axe Gang then decides to recruit a very powerful kung fu master known only as The Beast (Hsiao Liang), who is located in a mental health asylum.  The Beast brings out the truth about who the landlord and landlady are, but Sing may discover things about himself as well.

With interesting kung fu choreography enhanced with computer-generated special effects and humor, ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is entertaining, but some people may find some parts of it a bit too violent.  If you enjoy kung fu films, then you will probably enjoy this entertaining kung fu fantasy by Stephen Chow.  Overall, I rate the film with 4 out of 5 stars.  Other interesting characters include Rabbit-Tooth Jane (Kai Shi Chen), Donut (Zhi Hua Dong), Coolie (Yu Xing), the Axe Gang Advisor (Kai Man Tin), the Tailor (Chi Ling Chiu), the Axe Gang Vice General (Suet Lam) and the Crocodile Gang Boss (Xiaogang Feng).",1124323200,,2949,4.66023166023166
2317026,5,B0009S4IHY,"Interestingly enough, my dad didn't want to watch this film because he thought it would be too similar to ""Kung Pow"", which, being the intellectual stalwart that he is, he found quite stupid.  I must admit that from the previews, I thought more or less the same thing(except that I liked ""Kung Pow""!).  How wrong I was!

It's very hard to categorize ""Kung Fu Hustle"".  While in many ways it plays like the classical kung fu ""chop sockey"" films of the early 70s (""Return of the Dragon"", ""Chinese Connection"", ""Drunken Master"", etc.), it's far more than that.  Imagine a blend of Jackie Chan's ""Drunken Master"", mixed with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""Kill Bill"", with a Road Runner cartoon thrown in for good measure.  It's pure entertainment.  The martial arts sequences are fast-paced and excellent, probably the best I've seen in a film since ""Hero"".  There are some great characters(i.e., the Landlady; and the musician assassins have one of the most compelling attacks I've seen in a movie in ages! You'll see what I mean...), and although it's quite violent in places, it also has its light moments, and humor.

My only criticism would be that the guy who's supposed to be the protagonist doesn't really get that much screen time, and he doesn't do anything remotely honorable or heroic until the very end.  I think writer Stephen Chow could have done a little more with his transformation from gutter slime to super-powered master of the Buddha's Palm.

Even if you are tired of Kun-fu movies you should be entertained by this movie. It has the style of an old black and white movie in some ways. It sort of reminded me of a Buster Keaton movie is some ways. I mean by the comedy, not the martial arts of course.

  You have a lady with curlers in her hair that can run as fast  as  the road runner and who's main power is her screaming. Also scrawny looking guys who are really great warriors.

This is not to say that director Stephen Chow's film is a collage of other styles because he adds some of his own original fluorishes to make this a highly original work.  The title of the film is kind of a paradox because it renders in your mind a polination of seventies Kung Fu and black exploitation films which may have partially influenced Chow but not wholly.  It would also be easy to characterize this film as a parody or a satire of martial arts films but Chow has such an affinity for those films that it holds it's own with them.  Chow hits a homerun here wearing the multiple hats of actor, director, and writer.  His script is rich with characterization and the story takes enough nifty twists that it would be a disservice to reveal them here.  Where he really excels is as a visualist in both action and art direction.  Before you can say, ""What was that?"", another imaginative sight penetrates the screen.

The story itself is a winner and even when the fight sequences go on a tad too long, stick with it because the payback is awesome. You'll howl at the ""axe-gang"" thugs and marvel at the digital and real life stunts that are shown. I actually think the subtitles added to the movie's humor and they were not bothersome at all.

2317047,5,B0009S4IHY,"...was my reaction as i was watching this.  For those tired of conventional ""by the numbers"" movies turned out on a regular basis, this is a high recommendation.  You'll recognize the standard elements of story-telling/movie-making, but appreciate the non-standard approach it takes torwards them.

What i really liked about this film and appreciate most from it:

* it has a tacked on love story interest, but it is barely there on screen.  it has more heart to it than most romantic movies and you actually kinda wished it was explored a little more(as opposed to most tacked on love sub-plots when you wish it wasn't even there).

* this is not an all-out comedy, but there are some really funny bits(the knife throwing scene, hair on fire scene, the calling all challengers out bluffing scene, etc).  some of the more subtle or verbal humor may be lost in the translation.  i strongly recommend watching the english-subtitled version for the humor(and the widescreen version for the visuals/action).

* the cgi efx range from 'very good hollywood stuff', to 'kinda amateurish'.  however, i felt that even the amateurish efx scenes worked out ok considering the cartoony nature of some of the scenes and the overall outlandishness of the film.  the cgi efx really add an element of fun to the proceedings rather than trying to make eveything seem ultra-realistic.  besides, if you watched this hoping to see an ILM showcase ...you're obviously watching the wrong movie.

* i was surprised by some of the overly-violent scenes in the film(in its defense though, it is R-rated, and some of the violence is rather cartoonish).  but i was even more pleasantly surprised at how much action/fighting there was.  this has more fights in it than some straight-foward action movies.  and the action choreography is very good as well.  it's not just all wire-work and cgi, there's some actual martial arts fighting with some really good kicks/weapons/hand to hand combat.

* i really liked the characters: the two main down-trodden buddies, the martial arts expert couple(the wife is a certifiable scene-stealer), the two instrument-playing assassins, and the head of the axe-wielding gang.  in fact, these characters were so likable/interesting that the main fault i had with the film was that some of them were not given enough screen time or development(was i the only one hoping the married couple would get in on the action for the last fight, or at least the last scene?).

Overall, you don't have to be a Stephen Chow fan, understand HK comedies, or enjoy kung fu films in general to enjoy KUNG FU HUSTLE.  But every little bit helps:-)  At worst, it makes for an interesting rental for that night that you just want to see something...er...different.  At best, it could be your next favorite quirky film that is a definite keeper.  I fall into the latter group.

That would be because the characters were interesting, it was really funny, and I cared about the characters.  I can't say that I feel the same way after watching ""Kung Fu Hustle.""  This movie had its moments, but overall I think that it was quite lacking.  The story could have been great, but they didn't do much with it.  I wished that they had done more with the Axe Gang, other than making them targets of the super-powered heroes.  Also, there was very little Kung Fu or Hustle in Kung Fu Hustle.  Firstly, there was only one scene of the axe gang and its leader dancing after a killing, and it was funny.  There is little actual Kung Fu, and I think that Steven Chow's idol Bruce Lee would be very disappointed by this film.  He relies too much on wire work a la The Matrix, giving the characters the powers making it uneccesary  to use much Kung fu.  I've seem more realistic fights in a Dragon Ball episode.  Also, the special effects seem a little bit messy, and aren't up to the quality you would see in a lot of hollywood films.

One example of a great visual is when one of our heroes is walking down a dark alley and we see a cat up on a wall.  As he walks by we see the cat jump out of frame, but if you watch its shadow on the wall you see it fall into two halves (and understand what that means) as a flying sword comes into frame.

2317069,5,B0009S4IHY,"I went and saw Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle in the theatre and I have to say it did not so much achieve my expectations as utterly defy and exceed them.

On Stephen Chow's films...

Stephen Chow is the master of Kung Fu Comedies. His distinctive style of absurd/cartoony violence and action sequences are portrayed in a world requiring a bit more suspension of disbelief than might normally be expected, but I assure you it's well worth the minimal effort. Shao-Lin Soccer, being perhaps the closest of Mr. Chow's movies in comparison to visual style with Kung Fu Hustle, pales in comparison to the action and computer assisted special effects we were offered up in this latest movie.

On general ballsy-ness...

I saw opening the movie with it's original Chinese soundtrack and English subtitles as a pretty ballsy move on the part of the producers and distributors.

Looking at the mainstream success of movies like Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon and HERO it might not seem like such a stretch, but you should also keep in mind that Kung Fu Hustle is being billed as an action/comedy. To my knowledge, no film in that genre has ever seen a general release to theaters in a foreign language and the great thing about this film is that it's meant for the general audience not an ""art house"" minority of critics and film snobs.

I was really praying for this movie to be well received at the box office in the U.S., but I'm sure Stephen Chow will be able to continue making his movies regardless of the outcome.

On director Stephen Chow's genius...

One of the visual storytelling devices that I wanted to comment on was at the end of the film. The climax of action and story had culminated and there was this heavy sense of what had just happened, then the film cuts to a scene outside a candy store where more resolution is going to take place and to wrap up some loose ends. In the midst of this dramatic heaviness we see a running gag, some guy with his butt hanging out of his pants, and the mood shifts back to comedy. The ease with which this final scene plays out is truly brilliant.

If you haven't seen it yet and are looking for something funny and different to pick up your spirits, I beg you to go see this movie and support the popularity of his films.

2317072,4,B0009S4IHY,"Frequently the cinema world frowns upon slapstick, as it is a simple and unintelligent form of comedy.  However, Stephen Chow utilizes this variety of comic approach in his Kung Fu Hustle (known as Gong Fu in Asia) to perfection.  Slapstick finally finds its true purpose besides smashing pots and pans on top of people's heads, or pulling away chairs from seating people.  Chow takes it one-step further by inventing the new Shaolin Kung Fu style Slapstick, which willfully and intentionally beats up the audience with bellyaching laughter.

""In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs run amuck"", is the opening description in regards to when the film takes place.  However, it is never clear exactly when, as periodically it feels mostly like the 1930s with moments from other time periods that are cleverly incorporated into the film.  The magic of cinema will remove the obstacle of time through Chow's creative fantasy approach and deliver a timeless journey into the small Pig Sty Alley where the story's heroes and crooks will converge in an epic comic battle of the kung fu fists and kicks.

The Ax Gang rules the city while the police eagerly count their bribes.  The only ones that are an exception to corruption are the most unfortunate who reside in the poverty-stricken areas.  One of these areas is the Pig Sty Alley where this story unfolds when Sing (Stephen Chow) and his cheerful follower Bone (Lam Tze Chung) deceptively enters under the fake identity as Ax Gang members.  Sing's fraudulent plan backfires when the inhabitants of the Pig Sty Alley decide to oppose them, which pulls the real Ax Gang into the poor neighborhood as well.  Fortunately for the inhabitants of the Pig Sty Alley some very skilled kung fu masters have withdrawn from public attention into this poor neighborhood.  Thus, when the Ax Gang arrives, they are in for a surprise that will rock the corrupt society.

The action is plentiful in Kung Fu Hustle to which some film critics has uttered dislike, but it is in the large amount of kung fu where the audience will discover an unpolished gem.  With the help of wire-fu, special effects and hilarious dialogues laughter will go through all its different gradients from muffled chuckles to full out laughing explosions.  It is within these fight scenes where the audience will uncover the crude jewel that ultimately will deliver a true cinematic gem through the admirable story line.

Stephen Chow's story resembles a lot with Ren Goscinny's and Albert Uderzo's comic book Astrix where one small village resists the whole Roman Empire.  The difference in Chow's film is mostly cultural, but it also has his own comic martial art touch to it.  There are also many spoofs on scenes from other films such as Matrix and some Spaghetti Westerns.  On top of the parody, Chow gives a full out slapstick assault to the kung fu genre that had its profound emergence in the 1970s.  Regardless of Kung Fu Hustle's similarities to other stories, Chow achieves an extraordinary film that delivers valuable messages such as forgiveness, honor, and love in the backdrop of a heavy dose of humor.",1123027200,5,3133,4.8977272727272725
2317073,5,B0009S4IHY,"I miss early Jackie Chan. Films like ""Drunken Master"" and ""Snake in Eagle's Shadow"". I also miss the absurd, like ""The Flying Guillotine"", ""Chinese Hercules"" (go Bolo!) and ""Lady Kung Fu"" (where she would blind her opponents with white powder from a side bag before yanking thier eyeballs out with her index & middle finers - yow!).

Thank God for Stephen Chow. ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is funny and a bit absurd, taking from ""The Gangs of New York"" and ""The Untouchables"" just to name a few, but manages to still have enough serious moments to satisfy fighting fans.

This is what Steve Odenkirk wanted to make with ""Kung Pow!"", and almost did. But Stephen Chow has the advantage of growing up in the same country where these films were made, so it's a different sort of insight.

What he doesn't know is that they are actually kung fu masters hidding thier identities, and when the real gang shows up to do the same, he sees this as an opportunity to proove himself, while he's caught in the middle.

 This movie, who is written and directed by Stephen Chow, is pretty much a live-action cartoon, but it takes the action very seriously. The action scenes were handled by renowned martial artist Yuen Wo Ping best known for his work  on the Matrix trilogy, so you know it's full of imagination, as well as some killer special effects. All the characters are hilarious too, especially the guy who, for some reason has his ass hanging out of his pants through-out the whole movie. As well as the man with the shaking man-boobs.

  I haven't laughed this hard in quite a while. Stephen Chow(Shaolin Soccer + God of Cookery) is bar none the funniest man working in movies today.

-- Better fights scenes than The Matrix

-- Better chase scenes than Roadrunner and Coyote

-- Better dialog than the Three Stooges

-- Better sets than The Honeymooners

The ""Axe"" gang moves into town, a bad-axe bunch with lines like ""I'm the bad guy!"" They attack the old order, en masse, with hatchets, tommy guns, tuxedos, and top hats. Once they control everything worth having, they move into the poor section, called the Pig Sty. People here make humble livings when they can, as a noodle chef, coolie, or foppish tailor raising the hem just a bit for Bucktooth Jane's attempts at selling herself (or offering short-term rentals).

They picked the wrong chef, laborer and - in their words - fairy. These men (more or less men, anyway) have mastered mysterious martial arts, and promptly kick the goobers out of a half-hundred or so bad guys. The first round of heroes falls, but more and stronger take their places. Watch The Landlady - watch her landing, especially, after she evades a truck in that road chase. Then watch her loud Capri pants in the penultimate fight against The Beast. The ultimate battle comes after that, but I'll leave it for you to discover.

I can't think when I last laughed that hard at a movie. It's a self-concious send-up of so many stereotypes I lost count of them all. Heck, I probably didn't even know what half of them were, in the Chinese idiom, but the satire was broad enough to enjoy anyway.

What you get it is a fantastic, quirky movie that is paradoxically trashy and pure fun at the same time. Knowing what to expect before viewing it should be underway, as it is a movie that not only defies gravity but the reasoning power of a logical brain. Folks, the story doesn't serve the characters to develop, but to thrust them into situations where they can demonstrate their powers and show it throughout outrageous fights, choreographed with perfection and finesse that you cannot help but drop your jaw, even if you have become numb and cynical over the years of post-""Matrix"", post-""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". In other words, not exactly a calibre to be nominated for this year's Oscar's ""Best International Movie"" award, but nonetheless should be and should also win because it is perfection. Like hamburger, instead of a five-star Texas steak, but the most delicious hamburger you'd ever had. It knows its stupid, but it is earnest, loving and delicate. This is kind of a film that you should appreciate for what it really is. However, it is not just your conventional kung-fu movie. Aside from the chaos and cartoon outlandishness that makes the film over-the-top and giddily energized to the max, there is an element of an operatic musical movie during its fight sequences because of the eloquence of the soundtrack and how it accompanies the moves of the characters so rightly, and sprinkles of an engaging and heartfelt, albeit predictable, romance halfway throughout the film.

Words does not do justice to the wonderment of seeing this film; just watch it, halt your brains, and enjoy. One of the best and enjoyable ""stupid"" movies in a very long time.",1115596800,6,2339,5.072727272727272
2317104,2,B0009S4IHY,"Wacky, stupid and overall unnecessary special effects. Great movie for kids that are 10, 11. If you're gonna do a kung fu movie, why do you have to involve fantasy elements? Why do they insist on doing this? I just don't get it. I admit its a pretty entertaining flick, but is not that great. Sorry, but Jackie chan is still number one.",1115424000,4,336,4.349206349206349
2317105,5,B0009S4IHY,"First, let me say that I am glad that Buster Keaton and Quentin Tarantino have finally teamed up. It's one of the things I've been waiting for for a while. I enjoyed ""Kung-Fu Hustle"" for the first two acts. The last act, however, falters when it tries to become one extended fight scene. Everything preceding that is like the old Looney Tunes cartoons, and the last act is full of delimbings and decapitations, and a ton of blood. I felt that the excessive violence, although a little too much when one character is bludgeoned so much that brain is exposed, was still entertaining and did not take the movie down or anything, like it may have in any other film. I really liked how the movie, although set in the 1930's , feels like it takes place in the 1800's. I loved the exterior shots and how the cars looked so bright they looked practically computer-generated. Some aspects of the film work well, others work wonderfully, and some work just alright. One scene in the film reminded me of ""Kill Bill"", and that is the battle sequence where one man faces about 100 guys, and he scares them all away. I have to say that this may be one of the best choreographed, best edited, best spoofing fil so far this year. It's not the best. It's not the worst. It's a very good movie.

Stephen Chow plays Sing, a Japanese man who apparently has no job, and wants to be a member of the Axe Gang, a group of toughs who swing axes and stick their victims in the most uncomfortable places. Sing's first place that he sets for a takedown is Pig Sty Alley, an impoverished section of China. It is run by a tough landlady who enjoys beating on her hubby, a cheating landlord who likes to give women ""Full body exams"". Sing attracts the Axe Gang to the Alley, and an 80 minute battle ensues.

See this film if you feel like watching an entertaining and thoroughly pleasing action-comedy-spoof.

It's a mobster movie like you've never seen before set around the 1930s. The Axe Gang wear nice, fancy black suits, and after killing some apparent foes in the beginning of the movie the credits show flashes of the ""tough"" gangsters doing a strange sort of dance in unison I couldn't help but chuckle at with unparalleled delight. At that point I knew this was going to be an interesting film and I was absolutely right. Legends with inhuman powers arise from the unlikeliest of people, crushing the Axe Gang's superiority and pride of being the ""bad-asses"" you should fear for your life from. They in turn hire countless assassins to wipe out an entire village but their attempts prove futile as the population contains more than just weak farmers and housekeepers... I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of ""Kung Fu Hustle"" (think Looney Toons meets Kill Bill) and recommend it to anyone who looks for odd, quirky movies that are also smart and creative, yet totally out there. The subtitles didn't even bother me as I find that most films in Chinese sound much better in the original language verses being horribly dubbed in English (ie-House Of Flying Daggers).",1115078400,85,1332,4.745689655172414
2317108,5,B0009S4IHY,"Shanghai, China, the 1930s.  The Axe Gang is taking over the town but is not interested in the poor slums. This leaves the residents of Pig Sty Alley to deal with their overbearing Landlady. One day, Sing (Stephen Chow) and his sidekick,  walk into the Alley and attempt to blackmail people there. When the residents of the tenement stand up to fight him, he reveals that he is part of the Axe Gang and signals for help. Gang members show up and the landlady and the tenement residents fight them off. The Axe Gang realizes that they have been called to help someone who is not a part of the gang, but Sing is desperate to become a member. Now that the gang and the residents of Pig Sty Alley have met, they can't back down from each other, fighting until one group is victorious. The leader of the Axe Gang realizes that he will not be able to fight them alone and brings in The Beast.

""Kung Fu Hustle"", written and directed by the star, Stephen Chow, is a fun, exhilarating, fast-paced film, borrowing elements from and paying homage to many other genres. Chow is clearly a filmmaker who loves films; he seems like a kid in a candy store. Now that he can make a film, how many different types of things can he get into the story? ""Hustle"" combines all of these elements in a way that is fresh and exciting.

The opening sequence is a homage to police interrogation films and westerns. When the opposing sides face off on a dusty road, we are transported from Shanghai to the Wild West. The sky turns magenta and everybody faces off, preparing for a classic gun fight. This scene is very theatrical, comical and sets the tone for the remainder of the film. Of course, we aren't in the Old West and the leader of the Axe Gang uses an axe to prove his point and keep us firmly rooted in the world of kung-fu.

The story is a framework for Chow to throw each and every trick in the book at the audience. After he introduces the Axe Gang, we then meet the residents of Pig Sty Alley. Landlord walks through the shops, receiving tributes and terrorizing everyone in a jovial way. Until he meets up with his wife, Landlady, who terrorizes her husband. Everyone in the Alley appears perfectly normal until Sing shows up.

When the two groups meet, we learn that people have special skills that they hesitate to use, unless absolutely necessary. They will do anything to protect their lives and friends. This leads to a series of amusing, entertaining fights, in which their skills are comically enhanced by special effects. Chow deftly blends all of these elements together making them appear somehow natural. Amazing considering all of the special effects, cartoon style action and over the top acting. Once we have accepted that these things can happen in this universe, we can accept the behavior as it becomes more cartoonish and more outlandish.

The story, while slight, is effective at creating a character that we can root for. Chow's Sing is just a guy looking to join the Axe Gang, but as he witnesses their brutality, he seems more drawn to the people of Pig Sty Alley. He realizes that their efforts to use their powers, only when absolutely necessary, to defend themselves, is the more responsible course of action. Throughout the film, we see glimpses of a pivotal moment in his childhood; he saves a deaf mute girl from a bunch of bullies and buys a book about kung-fu from a street beggar. Later, we learn that Sing may be the Chosen One. To live up to this prophecy, he has to make some changes in his life.

All of these over-the-top, disparate elements combined together would normally create a mess of a film. In ""Hustle"", they come together to create a fun, enjoyable film that will hopefully spur filmmakers to come up with more creative ways to tell a story.",1114992000,4,3776,4.55081001472754
2317109,5,B0009S4IHY,"I think Roger Ebert said it best by stating that Kung Fu Hustle (the latest from actor/director/screenwriter Stephen Chow) is a mix of Jackie Chan, Buster Keaton, Quentin Tarantino and Bugs Bunny.  If that combination makes you laugh then you will undoubtably love this movie.

The beginning brilliantly sets up the antagonists by showing how ruthless and bloodthirsty they are before going to the beginning credits and having the Axe Gang then dance to the music.  It's a wonderful beginning, showing the dichotomy of a ruthless gang that dances like they belong in a musical.  Very funny.

When the movie begins in earnest, we are introduced to Pig Sty Alley where poor people are scrambling to live day by day.  Stephen Chow populates his area with wonderful characters who are hillariously funny and different from each other.  They all have motives, sometimes hidden, and it makes watching them quite humorous.

But what Kung Fu Hustle does best is play with the martial arts conventions.  Like Wuxia films, the characters possess supernatural abilities to send swords flying by playing instruments and other plot spoiling devices.  But unlike some Wuxia films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, they are taken to the extreme as a sort of satire of the genre while at the same time embracing everything wonderful about those films.  The martial arts are spot on, having been done by the wonderful choreographer of The Matrix and Kill Bill Woo-ping Yuen.  Yet unlike those films and again in touch with the style of the movie, the action is playful.

The violence is over the top, stylized with sequenes that remind us of the Looney Tunes cartoons.  In fact, Stephen Chow incorporates a lot of homages to American Cinema with quotes in line with Spider Man and the Matrix and even a sound sampling from the Matrix in a couple scenes.  It's funny to catch.

Overall a terrific film that incorporates Oriental cinema with Western cinema.  Brilliantly shot, written and acted, it successfully merges many totally disparate genres into a movie that satirizes, makes homages to, and transcends the martial arts genres.  Absolutely wonderful a must see for all fans.",1114905600,4,2166,5.0027932960893855
2317110,5,B0009S4IHY,"'Kung Fu Hustle' personifies why Asian cinema is some much more exciting, original, and flat-out better than just about anything that American film studios release in this day and age of bland remakes, Vin Diesel action crapfests, and Ashton Kutcher comedies.

Being a big Asian cinema fan, I had the Chinese release DVD of 'Kung Fu Hustle' about six months ago, but that didn't stop me from going and seeing it on the big screen.  I won't recap the film's plot because its already been spat out dozens of times in many other reviews here but to put it quickly:  think 'Looney Toons' meets 'The Matrix'.  The action scenes are wildly inventive, the comedy guffaw-worthy, some very funny violence(mostly cartoony and nothing you couldn't really show the kids)and the entire thing is filled with some of the most memorable characters you have ever seen.  Not to mention probably the finest CGI I've ever seen in a film.

I'm a huge Stephen Chow fan and I will recommend all of his films, many of which you can pick up right here on Amazon or on some great Asian film sites(AZNfilms.com or HKFlix.com).  This film is just as good, if not a smidge better than 'Shaolin Soccer'.

On a sidenote:  Check out Chow's 'King Of Comedy', which he made right before 'Shaolin Soccer'.  It doesn't have the hyper-kinetic pacing or amazing CGI of either '...Soccer' or '...Hustle', but if you liked them you'll also like this one.  I personally think its his funniest film.

Anyways, from the first frame to the last, 'Kung Fu Hustle' is endlessly inventive, entertaining, mindblowing, hilarious, and wonderful.  Its films like this that make going to the theatre exciting again.",1114819200,2,1663,4.833922261484099

Cast: Stephen Chow, Yuen Wah, Yuen Qui, Leung Siu Lung, Shengyi Huang

Director: Stephen Chow

Running Length: 1:35

MPAA Classification: PG-13

In Shanghai, in the 1930s, everything is controlled by the Axe Gang.  Well, everything except the slums.  There is no profit in the slums.  Sing (Chow) wants to take advantage of this, and when he arrives at Pigsty Alley playing the role of an Axe Gang member, his performance is so bad that nobody believes him.  Then some real members of the gang arrive, and Sing is in trouble.  To add to that, there are some kung fu masters hiding in Pigsty Alley, and they are not too thrilled with the gang making an appearance in their little town.

I can honsetly say I have never seen a movie quite like ""Kung Fu Hustle"".  It is a strange hybrid of a kung fu movie, a slapstick comedy, and even a little Road Runner/Looney Toones.  It is really funny at times, but the humor is a bit uneven.  The biggest drawback to this film is the subtitles.  I prefer this to dubbing, but I think that some of the humor is lost, having to read them.

Apparently Stephen Chow is second in popularity in China only to Jackie Chan.  He has yet to really make a name for himself here in America, but there definately is potential.  He writes, directs, stars, and produces this movie, so this movie is definately his.  If you are looking for something a little different to see, ""Kung Fu Hustle"" just may be the movie for you.",1114646400,5,1468,4.451127819548872
2317125,5,B0009S4IHY,"I have been a fan of Stephen Chow for more than ten years and I have to give him props. If you think he is funny in this movie you'll be surprised at how much more hiliarious he usually is because this is considered one of his more dramatic roles! Fans should check out ""God of cookery"" which can easily translate to western audiences. ""Royal Tramp"" and the sequel are classics and my personal favorites although I would recommend those for adventurous viewers.

There absolutely is a plot to this movie for the reviewer that said there is not.

Spoiler ~

The conflict between Sing choosing the gang or helping the people. Finding out that when he was young he tried to be good and was humiliated which is why he so desperately wants to join the gang because he thinks that good people don't get anywhere.

An example of the heart in this movie is the scene where Sing finally sees the girl in front of the candy store and instead of the usual Hollywood, run into each others arms and make out scene, the camera pans around them in a circular motion and by the time the circle is complete they have reverted back into children and walk hand in hand into the store.

Props also to Yeun Wo Ping for the choreography, the acting is really good and the soundtrack is well put together. This movie has a very stylish look with vivid colors and surprisingly good CGI. The subtitles are also very well translated.

I am happy that Stephen Chow is finally getting the recognition that he deserves because he is truly a comedic genius. And now a great director, writer and producer as well.

2317126,5,B0009S4IHY,"Benny Hill. Road Runner. Tex Avery. Hee Haw. The honor roll of highbrow comedy? No. But the most obvious possible inspirations for Stephen Chow's great new flick, Kung Fu Hustle, you betcha.

I love this film. But I may have laughed so much it was dangerous. As I gasped for air, no doubt turning purple and falling over several times during this masterpiece, I kept trying to get myself to calm down a little. I truly want you to go see this great film, a.s.a.p., but remember, it is so insanely funny it may be hazardous to your health. (Possible treatment for this condition: Breath deeply, count thirty and think of the last Adam Sandler film you saw. Yeah, that would do it.)

Litmuswise, a few points. You must accept and smile at women who wear curlers 24/7, who beat up on their skinny husbands, and who smack the sundry citizen upside the head with a house shoe, to like this film. You have to think crushing bones and kicking people square in the jaw is, at least in theory, the very nucleus of great comic genius. And the sight of people running down the road at 80 miles an hour, Benny Hill style (but with CGI, natch) has to double you over in helpless paroxysms of laughter AT LEAST the first time it happens. If any of these pertain to you, then you very well may get the brilliance of this film.

Now, it's not all crude, rude and socially unacceptable. I don't want to give the game away, but the scene where Sing selects an opponent to square off with Mano y Mano from among the townsfolk is purest Keaton, as is the scene of his attempted assassination of Landlady. Astonishing, out of the box, cerebral visual gag-making at it's finest. Bravo!

Ten stars of ten. Someone said that the tiny things in this film work better than the blowout set pieces. I'm not sure I agree-- and we could quibble all day about which things in this film are small and which big-- but I like this comment simply because it may prompt people to take a closer look at the great SMALL things in this film.

But overall, and this can't be overemphasized, I think the whole thing works like a Swiss watch. Scene for scene, there isn't anything I would remove as flab or as a misfire. Chow makes good. REAL good. We are very lucky, indeed,  to have him making films like this in our time.",1114473600,5,2282,4.395734597156398
2317127,5,B0009S4IHY,"Kung Fu Hustle is the best reviewed wide release film thus far this year, and there is a very good reason for that - it IS the best wide released movie thus far this year.

Better than that - Kung Fu Hustle is a Masterpiece of Cinema.

This film is brilliantly original and monstrously entertaining. I haven't heard a crowd respond like that in a comedy in ages. The movie has smart, sharp comedy with brilliant editing and timing, fantastic action scenes which really give you a sense of scale, power, and grace - in a way that Kill Bill could only dream of - and an artistic bent and ambition that actually works. The characters are funny and the performances are outstanding.

Stephen Chow is not only one of the world's greatest comedy actors, he is also one of the world's greatest comedy directors - actually, he's one of the world's greatest directors period.

Chow has created his own new style of comedy. Nobody else is doing anything remotely like what he does, and frankly, very few, if any, would be able to do it even if they wanted to. He uses the language of film and the techniques of visual storytelling in his comedy better than anybody. Rather than just locking down the camera and shooting the scenes flat, letting the actors do all the comedic heavy lifting, which is what you see in almost every comedy, Chow makes the camera an active participant in the comedy.  The visual language supports and enhances his comedy, and often becomes the very basis and essence of the comedic communication to the audience.  No other comedy director uses the camera so extensively.  Not even close.

Many scenes in this film can be compared to dance numbers, but in truth, the entire film is a ""dance"" of brilliant visual direction - I'd go so far as to say that Stephen Chow is a candidate for the title of our ""visual Mozart.""  Turn the sound off and you can still tell exactly what is going on.

For instance, think about the section where the Assassins use their very interesting ""musical weapon"". I won't give anything away here, but in almost any other film, the deadliness of that weapon would've been revealed to the audience by the assassins demonstrating it - likely during a tense, quick scene where an unconvinced villain gets a ""close call"" when the assassins he's hiring show him just what their weapon can do.  The villain might be eating an apple, say, and the villains would strum their weapon, cutting the apple in half right before it reaches his mouth - a visual demonstration.  This would be a competent way to handle such a scene in a movie.

Chow doesn't go down that road, however - ""competent"" is not good enough for him - instead, we go straight into the scene not knowing what the weapon is or what it can do, and he gives us a gorgeous, slowly-building and musical demonstration of its power during its first deadly use... the mysterious night, the unlucky target noticing the musician plucking and tuning the instrument, the mood changing as things start to be ""off"", the notes being struck faster and with more intensity as branches fall around the target, and the shadow of an unlucky cat is sliced in two...  Finally, after this buildup, we get the ""punchline"" in a gorgeous but brutally unforgettable series of quick shots.

It's an amazing piece of visual storytelling, and it is not alone in this movie. Nearly every scene is infused with visual storytelling splendor. Chow uses cinematic language to tell a story in an interesting way better than any other director working today.

In a Stephen Chow-directed film, the filmmaking is as fun to watch as he is as an actor. Every single shot slides in and out of each other in a visually striking way, but they are not merely there just ""to look cool"" like we get from so many other directors today - the shots are visually striking for the purpose of using the camera to tell the story.  They accomplish a dramatic point that enhances the meaning of the scene and/or story.

I am a film director, and I am completely astonished by the way Chow works with the medium. I am firmly convinced that in the decades to come, like Buster Keaton before him, Chow's reputation in cinema will grow from ""critically respected"", like he is now, to ""hailed as a film genius and pioneer"". That's what happened to Buster Keaton, and it will happen to Stephen Chow.

Go see Kung Fu Hustle. And realize that you are watching a future film legend in the making while you're there. But whether you care about film history or not, you will certainly have a very fun time watching this movie.

Kung Fu Hustle is now the film to beat this year.",1114473600,13,4612,4.587591240875913
2317128,4,B0009S4IHY,"Kung Fu Hustle is from the same person, Stephen Chow, behind Shaolin Soccer. You all remember Shaolin Soccer, right? Oh right, it was cut to pieces by its American distributor and then never widely released in the USA (if it was released at all on the screen).

Shaolin Soccer was about this ex-soccer player (football to all you non-US Americans) that was very good, missed a goal, and was brutally beaten by a mob. That ex-player became a flunky to one of his former soccer teammates, until he leaves and eventually forms a soccer team with some bums he finds in the streets (not all bums). The team ends up entering a competition and the final game is against Team Evil, the team owned by that former teammate. There is something of a coherent plot in Shaolin Soccer (as long as you watch the uncut verison). Kung Fu Hustle is a lot more disjointed.

Kung Fu Hustle is filled with many actors, so much so that it becomes hard to tell which actor, or set of actors we should care about. Hustle is about crime-filled 1920s or 1930s Shanghai, where gangs run rampant, except in the poorest areas. One gang has, apparently, come to dominate most of Shanghai. That gang is the ""Axe Head Gang"" (or something like that). The movie opens with that gang ""fighting"" the head of a rival gang. The leader of the Axe gang likes dancing around during fights and afterwards.

Later, two con men visit one of those poor areas, Pig Sty Alley (I believe that is the name of the alley). They claim to be members of the Axe gang and demand money, but are disbelieved by the poor citizens of this alley (actually somewhat humorous scene where chief con man, Stephen Chow, keeps picking people out of the audience to fight, only to find out that he keeps choosing some tough looking people). Eventually the real Axe gang turns up, some Kung Fu masters spring up out of the poor mass of the Alley and . . . don't want to give everything away.

The movie can be surprisingly funny at times, but is a lot more violent and bloody than you might expect from a ""comedy."" I would probably give this film 4.22 stars out of 5.

The main actors are: Hisao Liang (leader of the Axe Gang); Stephen Chow (Sing); Wah Yuen (Landlord); Qiu Yuen (Landlady); Xing Yu (coolie; more of a supporting part); Siu Lung Leung (The Beast); Dong Zhi Hua (Donut); Kwok Kuen Chan (Brother Sum); Chiu Chi Ling (Tailor) and etc.

2317130,5,B0009S4IHY,"Stephen Chow's past films have been ""good"".  While they typically displayed some very enjoyable if goofy martial arts scenes, much of the humor was lost on Western audiences.  The movies probably played very well to the original Asian audiences.

Kung-Fu Hustle is a new beast.  The humor present here is partly Asian, but it plays much better to a wider audience and includes so many obscure references to American movies that only a true movie buff will catch them all.  Everybody I saw it with in the theater was laughing their heads off for a majority of the run time.  Suffice if to say, the comedy works with full force.

In addition, the martial arts scenes are fantastic.  As comical as the movie can be, some of the fight scenes were pure art (the one with the ""instrument"" struck me in particular).  The choreographer, Yuen Wo Ping, is the same guy who did the fight scenes for the Matrix movies.

Some people complain that the movie has no plot.  This is only true in the sense that before the final scene (if you don't look at your watch, which you won't) you won't know when the movie is going to end.  That is, the plot doesn't have a pace where you can see a very clear exposition, build-up, and ending.  I found this to be a strength rather than a weakness.  I was so wrapped up in enjoying every scene as it came; I didn't want it to end, and the fact that the plot didn't have a pace that revealed the end was near just allowed me to enjoy each scene more.

Stephen Chow has been funny in the past, but his work has reached a new level.  If you saw Shaolin Soccer, think of this as Shaolin Soccer times 10.  This is a movie that all audiences should enjoy.

2317131,4,B0009S4IHY,"Having seen Stephen Chow gone from goofy TV star in the late '80s, to becoming the king of comedy of Hong Kong with a long list of box office hits since the early '90s, it's great to see him combining jokes, outlandish special effects, and Kung Fu in this film that is by far his most entertaining work, even better than Shaolin Soccer. This is no doubt Granddaddy Sing's(his nickname) most ambitious movie, since it had already conquered the box office in all Chinese cinemas as well in most Asian countries. Finally, his movie is getting to be launched in North America in wide release. Let's see if it'll kick ass like Hero and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

Since I have already acquired Sing(Stephen Chow's) style of comedy and action for film, I know it's not going to be a Jackie Chan or Jet Li kind of action/comedy. He's very much on a league of his own, so he's got something different to offer the foreign audiences. Fans of Jim Carrey will very likely dig Sing's movie, because the two actors have been compared a lot.

The movie is about the war between The Axe Gang and The Pig Sty Alley, and Sing is pretending to be an amateur while seeking
 to become a member of the Axe Gang. There are some very powerful retired masters of Kung Fu Warriors living as normal residents in The Pig Sty Alley. The Tailor, The Coolie(handyman), and The Baker all have great power and skills, but have not use them until the intrusion of The Axe Gang. They defeated the gang effortlessly. The Axe Gang then hired The # 1 Killers(two men who use musical instrument to produce deadly melodies as their weapon) to fight against the Alley. Just when they had defeated the three defendents of the Valley, The Landlord and his wife The LandLady came out to show them some serious kung fu. The Landlord's special power is his body movement that can be bent like elastic, so his opponent cannot hit him easily. As for The Landlady, she can ran like a motorcycle, and her ultimate power is her voice(a skill known as The Lion's Roar). Sing was hired by the Gang to go help The Beast escape the mental Assylum, so that he can fight against The Alley. The Beast was known to be the best of the best in the world of kung fu, and he was in the Assylum because he had defeated everyone already. The Landlady and The Landlord were caught off guard when The Beast appeared. They thought they were the best in kung fu, and now they have to face the enemy of a life time. Who will save them if they failed?

Wah Yuen(Landlord) and Qiu Yuen(Landlady) are very good together, and they delivered the laughs and great battle scenes. Qiu Yuen is actually very striking, espeically when she had the funniest lines and a outrageous personality. Other supporting players including the goofy Gang Leader(Danny Chan), and Tailor provided with some funny moments. The scene when Tailor was prancing around wearing a pair of red underwear seen through in a pair transparent pants, and got mocked by Landlady was a comic relief. The Lollipop Girl was unerexposed here, and I was expecting to see her practicing some special candy power, but she's just Sing's love interest. The action direction from renowned martial arts veteran Yuen Woo Ping certainly made the fight scenes over-the-top here. Along with a ton of special effects, it's very captivating, even if it looked kind of cartoonish at times.

Stephen Chow didn't totally dominate the movie like his other films, and he allowed the supporting cast enough screentime, so that the group scenes are worthwhile. In fact, I didn't find him to be as funny as his previous films. He's more serious, and his fight scenes have improved a great deal, considered that he's not an action star.",1114214400,6,3707,4.619119878603946
2317132,4,B0009S4IHY,"I watched more than a week of commercials for ""Kung Fu Hustle"" on such TV venues as TBS, and figured I'd go, since I can always use a good laugh and don't mind some action as well.  But then I get there, find the whole thing is in Chinese, and with a story I couldn't follow.  I suppose there was humor I could pick up on, but it was far from side-splitting.  I suspect that this was a case of pearls before swine, for I'm guessing that a lot of fine martial arts film values were present but I couldn't appreciate them.  My own experience would rate 3.7 stars.  I'm sorry.",1114214400,3,573,4.126126126126126
2317133,4,B0009S4IHY,"Shanghai, China, the 1930s.  The Axe Gang is taking over the town but is not interested in the poor slums. This leaves the residents of Pig Sty Alley to deal with their overbearing Landlady. One day, Sing (Stephen Chow) and his sidekick,  walk into the Alley and attempt to blackmail people there. When the residents of the tenement stand up to fight him, he reveals that he is part of the Axe Gang and signals for help. Gang members show up and the landlady and the tenement residents fight them off. The Axe Gang realizes that they have been called to help someone who is not a part of the gang, but Sing is desperate to become a member. Now that the gang and the residents of Pig Sty Alley have met, they can't back down from each other, fighting until one group is victorious. The leader of the Axe Gang realizes that he will not be able to fight them alone and brings in The Beast.

""Kung Fu Hustle"", written and directed by the star, Stephen Chow, is a fun, exhilarating, fast-paced film, borrowing elements from and paying homage to many other genres. Chow is clearly a filmmaker who loves films; he seems like a kid in a candy store. Now that he can make a film, how many different types of things can he get into the story? ""Hustle"" combines all of these elements in a way that is fresh and exciting.

The opening sequence is a homage to police interrogation films and westerns. When the opposing sides face off on a dusty road, we are transported from Shanghai to the Wild West. The sky turns magenta and everybody faces off, preparing for a classic gun fight. This scene is very theatrical, comical and sets the tone for the remainder of the film. Of course, we aren't in the Old West and the leader of the Axe Gang uses an axe to prove his point and keep us firmly rooted in the world of kung-fu.

The story is a framework for Chow to throw each and every trick in the book at the audience. After he introduces the Axe Gang, we then meet the residents of Pig Sty Alley. Landlord walks through the shops, receiving tributes and terrorizing everyone in a jovial way. Until he meets up with his wife, Landlady, who terrorizes her husband. Everyone in the Alley appears perfectly normal until Sing shows up.

When the two groups meet, we learn that people have special skills that they hesitate to use, unless absolutely necessary. They will do anything to protect their lives and friends. This leads to a series of amusing, entertaining fights, in which their skills are comically enhanced by special effects. Chow deftly blends all of these elements together making them appear somehow natural. Amazing considering all of the special effects, cartoon style action and over the top acting. Once we have accepted that these things can happen in this universe, we can accept the behavior as it becomes more cartoonish and more outlandish.

The story, while slight, is effective at creating a character that we can root for. Chow's Sing is just a guy looking to join the Axe Gang, but as he witnesses their brutality, he seems more drawn to the people of Pig Sty Alley. He realizes that their efforts to use their powers, only when absolutely necessary, to defend themselves, is the more responsible course of action. Throughout the film, we see glimpses of a pivotal moment in his childhood; he saves a deaf mute girl from a bunch of bullies and buys a book about kung-fu from a street beggar. Later, we learn that Sing may be the Chosen One. To live up to this prophecy, he has to make some changes in his life.

All of these over-the-top, disparate elements combined together would normally create a mess of a film. In ""Hustle"", they come together to create a fun, enjoyable film that will hopefully spur filmmakers to come up with more creative ways to tell a story.",1113264000,12,3776,4.55081001472754
2317134,4,B0009S4IHY,"The latest movie from the very talented Stephen Chow is really funny, well made and most importantly inspired and unique.

A petty crook and his sidekick pretend to be from the notorious Axe Gang to extort money from a rural apartment building and accidently set into motion a stand off between the gang and the residents of the building. I really don't want to give away any more of the plot because not knowing what the movie is about makes the experience more enjoyable.

This movie has great CG and a highly stylish look. The acting  from the landlady, landlord, Sing and his sidekick are very good with the landlady stealing almost all her scenes. The soundtrack is very good as well.

As an English and Cantonese speaker I can say with some confidence that the subtitles are the best that I've seen, capturing the right meaning and tone. I've been a fan of Stephen Chow ever since I was very young and he still has me rolling now at 21 because he knows what's funny. This movie gives you a little bit of everything action, laughs, drama and love. It's worth watching because you have never seen anything like this but most of all because it's good.",1113004800,6,1154,4.533653846153846

Martial arts gurus disguised as pathetic (supposedly timid) people with the ultimate crabby martial arts landlady but ...BOY DO THEY TRANSFORM WHEN PROVOKED!!!  The Pig Sty Alley lead-up and fight scene alone are worth the price of admission.  The fight choreography is astounding.  The facial expressions, story and comedic timing are great.
