2367563,5,B000A6T1IQ,"If you're wondering that this is going to be just like the regular Rugrats you see on T.V., think again!  ""Tales from the Crib"" gives viewers a new twist on their favorite babies and childhood fairy tales.  Taffy, the Rugrats' babysitter, tells the stories to the babies, who give it their own Rugrats twist.  In ""Snow White"", Susie plays the title character, Angelica (of course) plays the evil queen, and the babies along with Spike play the seven dwarves.  This is a very good direct-to-DVD movie and will probably never air on television.  This is very hard to find in stores and is not available to rent.  Also, this DVD features two episodes of the Rugrats spin-off, ""Pre-School Daze"", which has not yet airred in the U.S.  Those episodes are very fun to watch and the theme song is very catchy.  I would reccomend this DVD to anyone.",1131667200,9,840,4.628378378378378

2367565,5,B000A6T1IQ,"After 2003, Klaskey-Csupo said they were not continuing with the Rugrats. Little did we know, they had been cooking up a brand new dvd series for the show. ""Tales from the Crib"" is a new DVD series in which the babie from the Rugrats put themselves into classic fairy tales. ""Snow White"" is the first one of the series, it will be followed by ""Jack and the Beanstalk"". I am excited to buy the movie, its a great way to start off the school year. I want to see just how well Spike will be at a dwarf, just how poison the apple really will be, and how the babie come up with a wacky twist on the classic fairy tale.",1124668800,3,613,4.074380165289257

2367855,5,B000A6T1IQ,"We purchased this DVD a while after it aired on Nickelodeon. We love the DVD and I will explain its features.

In this DVD, Taffy the babysitter tells the Rugrats the classic story of Snow White. Susie stars as Snow White, Angelica stars as the evil queen, and Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil, Dil, Kimi and Spike star as the 7 dwarves.

From there, the fairy tale becomes an exciting journey, full of fun events and great music. Songs include ""Do It Together"" and the hilarious ""Diaper Factory Song.""

Also included on this DVD are 2 episodes from a new Rugrats series ""Preschool Daze"" featuring Susie and Angelica. We love the episodes and hope these and more will soon air on Nickeloden.

Over all, 5 stars. Simply a must-have for those who enjoy the Rugrats.",1137196800,17,756,4.619402985074627
