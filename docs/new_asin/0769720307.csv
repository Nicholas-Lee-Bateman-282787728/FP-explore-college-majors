29692,5,0769720307,"As with everything with Placido Domingo's touch, this performance is superlative. Far from being distracting the language French, German, Italian, and English, and opera humor is hilarious. Josef Meinrad, as jailer Frosch, is worth the purchase alone. Guest appearance by Dame Hilda Bracket with Dr. Evadne Hinge was charming, and ballet duo Merle Park and Wayne Eagling absolutely lovely. All of which embellish a consistently excellent cast. Especially enjoyable were Hildegard Heichele's Adele, and Dennis O'Neill the tenor who wouldn't stop singing. The only disappointment was lack of spunk in Rosalinde's Hungarian song, which should be the showpiece of the operetta. You'll like it, especially if you're multi-lingual.",1072137600,18,725,5.722222222222222
29693,2,0769720307,"I have to compare this version to the Carlos Kleiber version and what is most striking is the musicality and ensemble playing plus pure energy visible on the stage of the Kleiber version.  This version is a routine version adapted to an English audience and I find it prosaic at best with the added Act 2 guest appearances which I found annoying.  While I agree with an earlier reviewer that Herman Prey's Eisenstein is well sung, the sheer energy and joy that the Eisenstein of Eberhard Waechter conveys makes Prey's Eisenstein seem pallid.  Janet Perry and Pamela Coburn in the female leads bring both outstanding singing and energy to this production that is not present in this Convent Garden Version.  I really recommend the Kleiber version, not because this version is so terrible, but because the Kleiber version is so integrated and musical that it brings the pure pleasure of Fledermaus to the viewer and listener.",1070323200,30,923,4.897435897435898
29694,5,0769720307,"Sin lugar a dudas, esta es la mejor versi&oacute;n de la opereta de straus, llamada por conveniencia &oacute;pera para poder ser presentada en el teatro de la &oacute;pera de Viena en aquellos tiempos. Todos los cantantes son de primera y la direcci&oacute;n de Pl&aacute;cido Domingo es excelente. Sabiendo alem&aacute;n y conociendo el dialecto austriaco, puedo dar fe de que esta es simplemente una versi&oacute;n maravillosa del ""Murci&eacute;lago"".

29695,5,0769720307,"This production is Covent Garden plush with some of the best singers in the international class and a credible conducting job by Domingo.  Te Kanawa's high notes were squeezed due to some lack of support, probably the corset she had to wear for the gowns but Prey is wonderful!  There is a great surprise in the last act between the conductor and the jailer!  An accident in rehearsal that stayed in the production because it was so funny!  Watch this every New Year's Eve when possible and really enjoy it.  A recommendation as the best video available of this opera!  Buy it!  Great fun!",996192000,11,589,4.605769230769231

THAT IS THE PLACIDO  DOMINGO!), and great fun from start to finish (And, WHAT A FINISH THEY  GOT!). Althrought I didn't like the look of Doris Soffel's Orlofsky, I do  enjoy Josef Meinard's Frosch a lot (You ought to see the interplay between  him & Domingo). Hermann Prey & Benjamin Luxon is pretty good, and  Dame Kiri? She's Yummy throughout, with her best fun comes at the finale  and curtain call! And, Domingo?

29709,5,0769720307,"The opera itself was brilliant entertainment, with lots of laughs in it.  It was almost as madcap as Gilbert & Sullivan (NOTHING can be as madcap as <i>Trial by Jury</i>).  It well deserves the innumerable performances that have been done of it.

Perhaps because of my interest in languages, the scene that amused me most was when the husband and the jailer were introduced as Frenchmen and they had to pretend to speak French to one-another even though they knew just about as much French as I do, which is very little. They managed a few common but totally unconnected French words and even threw in a bit of Italian.

I can get by in reading French to some extent because I have a general knowledge of European languages but I have never studied it.  I <a href=""http://antigreen.blogspot.com.au/2015/03/another-blast-from-past-via-steve.html"">recently translated</a> some Afrikaans, though.  So that may explain why I was so amused by the scene.  I couldn't watch it right through the second time around because it was so funny.  I am like that with Mr Bean too.  He is so unbearably funny that I have to switch off the recording half way through and watch the second half another day.  Do Leftists have a sense of humour that strong?  I can't imagine it.

And the performance was a distinguished one indeed.  Kiri te Kanawa was at her very good best.  She both sang and acted admirably.  And Hermann Prey as the husband was in his element. His expression when his wife was expounding his sins was very well and amusingly done.

And a  big surprise was the appearance of every woman's favourite soulful singer -- ""Sharl"" Aznavour -- playing, what else, Charles Aznavour. To get him along in a cameo role was undoubtedly a bit of a coup for the production.  You don't have to understand a word Aznavour sings to get the soulfulness.  He is a mobile evocation of tragedy. He is not my cup of tea at all but he is undoubtedly a supreme master of his genre.

And the dancing was surprisingly good too.  The dancing in operas and operettas can be pretty basic.  I have an example in mind -- from Britain -- but will not be so unkind as to record it.

On this occasion, the participation of an accomplished ballet company was secured, however, ensuring very good dancing indeed.  The chief male dancer impressed me.  It is of course routine for male dancers to lift the ballerina above their heads at some stage, though few have been as good at it as Nureyev.  He would lift the lady up with two hands and then hold her there briefy with one hand -- a great feat of strength.  And the dancer on this occasion was even better.  He exited holding the ballerina above his head -- with his grip on just one of her ankles. Just holding her there would be pretty good, let alone walking off with her like that.  <i>Update</i>:  On further viewing he seems to have a hand on his lady's bottom too.  But it is still quite a feat.

And I was rather pleased at how un-Islamic the show was.  It featured a huge amount of alcoholic imbibing and not a little of  amusing drunkenness.  Towards the end the whole proceedings were said to be a celebration of Champagne!  I think I too would blow myself up if I were a Muslim.  Though I was in fact teetotal until my late 20s.  I was very skinny in my youth and I used to wonder what I could eat or drink to put on a bit of weight.  In my late 20s I found the answer: beer!

Speaking of 21st century concerns, I was pleased at how good the ethnic stereotyping was in the casting. Ethnic stereotypes are absolutely <i>verboten</i> these days but they have been something of an interest of mine. I have even written academic articles on the subject (<a href=""http://jonjayray.comuv.com/scots.html"">here</a> and  <a href=""http://jonjayray.comuv.com/stereo.html"">here</a>). So I was pleased to see that the Italian music master could not have been more Southern Italian:  A Neapolitanian, I suspect.  And I was initially a bit critical of ""Dr Falke"" looking so English -- but I note now that he is introduced as ""from London"" -- so the casting director and I obviously thought similarly.  And Hermann Prey looked as German as he is.

So what did I not like about the production?  I LOATHED the ""trouser role"", where the Prince was played by a bald-headed woman.  The role was originally written that way but I am obviously not alone in my response to it --  as quite a lot of productions have put a man into the role.  And couldn't they at least have put some hair on her?  A bald-headed woman is a tragedy. The lady sang well enough but looking at her was a pain.

I suppose the producer at Covent Garden was being true to the text in casting that role but I wish he had been true to the text throughout. He clearly couldn't decide whether to produce the show in German or English.  It was mostly in German but also substantially in English.  Because I have a degree of age-related hearing loss, I understood the German better -- because it had subtitles -- while  the English did not.  The English bits were mainly to get laughs  -- which succeeded -- but why not be done with it and produce the whole thing in English? Kiri te Kanawa is of course a native English speaker and I can't imagine that the other singers would have had any difficulty.

Many patrons of the arts are elderly and reduced hearing is a normal part of aging so all recordings of operas and operettas should be fully subtitled, just as all live performances should include supertext.

And whatever limitations the show had were all more than made up for by Strauss's wonderful music.  The profundity of J.S. Bach is my musical home but you would have to be a sad soul indeed not to hear the joy that is in the music of Johann Strauss II. Unlike some others I have seen recently, I will be viewing this show again.",1428796800,2,5813,4.544315992292871

However it is a lighthearted tale about a man Dr. Falke ""Her Dr. Fledermaus"" (BenJamin Luxom) getting back in his friend Gabriel von Eisenstein (Hermann Prey) for an embarrassing moment. The story starts off quite simple and gets more complex as it goes turning into a farce, than a bit of slapstick, than into a revelation, and the last laugh.

This is my favorite version of the story is all of the people in here are well known today. During the second act they even deviate from the story to allow a lot of the individual performers to perform individually such as Dame Hilda Bracket & Dr. Evadne Hinge sing ""Three Little Maids"" from the Mikado, and Charles Aznavour ""She""; it is a fun break. Even the conductor, Placido Domingo, gets a chance to enter back here and in several other parts of the play.

There is, however, a more delightful performance with virtually the same cast, recorded New Year's Eve 1977, which may be the first year this production was used.  It was, amazingly, broadcast on a local TV Station ... twice.  The first run-through had a slight glitch in the sound.  The second time through, the glitch was corrected.  I was fortunate to videotape it but, alas, I taped the first performance. Even with the glitch, I wouldn't part with it.  The only major personnel difference in the earlier performance was the conductor, Zubin Mehta.  The Overture is truncated but the performance is complete and includes the balloons and confetti (it was New Year's Eve)at the end.  Visually, the major change is that all of the singers had gained ten to twenty pounds.

29751,4,0769720307,"To kultur, we owe this distribution of a 1981 Australian production of the Viennese standby by Johann Strauss. In light of the reviews to other DVD performances by Dame Joan Sutherland, pleasure in this one will be dictated by ones responses to her performance in what were her 50's. In other respects, this is a traditional approach emphasizing the fun and games of life  for the wealthy in the last days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The cast fills its assigned role in this story of a practical joke played upon a practical joker. Dame Joan's husband leads the orchestra and the cast in a rousing, effervescent performance while the sets and costumes reinforce the gaiety, so that the now classic score is shown to best advantage. Never having seen Dame Joan's more youthful performances, I cannot compare them with 1981 when she would have been in her mid-fifties, not really old for a well-trained voice carefully managed voice. I enjoyed the evening with her in the role but, for me, a more Patrice Munsel, Roberta Peters, Dorothy Kirsten type would have been suitable; however, that is merely a matter of taste not a qualitative judgment.
All in all, this is quite an acceptable offering among Fledermaus DVD's but I do not find it to be markedly superior. If you are a fan of Dame Joan's you should be quite happy with it( I should think).",1247875200,8,1349,4.740425531914894
29752,5,0769720307,"This is the most entertaining production of Die Fledermaus I've seen on videos. The story is updated to New York in 1930s, which works perfectly well for me and adds much freshness and modern air to this classic operetta. The set and costumes are gorgeous. The performers may not be the greatest singers in the world but they all have solid techniques and sing pretty well. Acting-wise they are great, which makes the production entertaining to watch compared to some other dull and dry productions. There're some great performances here, notably Anthony Warlow as Eisenstein who is not only a pretty good opera singer but also a great music theatre actor, and Suzanne Johnston as the eccentric millionaire. The lyrics being sung in English is something you might need to get used to, but it greatly helps non German speaking audience enjoy the fun.",1226620800,6,849,4.902777777777778
29753,4,0769720307,"OK--let's get this out of the way:  Most of us are used to seeing and hearing Die Fledermaus in German with subtitles.
This performance is in English with no subtitles.

Instead of a setting in Vienna, this is set in New York, but it retains the interaction of the upper and lower classes who suppose they are so disimilar.

At first, hearing my favorite Fledermaus songs IN ENGLISH was a bit of a shock, but you know, it started growing on me.  Before long, I was looking forward to each new phrase in this remarkable English version of an old familiar friend.  The language is witty, and the delivery very well-done.

The singers are quite good--you just have to remind yourself that you won't be hearing German.  You'll especially enjoy the bubbly Adele, and a jaunty Eisenstein. Because it's in English, it might also be a good way to introduce friends to the world of operetta. If you remember to forget the traditional German performances, and just enjoy this as a clever and entertaining musical (or operetta), you're in for two and a half hours of ""mistaken identity"" fun.",1210032000,13,1080,4.682539682539683

It was a gift to a relative and I wasn't able to determine whether the problem was with the disc or the player.  The performances were all first-rate.  Domingo took the orchestra at a very fast clip in the more ""technical"" portions of the Overture, but it was musically still quite appropriate.  I particularly enjoyed the occasions where the spoken dialog switched over briefly to English.  The ad libed ""entertainment"" at Prince Orlovsky's party was very good, but I've seen better. It was a bit inclined for a British audience.",1204329600,2,699,4.991379310344827

Even worse, the singers are mostly barely acceptable. The Austrailian opera usually does much better.",1201737600,5,399,4.633802816901408

There is humor, spirit, drama, and wonderful dance segments to broaden the cultural richness.  The orchestra, vocalists are first rate.  Once you get used to the story line (especially young children), they will be exposed to opera in its finest setting.  The Royal Opera Garden provides a classic atmosphere for the performance.

29758,4,0769720307,"SOURCE: Live 1983 performance at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London.

SOUND: Reasonably good stereo.  The singing of the soloists is generally well caught, the orchestra and chorus slightly less so.  Some dialogue fades occasionally, but that may be due to the performers as much as the sound pick-up.

CAST: Gabriel von Eisenstein, a prosperous Viennese gentlemen with a roving eye - Hermann Prey (baritone); Rosalinde, his wife - Tiri Te Kanawa (soprano); Alfred, Rosalinde's would be lover - Dennis O'Neill (tenor); Adele, Rosalinde's maid - Hildegarde Heichele (soprano); Dr. Falke, Eisenstein's good friend but also the victim of one of his practical jokes - Benjamin Luxon (baritone); Frank, Governor of the City Prison - Michael Langdon (baritone); Prince Orlowsky, a jaded and bored visiting aristocrat - Doris Soffel (mezzo-soprano); Dr. Blind, Eisenstein's lawyer - Paul Crook (tenor); Ida, Adele's sister - Ingrid Baier (speaker); Frosch, a jailer - Josef Meinrad (speaker).

CONDUCTOR: Placido Domingo with the Royal Opera House Orchestra and Chorus, Covent Garden.

TEXT: The lyrics are sung in a German not heavily burdened with Viennese lilt.  Spoken dialogue veers wildly from one language to another.

SETS AND COSTUMES: The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, is a very large theater with a big stage.  The settings are of necessity of large scale.  This makes Eisenstein's residence, which ought to be the well-appointed townhouse of a prosperous but nevertheless middle-class Viennese banker who keeps only a single servant, seem out of scale.  The ballroom set for the second act and the jail in the third are serviceable.  The costumes are generic, late 19th Century, but attractive and appropriate.

STAGE DIRECTION: Overall, the stage blocking is quite traditional, even sensible, leading one to make wild speculations about the director having actually read the libretto before staging the piece, improbable as that seems.  The decision to sing in German and speak the dialogue in polyglot form is a questionable one, probably earning, I imagine, about equal quantities of praise and disdain.

COMMENTARY: The roots of Johann Strauss II's ""Die Fledermaus"" stretch back to an 1851 German farce by Robert Benedix, ""Die Gefngnis"" (""The Prison"").  In 1872, that admirable pair of hacks, Meilhac and Halvy, cobblers of libretti for both Offenbach and Bizet, converted the old German play into a French vaudeville called ""Le rveillon"" (""The Revel"" or perhaps ""The Christmas Eve Party"").  In 1873-4, the French text was re-translated back into German for Strauss to set to music, but with all references to Christmas carefully expunged as a sop to respectable Viennese sensibilities.  Oddly enough, the one-time Christmas Eve tale that premiered not far away from Easter in 1874 has taken firm root in Austria and elsewhere as a New Year's Eve entertainment.

If there exists a poor sound recording of ""Die Fledermaus,"" I have never encountered it.  Each major recording has its unique merits and its champions.  Choosing the best among them is simply an exercise in expressing personal taste.  ""Chacun,"" as we are wisely advised, "" son got."" Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for all the DVD outings of ""Die Fledermaus"" (and especially not for two recent outright horrors from Salzburg and Glyndebourne, respectively.)  Let me now hasten to allay fears by assuring you that this DVD ""Fledermaus"" is a good one.  Many, including the Good Grey Gramophone Magazine, regard it as a very, very good one.

The cast is a generally sound one, and everyone (but Heichele) seems to be having an infectiously good time, especially Domingo, conducting in the pit.  They are all right, but neither Te Kanawa nor Heichele would be my first choice for Rosalinde and Adele, respectively (nor, indeed, my twenty-first choice, if it came to that.)  Hermann Prey is a sprightly Eisenstein, although perhaps a bit too old and stolid-looking to make Eisenstein's shenanigans entirely convincing.  Eisenstein is a low-lying tenor part or a high-flying baritone role.  I prefer a character tenor as Eisenstein, especially in Act II where he will be the only tenor voice.  Dennis O'Neill sings pretty well as Alfred, here translated into as Alfredo.  Benjamin Luxon, oddly enough for an operatic baritone, is adequate singing but notably better in speaking the dialogue.  Doris Soffel, is a tall, splendidly epicene figure as Prince Orlowsky.  Soffel, a very fine and well-known mezzo-soprano, here sounds very soprano-ish.  Had I been given the choice, I'd have cast her as Adele and Heichele, if I had to use her at all, as Orlowsky.

While the performance is enjoyable enough the first time through, there are problems that emerge on subsequent viewings.  The choice of having characters speak in different languages to one another--Te Kanawa in English to Dr. Falke but in German to Eisenstein and Adele, for instance--gets real tired real fast.  The part of Alfred was intended for a Viennese tenor--imagine the young Richard Tauber.  Strauss wrote appropriately Viennese music for him.  Performance tradition, however, has turned Alfred into a caricature of an Italian tenor, Alfredo, and interpolated all kinds of tags and snatches from Puccini and Verdi.  Here, they have gone one step further and made him speak in Italian--hardly the native tongue of a Dennis O'Neill, I fancy.  It's a wearisome conceit. (When they extend the idea to make Eisenstein emulate Wotan when he bids ""farewell"" to Rosalinde, it's really just too much!)  Even more wearisome is the ""gala"" in which outside performers offer a mixed bag of turns during Orlowsky's ball ... amusing once, tedious thereafter.

Finally, there is the matter of Domingo's conducting.  The Good Grey Gramophone calls it ""stiff.""  Since the Royal Opera House Orchestra is manifestly not a Viennese band, I'll give Domingo a pass on that point.  On the other hand, he seems to me to be a little over-indulgent on making comedic points at cost to the essential snap and crackle of Strauss' champagne-soaked score.

Compared to the overall enjoyability of the show, my negative comments count as relatively minor.  You can certainly do worse--much worse--than acquire this particular version of ""Die Fledermaus.""

Whereas the first and third acts followed the score fairly closely, the second act is greatly expanded with specialty performances that vary considerably in their ability to communicate. On repeated viewings, I found it increasingly easy to fast forward over several of the added performances. Such is the beauty of the DVD.

The first and the third acts generally make up for the somewhat bloated second act. The second act does have some enjoyable parts, and one can pick out the parts that will stand repeated viewings, and just skip over the others. I will admit that I've viewed the DVD in it's entirety only once; I have, on the other hand enjoyed the first and third acts, as well as selected parts of the second act many times.

The added performances are, in their own ways, competently done. I just feel the flow of the second act is seriously compromised by all of the extra performances.

On balance, I'm glad I have the DVD; the portions that I've mentioned favorably above are really quite good.",1156291200,12,1096,4.668393782383419

The characterizations of most of the singers are fairly good (save Orlofsky).  Domingo's conducting is apt.
