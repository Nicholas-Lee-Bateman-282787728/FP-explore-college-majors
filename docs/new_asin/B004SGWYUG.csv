4462367,4,B004SGWYUG,"A loveable cast and a hilarious script bring the laughs and the heart, while its supposedly light-hearted love story delicately tip-toes through its darker, underlying themes of jealousy, obsession, and depression. This class president is no push-over and orders your complete attention from start to finish.",1341014400,2,308,5.717391304347826
4462368,5,B004SGWYUG,I would highly recommend this series for any shojo fans out there. It shipped quickly and it arrived in 2 days and was still in the packaging. It is a great series and definitely a fun story line.,1334880000,,196,4.184210526315789
4462369,5,B004SGWYUG,"I understand people's frustration with the name of the video (Kaichou wa Maid Sama), but when it comes down to it, this DVD set is great. This is one of my favorite anime shows so I had to buy it as soon as I saw that someone had turned it into a DVD set.

This show is highly recommended for anyone who liked Special A, Itazura Na Kiss, Fruits Basket or the like. Usui plays the same as Kei in Special A, but with a lot more stalkerisms. Misaki is quite loveable and independent, but gets herself into silly situations. The graphics are enjoyable and the plot is just as fun as all of the other animes I named above.

For anyone who is questioning whether this DVD set is quality, let me assure you it's excellent. I've gotten ripped off a couple of times with Sailor Moon DVDs that were horribly made, so I'm incredibly happy that this DVD set is so clean. You won't be disappointed.",1318032000,6,885,4.261904761904762
4462370,4,B004SGWYUG,i originally saw this anime in the original japanese with english subtitles so when i saw that the series is available in the u.s i wanted to know as much about it as i could reading the product description i notice amazon lists it as english subtitles only. is this correct or perhaps a type O ?  i was actually very interested in seeing how this series would translate to the english language. I'd still buy it though if it's just in japanese with english subtitles. I think this is a wonderful series if you like the highschool romance genre. The characters even though are familiar standards they still have alot of charm and personality. If your on the fence just give it a shot the dvd sets ussually go on sale!,1311033600,2,717,4.431818181818182
4462371,5,B004SGWYUG,i LOVE this show i watched it when it first came out in japan with english subs NOT english dubs im terrified to think of what the english dubs would sound like for this series. none the less its a great show that just makes you happy watching it. only real issue with this series is that there is no solid evidence that there is a second season coming out any time soon and Usui has so much mystery behind him and they never delve that deep into him other than he likes ayuzawa. kinda pisses me off a little but the series itself is very solid and very good on the whole.,1305763200,3,572,4.070796460176991
4462372,4,B004SGWYUG,"Seika High School was once an all-boys school that recently turned co-ed, and because of that the school is full of rowdy boys and the girls are usually harrassed by the boys and generally scared to socialize.  Here comes in the main character Misaki Ayuzawa. She is the President (kaichou) of her class and does the best to intimidate all the boys to make a safe environment for girls in the school.  She has intelligence, diligence, hard work, athletic ability, and the ability to kick all the boys' butts with Aikido moves (Steven Seagal like).  She is a menace and a dictator as the first female class president to the chagrin of all the boys.

In Japan, High School policy generally does not allow a student to work part-time, but because Misaki's home is poor she has to work to help her family.  And through some circumstances she ends up working at a Maid Cafe (the waitresses all wear Maid uniforms) which goes against everything she believes and shows in school.

The fun starts when a couple of boys find out and try to blackmail her, including the school stud Takumi Usui who keeps tormenting her.

As shojo (made for female audience) High School romantic comedies go, this is excellent.  It has the usual cool ""fight"" scenes where the damsel gets rescued, gang problems, but in general it is light hearted with some drama moments as Misaki struggles with school, work, and Usui.

It doesn't get overtly melodramatic (as a guy, I seriously can't stand those animes where there's so much soap opera style drama that makes me want to scream at the girl and slap her a few times!)

And also has a sweet concrete ending that makes you feel good to have watched this show.

8439711,5,B004SGWYUG,This is another anime at the top of my list.  It has a great story and worth re-watching several times.  It's a 5 star and highly recommended.,1375833600,,142,4.222222222222222
8439712,5,B004SGWYUG,"I love Maid sama, if you are looking for some comedy/drama/sexy/kick butt sort of action then you should really check out this series. Misaki Ayuzawa is great in both her job (which is a bit annoying to her at times when she has to ignore who comes in and treat them all like simple customers), and as the president of her high school (though she is extremely hard on the men there, they need it in order to learn how to be civil towards girls and life. Though the demon part of it is a bit annoying as it shows up at least once every episode, so its a bit over done.) I like it how she has a guy stalker, Usui Takumi, (for once its not a girl following around a guy hoping that he will pay attention to her and what not) as he is the idol for the men at the school. It makes you wonder throughout the series what will come out of that odd relationship. I recommend buying both collections (its seems like its two seasons but its really just 2 collections of the same series. So if you really want to know what happens in this series you need to buy them both.",1357516800,,1060,4.076555023923445
8439713,5,B004SGWYUG,"Misaki Ayuzawa is a strong willed women with a head on her shoulders. Which is why the ever charming and semi-perverted Usui Takumi is there to throw her world a little off balance but catches her every time.

  Misa is constantly yelling at the boys of her High School for not obeying the rules and then later coming to the rescue of damsels. Not realizing herself to be one as well which gives Usui plenty of room to be her prince.

  You can fall in love with her(Misa's)shy but positive attitude, or dream about Usui's sweet and kindhearted attempts to win Misa over.

  For other anime lovers who have enjoyed films like Special A, Fruits Basket, or just plain comedy romance Maid Sama is the anime for you.

Hope that helps =]",1344470400,5,732,4.4772727272727275
