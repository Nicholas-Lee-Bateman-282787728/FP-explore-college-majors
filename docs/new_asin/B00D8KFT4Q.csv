8590602,3,B00D8KFT4Q,"Review is for the Grapevine 2013 DVD release. As another reviewer has stated the quality of the Ghost of Rosy Taylor is very jumpy with a lot of degradation and is extremely fuzzy. In my opinion it is on the edge of being barely watchable. Eyes of Julia Deep is crisper and quite enjoyable especially in the close ups, you can really appreciate Miles Minter's locks!",1508889600,4,366,4.5606060606060606
8590603,1,B00D8KFT4Q,A jittery transfer and poor video quality render these two fine films nearly unwatchable.,1490572800,4,89,5.428571428571429
8590604,4,B00D8KFT4Q,"Mary Miles Minter was sort of a Mary Pickford wannabe to some people so it was  nice to see that she could act. Unfortunately, her career was ruined by a scandal involving the murder of director William Desmond Taylor",1418688000,4,217,4.564102564102564
