Volume three of ""Ben 10 Alien Force"" has 4 more episodes of the epic animated series as his adventures with his cousin Gwen with her amazing psychic-like powers and his reluctant ally Kevin Leven with his powers of absorption.  And of course, you never know what alien creature will save the day in each episode thanks to Ben's new and improved Omnitrix.  Plus, the DVD has the epic episode ""X Equals Ben Plus 2"" where we meet the mysterious Alien X that may cost Ben his life if something goes wrong.

Also on this DVD there's a ""Villains Database"" where we look at profiles of many villains from the Highbreed to the Forever Knights to bounty hunter SevenSeven.

So that seems to be it for the first season.  Pretty soon the second season will be on DVD real soon.  Not to mention more new episodes on the way AND a brand new movie coming this Fall: ""Ben 10 Alien Force: Alien Swarm"".  Don't miss it !",1244160000,,933,4.383720930232558
