This is like a Western movie set in snowy Canada. Dog sleds and canes replaced horses. It is a search for Justice where the innocent are exonerated and the guilty are punished. The setting and limited characters tells of a lower budget, but it has a good story. I was surprised at the ending, weren't you? The right to keep and bear arms was operational then. There was no mention of wildlife, such as wolf packs. A dogs bark sent a bear away.",1461196800,,2897,4.522900763358779
