8544763,5,B009WSA96Q,"I watched this film at the 2012 San Diego International Children's film Festival, met the child actor ---Jiaqi Li, a real 9 year old country boy from An Hui, China. This is a great film with a touch story. A little 9 year old country boy who is in charge of a household: a old grandfather and a little dog. I love how the little Kaikai ""reading book"" for his grandpa in the cold evening. Touched by his love to his grandpa and the little dog. He has learn to manage his daily life ( school and home) while his parents working far away home. Super good acting from a 9 year old actor.
This film is the winner of 2012 best children film award of San Diego International Children's film festival, also the best child actor award winner. worth to watch it with your kids and our kids will learn a lot.
The English subtitle is good and easy to understand.",1352851200,,850,4.253086419753086
