5742020,2,B00CUIQHVG,"I'm sorry but I am 15-minutes deep into this documentary and all I am hearing about is the problems of these individuals.

When I'm watching health documentaries, I like to hear about either the latest or research or solutions from a self-care, consumer, or policy perspective, rather than dwelling on problems which are well documented from more scientific perspectives.",1475107200,,371,5.288135593220339

5742022,5,B00CUIQHVG,"This film may not touch of the Anecdote you are searching for -
because there are so many health conscious folks out there already doing this.  Check out Kris Carr - Crazy Sexy Cancer and various other programs.
If you need tools...find those who provide that - and one that works for You, not your family, not your friends...YOU!

What I liked about this film is that AFFIRMS the truth of what real health is all about - Taking responsibility of Your Body, Feeding it the foods that nurture and sustain, and Just Do IT.  If you need a boost in the right direction - watch this.  And then begin Your Journey.",1472860800,,608,4.401785714285714

5742056,4,B00CUIQHVG,"If you're reasonably intelligent and have already read a lot about alternative healing, I don't think you'll find any ""Aha!"" moments here. However, the film is well done, and I liked the fact that the interviewees were mostly not people I'd seen before. (It gets kind of old when the same folks are traveling the circuit and saying the same things.) This video is great to watch if you're new to self-health concepts or need a kick in the pants (in my case). I'm inspired to keep making changes and feel like I will watch this again in the future when I need encouragement.",1456963200,10,573,4.519230769230769

5742059,4,B00CUIQHVG,"I found this to be very informative. I am trying to transition into a much healthier lifestyle and this documentary gave me some good perspectives and opinions to consider. for someone with no intent of trying this approach or interest in these types of topics, it may seem a bit 'quackery' but as a healthcare professional I see that what we are doing is not working. And the ideas presented in this documentary are something to try in conjunction with good medical care.",1456876800,,472,4.698795180722891

5742062,5,B00CUIQHVG,"Great!  This movie motivated me to give real introspection on my personal diet and helped me realize that eating poorly is a crime to my own well being.  I'm now eating healthier and actually feel better overall.

 How could someone dispute this basic principal, eating nutritional foods make your body healthier.

I'm watching again in a month to stay motivated.

Best line of the movie ""Stop buying into stupid!""",1454976000,6,414,4.927536231884058

5742070,1,B00CUIQHVG,"The description should say it is about the raw food movement.  I turned it off when one of the speakers said we are meant to be vegetarians.  Vegetables are wonder foods, but we can also eat animal proteins, but better off from animal that eat what animals should eat.",1451347200,3,268,4.448979591836735
5742071,5,B00CUIQHVG,Amazing documentary with very useful information. I believe everyone should watch this and watch it with an open mind.,1451001600,,118,5.2631578947368425
5742072,5,B00CUIQHVG,I am always interested in documentaries on nutrition and health. This was informative. The individuals interviewed made some good points based on their personal experiences with all natural health and raw diets. Made logical sense.,1449100800,6,231,5.628571428571429
5742073,4,B00CUIQHVG,"This information on food is very valuable.  When it's working, it's easy.  When it's not, it's not.  It's very difficult to move from A to B to C but much much easier to get from D to Z.  My point is motivation.  I've lost 100 lbs. and I've put about 80 lbs. back on now.  I don't remember what triggered me to get going, but I remember having the attitude about eating good food like the woman on the movie.  She was so confident and simply saying ""it's easy.""  The reality is that it's difficult to get going.",1448928000,6,511,4.142857142857143
5742074,2,B00CUIQHVG,"Useless. I quit after 24 painful minutes. The documentary says exactly what you expect to hear (nothing surprising unless you're new to the raw foods issue), but lacks compelling scientific rigor. Typical pseudoscience lingo, but lacking even the pretense of evidence. They literally just say stuff off the cuff that they clearly made up in the shower and never tested in any sort of lab and the viewer is expected to just take their word for it. Pure hypothesis being presented as facts with the assumption that viewers won't know the differ inence. Their ""expert"" commentators sound like low-scoring grade school reports. Gullible and scientifically illiterate people will LOVE it!

As a documentary, it's little more than bland clips of talking heads strung together. I can understand low budget, but even with a cellphone camera, even an amateur like me could add dynamic shots and some kind of story arc to engage the audience. This felt like a YouTube playlist of archival footage that stuck to a theme, but wasn't interrelated to each other.

At least it encourages people to eat healthier, so I'll give it an extra star for that. If all you need is shallow inspiration, this will do the job if you're not a smart person. But for inspiration AND compelling scientific insight, look elsewhere. If I can find one, I'll try to come back and recommend a documentary that handles this vital topic with competence.

Update: Go see ""Forks Over Knives"" for a much higher quality treatment of the subject.",1448841600,4,1503,4.909448818897638

5742077,3,B00CUIQHVG,"I liked hearing different people's perspectives. Having all the Seventh Generation products behind the CEO of the company made it look like a marketing piece for the company. I wish they would have included someone who talked about how they grow their own food in a cold climate. It's great that you can do that in Southern California, but I always wonder how to grow your own food year-round when you are buried in 2 feet of snow. Unless you live on a farm and have the space for a root cellar to store winter vegetables, I don't know how you can achieve that.  Would love to see a video for those of us who don't live in a warm climate.",1445990400,8,638,4.2727272727272725

I had met the creator of this natural line of skin care back in the 60s when he first got the company started and he was a delightful human being with a wonderful product. Anyway, this video was amazing and I received a lot of inspiration from the film. It was like watching ""The Secret"" - for physical rejuvenation.",1512950400,2,422,4.3544303797468356
