8589435,2,B00D49E9BU,"So these aren't all the Famous just some of the more popular ones. If you have bought some some of the old Popeye on VHS, then this is basically what these are just in DOD format. Nothing special beyond a quick photo gallery of posters. You get 25 cartoons from the last Black and White cartoon and up to the last Famous cartoon fully animated. For the price it's so-so, but all you can have till someone begins to do the transfers like they have done with the older Fleischer era Popeye.",1407369600,3,488,4.315217391304348

8589437,1,B00D49E9BU,"I'm usually not one to post a review without fully experiencing the product, but I'm making an exception for this one because after three tries, twice directly from Amazon and once from a third party in the Amazon marketplace, I've received the volume two cover with the volume one disc. Amazon was very nice about this (they sent a replacement without my having to return the first one) but clearly, the manufacturer messed up when packaging this DVD. I wrote directly to the manufacturer, offering to send them the wrongly packaged discs at my expense, but they haven't responded.

Bottom line: caveat emptor. I wouldn't buy this DVD again except in a store where I can open and inspect it first. I already have the Fleischer Popeyes on the WB sets so I don't need the vol 1 discs I received. If someone from the manufacturer reads this and sends a verified, corrected copy, I'll be happy to return what I have and edit this review.",1394496000,8,934,4.626506024096385
