3960081,5,B002NTDX9G,"Megafault is a SyFy channel original, so no, it's not a big budget, ""2012""-esque disaster movie.  It is, however, very entertaining!  Brittany Murphy (in what I believe was her penultimate starring role) is wonderful in her role as a seismologist trying to stop an earthquake (caused by the titular Megafault) from destroying half the U.S.  Eriq LaSalle is great as the ""everyman"" that the viewer can identify with.  After being saved from his jeep that had fallen underground, he joins Brittany on her quest.  Yes, the movie is farfetched.  But it is also action-packed, and it's almost non-stop special effects.  We get to see cars swallowed by huge cracks in the earth, buildings destroyed, gas manes blowing up houses, and much more.  Taken for what it is, a low budget SyFy movie, it is very well done.

The picture and sound quality on the Blu-Ray disc is top-notch as well.  Definitely an improvement over the DVD version (which I also have, as I purchased it before I realized this was also available in hi-def).

If you are fan of this type of movie, definitely check it out!",1265760000,2,1084,4.74331550802139
3960082,1,B002NTDX9G,"This movie was hilarious.  My husband and I had a great time making fun of the absolutely  horrible special effects (reminiscent of the old Power Ranger shows).  The acting was so bad it was funny but truly, the special effects were what truly made the movie entertaining.  It's only worth watching if you have a warped sense of humor like we do.  It was seriously so bad it was funny.",1264896000,22,385,4.442857142857143
3960083,3,B002NTDX9G,"We start in the hills of West Virginia where Charley ""Boomer"" Baxter (Eriq LaSalle) is blasting a mountain. By accident, Baxter set off a masssive earthquake that is felt as away as Washington D.C. were Dr. Amy Lane (Brittany Mruhpyy)is with her fmaily. Within a giant Megafault is created that is racing across the country, leaving death in it wake. With the help of Dr.  Mark Rhodes (Bruce Davidson) and serect miltary weapon that came create earthquakes, Lane and Baxter race to the stop the megafualt before it hits Califoria.
""Megafualt"" is not a great movie but really not that bad. The writers have all the usual things that you expect to.  One person that is right while everyone else is wrong, cute kid, the one character that you know will be dead before it over, the miltary that is either the cause of the problem or has the secret weapon to save the day. Overall Megafault is the type of movie that Syfy puts out and you may just want to rent it instead of buying it.",1263686400,16,980,4.5
3960084,5,B002NTDX9G,"Exceptionally cast and probably hands-down the most accurately portrayed disaster movie yet.  A real nail-biter from the opening credits till the end.  It's a story of the triumph of hope and love over despair and disaster.  I wouldn't be surprised if this movie isn't listed as a must-watch in film school for emerging filmmakers. An excellent example of the study of human condition. I cried full tears at the end (I won't spoil anything, but it's very touching).  I also did a Costco run and loaded up on provisions... just in case!  BRAVO!  My only criticism is in a couple shots the CGI didn't look completely realistic.",1263340800,3,625,4.794392523364486

3960090,4,B002NTDX9G,"I never watch these disaster movies expecting to learn any hard science, and rarely do. This one was laughably inaccurate and unrealistic. Then again, it's entertainment and in that respect, I had a great time.

The plot makes little sense, but I didn't really care. I had a good time watching the disaster unfold as Brittany Murphy runs around trying to stop it. Though she is not a classic beauty, she has her own unique cuteness and she can actually act.

At times I was wondering if the actors were having trouble keeping a straight face as they went from scene to scene.

For a straight-to-video release, this movie had all the quality I would expect. It is nowhere near realistic, and the plot holes are big enough to drive a locomotive through, but I thought the movie was a hoot. Look at it as pure entertainment. It certainly beats the rash of slasher and vampire flicks that have been dominating SyFy lately.

And pretty much everyone around her tries to help. To the point of stealing a helicopter, and later giving her use of ""the fastest helicopter"" on earth. Really? As if any scientist would be treated like that. And wouldn't people be concerned about their own families in a major disaster rather than thinking about getting her to hers? But no. Only one other person even mentions family...but when he sees his mother's house explode he assumes she is dead...um, maybe she wasn't home? But that frees him up to tag along with Brittany's character even though there's no reason for him to do so at that point  - except to steal a helicopter to help her reach her family.  Because of course, you would commit a felony to help someone you just barely met. And Brittany's boss (or colleague, it wasn't clear to me their relationship) just had to drive her around at the end to help her look for her family... guess he had no family or friends he cared about either.

The movie uses CG graphics for the special effects.

This film is no different than other Asylum/ SyFy disaster films which all have the same basic plot. This one was not as much fun as some of the other ones, except for the fact Brittany Murphy is the most unconvincing scientist I have ever seen.

3960111,4,B002NTDX9G,"I am a fan of disaster flicks.  There can never be enough disaster flicks to suit my needs.  Which forces me to consider any and all entrants in this category.  Megafault is just one in a long line of similarly plotted epics involving the possible end of the world.  In this case, a seismic fault starts to tear across the country.  With the help of a secret satellite weapon they desperately try to stop its progress, try to divert its direction, and finally, when it doubt, blow it up.  The FX is about what you can expect from this era of CGI.  It doesn't look any more fake then the tiny models of yesteryear that Godzilla routinely stomped on.  The story is par for the course; all disaster movies follow the same formula.  There's always the obligatory scientist (seismologist Dr. Amy, played by the late Brittany Murphy), the military is always represented by someone, and the hero (Eriq La Salle as Boomer) who has to save the day.  For good measure, they even tossed in Bruce Davison as Dr. Amy's mentor.  It's a thankless role; he really doesn't do much in the scheme of things.  There's also a child in jeopardy (Dr. Amy's daughter).  Homes get wrecked, highways are ripped apart, people combust.  And it's all made terribly official by place names and times periodically appearing on the screen.  Will humanity survive!?!

My rule of thumb for disaster flicks is the more ridiculous the premise the more fun it is.  This movie pretty much satisfies my quotient of fun.  It's a keeper.",1404259200,3,1496,4.645038167938932

That line perfectly sums up Megafault. It stars the Late Brittney Murphy as Dr. Amy Lane, World Renown Seismologist.  Bulls Eye casting . Though rumor has it Brittney Spears was the first choice but she was bald at the time which just didn't seem right.  Eric LaSalle plays Boomer. A man who since childhood was a gifted blower upper. Though maybe a bit short on geography and physics.  Dr. Lane: ""We would have to move the Grand Canyon."" Boomer: ""Why can't we?""  And to fill the role of mature authority figure and mentor, Bruce Davison.  Fresh off his record setting run as Willy Lohman in Death of a Salesmen at Larry's Dinner Theater and All you can eat truck stop buffet on route 38, Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Pure casting brilliance.
 Throw in budget busting special effects by the famed CGI creator that brought you such hits as Pong and Space Invaders and you have it all. Acting, writing and a visual experience that can only be described as astounding. As a footnote, kudos to Megafault for showing once and for all that earthquake faults do indeed chase after moving vehicles.
 And I must mention Director David Michael Latt whose deft touch was responsible for this quality production. A budding genius who has brought such classics to the screen as 'Jane White is Sick and Twisted'  and  `The 18 Year Old Virgin` (Producer) .  Most notably the true 2005 gem, War of the Worlds. Not the hack version thrown on the screen by that Spielberg character. I can only give this classic my highest recommendation.

3960138,1,B002NTDX9G,"""Megafault"" is a disaster film from Syfy (formerly known as the Sci Fi Channel), starring late Brittany Murphy as Dr. Amy Lane, a scientist trying to stop the global disaster caused by an enormous earthquake. Though the premise looks like some Roland Emmerich movie, ""Magafault"" is far less entertaining with an impossible storyline, cheesy effects and inept direction. The horrible film is, however, not without entertainment value in an ""Ed Wood"" kind of way.

I don't want to repeat the story here. In short, it is about a big fault destroying the whole country. A huge fissure runs, swallowing up people (about 20 or more), destroying buildings (created by cheesy computer graphics), while our heroes and heroine are desperate to save their family, and save the day, too. This is a familiar format so poorly executed that some parts of it have become an unintentional comedy.

I don't need scientific accuracy in this kind of action films, but when a crack in the ground starts chasing a tank truck in the two-lane road accompanied by lots of explosions (fake ones, I guess), there is something wrong with the script. The huge fissure runs across America, from east to west, hitting some of the big cities while seismologists talk about the possibility of ""stopping"" the quake. With this silly story and boring actions, ""Megafault"" doesn't have a chance from the beginning.

The cast includes such talented actors as Brittany Murphy, Eriq La Salle and Bruce Davison. They are doing their best with what they have been given, and should not be blamed. Sadly this is the last TV production for Brittany Murphy, who passed away on December 20, 2009.

The film is directed by David Michael Latt, co-founder of The Asylum, one of the most prolific independent studio producing straight-to-DVD titles such as ""Transmorphers,"" ""The Day the Earth Stopped"" and ""2012 Doomsday.""",1269302400,9,1872,5.009646302250804
3960139,2,B002NTDX9G,I live literally on the same road as some of the scenes. This movie has pathetic graphics and is amusing for those of us in the Quad Cities where it was filmed. Mountains edited into the background in the great plains. I even know the guy driving the RV at the end. I got it simply for the amusing scenes of my town falling apart.,1267833600,2,330,4.092307692307692
3960140,2,B002NTDX9G,"Brittany Murphy's tragic death may have interrupted a talented actress' bright future but this megabomb certainly isn't a high point.  Badly miscast as a seismologist (??) and saddled with a horrible script, Murphy sleepwalks through this film surrounded by shoddy effects and shameful performances from co-stars Eriq Lasalle, Bruce Davison and Paul Logan.  SyFy should leave disaster movies alone if  this is the best they can do (although it's better than 2012 SUPERNOVA).",1267315200,6,474,5.465753424657534
