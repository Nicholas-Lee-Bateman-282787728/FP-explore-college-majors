7912098,5,B00000JGL3,"What's to say? I love Bob and Margaret. Drolly funny! Great British humor. Somebody needs to get with it and provide ALL the episodes on dvd, not just season 1 or two >_< (and in the North American format!)
I bought these 2 episodes on VHS(!) because I have execrable internet and I cannot download or stream movies. Luckily I still have a vhs player ;p
Oh and yeah, if you've got this far you know that these aren't kiddies' cartoons but made for grownups to enjoy, not that there is anything shocking in Bob and Margaret.
Lovers of the droll, sublime and mundane untie!",1396656000,,571,4.447619047619048
