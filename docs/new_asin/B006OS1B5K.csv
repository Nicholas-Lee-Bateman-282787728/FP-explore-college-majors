5010848,4,B006OS1B5K,Most of the movies were very good and really held my interest through out. A couple not quite as interesting.,1351123200,,109,4.5
5010849,3,B006OS1B5K,"but they came damaged. Now I live in Bangkok and I do pay a lot for shipping and sometimes VAT too, which really hurts. I am a disabled US Veteran and have to watch my funds. I know many are doing that too now. Hope things change in Nov. change!
Well one of the movies came disloged and was scratched. The tin was bent up too, so not happy with all of that. It is not worth it for me to send back then pay for reshipment and chance of Vat. So do not know what to do. Thanks",1348444800,4,473,3.787878787878788
5010850,5,B006OS1B5K,"Pretty good selection of films in good shape but for us hard of hearing, no subtitles. DOA is one of my favorites in the list.",1340496000,8,126,4.08
5010851,5,B006OS1B5K,"Right off the bat, I have to assume that the only way anyone can put together a collection of 10 films noir and sell it for less than 10 bucks is to get the movies from the public domain and not have to pay any royalties for them. Usually, collections assembled in that way are pathetic at best, such as the ""50 movie packs"" of science fiction, westerns and other genre films that you can pick up for a song. Most if not all of the films in such collections are obscure, laughably bad grade-Z stinkers that are a total waste of time to watch. Plus, their video and audio quality typically suck big-time.

That's not the case for ""The Film Noir Collection."" First, the movies are not that obscure. In fact, some of them are genuine classics. Several are available individually (a quick search found ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whirlpool/dp/B0009X7682/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whirlpool</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-O-A/dp/B00008G8WR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D.O.A.</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scarlet-Street/dp/B000BGH2NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scarlet Street</a>,"" and there may be others). Eddie Muller covers five of these movies in his fantastic film noir volume ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-City-The-Lost-World-of-Film-Noir/dp/0312180764/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark City: The Lost World of Film Noir</a>,"" which gives them a lot of legitimacy. I haven't yet watched them all, but I have run all of them for a few minutes to make sure they played okay and to check out the video and audio quality. It should be no surprise if I say that the video and sound quality vary greatly among the films. They're unrestored and un-remastered, obviously, so their quality doesn't compare with films that have gotten professional treatment. But they're not that bad, either. Most of them are not as sharp as they could be, some are too contrasty and some are not contrasty enough, and the sound levels vary wildly from one to another. But all are very watchable.

The 10 films come five each on two DVDs, each with a main menu only. There are no chapter stops, ""making ofs,"" interviews or any other extras--again, for this price, that shouldn't be a surprise. The whole thing comes in a single plastic case tucked inside an embossed metal tin, which, to my mind, serves absolutely no useful purpose whatsoever, since the graphics on the tin are exactly the same as the graphics on the plastic case. Why not lose the tin and knock the price down a little more? But that's not a complaint. This collection is well worth its price, and any film noir fan should pick it up without a second thought.",1339545600,91,2789,5.622327790973872

5010859,2,B006OS1B5K,"I've only screened the first film, DOA, so far. The video quality is very poor. It looks like a capture of a 480p broadcast, not even 35mm quality. The sound is muddy and the picture lacks detail. I don't know what the other reviewers are gushing about. Maybe these movies were all made on crappy film, but I've seen lots of movies from this era that looked way better.

5010864,3,B006OS1B5K,Good collection- One problem- The bogart film is not noir. It is obscure in it's own way in that it is over the top to the extent of being considered camp. For historical purposes its an impotent oddball. Its like the cast and director of The Maltese Flacon went on a vacation and took cameras to make a real crappy but good crappy movie. The best films on here are public domain movies like Scarlett Street and DOA. There is nothing wrong with public domain movies you just have to be careful how much you pay. For 10 films this is a good deal but the cover is ridiculous and it needs to be pointed out its totally false advertising. This is a physically ill looking Bogart who seems sick until the end of the movie.,1515110400,3,717,4.279411764705882

They are far worse than other films of similar vintages I have seen.  In particular, I bought this for ""Beat the Devil"", but it is too poor to watch, whereas the copy that I lent to someone and unfortunately will never get back could be watched with great pleasure.  On the other hand, the picture quality on my lap-top is better, though not great and the screen is small.

Plus is the first film by Yul Brynner-the only film in which acts with a full head of hair, and WHIRLPOOL, an excellent study of a corrupt hypnotist, Jose Ferrer, whose crooked practises are finally revealed. Also of good value are- THEY MADE A CRIMINAL, IMPACT and SCARLET STREET. Enough said. This a collection I recommend to all lovers of film noir and/or crime films.",1473379200,18,705,4.693548387096774

5010978,5,B006OS1B5K,"An extremely cost-effective (and overall, quite good) ensemble of ten Forties-Fifties crime movies.  imdB ratings run from 6.1 to 7.5; overall picture quality runs from ""million-dollar matinee"" to pretty-OK cleaned up, but no wet-gate or other high-tech special release techniques were used.  The most puzzling (though welcome to me) inclusion is 1953's BEAT THE DEVIL, which is in no sense a ""noir"" but more of a screwball-ish caper comedy that became something of a cult classic. (Perhaps an available flick with the likes of Humphrey Bogart, Jennifer Jones, Gina Lollobrigida and Peter Lorre in the cast was irresistible no matter what its specific genre.)  Ironically, probably the biggest drawback to this set is that the pretty toleware-type box it comes in helps push the two DVD's together.  At this price, though, purchasers can easily budget in a couple of blank jewel boxes to keep the DVD's separate.  (Since the discs themselves do not appear to have been manufactured with an on-demand process, they should last quite a while.)

5010982,5,B006OS1B5K,"If you like Film Noir movies, this is a must have collection. And SO worth the price.

Lots of great picks on this DVD (as listed here) and the sound and picture quality are good too.

Love the metal tin this collection comes in as well, what a nice touch. Would make a wonderful gift for any film buff you like. :-)

Only thing that could have been a bit better was the interior packaging. It's not the usual plastic with spindles but rather a heavy foam that you ""click"" the DVDs back into, one right on top of the other. That I think could be better. I don't like any packaging where dvds sit directly on top of each other, too easy to scratch them if not careful.

Overall though, this is a definite film noir bargain!

5010983,4,B006OS1B5K,"This is a good collection of film noir films.  ""The Stranger"" directed by Orson Wells in 1946 is a gripping film that picks you up and doesn't let you go until the last frames.  It had one Oscar nomination for writing.  Loretta Young as Mary Longstreet is gorgeous and compelling, torn by love for her husband and her slow realization of his evil nature.  Edward G. Robinson makes a strong presence throughout the film, driving the case to its breathtaking conclusion.  Wells' penchant for close-up inserts and stark lighting choices make this an amazing film.  Richard Long who would later become a television star on series like ""The Big Valley"" does a good job as Mary's younger brother Noah.  The 2-DVD set opens with ""Whirlpool,"" a 1949 film directed by Otto Preminger about a woman (Gene Tierney stars as Ann Sutton) suffering from kleptomania who undergoes hypnosis and becomes a suspect in a murder of which she has no memory.  It's a gripping drama that has humor, but also keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The 1950 film ""D.O.A."" stars Edmond O'Brien who gets poisoned and tries to figure out who his killer is in the hours he has left.  The countdown to death adds a frantic pacing to the film which serves it well.  Pamela Britton who later became well-known for her work on the TV series ""My Favorite Martian"" sinks the film a bit as a secretary in love with her boss.  Her performance seems so melodramatic that it loses reality for me quite a bit.  The 1949 film ""Impact"" has a strong story about a hard-working industrialist whose wife tries to kill him.  Brian Donlevy turns in a somewhat wooden performance as Walter Williams.  Helen Walker plays his conniving wife to great success.  Her real-life car accident killing a war veteran turned the public against her, which reduced her choices to playing female villains.  Ella Raines plays Marsha Peters who befriends Williams as a talented mechanic in a small Idaho town.  ""Beat the Devil"" is a 1953 Humphrey Bogart film that is played tongue-in-cheek.  With a screenplay by Truman Capote and directed by John Huston.  Jennifer Jones plays the scatterbrained flirt who makes up delicious scenarios that the villains mistakenly believe.  Gina Lollobrigida plays Bogart's wife.  Peter Lorre sulks in creepy fashion.  While the film doesn't totally hang together, it is interesting and was named as one of the top 10 films of the year by the National Board of Review.  The other films in the set are worth watching.  There are some imperfections in the original films, but they do not overall distract from viewing.  The little tin box helps dress up the collection.  Enjoy!",1417046400,2,2641,4.798226164079822

My favorite movies in this collection are ""DOA"", ""Impact"", ""The Stranger"", and ""Whirlpool"".  The Bogart film ""Beat the Devil"" isn't my favorite film from Bogie; however, even a not-great Bogart film is a great film.  If you haven't seen ""The Stranger"", by all means watch it as soon as you can.  ""DOA"" is great, so much better than the remake.",1390867200,6,421,4.726027397260274

The price was very good, and the films may not be academy award calibre (The Stranger is a standout), but they are solid Film Noir examples with known actors like Bogie, Edward G., Peter Lorre, John Garfield, Gene Tierney, Vincent Price, Orson Welles, Jennifer Jones, Edmund O'Brien, Pamela Britton, Richard Conte, Jose Ferrer, Yul Brynner, Scott Brady . . .  and etc. Not bad for Hollywood stars and character actors.
