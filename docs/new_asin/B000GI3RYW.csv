8132660,5,B000GI3RYW,Ive always known about Mr. Hoover's visions. This movie only enlightened me more to the things he is trying to acheive. He has been an polictical prisoner for far to long. But I recommend this movie to everyone. FREE LARRY HOOVER.,1232409600,,230,4.634146341463414
8132661,4,B000GI3RYW,"This is a very informative and insightful documentary about a former Chicago gangleader. Larry Hoover got caught up in a criminal lifestyle on the streets of the southside of Chicago with the Gangster Disciples and is paying for it behind bars.  This documentary effectively uses an even-handed approach in letting the facts speak for themselves: There is no heavy-handed attempt to vilify Hoover, nor is there a ""bleeding heart"" angle when documenting Hoover's publicized and carefully orchestrated campaign to manufacture and exhibit his redemption -and quest for parole.
  The DVD was delivered in a timely manner as promised, I thoroughly enjoy watching it and would highly recommend it.",1198195200,,691,5.37962962962963
8132662,1,B000GI3RYW,"The documentary on Larry Hoover was pretty good and detail. I thought it would have more interviews with Hoover, but the ones that was illustrated was good. The information of the Gangster Disciple Organization being 4th on Fortune 500, blew my mind. I'm hurt that our brothers' and sister are being caught up in the game with gangs and drugs. This is a good DVD on the history of Chicago's most empowered gang in our history. Sincere prayers to Larry Hoover's entire family.",1157500800,5,475,4.734939759036145
