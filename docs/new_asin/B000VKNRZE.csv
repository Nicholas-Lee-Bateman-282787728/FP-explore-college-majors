And, it was entertaining, which is what any movie is supposed to do. Overall, it is worth the watch. I bought the movies for $7.99, instead of paying $4 dollar less for a three day rental. I rarely give away plot points, etc... But, I will say that you will know what happens to the American campers by what it said when it is just starting. This is a great way to quickly ""bond"" with the characters because you already know their fate. And, you just don't want to know what happened to them, you want to know how it happened.

2944699,3,B000VKNRZE,"Two young American women, a young American man, and a young Spanish man are in Spain preparing an English immersion summer camp for children.  Since this is a horror movie things eventually go very bad.  I expected this to be a slasher film but it's much closer in spirit to the [Rec] films.

This gets off to a pretty rocky start and improves in fits and starts in the second half--but every time it seems like Summer Camp is about to really take off it stumbles, losing steam until something eventually works again.  There's some suspense to be sure and the production values are slick--this is by the producers of the [Rec] series, after all, even though it is shot almost entirely in English--but Summer Camp is still something of a disappointment and even though it isn't an official [Rec] spinoff or sequel it does have the feel of filmmakers who have gone to the same well too much.  There's just too little inspiration and too many similarities to the superior [Rec] series.

But Summer Camp still delivers better production values and more suspense than most straight-to-home-video horror movies that you are likely to see this year.  Unfortunately, if you've seen the [Rec] series it's hard to shake the feeling that you've already seen this kind of thing before done much better.",1470528000,3,1290,4.783783783783784
2944700,5,B000VKNRZE,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It's from the same producers that made [Rec], and if you liked [Rec], you'll probably like this movie. Like [Rec], it has a small cast and is shot in a single location yet the attention to detail is higher than with many big-budget productions. The acting is excellent, the script is tight, and the special effects are well-done and used to good effect. The characters are smart and use their wits instead of blindly panicking.

Without giving too much away, four camp counselors show up a day early to Camp Owl (""El Buho"") and one by one are stricken with zombie symptoms. The novel twist of this movie is that the zombie infection doesn't kill you, and you can get better after being infected... and you can get re-infected again later. The main drive of the movie is the counselors trying to identify the source of the outbreak, but with the added twist of taking turns running from each other and not knowing who's infected--or if they're still infected.

The movie is full of nice touches; one example is that it is all in English yet set in Spain. Instead of ignoring this weird language difference, the movie embraces and incorporates it: the camp is an English immersion camp, so some of the counselors have been hired specifically because they do NOT speak any Spanish. The resulting language barrier is then incorporated into the plot, such as counselors not being able to explain to the locals what is happening, and the one time a counselor gets signal on her cell phone she dials 911... which of course doesn't work in Europe. While you might enjoy this movie more if you speak Spanish, I suspect that you might appreciate the characters' problems with the language barrier better if you don't.

The final explanation for the outbreak is very satisfying. Like [Rec], you never really feel like the world is in danger of a Zombie Apocalypse, but the final scene spends a few minutes showing that the outbreak has ramifications beyond just the four camp counselors.

I really enjoyed Summer Camp, and will probably watch it again.",1470441600,5,2073,4.75

2944704,5,B000VKNRZE,"The director of Camp Malibu a failing summer camp decides to invite rich alumni from ten years ago for a free weekend event, hoping that he can trick them into fixing up the place and also get their families to provide them some financial support. The boys and girls return to the camp and play pranks on each other and try to score with the other campers and the staff.
You get some great disco Summer Camp songs, a hot hitch-hiker flipping the bird, mud wrestling, a nympho who literally will bang anything and cant get no satisfaction, the hilarious fat party frat bully who says hes Clark Gable, loveable weirdos, tons of great small boobs but unfortunatley the gal we really want to see keeps her top on the whole picture (must have been the direcotrs daughter), a classic scene with the camp director talking on his video cassete recorder that had to be plugged into the tv while recording, a rough co-ed flag footballgame, lots of really bad dancing, the trite toga party, lots of montages, lots of boring hinjinx, zany sexcapades with 1970's hair pie, and probably most importantly and memorable the first true panty raid by the male camp counselours 5 years before the iconic scene in the 1984 cult classic Revenge of the Nerds. They strike oil and the summer camp is saved. Hallelujah! Bye bye 1970's and hello the more real 1980's.

Oh and I didn't mention the best thing. One of the three girls who show all the boobage is a super young Linea Quigley who was a boob virgin at the time and it is a site for all to enjoy!

It moves at a snails pace for something so exploitive. But it is still more satisfying than any Snicker bar. What these bad movies drill one song into your head over and over until it becomes entrenched in your skull and remians on your brain like a tatoo. Of course all these moives are great and so fun to watch for nostalgia so it makes the rewatchable factor supre high and most of these obscure classics.",1462320000,,1942,4.467605633802817

Oh and I didn't mention the best thing. One of the three girls who show all the boobage is a super young Linea Quigley who was a boob virgin at the time and it is a site for all to enjoy!

It moves at a snails pace for something so exploitive. But it is still more satisfying than any Snicker bar. What these bad movies drill one song into your head over and over until it becomes entrenched in your skull and remians on your brain like a tatoo. Of course all these moives are great and so fun to watch for nostalgia so it makes the rewatchable factor supre high and most of these obscure classics.",1462320000,,1942,4.467605633802817

Not terribly original, I suppose, but still -- well done!",1514937600,,142,5.217391304347826
8219186,5,B000VKNRZE,"This is quite possibly the single best film ever made, in the entire history of motion picture entertainment. The direction and acting are world class. The writing is brilliant and insightful. But the best thing is the war surplus 16mm film camera used to shoot this masterpiece. I am pretty sure that it is still slightly radioactive from its repeated use in  the eleven Operation UpshotKnothole nuclear weapons tests in the Nevada Test Range, in 1953. This residual radioactivity in the camera casing causes red, green, and yellow streaks in the film, throughout. Also, the film has bare breasts. So there is that.",1512345600,,616,4.980582524271845
8219187,4,B000VKNRZE,"Film quality is old slightly grainy film transfer.  Other than that this is an old style sexy romp as former kids return to camp as adults and play non kid games.  Practical jokes, shower peeping, and panty raids. There are several sex scenes, some comedic, some not.  Lots of topless female nudity,  some full nudity, a nude male streaker; chaperones and camper/ camper and camper / chaperone and chaperone love affairs abound.

 Mostly this is a plotless, pointless, old style teen camp comedy sex romp... ""Meatballs"" with 1/2 the comedy and 1000x the sexuality.",1507420800,,564,4.946808510638298
8219188,4,B000VKNRZE,"Not at all horrible. It never comes off as being very original, but there are enough tweaks to the standard tropes that it manages to be interesting. There was some occasional humor that stood out, and the setting was interesting. I won't be renting it again, but I'll rewatch it if it comes up on Prime or another streaming service.",1505865600,,333,4.566666666666666

8219191,4,B000VKNRZE,"This little movie twists and turns and keeps you guessing. Just when you groan and say ""I've seen this story before dozens of times"" the viewer is yanked in another direction. Yes, it sort of recycles the Summer Camp counselors from ""Friday the 13th"" and bits and pieces of several well known other horror films or genres (""Night of the Living Dead"" ""Halloween"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" come to mind) this movie takes these worn hand-me-downs and creates something new from them.  It would begin down a familiar path then veer in a different direction than I was expecting and therefor kept my interest. It's worth the rental at the very least.",1493596800,2,649,4.743362831858407

8219193,3,B000VKNRZE,"I decided to watch this movie with no expectations since there do not seem to be a lot of good HORROR movies anymore. Well, I think it helped me have an open mind to it and I can say that I actually enjoyed the movie overall. It definitely had some points in it where I laughed a good bit. The concept of the movie, however, is all too similar to movies and stories that already exist. They did it a little differently I suppose, but once you start watching it or I guess what's it really starts getting to the point you will know what I mean. It was definitely easy to figure out, even though I do think they tried to make it a bit suspensful. I do feel as though the plot had great potential and definitely could have been executed much better. I give it a 3 for not looking too much like a low-budget film, the laughs I had and the acting was pretty decent (Not like amateur in my opinion). Overall I would actually say the movie is a 2.5 to a 3. I wouldn't add it to my collection of DVDs, but I would probably watch it again.... Maybe",1488844800,,1039,4.073170731707317
