4263314,5,B0045O2PFK,"This are both good movies, De Niro is brillant in awakenings as is Robin Williams and with a bit of humour although mostly as thought provocking sad movie.
 The fisher King is also a very good movie and Williams and Bridges do a fine job acting it out. You do need to stay with this one to actually understand the different ways that all we can change peoples lifes with our actions wether intentionally or not.

Cheers. Rick.",1331942400,,426,4.448717948717949

A wonderful combination of his humor, his lovingkindness and compassion, his awareness of human trials, his dramatic skill that draw us all into his heart,  These two movies both bring a sense of hope, happiness, awareness and humor to very tragic conditions without minimizing the tragedy.

4263375,5,B0045O2PFK,"What can I say? Both of these movies are phenemonal. In Awakenings, Robert DeNiro does such as good job of portraying a person with his illness. He just wants to be treated with dignity. The other patients in the hospital each have their endearing qualities as well. Robert speaks up for the other patients. Robin Williams does a great job portraying the doctor who only wants to help the patients. He wants what is best for them and he wants them to live a full life. Robin plays the part perfectly with compassion and dedication regarding his patients. When his experimental drug seems to fail, he is heartbroken.

The Fisher King will break your heart as Robin's character has been through so much and yet he is so tender. Jeff Bridges character goes from being on top of the world as a popular DJ to becoming a video store clerk living with the store's owner. The movie follows the two characters and how their lives intersect and the struggles they both live with every day. Jeff's character is not very lovable at first. He softens as he spends more time with Robin. At the end it hard to say who saved who. I say they saved each other.

These two movies are a must have for any Robin Williams fans. I for one like movies where Robin can show the depth of his acting abilities instead of just playing the funny, crazy guy.",1420329600,,1328,4.460905349794238

The Fisher King is, in my humble opinion, Robin's best dramatic performance but the movie is difficult to watch; it's a harsh reality and has a turn that is both revealing and oh so hard to see. Still, a great movie.

Awakening, based upon a true story, is a gem all it's own. More serious than many of his movies, it is still a great film; hear-wrenching and hopeful.",1410912000,,511,4.554347826086956

Very humorous and spontaneous but has creatively expanded is art in serious film making.  In Awakenings he is so believable and passionate. A film based on a true story, Robin pulls you into the character and emotions of the doctor, the staff and the patients.  And Robert De Niro excelled in his acting and living in character. This is a truly must see film!

The Fisher King is a passable film. Robin Williams one again did an incredible job in playing his character. However the film just did not hit the tops of my must see again films. This movie is enjoyable but will probably not be watched again.",1381622400,6,749,4.694656488549619

Both films give Robin the opportunity to show the sweet touching and very human side of a brilliant and intelligent actor/comedian.  Robert De Niro is luminous in this exquisite performance.  Awesome.  Not to be out done by his aforementioned peers, Jeff Bridges gives a stellar performance as a supreme egoist who finds his humanity restored with the help of a homeless mad man.
