8745141,4,B019GMRAD2,"This German DVD is a beautiful, remastered transfer of Hero of Rome starring Gordon Scott. It's really only a three star worthy entry in the Sword and Sandal genre but the stunning widescreen color presentation merits another star. It has an English language soundtrack option too! You won't find a better copy of this film anywhere.",1461628800,,333,4.964285714285714
