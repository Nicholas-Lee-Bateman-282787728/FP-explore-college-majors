""Cornman"" - This here feller falls into some toxic waste and comes out able ta talk ta corn. (Yah, I know...) Cornman and sidekick Butterboy does battle wiff Dr. Hoe in one o' the corniest movies evah. Count yer blessings that it's only 69 minutes long!

""Dogs In Quicksand"" - A comedy/mystery wiff all sortsa plot twists that'll keep you guessin' right ta the end-- mainly y'all might guess why they made this thang in the foist place?

""Inbred Rednecks"" - No self-respectin' redneck movie's complete without a Bubba, Billy Bob or a Clovis somewhere or t'other. This here'n even has a mutant ""Bigass Rooster,"" a midget and a Peeping Tom! Sweet. Wiff over two hours wurf of backwoods slapstick 'n crazy cockfightin', you good ol' boys'll guffaw till the cows come home.

""Super Badass"" - Farmboy turned hero ""Super Badass"" goes up agin three nasty guys: a clown, a boogey man and a drug dealer. Heads'll roll, blood's gonna splurt, and y'all may wanna slit yer own throat durin' or after this'n!
