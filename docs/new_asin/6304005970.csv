753649,5,6304005970,"I know that this is sad, but being from the millennial generation, my only concept of Dame Maggie Smith was as stuffy nannies or prudish old maids. In fact, this characterization was so engrained in my mind that I was completely stunned by her portrayal of the sexual, humorous, and utterly fabulous Augusta in ""Travels with My Aunt.""

Directed by the great George Cukor, this light-hearted film is a sort of ""Auntie Mame"" meets ""The Pink Panther."" There's the exotic locations, the over-the-top costumes, the captivating central character, all wrapped around a thrill ride to rescue Augusta's kidnapped lover. Others have said that the plot was thinly held together. I don't know if I was so invested in what would become of Aunt Augusta and her nephew, or if I really wanted to know how the pair would pull off saving her old flame, but I thoroughly enjoyed the whole ride this movie took me on.

Smith certainly propelled the story forward. I couldn't wait to see what this boozy, untamable dame would do every time she inhabited the screen. Augusta is far from perfect, but just like her nephew (not to mention the Academy of Motion Pictures, who rewarded Smith's efforts with a nomination), I fell completely in love with her.

I would say that if you're a fan of the ""Murder on the Orient Express"" genre, then you won't want to miss this film the next time TCM shows it.",1260748800,2,1376,4.677685950413223
753650,1,6304005970,"Of this genre, Harold and Maude is perfection. Auntie Mame with Rosalind Russell is way up there, largely because of Russell's charming performance. Sadly, at the bottom of the heap is Lucille Ball's version....better known as Auntie Lame. Even worse is this dull, plodding dirge with a way-over-the-top (and surprisingly un-humorous) Maggie Smith. How she got an academy nomination for this painful performance is beyond cinematic reason. Avoid at all costs.",1260748800,4,459,5.47887323943662

And I wanted to find it on DVD. To my dismay it's not! What a shame! With a cast such as it has it should be. I wonder who do I put pressure on to get it released on DVD?

753652,5,6304005970,"I remeber seeing this movie in the theater and delighting at the action, the great locations and the fun of sharing the adventure in this often funny and heartwarming film. I'm sure I am not the only one waiting for a great DVD release of this film. I can only hope that whichever studio now owns the rights will make an effort to save this film on DVD. I know that fans of Maggie Smith would want that as well as those that remember the fine work of Director George Cukor.",1156982400,4,473,4.208791208791209
753653,5,6304005970,"Directed by George Cukor and though it's not in the same league as his famous hits such as "" The Philadelphia Story "" or  "" My Fair Lady "" I still have to agree with every other reviewer on Amazon and give this little known gem 5 stars.

Maggie Smith plays Aunt Augusta, a wild septuagenarian scoundrel who incarnates life itself.  No small acting feat, especially when she also portrays her as a teenager in flashbacks. Even with The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie by comparison, this is still her greatest achievement. Robert Stephens, her sometime real life husband, another great actor and co-star from The Prime plays her one true love, Mr. Visconti.

Too many magical moments to mention, though the scene when we first encounter Visconti at 'the most romantic railway station in Europe' as the present dissolves back to their first meeting is indescribable.

Oh yes, I haven't told you the plot have I?

Well let's see Alec Mc Cowan plays Henry, her nephew (""Be that the whole truth, woman?""--Louis Gosset) a middle aged banker who is set in his ways and---

---Oh, never mind! Just leave your dahlias behind in the garden to fend for themselves and climb aboard the Orient Express with Aunt Augusta.

And by all means, go first class. You never know when poverty might strike, like influenza.",1112054400,36,1294,4.72
753654,5,6304005970,"Best performance I've ever seen from our famous Maggie Smith, to immerse yourself in this movie is sure to cure anyones malady. At first a frown may appear on your brow, but once you understand the characters (especially 'Augusta' - Maggie) the true colours of fantasy, comedy AND reality where some are concerned - just shine through. I cannot understand how this movie has never really had the publicity it deserves, get your wallets out and buy a copy immediately. I'm about as selective as one can be when it comes to comedy's, particularly from the '70's but this is one you cant let go.",1090281600,14,592,4.647619047619048
753655,5,6304005970,"I found this an extremely enjoyable movie when I saw it in a theater, and can't believe it's not on DVD. If Brideshead Revisited can get a well-deserved mini-series, can't Travels With My Aunt even have a DVD? But if it comes to that, where's Wise Blood on DVD? The sort of shows that people pack college auditoriums to see don't seem to make it into general circulation. Brother Sun Sister Moon just made it onto DVD, for instance, and moviegoers have been trying to get Donovan's songs ever since the film first came out. Not being a fan of the Hollywood ho hum knock 'em dead box office smashes (which of course make it out in deluxe DVD boxed sets with a zillion extras), I rather prefer films like Travels With My Aunt. Other films I've enjoyed include Olmi's The Tree of Wooden Clogs, Cinema Paradiso, Nadine, Bread and Chocolate, Cousin Cousine, Kings of the Road, and A Room With a View. I merely mention these few films for those absolutely alienated by standard Hollywood faire who would like something different, with the hope some of them make it onto DVD.",1089158400,8,1068,4.567708333333333
753656,5,6304005970,"Maggie Smith is deliciously wonderful as the unconventional Augusta, a woman with a shady and colorful past.  Arriving at the funeral of her sister after man years absence, she plucks her staid stick-in-the-mud  nephew from his humdrum existence in suburban England and drags him with  her on a journey of self-discovery, introducing him to her many Bohemian  friends as well as her West Indian lover Wordsworth played brilliantly by  Louis Gossett Junior.  Augusta's nephew is played with excellent British  stuffiness by Alec McCowan who finds out to his horror that there is more  to his own past than that of his Aunt. Compelled by a sense of duty mingled  with confusion he sets out to help the madcap Augusta in her bid to raise  the funds to free one of her old flames Mr. Visconti who is being held to  ransom by a band of desperate men.  This film is delectably funny, quirkily  humorous in a sardonic come sartorial way whilst at the same time  maintaining equilibrium in the form of its characters who are larger than  life but totally human and believable.  Maggie Smith however steals the  show with her portrayal of Augusta a woman with a past as colorful as a  patchwork quilt.  There are little twists and turns that add to the piquant  essence of the whole film, such as Henry's true parentage both maternal and  paternal, and Augusta's own self-interpretation of her life and actions  over the years.  The final scene will bring tears of laughter to your eyes  and you should be left with a good feeling because ""Travels with my Aunt""  is a feel good with a bit of a difference.",964569600,113,1596,4.675090252707581

It was meant to be Katherine Hepburn before the powers that be discovered that no amount of soft focus could make her look convincingly young enough for the flash back scenes.

For me, this film is a prime example of how long-standing reliables can lose their moorings and go adrift.  I felt this is what happened with George Cukor and Maggie Smith here. This is very badly scripted and directed, and Maggie Smith was beyond embarrassing,  She totally lacked her usual grasp and proportion and emerged garish and annoying.  Face it -- hers is an extremely scenery chewing performance throughout except for the young woman bits.  Calling it what it is, while noting it as a glaring exception for this gifted and usually disciplined actress.  Ironically, the same year she did a wonderful job as a similar type in a television version of ""The Millionairess.""  Overall, the era was one of wacky and outlandish farces. Unfortunately, ""Travels"" stands out as one of its misfires, despite many quality elements at hand.",1393372800,5,950,4.974683544303797
754332,3,6304005970,"While much of America watched the premiere episode of the new Downton Abbey, I watched Dame Maggie Smith in this 70's oddity - ""Travels With My Aunt""- directed by George Cukor and based on the novel by Graham Greene. It's the story of a stuffy British man whose mother has just died and his ""aunt"" who suddenly shows up out of the blue and leads him into a world of crime, travel, drugs, sex and ""adventure"". Maggie's basically giving a drag performance here- it's pretty ridiculous. Then there are the flashback sequences using the Liz Taylor ""White Diamonds"" lens. Amazingly this project was first developed for Katharine Hepburn! Maggie looks older as Aunt Augusta than she does today on Downton Abbey! Well almost. What is with this period and decaying, decrepit, decadent diva characters? The great diva characters of the 60's warped into these weird old floozies. From Hepburn's ""Madwoman of Chaillot"" to Angela Lansbury's take on the same character in ""Dear World"" and then later in ""Sweeney Todd""- the divas went degenerate in the 70's. Even Liza in Cabaret and the girls from Chicago were part of this phenom. Oh well. It's Cukor, so it's watchable if not especially likeable.",1390694400,,1185,4.900497512437811

The two scenes that stuck with me over the years

- Maggie has an asignation with a former lover who doesn't show up - her nephew (who may be her son and is the point of view) shows up - and there are burnt down dripping pink candles in a candelabra to show how long she waited - somehow the fact they were pink candles made it more poignant.

- When they get in in the illicit operation where money is exchanged and her nephew (or maybe son) who is a banker and formerly a totally stiff out of his element guy can flick through and count the money with ease

Truthfully - this is what I remember from the original release (in 1969!  I was 12 then! Not sure when I saw it) Somehow it has stuck in my mind ever since and I wanted to buy it but only recently has there been a DVD release.",1385510400,,990,4.103626943005182

754711,3,6304005970,"This is another one of those films which I've heard about for many years, but never got around to viewing until now. And my reaction is.... eh. Oh, it was mildly amusing on occasion, but I can't say it did much for me. And in the end, I found I didn't particularly care for any of the characters.

Interesting to note that Katharine Hepburn was not only considered for this role, she was signed and production had already started (or pre-production, at least) before she was fired. I can't find out just what the problem was; I've read conflicting reports as to why she was dropped from the project---or why she dropped the project (the phrasing depends on which explanation you've read). Well, at least it didn't cause any lasting rift with her longtime friend, director George Cukor, because he directed her in two additional films in later years...

I think Maggie Smith has fun with the role (she was nominated for an Oscar for this), and I absolutely cannot imagine Hepburn in the part; I don't think it would have suited her, as written. And I don't think Hepburn could possibly have played the title character in all the flashbacks; she was simply too old by that point. (Maggie, in contrast, was able to play the younger scenes easily enough since they were close to her own age; she was made up to appear much older in the present-day sequences.)

I've read a number of reviews that said the book was far better than the film, and I suppose that could easily be the case since I've never read the book. But the film itself, well... as I said, ""eh...."" You may want to try it if you're familiar with the source material, or if you are a fan of any of the actors involved, but I'm not going to go out of my way to recommend it.",1347753600,3,1734,4.429467084639499
754712,4,6304005970,"I was apprehensive when there was mention of DVD-R transfer of this title and being dubbed to order, but I decided to take the risk as its one of my all time favourite films.  There was NO need for trepidation, this is a wonderful, vibrant transfer, in 16:9, not some crappy pan and scan 4:3 effort from a dodgy VHS. Very well packaged as well.  The colours jump from the screen, the sound is pretty much stock standard for the day.  Maggie Smith is over-the-top hilarious, Alec McCowen is wonderful, its silly, sad, laugh out loud and heart wrenchingly poignant, all at the same time.  A real classic, and a must for any fans of classic cinema.  Directed by the great women's director George Cukor....what more would you expect!  Four star rather than 5 as there are some (very) minor black wea and tear marks on the print used for the transfer, but they are almost unnoticeable, and well and truly overcome by the great content. Buy without hesitation if its one of your favourites too.

754713,4,6304005970,"A very good filming of the graham greene late work about a widow and her nephew(who it turns out is her son)...the film is really about the relationships the aunt has and of course the film truncates the novel in parts and the film seems like it comes from a novel. Greene's characters (not all of them) are renown for their religiousness and he feels this is the best way to view characters and give them justice and the best writers are those with a religious sense of life. This shows in this film with its opening at a church a cremation...and aunt augusta is soon on a journey throughout europe the arab world and africa. These are all areas the author knows and there are memorable characters the african butler wordsworth,an american on a train as a companion to the banker accompanying aunt augustus,and mr Visconti.

The film looks superb in it's widescreen format. A lot of talent is behind this film starting with George Cukor's sure handed Direction. Anthony Powell's Oscar winning costumes just amaze you throughout. But, it is Maggie Smith who's the star here and she carries the entire film, effortlessly.

754719,4,6304005970,"""Travels with My Aunt,"" (1972), a comedy/adventure/dramatic film, was based upon a novel of the same name, penned by its greatly praised British author Graham Greene rather late in his long life, and his long, prolific, greatly-honored literary career. The script was written by J. Presson Allen; the short -109 minutes - full-color film was directed by George Cukor.

Stuffy retired bank manager Henry Pulling, played by Alec McCowen, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shakespeare-The-Animated-Tales/dp/B0002CHJS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shakespeare: The Animated Tales</a>) meets, at his mother's funeral,  his Aunt Augusta, an elderly eccentric with more-than-shady dealings, who has had no part in his life since his christening.  Pulling has never married, is presumably still a virgin, and looks forward to nothing more now than a lifetime of cultivating his suburban dahlias.  Until Aunt Augusta pulls him right out of his rut, and drags him along on a whirlwind adventure, as she attempts to rescue an old lover.

 The plot's episodic, and not as tight as some of the writer's great spy stories. But you can see the Greene touch in some of the book's flavorful characters. In addition to Aunt Augusta, there's the Turkish cop, Colonel Hakim, one of several powerful third world law 'enforcers' created by Greene, played by Daniel Emilfork. There's 'Tooley,' the airhead hippie girl met on the Orient Express (played by Cindy Williams, then at the height of her popularity in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laverne-Shirley-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000291Q3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laverne & Shirley - The Complete First Season</a>.  And Zachary, whom Aunt Augusta calls 'Wordsworth,' an emigrant from Sierra Leone, a part of the world with which Greene was very familiar, as he'd spent World War II there as a spy. Wordsworth, as played by Lou Gossett Jr., (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lou-Gossett-Jr-Three-Movies-Collection/dp/B000OHFF86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lou Gossett Jr. Three Movies Collection</a>) is fiercely in love with Augusta, a woman at least twice his age, and devotes his life to her.

All the leading actors do very well here, scenery is good, and pace is quick enough.  Cukor was, of course, known as a woman's director, and it would seem to most viewers, I think, that Dame Maggie was born to play Aunt Augusta, among other parts.  Still, I understand consideration is being given to remaking this movie, and I imagine there are other women in that stable of powerful English theatrical Dames who can play her: hello Dame Helen Mirren, Dame Judi Dench.  We shall see.

Greene (1904-1991), who was one of the more illustrious British writers of the 20th century, enjoyed a very long life, and a very long, distinguished, prolific writing career. Some of his writing highlights are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Power-and-the-Glory-Penguin-Classics/dp/0142437301/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Power and the Glory (Penguin Classics)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-End-Of-The-Affair/dp/0434305545/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The End Of The Affair</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Third-Man/dp/0140286829/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Third Man</a>. Many of his books were bestsellers; most - 56% is the percentage I've seen-- were made into movies, some more than once. He was one of the better-known Catholic converts of his time; many of his thrillers, as this one, deal with Catholic themes of guilt and redemption. He created morally complex characters, while he explored moral and theological dilemmas through psychologically astute character studies, presented in exciting dramas on the international stage.
