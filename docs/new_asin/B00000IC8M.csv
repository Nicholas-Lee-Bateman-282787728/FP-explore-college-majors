7910032,5,B00000IC8M,"Everyone should definately purchase this Flying Deuces & Restored Utopia print. There is no other Utopia dvd in general public domain that is as excellent as this remastered film of Utopia. Because of fine picture quality it makes Laurel & Hardy's (generally considered a lesser L&H film)film swansong very worthwhile'its like going on holiday. Get it. I'm still looking for 98 minute version,this is 82 minute version. Peter.",1332892800,2,426,5.279411764705882
7910033,4,B00000IC8M,"The 1939 Laurel and Hardy classic, FLYING DEUCES, has got to be one of the comedy duo's funnier films.  Stan and Ollie join the Foreign Legion in hopes that Ollie forgets a woman he had fallen madly in love with, Georgette (Jean Parker).  It contains an utmost amount of entertainment from the romantic angst that Oliver experiences to the climactic chase and airplane scenes.  But three of the touching and humorous scenes in the film are the slapstick and musical vignettes. First, the laundry scene definitely shows the duo in true form.  Second, Stan Laurel, always the playful, innocent, but somewhat bumbling fool out of the two, uses a bare mattress as a harp and plays ""Beautiful Dreamer"" while the two are locked-up in a jail cell.  Third, while Stan and Ollie are being chased by a band of Foreign Legion soldiers, they stop and sing and do a little dance-shuffle to the tune of ""Shine on Harvest Moon.""  Indeed, this is classic Laurel and Hardy at their best.

The 1950 film, UTOPIA (Atoll K), which was directed by Leo Joannon, their last effort, is funny in its own way.  No doubt there are signs that the film shows that it was an end of an era in slapstick comedy, but the Laurel and Hardy legacy paved the way for a limitless parade of comedy acts that would follow in their footsteps, such as Martin and Lewis who would grace the silver screen as well as television.  As one watches the film, it has a sitcom-like feel to it, and one wonders why the movie was not simply made for television.  Nonetheless, the plot of the film involves Ollie inheriting an island in the South Seas, but the catch is that he and Stan are the captains and sailors of their own sailing vessel.  Upon leaving the port they need an engineer to man the ship, and they hire a drifter, Antoine (Max Alloy) who is more of a cook rather than an engineer.  In addition, while en route to their island, they find a stowaway hiding in the ship's sails, Giovonni (Adriano Rimoldi), who happens to snatch Stan and Ollie's dinners.  When they arrive to their destination all chaos breaks out when they discover that the island has uranium, and yet again, Stan and Ollie get into another fine mess.

In spite of the pitfalls and the stories behind the making of UTOPIA and the exceptional FLYING DEUCES, the duo do indeed keep up and live up to their name as the most legendary comedy duos in American film history.  The films are little under 90 minutes each, and are great to watch back to back as a little matinee show.",1210118400,,2505,4.511061946902655
7910034,4,B00000IC8M,"Flying Deuces is perhaps the best Laurel & hardy film ever.  I loved it, however it is offset by possibly the worst Laurel & Hardy film ever in ""Utopia"", Stan Laurel looked very thin and unhealthy and old and Hardy was the biggest he had ever been in the films...although there were humorous parts to it overall it was a pretty big stinker...but ""Flying Deuces"" is worth the purchase by itself.",1064707200,,394,4.549295774647887
7910035,4,B00000IC8M,"i just wanted to clear things up for some of the laurel and hardy fans out there. i bought this dvd with some doubt because i heard the sound was out of sync. this is not true and the sound and video  are just fine and easily watchable. the picture quality isn't top notch by today's standards, but definitely nice, nothing you'll hate.
as for the content, the movies aren't the greatest things they've made, but its a good watch if you're looking for something to relax to at night.
note, if you're trying to decide which dvd to buy, and can't decide. DEFINITELY pick up the dvd that has ""busy bodies"" on it. i recently bought that one as well, and i must say thats my favorite film with those two. the dvd also has 4 other episodes on it.",1062892800,,740,4.24822695035461
7910036,2,B00000IC8M,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again: the studios really need to stop letting tiny, amateur production companies release their movies on DVD. This Laurel & Hardy DVD is a prime example of why. The most obvious and infuriating problem is that the soundtrack is not synched up to the action; it's about 2 seconds behind. Unless you enjoy ""the boys"" looking like a dubbed Japanese movie, this is going to drive you crazy. The picture quality is also really poor; I have a VHS copy of ""Flying Deuces"" that looks better than this. The trivia game was a nice idea, but poorly executed; ""what color is Stan Laurel's hair?"" How would I know---all their movies are in BLACK AND WHITE! Oy. I thought I was getting a nice double feature for a good price, but I ended up getting what I paid for: cheap movies. Save your money.",1049760000,5,820,4.437086092715232
7910037,3,B00000IC8M,one the whole its not a bad film but it far from the best of laural and hardy films but if your a real fan you won't be that disapointed.  HOWEVER....DURING THE FILM I DID NOTICE A SLIGHT DELAY IN THE SYNC WITH THE  SOUND OF THE FILM!,960249600,,234,3.8541666666666665
