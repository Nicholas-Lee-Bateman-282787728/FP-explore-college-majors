8096170,3,B000C76V04,"This title is currently unavailable, but it can be ordered under the same title, but under a new, up-to-date cover.  This tape uses observation to teach dancers how to spice up their lap dance routines in order to maintain or secure new custormers.  This tape is for dancers with some experience with dancing in a club.  I don't think the information will be of much help to beginning dancers with no experience or to women who want to do a dance for their significant other unless the core moves of erotic dance are known. For buyers who are looking for direct instruction on erotic dance moves, I'd suggest ""The Art of Exotic Dancing"" and ""Exotic Dancing for Everyday Women.""",1159574400,5,677,4.6722689075630255
