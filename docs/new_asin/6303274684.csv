626110,3,6303274684,"Young rocker wants fame and fortune but finds out he has talents he never knew he had and disrupts a corrupt business venture in the firm where he holds a regular job. Best scene in the movie: the kid (Anthony Michael Hall) goes to visit an agent and is overwhelmed with the insouciant and highly strung young man sitting at the desk, played by Robert Downey Jr. The whole film is worth this one scene. Look closely at the kid's wealthy girl friend's butler: Robert Downey Sr!",1293408000,,476,4.482758620689655
626111,1,6303274684,"This movie is really insufferable, It says it is based on a story by Mark Twain,  I picture him vomiting in his grave.  The writing is dreadful,  the acting is bad,  I never thought it would be painful to watch Robert Downey, Jr. but this movie can't even show off his talents. Anthony Michael Hall , with his pineapple jello salad hair, is unbearable,...
You need a one to five turd rating for movies like this.  And I'll give it the full compliment of turds.  There is no excuse for crap like this.",1263340800,13,500,4.32258064516129
626112,4,6303274684,Is a funny movie michael j clouse he reminds me of a friend of mine they look a like but it is funny tho,1261267200,,104,3.375
626113,3,6303274684,"Funny, silly, and creative.  This film aspires not to conform to the 'norm' of Hollywood's traditional comedies.  AMH does a great job of lending his musical talents to the film.  ""Love Is"" totally blew me away!  Robert Downey Jr's performance in the film is truly hilarious.  The ""Mailboy who would be King""!  While this film in no way takes itself seriously, it is seriously silly and a good choice for a light-hearted comedy.",1163030400,7,428,4.794520547945205
626114,5,6303274684,"I am speechless! Wait no I'm not! I love this movie! It is hysterical! I loved everything about it! AMH is brilliant! You have to love the story and the man can actually sing. If you love some of the songs in the film like ""What U Feel"" (the song you hear over and over again in the film) and ""Crazy World"" then look around to find AMH's album, (Oh yes, he has an album out) It's called Hall of Mirrors: Welcome to the Hall of Mirrors, and it features those tracks as well as others that just rock! I love the little things in this film! Like the jail scene! When Julius is in the jail cell with Judd Nelson and the two others, take a look behind them to see what is written on the wall. It says "" A.M.H. + BUBBA "" I almost fell off my seat when I saw that! It's just the little things tossed into each scene that makes this film a classic for me! Watch the little smirks AMH tosses around, or those blues bug out every once in a while. Robert Downey Jr. gives a very funny performance. You have to love seeing Downey Jr. and AMH back together again. They had such great chemistry in Johnny Be Good, it's great to see them together. They work so well off of each other, ever watch the two on SNL in the 80's?! Okay, I am done rambling! Buy this film! Find AMH's album, kick it to track one, ""What U Feel"", crank it to maximum volume and shake the neighborhood! If you are looking for a ridiculous film to watch, a movie to just make you laugh..this is the movie for you!",1028851200,4,1470,4.054982817869416
626115,4,6303274684,I love this movie!  Really catchy and well written songs impressed me the most and in the end credits AMH had a hand in writing or co-writing most of them.  Great dialogue and interaction with the other actors.  Not familiar with the Twain story but the plot is pretty basic with alot of fun and lively acting by AMH as well as all the others in the film.  I love this one as much a a Gnome named Gnorm which is not available for purchase.  I taped mine off the tv years ago!  If you are a fan of AMH and Jackson (every one has to start somewhere in the movie business!) and Nelson and Downey then give this one a shot.  It is not as bad as people claim it is and it is humorous and a good pace setting.  I hope you will give it a try.,1005868800,,735,3.8859060402684564
626116,3,6303274684,"This tape does a very nice job of showing some background information on Caesar and the battle tactics of Alesia, but disappointed me by not presenting the material in chronological order. It skips from modern Alesia back to battle tactics to Caesar's growth as a commander, to the Gallic Wars and back. My students found it unfocused and a bit difficult to follow and to stay engaged in.",996019200,3,388,4.720588235294118
626117,4,6303274684,"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Very intelligent humor.  Some silliness.  It is not the kind of movie that stands up to serious scrutiny and over analyzation.  It is a mindless comedy that has a ""cute"" story burried underneath.  Anthony Michael Hall is a great comedic actor and this is a great adult role for him.  The cameos by Judd Nelson, Robert Downey jr., and Samuel L. Jackson are very funny.  This movie is definitely worth watching twice.
A similarly funny movie is Overnight Delivery.",977875200,,516,4.666666666666667
7843786,2,6303274684,"This is a pretty terrible movie. I got it as a joke for a friend who asked for the other Hail, Caesar! with George Clooney in it. It has its moments of comedy, but overall it is extremely cheesy and I could barely get through it. If you like to watch movies to make fun of them, this one is perfect for that. Otherwise, skip it and go watch the one with Clooney!",1492473600,,362,3.9726027397260273
7843787,5,6303274684,I was so excited to find this movie on amazon! I remember watching it years ago and loving it.,1480982400,,94,4.0
7843788,2,6303274684,"""Hail Caesar"" was just being advertised on TV, and I thought I would really enjoy it.  I didn't bother to listen to the ad that said it would be in theaters sometime in February.  I went to the movie section and ordered it.  Imagine my surprise when I received the version I received in the mail.  It has nothing to do with the ""Hail, (COMMA) Caesar that is currently being released.  I didn't even notice that a COMMA was missing from the one I ordered.  It just goes to show that punctuation is everything.  Even in a silly movie.",1455494400,,532,4.313131313131313
7843789,1,6303274684,"This is one of the worse movies I have ever seen.  I don't understand anyone rating this above a one star.  Robert Downey, Jr. was only on screen about 5 minutes if that so don't think he is a star of this movie.  It's too bad that he wasn't because they needed some good actors.  Terrible writing + terrible acting = terrible movie.",1443657600,,333,4.238095238095238

7843792,4,6303274684,"I've loved Hail Caesar since I was about 5 years old. Best Anthony Michael Hall movie, by far and so quotable. It's the best, I had to replace my VHS since it started warping about a month ago. (I guess I watched it too much in my youth)",1373673600,2,237,3.9583333333333335
