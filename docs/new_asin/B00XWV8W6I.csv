Well told story and I am now a fan of Ms Valerie June (who sang the outro). This was so good, I'm going watch it again. Probably get the DVD too.",1437350400,12,278,4.58
7202126,5,B00XWV8W6I,This is an awesome movie with a plot twist you'll never see coming. It's a shame this film was not promoted as much as it should have been. Well worth the money. Viola Davis and Jennifer Lopez were great as usual!,1437264000,2,213,4.219512195121951

7202130,4,B00XWV8W6I,"This is a revenge/vigilante film with Viola Davis and Jennifer Lopez as women that have each lost a child and meet at a grief support group. The police won't do much if anything to find justice for Davis' character (Lila) so Lopez (Eve) takes her under her wing and they go on a mission to find the person or persons responsible for their heartbreak.

The acting was of course very good,Davis being the stand out. I give Lopez credit for allowing them to shoot her in bad lighting and not wearing corrective makeup. She looked like any other woman in this film and I find that empowering to other women.

There were some good action scenes and suspense throughout. There was also a big twist that wasn't expected but the problem is this premise has been played out and used countless times. Please don't read all the reviews as they give away the twist with no spoiler warnings.

Both are  really good playing women who take back their power. Davis is always a joy to behold and her performance is even getting Oscar buzz!",1437091200,22,1022,4.538043478260869
7202131,5,B00XWV8W6I,This is a great campy revenge film. The ladies are super cool and i think this film will be remembered many years from today. The filmmakers get great performances and J Lo give her best performance since Out of Sight and Viola is a wonderful actor who might get some awards for her honest performance as a grieving kick ass mom,1437091200,7,328,4.39344262295082

7202135,3,B00XWV8W6I,"Pretty good movie. I liked the actors, and the plot twist. The ending was kind of dumb (the explosion). It was better than about 80% of the movies I see on Amazon.",1506643200,,163,4.125
7202136,4,B00XWV8W6I,"Excellent movie that is thought provoking.  It makes you wonder what goes through the minds of mothers who lose their kids too early.  In this case, the mother, Lila, goes to a support group after her son was killed by a drive-by shooting.  While at the group, she met a friend, Eve, who she chooses to be her sponsor so that she can be supported to reach her goals.  Lila is able to relate with Eve because Eve seems to know what Lila is feeling and offers just the right advice to make her feel better each time.  However, is Eve really trying to help Lila or is Eve using Lila to satisfy her own craving for danger.  What you discover later in the movie will be a shock.  It's a smart movie and well directed.  The acting is quite good including J.Lo.  Nice job and great story telling.",1505433600,,789,4.241610738255034

7202140,5,B00XWV8W6I,"Great actresses!!!Great story line and surprises abound! I am astounded by the fact that never hearing anything about this movie, I was pleasantly surprised by its content and delivery. You must watch it to the end! Viola Davis outshined the ever popular J Lo for me anyways!  They both worked well together and I never saw the twist coming! A little justice never hurts, especially for a grieving mom!

7202165,5,B00XWV8W6I,"""Lila & Eve"" is a riveting, from beginning to end, film about a Mother's quest to seek Justice whilst simultaneously attempting to obtain closure regarding the  loss of her Son.  The few people who left negative Reviews simply did not appreciate the very original and creative approach that the makers of this exciting film used to tell the familiar Story of a grieving Parent's need to deal with the tragedy of losing a Beloved child.

I had thought for a fraction of a second to replying to the few naysayers but as in so many similar situations I quickly realized there was no point.

Movie goers will either love this film or not.  And fortunately it appears that most Reviewers agreed that Viola Davis and Jennifer Lopez turned in truly first rate, outstanding performances.  Never over-acting nor under-acting.  In every single scene they both hit that special ""sweet spot"".
All the supporting cast did equally outstanding jobs at getting their ""characters""  just right.

I would be remiss if I did not stress once again that LILA & EVE does an incredible job of taking the Classic theme of Human Beings attempting to obtain Justice for themselves and their Loved ones, and succeeding in finding a totally new way to deal with such familiar Movie Terrain.

This film possesses non-stop Excitement and Suspense, Feelings we can relate to, Heart and even a touch of Philosophy.
It avoids the many potential pitfalls it might have engendered in the hands of a less astute and less skillful Director working with a less talented Cast.
We finish watching this truly exciting Movie feeling great empathy for the Character played by Viola Davis who is unquestionably an Actress of the First Rank who achieves a Tour de Force performance.
LILA & EVE is a NOT TO BE MISSED MOVIE which can easily be viewed more than once, each time noting subtle nuances not caught on the first viewing.  Kudos all around to the Director and Cast.",1498435200,2,1927,4.79154078549849

7202180,4,B00XWV8W6I,"I thought this was an good movie.  It would appear that Eve was Lila's alter ego.  Nevertheless, in order to make your audience believe that Eve is real, at least until such time as it is revealed that she was an extension of Lila, brought out by her grief, she should have been portrayed as a believable person - she was cold, unfeeling, untouchable  (although grief can shell shock you) and her only focus was killing.  It was pretty hard to imagine that Lila as portrayed by Viola Davis was a cold-blooded killer.  Jennifer Lopez' performance, while I liked her, it was not her best work.  She was not convincing - but rather came off almost inhumane.  There were no real facts to tie her in as grieving mother
other than the scenario Eve verbally  depicted - no pictures, flash backs of the past or even tears as she spoke about her little girl - I don't even think she shared her name. When asked about her life, Eve sang a song that Lila also knew the words to.  She had no other friends or relatives,and no one else in group had ever met her, even though Lila met her at a group meeting -  which led me to the conclusion that she must have been an alter ego, who forced Lila to carry out her missions, even when her better judgment got in the way.  And where was she in those humanistic scenes (interactions with others) when it counted.  No, she was an alter ego birthed out of Lila's grief..  Looked at through such a lenses, the story line makes far more sense and hence is more cohesive..",1496707200,,1499,4.329749103942652
7202181,4,B00XWV8W6I,"I love Viola Davis so I wanted to see this film. Overall I like the idea of the movie and just how far a mother will go for justice. However, I wanted a little background on Eve I think that would have enhanced the movie. It's not my most favorite film starring Viola but it sure was interesting. I don't know how plausible it is for a grieving mother to outsmart and kill that many gangsters and the police let her go. As always Viola did a great job acting, and I really did like the moms' support group. Those ladies had each other back.",1496534400,,540,4.152380952380953

7202187,3,B00XWV8W6I,"I don't know what the high ratings are about. This is a typical revenge film caste in the theme of mothers who have lost their sons and daughters to gang rated violence.

7202203,3,B00XWV8W6I,"No one's going to win an Academy Award for acting or anything with this low budget revenge flick, but it is a decent, albeit predictable movie. Basically Lila (How to Get Away With Murder's Viola Davis) is in a support group of women who have lost their a child to violence on the streets. One of her two teenage sons was gunned down while walking through a well known drug dealing corner. Although helping to some extent, the support group isn't solving the fact that no one, including the police seem to be that interested in putting in much effort in solving her son's murder. No one except Eve (Jennifer Lopez) who Lila encounters outside who earlier walked out of the support group when another woman was talking in a way where no doubt everyone else wanted to get up too, but out of courtesy to the speaking woman's feelings probably didn't. The two women share thoughts of injustice and that if they do what the police and other victims tell them they should, justice will never arrive for their murdered child. Lila finds a gun in her alive son's school bag, she's angry with him but Eve points out he's scared, what else was he supposed to do? Eve convinces Lila to take that gun with her to the street corner her son was murdered on and demand answers.",1479168000,,1262,4.491304347826087

7202248,4,B00XWV8W6I,"Lila and Eve is a feel good movie in many ways, but you would not suspect that. Viola Davis plays a bereaved woman, Lila, whose son was murdered on a corner in a drive by. How do you get over something like that? Eventually you go to a support group for grieving mothers. Here she meets Eve, played by Jennifer Lopez. Both are feeling powerless, unable to function, until they come up with a plan.

This is a film that everyone can understand. A murdered child, another child at home, and how do you cope? The police don't remember you or your name, never mind your dead child's case. They tell Lila what they have, but not enough evidence to do anything, no names, soft clues. In the interim Eve suggests Lila should liven up her house, coats of paint and new decorations suffice. Out in the real world dealers are being killed, houses burning, names revealed and some kind of justice occurs.

It is the acting of these two stars that keep this film moving, otherwise, it would be lifeless. I liked the film, guess the twists and turns, and hoped for the best.

The movie is a well calculated story about revenge.  From the cornerman all the way to the top of the food chain, Lila takes revenge with her alter ego Eve into her hands and makes ""them"" pay for her son's death.

7202290,5,B00XWV8W6I,"Definitely worth 5 stars...the twist towards the end is worth 2 stars on its own, that was simply put ingenious and caught me by surprise.  At first I did not like the twist, but as the film moved on I realized that throughout the film there were signs here and there pointing to the ""obvious"". The film is one of the best thriller-dramas I have seen this year. Also, worth mentioning is the ending song by a newly discovered artist Valerie June.  After hearing, ""The Hour"" from her album ""Pushin' Against a Stone"" I was hypnotized by her magical voice and the rhythm of the entire album.  So additional star for that !  Lila & Eve (2015) --hands down-- has the best ending song from all the movies I have seen in the year 2015.  The best opening song for this year goes to Vacation starting Ed Helms and Christina Applegate, with ""Holiday Road"" by Lindsay Buckingham released in 1983.

Lila & Eva is a film about a mother whose oldest son gets murdered and who seeks out revenge on the perpetrators of the senseless crime.  The film like no other depicts the pain a parent goes after losing a child (someone who has kids can understand this better, or someone who has lost a child can understand this emotion better).  The film is somewhat unrealistic, for here we have a middle age woman/mother (an office clerk by profession) unfamiliar with things like breaking into people's apartments or better yet shooting people at point blank distance...I guess the only thing that can justify such behavior is the grief and anger that goes through such a person. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this film for the simple reason of being intense and dramatic...it should keep you interested till the very end.

BTW: Viola Davis is unforgettable in the role of Lila. Deserves an Oscar nomination.",1450656000,,1787,4.68370607028754

As another review has observed the twist has been used many times before.  Nonetheless it all plays out well.  I have watched The Boy Next Door endless times even though it has a formula plot but this one is more original and Jennifer is more raw in her role.  I have watched this twice and am still noticing new scenes so that's a good thing.  I watched this film again fully awake and I am telling you IT IS AN AMAZING MOVIE!

This was a boy with college on the horizon; a good kid; a kid with a fantastic future until he was gunned down in a drive-by.

I never heard of this movie but seeing the two female stars in it I didn't think I could  pass it up and I am so glad I bought it and saw it and loved it.

7202381,4,B00XWV8W6I,"What's the latest slogan? ""Black lives matter"" could be the theme of ""Lila and Eve,"" but not quite. It's not enough. What's enough is to take seriously, very seriously, a mother's grief and anger especially when the police seem to be coasting when a black life is taken. So, in the end, all is not what it seems. Black lives do matter, and Puerto Rican lives, even in overwhelmingly frequent murders being investigated by too few police officers.

That said, Viola Davis is the focus character, a grieving mother over the loss of her older son, and Jennifer Lopez is the voice of action, whatever it takes, to seek revenge and resulting satisfaction in that revenge for the death of her daughter. They meet at a support group for mothers of slain children. This group becomes pivotal to the plot several times and shows exactly what the word ""support"" means
.
I find Viola Davis a fascinating actor. She is not classically beautiful nor does she wear makeup that makes her beautiful as female actors are won't to do, especially in movies. She actually looks as if she lives an ordinary life in a lower class neighborhood, thus she fits the role. Jennifer Lopez does the same. No glamour here.

The only weak link is Shea Whigham, who plays the detective investigating the son's murder. I didn't like the askance glances he employs in speaking to people, particularly Lila, Davis's character.  Other reviewers mention the surprise twist (which did surprise me). It makes Lila seem more believable and human.

Modern America, with its drugs and drive-by killings, is on trial in ""Lila and Eve."" While the verdict in this one case may be satisfying on some levels, there is the question of moral and ethical turpitude. The indictment is not toward the police or toward vigilantes, but toward the extremely far direction America has come to reach the level explored in this film. It should open frank discussions.",1441497600,,1909,4.810975609756097

I think this movie had potential to develop a deeper plot and better character development, but it missed the mark. The ending, with the anticipation of a big twist fell short of living up to the hype.

7202418,2,B00XWV8W6I,"Surprisingly dopey vigilante flick had potential--the stuff that actually works suggests a smarter version of the limp Jodie Foster revenge movie The Brave One.  Unfortunately Lila and Eve has no interest in being an exciting thriller and wastes a huge amount of precious screen time on a completely unnecessary gimmick that many viewers will see coming a mile away--especially if they've seen a certain Brad Pitt flick...

Viola Davis is excellent but she can only do so much to raise the level of the material.  Jennifer Lopez isn't terrible for a change but she still manages to be one of the main problems with the movie.  Veteran character actor Shea Whigham (he's one of those faces you know even if you're not sure from where) gives a nice turn as a sympathetic police detective who's a Columbo fan and might end up arresting Viola Davis's Lila whether he wants to or not.

This could have been so much better but the fact that it was produced by Lifetime--yes, that Lifetime--probably provides the best indicator of whether you might actually enjoy this or not.  I was expecting an exciting thriller but Lila and Eve is basically a more ambitious than usual Lifetime chick-flick starring a massively overqualified lead actress who can't help but outshine the material.",1439769600,2,1276,4.911627906976745

7202437,2,B00XWV8W6I,"It's late, it's the final big premiere of Sundance...let's have some fun, shall we? Well, that should have been the plan for Charles Stone III's gritty and utterly ridiculous revenge thriller, Lila & Eve, which stars Viola Davis and Jennifer Lopez (who previously co-starred in Out of Sight together) as a pair of grieving mothers whose children have been killed. Or are they? There's a pretty big twist coming that would have worked in a movie that didn't take itself so darn seriously, but as it stands there's a reason why this film was unceremoniously dumped in such an unattractive slot.

Davis plays Lila, a working class single mom in Atlanta whose life is ripped apart when eldest son Stephon is gunned down in a drive-by.  Unable to keep it together well enough to care for her one remaining son, Justin, she enlists in a support group for mothers of murdered children. While most of the other mothers spout lame platitudes, Lila finds a willing partner in rage when she meets Eve (Lopez), a sassy interior decorator also looking for justice of the vengeful variety.  Maybe if the cops (Shea Whigham and Andre Royo) took an interest in the case Lila wouldn't have reason to do what happens next, but then that would require the film actually be about a mother's coping with grief, and who wants to watch that when it's more fun to watch gangsters get gunned down?

The problem is that Stone is trying to have it both ways....well, he's trying to have it multiple ways. Part Dirty Harry, part Thelma & Louise (the similar title can't be a coincidence), and part psychological mystery, the film gets ridiculous as the women begin hunting down the alleged killers. Finding any number of random thugs proves incredibly simple for a couple of inexperienced junior sleuths (the cops are always a step behind, of course), and when the first encounter ends with Eve shooting the guy it's only the first in a growing pile of bodies.  Screenwriter Patrick Gilfillan slathers on one sleazy episode after another, which is no small feat given how much time is spent giving away the unnecessary plot swerve. For awhile this seems like it could be enjoyable as a campy guilty pleasure, but alas the whole thing is too strict and serious. Perhaps because that's what we've come to expect from Davis who does her typically strong work as the grieving, desperate Lila, who is nearly swallowed up by her need for vengeance. She gives every role her determined best even when the material doesn't call for it. Lopez has the better role as the brazen, bloodthirsty Eve. She's the only one who seems to notice just how off-the-rails this whole thing is and plays the role with the necessary amount of scene-chewing.

Prior to the screening, Stone excitedly stepped on stage and talked about all of the big emotions in the film. He wasn't lying. Everything is dialed up to 10 and it tramples what could have been a welcome message about grieving women sticking together in tough times. Case in point: a scene in which Lila is confronted by the police and nearly arrested, only to have the women in her support group step in to vouch for her. Nice moment...until they begin lying to protect her, then justifying those lies to themselves. How does this make them better than the criminals they hate? The crowd cheered anyway. Then again, it WAS late. Maybe they were just happy to finally be going home.",1439078400,,3388,4.733898305084746

7202439,4,B00XWV8W6I,This is a really good movie. From the trailer I thought it might be kind of made for TVesque but it wasn't. The production value was good. The story was good. Just try to go in with no expectations and you will be pleasantly surprised. Some people complain about Jennifer Lopez's performance but I thought it was fine. I love Viola Davis. She was stellar as always. I do t want to say too much because I don't want to ruin anything. If I put it I your head you will look for it and that will ruin the movie. I enjoyed watching it and will definetly watch again.,1438992000,3,561,4.155963302752293

7202441,4,B00XWV8W6I,"Like most moviegoers I expect revenge movies to feature rage--raw, rough, and inevitably (just to sordid the movie up)  raunchy.

Death Wish 2 cast a mold which most subsequent righteous vigilante movies chose to employ.  From Payback to the I Spit franchise, the one wronged will finally exact brutal retribution upon those evil guys but also will walk off, at best, still damaged and stunned and not, absolutely not,  at peace.

Lila and Eve of necessity fits such a moldbut the material being cast differs remarkably in its final effect.

We follow two women who have been deeply pained and then apparently ignored. Specifically they suffer a mothers greatest loss, her childthen when seeking justice, each faces indifference and is brushed aside.

Both actors who portray the resultant frustration and grief and anger turn in brilliant performances. Viola Davis achieves a sense of truth and depth that is wonderful. Casting aside any touch of glamour, Jennifer Lopez captures in its totality a woman injured passed measure who looks it and acts it masterfully.

Predictable violence is meted out but instead of revenge sated but paralysis rigid or seething still there, we see Davis and Lopez show signs of relief and recovery.

In Lila and Eve, we see two remarkable performances with a slew of impressive supporting actors doing fine work in well directed ninety-five well-spent minutes.",1438905600,,1394,5.132743362831858

7202462,5,B00XWV8W6I,"If you have kids, it can be difficult to watch this movie. Somewhat of a tearjerker. Well worth the pain though. The only downside was the incessant ""message"" that the white police and City Hall do not care about black lives. How boringly untrue. It downplays the fact that the reason the police cannot track down the culprit is 1) witnesses refuse to speak to the police and 2) Lila and Eve have to BREAK THE LAW in ways the public refuses to allow the police to do in order to get leads ---So, why blame the police???  Racism??  Yeah.  Viola seems to be channeling Bruce Willis and Charles Bronson at times. You will understand when you watch the movie. No spoilers here. Maybe a little Brad Pitt. The good news too is that this was not another music vehicle for the always lovely Jennifer Lopez, like the recent animation HOME was for Rhianna and J-Lo.  The movie is dark and gritty, but that fits right into the storyline. If you lost it, would you even know?  Some may, some may not. Would you develop a death wish if your child was murdered? Could you track down the killers with your own knowledge and skills, or would you need a sixth sense? The mother's club in this movie provides a touching reminder of how we all need someone to lean on during extreme times of emotional agony. Someone in the club to welcome us, advise us, comfort us, and fight with us....least we have to fight alone. How many dots have you connected today?",1438732800,3,1438,4.431818181818182

7202465,5,B00XWV8W6I,"I Loved this movie. I confess I had the plot already figured out about a third way into the movie. I could tell because because  Lopez had that overtly protective but ""I don't give a dam attitude with Davis.""  I imagined Lila wasn't normally the kind of person that would do most of the stuff Lopez got her into. Never the less this is an excellent movie! Lopez and Davis are extraordinary together. When something very traumatic and life changing happens to someone, the mind shatters. Like fragments of broken glass. Sometimes one of these shards of glass take on a personality of their own and become an dominant force in the traumatized individuals mind, thus taking on a personality all of its own. It is a defense mechanism. It is the minds way of coping and not going insane. Some call it split personality disorder. Excellent  movie... If I were to go insane and my mind shattered, I would defiantly would want Jen Lopez for my severed personality disorder partner!  Lol!  She is a truly an actress to contend with. Davis is also a favorite of mine. I absolutely loved this movie. I would give it 8 stars if i could.",1438387200,,1124,4.544554455445544

This is a movie that started out with so much promise but began to become repetitive and lose its edge the longer it went on. The movie is still very good and worth seeing but the movie Death Sentence with Kevin Bacon was very similar, and I though much better. The biggest fault I have with this movie is that it was geared toward the Lifetime movie crowd but added enough to make it an R rating. The movie never really makes it out of the Lifetime feel and to me that hurt it. Overall, not a bad movie and worth seeing, but essentially a hard edge Lifetime movie that doesn't really appeal to everyone like it should. I give this a B.",1437609600,3,1136,4.168181818181818
