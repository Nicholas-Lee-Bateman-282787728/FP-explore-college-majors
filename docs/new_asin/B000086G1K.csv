7979907,5,B000086G1K,"This is an excellent lesson. It's full of information and I'm glad I bought this. There is in depth information on what he plays for the solos for each song, and this is exactly what I was looking for. I can learn at my own pace, and review any part I want at any time. I'm a beginner so getting the speed is not possible, I had to record it in audacity and slow down the speed to be able to play along with it correctly. As I get better I can try to play at speed.",1397260800,2,465,3.804123711340206
7979908,5,B000086G1K,Stacy is great and extremely knowledgible and passes on load of useful information. There is loads of information for the beginner and intermediate bluegrass fiddler. I highly reccommend.,1363132800,,187,5.714285714285714
7979909,5,B000086G1K,"I am a former bass player who turned fiddler about 2.5 years ago and I wanted to improve my understanding of Bluegrass.  I had also been a trumpet player with gigging chops for jazz improv on trumpet and bass.  I can't recommend this DVD highly enough.  It gives specific guidance on what makes bluegrass fiddle sound like bluegrass.  What he gives you will help you create your own solos on top of what other people have done.  Memorizing other fiddle solos is an important part of becoming a good improviser, but so is understanding why bluegrass sounds like bluegrass and not old time or blues or jazz or whatever.  With what Stacy Phillips presents, you can be sure that other bluegrass players will recognize your solos as bluegrass and not a complete faker.  You can also peice together you're own ideas more thoughtfully.

If you are interested how melodies are put together I recommend checking out Willie Thomas's ""Jazz Anyone?"" Book 3 (Book 1 for more fundamental jazz rythm concepts).  This will help you understand what notes to use in a melody for a good solo, plus it will help you synthesize what Stacy Phillips says about flat 7ths, 4ths and 5ths - applying numbers to the notes on the major scale.  You might also try Googling the Nashville number system for that too.",1363046400,4,1285,4.696428571428571
7979910,4,B000086G1K,"In an earlier review I gave this DVD two stars and complained (kinda bitterly) about Mr. Phillips not teaching the solos note for note.

I am upgrading to 4 stars and revising the review because I don't think I really gave it justice. While it's true that he doesn't teach the solos note for note, there is so much really important information here about what makes bluegrass fiddling sound like bluegrass, rather than, say, oldtime, folk or country fiddling, that I think it deserves a higher rating. However, be aware, this is a DVD for someone who most emphatically already knows how to play fiddle (AKA violin) and knows it well.  You will not get any hand holding, other than a bit of discussion of using a numeric system to identify notes and chords, though I'd be surprised if anyone could progress their playing to the level required by this DVD and not know numeric notation for notes and chords.

Bottom line: to use this DVD you must be proficient on your instrument and be able to either:
 - read music
 - Learn by ear from fast playing
 - use software to strip audio out of a DVD and then slow it down (that's what I did)

If you can meet those requirements, you will find this to be an incredibly rich resource for bluegrass fiddle style. It addresses everything from specific interval choices for doublestops, when and where to use slides, when to use slurs, how to use anticipation and syncopation, and on and on. If you study this DVD, you will sound like a real bluegrass fiddler. For all you country fiddlers, folks fiddlers, irish fiddlers, oldtime fiddlers and violinists who always wanted to get the magic of that driving bluegrass sound, this DVD is for you. Just be aware, it is not intended for those who are still learning their instrument.

As a final note, to make up for my deficits as fast by-ear learner, I used 'Switch Sound File Converter Plus' from NCH Software to strip the audio tracks out of the DVD, and 'The Amazing Slow Downer' from Roni Music to slow them down enough to learn the notes. And no, I am not affiliated with either of those companies, I'm just a customer who likes their stuff.",1337731200,9,2131,4.545691906005222
