2666558,5,B000J3EG94,An excellent and entertain package of informational and educational dvd episodes for children from 2-10 years old. Highly recommended for any young family dvd collection!,1341014400,,170,5.84
2666559,5,B000J3EG94,"I am SO thrilled to be able to purchase episodes of our favorite PBS shows on DVD, now that PBS has caved to corporate interests and started inserting so many product labels and endorsements into their supposedly commercial-free breaks!

My children love, love these DVDs, and I am already watching for the release of additional PBS shows on DVD--we can't own enough of these, in my opinion! :)",1290729600,2,394,4.794117647058823
2666560,5,B000J3EG94,"These are great titles. A little bit of everything. If you are hoping to get the complete series of any of these shows, this is not the pack to get. If you want a good selection of different styles of shows for your kids, then this is a great option.",1239494400,,250,4.02
2666561,5,B000J3EG94,"I bought these videos awhile back and my daughter loved them. She watchs them regularly but sadly she cracked the zoboombafoo DVD. I will half to replace it. But Overall , we both love the videos. And I would recommend buying this set to others who enjoy PBS kids shows. Lots of fun for kids to watch and the they come in a series of show. Great buy!!!",1210723200,,352,4.1911764705882355
2666562,5,B000J3EG94,"I first bought this DVD for the Zoboomafoo episodes.  We have a VHS of Zoboo  that my kids, six and four, have really enjoyed.  This PBS Kids Pack seemed to be more economical than buying the DVD of just Zoboomafoo, so I bought it instead hoping that they would also enjoy Sagwa and George Shrinks.  And they did.  They have actually watched George Shrinks the most.  The best thing is that I feel good about my kids watching these videos because of the character lessons in Sagwa and George Shrinks and the educational value in Zoboomafoo.  It is a really good combination pack.",1187049600,13,579,4.563106796116505
8148836,5,B000J3EG94,Yes great DVD,1475280000,,13,3.6666666666666665
8148837,5,B000J3EG94,"It's funny, because I purchased this DVD combo mainly for George Shrinks because my 3-year-old twins really like that show, and I thought this was a better value than purchasing individual DVDs. However, I noticed that they watch Zoboomafoo and Sagwa much more often than George Shrinks. This combo comes with those 3 shows, in which each of them have their own DVD, and they are all pretty long, so this set is a wonderful value for the money and my children liked all 3. (They had never seen Zoboomafoo and Sagwa before, but they ended up really liking it.) Zoboomafoo is fun and very educational; Sagwa and George Shrinks are entertaining for toddlers.",1459382400,,655,4.754385964912281

8148841,2,B000J3EG94,I already have the same Zoboomafoo shows as this one did not list the ones on the cd. We were very disappointed.,1399248000,,112,4.136363636363637
8148842,5,B000J3EG94,altho my son will only watch Zaboomafoo it was very much still worth my money as I was not able to find any other DVDs that had the same quality of that show!,1373241600,,158,3.8181818181818183
8148843,4,B000J3EG94,I bought this for my son because he loves Zoboomafoo and we couldn't find it anymore on PBS at night.  He also likes the George Shrinks which my wife and I don't remember ever seeing it.,1367884800,,186,4.166666666666667

8148845,5,B000J3EG94,"My grand kids sat down and watched the whole set. I was impressed with ""the whole family can enjoy"" content of each video and I feel relaxed that I do not have to worry about any inappropriate content and the children still enjoyed it immensely. A win-win!",1362700800,,256,4.468085106382978
