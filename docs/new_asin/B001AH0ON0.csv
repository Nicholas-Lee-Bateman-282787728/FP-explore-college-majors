8277407,5,B001AH0ON0,"The Old Barn is a fun early talkie from the Mack Sennett studios. The movie takes place at a little country inn called the Cedar Creek Hotel. First we meet Johnny Burke, the farm hand, who's in love with Thelma Hill, the maid. There's also a sheriff (Andy Clyde), a gypsy fortune teller, a schoolteacher, and the hotel's owner. While listening to the radio they hear that a dangerous criminal named Stranger Dan has escaped from prison. Things get scary when a mysterious man shows up at the hotel and they start hearing strange noises in the barn. Along the way there are some good jokes and lots of laughs.

Thelma Hill gives a wonderful performance in this movie. She was one of Mack Sennett's most popular bathing beauties but she never had a big film career. Sadly Thelma died in 1938 at the young age of 31.",1437091200,,813,4.493243243243243

The seller is to be commended - the copy sent to me was the wrong one.  The seller
almost immediately sent me the right one.  Good stuff!!",1370390400,,202,4.0
