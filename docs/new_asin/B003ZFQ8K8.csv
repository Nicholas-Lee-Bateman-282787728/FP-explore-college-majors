4233594,4,B003ZFQ8K8,"Purchased with the intent of turning the large black hole (TV) into something of interest during party gatherings. There is bubbling and pump noise if you choose to listen to it. The colors are bright and images are clear and it does provide a point of interest that a blank TV does not. For this, It does everything I wanted it for.",1362355200,,333,4.387096774193548
4233595,5,B003ZFQ8K8,received very quick i have 55inch high def the best ive ever seen gorgous like having a 500gallon tank built into the wall thumbs up,1357344000,,132,4.32
4233596,2,B003ZFQ8K8,"I bought it to play on my traditional tv because it said FULLSCREEN. Its NOT fullscreen on my trad tv, maybe on a plasma but this wasn't stated on the description OR the dvd itself. Black bars are annoying, would have bought a different one had i not been misled.  Price is too high for what little you get also.",1335744000,2,312,4.2
4233597,5,B003ZFQ8K8,"A neat idea -- stationary view of fish in an aquarium.  Similar to the Holiday Yule Log that shows a roaring fireplace on your TV, this one shows a view inside an aquarium.  Looks really cool on a big-screen TV.  We keep it on all day in our office.  Saves lots of money when we don't have to feed the fish or scrub out the aquarium!",1331251200,4,333,4.0
4233598,5,B003ZFQ8K8,We are very happy with this DVD.  All our friends have enjoyed it when they come over.  You could sit and watch this all day long.,1306195200,3,130,3.9615384615384617
4233599,5,B003ZFQ8K8,"Way Cool.  I love my Aquarium II DVD.  The color and clarity of the images are truly amazing.  You can tell this was a professional production.  These fish really add character to the room.  I now have fluid artwork where before I had a 50"" black rectangle.",1297036800,6,257,4.382978723404255
4233600,5,B003ZFQ8K8,"I purchased this DVD to play when entertaining in my home and it is always a hit. More often than not, guests end up crowding around the TV to watch the shots of the aquarium. The quality is great and the audio adds to the relaxing nature of the video.",1297036800,5,252,4.06
8410249,1,B003ZFQ8K8,"I bought this dvd because I wanted a relaxing aquarium to watch, I got just the opposite.  The sound of the water pump in the background is very annoying.  The fish were pretty but they were moving so fast as if someone was scaring them.  I did not enjoy this dvd at all.  I could not get past the first fifteen minutes.  The same day that I got it I returned it.",1497657600,,363,3.986111111111111

8410255,5,B003ZFQ8K8,"Perfect for our 55 inch TV! Nice to have on in the background at dinner parties. It is well done, there is no view of the top of the tank on the video so it looks like a fish tank. I would not put it on a larger TV because the image will also enlarge. We tried it on our 80 inch TV and the fish were bigger then my head, it was funny. Great clarity and multiple tank options!",1386201600,,375,3.7
8410256,5,B003ZFQ8K8,THE COLORS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL-I DID NOT KNOW THERE WERE SO MANY KIND OF FISH-THEY HAVE NOT A WORRY IN THE WORLD-THEY JUST SWIM AND SWIM--,1383609600,,135,4.230769230769231
8410257,5,B003ZFQ8K8,I am pleased with this item and would recommend it to others.  I have received many good comments from people who have viewed the item in use.,1372550400,,142,4.2592592592592595
8410258,4,B003ZFQ8K8,Ordered and received promptly and in good condition. Very good color and clarity. I like the variety of tank options and fish. Very relaxing except for one tank where the fish move too fast for me. I would like to see the segments longer before looping and the frame not freezing for two seconds when looping.  This is noticeable when just staring at the screen. (Which I do.) My one complaint is that it is not a full tank shot. The fish disappear off the sides and top which makes it hard to get the true aquarium experience.  I tried different formats and settings but it didn't help.  I will keep and enjoy but may look for something with a full tank shot.,1371945600,,660,4.349593495934959
