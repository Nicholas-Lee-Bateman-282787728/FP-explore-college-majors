4641327,1,B0009ZF85I,"The  video tape  arrived promptly. I was disappointed that the sound quality was very poor,a very loud buzz continued throughout the film after the first 10 minutes or so. I realize tape quality degrades overtime.",1299456000,,213,5.057142857142857
4641328,4,B0009ZF85I,"just a bit shady gambler who takes dangerous chances. He is deeply in love with his wife, Brenda, played by Joan Bennett. They are prosperous & happy. Not so happy is his trusted attorney, Slant (Lloyd Nolan). He is jealous & also in love with Brenda. Brenda fears for Steve's life as he is careless in the chances he takes. She & Slant conspire to take Steve out of circulation just for a short while. His is arrested on a simple tax evasion charge, usually 10-12 months easy time. Slant betrays them, bungles the whole case purposely, & Steve gets 10 years hard time at Alcatraz. Brenda vows to wait, fending off Slant's blandishments, she takes an apartment on a hill with a fantastic view of the bay & Alcatraz. Slant continues to pursue Brenda & threatens to tell Steve of her part in his imprisonment. About this time along comes Tim Noland, (Walter Pidgeon) pilot &  all around good guy. Of course he also falls in love with Brenda & she is attracted to him. She doesn't tell him about Steve. But Slant tells Steve about Tim. Now, we all know that escape from Alcatraz is not really possible. But you can probably figure out the rest. It's a good, somewhat predictable ending. There are only limited possibililties. The big star is that City By the Bay.",1274054400,3,1260,4.526315789473684
4641329,4,B0009ZF85I,Good movie fun to watch  if you like old movies this is a one worth watching. This was one  50s movies that I completely watched due only because it was realistic from start to finish. I do not like movies that are cheesy and unrealistic.,1439424000,,238,4.266666666666667
4641330,4,B0009ZF85I,"Good copy, good plot, good acting. Ex-bootlegger tries to go straight but gets caught in tax trouble. If you like George Raft this movie is a good measure of his acting ability. We have come to appreciate his performances, the more we watch his movies. Won't spoil the ending.",1435968000,2,276,4.653061224489796
4641331,4,B0009ZF85I,"I really enjoyed this lesser-known  film and would highly recommend it for fans of film noire. This is my first encounter with Joan Bennett, and she was certainly terrific in the role of  a manipulative nightclub singer. I remembered George Raft from Some Like it Hot and was glad to see him in a similar role.",1429660800,,310,4.517857142857143
4641332,3,B0009ZF85I,George Raft and a very young Joan Bennett. Very good movie,1428364800,,58,4.363636363636363
4641333,4,B0009ZF85I,Good movie,1427932800,,10,4.5
4641334,5,B0009ZF85I,"Give this vintage 1940 film a chance, because the moment Joan Bennett (a treat in the unique series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows/dp/B0070B9R5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows</a>) enters, it's impossible to stop watching. Why Bennett is not an even more widely renown actress is beyond me, as her charisma and capacity for nuance are remarkable. Here, she plays a sassy nightclub singer who marries a shady businessman (George Raft). His lawyer also desires Joan, and sets his partner up for imprisonment at Alcatraz. Perennial good-guy Walter Pidgeon (as aviator Lloyd Nolan) also falls the the luscious Joan, how could help himself? Sadly, the film brought about the demise of Raft's career. Overall, a fun film for a rainy afternoon. Enjoy!",1427673600,2,810,6.052173913043478

4641336,4,B0009ZF85I,Classic film noir with Joan Bennett at her best.  George Raft plays....well...George Raft.  But Bennett gives a more nuanced performance and makes this film worth seeing.,1424131200,,170,5.5

8463536,4,B0009ZF85I,"Great story line but you have to love old movies as sometimes the acting is a little over dramatic. Big fan of George Raft in Some Like It Hot with Lemmon, Curtis and Monroe and They Drive By Night with Bogie. He  did not disappoint here either. Would definitely recommend - again - if you like old movies and their technical limitations as compared to today's over the top productions.",1468972800,,386,4.514285714285714

8463542,4,B0009ZF85I,What a find. These films just didn't get mixed in with some of the other known noirs through the decades. AP should unearth more like this.,1465516800,,139,4.384615384615385
