7874688,1,6304587392,"I would love to see this film on the large screen in my home theater, and the description on Amazon.com indicates that this is a region 1 DVD, but it will not play on my DVD/Blu-ray player.  It appears that it will play on my computer, which suggests to me that the disc's security is set to a region other than region 1, so this may be a case of false advertising.  It's not nearly the same experience watching it on a computer rather than in my home theater.",1372464000,2,460,4.157303370786517
7874689,4,6304587392,"Two Daugters (English Subtitles) was ordered and received. This Black & White, old time classic movie, reminding of Indian Bangali culture was good realistic enjoyment.",1323475200,,168,5.76
7874690,5,6304587392,"Note: This review only covers the first movie (""Postmaster"") in this collection. Satyajit Ray's story about a man from the city who comes to work in a rural Indian village as their postmaster and in the process transforms the life of a young girl by teaching her how to read is heartwarming but without the melodrama Bollywood movies usually fall into. The eccentric village characters and the simplicity of the servant girl helps create an environment which is home-like and alienating at the same time and viewers will be able to sympathize with the Post-Master's initial bewilderment. I cannot stress enough how the movie honestly feels like a look into the days in a life in an Indian village, his characters do not speak with any dramatic feel and the whole movie plays out like simple day to day occurrences. The ending, though sad, is quite realistic and a tribute to Ray's ability to keep his characters human, displaying that everyday people often do not perform the heroic deed in lieu of the easier one. This movie is highly recommended to anyone who wants to watch a realistic drama without any of the regular Bollywood spectacle.",1302048000,,1142,4.831632653061225
7874691,4,6304587392,"These are both well-done stories, guaranteed to choke you up at least once per picture.  India/Bangladesh is about as picturesque an area as anyone could hope to film, but with Ray at the helm, cinema is born.  So while I don't want to get into critique of the films, I would like to comment on the production of this DVD.  It is a Mr Bongo films, PAL for EU/UK edition, which means you should have a region-free player if you're going to order it in N America.  Second, the aspect ratio could have  been better.  On mine, there were black bars, not just on the top and bottom of the picture, but on the right and left side as well (1.5"" top/bottom side, 2.3"" right/left side).  When I enlarged the picture, it filled the whole screen but just enough so that most of the subtitles were then cut off at the bottom.  I still enjoyed the films, but don't see why this couldn't have been rectified.  Maybe it's my TV (anyone else experience the same?).  On the plus side, at least the DVD case isn't one of these ""environmentally friendly"" jobs with half the plastic cut out.

*Note: I watched it on another TV (widescreen) and it didn't seem to have this problem.",1279238400,3,1160,4.39906103286385
7874692,5,6304587392,"Made right after the completion of The Apu Trilogy had brought him worldwide renown, these two outstanding movies by Satyajit Ray are inspired by his mentor, the Nobel Prize-winning author Rabindranath Tagore and are set in Bengali villages.

The sharp, often very funny Two Daughters was made to mark the centenary of Tagore's birth and tells two stories of relationships between educated men and simple village girls. It reveals Ray's shrewd eye for the often pompous, self-deceiving conduct of Indian intellectuals and his unpatronising compassion for the dignity of village life.",1257984000,4,583,5.406593406593407
7874693,5,6304587392,"This is actually two separate films, each about a young female - one a young girl, the other a young woman who acts as if she were still a girl. (Actually, a third installment was planned, but it never materialized.) The first part, only about 30 minutes long, is simplicity itself: a man from Calcutta is assigned a position as postmaster in a small rural village. There his assistant is a young girl; they come to rely on each other. But after an attack of malaria, he decides to go to another post, and the girl is heartbroken.

The second part is about a stubborn young man who decides to marry a woman who is still only a child mentally (she likes to still play with the other children). After a disastrous wedding night, he decides to go back to the city. Months go by over which the woman decides to accept her marriage, and the man returns. Satyajit Ray wrote and directed these simple yet consumately artful films; they tell universal truths with great beauty and sincerity: every moment seems exactly right.",1141948800,,1017,4.557377049180328
7874694,5,6304587392,"When Satyajit Ray's films came to Seattle as part  of a weekly festival back in 1995, I had never heard of him before.  I was just thirteen and a real film buff.  I think ""Two Daughters"" was the first film I saw by the master filmmaker. This particular film is like poetry.  I say this because it was filmed, directed and acted in such a thoughtful and sensitive way.  There is so much detail packed into every frame.  I could almost smell the streets and touch the people as I watched them emerge onto the screen.

""Two Daughters"" is actually two films that examine the lives of two very diverse, beautiful and complex young women.

The first part, ""The Postman,"" examines the relationship between a postman who arrives in a community (Nandalal played by Anil Chaterjee) and a young girl who falls in love with him and ends up nursing him back to health during an outbreak of malaria (Ratan played by Chandana Banerjee).  This is touching and definitely a universal relationship many can relate to, as well being poignant and heartbreaking during the final moments of the story.

The second part, ""The Conclusion,"" is about a young man returning home from college (Amulya played by Soumitra Chatterjee) whose domineering mother wants him to settled down with a good Indian girl.  His mother's choice in a suitable bride for her son is not what he has in mind.  In fact, he would rather marry the town tomboy and troublemaker (Mrinmoyee played by Aparna Das Gupta).  Their scenes together are amusing and also touching.

These are important films to see for anyone who is first becoming acquainted with the brilliant talent and work of Satyajit Ray.  Also, anyone who wants to take a look at a delicate and exquisite style of filmmaking different from the loud, bombastic movie style of ""typical"" American storylines.",1096588800,11,1817,4.778846153846154
7874695,5,6304587392,"Ray's version of The Postman is one of my all-time favorite films. As a former Peace Corps Volunteer in India, I can say that this film catches the flavor of that experience completely. The postmaster from Calcutta could be from America -- or from Mars for that matter - the village life is so strange to him. As a sort of accidental by-product of being there, he absolutely changes the life of his young servant girl by teaching her how to read. She, as a sort of accidental by-product of serving him, saves his life. The ending is heartbreaking, but it's not at all clear whether the Postmaster himself - headed for home - feels the emotion.",975024000,8,643,4.504273504273504
