8223366,1,B000WGZGXI,"One would hope that Morbisch production DVDs would all be published to the same standard, but this one is clearly not as good as some of the others (Grafin Mariza for example).  The production can only be likened to the sound of the vogel -- cheap, cheap, cheap.  First -- no subtitles -- for an operetta that has large amounts of dialogue this is not forgivable-- unless you understand German much of the program is uninteligible.  2nd - this DVD unlike other DVDs from Morbisch does not have a 16:9 option -- only 4:3.  3rd -- close ups of characters slapping mosquitos suggest a bored tape editor.  Save your money, unless you have a fixation on Der Vogelhandler or Carl Zeller your experience with operetta will be better served with other DVDs.",1202515200,13,749,4.643939393939394
8223367,4,B000WGZGXI,"It's a shame this delightful operetta isn't staged often on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. If you love the operettas of Johann Strauss, you'll love Zeller's The Bird Seller.

As others have noted, this DVD comes with neither printed synopsis nor subtitle... So here is the gist of the story:
Adam, the Tyrolean bird-seller wants to marry Christel (the village postmistress), but is too poor. So Christel tries to talk the Prince into giving him a job as the keeper of the Royal Menagerie. The problem is the 'Prince' is an imposter, Baron Weps' gambling-addicted spendthrift nephew 'Stanislaus' (Weps had taken a bribe from the villagers to cook up a wild boar hunt for the Prince, but don't want to give the bribe money back when the Prince backed out, so he has his nephew impersonate the Prince instead).

Adam sees Christel presenting 'the Prince' with the roses he had given her earlier and thinks she's being unfaithful. The kind Marie (actually a real Princess in disguise) tries to placate him by giving him her bouquet of roses, which actually complicates things more since it is Tyrolean custom that your heart goes with your roses. After being examined by 2 professors, Adam is offered the job. He 'gets even' by suggesting that Christel marries Stanislaus instead (Countess Adelaide isn't thrilled since she wants to marry Stanislaus herself). It takes Marie/Princess assuring Christel that she isn't seeing Adam to smooth things out so that Adam does wed Christel to end the operetta.

So, aside from the manufacturing defect of not providing us with English synopsis or subtitle. This is actually a very fine performance of this operetta. They play at the lakeside open-air stage, so everybody (except perhaps the mixed chorus) is on body-mike. Reinthaller is a handsome Adam with ardent tone (though at times over-powering his partner in duets). Martina Serafin is a noble and graceful Marie with seriously beautiful voice. Ute Gfrerer is a spunky Christel with apt comedic touch. Staging is engaging...

Now that you can follow the story, there is no real excuse for not trying this operetta! Look for clips on youtube and hear what you're missing!",1202169600,10,2166,4.975138121546961
8223368,5,B000WGZGXI,"The presentation of this operetta is absolutely stunning.  Done at twilight at an open-air theatre on the banks of a sea with a full moon, it shows off splendid performances not only from the cast but the set design, orchestra, and camera crew.

This is a delightful show with equally delightful music, performed in German, and marred only by the lack of subtitles.  The DVD does seem to offer subtitles, but they don't work.",1199145600,6,425,4.716216216216216
8223369,2,B000WGZGXI,"I have to agree with the previous reviews but gave it 2 stars because the performance was actually quite good.  Amazon should be more careful about getting the product information correct.  If anyone ""googles"" the title, there is a libretto (auf deutsch) available on line for those of us who read German but forget the web transliteration.  Anyway, enjoy it if you have it and if you don't, do some research ahead of time to see if you can locate a libretto copy with an English translation.",1195430400,6,492,4.632183908045977
8223370,1,B000WGZGXI,"No subtitles or booklet (synopsis available from menu): process initiated to correct Amazon product info.

(rating based solely on lack of subtitles, not the performance: Amazon requires a rating simply to comment)",1194739200,6,214,5.6875
8223371,1,B000WGZGXI,This is the second time I have been stung by a DVD with no subtitles. These are good performances of German operettas. But the presentation is lazy and cheap: especially for an obscure work.. What we get instead are three short summary paragraphs for a work which depends upon being able to understand the dialogue. Amazon colludes in the ruse by saying there are subtitles. Shame. Let's have a little honesty in the future.,1194048000,14,424,4.743243243243243
