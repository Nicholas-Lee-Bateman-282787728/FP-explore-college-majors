8071698,5,B000A0OY02,"This 1976 movie was co-written, produced, and directed by Russ Meyer. It's the middle of Meyer's masterpieces, preceded by ""SuperVixens"" (1975), and followed by ""Beneath The Valley Of The Ultra-Vixens"" (1979).  The movie starts with Adolph Schwartz (Edward Schaaf), an old German guy who looks like Adolph Hitler, being killed, when a hungry piranha is dropped into his bathtub.  Early in the action, the legendary Candy Samples briefly appears as the Headsperson.  Later, the breathtakingly beautiful Margo Winchester (Raven De La Croix) hitch-hikes into town, gets a job at the local diner, and becomes romantically involved with the sheriff.  Since Charles Napier had moved on to mainstream movies, Sheriff Homer Johnson is played by Monte Bane.  To help keep track of the plot, we have the Greek Chorus, in the form of a naked Kitten Natividad. However, it's not Kitten's voice doing the narration.  Near the end of the movie, Margo discovers who the murderer is.  However, that's not that important, since this movie is more of a who-did-who than a whodunit!",1405468800,,1063,5.145348837209302
