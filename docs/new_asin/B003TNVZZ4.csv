4190875,5,B003TNVZZ4,"A fantastic dvd, a bench mark for children's television and the Geronimo Stilton books are a must the young readers.",1315785600,,116,4.85
4190876,5,B003TNVZZ4,"While this show has yet to air in the U.S.  Canada has gotten the rights to dub this import in English and French. Changes between the books and the cartoon include making the characters drawings a bit better looking, changing Ben's age from 9 year old to a 12 year old computer whiz, Thea and the other characters no longer seem to be screaming at Geronimo to get to work, while Trap is a well mannered obstacle for Geronimo he isn't as much of a prankster or trouble maker as he appears in the books. We also have a lot more appearances of Geronimo rival paper the Daily Rat and him acting more like a reporter than an editor in chief.  Pandora is closer to her Papercutz graphic novel counter part than her character in the normal Geronimo books. The way the characters of Team Geronimo Stilton work together (as seen on cover artwork) also reminds me more of the graphic novels than the regular books. As episodes like Paw off Cheddarface shows, the TV show does get some of the plot ideas directly from  the book series. While the episode guide book that comes with the two disk set says Thea prefers adventures over hanging around the newspaper office she does appear more around the office in the show than she does the books. The two disk set contain 13 out of the 26 episodes currently made and makes the shows first season.

Disk 1

1) operation shugfongong
2) its my scoop
3) stop acting around
4) the mummy with no name

4190877,5,B003TNVZZ4,"My 10 year old son really enjoys this book series and we were very happy with this dvd. The voice acting is very good and so is the animation, the shows and books have great educational tidbits sprinkled in but not overwhelming, very well done show, I hope the dvds are more accessible to American audiences soon (it is a bit expensive still, hopefully the price stays reasonable like the books are).

One other note, the characters in the show are a little bit nicer than they are in the book series, which was probably a good idea, the show does a good job taking on secret agent vibes and other cool things like that from a ten year old boy's point of view.",1299024000,,660,4.32258064516129
4190878,5,B003TNVZZ4,"So far, this show has yet to premiere on US tv. However, a Canadian DVD distribution company picked up the show and dubbed the series in English and French for distribution in Canada. And this is the Import DVD offered in this listing.

8405296,5,B003TNVZZ4,"My son loves the books, so I was pleased to find this video. It's really well done, but those who already know the characters and plots should be prepared for a few changes to suit the TV screen. Trap and Benjamin are more important and integral characters in the videos that in the books. Thea is a bit less pushy, and Sally Ratmousen has a sidekick. I wish these collections were more readily available in the United States. The animation is fine, and it's worry-free entertainment for parents. My son has watched the DVD repeatedly since we purchased it.",1472774400,2,557,4.636363636363637
8405297,5,B003TNVZZ4,"My 7-year-old son loves it. I bought Vol1 first for longer trip for our minivan TV. Goal achieved. :) Recently he asked for Vol2 himself. He started to read the chapter books too. As far as I looked in these cartoon episodes, the stories are so well built and captivate the viewer entirely. When we arrive home in the garage, he often asks me not to stop the engine yet. :)",1440979200,,373,4.267605633802817
8405298,5,B003TNVZZ4,Great show!  No clue why it isn't on in the U.S.  My daughter is 10 and loves all of the episodes,1432944000,2,97,3.5714285714285716

8405300,5,B003TNVZZ4,I am an English teacher and my 4th form students love these dvds  It was a great purchase!  They tend to ask for Geronimo's books in our school library after watching these episodes !!,1376006400,4,184,4.382352941176471
8405301,5,B003TNVZZ4,"My 4th grade students love this series. Most have already read it in 3rd, but they are attracted to the color and fonts used in the book series.  I love this dvd so much because it is not shown on tv, so they are hooked when it comes to rainy day recess and are begging to be able to watch this.  Most never even knew a tv show existed for it until they are in 4th grade and find out it is one of our movie picks.  We have compared some of the titles from all 4 dvd sets to the books we have in the room, a few of them match, but not all of them.  What the students find most interesting is we have always called his sister Thea like the word The-uh, but in the dvd it sounds like Tia.  So now they try to correct others.  The theme song is great too.",1367971200,6,751,3.782051282051282
8405302,5,B003TNVZZ4,Fantastic set of books for young readers.  Recommended for parents to be involved - the writing is fun and exciting.  A great way for children to read stories.  Open any of the books and see what I mean...they are written in such a fun way and are always sold out and popular where I live.,1358985600,2,289,4.218181818181818
8405303,5,B003TNVZZ4,Great Show - Kids LOVE this and spent the weekend watching both DVD's off and on.  Wish they would put on TV here in the states!,1326067200,,128,3.923076923076923
