8123650,4,B000FJDBUM,"What I found most useful was the relaxed, no-drama approach to making programmes. It was in the vein of -anyone can do this and you don't need a degree or a full film crew to making a useable product.

Given that most of the world doesnt have someone else's money to play with, let alone  a friendly camera operator/ sound technician/editor etc, t'was very useful being encouraged that you don't need all that. Just get on with it and make your programme, and then pointers on how to do that. Doesnt get bogged down with jargon, very useful product. Got me brave enough to start making my own short film.",1232150400,,604,4.4818181818181815
