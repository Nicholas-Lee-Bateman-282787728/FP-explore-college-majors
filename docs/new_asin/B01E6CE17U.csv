7731425,5,B01E6CE17U,"This is the second stand-alone movie in this series since it was changed from a television series on Hallmark channel to a movie series on Hallmark's Movies & Mysteries channel.

The movie picks up the story of the four individuals who work in the Dead Letter office shortly after the action in the recent Christmas movie.  Oliver O'Toole (Eric Mabius) is the head of the group (which unofficially now call themselves the Postables and has been somewhat lost since his wife unexpectedly deserted him two years before.

In the prior movie, Oliver has written her a letter and members of the group find it when it is sent to the dead letter office in an almost unrecognizable form.  They make the decision to forward it to his wife and that sets of the series of events that then unfold, which include his wife, Holly (Poppy Montgomery) returning home to possible reunite with Oliver.  This is probably not what Shane McInerney (Kristin Booth) had in mind when the letter was sent as she has grown to have true feelings for Oliver herself.  The movie explores this relationship and provides some much needed answers.

The second story in this movie has to do with a couple who are happily married in the present but who had a bad patch in their marriage a few years before.  The husband had filed divorce papers which were never delivered (and ended up in the hands of the Postables.) The wife never knew of it and in the intervening years, their marriage has become strong again. In their attempt to deliver the paperwork, the members of the team have to decide whether or not they will deliver something that might ruin the lives of both the sender and the addressee.

There is also a relationship that is inching forward step by step between the two other members of the Postables.  While they secretly care a lot about each other, they have yet to tell one another about their feelings.  Rita Haywith (Crystal Lowe) and brilliant and quirky Miss Special Delivery is back with an updated and sleek new look.  Norman Dorman (Geoff Gustafson) is rendered almost speechless around her and seems to have almost given up on being able to express how he feels.

This is such a lovely series to follow.  It has been a bit of a chore to find it from time to time (first a Hallmark movie, then a series, then a channel move and back to a series of movies), but it has been worth it all.  I am hoping that there will be many more movies in the future and I plan to watch each and every one.  The ensemble cast works wonderfully together and makes me care about them and their quests.  It is one of those rare gems which touch my heart and makes me wish that that such a group actually existed.",1463702400,26,2684,4.5010309278350515

Martha Williamson, again, hit a homerun with her storytelling ability.  This movie comes after the Christmas movie.  It is about Shane finding a lost letter from Oliver to his wife and contemplating what to do with it.  After a snafu with the letter it ends up going to Oliver's wife.  She comes back from Paris to talk to him about their marriage.  The music plays a beautiful part in this movie as does the incredible acting ability of Eric Mabius, Kristin Booth, Crystal Lowe and Geoff Gustafson.

The entire series (all episodes/movies) is a masterpiece of great writing (Martha Williamson, Touched by an Angel) and acting (Eric Mabius, Kristin Booth, Crystal Lowe, Geoff Gustafson and guest stars), that is touching, thoughtful, funny, romantic, emotional, quirky, inspiring and SO MUCH MORE!!! They really need to release all of the other movies (there have been, at least, 4 more made since ""... Paris...""). Also, Hallmark needs to continue making even more of these amazing movies and continue the story of The Postables. It really is the best thing Hallmark has going.",1474934400,,635,5.297029702970297

I have all of the Signed, Sealed, Delivered movies and have watched them all, I must admit, more than a few times.  Eric Mabius has always been a favorite of mine.  My only disappointment is my usual problem with some of these movies is that they don't give you that ending that totally answers the question, "" Did Oliver and Shane confess their love for each other?""  I do wish the series on Hallmark would continue.  It was by far one of their better ones.  But that said, this movie is great and I would encourage people who love Hallmark movies as much as I do will purchase this and the first movie titled ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered"" and the second movie titled "" Signed, Sealed, Delivered for Christmas""  All three of these movies would be a great addition to your movie library.",1473811200,5,862,4.4113924050632916

7731568,5,B01E6CE17U,"Signed, Sealed, Delivered is a great show for those who want clean, fun movies.  It was a series for the first year and has gone to 4 movies a year on the Hallmark: Mysteries and Movies channel.  It has a lot of comedy, a little drama, and a little romance.  Something for everyone.  SPOILER ALERT:  The lead - Eric Mabius - gets divorced after the end of this movie.  His wife is mentioned early on in the series but appears only in this movie.  It's a tough topic; and this movie handled it well.  Slightly Christian without being pushy.  You almost have to look for religious references in it to find them.  I highly recommend this movie and this series for those who prefer to watch clean shows - especially the Christmas movie!",1470268800,2,732,4.43609022556391

If you are not familiar with this Hallmark Series, then please watch the pilot and the first 10 episodes.  It is a morality play with decent family values at its core.  Is it often predictable and a bit corny, you betcha, but it does not detract from the wonder of good feelings this series can elicit.  I smile at the opening credits and never want this story to end!",1468972800,,544,4.242718446601942
7731581,3,B01E6CE17U,"Sorry to be the one to bring this down, but this current offering in the series is just too disappointing to give it 5 stars.  My biggest complaint is that I'm just tired of Rita's constant longing for Norman and his utter inability to respond to her obvious feelings of affection.  Come on, Norman!  Get it together!  Then there's Shane's silent suffering over Oliver's uncertainty about the future of his marriage, which leaves her in emotional limbo.  How long are the writers going to drag this out?  These people all need to get some closure and move on with their lives.  It's no longer interesting to me, as a viewer.  If this were real life, I'd be impatiently telling them to get some professional help from a therapist!  Finally, my other complaint is about one of the stories:  the husband who almost divorced his wife because he thought she was unfaithful.  Okay, that was unpleasant enough, but what really, really offended me was when she APOLOGIZED to him for not being able to have a baby!  WHAT???!!!!!  This is the 21st Century, people--who doesn't know that it's ridiculous to blame a woman for being unable to conceive, as if she's committed a crime against her husband and requires his forgiveness? I can't tell you how offensive this was to me.  If the writing is going to continue along this line, I'm giving up on the show.",1468972800,2,1347,4.6525423728813555
