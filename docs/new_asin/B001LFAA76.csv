8318000,4,B001LFAA76,"Good selection of Van Damme movies. This is a 3 disc DVD set. The 3 DVDs come in one box only. I bought this DVD collection to get Double Team, where Van Damme teams with Dennis Rodman of the 1990s NBA champions Chicago Bulls. An interesting pair that's for sure. This movie has a lot of humor involved. Desert Heat was better than I expected. Van Damme teams with young Danny Trejo in this movie. Maximum Risk is a good cop movie. All three movies show Jean Claude Van Damme's kick boxing skills and are packed with action. Desert Heat and Maximum Risk are actually in the full screen standard format 1.33:1. On the other hand, Double Team is actually in the widescreen 2.35:1 format. The widescreen 1.85:1 format as listed in the back of the box is incorrect. Languages: Maximum Risk and Double Team can be watched in English, Spanish, and French. Desert Heat, only in English audio. Subtitles options: English, Spanish, and French for all movies.",1477353600,,949,4.654761904761905

8318003,1,B001LFAA76,"since I want movies to be in their original aspect ratio [OAR] if available, which these three movies are.

Unfortunately, I was unable to find out for sure if any/all of the movies in this DVD set were in their OAR, so went ahead and gambled that they would be since a couple of other Van Damme DVD sets are.

DOUBLE TEAM is in its `wide screen' OAR of 2.35:1, though it's listed incorrectly on the back of the case as 1.85:1 `wide screen'.

DESERT HEAT has been reformatted to 1.33:1 and listed correctly on the back of the case as `full screen'.

MAXIMUM RISK is 1.33:1 `full screen' also, though it too is listed incorrectly on the back of the case as 1.85:1 instead of 2.35:1.

Just sampling several scenes of each movie convinced me that overall picture, sound quality is below average compared to other DVDs in general, including the other Van Damme single, multiple movie DVDs I have.

In short, shame on Sony for such a lack of quality control and/or intentionally `short changing' the consumer.",1357084800,3,1004,4.581005586592179
