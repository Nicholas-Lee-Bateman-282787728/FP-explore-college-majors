7919015,3,B00003IXE2,"This OAV is actually the (forgotten) sequel to the Iczer series One and Three and never made it to DVD. It's not very good. The show gets off to a promising start, as an alternate retelling of the original Iczer-One where main character Nagisa is coming home from school and the earth comes under attack; but then we're suddenly thrown into a dance club scene (the dancer shown with numerous up-skirt shots) and a terrible cutesy idol singer concert which went on for several minutes (more up-skirt shots). In this show it is the ""Iczel"" (robots that merge with the girls to become Iczelion warriors) who are protecting earth rather than two girls piloting giant robots like the original series. Several other girls are Iczelion warriors of different colors.. they are all hyper-stylized, and Nagisa is just running away screaming for nearly the entire thing until the last three minutes. By the time she's finally ready to fight, I've grown tired of her and am disappointed.

It looks like this was meant to be a TV series in the same vain as perhaps Sailor Moon, but after these two pilot episodes was abandoned (?). On the plus side it looks really sharp, if a little too cutesy.
If it's any indicator of how ignored this show is, take a look at the age of the reviews. My tape has copyright 1999 on it, apparently it's one of the unsold originals. It came with the original factory shrink wrap- peeling the wrapper off revealed a shiny case and an ADVision postcard fell out- the tape has never been touched before and was being watched for the first time.
The company that released it is out of business and the format is obsolete... if you get your hands on a factory copy like this it's a rare find. It's a nice addition if you like rare and forgotten animation.",1372723200,,1769,4.580441640378549
7919016,5,B00003IXE2,"I LOVE this one, then again, i have a hard time NOT liking anything that involves women in cool suits that change clothes often.  The storyline is intrigueing, the characters are all superb, and the animation itself is excellent.
Storyline:
Earth is caught in the middle of eternal struggle between good and evil, on one side (good) are the Iczel and the Iczelion (Iczelion are the women when they have the Iczel suits on) who fight to save the planet from all evil that intends to harm it.  On the other side, is Chaos and his sister (who's name escapes me at the moment) who struggle to rule the universe by destroying the only thing that stands in their way, the Iczel.
The episodes on this tape deal mainly with the main character (Nagisa Kai) and her struggle with her fear and reluctance to become an Iczelion.
Gripes:
1. Voice dub-over for the main character could have been better
2. Currently Vol. 2 is not available (dubbed) on Amazon.com
3. Kinda cheesy lookin blood.
All in all, this anime is definitely worth owning, I highly reccomend it.  Other anime I like (Battle Angel, Kite, Evangelion, any hentai **grin**, and Akira).",1001203200,,1138,4.68
