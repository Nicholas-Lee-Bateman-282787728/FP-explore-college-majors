8764574,3,B01H3KUHNY,"Hee Haw: Salute! includes six complete episodes of Hee Haw, a country variety show that premiered on TV in 1969. Conceived as a rural alternative to Rowan & Martins Laugh-In, it began as a summer replacement for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. With a cast of characters including Minnie Pearl, Grandpa Jones and Archie Campbell, comedy one-liners, and musical performances, the show, co-hosted by Buck Owens and Roy Clark, became a hit. CBS dropped the show 1971, after two successful years, but it was quickly picked up for syndication and aired for the next 21 years, making Hee Haw the longest-running weekly syndicated original series in television history.

The programs on this release are from the early 1970s. Performers include Tanya Tucker, Dolly Parton, Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn, Conway Twitty, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Kitty Wells, Freddy Fender,  Buck Owens and others.

Songs include I Walk the Line, Delta Dawn, White Lightnin, Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man, Love Is a Butterfly, Dont Let the Good Times Fool You, and All Around Cowboy. Comedy sketches round out each of the shows.

There are no bonus features on the 3-disc DVD release.",1476835200,6,1163,5.137566137566138
