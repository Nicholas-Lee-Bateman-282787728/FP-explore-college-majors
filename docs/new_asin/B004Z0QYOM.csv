8449136,4,B004Z0QYOM,"This is a very entertaining family film. It's about an animal that attacks a young man. Another animal is caught and animal trainers have to prove it's innocence. There is plenty of action. Unfortunately, Don Wilson is only in the film for a few minutes. Watch this film if you want to see a family film about the love for animals.",1469318400,,331,4.442622950819672
8449137,4,B004Z0QYOM,"Hollywood Safari was a typical short movie about safari movies & how they are shot, etc, boring. The ""Secret of the Andes"" was much better & really held my interest, & was somewhat good, even by tody's, or despite, today's standards!!!",1410998400,,235,4.7560975609756095
8449138,1,B004Z0QYOM,"There are no words to describe how bad this film is. I sat thru about 20 minutes and had to give up. There is low budget and then there is NO budget, and Hollywood Safari falls within the latter. You know it's bad when in a 2011 movie the costume designer gets top billing in the opening credits and the thing most memorable in that 20 minutes is how ridiculous it was having a teen walk around wearing a Country Music Tv hat, something that would never happen in real life. Nor would the mountain lion attack. The animal basically superficially scratched his face a couple times (I've cut myself more severely when SHAVING) and tore about a one inch patch of surface skin off his chest? Riiiiiight...

Of course while they are filming the attack all you keep seeing is the mountain lion biting the cuff of his two decades out of style flannel shirt ala Nirvana era alt rock grunge. (Yup that costume designer REALLY deserved top billing....NOT!)The acting is subpar to the hilt and it looks like it was shot on a cheap pay as you go cell phone. Don't waste your time on this schlock fest. 0 stars",1406937600,,1097,4.430693069306931
8449139,3,B004Z0QYOM,"This movie with all of its animals really keeps my grandson occupied when I'm babysitting.  He loves watching it over and over again.  I can get so much accomplished before he gets bored with it.  So, it is worth the money!  As a matter of fact, I'm buying one for his house, his 3 y/o cousins' and my house.  We're saying goodbye to Netflix!  Way to go Amazon!!

8449140,1,B004Z0QYOM,"The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film. The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell? Get real! Utterly, completely stupid.",1316131200,,271,4.333333333333333
