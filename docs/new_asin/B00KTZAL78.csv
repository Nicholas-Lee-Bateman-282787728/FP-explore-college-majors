6446662,4,B00KTZAL78,"I might give it five stars, but I still feel I was tricked into an endless puzzle.  That was my intention.  Someone labeled this one a ""modern fable"" and it does evoke Grimm tales and possible political satire, though I do not know much about that in The Nederland's.  Overall, a lot of fun and clever.

6446663,4,B00KTZAL78,"Weird and unnerving are a couple words which accurately describe the experience that is watching this film. What the film means is anyone's guess, and nothing is really spelled out or explained. This actually is a good thing, though, because the viewer can take away from it what they want. The story is about a vagrant named Borgman who insinuates himself into this affluent family's home and slowly makes life a living hell for them. The overall tone of the film is one of unease, mystery and black humor, peppered with a shock every now and then. There are several scenes which may stick with you long after finishing it, and there are a few that are still with me now. Comparing this to anything else is futile, except that if you like weird, disturbing movies (like I do), then you will probably love this. From a quality standpoint, everything is well-shot and all of the actors, including the children, give good performances as far as I can tell (Dutch isn't a language I speak). The tone of the film is also set very well by the score, which is off-kilter and dissonant. Since it is best to go into this film with as little information as possible, I'll end here. Suffice it to say, if you're brave enough to give this a try, you might end up liking it as I did.",1411257600,3,1271,4.459227467811159

6446667,4,B00KTZAL78,"A macabre and often dryly amusing variation on the suburban-critique film imported from the Netherlands.  The title character, Camiel Borgman, is a bearded and implacable vagabond.  Driven from one area by gun-toting men, a priest among them, he inserts himself into the sphere of a well-to-do family, first receiving secret meals from the hospitable mother and later returning as a clean-shaven gardener.  Along with a few mysterious partners, he slowly disassembles and undermines the family's peace of mind and domestic unity.  Why?  To what end?  Are they demons?  Anarchists?  The motive is never explained in its entirety, but the journey is riveting in its delightful (evil) twists and turns and buoyed by strong lead performances.  The Michael Haneke-esque aesthetic is always detached and the pacing measured, whether the scene involves neither-here-nor-there acts of domesticity or brutal violence, rendering the experience unpredictable and, in a positive way, uncomfortable and nauseating.  There are a handful of frightening and indelible images, including bodies disposed of in the sea with their heads encased in concrete, and a few moments of genuine subversive hilarity.  In one, the scheming Borgman ensures he is hired as the wealthy white family's new gardener by paying various men of Arab and African descent to precede him as interview candidates.  The handsome front door is rapidly closed in their faces.",1410307200,7,1429,5.445454545454545

6446670,4,B00KTZAL78,"Capitalism hasn't exactly collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions, as Marxists of yore predicted. But it's hard to deny that it has grown rather soft, flabby, fat - its arteries a little too clogged for its own good.

One old Marxist, Italian poet-director Pier Paulo Pasolini, took aim at our system's underbelly with savage glee in his 1968 classic Teorema, about a beautiful Christlike figure (played by a gloriously young Terence Stamp) who is welcomed into the house of an affluent family only to destroy it from within, seducing the husband, the wife, and their teenage kids.

More than a half-century later, Dutch auteur Alex van Warmerdam goes after the same target with Borgman, a remarkable, thoroughly disturbing creepshow that burrows deep under your skin and refuses to let go.

Borgman, which pays homage both to Teorema and Michael Haneke's savage home invasion fantasy, Funny Games, opens with an almost mythic, fairy-tale prologue set in a rural village. We watch as a savage-looking vagabond named Camiel Borgman (Jan Bijvoet) is roused from his underground lair by a murderous group of gun-toting men - one of whom is the local priest!

We're given little explanation, except that the community is tired of putting up with the backward squatters whom Borgman has parked on their doorstep.

Borgman escapes by the skin of his teeth, eventually arriving at an affluent suburb, where he goes in search of a new abode. He smacks his lips when he happens upon Marina (Hadewych Minis), a housewife with a weakness for strays who agrees to nurse his wounds. Marina's pity intensifies when her husband, media executive Richard (Jeroen Perceval), gives Borgman a beating and throws him off their property.

Borgman eventually insinuates himself into the family, weaving his strange spell as he comes into contact with the couple's three young children and their nanny, Margot. People are drawn to Borgman's animal magnetism, his uninhibited exhibitionism, his apparent frankness.

Before long, Borgman's retinue of feral followers shows up to wreak havoc on our suburban family.

Filled with surreal touches and shocking scenes of black humor, Borgman steams ahead with the power and inevitability of a nightmare.

Van Warmerdam doesn't spell out an agenda in Borgman, preferring to keep things loose, elliptical, ambiguous. But it's safe to say his film is a cautionary tale of sorts - a reminder of the deep rift, even hatred, that has grown between rich and poor, and a warning about how soft we've become, and how alienated from our animal nature.

What is not ambiguous is its power to inspire dread and wreak aesthetic havoc in the viewer.",1473552000,,2668,5.08466819221968

I'm not even going to try to un-spoiler this film:  What were they doing sleeping underground in the woods?  I'm guessing they were like evil demons (not vampires) that just stayed underground until it was time to go make mayhem?  What was up with the scars on the right shoulder blades and cutting the kids open in the same spot?  Did they put something in or take something out?  Loved the ""head in the bucket full of concrete and dumped in the pond"" routine to get rid of the bodies, tho.  I really expected these adults to body-snatch the kids and take on their appearances.  Instead, they just charmed and snatched the kids.  I really think there is more to this movie that we would understand if we came from that culture.  It's almost like some kind of Danish Voodoo movie.  It got me thinking about the ""Nightwatch"" and ""Daywatch"" movies.  I really liked those 2, but there were things in those movies that maybe only someone with a Russian (or similar) background would understand, I dunno.

6446786,4,B00KTZAL78,"This is an uncanny, magical movie, one of my favorites of 2014. Its spell on me was only improved by how little I knew about it going in. There are some reviews (not so much here as by critics in published media) that give away far too much, so I encourage you to avoid them (and the trailer) and go in cold, if you're the least bit curious about this one.

I'll add as little as I can bear to (but there's so much in this film to talk about!): a bourgeois family invites a stranger into their home, one of those modern-architecture McCastles isolated from its neighbors by a moat of impeccably manicured lawn. Odd, inexplicable events ensue. It sounds like a thousand bad, predictable ghost stories you've already seen, but Borgman confounds our expectations at every turn. In a magical movie feat, the heroes' dumbest, least intuitive decisions only strengthen the strange, unpredictable atmosphere... and get in an ironic dig at the cliche of the bad horror-movie decision to boot.

There is some sly between-the-lines commentary here about how affluence and convenience have isolated us from our own common sense, and how susceptible our good judgement has become to lies told in a confident or strident voice. We in the West marvel that Liberians would mistrust the doctors sent to protect them from ebola, for example; yet we openly speculate whether climate change is man-made or if vaccinations are bad for our kids. But you could easily ignore all this subtext and simply let yourself be thrilled, shocked and bemused at face value by Borgman's steadily building intrigue and suspense.

A big part of Borgman's spookiness is that it's filmed a lot like a documentary. Drily and dispassionately, we observe some sort of ancient gypsy rites lost to time, that viewer and victims no longer remember existed, let alone how to defend against. Their influence is all the more bizarre and potent for our modern amnesia. Like Herzog's actual documentary ""Herdsmen of the Sun,"" it's as if the filmmaker is as baffled as the audience by what we're seeing.

In a Hollywood version of this story there'd be that one ""grounded, down-to-earth"" character who sees through all the B.S. and warns/ saves the targets. (No doubt they'd also explain away the villians' ""real motives"" in a 90-second speech that would drain every last ounce of mystery from the plot.) But in THIS film, no-one is safe. Least of all the viewer: without a canary in the coalmine to identify with, the audience is wisely never allowed to reassure ourselves that ""...if it were me, of course *I* would realize what was happening"" and thereby distance ourselves from the bad guys' strangeness and power.

Borgman is more than just eerie and creepy. It's wryly funny, delightfully weird and full of genuine surprises. Viewers have every right to insist on closure from a suspense film, but for those intrigued by movies that raise more questions than answers, especially when they're done this well, I highly recommend Borgman.",1425427200,2,2992,4.893491124260355

I'm not afraid of anything, so I won't be having nightmares, I am just revolted by the utter lack of humanity in any of the characters.
What an exercise in empty, vacuous banality of evil.
Avoid if you half a soul or a modicum of class.
I do thank a reviewer on IMDB who reminded me that the scene where Brogman is sitting on the sleeping housewife is supposed to represent  a demon that terrorizes people while they sleep by sitting on their chests and suffocating them. The victim is paralyzed, unable cry out, and aware of a frightening presence in the room.

Whatever floats your boat, I guess. For me, this movie is a big steaming pile of stupidity. Characters, especially females, act without explanation, back story, or motivation. They fall in love, screw around, lie, and murder with not the least bit of logic. There's no genuine conversation, no character development, no realism. If the director's vision is to paint humanity as a tug-of-war between the butcher and the butchered, I guess he has a point. If he believes the majority of the population is to be led by the nose thoughtlessly toward slaughter, I say let him have at it; however, I give humanity some (not a lot) more credit.",1422144000,2,818,4.978102189781022

Not your father's fairy tale or ""they lived happily ever after"" fable.

I was an avid reader of fairy tales as a child and learned to be cautious when venturing into the forest or if taking candy from strangers after reading ""Hansel and Gretel"".  This movie is only a continuum.  Do you give succor (including a bath) to a vagrant knocking on your door?  The movie's opening scene of a priest rooting-out the subterranean species with a shotgun perhaps is an ignored clue.

It is a relief to find a movie without the common CG effects, the other usual Hollywood glitz, and the typical gentle tidings at a movie's end. This film is not the easily forgettable fare, and discussing it may preempt the usual bitching session while lazing around the water cooler at work.

We may be impressed by the power of persuasion the evil doers in the movie possessed, but we strangely are not surprised by it.  The critics who begrudge the movie's ""mystery"" should watch the reality crime station ""ID TV"" (before becoming an addict for a week) and appreciate the senselessness of pure bad.",1422057600,,1135,4.611940298507463

The mysteries are not to be solved. They are part and parcel of the nature of evil. If anything this movie is a cautionary tale. I can't imagine the average American viewer raised on and addicted to clear motives, and pat easily explained narratives with a satisfactory resolution in their movies even coming close to getting this.

I don't usually take the time to write reviews,
but could not allow a 2-star rating to stand.

The film is quite surreal but not half as bizarre as many reviews made it out to be.
It is not for everyone, but it's not art house film festival challenging either.
If you like Gilliam, Lynch or von Trier- you should give it a try.

It leaves you with questions at the end, but I found it to have a very cohesive sense of wonder throughout.
I think the subtitles were poorly translated, but maybe that oddly phrased English added to atmosphere 
I also get the feeling that there is mythology that is referenced that I'm unfamiliar with as an American.

Neither too predictable, nor non-sensical,

 the film begins with some town-folk probing the ground with sharp poles. beneath, lives a man in a hollowed-out ""room"". he escapes and as he runs thru the woods, he awakens his cohorts who live in, what i can only describe, as shallow graves with trap doors over their faces. that is the first WTF moment. be prepared for an hour and 53 min. of WTF as these con men murder and manipulate their way into the lives of an affluent family.
  the film is wrought with dark humor and had me laughing in a nervous sort of way. one example; the murder victims' heads are put in a bucket of cement and then tossed off a dock. in time, they resemble a collection of aquatic plants as their numbers increase.....sick, but morbidly funny.
 for me, what should be a horrific act, was transformed into humor due to the fact that the murders were not done in malice, but more with an ""all in a days work"" attitude.

Borgman only utters a few sentences in the entire film and yet he manages to completely unravel the lives of a picture perfect family;  how much was his fault and how much theirs?  Watch and decide for yourself but remember:  real faerie-tales rarely had happy endings.. they were cautionary.

6447035,3,B00KTZAL78,"The trailer for this movie looks enticing, as is the title, yet it lacks cohesivness throughout the duration of the film. There are compelling scenes and suspenseful moments to be applauded, but the overall story will become quite lost to the unobservant, casual movie watcher.  The movie is in Dutch and subtitled in english.  There is the occasional use of english by an opare in the movie, but not enough to understand what is going on if you missed the subtitles (which are only on screen for a mere instant, you better read quick).  At best, the movie is a loose read, open to multiple interpretations as a consequence of the use of cliche mythology and lore.  A fake Bible quote may suck you in at the beginning  - ""And they descended upon the Earth to strengthen their ranks"" (not found anywhere in the Bible).  It is more or less a smattering of enigmatic films from the past, ""A Clock Work Orange"" comes to mind as does ""EraserHead"".  You would be better off seeing the latter as this art-flick is over most peoples heads.  I will however, give Jan Bijvoet a tip of my hat as he does a wonderful job in creating a memorable character (who or what that character is, I do not know).  The best part of the movie is when Alex van Warmerdam (the director, who plays Ludwig in the movie) is on stage in a Tutu.  All in all, if you like movies that are loose on the story, hard on the eyes and leave you creeped out not knowing if you are scared or pissed wishing you could get the last two hours of your life back, then this movie may be for you.  The only redeeming part of the movie experience is that I didn't have to pay for it.  Just wish Amazon Prime would get better movies than this incoherent dribble.

I will be watching it a second time, which is not something I do a lot.  I'm not sure there is a good way to describe or review this film.  I can only tell you it is very different and  has some extremely creepy scenes.  It felt a bit like Terry Gilliam meets Tarrantino meets E.A.Poe.  Alex van Warmerdam is known for directing films that are way outside the box.  I don't think he is a director that worries whether or not his films are popular or how many stars or tomatoes end up next to the title.  I do think he directs movies to tell a story he wants told.  If you love Disney flicks and big box office movies, if you thought the Interview was funny then DO NOT WATCH this film.  You will hate it. If you Do happen to love the directors I mentioned above, then you probably will like this movie.  It is haunting and violent -  It is very surreal and yet tells us ugly truths about ourselves. I think many people will have different ideas about what the movie is about. I saw it as a story about good vs evil and how easily evil can be the greater influence. The opening scene shows us the representatives of whom most people would see as ""good guys"" but Warmerdam wants us to think hard about whether or not they are indeed ""good"" - Could they perhaps be as evil as those they are trying to hunt down.  I don't want to spoil anything for those who do like this type of film.  If you watch movies to waste a bit of time, or need a ""feel good"" movie, then I recommend most of the movies playing at your local complex.  If you prefer stories that make you feel (even if the feeling is sometimes uncomfortable) Borgman is for you. If watching a movie that has you still  thinking about what you watched long after the credits roll, you will most likely agree with me.  Stories (movies, books, music) that enable us to think about life in a different way than we are used are important.  Anything that can make you think a bit harder about the important things in life, to me, is worth traveling outside ones own comfort zone.",1419897600,,2160,4.226829268292683

6447128,5,B00KTZAL78,"[NO SPOILERS--and be careful, because many other reviews have them]

This is an outstanding film in every way: the acting, the directing, the cinematography, and especially the script.  Its once-high Amazon rating has been pounded thanks to a huge influx of 1-star/1-line reviews after the movie was offered without charge to Amazon Prime members, something I've seen happen to great films a few times now, and not surprising when a challenging, uncompromising and decidedly non-mainstream film like this is offered to casual browsers just looking for cheap entertainment for the evening.  Most people want the same thing they've gotten hundreds of times before, but Borgman, to its great credit, confounds and frustrates expectations at every turn (at one point I turned to a friend and said ""I've never had less of an idea what's going to happen next in a film"").

This is a disturbing film, but not in the cheap and facile ways that many films touted as such are disturbing.  It aims to shake you up on a deeper level, and succeeds brilliantly.  If you have any interest in the many genres it might be considered a part of--drama, suspense, horror, dark fantasy, folk tale--you owe it to yourself to watch it.  It's so good that after it was over we agreed that we wanted to watch it again, and I'll certainly be searching out any future films by Alex van Warmerdam, who hit the trifecta with his combination of a brilliantly intelligent script, sure-handed direction, and a solid performance as Ludwig.",1419724800,22,1506,4.905511811023622

6447141,5,B00KTZAL78,"I loved this movie. I don't understand all of the negative reviews. I have watched quite a few movies by Scandinavian directors and they all have the same feel to them. They are slow moving and require quite a bit of thought. Though some parts were predictable, such as the fact that no good could have come from inviting a stranger into one's midst, I liked how the developing tension because of this choice eventually tore the family apart. The main villain was either (spoiler alert!) a succubus or some other nefarious nightmarish entity. I enjoyed watching it. The ending was a little vague, but I suspect it was driven out of need to expand/replenish the pack. In this respect is was sad; however, I feel that each character had a moment of choice and each chose to embrace their darker natures. Interesting movie. Also, I liked the fact that they didn't use any special effects as some other Scandinavian horror flicks do and which I find amateurish and 'clunky' when compared to the special effects used in American films. That said,  I believe this is a movie that you should watch and judge for yourself.",1419638400,2,1114,4.683673469387755

6447187,5,B00KTZAL78,"I enjoyed this film on many levels and have to say (contrary to other reviewers) that there is more than enough presented in the film to give the viewer closure. An important and glaringly obvious aspect of this film is apparently easily overlooked (judging by the reviews left here) and I will disclose this one point to which I am referring, so please stop here if you would like to decipher the film on your own as it may tint one's perception of the general course of the film. There is a great deal of focus on the ""evils"" of Camille and his cohorts. What I find more disturbing than the sect's brutality is the blind eye viewers turn to the fact that much of the malevolence is coming from the ""victims"" of the story. Everything that happens was invited and oft requested by Marina (or)... Its not a tale of the evils of external forces alone, so much as the wickedness that lies dormant in the hearts of all persons. I think to expound any further would defeat Bijvoet's intent of granting the viewer the opportunity to unveil the subtext within the context of the human experience, so I'll stop with that. In vague terms, I felt that the film is masterfully laced with esoteric and exoteric themes/scenery/imagery designed to lead or mislead the audience. A delightful cinematic experience.",1419465600,4,1298,4.647826086956521

6447194,1,B00KTZAL78,"A movie that is part of a growing trend nowadays; one that does not commit to an ending. This movie has no ending, and that is called a ""cold"" ending. I don't like the phrase because even it implies there IS an ending. There is some interesting stuff going on, but absolutely no conclusion. I don't quite understand the rave reviews. Was it captivating? Yes. Did it keep you guessing? Yes. Is it a complete waste of time? Yes. The setup for a great conclusion was there, its just that no one decided to write it. I have absolutely no idea what the entire point of this movie was.

This trend of not having an ending (leaving it up to the viewer to decide what happens, or in this case what the point of the entire movie was) has got to stop. It's not art-house, it's not ""brilliant"", it does't make you think or leave you with a sense of wonder. It's simple hack writing. Anyone can create a movie with a missing conclusion. You simply don't have to explain anything...giving you free reign to throw in any nonsensical components that you want, because you don't have to explain them. A WRITER weaves a story with a beginning, middle and end, adds plot twists you never see coming, and ties it all together (if they are good in a shocking or unexpected way) at the end, like say, Seven. It takes skill to do that. It is not easy to create interesting, believable characters. It takes no skill to create incomplete work. I give it one star for the direction, -5 stars for the writing.

I usually go into much more detail in my reviews, but I just don't want to waste anyone's time. If you place any value in storytelling (or just want a movie with an ending), don't see this movie. I don't mind movies that are a little open ended provided there is a discernible message. No Country for Old Men is a good example.

6447239,5,B00KTZAL78,"Borgman was one of the most disturbing films I have ever watched, a meditation on the banality and ordinariness of evil that sets its own terms and makes no compromises whatsoever for the squirming viewer.  Ultimately, I could only come to emotional grips with the story by realizing it referred to Nazism, religious death cults, and every other trauma in human history in which a charismatic figure brought people to ruin by manipulating their psyches.  Yet I was also aware that this rationalization was a cop-out, that the story has a physical life beyond parable, and points at the power and nature of evil to corrupt and destroy without purpose or sensitivity to its actions (""sleepwalking evil"" you might call it)--and that is what is ultimately so deeply distressing about this film.

My one point of confusion regarding the film was its marketing as a ""dark comedy,"" when for me its genre was unquestionably horror, a nightmare of the type that clings to you and will not let go.  I suppose that if a viewer read the film as one of class warfare (a homeless, gypsy-like race invading a privileged household), and sympathized with the downtrodden over the well-to-do, that viewer might find dark laughter in the way the family is so utterly deluded, and ultimately destroyed at the film's end.  But to me the brutal taking over of the minds, bodies and spirits of the family members was very far from funny.  Although the viewer is given things to dislike about the privileged family (the husband's racism and violence, the wife's manipulation or taking for granted of the family's wealth), you would have to be as heartless as the band of Borgman's gypsies not to feel agony when the kids are ""taken"" or the caring wife (""caring"" in the film is the source of weakness, just as not caring is the source of strength) so hopelessly ensnared and deluded.

What makes Borgman so disturbing, I feel, is the utter ease and flatness with which evil is done, and the seemingly powerless ineptitude and ordinariness of those with such profound powers of corruption.  In one scene, the homeless invader tells the children a tale about a child devoured and half-digested by a white beast, and the silly mother who begs to have her half-eaten baby back.  Only later do we realize (when the cute, 5-year-old ""helps"" an enemy of the tribe by braining him with a large stone) that it was this simple story itself that has hypnotized and ensnared the children, and that they are the half-eaten, who are now supposed to pity silly human emotions like those of their mother.  From half-eaten, they are soon completely devoured, as they willingly swill an anaesthetic and allow themselves to be operated upon, an enigmatic procedure that suggested to me the removal of part of the heart, or perhaps the soul itself (all the unfeeling members of the tribe have scars on their upper backs, and have presumably all been taken in the same way.)

What Borgman made me feel, above all, was the profoundness of horror in the dull, flat manner in which evil can be perpetrated.  There are no ""Exorcist"" moments of evil snarling its intent or depravity, no ""Wa-ha-ha!"" cries or even smiles of satisfaction from the evildoers.  When their work is done, when the parents are destroyed and the children introduced into their tribe of heartless zombies, there is no celebration; they simply march on, into the woods, likely on their way to the homes of the next victims.  Why?  We do not know.  Evil is enigmatic and not always with clear purpose, but tends towards one thing, seemingly inexorably, without excitement or laughter: destroying everything that crosses its path.",1419206400,6,3650,4.834670947030498

6447241,5,B00KTZAL78,"This is a creepy movie.  The main character starts the film living underground.  When a priest and two other men destroy his home, he escapes and warns other men living underground.  He eventually finds a place to live in the building of a woman he claims to know, but doesn't know him.  She hides the man from her husband.  But her three children interact with this strange man.  Two dogs enter the house while he's telling the kids a story about a beast and he tells the animals, ""It's not time.""  Very odd.  Also, be ready for subtitles.  This film is set in Holland somewhere.  When he attempts to leave, the woman doesn't want him to go.  But he refuses to stay in the building away from the family.  The husband doesn't know he is there and doesn't like him at all.  So in order for him to stay, he kills the gardener and his wife with the help of two mysterious women.  They then put the dead people's heads into buckets of concrete.  Very strange.  Makes sense only when they drop the bodies into the lake and they sink to the bottom.  The strange man has some weird connection to the woman and her one daughter.  The woman covers up for his killing the gardener and the girl kills a man for him.  I have to admit their is plenty of mystery in this movie.  I like it.  This flick keeps you off kilter the entire time.  I never knew where the film was going.

The humor is subtle at best. It's dark and borders on disturbing. There's a nonchalant attitude about the demise of a few characters. The Borgman himself is the only one who shows mild trepidation about killing. There's some out of place black tutu's and a performance art scene.

Borgman and his fellow demons are obviously able to gain control over the minds of women and children in order to manipulate them to their wills.

6447317,5,B00KTZAL78,"As far as I can tell, Camille Borgman is a devil who, at the beginning of the movie, lives in the soil of a Dutch forest in a rather spacious dwelling compared to the tiny subterranean holes in which his four cohorts sleep. When he's smoked out by a priest and some angry townsfolk, he's on the lam. But he soon finds shelter from a beautiful abstract artist named Marina who, at some point earlier in her life has formed a bond with Borgman by ""nursing"" him.
At first Marina's husband (didn't get his name, so I'll just call him Baldy) can't stand the homeless looking Borgman. But after Borgman and his cohorts murder the gardener and his wife and send a slew of Middle Eastern applicants, thus revealing Baldy's buffoonish racism, Borgman appears, fully shaved, with all sorts of sweet talk.
Marina's reaction is much more ambiguous. At first she just wants the devil to go away, but soon she's dying to lie with him. But in his avatar as the gardener, Borgman refuses. ""You never mess with the boss's wife."" It's as fun to see Marina frustrated thusly as it is to see her right bastard of a husband get his comeuppance. And the actor playing Borgman is a delight.",1414195200,3,1167,4.509433962264151

Also, there are no subtitle options - all you get are burned-in English subtitles which, annoyingly, include notations for the deaf and hard of hearing (such as [music continues indistinctly] and so on).

The recent flurry of negative reviews and votes has been spurred by amazon mass distributing the movie for free to unsuspecting viewers who are not prepared for this type of show and did not seek it out by genre.  Everyone has different tastes and the director had very esoteric intentions.  I have tried to give enough information in my review below to inform those who might like it, and warn those who will not. It's understandable why many won't enjoy it, but please accept this attempt to help people make that decision before watching.

4 STARS FOR A UNIQUE CINEMATIC OFFERING WITH COMPELLING BLACK HUMOR (not overtly funny)
3 1/2 STARS FOR A WELL FILMED, WELL ACTED, INTRIGUING TALE THAT (BY DESIGN) WILL ULTIMATELY NOT GIVE YOU THE ANSWERS YOU CRAVE

Calling this movie an allegorical tale is a euphemism for: Your not going to understand everything, even when it's over.  That's ok if you are willing to enjoy the evocative process and appreciate the intriguing concepts as they are presented.  It is atmospheric and lightly macabre.  Earthy in that it feels like a human evil, yet Borgman's ability to affect others so inexplicable, it seems supernatural.  It is an urban fable with strong Northern European cultural context.  The director explains in the liner notes that he explores the nature of evil and how it can strike in unexpected places in inexplicable ways.  As I describe further below, he does not explain much of the reason for what we see occur.

THE PLOT:  (NO SPOILERS)- The tale opens with Borgman living like a vagrant in a subterranean dugout in the forest with a couple of friends nearby in their own grave-like holes.  They flee when a group of local men organize a hunt (the reason not given).  The fact there is a priest in that hunting party hints at a good-and-evil conflict, but this is the only overt reference to religion.  Frankly, the hunting party looked a little on the rough side themselves.  So far, this just looks like a criminal element being chased out by the community.  However, the viewer soon finds that something more sinister, something harder to define is at work.  As Borgman flees, he stops by several affluent homes looking for a place to shelter and clean up.  He encounters a nice enough looking couple, but insults them when the husband turns him away.  The husband becomes angry and the encounter escalates into a beating for the vagrant.  Borgman reappears in the woman's house after the husband returns to work.  She is somehow affected and hides him in a small shack on the back of the property.  As Borgman's power over others becomes more apparent, the arrangement lengthens.  His influence deepens with the wife, the nanny, and even the children.  Cleaned up and looking different, Borgman is reintroduce to the husband as a potential gardener.  This strange character begins to involve other associates into a plan which we do not fully understand, yet it is clearly malevolent.  We also see that he can inject images and feelings into the wife's dreams in a seemingly supernatural way.  Now, one can assume that whatever bad that happens is retribution for the ill treatment early on.  However, the organization and frankness of the whole situation suggest this is exactly what Borgman does.

A NOTE ABOUT THE BLACK HUMOR: The movie description mentioned black humor, but this does not mean the show is overtly funny.  Rather, the weird visual images (like the human flower garden in the lake) and absurd occurrences are contrast against seemingly accepting family members.  It all becomes strangely engrossing.

ACCEPTING THIS TALE:  Many people will not like this tale.  It can be maddeningly opaque.  The meanings throughout this movie are intentionally open-ended specifically so the viewer can apply their own meaning.  The plot flows.  But, as an allegory the connections are not always strong.  There are obvious commonalities such as the scar or cut near the shoulder blades of some characters and we somewhat understand its affect.  However, there is no explanation as to what was done in that incision or why it was necessary.  If you cannot accept these kinds of generalities, you probably won't like this movie.  However, the acting is so strong, the events so intriguing, the Euro urban fable so unusual, many people who normally would not like this movie just may be surprised.  It can draw you in, a little like Borgman does himself.  Don't get too caught up in the lack of explanation.  Go ahead and look for your own interpretation of the events and characters.  Enjoy the acting, unique tale, and black humor.  Though there is the sense of the supernatural ability of Borgman, they make it feel so normal that it could happen to you and your family.  In part, the brilliance of this film lies in that the absurd occurrences and the feeling of normality can exist in the same space at the same time.  It's more real than surreal.  That's precisely what is so disturbing.

FINAL THOUGHT: In terms of creating what the director intended, I absolutely think the vagueness was necessary leaving things open to interpretation.  But perhaps they could have dialed it back one or two notches.  Explain just a tiny bit more while leaving the rest to mystery.  It was a nominee for Palme D'Or at Cannes, and the Dutch submission as best foreign film for the Academy Awards, though it failed to get that nomination.  Obviously there is a crowd out there who found great value in the film.",1411862400,92,5616,4.842436974789916

Several months later, I watched it again, and this time it really worked for me.  Without spoilers, I can say that, like a lot of movies, the plot of this movie is a metaphor, and once you get it all your questions are answered and things tidy up quite nicely.  As a hint, it's clearly about reproduction virus/meme style, given that you should be able to figure out the rest.

8661531,1,B00KTZAL78,"Utterly despicable film. The only movie I have hated more is ""The Lobster.""
Senseless, brutal violence. Idiotic relationships. Stupid premise. (spoilers below)
I'd rather have a drunken stranger vomit in my mouth than ever see another movie like Borgman.

First of all, how obvious. Borgman & his minions leap up from underground where they were sleeping. So--duh--Hades/Hell, demons erupting from the forest. And why pick on this normal little family? Why murder the gardener & his wife. Because they felt like it. They (the evil ones) sit in front of the TV frequently. A comment on people wasting their minds on TV (another of the overly obvious comments on modern life).
The white child of the fairytale Borgman tells the kids is most probably Lucifer. Borgman constantly references Jesus in a sneeringly vicious way. So yeah. He's Satan.
Dogs run through the house (shape-shifters? or just dogs, or the director's stupid idea of making Nature take over The West's Safe Home). There are frequent references to The West as being corrupt.
Why on earth would anyone allow a ""gardener"" to tear down all the trees, dig up the pond, deface the beautiful yard.
It is just senseless, stupid & irritating. I quit watching after the evil ones took the kids to a well & operated on them.
Waste of time! Hellishly bleak point of view. HATE it",1504224000,,1334,4.8766519823788546

8661535,3,B00KTZAL78,"What a strange movie.  It's well-acted and directed, but the plot is just plain weird.

The movie starts out simple enough. Borgman lives in an underground shelter and is forced out of his home when hunters with a scent dog come by and destroy his leaf-camouflaged roof.  Borgman escapes via a tunnel, alarms a few other underground dwellers like Ludwig and Pascal and runs into the neighborhood, focusing on a wealthier neighborhood in hopes of being able to bathe in a stranger's home.  Borgman seems like a man who simply needs some kindness and luxury, a helping hand.

He finds that with Richard and Marina.  This couple have a modern two-story home with small pond on the edge of a forest. Marina seems sympathetic to Borgman but Richard is immediately suspicious.  Does Borgman know his wife from a previous job?  He gets beaten badly by Richard in a jealous fit, but Marina shows compassion, lets Borgman rest in their small guest cottage on their property, and sneaks him food and gives him some first aid.  It is this action that in the end turns the family upside down.  Borgman is no longer the grateful homeless man, but a man who quickly manipulates the family, the three children, and the young Danish nanny.  Borgman becomes a modern-day Rasputin who haunts Marina's dreams and desires.  The movie becomes a suspenseful psychological horror film, bordering on absurdist realms. The confusion hits the viewer, who doesn't quite know what to think of this all.  The plot would be very probable but now Borgman is part of a group of criminals determined to wipe out all the people who threaten his new livelihood.  Marina, the nanny and the children all watch helplessly and do no seem threatened by the presence of Borgman and his crew.

The end is bizarre.  It leaves the viewer thinking there is more to come.  There is no real conclusion, which only adds to the suspense and leaves one wondering what this movie was all about  other than a struggle between rich and poor, good and evil.",1480550400,3,2003,4.7398843930635834
