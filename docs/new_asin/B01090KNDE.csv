8721663,5,B01090KNDE,"The Baraka Productions documentary, THE OTHER MAN, is a comprehensive portrait
of South Africa's last white president, F.W. de Klerk.  With consummate skill, director
Nic Rossier delineates the major personalities - not least of which, Nelson Mandela himself -
with whom de Klerk interacted in the last days of apartheid.  The documentary tells probably
all you need to know about how de Klerk came to make the momentous decision to alter
the course of South African history.  Although at that late juncture there was only one reasonable course for the country to take to avoid complete economic and social chaos, it took a brave man to begin to dismantle white power, which could have staggered on for a decade or so.  The documentary demonstrates that bravery, but also where that bravery stopped: in de Klerk's failure to admit a blind tolerance of the torture and assassination that the security services performed as a matter of course.  THE OTHER MAN reveals a deeply flawed man - but a brave one, nonetheless. As someone who documented much of the apartheid period, THE OTHER MAN seems to me a fine conclusion to the apartheid documentary record.",1524960000,,1153,4.953367875647668
8721664,5,B01090KNDE,"This is an extraordinary documentary that includes interviews with scholars, activists, and political leaders.  With bold questioning beside excellent footage of South Africa's apartheid past, the viewer sees an awful, dying regime with a decent steward.  F.W. de Klerk, like Gorbachev in the USSR, was a bridge between the dying world of one world and a transition to a new.  The documentary excellent illustrates the realities of de Klerk's complicity in crimes--his failure to disband the murderous security units--as well as the man's patience, humility, sure-footedness, devotion to a peaceful and his Nobel award for the negotiated peace.  One of the most important topics the film covers was how de Klerk called a referendum in the middle of negotiations.  This bold stroke demanded white South Africans own responsibility for the negotiations and demonstrate their willingness to change.  70% votes for continued negotiations.  This move by de Klerk also illustrated the man's political savvy:  linking the religious and business communities through financial and moral concerns, while marginalizing the extreme reactionary right-wing.  Overall, an amazing documentary.",1514678400,,1177,5.718390804597701
8721665,5,B01090KNDE,"Twenty years after Apartheid, a new generation of South Africans must grapple with whether to learn from their history or to repeat it.  Like Mandela, De Klerks pragmatic leadership for the good of the nation cannot be forgotten. Nic Rossier offers a gripping and balanced examination of a transformative figure in South Africas history. With a resurgence of debates about the legacies of racism and growing inequality -- for South Africans and Americans alike -- this timely film offers an unflinching look into the shadows of our past that may help us chart a brighter future.",1460505600,,578,5.020833333333333
8721666,5,B01090KNDE,"This documentary is an open window on several unknown key steps of the end of apartheid.
Showing the crucial role of F.W. De Klerk, this movie make us able to understand that very often official history and the truth do not exactly correspond.
Everyone know very well who is Mandela. It's not the same for F.W. De Klerk, the man who, as President, led the process of dismantling of apartheid.
""The Other Man"" is very useful help to fill this gap.",1460332800,,446,4.518518518518518
8721667,4,B01090KNDE,"Rossier focused his lens on one of modern political historys most controversial statesman, former president F.W. de Klerk, who presided over the end of the nations apartheid era and the release of his successor - Nelson Mandela.  Its a fascinating exploration long overdue if we consider de Klerk as important player in the history of South Africa.  Some new insights from a-list political insiders like former president Thabo Mbeki or Justice Richard Goldstone (the Goldstone Commission that investigated political violence in South Africa), award-winning journalist and author, Max Du Preez as well as many other original voices. The segment on the role/responsibility of de Klerk in the political violence is particularly eye-opening. Some parts could have been longer and more detailed but it's certainly a great introduction to de Klerk's legacy and the history of South Africa's most turbulent and fascinating time.",1452211200,,921,5.47887323943662
8721668,5,B01090KNDE,"Frederik Willem De Klerk led his country in the right direction during a time of epic change but yet little is known about him. ""The Other Man"" sensitively answers many of the pressing questions about this key figure in history but it doesn't gloss over De Klerk's inconsistencies and ties.  As usual, what emerges is complexity.  There are good history and future lessons in this film.  Highly recommended.",1444003200,,407,4.955882352941177
8721669,5,B01090KNDE,"Spotlight on The Other Man: F.W. de Klerk and the End of Apartheid

It provides fascinating glimpses of a complex and private man who wrestled with tough choices and made difficult decisions. In a world struggling with violence and divisiveness, the documentary is a timely release, offering many lessons to be learnt from history. Compelling, and highly recommended.",1443052800,2,702,5.4495412844036695
