4135267,3,B003L20IJ2,"Alain Resnais' Wild Grass is one of those cases where I liked the film-making but didn't care as much for the film. Resnais' playful love of the possibilities of cinema shines through, but the film never really makes enough of its subversion of a standard romantic comedy setup as Andre Dussolier discovers Sabine Azema's stolen wallet and becomes increasingly obsessed with her until he goes too far and is warned off by the police - only for her to find herself missing the attention and start to become obsessed with him. The characters behave with pleasing irrationality just as they tend to do in the rather messy real world, and both have their share of flaws. Dussolier in particular may or may not have a dark criminal past (or it may simply be an example of his compulsive need to turn his life into a tragedy to overcome), but the details are left deliberately vague. Yet for all the stylistic polish and panache it still feels not fully formed. Although an adaptation of Christian Gailly's L'Incident, it's the kind of idea you'd expect his On Connait la Chanson writers Agnes Jaoui and Jean-Pierre Bacri to come up with, and you can't help suspecting they'd have found much more in the material than Resnais does. Both leads have been better in their previous pairings, with Dussolier faring best here by virtue of having the most layered character, but Anne Consigny shines in the thankless role of his wife and Mathieu Amalric has a nice supporting role as a policeman, briefly forming half of a comic double-act with Michel Vuillermoz in one scene. While it's never really as good as it could have been, it's certainly no chore to sit through, and it does throw in one of the most memorable non-sequiter endings in years as a brief postscript to its already off the beaten track Biggles Flies Undone climax.",1284076800,2,1822,4.732704402515723
4135358,4,B003L20IJ2,"It's about a lady who gets mugged for her purse.  A man finds her wallet and turns it in to the police who return it to the lady.  She thanks the man.  He thinks she is not thanking him enough.  He wants more thanking and she wants to hear less from him. He's actually a sweet old guy, you think at first. But is he really?  I first saw this movie on a plane.  Unfortunately, we landed before I could see how the movie ends.  So I bought it to finally see the end.  No spoiler alert here.  You'll have to watch it yourself to see.  Oh yes, the director is one of the greatest filmakers in France, famous for thi sly and sophisticated who-done-its.",1321142400,,647,4.104
4135359,5,B003L20IJ2,"There is a fair amount of sheer whimsy in the film--a characteristic Nouvelle Vague feature that sometimes works, coming across as fresh and unexpected, and sometimes sort of falls flat, seeming merely throwaway, unserious.

But the film as a whole I found fascinating and wonderfully suggestive, particularly its guiding metaphor. This compares wild grass--uncultivated, uncared for, appearing in and around things of more usefulness (a paradigm case insisted upon by the film's opening credits is that of grass growing in cracks of pavement and tarmac)--to stray relationships, equally unplanned and uncultivated, that can sprout up in the cracks of more ordered segments of life, out of seemingly trivial encounters.

The central characters in Herbes Folles are not friends, not business acquaintances, not neighbors, not lovers (even Truffaut's famous menage a trois in Jules et Jim has more solid substance than what Resnais offers up here, though clearly we're dealing with similar inspirations and approaches)--their relationship has no rationale, no name, so it has no rules or accepted conventions, either. This makes it fraught, susceptible to endless hesitations and uncertainties, second guessings and regrets--in fact its very pointlessness renders it curiously intense, there being no established roles available to fall back into in case of missteps, the way an unsteady acrobat can drop into a net.

In this respect, the film is actually about freshness and unexpectedness: these aren't just inherited tics of a French film school. I found Resnais here to be thought-provoking in the same way that Dostoevsky is thought-provoking: people and their relationships are shown as fundamentally unpredictable, mysterious even to themselves.",1314230400,5,1750,5.621212121212121
4135360,5,B003L20IJ2,"This is a very complex and beautiful film, leaving many possibilities of interpretation, and most importantly, a reflection on an entire generation.

The main character discovers what it is to love Woman-as-companion or ""wife""; what is ""wife"" to a Man? What does he perceive as possible for him to experience?

The story is mysterious as Resnais respects what is interesting about the story: love as an extremely sensitive and hidden point among men. The mystery lies in the main character's own incomprehension of what is happening to him. The standpoint of the woman is secondary, for once in that generation.

We are further solicited when the object of his desire is unconscious of him, and how important their relationship has become to him.

As a person younger than these characters, I particularly enjoyed the ending which perfectly reflects the mindset of those people I know from the generation of the main characters. My question to them all - why this reaction?  What created your mind-set? What is the reaction of women the age of this man? Will you ever tell us?

4135361,2,B003L20IJ2,"As the movie ended and the credits were rolling up the screen I sat there and wondered what any of it meant and could only think of the money I had just wasted by purchseing it. This is another example of critics raving about a movie only to find that most people didn't like it, or didn't understand it. Of course one doesn't want to say one didn't understand it as that makes one ""culturally inferior"". So be it. It was a terrible movie, other than the beautiful photography and colors, the plot made no sense, the actors actions were not understandable and one constantly wondered what one had missed along the way that would lead to such confusion.  You should not have to read a review to understand a movie, but I did keep returning to the DVD case to reread what it said about it. Unfortunately, the liner notes were of no use in unravelling the pointless plot. Spend your money elsewhere.",1301788800,2,896,4.463414634146342
4135362,2,B003L20IJ2,"I bought this movie for $6 from a Blockbuster that was going out of business. If I had waited a week, I would have wasted only $4. I bought the DVD in spite of the ""lead"" actors, Dussollier and Azema, who were the ""leads"" in a worse movie, ""Private Fears in Public Places"". I bought WG because of director Resnais early work, plus the lesser characters played by Emmanuelle Devos, Mathieu Amalric, and Anne Consigny (all three who were in the wonderful movie,""A Christmas Tale""). Dussollier and Azema can not carry a movie; Devos, Amalric, and Consigny, collectively, could and can. So, right off the bat, WG is upside down and wrong side out. Throughout the film, I said to myself Ms. Azema must be related to one of the powers-that-be, because, she does not have the presence, the acting ability, nor the looks to be a lead in a movie. The Amazon review refers to her as the ""director's partner"". Bingo!! Dussollier is not an interesting enough actor to be a lead in a movie unless he is playing opposite someone like Daniel Auteuil, as he did in ""A Heart in Winter"", another wonderful French film. I will not be fooled by the Dussollier, Azema, Resnais trio, again.

By the way, the sets and photography are sensational. I also loved the little Smart car that Ms. Azema drove around in. Maybe my $6 was not entirely wasted.",1300492800,2,1326,4.571428571428571
4135363,5,B003L20IJ2,"Alan Resnais is probably the last survivor and shares with Erich Romer the honor of being the most intellectual filmmakers of the extinct French New Wave. (Hiroshima mon amour and The last year in Mariembad talk by themselves)

But Resnais surprised us with this smart script about the encounter of two beings through a random fact. A woman is unexpectedly assaulted after shopping. And when an introspective man finds her wallet (with all her documentation and brings it back to police, a web of mutual intends for establishing contact will pave the way for a film in which the ontological loneliness of both beings will emerge, although the levels of intensity between both of them exchange roles.

A sumptuous photography of nocturnal Paris, a magnificent direction, the marvelous takes all the way through, an engaging illumination and a tour de force performances by all cast make of this witty film a must-have for all of them who -like me- expect and applause the role of author-cinema.",1298246400,,993,4.975903614457831

I agree with the previous reviewer that there is some great cinematography here and some intriguing aspects to the film but the characters make so little sense that it moves beyond absurdist or surreal to meaningless.  In Marienbad, it was clear that one would never get to the truth but here some similiar threads just seem forced and pointless. Disappointing.",1292544000,2,467,4.682926829268292
4135366,5,B003L20IJ2,"WILD GRASS (LES HERBES FOLLES) is based on the novel 'L'incident' by Christian Gailly, a writer who delights in taking simple incidents and pushing them to the extremes of climax beyond which few would ever dream.  But Alain Resnais has taken this novel (adapted by Alex Reval and Laurent Herbiet), infused it with his own characteristic joy of playing reality versus imagination, memory versus illusion, and has come up with a film that will likely have a limited audience, but for those who delight in letting go and simply flying along with the imagination of a genius or two, then WILD GRASS will satisfy and more.

The story is a romance in the manner of a hesitation waltz.  The story is narrated (by Edouard Baer) to give the opening aspects of the story momentum.  Marguerite Muir (Sabine Azma), a dentist and Spitfire pilot, has just purchased shoes and leaves the store when her handbag is snatched by a running thief. Later, the aging Georges Palet (Andr Dussollier) finds a red wallet in a parking lot, examines the contents, struggles with the burden of what to do, and finally turns the wallet in to the police, Bernard de Bordeaux (Mathieu Amalric) who takes his name in case there is a reward.  Georges returns home to his wife Suzanne (Anne Consigny), who understands that Georges' strange behavior since his father's recent death may be enhanced by a new predicament: Georges is  worried about the incident.  He places telephone calls to Marguerite, visits her home, writers her letters - all of which confounds him as to his obsession with the woman he has never met.  Georges family (he has two children) find his preoccupation strange and indeed Georges seems to have a dark secret from his past that causes him to have minor verbal explosions that seem wholly inappropriate.  The incident becomes his life.

Meanwhile Marguerite shares her 'stalker' with her fellow dental assistant Josepha (Emmanuelle Devos) who attempts to manage Marguerite's change in behavior.  Marguerite now is the one who needs to know more about Georges and stalks him.  Ultimately Marguerite invites Georges to accompany her and her fellow pilots on a practice flight and a wildly entertaining practice flight game ensues: both Georges and Marguerite navigate the social protocols of giving and acknowledging appreciation and this bizarre catch as catch can romance comes to a Hollywood end - complete with flashbacks to old films etc.  The audience is left to figure out just what has really happened  - is this a wild love story on a collision course or is it simply a pair of fantasias played by two strange, emotionally isolated, and bored people, longing for life to perk up a bit?

Just as the title WILD GRASS suggests, little incidents (or invasions of wild grass into cracks and interstices quite by accident) can cause a butterfly effect and that is where the now 87 year old Resnais feels most at home. The irresistibly colorful cinematography is courtesy Eric Gautier and the perfect musical scoring is by Mark Snow.  The danger in any kind of surrealism theme is that the audience becomes concerned that much of it doesn't make since.  And so it is here, where even with the aid of the narrator there are many twists and turns that seem simply flights of fancy - and they probably are!

8399333,5,B003L20IJ2,"Any film directed by Alain Resnais at age 88 was a must for me to explore. After renting the DVD and falling in love with it, I had to own a copy to enjoy whenever I pleased. I am writing my review years after that purchase because I just screened the movie for good friends, and they were disappointed (""no coherent story""). First things first: ""CRAZY GRASS"" is the correct English translation of the original title. And appropriate! As I urged my friends the other day, you must let yourself go with the flow of the story. And there certainly is a story unfolding, whether events can be easily explained by logic or not. This is a Resnais flick, remember? I enjoyed the two films he completed after this project prior to his death, but with  nowhere near my admiration for the flat out bravado filmmaking on display here. This movie is nothing less than a Master Class in filmmaking, presented by one of the true Masters. The framing of the compositions, the colors, the camera movement, all superb. The film glows with its own internal, semi-hallucinatory (okay, call it semi-crazy!) energy, like Peter Weir's earliest movies. Perhaps the key line is spoken by our unidentified narrator: ""After the cinema, anything is possible."" Or, in this instance, IN cinema anything is possible. Life will try to fill any available space with its energy, like the crazy grass sprouting in any little crack in the pavement. Or, as John Lennon wrote: ""Life is what happens while you're making other plans."" Georges and Marguerite never planned for their paths to cross, but a not uncommon incident of modern life planted the seed for their meeting. This movie is one of my very favorite films of the 21st Century, lovingly crafted by a Master whose work dates back to the middle of the previous one.",1470441600,,1788,4.730769230769231

8399335,5,B003L20IJ2,"Alain Resnais's genius is more to nibble on than ""Wild Grass.""

To say the least what a concept: make a movie based on gut instincts and one's personal vision, rather than common sense and rationality. Some might call Resnais's movies ""surrealism"" yet that's pass. Bizarre, off the wall, eccentric, none of those terms also fail to describe his film and cinematography art. Oh, okay, I'll just call it entertaining. That's a simple enough concept, to describe this cutting edge film, excuse me, the edge beyond the cutting; to say the least ""Wild Grass"" is out there.

This movie starts out with actress Sabine Azema, playing Marguerite Muir, buying a new pair of shoes. Once she gets to the garage, a thief steals her pocketbook. It seems Muir does not want to  chase the thief in her new pair of shoes. Her pocketbook falls to the garage floor where it's picked up by a stranger, Andre Dussollier, playing the character Georges Palet. Not knowing what to do, he opens the pocketbook, sees the name, and ends up surrendering it to the police.

The bizarre adventure starts. And bizarre is putting this movie mildly. Yet Director Resnais wants the viewer to see and feel what happens next. A true inventor Resnais uses internet technology, masking, movie technology, the camera, and graphic arts technology with a Spitfire airplane and car, all wrapped in one movie ball.

It seems as if Resnais wanted to follow the French movie making tradition, and push it into the next Century. That's what he did, pushed the envelope pass Goddard, and Monet. Yes, this is an art movie, yet it's more than that. It's more like a visual movie told with images.

For those who enjoy cutting edge movies, those looking for something new and entertaining, ""Wild Grass"" fits the bill.",1438041600,,1767,4.815181518151816
8399336,4,B003L20IJ2,"[Spoilers]

Resnais is a great, and I want to give his intellect due credit. A reading undermentioned in the reviews is the notion that the entire film could be a fantasy and/or a movie within a movie.

There is a moment near the end when we are shown, again, the sequence of the purse-snatching followed by Georges in the parking lot picking up the wallet. At that moment it seems nearly obvious that he has possibly fantasized all that preceded this cinematic moment (and all that followed his finding of the wallet), a fantasy about the stranger whose wallet he holds.

As well, we've got the cinematic element. Georges goes to the cinema (and we hear the 20th Century Fox theme music, loudly, as he exits), then again toward the end we hear the same, only this time as part of the Wild Grass soundtrack. An homage to cinema perhaps, but also, given the fantasy element throughout, suggestive of fantasy.

Both characters, too, are caught up in fantasy: obsession, first his with her then hers with him. There is an element of non-reality to the film.

This is not the finest piece of filmmaking to exist, but it is far superior to 99% of the cr@p that comes out of Hollywood. What I take away is not its flaws but its ambiguity, its light touch, and its fantastic final scene.",1424563200,,1280,4.547826086956522

By turns cerebral, thought-provoking, pretentious and off-putting, ""Wild Grass"" is a tale of two strangers who become inexplicably obsessed with one another.

Adapted by Alex Reval and Laurent Herbiet from the novel ""L'Incident"" by Christian Gailly, and directed by the legendary French New Waver Alain Resnais, ""Wild Grass"" focuses on what happens after Georges (Andrei Dussollier), a middle-aged married man who's an aviation aficionado and all-around nut-case, finds a stolen wallet belonging to Marguerite Muir (Sabine Azema), a frizzy-haired (could it be the ""wild grass"" of the title?) red-headed dentist who flies propeller planes in her spare time.  Without even knowing the woman, Georges finds himself inexorably drawn to her, and he'll stop at nothing to insinuate himself into her life.  In turn, Marguerite, a single woman who appears to have been boycotting beauty salons her whole life, develops mixed feelings for this man who has essentially become a stalker and who has even gone so far as to slash the tires on her car.  And before you know it, Marguerite has become so unstrung and neurotic in her own right that she's sleeping in the cockpit of her plane and has become such a sadist with the dental drill that she would give Dr. Christian Szell - or the Marquis de Sade, for that matter - a run for his money in a pain-inflicting sweepstakes.

The off-putting nature of the film comes from the fact that the characters often feel more like the product of a writer's imagination than organic outgrowths from the real world.  Their motivations and responses are almost maddeningly preposterous and unclear at times and, as a consequence, our patience with their behavior wears decidedly thin after awhile.  There are other distractions as well, such as Marguerite's extraordinarily unmanaged Little Orphan Annie coiffure (we find ourselves wanting to cry out, ""Why don't you run a damn comb through that thing?"") and the self-conscious cinephilia that is oh-so-typical of French filmmakers.

On the positive side, Resnais manages to achieve a hypnotic rhythm with his fluidly flowing tracking shots, and there are definitely some elements of style and theme from some of Resnais' bona fide classics, like ""Hiroshima, Mon Amour"" and ""Last Year at Marienbad,"" running through this work (the nature of intimacy between strangers and near-strangers being just one of the issues touched upon in all three films).

However, these few virtues are not enough to overcome the unlikable nature of the storyline and the two loony and self-absorbed folk who serve as its protagonists.  So I guess it's only appropriate that the movie culminate in a spectacularly stupid and laughable into-the-wild-blue-yonder finale that literally, as well as figuratively, crashes and burns on its way to that much delayed but highly appreciated ""fin,"" signaling the end of our ordeal.  A fond farewell to all around.",1323993600,,2924,5.211087420042644
