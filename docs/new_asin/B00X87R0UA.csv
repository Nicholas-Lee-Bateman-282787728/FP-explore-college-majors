Right now only available on Amazon Video, but I live in a rural area where streaming on the computer is just not an option.  Everything buffers forever.  Please bring out US version for Region 1 on DVD or Blu-Ray.  It would be much appreciated.",1526083200,2,327,4.209677419354839
8715352,5,B00X87R0UA,"Quite a contrast to the preachiness of the American version from USA network: invites you in to the middle of things, and then slowly unwinds the plot around you as you discover what was done, and why, and enjoy the resolution.",1518566400,,227,4.560975609756097
8715353,5,B00X87R0UA,Watching the American version of this series inspired me to purchase the original Norwegian version and I'm glad I did. Terrific story and very well acted by the cast. I think that more often than not that we miss the mark when remaking European series. In this case I'm not sure I could say which version I like best. I'm just starting my fourth viewing (I've had this DVD for awhile so it's not consecutive viewing).,1515974400,,418,4.5131578947368425

8715355,5,B00X87R0UA,"This series really hooked me - a slow building police investigative thriller, with guy relationship and family relationship interwoven with it. I ordered it for the gay theme, but it turned out to be much more than that, and turned out the gay theme was really a minor but valuable (and low key, and nice) thread in the series. I planned on watching one episode a night, but after a certain plot development, it was like oh F, I got to watch the next one now! (Only 6 1hr episodes, and a full story that concludes.) It was very well written in how each character was working from his own viewpoint. And every character had a strong role in the series which I really liked. I had to watch the 1st episode twice just to get all the characters straight. And the story worked perfect with that Norway/Euro feel, from the sort of weathered Norwegian feel to the characters/actors, the Norway lifestyle, the Euro police divisions. I can't imagine an American remake of this just to change the language (which I assume was the reason - the subtitles were no problem). After watching it, I have no inclination the see the American version. Before ordering the series, I saw the youtube videos that extract the gay scenes and puts it to music (search ""phillip and lukas, gay short""), but they're all from the American version, and it's apparent the gay part was embellished and the feel of it changed more than it needed (as you could expect for an American remake). I don't think you'll be let down at all by the Norway version.",1501977600,,1520,4.5510948905109485
8715356,5,B00X87R0UA,"I am only halfway through the mini, but I am already loving it. It's one of those things that makes you wonder why they have to make an English version. Are people really so lazy that they can't read subtitles on an already perfect production? At the very least, I hope the remake will be better than the remake of Les Revenants (The Returned). That remake was completely flat and unnecessary.",1478822400,,393,4.549295774647887
8715357,5,B00X87R0UA,"Eyewitness is a very tight, complex, well-written Norwegian noir series with many similarities to other Nordic series in terms of style and pace (Broen, The Killing, etc). It also has strong female leads. But the more intriguing aspect is its focus on its 2 young male protagonists. That sets it apart from many of the detective noir stories to date. Only 6 episodes at 60 minutes each. But it packs a lot of story and entertainment.",1477353600,3,433,4.7105263157894735
