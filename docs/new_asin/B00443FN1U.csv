4259903,5,B00443FN1U,"MPI is continuing to thrill Lucy fans by bringing these great Lucille Ball specials to us looking great and continuing to provide the full history of all the magic Lucy brought throughout her whole career.  These two specials are two of the very best.  We all know that after HERE'S LUCY ended Lucy did these specials for years.  Many had her continuing with the basic synopsis of Lucy the hilarious redhead getting into all her fun trouble and situations.  These two are very different and introduced a brand new side of Lucy to her fans and all other television viewers alike.  She sunk her teeth into these specials and let other sides of her immense talent show.

HAPPY ANNIVERSARY & GOODBYE is indeed a comedy but it is in no way the light hearted comedic fun of a Lucy show.  This is mature adult comedy.  Lucille plays a woman who is having a crisis in her marriage.  Art Carney plays her husband and both are excellent playing a couple who have both let themselves go and taken each other for granted.  They separate and both try to move on without the other.  It is amazing to see Lucy deal with a male masseur and also try to deal with a date that goes a little further than she expected.  Who would ever imagine Lucy on a date and in a hotel room with a man who wants to sleep with her.  Well this is another side of Lucy's comedic abilities and she brings huge emotion and passion to this newfound level of comedy.  This is adult comedy and she is entirely believable as she becomes this lost woman on a journey of self discovery.  Her trademark red hair doesn't even appear till the final make-over.

Then we have WHAT NOW CATHARINE CURTIS.  She is a woman on a journey of self discovery here as well but this special is very different from the first.  This special is done in three scenes and the first is an amazing dramatic monologue.  Lucy is a recent divorcee spending the first night in her new apartment having just moved in.  She is there among the boxes and furniture and emotionally goes through all the trials and emotions that led to the breakup of her marriage.  Lucille is amazing here.  The next two scenes are very good as well but the opening monologue scene will have Lucy fans speechless.  What talent.  On this one dvd we get sides of Lucille Ball we have never seen.  We get true comedy in the first but not slapstick comedy we know and love from the Lucy shows.  Instead it is a much more mature comedy that is multi-faceted in showing Lucy's talents.  And the latter special gives a rare glimpse into Lucy's true dramatic abilities.  This dvd is not one to let pass by.  Lucille Ball was and is a legend and these two specials do even more to display the amazing talent and range this unique woman possessed.  Highly recommend to all Lucille Ball fans as well as fans of great artistry.",1306800000,5,2822,4.423300970873786
4259904,5,B00443FN1U,"Happy Anniversary and Goodbye is really a comedy special. Comedy can be about real dramatic situations but they are presented hilariously.  I love the 70s cutting edge diagloue at time.  I love Lucy and Art's fight after the wedding, Lucy on the bike and water bed, Art's reaction to Lucy getting a massage from Aaron , the sentimental ending.  nanette does a good job here but Peter Marshall's character isn't that great.  Overall, a very good special.

What Now Catherine Curtis starts out with a first act showing Lucy's best dramatic work besides Stone Pillow and The Big Street.  Lucy plays the divorcee on her first night alone perfect and you see all the emotions common to women like Catherine.  You see hatred for the other women, saddness for being alone, a housewife, and a saracstic side referring to the good time.  You see her blaming herself and trying to deal (without their voices being heard) with one daughter's peroccupance with college and the other one telling her to go back to the father.  The second act ""First Affair"" is almost as good as a lighter drama.  Lucy and Art play scared characters that don't know if they are ready for another romance. (He's a widower and talks constantly about his beloved wife.)  The skit is done with class.  The last skit ""First Love"" has some great dramatic lines about the age difference between Catherine and Peter, but Peter sings offkey at her when talking about traveling and the show ends with these lines.  Catherine:  ""I left a duck defrosting in the refrigator.""  Peter:  ""Send it a postcard.""  Truly, that diagloue showed Catherine's uneasiness but also was a little too comedic for me. I also love how the opening character show pictures of Lucy and Desi and Lucie which remains us Lucy knows Catherine.  She was a divorcee with children wanting their parents to remarry each other and definetaly suffer the same emotions that Catherine did.  Therefore this is a look into Lucille's heart.  A classic!  Note the reference to 23 years of marriage.  From I Love Lucy's beginning to Here's Lucy's end was 23 years and maybe Lucy was also showing on screen her frustration of her being out of the series TV circuit!",1304899200,,2182,4.762666666666667
4259905,5,B00443FN1U,THESE OLD LUCILLE BALL SPECIALS ARE A FLASH BACK FROM THE PAST. IF YOUR A COLLECTOR YOU WILL WANT TO HAVE THIS.,1298073600,,111,4.090909090909091
4259906,5,B00443FN1U,"I have been very pleased with the previous ""Lucille Ball Specials"" on DVD.  This DVD continues that with these two great specials.  While both specials have funny moments, Lucille Ball gives very brilliant and subtle serious performances in both.  Another rarity here is that for both of these specials she speaks in her normal lower voice (instead of the higher ""Lucy"" character voice.

I have been a long-time Lucille Ball fan, and while I had seen most of her film performances, these specials evaded me over the years.  I am delighted to finally be able to add them to my collection.  The picture is gorgeous, and MPI has really done a good job with these.  There are some moments when you can tell the age of the film, but most of the time the colors are vibrant and the picture is so clear that it's hard to believe they are both about thirty-five years old.

The first special ""Happy Anniversary and Goodbye"" was very enjoyable.  The cast was great, and it was fun to see Arnold Schwarzeneggar in his first role.  I loved the last scene and how gorgeous Lucille Ball looked.  It was also great to see Nanette Fabray and Peter Marshall recollect on the special and their thoughts on working with Lucy.

I also enjoyed ""What Now, Catherine Curtis?""  Although I loved the part with Art Carney and the part with Joseph Bologna, the first part which is just a monologue was really amazing to watch.  I was truly just drawn in to Lucy's performance, and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  The special feature with Joseph Bologna was also fun to watch as he remembered working with Lucy.

I hope that MPI continues releasing these Lucille Ball specials.  I have truly enjoyed them.  Although I love the ""Lucy"" character these specials are wonderfully different, and they make me love Lucille Ball even more!",1292457600,2,1813,4.647798742138365
4259907,5,B00443FN1U,"MPI is releasing another 2 of The Lucille Ball Television Specials on one dvd! This time they have put both Happy Anniversary and Goodbye and What Now Catherine Curtis? on one disc. These one hour Specials both featured the great Art Carney (from The Honeymooners) with Lucy.

Happy Anniversary And Goodbye directly followed the last episode of Season 6 of Here's Lucy, airing on November 10, 1974. Lucy was paired with Art Carney again, as they had previously played a married couple in the great 1967 Walter Matthau/ Inger Stevens comedy, A Guide For The Married Man. Lucy and Art play Malcolm and Norma Michaels who are celebrating their 25 year Wedding Anniversary, and at the same time are losing their only daughter who is getting married. When their daughter marries, they see each other alone for the first time in decades and realize they are very unhappy with what they see and decide to separate. After living apart for awhile, they realize just how much love there actually was between just the two of them. This is just a beautifully acted special and is very touching. Lucy played comedy/drama just as well as comedy. (If you've ever seen Stone Pillow or any of her earlier drama films, you'll know what I mean.) Nanette Fabray does a wonderful job playing Lucy's friend and Peter Marshall is also great as Art Carney's friend, both of whom try and help them get through their separation from each other. You will also see a very young Arnold Schwarzenegger making his American television debut as Rico, the muscled masseur.

The second special What Now Catherine Curtis?, is divided into 3 Acts. This Special aired on March 30, 1976. The first Act is a Monologue with just Lucy speaking of her life on being divorced after 23 years of marriage. Act 2 titled, First Night, is about how Catherine, now living alone in her own new apartment, is getting ready to embark on a new romance with Art Carney- a widowed carpenter. The last Act 3 is titled First Love. Catherine is confronted with fears of falling in love with a man 14 years younger than herself, played by Joseph Bologna. Lucy is magnificent in these 3 Acts! I think it's because she is playing a part so close to herself! She was faced with fears of being alone after her divorce from Desi and both Desi and Gary Morton are younger than Lucy, so these are fears that Lucy really did deal with in her own personal life. Lucy's performance is priceless!

MPI has also included some really great Bonus materials with this dvd! Peter Marshall, Nanette Fabray and Joseph Bologna all tell some fabulous stories of working with Lucy! Nanette Fabray also tells some wonderful personal stories of being invited to Lucy's home for dinner. From Lucy's radio show, LET'S TALK TO LUCY, we get to listen to Shows #104 and #105 when Lucy talks with Mary Tyler Moore from January 28th and 29th in 1965. It's so fabulous listening to these two television heavyweights talking about being working moms and their son's playing their drums in their homes to the Beatles songs! There are also some funny out takes and dvd promos included.

With these two Specials being released on December 14, 2010, that only leaves 4 more Lucy Specials left to be released on dvd- Lucy In London, Carol Plus Two, Lucy Comes To Nashville and Lucy Moves To NBC! Also being released on November 30, 2010 from CBS/Paramount is The Lucy Show Season 3 with the very rare film included as an extra, Lucille Ball At The 1964 World's Fair! I have spoken to both CBS and MPI and found out the following: March is the month to watch! MPI said Season 4 of Here's Lucy is scheduled for release on March 29, 2011, which you can pre-order right now and CBS said The Lucy Show Season 4 is scheduled for a March 15, 2011 release! Wow, after March 2011, we will only need 2 more seasons of Here's Lucy and The Lucy Show and 4 more Lucy Specials dvds! CBS and MPI know exactly what all of us Lucy Fans want and with all these great extras they are including with the Seasons and Specials, they certainly get my Thousands Of Thank You's!",1286064000,25,4056,4.598066298342541
4259908,5,B00443FN1U,"""Happy Anniversary & Goodbye"" and ""What Now, Catherine Curtis?"" are two of the best specials that Lucille Ball starred in.  ""Happy Anniversary & Goodbye"" aired in November of 1974 on a Tuesday night at 9:00 pm.  The ratings were excellent. It received a 27.9 rating and 42% share of the viewing audience and placed 4th in the weekly ratings.  The special can be more classified as a comedy/drama.  Lucy and Art Carney are both excellent.  ""What Now, Catherine Cautis?"" aired in 1976, again, on a Tueday night at 10:00 pm.  It received a 22.6 rating and 36% share of the viewing audience and place 16th in the ratings.  Both specials won their time periods.  Catherine Curtis consisted of three short episodes and Lucille Ball was excellent in all three.  She was definitely overlooked for an Emmy Award.  I applaud MPI for releasing these specials in addition to the season sets of ""Here's Lucy.""  ""Here's Lucy"" season 4 will see a release in early 2011.  MPI has done an excellent job and should be applauded.  I would suggest that everyone order these special specials.",1285891200,10,1071,4.786885245901639

8415711,5,B00443FN1U,What a treat to finally see these lost gems. Happy Anniversary & Goodbye is your standard Lucy fare staring Art Carney. Funny and predictable is how I would rate it. The real gem of this set turns out to be What Now Catherine  Curtis. Lucy gives one of the most moving and powerful performances of her career. The first 20 minutes is Lucy doing a monologue that is riveting and holds your attention. Her acting shines from beginning to end. If you are a Lucy fan you would not want to miss What Now Catherine Curtis!,1362009600,2,516,4.375
