1804666,5,B00007AJKI,"Favorite film in all of existence. I've watched it many times and will continue to watch it -- it's one of those that I watch to sort of regain some perspective. It makes me feel a very particular way, a feeling no other movie has given me. I feel as though I continue to live a dream after watching this. Watching it for the first time I think honestly changed my whole perspective and sort of altered the way I think about reality/our waking life, as cheesy and unlikely as that may seem, lol.

It is extremely philosophical, and I think limited types of people really grasp and are able to embrace the meaning of this film. It is truly extraordinary. Richard Linklater is unfathomably brilliant. The quotes throughout make the hair on my arms stand up every time. I have a couple very in depth theories on what's really going on in this movie, but I won't go into that; it's one of those you take what you will from it.

If you're into dreams or lucid dreaming, then this film is pretty much mandatory for you to watch! (:",1482192000,,1025,4.361256544502618

1804680,4,B00007AJKI,Better be on your A-game when you watch this movie; it demands your full attention with thought-provoking discourse. A thinker's movie. I almost floated off the couch watching it.,1481328000,,179,5.206896551724138

1804687,3,B00007AJKI,"What's being said throughout the movie is very interesting and thought provoking, and the animation is really amazing, too. But I'm putting this at three stars because it's so damn BORING. I really wish this movie was more than a series of back-to-back monologues.. I watched about 45 mins and couldn't force myself to sit through it anymore. I might as well have found the script for the movie and read it on my own time instead of listening to people drone on as animated versions of themselves. My advice - you'll probably not wanna be sober while watching this. Enter a mind-altering state before watching the movie so you can distract yourself with how nice the animation is when the monologues turn too mundane (or maybe even get into an interesting thought loop about the universe or something.. whatever will distract you from how mundane the rants can become).",1477612800,,869,4.8
1804688,5,B00007AJKI,"My absolute favorite movie of all time! Never before have so many deep and profound thoughts be incorporated into a cinematic experience like no other. I used to host ""Waking Life"" parties where I would have friends over to watch the movie and discuss. Many of these ideas have made their way into my world view. Some less disturbing than others ; )",1475539200,,349,4.555555555555555

1804690,4,B00007AJKI,This film is very interesting. The different art throughout the movie is mind opening and is a kick to watch. Definitely a must buy if you are wanting a different perspective on life and want to see a great animated movie.,1474243200,,222,4.439024390243903

1804714,4,B00007AJKI,"There are many things to explore about a passive state before waking up, and yet not fully asleep.  This is what is explored in this movie.  Although not unpleasant, or uninteresting, the dreamlike but not fully-awake state, is one that does not represent ""the good life"".  Unfortunately, the main character in this film is caught in this state.  From a broader perspective, it is part of life, in making transitions sometimes, to live through states like this.  We experience anomie and alienation, and there is a sense of being lost in emptiness.  The main character is somewhat aware of this passivity, and to some extent seems close to waking up to a new life, to a new day of activity.  But it doesn't quite happen.  The plethora of dreamlike images keeps him on an interface, a superficial unfolding of numerous scenes.  That life is like this sometimes makes one aware that there is some deep meaning to capture about this film.",1454630400,,935,4.75776397515528
1804715,5,B00007AJKI,"To watch Waking Life is like breathing pure oxygen after an extended period of trying to breathe through a tightly woven cloth. You didn't even realize you were suffocating. It makes me want to find these people and have them around me all day long. This film is not without it's flaws, there is banality. However, the presence is in perfect balance. Perfect artistry is a sin. It should be intermixed with that which is not worthy as a counterpoint, as a juxtaposition. Art requires contrast and context. More to the point, it should force it's audience to recognize anti-art and by extension, anti-life. Waking Life does all these things and at times is a casual drift along the silent Ganges to boot.",1454371200,,703,4.723577235772358
1804716,5,B00007AJKI,This movie says all the important things about life that everyone needs to know in order to come to a place of self-realization. If you are searching for truth and peace with yourself. Watch this!,1454371200,,196,4.628571428571429

1804719,5,B00007AJKI,This is my favorite movie ever. Really. It's painted animation of real actors and actresses ...and it's all centered around dreaming and waking and philosophy...I mean all that together in one movie? Perfection. So hop aboard and examine the nature of everything and observe!,1452124800,,275,5.2727272727272725
1804720,5,B00007AJKI,"A very smart, philosophical movie. During the first viewing, I wanted to stop every 20 minutes to 'take it all in'. It made me question my existence and the reality. However, it never gets boring as one interesting idea follows another. There is one scene in particular, 'The Holy Moment' which has the ability to raise your consciousness-- seriously, how many movies can do that?
The script is rich like a classic piece of literature and the movie is worth many viewings, as we discover new meanings each time. And, oh, that perfect monologue by Linklater at the end just binds it together so well! It's the mind and soul's trip of a lifetime.",1450051200,,644,4.657894736842105

1804724,5,B00007AJKI,"As an existentialist,  I love deep, insightful, philosophical thought.

1804727,5,B00007AJKI,"This is one of the best, most pleasing Blu-rays I have.  It's the German import, but it's Region-Free, and plays without a hitch on my Sony Blu-ray player.  I can't get over the colors and the look of it.  There's a silvery, liquid undertone to these big patches of paint-looking colors.  It's some kind of miracle that allows such vivid images to come off without a hint of harshness to the eye.

The philosophical dialogue is secondary, for me, to the way this film looks.  I mean, I like the script okay, and some of the voice acting is brilliant (the gun guys in the bar give some of the best voice work I've ever heard), but I never thought this movie was the Bible of Trippy Idea-Movies that some fans find it.  But it's still plenty good enough not to break the spell cast by the stunning visuals.

I always liked this movie.  But seeing it on a decent sized tv in high definition is a game changer.  Now I love it, and expect I'll watch it a lot.

P.S. I guess the ""voice work"" in this movie isn't really voice work, strictly speaking, since this was filmed live and converted to animation.  So, it's not voices recorded in a studio separately like in traditional animation.  But anyway, the acting is good.",1443052800,,1215,4.394618834080718

1804753,5,B00007AJKI,"I liked it. It was fun and visually unique and although it was kind of talky and way philosophical (what's wrong with that?) overall, I enjoyed watching and seeing what came next! It always presented a new visual snippet that worked with the trippy unity of the film. I love being visually stimulated in movies, and I sat back, watched, and the film did not disappoint.
I'D make a movie using this type of animation, and I understand it's available. I'd like to try it out.
I kind of figured the wall of talk was actually the background, and the visual coolness happening was the key and the takeaway message. All he philosophy was not to be overanalyzed, but presented as a kind of background drone instrument, and then it comes together at the end.

Coincidentally, I have the ""false awakening"" happening frequently in dreams, sometimes to the point of a ""dream, false awakening, dream, another false awakening, dream more"" when I finally do wake up. I guess my brains are kind of weird!  Remember ""Inception""?? I can totally relate.",1429660800,,1035,4.7444444444444445

1804755,4,B00007AJKI,"Personally, I really liked this movie, but I'm quite partial to the subject matter of Lucid Dreaming to begin with. I also really loved the animation technique rendered from film footage. It definitely had the feel of a dream or an acid trip (one that was combined with copious alcohol, I should add) that was quite engaging in a hypnotic sort of way. Several times I found myself watching the effects more than I was listening to the dialog, which is what the movie actually consists almost entirely of. All in all, I recommend this one for anyone interested in lucid dreaming, altered states, alternative consciousness, or just looking for a cool ""trip-aid"".",1429574400,,660,4.849557522123894
1804756,5,B00007AJKI,"Any movie that causes me to think and feel for days afterward is a movie I highly recommend.  Yes, some of the philosophy is a rehash of ideas taught in PHL101 at your high school or community college, but for many people it's their first exposure to these ideas. However, not all of the ideas presented are staples, and for me I found it fascinating to muse about stuff I'd never pondered before.  I'm not a professional philosopher (or amateur, for that matter ); I just took a few classes throughout my academic career back in the day.  For this type of person, a well educated and intelligent mind that's not a philosophe, it is at times a refresher course and at other times a treasure trove of new ideas or modifications on old ones.  I'm not a big fan of this animation style as a rule, but for this project it works for some reason. I will admit this is not for everyone - in my experience it's a love or hate proposition with a few people simply unable to ""get"" it. Deep thinkers on the love side, and all others on the hate side, pretty much.  Count me on the love side.",1429488000,,1080,4.2745098039215685

I used to just listen to this movie at work at times and it made the time fly by while being very entertained.

The only con is that this film is very underrated. I didn't come across it while watching its trailer or seeing the poster sponsoring it. I had to really do my research but I'm glad I did.

If you're reading this trying to figure out if this movie is worth the $10, it truly is. Don't even hesitate. I'd buy it twice.",1425945600,,604,3.942622950819672

1804772,5,B00007AJKI,"""Are you a dreamer?""

I watched this movie for the first time 10 years ago. I was at a critical juncture in my life and watching this movie helped both solidify some of my existing thoughts while provoking new and exciting concepts.

Mr. Linklater does a fantastic job presenting a wide range of ideas within a loosely banded plot. The movie is inspiring and encourages the viewer to learn more. Critics seem to  knock the shallowness of the movie. I feel people like that forget where they came from. Everyone starts their journey with a first step. This movie was the single most important step that I took in my youth. It's a movie that I watch once in awhile to wake myself up out of the daily grind.

If you're looking for a strong plot, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a tapas style spread of ideas then you've come to the right place. Don't wallow in the ""shallow"" descriptions that these concepts present but rather use them as springboard into whatever topics click with you.

My number one favorite movie of all time.

Different characters gave interesting perspective about 'life'.  However, I found all the talking to be too intellectual/theoretical.  It was full of big jargons and lack the grounded, authentic discovery of self and life.

It was boring for me and my friend to watch the entire film - and between the two of us, we had a ph.d and a master degree, and we have been to various personal development courses.  For us, it was a display of philosophical exercises.  The film failed in its ultimate goal of awakening something deeply within.",1419984000,,701,4.88135593220339

It is a tour de force, a full-length feature film done with digital rotoscope animation. One of its distinctive features is that it was created by numerous animators, making a sort of cubist collage of styles and viewpoints. It has won awards from the National Society of Film Critics , the New York Film Critics Circle , and  the Venice Film Festival.

Dick's books, better to take in a small amount at a time and sit and cogitate on each small bite before proceeding further.  Like Dick's books, this has to do with issues of philosophy and searching for meaning, the nature of existence, the possibility of illusion, and detachment from reality.

1804817,5,B00007AJKI,"This film was totally unique when it was released in 2001 and is still far out there.  It is done in rotoscope, a process in which film is traced over to produce a cartoon, except that this started with video and the computer software was used to do the tracing: the technique was used in a number of ads after the film was released.  We get brief glimpses of Linklater regulars -- Julie Delpy (Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight), Ethan Hawke (Before etc., Boyhood), his daughter Lorelei (Boyhood), and Linklater himself.  Mostly we get a stream of philosophy, rants, and efforts to distinguish between sleeping, waking and death.  The music contributes to the edgy feel.  It was written by Glover Gill and played by him and his Tosca Tango Orchestra, who also show up in film rehearsing and playing.

I found that it expressed several abstract trains of thought that I have often had myself and portrayed them in a way that I could have never fully described in words,  images, or through any other medium I have ever used to express my thoughts. I loved the film so much that immediately after watching it, I had to find a copy of it on dvd to add it to my collection of favorite movies.

OCTOBER 2001 WAS, if nothing else, a Cinephile's dream: not one, but TWO (I lived in Chicago, at the time) films by Respected Auteur Richard Linklater[*].  Having paid to see the film in its initial run twice[**], I benefited not just from being better able to catch animation-""style"" shifts (which, at first viewing, are so seamlessly intertwined with lighting choices you don't even notice it until the movie's nearly over) with greater appreciation and attention to subtlety the second time but, as it happens, was able to reinforce my initial viewing as an ""experience"": The vibration of film/light/sound imprinted on me as far from rote as memory-impressioning can get, and as close to the joyful child-in-me's memorizations of nursery rhymes as I've been able to achieve, bar none[***] since then.

Imagine that!

The cornucopia of ideas (or is it ""smorgasboard""?) one samples, via proxy listener (played by Wiley Wiggins) ranges from the usual, per Linklater, sublime (""You haven't met yourself yet"") to the mundane (""Look, if you're going to heat your burrito in the microwave, take it out of the wrapper, because if you don't, it explodes, and I'm tired of cleaning up all-ya'all's burrito doings!""

If the competing ideologies don't conflict, they DO seem to serve their purpose, for a time, only to be replaced: a daunting prospect, to be sure, to confront in Real Life, where we'd expect our orientative systems to hold -- and thus, often end up clinging to them, as if for Dear Life -- but handily dealable-with, in Reel Life, if presented with enough verve, precision, musicality, and equal parts seriousness.

The Irony is: the dialoguing in this Joyful Film cuts much closer to ""the bone"" than the Ponderous Prose one most-oft encounters in the Shadows of the Terrified (and/or Duly Wary) ... as the Man said, ""Why so serious?""

The fluctuation-of-influences the young lad comes in contact with mirror not our own world, but, fittingly, the World that belongs to those who Make Theirs: not unlike Linklater (who, being the Director, saves the last-and-best monologue for himself: watch for the ""since it's dead woman's puke, it's, like, you know, DOUBLY foul?"" distinction near the end of it![****]) and his beloved Austin (the portrait of which, ""Slacker,"" serves as a ""preliminary draft"" for this one, save the characters' backstories and dramatically-critical perspective, here replaced with the ""essence"" of those real-life interstices in an ""extrapolative zone"" of non-physical-plane-bound interactions ... right?), the Work it takes to have the Problems worth encountering is, of course its own (perpetual) End.

1804875,5,B00007AJKI,"By far my second favorite from Linklater. In my review for Slacker, I described it as a film defining life itself. This film is very similar to Slacker excepts it focuses on one theme, and that is how life can be a dream. The rotoscope animation really does visual wonders for a very unsettling, yet vibrant picture as this. It's a film some would appreciate if you have the meaning of life on your mind. One thing I've noticed about this film is how uncomfortable it can feel. The character that Wiley Wiggins plays is probably himself. Very mellow and troubled. You'll find others who feel the need to skip the world because they all are going to die anyway. So, if your in the mood for a jazzy, unexpected, and thought provoking film, Richard Linklater's Waking Life is for you.

If enough people wake up in time, by 2016 we can collapse the remnants of the 2 party duopoly that has almost destroyed this nation (with our blessings, it should be noted; we voted for the hell we elected!). I'd prefer to see an independent coalition of progressives and libertarians agreeing to dramatically downsize the fedgov and then taking the gloves off to decide how much socialism to impose on a state by state basis. This movie can help fertilize the national zeitgeist.

If we can't rally enough people for that dream, I'll be more than happy if Rand Paul drags the GOP back into the realm of respectability (he has to continue to back off on gay marriage and abortion to do that; he's already got foreign policy nailed down).

We actually only made it through the first 45 minutes or so; by that point it became clear that there wasn't going to be any payoff.

Bottom line: this is the cinematic equivalent of The Emperor's New Clothes; I can imagine all the Smart People pointing out how much they're seeing until a young boy shouts out ""The Emperor is naked!"", after which they all admit that there's really nothing there at all.

As we've grown together into our fourth decade of marriage we still spend hours and hours each week talking together to evaluate, analyze, and reconstruct our thoughts, experiences, and nightly dreams.  Watching ""Waking Life"" together was like injecting an amphetamine into our conversation about recent experiences and their influence on personal growth.  It literally took us about five hours to watch the movie because we kept hitting the remote's pause button to share our insights with each other.  The movie gave us new avenues to approach our experiences, both recent and long familiar.  The movie actually enabled us both to experience what we've come to call a ""red letter"" calendar day, those rare days that have the potential to shift the direction of our personal expression.

We've not been able to put the movie away on the shelf since watching it.  Letting it sit on the coffee table in the family room is a constant reminder of the insights we experienced.

I love it enough that I've shown it to a lot of my friends. Many, I might even say a majority, just couldn't get into it. It moves slowly at times, and it has very little in the way of a linear plot progression. It's more like a constellation that gradually forms one star at a time, and even the final result is open to interpretation. If you feel like exploring unknown mental territory, and don't have a particular need to conclude your wanderings with a sense of defined achievement or arrival, this is your flick.

If you're generally impatient with philosophical ramblings and find yourself often wishing some people would grow up, get a stable job, and become productive members of society, you won't make it through this film. The entire thing is an oddyssey where the steps - forward, back and sideways, at times - are the only destination. I'm not saying that a goal-oriented professional can't enjoy the mindset of this film, because I'm one myself, but you have to be interested in shutting off that side of yourself to an extent, which is what I like to do for at least some of the time when I'm not working.

1804966,5,B00007AJKI,"OK WE'VE RECEIVED THE WAKE - UP CALL!!

This film begins with a boy and a girl who wake up to the reality that the city they have been spending their short time in , is really a construction nightmare.
To fix the problem , the boy decides to grow up and be a good listener. This proves to be the wisest decision he has ever made in his whole life , and as a result he gets drawn to tons of listeners and people who speak to him directly. The film is a direct attempt to implement a serious attack against the State , and in where the advancement of the consciousness shift is predicted. The film is not an attack against the State which has been set up in a manner which is easily noticeable by the authorities , or perhaps even the producers themselves. The listeners decide to rebel against the screaming silence that they have subjected themselves to , resulting in a heightened sense of self - awareness which results in serious discussions on the nature and meaning of awareness. Attempts are made to answer as many philosophical questions as possible. The result becomes one of the most celebrated animes of all time , because the anime reaches to people of all ages and every amount of individuality available. The film deals thus with the consciousness shift in where little emphasis is put on the role of construction corporations and the consequences of the abuse they have become responsible for on a mental , emotional and physical level. The film emphasizes the concept of the importance of being a good listener. The problem in this world is that people refuse to actually listen to each other. As a result , society has evolved into a construction nightmare.
Alex Jones cries out that he wants freedom - but he has sacrificed himself to the powers that he says he is rebelling against , and thus has evolved into a corporate slave who represents everything he says he has opposed. And hence all kinds of people known and unknown are studied in the film.
Finally the grown up man discovers that he has in fact died , and that he died because a meteor crashed on the city where he had been alive , or that maybe he didn't die but entered an alternative universe where he has more control. Note that Alex Jones is alone in his car , the people are simply too smart and awake and aware to be treated like sheep so he has no audience. He represents the one who doesn't want to be a listener but who thinks he is. The main character , the listener , gets drawn to all the other listeners , and everything changes around them. Suddenly they realize it is in their hands to make decisions on how to change the form or structure of the city they had been spending their lives so much in. Thus the film actually predicts that the consciousness shift which will start in 2009 will start by the collapsing of Alex Jones'reputation as a documentary maker , and will then gradually evolve , first by means of entering a stage of acceleration , later it becomes sudden as the film advances. Now everyone is talking about it , and as a result , the construction corporations have lost their power. Now it is up to the inhabitants of the city to decide how they want to change it , beginning with the prisons. Do they want the city to continue to be a prison or not? They decide to conclude that the city doesn't have to be a gulag or a prison and move on.
In this film , existentialism and other branches of philosophy journey together to create a bigger picture than the one we had gotten used to since 1999.",1264377600,,3508,4.38863287250384

""What the hell is this guy talking about?"" I thought that exact phrase about 15 times throughout this movie. Combine very abstract visual animations of live action video with very existential and philosophical monologues and dialogues and you have Waking Life. You will probably need to see it at least twice to fully absorb everything.
There is a very loose story. Willy Wiggins is getting lectures from or talking with various people about the nature of reality and the meaning of life, and the whole thing is animated. There isn't really a beginning, middle, or end, just a series of conversations or monologues. At times it feels like a really weird, artsy documentary.
Even though some of the scenes are ostensibly conversations, the characters don't talk normally, the way you or I would. The all feel very scripted, and to me the bizarre animations are covering up what is probably some very bad acting, or at least unconvincingly delivered lines of philosophical dialogue.
If you like artsy movies or want your mind blown off the chart, then this movie is probably for you. After a few scenes of re-defining the nature of reality, I found myself desensitized to what the characters were trying to say. You aren't really given time to digest the significance of each character's point of view before you're thrust with another, and I didn't feel that the artsy animation style really added anything to what the characters said. More often than not I found it unnecessary or even distracting.

Final Score: 6/10",1254614400,,1682,5.068592057761733
1804970,4,B00007AJKI,"Where to start with this one? First of all, it's visually impressive (though not absolutely mind-blowing as some have said...if you've seen a lot of animation, you've probably seen plenty of stuff this inventive), making some of the best use of rotoscoping (animated tracing over live-action figures, with animated backgrounds) that I've seen in a feature; it's got a fairly ambitious intellectual conceit (a man who may or may not be on the verge of death throughout the film dreams in a lucid way about what the nature of reality, consciousness, free will, etc really are); it's got great music (by Glover Gill)...what more could you want? Well, for starters, it works out to be not much more than philosophical ramblings, and I think to some extent it wears out its welcome. Now, if you knew me you'd know I often like long movies...I have no problem with a lot of work that a lot of people call ""slow""; but this was to me too much of the same thing. And some of the observations are facile in a druggy-stoner way that just made me think, who cares?  Like pothead versions of Seinfeld and company, frankly.

Still, adding it up, I'm thinking about it quite a lot since I first watched the excellent, feature-packed DVD a couple of years ago. Another aspect I really liked was the self-referentiality: the film as a whole is very reminiscent of the director's first feature, SLACKER; it contains a short scene with Jesse and Celine, the characters from the previous BEFORE SUNRISE that also obviously looks forward to the sequel to that film, BEFORE SUNSET; the technique used and some of the more fantastic imagery seems now a tryout for the director's later rotoscoped Philip K Dick adaptation, A SCANNER DARKLY; and both Linklater and his good friend (and fellow experimental-at-times filmmaker) Steven Soderbergh make appearances. And there's a scene or two late in the film that is reminiscent of the work of another extremely self-referential artist, the experimental American SF writer Samuel R. Delany (specificially, his 1000-page, Joycean ""Dhalgren"").

I need to see it again; reading some pretty intelligent reviews this afternoon leads me to believe that a deeper reading would be more rewarding. Despite many reservations, I'm giving it high marks simply for attempting subject matter and film techniques that nobody else in America seems interested in. Linklater has proved himself a great disciple of European art cinema, not just the usual Scorsese-Coppola-DePalma stuff, and that's all to the good.",1253836800,,2517,5.016746411483253

1804972,5,B00007AJKI,"It must be a mark of how far out of the loop I am these days that I didn't hear about this film until now. On the other hand, like the main character, it seemed in a strange way to echo my own speculations on so many things. Perhaps that isn't so strange, for as one of the dream conversations points out, we are all interconnected at some level- that is why new ideas seem to pop up in many places at the same time and are soon mastered by the many. That is no doubt why this film popped up. I kept saying to myself  I've been here before, I've been here before...

So many ideas are covered here from the nature of dreams, the nature of modern life, the nature of death, the nature of existence. The metaphysical ideas of PKD are even touched upon. Projects this intelligent usually do not get made since so few will really get it. But then, perhaps that it was made heralds a universal shift in consciousness.

Some people will automatically reject this film as a sophomoric bull session. Those are the people with no curiosity about the underlying nature of reality.

1804974,5,B00007AJKI,"Existentialism: A college professor claims that far from being a philosophy of despair (Sartre claims never to have felt despair), existentialism is a philosphy of ""exuberance,"" hope, and possibility.
The professor considers but refutes postmodern claims that we are socially constructed, and re-emphasizes existential claims that we are our own authors.

Language: A college aged blonde woman discusses language theory. She contemplates how much of our experience is abstract and ineffable, but also stresses how we live for the moments when true communication takes place and we feel understood. This she compares to spiritual communion.

Evolutionary Psychology: An ev. psychologist considers the telescoping (accelerated) nature of human evolution. He argues that evolution is accelerating at such a rate that soon we will be able to detect evolutionary alterations even in our own lifetimes.  So far evolution has been governed by the survival of species, but, he argues, we are about to enter a new phase of evolution whereby individuals will evolve according to inner desires...

Alienation: An alienated rebel suggests that humans not only desire chaos (including catastrophes) but that they need it. But he also argues that the media intentionally makes us feel small and powerless. As a means of protest, he sets himself ablaze.

Collective Memory/Consciousness: Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy discuss the possibility that we are all able to access not just our own individual memories but also the memories of the human species. Delpy says she often feels like she is an old woman looking back on her life, and Hawke suggests that we are all somehow connected to the same consciousness (and that this explains why humans on all points of the globe often stumble upon the same ideas at the same time).

Free Will: A scientist discusses the history of the determinism v. free will argument. Governed by his own field of expertise he attempts to explain everything according to unbending physical laws, yet, despite his training and deliberations, he is unwilling to give up the idea of free will...

Systems of Control: A man with speakers on the roof of his car drives through the city streets warning the public that we are all members of a ""corporate slave state,"" and he urges us not to surrender to the mass dehumanization that he sees being perpetrated by corporations and politicians (which he sees as corporate puppets). He argues that they all want to make us feel small so that we won't resist, but that we must resist in order to assert our creative humanity.

Attitude: An older professor argues that we must struggle to liberate ourselves from the negative: ""Say yes to one instant, and you say yes to life.""

Liminal Experiences: Meaning ""inbetween""  states or experiences that challenge existing accounts/defintions of experience, identity, reality. An ethnic writer argues that these liminal experiences that challenge the norm are in fact becoming the norm. And, he goes on to argue that we are all becoming part of a greater subjectivity (or radical subjectivity) that recognizes no set boundaries.

Time/Identity: A middle-aged pair of friends discuss their lives and how they felt that the uncertainty of youth would one day vanish into the certainty of age. But neither has found that to be the case. Both feel that curiosity makes humans undergo constant changes and that this process lasts ones entire lifetime.

Doubt/Narrative: A monkey shows and narrates a film about how ""doubt"" has become the new generation's narrative and how various cultural rebels search for and find the ""buried possibilities of our time."" The new world, claims the simian, is a negation of the old. And, he adds, ""a new world is just as likely as an old one.""

Self-Imposed Barriers: A guy at a bar compares man to animals, and suggests that the reason more humans do not achieve great things is because of fear and laziness.

Dream Consciousness: A woman on television discusses how we can apprehend things while dreaming that we could never apprehend while awake.

Film: A film enthusiast discusses Bazin's view that film allows us to see that each moment is a ""holy moment."" The friend of the film enthusiast discusses that reality is always layered and that even when we try to have a holy moment we are always aware of ourselves as humans trying to have a holy moment.

Theory/Action: A group of four young would-be radicals discuss ways to liberate the world from its current predicament when they encounter an older man sitting atop a telephone pole. One of the yong radicals asks the older gentleman why he is sitting up there and the old man replies he doesn't know. The young radical thinks for a moment and says to his friends, ""he is all action and no theory, and we are all theory and no action.""

Ants: A theatre student insists that we must not go through life like ants--going through the motions without thinking--, but that we must confront one another and experience one another and ourselves.

A Consistent Perspective: The protaganist who has been witness to all of these monologues and conversations, decides that what he has is a ""consistent perspective."" Meaning that while he considers each persons point of view, and that he benefits from the knowledge/wisdom/fantasies imparted to him, his own perspective sets him apart.

Alienation/Exuberance: A wild haired man on a bridge discusses ""how exciting alienation can be.""

Connection: A middle-aged woman looks at her past and concludes that the most important thing about life is ""connecting with people.""

Last words: While playing pinball, the director discusses a Philip K. Dick story as well of one of his own dreams that involves Lady Gregory and his dead dog, but ultimately decides that all of life can really be reduced to just one question, ""do you want to be one with eternity?""

I, for one, do enjoy these types of discussions of the mind, and found it a fascinating look at the subconscious.  Some of the segments are better than others (my favorite was the biker scene), but they all work into each other and (again, if you are pre-disposed to liking these types of discussions) are very thought-provoking.  This is not something to put on in the background, and it's not really something a group of friends would get together and watch (unless you have a group of deep-thinking, open-minded friends who are not easily ""bored"").  This movie is best enjoyed watching by yourself and really giving thought to the many ideas presented therein.  I am not a person who is easily swayed by the things I watch or see, but this movie really did change how I felt about a few subjects of the mind.",1244073600,,977,4.5227272727272725
1804976,5,B00007AJKI,"As with the best of Linklater's work, the ""plot"" here takes a backseat to the real star of the show, the monologue. As such, we'll dispense with the plot. Notice that this is ""monologue"" not ""dialogue"". Even in scenes which would seem to portray two or more persons engaged in conversation, there isn't so much give and take as there is one person holding forth, then giving way to let the next fellow have a go. In this way, the director has basically built an all-terrain vehicle of soap-box soliloquy and handed the keys over to all manner of ranters and rhapsodists. So who needs plot?
On my most recent viewing of this favorite of mine, I realized that what was being portrayed was a view of the psychic landscape of humanity, much like Joyce famously portrayed the archetypal day of humanity, through a metaphor of The Dream. Pretentious? You bet. But don't let that deter you. Joyce didn't. Neither has Linklater. Recommended.",1243987200,,933,4.730061349693251

1804978,3,B00007AJKI,"""Waking Life"" is probably not like any other film you've seen before: the majority of it consists of philosophical monologues that express different perspectives on the loosely connected ideas which the main character is trying to explore. On the whole, these monologues range from the fascinating to the obnoxiously trite, and even though this film expresses some wonderful concepts, it also manages to present the cliche ideas in a completely serious fashion.

Having said that though, ""Waking Life"" is still a unique cinematic experience worth watching. Even though the plot line has very little continuity, it's the ideas that really matter. In some ways, the main character is almost irrelevant; it's not so much about him discovering these concepts as it is about us discovering them. Unfortunately though, at times the philosophical monologues are thrown at us in such a haphazard manner that we have very little time to absorb, much less intellectualize them. Although many scenes are truly valuable, others are just jarring or distracting (for instance, in one scene a stranger walks past the main character and simply says, ""Kierkegaard's last words were, 'Sweep me up'!"").

On the other hand though, I feel like in a way we are meant to be confused, just as the main character is. The animation technique is certainly a good choice for this effect, and is very well-done. Another very positive aspect of this film is the soundtrack, which is superb. Overall, I think this is a pretty decent film, even if its moments of brilliance are broken up by waves of generic pop philosophy.",1230595200,,1591,5.0456273764258555

This movie is surreal.  It is captured in real life via a hand held camera, then it was sent to six different artists to create their own style of animation over the live action.  The styles are all unique, giving the viewer amazing views of interations between the main character and his many acquaintances in his dream/real(?) world. The animation is the very best visual reprsentation of what I can remember of hallucinations on LSD from 40 years ago.  It's amazing.

He walks through a perpetual dream world, talking with several people, all of which give their own view on the nature of reality and our relation to it.  All to often I felt like I was in a freshman philosophy course in which the professor rambles on about a multitude of different topics, none of which are in enough depth to really get anything out of.  Just because someone talks about deep topics doesn't make the conversation deep.

After a very long middle section and several too many lectures, the movie actually gets somewhere as the protagonist starts to understand his dilemma and tried to wake up.  Unfortunately, while the ending does make everything come full circle, it is also glaringly obvious.

A good point is the animation, giving an interesting new surreal landscape with every scene.  At least that was well done, just would have been nice if it was more than a meandering sophomoric attempt at real understanding of some very complicated issues.",1211241600,,1122,4.873684210526315

To say the least, I was disappointed.

This is a self-indulgent journey into the mind of a self-important writer who fancies himself in the same league as Aristotle by asking questions that might as well be, ""Is that a reflection of myself in the mirror, or is the real world going on inside the mirror and I'm merely the reflection?""

Philosphy for 3rd graders, I suppose.

This is absurdity at its most inflated and self-aggrandizing. The method of animating live-action film is the only innovative feature here, and it's really rather pointless, unless you buy into what the makers are selling, in which case it you would consider it pure genius, i'm sure.

1804994,4,B00007AJKI,"Waking, I mean?

This spectacular animation leaves me with two conflicting impressions. The first is that it's among the most innovative animations I've ever seen. The technique looks like non-photorealistic renderings of actual films, as was also done in ""A Scanner Darkly."" The graphic style works well and consistently, but it's the background objects that give this film its dreamlike quality: the feeling that nothing is solid, nothing can be trusted. Sofas don't sit stolidly in the living room. Instead, they bob like corks in a creek, even with someone sitting on them. A driveway doesn't sit quietly where it's told; it encroaches on the lawn, then retreats, while nervous shrubs patrol the narrow perimeters of their assigned places. Only the people seem solid and fixed.

At least, until they talk. Internally, they wobble hollowly, a psychic echo of the insubstantial world around them. Only the protagonist seems real, a seeker for something he can't even name.

Although it appears to present philosophical depth, the depth is only a veneer of breathless, rambling exposition. What is real? What is a dream? How can you tell? It reminds me of sophomore year, but without the alcohol.

That takes nothing away from its visual importance. Even if the actual words spoken as philosophical diatribes don't amount to much, the protagonist's trek through a mundane but unstable urban landscape carries an emotional truth. It's the sense of only oneself as real, in a world so unreliable that even stone can't be trusted to be solid.

1804999,4,B00007AJKI,"If you enjoy hearing folks wax philosophical and don't mind spacey visuals, you may enjoy this film. Here is a sample from Robert Solomon:

""The reason why I refuse to take existentialism as just another French fashion or historical curiosity is that I think it has something very important to offer us for the new century. I'm afraid we're losing the real virtues of living life passionately, in the sense of taking responsibility for who you are, the ability to make something of yourself, and feeling good about life. Existentialism is often discussed as if it's a philosophy of despair. But I think the truth is just the opposite. Sartre, once interviewed, said he never really felt a day of despair in his life. But one thing that comes out from reading these guys is not a sense of anguish about life so much as a real kind of exuberance, of feeling on top of it. Its like: your life is yours to create.

""I've read the postmodernists with some interest, even admiration. But when I read them I always have this awful nagging feeling that something absolutely essential is getting left out. The more that you talk about a person as a social construction or as a confluence of forces or as fragmented or marginalized, what you do is you open up a whole new world of excuses. And when Sartre talks about responsibility he's not talking about something abstract. He's not talking about the kind of self or soul that theologians would argue about. It's something very concrete. It's you and me talking, making decisions, doing things, and taking the consequences.

""It might be true that there are six billion people in the world and counting, nevertheless, what you do makes a difference. It makes a difference first of all in material terms. It makes a difference to other people. And it sets an example. And in short I think the message here is that we should never simply write ourselves off and see ourselves as the victim of various forces. It's always _our_ decision who we are.""",1185062400,,1988,4.674285714285714
1805000,1,B00007AJKI,"Robert Solomon has a very small part in this film and it wasn't enough to save the movie.  Check out any of his books or teachings in The Teaching Company (TTC) series.  He is one of the greatest teachers of existentialism.  But this movie is based around one question... What is reality?  Instead of leaving me with questions of What is it to exist?  I was left with the questions, ""why did I watch this movie"" ""did I expect it to get better?""  ""how did it get worse"", and ""how did anyone get anything deeper out of this movie than ""Space Balls?""

This movie seems to me like a high school philosophy project based off of the movie ""Open Your Eyes,"" or the americanized version (just as good) ""Vanilla Sky."" (except I don't remember if you get to see Penelope Cruz naked in Vanilla Sky;)

Honestly... if you want to watch a movie about philosophy or that will at least leave you with existential or profound questions/answers, please check out the following:  What the Bleep, Big Fish, Adaptation, Fight Club, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (which is drenched with Sartre) Dark City, or as I just suggested, Open Your Eyes.  As far as other philosophies... Moralism/Responsibility, check out: The Cider House Rules or Babel. For Futurism/Postmodernity: Brazil, 12 Monkeys or Children of Men.

The ideas put forth are interesting and necessary, but the film overall is very ponderous, talky (almost all of Linklater's films are talky), pseudo-intellectual (like his generation, Gen X), and kind of boring in spots.  The conversations veer from passable to banal, and the rotoscoping, while interesting, isn't really groundbreaking.  Rotoscoping has been done for quite some time, but it looks better than it used to, because of digital technology.  The film is average.

There is much philosophy and much yak-yak-yak.  It's an interesting mix.  With its focus on conversation, the film brought to mind another classic, ""My Dinner with Andre,"" and some of the philosophy it contains brought to mind ""The Matrix,"" but beyond that, ""Waking Life"" stands completely on its own.

1805012,5,B00007AJKI,"This film, Linklater's ""The Waking Life,"" very much falls in the vein of some of the following:  Pink Floyd's The Wall, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Winged Migration, Radiohead, Ray Bradbury, Phillip Dick, Rush and a college philosophy class.  If you are confused...don't be.  Let me explain.

There is a quote from the movie that kind of captured what I thought about the film.  The main character, played by Wiley Wiggins from Linklater's ""Dazed and Confused,"" some time in the film is talking about this dream that he is experiencing (and we are spectators of) and says something to the effect of, ""This dream is wholly unprecedented.  It's trying to do something monumental...a fundamental life change.""  I realize that quote is severely paraphrased but it kind of sums up my feelings about the movie.  It really came across to me as unprecedented and very original.

Let me give you a disclaimer, this film is not going to be for everybody...in fact it's probably not going to be for most.  It's one that appeals to my taste.  I know my wife dismissed it after the first 5 minutes...as being ohhh...another one of those films that only my husband likes.  You may feel the dialogue is slow and overly intellectualized.  The overlay of animation on top of real-life shot film may not be your cup of tea, may not be your bag baby.  But...though the film is very non-traditional with one character that basically walks around encountering all sorts of other characters for brief periods each having a speaking role about the meaning of life, the meaning of dreams, philosophy and exploding burritos, the film is not without a plot, not without characters, not without humor.  You end up very much caring about what is going to happen to the main character as he alternately enjoys being in a dream-trance like state, and is horrified and frustrated at not being able to come out of it, to move on to the waking life.

Ultimately, the movie was fascinating and where the ongoing dialogue didn't hold your attention, you have the wonderful artwork of animation to behold and wonder at.  Just like a fascinating college lecture, you don't stay engaged listening for the full 50 minutes, but what does connect, connects in a powerful way.

If you like traditional movies and you like more linear plots, I'd say stay away from this one.  But if you, like me, get into ""deep thoughts"" and enjoy seeing creativity in a unique and original way, you absolutely will not want to miss waking up to ""The Waking Life.""

I ordered it on an impulse and it has proven worthy of the purchase price. The film seems to jump around randomly and the topics presented are just as random. I found many of the topics far removed from my own interests, but just enough of them hit me with great impact. In certain ways it will remind you of ""What The Bleep""  As far as enjoying the animation, I can't say I love it. A great quality of this DVD is that you can play it and just listen to it and it still delivers. I think anyone who takes time to watch this film will find at least one thing to truly challenge their thinking. I am thankful for the scene selection menu so I can jump to my favorite chapters. I stop short of five stars because the menu seems to take a long time to generate and each jump from chapter to chapter takes a considerable pause of music playing and repeated graphics popping up before you can actually select.

1805016,5,B00007AJKI,"Waking Life is perhaps one of the most amazing ""not-films"" I've ever watched. Don't be decieved by the DVD box suggesting that it's a movie. It's a motion picture as art. This film lacks everything a film should have: story, characters, plot, conflict, climax, everything. Then why do I give it five stars? Because it's not about the story, it's about the experience. It's not about the characters, it's about the ideas expressed by the people on the screen. It's not about the plot, it's about being totally mesmerised by the innovative rotoscopy animation. The film is a 100 minute acid trip and you don't get any of the harmful side effects that real LSD poses. Simply just a prolonged disconnection from the world as we know it allowing us to escape from all of the pressures of everyday existence and just be and think and live as a worryless lump of matter for a short while. The worst part about the movie is that if you start watching, it reaches a point that it is over.

Director, Richard Linklater, takes us through a montage of of discussions from people on the screen about scores of philosophical, metaphysical and anthropoligical issues: existentialism, evolution, free will, language, dreams, death, life, reincarnation, pessimism, and so much more. This is not a traditional film. Throughout the whole run of the piece we are simply assaulted with philosophical monologue that may be boring or intellectually stimulating, pretentious or profound, tiresome or envigorating. Either way, I feel that it is a great way to just feel so disconnected and freed from the world for a little while. Among other elements of the film, the rotoscopy animation and the enchanting soundtrack by Tosca Tango Orchestra aids in this effect of disconnection, almost making the viewer feel like he or she is floating. It's important to understand the context of this film. It was released just after 9/11, when everyone needed a break from reality for a little while. Some may feel that presently we are all in need of a break from reality. Whatever the case may be, this is a film that may not be easily recieved by all people of all times. I gave this movie five stars. Covering every point that I just covered, I just as easily could have given it one.

Besides that I found the score for the movie just boring, and didn't strike any emotion in me at all. The animation used on top of the actual picture, I thought, was a billiant thing, to make more of a dream. But unfortunately that too can be a tad bit annoying.

1805027,4,B00007AJKI,"""Waking Life"", a film written and directed by Richard Linklater, is a unique animation with plenty of interesting characters and plenty to think about. Maybe a little too much, actually...

The plot kind of flows in and out of the film. Basically, a young man (voiced by Wiley Wiggins) finds himself encountering a lot of interesting people, who have stories, philosophies and points of view to share - everything from destiny to dreams to free will to time to politics. It's all very interesting, and the young man is very absorbed in what they are saying, but something doesn't seem quite right about it all. He can't read his clock, for instance. He's wearing a watch that he hasn't had since fourth grade. Lights don't work when he flicks them. Could he be in a dream? If he is, what is the nature of this dream? What is its purpose? Where is it taking him? Most importantly, can he wake from it?

The animation is hard to describe, which is a compliment really. In terms of motion, very often its realistic. As for shape, perspective, colors, facial experessions and such, you're only really shown a vague impression of what's there. There's also a bit of weirdness thrown in for good measure too (if someone is talking about something, for instance, the image of that something might float off in the background).

I have mixed feelings about the dialogue.

One good thing about it is that it feels real at times, I guess, not like a script. There's a lot of interesting concepts in the conversations, and its interesting to find that some people have thought the same things I have.

Yeah, there's a lot to consider, if you can make it through all the pretentiousness. It was conversations and pretense like this that put me off going to do arts at a college. I could not live in an environment where people talk like this, and pursue such silly things under the guise of signficance. It all can be said and felt so much simpler, honestly. I mean, I can appreciate the personalities of the characters in this film. The Irish-American guy who goes on about neo-humans and the new paradigm of evolution, for instance. For all his big words and ""significant"" ideas, all he really wants is a world where people can be themselves. When he gets to that point, he uses the simplest phrase to describe how he feels about it: ""it would be nice"". Perhaps that's why he was drawn to the ideas he was discussing, maybe he could figure out a way that people can be themselves if he could create a way in his head. Perhaps the teachings he was brought up with were supposed to work, but didn't do it for him, so he got caught up trying to make things right mentally. If Richard Linklater had been trying to push point like that across, that people conjure up complex ideas to fill simple needs, I would have given the film five stars. The trouble is, he doesnt say that at all, he tries to make the film really significant, and to quote one of the characters: ""heavy"". Linklater probably acknowledges that there is some truth, if not agrees with, everything said in the film, as the points made throughout the dialogue appear as themes throughout the film. I reckon Linklatr believes these ideas really do apply to life, to ""Waking Life"" anyway.

It's almost like an intellectual narcissim, these characters are so caught up in their ideas, tangled up in their own heads. They go on and on and on, like it's a great, significant revelation, like everyone should listen, like everyone should be heading in the direction they are in life. Reminds me of some friends, actually. I know a few mentally ill people and most of them are mighty, mighty perceptive philosophers. It kind of makes you wonder where the hardcore thinker stops and the delusional thinker begins. Too much learning makes you sick, like old King Solomon of Israel used to say, that's what I reckon.

There's a couple of ""shocking"" moments which I thought were in a bit of bad taste. A guy, yearning to be heard by the world, pours petrol all over himself, asks Wiley Wiggins' character for a match, then sets himself on fire, for instance. The music, however was in better taste. Kind of reminded me of the way George Martin set up the string section for Beatles songs in terms of production (think Eleanor Rigby), bit artier arrangements than Martin would do though.

For a little bit I dabbled in lucid dreaming, which is discussed a little in this film. My experience is a little different from the one in this film. It's true you don't have much control with light switches, but rather than staying all on or all off, I found they'd turn on, but then kind of dim a bit, like something was sapping the power somewhere else. Also, when I did actually have control of my dreams, the stuff I wanted to do just whizzed by so fast, rather than happening normally. I remember I wanted to change the color of my skin, and I went through every color I could remember in what I perceived to be seconds, the speed probably coming from the simple fact that I could make it go that fast, hyper curiousity maybe. I was really disappointed with the experience and stopped doing it. Just as well, it isn't good to muck round with that sort of thing at all.

It's definitely an interesting and creative film though, and if you can handle the thick dialogue it's worth a look.",1154131200,,5322,4.564397905759162
1805028,5,B00007AJKI,"Waking Life is the animated film by Richard Linklater, the talented writer and director.  I had heard so much about it before, but just recently had the opportunity to see it myself.  The acclaim for the film wasn't unwarranted.

The movie's main character fades in and out of dreams and ""waking life,"" rarely being aware of weather or not he's awake or sleeping and in the end I'm not sure if it really matters.  Adding to the dreamy theme of the movie is the beautiful, hazy animation which drip-drops and flows from scene to scene giving the audience a light, floating feeling like we're experiencing the surreal dream world as well.

Along the way the main character (I'm not sure if he's ever named) encounters a myriad of interesting characters espousing various philosophies, religions, ideas and theories.  The main character is seeking answers to whether or not he's dreaming, awake or even dead and each of the people he meets give him some insight, however vague it might be.

Linklater himself makes an appearance at the end of the film and his speech on sci-fi author Philip K. Dick and the role of dreams in his novel, Flow My Tears, the Policeman Cried.  Linklater's retelling of Dick's story captures much of the film's message...I'll leave it to you to see for yourself and draw your own conclusions from Linklater's masterspiece, Waking Life.",1152489600,,1360,4.831896551724138

1805038,5,B00007AJKI,"I've read a lot of the reviews here and I've found that most are either glowing praise or a stiff kick to the teeth.

I'm more on the ""glowing praise"" side of the fence because if you can deal with the dizzying animation, maybe it'll get you thinking about something you haven't really thought about before.  If that happens, you've discovered something better than 99% of the existing films and tv.

For some reason, a lot of the negative reviewers seem to forget that fact.

What's interesting to me is that the vast majority of the really negative reviews accuse Linklater of being pompous and psuedo-enlightened or what have you while simultaneously spewing their own philosophical elitism AND avoiding the arduous task of recommending a better alternative.

That's kind of like someone abnoxiously telling me how qualified they are to tell me how bad my Pepsi tastes without telling me where to find a Coke....or RC.

1805039,3,B00007AJKI,"This film reminded me to obey an important maxim: you should not write a review of a film that you have only watched the first fifteen minutes of, unless, of course, the film is fifteen minutes long. And this film is much longer than fifteen minutes--much longer. Like other reviewers here, within the first minutes, I started writing a review in my head because I immediately disliked this film--didn't hate it (after all, it did occassionally have some interesting animation)--but was aesthetically repulsed by it's monotone cerebral rambling. It's like the mouth of some really boring philosophy PhD. is a baton that is passed from one ""animated"" character to the next, and as soon as the mouth  of the new character opens, the same in-session bookish dissertation is continued unabated, dull character to dull--well, at best, semi-dull characters.

In my disgruntled state early on while watching this film, my armchair movie critic hat came on right away, and I immediately started to compare it to ""My Dinner with Andre""--that wonderfully successful filmed philosophical conversation which, at the same time, also contained so much passion and humanity--qualities which the ""Waking Life"" is mostly devoid of. ""Andre"" was a story weighted with strong characters, with a beginning and a middle and an end, with rising action, humorous diversions, pathos, love, fear, a climax, and great moments of human-tethered insight and inspiration, all within a simple dinner conversation. It was a tour de force of philosophical musing by two very human characters grappling with great ideas within the confines of their own disappointments and highest aspirations. ""Waking Life,"" on the other hand, is suspended effluvia--some well-wrought ideas salvaged from the philosophical literature that ride in the airy upper recesses of the scholarly cerebrum.  These are characters who move through their world with their bodies doing a lot of walking and gesturing, but with their minds carried around on a neverending, and very verbose, speculation meathook. My eyes glazed, my hearing stopped--it's like when some sophmore aquaintance sits down at lunch with you and is spitting out some grandeloquent diatribe that got stimulated by a class, or a paper, or an episode of Star Trek. He's throwing things out with some newly unfettered verbal confidence and a newfound intellectual bicep, tossing in quotes from Kant and Satre and Kierkegaard, in one long heady monologue, and you've stopped trying to follow his train of thought as you sit there, arms crossed, smiling patronizingly. And while he wildly articulates his grand ideas, you are desperately calculating when and how to excuse yourself from this benedicto elucidatum.

This film's dream also stimulated a comparison in my mind to that famous case in the psychological literature of the man who lived with a metal spike that had accidentally gone through his brain, and parts of his consciousness became thereby separated.  This movie's dream would be that man's lucid left brain dream, with all his intellectual, rational left brain synapses firing but butting up against the spike and falling back in upon themselves only on the rational left side, never intercoursing with the right side of the brain--the side of the soul and the emotions and the personality. This dream is populated with a few latent remnants of the right side--the templates of character and storyline, but templates now only infused with content from the left ganglia. Spock might have liked this dream. It was an alien dream to me. I don't know the dream in this movie.  I know dreams about being chased, about realizing I've gone to class naked, about falling but not hitting the ground, and about unfinished passion with Uma Thurman. The dream in this movie is like some dis-sensational librarian's purgatory.

Well, patience is a virtue, they say, and this is a film for the virtuous.  It gets someplace, but it takes a long time getting there, and in the long getting-there, it acquires a certain pace, a certain timing. You don't even really need to listen closely to what the expounders are saying, you just need to catch their rythm, because it's the rythm of the film that goes to the higher place, and when it finally arrives at some very entertaining heights, at that point, you will really listen and catch a few mind expanders. In the end, the getting there may be worth it. My advice is to not try too hard to follow all the philosophizing.  You'll eventually lock on later in the movie, or maybe, just at the end, which is all you really need. Then after finishing it once,  you might be inclined to  review the film and lock in better with what's being said during second and third viewings.

It's not the great philosophical, experiential film that ""My Dinner with Andre"" is--which you must see if you haven't (and actually, you don't even have to watch ""Andre,"" you can with equal enjoyment, just listen to it--which is another very telling contrast between these two very different, but goal-similar films). ""Waking Life"" is what it is--something different, something attempted--and it's well enough to just allow it to be what it is and enjoy it despite the pain of first encounter. Whereas ""Andre"" is the chuckle and the ""OM"" of the wisened guru, ""Waking Life"" is the clever new mantra of the cute new priest--a new song which is rewarded by the guru with a wide loving smile and the enlightened affirmation, ""not that, not that.""",1134864000,,5476,5.025358324145535

It seems as if a college student, on a tirade induced by schwag and a survey of philosophy course, decided to take a sub-mediocre film and ""radically"" alter its perspective by digitally filtering it. Much like a mental masturbation done with photoshop, it felt overwhelmingly devoid of meaning, and uninspiringly digital-neo-baroque. There is little content in this film of any value (though it could have potentially been an interesting intro to western thought cartoon demonstration), and even the ""innovative"" visual aspect is little more than a poor, uninteresting home video disguised as something greater than it really is.

I would save money by not renting or buying this film, acquiring some mind-altering controlled substance (not sleeping for three days will do), and roam around a college town having quasi-philosophical discussions with going-nowhere hipsters who love to hear themselves talk and take themselves very seriously.

However, this sort of philosophical smorgasboard would be better experienced on paper, as the film doesn't really allow ample time to for these discussions to be absorbed by the viewer, especially if the viewer is not experienced in the philosophical thought process.

The visuals are stunning, but can hinder one somewhat from fully understanding the ideas before the film moves on to the next idea. I found it very frustrating to try to fully comprehend certain ideas presented, only to be bombarded with even more equally intense dialogue and visuals.

The ideas presented are certainly fascinating, and are framed with some of the most beautiful visuals I've ever seen in a film, but the combination of the two can be quite overwhelming.

1805059,4,B00007AJKI,"I have been teaching a Basic Design class for over 5 years and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has been a part of my curriculum to the present.  Why am I mentioning this Disney classic?  Because there are correlations between Waking Life and the infamous, ""Sleeping Death"" in Snow White, missed by most if not all of these reviews.

I think everyone is anxious about the issues concerning death through faith and philosophy and they miss some crucial points from Waking Life.

The first, the medium itself.  Snow White was Disneys' first full length feature animation film and it used a film/animation process called Rotoscope.  This is where the realistic characters like Snow White, the Prince and Evil Princess were all modeled after live action footage.  This is also used in Waking Life through a more contemporary digital process created by the animator while attending the MIT media lab.  So the medium is the first correlation.

Next, the message (if you will):  Snow White is full of issues concerning gender roles, sexuality, aging, work ethic, purity, faith, death and so forth.  These are deep and troubling aspects of life generalized or simplified in Snow White. Disney's contrivence from the sexually and socially charged Brothers' Grimm fairytale creates more disturbing ideals concerning conformity to social norms (i.e. gender roles; women home/men at work; beauty/vanity). Also,notice the number of writers who worked on the film in the closing credits.  This alone raises some speculation on these issues and how to draw [sic] these ideals up.

Why does this matter?  Look and discover all the loose ends in Waking Life.  Mysteries revealing only more mysteries.  Nothing is pinned down and this flows througout the neo-phychedellic animation like levels of moving water.  Life can't be held and understood. And here in Waking Life, death is sought along with life.  ""Sleeping Death"" in Snow White is somehow an avoidance of life's terms, the end.  Not really dying, just sleeping and awaiting the ""...life, happily everafter"".  Where at least Waking Life confronts death as an awakening and a continuum of learning like life can be.  Anyone who sees this movie and barks 'psuedo-philosophy' is attempting to pin life and death down.  Waking Life is just a movement through space in an aesethically pleasing way.

Believe me, these questions and philosophical meanderings are by far more enertaining than the fill and fluff of countless long songs in Snow White.  Count the length of songs vs. story/action in Snow White, it's unbearable at times.

I give this movie  Four Stars, understanding how these countless questions can burden ones' mind.  However, the animation gets Five.  Oh, believe me, I know there is more to write and even discuss between these two animation classics.",1118707200,,2803,5.101098901098901
1805060,3,B00007AJKI,"I enjoyed this film, but after the second viewing it began to get a bit tedious, and I don't think I'll be watching it again.  The animation technique used creates a haunting effect -- brilliant.  The philosophical rants range from genius to inane babbling, with a lot of mediocre stuff in-between, so I had to deduct a star for pretentiousness.  The take on the phenomenon of lucid dreaming was great -- some inaccuracies were noted (""light levels"", etc.), but the best stuff is left unsaid, and comes across subtly.  I'm not going to pick it apart with criticism -- yes, it could've been better, but it was an enormous undertaking -- they used a different team of animators for every scene, and it is obvious that a huge amount of time and effort was expended to produce something unlike anything that has ever been done before.  Everyone should see this film once.",1118361600,,867,4.677631578947368
1805061,1,B00007AJKI,"There is a popular misconception that seems to float about among these psuedointelectual film school types; that being that reading a synopsis of the philosophies of Jean-Paul Sartre or Albert Camus and inserting the resultant vague understanding thereof into a film, well, that clearly equates to absolute genius.  Waking Life, Richard Linklater's pompous foray into the realm of intelectual masterbation, has masterfully exploited this misguided notion and made a whole lot of money to boot.

The film is little more than a series of philosophical treatise, vainly refferencing the existentialists through heavy-handed monologues and pretentious one-liners.  These hackneyed vinettes are loosely strung together under the flimsy pretext of a plot involving a young man who may or may not be dead meandering through a variety of dreams.  In the end, what I will begrudgingly reffer to as ""the plot"" serves as little more than a soapbox upon which Linklater can stand and announce, ""Behold!  I am inteligent!  I understand the way life works!  Prostrate yourselves, oh ye less learned masses, before my mighty intelect!""

As for the film's key selling point, the high-tech stylized animation rendered on top of the film, it does a fantastic job of reinforcing the self-important obsessions of the filmmaker.  What would otherwise have been an excedingly dull picture has roped in countless people based solely on a cheap-ass gimmick.  That's all it is.  An insulting gimmick designed to dress up an utterly stupid and self-agrandizing piece of celluloid trash.

Now I realize that this is not a popular take on the film.  It's far easier to praise it as a piece of modern philosophical gold, to laud Linklater as the intelectual messiah, but the fact is that he has made a film expousing the philosophical views of a well-read tenth-grader and passing them off as being spawned from his own fertile (or perhaps not) imagination.  We get it, Rich.  You read a book on existentialism.  Now shut up and go make Dazed and Confused 2: Electric Bugaloo.",1117497600,,2047,5.120481927710843

The story follows the persona of a perplexed seeker of truth (Wiley Wiggins) as he puzzles over whether he is awake or dreaming.

I cherished this revelatory impression of the film until I watched it again as a college sophomore, when I realized that many of the profundities upon which the film is based are flimsy at best.

The science is not interpreted by scientists but by philosophers who have not grasped it in its entirety. The politics lacks depth. The movie gives off a self-important air.

Only a few characters mentioned unexplored and interesting premises. I was disappointed that they were left floating while the more cliched philosophical revelations took precedence. The most telling moment of the film included a tortured novelist in - what else? - a dark cafe.

Every character presented himself as an expert, so telling apart the wise from the banal was an interesting exercise.

I did love the animation, however. It captivated me from the very beginning. I felt it was innovative and a pleasure to watch.

The skill and artisanal craft with which this movie is wrought justifies itself.  The viewer is so effectively invited into the visual universe of this beautiful move, any ambivalence about the form of the movie is replaced by a thoughtfulness that in some places is insightful and other places windy nonsense.

1805077,5,B00007AJKI,"`Waking Life' uses creative animation techniques and a nearly plot-less conversational format to explore some of the deep philosophical questions of consciousness, dream, and reality. While this may sound heavy and boring, director Richard Linklater (`Slacker') brings a surprisingly light touch to the project, and the result is a fascinating, thought provoking, and highly enjoyable film.
I watched this movie twice in one week. I was alone the first time that I viewed it, and found myself hard-pressed to express either the density of the ideas presented, or just how entertaining that presentation was. So I rented it again, and sat down to watch it with my best friend. We put the remote between us, and then, every few minutes, one or the other of us would grab it, hit pause, and launch into a discussion of what we had just seen. It took us all evening to watch this hour and forty minute film this way, but the result of this exercise was both entertaining and mentally stimulating.
Richard Linklater has a knack for making this type of fare. `Waking Life' is similar in many ways to his debut film, `Slacker', which shares its loose, conversational format and philosophical bent. `Waking Life' is a much stronger, more focused and thoughtful film, however, and it is easy to see Linklater's maturation as a film maker and thinker.
If you simply want mindless entertainment, avoid this movie, it is definitely not for you. If, however, you enjoy films that are clever, innovative, and thought-provoking then `Waking Life' very well might become one of your favorites.

1805080,3,B00007AJKI,"'Waking Life' would be more interesing, seen in the context of the up and down and up of the career of director Richard Linklater, one of the most innovative filmmakers in America.  Before making this film, he experienced a very bitter taste of Hollywood and a commercial failure with 'The Newton Boys' which was attacked, or at best ignored, by the fans and critics alike.  Then he went back to his indie origin, and this film is born.

[VIRTUALLY PLOTLESS] The film follows a young man's spiritaul journey, you can summerize.  But more precisely, it comprises of a string of many digitally-animated images showing various people talking about life, or our existence.  The traditional concept of story or characters are not needed, or just troublesome to enjoy this film.

Anyway, that's what many people say rightly.  But the impressive part of the film is that it deals with a wide range of topics -- from Plato to Nietzsche.  The real professor of philosophy appears (in digital animatation), and teaches a thing or two about one sect of pholosophy.

Two things must be remembered.  First, this film was released immediately after the attack of September 11th, the moment we most needed something substantial even in films.  And 'Waking Life' provided it to many people, a springboard to think about the meaning of life again.  But some people thought otherwise; after all, they might say, Why watch, when you can read?

[MEMORABLE VISUALS]  Why watch?  The second merit os the film is this.  Even the most sceptical would admit that the film's images are impressive in its own way, with the real-life hand-held camera's visuals which are digitally painted later.  The results are nothing you have ever seen.  But again, opinions may divide.  Some say it's epoch-making; others say it's sea-sickness.  I say both sides are right.

Steven Soderbergh appears as cameo, but it's very brief.  You see many others (including Linklater himself as a Man at the pinball machine) but it is Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, the stars of the director's 'Before Sunrise' who would be most well-known to us.  One inexplicable thing is that Linklater decided to let the couple show up together in bed, totally ruining the endearing feeling that they exuded in 'Before Sunrise.'  This is unacceptable, for I fondly remember these likable characters in charming 'Before Sunrise.'  Thank God that Linklater made the right sequel to their story in 'Before Sunset.'

The film is exactly what it is -- philosophical journey through the digitally painted world.  And what would Linklater say about 'Waking Life' now, after the success of 'School of Rock'?  I don't know, but the status of this film seems now secured, at least as visual innovation.  It turned out not to my taste, that's why 3 stars, but it is still worth trying for once or more.",1109808000,,2826,4.90295358649789

It is basically about a young vagabond who wanders a nameless town listening to the different ideals of various strangers. Most of the cast may seem unfamiliar, as it did to me, but Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy make an appearance from an earlier film also directed by Linklater. The original shoot took about a month or less to complete while the animation was a languid nine months. But it pays off--in a world of 2D Disney animation and CG in the video game and movie category (and there is practically no gray area in between the 2) it is nice to see a unique sort of animation that is fluid and just overall nice to look at. However, ""Waking Life"" isn't for everyone... if you have a short attention span, you can basically wave goodbye. The characters' monologues are long and can confuse easily if you turn your back for even a second. By the end of the first twenty minutes, you will probably wish for some action to be seen instead of just talk. I also was disappointed with the ending, Linklater could do better than that.

In particular I could relate to the professor who discussed the evolution of mankind as becoming, in modern times, accelerated... to the point where we can actually witness it in a span of a lifetime and that it has become instead of a physiological evolution, one of morality... where we begin to select one another based on criteria such as compassion and intelligence.  In other words we are developing into a race of beings which is evolving through the developement of the mind.  This is just one of the aspects of the film that I loved.
Another is the enigmatic study of language and  other ideas discussed in the film.  How do we interpret words like ""love""?  How did we develop our language and why?  What purpose do our dreams serve?
One would benefit from their own studies of their dreams and an attempt to have lucid dreams through lucid dream learning techniques described in Stephen Laberge's ""Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming"".
There are so many engaging ideas brought to life by this film that all I can say is that Linklater is a revolutionary in the art of capturing ideas in a cinematic format.  ""Dazed and Confused"" was entertaining and a slice in the life of a teenager, but it was a commercial venture for him.  ""Waking Life"" is food for thought for the free thinker and the open minded.  Highly recomended for all who have independent thoughts about evolution, the develpoment of liguistics and the broad study of dream imagery.",1096329600,,1677,4.748275862068965

1805089,5,B00007AJKI,"As profound and verbose as it is, ""Waking Life"" never fails to intrigue me. Linklater enhances his reputation as a maverick and visionary. A lot of the stuff sounded silly, but it ALL made me think. Isn't this what original film is all about? It's episodic (Thank God!), and as such doesn't let any idea get more profound than it is. I was entertained and moved.",1094947200,,362,4.5
1805090,1,B00007AJKI,"~ Although this film is hailed by some as ""Original"" and ""Intellectual"" After watching it twice, I have to disagree vehemently. It is little more than an inane meandering of thought that attempts to prove various philosophies about Biology/Conciousness/Spacetime relations &tc. while abandoning all forms of organized logic. Although the ideas are presented rapid fire, one must assume from the mindlessly naive conceptual framework, that one is overhearing the excited babble of freshman after their first philosphy course. Although I am not well versed in the subjects of some of the ideas presented in the film, I feel compelled to say that their inferences specifically involving Biology and Physics are fundamentally flawed, (i.e. totally fabricated and presented as truth). Some cite the bewilderment you feel after viewing this movie as one of it's proving points. As if implying ""You are just not deep enough to get all it has to say."" I refuse to buy it, a film like this should not ever be taken seriously. It embodies the self gratifying media that feeds a group of coffee table philosophers who regurgitate the latest they have heard NOT learned.",1093824000,,1158,5.132275132275132
1805091,3,B00007AJKI,"An episodic and self-important script is married to some astonishing computer generated rotoscoped animation to make WAKING LIFE a real mixed bag.

 The story, such as it is, seems to revolve a twenty-something slacker who has vivid and realistic dreams.  His journey takes him to a series of other slackers, of varying ages, who blather on and on about evolution and Nietzsche and the meaning of life and such-like.  Ninety-five percent of it is painfully inane, and if this wasn't animated I would have turned it off after the first ten minutes.

 Rotoscoping, tracing live action film onto animation cels, is an old animation technique.  The technical breakthrough here is a software program that allows the animator a much greater degree of freedom and control over the process.  It makes for an animated movie that's fascinating to look at, if not listen to.",1093305600,,863,4.986013986013986
1805092,2,B00007AJKI,"Richard Linklater has made some good movies and I appreciate what he's trying to do here, but the film was downright excruciating to watch. I can't imagine anyone finding it interesting, but apparently, many do. Maybe Philosophy itself just bores me. I did think the animation was cool, and the Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy Before Sunrise scene was inspired, otherwise, this film is better left on the shelf. It is definitely not for all tastes.",1089417600,,441,4.8933333333333335
1805093,5,B00007AJKI,"The real utility of this DVD - ""Waking Life"" - is that it is the ultimate ""how to"" book for any would be animator in this 21st century and a counting.
My comments arise from how I watched it - first without any of the special features, then I watched it with the text-feature, third I watched the movie under the animation and then I watched the special feature in which I watched the explanation by the director of how he had done things with the computer and why he had done so - or rather how he had managed to direct over twenty different animators and get it as seamless as he did - tips like taking the color from the movie instead of from the palette.  I suppose if one animator did the entire movie that would be less an issue.  As it is you may note that some of the other reviewers still note the movie is not seamless and no it is not but many of the methods that the director explains make it more so than would otherwise be so.
There is I suppose a message and medium issue - as for the message whether it is philosophy made simple or existentialism made simple to just concision is up to the viewer - If you view it 5x as I have you see how animation makes it work where the film does not - in the film there is too much information in how the speakers really look - each one could have been a movie in themselves and I can recommend the DVD to point new viewers to these ideas towards the real speakers - if you watch the film with the text on you can capture the names and hence go deeper - as it is - it is an astonishing concision of the meaning of lucid dreaming, cognitive science, existentialism and the big questions.  And as the animation holds it together you hear not one speaker but twenty.  And that is what makes it so extra-ordinary.  The director tells you how they do that.  I mean how they animate - it is amazing and an incredible act of kindness to share method.  Wow wow.",1089072000,,1906,4.10752688172043
1805094,4,B00007AJKI,"""Waking Life"" is an experimental film, it combines dreamy, atmospheric animation with philosophy and animated cameos. The film doesn't have a linear plot, as a matter of fact it doesn't have a plot at all, because ""Waking Life"" it's a collection of individual segments, each one of them contains a monologue, or sometimes a collective speech about existential topics.
By the way, since ""Waking Life"" offers many points of view about a lot of existential topics, there will be some opinions that you will agree with, and other opinions that you won't agree, and that's part of the charm of the movie. ""Waking Life"" doesn't want to tell you the truth about the human being, ""Waking Life"" invites the audience to think, to form an individual opinion about the different elements of our existences. So yes, ""Waking Life"" requires an active audience.
The movie discusses a lot of elements: God, the dreams, the individuality of each person, the existence of the human being, among many others. ""Waking Life"" offers a lot to talk or think about, so this is a fascinating film, because sometimes the speeches get so complicated or complex that you constantly are trying to solve the puzzle in your mind.
Visually ""Waking Life"" is one of the most daring animated films that I have ever seen, you think that Disney will ever make a movie like this one? Obviously not. This is independent cinema at its best. Once in a while it's refreshing to see unique movies like this one, the director and writer Richard Linklater did a great job with ""Waking Life"".",1088985600,,1544,4.80827067669173
1805095,5,B00007AJKI,"This project is an exhilarating meditation on the nature of reality.  Linklater, in my opinion, succeeds remarkably well in mimicking the experience of lucid dreaming with his use of photomontage, cartoon overlays and jerky camera movements. The dialogues and characters in the movie possess a ghost-like quality that lured my unsuspecting mind into the murmurs of incandescent unpredictability, so typical of dreaming....and the creative process.
What underlies all the philosophising, the analysing and reviewing in Waking Life is passion for experience of life mixed with unease and wonder that one has in the face of the unknown.  There are no subterfuges, no tricks, no gimmics, no questions even - only the wide open eyes of a young man watching, observing and experiencing. This is an awesome movie and I intend to watch it many more times.",1087948800,,847,5.220588235294118
1805096,5,B00007AJKI,"""Waking Life"" is so full of ideas, one flowing to the next, it really does feel like some sort of lucid dream.  The animation adds to the overall vitality of the film.  It jumps off the screen, challenging the viewer to wrestle with these questions, to take responsibility for his/her existence for at least a couple of hours.  There is a sense of urgency bordering on desperation as the dream continues and the search for a center, for some kind of clear understanding begins to seem endless.
There is so much here to absorb, you can really loose yourself completely in the film.  At one point, we watch two men discussing the nature of film as an art form (I can't remember who they were) and then the perspective widens and we see that they are, themselves, on a movie screen in a theater with our main character as its sole occupant, which makes sense since it only exists in his mind - in his dream.  Of course, we are also in a theater watching the film, adding another level to this already multi-layered context.
After seeing this movie, I felt thoroughly invigorated.  I wish there were more films like this.",1086307200,,1117,4.532338308457711
1805097,3,B00007AJKI,"Waking Life_ is certainly an intense film, quite unlike anything that is currently out there.  Overall, I enjoyed the film, but it took a couple of viewings to fully absorb everything.  Throughout the film, our protagonist wanders around trying to navigate the gap between dreaming and reality, listening to everyone who has a mind to talk to him.  Naturally, some of the monologues are interesting and stimulating, while some of them are pure rants.  Even the more philosophical talks are delivered with an ordinary language that renders them a bit childish: ""It's like, quantum physics, man.  You know, like, the real stuff that's out there, man.""  This is not an actual quote, but rather a demonstration of the kind of speech to which I am referring.  I get tired of the surfer speech and agree with other reviewers who have called the philosophies ""juvenile"" at times.  There are many points in the film where we get to listen to your average Joe spout off about ""the truth"" when it is obvious that he probably couldn't even pass his driver's exam.
Still, the animation in this film is truly unique and interesting to watch.  Despite the film's rambling nature and absence of plot, the spliced sequences make for an interesting ride that definitely breaks the norm.  If you enjoy animated films that are a bit ""out there,"" you should see _Waking Life_.",1084406400,,1356,4.8311688311688314
1805098,4,B00007AJKI,I really liked this movie although it is a bit too much.  It was a very ambitious undertaking and was done well but the graphics give you a serious headache after awhile.  Not too many full length films have been made in this style and I can see why.  the interviews were interesting as long as you don't watch them all in one go.,1083456000,,330,4.125
1805099,4,B00007AJKI,"Wow, this was the impression i was left with after watching this movie. ""Waking Life"" is intensly philosophical, it challenges your perception on life, death, religion, society and reality itself. How much of a role do your dreams play in your waking life? Can you control your dreams or are you controlled? These ideas are a medium for the more philosophical disscusions the lead has with the countless people he talks do while wondering around doing absolutley nothing.
The amount of talking in the film could be intimidating but only because it forces you to think about what is being said because it is all very deep stuff. At one stage a woman talks of death as being an extended dream that you can't wake from. The anonimity of the majority of characters lets the ideas take form free of any pre-concieved notions you might have if say the ideas were coming from someone well known.
The mass of talking is balanced well with the very innovative animation. The film becomes a living breathing work of art with the characters being represented in watercolour, charcoals, line drawings and in styles reminiscent of surrealists such as magrite or dali and some scenes looking familar to a picasso painting. The animation is used to great effect to emphasize some of the characters points.
In short if you want to be challenged, if you want to view life from a new perspective, watch this movie.",1080777600,,1396,4.7727272727272725
1805100,5,B00007AJKI,"okay, i truly love this movie, every aspect of it! notwithstanding the great animation (each segment of the film being animated from real-life footage by dozens of separate artists), the premise of the film as a lucid dream is simply awsome. i myself have only had a handful of lucid dreams so far though the movie did indeed inspire my latest one! and it's encouraged me to start 'dreaming' more seriously nowadays.
anyways back to the dvd. it's chock-full of nifty extras. first off there are 3 commentary tracks, each for a separate aspect of the film. the first one if regarding the animation process and is basically all of the animators (20+) talking about their segments, why they chose them and how they chose to animate them. very interesting but mainly technical stuff so not for the faint-hearted. next is the great commentary track with director richard linklater and cast members. this is my favorite one because hearing hero wiley wiggins on the track just makes you fall in love with him, he's so sweet! third up is a text commentary (i.e. subtitles over the film) which is incredibly fascinating and regards the ideas and philosophies the people wiley's character encounters throughout the film are speaking of. take note though that the subtitles are incredibly long and run by really fast so if you want to indulge in the explanations you'll have to have your finger on the pause button throghout the film to be able to catch everything.
the deleted animated scenes are nice as are the other animated shorts bob sabiston and linklater had made that are included in the dvd (it is a great dvd after all!), and you can catch a glimpse of the real-live action by looking at selected live action takes as well. the featurette is nice and the animation tutorial is incredibly technical and therefore not really engrossing, and finally the trailers are a nice way of seeing how the plot of a movie can be warped entirely by (most probably) hollywood suits to fool people into going to see a movie which is totally different.

1805103,5,B00007AJKI,"Waking Life is a true achievement in our contemporary films filled with tasteless and insipid stories. Waking Life isn't a story, it's a dream, another parallel universe where the protaganist Wiley Wiggins weaves in and out of others conversations and intelligence poiting towards his own understanding of the difference between dreams and reality. What is so facsinating about this movie is the way that Richard Linklater decides to present this information in a sort of suttle dialect made by real life actors and then painted over to resemble animation. I completely was taking in awe by this film and what it had to say about the normality of what we know is real and what we choose to think is real thus creating our own universe where we can listen to others and not have any control, just floating away or levitating (which Wiley did alot in his dreams) into more mind numbing thoughts. Wiley finds that characteristics of being asleep are not being able to tell light differences and not being able to read his clock which seem to distort if he looks at it so every time he looks at the clock he is unable to tell what time it is because in your sleep, there is no time.
  There definetly are some mind numbing lines in this movie such as short phrases said by strangers passing by Wiley which seem to just flutter before you and make no sense at all. If you are interested in intelligent, suttle, and imaginary movies breaking all possibility of remaining in the real world, this movie is definetly for you.

Come to think of it, this film could have just as easily been called ""Dreaming Life', but that's actually the point.  The word 'dream' can be both a noun and a verb. This film, in a way, takes off from the first scene in Slacker, made over ten years before this one, where Linklater blah blahs about this dream that he just had on the bus.  And then he starts to realize that maybe THEN he was awake, and NOW he's dreaming.  With all this undergraduate philosophy flying around, you'd think it would be a bunch of hooey.

Toward the end,  a plot line finally emerges, though it doesn't seem related to the beginning and middle portions of the movie. It is about whether the protagonist is dead or alive; he can't seem to wake up and isn't sure. It is too reminiscent of ""Jacob's Ladder"" to satisfy, and besides, at least in ""Jacob's Ladder"" there was a concrete outcome; the viewer was able to understand what happened. In ""Waking Life"" it still isn't clear.
It appears the writer(s) had some good ideas, but didn't provide near enough structure in the film to enable the viewer to see where they were going. Perhaps they weren't going anywhere, and while that works with some films, it doesn't with this one. This one is in desperate need of coherence and connections, and much of the philosophical material, which is presented in a boring manner reminiscent of an impersonal lecture hall, fails to guide or connect the scenes. If the writers wanted to present something on the issue of people living without really feeling alive and connected to the world, as the review on the back of the DVD implies, they failed to do it. They could have if they'd done something different with the ending, but once they confused the concept of physical death and acceptance of physical death with the issue of living without feeling truly alive, they destroyed any lasting value this film might have had.",1063670400,,1534,4.660516605166052
1805118,2,B00007AJKI,"I saw this movie once, and I never want to see it again.
The creative forces behind the movie were trying to be original and freethinking with the movie's philosophy, but everything they talked about I had already heard, or have heard since in my high school philosphy/theology class. I didn't hear a single original idea, just a sloppy mish-mash of atheist existential morality, libertarian rage-against-the-system political rants, New-Age interpretation of mankind's future, and something about a collective universal consciousness. Add to that a dash of misinterpreted Christianity and dumb science (one character/orator is in denial about quantum physics) and you have the philosophy of Waking Life.
As if that's not bad enough, the movie's preachy to boot. In lieu of a plot, Waking Life offers a series of disjointed monologues (of course those people sound convincing when no one challenges them!) and a bare-bones story about some guy (who's never named in the movie) who can't figure out if he's dreaming or waking, and can't seem to wake up. So the movie alternates between ramming pseudo-intellectual-existential-New-Age philosohical offal down your throat and mocking your attempts to make sense of its sorry lack of a plot.
Yes, the rotoscopy animation was amazing, but not good enough to redeem the film. I wish Mystery Science Theater 3000, back in their glory days, could have time-traveled 100 years into our future, bought the rights to this film, and then taken it back with them to give it their special treatement. That would make Waking Life both more entertaining and more educational.

1805119,5,B00007AJKI,"Richard Linklater could just be the spokesperson for the twenty-somethings of the early 21st century. In an industry that mostly accepts life as it is and turns to cheap sex jokes, Linklater asks the Big Questions and dwells on real human issues. ""Waking Life"" is no exception. Similar in plot to his debut ""Slacker,"" the film is about 100% more philosophical, with characters talking about subjects like free will, evolution, reincarnation, God, and dreaming (lots of dreaming!).
Yes, there is a LOT of talking in ""Waking Life,"" probably about three times as much as your average film. Thankfully, Linklater keeps things interesting with the amazing animation technique he uses throughout the movie. With a different animator for each scene, ""Waking Life"" never gets tedious. In fact, it makes one anticipate what new and otherworldly images they will see next.

But no, the criticizers can almost never be content with trashing the movie/book/music that they are ostensibly reviewing. Instead they turn their wrath immediately from the subject at hand to those morons, like me, who actually enjoyed the work in question. It's strange....
But anyway, I think anyone who criticizes the MOVIE based on the depth of the philosophical content has missed the point entirely and has maybe taken the whole thing a little too seriously. I'm pretty sure Linklater didn't regard this project as his own personal effort to displace Aristotle in the western canon (heck, during the discussion of free will he has a character explicitly acknowledge that much of what is being discussed could be called sophomoric).
Waking Life is anything but didactic. It is, like Lynch's Mulholland Drive, a DREAM. And just as Mulholland Drive is a dream of and by (so to speak) Hollywood, Waking Life is a dream of and by ideas. And you can't (or at least in my opinion you shouldn't) judge a representation of a dream against what you think would be a proper representation of something else altogether.
One thing I would like to say in Linklater's defense: To suggest that NONE of the philosophical riffs in the film have any sort or academic merit is just plain obstinate. Many of the actors in the film are, in fact, academics, and 3 that I can think of off the top of my head are philosophy professors, who helped craft their monologues and presumably know at least a little (though, I grant you, by no means nearly as much) about the topics as our friendly Amazon critics.
In the criticizer's defense: It's true, Waking Life does not reveal the meaning of life or confirm the existence of God. Sorry if that ruins it for you....

Well, I've said my peace, and in doing so I realize that I'm diving headlong into hypocrisy when I urge reviewers to, please, talk all you want about the movie/book/music in question, but leave us poor total strangers alone.",1057104000,,2208,4.75
1805122,4,B00007AJKI,"""Waking Life"" is not a film for everyone. In fact, in my opinion it's not a film for almost anyone.  That is not to say I don't recommend it, because I do.  I think this is a film that everyone should see, but I would be ridiculously idealistic to say that most people would enjoy or even be interested in what ""Waking Life"" has to say.  Ironically enough, one of the main themes of the film is the need to ""wake"" people who have become complacent, it's just that those type of people are the same ones who probably couldn't make it through fifteen minutes of this film without literally falling asleep.  It's a real shame, but the simple fact of the matter remains that the attention span of today's average movie audience is just not equipped to handle this film.
""Waking Life"" is not really so much a film in the traditional sense as it is a series of philosophical discussions, a montage of people sharing ideas and seriously exploring all facets of life.  There is really no plot, only the wanderings of the protagonist as he navigates his way through a surreal dream state, taking in the things that the various characters he meets have to say.  I myself found this series of theories and intellectual meanderings both fascinating and stimulating.  The film's animation also serves to increase the feeling of wonder and discovery as it perfectly creates a hallucigenic, otherworldly setting.  All in all, in a perfect world I would make ""Waking Life"" required viewing in the hopes that it could ""wake"" some people up and start them thinking.

 To be frank...it is clear to me that most of the reviews I have read on this page are missing what is essential. Anyone using words like 'weird', 'trippy','pretentious','intellectual',is making a very superficial assessment of the substance of this film. In order to run this software, you should perhaps check that your own operating system is in order. One way of doing this is by asking what each image signifies....the musicians, the child hanging onto the car's door handle, the train, the portrait, the dancers, the body in space etc etc etc.
 We live in a culture of intellectualism...people coming at you with words and opinions. This is the context in which the film is set...but it is not what the film is about. Intellectualism is repulsive, but it is what modern human beings must contend with, overcome. Likewise you are asked to see through the intellectualism of this film in order to understand what it is actually communicating. Most films are 'fantastic', this film is about reality. Reality is for those who are dedicated to walking the path which leads from birth through death into life. Anyone who has had this experience will be in a position to speak about it.

1805128,5,B00007AJKI,"First of all you have to see this more than once! The first three times I saw this movie I ended up dreaming, it really is not for everyone. So the other night out of no where I popped this into my VCR expecting not to make it through again but wow! This time without trying I compleatly understood it all. I got so excited I have acctually decided to do my own personal project on it.(this is only for my own enrichment).
Honestly I really think most people would not be capable of seeing this flick for what it really is (mindblowing). It is also one of those movies that if you cannot appriciate than your missing the message all together, Waking Life is absoulutly brilliant. I have never been so impressed with the combination of art and music in anything I have ever seen. There are a lot of people that will compleatly dissagree with me on this and I am not sure those are people that I would want for close friends.
I also have a tip for anyone that does see this: don't try to analize every scene, it will make your head hurt. This movie follows each scene in a very peticular order and it really is not as disorganized as it first appears. Also, the art and the music are very much a part of this movie, if you notice when Wiley feels confused the art follows; same for when he has moments of understanding and clarity. it really does all make sense.

1805129,3,B00007AJKI,"""Waking Life"" is not quite an experimental film, though that's where its heart is.  Essentially a low-budget Richard Linklater film given a digital animation makeover, ""Life"" takes on metaphysics, dream interpretation, Joseph Campbell, film criticism, and I'm sure several other grad school subjects as well.  It steadfastly refuses to adhere to the ""show it, don't tell it "" theory of screenwriting, so much so that ""My Dinner With Andre"" begins to look like a Jerry Bruckheimer project in comparison.  The rotoscoped animation (they actually filmed actors live and traced them frame by frame) is a mixture of styles, with some shots being intentionally primitive, and some achieving a very eerie, stylized realism.  Often it is quite gorgeous too look at, but sometimes there's a brownian shifting of backgrounds and figures within the frame that can be rather jarring (maybe it comes from rotoscoping hand-held camera work, but sometimes it happens in what appear to be static scenes, suggesting that it is an animator's choice).
So, to recommend it?  That's a hard question.  I did enjoy it, and I think I will discover interesting things that I didn't catch in initial viewings, but I have a feeling that the audience for this film is extremely limited.  It's not even a good taste/bad taste issue-I think as many serious art film fans will find this as tedious as the mainstream crowd.  It does tend to meander around without a true center, but there are occasions, such as late in the film, when the main character tries to change his dream, that are really well written and even (almost) dramatic.  I'd say if you like Linklater's other films, you should have a good time with this.  Likewise, if you are predisposed to enjoy lofty discussions with friends this might be for you.  It's bargain-basement cheap for a DVD, so it won't set you back too much, and it has some nice extras  (comentaries, shorts, and a demonstration of the digital rotoscoping process, for the curious).

The advanced rotoscoping techniques yield tremendous didvidends, with the art work enhancing instead of literalizing the visuals: crucial in a film with such unique pretensions.

1805132,2,B00007AJKI,"Waking Life contains plenty of beautiful artwork, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.  But what has the potential to be an intellectually stimulating movie turns out to be a pseudo-intellectual bore.  All of the ideas brought up and examined throughout this piece are unoriginal pop-culture ravings, probably written by a film student who has never read a philosophy book in his life but believes himself to be enlightened due to all the pot he smokes.  At least that's the impression I got. I see the writer of this film as an intellectual equivalent of the character Luzhin, from Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"", a fool who attempts to impress people by memorizing supposedly intelligent, long quotes, and then repeating those quotes to others.  Waking life examines modern science, but doesn't question its premises.  It brings up the issue of religion, but rather than questioning religion, the film attempts to combine what is popularly believed in religion with what is popularly believed in science without justification.

1805133,1,B00007AJKI,"If you're impressed by relentless name-dropping, superfiscial postulation, and overstimulating your eyes to the point of having a headache, then perhaps this movie is for you.  In which case, you should just stop reading right now and go out and buy this movie...  Heck!  Buy two or three copies just to get them off the shelf!
At best, this movie was like a droning college philosophy teacher, at worst like a romantic teenager.  From simply stating common sense to academic-esque name-dropping, _Waking Life_ only produces a sense of frustration at how pretensious a movie can really be.
...And this isn't even getting into the animation.  At first, I'll admit, I too thought this was a really visually beautiful movie (at times it is), but after a while the animation began to grate at me as much as the ""philosophy"" ... With the ever-swirling, ever-morphing visuals, fifteen or twenty minutes left me feeling as if I was drunk and trying to listen to a bunch of amateurs (for the most part) blather on and on about...  dreams, I suppose...  Experience?...  I must say that I was almost wholey distracted from the monologues and dialogues by the overstimulation on the screen.
In the long run, I don't think that I gained a single positive thing from this movie (other than knowing yet another movie that I should not watch again and gaining the opportunity to inform others about it).
Richard Linklater's earlier movie ""Slackers"" to me was much the same, and yet much better in that it had a much lower level of pretension...  probably b/c he wasn't trying to impress us with his animating abilities and sense of aesthetic.
This is a movie for the unthinking masses.  I say philosophy should be more engaging than _Waking Life_ is capable of being.  Not once was I inspired into my own train of thought during this entire movie.  I felt as if I was being told a bunch of silly ideas about what dreams are and what reality and experience are, rather than being asked to think them out for myself.  In my experience, it is (more or less) the same fault in most traditional philosophy courses.
I'm telling you, there's a lot out there that does VERY WELL what _Waking Life_ only pretends to be able to do:
If you are after philosophy, there are **what??** 2400 years of great philosophical readings from Plato to the _Bible_ to Darwin to Nietzsche to Freud  to Irigaray...
If you're into great animation, try checking out anything by Hayao Miyazaki...
If it's dreams you're into, then there's _Akira Kurosawa's Dreams_, or _The Book of Dreams_ by Jack Kerouac...
Or if it's visual stimulation you're after, take a walk through any art museum, or watch any movie by Kurosawa, Bergman or Fellini...

It may take more than one viewing to absorb ALL of the implications made by this film, but ANYONE can learn something from Waking Life.

I am relieved whenever I come across a movie that takes an interesting idea and allows itself as a film to become wrapped around its content. The challenging aspect of Waking Life though is that the content varies from the completely cerebral to the sophmoric. Which I suppose is the challenge of making a stream-of-conciousness take on the dreamstates of life, cinema, and art. The use of rotoscope throughout the film makes it seem like a  dream-state of the movie 'Slacker'.
For those who dismiss it simply as a hashing of 'Philosophy 101' concepts or a forum for Generation  X rants, they are missing the point entirely. At its best, Waking Life is a compelling call to action for the re-awakening of the collective and individual senses of wonder and imagination that have been bastardized by the market-culture.

1805147,2,B00007AJKI,"I feel somewhere in between of giving this film 2 or 3 stars. It's a commendable experiment, a very original movie, and for that I would give it 3 stars. But for all of that, it is ultimately a movie I didn't enjoy much. So that's why I gave it 2 stars. Read on for further thoughts...
First, the animation. It's amazing. It's interesting to see how it changes from scene to scene, giving it different moods for different characters. The extreme distortions in one, for example, are very engaging. Yet I have a little but. The truth is the different parts (backgrounds, characters, objects) bounce around a little bit throughout the whole film. This is certainly interesting and goes well with what the movie is trying to convey, but I can't help getting a little bit dizzy about it all, and I think it would have been much better if this 'bounziness' (for lack of a better word) would have been used sporadically. That would have been much more effective. The same goes, for example, for the extreme distortions previously mentioned. They are repeated throughout a long dialogue where all we see is that face being contorted and distorted over and over again. But despite all the minor complaints, animation is excelent, and will have you glued into the screen for some time.
Then, the plot or, better said, the dialogues. The idea of the movie was promising, and I really wanted to like this movie. But the fact that it has no plot whatsoever puts the whole of the importance on the dialogues. And the truth is that some really succeed in making you think, whilst most are simply... boring. They start repeating themselves and going off to places that don't make any sense at all (unless you're high, I guess). It's just so many 'profound' reflections that don't actually have any meaning, any substance behind them. There's mainly questions asked in this movie. Don't expect any anwers. And although I think that could be a good thing, after the first 30 minutes, it all gets boring and repetitive. And it goes on way too long after that. The other thing I didn't really like was the 'plot developments'. They were waaaaay too predictable. Like when Wiggins is told 'You can tell you're in a dream when you try to switch off a light and the light stays on'. I expected this would occur sometime later in the movie. It would have a bit of expectation. But it happens right after they finish speaking. One way or another, I figured they would show us this whole film was a dream, but I though it would have been interesting to give some suspense to this, or to give the feeling that maybe some of it was dream while some might have been reality. The ending was very predictable as well. When I saw him starting to fly off and reach for the car again (and because of the time I knew the end was near), I automatically knew he would fly off and the movie would end.
The music, however, is something entirely different. Glover Gill composed a poignant and engaging score. The tango music fits perfectly the film and the questioning it's trying to get through, and I thought the music scenes were some of the best parts of the movie itself (especially the one in the Ritz in Austin, where they are dancing tango, towards the end).
In the end, Waking Life is a worthy experiment, but the end result is not as good as I would've liked it to be. I think this could have worked much better as a short, but I guess it wouldn't have had so much attention and success. The animation and music are top-notch, but the film becomes quite boring after the first half-hour, except for a few interesting dialogues.",1039478400,,3598,4.545454545454546
1805148,5,B00007AJKI,"A bona fide landmark achievement in the field of animated movies, 'Waking Life' is a film destined for cult status.  The unconventional animation technique used here is hypnotic and serves to energize what would otherwise be a wearisome movie.  There is a coherent storyline present but it's periodically overwhelmed by the frequent metaphysical diversions that the lead character engages in with a variety of philosophically minded individuals.  These vignettes are purposely designed to be enlightening, outrageous, trivial, astonishing, dignified and even boring.  Unequaled in form, function, style or substance by any film in recent memory, you will likely find 'Waking Life' either an invigorating experience or a stultifying and tedious 100 minutes.  Fans of the director, Richard Linklater, will have a head start on this challenging and offbeat movie that is not without rewards.  A rare film that actually benefits from repeated viewings.
The DVD presentation is a great package, containing many entertaining extras that provide insight into the story and explain the unique animation technique; wisely, the movie is presented in a widescreen format.  There is the usual requisite deleted scenes and theatrical trailer, but best of all are the animated film shorts by Bob Sabiston, who designed the animation for the film.",1039305600,,1332,5.5
1805149,5,B00007AJKI,"Let me start by saying that this film is a visual treat of the highest order.  Right up there with the best of the best in animation, and should be in every serious/artsy DVD collection for its incredible visual artistry alone.  I would like to personally congratulate all of the animators.  The original score, too, is very worthwhile - rather than assembling a collection of the alterna-pop du jour, Linklater wisely chose an acoustic troupe whose boudouir-Bartokian richness and lyricism lends a new layer of sophistication to the experience.  Purely in terms of sensory bravura, ""Waking Life"" offers more than any of Linklater's other films.
But, in terms of the story, ""Waking Life"" falls a little short of Linklater's brilliant feature debut.  If you've seen and absorbed ""Slacker"" as many times as I have, you can clearly see the roots of this film with one viewing.  It's a return to the original inspiration, with a nod to the commercial perspiration (a la Delpy and Hawke).  The familiar Austin backdrops remain visible to the discerning eye: the Drag, the Capitol, the UT Campus, and the trendy coffee-houses.  Several characters from ""Slacker"" make an appearance as well, sometimes in similiar roles, sometime radically shifted.  Linklater attempts more narrative coherence in ""Waking Life"" by casting the impossible-to-dislike Wiley as a central protagonist around whom the chaos revolves, but it's the chaos itself that's not as interesting.  It just doesn't hit as hard in the post-Terence-Mc-Kenna age.
There are cogent discussions (by a UT professor on the positive and pragmatic modes of Existentialism, a spiritual linguist on ""Byzantine"" discourse semantics, by a crackpot driving emcee on post-capitalist revolutionism, and by a redheaded pixie on the ant-like behavior of socialized humans).  There are also the moments of violence that Linklater has always felt the need to foreground, but in WL they are sometimes handled not as skillfully.  And, inevitably, there are some quite banal, repetitive, or otherwise not-so-hot ideas and emotions being tossed around.  It seems as though the characters are trying too hard, the script is too tight (whether consciously or not), and the result is a series of ""my twenty cents"" moments rather than a story that emerges from a true creative chaos.
All of that aside, the film will indeed make you think and perhaps even dream.  Give it a chance.  The messages within ""Waking Life"" are essential as an antidote to consumer culture.  If the experience of the film opens doors, writes question marks, and begs us to dream just a little bit more, then it has done its due.  The struggle of maintaining one's dignity and individualism within an increasingly complex universe is the essential one faced by both everyman and the intellectual who doesn't simply want to cave into the forces of late capitalist culture.  Reinjecting humanity, creativity, and even magic into our everyday life is the film's urgent message to me, and I think that message is communicated quite well.  If, for example, we can take the film's own embedded interpretation of the filmic experience itself as a ""holy moment"" (rather than holding it to the same standards of judgment as we do written discourse), then perhaps my criticms are beside the point.
All in all, I am glad the real Linklater is back.  When someone pushes the edge as hard as he does with this film, and pulls it off with confidence and panache, he deserves our support and kudos for a long time to come.  He certainly has mine.",1039046400,,3536,5.030874785591767

1805151,5,B00007AJKI,"In Steven Soderbergh's bit in this flick he tells of Louis Malle meeting with Billy Wilder and telling Wilder his latest film cost $2.5 million.  Wilder asks what it's about and Malle says ""A dream within a dream"" and Wilder replies ""Well, you've just lost $2.5 million"".  Richard Linklater knew what he would be up against with this film, and judging by some of the reviews here, he got that kind of response.
First, the film looks great!  Using computer animation layed over live action footage, Linlater tells a tale of dreams within dreams, with his hero meandering around encountering this one and that one, and soon realizing that the distinction between his life awake and his life asleep and dreaming has been blurred beyond recognition.  I don't know any other way this dream-like state could have been conveyed WITHOUT the use of animation.  The rocking, floating surrounding motions, and the fluid ever- changing visuals conveys the dream state better than anything we've seen previously.
As to the content of the encounters in the various vignettes that make up the film, I was always entertained by the intellectual prattle that ranged from fascinating to facetious, from the ridiculous to the sublime.  I liked the fact that Linklater made a film that allowed people to expound on their obsessions and philosophy, whether crackpot or intuitive.  It certainly was a different day at the cinema.
Finally, I congratulate the filmakers for their cleverness and for the sheer originality of the endeavor.  It is very satisfying to see someone marry technology with inspiration and tell a tale, in this case various ideas about the conscious and the subconscious, in a way it never could have been told before, and with a method that perfectly conveys the ideas presented.
Certainly not for everyone, but well worthwhile for those seeking something different, done extremely well.",1038009600,,1888,5.067741935483871

Not because it's gross, but because the constantly shifting, floating, warping images were producing the same sensation I used to get on car trips when I was a kid. I've learned from experience (boat rides, airplane flights, etc.) that I am much more susceptible to motion sickness than most people, and Waking Life made me very queasy, very fast.  (And from the 10-15 minutes I did see, the dialog is no prize either; kind of like what you'd hear at a university-area coffee house at 2 am.)

1805155,5,B00007AJKI,"As a character in this movie said, often it's very boring to hear about someone else's dream. They often don't make sense to either the dreamer or the victim of the recap, but when you yourself have a dream that bugs you all day, it's almost irresistible to tell others about it. It kind of feels like Rick Linklater, in making a movie like this, found a way to tell us all about some of his dreams, and the dreams of others, but without being boring at all. Far from it, in fact! It's exhilarating!
Of course, the movie itself is a dream, a stroll through someone's unconscious. It feels very personal, a feeling enhanced by the director himself appearing at both the beginning and the end ov the movie, almost as a guide both to the main character and to us, the viewers. It's as if Linklater is telling us, ""Hey- are dreams cool or what?!"" and at the same time showing us the message of his own dream creation.
We hear many people talk about their perspectives on reality, consciousness, and life in general, and this makes us feel like one of them, because we all wonder about these things from time to time. Any movie that can remind people that they are not alone in this world (without being smarmy) is a success in my book. Everyone has dreams, and this mere fact makes the movie work, because it appeals to a side of all of us. Not only that, it introduces the concept of lucid dreaming to anyone not already familiar with it.
This review is not a plot summary. To try that would be futile, because I'd only focus on the stuff I thought was cool. It's like a collection of seeds for each of us to sort through at leisure and cultivate on our own, and this very process makes it a unique and personal experience for everyone that sees it.
After seeing this movie, I began writing my dreams down, because I was so excited at the prospect of being able to control my own dreams. And any movie that inspires something like that in me is also a success in my book! See it and you won't be sorry!",1035417600,,1999,4.305039787798409
1805156,5,B00007AJKI,"If you are an artist, as I am, this film is so envelope pushing on blending the real world with the animated world that you can shut off the sound and just watch it.  It is worth the money right there because you have never seen a film that looks like this.  And you even get to see a special feature with the inventor of the process working with his drawing tablet and computer monitor so you can learn how it is done.  My husband, who hates animation, loved this because he noticed right away how much more real world everyone looked. Next, if you like the kind of film that explores quirky characters and ideas with lots of conversation, this film contains that in spades.  It reminded me a bit of ""My Dinner with Andre"" in that respect.

So even when you turn on the sound, there is still a movie that many people will enjoy. There is no other plot per se as this is a film about ideas and daily life albeit in a university setting.  Linklater, the director, is notorious for having made ""Slackers"" as his first film.  Some viewers will compare this film to ""Slackers"" saying it is a more adult version of that film.  In its quirkiness, it does resemble ""Slackers."" However, ""Slackers"" was only a mild nudge of the envelope whereas ""Waking Life"" is a full blast push off the cliff.  I bought this film after seeing it.  There was no way I was going to be caught without my own copy if it went out of release.  That kind of says it all.

1805159,5,B00007AJKI,"Very thought provoking.
  The movie is a string of vignettes linked by a low-key but interesting plot. The vignettes are each ""bite-sized"" monologues or dialogues musing on the nature of life, death, free will, creativity, and existence. They are all done with a sense of humor, respect, and compassion. No one is ""right"" or ""wrong""; thoughts are simply presented by the thinker. React and absorb what you will.
  I saw this one night, and within three hours of waking the next morning, bought two copies, one for myself, one as a gift. I watched it twice the first weekend.
  If you like to think when you watch a movie, or just to sit and think, this is a great movie to watch many times.
  Content aside, the music is a very nice Jazz / Swing collection. It makes great background music, only dominating the scene on the few scenes when it's supposed to be in the forefront. The animation style is interesting. It can take a bit to get used to everything being in motion, but I found I became accustomed to that quickly.",1030924800,,1023,4.521739130434782

Interesting at first but after an hour I was gettins somewhat annoyed, luckily the animation is enough to keep you entertained.  Some of the animation is a little choppy in parts, but that might have been intended.  The animation styles change throughout the movie giving it a strange but effective painterly feel.  A large team of animators worked on this film, understandibly, and that is part of the appeal, if you don't like what is being said, or the annimation style, you can just wait five or ten minutes and another style of annimation will take over.  This is a truly original film about lucid dreams...a hot topic in the world of cinema.  Vannila sky is another film that dealt with the idea of lucid dreams, however waking life makes the lucid dream last the entire movie.  This film is a huge accomplishment for director Richard Linkliter (Dazed and Confused, and Slacker), I can't wait to see what he's cooking up next.  I highly reccomend this film for its visual appeal, if you are into those artsy type movies.  You can even watch with the volume on mute and still enjoy it.",1029974400,,1247,4.601809954751131
1805161,3,B00007AJKI,"This DVD is worth owning if only for the gorgeous animation. Many of the scenes have eerie trance-like sequences that remind you of Chagall. It's a perfect way for Linklater to make an interesting film, considering his fondness for street-philosophizing. So it's too bad that the dialogues (mostly monologues, actually) contain ideas that sound like regurgitated musings of discontented grad students gathered at a cafe. It's no way to drive a film. I'm not a proponent of 'plot-must-drive-the-film', but the ideas expressed in this film are unoriginal and even worse, highly stilted and formalized. Nevertheless, the film world needs more Linklaters who are unwilling to bend to the confinements of the Hollywood standards. It's just a shame that this movie, for all that it could have been, turned out to be an exercise in gab expressionism. If you are a stoner philosopher extraordinaire, this disc is a must-buy. If not, this film is rent-worthy.",1027382400,,950,5.175324675324675
1805162,5,B00007AJKI,"The main objections that people have to this movie are two-fold:
1) the dialogue is pretentious.
2) the dialogue is boring.
I will attempt to explain why they think that:
First off, the dialogue snippets are INDEED accurate.  Linklater went through great pains to not only get ACCURACY, but more importantly, BREVITY so that a WIDE SCOPE OF IDEAS could be crammed into ONE MOVIE. That means only a FEW MINUTES for each  POINT OF VIEW.
Just think about the ENORMOUS task of breaking down Sartre's 900 Page, Nobel Prize winning masterpiece down to a 12 minute monologue - trying to retain the BREADTH of his meaning, and without giving a bastardized representation. That means that some fancy words and dialogue have to be ASSUMED on the audience's part [SORRY, no time to explain EVERYTHING - we've only got a few minutes of airtime], and that's where the PRETENTIOUSNESS comes from. that's what people are COMPLAINING ABOUT, since they DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT - it all went TOO FAST. Well here's the thing: it's not possible for most of us to understand it.
Unless you've read the text before watching the movie, and 95% of us haven't, you're not going to know what's going on.  It is DIFFICULT ENOUGH to understand Sartre in an entire SEMESTER of lectures, let alone to make full sense of it in a cartoon movie.
Still, I think Linklater did an excellent job considering the obstacles against him. The portion that he tried to show was a great choice: people misunderstand existentialism to be about DEPRESSION AND HOPELESSNESS.  Sartre did not want that. He said that **WE** must TAKE RESPONSIBILITY for our own actions, up to US to make our own lives better.
Your answers to life are NOT in this movie. But what you will find is the affirmation that you are NOT ALONE when you have these thoughts about life. Because we don't discuss these things at work, or talk to our family and friends too often about it, doesn't mean that they aren't important to us. These are the thoughts that are in the periphery of our minds in passing moments, or the ones that keep us awake at night when we're alone - but we aren't alone. Other people out there THINK TOO.
DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE IF:
1) if you're not constantly questioning the purpose of life, or if you think you've got it all figured out.
2) if you think that PRETENTIOUSNESS people are the ones that talk about things that YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND...
Because the truth of the matter is... if you truly KNOW something about these people, then you will LOVE this movie. anyone can easily REVERSE NAMEDROP [dropping names to give the FALSE impression that they're knowledgeable, only to DISMISS THEM]. The concepts of some of these thinkers are very hard to grasp and it's EASIER for people to just call them boring or pretentious. Just because you don't understand it, doesn't mean it's GOOD, but it CERTAINLY doesn't mean it's BAD either.
Most of you who didn't like it, i'm afraid have missed the point [Just take a look at your horrendous spelling skills as one rubric of intelligence].",1026950400,,3030,4.679174484052533
1805163,4,B00007AJKI,"Trippy and incisive or visually irritating and pretentious? Half-empty or half-full? Richard Linklater's unique rotoscoped treatise on the Meaning Of Life seems to polarize its reviewers like night and day. If you like neat little tied-up Hollywood endings prefaced by  neon signs flashing plot points along the way, you are likely to find this one a snoozefest. If you go into this one with an open mind and an objective philosophical stance, you'll find it at least mildly engaging, and never boring. The fact that the film suffers from Attention Deficit Disorder is what makes it most interesting to this reviewer. Try this at home: Pop this film in the player while you're watching your favorite commercial TV program. During the spot breaks, instead of hitting 'mute' or surfing channels, watch ""Waking Life"" in 3 to 5 minute serialized segments. It all suddenly makes much more sense, doesn't it?

1805166,5,B00007AJKI,"This movie is extremely strange, and certainly catches one off guard with the unorthodox animation. Shot on equipment many people have in their own homes, the many vignettes were then animated by artists who colored over the original live footage. The animation pulses (not the cold ueber-realistic 3D kind, nor the flat expressionless cartoon kind), deeply individualistic--and sometimes borders on the weird, as when a chimpanzee gives a lecture.
Deeply thoughtful, often shocking, this movie is eerily reminiscent of a half-conscious five A.M. dream--the main character wanders (and sometimes floats) around speaking to decidely strange characters who spout off about life, music, the dream state. This is a brilliant movie--but only if one allows it to be.

There is some beautiful, rewarding thought in this movie and drawing out the path of the conversations--why this guy comes before that guy--is a gratifying exploration of theme and ideology.  The first half hour alone justifies this movie ever being made.

1805168,3,B00007AJKI,"I usually do not like rotoscoping, the animating technique of (at lest for foreground action) drawing over real film footage of a person and then, after the animation is complete, removing the live-action footage so that the animation is all that is shown.  Rotoscoping has been used in Ralph Bakshi films such as Heavy Metal and in Delta Airlines' preflight video showing people buckling their seat belts or grabbing an oxygen mask.  Rotoscoping sometimes produced a strange effect, with outlines squiggling around.  This is because every frame of the film was traced independently, often with loose or flowing lines, so the lines did not line up from frame to frame.  Even when the tracing was more exact and caused less line-wiggling, rotoscoping usually has had nothing to offer over live-action film or animation.  The resultant images in rotoscoping did not move as smoothly as in live-action film, but they were too constrained by the live action images they were based upon to have the exuberant, cartoonish movement and expressions we would expect of characters in an animated feature.  The outcome often was a clumsy hybrid of animation and live-action filmmaking.
Waking Life gets around these problems.  The chief animator developed a computer program to make lines flow more smoothly from frame to frame, so that the action can be more photorealistic when desired.  In other scenes, the animators use the initial live-action images as only a loose basis for their own animation, so that they can take advantage of the creative possibilities of animation.  Also, the super-saturated colors of the film are quite pleasing.
Despite the cutting-edge, playful animation, the film's spirit is surprisingly old-fashioned.  The movie is painfully earnest, even in scenes with awful, pretentious dialog.  Some scenes are like sitting next to a bunch of stoned Deadheads trying to explain the meaning of the universe.  Sometimes you wish that somebody in the movie would cast an ironical glance at the movie and see the humor in scenes such as when the protagonist walks by a stranger who says something to the effect of, ""As you go deeper into puzzle passive acceptance is no longer an option.""  How did the actor utter that line without breaking out laughing?  Indeed, Waking Life is always so serious and earnest in its philosophical musings that watching it can be like being stuck in a feminist consciousness-raising session or in a high school existentialist club.  The only time humor deliberately creeps into the film is when the protagonist catches a ride in a car that looks like a speed boat and gets a comical lecture about life from the, er, captain of the boat.
That is not to say that there are not some fascinating ideas in the movie, but the gems are mixed in with the dirt.  How many of the ideas are new to you will depend in part upon whether you have taken, say, Philosophy 101, but even this seasoned philosopher came across some interesting ideas new to me, some ideas being big-P Philosophical and others just being interesting observations about the human condition.
The structure of the movie is like a sequence of animated lectures.  There is a lot of talking and very little plot.  This hardly seems like the best use of the cinema's possibilities.  If you want a lecture or essay, take a class or read a book.  When serious themes are explored in a movie, you would expect the filmmaker to bring the themes come alive through an engaging story.  For instance, the story in the Matrix cleverly illustrates  Descartes' worry that an evil genius could be altering all of his perceptions.  Waking Life offers didactic philosophy lectures rather than an organic union of plot and ideas.  The only exception to this generalization is that the theme of dreaming is nicely echoed by the trippy visuals.
Waking Life is too overtly philosophical to be most people's cup of tea, and some people will dismiss it as pretentious nonsense, but others will find this cosmic-wow of a movie to be just the right way to be introduced to philosophy.",1026000000,,4061,4.9208211143695015
1805169,5,B00007AJKI,"Almost invariably, ""Waking Life,"" the 2001 animated film from Richard Linklater is described as `original.'  For once, this oft-overused moniker is accurate: there isn't anything quite like this movie.  It advertises itself as a series of philosophical vignettes, which range all over the subject spectrum but are usually united by a common thread of meaning: that of dreams and the reality of the `dream world.'
A film based upon that premise could easily fall into the highschool-discussion/drug-induced-nonsense level of discourse, but ""Waking Life"" plunges headlong into the fray without batting an eye.  Fairly early in the film, pretentious philosophy is dismissed with a nice rebuttal to the sophomoric question: ""What if you're just a construct of my dream, and exist only in my mind?""  ""Well, then I'm as real as anything else.""  And that's the starting point for a meditation on the meaning (if any) of dreams, and some of the dreamlike things people encounter in their daily lives.
""Waking Life"" is also animated, using a pretty unique form of animation: each scene was shot, and then ""drawn over"" by animation artists in a variety of styles, from expressionist art to nearly-photographic digital renderings, depending on the mood of each scene.  The result is something that resembles an acid trip or a hallucination, where tables of restaurant patrons float above the ground, faces change while moustaches stay the same, and the background is in a near-constant state of flux.  It can get nauseating after a while, but the overall effect is subtle enough not to draw attention from the content of the film, which is a rare quality for so-called ""art"" films.  It's almost a crime that ""Jimmy Neutron"" was nominated for ""Best Animated Film"" while ""WL"" was not.
Because of these varied qualities, ""Waking Life"" isn't for everyone, and certainly gets a ""rent-if-before-you-buy-it"" caveat.  The DVD presentation is as good as one could want: an anamorphic widescreen presentation with crisp colors and a 5.1 soundtrack (not that philosophical conversation requires dynamic sound), and a nice helping of extras.  Don't write ""Waking Life"" off as something smart people (or those who pretend to be smart) will enjoy and yack about - it's just not the average, everyday film and requires an attentive mind and (perhaps) multiple viewings to fully enjoy.  For those willing to take the plunge with an open mind, ""Waking Life"" is a rewarding film experience.

Its as if the flimakers here shot everyting on a normal camera and then went back into the sudio and then painted over it. Weather or not they acually did that or not I am not sure. The effect is truly trippy, and very uniqe. I have never seen anything quite like it berfore.
Next thing I must mention and appalud is the screenplay. Its a screenplay that asks the complex quastions of life. Like what are we here for? Is there life after death? What are dreams?
Warning. If you like to watch movies or you like to watch animated flicks, because you like to zone off, rather than think hard about what your watching. I suggest you avoid this.",1025395200,,743,4.314285714285714
1805172,4,B00007AJKI,"Animation is not usually associated with deep thinking, but ""Waking Life"" is an exception.  In fact, the animation is precisely what makes this film work so well.  A synopsis of the plot is impossible, but essentially a gen-X type character drifts in (and out?) of a dream state.  Along the way, he talks to various deep thinkers who share their ideas about dreams, life, and religion.  The different actors kind of play themselves and primarily deliver monologues to the main character, who is frequently passive.  Sounds pretty grim, but it's definitely not.  True, if this movie wasn't animated, it would be incredibly pretentious.  However, the animation, which is spectacular, really helps ground this film.
There are certain scenes I'll never forget from this film, particulary the revelation that one cannot turn off the lights in dreams (whether that's true or not is irrelevant).  Different segments of the film have been done by different animators, which helps keep things fresh throughout.  Most of the stars are not well-known, but watch for Ethan Hawke and Nicky Katt, among others.
I avoided seeing this film in the theaters, despite the stellar reviews, because I am not a fan of movies that explore philosophical or religious issues in such depth.  However, I found myself enjoying the movie immensely.  It's funny and thought provoking.  Highly recommended, especially for persons interested in philosophy and religion.",1025308800,,1437,5.22707423580786
1805173,4,B00007AJKI,"Lucid dreamers, amateur philosophers, autodidacts and fans of paint-by-numbers take note:  this movie is for you!  The film begins with a tango that sounds like Piazzola but is apparently pure Texas - a nice surprise.  The animation is reminiscent of a more detailed (and deft) paint-by-numbers style.  Squirming strokes and flat sections of color wobble and morph from cel to cel giving a sense of depth and muscularity that is more typical of fine-art painting than contemporary animation.  There are several different animator's hands in evidence, but the multiple styles are similar and complementary.  It's worth seeing just for the look of the thing.
The plot, as such, is basically Wiley Wiggins walking around trying to figure out where he is, with side trips into why he is, or who he is.  The characters he meets on this ramble are intensely ordinary yet interesting, and the whole thing has a very ""finding ourselves"" college-town feel.  Even the crackpots are interesting, if only for the pure spectacle of watching an inspired lunatic perform his or her best schtick.  It does drag a bit in spots, but I suspect the scenes that will seem more or less compelling will vary from viewer to viewer.  However, I particularly loved the angry guy, the lucid dream/light switch guy, and the girl with the angular face and red sausage curls.  And if you have wondered what happened to the couple from Linklater's earlier ""Before Sunrise,"" we do find out here - a nice little valentine.
There is no action to speak of, no real conclusions - just lots and lots of talk and some really gorgeous and unique animation and a fabulous soundtrack.",1025136000,,1643,4.874100719424461
1805174,3,B00007AJKI,"There is so much to love about this movie. First off, and foremost is the animation. It reminded me of the first time watching 'Akira', the way I would go ""ooohhh, ahhhh!...damn that's cool"" whenever I saw the tail-lights on cars trace and fade, or the layered sky lines of neo Tokyo moving along and shifting perfectly as if it was filmed in real life. The animators of Waking Life surpassed that. Watching Waking Life is like going to an art musuem and watching the paintings start to move. This is not a cartoon, boys and girls, this is art, and anything less would make me mark this movie down to zero stars because without the superb work of the animators, the way they captured and at times exagerated facial expressions and all the subtle body language involved in conversasion...this movie would not get across (with intrest) the idea's held there-in.
This is not your Friday night flick, the kind that you relax and vegatate in front of after a hard week. Bring your pen and notebook, and replace that popcorn with a cup of coffee...you're going to need it.
Now, I love this movie, but there's one reason why I can't give it five stars, that being the set up of this film. It is a long collection of short vignettes, mostly of a philosophical nature. While this may sound boring to most people, the strange thing is, while discussing this movie with others I have found out, nearly everyone has taken part in a similar conversation, whether it be about free will, the opression of Corporations, or maybe wondering about reincarnation, we have all wondered and talked about at least one subject in Waking Life. Maybe the creators of Waking Life are hoping that by identifing with one conversation, that you'll catch on to another idea. This truly is the movie for the thinking voyeur.",1024963200,,1792,4.65615141955836
1805175,5,B00007AJKI,"Linklater's ""Waking Life"" begins very simply, with a young girl and boy playing with what Linklater describes in his commentary track as a ""cootie catcher"" or ""fortune teller,"" which reveals one of the basic principles of the film: 'Dream is Destiny.' From there, the film becomes much heavier and the dialogue becomes much more thick, like a shrouding fog - forget the popcorn, bring the longest attention span you can muster - but it all branches from the same basic principle: That our dreams provide more than just an escape as we stumble our way through life.
Two theatrical films tackled such a weighty subject last year - the other, Cameron Crowe's ""Vanilla Sky,"" works, but not as well as ""Abre los Ojos"", the Spanish film upon which it is based - and while Tom Cruise managed to take the idea to the masses (and to blockbuster status), it is clearly Linklater's film which emerges victorious. The characters are rich, vibrant, and believable, and the vignette presentation makes it possible for the film not to run away from itself; by breaking it down into little segments with countless different faces, we are able to process the information we are receiving much more fluidly.
The concept is a well-conceived one. The story may have fallen flat on a live action film, and the animation may have been viewed as cumbersome on a different project, but married together, they create a different and believeable reality, a universe that we, the audience, are allowed to inhabit for our 100 minutes.
Linklater says that the film in many ways is a brother to ""Slacker."" I disagree, for while that film felt contrived and odd, ""Waking Life"" succeeds at every avenue and makes me excited about the current state of moviemaking. We can only dream that more filmmakers choose to make projects as fascinating as this... and, after all, dream is destiny.",1024531200,,1854,4.851735015772871
1805176,5,B00007AJKI,"I haven't yet bought this DVD, but very much plan on doing so.  I have always wondered, even to myself, the purpose for *buying* a movie.  Am I really going to watch it, over and over again?  There are plenty of DVD's I have bought, which I don't think I have watched since I bought them (this question, of course, becomes moot when dealing with a child's movie..since my four year old will watch Star Wars Episode One over and over..and he has relished in the menu aspect of being able to control the movie and its features... he is the new line of movie watchers: the interactive watcher).
One common feature that this DVD offers which has been used ad infinitum on most every DVD, but which I have finally found wonderfully useful on this DVD: the commentary.  It's neat knowing that the filmmakers have offered comments to run through a movie, but, except for American Beauty, I have not found the urge to use this feature.  This DVD offers a running text which gives you background on the philosophic ideas being presented, and even suggestions and excerpts from texts to consider if you want to explore a specific philosophy further.
A reviewer quoted here mentions how most of the audience walked out a third of the way through this movie when it was in the theater. I can understand that since, as a linear piece, it is quite taxing on attention span, despite the engrossing animation.  For a world conditioned to be distracted every ten minutes, it is quite a feat to sit through the movie, even for one such as I who feels he has quite a long span of attention.  This movie is ripe for DVD.  It is easy to pull out pieces to watch, stop, skip, return, repeat, in a way that even video tape could not afford.  In a way, this is a showpiece for the DVD format, which makes me wonder if other additional features could be created which were innovative to DVD... perhaps a randomizing feature which delinearized the film...hmmm.
Anyway, if you are a deep thinker and love a mind challenge, BUY it on DVD.  If your heroes are Jean Claude Van Damme, Stephen Segal, and Sylvester Stallone at his grunting best, you will be totally bored by this movie...go out and get the latest, blow-all-the-bad-guys'-guts-out Playstation game!!!",1024444800,,2234,4.604534005037784
1805177,2,B00007AJKI,"Ugh. I hate this movie more than any film I have ever seen in my life, and frankly, this film deserves it. The whole concept of this movie is one dopey looking guy wandering around and waking up from his dream, while not really waking. That's not so bad. The horrible part is a bunch of 15 year olds just finished reading Philosophy for Dummies and a few other new age books, and they want to share their horribly flawed views of the universe with horrendous leaps in logic. Oh, and they're armed with a thesaurus. It's a pretentious ""Who can use the biggest words"" game throughout, and it impresses no one. Add in a few adjectives that serve no purpose, and the result is four guys walking down the street when one shouts ""Society is choking on its own vehnile existence in a swarm of complacency"" and one replies ""We are dancing exuberance in the light of eternity!"" I think this may be an attempt to hide the fact that what they are actually talking about is very simple, and often, very silly. One man takes 10 minutes of droning on to say that leaps in human advancement are happening in shorter and shorter amounts of time, which is a decent observation, then out of nowhere he says evolution and survival of an organism will depend on truth, justice, morality, and sincerity. There are a few good speeches in there, one at the very end and a few in between, but it's hard to take any of them seriously when they describe free will and the nature of the self with healthy doses of ""like, y'know"" every other line. The only pros this movie has is the great visual style, and that it facilitates conversation (although most of the conversation will be ""WHAT THE? I HATE THIS MOVIE!""). Don't buy this. Rent it once, laugh, cry, shout, have a real discussion about the topics without the bs involved, and go on with your waking life.",1024272000,,1835,4.464285714285714
1805178,5,B00007AJKI,"Why do we dream?
Is it just a way for our brain to sift through the sights and sounds and smells and other sensations we experience in day to day life, and pack them away?
Or is there a deeper meaning? Are dreams really messages coming from the subconcious, trying to force themselves into our awareness?
Are they prophecies of events to come?
Or are dreams merely another reality, one that works much like this one except that we have no set limits, and we can see the results of our choices so much sooner?
And when you have gotten all that you can gather from the dream, whatever its purpose may be, do you decide to go on to another dream, or wake up?
For that matter, how do you wake up?
Waking Life (2001, rated R) broaches the subject in such a way that even the most intelligently skeptical cynic has to sit down and consider the possibilities. The film first grabs your attention with the surrealistic visuals, that make the viewer think of something he once dreamed about. The photographers filmed the flick digitally in the everyday Hollywood way, and the graphic artists worked their magic. The viewer sits, captivated by the individuality of the filmwork, and notices almost immediately how real the soundtrack is, in contrast with the absurdity of the visuals. As like in a dream, where one can't always believe what he sees, but can always trust what he hears.
After Waking Life was released in October 2001, Bob Sabiston, the graphic designer, was nominated for Digital Effects Artist of the Year for the 2001 American Film Institute Awards. The film was also nominated for IFP/West Independent Spirit Awards' Best Feature, Best Director, and Best Screenplay, in 2002. Waking Life won Best Experimental Film from the National Society of Film Critics, and Best Animated Film from the New York Film Critics Circle, both in 2001.
But awards don't say much about personal impact. This really is a movie that, to get the best feel for, a person has to watch. One cannot judge it by what someone else says. The film takes leaps and twists and loops where one could not anticipate... just like a dream would. Every last detail, including a mosquito, has it's very specific purpose, and it's up to the viewer to decide what it is. Waking Life takes place in a world with no beginning and no end, and where everyone speaks in quotes of Sartre, Kierkegaarde, Kafka, and Camus... and you know exactly what they all mean. At times sacrilegious, and others... just plain religious, this is a very thought-provoking, philosophizing work of art.
You really should find out for yourself just how unbelievably moving this piece is, but... if you need any more convincing, here's a quote from Roger Ebert:
""I have seen ""Waking Life"" three times now. I want to see it again--not to master it, or even to remember it better (I would not want to read the screenplay), but simply to experience all of these ideas, all of this passion, the very act of trying to figure things out. It must be depressing to believe that you have been supplied with all the answers, that you must believe them and to question them is disloyal, or a sin. Were we given minds in order to fear their questions?""",1024185600,,3182,4.653641207815276

It is not (as a generalization), a film that a strictly action fan might enjoy, but because of the captivating animation and insightful dialogue.

For some reason this jewel was overlooked for the animation category for the Oscars, which was as bad as many of the oversights that occurred this past year (Memento, Royal Tenenbaums, etc.)  The movie was filmed like any other, than the film was illustrated by a group of artists that vary stlistically, from almost hyper-realistic to cartoonish.  The characters and the scenery sometimes bob and weave on the screen creating a dream-like feel to the movie.  The dialogue is composed mostly of many monologues given to the main character (a wandering Wiley Wiggins-the young kid from Dazed and Confused).  Topics run the gamut, sparking philosophy, science, politics, morality nad life in general.  Envelope these mind-blowing illustrations and topics in the idea that Wiggins can't tell if he is awake or dreaming and you've got the most original movie I've seen in years.",1023840000,,991,5.049079754601227

I will not divulge the facts of the movie, in fear of spoiling it for anyone, but I will say that it's refreshing, the animation is spectacular and very unique, the ideas presented are thought-provoking...

This movie to me, is  not about an entire film. It's about moments. One moment. Another moment. My favorite moments are the ones that have neat endings. Like the guy talking to the boy and is mysteriously filling up a bottle with Gasoline. (Ummm  I wonder what for.) And the man in the bar ""testing"" out his gun. Those were great. Some of the conversations are forgettable. (Alot of the inbetweeen ones) The beauty is you can hate one and love another. The ugliness is that if you rewatch it ya hafta sit through it all anyway. Too bad their isn't an editing feature to include only the ones ya liked. It's a mixed film, with mixed reviews. I didn't like the lack of a plot, no tension, which frankly made me a little bored. Once the main character FINALLY gave us a reason to stick to the end, (he revealed a problem to which he wanted an answer too) It's funny how everyone is giving him all this advice but they don't tell him the ONE thing he really wants to know. (Maybe thats another point the film gives off) The beginning sets up all the rules for ya. The man driving the boat like car explains how things will proceed from then on. You're path is random and so is the movies path. The text commentary is a neat feature and will help with sources of info and other possible questions.
Is it too much at times? Yes. You hafta committ yourself to finishing it or you can easily find your way to the stop button. Rent it before you buy it.
The Animation is great but can destract at times from the talking as others have mentioned. And I need to see it again to understand the ending.
The movie does come off as a ""college"" or ""village voice"" type movie for new age hippies or stoners. It's ideas can be intruiging or laughable depending on your point of view. I enjoy that they weren't offensive, like they didn't disprove God or anything. It's very objective and you take in what you want. The film may cause discussion afterwards with friends or colleagues IF you can remember anything that was said.
It's a mixed film. It was NOT nominated for best animation because drawing on people is more of a special effect, rather then creatign from scratch which is harder to do. although I too agree with the Jimmy Neutron nomination being utter ... They should change the title too Best Children's Film. To call it best animated film is a joke since we all know the hollywood peeps don't take the time to watch anything they don't take their kids too.

1805185,5,B00007AJKI,"I've read most of the reviews of the film and there seem to be two distinct camps. The first camp rants and raves about the philosophical implications of the dialogue, while the second group dismisses the dialogue as ""sophomoric"", ""pop-culture cliche"", or just plain moronic banter. I, as the other two camps, was deeply surprised by the originality of the film via its visual presentation. But, unlike most of the viewers i think the real crux of the film doesn't lie in the individual nature of each dialogue, but rather the sum and the spectrum of the ideas that are presented. Sure, most of us have heard bits and pieces of every idea presented in the movie, but most of us have never went beyond that fringe superficial information that was given to us. This movie offers simple yet concise previews of the positive aspects of existentialism, the metaphysical aspects of the dream vs. the lucid state, the evolution of humanity as a whole, fringe political ramblings, and many other motifs that I've forgotten. I would never say that these ideas are ground breaking or have profound implications, that's because most of them are not of a novel nature and have been stated and discussed long before this movie ever came out. But the thing that makes this movie so enjoyable is the way in which these thoughts are presented, the rhetoric is superb and i found myself totally immersed in each scene. If you're a ""hardcore"" philosopher try not to scoff at the ideas that are presented and if you're an average Joe, don't be too enthralled with their ""novel"" nature, but both of you should enjoy the visual aspect of this film...:)",1023321600,,1631,4.746478873239437

The thrust of the movie is to live in the moment, totally experience it, so where it was going did not concern me.  There actually was a plot, just a very straight forward one.

1805187,4,B00007AJKI,"mine's a four 'cause god didn't write this flick. (Or did she?) Indeed, the protagonist, in the scene where he's watching the movie about holy moments, when you realize the soul you're talking with is god manifested in mortal form, he's watching the movie, and get this--his face becomes the face of god, some kind of Inca fire god. For if god is omniscient, god needs to know what it's like to be you, including your aspect that doesn't know you're god. God thinks she's you, while she's you. Why choose this fragmentary fate, being ants and people reviewing this movie with the consciousness of ants? Because god chose life and not death. Not that ants don't have a sublime consciousness--a hundred thousand of them can coordinate the manufacture of an intricately nested tunnel-permeated nest, which seems like more than the people who rip on this movie as being superficial and meaningless have going on in their skulls. OK--I admit, taste in art varies crazily from spirit to spirit. Beauty may be truly relative and subjective, incapable of being shared, except by telepathy, which as Ethan Hawke explicates, is a real possibility in a world where rats can learn mazes faster when thousands of other rats in far away labs have already learned them. Beauty may be such that these reviewers can't see it in a film which at parts is as highly crafted as Dali or Monet, or maybe even subtler, because of the real human substrate behind the animation, a variable that makes the facial morphisms uncannily evocative, perhaps even more interesting than actual faces, due to artistic freedom, which normal people only have partial control over in the everyday life of their face expressions. The writing in this film has been variously attacked by these people as philisophical, as undergraduate, as pop-theoretical, as stonerist, as trivial, as primitive, as overly complex, indecipherable, blatantly obvious and heavy-handed. In short, the negative reviewers have used their own limitations, fears, and prejudices to brew up invective whose intensity bespeaks the possible validity of the film, given the personalities behind the attacks. I'll try to address the criticism. One--philosophers are not out-of-touch, abstract eggheads spouting irrelevancies from safe within their ivory towers. Instead, I have learned that they are people, damned by bigots merely because their brains are capable of intricacies unavailable to the average sheep--people with often truly elegant explanatory ability, who dedicate their lives to sharing their discoveries with each other or the rest of us, discoveries they consider meaningful and useful. They are sharers. And that's what the world needs, if you think it needs anything in the way of help. (Some view business as usual as a special gift, without realizing their luck of birth could have been different, leaving them in predicaments unspeakably tragic). Two--undergraduates are not the stupidest folk around. So labeling this movie's dialogue such is not really a criticism. There are youngsters whose poetic skills, musical inventiveness, spiritual spirituality, strength of vision, and so on rival, I dare say, what these critics can even dream of. This film is attacked by people who don't dream well. People who can only see what they've already seen. And we can probably submit to reality and say this is as it should be. We want to bother the critics in any way possible. Making them watch the faces of god, listen to the voices of angels and devils, think about things actually worth thinking about, is perhaps fitting punishment. Those who yearn for movies, like intravenous opiate drips, which ""entertain"" and ""comfort"" their fragile mentalities, can't be really told anything about the higher levels of human existence. They simply don't believe how good thought can be for people like the characters in this movie, who are farther above the sheep than the sheep are above ants. Should we even suppose the anti-waking-life critics are conscious? What do they do that would lead us to believe they are not automatons? What's going on in there besides darkness and twistedly pathetic computation? They may be artificial, but never intelligent. But what do i know--I'm lucky enough to have eliminated this type of critic from my immediate vicinities--I only know them through their sickening diatribes in venues like this. PleaSe tell me I'm wrong. I want to be. I know we live in a giant robot-world, eating nature and producing mostly misery--but I wish that most of the human moviegoers were not robots themselves. Proponents of strong AI may say There's nothing wrong with being a robot--leave them alone--they have merely been programmed a bit wrongly by insignificant and unenviable childhoods--you'd hate this film if you were one of them. Here we go, with the grace of god. I've been told not to listen to the negative ones. I guess i'm just programmed to take reviews seriously, even if their authors don't deserve to see Waking LIfe, let alone have access to DVD's, MAC machines, fast food, spectator sports and all the other lovely elements of their lives, which they can't examine, but which they force us to examine here when we're trying to contemplate what it means to see real artists doing their thing as delicately and powerfully as they can possibly struggle to do.

1805188,5,B00007AJKI,"This is a brave movie, and for me, it struck VERY close to home (as you'll see below). What might at first seem like playful pretentions - the animation, the intense monologues connected by lethargic ramblings - actually turn out to be not just artifice but ART. And I capitalize the word ART intentionally. And what I mean by ART is this: its gimmicks, its obtuseness, its force, its visual and verbal games all turn out to be valuable and significant symbols. It is animated for a reason. It is alternately ambling and in your face for a reason. It is mercurial and personal and universal for a reason. And as with all good art, they are good reasons. ""Waking Life"" poignantly explores useful and ingenious perspectives of how we perceive the world both personally and impersonally, feeling at once fully aware and half asleep, sometimes engaged and sometimes apathetic, trying to make sense of what others think makes sense to them. This theme is central to the film, I think, and it is profound: how do we make sense of what others think makes sense to them?
Let me pose that question again: how do we make sense of what others think makes sense to them? What makes sense objectively? And what keeps us feeling sporadically nonsensical and thus alone in our thoughts, whether or not we're asleep or awake? How are we together? And how are we alone?
Like Linklater, I spent lots of years in central Austin. I saw ""Slacker"" when it came out and realized I was surrounded, at the corner of 15th and Nueces, by places where that radically quirky movie had been filmed. Also like Linklater, I immersed myself in the intellectual riches of UT, the University of Texas, that bastion of not-so-ivory towers that grows at the northern end of Linklater's cinematic neighborhood. (Indeed, I could swear that he used my bare-board duplex with the white French doors and that white swinging door for the interiors of the protagonist's home in Waking Life. What a STRANGE sense of deja vu /'am I dreaming' THAT sent through me!) The point is, I feel Linklater has successfully captured that central Austin milieu successfully, in its tawdry and brainy extremes, outwardly and in my mind... How am I connected to you? How am I alone?
And onto that milieu, Linklater has added a rich tapestry of the profound themes I mentioned above. (A cross between ""Waiting for Godot"" and ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas""?) That all those words can wear you out means it's worth a few go 'rounds at least.
I happened to see the VHS version of this film. But it is the kind of film that immediately makes a curious or enthusiastic (or mystified) viewer want to hear what the director and production staff have to say. It is, like ""What Dreams May Come?"", ""Pleasantville"", and ""Moulin Rouge"", a film where behind-the-scenes explorations of screenplay development, technique and production decisions prove fascinating. So I'm getting the DVD to have access to all of that additional material. It will be worth it, as I plan to encourage my friends and movie/idea loving acquaintances to see and think about the artistry that is ""Waking Life.""",1022544000,,3114,4.757855822550832

That may just be possible because that's almost one of the underlying messages of the movie.  Have you ever had a dream, then awoke, and realized that some of the things people said to you were really profound, but then realized that it all must have come out of your own head, because it was your dream?  This is defiantly a movie for two types of people; Animation buffs who will simply go ga-ga over the interesting techniques and symbols which are spattered throughout the canvas of this film, and two modern day philosophers who are obsessed with the continuum of the dream realm.  In my opinion no indi-film is flawless.  There were instances where I would start to wonder, and think about other things.  But that seems to be what the movie is trying to get the audience to do.  My favorite part of the movie is the broad spectrum of people who are submitting their thoughts on the subject at hand.  I am sure everybody will have a favorite character, and everybody will have a least favorite character, but i am also sure that very few people will have the same ides on which those characters are.

1805191,1,B00007AJKI,"The Waking Life team has undercut George Lucas's business model. Mr. Lucas spends several hundred million dollars creating a world so compelling that people flock to it despite an an incoherent plot, superficial characters, and sophomoric dialog.
J. C. Shakespeare et al. create their world on a much more modest budget. The method is tape some random writers/professors/sages/street poets -- some stoned crazy, some just naturally bizarre, all spouting some nonsense -- with a hand held camcorder, digitize the footage into a Macintosh, and have animators paint over each frame in colorful and artistic ways. If the sage gesticulates at lot, the hands are exaggerated, if he flashes his eyes, the eyes and so on.
Like Lucas, the result is merely eye candy. Although the target audiences are very different, the acid test for both is to ask, ""What would be left if the visual pyrotechnics were removed?"" In both cases, very little. If you want to see a great movie about dreams, try Kurosawa's ""Dreams"".

On top of that, there's the whole ""plot"" of the movie, if you could call it that, but it has you thinking and wondering about the very existence of the main character and what it is and what that means. Anyway, long-winded but you get the picture. So I think the two of us probably got about 25 other people to go see it, and they kept coming back to us and talking about it.

1805195,3,B00007AJKI,"This truly bizarre film recounts a dreamer's dream, and so many repeated ""false awakenings"" that, eventually, the dreamer panics and begins to believe that he may never awaken (i.e. he may be trapped in his dream state or might be experiencing the after-life). The ending of the film provides a convincing clue as to what is really happening but it takes a LONG time (about 3/4 of the way through) for the film to build any kind of dramatic tension whatsoever. At one point our hero (a zero-personality slacker-type) laments that he is trapped in a dream that ""seems to go on and on endlessly"" and, by that point, the viewer will feel exactly same way about the film. I could only take this film in increments of 10 to 15 minutes.
Sure, the ideas that pelt the viewer are pretty cool. Sermons about the nature of existence, time, memory, predestination, the after-life, 'lucid' dreaming, libertarianism, and constant name-dropping references to gnostic philosophers from Kierkegard to Sci-Fi icon Phillip K. Dick(!) literally bury the viewer's mind. It's one thing to show a ""dream movie"" that, by its plot and characters, demonstrates and hints at such ideas and quite another to present a film that ham-fistedly explains such ideas over and over and over again. Maybe a little mixing of plot, along with maybe half of the monologues, would have made this film a tad more watchable. Instead, what we get is a constant, almost haranguing, certainly tiring, barrage of explanations about philosophies and various musings from the cultural fringe. They might as well have hired the philosophers and ""culturalists"" themselves to blather on and on about their ideas. Gee, I guess that's exactly what they did for almost the entire film. My favorite pseudo-intellectual-guy is the monkey who drones on and on about how language is a poor medium to explain cultural phenomena(!?). What about bad film? I suppose these guys were on a limited budget (like every other Linklater film) so there's no point complaining too much.
Despite the above misgivings, though, the film is saved by the DVD format. The DVD special features, especially the sub-titled commentary to the main film, truly help the viewer understand some context to the endless monologues and provide some cover for the script-writers. Also, the visual effects are pretty unique and the techniques used here are bound to show up repeatedly in commercials and other film offerings in the future. Unfortunately, the crux of this movie's problem is that it throws too much weird animation and too many different ideas about the meaning of life at the viewer and not enough of what makes a film great: interesting characters and a diverting plot. Neither are present here. Somewhere buried in the animations and ruminations of 'Waking Life' there might be a great movie.

THis is better as an audio commentary. Just listen to the conversations, which were actually pretty interesting, and not watch the animation. Unless you are a serious animation fan that appreciate all kinds of animation, I don't think you will fully appreciate this movie.

1805203,3,B00007AJKI,"Well, for the most part, anyway.  There are a couple of monologues here that rise slightly above the level of a mediocre second-year student, though none could be accused of being profound or particularly insightful.  (It is a testament to the intellectual poverty of our times that so many viewers think otherwise.)  Sex and drugs (mostly sex) would have greatly livened this movie.  They would have fit in well, too, since they are as natural a part of the sophomore's life as waxing sophomorically philosophical.  Of course, something with philosophical depth might have served the auteur's pretenses better.  But the fact is that movies cannot do serious intellectual work; they consist, after all, of pictures, noises, and music.  (Speech, too, of course; but that takes second place to the pretty colors and sounds.)  This is probably why introductory philosophy courses haven't yet been reduced to offering cartoon enactments of Plato's dialogues, though I have little doubt that a comic-book version is on the way.
Not that the movie is all bad.  It contains several moderately amusing scenes, and the unique visual style is both soothing and alluring.  The plot--or complete lack thereof--makes it an easy ride, very like a pleasant dream.  Watch it late at night, preferably when you are either very tired or on pot, and with someone you find sexually appealing.

1805204,3,B00007AJKI,"""Waking Life"" is an unusual and rather bizarre animated film that many critics, including Roger Ebert, thought was one of 2001's best. I don't agree, though I can't deny that it's challenging and ambitious. A challenge that one person finds exhilarating is one another finds irritating. Or, in my case, frustrating and exhausting.
Cult director Richard Linklater took his digital camera and filmed a tale about a young man who finds himself in a dream from which he can't awake up. With the help of computers and several animators, these live images were then drawn over to create a colorful and surreal world. The visual results are interesting and artistic. These aspects I enjoyed.
As the young man dreams on, he encounters strangers who tell him their theories about the meaning of existence. Many intellectual ideas are covered, including existentialism, the theory of time, evolution, and free will. The man eventually comes to his own conclusion. I have always enjoyed free ranging debates about who we think we are and why we are on this earth. The problem for me is that you can't have a debate with a movie. It can only present its point of view and, thus, can be only one-sided. Since the main character in ""Waking Life"" sits passively and listens for the most part, there is little debate even within the movie. Some viewers, like Mr. Ebert, thought the characters sage and enlightening. I found them pretentious because most of what they say isn't so much intellectual as it is an assemblage of trendy pop culture theories. Of course, I couldn't tell them so.",1020902400,,1572,4.847583643122676

1805206,3,B00007AJKI,"... possibly too much to absorb.
I'm so glad that Richard Linklater made THIS movie.  I think it's akin to something Kubrick might have tried if he were a young film-maker today (not that it's all that Kubrickian, but it's such a bold undertaking in terms of ideas and technology , it's similar to the experimental advances forged with ""2001"").  I also think this will prove a benchmark movie, 20 years from now, when we can re-examine the point in cinematic history when digital methods became more widespread -- ""Waking Life"" is a bit like a metaphysical ""Steamboat Willie"" in that sense.
And the ideas the film addresses are truly interesting.  A lot of critics have rapped on it for sounding like a lot of stoned, 'college student navel gazing,' but they're just jaded.  College is generally the last time most of us have a chance to talk and think in philosophical terms.  In a world where most of us are locked into thinking about our jobs or our daily concerns 24/7, what's wrong with listening to characters talking about slightly more esoteric ideas and concepts?  In that respect, ""Waking Life"" ALMOST makes up for Linklater's other movie this year, the heavy-handed and aggressively knuckleheaded ""Tape.""
Plus, this is a beautiful movie.  The animation is basic but sly and expressive, the colors are rich, and it's neat to see cinematography subjected to animation -- the film is worth watching just to see the way the artists play with light they're animating over.
But having said all that, the film may be too much.  You're trying to watch and keep track of the images (which are busy and constantly changing), you're trying to absorb and process complicated dialogue on top of complicated dialogue, and you're also trying to just keep it all straight.  Basically, this is a movie that REQUIRES repeat viewings and yet... something about its basic density also discourages repeat viewings.  I watched ""Waking Life"" two days ago and enjoyed it... but I can't say I'm in a big hurry to rewind it and start all over again.
Perhaps this will be a movie that grows on me more over time, perhaps it'll be a film that I watch once a year and get something new from gradually.  ""Slacker"" certainly is, but ""Slacker"" also has a flesh-and-blood immediacy and a sense of fun to it that ""Waking Life,"" due to its own innovation, simply doesn't exude.  Nevertheless, love it or hate it, this is a movie that will be discussed and referenced well into the future.
(Just a note: this year, the Academy finally created an award for animated features; ""Waking Life"" was not nominated in that category; ""Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius"" was.  I have 36 blisteringly smart remarks about that fact but I can't chose a favorite so I won't write down any of them)",1020643200,,2750,4.740041928721174
1805207,5,B00007AJKI,"This is a brilliant and highly original animated film, directed by Richard Linklater. It is definitely not a children's movie, not because it contains ""adult"" themes, but because it is very verbal and intellectual. It is actually a series of discussions on philosophical topics. The unifying theme is dreaming. The protaganist is a young man who cannot seem to wake from his dream. As he encounters many eccentrics, who expound on existentialism, evolution and rebellion (real life conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is the voice of a rabble rouser), he gradually realizes he is having a long lucid dream (a lucid dream being a dream where you know you are dreaming). Can he ever wake up? Are dreams and waking really separate worlds? The highly creative and original animation provides a superb visual counterpart to the film's intellectualism, which would be a little dry if it was just people talking to each other. In this manner the film satisfies both sides of the brain. The voices are entertaining and diverse; among them are Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who starred in Before Sunrise, another Linklater film.

1805209,5,B00007AJKI,"This is such an incredibly beautiful and thought invoking movie.
A lot of the themes and topics of discussion in the movie (which is more in form like the Dialogues that were oh so vogue with philosophers in the old days like Plato and so on) are by no means the sort of things you would overhear in a Mc Donald's or at the Blockbuster; discussions that if you were to bring them up with your friends at the bar it would most definitely sour the mood of those around you: reality, memory, the conflict of science and religion, death, and so on. There is most often too much white noise and distraction in our lives to bring out the things in the open that a lot of us think of within ourselves, and they end up being our pretentious little thoughts that have no true beginnings and endings. The ramblings of a consciousness that drifts towards a final destination, yet fades away in darkness- and so on. And so on.
And so on- this movie is often remarked as being pretentious: going to many places at one time; never exactly sure what it's saying, so it says everything it can. Yet this is a film which explores those things in life which we may never have a hope of answering. How can you know death till you are dead? You can be as poetic and eloquent as you want, use your metaphors- you do not know a thing. All you can do is talk, and talk, and talk. And that is exactly what this movie does: talk.
What truly disgusts me is that the Academy Awards (a ""ceremony"" which is far beyond that line of self-parody and is now bargain-binned into oblivion) overlooked this film in the Animated Feature category. I say overlooked loosely since it is obvious that this film is far beyond the minds of those who take such award shows seriously... No, how can you suggest that the nature of reality is of no importance to the average person?? Do those who hold no interests in art have no anxiety towards dying, as well?  Is there any less angst in some then others? This is a movie for every man, woman and child, about the things which we all wonder within and keep like a secret to ourselves. Have you ever wondered if a body sleeps and never wakes up after it dies? Of course you have. We cannot all be Zen masters, and hypnotize ourselves into not being afraid of what lies beyond the dark. This is a movie that brings those things out- and has been ostracized for it.  This is a movie (very much like Dazed and Confused) about being trapped and, triumphantly, escaping into... who knows?
The last frame of the film, where the hero floats into blurring light is the end of this life. An end of bodily functions like intelligence which only add to the pretentiousness of living. It is an end that has a beginning. Raymond Moody, who has spent the better part of his life studying people on their deathbeds, those who were terminally dead for a few minutes, and so on- said something like ""I don't really know what happens after you die. I don't think there is anything that really gives the experience justice you can say about dieing. After all these years, the closest I ever got to defining it is that its like watching TV for a long time, and then changing the channel- and even that by no means even scratches the surface of the true experience."" Poe also said ""All of this just seems as but a dream within a dream""",1020470400,,3317,4.35702746365105
1805210,4,B00007AJKI,"Richard Linklater's animated philosophical discourse, ""WAKING LIFE"" is similar to his ""Slackers"" in its meanderings and musings.  However, this time around the visuals perfectly match the subject matter and in fact sometimes are the subject. This highly original and admittedly weird film is also a reaction and reflection of our drowning in the overwhelming ""information age"" wave that is sweeping down on western civilization.  All the characters in the Buddhistic implied puzzles of ""Waking Life"" one way or another circle around the central questions of How best to find meaning? And even more importantly, How to discern what is real?  It's the old, ""Am I awake or dreaming I'm awake Zen"" koan that's working full throttle here but in a slick digital mode.
In his non-linear quest for fundamental answers, our hero (Wiley Wiggins from ""Dazed and Confused"") encounters animated Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, Steven Soderbergh, and Adam Goldberg among others.  The striking animation itself is a digital technique that paints over live action footage...  The style is extremely eye-catching and carries one over the more tedious passages of philosophical discourse and naval pondering.
About 15 minutes before the end, there's a great, theological riff by the animated Linklatter -- he's a minor character in the film -- about Philip K. Dick, the nature of time's illusion, God, and free will. Thought provoking and quite beautiful.

1805217,5,B00007AJKI,"This is a masterpiece.  At first it seems that the animation is merely an intro; however it carries on and sets a trippy mood.  The basic idea is Dreams Within Dreams.  Like a chocolate cake, Linklater must dig his way out of multiple layers of dreaming to finally wake.
Along the way there is a ton of philosophy dealing with reality, fate, free will, divinity, and existence.  When will he finally awaken?  Not before passing through an almost hilariously heavy load of mysticism.  Characters levitate and light switches won't turn off, lending proof that, indeed, he is in a dream world.  The dialogue is very dense here; it almost feels like a book at times.  There are very controversial questions that many an intellectual may have asked him/herself at some time:  what comes after death?  Is life but a dream?  Do we have control over our destiny or is atomic physics in control of our decisions and our actions?  These heavy questions are sure to open up some mental floodgates.
I found it hilarious that Linklater packed the film with dialogue relating to libertarianism.  Characters advocate free will throughout.  Angry political protesters complain about too much statism.  The animation moves about on the screen, suggesting hallucinogenic drug use.  And there is talk of using firearms to fight back against tyranny--one of the more revolutionary beliefs held by some modern libertarians.  If you share this ideology you'll be cheering and applauding in the theater like the audience did at my sitting.
If you like Kevin Smith this is a great choice.  If you want an original style film with almost no developed plot, you may vibe here.  If you have ever questioned reality or personal autonomy you will find out you're not alone.  And if you voted for Harry Browne in the last election I doubt you'll disagree with the political sentiment expressed by the people.

1805220,4,B00007AJKI,"The problem with most of the promotional and review material associated with this film is that it all seems to take the same starting point: namely, that Waking Life is a prettily-animated philosophical [insert preferred euphemism for ""self-abuse"" here] session. I'll concede that a large amount of time is devoted to just such activity, but I posit that Waking Life also functions as a Zen adventure story and a rather wry comedy (with humor ranging from black to cute).
I took my sister and her BF to see this one at the Capitol (OFS) Theater (Olympia's arthaus of champions), expecting (as various reviews had portrayed the movie) something pretty, largely incoherent, and pretentious enough to provide plenty of unintentional fun. But WL actually posesses both plot and structure, and although some of the individual encounters the main character is involved in carry something of a pretentious air, the overall story is simple, well-integrated into the disjointed structure dictated by the overarching theme of dreaming, and (I thought) rather beautiful.
Similarly, the wry humor of the movie should be mentioned in any review of WL. Many of the chuckles are character-based, like the 'go-for-broke' beer salute of the biker/dreamwalker, or the riotous cynicism of the gas-station attendent (neither my sister nor I can even think about microwavable burritos anymore without remembering his story about the vision-quester), but the occasional gonzo visual jest or uncomfortable giggle are sure to make their appearance.
Finally, I'd like to say that the Phil 101 course-supplement material should be neither overvalued nor undervalued. In response to those who praise WL as the most! significant! movie! ever!, I'd like to remind that nothing particularly new is presented here, and that enlightenment-seekers would be better off hitting the shelves. To those who write it all off as simply pretentious wankery, I argue that it actually serves a purpose within the spare narrative that the movie is based around, and that although none of it is intended to be accepted at face value by the audience, contemplating the steady flow of 'ideas on feet' can have an overall mind-opening effect that helps us to identify with the drifting main character.
Anyhow, I was thoroughly entertained by this movie while watching it, and it left me with a fair amount to talk about afterwards (including the topic of lucid dreaming, which can be a rewarding investigation). Not only that, but it's very much unlike anything else I've seen recently, which makes it a nice palate-cleanser for the entertainment taste buds. 4 stars, and I'm buying it when it hits DVD.",1015027200,,2655,5.176744186046512
1805221,5,B00007AJKI,"""Waking Life"" is an animated film written and directed by Richard Linklater. It's quite different from the typical commercially-oriented animated film. ""Waking Life"" follows the philosophical odyssey of a main character (voiced by Wiley Wiggins) as he engages in a series of conversations and surreal experiences. There are some additional scenes featuring other characters.
The very talky script is intriguingly complemented by the striking animation. The scenes constitute a visual poetry that is frequently quite stunning and beautiful; the animation style varies in different scenes, thus giving an additional diversity and appeal to the film. The filmmakers use the animation medium to incorporate some clever ""special effects"" into the film.
The conversations deal with many topics: the relationship between dreams and reality; human evolution; the nature and funtion of art; identity; transcendence; etc. There are some dark and violent scenes, as well as some very tender and moving moments.
Wiley Wiggins gives an outstanding vocal performance as the primary character; he brings a youthful earnestness and likeability to the role. Overall, I found ""Waking Life"" to be a truly unique and intriguing film; I highly recommend it to serious filmgoers.",1014681600,,1257,5.621052631578947

The visual style of the movie is also quite attention-getting: it was filmed live-action and then animated (rotoscoped) using the live-action as a template of sorts. Each animator who worked on the film (and there was a whole herd of them) was able to use his or her own style. The result is a movie that constantly shifts between various styles of animation.

1805227,5,B00007AJKI,"When I saw this film, this chimera, this animated marathon philosophy slam, over a quarter of the audience walked out in the middle of it. Some may have suffered motion sickness from the perpetual fluidity of the images; this isn't a movie best watched from the front row. But as I sat transfixed by the magic on the screen, (just one long parade of talking heads - but what talk! and what heads!) my fleeing comrades put me in mind of the teenagers at the prom in Back to the Future, recoiling in horror from a guitar played in Hendrix style. Those Chuck Berry hounds thought they knew what rock 'n' roll was; and we think we know what movies are. But Linklater is here to teach us different.
I could write a dozen reviews, trying to explain what's unique and wonderful about this film, without repeating myself. What follows is a random sample.
The title embodies a triple pun, reminiscent of the layered meanings of the title ""Finnegans Wake"". Like Joyce's skewed opus, ""Waking Life"" examines life, on a huge canvas, from the perspective of a dreamer, a dreamer caught up in a seemngly endless stream of babble. Like Joyce, Linklater uses an elaborate artistic form which attempts to duplicate the structure of dreams - in particular, the way that every dream is a palimpsest, in which dim and dimmer meanings underlie the ones on the surface. Where Joyce tried to pack the multiple meanings in by using jumbled and confusing ""portmanteau words"" that sounded like several words at once, Linklater lets a series of monologues, each one straightforward and some even obsessionally single-minded, mirror and bounce off one another until each is undergirded by the three dimensional scaffolding of all the rest.
Ostensibly the subject of all this talk is dreaming and waking up. But it's also about waking to higher consciousness, about speech itself, about movies themselves as a form of speech and a form of dream. Taken at a literal level, the movie is a little paradise for anyone who really enjoys *listening* to people. Even though the talk is all of abstractions, in each case it's about ideas with which the speaker is deeply and personally engaged; so that lives are spread before us and souls laid bare. It's like having Studs Terkels' ""Working"", with its varied gallery of talkers from every station of life, as a documentary rather than as a book, except that now the working title would be ""Thinking.""
Sure, much of the talk is sophomoric. A sophomore is a wise fool, and all Linklater's talkers qualify; whether ""wise"" or ""fool"" is the operative moiety of the oxymoron is up to the viewer. But it is revelatory, in each case, of the person we're listening to; and the polyphony melds into a symphony that beggars its parts. All these voices - together with the lovely self-effacing score - make the soundtrack into a coherent poem cycle that would be worth the price of the DVD on its own.
Visually, Linklater has succeeded in putting on screen for the very first time a ""dream sequence"" which is genuinely dreamlike -- not like the romanticized image of what dreams are like in old tin pan alley tunes, and not like Freudian or Jungian symbolfests. Mullholland Drive raises such conventions to a luminous new level, but even in Lynch's hands they remain film conventions without the real feel of dreams. But this film is like the dreams we actually have each night, or would if we were much smarter and more interesting people. For example, dreams seem photographically real while we're in them - but are in fact lacking in almost all the detail of the waking visual field. Linklater duplicates this experience with his rotoscoping: a photographically real substrate is drained of its detail by drawing flat cartoons over it. And that's just one of many authentic dream characteristics cannily built into the celluloid here.
It remains to be seen whether this scrumptious tour-de-force, once it's begun to be absorbed, will change the way movies are made in the future, or whether it will stand forever as the only member of its genre. But if any film made in 2001 is still admired, studied and taught in 2051, it will be this one.",1010793600,,4145,4.766342141863699

purpose. WAKING LIFE was nothing more then a movie were someone had a great idea for a
interesting concept and that was all.  The film would have worked as a 15 minute short film (tops).
It was almost comically pretentious and the script writer seemed to being trying to be ultra-
philosophical on a subject that is not deep enough to talk about as long as they did.  The question
the film asks is one asked over and over- one that simply makes you go ""hmm?""  and nothing
more.  It was almost like watching people pretend to be intellectual who were not.  This film was
insulting to intelligent audience members and was one of the very worse movies I have ever seen.

1805232,4,B00007AJKI,"Waking Life is a dense, difficult to digest, series of monologues that address the most profound, timeless questions: is there an afterlife? how do dreams relate to our lives? and of course, what is the meaning of life?  Instead of answering these questions directly, a variety of personalities are employed to offer different perspectives, helping the protaganist slowly develop his own philosophy while he begins to question the very nature of his existence.
This film seems formally related most closely to 'Slacker,' an earlier Linklater film, but where the latter seems more like an amibitious student exercise, Waking Life is a complete, yet flawed, masterpiece.  Both films use the same basic formula of narrating through a sequence of disparate characters, as opposed to a using traditional plots and three-act formats.  At the end of Slacker, you are left with the feeling that it could just as well go on as it could end, that none of the details are particulatly necessary; essentially its a day in the life of someone in Texas.  At the end of Waking Life, you see the significance of (most of) all that precedes it.
The animation style at first made me a bit uneasy, but I adjusted quickly and it became apparent that it was an integral part of the 'dream-like' atmosphere of the film.
The monologues are mostly quite heavy and referential, and difficult to fully digest.  At the end of the movie, I was completely exhausted, but I wanted to see it again so that I could try to pick up the bits that went over my head.",1008547200,,1530,4.758490566037736

As I watched the movie it initially reminded me of the intense philosophical discussions that are often induced by ""getting high"" and the freeform way that conversations seem to progress. While I agree with these favorable reviews, I did not at the end of the movie see these as random thoughts at all. The main character that appeared to be dreaming or waking through the movie by the end I was convinced had followed his life from a young age at the beginning, tracing the memories of his life, only to realize in the end that he was not awakening from sleep. Instead he was revisiting his memories before leaving earth, gradually letting go of his life & body now able to accept his death. It was comforting for me to think that maybe this is the way it could be for all of us sooner or later... or maybe I'm just crazy.",1008288000,,905,4.298245614035087
1805234,5,B00007AJKI,"Maybe the greatest thing you can find in a film sometimes, is the need to simply see and explore it again.  WAKING LIFE is one of those films that will take a long time to grow old, although for much of the present megaplex audiences, it also may take long time to grow on them.  This is not a traditional narritive film, and it shouldn't be.  It is a simple journey of walking through one man's dreams, and exploring those dreams with a passion and fire for life that few films lately have possessed.  Director Richard Linklater has made an astounding ode to exploration, both in the technical sense (the unbelievably breathtaking animation and digital camerawork), and the fluid movement of a non-narritive story filled to the brim with interstingly old and new ideas.  There is never a moment when the viewer will not be bombarded with amazing visuals, thought provoking ideas, and an all around feel for life and living.  True, there is no real action in this story, and at times it merely drifts from one conversation to the next with no inbetween.  It certainly does not possess John Fords A/B style of filmmaking.  The result, of course, is that this film is not going to match everyone's tastes.  However, for anyone ready to remember or discover that our life and dreams are wonderful and art in and of themselves, this film is more than perfect.  For eveyone else, it may not be the best film you'll ever see, but it's garunteed to make you think and put you in awe of the animation.",1007856000,,1493,4.578947368421052

I would enjoy to watch it for the mind-expansion, but it can wear you down in a dark movie theater.  I had to go after about an hour of watching it.  I can sleep at home.

1805236,5,B00007AJKI,"Waking Life is about people talking. It's also about the difference between life and death, realities and dreams. Some will find it boring because people just sit around and talk. And I can sympathize with these viewers. Don't expect great oratory, or deep philosophy. It's just different people going off at the mouth.
But if you can get beyond that, the film has a lot going for it. Of course, there is the animation of the film, which has gotten the rave reviews. But what works for me is how there is a very small, but very suggestive plot poking its head out of all the dialogues. I won't give it all away, but suffice it to say that all the talk about dreams and reality is really about the situation of the protagonist: is he dreaming? is he awake? What is happening to him?
The films is slow, but I like that. It helps communicate the tension he feels as the movies rolls along. Dreams are not easily controlled and the film conveys that perfectly.
I also like some of the dialogues and the gentle feel of the movie in general. You get situationist quotes, angry hate speech and snippets of Garcia Lorca. The movies is like a buffet of neat talk wrapped in innovative animation. Add the suggestive ending of the movie, and you get a winner.",1007251200,,1248,4.454148471615721

Now, if you enjoy a challenge, this flick functions on three levels. First, those with an eye for detail will appreciate the rotoscopic animation which is nothing short of a live action impressionism that Monet would have revelled in. There's tons of dreamy details in the background which reward multiple viewings. Secondly, the script is wall to wall with complex ideas and philosphies that you stop thinking about when you no longer have the luxery of late night chat sessions to ruminate on them. Very unlike the watered down stuff we're spoon fed in contemporary pop culture, it's a surprise to remind yourself you can still think this way without benefit of mind-altering substances. The philisophy lessons are further complicated by the urgent rythm of the dialog - each idea is like a cry for help. Finally, the overall narrative is almost impossible to distinguish if you're paying too much attention to the rest so be warned because it is there.

1805240,5,B00007AJKI,"Be forwarned that this is not a conventional film or even a conventional animated film.  The film has no plot and no climax.
This film takes the viewer into the dreams of a man in his twenties who is a deep philosophical thinker.  The viewer gets the sense that he is floating around the place eavesdropping on conversations.  Most of the main character's dreams involve dialogues of a philosophical nature which at times becomes rather abstruse.  I found a few conversations very difficult to follow.  I did get the gist of what most of the characters were saying however.  Some of the characters sounded like PhDs in philosophy and literature and some sounded like everyday people discussing profound ideas but were making their points in awkward roundabout ways.  Regardless of what the characters were talking about or doing they all seemed like real people who were passionate about what they were saying and or doing.  (...)
Only a specialist in metaphysics or someone who is well read in profound philosophical ideas will be able to follow all of the dialogue in this film after the first time watching it.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but most people in my opinion will hate it as most people do not talk like the characters in the film.

1805242,4,B00007AJKI,"""Waking Life"" completes (continues?) the walking-and-talking trilogy Richard Linklater started with ""Slackers"" and took up again with ""Before Sunrise"".  It owes much to the form and content of those previous movies, borrowing ""Slackers""s disjointed structure and ""Before Sunrise""s unabashed romanticism.  Only this time it's not a romance between a man and a woman, but between one man's sleeping and waking life.
For me, initially, this was a tough film to engage with.  The first third was terribly boring to sit through; at times it was a tough fight to keep my drooping eyes from closing for good.  The friend I saw it with wasn't as lucky, for I caught her napping early on (she later admitted that the nap I saw was actually her third, and this was during the film's first half hour!).  Frankly, this sleepiness should be expected, for the first ""act"" consists entirely of Wiley Wiggins encountering various random, verbose individuals, whom all ramble on about their great philosophical theories.  Combine the droning nature of the dialogue, the very liquid backgrounds (the animation was beautiful, true, but very hypnotic; like watching the ocean on a breezy day), and a meandering anti-narrative, and you get a sleep inducing movie.
This first third was like listening to someone's long, boring dream, an observation that Linklater, appearing near the end as himself, actually cops to.  Kudos to him for admitting the inherent flaw in his movie (This flaw is also alluded to when Steven Soderbergh, in a brief cameo, tells an anecdote about how Billy Wilder described Louis Malle's upcoming $2.5 million dream-within-a-dream movie as a ""$2.5 million loss"").  However, even though the film is preachy, pretentious, long-winded, and droning at times, I give Linklater credit for including such off-beat discussion in his relatively mainstream movie.
The movie takes a drastic turn around halfway through, when Wiggins' character experiences dream lucidity in a ""Holy Moment"".  I'll not spoil how, for it was, for me, the most exhilarating moment of the movie.  Needless to say, from this point on he is no longer a passive listener, but is allowed to engage the people he meets in thought provoking discussion. It picks up some much needed energy from this moment.  The movie changes from being a series of boring lectures (reminded me of school!) to a series of fascinating social discourses (in one of the scenes that doesn't involve Wiggins, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy seemingly revive their ""Before Sunrise"" roles, going so far as to quote their prior selves regarding a discussion they had in that movie about the division of the soul as the world's population increases -- it's much more fascinating than the way I describe it here, trust me).
The animation is impressive and necessary for the kind of movie this is (in an interview, Linklater admitted that if live-action characters spoke his trippy dialogue, the audience would be hard-pressed to believe; the animation allows him to go off on tangents, work through absurd trains of thought, and generally make as much or as little sense as he wanted, just as a real dream would).  The visuals do take a while to get used to, though.  In the beginning I found myself noticing the technique more than paying attention to the dialogue.  If you let yourself, the minutiae that the artists include in the background can be quite engrossing.  That being said, with a new toy like this a lot more could have been done, which would have been distracting.  Linklater reins in his animators with a fine sense of restraint, not allowing them to go wild and fully exploit the animation to any extreme, but only go far enough to show a glimpse of its magnificent possibilities.  I was grateful for this.
""Waking Life"" is a unique movie-going experience, at least for me.  I left the theatre confused, disoriented, and mildly disappointed.  It is only after 12 hours of reflection that I realize the particular genius here.  I can't stop thinking about what it all means, and am truly glad that I saw the film.",1005264000,,4065,4.967551622418879

It is a film for the viewer who feels shackled by commercialism each time they purchase a movie ticket.  It is a film for the person who wants to lets his spirits soar, It is for the person, who really thinks there is more to the universe than McDonalds, George Bush, or the Taliban.  It is for the viewer who has this unfulfilled dream that films are a way of feeding the soul.
It is also an astoundingly beautiful experience flowing with the images that are constantly one step ahead of your expectation.

1805245,4,B00007AJKI,"The entire film is rotoscoped, with additional computer and traditional animation added, resulting in a veritable feast for the eyes. Something is almost always moving, and the effect can be somewhat disorienting at times, but that's also the point. WAKING LIFE is about a young man who realizes he's dreaming, and finds he's ""unable"" to wake up for real. He keeps having false wake ups, crossing paths with one idiosyncratic individual after another between each failed attempt.
The story moves largely in monolog form from the people around him. He repeatedly has complex conversations (where he's more getting spoken ""at"" than ""to"") with random people. It feels a little hard to take at first because the conversations are so thick (ultimately that's also their appeal), but I found myself really getting in to it after the third one, or so.

It's very funny on a very dry level, drudging through topics like existentialism, human evolution, and human interaction in depths seemingly forgotten to the superficiality of everyday television.
It's a good, alternative film, worth seeing for its unique visuals and worth hearing for it's erudite jabs into higher thinking. I want the DVD!",1004918400,,1187,5.150259067357513
1805246,2,B00007AJKI,"An artsy, moody college student moves from scene to scene, encounters a series of talkative characters, engages in conversation after conversation on various philosophical, political, and spiritual topics, and as the circumstance becomes more and more mystifying, our unnamed hero realizes that he's in a dream that he cannot wake up from.  This is the basic premise of Richard Linklater's latest animated feature ""Waking Life"".  An interesting idea.
The film has a very fascinating visual presentation: shot in real life, and later painted frame by frame by animators with the aid of computers. The result is an exhilarating explosion of visual excitements. An interesting new medium.
But, as interesting as the premise and the visual presentation are, this movie rubs me the wrong way. I've always wondered whether or not a book from the ""For Dummies"" series can be turned into a film, ""Waking Life"" answers my curiosity. After hearing a string of pseudo-intellects having a string of mind-numbing pseudo-intellectual conversations, I am almost certain that this film is based on ""Philosophy For Dummies"". Pretentious and sophomoric, the film has the same depth of a first year philosophy major's term paper. I can probably get more philosophy out of an episode of Monty Python than from ""Waking Life"".
One of the very loathsome aspects of this film is that it conscientiously tries to be ""independent"", and thus corrupts the true spirit of independent films. It rejects the very fundamentals of what make up a film. Sure, independent films are all about breaking the rules and rejecting the norms. But directly reciting passages from a Philosophy 101 textbook is not art; not even outsider art, it's anti-art. Sometimes, we have to admit, the emperor is indeed naked.",1004918400,,1770,5.185314685314685
1805247,4,B00007AJKI,"With ""Waking Life,"" Richard Linklater returns to the loose, freewheeling structure he employed in his first film, ""Slacker."" The two main departures in ""Waking Life"" are 1) he animates the movie by filming live actors and superimposing computer images, and b) he anchors ""Waking Life"" by employing an unnamed protagonist played by ""Dazed and Confused"" actor Wiley Wiggins. The animated version of Wiggins wanders through his waking and dreaming life--the line between the two growing ever thinner--as various friends and acquaintances tell him their philosophies of life. (Among them are Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy sitting up in bed, discussing reincarnation and the afterlife; ""Before Sunrise"" fans will be delighted to know that Celine and Jesse reunited after all!) At first I thought this was a film I wouldn't particularly want to see again, but I find certain images and lines from it haunting me.  Some speakers in ""Waking Life"" are more interesting than others, but the animation by more than 30 artists gives the film a kaleidoscopic, Chagall- meets-Peter Max quality that holds the interest, and Wiggins is an engaging screen presence even as a cartoon! ""Waking Life"" is a film that gives us substantial food for thought and gracefully insinuates itself into our minds.",1004832000,,1280,5.213592233009709
1805248,5,B00007AJKI,"Richard Linklater calls this a ""movie about ideas,"" and it is indeed unlike most movies. It has only the slightest semblance of a plot. The unnamed narrator, played by Wiley Wiggins, seems to be trapped in a neverending dream in which he encounters a whole series of characters who expound on ideas about existence, dreaming, identity, time, religion, society. It reminded me of conversations with peers in college, sitting in the hallway of a dormitory, in the middle of the night, our minds bursting with ideas, grappling with problems and not finding any solutions but enamored with the quest. Like that, except amplified. The ideas in Waking Life are not like, whoa, you know, the ramblings of a pot-smoking college flunkie, but actual thoughts from intriguing street philosophers like Speed Levitch, fictional characters like Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy's characters from Linklater's Before Sunrise, artists like Steven Soderbergh, or academics like philosophy professor Robert Solomon.
It's a movie that would not have worked nearly as well as live action. The realism would detract from the intellectual dreaminess of the ideas. Linklater's animation technique, which uses computers to paint on top of live digital video footage, is just right for this film. It is as close as I've ever seen to having visuals actually embody the ideas being expressed verbally by the characters. A new, exciting alternative to the documentary as a visual medium for ideas, and just as credible an approach as that of, say, David Lynch, for reproducing the sensation of dream. The animation awakens the reality just as the ideas in the film rouse your mind.
Finally, it's a movie that will inspire a polarized reaction. The person I saw the film with stood up halfway into the film and left, unable to stand it. The greatest films seem to inspire such reaction. I left the theater and stood on the sidewalk outside, thinking.",1004313600,,1915,5.063291139240507
1805249,5,B00007AJKI,"I went into this movie not knowing what to expect.  I didn't know the storyline or anything, all I had heard was something about it being redone so it looked like impressionistic paintings.  Boy, I was in for a surprise.  The movie absolutely shocked me, and not in a bad way.  It was extremely intense and well thought out.  It was also very trippy and thrilling.  It kept me watching the whole time.  The movie had seemed long when I heard it ran for 96 minutes, but when those minutes were over with I said ""Wow, that went really fast"".  It had it's very interesting elements, and was very thought-provoking.  I went with my film club and we all agreed that we wanted to see it again and watch it part by part because so much information was being shot at you the whole time.  The style of the film, visually that is, was unique (and of course, that was it's claim to popularity).  The scenes are constantly moving, a fluid motion.  The backgrounds are never stationery and at first I thought I would get seasick/motion sickness, but it ended up just calming me, and made me focus more on what the characters were saying.  Overall the thoughts that were being thrown out there were all valid in their own ways.  I could easily agree with many of them with more knowledge and time with these people.  The dialogue, on whole, even though not very emotional, was very well done and highly imaginative.  I don't know what more to say about this film but that it is certainly worth seeing, some make think it's boring, but if one wants something different and usual and very intensely aimed towards thinking, then go for it.  You won't be disappointed.",1004227200,,1650,4.501683501683502
1805250,5,B00007AJKI,"""Waking Life"" is the rare kind of movie that makes your jaw drop in more ways than one.  It's worth the price of admission (more than once, in my opinion) just to behold the 'rotoscoping' animation.  Shot in digital film with real actors, a team of animators painted over each frame to produce an eery balance between realism and fantasy.  Colors reflect a character's emotions at a given time, shapes distort to express thematic conclusions, and lines themselves vibrate with a universal energy.  The visuals are beautiful and hypnotic.
What's equally impressive (and perfectly complementary to the animation) is the exposition of ""Waking Life"".  I hesitate to say 'plot' (although the film does build on itself), since the main character (Wiley Wiggins) wanders from person to person in an attempt to understand the world around him.  The film is largely a combination of monologues and soliloquies on the nature of dreams, reality, life, death, free will, and everything in between.  Wiggins' character can't figure out what's happening to him - he seemingly wakes from dream after dream, wondering if he's really awake.
What I find exhilirating may be frustrating for others, but if you have the chance to see ""Waking Life"", don't miss it.  It's a cinematic masterpiece.",1004054400,,1274,5.091346153846154
1805251,4,B00007AJKI,"""Waking Life"" was beautiful,philosophical,inspirational and a little surprising. I felt like I was watching a lecture on existensialism, with the speaker being a 7-11 checkout guy who had one too many Slurpees and was using his sugar buzz as an excuse to poetically smother his customers. A mix of artistic innovation and theatrical self-examination, it is a cartoon like journey through our imagination that is definately worth experiencing. Visually, each frame of film was a work of art in and of itself. If our subconscious mind is without boundary, then why can't our conscious lives be without limitation? ""Waking Life"" seems to ask that very question and by doing so inspires the audience to look within themselves and Wake UP! It is a grand collage of art and personal philosophies that dreams its way towards revelation for every second of 90 minutes. Overall, the only weakness to me was the casting choice of Charles Gunning, the teenage protaganist. He was very meak and uninteresting as a lead character. He reminded me of one of those museum tour guides who is so boring that he is completely ignored up until the moment someone gets lost and needs directions to the gift shop. He was obviously chosen this way intentionally so as not to distract the audience from all the ""meaning of life"" speeches that were constantly tossed out at us. Nonetheless, groundbreaking and a must-see!",1003968000,,1396,4.97008547008547
1805252,5,B00007AJKI,"No movie that I have ever seen contains such an overwhelming abundance of ideas.  Good ideas.  Penetrating ideas.  Ideas about life, reality, the meaning of existence, and lots and lots of ideas about dreams.  Linklater must have been a philosophy major at the University of Texas.  I say this partly because of the sheer abundance of philosophical explorations of a huge variety of topics, but the presence of actual University of Texas philosophers.  I spotted two with whom I am familiar (Louis Mackey, author of one of the best books on Kierkegaard and who portrayed the ""Old Anarchist"" in SLACKER, and Robert C. Solomon, a prolific publisher of books on a variety of philosophical topics).
But I don't mean to mislead someone and intimate that this is a movie that solely addresses the head, and not the imagination or the heart.  It does.  Visually, this is one of the most remarkable films I have ever seen.  Most individuals anticipating seeing the film are probably already aware that Linklater initially filmed live actors in the movie's scenes, and then collaborated with others in painting over the images to create a remarkable animated film.  The result is delightful.  Visually, the movie doesn't look like anything else ever made.  But the film isn't just gorgeous to look at and stimulating intellectually:  it is funny.  Nearly ever scene results in laughter, and interpenetrating nearly every discussion, no matter how serious, is humor.
Apart from the visual aspect of the film, WAKING LIFE bears a recognizable resemblance to SLACKER.  If you had seen SLACKER and then went to see this one without knowing who directed it, you would be identify both as the work of the same director within a few minutes.  In fact, one of the earliest scenes in the movie strongly echoes the first scene in SLACKER.  In that movie, a guy at a bus station (played by Linklater himself), catches a cab and begins talking to the cab driver about his dream life.  He explains his theory that dreams might be a window into an alternative reality, and tells him that in a different reality, he might have talked and gotten to know a woman he saw at the bus station.  WAKING LIFE begins with the main character exchanging glances with a woman at a bus station, then going to catch a cab (though he ends up with a ride from a very unusual individual), and then the rest of the movie is an essay on the nature of dreams.
Though SLACKER and WAKING LIFE are stylistically similar, in the end they are very different films.  While both are somewhat episodic, with little (as in WAKING LIFE) or no (SLACKER) plot to speak of, and while both appear to be set primarily in Austin, Texas (I spotted one scene that seemed to have been filmed along the River Walk in San Antonio and another on the Brooklyn Bridge in NYC), and both contain a succession of professional and amateur actors, WAKING LIFE differs in two major ways, apart from the visual.  First, WAKING LIFE, despite the variety of character, primarily focuses on the concerns of one young man.  Second, while episodic in structure, WAKING LIFE is structured by the constant questioning of the nature of waking reality versus dreaming reality.  SLACKER was basically about nothing; WAKING LIFE is definitely about something.
This movie is not for everyone.  If you don't like ideas and talking about ideas, you might find this film tedious.  It is animated, but it bears utterly no resemblance to a Disney movie.  And it really doesn't have much of a plot.  If you require a definite and involved plot, this movie won't be to your liking.  For those who love extraordinary visual imagery and brilliant conversation about ideas, this movie will be a rare treat.
Slight correction:  one character in the movie says that Kierkegaard's last words were:  ""Sweep me up.""  This quote is, in fact, based on something Kierkegaard reputedly said a month or so before he died.  He was at a gathering at someone's house when he collapsed physically.  As people gathered around him, he quipped, ""Let it lie.  The maid will sweep it up in the morning.""  He soon entered a hospital and died a month later, apparently of a staph infection.  I am not aware of any recorded final words.",1003536000,,4217,4.768275862068966
1805253,1,B00007AJKI,"As part of a movie group, last week we were afforded the opportunity to see Waking Life before it opened.  At first when the audience heard that this film was animated and used old and new techniques, there were some groans.  But my purpose in  joining this group was to see movies other than the blockbuster conventional films so I truly looked forward to this experience with an open mind. Unfortunately I learned much too quickly that the groans were justified as was the audience's deaprture from the theater before the movie ended.  Never one to give up easily, I decided to stick with it but ultimately felt it was a waste of time.
My first objection to the movie was the use of this new animated feature where the screen was never without some sort of motion.  Focusing on one of the faces, there was movement from the cheek, forehead let alone the eyes and nose and mouth.  At times I became so dizzy that I had to close my eyes.  And I wasn't ever quite sure what the subject matter was all about. It seemed as though a young boy was interviewing teachers or mentors about the meaning of life, etc.  But one scene, in light of the recent World Trade Center tragedy in New York, was particularly gruesome.  A man speaking to the younger man comments that life is almost futile upon which he pours gasoline over himself and then lights himself causing his incineration.  I would have found this horrifying at any time but especially now, it was seat squirming awful to view that scene.
I will close by saying that perhaps my appreciation level for movies like this isn't what it should be or perhaps I'm not all that sophisticated a moviegoer after all.  Today I feel it was a waste of time to view this film and think if I had stayed at home and rented a movie or watched one on TV, I would have been a much happier camper.",1002931200,,1831,4.403560830860534
