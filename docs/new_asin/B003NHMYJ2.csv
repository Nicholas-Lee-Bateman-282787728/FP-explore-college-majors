4158899,5,B003NHMYJ2,"Joss Whedon: The Man, The Myth, The God Among Geeks. There are very few creative forces in the pantheon of Fanboy/girl obsession that have more slavish devotees than Joss Whedon. The reason for this is simple: Just about every project he touches turns to gold. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, FIREFLY, DOLLHOUSE, and the SERENITY feature film... he is a geek god. And then he came into the world of Comics. He started out with the futuristic Vampire Slayer series FRAY, and then he was given the opportunity to helm the flagship X-Men title for the new millenium: ASTONISHING X-MEN. The series comes directly after the fallout of the Grant Morrison run, which saw Jean Grey die (again), Scott Summers fall in love with Emma Frost, a Magneto-wannabe destroy a lot of Manhattan and all of the X-Men's uniforms turn into black and yellow leather.

Joss Whedon and PLANETARY's illustrious illustrator John Cassaday joined up to bring a less bizarre but more intense run than Morrison ever could have done.

I'm not really going to get into the plot because you can find that all on the TPB review pages. What I'm going into here is the Motion Comic. It does a great job at retelling and somewhat animating the ""Gifted"" arc. The voice talent is all no-name, but they all fit their respected characters perfectly. The executive directors of this series are Cassaday and living legend Neal Adams... who if you read comics, you should know and love. If you don't, I'll sum his work up for you: You know how BATMAN got really campy in the 60's? He was the artist that was most directly responsible for bringing the Dark Knight back from that crap.

After getting all of these, unfortunately, through iTunes (unfortunately, because I'm not a fan of iTunes), I still plan on getting the DVD because the motion comic for ""Gifted"" is just as great as the read of the series.",1278115200,14,1862,4.705521472392638
4158900,5,B003NHMYJ2,"I originally got these as downloads through the Playstation network.  Gifted is divided into 6 episodes of about 15 minutes each.  When I saw Amazon had the motion comic on DVD I had to purchase it.

What is a motion comic?  Its a bit of a hybrid genre-- the video looks like someone was able to animate the spaces between the panels in a comic book.  The conversation bubbles are replaced by voice actors.  The voice acting is spot on.  Emma Frost drips with her elite mannerism.  Wolverine is gruff and quick-witted.  The voice actors do a great job of dramatically portraying the x-men without going over the top into the field of campy or too corny: It is not a Saturday morning cartoon-- in some ways it much better.

I loved the 1990's x-men cartoon, but as I grew up so did the X-men.  Astonishing X-men are still dealing with some of the issues of discrimination and intolerance that have been a hallmark of x-men series since the comic debuted in the 1960s but in a much more sophisticated manner.  In these episodes a cure for mutants is discovered, and the x-men are torn between inner conflicts as well as inter-stellar conflicts.

I won't give anything away, but the acting and animation is paced so that the suspense never slackens.  The only thing I don't like about this is that there are ONLY six episodes.  I would gladly buy ever x-men issue as motion comic as well as a paper issue if they were as well made as these episodes.

If you grew up with the x-men, you'll appreciate Gifted for its many allusions to their 40 year comic history.  If you're new to x-men, these episodes are almost as thrilling as the movies without being nearly as campy as the saturday morning cartoons.",1276732800,50,1700,4.521311475409836
4158921,5,B003NHMYJ2,"This new style of animation is very cool. To make a comic book really come to life with movement had to be a new challenge for animators. Now this is not a animated cartoon like Wolverine and the Xmen, but is just as good, but in a different style.
I remember back about 10yrs ago Marvel put out digital comics on dvd, that I also have. Xmen. Avengers. Hulk. The panels just floated over the screen with dialog and cheesy narration. Not that they were bad, but in comparison to Josh Whedons series here, they were very primitive and just frame stills that read like a comic book.  These are better and I hope they will make more.",1392940800,,629,4.330508474576271

4158924,4,B003NHMYJ2,"Okay, so it's a motion comic.  But hey, it's one of the best writers (Joss Whedon) and best artists (John Cassaday) on one of the best X-Men stories, so what more do you want?  Well, yeah, an ACTUAL animated feature would have been nice, but you can't have everything.  Panel for panel, word balloon for word ballon, this is a perfect (well, for a motion comic) adaptation of the first 6 issues of Whedon/Cassaday's run on Astonishing X-Men.  The remaining 18 issues are covered in the follow-up discs.

So, if you alreay have the comics, why get this?  Well, the voices are pretty decent.  That's really all you get that you didn't already have.  Cyclops is kind of boring (well, I guess he's supposed to be boring), and Emma Frost has no trace of a fake British accent (yet there's still the odd colloquialism), otherwise, it's reasonably well done.  Oh, and there's this horrible jerky effect whenever they do a pan.  So, starting with 5 stars, I take away one because I just can't give a motion comic 5 stars, take away another because of the jerky effect, then give them back a star because it's Whedon and Cassaday.

Or you could just buy the comic.",1367625600,,1155,4.558252427184466
4158925,4,B003NHMYJ2,"If you are a casual animated fan then this movie really isn't for you, if you are expecting a normal animated movie, again this is not for you. If you are looking for an X Men movie with more mature subject matter this is in your wheelhouse. The movie is done as a motion comic which views basically as a comic panel with the motion consisting of lips moving (like a dubbed movie) or some body parts moving but NOT full animation. I was hesitant at first but when you watch the movie after a while the story takes over and you forget about the motion. (In fact I bought the next 2 titles, Dangerous and Torn) The other complaint is that the movie is shown in episode style and the episodes are short, like under 15 minutes each, and they have a long credit sequence.",1353715200,,766,4.2534246575342465

4158927,4,B003NHMYJ2,"A very good story and very good animation. This is an animated graphic novel, altogether different than digital comic books. It is different from animated (cartoon) movies. These are more like video game graphics. I think they have tremendous potential and I would definitely like to see more offerings from Marvel and DC as well. I still enjoy animated movies but I like these also.",1337040000,,383,4.907692307692308
4158928,1,B003NHMYJ2,"Joss Whedon's stab at an X-men series leaves a bitter taste of urine in my mouth, and I can't get it out. He's taken all of your favorite characters and stripped them of anything likable and put them into a cartoon that I could have undoubtedly animated better when I was 3.

Here are the big surprises:

- Scott (Cyclops) is a crying emo bitch.
- Logan (Wolverine) is just angry. For no apparent reason this time. I mean, worse so than normal.
- Kitty (Shadowcat) seems like she's a 13 year old girl who woke up 30 one day.
- Emma Frost isn't poorly done.
- Beast... well, let's put it this way, Joss Whedon sucks.

There are better X-men TV series out there. X-men Evolution was amazing. That series was proof that you can take artistic liberties with a franchise and build something great out of it. This series made me want to poke my eyeballs out with a rusty fork.

Save yourself the $10. And if you have the $10 to spare, use the 80 minutes of your life for something better than this.",1323907200,,992,4.288770053475936

Been a fan of Joss Whedon since about halfway through Buffy's first season (Firefly should never have been canceled, and The Avengers are a highlight of 2012).  When I read the books, I was hooked in again.  Whedon's take on the characters, partnered with his great dialogue, were a Win.  The animation of the comic here went way beyond what I was expecting out of this purchase.  Couple that with some great voice acting, and this was a treat.  Keep these coming, and I'll keep buying.",1303603200,3,530,4.412371134020619

It was awkward at first but once you get in to the story with the voice acting, it's actually quite cool. It's amazing how they can take the exact comic artwork and sort of bring it to life. Joss Whedon's X-Men run is absolutely amazing. I hope they put the rest of his run in this motion format because I'll buy it immediately. I'm getting Iron Man Extremis next because I'm amazed that this concept works so well.",1295136000,,519,4.3061224489795915
4158951,5,B003NHMYJ2,"My son and I viewed this DVD and it was excellent.  The actors/voiceovers did an excellent job of capturing the characters as we know them.

The dialogue was witty and well-written and the art work was phenomenal!  I would like to see more work by this writer, director and artist, especially on the X-men series.

I hope to see the rest of this series written.  I think each episode runs about 10 minutes on this 60 minute DVD, 6 episodes in all.  I found myself on the edge of my seat when each episode was ending and my hoping that there would be another episode following.  I had not looked at the running time, prior to my view this disc. (smile)

Execellent work!",1293148800,,669,4.382113821138211
4158952,4,B003NHMYJ2,"In my mind there are a afew simple facts:
X-MEN (and their comic franchises) Were one of Marvel's Greatest Collections of Stories, Characters, and Drawing.
Bryan Singer RUINED The X-Men both in his involvement in the Films and the Comics
Joss Whedon knows how to put together a Good Story to Unfold over time and maintain suspence.

I stopped Reading the X-Men comics about 10 years ago. I moved on to other focuses and grew up as I moved on to College Life. However, my interest was always there as I went to see all the movies, and was dissapointed each and every one of them. From time to time, I'd pick up one of the comics by a magazine stand and read it and see how Bryan Singer's abomination had worked it's way into the pages of the comic itself and I'd put it down.

I ran across ""The Astonishing X-Men: Gifted"" on iTunes. I had seen something about a Motion Comic before, with Spiderwoman, but never watched it. What got me into trying this was the name: Joss Whedon. What I loved from him was his creation of the TV Series based on his movie ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer"" which despite superficial first looks, is quite an indepth show that dealt with things such as Self-Loathing, Drug Abuse, Coming to Terms with Self, the struggle between light and dark in ourselves.. a million things... all in a creative fashion. As an X-Men Fan.. I was very intregued by his Whedonized retelling of the Classic X-Men Storyline ""The Dark Phoenix Saga"" using Willow as his ""Phoenix."" The comparisons are undeniable and to learn that Joss has been an X-Men fan just confirm it (not to mention his brief allusion to Dark Phoenix in the series during this storyline). (If you're an X-Men fan, check out Season 6 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer to see what I mean.. He really does Re-Tell the Phoenix Saga better than the X-Men Movies tried to).

ANYWAY, Joss is what made me decide to try out this X-MEN Motion Comic.
I was not suprised to learn that Jean Grey was dead, again, but a bit taken back that Scott had taken up with Emma Frost and I'm still unclear about where Xavier is, or why beast looks more... beastly than usual. The story telling, the humor, the build up and suspence are all Classic Joss Whedon with the X-Men flare and is great. He re-captures the comic style of each of these characters as I remember them and I quite enjoyed each episode, of which there are 6. I HOPE For More..

My ONE Complaint... I'm tired of ""The Cure"" which we've been going on and on about since Cable was a baby.

ONE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW: This Isn't A Cartoon, as you may be acustomed to. Essentially it is a group of Voice Actors reading the Comic to you ""In Character"" with Panels of the Original Print Comic Book, shown on the screen and manipulated to appear as tho they are talking, or moving.
There is a PREVIEW Available on Amazon.com and i'm sure on iTunes so you can get a taste of what to expect before you buy.

I consider this a must for any Prodigal X-Fan who wants to catch up and see where it's been going.",1292371200,,3011,4.387096774193548
4158953,4,B003NHMYJ2,"If you like joss whedon and/or motion comics, you will love this. The only problem is that this motion comic only covers the first 6 issues of the comic and leaves you hanging wishing there were more.",1290729600,,200,4.4324324324324325
4158954,3,B003NHMYJ2,"The first thing i thought of was the old 60s Marvel Comics cartoons, where they ""animated"" panels to cut actual animation costs so the end result was a self-moving pop-up book. Marvel must have thought of this too as they market this DVD as a motion comic. Still I really enjoyed this, and John Cassaday lays down some nice pencil work. Joss Whedon provides snappy dialogue to go along with it.",1290643200,,394,4.563380281690141
4158955,2,B003NHMYJ2,"I bought this at wal-mart yesterday... animated X-Men movie for $15 with a story by Joss Whedon?!? Hells yeah!

That's where the good ended... it's not a movie at all it's a motion comic. Basically they scanned the comic panels into a computer & used photoshop to turn, angle & warp the image to give it the appearance of really crappy animation.

Then they remove the word bubbles and hire voice actors. The voice acting was not half bad but nobody in their right mind would pay $15 for a movie that is just comic panels flashed on the screen while people read the text. At least when they did it for the Watchman graphic novel it was during the watchmen hype when the movie was out AND they said straight on the package it was a motion comic.... this is just shameless money grubbing and nowhere on the packaging does this say anything about being a motion comic.

I made it through the first episode but they couldn't even make the credits smooth... this is going back tomorrow morning.",1289174400,5,989,4.483333333333333
4158996,4,B003NHMYJ2,"This is highly entertaining. If you loved the original comic run of this story line, then you will love this as well. Now, would I have liked them to do a full-on animated movie of this like DC has been doing with their releases in recent years? For sure. But since this is what they are giving us, I'll take it. To hear voices put to the characters was very cool. To see the original Cassaday artwork brought to ""life"", again very cool.

I certainly think there is plenty of room for this type of animation - and that's what it is, another type of animation. Not bad (by any account), just different.

My only dissapointment is that this is not the full comic run and that actually gets teased near the end of the video. I'm hoping this sells well enough for them to finish the Whedon run.

You cannot beat the entertainment value of this for the price.",1287964800,,854,4.325

HAVE AN OPEN MIND !!! This is a breakthrough in the field and just because you didn't do your research doesn't mean it's a bad item!",1287532800,,485,4.282608695652174
4158999,4,B003NHMYJ2,"First, the comic book gives you more, in case you haven't read it yet. But this motion comics adaptation ain't so shabby, either. Apologies to Grant Morrison and his quirk and others who did decent in their X-Men runs, but no one's done it better recently than Joss Whedon.  So if a comic book company were to launch a new platform to showcase its comics, mining Whedon's brilliance seems a straight-up no-brainer. Artist John Cassaday helped, too. Of course, DC was the actual pioneer in this field, having come out with its rough WATCHMEN motion comics some years ago.

ASTONISHING X-MEN: GIFTED is Whedon's first X-Men arc and, reading it, you knew right away that you're in for some spectacular times. Whedon pulls out all the usual tools from his utility belt: the wit, the humor, the emotional gut checks, the pop culture plunge, the plot swerve. He makes you love the characters, even characters you didn't give an ef about going in (I'm looking at you, Cyclops). And, after you grow to care about them, he kills them off. I'm not saying that that happens here. But Whedon is a notorious serial killer.

Whedon gets a crack at writing Kitty Pryde, and if you don't fall in love with her, you are some sort of soulless. She returns to the X-Men proper here, and as a member of Xavier Institute's faculty, all grown up. In terms of character development, Kitty is the richest character. Love Kitty Pryde.

The central conflicts in the story: An alien mercenary called Ord from the Breakworld - the wonderfully snide Emma Frost refers to him as the ""alien berk"" - is running amok, taking hostages, testing the X-Men for whatever reason. Meanwhile, with the ever present anti-mutant hysteria as a backdrop, a brilliant geneticist publicly announces a cure for the mutant gene. Two separate plot threads but, as it turns out, it's all one single thread. As a bonus, Nick Fury shows up and S.W.O.R.D. is introduced. And just to demonstrate that Whedon doesn't only kill people off, an X-Man returns from the dead.

Don't get it twisted, what's featured here isn't full blown animation or a cartoon or what have you. Motion comics is a medium perched somewhere between the comic book and animation (text captions and word/thought balloons are excised in exchange for spoken dialogue). The movements aren't that fluid or continuous. Think of it as taking the original artwork from the comic book and tweaking it here and there just enough so that there are bits of movement. It's pretty minimal stuff, but in spite of the inherent stiffness and the limits to this new medium, the computer graphic artists do wonders. The neat thing to this concept is that there is absolute devotion to the source material, the comic book's original artwork is preserved, as well as the words. In ASTONISHING X-MEN: GIFTED  the ""animators"" are all very keen to keep faith with John Cassaday. Thanks to them - and thanks to project overseer Neal Adams and Cassaday himself - this motion comics achieves a sort of dynamic flow. The voice actors - a bunch of unknowns - flesh out the characters and are pitch perfect for their roles. And we already know Joss Whedon's story itself has legs.

I'm still not sold on this motion comics thing. If Marvel, and whichever other comic book company, were to stick with its best products, then motion comics might make a go of it as a valid medium. I'd love to see John Byrne's 1980s run on FANTASTIC FOUR to get this treatment or Miller & Mazzucchelli's BATMAN: YEAR ONE. I like what I saw in GIFTED because Cassaday's art is stunning stuff, never mind that this new technology is still tottering on baby legs. Neal Adams has stated that he someday wants this medium to get a movie theater release, but that is some serious reaching at this early stage. Let's wait and see.

ASTONISHING X-MEN: GIFTED collects all six episodes, each running at around 12 to 14 minutes. The DVD's bonus material: Joe Quesada and Neal Adams talk about the genesis and development of Marvel's first motion comic book, with Quesada also going into the process of acquiring Joss Whedon as X-Men's then newest writer (00:17:10 minutes long); the pretty cool ""Rise Up"" music video; the ASTONISHING X-MEN: GIFTED trailer; a chronological history of the X-Men, narrated in text, except that if your television screen is small, then you may not be able to read the print; ""Behind the Scenes with Marvel Knights Animation"" delves even more technically into the motion comics process (00:05:12 minutes); an Artist's Gallery featuring John Cassaday's incredible stuff; ""Marvel Super Heroes: What The--?!"" presents Marvel characters auditioning for roles in ASTONISHING X-MEN: GIFTED: Episode #1 (""There's No Business Like Snow Business""), Episode #2 (""Red Carpet M.O.D.O.K.""), and Episode #11 (""Deadpool FYC""); and trailers for other Marvel motion comics (SPIDER-WOMAN: AGENT OF S.W.O.R.D., the shaky looking BLACK PANTHER, and IRON MAN: EXTREMIS).",1287187200,4,4938,4.898325358851674

I decided to purchase this thinking it was an animated film such as Superman/Batman: Public Enemies or another animated film. Yes it is animation but it is a motion comic. I was upset. You should display that some where. Second you don't need to purchase this, if you have xbox live you can get it from off of the zune media section, netflixs, and off of the ps3. I ordered 3 movies X-Men: Gifted, Family Guy: Partial Terms of Enderment, and Superman/Batman: Apocalypse and out of all 3 only the Superman/Batman film held my attention.",1287014400,,653,4.589743589743589
4159001,4,B003NHMYJ2,"The stories compromising the tale on the DVD are quite enjoyable and, as others have said, it would be nice to see more of the Astonishing Run done by this crew. Voice acting is, for the most part, strong enough and the story is as well, combining to make it so you barely care that this is ""motion comic"" and not, say, an animated movie.

That this is a ""motion comic"" is one of the main things you should consider when getting this: realize you're getting a graphic novel/comic arc with added ""minour movement"" and voices. Some of us - myself included - enjoy that, but many people expect a full animated story and that is not the case here.

The storyline is from the initial arc of Joss Whedon's run on ""Astonishing X-Men"" and involves the Astonishing crew - Cyclops, Emma Frost, Kitty Pryde, Wolverine and Beast (w/guest-appearances from Nick Fury, Lockheed, and assorted X-fellows, while introducing a few new characters and returning one whom I won't spoil in this review). They investigate a Cure designed to remove mutant abilities that is also tied into an alien intervention. The story isn't one of the strongest as it sometimes gets a bit...forced...in places, trying too hard to tie things together and, to a lesser degree, losing sight of various elements. Characterization is relatively strong though and it's one of the reasons I enjoyed the story (I am a huge fan of both Cyclops and Emma and rather fond of Beast so seeing them get attention is nice). I rather disliked the returning character but, in fairness, I'm in the minourity of fans on this; it was rather well received by many others.

Realize that episodes are relatively brief - about the time it takes for a moderately wordy comic to be read outloud - and adjust your ""bang for the buck"" accordingly.

THE BIG CAVEAT: Unless I'm missing something - such as them having been withdrawn - these are the same episodes you can watch for free on Hulu (albeit you won't have your own copy to pop in a DVD player). As such, it's entirely possible to get these episodes along with the bonus of being free (Hulu)making this release, for the most part, a bit of a ""money grab"". In fairness, this release does have special features that may appeal to you enough to be worth getting separate. If I was going to rate just this release, it would only be 2 stars (**) but my rating is for the overall experience of the motion comic, whichever format you use to view/purchase it.",1286409600,,2442,4.606896551724138
4159002,5,B003NHMYJ2,"Initially when I saw the words ""motion comic"" I was turned off by the product. It was most likely my looking for some way to fill that Xmen Void after finishing the Wolverine and Xmen anime. I was really sceptical... I went online to view the first couple min before I purchased. I must say that this literally has to be probably the most solid representation of the Xmen that i have seen literally since the 90's anime series (props also to the first xmen movie). I cant vouch for any of the ""motion comics"" before today, but this feature was GREAT!! If they keep this level of quality up and continue to move forward with it I will gladly accept this as a new form of presentation. Now regarding that. I see the reviews on this product stating that this is not as animated as, well anime. In some senses yes this is true, but its not a fair comparison. just like comparing live action with anime. There are things that work better in each. I think its fair to say regarding this that I have never seen any Xmen anime with a story line and good as this and as much passion in the actors.

4159003,2,B003NHMYJ2,"Aaaww man, why did they do is? Why did they have to test their new animation technology (Motion Comics Animation,MCA), on a Marvel animation? While the artwork is great for the most part the animation stinks. It is just a slightly better than the 1966 Marvel animation series. If this is a new animation technique, it has a long way to go or at lease needs quick improvement before being used on a major marvel animation. (Fortunately Neal Adams and Joe Quesada acknowledged that a lot more need to be done to improve MCA). That is the first major disappointment you will notice. The next is the ridiculous chapter interruptions every nine minutes or so. Why in the world did they divide it into six nine minute chapters?  It is annoying to have to sit through the credits at the end of each chapter and intro at the beginning of each new chapter.  And as if that wasn't bad enough, the artist made Hank McCoy (the Beast), look like a fat cat in the face and gave him a stupid looking x men suit.  Storm is missing so there is no African American representation. The only person of color in the Indian doctor. And then there is the unnecessary profanity, even Hank McCoy and Kitty get cuss words in. It is sad that animations have to include fowl language these day. While The Astonishing X Men was entertaining, it was also very disappointing.  **",1286064000,4,1348,4.512295081967213
4159004,2,B003NHMYJ2,You know a great story can be ruined by awful animation. It looks like it was done by the same guys who did Jacob two-two & The Mr. Men Show. Its so wooden & tilted much like Milton The Monster. I think the viewers will be too busy looking at the third-rate animation to listen to the story. I give this dvd a 3 out of 10.,1283472000,4,322,3.8208955223880596

IT WAS AWESOME!!!! I actually own two of the issues this series stems from. It perfectly replicates how most of us comic book geeks see the action and dialogue in our minds. I was so impressed with this motion comic and the execution of it. I have been trying to convince people who have never read a comic to purchase this. It had action, supense, sexuality, humor. The acting is superb!!! THIS IS NOT A CARTOON!!!!!

SPOILER: THE SCENE IN THE FACILITY WITH KITTY PRYDE HAD ME GASPING OUT LOUD

I encourage everyone to buy this DVD and I hope they make a million more. I have viewed other motion comics and this is by far the BEST ONE.

Can someone please ask Neal Adams to do a motion comis for Batman's Hush?!?!

BUY THIS DVD!!!!!",1280102400,27,911,4.182857142857143

8401102,4,B003NHMYJ2,"This DVD is part of an overall story arc. The complete series is, in order:

 1. Astonishing X-Men: Gifted
 2. Astonishing X-Men: Dangerous
 3. Astonishing X-Men: Torn
 4. Astonishing X-Men: Unstoppable

While you can watch the first (Gifted) by itself, as you get through the series, you will need to see the other stories to better understand the overall story.

My only complaint is that there are no subtitles on any of the discs. They would have been especially handy in the last chapter of Gifted where the background sound effects of the action scenes were so high in the mix that you could not make out what the characters were saying.

Also, F.Y.I. the only disc of the series with extra features is Gifted.",1405468800,2,716,4.672

8401105,4,B003NHMYJ2,"It was only a matter of time before Id succumb to the charms of the motion comic genre and now that Ive finally purchased and watched a few, I can firmly attest to the fact that Astonishing X-Men Gifted is a success on all fronts.

To begin, do try to ignore all of the negative reviews that bash products like this one and the many other motion comics on the market (easily identifiable in Marvels thanks to the Marvel Knights branding right on the package) for poor or choppy animation. This is a motion comic after all, not an animated series.  Thats like faulting a box of Kraft Mac & Cheese for not being spaghetti.

Anyway, if the idea of a motion comic means nothing to you, think the actual pages of the graphic novel on which the story is based scanned into a computer one panel at a time and Photoshop used to move limbs, turn heads, make mouth flaps match spoken dialog etc.  Never does this claim to be nor replace traditional animation practices.

Instead (as the commentary on this particular DVD eloquently confesses), this is an entirely new entertainment medium altogether.  One that bridges the gap between the static panels of a comic and the acting/ motion of a film or cartoon.  As such, the experience of viewing is pretty unique and quite enjoyable.  Truly it captures the tone, look and feel of the comic like no other medium Im aware of but does so with just enough energy to keep it very separate from say, reading a comic book on the Marvel app.

I personally found myself noticing its uniqueness for the first few segments of the first episode (there are 6 contained on this disc in total/ based on issues # 1-6) but by the end, had forgotten entirely that this was in fact a motion comic and not simply a TV series.  Perhaps some of this can be attributed to Joss Whedons engaging story-line, which, in the event that you haven't read the graphic novels on which these Marvel Knights Astonishing X-Men motion comics are based, is quite impressive.

Without giving up too many spoilers, the plot introduces a ""mutant cure"" designed by Benetech scientist Dr. Kavita Rao, who was secretly sponsored by the gladiator alien Ord. The prospect of ""real"" humanity arouses the interest of a heavily mutated Beast, who visits Rao only to discover that the drug is the product of illegal human experimentation and all the while the lines drawn between society and mutant-kind are becoming venerable walls.

In short, now only is the plot intriguing and rich but the dialog is spot-on as well, with witty quips and awesome character exchanges aplenty.  Pacing is entirely too quick though for my taste as the 6 roughly 10-minute episodes are over just as the action is heating up.

Which brings me to my only complaint, to get the story in its motion comic entirety, one must purchase separate DVDs for Volume 2 (Dangerous), Volume 3 (Torn) and Volume 4 (Unstoppable).  At around $10 a pop, you're looking at close to $50 to enjoy the tale in its entirety.  Worse still is that Marvel Knights isn't stopping with just Joss Whedons take on the X franchise either as already Ultimate Wolverine Vs. Hulk, Wolverine Vs. Sabretooth, Wolverine Origin, and Weapon X Tomorrow Dies Today have already been released.  Building up a Marvel Knights motion comic collection can add up really quickly and its addicting enough to warrant doing so.  It would really be nice if Shout! Factory, at the very least, would have bundled up all of the Joss Whedon arc of the franchise into a single DVD box-set rather than forcing buyers to pick up 4 separate releases to get the full story.  Note that since the time of this reviews writing, that have done exactly this for the Blu-ray edition of the material calling it Marvel Knights: Astonishing X-Men BluRay Box.

That single complaint aside, its very easy to recommend picking up Astonishing X-Men Gifted to dedicated comic fans and neophytes alike.  Truly the experience is entirely unique even from those as seemingly similar as the various animated incarnations of the franchise throughout the years (and certainly much more loyal to the source material than all of the live action films combined).

Gifted represents my first foray into the motion comic genre and will certainly not be my last.  Im already quite interested in picking up InHumans and Black Panther in my next binge.  Exciting news for all, but perhaps most so to my credit card company.",1402790400,,4407,4.723237597911227
