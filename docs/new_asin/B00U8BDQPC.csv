7030731,5,B00U8BDQPC,"Let me just start off by saying that this series had me hooked from the start.  The way the storyline flows at just the right pace, the way the characters interact, and just the overall story blows me away.  Season two in my opinion was even better than season one, so I would definitely recommend this to everyone.  BTW if you're going to be that person who says ""ew it has lesbians"" or ""but there's even a boob in the first scene"", please both one: write it down and shove it up your butt, and two: understand that this is what Jenji Kohan's jailtime was like: lack of privacy and being ""gay for the stay"", so don't you go badmouthing my show because of your ill point of view.  LONG LIVE ORANGE!!",1429747200,,699,4.2727272727272725

7030733,1,B00U8BDQPC,"The first season was absolutely wonderful.  This season lost me.  The writer seems to be under the impression that every woman who goes to jail MUST be lesbian.  The story lines could have been so much more riveting, but it really fell short.

I just find it really sad after having such a hugely dramatic and popular first season.  Hopefully season 3 will be worth watching.",1428969600,10,375,4.621212121212121
7030734,5,B00U8BDQPC,"This show definitely improved from season 1, and season 1 was already good.

It puts those improvements right in your face starting with the first episode of season 2. Without going into details and spoilers (because I know that's really annoying) the first episode of season 2 is very intense. It pulls you out of the semi comfortable setting of the season 1 prison and thrusts you into a very uncomfortable setting that feels so realistic it's actually uncomfortable to watch at times. The short version is that you've become so connected with Piper Chapman by the end of season 1 that it's almost painful to watch how miserable she is in the first episode of season 2. And yet you are captivated the entire time and can't look away from the screen. That's good television that can do that to the viewer!

That episode is important in the whole experience of the show as well. One of the biggest criticisms of season 1 (by show detractors, not by me) was that it didn't represent actual prison realistically. Well no kidding. It's a comedy drama about prison life. It's got to be more lighthearted than real prison. That's the same as the people who complain that Scrubs wasn't factually representational of life in a hospital. The main goal of the show runners is comedy and a good story. Those goals force realism to be sacrificed. You have to accept that going in or you'll never enjoy a comedy series ever.

Episode 1 of season 2 is MUCH more realistic. The look and feel of the cinematography and color depth of episode 1 is even changed to give it more a realistic presentation about prison life. TV is usually shot in a slightly warmer color tone that makes the viewer feel more comfortable with the show. OITNB does this too in all the other episodes. But Season 2 Episode 1 is show with much colder color depth that is more realistic. This takes away that comfort of the rest of the series removes some of the edge of it being a prison show. This is a brilliant directorial move.

Right off the bat in season 2 you understand why the whole show isn't made to be a realistic portrayal of prison life....because it's too intense for a show like this. The cable show Lockup is the show for you if you want realism in every episode. Lockup is a very good show in it's own right. But it's not trying to be a comedy, because it would be an awful comedy. Just like Orange Is The New Black would be an awful documentary because that's not what it's trying to be.

The rest of season 2 turns the intensity down a tad. (And that's a good thing because you wouldn't want to keep up the episode 1 pace for a full season) But the prison is still noticeably harsher than it was in season 1. New characters bring a new dynamic to the prison. Old characters change in ways that alter the day to day routines. This is all very good stuff that keeps the show fresh. In reality prison life is very repetitive and would make for bad TV after the first 10 episodes as you kept seeing all the same stuff repeat itself. But Orange Is The New Black makes just enough changes to keep the show fresh without making the character modifications so big that they defy logic and make the show silly. The dynamic changes are all very well presented and explained so they all make sense. So it stays fresh and flows well with season 1.

Piper, while still the main character of the series, gives up time in the story arc to the other characters who get brought more to the forefront. This makes the show less about Piper and more about life in the prison overall. That simply gives the writers more room to explore. That in turn slows down the real passage of time in the series so Piper's 15 month sentence can last for at least 3 seasons of the series.

Piper herself has some interesting dynamic changes as well in season 2. She goes from being the 'innocent' victim of the system to making choices that pre-prison Piper wouldn't have. Her personality starts to harden as well and she becomes much less idealistic and much more pragmatic. She begins to do what's necessary for her own comfort, caring less about who sacrifices what to give her what she needs....yet she's still not the 'lifer inmate' who's given up all compassion for others so she remains likable. It's a nice character development that keeps Piper fresh.

Overall I found season 2 to be even better than season 1. (Again, this is with a full understanding that I'm not watching a realistic show about prison life.) And I thought season 1 was really good.

This is well worth renewing your Netflix subscription for. It's also well worth owning as soon as the DVD is released. (Not available yet at the time of this review)",1427068800,38,4672,4.480611045828437

7030802,1,B00U8BDQPC,"A captivating, compelling season but this Season 2 DVD deserves ZERO STARS for including Bonus Feature clips and interviews on Disc 3 that go into detail about the murder of a character that doesn't occur until Disc 4. Who produced this??

People generally watch the Extra Features as they occur in chronological order on the DVD.  So, why include a massive spoiler before we've gotten a chance to see that episode?

Shockingly, the same happened with a character's death being revealed on a Season One DVD bonus feature before the character died on an episode in a later Disc. This is extremely frustrating.  And easily avoided.

Fix this nonsense.",1464739200,,649,4.91743119266055

Of course, as soon as it came out on Netflix, I watched the whole third season in about 3 days. Now I have to wait another year! If you haven't watched the series (and you don't mind language, sexuality, etc.) I STRONGLY recommend it. It's got some of the best ensemble acting I've ever seen. And even though I have access to the episodes streaming on Netflix, I'm buying the blu-rays anyway, because I figure someday they'll no longer stream, and I want to have it so I can pull it off the shelf. I can't say enough how incredible the acting and the writing is. It's so obviously a labor of love among the cast and crew. It's funny, it's moving, and it's about something important.",1440460800,,794,4.3355704697986575

7030967,5,B00U8BDQPC,"The saga of spoiled princess Piper Chapman continues in season 2 of the outrageous ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK. Season 1 ended with a bang and somehow for some reason Piper is in a new prison to continue her love/hate affair with the mysteriously deceitful  Alex Vause (Laura Prepon). The show's writers obviously love this show and its characters. We're taken on another wild ride in Season 2 as the back stories of the prisoners are told and as new relationships are formed and old ones are destroyed.

Sometimes it seems like our ladies are in summer camp with some restrictions but a lot of freedom. As we see in this season, the women were imprisoned for a variety of reasons. Rosa Cisneros (Barbara Rosenblat) has juicy back story. Middle-aged, frumpy and dying of cancer, Cisneros once was a gorgeous fireball with a lust for men and crime. And maybe Sister Jane Ingalls (Beth Fowler) isn't the innocent victim of a social protest as she likes to portray.  It does not get much better than this.  The back stories are delightful and insightful.

There is a new evil in the prison in the form of Yvonne ""Vee"" Parker (Lorraine Toussaint). Toussaint is standout as the conniving and diabolical Vee who can smother you with kindness with one hand and strangle you with the other. No one is safe from Vee and Toussaint is one of the best new faces around. We should be seeing more of her in other roles. On a harmless and more comical side, is the young Asian American prisoner Brook Soso (Kimiko Glenn). Young, beautiful and outspoken, the girl never stops talking...well, there is ""one"" way to get her to stop talking.

Galina ""Red"" Reznikov was ousted from her roost as the kitchen queen so now she has to create a new scheme which could lead to violence if she pushes her limits with Vee.. Kate Mulgrew was born to play ""Red"" and she is a big part of Season 2. That brings us back to pampered, angry Piper Chapman--one of the most annoying and unsympathetic ""heroes"" on TV. This season we see Piper has a dark side and her relationship with Alex only has more twists and turns. The poignant part is seeing how her relationship with  Larry Bloom (Jason Biggs) disintegrates as both try to adjust to their lives apart. Some serious stuff to consider amongst all the mayhem of prison life.  And don't forget Suzanne ""Crazy Eyes"" Warren (Uzo Aduba) one of the best characters on any show around. Crazy Eyes has her own story to tell and how crazy is she really? Maybe it's the people around her. Mix Vee and Crazy Eyes for some major trouble.

ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK is about to combine comedy with a sense of dramatic urgency. Life is no picnic in prison for these women yet somehow most survive and maybe thrive. It's an interesting character study and people tend to stay with their racial groups. The African Americans, the Latinas and the whites along with sub category of lesbians. Pity the two Asians Change and Soso. Where do they fit in? Only the seniors seem to have found racial harmony as a  mixed group.

This wonderful show entertains but is a picture into a very specific slice of life. Watch one episode and you will be addicted. And don't miss the absolutely campy ending to Season 2.",1436832000,9,3200,4.56719022687609

7030985,4,B00U8BDQPC,"The first episode is an odd and unnecessary departure. After it, the series goes back to normal, or at least as normal as it gets at Litchfield Penitentiary, which isn't normal at all. If there does exist a real-life prison with a cast of characters enveloped in a neverending drama storm this entertaining, their story isn't shot and edited this brilliantly. Forget Piper Chapman. Her mess of a love life is overshadowed by the other, more interesting people around her; the familiar ones from Season 1. The new inmates are more caricatural than realistic, but Vee at least provides the plot with a major source of conflict and Soso is cute to look at.

7030994,4,B00U8BDQPC,"Season Two is great, and I have grown to love the characters and admire the actors on this show even more, but some of the plots and subplots seem a bit more forced and/or contrived than Season One.  The actor who plays Pornstache really overacted this time around, and I'm not sure why, as he was fantastic last time around.  The actor who plays Vee (sorry I don't remember names) is the standout, her portrayal of the controlling conniving ex-heroin dealer is a knockout; she deserves an Emmy for her performance.  Crazy Eyes becomes a lot less likeable, so I hope she redeems herself in Season Three.  Entirely worth seeing if you liked the first season.",1435622400,2,657,4.637931034482759

7031035,5,B00U8BDQPC,"Orange is the New Black Season 2 is just as good as the first season, in fact I actually liked it better as other than the first episode, the rest of the season storylines don't revolve around Piper or even need Piper there to be told (she's still in each episode, except the 2nd one). This shows that when Piper is released (if the plot follows the book she was only in jail for a year) the great show will continue without missing a beat with I'm guessing Piper dealing with life as an ex con and the inside the prison plots continuing. Season 2 introduces a new villain in V, we learn a lot more about the backstories through flashback memories of the other women inmates and the politics between the guards and the prison administration continues on. Some parts of the plot you do see coming, especially what happens in the final episode when Don't Fear the Reaper is playing but it's a hell of a fun journey getting there.

I finished it and I love it more and more because it lets us get to know the characters and see different sides to them and how they ended up in the prison in the first place. It can also be both serious, touching, sad, funny, and even dare I say sexy. The characters are very detailed which makes them all the more real and you get attached to the characters so that when things happen to them you care. I am not exactly fond of the character of Piper because I think at times she can just be a horrible person but she still has her redeemable features like many of the other characters.

7031065,5,B00U8BDQPC,"Every bit as good as Season one, but better. Excellent writing, most interesting characters and I truly enjoy all of the backstories, which really helps one understand where and how these inmates arrived in the federal pen.  I never thought I would enjoy this series so I was presently surprised.
Piper Chapman appears to be the alter-ego of Piper Eressea Kerman, who found herself in real life in the same situation as Chapman now finds herself.
The true (""College"") Piper's Alma mater was Smith's. She later found herself doing time in a federal minimum security facility in Connecticut, where she served 13 months.
Admirable that Piper was able to make something productive out of what probably was an otherwise negative experience.  Real life experiences have produced what is likely a realistic portrayal of prison life in a minimum security facility.
The only problem I have with this series is, I went through Season two far too quickly and now I have to wait a very long time for Season three to be released on DVD. Season three starts to show on June 12th. The inmates will be joined by a new face in the 3rd season  Ruby Rose, who likely promises to cause some trouble for the on-again, off-again couple Alex Vause and Piper Chapman and the only other immediate question is, was Vee really killed?",1433030400,2,1307,4.774336283185841

7031082,5,B00U8BDQPC,"Orange is the New Black: Season Two is stronger, overall, than Season One. There is a lot more concentration on relationships, since regular characters have already been introduced. Because the role of Alex (Laura Prepon) is downplayed, more screen time is allocated to other, more interesting characters. This is a definite improvement, as the Alex/Piper scenes dominated Season One and became tiresome. A great addition to  Season Two is Lorraine Toussaint as Vee, an intimidating new bad guy among the prison family.

The Netflix series follows the misadventures of Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling) when a crime she committed in the past sends her to an all-womens prison with a colorful group of fellow inmates. The series traces Pipers transition from freedom and privilege to prison life.

Bonus extras on the 3-disc Blu-ray release include four behind-the-scenes featureless and audio commentaries.",1431907200,8,905,5.45
