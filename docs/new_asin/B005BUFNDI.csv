8464391,3,B005BUFNDI,"I was expecting to see more time devoted to the relationship between the wife and her husband's partner. Furthermore, the story of husband's extramarital affairs seemed like an after thought of the movie. I found the title a bit misleading. However, the acting is pretty good.",1397260800,2,276,5.021739130434782
8464392,3,B005BUFNDI,"I have several of Catherine Breillat's films, and despite the cover art and subject matter of the film, I would consider this one of her tamer films.  Most of the character's in the film only seem to care about their own personal intrests and act kinda narcissistic.  The biggest problem I found with this film was that it introduces several elements that only seem to serve the purpose of leaving unanswered questions at the end of the film.  Not sure if this was intentional of accidental, but it may just be that Catherine Breillat seems to care more about the interaction of her characters than extranious plot details.  That being said, I still found it to be worth watching, but it isn't my favorite of her films.",1374537600,8,719,4.637795275590551
8464393,5,B005BUFNDI,"Catherine Breillat is, in my mind, as good a directors as one gets. She shows people ( not just females) as they really can be...which is selfish, cruel, loving and the entire spectrum of human behavior. All of the performances in this film are top-notch. Claude B. is asked to carry off the role of an aging Lothario , to the stunning Lio! For her part, Lio is cast as the ""innocent"" who takes over and becomes the fully matured seductress....controlling the show. If you like art house or Hollywood style movies...go elsewhere. This is about testosterone fueled macho men....and devastation that often results. Good film.",1360886400,10,623,4.886792452830188
