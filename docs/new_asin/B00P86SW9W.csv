The techniques that he covers should be taken singularly and worked on.  I found his comments on shifting weight during follow though to be very helpful for me personally.  My wife picked out hold points as something that she would work on.  My buddy who borrowed them really enjoyed the eye-cam, and it illustrated that he was NOT following through enough.  All 3 of us have re-watched the videos and are working on a new thing.  These are not watch once and be done with it videos- more an evolution to keep watching to improve one facet of your technique, then another.",1432857600,2,746,4.598484848484849
