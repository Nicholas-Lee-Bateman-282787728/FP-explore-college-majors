1398574,4,B000056MOQ,"I was expecting more than one number by Miss Battle.  But I must admit that her only appearance was worth the DVD.
As far as Karajan... and the Viena Opera Ballet and the Spanish Horses.... second to none.  What a show!",1277337600,3,219,4.317073170731708

1398576,4,B000056MOQ,"Wonderful to see the Coronation Mass sung in a liturgical context, though the focus in the video is on the music (naturally), rather than the pope celebrating Mass. Very moving nontheless. Not only is Karajan a great performer; John Paul is pretty impressive, too!",1142812800,10,264,5.0227272727272725
1398577,5,B000056MOQ,"Musically this DVD is of superb quality. Von Karajan's conducting is - as usual - fantastic; the vocals are strong and without the shrill whine that passes for singing in too many performances these days (why do modern composers feel the need to use choirs composed mainly of squeaky voiced pre teens); the Orchestra is in great form; and the photography is very well done. Catholics will probably have no problem in following the Mass and relating it to the music, but people unfamiliar with the Catholic Eucharist will find themselves lost at time. The written notes on the performance are useless and I suggest that sacred music specialists will find reading Nel's article on Mozart's Coronation Mass much more useful.",1127433600,11,721,4.966942148760331

7932356,5,B000056MOQ,"I attended this Solemn Pontifical High Mass for Sts. Peter and Paul in June 1985.  I was so excited to see Maestro Von Karajan and Kathleen Battle, I could barely contain myself!  The music was simply glorious, and yes, hearing the Sistine Chapel Choir sing ""Ave Verum"" was a treat.  Unfortunately, it appears that the recessional of Palestrina's ""Tu Es Petrus"" didn't make either the CD or the DVD.",1398988800,3,399,4.753623188405797

7932358,5,B000056MOQ,"While Deutsche Grammophon offers a CD alternative, this 1985 concert in St Peter's Basilica clamours to be seen and not just heard. Where does one start? The liturgy itself is sumptuous. I'm not quite sure how much of it can be attributed directly to the itinerant preacher-man of Galilee but it's mesmerising all the same (those who lack an affiliation with the Old Firm will be mystified and rightly so). And then we have the two major participants, Herbie and JP2, together under the one baroque roof. It begs the question: who was the greater autocrat? The author of `Veritatis Splendor' or the guy who promulgated a fourth Beethoven cycle? It's an open question. When I first viewed this concert, I trembled as the Principal Conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic trooped up to receive communion from his Holiness - for a second I thought Herbie was going to `reverse polarities' by snatching the chalice from JP2 to distribute the sacred hosts in his own right: sadly in a way, there was no such occurrence. Yes indeed, this concert is the Twentieth Century's response to the Congress of Vienna (and let's not forget that a certain Princess of legendary hauteur was also in attendance).

""Archbooby"" Colloredo was right in a sense: the Old Neapolitan format of the Mass where the Credo and Gloria are broken up into distinct sections is no friend of the liturgy. It is refreshing to see a Mozart mass `go to work' in context - and how well it supplements the sacred ritual. A frail looking Herbie is clearly afire and he elicits a spirited, energetic response from the Vienna Philharmonic and the Singverein alike. The Crucifixus in particular is deeply moving. Kathleen Battle sings like a `Bright Seraphim' in the Agnus Dei and the Dona Nobis Pacem rings out like an `Urbi et Orbi' blessing from the balcony of St Peter's. Herbie made a recording of Ave Verum Corpus, K 618, in his years with the Philharmonia - sadly the performance here is by the Vatican choir alone. While the Basilica was obviously packed for the occasion - and court-biographer Richard Osborne reports it was a hot and stuffy day - the engineers have provided us with a reasonably transparent recording.

All in all, even if this performance will not make you fall to your knees, your eyes will not leave the screen. In Hoc Signo.",1334966400,5,2308,4.7675
7932359,5,B000056MOQ,"For those expecting a complete Liturgy will understand why time constraints omitted only the lengthiest of prayers and actions.  The choir and orchestra performed their very best -away from home and being positioned so closely to the 50,000 other people in the St. Peter's Basilica.

A bonus to this event is in hearing Mozart's ""Ave Verum Corpus"" sung by the Sistine Choir and a brief view of them in their place.  Their singing is very well articulated and a good contrast to the Berlin Philharmonic Choir.

All know now that this was Von Karajan's last performance in life and for the H.von K. watchers it makes the whole presentation come together.  B.P. John Paul II (now called 'Blessed' made this entire Mass possible -for without him. it would not have been so.

Catholic watchers might ask why H.V.K did not receive communion.  As a non-Catholic (read Wikipedia article) he observed the stricture which allows only baptized Catholics to receive The Body and Blood of Jesus. The Pope gave him a blessing (usual for non-communicants in line with other recipients).

The entire Mozart was splendid.  In fact, in comparison to the instrumentation vs. the organ for which Mozart wrote his Masses it was a splendid presentation.

The shots of the Basilica interior are gorgeous.

An added treat is at the conclusion  where John Paul walks down the stairway and kneels in prayer at the tomb of St. Peter (authenticated by science) .
