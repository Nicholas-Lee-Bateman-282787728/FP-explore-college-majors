Whitaker also springs on Zelwegger that he is also planning to go with her to see her son, who she had had to give up, at his commencement.  A interesting road story with little side stories to keep the simple plot going.  The movie has several parts that attempt to be artsy and bizzare.  One wonders if the director was doing drugs in editing this film.  Also I didn't get why Zelwegger had tattoos all over her arms.  It didn't seem to fit.

4435648,2,B004NBHVNG,"[Spoiler Alert!] Oscar winner Renee Zellweger plays ""Jane Wyatt.""  Yet another Oscar winner, Forest Whitaker (best known for ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High""), plays Jane's friend ""Joey.""  We learn that they met in a psych ward, as Joey has auditory and visual hallucinations, and Jane has simply had a life full of issues, including her paraplegia as the result of a car accident, leaving her as a widowed mother and wheelchair-bound.  But, of course, they each have dreams and pasts (Jane has a 10-year-old son she hardly knows because she had to give him up for adoption due to her inability to properly take care of him; Joey wants to meet his idol, an author, but his character doesn't seem to do much else), and, oh, Jane apparently can write and sing.  Joey intercepts a letter addressed to Jane from her son, a birthday party invitation, actually meaning well, aware of Jane's son, then convinces Jane to go on a road trip with him to New Orleans to finally meet his idol but with the ulterior motive of Jane also seeing her son, who also lives in that area, not telling Jane about the letter until later.  Along the way, they meet ""Billie"" (Madeline Zima) on the bus, after their car breaks down and a second one they buy is stolen (a station wagon that looks like it was reincarnated from 1983's ""National Lampoon's Vacation"").  We learn that Billie's husband has left her, so Billie tags along for a while.  After getting kicked off the bus (for a ""dine and dash"" at one of their stops), they run into a stranger named ""Caldwell"" (Oscar nominee Nick Nolte) when, are you kidding me, they hear his blues guitar from his barn while just walking the countryside at night (there goes more of the movie's credibility).  Caldwell says that he has a gig coming up but that his usual singer can't make it, so he convinces Jane to sing (predictably), but they all get ""high"" first via drug-laced cake (they all sit under a tree in the night, and we see many colors and special effects around them, a scene that seems out of place and to not belong in the movie).  At the gig, Zellweger does her own singing, and, well, let's just say that she's not exactly Sissy Spacek in ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" (when the camera pans the audience, it's difficult to tell if their facial expressions of amazement are because they're amazed that Jane's that good or because they're amazed that Jane's that bad; even Billie can't quite produce tears while watching Jane sing, in a scene going for emotion that just falls flat).  Actually, authentic Bob Dylan tunes (one of the movie's few high points) grace the soundtrack, but Dylan's music deserves a better vehicle than this clunker.  If you actually make it to watch the final third of the movie, Billie gets a call from her husband and decides to go back to him (but not before the viewer is treated to just plain awkward scenes of Joey apparently having a crush on Billie), and the viewer is obviously expected to believe that Billie will miss Jane and Joey, so why doesn't she embrace or even shake hands with Jane and Joey when she leaves?  I guess the producers wanted that scene to be consistent with the rest of the movie's distant and non-charismatic relationships, all lacking any deep-seated heart or warmth (proof that even great actors can't save a script that's this dismal, and an insufficient background on all the characters doesn't help the viewer to care more for them...or to care at all).  Next, everyone gets arrested when they unexpectedly run into the man who stole their station wagon earlier in the film and try to get it back, chasing him on the highway, in yet another scene from the movie that just doesn't work, as drama or comic relief.  Caldwell's character then just disappears (as an aside, there's a very strange, hallucinatory sequence where we see giant animated birds layered over scenes where Jane and Joey are just walking on the street during the daytime, as Jane is describing them, apparently a metaphor for her some day being able to walk again, but still an extremely odd, misguided sequence that lends even more to the movie's lack of credibility).  Though it seems like an eternity, the movie finally concludes with Jane making it to her son's birthday party and apparently establishing a more stable relationship with him, which almost salvages the movie.  Almost.",1411862400,,4347,4.707509881422925

4435659,5,B004NBHVNG,"I rented this movie for $2.00 from a Red Box because I love Renee Zellweger.  I had never heard of the movie, so I was surprised to see it for rent.  My sister and I love watching movies - both at the theater and at home. As I told my sister, ""this movie is a keeper!""

This movie is odd, quirky, and musically haunting. It is a lovely story of how our lives can touch other lives in big and small ways. The reality of broken lives all around us is too true.  The times of hopelessness and loss are too true. And the possibility for anyone of us who have been desperately hurt physically, emotionally or mentally to find acceptance, healing and/or love from another person - even someone other people dismiss as ""crazy"" or too strange - is also real. This is the foundation of this story.

The main characters are Jane, a white quadriplegic (Renee Zellweger) and Joey, a mentally unstable black man (Forest Whitaker). They are the unlikeliest of friends.  Jane is singer whose life is changed inexorably seven years earlier after a tragic accident kills her husband, leaves her wheelchair bound, and where she must give up her 3 yr old son for adoption because of being unable to care for him. She has not sung since. Joey has attached himself to Jane and helps to care for her some and is her only friend.  How they meet is characteristic of this movies depth. (I'll let you see it to understand.) Joey claims to see angels and speak to them, but of course no one else believes him - even Jane thinks he's ""mental"" about this claim.

Joey finds out his favorite author is going to be in New Orleans doing a conference to ""sell"" his latest book. This best-selling author writes about talking to angels to gain wisdom - that angels are not only real, but want to speak to us.  Joey desperately wants to go see the author so he can be vindicated about his unique gift. So Joey begs Jane to go on a road trip with him.  Joey also finds a letter from Jane's now 10 year old son (a letter she had never opened) inviting ""Jane or Mommy Jane"" to come to his 1st official communion with the address located in Baton Rouge.  Joey decides he's going to take Jane to her son's communion, but doesn't tell Jane about this part of their trip, or even that he found the letter until he was forced into it at a critical part of their trip.

The movie takes us with Jane and Joey where we witness how real life is sometimes good, sometimes bad and sometimes scary or just plain sad. While on this trip we meet other characters - some we love and some we don't. The movie uniquely explores how every person we encounter - long term or short term - can change us for the better if we are receptive.  The movie also shows how even from the most odd or unlikely of persons our own psyche can be healed and our understanding of ourselves can be expanded to give us the opportunity to stretch ourselves in new and good ways.  Life is challenging, and this movie looks at life from two extremely unlikely ""hero's"" experience and we come away feeling like we've been touched by a lovely gift.  By the way, Jane's (Renee Zellweger's) singing is incredibly moving and sweet. When Jane sings for the first time since her accident, she sings a well known but older patriotic song and it is REMARKABLY moving and heart-felt. Wow!

Treat yourself - enjoy the people, experiences and the redemption that this movie offers.

  I loved this movie!",1316908800,12,3414,4.407643312101911
4435660,4,B004NBHVNG,"I don't think this ""little"" film played many theatres when released in 2010 but it sure has GREAT credentials and star power. Just look: We have Academy Award Winners Renee Zellweger and Forest Whitaker in the key roles, Academy Award nominee (twice!) Nick Nolte (in a brief role similar to what Jeff Bridges has been doing lately) and it was directed by French Director Olivier Dahan (who won Academy Awards for the French film ""La Vie En Rose"" (the Edith Piaf story). Oh yes, did I forget to mention that it includes original songs and music by Bob Dylan???

With all that said, the film is really a ""small quiet film"". It's the story of two ""friends"" - one the crippled Zellweger (who used to be a singers-songwriter - with a vinyl Lp to her name!) and Whitaker - who has some mental issues (and sees angels!) and cares for - and transports Zellweger They set out on a journey to attend her (now adopted) son's Communion in New Orleans. You've seen these films before and this has a good story line though you know where it will end. The thing that makes this film ""quirky""- and you'll find yourself saying ""what the heck?"" is that there is a small side story which involves the legendary blues singer Robert Johnson and his pact with the devil at the ""Crossroads"" in Mississippi and at another point, animated birds begin to appear for no reason.

Those looking for Dylan's music will be frustrated as well. He sings seven songs on the soundtrack to move the action, but these are usually only one verse and a chorus, lasting less than a minute. The only full Dylan track is the nice ""Life is Home"" which he sings over the end credits. This is a Dylan song that Zellweger sings in a scene in the film. (She also sings Woody Guthrie's ""This Land is Your Land"" in a most unusual arrangement. Nolte plays guitar while Zellweger sings the Guthrie tune.

So, if you are looking for something ""different"" - think ""Independent Film"", this is worth watching. I enjoyed all the acting performances. I'm still wondering about some of those ventures off the beaten track but it was 105 minutes I'm glad I spent. And, obviously, Zellweger, Whitaker, Nolte AND Dylan did this for more than just a ""paycheck"".

The standard DVD - which I watched - has only the Trailer as a bonus. I understand the Bluray has a ""making of"" featurette.

Basically the story line involves a woman(Renee Zellwenger)  who, having been injured in an accident and now in a wheelchair, had to give up her baby son seven years hence, because she could no longer care for him.

the plot

Jane had a career as a recording artist, but after the car accident that has left her paralyzed and a window, she is living the low life somewhere in Marysville, Kansas. Her one friend Joey, is a stuttering/borderline schizophrenic who believes that he talks with angels all of the time. He visits her regularly and one day after he slept over on the couch Jane went to get some physical therapy on her legs at the local hospital. When Joey wakes up he searches her house for an angel book he lent her, and ransacks the whole place. She returns to an empty, looted-looking home with angry neighbors and policemen looking for Joey.

Joey sneaks back at night and breaks into the home while she's sleeping and tries to clean up the mess, and he comes across a letter written to Jane from her son who was put in foster care when Jane was still in her coma after the car accident. He was eventually adopted, but he wanted to invite her to his communion party in Baton Rouge. Joey asks Jane to go on a road trip to New Orleans where he can hear a man speak who claims to be an authority on angels. He doesn't let on that he knows about her son. On the way, they experience quite an adventure. After Jane's car overheats, they buy another car and this one gets stolen by the guy who sold it to her. They run into a girl named Billie who ""lost her husband."" She invites them to a garden party at her sister's house. They meet up with a musician guy who lives in the sticks and offers them cake with hallucinatory drugs baked into it, which created some magic one night.

Jane is a moody woman who hates talking about her past, whether it is about her husband, her son or her singing career. Joey has to walk on tiptoes I order to get Jane to see her son. Will he get her to him, or will her stubbornness ruin his plans. Find out when you watch My Own Love Song.

the breakdown

Renee Zellweger plays the lead character Jane in this film. She dyed her hair brown, and for the first half of the movie it seemed like her eyes had brown contacts hiding her natural green eye color. Her beauty was camouflaged underneath this faade, and it totally changed her demeanor and appearance. I easily believed the broken woman under this hard shell that Renee so effortlessly wore as Jane. Forest Whitaker of course always seems to land these roles of a misunderstood soul. He's someone who you'll need to look closely at to understand and appreciate. Joey seemed kind of borderline to me, like maybe if the ""angels"" told him to, that he may hurt Jane really bad. Of course this doesn't happen in the movie, but even though his best friend is Jane, his loyalties lie with the voices he hears, and that's scary to me.

The script doesn't allow any depth to the character of Jane or Joey, but especially Joey. His past was only mentioned briefly and I felt it could have easily gone a bit deeper. The other main characters include Billie played by Madeline Zima and Caldwell played by Nick Nolte. Oddly, despite the image of Nolte's mug shot burned into our brains, comparatively here the actor seemed to be the voice of reason out of the four of them. Madeline Zima gave a slightly touching performance, but with the overhanging cloud of uncertainty of whether Billie is also kind of kooky herself. Did she really lose her husband as she claimed, or was this on par with Joey's claim that he can hear and see angels? In my opinion, this question was never answered and this goes for Joey's delusion as well.

For a person who is not into Bob Dylan, I must admit that I enjoyed the soundtrack which includes songs like Life Is Hard, Forgetful Heart, It's All Good and I Feel a Change Comin On. Sometimes the songs will be performed by Renee or Forest, but this only added to the special element it leaves. I liked the beautiful cinematography used periodically during the film. I particularly enjoyed the hotel scene towards the beginning as Zellweger was wheeling passed the windows of her friends' rooms to get to her own. It was both voyeuristic and poetic at the same time. Also, the scene where the tribe is sitting in the dark Louisiana sky next to a fire and watching the crazy light show emulating from their drug-induced mind's eye. There was a magical element to this scene, giving a sense of unity as they all were experiencing the same delusions. It's too bad that the film suffers from a lack of closure and certainty. Was this trip all for nothing, led by a person's mental defect? The viewers will decide on their own.
