1201355,1,B00000F4F3,"What a disappointment! I remember when I first heard that Nora Roberts was emulating Danielle Steel and allowing some of her books to be developed into TV movies, I was so anxious to see the end results. I am a lifelong D. Steel  fan & have virtually every novel and TV movie she has made. I like Nora Roberts' work as well, but admittedly, I am a sucker for the TV movie romance genre (Thanking the ""TV Gods"" for Lifetime and Lifetime & Hallmark Movie Channels as we speak!!). The Steel adaptations have been so good & well-acted by and large, so I was also very hopeful for N. Roberts' works. Well, wishful thinking can only take you so far!!!

This movie was a dud in every sense of the word. The plot was scattered and nonsensical, the acting was horrific, the romance fizzled, and the dialogue was a crime against humanity!!! I kept wondering what kind of a bet Heather Locklear must have lost for her to agree to be part of this mess. Heather Locklear--the TV darling who has created such memorable characters & wowed audiences with her impressive acting range from drama to comedy and back again over the years--presents such an unlikeable & confusing character in this movie. Instead of Locklear's patent vixen, love to hate characters or her female heroines with heart & humor, we have a traumatized former chef suffering the apparent affects of PTSD, who might be the victim of a gaslighting OR who might be a murderess in disguise. Bottom line: You won't care!!! At least I didn't. The story bounces all over the place and the plot is way too convoluted. And, the so-called romance between Locklear's Reece & Johnathon Schaech's brooding Brody was so dull it was almost painful to watch at times...Much like the movie itself!! Save yourself some money....Rent it, don't buy it, and you be the judge!!!",1214438400,,1812,4.659375
1201356,1,B00000F4F3,"Thanks to all of you who saved me the time and money that I would have wasted buying the movie and watching it. I did read the book before I was even aware that there was a movie made from it. I have to say that I loved the book, and had actually thought that there should be a movie made from it. I was thinking that someone along the lines of Jennifer Love Hewitt as Reece, and Josh Holloway (""Sawyer"" on LOST) as Brody. Again, Really-read the book-it sounds like it is, at the very least, ten thousand times better than the movie. I, for one, am not wasting one penny or one second on the movie-thanks!",1210896000,2,605,4.135593220338983
1201357,4,B00000F4F3,"I had read the book and loved it.  It kept me on the edge till the end.  The movie was set in beautiful scenery and I liked it alot.  The book was better, but you can't get it all in a movie in an hour and a half.  Wish they would have done a mini series!  I bought the movie and 3 other made for TV movies by Nora Roberts.  I have enjoyed all of them. This one the most!",1201305600,,371,3.575
1201358,3,B00000F4F3,"This is not a family movie. The acting was okay but not the greatest. The story line was good but predictable.

A woman already traumatized by a resteraunt shooting ends up witnessing another killing but no one can find the body which leads the towns people to believe she is crazy! Of course, the hero of the story steps in and tries to help prove that she isn't crazy. There is a twist at the end but could have been done smoother with more clarity.",1190592000,,451,4.305882352941176
1201359,5,B00000F4F3,"Nora Robert's Angel's Fall  I loved this movie a lot. The actors were top notch in protraying their roles. I enjoyed Heather Locklear in this movie. She did an excellent job protraying her ""haunted"" character. The drama and suspense grew to the end and the end was a suprise! I loved it!",1190073600,,287,4.519230769230769
1201360,4,B00000F4F3,"""Angel's Fall"", based on a book written by Nora Roberts, is an engaging movie that is likely to entertain you, and that has enough ingredients of a good thriller to keep you at the edge of your seat.

The main character is Reece (Heather Locklear), a young woman that survived a massacre in her Boston restaurant and has been running from what happened, never settling too long anywhere. Despite that, she decides to settle at least for a little while in a small but very beautiful Wyoming town, Angel's Falls. Reece gets a job at a diner, manages to make some new friend and even meets Brody (Johnathon Schaech), a handsome writer she is somewhat attracted to, even though he irritates her. Unfortunately, Reece's luck doesn't hold, and she ends up witnessing from afar what seems to be a murder. But did Reece really saw a crime, or is she so traumatized by what happened to her in Boston that she is imagining things?

If you are interested in knowing what happened and how things develop between Reece and Brody, simply watch this movie. Truth to be told, it is different from the book on which it is based, but nonetheless good enough on its own to be worth watching. That is the reason why I give this movie 3.5 stars out of 5. Recommended...

1201361,2,B00000F4F3,"I first want to say that I did not read the book this movie is based on. So it is not that I do not like the movie because of changes made to the story. It is just not a good movie. The story is not exciting at all. Heather Locklear was a beautiful woman once, but I kept looking at her cheeks (has she got implants??), she looked so odd. And waaaay too old for this part! Don't understand why she needed plastic surgery, she used to look better than this. But about the story: predictable, not interesting and a bit lame actually. I was sorry to have bought the DVD.
'Montana Sky' was better.",1189987200,7,593,4.120689655172414
1201362,4,B00000F4F3,"This is one of my favorite Nora Roberts books and although no movie can ever be as good as the book I was surprised by this movie. I was a bit scared at the thought of Heather Locklear playing Reese, seeing on how that she is in her early 40's now (I think), but more so because she did not really fit the physical description of Reese in the book. However, I was surprised at her acting and found that I liked her as Reese a lot. Johnathon Schaech as Brody was absolutely PERFECT! He is an extremely good looking guy and was great as the brooding Brody, although unfortunately they did not incorporate that aspect of him in the movie as he was in the book. Still, he was a great choice for the role.
Of course I do think the movie could of been better had they not of cut so much out of it but still, for a 90 or so minute television movie its pretty good. If you are a hardcore Nora Roberts fan and hate to see anything cut of movies that were in the book then you may not like this adaptation, still, its entertaining and full of beautiful people who's acting skills are better than expected.",1189900800,12,1095,4.145539906103286
1201363,3,B00000F4F3,I read the book (which was one of my favourites) and I know changes must be made to the script for a shorter version - still it was a good movie. I think that the perfect actors were chosen for each character in the story.. Well done!!,1189123200,,235,4.0212765957446805

I take issue with the dialogue. All the characters kept saying to this poor, traumatized woman, who was almost killed, ""Well, you're not taking any medication, are you?""

""Good.""
Hello? She was scared out of her mind. That kind of fear is almost physically painful. And everyone in the movie kept making sure she wasn't taking any drugs, like that's a bad thing?

1201521,3,B00000F4F3,"Ok, first off in order not to be too disappointed, you must realize that this is not your typical big budget full length Hollywood movie. In fact it is only about 95 minutes long, which will make it a good TV movie.

The sets in this movie and the scenery are the greatest asset to this film. The plot, was a bit too contrived, this irritated me. Why on the said morning of a murder, just come to town, Reece (Heather Locklear) would be the only person on hand to witness this event?

It is at that point her disturbed past is revealed and questions arise concerning her mental state. Feeble attempts are made to project some misdirection, but the real bad guy is just too obvious.

As a sub-plot, the residents of the community seem very pre-occupied with getting into the ladies' pants, and three mild sex scenes are thrown in to try to add some spice the film.

Overall, this film is just OK, and nothing here really to rave about.",1318896000,,934,4.381502890173411

I ordered this movie as well as other Lifetime movies that I love, in anticipation of fall and winter weather ahead.  Nothing like a Lifetime movie on a rainy or snowy day with a cup of hot tea!  I would recommend this movie to anyone else who loves Lifetime.",1315008000,,436,3.9318181818181817
1201523,4,B00000F4F3,"I'm not a Nora Roberts fan but enjoyed this movie enough to want to read the book. I like the storyline, the characters and the setting with its incredible scenery. I disagree with those who criticize Heather Locklear as the lead part - she did a great job of portraying the tough but vulnerable Reece which was refreshing to see since a lot of her parts are of arrogant, overly-confident types. I also like the romance between Reece and Brody which was effective without being too sappy.  Overall enjoyable movie!",1301356800,3,514,4.711111111111111

The movie was actually boring and  I was continually distracted by Heather Locklear's appearance. Unfortunately her plastic surgery makes her face appear swollen,  distorted and ugly; i could not believe that this woman was once attractive; way too old to play this role in this very dull, uninteresting movie.",1298592000,2,414,4.9
1201525,1,B00000F4F3,"I was so disappointed in the movie.  The book is one of my favorites, and while I'm not naive enough to think that you can pack a novel into 90 minutes of film, I was really hopeful they would do a better job than this.  Heather Locklear was awful as Reece; too old, too calm, too unemotional.  The woman cast as Joanie did an okay job, but the character was changed so much she was almost unrecognizable.  And while I know some things must change when a story is adapted for t.v., things that I felt were integral to the characters were changed for no reason I could see (Reece being the one who x'd out the faces in the photo, the fight between Joanie and Reece in the kitchen).  Jonathan Schaech did well with what he had to work with, but the romantic scenes between he and Locklear came across, in my opinion, as agressive and somewhat creepy on his part.  I felt like if I hadn't read the book the movie would have been very confusing, but since I did the read the book, it was very disappointing.  And when did Reece get electro-shock therapy??  I'm going to go read the book now, and hope it scrubs this movie from my mind.",1269129600,2,1131,4.252336448598131
1201526,5,B00000F4F3,"I thought the movie was a fine effort - Heather Locklear and Johnathon Schaech do well in their roles, and the plot follows the Nora Roberts formula for the most part, even if not exactly in all the details of the book (what movie does?). Yes, Locklear is a bit older than her lead (in reality we're only talking 8 years). In today's world that's hardly the point, but a few of the reviewers seem to be preoccupied with that rather than the merits of the movie & want to count wrinkles (geez, go play in your room if you've nothing else to do). Locklear, like a number of other mid-aged actresses (Jennifer Aniston, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sharon Stone, Halley Berry anyone?) looks good. It's refreshing that not all actresses have to be 20-somethings for these roles, and frankly, it's about time. We aren't talking Oscar material here, but these kind of movies never are - they're supposed to be lighter fare, like a beach novel, with a bit of suspense, a twist of mystery & romance thrown in, & plausible ending. That's precisely what you've got here. It's entertaining and enjoyable.",1268438400,8,1082,4.670157068062827

Locklear's peculiar facial cosmetic semi-disfigurement is distracting, but the leading man had no such problems, was pretty good, engaging, and so very easy on the eyes.  Sadly, the last half degenerated into a laughable made for TV movie.  The best was when she was running through a birch tree forest, hysterical with fear,  out in the middle of nowheresville on the side of a mountain and was miraculously found by both the boyfriend AND the sherrif simultaneously.  WTH?  Was she running with a tracking device?  The very last scene was kind of like the director yelled ""That's a wrap!"" before anyone was ready or prepared.

With all the young actresses out there surly they could have found someone else to do the part.

The acting left much to be desired as well.  It was almost as if every actor on the screen mentally told themselves: ""Hey! This is for Lifetime, let's do a half a** job.  We still get paid whether the movie is crap or not.""
Also, I think that the editing was entirely shoddy.  If you haven't read the book you might be okay with the flow of the movie, but if you have there might be places were you have to stop and go: ""Uh?""

For the most part it followed the book with just a few changes, but the acting was horrible.  Heather Locklear is a decent actress, but I don't know what she was doing here - it definitely was not acting.  The scene where she heard the car backfire was comical.  She was supposed to look like she was ducking for cover, in fear for her life.  Instead it looked like she was doing an initial rehearsal of the the scene, going ""ok, this is where I hear the car, think it's gunfire, and I go like this...""

For those of you who have seen the movie but not read the book, please do yourselves a favor and read the book.  You'll be pleasantly surprised, and hopefully the book will wash the foul taste of this movie out of your head.",1216771200,,861,4.2073170731707314

The male love interest does a good job portraying the character in the book.  The problem:  I thought the male character in the book was a butt.  This actor is good at joking around when he has a nicer person to portray.  I wish they had gone with that instead of trying to shock us with the zapping thing. Sigh.
  Other than that I love that she is making a new life.  She's working through her issues and bringing a murderer to justice.  She's also near the Tetons and Jackson Hole which is an area I enjoy.",1516233600,,675,4.277777777777778

7906605,5,B00000F4F3,"Angels Fall is a low budget likely made for TV movie, it follows the formula of casting a known face actress from a popular show from the past, well in this case Heather Locklear had been on a few (Melrose Place, T J Hooker to name but two) who is probably grateful for whatever work they get. To keep the costs down the other actors are pretty much unknowns, with viewers maybe only recognising their faces from other TV movies.  Sometimes as the years go by the other actors end up on a popular TV show or become bigger stars than the anchor famous face actor, but in Angels Fall case, this hasn't been the case yet, although granted it is only nine years old (released in 2007) at the time of this review and there's still time for that.

If you're finding this in physical stores these days you're only paying a couple of dollars for it, it's amongst a wide range of budget DVDs with a big name to get you to pick it up.  In fact you can also get this one with three other movies based on Nora Roberts books for the same couple of dollars price the other single movies go for.  So I base my rating on the fact you're likely only paying a dollar or two for this or watching it on TV.  Of course if you're buying this in a few years time and having to pay a regular movie DVD price or even more, well you might be a bit more critical.  But for me, for a cheap budget movie, Angels Fall is a lot better most of the other movies you'll get for the same price.

Locklear may well be a bit old, and have had obvious plastic surgery, but it's still more than completely plausible that an older woman who still looks like her would have every guy including younger ones not in a relationship in a small town wanting to sleep with her.  I  have never read the book, perhaps the character is different in that, but for me, Locklear as Reese fits the plot of the movie of a woman with issues being stranded in a small town while her car is repaired (likely by locals prepared to prolong and con whatever money they can from her).  It's a fun movie, basically continuously asking the question, is Reese crazy or did she actually witness a murder from the top of a cliff occurring on the river far below, and is the killer messing with her head.

Angels Fall maybe would have been more successful with a better title, but overall it's not a bad movie, and if you find it amongst the budget range of movies in your discount store, it's well worth paying a couple of dollars for.",1456876800,,2468,4.2076271186440675
