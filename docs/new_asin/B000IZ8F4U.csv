8196686,5,B000IZ8F4U,"Ford lovers as well as classic car lovers will delight in this.  My personal favorite was the 1960 ad for the Galaxie, the Thunderbird and the 1960 Falcon.  These three gems of 1960 are heralded with songs, fireworks and dancing.  And why not?  They were some very COOOOOOOL cars indeed!  Just LOVE that Falcon!",1175731200,,311,4.685185185185185
