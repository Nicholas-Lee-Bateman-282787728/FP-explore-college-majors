The plot is pretty simple.  A group of folks who feel they've been wronged by an attorney gang up together to eliminate their enemy...through sequential brawls.  Before each brawl, the offended party has a heart-to-heart with Andrew, the attorney, to explain why they're out to see him beaten and dead.  The three women who have a problem with him also try a bit of seduction to torture him more...which equates to giving him a show of what he's missing out on.  Two of the three women are on the decline, but still pretty for such a low-budget flick.  Seriously, this was filmed almost entirely in a warehouse/garage.  The streamlined story means that not much more is necessary, but it is what it is.

The fights aren't terrible.  On par with good professional wresting matches.  That and the gratuitous nudity are the major points of the movie.  Adjust your expectations to the budget and you'll find something to enjoy here, warts and all.",1354233600,,1106,4.732984293193717
7899410,1,6305947864,"This is perhaps one of the worst ""movies"" I've ever seen.  Merely an excuse for some aging porn dropouts to show their sagging (...), and their lack of any kind of acting talents.  However, the lead in this one, (whoever plays Adrian Lane) is so bad, he makes the bimbos look good.  Not a thing to recommend it, don't waste your precious time!!!!!",1088553600,4,347,4.476190476190476
