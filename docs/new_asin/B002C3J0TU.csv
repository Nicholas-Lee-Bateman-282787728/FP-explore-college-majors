8363024,3,B002C3J0TU,"A great premise with poor execution. We need more movies about smart, driven young women from diverse backgrounds. We also need more movies about debate. Unfortunately, this movie gets close to fulfilling both needs but doesn't quite succeed. While Gina Philips does fine acting in this film, the plot is obvious and I feel like the film is shallow - it never digs deep enough into the narrator's internal conflicts. I'd be more interested to talk to the woman whose life the movie is based on than watch the film. If you want to watch a better movie about a female debater, watch A Sort of Homecoming.",1508284800,,602,4.635514018691588

8363026,1,B002C3J0TU,"I think they spent $10 making this movie. There is a total lack of coherent plot, coherent character development, or well, coherent anything.  Don't watch this movie unless you want to lose faith in humanity or unless you have a serious misunderstanding of debate.",1470268800,,264,5.0
8363027,1,B002C3J0TU,"As a former debater, I can say that this movie is horribly inaccurate on the policy debate side. You do not make the Harvard debate team by asking your opponent what topicality is during cross ex... Unless you're the main character of this movie.

As someone who has ever seen other movies, I can say that this is an overall atrocity. It makes light of rape (can you say Dramatic Interp?) while being thin on both plot and character development. Seriously the longest hour an a half ever. Don't waste your time.",1466467200,,511,4.554347826086956
8363028,3,B002C3J0TU,The lead actress in the show is a little mixed up (like a lot of people just out of the nest).  Good story.,1440374400,,107,3.652173913043478
8363029,5,B002C3J0TU,"it was informative ,sexy, not expected turn of events, has Sendhil ramamurthy in it from Covert Affairs,
gave it to my friends college age daughter by request, actually has a moral to the story.",1294185600,,194,4.735294117647059
8363030,4,B002C3J0TU,I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I decided to get Love and Debate because I am a big Adam Rodriguez fan.  I took a chance on the movie and I enjoyed it and the service was excellent.  I received the DVD in great condition and in record time!,1257724800,,247,4.0
8363031,5,B002C3J0TU,"""Love and Debate"" tells the story of a Jewish Latina girl, Jordan (Philips), who grows up in a family, where the customary role of women is to get married to a Jewish man and have kids.  Yet this is not enough for Jordan, she aspires to be something more.  In her senior year of high school, with the help of a teacher, Coach Amal (Sean Astin), she finds herself attracted to the debate scene.  Immediately, she knows she's found her calling and quickly becomes one of the top debaters in the country, earning a scholarship to Harvard.
While at college, through a bad breakup and a horrifying sexual assault, she struggles to continue to keep her life under control and appease her family and almost loses everything she's worked so hard for.

This is a fantastic coming of age story of a girl wanting to break free from tradition and live life the way she's intended to.  I'm sure everyone can find parallels with this story, as we've all grown up and gone through the trials and tribulations of being a teenager, making decisions (good and bad) and dealing with those ""bumpy roads"" along the way. With an inspirational plot-line and a star-studded cast, much like Jordan's character, nothing is average about ""Love and Debate.""",1249603200,4,1229,4.6976744186046515
