1031387,4,6305470146,"The only reason that I continue to wade through the dross that makes up the majority of cinema is in order to stumble across films like 'The Asphyx'. Back when BBC1 and ITV in the UK used to show late night movies, films of it's ilk would regularly turn up and be etched forever into impressionable young minds like mine. I remember first seeing it after my father taped it off of the now defunct 'Thames Television' station back in the early nineteen eighties. Images from it have stayed with me to this day and, reappraising it again, I was impressed by how well it has stood the test of time and how it treats its subject matter in the kind of adult and deftly subtle manner that you very rarely see in horror-film making these days. It's a thoroughly interesting horror film because there is not really an evil character in it - indeed, the character who would generally be tarred with the ""evil"" brush in a less subtle treatment is deeply humanitarian and only really motivated by a profound sense of loss and a fear of being left alone in the world. It's this fear and vulnerability that will eventually set in motion a chain of events that will have devastating consequences for all involved, but, as it is, the rendering of the character by the late, great Robert Stephens engenders only sympathy for his plight as that which he holds most dear is slowly and systematically stripped away. There is virtually no onscreen gore in this film and virtually no violence, but it's denouement is still one of the most haunting that I've ever seen and leads me to wonder whether a young Stephen King didn't borrow elements of it for 'The Green Mile'. In the hands of a director like Christopher Nolan, a remake of this film would be most welcome, if crafted with same care and attention lavished on the original. Try and get hold of the Umbrella Entertainment release of the DVD if you can, as it's not panned and scanned.",1235174400,2,1921,4.538904899135447

The transfer of the film leaves a lot to be desired and in some places is below average. But the region 4 disc has the whole movie uncut. Unlike the UK region 2 , which has over ten minutes cut from the movie.

If you a fan of Hammer Horror films , then you will like this film. Even though it is not an hammer film.",1221782400,,392,4.012820512820513
1031389,4,6305470146,"""The Asphyx"" is a 1973 British horror film directed by Peter Newbrook. It was also known as ""Spirit of the Dead"" and ""The Horror of Death"". It stars Robert Stephens and Robert Powell.

It tells the exploits of rich Scientist-Philanthropist Sir Hugo Cunningham, who discovers an unimaginable blur being recorded while he searches the negatives of dying men whom he had recorded. Later on, at a party, he is making a motion picture of his wife and son, who are playing in a pool and ends up filming their accidental deaths as well. At first, Cunningham doesn't realize that he's captured that same misshapen blur on the camera, but once he does, he comes to a conclusion: that the blur is a person's soul leaving the body. It isn't until he re-examines the pictures and film however, that he makes the startling discovery that the blur was not moving away from the bodies of those who were dying, it was moving TOWARDS them. After doing some research, the good Doctor finds that he has found a ticket to immortality through the blur, an ancient Greek spirit known as an ""Asphyx"". According to legends, the spirit will appear only at the moment of a person's death to take them away to the Underworld. Cunningham, in his brilliant madness soon deduces that if he can only stop this process from happening at all, it would make any person immortal and unable to die... unless their particular Asphyx is released.

The Doctor soon goes to his task and makes a deal with his adopted son for help in perfecting and utilizing the procedures, and, from there his laboratory becomes filled with torturous devices and instruments of death. He soon comes to understand however, that immortality comes at a high price, not easily fulfilled by mortal man.

1031391,4,6305470146,"The Asphyx is set apart from the usual run of horror movies by its intelligent and literate script and a  more thoughtful tone than we usually get from the genre
The setting is London in the year 1873 .The protagonist is a distinguished amateur scientist and beloved philantrophist ,Sir Hugo Cunningham (Robert Stephens)a man obsessed by research into psychic pheneomena ,a result of his son's accidental death some years previously. During his researches he makes a major discovery-when photographing people at the very point of death Sir Hugo finds that every single shot has a distinctive smudge on it .They depict a strange,blurry shape .It is not due to a defect in the photographic process ;the chemicals used in the process have resulted in his being able to photograph and immobilise The Asphyx ,the spirit of Death which according to ancient Greek mythology comes for every living soul at the hour of their departure. Aided by his foster son Giles (Robert Powell ) he traps the Asphyx of a guines pig thus rendering the creature immortal .He traps his own Asphyx and endeavours to do the same for Giles and his  natural daughter Christie (Jane Lapotaire).Things go badly awry ,the results being tragic and truly horrible especially for Sir Hugo

The movie is not without some problems of logic -why for example did Hugo change the method of inducing death given that the original method employed  worked in his own case ?Also The actual Asphyx is pretty unconvincing -it is clearly a puppet.
However what you do get is a cerebral Gothic movie with elements of horror and the supernatural .Its conclusion -some 100 years into the future- is genuinely disturbing -and the movie while morbid and a genuine oddity is also thoughtful ,well made and acted with conviction by a talented cast .It is a movie where -unusually for the genre -the scientist is a genuinely nice guy ,motivated by a desire to do good .

I urge those wanting a variation from the genre norm to give this movie a try",1198972800,2,1993,4.798833819241983
1031392,4,6305470146,"Here's a film whose focus preoccupies us all at points in our lives.  Science Fiction, though regarded often as adventure or travel to exotic planets, concerns itself often with spirituality, about the very fundamentals of life and death.

Take the races of Star Trek whose spirituality is essential to them such as Bajorans or the Vulcans.  Indeed, for Vulcans, the ""katra"" or ""soul"" can be preserved or even transferred from person to person as we see in ""Star Trek III: The Search For Spock"".  While in the Star Wars universe, there's the ""force"" an energy manifestation which manipulates objects, causes damage or can be used for healing.

This 1973 British film has the atmospheric feel of a Hammer Horror film.  Most of the characters in ""The Asphyx"" are obsessed with death, as it's all around them.  Dying and its aftermath are deftly explored through photography and an invention a scientist has perfected.  Before long, he's playing with powerful forces beyond his control and everyone he tries to help and each plan attempted simply goes awry.  A more recent film, with a similar vibe is ""Flatliners"" - starring Julia Roberts.

So if you enjoy more serious or spiritual aspects of Science Fiction, give ""The Asphyx"" a try.  It's definitely not a joyful thrill ride, but the questions it explores are those which we've all thought about.  More darkly thrilling and at times even horrific than just a purely intellectual exercise, ""The Asphyx"" will definitely stay in your memory far after the credits roll.",1158278400,,1516,4.972222222222222

1031394,4,6305470146,"""The Asphyx"" a/k/a ""The Horror of Death"" is one of the most original and yet most unheralded English horror films. Set in 1870's England, aristocrat Sir Hugo (Robert Stephens) accidentally photographs an entity (mythological name Asphyx)  entering a person's body at their death. Sir Hugo theorizes that each person has their own Asphyx and that if the entity can be imprisoned outside the body, the person will be immortal. Guess what happens next.

From the physiological standpoint, the concept is not that different from the idea of vampires and zombies; with the same need to suspend disbelief to really enjoy things. Although like the implications of time travel, half the fun is speculating on the ramifications of the idea.

There is a pleasant and very haunting score and the story has a nice touch of irony as Sir Hugo's first experimental subject is his eventual downfall.

The real strength of this film is the production design. Considerable effort went into the meticulously constructed sets and there was much attention to detail in the various scientific apparatus and instruments. While the historical accuracy of these advanced devices is suspect, they are certainly no harder to accept than the basic premise. All looks great on the big screen and is probably fine on the letter boxed DVD, but the VHS tape is of marginal quality and the 4x3 aspect ratio does not do justice to the frame.

Few films from the era that did a better job of filling their frames than ""The Asphyx"" (credit to Academy award winning cinematographer Freddie Young), but this just magnifies the problems of the full-screen version. It appears that the 1989 Interglobal Home Video trimmed nine minutes from the film and was recorded at the LP speed, so you should avoid that one if possible.",1133481600,45,1784,4.953177257525083
1031395,3,6305470146,"though marred by its apparent desire to be intellectually stimulating (certain death for many horror films) The Asphyx is saved by an emotional performance from Robert Stephens as Sir Hugo Cunningham, a photographer who  has discovered the secret of immortality in 1875. Stephens recites his  hokey lines with conviction, and if it weren't for blunt editing, lapses in  logic (notice the camera change positions when Sir Hugo watches a film of  Clive's death), and its snotty british desire for respectability, this  movie would surely have a prominent place in the pantheon of great 70's  horror films. if you prefer Hammer to AIP than you just might enjoy this  throwback to the early days of Quatermass and Baron Frankenstein, but if  you like your horror with a lot of action and ""sobaditsfunny""ness  then the only thing here for you is probably the cheesy puppet used to  portray the title creature.  overall, an entertainingly adequate flawed  cult classic.",960854400,2,963,5.102564102564102

1031682,5,6305470146,"Repetition aside, I have to echo the sentiments of those who say this is a highly underrated film, and I'm actually kind of glad to see this wasn't a modern Hollywood remake because I know they would have screwed it up with pointless CG and unnecessary sex scenes. Yes, the special effects aren't gorgeous, but if you like that rough, gritty feel of vintage horror flicks, this is a must-see. Personally, I thought the very dated quality of the ghost (""Asphyx"") animation made it weirder and creepier. However, if you're looking for excessive blood, gore and violence as well as senseless killing, you're going to want to pass on this title. There's some blood here and there, but it's, I guess you could say, tasteful. Unlike many older horror films, this one isn't swimming in blood. Rather, it's the story of one brilliant man's pursuit for something that should perhaps remain unattainable, and the price he pays for trying to play God.

I found out about The Asphyx on a list of lesser known horror films, and by luck, I saw a beat-up VHS copy of it at my local thrift store about a year later and had to buy it. Note that this film has two alternate titles as well: ""Spirit of the Dead"" and ""Horror of Death."" A short overview of the film goes sort of like this: Guy is fascinated with death and taking photos of people at the moment of death, which is how he learns about the Asphyx, which is allegedly a Greek mythology-based figure that seems to be a ghost of death. It enters the person's body right as they're about to die, and I guess it kills them? I'm not sure about the history of the mythological figure, as I haven't been able to find much information about it, so it might just be some BS that was made up for the movie.

Anyway, the aforementioned guy - Dr. Hugo Cunningham - goes on to discover that if he can trap a person's asphyx at the moment of death (I guess each person has their own individual one), that person could achieve immortality. He does this to himself first and his method involves bringing himself to the very brink of death to lure the asphyx out, then capturing it with some kind of convoluted contraption. He succeeds, and then becomes obsessed with the idea of giving his surviving loved ones immortality. Alas, things don't work out all that well during his subsequent tries with others. I don't want to include too many spoilers in my review, but I did like the way it ended because it wasn't happy. Nobody had a good day.

Creepy, weird, original, no loose ends, no crappy sequels. I just fail to see anything wrong with this film, so to hell with the naysayers. This is one of my personal favorites as far as horror movies, and while I enjoy a good, bloody slasher film as much as the next person, this one just really tickled my fancy. I'd recommend it to anyone with a taste for vintage films, horror films, or just anyone who likes their movies a little different. Also, if you tell people about this movie, be prepared to know how to spell it so they can look for it. Just about every single person I've mentioned it to has asked, ""What's an 'ass-fix?""'",1424390400,,3105,4.463028169014085

Now I have nothing against Aesop's Fables and the very sensible wisdom contained therein, but it's too bad that this '70's fiasco falls flat on it's face especially when compared to earlier movies such as the 1960 production of ""The Time Machine"", 1954 ""20,000 Leagues Under The Sea"" or 1945 ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"".

In the case of ""The Eye"", we learn about the existence of such ghost-like beings through metaphysical means. In ""The Asphyx"", on the other hand, this bizarre mystery is revealed by good old Victorian science. There are a few incidents of unintentional humor (such as the very contrived boating accident near the beginning of the film), as well as the physical appearance of the puppet-like Asphyx. In addition, some viewers may feel the pacing is a bit slow. But it's great to see this film restored and presented as it was suppose to be seen. If you've only seen this film in the chopped up, pan-scanned, and color desaturated prints shown on late night television, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1381968000,,1134,4.942408376963351
1031944,4,6305470146,"There were so many horror films that I first saw at drive-ins in the 1970s, that one needed to be rather special in order for me to remember it. THE ASPHYX certainly qualifies for it contains one of the most original screenplays that I've ever encountered in a horror movie. The idea sounds like something out of Arthur Machen or Conan Doyle with the meticulous background attention to detail that you find in the  novels of Bram Stoker. Victorian scientist and local philanthropist Sir Hugo Cunningham (Robert Stephens - THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES), whose hobby is taking photos of ""sleeping beauties"" (people who have just died - like those in THE OTHERS), discovers the existence of a spirit of death or Asphyx that comes to claim the soul right at the moment of departure. He surmises that if he can somehow find a way to trap this ""spirit"", then he can never die. With the assistance of his family he succeeds in his ambition but this leads him on a downward spiral that will cost him and his loved ones dearly.

Along with the highly literate screenplay, THE ASPHYX has amazing production values for what is basically a low-budget film. In addition to meticulous attention to set detail and surroundings (you really feel that you are in the Victorian Era), the movie was photographed by one of England's premiere cinematographers, Freddie Young, who shot the David Lean epics LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, and DR ZHIVAGO. It is simply gorgeous to look at and the look of the film aids tremendously in the storytelling. The performances by the rest of the cast are right on the mark especially Robert Powell and Jane Lapotaire as the tragic lovers. I relish this movie because it unfolds like a stately 19th century British novel. Think of it as a horror movie for the DOWNTON ABBEY set. Slow moving and cerebral, it demands a lot from the viewer but those willing to put forth the effort will find THE ASPHYX richly rewarding.

I wouldn't exactly classify it as horror or science fiction, it belongs somewhere in the middle.  The story is an advisory of sorts, don't muck about with powers you know nothing about.  Unfortunately, when tempted, man will investigate, experiment, and seek to do things he shouldn't.  The boob in question, scientist Sir Hugo Cunningham (Robert Stephens), is utterly fascinated with parapsychology.  He has a morbid preoccupation with dying and the notion of capturing a photo of the soul as it leaves the body.  Using the `smudges' evidenced on only 3 photos, Sir Hugo announces this as conclusive verification, his theory is sound.............but he needs further proof to satisfy family and colleagues.  ""It's all right.  I won't resort to murder.""  He does, however, show up at a local hanging, photo equipment in hand, to gain additional confirmation.  From that point on, a new plan surfaces.  He wants to capture his asphyx and thus achieve immortality.  Things don't run as smoothly as planned.  The results are ironic and terribly sad.

Beautifully photographed by Oscar winning cinematographer Freddie Young, this movie is a stuffy but absorbing period piece.  People take time for tea before experiments.  They chat.  There is no monster (per se) but the asphyx does shriek in an unnerving fashion.  There are a couple of (tasteful) shocks.  I watched the extended US cut.

One of my all time favorite, non Hammer, gothic horror movies. The UK cut is beautiful. However, not so much in the expanded version. The history of the 2 cuts is a little muddy, but it seems some scenes were cut for the UK version due to censorship laws at the time. The full version was released in the US, so calling it the extended cut is a misnomer.

There is a disclaimer on the long cut that states they ""inserted"" the added scenes from the US source which is a lower quality. That's an understatement! The transition is so jarring it can take you right out of the movie. I'm not talking about a minor shift, it looks like it was from an old tape and is windowboxed. In most instances it's in the middle of a scene.

I still have my All Day version and it is the long cut. It is very typical of the early DVDs in that is not remastered in Hi-Def and is letterboxed. Even so the quality is the same thoughout and looks far better than what was used for this version. I wish Kino had tried that source instead.

I've not seen the Hen's Tooth or region 2's but it leaves me wanting. Please comment if you have because there has got to be something better than this.

Honestly, this is a niche movie that very few would have seen on it initial release. I remember seeing the ad one week and gone the next. I doubt anyone was petitioning for it, so Kino has dropped the ball in a big way. They should have taken the time and found a much better print.

The Asphyx is a ridiculous, and yet strangely watchable, film from Hammer wannabes Glendale Pictures; this would be the second, and last, Glendale production (1971's unintentionally hysterical Crucible of Terror was the first). Robert Stephens (Zefferelli's Romeo and Juliet) and Robert Powell (The Italian Job) slum it as a scientist obsessed with capturing the soul (which he calls the asphyx) in an odd machine that looks like an old movie projector and one of his sons. (He has another son, played by TV character actor Clive Arliss, and a daughter, One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing's Jane Lapotaire, but they're set decoration mostly.) Basically, the plot involves Sir Hugo (Stephens) catching the asphyx, and trying to convince Giles (Powell) that (a) his research is valid and (b) Giles should carry it on.

In addition, Redemption offers theirs in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) while All Day's is letterboxed.  However, it isn't a slam dunk for Redemption because the print they've chosen to present is the truncated U.K. edit (86 mins.) as opposed to All Day's, which gives us the film intact, honoring its extended U.S. theatrical running time of 99 minutes (effectively enhancing character background and providing a steadier, more convincing dramatic framework for Sir Hugo's descent into madness).  Redemption does include the extra 13 minutes, but as a separate feature in unremastered form-- a decidely less immersive experience.  For fans, a tough call (I opted for both).  Movie rates 3 1/2 stars; distributors' efforts combined, 4.",1361145600,7,1137,5.5813953488372094
1032022,5,6305470146,"This relatively unknown film is superb, and is a must-see for anyone who enjoys an interesting and original premise, solid acting and a satisfying viewing experience.

The story is set in 1870 London, where a physician accidently captures a photograph of some type of entity entering a person upon their death.  He concludes that if this entity (known as an `Asphyx') can be captured before it enters the dying person, immortality will result.  He pursues this idea, with unintended consequences.

Everything about this film is top flight.  Excellent cinematography, spot on costumes and period sets, very solid acting and an intriguing storyline characterize this highly entertaining film.  Those who have sufficient depth to appreciate well-crafted and thoughtful sci-fi/horror films will enjoy this movie; especially those who like the early Hammer films and other `thinking person's"" British sci-fi films.

It's a shame that two non-reviews sullied the film by giving it one star, when neither non-reviewer actually watched it.  Ignore them and treat yourself to a really well done film. And if you do watch it, pay particular attention to the first few minutes; it seems to have nothing to do with the film, until the shocking ending.  Highly recommended.",1359763200,16,1260,5.291457286432161
1032023,4,6305470146,"This is a very entertaining film and one of the last of the great horror films with a real story rather than simply being explicit.  It was released the same year as The Exorcist, and so it did not get the wide recognition it deserved.  After The Exorcist, we had the gore and effects, and less of the story-themed horror films.

This film captures the mood of the Victorian interest in psychic research.  It was a blend of scientific exploration and interest in the mystic forces of nature.  Robert Stephens is the lead and gives an excellent performance as Sir Hugo.  Sir Hugo is on a quest for immortality.  He becomes obsessed with his mission and pays higher and higher prices for his fixation.  This was very entertaining, and has the British sensibilities of filmaking, which includes a great story and acting, unusual in a horror film.",1350864000,,843,4.687074829931973

As soon as I saw the beginning I knew right away. Altho I have not seen this since...well, forever, I can't remember the details except for this man trying to capture, in essence, his spirit or soul right at death to avoid death (after capturing others & seeing what happened). Oh the lust for immortality corrupts the best of intentions (altho as a believer in Jesus I know where the true source of immortality lies, albeit I will not purport to have attained, but as Paul said, 'this one thing I do, putting the past behind, & pressing on to the high call of God in Christ Jesus). Having diverted a bit (forgive my ADHD), I remember that this was unique in a number of senses. And of course, I don't want to spoil it by saying to much, as it would be easy to figure out with one statement. And now I must go re-watch this little gem, as it has been a good 20+ years, since I last saw this. I think, for it's time, it was, in a sense, ahead of it's time.

1032070,1,6305470146,"When reading the release information for this movie, it is listed as being a 2012 (April 17th) release, but the movie was actually made in 1972. By looking at the image, you would think that the movie has some decent special effects (further contributing to the concept that the movie is a recent release) but it is actually a streaming release from a 16mm film.

At first, it looked like a ""retro"" film, but within a few seconds, you can tell that it's actually not ""retro,"" nor ""steampunk,"" but, rather ""of the age"" of 1972.

In all honesty, after the opening copyright in the credits, I stopped watching, so I can't tell you if the storyline itself is any good. Just don't buy or rent this title with the expectations that the film is a recent sci-fi/horror release.",1335052800,4,769,4.565217391304348

1032072,1,6305470146,"I imagine that this was a box office flop because of the word of mouth by those who saw it. Do you enjoy the fake, haughty, Victorian style dialogue and acting style that dominates the worst melodramas?  I don't.  That's how the characters talk in this film.  Also, absolutely nothing happens in this film that isn't predicted by the ""thinking"" man.  So, no, this is not a ""thinking man's horror""--it's a predictable, mind-numbing horror.  Third, to compare this to Hammer is an insult to Hammer Films and its fans.  Hammer was never so dull, and always had better dialogue and plot points and story and actors and music and horror.  On top of that, the chills aren't subtle in this film--chills are non-existent, and the so-called scare factor is extremely dated and ineffective.
The film may rely more on story than shocks, but if the story is boring and predictable, what's the point?
On top of all of this, the DVD is non-anamorphic.  The plus side is that even though it was filmed in 2.35:1, you can still zoom in on the picture without cutting off the sides of the picture.",1310169600,4,1080,4.617801047120419

1032074,5,6305470146,"I was first turned onto this movie by Elvira, back in the 80's.  Being half asleep at the time added a surreal element to the show (""What? Who's the lady with the big hair?  Oh wait that's Elvira she doesn't get decapitated zzzz..."").  For many years I could not remember the name of the movie, & when I finally did remember I was hesitant to buy it - what if it's not as spooky/creepy as I (sleepily) remembered it?  Only one way to find out!  Luckily, I still enjoyed it, in particular the metaphor of the immortal guinea pig, ironically causing the death of the very human guinea pig who saved its' life, by doing what comes natural: Chewing on that from which it hopes to gain sustenance - a water line. Water itself was a recurring metaphor: The initial drownings, the water from the eternal drip provided by the stream above, & of course the aforementioned waterline needed to keep the containment light active, thus (like the hapless main character himself) keeping the Asphyx near-perpetually imprisoned in a decaying body, praying for release and joyful reunification.  Perhaps the final scene should have been at the ocean side or a lake park, in lieu of a common traffic accident!  Ah well, I ramble... On the whole, if you like horror movies and you missed this one, either because ""The Exorcist"" bumped it out of the theaters prematurely, or because you never watched Elvira, then consider at least renting ""The Asphyx"".",1276732800,,1433,4.708

This movie is very unusual and is well worth watching. I would highly recommend it to people who enjoy Hammer or similar movies. Please see other reviews for a full plot out line.
The main point of this review is to report on the quality of the new DVD edition. It has both bad and good points.
Bad point:
1. No extra's apart from chapter selection.
2. The picture is not restored and has a number of blemishes.
Good Points:
1. This is the full length 99 minute uncut version of the film.
2. The video has an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 which means that you actually get the full picture on this edition.
3. Although the picture is not restored it is not that bad and is quite watchable.
Overall I recommend this DVD. It is much better then previous editions and I highly recommend it.",1267142400,18,835,4.32484076433121

pause for thought.

Of what USE would physical immortality be?
