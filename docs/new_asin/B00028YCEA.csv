Two out of three ain't bad, and that is the final tally on this trio of episodes from ""The Lucy Show,"" the second situation comedy starring Lucille Ball, which ran on CBS from 1962 to 1968.  The Jack Benny episode is a certified classic and the John Wayne one is really good, but the monkey once brings down the average.  These are from the second half of the series, when the Lucy Carmichael character moves to Hollywood from Danfield, New York, where she still ends up with Theodore J. Mooney (Gale Gordon) as her boss down at the bank.  At this point Vivian Vance is gone and now Lucy's new best friend is Mary Jane Lewis (Mary Jane Croft):

Episode 138, ""Lucy Gets Jack Benny's Account"" (Written by Milt Josefsberg & Ray Singer, October 16, 1967) is a classic episode of ""The Lucy Show.""  Once again Mr. Cheever (Sid Gould) is pressuring Mr. Mooney to bring in some new accounts to the bank.  So Lucy comes up with the bright idea of getting Jack Benny's account.  But as everybody knows (or should know) Jack Benny is a skinflint of epic proportions who does not trust financial institutions with his money.  So Lucy has to demonstrate the foolproof vault at her bank.  The key here is that Josefsberg wrote for Benny for years as well as Ball, which explains why the script is pitch perfect for both legendary comedians.  This might not be the best episode in the series, but you will not find one any better.

Episode 122, ""Mooney the Monkey"" (a.k.a. ""Lucy and the Monkey,"" Written by Sam Locke & Joel Rapp, December 5, 166) has a simple premise.  Lucy is being overworked to the point of exhaustion and Mary Jane warns her that if she does not find time to relax she is going to start hallucinating.  So when comedian Bob Bailey (Hal March) leaves his trained chimpanzee in Mr. Mooney's office, Lucy just assumes that she is seeing things and that her boss is now a monkey.  This is not a good one, because the central comedic idea has no place to go.  Lucy has to think that not only is she seeing things, but also she is not hearing things (i.e., Mooney talking out the monkey's lips).  You would think there is a great episode to be done with Lucille Ball and a monkey, but this one is not even close to being it.

Episode 120, ""Lucy Meets John Wayne"" (a.k.a. ""Lucy and John Wayne, Written by Bob O'Brien, November 21, 1966) reunites the Redhead and the Duke for the first time since the fifth season of ""I Love Lucy,"" when she stole his cement footprints from in from of Grauman's Chinese Theater (""Lucy Visits Grauman's"") and breaks them into a million pieces and he graciously sends over new footprints time and time again as she keeps breaking them.  Here the set up is much simplier.  Mary Jane is working at a movie studio and invites Lucy to lunch.  After Lucy runs into John Wayne she gets to visit the set where he is filming a barroom brawl and you can guess what happens next.  This one might not be an outright classic, but it is great fun, especially when Wayne has to mix exasperation in with his politeness to Lucy.",1125273600,,3052,4.44165170556553
