8756894,3,B01DUOD3EM,"Ed Phoerum (Jeremy Irons) is a renowned astrophysicist having a six year affair with a student Amy Ryan (Olga Kurylenko) who is also an actress/stunt woman. The opening scene was rather drippy which sets up for the cheesy love scenes that will make it impossible for couples to have normal relationships after watching this film. Knowing he is dying, Ed sets up for text messages, letters, and recorded DVDs to be sent to Amy from beyond the grave. Ed was very astute and knew Amy's schedule and her too.

One of the discussions is String Theory which includes parallel and alternate universes from which we can have some sort on immortality of be able to communicate with each other. Amy realizes Ed lives on his her life as a dead star whose remnant we still see.
This is not a film for everyone and requires a hopeless romantic with a little bit of a geek background. It is way too long at 2 hours as the Ed run around grew tiresome.
