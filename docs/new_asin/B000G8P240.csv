8129500,4,B000G8P240,"Absurdly retitled and stiltedly dubbed into American teenspeak, this is in fact DIE HALBSTARKEN (beatniks, or half-strong), an influential German art film from 1956 directed by Georg Tressler that reanimated the moribund postwar German film industry and helped bring Horst Buchholz, then 23, into Continental angry-young-lad stardom. Horst is seductively introduced in bathing costume, then in leather slacks, and his visual presence and physicality absolutely dominate the screen, with punkish &eacute;lan and (West) Berliner style. He's hoodlum Freddy the charismatic gang leader, dealing in wristwatches, funny money, older Buicks, newer Opels and the dognapped dachshund Bobo. Freddy has a junior-miss gun moll Sissy, perfectly played by Karin Baal (she flips pancakes when not channeling gun-crazy Peggy Cummins) and straightlaced brother Jan (Christian Doermer), who gradually take over the film as Freddy implodes (realistically, through peer--not parental--pressure) in a one-day crime spree. The guy and his divisively conflicted gang waste no time, seizing all of Saturday and the bleak morning after, in an outburst of misdirected energy, anger and anomic confusion over this strange, new and competitively prosperous Germany (the confused reactions of burgher passersby to Buchholz hyperbolically jiving away, in leather no less, are really priceless).

It should be a rock and roll movie--by American standards--but this is delinquent-Berliner cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; staged and stylized, morphing into crime noir (as invented by German directors), and viewers must be content with Karin and Horst bopping away to diluted swing and jazz on their hip malt shop's jukebox. Buchholz was hyped and stereotyped as channeling James Dean or Brando here, but in this dazzling star turn he's more like the young Nicholson directed by Monte Hellman or Roger Corman, and Tressler's nimble direction on authentic Berlin locations reminds me a lot of Don Siegel's ambitious B-films. (The Viennese director also is unashamedly channeling Nicholas Ray and the Billy Wilder of MENSCHEN AM SONNTAG.) All in all it's a surprising, rewarding and successful fusion of acting and directing styles (try to ignore the egregious dubbing), and purists can find the original film HALBSTARKEN in several undubbed, higher-quality but noncompatible, European DVD editions.",1474588800,2,2367,5.801724137931035
8129501,1,B000G8P240,"1957 this movie was made and it should have been un-made in 1958. My confession is I love Horst Buchholz but in this confusing attempt a explaining teen angst in the 50's it just is annoying and dull. Whatever the writers, producers etc. were trying to do they just seemed to oversimplify rebellious teens. Westside story al least made it enjoyable but this is just bad humans being bad for the sake of it and I don't see this as any type of realism. The ""English"" is messed up, I'm not sure if it was dubbed and I cared not at all for anyone in this film. Skip this, please and watch ""rebel without a cause"" instead.",1408233600,,617,4.282051282051282
