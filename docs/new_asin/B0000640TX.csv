I needed it in a hurry and paid for an upgrade in shipping...and I'm sorry that I did!",1148774400,3,251,4.413043478260869
7960268,5,B0000640TX,"I had ordered this DVD along with one other (Predators III: The Killing Game). That one was a disaster (see my review on it). So it was with trepidation that we put on this one.

It is definitely well-shot. The photography is excellent, as is the narration and pace. There are a lot of close-ups, and nice action photography (including a chilling, up-close depiction of a buffalo calf being chased, brought down, dragged and then suffocated to death by a pride of lions).

There are two distinct short movies on this DVD, one dealing with elephants, the other with lions. Both cover information systematically about their habitat, their diet, their family and living habits, and their friends and foes.

I would probably have given the movie 4.5 stars, but Amazon does not have fractional ratings, hence I rounded the rating up to 5. Definitely recommended for people who like to watch wildlife movies.",1116460800,14,902,4.882352941176471
7960269,4,B0000640TX,"This movie is good one on Lions and Elephants. Tells about their origins, types, family, eating habits, mating habits, friends and foes and their habitats. Though so many movies have already been made about Lions and elphants, still this one is good and informative and worth the money.",1111795200,13,286,4.979166666666667
