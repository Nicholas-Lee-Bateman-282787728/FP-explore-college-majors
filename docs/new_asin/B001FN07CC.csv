8467623,2,B001FN07CC,"Don't let the 'B.B. King"" plastered all over this fool you. In this entire film, B.B. performs 3 songs. This is a film about the producers trying to do a show at Sing Sing Prison. Although not the greatest, it still held my attention. If you're a B.B. fan, save your money and watch the clips on Youtube. They're all there. Otherwise, this is pretty much your standard early seventies documentary/concert film with Joan Baez getting most of the screen time.",1295740800,10,457,4.654320987654321
