8165470,2,B000LZKTVY,"I purchased this DVD, my first Nollywood one, as it was highly rated. The cover describes it as a ""first-rate comedy"", but there was precious little comedy in evidence! Nkem Owah may be well-known (I don't have sufficient experience of Nollywood to say) but Mara Derwent gives a rather wooden performance, and the British cast definetly do not rate the accolade ""a brilliant British cast""!
I was disappointed, but may buy another Nollywood movie before reaching any conclusion about this genre.",1318032000,,494,5.111111111111111
