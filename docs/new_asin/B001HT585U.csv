8309539,5,B001HT585U,"When watching ""Monsieur Verdoux"", you will need to leave The Tramp behind and watch the movie with a clean slate. This is a dark comedy based on an idea that Orson Welles had suggested to Charlie Chaplin. If you've ever seen ""Arsenic and Old Lace"", it's a similar type of dark comedy. However, in this movie Henri Verdoux (Charlie Chaplin) lost his job of 30 years as a bank clerk in 1930 when the stock market crashed. Unable to find work and needing to support his wife, who is in a wheelchair, and his young son, he decides to live a life of crime as a bigamist and murderer. He marries widows, convinces them to take all their money out of the bank in fear of another market crash, then he kills them for the money. He is never actually shown killing them, though. It's implied. However, one of his wives is hard to kill, which is where the comedy comes in. She's loud, boisterous, annoying, and proclaims that she is lucky and nothing can affect her. It certainly seems to be the truth as whenever he tries to kill her either someone shows up or it backfires on him. In the meantime, he's also wooing another widow to convince her to marry him; but that doesn't exactly go as planned either. I won't tell you too much more or I'll give away the best parts of the movie. William Frawley, best known as Fred Mertz on ""I Love Lucy"", also makes an appearance in this film. This is definitely a very entertaining and underrated film that deserves more recognition.",1525046400,,1464,4.425925925925926
8309540,3,B001HT585U,"I have seen quite a few Chaplin movies, and all of them are overrated, including this one.  The attempts at comedy fall flat.  There is a fairly interesting plot about a Bluebeard who, nevertheless, loves animals and his family.  There are a few gems of wisdom in the middle of the movie, but the preachy monologues near the end fail.",1520640000,,334,4.533333333333333
8309541,4,B001HT585U,"Went for the rental, rather than the purchase.  I'd heard good things about this later dark comedy of Chaplin's and had fairly high expectations, which were not quite met.  Chaplin himself, a few years before his exile from the United States, is still very good, with spot on comic timing as a bigamist and serial killer who has his reasons.  And brassy ""big mouth"" Martha Raye almost steals the film in her scenes as one of his wives and intended victims; the scene with Chaplin taking her out in a rowboat is the comic highlight of the film.  There are also some fairly touching scenes with Marilyn Nash as a girl who Monsieur Verdoux helps on a whim, and who later attempts to help him.

Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is fairly weak, with some of the most unconvincing ""French"" people I have ever seen.  And the attempts to tack on a moral seem rather trite, with Verdoux comparing his small scale crimes to the mass killings which he senses are imminent (the action ends in 1937; the film was made in 1947).  There are some gaps in plot logic which I found vexing, although I can't be more specific without spoilers.

It's a mixed bag, with things that make it worth seeing, and others that bring it down.  If I give it four stars rather than three, it's primarily for the performances of Chaplin and Raye.  This was the next to last film in which Chaplin appeared as an actor, and it's interesting to see how his style of comedy translates to the post WWII era.",1464739200,,1472,4.458955223880597
8309542,5,B001HT585U,this man is so funny. he was able to realize his ways at the end and he knew  time was running out for him. he died the way he wanted too. so I could not be sad for him. he enjoyed what he was doing all the way to the end.,1458259200,,222,3.3529411764705883
8309543,5,B001HT585U,"very different Charlie Chaplin. Not sure how I felt about it, but, just the fact that I keep thinking about it from time to time tells me it was worth seeing. Our country was shameful towards Mr. Chaplin. He was a great artist and did not deserve J. Edgar Hoover's immoral attention, but Hoover had some oddities about him that, well, were shameful.",1425081600,,349,4.555555555555555
