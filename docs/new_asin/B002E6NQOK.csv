8366860,4,B002E6NQOK,"I have only been  playing bass for about 10 years. I have Sheehan advanced bass  and IMHO DVD's.  There is a lot of good advice and techniques in both of these videos. I would recommend them both. You're getting a professional's 40 years of playing experience and advice in a DVD for 20 bucks.  One of the main differences between the two DVDs, is he breaks down his bass-lines in some of his most popular songs in the IMHO DVD. What is interesting about both DVDs is you get to see how he approaches playing the bass. It is almost scientific.  He breaks down how to learn and play complicated techniques and riffs easily. He has learned a lot  over the years and passes on  great tips and techniques in these DVDs.  I personally learned a lot from these DVDs.  If you're trying to decide between the two, I would recommend the advanced bass DVD.",1489968000,,846,4.406451612903226
8366861,5,B002E6NQOK,"As a bass player, I've taken interest in many musical styles with the hope of enhancing my own playing. This DVD is a great inspiration. Hearing one of the legendary players discuss everything from playing style to some of the gear he uses is very inspiring. Very cool DVD that shows a master of the bass at his best.",1402876800,2,317,4.389830508474576
8366862,5,B002E6NQOK,I'm now getting around to this DVD. I had to re-buy this video from Billy's web site. The DVD in it's self is a really great DVD. Bill is very talkative and shares lots of information. Richard Glenn,1389744000,,198,4.2368421052631575
8366863,5,B002E6NQOK,"I am sure you have owned many DVDs lesson,
which have a player sitting down ,
playing licks to you one by one, slow and fast.

But this DVD is like an documentary , interview.
Billy talks to you, to share his opinions and thoughts about playing bass , practicing etc.
You wouldn't have any tabs from the DVD
But you will have inspiration in you instrument.

Must buy it even I am a guitar player",1323302400,3,395,4.184210526315789
8366864,5,B002E6NQOK,"WOW! I am a huge Billy Sheehan fan, and consider him to be the most amazing and innovative bassist on the planet in this or any time frame, that being said, this video is a MUST HAVE for any bass player or musician, the topics are very varied but pertinent to being a well rounded player and musician! The DVD is a different from any other ""instructional video"" anyone has ever seen or done before, in as much as it's philosophy and subjective based.  The DVD also contains some INSANE riffs that Billy is kind enough to show the viewers (at slow speed) so you can cop from him and speed it up yourself gradually, these riffs WILL make you a more effective player if you try them, regardless if you use them or not! Bottom Line: GET THIS DVD!",1265760000,5,742,4.3
