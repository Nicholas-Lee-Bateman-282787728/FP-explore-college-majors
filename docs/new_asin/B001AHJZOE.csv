8277441,5,B001AHJZOE,"She was one of the most beautiful women of the 20th century, and for a generation of men, she embodied sexuality. But Marilyn Monroe had a sad side and a troubled past. Did these lead her to commit suicide on August 4, 1962, or was it an accident?  This DVD puts those questions to the test. Using forensics and chemistry, it constructs a timeline of that evening and produces a list of suspects who may have wanted Marilyn dead!",1359590400,,429,4.430379746835443
8277442,2,B001AHJZOE,"This documentary produced by the Discovery Channel purports to reveal the truth about how Hollywood movie actress Marilyn Monroe died.

In a monotonic female voice, the narrator discredits all conspiracy theories, specifically death by injection and death by enema while we see on the screen for much of the program a re-creation of Marilyn Monroe's death, where she is lying in bed on her stomach naked save for a blanket that half covers her.

The narrator assures us Marilyn Monroe committed suicide.  The documentary proceeds to prove the truth of its deduction by re-creating a human stomach by using a flask filled with hydrochloric acid.

A hand drops twenty-five or so capsules of Nembutal into the hydrochloric acid in the flask and then a swizzle stick begins to stir the concoction.  Needless to say, the capsules dissolve completely within twenty minutes, thus explaining why there was no trace of poison found in Marilyn Monroe's stomach at the time of her death.  You see, it wasn't an injection or an enema that killed her.  The poison was completely digested by her stomach in twenty minutes, leaving no trace.

The problem with this analogy between the flask and Marilyn Monroe's stomach is obvious to anyone with half a brain.  The human stomach doesn't have somebody stirring its contents with a swizzle stick to hasten digestion!

I have read elsewhere in ""The Last Days of Marilyn Monroe"" that she had enough poison in her blood to kill ten people.  That much poison would not have been digested before Marilyn died, and traces of it would have appeared in her stomach during the autopsy, had she consumed the poison.  Yet this documentary stands by its pronouncement that Marilyn Monroe committed suicide by deliberately ingesting an overdose of Nembutal and chloral hydrate--and the proof is a swizzle stick in a flask of hydrochloric acid.

In short, balderdash!  This documentary proves nothing about the real cause of Marilyn Monroe's death.

8277443,5,B001AHJZOE,"Finally. I have long been disgusted with all these murder conspiracies about Marilyn that are nothing more than hear say, mystery sources, falsehoods & misinformation. (Trust me, i have read many).
Here experts take a forensic approach to show how Marilyn overdosed on purpose and explain inconsistencies. Even conspiracies get a say but simply fall short. Marilyn murder theories are a virtual cottage industry unto themselves and it is disheartening.
It is very refreshing to hear a voice of reason. Marilyn had well known emotional problems, a family history of mental Illness, a verocious drug habitt and alcohol addiction. Previous suicide attempts and near overdoses are well documented.
It really is a no brainer how she died.",1264118400,,733,5.273504273504273
8277444,2,B001AHJZOE,"I can see things going both ways.  If you are a huge MM fan, maybe you wouldn't want to spend much time thinking about her death.  However, if you are such a fan, it's a fascinating aspect of her and you would want to ponder why she is gone.  This work focuses much more on scientific experiments than factoids about her life, so any one who likes science-laden shows may enjoy this.
Still, some may loathe, just absolutely hate, the straw man style here.  I won't give up the ending, but let's just say all this investigating may have done nothing but killed an hour of time.
There was something a bit boring about this too.  The experiments didn't grab me as ground-breaking.  But when the narrator asks, ""Did someone kill MM through a poisonous enema?"", I did have to chuckle a bit.  So be careful when it comes to other people giving you enemas, y'all!",1216771200,,856,4.448717948717949
