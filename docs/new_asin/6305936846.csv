7897710,5,6305936846,"I found this movie very real in that many see the true ""psychopath"" as the serial killer, and they are. But psychopath's are in every area of our society. The college professor in this movie would not be a common suspect in a series of murders, but he used his job, his position, and manipulated everyone, including the police to get rid of an affair. Psychopaths use and hurt people, they don't have a conscience, they are everywhere.",1299283200,,435,4.589743589743589
7897711,2,6305936846,"i bought this dvd just because it had madchen amick and christ mulkey in it.  they were both great in twin peaks.  this movie is just a bad imitation of every detective movie made, plus silence of the lambs.  madchen acts, dresses and sounds like dana scully from the x-files.  yes, there are some twists and turns, but nothing more than trying to be clever.  the movie is low on action, most of the ""drama"" is in the court room which the scene is drawn out.  the dvd is presented in full screen, with no commentary or bonus materials.  if your a fan of these actors, you'll probably watch it once or twice at most, and then forget about it in your pile of dvds.",1231718400,,662,4.248

7897713,4,6305936846,"Two veterans from TWIN PEAKS star in this uniquely plotted thriller.  Madchen Amick stars as attorney Rachel McGuire, who is tracking a serial killer.  One of the victims was her best friend and roommate.  The killer murders the women (who are all law students) and presents them in the tub with a bouquet of flowers.  We all know the culprit early on---photographer Chris Mulkey.  A subplot involves college chemistry professor Bruce Dinsmore, who is having an affair with his undergraduate assistant.  In presenting his thesis for tenure, he leaves out her participation so she blackmails him.  Lo and behold, this professor is selected for jury duty for Mulkey's trial, and he has an agenda of his own.  He convinces the jurors that Mulkey is innocent, so he can kill his lover and frame him for it.

How Amchik and associates kill two birds with one stone makes for an interesting non-derivative thriller.

Amick and Mulkey do good jobs, but Dinsmore (who looks a lot like a blond Hugh Grant) isn't up to the role.  However, a very different thriller.",1095984000,7,1055,4.837988826815643
