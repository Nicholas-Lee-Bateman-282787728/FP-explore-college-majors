6396777,5,B00JXFHPSS,"I found ""Tracks"" to be a moving and extraordinarily beautiful film - not just in its transporting cinematography and stunning Outback landscapes, but beautiful for its truthfulness, its honesty. ""Tracks"" is both sublimely poetic and ruggedly authentic - it's emotionally raw. There's not one false note in the movie - no melodrama or stereotype characters that you see in most Hollywood films. Mia Wasikowska's performance demonstrates that old line from Keats, ""Beauty is truth, truth beauty"" - it's a great performance, the epitome of soulful. The journey is as much her character's internal coming to terms with herself and the world as it is the external experience, but nothing is spoon-fed to the audience. The film is psychological and spiritual and the landscapes and the actions reflect the central character's shedding of burdens and confronting herself in a naked environment - it's universal, but profoundly personal. One reviewer described it as ""achingly beautiful"", having now seen ""Tracks"", I feel that's an apt description. I think director John Curran and everyone involved in making the film has pulled off an extremely challenging project and have created something of lasting value.",1422921600,19,1203,5.37037037037037
6396778,5,B00JXFHPSS,"This is a  wonderful wonderful movie in many ways. I recommend you see it on the big screen. The cinematography is beautiful. The stark white and yellow hues of the desert sands blowing in the wind puts you in the mood for the story that is going to unfold before your eyes. The loving relationship between Robin and the camels is very moving. Her relationship with her dog will bring tears to your eyes. Mia Wasikowski does and outstanding job of carrying this movie. This movie transports you to the Australian Outback in the 1970's.  I could really feel her pain, the baking heat on her back, and her utter loneliness. I really felt like I was there. The acting ,script, and directing are superb. I saw the movie Wild and in my opinion  this move is in a category above.",1422576000,27,773,4.468085106382978
6396779,4,B00JXFHPSS,"""Tracks"" (2013 release from Australia; running time: more on that later) brings the true story of Robyn Davidson trek across the Australian desert. As the movie opens, we are informed that it is ""Alice Springs, 1975"", when we see Robyn arrive, looking for work and starting preparations to make a 2,000 mile journey by herself from Alice Springs westwards to the Indian ocean. She decides to bring along several camels (to carry all her stuff) and her faithful dog Dig(gity). Robyn eventually takes a job in one of the local camel farms, so as to train on how to deal with camels. Two years later, on April 9, 1977, Robyn sets off on her journey with Dig and 4 camels. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, the movie is essentially a travelogue of the highest quality about life in Western Australia 40 years ago. The photography (by Mandy Walker) is the real star of the movie and in the movie End Titles, it is noted that the photography was ""inspired by Rick Smolan"". Second, Mia Wasikowska brings a tour de force performance as Robyn. She is in virtually every frame of the movie, and for long stretches there is little to no dialogue. So as to ""spice up"" things a bit, there are some trouble spots (for example, on Day 61 she wakes up to fins the camels are missing--now what?) but truth be told, there is little drama or tension. This is NOT a 'survival' movie, but a 'personal reflection' movie. In order to fund part of her trip, Robyn turns to National Geographic (by letter, from Australia, mind you), which eventually gives the green light, on one condition: one of their photographers will stop by on occasion to shoot pictures. That turns out to be Rick Smolan. He is played by Adam Driver in one of his most restrained performances. No antics a la the recent ""This Is Where I Leave You"" or ""What If""... There is a very nice (Windham Hill-reminding) soundtrack, composed by Garth Stevenson. Last but not least, about the movie's running time: several sources (including IMDb and Wikipedia) show it as being 112 min. but the version I saw this weekend was markedly shorter by I'm guessing 15-20 min. Could it be that the US distributor (The Weinstein Company) has cut the running time? It wouldn't be the first time Weinstein has resorted to this, feeling the need to 'dumb down' foreign movies for US audiences (Weinstein did it for Kon-Tiki a few years ago, cutting 30 min. from the original running time for the US release). If that is the case here again, shame on Weinstein!!

A few words about ""Wild"", starring Reese Witherspoon, that OTHER ""woman goes trekking"" movie which came out a few months after ""Tracks"": first of all, it is amazing to me that two such specific yet similarly-themed movies manage to get released within such a short span of each other. I'm afraid that this was to the detriment of ""Tracks"", given the high profile of Wild's lead star. I saw ""Tracks"" before I saw ""Wild"", and I had thought to myself that there was NO WAY that ""Wild"" could be just as good as ""Tracks"". Turns out that in the end ""Wild"" is pretty powerful too, and that BOTH of these movies are very much worth seeing.

""Tracks"" opened without any pre-release hype or advertising at my local art house theater last October here in Cincinnati. I figured this likely would not be playing long so I went to see it right away. The matinee screening where I saw this at was not very well attended, unfortunately. That's a shame, as this is a wonderful movie.  I hope you will consider checking out ""Tracks"", be it in the theater (not likely at this point), on Amazon Instant Video, or on DVD/Bly-ray. I am quite certain that you will not be disappointed. ""Tracks"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1422230400,32,3789,4.608888888888889
6396780,5,B00JXFHPSS,"NOTE:  Despite strong reviews, the Weinstein Company completely fumbled the release of this film in America, scheduling it in a few theatres with almost no advertising.  It deserved a full promotional campaign, but perhaps they needed to be thrifty and bet on other fourth-quarter Oscar contenders, including The Imitation Game, instead.  Anyway -

In the mid-1970s, youthful Australian Robyn Davidson traveled to the town of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory with a dangerous and improbable dream:  to complete an arduous 1,700-mile solo journey on foot from Alice to the Indian Ocean, traversing a vast desert with four camels and her faithful dog.  Many did not expect her to complete or even survive the trip, but she persevered, and a National Geographic cover story and, later, a bestselling memoir elevated her international profile.  Director John Currans vividly realized dramatization of her memoir is my favorite film of the year.  Rapidly rising star Mia Wasikowska, known best for playing such literary characters as Lewis Carrolls Alice (for Tim Burton) and Charlotte Bronts Jane Eyre, delivers a captivating and soulful performance as Davidson, which is important considering the film rests almost entirely on her shoulders.  With absolute authenticity, she conveys the physical and psychological torment endured while traveling in the desert.  In tandem with the screenplay, she also laces her performance with tantalizing, never-didactic hints regarding Davidsons elusive motive for leaving society behind in so dramatic a fashion.  Is it a feminist statement designed to rebel against the constrictive expectations of a masculine society?  Is it an old-fashioned, call-of-the-wild pursuit of adventure?  Is she simply antisocial?  The absence of a simple answer gives the film a mythic dimension.  Not ambiguous in any way, shape, or form are the superior technical attributes, including downright awe-inspiring landscape photography.  The camera alternates between wide-angle shots revealing the frightening insignificance of a single person in so vast an environment and intense closeups depicting day-by-day, step-by-step disorientation, pain, and transcendence.",1421971200,55,2189,5.730650154798762

6396813,5,B00JXFHPSS,"Robin Davidson's journey inspired me to spend four years in Australia as an adventurer back in the 1980s. This movie does an excellent job of telling her story without trying to turn her into a folk hero. While she is, it's not a status she sought. Davidson, now in her sixties, has finally returned to Australia after living abroad many years. This movie allows us some insight into the extreme environment in which this extraordinary young woman found herself in the desert. Long before social media, long before Twitter grandstanding, Davidson just did it because she wanted to. That is part of what makes her story so compelling. She was a true explorer, not seeking glory, just seeking herself in the middle of one of the most inhospitable places on earth. a remarkable story, well told.",1512864000,,792,4.830882352941177

6396821,4,B00JXFHPSS,"Excellent cinematography and a stunning performance. Thing is, in story terms, it's a bit lack luster. There's just not enough conflict and nothing really builds. Not to mention there isn't a clear internal story. I can make a guess that it's about overcoming a feeling of abandonment by becoming self reliant, then capitulating into the middle path (and I'm doing a lot of the heavy lifting in that thesis) -- but it's incredibly slight and not well-drawn. The story doesn't evolve so it feels like it's a bit of a slog. Having said all that, it's somehow still very watchable. What it probably comes down to is Mia Wasikowska.",1501545600,,628,4.770642201834862

Of course, the book is about her personal journey as well.  No need to write a review: plenty out there.

If you're looking for a shoot 'em up, CGI action movie, then this is not for you, but if you prefer something slower paced that'll draw you in and spellbind you for two hours, then this is it. After a number of false starts over the last thirty five years, they finally made this wonderful movie of the incredible story of the lone woman who walked across the Australian outback with her four camels in 1977, which will leave you thinking of her adventures long after the final credits. Australians have a way of making movies so far removed from Hollywood, and this one is exceptional.

One has to find a way to purge the human horribleness from their mind/soul in whatever way they can at times in life. And if walking out in the middle of nowhere for months on end with a bunch of camels is the way you choose to do so then more power to you.

Something about this film has touched me so profoundly that is has the power to turn on the faucets a day later! Right now, I'm hungering to see the movie again. When I was younger, theaters would let people sit through multiple showings of a movie. I did that with only a couple ever. This would have been one of those! There is so much about this that appeals to me and connects with me: the gorgeous cinematography and the immense and stark wilderness of the country itself, the rugged beauty of the characters, the raw naked vulnerability and inner strength of the protagonist, the simple kindness and even innocence of so many of the characters she encounters, and of course those freakin' adorable animals. For me, this film is maybe more similar to *Gravity* than to *Wild,* because so much of the time the actress is the only person in the scene, and in terms of how moved I am by it. I cant attribute the tears to which I'm moved this morning to any specific element of the movie or the story, but don't be surprised if it happens to you!

6396981,4,B00JXFHPSS,"The DVD that I received from Amazon is not the commercial ""pressed"" DVD you normally get when you buy a movie at a retail store. Instead, it is a DVD-R that appears to be the high quality AZO type. This is almost as good as a commercial pressed DVD but without the scratch resistant layer. So treat this DVD as you would any DVD you created at home, and it will last a lot longer than the typical DVD-R DVD.

The DVD is not the theater-released 112 minute version that Amazon advertises, but the 100 minute truncated one. Twelve minutes is a long time to cut from a movie, and I sure would like to see the original theater release, but I haven' found one in the US yet. The 100 minute DVD is probably the 100 minute version Amazon streams for $2.99; so you might want to stream it if you have broadband. If not, the DVD is very nice and the story is fascinating.

I enjoyed this (100 minute) movie very much. The photography is stunning and beautifully shot. Whereas ""Wild"" is Cheryl Strayed's redemption story, ""Tracks"" is more of a rite of passage story and is patiently told as Robyn Davidson learns how to work with camels and survive in the outback. Mia Wasikowska's portrayal of Robyn is a joy to watch, and Robyn's love of animals is emphasized throughout. I would consider giving this movie a 5 star rating except for the false advertising by Amazon concerning the length.",1436745600,3,1380,4.450592885375494

6396992,3,B00JXFHPSS,"I'm a fan of scenic wasteland films like ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Hidalgo"", and ""Eight Below"", I had such high expectations for this movie that were unfortunately disappointed when I was finally able to see it.  ""Tracks"" is beautifully executed in terms of cinematography, casting, and acting, but it's the plot itself that just isn't very interesting -- or perhaps it just isn't unveiled in a very interesting way.  It's supposed to be a kind of ""lost in desolate beauty"" film, but it doesn't manifest that way at all.  It manifests as a bored and pouty older girl who doesn't really know what she wants, but feels the need to go through a perfunctory process of going halfway through Australia with lots of human help and her small caravan of interesting camels along the way.

Because we catch hints that the central character's gripe is with her society, perhaps this might have been better as a critique of Australian cultural life and just wanting to get away from it into the desert, perhaps, but not knowing more preicsely where to go or what to do, to remedy that sense of malaise.  Or was it a film about a girl who just feels insubstantial and trifling, and wants to perhaps make a token gesture of her seriousness as a human being and her toughness?  Beats me.  All I know is that it could've been so much more intelligent and meaningful than it ultimately is.

After seeing both this film and the Reese Witherspoon film ""Wild"", I have to say the latter is a much more purposeful and compelling film because it actually understands what it wants its purpose to be.  ""Tracks"" hasn't really got that one figured out, though Mia Wasikowska is always endearing to watch.",1435104000,3,1676,4.673469387755102

If you've read her book or seen ""Wild"", you'll make yourself disappointed by distracting comparisons and miss the chance to fully make a journey that you would probably never take in actuality or to be charmed by a grumpy camel.",1429401600,,690,4.7899159663865545
6397040,2,B00JXFHPSS,"So disappointed. I finished the book and immediately sought out the movie. I am not sure that the story of Tracks can be translated properly to the screen. But in the end, neither the character of the land through cinematography nor the relationship with the dog, nor the personalities of the camels, none of these were given their due and so none of the story was really told. Read the book or listen to the book but do not expect the movie to be an interpretation of the book.",1429401600,,478,4.382022471910112
6397041,4,B00JXFHPSS,"I purchased the full DVD version from Canada when it became available, as the film itself never was shown in our area.  Frankly, I am more than angry with the Weinstein Company, who own the distribution rights to the film in the USA.  Weinstein could not have more perfectly sabotaged the release of the film.  It only appeared (at most) in 67 theaters in the USA, with very little if no advertising.  And now, another insult, with the DVD being available in the USA as a cheap copy on DVD recordable blanks.  We are talking low-budget here, to the point our local library system cannot order the DVD because it doesn't meet ""standards"".  There is nothing inherently wrong with a DVD-recordable copy, as it retails all the full digital quality, but this El Cheapo promotion of the DVD by Weinstein is a travesty for a film that deserved so much better.  Trust in the reviews by the people who have seen this film!  YOU are the audience, and you will very likely have a memorable viewing experience.  Mia Wasikowska gives a tremendous performance, and the cinematography by Mandy Walker is striking and award-worthy.  Tracks was never allowed to find its audience.

6397073,5,B00JXFHPSS,"This is one of those love it or hate it movies. I loved it. I loved the vast wilderness being something to challenge...something I would NEVER in my life do or want to ever do...but I like watching others take on what I would fear attempting the most...a trek across 1700 miles across the forbidding Australian desert from Alice Springs to the Indian Ocean...

It does seem that the main character, young Robyn Davidson, is a bit than more than a little bit of the type of person who hates being around people in almost any capacity...she's had family heartbreak young (which has hardened her heart and seemed to create a vast wasteland of emotions between herself as a child and herself as a young woman).

There is one scene in the film where Robyn comes across a kind Australian couple out in the desolate nothingness and they are so good to her, when she leaves their home her gratitude for their kind hospitality is evident. As is her appreciation for chatty Eddy, the Aborigine elder who escorts her across sacred territory she is otherwise forbidden to traverse. Her relationship with the National Geographic photographer gets off to a very rough start, but she softens after a while and he ultimately was the salvation of her earthly life.

In the end, when Robyn Davidson reaches her ultimate destination, she does so with the fewest of belongings...after a final purging and unburdening of her excess..and the realization that what she has is really all she really needs.",1426464000,,1481,4.77734375

6397075,5,B00JXFHPSS,I rarely give a 5 and I rarely even post a review so this film is good in my eyes.  It doesn't have a lot of story or big scenes.  It is not embellished with extra drama but just a look at struggle in life and how sometimes that struggle can lead to release and healing.  The main character knew only that she had to do this and she did it.  She was perhaps heroically driven to go beyond the everydayness of life and get lost in an everydayness of total immersion.  The sound track was good as was the cinematography.  The song I noticed most was a haunting echo-piano while the credits were rolling.  I hope to find out the name of it.

6397106,4,B00JXFHPSS,"I love true adventure, and encouraged by ""The King's Speech"" which  impressed me deeply,  I made my choice.  You get a a real
feel of the plodding nature of this trek; as Robyn, the protagonist said, it was as if she just kept moving her feet and the earth turned under her.  Back in the late 70's, Robyn Davidson, a white young woman in Australia, who has always felt happier with animals than with people, tired of her generation's mores, tired and bored with odd jobs and purposelessness, decides to trek across the Australian desert from a midcontinental point about 1600 miles west, to the ocean.  There are thriving populations of feral camels  (!) in the desert, which decides her to learn camel care and training, so she can capture and train her own wild beasts.  This part of the movie is very interesting, educative and inspiring.  She is not afraid of them, works hard to learn , handles them well and respects their limits. One of her mentors gives her a rifle to take, which she refuses at first, but he insists, saying ""When you are out there, and a bull  camel is charging toward you, don't think, just shoot to kill.""  You can see she would rather not, but when the actual incident occurs, your hair stands up and you start to edge back in your chair, feeling the utter malignant intention and discernable power of the three bulls charging her, one of which is in full weight and maturity.  If she didn't have that gun, you just know they would have kicked, tromped, bit and tossed past death her, her dog, and her camels (which had to be hobbled at rest times).  I felt utter relief that she was a good shot, despite no apparent experience.  The travelogue aspect of the film was worthwhile; my idea of inland Australia was very limited; many scenes were beautiful, but many were monotonous and repetitious too.  The latter is not judgemental, just
descriptive.  What bothered me  however, was the irony that though she was not  comfortable or happy around people, she would not have lived through the trip without their help!  She was disdainful and unhappy with the photographer doing his job, but he was
a caring person, and did many things to help, one of the most important of which was planting water containers at intervals through the severely waterless part of the desert.  She thought she could make it through without help, that she would find solutions off the cuff.  I didn't sense or hear gratitude for the help she received, although she was generally accepting and sometimes affectionate.
The other point was that I wanted to believe in her competence, but, it was inconsistent, so I never felt really at ease that she
would make it through.  For about the second half of the movie, her character did not inspire me.  Her courage and doggedness, and determination to WALK herself, leading the camels, instead of riding them is amazing; but the gist of the  movie is the plodding nature of the trek. Often she failed to cover her head or body to protect it from burning.  I needed to see her exercise self care. To not  do that made me think she didn't really value herself.  Nor did I ever see  her looking around,  taken in by the amazing life around her.  In conclusion, the  trip was an
amazing one, but I didn't feel amazement during the watching of it, which took away a large amount  of pleasure and I award 4 stars mostly for the cinematography and geography.",1424390400,,3400,4.598006644518272
