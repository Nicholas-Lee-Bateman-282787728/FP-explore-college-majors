8569661,1,B00BJF54R4,Saw the movie with my girlfriend last week. It was somewhat like home made movie with various casts with no known history. In the middle of the movie I noticed .. story was degrading to immigrants and somewhat directed on the cheap budget with no direction. The Audio was horrible and the volume go up high for no reason several times . I rather spend my 20 dollars on movie ticket for the real movie. I am disappointing to see such low crab movie could still pop up on Amazon.,1374969600,,477,4.311111111111111
8569662,5,B00BJF54R4,"This is a very funny movie that kept me laughing from beginning to end.  My family and I first saw it last Summer at THE NYC INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL and just bought it and saw it again.  Again it kept me laughing until the end and I saw new things I missed the first time.  All of the stars - RAJA FENSKE, FERNANDA ROMERO, DARLENE VAZQUETELLES AND DANNY TREJO are very funny and acted their parts super well.  I will keep this in my library of films and watch it again, especially if I need something to lift my spirits.  I gave it 5 STARS. Thank you, WVERNE",1369958400,,562,4.166666666666667
