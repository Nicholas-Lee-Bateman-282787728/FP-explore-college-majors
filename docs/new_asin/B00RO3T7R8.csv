One review wants to know what has happened that this important film - important even though it is silent - is no longer available.
From what I know in the past, but film was restored to roughly 4 hours - not the original 6 - and music was composed for it by one of the Coppolas.  They financed the restoration.  A major criticism was that the viewing speed was cranked up a little too fast.  Coppola's music was okay if kind of generic.  He made use of several real tunes from that era.  Eventually more film was found and inserted into the film (up to about five hours) and a different orchestral accompaniment was used - Carl Davis, I think.  Coppolas don't want that version issued because that cuts out their score.  The idea of issuing both versions in one box set seems not to have occurred to anyone.  We might consider it wasteful, but no more so than Blu-Ray, DVD, 3-D, and other formats all in one box.  As long as this problem is not solved, I suspect that the film, like the film of Porgy and Bess will remain in limbo.  Our great loss.",1450137600,3,1149,4.229357798165138
