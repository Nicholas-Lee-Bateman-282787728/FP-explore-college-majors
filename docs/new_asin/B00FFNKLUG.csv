8615357,5,B00FFNKLUG,If Bruce Lee had finished Wing Chun most likely he would have fought like this....this is the stuff he didn't finish when he left Wing Chun...get it over Quickly and finish the opponant ASAP ! Not spar the guy dancing around him and kicking low then high or boxing him etc.,1481414400,,273,4.372549019607843
8615358,5,B00FFNKLUG,"If your going to learn Wing Chun from anyone, Grandmaster Swift has to be at the top of your list. I have several of his DVD's and am lucky enough to be one of his students here in the Tampa area. If you can't do it here with him in person the DVDs are the next best thing. The whole series starting from Solid Basics (1 & 2) will get you off the ground really fast if you practice and listen to the details, there is a lot of subtle stuff in there and he calls it out very well. Thank you Sifu for another great DVD, I use them when I travel, yea that is me in the room above you making swishing noises as I practice my shifting and footwork ;-)",1414972800,,646,3.8646616541353382
8615359,5,B00FFNKLUG,"This is all Sifu Steve Lee Swift knows...Great video to start off on if you are interested in learning the solid basics of defense system of martial arts. It does not show the art side of it too much as those are in other DVDs in more advance level. I am a personal practitioner from Sifu Steve Lee Swift and I have done plenty of arts and this one with the Grandmaster has been the only one to be truly full street tactical and practical. (Ive done for a while Judo, Shodokan Aikido, Mixed)

This is worth the buy if you wish to get a good foundation on learning self defense and then advancing more into Wing Chun. No detail's are left out of it either which helps a lot as some just show the move like 2 times then say practice with partner. Sifu has always broken down every combination to understand why you do this and the reason for moving like that. High recommend if you really want to learn from a great Grandmaster of Wing Chun Martial Art.",1386547200,3,951,4.254143646408839
8615360,5,B00FFNKLUG,"This is a great DVD if you're interested in Wing Chun. Sifu Steve Swift demonstrates several ways to protect yourself. You may have seen videos online asking, ""How does Wing Chun deal with jabs, hooks, or MMA ground fighting?""

This DVD is the answer. It deals with the junk someone's likely to throw at you in a club, bar, or anywhere a confrontation might erupt.

The only negative I can think of is that it does require a little knowledge about the art. It's stuff you can figure out online, or pick up the solid basics DVD from grandmasterswingchun.com.",1386201600,3,557,4.616161616161616
