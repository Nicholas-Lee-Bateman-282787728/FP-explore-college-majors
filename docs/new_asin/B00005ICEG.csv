1425983,5,B00005ICEG,"After hearing so many stupid songs and  weird voices and annoying lyrics, Kipper is without a doubt  a breath of fresh air..my daughter begun showing an interest in the video at 18 months (before this wouldn't hold her attention- too complex)...now at 33 mos., she loves him and I love her to love them...the videos are calm, gentle with cute non violent characters..... the story lines can relate to kids....I have the VHS version which is fine....Everytime she asks to see Teletubbies or something equally as anoying, I try to get her to see one of her 3 Kipper videos instead.....Love those sweeet Brit accents too! : ) I also like that the video is long...not like some 20-30 min. deals....",1069286400,,694,4.7272727272727275
1425984,5,B00005ICEG,"What can I say? I a world populated by violence and nasty examples of bad behaviour for kids, Kipper is a breath of fresh air. My 4 year-old adores him and his innocent and friendly adventures. Kipper is a charmer, his little ""dramas"" are simple and easily resolved, an absolute winner. Highly recommended!!!",1061769600,3,308,4.830188679245283
1425985,5,B00005ICEG,"Kipper and his friends Tiger, Pig and Arnold are the main characters in this series of stories.  They have British accents, which is fun, especially when your kids imitate them, and they make playtime into an adventure in every episode.  Some of the words are  slang that kids may not understand at first, but from the excellent illustrations you can understand what they are saying.
This DVD has seven episodes, with story lines so simple that toddlers can understand the ""plot"".  Some of the stories have useful messages, like when Tiger refuses to go into the pool, because he can't swim and doesn't have his swim floats with him.
The backgrounds are for the most part very basic, for example with just a green line on a white background, but somehow you know they are on the grass.  Some are quite complex, and you can see individual blades of grass in a field.  The one story that has a problem is the one when Kipper is blowing bubbles, because you can't see them clearly on the white background, but you can hear them popping. (Thanks to my JBL surround speakers)
I was giving it four stars, because my son has just demanded to see it again for the fourth consecutive time today, and I've had enough, but you can't downgrade something that a child enjoys so much, so it's back to five stars.
I suppose I'll have to buy the rest of the series now.",1058832000,13,1353,4.502040816326531
1425986,5,B00005ICEG,"What a deal!  You get 7 Kipper episodes on this video as opposed to only four on Kipper, Pig's Present and Snowy Day (all great videos worth buying too). I think this Kipper tape is great for exposing children to a broader vocabulary and teaching them how to interact with others.  This video is probably better suited for children that are at least 2 years of age since there is much more dialogue than the first three Kipper tapes (listed above).  Although if you child loves Kipper and is under two, he won't be disappointed.",1011744000,6,528,4.536842105263158
1425987,5,B00005ICEG,"If anything you have read above appeals to you, do not hesitate. Whip out your credit card and buy every Kipper tape you can find! This is one of the few video series that requires no parental policing and can be viewed by all with delight. The stories are gentle and affectionate and are imbued with the warmth of genuine friendship. The animations are simple but charming. The plots revolve around kid-level problems that are solved with a bit of inventiveness, much consideration, and a dash of bemusement. The characters are well acted without the cloying adults-pretending-to-be-children edge that you find in many US videos; BBC regular Martin Clunes, who does the voice of Kipper, is absolutely amazing. The pacing is suited to very young toddlers yet the stories are engrossing enough for school-age kids.",996883200,23,813,5.029629629629629
1425988,5,B00005ICEG,"I think this tape is fantastic. I do not get cable so we can only see these types of shows on video. Kipper is a really cute dog and the 7 stories are fun and grab your attention. My baby is only 9 month's old and can sit through about 10 minutes of Kipper before she gets bored, but I wanted to see the whole show! This tape is 60 minutes long and the color and sound is supurb. I like the animals in it. Kipper and Tiger are dogs and they have pig and other animal friends. I'd say these are the best cartoons out there with stories that are positive and helpful to children. Not like the ones in my day where the animals charaters were all being attacked and bombed, or so it seemed. Kipper has fun playing and being a kid outside mostly. I adore this video and so does my baby.",992217600,12,781,4.012820512820513

Shows like Kipper are such a relief from the constant, non-stop antics of these other shows. Kipper is relaxed and features simple plots and interesting characters who are not always yelling at the screen. My child is always much calmer after watching Kipper than all these other kid shows. It is closer to PBS shows like Caliou and Curious George than the whiz-bang shows on commercial stations. Highly recommended.",1377475200,,523,5.093023255813954

1426218,5,B00005ICEG,"My 2yo loves this show.  Episodes are short enough to keep his attention and long enough to be interesting to adults (like, not 15 sec Baby Einstein skits).  We've spent lots of time watching Thomas, playing with trains, but as he becomes more aware of what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior my wife and I have been looking for Thomas alternatives.  It's not that Thomas isn't fun to watch, but nearly every episode involves a train given instructions, not following them, and then making everything right by doing what they were originally told to do.  Not quite what we want from our boy, so we stumbled on this series.  Kipper and his friends are a nice bunch of chaps- er, dogs- that are very polite to one another and spend most of their time looking for fun non-destructive things to do.  They don't lie to each other, they don't get into train wrecks (""luckily no one was hurt""), and the only slightly negative behavior we've noticed is that they are constantly losing the baby (""Aaaar-noooold!"").  These episodes look like they'll be a very nice transition between Baby Einstein and Sesame Street.  Free with Prime!!  Oh, and the illustration is superb, very 'book-ish', simple but highly representational.",1367625600,,1222,4.893203883495145
1426219,5,B00005ICEG,"Kipper is a bit boring, at first to any parent...we can't figure out how our 2yr old likes it so much - but really, it's just very simple and very sweet, and this episode is perfect for Spring!",1366156800,,193,4.105263157894737

1426221,5,B00005ICEG,"We are serious Kipper fans in our house.  My 2 year old son loves it.  Pools parks and picnics is another fun episode to learn about swimming at the ""big"" pool having fun in the park and having a picnic with friends.  Another winner!",1364601600,,233,4.25
1426232,4,B00005ICEG,"Kipper is about as innocent and unobjectionable as they come. My 3 year old son loves Kipper and I like that I don't have to worry about him seeing something that I don't approve of. Some may find it boring, especially if they prefer more of an edgy/modern kids show. But it really is just a cute, sweet, innocent preschool aged kids show.",1364515200,,339,4.396825396825397
1426233,5,B00005ICEG,"My first exposure to Kipper! These little dogs (and pig) have gentle, soft, voices with pleasant British accents and nice little adventures.  Even when one does something wrong or foolish, he is met with understanding and patience from the others. The animation is simple and cute. Everything about Kipper is sweet and pleasant.",1363478400,2,328,5.188679245283019

1426238,5,B00005ICEG,"Kipper episodes are just the right length, clear realistically drawn characters. Despite the talking dogs and pigs it's not cheeky, obnoxious, boisterous like the usual saturday cartoons.  Good simple moral messages appropriate for the the pre-school age.  Pace and speech is clear enough that even my 1year old grandson can enjoy and pick out familiar objects and actions.  a delight to watch",1334880000,,393,5.306451612903226

1426253,5,B00005ICEG,"We LOVE Kipper.  We had a couple of videos when my daughter was a toddler and when we pulled them out for our son, he fell in love.  Even adults can watch these videos over and over.  (Unlike most Pre-K videos)  The music is a wonderful, jazzy, soundtrack.  I find myself singing ""Kipper the dog..."" at work.  We have Kipper books too.  I would highly recommend ANYTHING Kipper.",1169510400,,378,4.470588235294118
1426254,5,B00005ICEG,My four year old granddaughter loves the Kipper DVD's.  She watches them over and over and just loves the characters and the situations they find themselves in.  Kipper is gentle fun that teaches life lessons with subtlety and grace and without being treacly.  I cannot recommend them more highly than that.  What fun!!!!,1167782400,,321,5.0

1426256,5,B00005ICEG,"Kipper has been beloved in our house since my son was born 6 1/2 years ago.  Since each episode is only a few minutes long, we watch one episode (or two) just before bedtime.  Since Kipper has such simple animation, it is easy on the eyes as well as the spirit.  I can't say enough about what Kipper has meant to our family. Buy just one and you will be hooked.  These videos will go in the hope chest for our grandchildren!",1140652800,3,424,4.134146341463414
1426257,5,B00005ICEG,"I can't say enough good things about this thoroughly charming and thoroughly British series. Since discovering Kipper, my 2-year-old son asks him on a daily basis, and the quiet, gentle stories are a nice change from the constant action and noise from other children's series. I also love the jazzy Kipper theme song. Kipper is a wonderful choice for toddlers, and parents will appreciate this adorable DVD as well.",1130284800,2,415,5.028985507246377
1426258,5,B00005ICEG,"I can't say enough about the Kipper series for little ones.  We've bought all they offer in either DVD or VHS.  I am actually rebuying this particular Kipper on DVD to replace our worn out VHS version.  That is how much use we've gotten out of this.  I discovered Kipper when my daugher was 15 months old.  She truly liked it, but I loved it.  I loved the simplicity, sweetness, and touches of British humor.  Well, she may have just liked it then, but now, at age 3 1/2, she absolutely LOVES Kipper.  This and Caullio are her two favorite shows (Maggie and the Ferocious Beast is a great one too that she loves).  They have plots she can follow and keep up with and recognize the humor.  It's a nice paced show-- sweet but not boring-slow at all, and not obnoxious and fast like some cartoons out there.  Sure, my daughter now is allowed to watch a few cartoon movies that have the songs and some action, and she'll ask to watch them everyday for 3 days, but then they are forgotten and it's Kipper she begs to watch over and over and over.  And I never mind.  It's such a great show-- you won't regret buying it for your little ones (and buy the DVD that will last you longer so you're not rebuying like I have to!).

Enjoy!",1128556800,2,1226,4.251082251082251
1426259,5,B00005ICEG,"My daughter has loved Kipper since she was about 10 months old.  We were shocked, when at 10 months she actually sat through three episodes of Kipper.  We don't encourage a lot of TV viewing, but Kipper is always welcome in our house.  It is a nice change from all the other nonsense out there.
Its stories and characters are refreshing in today's fast-paced world.  It has a simple animation that will be a relief from all the flashy, fast-paced cartoons.  We think this lack of complexity is what first caught our daughter's attention.  It isn't violent, it isn't demeaning, and it is worth every cent.  I never get tired of watching it with my daughter and how many children's shows can you say that about.  At 15 months, she still loves it.  We own four of the Kipper DVD's now and love every one of them, but Pools, Parks, and Picnics is one of my personal favorites.",1082851200,7,872,4.468354430379747
