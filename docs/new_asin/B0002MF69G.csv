It is one of those never seen it before, might not see it again type of movies.  I will only say that the director or editor should have ended the film with the man's soliliquy (it would have been amazingly crushing) as the final two short scenes are anti-climactic.",1363910400,2,378,4.309859154929577
2104238,1,B0002MF69G,"I was misled! I'd ordered this on the basis of some reviews elsewhere saying that this was an underappreciated little indie gem. It's not. It's dreadful. If this was someone's film school project, I'd be kinder, but, this is just arrested adolescent male fantasy nonsense, executed with little if any care or skill. It takes a lot for me to say this, but- avoid this one.",1267488000,2,371,4.636363636363637
2104239,4,B0002MF69G,"Cool and surprising, UK movie.

The lead actress is attractive and perfoms very well as the submissive (at first)Vampire, who's blood is used as a drug, and sold to a select few.

But when the drug pusher starts falling in love with her, the supply runs low-

if you like intelligent vampire movies- then this is for you.

well worth it.

What other movies is this vamp babe been in??",1127433600,4,384,4.428571428571429
8029211,5,B0002MF69G,Super awesome!! I had forgotten about that Erasure song! Can't believe that was 2000! Anyway loved the movie. Was a different type of love story for sure. If you want to call it that. I love different and this has it. Watch it!,1494979200,,227,4.3023255813953485
8029212,5,B0002MF69G,"This was cool in its own way. I saw it many times at the video store but skipped picking it up to rent.
I enjoy its view on vampirism and addiction.",1477612800,,148,3.806451612903226

8029214,4,B0002MF69G,"I watched this just because the cover looked interesting, and I found it to be surprisingly good.  It's low budget, but addressed a fresh scenario I hadn't seen before and was well put together.  It made me think a lot about how we do the same thing in society.  I really enjoyed it but watched it with no prior expectations.",1425081600,,325,4.383333333333334

8029217,5,B0002MF69G,"BLOOD begins w/ a group of unlikeable people who have a woman strapped to a chair. She's got a muzzle on her face as well. These unlikable people take blood from the woman and drink it. They also sell it for stacks of money. A pair of men show up to rescue her. That's when we learn she must drink blood to survive. Her name is Lix (Lee Blakemore), and her blood is very special. Once she's gone, we see that her former abductors are addicted to her blood, and are going through serious withdrawal. Lix slowly adjusts to her new, more ""normal"" surroundings in her rescuers' home. One of them gets a taste of Lix's blood and becomes dependent. It is eventually disclosed that Lix is the result of a secret experiment, and she's far more dangerous than anyone suspects. BLOOD is a british horror film that reminded me of early Cronenberg. It's strange, eerie, and disturbing in a cold, clinical way. Recommended for those looking for a radically different take on the vampire story w/ an addiction sub-text...",1396915200,5,1007,4.6
8029218,3,B0002MF69G,"Dr. Carl Dyson (Adrian Rawlins aka James Potter) keep Lix (Lee Blakemore) locked up until she was 20. In his experiment he has created an addictive blood that now has a cult following. The blood gives people a feeling of euphoria where they only see good in everything and then has a crash where everyone looks evil. Lix goes from being a created captive to having free run of the house. Under the circumstances she is remarkably normal, educated, and well adjusted.

The film is interesting as you keep wondering where it is going to lead, but is slow developing. This is a well acted, low action drama. It is not a vampire horror film. To complicate matters Carl has a jealous wife (Elizabeth Marmur) and a curious 10 year old son (Nicolas Harvey).

Available for uncensored free watching at Viewstar...plus commercials.
