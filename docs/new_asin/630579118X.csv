All other releases so far have totally different voices, music, and theme songs. I am very, very happy with these VHS & DVD releases - they are just as I remember them.",1187568000,,698,4.67479674796748

When my son was about six years old I told him about the cartoons that I grew up with and how different they were from the cartoons today, he said he would like see it, but since I couldn't find it back then, I told him If I ever found it I would get it and watch it with him. It took some time but, I found it and my son is now 22 years old and he watched Kimba with me and he was suprisied how good it was. I'm always telling my friends about Kimba,Asto Boy, and Gigantor,the cartoons I watched when I was a kid ,they think I'm still just a big kid and maybe I am, but thats just the way I am. I have two step grandchildren and I'm going to show them (ages:5&10) and I hope they enjoy it as much as I did.
I just wish that they would sell them in a larger boxed set. If any one hasn't seen the Kimba videos I would highly recommend that they see them.",1023753600,7,1247,3.763358778625954
