8729893,4,B0146626ZU,"The series is great. I wouldn't have bought this ten years after I saw it if I didn't think so. However, as for this specific packaging ... less so. I'm unsure if it's just the seller I got in from in particular, but despite being ostensibly new and sealed when it arrived, the cases inside the box were fairly dinged up. Scratches on the DVD case, weird water damage(?) on the paper insert of the Blu-Ray case that left it wrinkled ... but it does the job I wanted it to, and it's still cheaper than buying every DVD individually (though you can always opt to go all-digital).

Fair warning, HD or not, it really doesn't seem like the resolution is great. The clips Funimation has put up on YouTube seem nice and crisp, but at times it can feel like you're watching something from the 80s. This series has always been all over in terms of animation quality, though, so it's easily ignored if you focus on the story.",1483401600,,916,4.3882352941176475

8729895,4,B0146626ZU,"I love this show and wanted it on Blu Ray. But, it's not really 1080p HD, so that was a bit disappointing. Though, this is a 2005 anime. Anime quality went from 4:3 480p TV quality to 16:9 720p HD quality between 2005 to 2008. So, 720p is considered HD and was the best quality when Noein came out. Anime quality went up again to 1080p around 2011 to 2013. (Search for format change info on your favorite long running anime, ex: Naruto, One Piece, Bleach). That's kind of lame since people by today's standards are expecting Blu Ray titles to be released in 1080p HD, but I think this is the best Noein gets without some other kind of remastering. Would that ever happen for a title like this one? ...",1458000000,5,701,4.318181818181818
8729896,3,B0146626ZU,"First I'm Japanese and I watch all anime in original Japanese language... But this is not great! I think this is 1080i and HD picture quality is terrible! Really blur, too bright and not really sharp. I thought I'm watching DVD?! 5.1 Surround Sound is good. and English subtitles never disappear when I watch it in Japanese... Disappointed! But Japanese Blu-ray box cost is $300!!! So I'm so glad I got US version... But still expensive... Bonus featire's On Location in Hakodate Japan was great. I live in NY now and I miss Japan... If you own DVD box, you don't need to buy Blu-ray box...",1455321600,5,590,4.5754716981132075
8729897,5,B0146626ZU,"Noein yes made me get back into anime. It,Claymore,and Outlaw Star all had a role to play in getting me back into anime. This Limited edtion set is one of Funimation's best LE's so far. The case looks amazing and the art cards it comes with are really artsy also filled with many of my favorite characters:) The clipboard case looks Fantastic as well. This series will grow on you episode by episode like Stiens Gate. You might be surprised how mature these midschool characters are in the decisions and little choices they make. I just fell in love with the Story/characters and Parallel Deminsion all woven together so well. I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I have.^_^ This series was so worth saving thanks to Funimation so props to them for once.",1454025600,7,753,4.544117647058823
8729898,5,B0146626ZU,"This was the anime that made me an anime fan. Beautiful animation, interesting story, endearing characters and just enough episodes to not become irritating made this perhaps my all time favorite of the genre. Everything I hoped for in this series ACTUALLY HAPPENED! Didn't like an obnoxious antagonist? Got to watch him get brutally beaten. Wondered why certain character arcs seemed to be going nowhere? Those characters got their moment well before the final episode. I've seen many (too many) anime since this one hooked me, but none have ever captured the wonder this series brought.",1453248000,4,588,5.135416666666667
