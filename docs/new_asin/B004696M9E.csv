8417108,5,B004696M9E,"I've watched several of the past year's F1 reviews.  I've rented many plus I own 4 of them, and IMHO this is by far one of the best.  The only two things that would have made it better, again just my opinion, would be if they'd get the USA's TV commentators to narrate it (David Hobbs, Steve Matchett, Will Buxton, etc.) and produce a Blu-ray version.  Otherwise, it was fantastic!",1388707200,,381,4.414285714285715
8417109,5,B004696M9E,"I always liked Red Bull Racing even before they became Red Bull, I also thought that Sebastien Vettel was an up and coming star, boy was he, loved the 2010 season of Formula one and was happy that the season went down to the wire, was upset that Ferrari and Alonso did not win the Championship but thought to myself, ""Oh well, there is always next year"" boy what a wrong thing to think.  Even thou Vettel had his moments of being great, he also had those moments of being an inexperienced dumb snotty child.  Still, great season right to the last race.  I have ordered these review DVDs and love them, I get to go through each race and remember what had happened.  This DVD was packaged well, shipped and received on the day it said it was going to be delivered.  Also, the price on this DVD was one you could not beat and this seller is top notch, that is probably why I keep buying these DVDs from them.",1348704000,,905,4.238372093023256
8417110,5,B004696M9E,"I was surprised on how well this was done. Better then ""official"" reviews use to be. All the races are covered, try watching without commentary, just enjoy the engine noises. If you're into F1, buy this.",1307404800,,203,4.666666666666667
8417111,4,B004696M9E,"The video quality is acceptable.  The races are edited which suits my purpose.
My wife and I watch the past races a few days before the current race.",1305590400,,149,4.321428571428571
8417112,5,B004696M9E,Very good review of the F1 highlights presented through brillant photography and quite professional narration. A most enjoyable program that should appeal to even those who are not car or race fans.,1295827200,5,198,5.21875
