8216558,5,B000V5MM3W,"These videos provide articulate instructions on how to create a wide variety of furniture pieces that range from the fun and funky to the elegant. David Sorg's clear presentation style at just the right pace inspired me to try my hand at finishing a hideously ugly table (that I got for free) that now sits as a centerpiece in my office. I think you will enjoy watching Sorg's projects progress from start to finish, and since he explains the ""why"" of each step, you will also be able to apply that insight to your own projects.  Use your imagination and have fun!",1259193600,,564,4.529411764705882
8216559,5,B000V5MM3W,I loved this DVD. It inspired me to try my hand at fixing up some garage sale furniture I had purchased. Now I get compliments on my desk all the time. David has a great flair for explaining and demonstrating his techniques. I highly recommend his tapes/DVDs!,1257465600,,259,4.531914893617022
