8167382,4,B000M9BT9K,"Have a copy of this DVD, and must admit it is a very nice, all-inclusive guide to Afro-cuban drumset.  There are many styles demonstrated, and is very easy to navigate.  All skill levels, especially those in the least ""black belt"".  Well done.",1223337600,,243,4.738095238095238
8167383,5,B000M9BT9K,"This DVD is superb. Curt Moore has put together a great instryctional DVD on Latin grooves for the drum set. The concepts of 'Latin' and 'Jazz' feet are great and show when to or not to play the kick drum. The audio and video quality is outstanding and Curt demonstrates all the grooves and provides their notation.  If you want to know how to play the drum set in a Latin setting with a conguero, bongocero and timbalero or any combination of them then you need this DVD. Also, provided are drum loops to play along with that are very helpful. Thanks Curt for a great product.",1186617600,,577,4.392523364485982
8167384,5,B000M9BT9K,"Great instruction from a master percussionist!  If you are an intermediate to advanced drummer, you will find very useful latin grooves depicted in easy to read format.",1178496000,,168,5.222222222222222
8167385,5,B000M9BT9K,"This DVD is an excellent introduction for using Afro-Cuban rhythms on the drumset.  It covers the basics of clave and goes on to detail four popular rhythms:  Cha Cha, Mambo Son, Bolero, and Nanigo (Afro-Cuban 6/8).  Everything is laid out in easy-to-access chapters with on-screen notation, and you can jump around the various sections as you wish.  Also, each chapter kicks-off with a performance by Moore's band (Soul Sauce), so you can hear how the rhythm sounds in an ensemble context.

I also like how the concept of  ""Latin feet"" (traditional approach) and ""jazz feet"" (nontraditional approach) for the bass drum and hi-hat is explored. It's good practical advice for the gigging drummer, and for students.  I'm a Macbook user, but I had no problems accessing the practice loops and rhythm notation PDFs found in the Extras folder. If you've got Garageband, or Acid, you're set to go.",1176940800,3,891,4.97972972972973
8167386,5,B000M9BT9K,"Curt Moore has done an outstanding job with this instructional DVD. He provides very clear and usable information for the drumset drummer wanting to move into Latin music.

The audio and video work is top knotch.  His band, Soul Sauce, is tight and musical.  And the supplimental information provided with the DVD (Gargage Band/Acid loops, pdfs and on-screen notation) is a wonderful bonus.

""Afro-Cuban Drumset"" really lives up to its title and delivers ""Grooves You Can Use.""
