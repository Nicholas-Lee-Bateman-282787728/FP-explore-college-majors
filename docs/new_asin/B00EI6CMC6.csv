8605615,4,B00EI6CMC6,"be aware, although the product label states that dts master audio 5.1 is an option it is actually dts m/a 5.0 only.  this is not a major problem with me because the sound is still great with a good performance hall quality.  the performances are excellent and stirring, however, the quick pans and jump cuts of the musicians can be distracting.  I bought this to listen to the music in a high resoluton format and it delivers.  it would have received 5 stars if the product labeling were correct and the visual editing less distracting.",1394582400,,536,4.610526315789474
8605616,5,B00EI6CMC6,"I really like the blu ray classical concert videos when they are well done like this one.  The surround audio can be high resolution along with the video.  I have a huge collection of SACD's but I now think this is the best way to experience classical music - next to going to the live concert hall, of course.  The conductor, like all good conductors, grows on you and becomes a pleasure to watch and the Danish symphony musicians are superb.  Also the capacity of blu ray disks allows us to get 4 complete symphonies on one disk!  Highly recommended.",1386979200,,552,4.48
8605617,5,B00EI6CMC6,The Dvorak is worth the price of the disc itself but all recordings are awesome with great video and audio.  I am not a classical expert but do know what I like when I see it and I cannot imagine better DVD versions of these symphonies for any price.  Trust me and if you have any interest in these symphonies buy this disc.,1383091200,,324,4.126984126984127
8605618,4,B00EI6CMC6,"The Danish National Symphony Orchestra performs four symphonies on this Blu-ray disc. Brahms' First and Dvorak's Ninth are two of the best known symphonies in the classical repertoire, while Sibelius' Fifth and Nielsen's Third are only slightly less well known.  The performances are in the darkly modern Copenhagen Koncerthuset, in all its amber-hued, wood-paneled glory.

Brahms' First is widely regarded as the finest first symphony by any classical composer. Brahms' contemporary Hans von Bulow, a renowned pianist and conductor, declared it without irony to be ""Beethoven's Tenth"". Czech composer Antonin Dvorak's Ninth was written while he was temporarily resident in the United States, and carries the title ""From the New World"", its most famous passage being familiar as ""Going Home"". Sibelius' Fifth is one of his two most popular symphonies, the other being the Second, both of which effectively evoke the grandeur of his native Finland. Nielsen is known as Denmark's greatest classical composer, and his Third is the last of his more traditional symphonies before he embarked on ""modern"" styles of music.

The music under the direction of conductor Thomas Dausgaard is beautiful, the audio production excellent, the video razor sharp. But there are thorns in that sharpness. The camera technique employed many extreme close-ups, so tight that the faces and the instruments of the woodwind or brass players cannot entirely be seen. As a performer moves, his face and/or the instrument he is playing bob in and out of the frame. This effect, combined with rapid cutting from player to player, makes for an unpleasant sensation approaching vertigo.

From the static views or slow pans of the 1960s and 70s, to the focus on small groups of players in the 1980s and 90s, camera technique evolved rapidly with the advent of high definition in the first decade of the 21st Century. Now close-ups are the thing, and they have been pushed a bit too far in this production. The music is great, but in the words of a welder friend, you might need to ""avert your eyes"" occasionally to avoid getting seasick.  Or simply watch the production one symphony at a sitting instead of in a marathon concert.

The interviews with Thomas Dausgaard, conducted in English, are informative and well worth a listen, providing enjoyable insight into the music and the conductor's vision regarding how he tries to bring it to life.

This Blu-ray offers nearly three hours of wonderful music, well performed by a top-flight orchestra. All things considered, it is a worthy addition to a classical music video collection.",1350345600,4,2602,5.137115839243499
8605619,4,B00EI6CMC6,"This generously filled disc contains four important symphonic works and is designed to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Beckett Foundation's role in the cultural life of Denmark. In particular this recording is the result of the `Symphonic Summer project' collaboration between the orchestra and the Beckett Foundation. In the bonus section of the disc the conductor, Thomas Dausgard, describes his personal responses to these four works.

The key question that potential purchasers will be asking is whether this disc contains performances that are competitive with other recent issues both musically as well as financially.

The Brahms symphony makes an interesting comparison with the recent performances by Barenboim and Bychkov. Both of those are well respected performances and are weightier in their approach. They both build to excitingly powerful conclusions. This new version is fleeter and leaner throughout and this makes the work come over as a younger man's composition. I personally liked this very much and thought it appropriate for that of a first symphony, even though Brahms was far from being young at the time of composition.

The Nielsen 3 is a very fine performance with sharply delineated lines within the orchestral texture. In my opinion, this compares very favourably with the version by Michael Schonwandt with the same orchestra and which comes as part of a fine set of all 6 symphonies and in good sound. Both are good in their own ways, but the new performance seems to have rather more character and drive - just! The Schonwandt is an unbeatable bulk buy of the complete symphonies though.

The Sibelius 5 comes into competition with the particularly fine recent performance by Oramo and the Stockholm orchestra. That disc also contains an outstanding version of the Tchaikovsky violin concerto with Joshua Bell and starts with an incisive Leonora 3 Overture. Good though this new performance is, I personally prefer the Oramo performance for its extra weight and drama and also for its outstanding couplings.

The Dvorak 9 has strong forward movement as seems typical of this conductor. The first movement exposition repeat is also observed. The whole performance generates considerable excitement and is, for me, far preferable to the altogether steadier Maazel performance with the NYPO. There is, however, a strong competitor with Abbado's fine BPO concert which comes with a fine Brahms violin concerto with Shaham on top form. Although an older HD recording, the BPO sound remains totally impressive in genuine DTS 5.1 and the performance has similar drive.

This new recording provides excellent DTS 5.0 surround sound and stereo (not 5.1 as stated on the box/sleeve). The imaging is crisp and detailed, although I personally would prefer less activity and fewer close-up views of players and instrumental details.

In summary therefore, for my taste and ignoring financial considerations, I would choose Barenboim for Brahms 1, Oramo for Sibelius 5, Dausgard for Nielsen 3 and either Abbado or Dausgard for Dvorak 9. This disc nevertheless provides very satisfying performances of all four works and on that basis alone may well be irresistible for purchasers as it is obviously financially good value.

On musical grounds alone, and in my opinion, there are preferable alternatives to consider as above and therefore 4 stars would be my personal musical assessment. Factoring in financial considerations however, a 5 star assessment may be more appropriate. This fine tuning as to value has to be each individual purchaser's decision therefore. This review is simply intended to be a guide in the complex process of weighing up mixed compilations.

Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:

Another Excellent Review, Ian!
Detailed, Interesting, Cogent, and Logical... (U.K. review)

I have not heard this. But you say, a fleetier version of a younger composer to Brahms 1st? Brahms was shaping his piano concerto 1 to be his first symphony, and composed or finished this one in his early 40s. I think he was done with his youth at that time, considering it was 19th century. Although I find all your reviws to be very helpful, including this one, it has encouraged me Not to buy this one. Thanks (U.K. review)",1341532800,8,4326,5.244573082489146
8605620,5,B00EI6CMC6,"A quick comment on the value offered here - four major symphonies covering almost three hours on one bluray disc - is this because the orchestra and conductor are not that well known and the label wants to introduce them? Certainly, orchestras such as the Berlin Phil. usually offer only normal concert-length fare on their discs - overture, concerto and main work. Whatever the reason, any of the performances on this disc are worth the price of admission, even if they were alone on the disc!

I had not heard of Thomas Dausgaard before, so due diligence sent me googling and to You-Tube before I bought this. His reputation is admirable, having been associated with this Danish orchestra since 2004, as well as many other major ensembles. He is an animated conductor, using hands, face, eyes and body movements for direction and emphasis. Sensitivity to the music abounds, but he could not be accused of ""hanging about"". His tempi are fast-ish, but not enough to blur the details in the scores. He produces a great deal of excitement in his performances.

Not many people would place the Danish National Symphony Orchestra on their list of top ten world orchestras (probably because of limited exposure) but the musicians all play as though they believe they belong with the best. And they do.

C-Major is now producing the best blurays in the industry - audio and video. The degree of detail and articulation revealed on this disc is simply staggering. Particularly notable was the clarity of the cellos and basses. I am very familiar with all four works here (over a fifty year period) and heard things for the first time in this recording. The Koncerthuset hall is acoustically marvelous, so everything is captured to full advantage.

Now to the individual works:-

BRAHMS 1 : Many conductors err by starting this symphony off too slowly - it doesn't need glacial tempi to be thoughtful and somber. Dausgaard takes a fairly swift journey here, but doesn't trivialize the music, and it holds together through all four movements, with the famous ""Elgar-like"" theme heading down the stretch towards a triumphant finale. This is a larger orchestra than Barenboim employs on his excellent BPO bluray, and the extra dynamics really help in the last movement.

DVORAK 9 : The ""New World"" is no stranger to good recordings, but only Abbado/BPO is in bluray and its sound is not at this standard. I judge this symphony on how the conductor handles the ""swing low sweet chariot"" tune in the first movement. When the strings reprise the theme after the woodwind intro, there is a delicious lilt here that seems to escape most conductors. The Largo is most beautifully done, as is the scherzo. The finale is most exciting. Dausgaard is really off to the races here. It should be noted that the Czech flavor of this music appears to be second nature to this conductor.

SIBELIUS 5 : There is one recent bluray of this symphony by Oramo/Royal Stockholm Phil. which is excellent, and this current outing is equal to it. I marginally prefer Dausgaard's broader first movement, and Oramo's more reflective last movement, but I wouldn't be without either. This is my favorite Sibelius symphony, and there is room for different viewpoints. Bernstein has done it (pure Lenny!) and also Salonen (irrelevant). Dausgaard really shows his Scandinavian stripes in this version. I thought the balance was a bit off in the last few bars - it felt a little congested. Otherwise, excellent performance.

NIELSEN 3 : Not as familiar to some as the other three symphonies, but definitely in their league - Nielsen has a unique tonal voice. This is a very happy symphony. The first movement centers around a rollicking waltz which the whooping horns pick up, almost sounding like Richard Strauss. The second movement features wordless vocals from a tenor and soprano, followed by a pretty allegretto, and then a rambunctious finale. All good stuff. If you've never heard this, you'll love it. If you have, this is the best version. Again, wonderful sonics.

There is a monologue from Dausgaard as an extra, which I started to listen to, but felt it was meant more for people unfamiliar with this music.

A great bargain, then, and let's hope more is coming from this combo.",1338768000,29,4247,4.877947295423024
8605621,5,B00EI6CMC6,"This is my second encounter on DVD with the Danish National Symphony Orchestra, the first being the fine, though not white-hot, Nielsen symphonies set under the direction of Michael Schnwandt (Dacapo 2006), and my introduction to Thomas Dausgaard, now the orchestra's honorary conductor. The generous program of four popular symphonies (total time: 168 minutes) was recorded in 2009 in excellent audio and high definition video in Copenhagen's beautiful Koncerthuset, an outstanding acoustic venue. Already upon first hearing, I was more than impressed with the superb standard of music making, ensemble and leadership. The DNSO is a world-class orchestra, second to none, in all individual sections, in solo work and in finesse and unanimity. It is obvious that they enjoy playing with their then chief conductor and to a visibly receptive audience. Dausgaard is a highly dynamic and, at the same time, equally sensitive musician who approaches these staples of the standard repertoire with fresh insights and incredible lan.

The Brahms First begins with a somber, ominously bleak first movement, taken at a nimble speed and - as opposed to so many readings - not dragging at all. With the consecutive movements, the mood lightens until the finale leads up to a blaze of glory. This is not one of my truly favorite symphonies, but in the hands of the Danes I find it quite appealing, even more so than in Barenboim's very good recent recording with the Berlin Philharmonic (Euroarts 2010). Dausgaard's Dvorak Nine is simply fantastic: there is vigor, strength, nostalgia, a true Bohemian lilt, a lot of portamento and rubato, and every movement a joy and just right. Needless to say, the recording faces stiff competition (Neumann and Pesek despite dated audio and video, the fiery Dudamel in the birthday concert for Pope Benedict), but it is in a class of its own and might well end up first on your list of favorites. As can be expected, both the Sibelius and the Nielsen symphonies are played to the hilt: fiercely idiomatic, full of ""Nordic"" atmosphere and wonderfully shaped. For the Sibelius Fifth, my yardstick DVD performance is Sakari Oramo's with the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra (Nobel Prize Concert), slightly leaner and grittier (this might also be due to the recording), but Dausgaard is just as powerful and dramatic, on the same level of musicianship, perhaps a bit more ""romantic"". There seems to be a minute or two of minor sound congestion immediately before the symphony's ending - but it could be my hearing. The Nielsen Third, admittedly an acquired taste where a lot depends on the reading, is the best I have heard in a long time: joyful, melodic but sharp-edged and, yes, quite ""expansive"". All in all, these are outstanding performances: you can't go wrong with this disk.

A brief note on Dausgaard's bonus ""interviews"" (monologs) in which he offers his explanations of these four very different works. He seems to approach them on a ""narrative"" or quasi-philosophical level, each as a journey from struggle/ darkness to light/ redemption (per aspera ad astra) with a few transcendental aspects thrown in. These or similar formulae - I am trying to get around the term clichs - may well apply to many of the great scores in the musical canon, however, if you listen carefully, his description of the purely musical events and developments is much more captivating. It also provides a glimpse at the subtext of his own interpretations which are consistently shaped in an enormous arc from beginning to end, always linear and with the final bar firmly in mind.",1338681600,11,3598,5.055555555555555
