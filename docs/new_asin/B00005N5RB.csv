7946249,5,B00005N5RB,"Not quite a snappy as ""The Worst Witch"" movie with Fairuza Balk and Tim Curry, but very good and sweet, clean fun with beautiful scenic filming locations. Satisfies my ""instant justice"" wish that I can't execute in real life.",1357171200,,225,4.794871794871795
7946250,5,B00005N5RB,"Very nice stories.  Liked the 3-volume box set.  Wish it came in DVD format.  Nonetheless, it is a great product.  Enjoyed very much. Sincerely, L.",1304985600,,147,4.76

I bought this movie for my 5 year old daughter, because I remember how much I liked it when I was a kid. She loves this movie, along with my 3 year old daughter, so I bought them the set of the series, and they really enjoy that too. Of course, now my daughter is always making ""potions"" and trying to get her older brother to drink them. I love movies that bring out a childs imagination.",1237507200,,740,6.882978723404255
7946252,5,B00005N5RB,"An excellent series about Mildred a young witch starting at Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches (a boarding witch's secondary school). It's based on the few 'Worst Witch' books by Jill Murphy (a child's easy good read as well).

This DVD set has the last seven episodes taken from the first series (year 7), and so is very good value. Note that in the US this UK/Canadian series was tastelessly dubbed in `American' but fortunately there is a `UK English' option in the DVD setup menu so you can hear the stars real voices if you ish (the choice is yours). The rest of series one (episodes 1 to 6) is on the 'Battle of Broomsticks/Mean Halloween' two DVD NTSC set', also available from Amazon.

These DVD's are still some of my 11 year old daughters favourite viewing and would suite 8 upwards. They aren't as scary as Harry Potter and all the cast are really excellent in their roles - Miss Hardbroom [Kate Duchene] even turned down a role in the Harry Potter film to remain true to her TV character.

Typical quotes: ""Magic must not be used for selfish or trivial ends!"" - Miss Cackle, ""Confidence and control, Mildred - that's the secret of success."" - Miss Hardbroom. So highly recommended for non-boy offspring - this series is easily a notch above the average TV sitcom or teen movie.",1168560000,2,1288,4.591304347826087
7946253,5,B00005N5RB,The worst witch is the best tv show ive seen in years. That great acting of kate duchene's constance hardbroom brings her tall body of 5'10  and of her scary looking face & black tight dress that of a nice purple night gown. Kate looks like a baby when her hair is down she looks less scary then when it's up . It's a good show for kids & teenagers I've seen.,1018224000,2,359,3.986111111111111
