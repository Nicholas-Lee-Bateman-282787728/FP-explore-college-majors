If you're interested in knowing more about how your body functions and what you can do to have better health, than I would highly recommend this video for the average person.",1423008000,,287,4.74
8433915,5,B004L73FN2,"When I thought I new just about everything when it comes to probiotics, I learned even more thanks to this great CD.  I've had severe IBS-C for overs 2 years now, tried everything under the sun (psyllium, miralax, eating enormous amounts of vegetables, drinking lots of fluids, etc.) to no avail.  Started researching probiotics, trying different kinds to finally hone in on the ones with multiple strains, and also Kefir (which I learned about from the CD).  After a while things started working better and better.  I'm completely off miralax and fiber supplements (that never worked in my case).  I was obviously severely deficient in the good gut bacteria dept.  I also had other problems stemming from that imbalance (yeast infections, UTI's -- all gone now!).  It's time to ditch meds and rebuild our bodies the natural way!",1387065600,,829,4.963768115942029
8433916,2,B004L73FN2,"Very basic info regarding probotics, does not go into different types and how to pick out a strain. Must have been backed by the dairy industry, seem to push yogart and other dairy products with probiotics. The best way to get the good bacteria is via refrigerated capsules.",1312675200,6,274,4.729166666666667
8433917,5,B004L73FN2,"Having just started taking probiotics this week, I wanted to learn more about their latest information and health benefits.  I was very happy to discover that ""Microwarriors"" explains the importance of this topic.  I found the film very interesting, easy to understand, and entertaining. The doctors who were featured were  credible and well spoken. In addition to discussing the latest science, it answers a lot of questions I was curious about. I would highly recommend this film!",1309824000,4,482,5.233766233766234
8433918,2,B004L73FN2,"I expected a lot more from this movie. The information was rather general and superficial. There wasn't even any mention of how probiotics produce vitamin K or synthesize folic acid. I came out knowing exactly as much as what I already knew, or rather, I already knew more than what the movie taught me. For the general public, this movie might be interesting, but then they might as well go to a health food store and find out from an employee about the benefits of probiotics - immunity, digestion etc. But HOW does it work?? This is what the movie did not address at all, nor did it talk about any specific strains for specific purposes. The movie almost seemed like an upgraded commercial for dairy products. The chapters seemed randomly chosen, some only 2 minutes max long without much connection of what the chapter title was (f. e. ""What's in your breakfast"" and later on ""Probiotics in food"") and what was talked about in that segment. No information on delivery systems, only hints here and there, just like the entire movie seemed to be hinting at the real depth of the topic without ever going into it.",1306713600,5,1114,4.6313131313131315
8433919,5,B004L73FN2,"A picture is worth a thousand words... or a trillion microbes! ""Probiotics"" is a difficult and wordy concept to explain: ""live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host."" Huh?

What if you had an entertaining and factually accurate DVD that could do the job for you? You could teach (or learn) about probiotics the easy way, watching lively graphics and hearing the story of probiotics directly from world-class experts! This movie really brings the miniature, yet powerful, world of our microbial life-partners up to a size that anyone can see and understand. The experts interviewed in the movie are the real deal. I heard two of them, Dr. Mary Ellen Sanders and Dr. Martin Floch, speak last month (4/2011) at the Yale Workshop on Advances in Probiotic Use.

If you are a consumer who wants to learn more about the relationship between humans and bacteria, and about the manufacture and use of probiotic foods and supplements, you will learn a lot from this movie. If you are a health care provider or an educator, this movie will make a great teaching tool, and is an excellent addition to your professional media library.",1305331200,4,1178,4.914572864321608
8433920,5,B004L73FN2,"For years I've known about the importance of Probiotics but always felt a bit confused trying to figure out which strains are more effective,deciding between taking single or Multiple strains or is it better to get your probiotics from Foods and Beverages VS Supplements and Powders--And most importantly, what do the experts really think about the latest science and studies about them.

The Good News is Microwarriors: The Power of Probiotics clearly answers all these questions and alot more! Having watched many Science programs my first thought was that it was going to be just another stiff ""science program""  but thankfully it wasn't. It actually was an engaging story with great graphics, and was extremely interesting and entertaining. I would highly recommend Microwarriors for anyone either considering trying Probiotics or currently taking them in one form or another.",1304726400,3,880,5.369565217391305
