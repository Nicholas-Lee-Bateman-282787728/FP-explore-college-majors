2796378,3,B000OIOPLS,"The movie was ok.  The plot was good.  The acting was ok.  The subject matter, and the thought that something like that could actually happen, might be a bit unnerving to someone who's had previous issues with any type of home care or may be facing issues with home care.  If so, I don't think I'd recommend they watch this.  Otherwise, the movie isn't too bad.",1386806400,,361,4.409090909090909
2796379,4,B000OIOPLS,"I got this movie on a DVD along with The Howling IV and was pleasantly surprised.  Contrary to the cover, it is not a horror movie intended for gore hounds, but a rather good thriller instead.",1354752000,,192,4.333333333333333
2796380,3,B000OIOPLS,"I've never heard of The Nurse before watching it tonight, in which it has a similar feel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hand-That-Rocks-the-Cradle/dp/B00005AXK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hand That Rocks the Cradle</a>. The movie stars Lisa Zane (Billy Zane's older sister) as Laura Harriman, a nurse who wants revenge!

Her father had recently murdered her mother and brother. Then he took his own life, all because he was accused of embezzling money. Bob Martin is the man who turned him over to the police and after hearing about the deaths, he has a stroke which leaves him paralyzed.

Laura wants revenge for her family's deaths, so she kills Bob's live-in-nurse and she becomes his new nurse. Since he is paralyzed, he can't inform his wife or children about who the nurse really is. One by one, Laura plans on killing each family member while Bob watches helplessly.

The movie was released to direct-to-video (aka VHS) in the late 90s and thanks for Echo Bridge Home Entertainment for releasing it to DVD, I bought the movie in an eight movie bundle. I didn't know what to expect when I saw Lisa Zane's name in the opening credits as I never cared for her in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freddy-s-Dead-The-Final-Nightmare/dp/0780630890/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare</a>, but she gave a good performance as a psycho nurse. The movie is less horror and more like a made-for-TV thriller, except it has a few f-bombs in it. The Nurse isn't really scary, but I was entertained for 90 minutes!",1347148800,2,1628,5.636734693877551
2796381,2,B000OIOPLS,"The Nurse stars obscure actress Lisa Zane as Susan, a revengful nurse who is on a prowl to kill the family that ratted out her embezzler father; Thus causing her father to kill her younger brother, wife and himself out of cowardness. The man who ratted out her father suffrs a locked in stroke(He's can hear and see and understand but is physcically paralyzed). Susan ends up getting a job as this mans live at home nurse and starts to act all crazy and such. You can guess waht will happen next.... a family member has the heebie jeebies about the new nurse...The nurse seduces the son... She kills a few poeple.. She gest in a cat fight with a female family member... and then she dies... Surpised! I ended up buying this movie as a 4 movie horror pack at a used music/dvd store. I whatched it and I've seen this same movie before with different titles before. It's bassically a made for T.V movie type thriller. It's a movie you channel surf to on The lifetome Movie Network when ther is nothing else on. The movie is bland and drab of any real color or imagination. The film is directed by Robert Malenfant who directed ""The landlady"" another paint by the numbers movie Starring Talia Shire remeber her from ""The Godfather"" movies well now she's palying a crazy landlady now. Enjoy with caution.",1279584000,,1299,4.531914893617022
2796382,1,B000OIOPLS,"ITEM WAS RECIEVED IN TIMELY FASHION,WAS IN PERFECT COND.,BUT IF YOU GOT MORE THAN A SLIGHT CHUCKLE BECAUSE OF HOW PATHETIC IT WAS, THEN YOU HAVE NEVER HAVE SEEN A REAL HORROR MOVIE.",1232409600,,181,4.515151515151516
2796383,4,B000OIOPLS,"Third movie in the boxset. I've always wanted to see this for some time after seeing a Pay-Per-View promo. I've also been a fan of actress Lisa Zane for some time.

The movie centers around a nurse named Laura Harriman who becomes traumatized after seeing her father kill himself over an embezzlement scandel, after he kills his own family, except for Laura. She then becomes bent on getting even with stroke victim Bob Martin (Played by Michael Fairman from Dead Silence) who is parylzed and at the same time mute. She gets a chance to do so when she gets a job as his private nurse.  Laura gets her revenge by killing members of the Martin family one by one.

I don't really wanna give too much away, especially since the hurricane's approaching. I'll end this review by saying if you can find this movie, get it. The DVD quality's pretty good too.",1221177600,4,850,4.542483660130719
2796384,4,B000OIOPLS,if you like lifetime cheesy thrillers (like i do) you'll like this. its kinda predictable but good for a lazy weekend in bed.,1212105600,,125,4.478260869565218

8185144,2,B000OIOPLS,"This movie had all the look, feel, and acting abilities of a ""Made for TV"" movie from the early 90's.  It even starred the mom from ""One Day at a Time"".  Don't let the tantalizing ""B-slasher"" looking 'cover' fool you, but for a single F-bomb there is no foul language, depictions of violence, or nudity whatsoever in this movie.  The characters are not well developed, the acting is flat, and some of the character actions are non-nonsensical.",1478217600,,443,4.7272727272727275

8185146,5,B000OIOPLS,"I both love, and miss, the suspense thrillers from the 80's and 90's.  This is a good one.  Lisa Zane is terrific.  Janet Gunn (from Silk Stalkings) is one of my favorites.  Both the house and corresponding scenery were lovely.  I only wish that William Moses had been in it more.",1453507200,,280,4.411764705882353
8185147,2,B000OIOPLS,"This film reminded of ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle."" George Harriman (Lou Felder) a poorly developed character has been terminated from his fictional movie company for embezzling and to top it all off he might go to prison. Like any white collar criminal faced with ""hard"" time in a federal pen, he opts to do the honorable thing and shoot his family and himself...except for some reason he omits his daughter who is a nurse (Lisa Zane as Laura Harriman ).

When George's former boss Bob (Michael Fairman) hears about it he goes catatonic, like Ned seeing the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka (South Park season 2). Laura assumes a new identity to infiltrate the home as a nurse so she can bump off Bob's family in front of him.

The terror and acting were both lame. Except for the rare F-bomb, this could have been a made for TV movie. Perhaps my biggest disappointment was right after I obtained this film I discovered it was available in a multi-film pack for the same price.

Rare F-bomb, no sex or nudity. What this movie really needed was for Demi Moore to play the lead with a token shower scene and a little more success and creativity in killing off relatives.",1445558400,,1183,4.544600938967136
