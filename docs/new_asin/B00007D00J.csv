1807106,1,B00007D00J,"I ordered this set, and I was not able to use it because the AM tape does not work in my VCR.  I have a relatively new Emerson VCR, and the AM tape didn't work when I tried to play it.  There seemed to be a tracking problem that never went away.  Thinking it was a defective tape, I had another set sent to me, and the same thing happened.  I even tried to contact Gaiam, and they were completely unhelpful.",1083110400,2,407,3.9876543209876543
1807107,5,B00007D00J,"I'd been thinking about trying yoga for awhile, since I no longer have the time (working full time plus school 4 nights a week) to go to the gym, and my health was suffering from the strenuous schedule and the stress, and the horrendous insomnia. I really wanted something that I could do at home, that wouldn't annoy me so much that I'd watch it once then sell it on Ebay. Also really needed something that I could do at night that wouldn't energize me so much that I'd be even MORE unable to sleep. After alot of shopping around(reading the back of every yoga video at Borders), I finally decided on this two pack set.  What a lovely surprise! My favorite feature of this set is the voice-over technique - that is, she doesn't speak to you as she's doing the poses, but you hear her voice. I can't say enough about that. (I bought the Crunch Fat Burning Yoga tape, and was just too annoyed with the instructor talking all the way through it to get too far. Well, also, it's a little too advanced for me.) I'm definitely going to try to stick with videos with voice overs.
The workouts are challenging for a beginner (downward facing dog can be daunting the first couple of times) but very relaxing, and she doesn't hold the poses so long that you feel stressed or get bored. I liked the flow of the tapes, although I still have some awkward transitions (I'm thinking I will get smoother as I get better.)
I found it amazing that yoga could make me sore! As a former workout junkie (who is admittedly VERY out of shape since starting school), I need that day-after soreness to feel as though I've done something, and these tapes provide me with that.
I would highly recommend this set to a beginner. It's relaxing, soothing, AND energizing and she really centers you with talk about softening your eyes, and breathing into the spread of your shoulders blades and the like. She cues your breathing very nicely, and always reminds you to engage your abs or widen your shoulders. She reminds you to experience the moment you're in, and to really feel your body.
I can't say enough about these tapes. They've gotten me excited about yoga, and I'm definitely going to be collecting more tapes, and coming up with my own regime. I'm even starting to modify my eating habits a bit.
Especially for the price, you canNOT beat this. Well, speaking from total ignorance, having bought this set and the Fat Burning! Decide upon your own grain of salt, but in my opinion: BUY IT! :)",1041465600,79,2470,4.501113585746102

1807135,5,B00007D00J,"One of the reasons that this video will become a core staple of your yoga practice (as it develops) is that Suzanne's approach to beginning a yoga practice is explained and demonstrated with clear, common sense. She conveys the gentleness and strength of yoga, while encouraging you to stretch yourself a little and to pay attention to your body's messages and abilities. The bonus workout and the interview with her that are included on the DVD serve to deepen your practice when you are ready. Suzanne's teaching style and fluid movements are easy to follow and inspiring to learn.  Over time, you begin to feel that you have a personal, interested yoga instructor with a non-critical desire to see you become whole and connected through mind-body-spirit.
There are many forms of Yoga and many ways to practice. This DVD gives you a beginning point and through practice you will find that you begin to notice subtle changes in your breathing, your posture and your outlook. This DVD is a good place to begin and a safe place to return to whether you are just beginning a yoga practice, or returning to it after a long hiatus.",1276560000,4,1127,4.75
1807136,5,B00007D00J,"I absolutely love this set.  The morning and evening routines are just different enough to keep them interesting.

Her instructions on each pose is so complete you don't have to look at the tape unless you want to.  Which makes it easier to do the poses that have your head turned  away from the  screen. However, as was stated by another reviewer that purchased this set the AM tape has a tracking problem.  I noticed it to late to return it or get another one.  I was about to purchase another set from Amazon because of this problem. I am thankful I read the reviews first.  I will purchase this AM tape again because I enjoy working with Suzanne.  Maybe if I purchase it separately it will work properly.",1231372800,,744,4.333333333333333
1807138,5,B00007D00J,"I really like this product. I've had it for almost 2 years. I like it because it is easily understood, safe and the poses are good for a beginner while still being challening.  I like the length of the sessions to as they are easy to fit into a busy day. I use the PM yoga routine religiously after my runs at night to stretch muscles stressed from running, to relieve stress, and maintain flexibility. In fact, I bought this product to help me manage work stress and I highly recommend it for that alone.",1229644800,6,505,4.315789473684211
1807139,3,B00007D00J,"White waves wrote a great review in 9/22/2005.
The scenery is beautiful, Susan's words are inspirational & on cue, but the pace of speaking is slow. This workout seems to be geared to absolute beginners with limited flexibility & endurance. There are a lot of short breaks between poses. There is heavy use of blocks & straps & many poses are modified. If you have decent flexibilty, just don't use these props.
The AM starts with 5 min of breathing, then child's pose, lunges, standing fwd bend, chair pose w/breathing, mountain pose, modified standing thigh stretch, standing wide legged torso side stretches, triangle, side angle,  standing wide legged stretch. Then sitting torso twist, butterfly (no going down), modified boat. Laying down, a simple sustained ab crunch, knee to chest stretch, knee to side spinal twist, bridge pose. Laying on stomach, raising torso on ground with hans still on ground. Then downward dog & sitting in meditation.
PM: Begins with 5 min of scenery & mountain pose with breathing. Using towel, simple shoulder stretch, child's pose, downward dog, lunges, standing wide legged stretch, downward dog, child's pose, staff pose, modified sitting 1 legged fwd bend, sitting wide legged simple torso stretches, sitting 1 leg out to side torso side stretch. Laying down 1 straight leg to sky stretch, straight legs in air (very modified plow), knees to chest, knee to side spinal twist & ends in meditation.
The Bonus 20 min breathwork is a more normal pace, beginners' workout with out props & full poses. Twisted seated position, standing fwd bend, mountain, modified standing 1 legged pose, warrior 1, standing stretch for thighs, wide legged standing fwd bend. Then half kneeling torso side stretch, then lying down: locust, bow & bridge, 1 leg in air stretch & to the side. Then ab work while on elbows & legs raised in various degrees. Then seated twisted sage pose, sitting 1 straight leg stretch, seated wide legged sterch & ends with seated 2 min meditation.

The 5 min trailer is still at gaiam com but not sure how much longer.",1171843200,38,2067,4.953890489913545
1807140,4,B00007D00J,"This DVD has two pleasant and well-balanced yoga routines, but the ""weight loss"" is just a title and a couple of kind words in the introduction.  If you have a limited amount of time and want to maximize pounds lost, this isn't the right choice for you.

Also, be warned that you do need props (blocks and a strap) to do the poses as instructed.",1170979200,5,345,4.292307692307692
1807141,4,B00007D00J,This DVD gives two good structured workouts. They are propped but can be done without if you have some experience. I would say this is more intermediate than beginner as the queueing is somewhat basic and may be too quick of you are very new to yoga. I do find that I need a good warm up before I can do the AM workout as opposed to the AM section of the AM/PM yoga for beginners DVD. Still a good additional option.,1170374400,10,416,4.085365853658536
1807142,5,B00007D00J,"Having never done yoga in my life, I decided to give it a try to help reduce my stress levels.  I have very little free time so I didn't want to have to commit to an hour at a time knowing I'd never do it.  As a result of too much stress I was having trouble with my neck, shoulders, and back.  The first week or so the poses were hard but not impossible to preform.  I could really tell where the tension was in my body!  I've been doing this dvd faithfully for almost three weeks and the difference is amazing.  The tension is all but gone, I am much stronger in the poses, I feel much more relaxed and sleep better!

The program itself is put together nicely...soft, unobtrusive music; beautiful scenery; and the instruction is easy to follow with very clear explanations. Suzanne does use yoga blocks which I recommend...they really help in the morning workout when you are less flexible.  She also uses a yoga strap and wedge. Obviously, you can't just do this workout and lose weight.  As Suzanne says on the dvd, it's part of a healthy lifestyle.

Being a Christian, I hesitated to do yoga because I didn't want to be pressed upon by the belief system behind it but I don't feel that at all with this dvd.  It's an excellent workout and I highly recommend it!",1168473600,21,1266,4.3446808510638295
1807143,4,B00007D00J,"It's called conditioning for weight loss, but it's just an all around nice workout. Here are the things I like about this product:

1) The DVD lets you choose from four difficulty levels, or watch them combined. I really liked working my way through the levels so the same workout remained challenging. If I'm having a bad day and am too stiff, I can scale back to a lower level for that day.

2) I am a musician and am picky about background music. The Gaiam series of yoga tapes that I've purchased all have pleasant evocative, well performed music that doesn't annoy or distract me, but supports the ambience I'm wanting.

3.) I appreciate yoga and the culture that developed it, but I prefer to imbue the experience with my own spirituality, so I appreciate a workout that doesn't push any belief system too heavily.

4.) The instructor talks during many of the poses about how the different poses can affect your health. This is interesting and informative.",1168300800,56,962,4.674556213017752
1807144,5,B00007D00J,"I LOVE these practices! They go so well with the longer Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss. The A.M practice is my particular favorite, it really gets me going, I do it almost everyday, in addition to a longer practice later in the afternoon. If I'm particulary rushed, I might repeat the A.M. practice, I like it so much. The P.M is pretty good, too; I get to sleep quicker when I do it.",1154563200,10,387,4.315068493150685
1807145,5,B00007D00J,"I bought this set on a whim, despite the fact that I already own a dozen other yoga and pilates videos and dvds.  I hadn't found one that worked for my lifestyle yet, but hope springs eternal, right?

This set exceeded my wildest hopes.  The 25-minute workouts are short enough to fit into what spare time I can scrape together, but very effective and at the perfect difficulty level for an out-of-shape beginner who is new to yoga.  If you use the props as shown in the videos (I do recommend getting the props!), you will increase your strength and flexibility without risking injury or wearing yourself out to the point that you don't want to do it the next day.

This workout is not going to make you drop pounds quickly.  It's only mildly strenuous and is in no way an aerobic workout.  However, it will tone your muscles FAST and you WILL lose inches and, eventually, pounds, by doing it.  If you're in the market for a way to shape up without bouncing around, or you've been wanting to ease your way into yoga, this is definitely the product for you.

Suzanne Deason is an excellent instructor:  her voice-over explains precisely how to do each pose the right way, in terms that are easy to understand, and her voice is perfectly modulated and soothing.  These videos will work you out but leave you relaxed and refreshed -- which is exactly the goal of any good yoga routine. The morning routine wakes me up and gives me the energy I need for the day, and the evening routine leaves me relaxed and ready for bed.  What more can you ask, really?

All in all, I've more than gotten my money's worth out of this set, and fully expect to end up replacing it when I wear out the video. When I do, I only hope it's still available.",1131408000,5,1733,4.394984326018808
1807146,4,B00007D00J,"AM/PM Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss provides three short yoga practices (AM, PM, and a bonus practice) that are especially appropriate for someone just starting out with yoga, but more experienced yogis looking for some shorter, basic practices are likely to enjoy these as well.  Although the workouts in and of themselves are unlikely to provide weight loss, instructor Suzanne Deason makes a point of saying (both on the DVD itself and in the helpful included leaflet) that these practices form just a part of an overall weight loss program that would also include healthy eating and other fitness activities.

All three practices are filmed in beautiful outdoor settings, and for both the AM and the PM workouts, there is a list of poses included in the accompanying leaflet.  The AM practice begins and ends in hero's pose (which I believe she calls ""seated warrior"").  It focuses on gentle opening of all areas of the body through lunges, standing poses, twists, and finally, simple core work and backbends; two yoga bricks are used to allow greater access to the postures.  The PM practice also uses props, this time a yoga wedge and strap (substitutions can be made for these).  It starts with some nice shoulder openers using the strap and then includes just a few standing postures such as downward dog, lunge, and wide-legged forward bend.  However, the focus of this practice is on seated forward bends, which are supposed to be calming, and so you will do a variety of these before ending in relaxation pose.  The AM and the PM workouts come in at just under 25 minutes each.

The bonus workout, Breathwork Through Yoga, is a bit shorter (about 22 minutes).  This time, Deason does not use any props (although she reminds you of how you can use them as in the other programs if you wish), and she places a greater emphasis on the breath while moving through the postures, with the practice beginning and ending in a seated meditation.  She again leads a brief series of standing poses--pyramid pose is included this time, and the wide-legged standing forward bend is especially nice--moves to kneeling for gate pose, and then moves to the floor for both backbends and core work.  The most challenging poses included in this practice are probably bow pose and a boat pose variation; therefore, it has a higher difficultly level than the other two practices but would still be very doable for experienced beginners.  A final bonus on the DVD is an approximately 7-minute interview with Suzanne Deason during which she explains the rationale behind each of the workouts.

Overall, this DVD provides some excellent practice experiences for those new to yoga as well as offers options for the more experienced yoga practitioner.",1119571200,101,2740,4.915401301518438
