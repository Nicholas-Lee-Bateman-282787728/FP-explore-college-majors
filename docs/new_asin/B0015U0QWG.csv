3147357,4,B0015U0QWG,"I'm surprised there aren't more and higher reviews. This film definitely isn't for everyone but what movie is? Since you've probably already read what the movie is about let me just add that this is a well acted and ORIGINAL (imagine that!) film. I don't believe this could ever be made in Hollywood it's just too good.

If you like dark humour. If you are tired of typical American films with losers like Tom Cruise and other Hollywood superstars shoveling the same old tired, hyped up schlock then you will love this one. I can't give out any spoilers but in this film there is suspense, anger and beautiful retribution (if somewhat spread out). Watch this movie. You'll be happy you did.",1214697600,2,690,4.655737704918033
3147358,3,B0015U0QWG,"I'm a horror buff in the making, catching up on classics and cults and devouring what's new (with exception of brainless torture porn).

Otis falls prey to a young director (Tony Krantz) having too many ideas for one movie, which takes a top-notch premise and clouds it with bells and whistles.

Otis' character is fleshed-out, sympathetic, and wonderfully acted by Bostin Christopher. I went back and forth between hating and loving him. Also, a bravo to Ashley Johnson (What Women Want and others) for an overall wonderful performance.

Where this movie fails is:
- the score, which is near constant and distracting. I understand to homage it makes, but it should never overlap key dialogue.
- Edits skip from the exquisitely handled basement scenes to the family, which is cut like a sitcom at best and weak kitsch at worst.
- the twist at the end. Not so much a negative as a missed opportunity. Yes, unpredictable. Yes, lots of better opportunities with these great characters.
-Some characters sucked the life out of the film. Jere Burns as Agent Hotchkiss. Yes, he was intended (I hope) to be a caricature for inept and useless cops in a visceral situation beyond what the law could do, but does he always have to be chewing gum? Being insensitive? Overt characters have a purpose, but if you lose the subtley there you have to make it up somewhere else.

Some positives
+ GREAT basement scenes and use of filters
+ original concept in a wash of the same
+ some great characters and relationships
+ Kevin Pollak with the convincing supporting role??? wow.

In short:
Well worth a rental for horror junkies and enthusiasts. You owe it to yourself to see how Otis and Riley play off each other. The ending twist, schizophrenic production and overpowering score confuse an otherwise good film.

Parents: Not too much gore in this movie beyond an intense scene at the end. Nothing above what a mature teen could handle. Some drug references and mild sexual situations and an expected amount of violence.",1213747200,,2006,4.8
3147359,4,B0015U0QWG,"Otis is not a bad movie.  Otis is like The Last House On The Left, only more campy.  All the actors had good chemistry, but what bothered me was Daniel Stern and Kevin Pollak's part.  Stern looks more like Otis than his on screen brother, Pollak.  Other than that, I had myself quite a few laughs and loved what few scenes of violence there were.  This isn't your typical horror movie.  I'm sure it's a few virgin's fantasies, but not a typical horror movie.  3 and a half stars.  Worth the rent.",1213488000,2,496,4.315217391304348
3147360,4,B0015U0QWG,"This is a STRANGE movie.  We saw the trailer for it on ""The Orphanage"" DVD and thought, well that movie looks pretty funny, let's get that.

Short Synopsis: Otis is a hulking pervert who captures teenage girls and takes them home where he fulfills his high school fantasies, forcing them to ""play along.""  Otis got more than he bargained for when he abducts Riley whose family has a collective screw loose to begin with.

This movie was funny in a dark and almost sad way.  Everyone in the film is warped so the only character you can really identify with is Riley... and she doesn't say much.  The scenes between Riley and Otis are by far the most well acted in the film, they are both disturbing and hysterically funny.  Riley's family however never seemed to click, what should have been the funniest scenes in the movie were overacted which seriously drained the humor out of them.  Each character was funny in their own right, but as a unit they never meshed completely.  Still this was a very enjoyable film with much less gore than anticipated, no nudity (sorry boys) but for those of you who don't like profanity, this movie is full of it.  I don't have an issue with profanity in R rated movies... but the profanity in this one feels a bit forced, as if either the actors weren't comfortable using it, or they just couldn't get the rhythm of what they were saying.

Even though the acting was a bit off, this was a really fun movie with quite a few laughs.  I would say its best viewed in a group setting with a couple of beers and popcorn.

Since it's unrated I'll give you my rating synopsis -
Nudity - None, though there is a girl in her underwear.
Sex - None seen, though it is mentioned and alluded to
Violence - I'd give this an R for one particular scene
Profanity - Definite R
Drug use - There is mention of drugs, and you see the son popping pills.",1213228800,31,1866,4.373913043478261
3147361,4,B0015U0QWG,"I caught Otis at the SXSW film festival in Austin, and it was one of the stand out films of the event.

Otis is a serial killer who kidnaps young pretty girls to fulfill his own dreams of what he missed in high school.  Eventually these girls fight back and die.  His latest victim, Riley (the beautiful Ashley Johnson) has a bit more fight than he's used to.  And her family is even more aggressive.

The cast does a great job pulling the story together.  Illena Douglas, who always does a great job, is incredible as the mother who has gone a little crazy.  Ashley Johnson is perfect as Riley.  She has that nice combo of being both hot and yet very sweet at the same time, much like the character she played on CSI.

I think the stand out actor on this is Jared Kusnitz, who I also saw in Dance of the Dead (incredibly good movie).  Somehow the movie gets a little funnier every time he's in a scene.

One note on casting...I couldn't help feeling like Kevin Pollack and Daniel Stern were cast in each others roles as the brother of Otis and the father of Ashley Johnson, repetitively.  They both did a great job, but Daniel Stern looks much more like the brother of Otis than Pollack.  Although I do love the scenes with Stern and Kusnitz.

Otis is a movie best viewed with some friends who enjoy black comedies.  This film's pretty dark, but really enjoyable.",1211846400,15,1364,4.378486055776892

3147391,4,B0015U0QWG,"It seems I have been reviewing a lot of horror movies these days. It's not on purpose. I do like other types of movies, but I keep hearing good things about certain ""never released to the screen"" horror movies that I keep trying them out. Considering my reviews, like for Teeth, you'd think I review them just to blast them. Finally, I have something good to say, after watching the wonderful serial joker, Otis.

  Otis is the story of a forty-something year-old pedophile named Otis(played by new-comer Boston Christopher) who is looking for a date for the prom. He does the right things, asking a girl's parents for permission to date their daughter, rocking out the old school Trans-Am, throwing around the old pig skin, calling the girl on the telephone all the time, and working hard as a pizza delivery boy. The problem is, he does this all after kidnapping the girls and locking them in his basement, torturing them mentally and physically, and usually killing them, accidentally. This has happened five times, the authorities have no clues, and he is continuing his quest for the perfect date for the prom.

  Otis kidnaps one lucky teenager, Riley Lawson (played by Ashley Johnson), but is thwarted by her attempt to actually allow him to work his magic as a supreme catch, all 400 pounds of him. Her family, upon learning of Otis' place of residence, take it upon themselves to unleash vengeance in ways Otis himself could not dream, with disasterous, and funny, results.

  What's great about this movie is how it portrays Otis himself. He is a psychotic pedophile, but through the movie we gain some sympathy for him, even while he is hacking up his latest date that dumped him. It is this sympathy that makes us laugh at ourselves, and the movie itself. This would seem bad, but the movie calls for it hungrily.

  Riley's family is fantastic. Daniel Stern and Illeana Douglas play the part of doting parents wonderfully. They are the stereotypical suburban family, with a Otis Movie Familyloving daughter and a delinquent son. Their try at vengeance plays on this wholesomeness, and makes a movie like Last House on the Left seem pale in comparison, if only for its odd outcome. There is one scene where the family is unloading their truck that is absolutely ridiculous.

  Kevin Pollak plays Otis' naive and abusive brother. Although only a supporting role, the role he plays in the family's vengeance is like nothing I've ever seen before. Think of a battery hooked up to a man's sphincter. If you find that funny, you will love Pollak, again. The FBI agent, played by Jere Burns, fleshes out the hysterics. It is his bumbling police work that makes the rest of the movie work. If he actually had a brain in his head, maybe they would have caught Otis the second time around. I'm sure glad THAT didn't happen.

  This movie was a breath of fresh air for the horror comedy genre. The laughs are as black as night, and it works to make you feel a bit uncomfortable, but still giddy at the same time. The gore factor was a bit lacking, but the elements of imagination, such as drinking your own toes, are ripe. If the gore was there, it would probably lose a lot of its comedic elements.

All in all, I give this movie 4 out of 5 dateless nights. Now let's go to prom in our baby-blue tuxes!

P.S.-The alternate ending is NOT to be missed.",1262044800,,3353,4.631756756756757
3147392,4,B0015U0QWG,"I didn't know what to think of when I first see the title. But as a thriller horror(?) fan, I thought I should just give this movie a chance, and I did. Glad I did though. That was an experience.

Otis is a psychosociopath, who is also a Pizza delivery guy, who is also kinda pathetic in this movie (imho). He met a girl, Riley Lawson, while deliverying a pizza and decided she is ""his Kim"" (don't ask, I don't even know since that never seems to be explained quite clearly in  the movie at all) . Anyhoo, Otis kidnapped Riley in broad daylight, I don't know how Reed (her younger brother) can't even hear her screaming for help at the moment.

Then the whole weird ordeal started.

Otis is playing role games with Riley during her whole isolation time and her parents have to deal with a dufus sad excuse of FBI agent called HotchKiss. Honestl, he doesn't look professional but hey I let that slide since this is a comedy thriller genre to begin with. The movie goes on weirder and weird at each minute but I must admit, I love a crooked sense of humor in movies I watch.

Ok, Overall. The movie is interesting. Not for hardcore Thriller fans cause this would make you throw a rotton tomato or two at the screen. The characters are pretty much quirky in their own way. the scenes are though set for the thriller scenes throughout the show.

My reaction: lots of eye raising action from me while watching it. Though it was a fun movie, enough to rewatch for few more times.",1248048000,,1473,4.357664233576642
3147393,3,B0015U0QWG,"I'd read so many favorable reviews of OTIS that I was prepared to enjoy a nice, twisted black comedy--prehaps something along the lines of SHAUN OF THE DEAD or even (dare I hope?) RE-ANIMATOR, but sadly I was doomed to disappointment for OTIS fails to be anything other than mediocre entertainment. All of the elements are there but they simply never come together the way that they whould. There is quite enough fault to go around. The acting is adequate but screams for even broader strokes. Bostin Christopher in the titular role never seems quite certain whether or not his character is mentally challenged or simply a wimp whose brother (Kevin Pollak) abuses him endlessly-- and he leaves us wondering as well.

 The best comedic turns are Daniel Stern and Illeana Douglas as the parents of the teenaged victim and Jere Burns as a very abrasive/incompetent FBI agent respectively, but even they are under written and under played and under utilized until the end of the film. The director Tony Krantz should have given his actors free rein and let them go completely overboard with these characters in order to realize their full comedic potential. Did I like it? I would have enjoyed it more if it had concentrated on the parents and the FBI agent, but that isn't what I got. What I did get was okay. Should you see it? Sure, go ahead, it's your life.

Featuring a stellar cast (including Jere Burns in his typical ""loveable smarmy dirtbag"" role, Daniel Stern as an amazingly convincing suburban dad trying to keep it all together, and-- who is that? Ashley Johnson of Growing Pains?!?!), Otis turns the horror cliche of serial killing maniac on it's head, with darkly hilarious results.  The pacing is excellent, and I was genuinely surprised when the second act of this film began-- a feat in the modern horror era. The bonus materials are excellent as well, and the alternate ending gave me the unique experience of laughing while simultaneously cringing.  Fans of Shaun of the Dead, Fido, Army of Darkness, and the like should not miss this often overlooked gem.",1231459200,,786,5.030769230769231
3147396,3,B0015U0QWG,"Another delightful little indie dread fest.  This is a highly orignal story with outstanding acting from the male lead who plays Otis, and great support from veteran charecter actor Kevin Pollack.  This film is not in any way predictable, and this is one of it's strongest features.  In today's modern horror, it is very seldom that an original flick like this is made.",1231372800,,369,4.825396825396825
3147397,4,B0015U0QWG,"Question: What do you get when you take Wes Craven's original THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972), add a sitcom-like case of mistaken identity, and then mix in lots of seriocomic dialogue? Answer: Tony Krantz's OTIS, the story of a family who chooses to bypass the police system and instead privately mete out punishment to the middle-aged nerd who abducted their daughter and forced her to act out his unfulfilled high-school fantasies.  Now, I know what you're thinking. You're saying to yourself, ""Oh, no! It's another cinematic study of just how low normal people can sink in the name of revenge!""  But you're only partially right.  OTIS is a revenge thriller, true, but it actually manages to turn the subgenre's conventions on their ear.  When the avenging family members in this flick sink to depths even deeper than their nemesis, they get a bit haughty and careless...and that's when things get really twisted.

Aside from the upturned cliches, OTIS also rises above the standard revenge thriller because the cast turns in some outstanding performances.  At the top of the list is actor Jere Burns, veteran of numerous films and TV shows who is probably best known for his role as lounge lizard Kirk in the late-1980s sitcom DEAR JOHN.  Here Burns is knee-slappingly hilarious playing the smarmy, egocentric, and tactless FBI agent investigating the abduction.  As the titular Otis, Bostin Christopher paints a very convincing portrait of a hapless outcast who has marinated in his own insecurities for so long that he's turned into a homicidal sociopath.  Other notable turns come from Kevin Pollak (from 1992's A FEW GOOD MEN), who delivers a strong but appropriately restrained performance as Otis' abusive older brother; Daniel Stern (1990's HOME ALONE and the uncredited narrator on TV's THE WONDER YEARS) in a hilarious performance as the milquetoast father of the abducted girl; Illeana Douglas (1990's GOODFELLAS and 1999's STIR OF ECHOES) as the ball-busting mother who instigates the plan of vengeance; and Jared Kusnitz (2008's DANCE OF THE DEAD), who is both witty and convincing as the rebellious but caring brother of the abducted girl.

Now, in spite of all that is good about OTIS, the film also has a few weaknesses, the first and foremost of which are plausibility issues.  Unlike her counterpart in other revenge thrillers, the abducted girl in this film comes out of the ordeal relatively unscathed, making it difficult for the audience to suspend disbelief and accept that the girl's fairly mainstream middle-class family would engage in such brutal acts of revenge. Secondly, the film is totally lacking in the nudity department.  Considering the nature of his crimes and his motivation for committing them, the eponymous Otis would undoubtedly force his prey to disrobe on occasion.  Since most contemporary horror films and thrillers that are aimed at adult audiences contain a few T&A shots, there is a certain expectation for such on the part of viewers, and the lack of skin in OTIS is therefore a glaring omission.  And finally, after all the violence and folly, the film's relatively tame denouement is anticlimactic and ultimately unsatisfying.

Still, in spite of its shortcomings, OTIS is a well-made, well-acted black comedy that successfully turns the clich&eacute;d revenge thriller on its head.  The DVD and Blu-ray discs from Warner present the unrated version of the film in anamorphic widescreen, and the picture and sound (at least on the Blu-ray) are breathtaking.  Unfortunately, both discs are no-frills and are therefore devoid of bonus material, but amazon.com's price of admission is nonetheless very reasonable.  This one is a must-have for fans of contemporary horror and thrillers.",1229558400,,3737,5.158940397350993
3147398,5,B0015U0QWG,"This film will repel most every viewer. The taboo topic, the ear-bleedingly offensive language, the unrelenting gore, the sight of lovable actors ""behaving badly.""

(I'm telling you, right now, this may be a complete waste of money for you ... I'm sensing that you might cash in your stocks, invest in steamroller, and obliterate this disk. Just a guess.) This is one really, really sick film ... and I just loved it.

The movie's namesake, Otis, is not so much a paedophile as he is a forty-year-old man trapped in his senior-year of high-school. Over and over, he relives the days preceding his Prom and revels in the glorious event itself (there is a little twist here that I would not dare reveal). Otis' only desire is to find the perfect partner (""Kim"") to reenact it with him. Needless to say, the teenagers he abducts struggle to understand his desires ... and come-undone (LITERALLY!)

Here's the thing: this film is wildly, inappropriately funny. The actors pull-out all the stops!! Jere Burns (of tremendous television fame) plays his role of the careless, perverted FBI agent to a ""T."" He is one of the only men in the world to make laser-pointing and gum-chewing lascivious! Moreover, it's great to see Daniel Stern (""Will Lawson"") in yet another grotesque comedy (if you have not seen Berg's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Very-Bad-Things/dp/B00007ELER/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Very Bad Things</a>, you must!) And Illeana Douglas (""Kate Lawson"") just has an insane talent for this style of work (her role in Koepp's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stir-of-Echoes/dp/B0002DB54A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stir of Echoes</a>&nbsp;has always cracked me up!) BUT, the real shock is seeing Ashley Johnson (""Riley Lawson"") tackle such a challenging role ... quite a departure from her ""precious"" character on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Growing-Pains/dp/B000C6NPHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Growing Pains</a>. As a side note, I must admit that I was most impressed with relative new-comer Jared Kusnitz (""Reed Lawson""). His delivery was as flawless as it was funny. In reality, it's the cast that REALLY makes this film!!

I would LOVE to venture into the details of this film, but out of consideration for the viewers who will really enjoy this piece, I will refrain. I do not want to spoil a single FREAKY moment!

If you think it's a shame to smash yard-gnomes (Otis has a much better purpose for them), if you  think references to Coppola's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse-Now/dp/6305609705/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse Now</a>&nbsp;are a laugh-riot, and if you were just waiting for an inappropriately-appropriate use of Blue Oyster Cult's ""Don't Fear the Reaper,"" (one of the most poorly used songs in horror-history) you are soooo in luck!!

3147400,4,B0015U0QWG,"Otis is the story of a serial rapist/murderer who preys on teenage girls; and the family of the only girl to escape from him.

Not for everyone, much like its main character, who veers back and forth from pitiable to detestable, this movie swings from comedy to torture porn and back. The scenes where Otis forces his attentions on his victim are played straight and are downright uncomfortable to sit through. The scenes where the victim's family goes ""Lord of the Flies"" and takes its revenge are definitely played for laughs, dark laughs, but laughs.

The mood swings are a little jarring and some of the acting is over the top (the FBI agents are all played strictly for laughs and that clashes a little with the tone of the rest of the movie), but all in all the gimmick works. If you like dark comedies this movie should appeal to you, if you are looking for family friendly fare or ""straight"" horror don't even consider seeing it.",1219104000,,937,4.571428571428571
3147401,3,B0015U0QWG,"Last time director Tony Krantz hooked up with Raw Feed (distributor of this film), the end result was a movie entitled Sublime (which ironically enough, was anything but...).  If you saw it, you probably don't remember much about it due to the fact that, if you were lucky you fell asleep early, OR that your mind has buried the near 2 hours of dull, over polished, metaphysical dreck that it was with other overly awful moments from the genre (i.e. Blair Witch 2, Anaconda, and nearly every Japanese horror remake).  Well, with some surprise I bring you good news as far as Otis is concerned... it doesn't suck!  In fact, it's good enough that I'm even kinda looking forward to this guys next movie... huh, how's that for a nice twist?  Otis is the story of a hulking and demented 40 year old pizza delivery guy looking for love (and more importantly, a prom date)-- in any unsuspecting neighborhod windows that allow easy access.  Unfortunately for Otis though, he didn't expect his next victims family to be willing to do whatever it takes to exact their vengeance... hijinx ensue!  No really, they do this time!  You see, this is a horror/comedy (I probably should have made note of that earlier but...)and while it's never disturbing or scary, it does get a lot of the humor right, which makes for a fun watch (if only one).  Of course, the obvious flipside of this is that it's a pretty light and fluffy affair... unlike the great exploitative horror/revenge films that it imitates, you won't be left feeling dirty and ashamed at all by the end of this (in fact, the most depraved thing you see is a girl get punched in the face).  Still though, it's a horror/comedy that actually works, plus it has a fantastic cast (David Pollak in particular)... great film to watch with the significant other who ""isn't normally into these type of movies.""",1217894400,3,1849,4.664615384615384

By the end of the film, I was so disgusted that I felt the need to warn people.  Apparently a lot of people like it though.  I don't know why, but I guess there are a lot of people out there with poor tastes.  Or at least a taste that doesn't require much to entertain them.",1217376000,2,589,4.15929203539823
3147403,5,B0015U0QWG,"There's nothing quite like family bonding is there??
Especially when it's over someone whose bound, gagged, and beaten.
Afterall, the family that violently interrogates would-be murderers together,
stays together.

""Otis"" is 1 twisted teaspoon of ""Captivity""
mixed with 2 hysterical cups of ""Last House on the Left""
Here's the skinny:
A lonely madman kidnaps a local girl and keeps her captive in his basement,
all while preparing her for his bizarro, makeshift prom.
Her distraught family however, has plans to crash said prom
with blood-thirsty, vengeful intentions....and of course power-tools!!

Every character was unforgettable!!!
The star-studded cast really made the most of their parts.
(Kevin Pollack, Daniel Stern,
the gorgeous Ileyana Dougals & the angelic Ashley Johnson)
Every character was lovably quirky & outrageously phenominal!!!
Each one a little more over-the-top than the last,
but the whole movie was more than a little over-the-top,
so it's seems fitting.
Jere Burns as the FBI investigator proves this point in spades.
He was soooooo silly with his ridiculous laser pointer,
I actually felt compelled to go out and buy one myself!!!
Daniel Stern had me rolling once the violence started,
his regression into a bumbling, hilarious wreck was undeniably excellent!!
I love Iylana Douglas,
Everytime I see her on the screen I feel like a silly, love-struck teenager.
She was awesome .....as always!!
And Kevin Pollack was downright amazing!!!
He wasn't even trying to be funny,
and yet he was had me in puddles of mirthful tears.
I'm under the impression he can assume any role on the planet.

My hat goes off to Tony Krantz & Eric Jendressen,
(the writer/director team behind the Twilight-Zone-esque masterpiece ""Sublime"")
The plot was as dementedly hysterical as a stand-up comedian with one leg,
and the direction was as tight as sardines in spandex.
The scene where the family was standing around covered in blood,
brave-heart-style,
is a neo-classic, and one for the books.

I thought it was great and would highly recommend it.
Especially If you liked:
""Last House on the Left"",
""House Arrest"", (yeah why not)
""Captivity"",
""The Cottage"",
""Bothched"",
""Behind the Mask"",
""Shaun of the Dead"", or
""Severance""
I would seriously pick this film up like tomorrow if I were you.

Since you've probably already read what the movie is about let me just add that this is a well acted and ORIGINAL (imagine that!) film. I don't believe this could ever be made in Hollywood it's just too good.

If you like dark humour. If you are tired of typical American films with losers like Tom Cruise and other Hollywood superstars shoveling the same old tired, hyped up schlock then you will love this one. I can't give out any spoilers but in this film there is suspense, anger and beautiful retribution (if somewhat spread out). Watch this movie.

3381855,3,B0015U0QWG,"I'm a horror buff in the making, catching up on classics and cults and devouring what's new (with exception of brainless torture porn).

Otis falls prey to a young director (Tony Krantz) having too many ideas for one movie, which takes a top-notch premise and clouds it with bells and whistles.

Otis' character is fleshed-out, sympathetic, and wonderfully acted by Bostin Christopher. I went back and forth between hating and loving him. Also, a bravo to Ashley Johnson (What Women Want and others) for an overall wonderful performance.

Where this movie fails is:
- the score, which is near constant and distracting. I understand to homage it makes, but it should never overlap key dialogue.
- Edits skip from the exquisitely handled basement scenes to the family, which is cut like a sitcom at best and weak kitsch at worst.
- the twist at the end. Not so much a negative as a missed opportunity. Yes, unpredictable. Yes, lots of better opportunities with these great characters.
-Some characters sucked the life out of the film. Jere Burns as Agent Hotchkiss. Yes, he was intended (I hope) to be a caricature for inept and useless cops in a visceral situation beyond what the law could do, but does he always have to be chewing gum? Being insensitive? Overt characters have a purpose, but if you lose the subtley there you have to make it up somewhere else.

Some positives
+ GREAT basement scenes and use of filters
+ original concept in a wash of the same
+ some great characters and relationships
+ Kevin Pollak with the convincing supporting role??? wow.

In short:
Well worth a rental for horror junkies and enthusiasts. You owe it to yourself to see how Otis and Riley play off each other. The ending twist, schizophrenic production and overpowering score confuse an otherwise good film.

Parents: Not too much gore in this movie beyond an intense scene at the end. Nothing above what a mature teen could handle. Some drug references and mild sexual situations and an expected amount of violence.",1213747200,,2006,4.8
3381856,4,B0015U0QWG,"Otis is not a bad movie.  Otis is like The Last House On The Left, only more campy.  All the actors had good chemistry, but what bothered me was Daniel Stern and Kevin Pollak's part.  Stern looks more like Otis than his on screen brother, Pollak.  Other than that, I had myself quite a few laughs and loved what few scenes of violence there were.  This isn't your typical horror movie.  I'm sure it's a few virgin's fantasies, but not a typical horror movie.  3 and a half stars.  Worth the rent.",1213488000,2,496,4.315217391304348
3381857,4,B0015U0QWG,"This is a STRANGE movie.  We saw the trailer for it on ""The Orphanage"" DVD and thought, well that movie looks pretty funny, let's get that.

Short Synopsis: Otis is a hulking pervert who captures teenage girls and takes them home where he fulfills his high school fantasies, forcing them to ""play along.""  Otis got more than he bargained for when he abducts Riley whose family has a collective screw loose to begin with.

This movie was funny in a dark and almost sad way.  Everyone in the film is warped so the only character you can really identify with is Riley... and she doesn't say much.  The scenes between Riley and Otis are by far the most well acted in the film, they are both disturbing and hysterically funny.  Riley's family however never seemed to click, what should have been the funniest scenes in the movie were overacted which seriously drained the humor out of them.  Each character was funny in their own right, but as a unit they never meshed completely.  Still this was a very enjoyable film with much less gore than anticipated, no nudity (sorry boys) but for those of you who don't like profanity, this movie is full of it.  I don't have an issue with profanity in R rated movies... but the profanity in this one feels a bit forced, as if either the actors weren't comfortable using it, or they just couldn't get the rhythm of what they were saying.

Even though the acting was a bit off, this was a really fun movie with quite a few laughs.  I would say its best viewed in a group setting with a couple of beers and popcorn.

Since it's unrated I'll give you my rating synopsis -
Nudity - None, though there is a girl in her underwear.
Sex - None seen, though it is mentioned and alluded to
Violence - I'd give this an R for one particular scene
Profanity - Definite R
Drug use - There is mention of drugs, and you see the son popping pills.",1213228800,31,1866,4.373913043478261
3381858,4,B0015U0QWG,"I caught Otis at the SXSW film festival in Austin, and it was one of the stand out films of the event.

Otis is a serial killer who kidnaps young pretty girls to fulfill his own dreams of what he missed in high school.  Eventually these girls fight back and die.  His latest victim, Riley (the beautiful Ashley Johnson) has a bit more fight than he's used to.  And her family is even more aggressive.

The cast does a great job pulling the story together.  Illena Douglas, who always does a great job, is incredible as the mother who has gone a little crazy.  Ashley Johnson is perfect as Riley.  She has that nice combo of being both hot and yet very sweet at the same time, much like the character she played on CSI.

I think the stand out actor on this is Jared Kusnitz, who I also saw in Dance of the Dead (incredibly good movie).  Somehow the movie gets a little funnier every time he's in a scene.

One note on casting...I couldn't help feeling like Kevin Pollack and Daniel Stern were cast in each others roles as the brother of Otis and the father of Ashley Johnson, repetitively.  They both did a great job, but Daniel Stern looks much more like the brother of Otis than Pollack.  Although I do love the scenes with Stern and Kusnitz.

Otis is a movie best viewed with some friends who enjoy black comedies.  This film's pretty dark, but really enjoyable.",1211846400,15,1364,4.378486055776892

3381888,4,B0015U0QWG,"It seems I have been reviewing a lot of horror movies these days. It's not on purpose. I do like other types of movies, but I keep hearing good things about certain ""never released to the screen"" horror movies that I keep trying them out. Considering my reviews, like for Teeth, you'd think I review them just to blast them. Finally, I have something good to say, after watching the wonderful serial joker, Otis.

  Otis is the story of a forty-something year-old pedophile named Otis(played by new-comer Boston Christopher) who is looking for a date for the prom. He does the right things, asking a girl's parents for permission to date their daughter, rocking out the old school Trans-Am, throwing around the old pig skin, calling the girl on the telephone all the time, and working hard as a pizza delivery boy. The problem is, he does this all after kidnapping the girls and locking them in his basement, torturing them mentally and physically, and usually killing them, accidentally. This has happened five times, the authorities have no clues, and he is continuing his quest for the perfect date for the prom.

  Otis kidnaps one lucky teenager, Riley Lawson (played by Ashley Johnson), but is thwarted by her attempt to actually allow him to work his magic as a supreme catch, all 400 pounds of him. Her family, upon learning of Otis' place of residence, take it upon themselves to unleash vengeance in ways Otis himself could not dream, with disasterous, and funny, results.

  What's great about this movie is how it portrays Otis himself. He is a psychotic pedophile, but through the movie we gain some sympathy for him, even while he is hacking up his latest date that dumped him. It is this sympathy that makes us laugh at ourselves, and the movie itself. This would seem bad, but the movie calls for it hungrily.

  Riley's family is fantastic. Daniel Stern and Illeana Douglas play the part of doting parents wonderfully. They are the stereotypical suburban family, with a Otis Movie Familyloving daughter and a delinquent son. Their try at vengeance plays on this wholesomeness, and makes a movie like Last House on the Left seem pale in comparison, if only for its odd outcome. There is one scene where the family is unloading their truck that is absolutely ridiculous.

  Kevin Pollak plays Otis' naive and abusive brother. Although only a supporting role, the role he plays in the family's vengeance is like nothing I've ever seen before. Think of a battery hooked up to a man's sphincter. If you find that funny, you will love Pollak, again. The FBI agent, played by Jere Burns, fleshes out the hysterics. It is his bumbling police work that makes the rest of the movie work. If he actually had a brain in his head, maybe they would have caught Otis the second time around. I'm sure glad THAT didn't happen.

  This movie was a breath of fresh air for the horror comedy genre. The laughs are as black as night, and it works to make you feel a bit uncomfortable, but still giddy at the same time. The gore factor was a bit lacking, but the elements of imagination, such as drinking your own toes, are ripe. If the gore was there, it would probably lose a lot of its comedic elements.

All in all, I give this movie 4 out of 5 dateless nights. Now let's go to prom in our baby-blue tuxes!

P.S.-The alternate ending is NOT to be missed.",1262044800,,3353,4.631756756756757
3381889,4,B0015U0QWG,"I didn't know what to think of when I first see the title. But as a thriller horror(?) fan, I thought I should just give this movie a chance, and I did. Glad I did though. That was an experience.

Otis is a psychosociopath, who is also a Pizza delivery guy, who is also kinda pathetic in this movie (imho). He met a girl, Riley Lawson, while deliverying a pizza and decided she is ""his Kim"" (don't ask, I don't even know since that never seems to be explained quite clearly in  the movie at all) . Anyhoo, Otis kidnapped Riley in broad daylight, I don't know how Reed (her younger brother) can't even hear her screaming for help at the moment.

Then the whole weird ordeal started.

Otis is playing role games with Riley during her whole isolation time and her parents have to deal with a dufus sad excuse of FBI agent called HotchKiss. Honestl, he doesn't look professional but hey I let that slide since this is a comedy thriller genre to begin with. The movie goes on weirder and weird at each minute but I must admit, I love a crooked sense of humor in movies I watch.

Ok, Overall. The movie is interesting. Not for hardcore Thriller fans cause this would make you throw a rotton tomato or two at the screen. The characters are pretty much quirky in their own way. the scenes are though set for the thriller scenes throughout the show.

RE-ANIMATOR, but sadly I was doomed to disappointment for OTIS fails to be anything other than mediocre entertainment. All of the elements are there but they simply never come together the way that they whould. There is quite enough fault to go around. The acting is adequate but screams for even broader strokes. Bostin Christopher in the titular role never seems quite certain whether or not his character is mentally challenged or simply a wimp whose brother (Kevin Pollak) abuses him endlessly-- and he leaves us wondering as well.

 The best comedic turns are Daniel Stern and Illeana Douglas as the parents of the teenaged victim and Jere Burns as a very abrasive/incompetent FBI agent respectively, but even they are under written and under played and under utilized until the end of the film. The director Tony Krantz should have given his actors free rein and let them go completely overboard with these characters in order to realize their full comedic potential. Did I like it? I would have enjoyed it more if it had concentrated on the parents and the FBI agent, but that isn't what I got. What I did get was okay. Should you see it? Sure, go ahead, it's your life.

The pacing is excellent, and I was genuinely surprised when the second act of this film began-- a feat in the modern horror era.

In today's modern horror, it is very seldom that an original flick like this is made.",1231372800,,369,4.825396825396825
3381894,4,B0015U0QWG,"Question: What do you get when you take Wes Craven's original THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972), add a sitcom-like case of mistaken identity, and then mix in lots of seriocomic dialogue? Answer: Tony Krantz's OTIS, the story of a family who chooses to bypass the police system and instead privately mete out punishment to the middle-aged nerd who abducted their daughter and forced her to act out his unfulfilled high-school fantasies.  Now, I know what you're thinking. You're saying to yourself, ""Oh, no! It's another cinematic study of just how low normal people can sink in the name of revenge!""  But you're only partially right.  OTIS is a revenge thriller, true, but it actually manages to turn the subgenre's conventions on their ear.  When the avenging family members in this flick sink to depths even deeper than their nemesis, they get a bit haughty and careless...and that's when things get really twisted.

Aside from the upturned cliches, OTIS also rises above the standard revenge thriller because the cast turns in some outstanding performances.  At the top of the list is actor Jere Burns, veteran of numerous films and TV shows who is probably best known for his role as lounge lizard Kirk in the late-1980s sitcom DEAR JOHN.  Here Burns is knee-slappingly hilarious playing the smarmy, egocentric, and tactless FBI agent investigating the abduction.  As the titular Otis, Bostin Christopher paints a very convincing portrait of a hapless outcast who has marinated in his own insecurities for so long that he's turned into a homicidal sociopath.  Other notable turns come from Kevin Pollak (from 1992's A FEW GOOD MEN), who delivers a strong but appropriately restrained performance as Otis' abusive older brother; Daniel Stern (1990's HOME ALONE and the uncredited narrator on TV's THE WONDER YEARS) in a hilarious performance as the milquetoast father of the abducted girl; Illeana Douglas (1990's GOODFELLAS and 1999's STIR OF ECHOES) as the ball-busting mother who instigates the plan of vengeance; and Jared Kusnitz (2008's DANCE OF THE DEAD), who is both witty and convincing as the rebellious but caring brother of the abducted girl.

Now, in spite of all that is good about OTIS, the film also has a few weaknesses, the first and foremost of which are plausibility issues.  Unlike her counterpart in other revenge thrillers, the abducted girl in this film comes out of the ordeal relatively unscathed, making it difficult for the audience to suspend disbelief and accept that the girl's fairly mainstream middle-class family would engage in such brutal acts of revenge. Secondly, the film is totally lacking in the nudity department.  Considering the nature of his crimes and his motivation for committing them, the eponymous Otis would undoubtedly force his prey to disrobe on occasion.  Since most contemporary horror films and thrillers that are aimed at adult audiences contain a few T&A shots, there is a certain expectation for such on the part of viewers, and the lack of skin in OTIS is therefore a glaring omission.  And finally, after all the violence and folly, the film's relatively tame denouement is anticlimactic and ultimately unsatisfying.

Still, in spite of its shortcomings, OTIS is a well-made, well-acted black comedy that successfully turns the clich&eacute;d revenge thriller on its head.  The DVD and Blu-ray discs from Warner present the unrated version of the film in anamorphic widescreen, and the picture and sound (at least on the Blu-ray) are breathtaking.  Unfortunately, both discs are no-frills and are therefore devoid of bonus material, but amazon.com's price of admission is nonetheless very reasonable.  This one is a must-have for fans of contemporary horror and thrillers.",1229558400,,3737,5.158940397350993
3381895,5,B0015U0QWG,"This film will repel most every viewer. The taboo topic, the ear-bleedingly offensive language, the unrelenting gore, the sight of lovable actors ""behaving badly."" (Man, you should just leave this page now!) Think of this work as the comedic equivalent of McNaughton's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-Portrait-of-a-Serial-Killer/dp/B0009OUBC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry - Portrait of a Serial Killer</a>. (You don't know Henry? Oh, duuude ... make a run for it ... you have no idea what you're dealing with!) This film's sketchy/creepy/cringe factor is astronomical (even I was tempted to fast-forward through the MAJOR torture scene ... but I wasn't gonna let the film beat me!!). (I'm telling you, right now, this may be a complete waste of money for you ... I'm sensing that you might cash in your stocks, invest in steamroller, and obliterate this disk. Just a guess.) This is one really, really sick film ... and I just loved it.

The movie's namesake, Otis, is not so much a paedophile as he is a forty-year-old man trapped in his senior-year of high-school. Over and over, he relives the days preceding his Prom and revels in the glorious event itself (there is a little twist here that I would not dare reveal). Otis' only desire is to find the perfect partner (""Kim"") to reenact it with him. Needless to say, the teenagers he abducts struggle to understand his desires ... and come-undone (LITERALLY!)

Here's the thing: this film is wildly, inappropriately funny. The actors pull-out all the stops!! Jere Burns (of tremendous television fame) plays his role of the careless, perverted FBI agent to a ""T."" He is one of the only men in the world to make laser-pointing and gum-chewing lascivious! Moreover, it's great to see Daniel Stern (""Will Lawson"") in yet another grotesque comedy (if you have not seen Berg's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Very-Bad-Things/dp/B00007ELER/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Very Bad Things</a>, you must!) And Illeana Douglas (""Kate Lawson"") just has an insane talent for this style of work (her role in Koepp's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stir-of-Echoes/dp/B0002DB54A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stir of Echoes</a>&nbsp;has always cracked me up!) BUT, the real shock is seeing Ashley Johnson (""Riley Lawson"") tackle such a challenging role ... quite a departure from her ""precious"" character on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Growing-Pains/dp/B000C6NPHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Growing Pains</a>. As a side note, I must admit that I was most impressed with relative new-comer Jared Kusnitz (""Reed Lawson""). His delivery was as flawless as it was funny. In reality, it's the cast that REALLY makes this film!!

I would LOVE to venture into the details of this film, but out of consideration for the viewers who will really enjoy this piece, I will refrain. I do not want to spoil a single FREAKY moment!

If you think it's a shame to smash yard-gnomes (Otis has a much better purpose for them), if you  think references to Coppola's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse-Now/dp/6305609705/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse Now</a>&nbsp;are a laugh-riot, and if you were just waiting for an inappropriately-appropriate use of Blue Oyster Cult's ""Don't Fear the Reaper,"" (one of the most poorly used songs in horror-history) you are soooo in luck!!

3381897,4,B0015U0QWG,"Otis is the story of a serial rapist/murderer who preys on teenage girls; and the family of the only girl to escape from him.

Not for everyone, much like its main character, who veers back and forth from pitiable to detestable, this movie swings from comedy to torture porn and back. The scenes where Otis forces his attentions on his victim are played straight and are downright uncomfortable to sit through. The scenes where the victim's family goes ""Lord of the Flies"" and takes its revenge are definitely played for laughs, dark laughs, but laughs.

The mood swings are a little jarring and some of the acting is over the top (the FBI agents are all played strictly for laughs and that clashes a little with the tone of the rest of the movie), but all in all the gimmick works. If you like dark comedies this movie should appeal to you, if you are looking for family friendly fare or ""straight"" horror don't even consider seeing it.",1219104000,,937,4.571428571428571
3381898,3,B0015U0QWG,"Last time director Tony Krantz hooked up with Raw Feed (distributor of this film), the end result was a movie entitled Sublime (which ironically enough, was anything but...).  If you saw it, you probably don't remember much about it due to the fact that, if you were lucky you fell asleep early, OR that your mind has buried the near 2 hours of dull, over polished, metaphysical dreck that it was with other overly awful moments from the genre (i.e. Blair Witch 2, Anaconda, and nearly every Japanese horror remake).  Well, with some surprise I bring you good news as far as Otis is concerned... it doesn't suck!  In fact, it's good enough that I'm even kinda looking forward to this guys next movie... huh, how's that for a nice twist?  Otis is the story of a hulking and demented 40 year old pizza delivery guy looking for love (and more importantly, a prom date)-- in any unsuspecting neighborhod windows that allow easy access.  Unfortunately for Otis though, he didn't expect his next victims family to be willing to do whatever it takes to exact their vengeance... hijinx ensue!  No really, they do this time!  You see, this is a horror/comedy (I probably should have made note of that earlier but...)and while it's never disturbing or scary, it does get a lot of the humor right, which makes for a fun watch (if only one).  Of course, the obvious flipside of this is that it's a pretty light and fluffy affair... unlike the great exploitative horror/revenge films that it imitates, you won't be left feeling dirty and ashamed at all by the end of this (in fact, the most depraved thing you see is a girl get punched in the face).  Still though, it's a horror/comedy that actually works, plus it has a fantastic cast (David Pollak in particular)... great film to watch with the significant other who ""isn't normally into these type of movies.""",1217894400,3,1849,4.664615384615384
3381899,2,B0015U0QWG,"This movie tried very hard to be a clever dark comedy, but they wound up making a mess.  The ending (or rather the last 30 min) was horrible.  For sitting through such an atrocity, you'd think they could at least give me something to make up for it, but they didn't.  Very derivative and with horrendous dialogue.  By the end of the film, I was so disgusted that I felt the need to warn people.  Apparently a lot of people like it though.  I don't know why, but I guess there are a lot of people out there with poor tastes.  Or at least a taste that doesn't require much to entertain them.",1217376000,2,589,4.15929203539823

Especially when it's over someone whose bound, gagged, and beaten.
Afterall, the family that violently interrogates would-be murderers together,
stays together.

""Otis"" is 1 twisted teaspoon of ""Captivity""
mixed with 2 hysterical cups of ""Last House on the Left""
Here's the skinny:
A lonely madman kidnaps a local girl and keeps her captive in his basement,
all while preparing her for his bizarro, makeshift prom.
Her distraught family however, has plans to crash said prom
with blood-thirsty, vengeful intentions....and of course power-tools!!

Every character was unforgettable!!!
The star-studded cast really made the most of their parts.
(Kevin Pollack, Daniel Stern,
the gorgeous Ileyana Dougals & the angelic Ashley Johnson)
Every character was lovably quirky & outrageously phenominal!!!
Each one a little more over-the-top than the last,
but the whole movie was more than a little over-the-top,
so it's seems fitting.
Jere Burns as the FBI investigator proves this point in spades.
He was soooooo silly with his ridiculous laser pointer,
I actually felt compelled to go out and buy one myself!!!
Daniel Stern had me rolling once the violence started,
his regression into a bumbling, hilarious wreck was undeniably excellent!!
I love Iylana Douglas,
Everytime I see her on the screen I feel like a silly, love-struck teenager.
She was awesome .....as always!!
And Kevin Pollack was downright amazing!!!
He wasn't even trying to be funny,
and yet he was had me in puddles of mirthful tears.
I'm under the impression he can assume any role on the planet.

My hat goes off to Tony Krantz & Eric Jendressen,
(the writer/director team behind the Twilight-Zone-esque masterpiece ""Sublime"")
The plot was as dementedly hysterical as a stand-up comedian with one leg,
and the direction was as tight as sardines in spandex.
The scene where the family was standing around covered in blood,
brave-heart-style,
is a neo-classic, and one for the books.

I thought it was great and would highly recommend it.
Especially If you liked:
""Last House on the Left"",
""House Arrest"", (yeah why not)
""Captivity"",
""The Cottage"",
""Bothched"",
""Behind the Mask"",
""Shaun of the Dead"", or
""Severance""
I would seriously pick this film up like tomorrow if I were you.
