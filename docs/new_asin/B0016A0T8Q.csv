8261848,3,B0016A0T8Q,"I purchased this for a children's program that I was leading about Bible Animals.  The video was probably meant for an adult audience and I wasn't sure how the children, ages 6 through 12 would respond to it.  They actually  liked it (I served popcorn and they sat on the floor, were allowed to talk....)  and responded appropriately  with intermittent OOHHS and AAHHHS.  It was a bit dry and long, but we thought the children had more focus then they did in the past with a kids-type of video with cartoon characters.",1414886400,,518,4.576086956521739
8261849,3,B0016A0T8Q,"If you like animals, this is a great connection between the Bible and animals/creation.  If you are not a big animal lover, it can get kind of long.  Used it as a way to keep kid's attentions at the beginning of a church event, and it served that purpose well.",1391817600,,260,4.18

The pace was quick enough to capture the attention of small children, the content deep enough to stir the thought of grown Christians. It was marvellous. Bravo, Munger! And I saw by the credits that it was a family effort, making it all the more significant. Thank you so much for a great faith builder! Blessings to you and your company. Joan H. Richardson

8261851,4,B0016A0T8Q,"The Mungers have hit this one out of the park - looking to make a PBS-style nature program extolling their faith-based worldview, Animals in the Bible presents a series of vignettes skillfully narrated in old-school fashion that simply ""proclaim the glory of God through His creation"" as seen through the eyes of the Mungers.

Technically polished, this short work (some 30 minutes) moves briskly but not hurriedly, using a collection of stock and original footage (moving and still) and original music to look at various animals to make various points. There's an occasional factual hiccup and the need to score theologically correct points sometimes overshadows the ride, but by and large it holds attention and makes the case it wants to.

Seemingly aimed at a younger audience, Animals in the Bible isn't likely to convert the hardened skeptic but it is a great tool for reinforcing a particular perspective that many find wanting; buy one for your young Sunday School class today if you want to support a prime example of current ""outside Hollywood"" DVD-making at its finest!",1213228800,7,1080,5.061797752808989
