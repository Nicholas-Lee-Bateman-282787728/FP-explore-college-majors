8273514,1,B0019D38M4,This DVD sucks. Music plays in the background when they race (mostly low end imports. IE Honda and Nissan) The camera work is down right bad. I think there was 1 race when the cars may have gotten over 80 mph. Don't waste your money. Go with 1320 DVDs or something else. This was an absolute joke.,1357689600,,297,4.228070175438597
