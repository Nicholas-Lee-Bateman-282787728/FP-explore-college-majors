Due to a surgery that put my Yoga on hold, I didn't find this out for a long time after the purchase.",1474934400,,279,3.793103448275862
8710415,5,B00VKP07NO,"This is one of my favorite seasons and favorite parts of the Namaste Yoga dvds.  This set of yoga DVDs are beautiful and relaxing. I'm a bit of a beginner when it comes to yoga. I have done Bikram yoga many times at different studios, but have only recently started doing yoga at home and these videos are wonderful. They are very well made, have beautiful scenery, which may sound odd for a yoga video, but it makes it easy and fun to follow. Each episode/video is not all located in the same place, it changes different scenery throughout each one, so they definitely aren't boring to watch and follow.  I received this season as a gift and I really like it. Highly recommend!",1459209600,,678,4.459677419354839
8710416,5,B00VKP07NO,"I absolutely love this yoga series. I've done yoga for many years, my first ones were on VHS tape, pre-DVD. I'd had dozens of them over the years, searching for just the right one. THIS is the right one. It's done beautifully. The camera angles allow you to see how to do each step. They move smoothly. The work out at every level is excellent. The scenery is calming. Even the voice of the narrator is absolutely perfect. If you've had a dozen or so yoga DVDs, then you know that the voice of the narrator can be annoying and make you not want to listen to it This narrator - whom I believe to be Kate Potter herself - is truly enjoyable, soothing and right in keeping with the gentle, healing nature of yoga.",1455408000,2,710,4.266666666666667
