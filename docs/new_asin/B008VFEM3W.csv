This video series shows the progression of this event from grass roots to the amazing festivity that it is now. 60,000 spectators came out last year to see the event first hand but these videos show you what makes them come out.

Dave Cole and the Hammerking Productions guys swing 2 helicopters all week with video cameras rolling the whole time not to mention the hundred or so terrestrial cameras of Hammerking and the international press and race teams or the thousands of spectators shooting their own personal experiences.

This video is 168 hours of event wrapped into an hour or so of action packed excitement!",1427932800,,672,4.826086956521739

8530874,5,B008VFEM3W,"I'm a Jeep geek and the production quality of this documentary of the KoH is fantastic! If you've ever watched any Wayalife or Project-JK clips on YouTube, this is similar -- very cool stuff. I've watched it 3x so far in a month. Does the cover art give away the winner, though? Hmmmm... you find out yourself :)",1370390400,,312,4.396551724137931
8530875,5,B008VFEM3W,"The race itself is amazing and there are plenty of good stories to tell, amazing scenery to shoot and crazy rigs to show. What really impressed me, though, was the production quality of this video. The cinematography is excellent, the picture is awesome HD and the sound is mixed well. The narration is a little heavy handed, but there is in fact plenty of drama, so it fits well.

I definitely recommend this vid to anyone who is a fan of desert racing or rock crawling. It's one of the best I've seen.",1364774400,,503,4.408602150537634
