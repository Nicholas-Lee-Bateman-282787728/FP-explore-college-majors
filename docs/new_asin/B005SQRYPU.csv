4886051,5,B005SQRYPU,"One of the best and most fun PPVs ever I have ever watched. WWE strikes gold here! The WWE gives us a very nice and early Christmas present with TLC 2011! One worth watching over and over again!

All Matches:
1.[US TITLE]DOLPH ZIGGLER VS ZACH RYDER: A great opening match and very well evened out. 4/5
2.[TAG TEAM TITLE]AIR BOOM VS PRIMO & EPICO: Ah! Just about any match w/Air Boom is fun. 3/5
3.[TABLES MATCH]WADE BARRETT VS RANDY ORTON: A rivalry now leads them onto fun with tables! A good fight from start to finish! 4/5
4.[DIVAS TITLE]BETH PHOENIX VS KELLY KELLY: Just your regular one on one divas match. 1/5
5.[SLEDGEHAMMER-LADDER MATCH]KEVIN NASH VS TRIPLE H: Finally Nash gets his revenge match starting with HHH. It seemed even made for HHH's advantage w/his signature weapon legal, but him having to fight Nash in his worst match known. It was an alright fight back and fowards action. 4/5
6. SHEAMUS VS JACK SWAGGER: A random added match, but turned out to be somewhat alright. 3/5

9.[WWE TITLE TLC MATCH]CM PUNK VS ALBERTO DEL RIO VS THE MIZ: Finally, the legendary TLC match is reborn in this Triple Trhreat! Up for grabs, CM Punk's title with both Alberto Del Rio and The Miz ready to try to reclaim what they once held. Lots of weapons used, high-risks, and classic crash and burns. Just a superb match and easily the best one of the night! 5/5",1354665600,,1603,4.565972222222222
4886052,4,B005SQRYPU,"This is a very good WWE ppv from 2011. With CM Punk in the Main Event defending his WWE Heavyweight Title against Alberto Del Rio and The Miz in a TLC match that deserved the main event spot it was given. And with Daniel Bryan and Zack Ryder breaking through that glass ceiling, WWE saw a very good send off on ppv in 2011.

Ziggler and Zack Ryder start off the show with a nice back and forth US Championship match that sees Ryder take his spot! Randy Orton barely escapes Mr. Barrett with a counter that has to be seen, and shows that the RKO can come from anywhere. Kevin Nash's appearance...didn't totally blow...guess that counts...wait, that's cuz HHH is in the match >.>

The TLC match is a great back and forth contest with a good use of weapons thrown in throughout the match. All 3 men shine, and it's a really exciting match. But Punk's star shinned brightest in some inventive spots involving cuffs.

But the best part of the night besides ZERO cena? Daniel Bryan Cashin in that MITB!

Great ppv, and for a great price right now. This one is right up there with Money in The Bank and Summerslam, both from 2011.",1345593600,,1123,4.384615384615385

4886054,4,B005SQRYPU,"Just finished watching TLC 2011 so here's my thoughts.

Zack Ryder vs. Dolph Ziggler - US Title - Dolph Ziggler always has great matches, espescially when he opens a ppv. A ppv always seems to go very well whenever he opens, and this is no exception. Great wrestling matchup, and I dig Zack Ryder too. And it's great to see him finally win a singles title. 4/5

Air Boom vs. Primo/Epico - WWE Tag Team Title - It's good to see air boom (since it looks like its going to be short lived. But this match isn't really anything special 2/5

Beth Phoenix vs. Kelly Kelly - Divas Title - Another crappy divas match, they even messed up on a few spots during the match, these two actually have had good matches between each other, but this isn't one of them 1/5

Cody Rhodes vs. Booker T - WWE Intercontinental Title - It's great to see Booker T back in the ring against a talented wrestler like Cody Rhodes, definetly not the best match either of these guys have had but it's not bad either. 2/5

Triple H vs. Kevin Nash - Stairway to Hell Match - (A ladder match with a weapon on a top is known by ECW as a Stairway to Hell Match, so I'm calling it that) This was actually a very violent match, granted we can't have blood in WWE but despite that this was a violent match and I can't say anything really bad about it. There was one spot where Nash got hit in the head with the hammer while they were on top of the ladder that looked kinda ridiculous but other than that, great match. 4/5

Sheamus vs. Jack Swagger - Random bonus match, always good to get a bonus but nothing special 2/5

Theodore Long dressed as santa and even gave the now talking Hornswoggle a Christmas gift, it's funny that he Hornswoggle never really talked and now that he does he is hilarious to listen to.

Mark Henry vs. Big Show - World Title Chairs Match - This isn't a wrestling classic like they've had over the last few ppvs, this is hardcore! Steel chairs galore! Chairs completely fill the ring and they just went at it, it's a little short but nonetheless enjoyable. And then Daniel Bryan goes in a cashes in his MITB briefcase. 2/5

Randy Orton vs. Wade Barrett - Tables Match - This match made it into WWE's top 25 of 2011, but I don't really know why. It's a good match, but idk why it'd be worth going into the top 25. 3/5

CM Punk vs. The Miz vs. Alberto Del Rio - WWE Title 3-Way TLC Match - Although WWE has made changes over the last few years this is one that has stayed the same. TLC, carnage, carnage, and freaking carnage! While there's no storyline for this match, and the only reason it's a TLC match is because of the PPV gimmick, but it was a great match that is insanity from start to finish. 5/5

All in all a good ppv, there's glitches here and there but it's having.",1329696000,,2764,4.215909090909091

4886056,4,B005SQRYPU,"WWE TLC 2011

1.[US TITLE]DOLPH ZIGGLER VS ZACH RYDER-the opening match of the night would see the US title on the line with Ryder getting another chance. Like every other opening match with Dolph this one was really good. I really believe that he is a future champion since he delivers in these matches all of the time. This match is really good with a lot of back and forth action with Dolph looking a bit stronger. But that only helps set up the comeback for Ryder. After Vickie helps Dolph get his foot on the rope she is forced to leave. Not too long after Ryder makes his big comeback and takes the title, and celebrates with his father.

2.[TAG TEAM TITLE]AIR BOOM VS PRIMO & EPICO-next up we have the tag title match in which Air Boom would continue their reign. This would end up being a good match but a typical one, which isn't bad. Like other reviews of this event have said it follows the usual formula. It starts out fast paced and back and forth only to have the heels take it to Evan. That of course leads to Kofi eventually getting that big tag that Evan was trying forever to get. From there it is not to long until the face's win.

3.[TABLES MATCH]WADE BARRETT VS RANDY ORTON-now I was looking forward to this match since I am a Barrett fan. For the majority of this match it looked as if it were going to go my way. Barrett really took it to Randy here. Randy would get in some offense at points but for the most part Wade really brings it here. Still in the end a predictable RKO happens and Randy wins, the wrong guy won in my opinion.

4.[DIVAS TITLE]BETH PHOENIX VS KELLY KELLY-here we have another match between these two ladies, it seems it is always these two. Thankfully Beth is in these matches but I will admit Kelly has been getting better. This plays out like some of their other matches and ends up being another good one. Beth ends up keeping the belt thankfully.

5.[LADDER MATCH]KEVIN NASH VS TRIPLE H-I was all about this match since I am a fan of both guys and knew I would enjoy it. Still I have to say that this match was much better than I thought it would be. The no DQ style match really helped these guys out here. The action is more of a brawling style with both guys just throwing down the whole time. Tables and everything else come into play here with Nash seeming like the aggressor for most of the match. Triple H eventually would get the sledgehammer and use it to help get the win.

6. SHEAMUS VS JACK SWAGGER-this was a much better match then it gets credit for in my opinion. It is not a classic but it is a good match. The match features more high impact moves with Swagger getting the advantage with Vickie at his side. Still Sheamus is a beast and comes back to administer his own punishment. In the end a big kick seals the deal and Sheamus goes home with the W.

7.[WORLD TITLE  CHAIRS MATCH]MARK HENRY VS BIG SHOW-these two have had some interesting match-ups and this would prove to be the same. Although it is a short match it was still entertaining. Show takes it to Henry early only to injure his hand. This of course all happens after an interesting beginning. Henry seems to be the more violent of the two when using the chairs but he still gets laid out by Show. Show wins the world title after something like 9 years, but it is short lived thanks to Henry. Afterwards Daniel Bryan cashes in his MITB briefcase and wins the title, I personally thought he was going to wait for Mania.

8.[I-C TITLE]CODY RHODES VS BOOKER T-of course we all know what happened here, Booker was wanting Cody to show him respect so he came back on this night for another match. Earlier that night Cody attacked Booker and it would show in the match later on. Booker starts out really strong taking it to Cody early and looks good doing it. Cody of course still finds ways to turn the tide in his favor as it looks as if the earlier attacks are taking their toll on Booker. Eventually Booker succumbs to his injuries and looses in a pretty good contest.

9.[WWE TITLE TLC MATCH]CM PUNK VS ALBERTO DEL RIO VS THE MIZ-the match of the night without a doubt. Three of my favorites go at it in this match and they put on a great show. This match was full of all kinds of high spots from people going through tables to chair shots galore. The ladders being used for all kinds of punishment which only adds to the excitement. The way these three play off each other is great and Ricardo takes a huge spill. In the end CM Punk keeps the belt but it was a hard fought and entertaining main event.",1327536000,5,4533,4.297423887587822
4886057,5,B005SQRYPU,i was actually here live and i have too say it was a great ppv the only reason im purchasing this dvd is because i was there,1327276800,2,124,3.6296296296296298
4886058,4,B005SQRYPU,"United States Champion Dolph Ziggler vs. Zack Ryder - After weeks of campaigning (including a Twitter petition) & John Cena giving up his spot on the PPV, Ryder got another opportunity at the U.S. title with the crowd heavily behind him right from the start. The action went back & forth early with Dolph eventually gaining the advantage with a DDT on the apron followed by repeatedly dropping elbows while showing off to the crowd doing such things as push ups in the middle of the match. Ryder was able to make a comeback with moves like a missile dropkick as both men were making close nearfalls before Vickie tried to get involved to save Dolph only for that to end up backfiring on her. This was a real good opening match that had the right result & a nice feel good moment afterwords with the champion celebrating with his father in the crowd.

Tag Team Champions Air Boom vs. Primo & Epico - This was a bonus match & for those who don't already know, Primo (& Epico are cousins & managed by Rosa Mendez who was looking so attractive that Lawler was more concentrated on her than the match itself on commentary. Kofi started off hot including doing a double dropkick on both cousins hitting each one with one leg before Epico & Primo focused on Bourne & worked him over including one german suplex that landed him right on his head. This followed the usual formula of the heels working over one babyface building up to the hot tag to the other making the match solid but nothing memorable.

Tables Match: Randy Orton vs. Wade Barrett - The table came into play early here as Orton went to grab it on the outside only for Barrett to kick it through the ropes hitting him in the forehead only for Orton to retaliate by pushing the table onto Barrett's nose followed by slamming his head on the steps. At one point Orton attempted a suplex off the apron only for Barrett to counter by throwing Orton into the post & falling to the floor hitting the steps on the way down. Barrett had various attempts to put Orton through a table such as laying him on a table on the outside but Orton moving off before Wade could do the top rope dive, attempting to kick him off the apron through a table but Orton's leg & arm getting caught on the ropes, and Wasteland attempt off the apron through a table. Both men wrestled a very physical match here with Barrett coming out looking strong & dominate in this match with the story of the match being ""he didn't get beat, he got caught.""

Divas Champion Beth Phoenix vs. Kelly Kelly - This was another bonus match based off the fact that earlier in the week at the Slammy Awards, Beth was upset that Kelly Kelly won the Divalicious award. Beth tried to intimidate Kelly by daring her to slap her which Kelly did to the the offense using her legs to her advantage for moves like a head scissors & the tarantula leg choke. Beth used her power to her advantage by lifting Kelly in a corner only to just drop her on the turnbuckle followed by choking her on the ropes & doing a camel clutch submission. They had a nice sequence towards the end with Beth missing a sit-out off the top rope & Kelly on the receiving end of an electric chair toss. Both girls attempted to work hard here & it payed off in a good match.

Ladder Match: Triple H vs. Kevin Nash - Both men started trading fist & brawling from the start before the ladders came into play with Nash taking the first shot ramming the ladder into HHH's neck on the outside before he retaliated with a clothesline off the announce table & knocked Nash over the barricade. Back in the ring, Triple H worked over Nash's knees by using the ladder on his knees constantly including applying a figure four with Nash's knees trapped in a ladder. Nash was able to come back & use the ladder as a weapon including irish whipping Triple H hard into the ladder in the corner & also executing his ""vintage"" sideslam into the ladder before the fight went to the floor with Nash attempting to powerbomb Triple H through the announce table only for Triple H to counter with a backdrop onto the table. With additional weapons being brought into the match such as the sledgehammer & a table, this wasn't your typical ladder match as it was more like a ""No Disqualification"" fight with them using ladders instead of chairs & other weapons but this was the best route to go since we know both Triple H & Kevin Nash can't give us the type of match that measures up to the standards set for a ladder match at this point in their careers.

Sheamus vs. Jack Swagger - Another bonus match here setup based off a backstage skit earlier in the night. Sheamus beat down Swagger & was dominate until Vickie distracted him allowing Swagger to get the advantage on the floor. Swagger continued to beat on Sheamus & talked down to him until Sheamus ended up losing his temper but Swagger stayed focused on Sheamus' knee with various clips to the back of his leg & did a Swagger Bomb elbow drop onto his leg but he ""went to the well"" one too many times allowing Sheamus to catch him with the kick for the win. Average match.

Chairs Match: World Champion Mark Henry vs. Big Show - With all the ""gimmick"" matches on this PPV, this one was the most appropriate seeing how both men injured each other with the assistance of a chair dating all the way back to July. Show started throwing each chair around ringside into the ring right away as Henry tried to walk away from the fight only for Show to use the chair first. Henry came back with a chairshot of his own & went right after Show's hand by slamming it on the steps hurting Show's hand. Show was now at a disadvantage & it showed when they had a dueling chairs battle only for Show to drop his chair because of the pain & later going for a chokeslam only for Henry to easily slap the arm away. Henry used the chair to his advantage & stomped on Show's hand but Show was able to get one big punch in to knockout Henry & have Big Show win the World Championship...however that wasn't the big story here was what happened afterwords between Henry & Show opened the door allowing another World Title change that resulted in the impossible...Michael Cole speechless. The chairs match itself wasn't much past a few chairshots but this was clearly only here to setup the aftermath allowing the top two champions having a ""Ring Of Honor.""

Intercontinental Champion Cody Rhodes vs. Booker T - Cody Rhodes attacked Booker T twice earlier in the night causing Booker to take the fight to Cody right away only for Cody to get the advantage hanging Booker on the ropes & ramming him into the barricade. Both men went back & forth here but the story clearly was that the effects of the previous attacks were getting to Booker as the match went on to the point where he couldn't finish the spinaroonie at one point leaving Cody open to take advantage of the situation. They told a good story but the match itself wasn't much past that.

T.L.C. Match: WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. The Miz - With both challengers having their issues with Punk, he was the odd man out as both Del Rio & Miz worked over Punk but as soon saw as both men went to get a ladder on the outside that neither guy trusted each other as they didn't take their eyes off each other. Plenty of spots & moments throughout this match as expected such as Punk's suicide dive onto Del Rio who was holding a ladder, Miz countering Punk's running bulldog into a side suplex onto a chair, Miz backdropped onto a ladder & later having his back punished with a chair, C.M. Punk handcuffed...twice, Del Rio facedropped into the ladder, what started as an attempted superplex ending with someone going through a table on the outside, Miz being assaulted with ladders & chairs, Del Rio using ladders & chairs to apply the crossarm breaker, Ricardo Rodriguez taking the biggest bump in the match, and a three way climb towards the top at the end. This was a very physical match with everyone (including Ricardo) taking some big bumps along with the various ways they used all the weapons in the match.

In the end, this is one of those PPV's that didn't have a bad match on here but most of the card was a mixed bag from some matches that weren't anything special (Sheamus/Swagger & Tag Titles), did it's job getting the story & talent involved over (Barrett/Orton & Rhodes/Booker), some that were good for what they were (Ladder & Divas), and some that stood out either for the ""feel good"" moment (the World & U.S. Title matches) or the quality of the match itself (T.L.C.). In the end though, I enjoyed the event overall & it's one I would check out at least for a rental or if you have a few bucks you won't miss.",1324944000,,8687,4.414223331253899
4886059,5,B005SQRYPU,"On the 5th day of christmas 2011 Im going to review...WWE TLC 2011. The US Title match between Zack Ryder & Dolph Ziggler was a solid & hard-hitting bout and Zack's title win send his fans home happy. The Tag Team title match between Air Boom(Evan Bourne & Kofi Kingston) & the team of Primo & Epico had great high-flying action & good double team moves from both teams. The Tables match between Randy Orton & Wade Barrett had great wrestling with great suspense and a great ending too. The Divas title match between Beth Phoenix & Kelly Kelly had great back-and-forth action with pretty good moves. The Sledgehammer/Ladder match between Triple H & Kevin Nash was pretty much a brawl but a good brawl none the less. The Bonus match between Sheamus & Jack Swagger was not great but pretty good. The Chairs match for the Worlds title between Mark Henry & The Big Show was also not great & too short but pretty good. The IC title match between Booker T & Cody Rhodes had pretty good back-and-forth action and a good reminder of Booker's days in WCW. The 3 way TLC match for the WWE title(CM Punk vs. The Miz vs. Alberto Del Rio) was a hardcore,entertaining & smash-mouth brawl. The biggest highlight of the card was 3 words: NO JOHN CENA!!!! I give this PPV a 9 out of 10. PS: smart move on Daniel Bryan for cashing in the MITB contract on Big Show after his match.",1324166400,10,1362,4.408730158730159
