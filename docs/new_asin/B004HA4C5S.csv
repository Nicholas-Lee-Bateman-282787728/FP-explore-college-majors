8429419,3,B004HA4C5S,"Overall the movie is pretty good.  Definitely a family film.  The only downside to the movie is the whole English part is awful.  The acting, the dialogue, it's really bad.  The way the story is done, it really wasn't necessary.  They could have done most of it as a quick voice over at the beginning and maybe a little in the middle and end.

I was a little confused at the way the story changed direction when Yohans father shows up, but if you just accept what's happening, it easy enough to understand. Morten Harket, singer from a-ha, shows up for a small cameo.  Norway is lovely and it's interesting historically.  I liked the film more than I expected, but was really let down with the English part.  With that in mind, there isn't much to the English parts so if you can stomach the b grade acting and silly dialogue you'll enjoy the Norwegian part.",1308268800,3,858,4.448717948717949
