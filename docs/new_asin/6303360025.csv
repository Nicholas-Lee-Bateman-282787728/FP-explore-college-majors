630008,5,6303360025,"I thought that date looked a bit funny. It's a classic film and it otherwise aptly illustrates the confusion that was the Irish War for Independence. I would also like to correct another reviewer who stated that the Black and Tans patrolled ""Northern Ireland"" during that time. For the record, prior to 1922, there was no ""Northern Ireland"" in existence and the Tans and Auxiliaries were stationed throughout Ireland. McLaglen gives an exceptional performance but, like others who have reviewed this film, I really wish they could have gotten the date correct on the opening title card for the sake of future viewers (who likely haven't a clue about Irish history anyway).",1124064000,,672,5.008928571428571
630009,4,6303360025,"I was so happy to see upon reading the other reviews that someone else had a problem with the movie being set in 1922 with Black and Tans running around.  I thought it was just me bothered by this! By 1922, Gypo could possibly have sold out his friend to the Irish Free State or Provisional government authorities, but not to the Tans.  It's stupid to let this affect one's view of an otherwise classic movie, but couldn't Ford have gotten a simple date right?  Also, not sure the IRA drew straws when they took out someone; I think once they got the orders, they just did it.  However, I could be wrong on that one...

And on January 18, 1922, two days after the new Provisional Government took office, Michael Collins took possession of  Dublin Castle, so bring a end to British rule in Ireland, One must write the true, so as not to give out the wrong info, as is give out by so many source today.",1044230400,2,553,3.8508771929824563
630012,5,6303360025,"Liam O'Flaherty's 1925 novel is a masterful psychological study of Gypo Nolan, a dull-witted, impovershed Dubliner who, in the middle of the 1922 Sinn Fein Rebellion, turns stool pigeon during one event-filled night, revealing to police the whereabouts of Frankie McPhillip, a trusting friend and revolutionary who's wanted for murder. Gypo receives a reward of twenty pounds, while Franke is is tracked down by the authorities...........THE INFORMER had already been filmed by the British in 1929 and RKO reluctantly agreed to let Ford remake it with his assurance that it would be a low-budget movie. It was made for slightly over $200,000. This is impassioned Irish melodrama, performed with all the stops out. Beautifully photographed in the mists and dark streets of the studio-built Dublin sets, Joseph H. August's photography coats the film with a striking overlay of distorted realism. The most celebrated image of the film is that of its hulking, blustering central figure, as broadly played by oafish Victor McLaglen in his Oscar winning role of Gypo Nolan. McLaglen's Nolan emerges as a cowardly, despicable brute and boozing liar, capable of any deceit to satisfy a whim or save his neck. McLaglen's interpretation of Gypo is astounding; he seemingly sunk in the sodden body and mind and soul of Gypo Nolan, a creature of the slums pushed on his fumbling way by only the most primitive instincts. Yet, without ever noticeably playing for sympathy, he manages to present a figure that is somehow pitiable. J.M. Kerrigan is terrific, not only because he has the only richly authentic brogue in the whole picture, but because of his portrait of a grasping Irish toady that, for sheer brilliance, surpasses even McLaglen's performance. Ford won his first of four AA for his expert direction.  As a footnote, both Ford and McLaglen were said to drink before some of the more emotional scenes.  Ford spent some 5 years trying to get this film made (studio heads found the subject matter too dark).  The screenplay was written in six days.  It wasn't a successful film until the end of the year, when critics named it one of 1935's ten best films; thereafter, audiences flocked to see it, making it a box-office smash.",998438400,8,2223,5.016260162601626
630013,3,6303360025,"""The Informer"" is about how hard times will make a man turn in another to certain death, if there's enough money involved. Victor McLaglen turns in Wallace Ford to the Black and Tans, and spends the rest of the movie trying to come to terms with his actions. The movie was a bit too antique for my tastes, and seemed overly long as well.

630107,4,6303360025,"Early 20th century story of an Irishman who informs against his comrades to the British occupiers of his nation, gets paid handsomely for leading his friends to their deaths, and then struggles with a guilty conscience in the fashion of Judas. Victor McLaglen (""The Quiet Man"") is always fun to watch, and there's a neat scene where he crashes a fancy dinner party in an attempt to (what?) make new friends in a higher social circle, or at least get away from his old friends. But his guilty conscience keeps drawing him back until the intriguing (and somewhat contrived) climax in a Catholic Church. This film was an Oscar-winner in its day, but like many topical social commentary pieces from the 30s and 40s, feels a bit limp and dated today. It's a shade too topical for its own good, and there have since been better films (""Michael Collins"") on the Irish struggle for independence, but it works well as a simple character study of a man who betrays his friends and tries to live with the guilt, even as he tries to survive the noose that gradually tightens around his neck when the IRA seeks him out for bloody revenge. Worth seeing, but modern audiences may be bored by some of the Hollywood contrivances, and it's not a film that holds up well today compared to timeless classics like ""Casablanca.""",1382140800,,1306,4.658008658008658
630108,5,6303360025,"I first saw this in 1945 in a wonderful New York City rerun theatre (with Winterset). I was 15 and thought it was the best movie I had ever seen. I still think so. The background musice produces a perfect setting for the grimy, sad and engrossing tale of an Irish patriot whose betrayal of his best friend haunts his stupid consciousness until his inevitable end at the hands of his IRA comrades. Victor McLaglen plays this role; it earned him an Academy Award, and it stands up as one of the greatest performances on record. The ending is over-the-top: today it would be considered corny, but to me it seems daring, perfect and somewhat redemptive. McLaglen of course, was with John Wayne the core of the famous John Ford continuing cast, and no actor has ever repaid his director with such glory (although Thomas Mitchell, in several pictures, comes close). If you want to spend a few moments with people instead of robots, androids aliens etc., see this picture. It's a tribute to Hollywood's more glorius past.",1374624000,3,1014,4.702247191011236

630114,4,6303360025,"Dublin, 1922.  The IRA is pitted against the Blacks and Tans.  The fate of the Irish nation is at stake.  Even a ""good"" man with a ""heart"" argues that this is ""No time for sentiment.  This is War!""

What is one man's life worth, if he's ""guilty""?  What about the idea of taking one man's life for the sake of ""many""?

A court of Judgment versus a lover's plea for Mercy.  What about the guilty man's excuse that he ""didn't know what he was doing""?  How much Forgiveness is that worth?

At first, the story seems to hold merely a passing resemblance to one element of the Passion of Christ, Judas' betrayal, but, by the time the movie is ending, the viewer, depending upon his or her background, may realize that various essential concepts that derive out of the life and Passion of Christ are intermingled in the denouement.

And, the viewer is likely to be aware, too, that the character named Mary stands more than coincidentally for certain qualities, as does her mother, these two who constitute the family of the first murdered man in the story--who is CLEARLY a victim.  --At first, the informer's guilt and expedient punishment seem like a ""cut and dried"" case...

This is a psychological drama that focuses upon a man trapped in a ""groping primitive mind.""  I've lifted that phrase and put quotes around it as offering a descriptive insight that comes from a quite brief but illuminating tutorial accompanying the 2006 reissue of this film.  Also from the commentary, we learn that the dark and often foggy atmosphere of the sets were John Ford's way of portraying the circumstances of the protagonist's personality.  The man acts within a ""fog.""  Likewise, the movie sets continually enforce a sense of his entrapment, not only in his limited self, but in his circumstances.  One of the chief motivating images out of which the plot grows illustrates how the starving Gypo Nolan and the woman he loves, Katy, dream of ""escape"" to America, an ultimately futile dream.

While this drawn-out story proves finally to be a significant and important drama, the viewing of it requires some patient endurance while the viewer must accompany the none-too-attractive character of Gypo through some not-very-interesting experiences which will prove meaningful, nonetheless, within the context of the entire story.  In the latter half, or perhaps as far as the last third of the 92-minute film, from the ""court"" scene onward, the story begins to become exciting and to sparkle with meaningfulness.  Then you feel glad you went through it all to get to the unexpected, uplifting finale.

The sound track is a trial to be endured.  In order to hear the dialogue, you have to turn the sound way up, but, then, when the music and noise of tumult occur, they are VERY loud and you have to hurry and turn the sound way down.  I didn't care for the music as such.

There were some nice touches of humor, such as the talkative personality of Mullins, the tailor, and the various personalities at the speak-easy and around the town.  (They reminded me of Dickens' characters.)

The brief tutorial with this movie serves as a really beneficial Plus that helps to open the viewers eyes to deeper meaning as conveyed in the film techniques that John Ford used so creatively, symbolically.

I keep wondering how Ford managed to convey a certain ineffable sense of peace and love, and a certain quality of spiritual depth and quietness (and what else?) several times when the camera focused on the character named Mary.  Part of the effect came from the modest little cross nestled at the center of the modest lace collar, but there was some sort of acting  ""magic"" going on behind those visual items, too, wasn't there?  Or did I imagine it?  And, if I did imagine it, why did I imagine it?

The character of Katy, who has turned prostitute out of need, proves to be a sympathetic one.  All three women's roles, centering upon the quality of mercy, and the roles of Mary and Katy centering in the concept of giving all for love [which is romantic love for their husbands-to-be], bear thinking upon.  It's interesting that in the very first view of Katy, she is wearing a shawl that covers her head and her prostitute-clothes, and she remarkably resembles a saintly ""Virgin Mary"" type.  Later, she proves to have true, innocent, sincere love for Gypo, so she is revealed to be a ""virtuous"" woman underneath her prostitute appearance.  As with the character of Gypo, we see a mixture of contradictory elements in their characters, and the influence of circumstances of poverty.

The movie received the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1935.  I find it a meaningful, worthwhile work.",1326758400,,4665,4.78375

630130,5,6303360025,"John Ford is terrific, no matter the subject. But when it comes to the Irish, he's outstanding. This is a pre-noir film noir Irish gangster movie in which Victor McLaglen plays an Irishman that sells out his Republican Army buddy to the British police in order to get enough money to leave Ireland and go to America with his girl. But he doesn't use the money to buy steamship tickets - instead, he gets drunk and gives the money away. He's an idiot, and his comrades in arms realize that after tailing him over the course of the night. So, they have a trial and he's found guilty of causing the death of his friend. Typical of Ford is the fantastic character study of McLaglen's character, the action, and the cultural details. I wouldn't have thought I would have enjoyed a film starring McLaglen, but he won an Oscar for this performance, and it is that good. This is one of Ford's earliest and best. In spite of McLaglen's Oscar, it's Ford and the supporting cast that make the film so good. If you like movies with a lot of atmosphere and tension, you'll like this one.

Waitsel Smith",1264896000,3,1089,4.472361809045226
630131,4,6303360025,"Personally I think Victor McLaglen's (1886-1959) best performance was in ""The Quiet Man"" (1952) although I enjoyed him even more in ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949). Both these films were directed by John Ford (1894-1973) and in both of them McLaglen played supporting roles to John Wayne. While he was nominated for an Academy Award for ""The Quiet Man"", he won it for his portrayal of Gypo Nolan in ""The Informer"". And in 1935 he was competing with Clark Gable and Charles Laughten (""Mutiny on the Bounty"").

FWIW - Initially there was reluctance at RKO to cast McLaglen, but Ford fought for his old friend. Then, after he won the Oscar, Ford was reluctant to join in the chorus of praise. He told an inter viewer in 1936 ""I'm no McLaglen fan, you know.""

John Ford also won the Academy Award that year for ""The Informer,"" the first of his 4 awards for best director (he won his last one with McLaglen and Wayne in ""The Quiet Man""). He worked often with McLaglen, in silent films and in talkies. Prior to ""The Informer"" their most famous teaming was ""The Lost Patrol"" (1934). Interestingly enough, both ""The Lost Patrol"" and ""The Informer"" were remakes of silent films shot in the 20s.

Coming in 1935, this film has many overtones left over from the silent film era, an era in which Ford made some 60 films, the last of which he made with McLaglen (""Four Sons""). There are some really memorable scenes (e.g., when McLaglen looks in the window of the Travel agency and realizes he's spent the money he needed; when his girlfriend Margot Grahame solicits a customer on the street) which have no dialogue and in which the actors do wonders, just as the best silent films had done.

This film has many characters you've seen so often. Wallace Ford (1898-1966) plays Frankie McPhillip, the man McLaglen betrays - Ford appeared in nearly 200 films between 1930 and 1965. Preston Foster (1900-70) is Dan Gallagher, the head of the local IRA - Foster appeared in over 100 films, and is best known for playing the Northwest Mounted Police. Other notables include John's older brother Francis Ford (1881-1953) and Donald Meek (1878-1946). Special mention must be made of Una O'Connor (1880-1959) who plays Frankie's mother. She was a terrific actress who made nearly 100 films between 1929 and 1957. She was a true scene stealer and did so in films such as ""The Invisible Man"" (1933), ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935), and ""The Adventure of Robin Hood"" (1938).

Ford's use of photography is at its best here, showing influences from the German Expressionists, especially Fritz Lang's ""M"", but there is none of the careful staging that became a hallmark of his later films. McLaglen, on the other hand, appears fully formed. All the drinking, cursing, fighting, and bluster that would become his characteristics are on stage here, partly because he was nearly 50 when the film was made.

Long time Ford collaborator Dudley Nichols (1895-1960) wrote the screenplay. Nichols has the distinction of being the first person to refuse an Oscar, for his work on this film. He would be nominated 3 more times (""The long Voyage Home"", ""Air Force"", ""The Tin Star"") but never won again. Among his notable films were ""The 3 Musketeers"" (1935), ""Stagecoach"" (1939), ""Gunga Din"" (1939), and ""Pinky"" (1949).

Austrian composer Max Steiner handled the musical score, which is heavy handed and tied to the symbolism, but nonetheless impressive.  Between 1935 and 1956 he was nominated for an Oscar 19 times, and won for ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), ""Now Voyager"" (1942), and this film. He was so well known that he appeared on a 33 cent stamp (1999) along with Dimitri Tiomkin and Alfred Newman.

Winning two major Academy Awards in 1935 was an incredible achievement for the film. Tired of the depression, the major films were comedies and musicals (the Marx Brothers' ""Night at the Opera"", Fred Astaire's ""Top Hat"", Frank Capra's ""Mr Deeds"", Nelson Eddy and Jeanette McDonald's ""Rose Marie"") so the idea of a starving man betraying his best friend to buy a ticket to the US for himself and his street walking girlfriend was hardly the type of escapism that was most popular.

Ford was originally turned down by all the major studios, but help from his friend Joseph P. Kennedy, another Irishman, got him the green light at RKO where he had already made the successful ""The Lost Patrol"" the previous year, starring McLaglen. Ford also got help from  Merian Cooper (1893-1973) who was the Head of Production. Cooper was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Quiet Man"" (1952), one of several films he made with John Wayne (e.g., ""The Searchers"", ""Rio Grande"", ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"", ""Fort Apache""). His other notable films include ""King Kong"" (1933) and ""Wagon Master"" (1950). Ford called Cooper his favorite producer. Among his other talents, Cooper was a pioneer in stop motion animation, Technicolor, and Cinerama as well as a war hero, an aviation pioneer, and one of the first real life documentary makers.

Despite the initial doubts, the film was a box office and a critical success. The NY Times called the film ""an astonishing screen drama"" and ""a striking psychological study of a gutter Judas and a rawly impressive picture of the Dublin underworld during the Black and Tan terror."" They heaped high praise on McLaglen saying he ""becomes brilliant under Mr. Ford's guidance"" and praised the supporting cast as ""excellent"".

Daryl F. Zanuck called the film ""a visual masterpiece almost unparalleled in cinema history"". Variety said it was ""forcefully and intelligently written, directed, and acted"".

He is a drunkard and seems to have no idea that he has done something very wrong until the inevitable end.
Ireland wants nothing to do with the British empire
and has two armies: the British which is composed of men wearing Scotch hats
and the underground wearing trench coats.
Even today the IRA sends terror into the hearts of otherwise tough people the world over.
A very good movie for the 30's this was a way of showing people in the states that something was going on over there.
A lot of blood has been shed over this.",1244246400,2,635,4.256198347107438
630133,4,6303360025,"While I concur wholeheartedly with the superlatives applied to this film by the other reviewers, I feel that I must point out that this release appears to have been mastered from a release print rather than one from the vaults.  The film has not been restored.  There are long, deep scratches running throughout the film that could have been remedied by careful restoration.  Warners is usually much better about this.  Please don't let this deter you from purchasing this film.  It is truly a classic, but could have been better handled.",1215216000,10,538,4.868131868131868
630134,5,6303360025,"This blistering adaptation of Liam O'Flaherty's novel by John Ford features a searing, Oscar-winning performance by McLaglen, who plays the barrel-chested Irish boozer and Troubles-era traitor with gut-wrenching pathos, especially when he delivers his last line. A labor of love for Ford, outfitted with Joseph August's atmospheric evocation of foggy Dublin and a superb score by Oscar winner Max Steiner, ""Informer"" is the kind of full-blooded political drama we rarely get to enjoy today. And McLaglen's turn as the desperate, deeply remorseful brute makes the tragic story of betrayal and redemption even more worthy of struggle.",1182384000,7,632,5.59375
630135,5,6303360025,"If ever there was a film that defines a ""timeless classic"", this is it.

Victor McLaglen, your favorite comedic and gruff cavalry sergeant in westerns, gives a stunning dramatic performance which won him an academy award in this 1935 John Ford masterpiece. McLaglen is Gyppo Nolan, a somewhat dim witted, hulking, and shunned IRA Soldier in war torn Dublin of the early 1900's. Gyppo fell out of favor with the IRA, is penniless, without friends, and in love with a streetwalker named Katy. Gyppo informs on a fellow IRA soldier wanted for murder by the British, and for this, he receives twenty pounds, the price of steerage passage to America for Katy and himself. His friend, Frankie Phillips, is killed by the British. Driven by remorse, Gyppo goes on a drunken spree, spends the twenty pounds, is taken and interrogated by the IRA, and . . . is eventually killed by them for being the ""The Informer"". The entire film was shot on a sound stage using darkness and shadows for effect. And - the effect, although now seventy two years old, is dramatic.

This is a keeper.",1177286400,14,1072,4.696808510638298

630137,5,6303360025,"Years before ""Citizen Kane"" John Ford revolutionized the language of American cinema with ""The Informer"".  Atmosphere plays as much a character here as the actors themselves.  Shadows, darkness, and fog forbode the doom of Gyppo Nolan(Victor McLaglen) as much as his guilty conscience for informing to the Black and Tans on his former brother in arms.  This is a literate film that explores the psyche of a barely literate man.  Gyppo ostensibly informs on Frankie McPhillip (Wallace Ford) to gain passage to America for himself and his streetwalker girlfriend(Heather Angel).  The bloodmoney proves too much of a cross to bear so he literally gives it away to ease his burning guilt.  This proves his undoing as the scent of his illgotten gains attracts the Republican Army to his trail of deceit.  McLaglen won an Oscar for one of great performances in American screen history.  McLaglen assays all the complexities of a seeming simpleton who commits the unthinkable and makes him sympathetic and ultimately worthy of redemption.  ""The Informer"" is ultimately a film that will transcend the ages because it's themes are as universal today as they were in 1935.",1151280000,32,1162,5.105820105820106
630138,5,6303360025,"Victor McLaglen, one-time Heavyweight Champion of Great Britain, won an Oscar for his portrayal of Gypo Nolan, a drunken lug of an Irishman during the Dublin uprisings in 1922, who rats out his best friend for a 20-pound reward. McLaglen is perfect in this role; director John Ford, who also won an Oscar, was not looking for subtlety from McLaglen and didn't get an ounce of it: he takes the camera on as if it was one of his old boxing opponents. Perhaps there was no more powerful a dumb-brute screen performance until Brando's Stanley Kowalski. Legend has it that Ford kept McLaglen soused for most of the picture (it was made in only 17 days), and it looks like it might be true. The photography is stunning and captures perfectly the ""as wet as drip"" look of Dublin. Max Steiner's musical score is also very moving. Definitely worth a watch.",1143072000,3,847,4.6158940397351
