2963477,1,B000W929P8,"""Going Steady"" is a coming of age movie made in Israel and dubbed (badly) from the original Hebrew. Set in the 1950's, the movie is made to nauseate. From the ultra-squeaky dubbed female voices, to the horrid caricature of a Jewish mother, to the subplots about fish and ice in a bathtub, and a fixation about stewed prunes, this really is the Yiddish ""Porky's,"" and that's terribly unfortunate.

The film is like a sharp poke in the eye: the script, acting, and especially music are ultimately annoying. The level of humor is extremely juvenile (throwing eggs at a budding violinist, loads of sexual innuendo, etc.), and seeks to prove, among other things, that stalking is fun.

The actress playing the female lead, Tammy (Yvonne Michaels), is modestly talented and pretty, all other participants are homely hacks. I found this film utterly repulsive. You have been warned.",1196899200,,875,4.986301369863014

8221778,2,B000W929P8,"This is a coming of age story as Benji (Yftach Katzur) and his friends discover girls. Benji has an obsession for Tammy (Yvonne Michaels). Martha (Rachel Steiner) wants Benji so she dates his fat friend Huey (Zachi Noy). Film includes something that passes for bikers and that love and jealousy game. Not as good as the American films that inspired it or the ones that came later.

Good soundtrack.

8221781,2,B000W929P8,"The Movie is an old sweet movie, always enjoyable. Unfortunately, on transfer to DVD, the picture is dark & the sound muffled. The result is extremely disappointing I believe that this DVD is only produced on order by Synergy. I would recommend sourcing it from elsewhere.",1368403200,,272,4.934782608695652
8221782,4,B000W929P8,This is a fun movie filled with charmingly banal plot lines and wonderfully pleasing cornball dubbing that plays well to a B-Movie lover's ear. In addition there's great music from the 50's at a sock-hop and of course there's a bit of the old back stabbing routine played out amongst the teenagers in L-O-V-E.  I watched it at 3AM once.  It's that type of people for those type of people.  You know who you are.,1292630400,2,411,4.453333333333333

Before Porkys, American Pie or Revenge of the Nerds series.. I hope one day I can buy Lemon Popsicle 1,2,3,4,5.. the remain movies sucks",1218153600,2,373,4.420289855072464
8221785,5,B000W929P8,"It's a juvenile teen film, with low class REALISTIC humour, but there is one scene in it worth the whole film. It's when the two leads make love for the first time. It's one of the most beautiful, emotional, subtle scenes I've ever seen in cinema. It ranks up with the best Lemon Popsicle films.",1203638400,2,295,4.381818181818182
