A beautiful music makes a brotherhood story of two middle-aged intellectuals defected a visual horror of Nazi-occupied Warsaw to a country-side more easy to watch as their sexual desires towards underage farm girls explicit also depicted in limbo.

Different mentality and boarders of cultural permissiveness keep a run of this story a bit misunderstood even for not following grey translation of dialogues provided in too small shrift.

A classic East European drama with food for thoughts while watching murdering, seductive teen girls and underage intercourse-and no porno at all!",1247529600,2,614,5.51063829787234
8067016,5,B0009UKVP0,"You never know what to expect from a foreign film. Most of ""Made in USA"" flicks are quite predictable. Here you'd expect that at least the name of it will give you some idea what it is all about. Not so.
There are practically no sex, no nudity at all, and definitely no pornography in this movie. It is extremely slow and extremely beautiful. Have a drink and some quality slow food with it (not popcorn or chips - say, frozen raspberries and very bitter chocolate). It is mesmerizing watching all these sounds and visions of Polish countryside, Polish old farts drinking and smoking and talking (not much) and drinking again. There are some beautiful young bodies but they are clean and decent and underexposed and made more desirable this way. Somewhere after long watching I got bored of meditation and lost interest and as soon as it happened - the show came to a fast and (literally) bloody end.
They have a holocaust parallel theme but it is not ""into your face"" so it is wouldn't overkill as many films do with it now.
Take your time and try to watch it in one piece (remember, it is more than 2 hours).",1210464000,49,1110,4.472906403940887

Fryderyk (Krzysztof Majehrzak) and Witold (Adam Ferency) are two of the few remaining intellectuals left in Warsaw during WWII. Witold suggests they visit an old friend of his in the countryside and wait out the war in peace and quiet.

Soon after arriving at the farm of Hipolit and Maria they discover a new set of problems and personalities to explore within the household and village against the backdrop of distant gunfire and the occassional German solider or two in search of supplies.

Both men find themselves perversely attracted to Hipolit and Maria's attractive teenage daughter Henia (Sandra Samos). Fryderyk and Witold begin to play a dangerous mental game with ""the simple"" villagers that will change the destinies of all involved. Soon the emotional confllict within the household becomes just as deadly as the war raging around the Polish countryside.

Krzysztof Majchrzak has both the look and the personality to play the part of the Mephistopheles-like Fryderyk. Tall, slender and very angular with a rather long, crooked nose. His overt unattractiveness seems to go unnoticed due to his glib conversational skills and expert piano playing. Atheistic, ammoral and at times antagonistic, he still somehow manages to sexually attract the young Catholic women in the house. He draws the young girls to him like a mythic Pan playing his flute.

Sandras Samos is also a wonderful treat as Henia. Her seemingly pure innocence slowly transforms before your eyes as she comes under the spell of Fryderyk and Witold. She's a veritable feast for the eyes.

A little slow here and there but overall rewarding with several excellent performances!",1148774400,41,1691,5.198529411764706
