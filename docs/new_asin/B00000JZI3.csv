The video excerpt of Schlitzie dressed as the man he was, with hair, alone is worth the price of the video. Get it!",1010793600,5,293,4.528301886792453
7914025,4,B00000JZI3,"I've never seen a video remotely like this one.  It haunts you long after you've seen it.  The result of an enormous amount of archival research and highly professional writing and editing, this video brings alive the history and culture  of circus sideshow ""freaks.""  Dwarfs, giants, pin-heads, Siamese twins,  monkey women, dog-faced men, people without legs and/or arms and those with  miniature ""twins"" protruding from various parts of the body.  They are  all here in a fast-paced, feature-length color film laced with humor, compassion,  historical knowlege and provocative social commentary.  The film includes interviews  with some of the characters, including a bearded lady and the charismatic last  surviving circus ""half lady.""  While almost hypnotically entertaining,  this is a serious work that will remain the definitive visual study for years to  come.  This film is about very special human beings, who lived before scientific  ""final solutions"" were possible.  Their life stories, the film's  remarkable interviews and its engaging narrative, all challenge the accepted  wisdom about deformed people, not only whether they have a right to live, but  whether they can live happy lives.  Most important, whether they have something  invaluable to contribute to the human family.  This film will draw you back  time and time again and bend your mind every viewing.",939859200,32,1380,5.42654028436019
