8440995,5,B004TWOX9Y,"Until I purchased the DVD of Bruckner's 8th by the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Frantz Welser-Most I had not heard the uncut version of this massive symphony.  Simply put, the sound, interpretation and video are all outstanding.  I would rank this performance among the best along with those by Karajan and the BPO and Giulini and the VPO and this has the added bonus of one being able to watch the performance.  Highly recommended.",1380153600,2,436,4.864864864864865
8440996,5,B004TWOX9Y,"Welser-Most has been supported by a major Upper Austrian bank for over 25 years now as a cultural envoy. This level of support suggests that Welser-Most has something special to offer in terms of Austrian music especially. Those who know his recent Summer Night's Gala or the 2011 New Year's Day concert with the VPO will also be aware that he can produce very lively responses from his orchestra too.

This recording is a performance of the original version of this symphony and is given a performance of considerable splendour. The description of 'Cathedrals in sound' is easy to comprehend here. There are several later versions of the symphony which may be more familiar but all compromise Bruckner's original concept as recorded here and which Welser-Most now believes to be the best.

I have grown to like this edition and interpretation very much indeed over several viewings. I would view Welser-Most's performance as typically having a very clear long-term view of structure held under tight control but driven by a deeply held conviction. The climaxes are massive but this is balanced by considerable moments of delicacy. The orchestra is well able to deliver at this level.

The concert is well recorded and presented in DTS 5.1 surround and stereo sound formats with sympathetic camera work which is detailed without being invasive. I personally find the occasional use of multiple images unhelpful but hardly a serious bother.

This seems to me to be a very fine entry in what is building to be a very significant series with a very personal and justifiable choice of editions. The standard of music making is of a consistently high calibre as is the recording quality. Welser-Most himself is clearly dedicated to his task and I would therefore suggest that this will give purchasers much pleasure and food for thought. A 5 star rating seems totally reasonable therefore.

Further suggestions for extra listening:
For those who might be further interested in more of Welser-Most's performances I would strongly recommend his Mozart Cosi fan Tutte and his Lehar Merry Widow (in German and with wonderfully vibrant acting as well as singing). Those who know his recent Summer Night's Gala or the 2011 New Year's Day concert with the VPO will also be aware that he can produce very lively responses from his musicians as appropriate to the occasion.",1342915200,2,2359,5.00765306122449
8440997,5,B004TWOX9Y,"I don't know who to praise more, the brilliant Austrian conductor Franz Welser-Most, or the ""always surprising"" Cleveland Symphony.

Not to mention the composer, Anton Bruckner.  His eighth symphony is a masterpiece: some people view it as the devout Bruckner having a conversation with God.  That may or may not be true, but it is well worth listening in on the conversation.

The DVD is riveting, and it's one of the finest I own.

I would like to hear from the Bruckner experts, however --- what is their opinion of this performance as opposed to the one on the Karajan boxed set of the complete Bruckner symphonies?",1319500800,4,619,4.747663551401869
8440998,5,B004TWOX9Y,"Most listeners won't be familiar with this version of the Bruckner Eighth Symphony.  The version was prepared by Leopold Nowak from Bruckner's first effort at the Eighth Symphony.  I had never heard this version before and I know of no other recording of it.  The conducting is excellent and the orchestra plays beautifully.  The symphony is laid out appropriately - the pacing feels right - not rushed or too slow.  Again, for fans of the composer, this symphony may be worth a try.  It will sound different than the version most often played by conductors.",1317081600,4,558,4.821052631578947
8440999,5,B004TWOX9Y,"Franz Welser-Mst's Cleveland Bruckner series continues with a majestic recording of the Eighth, captured in splendid sound and video in Severance Hall and based on the second (1887) Leopold Nowak edition. The latter is unusual in itself, as most modern performances use either the Robert Haas or the earlier Nowak edition with cuts and drastic changes in the orchestration. Thus, Welser-Mst's choice restores the score in all its glory of 90 minutes duration as close as possible to the composer's intentions. And a glorious performance it is! Welser-Mst is perhaps the greatest living Bruckner interpreter alongside Christian Thielemann. For Welser-Mst, Bruckner clearly is his heart and soul. When you sit down with this disk, be prepared to spend the next ninety minutes in rapt attention, as the Cleveland audience does. This is Bruckner par excellence, with ideal tempi, an uncanny attention to detail as well as to the multiple dynamic shades, the different layers of expression and the whole spectrum of emotions from the mysterious through the spiritually sublime to the ultimate confrontation with death.",1306108800,19,1113,5.365714285714286
