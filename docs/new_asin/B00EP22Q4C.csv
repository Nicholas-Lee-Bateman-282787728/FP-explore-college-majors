5932095,4,B00EP22Q4C,"This video is interesting due to the last half hour, which sets out an explanation for ghosts and spirits being present at the mansion at the corner of 11th Ave. and Pennsylvania St. in Denver, Colorado. The video concludes by demonstrating that purgatory has to be a reality, as it is depicted in over 700 years of art work. Some of the scenery of purgatory in the art work resembles the Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs, the location from which the stone was quarried for the mansion. Thus, part of purgatory was moved to this corner in Denver, which explains why the mansion has spirits trapped inside. This logical explanation is set out most systematically and is to be taken seriously, just as it is presented. Thus, the Patterson mansion in Denver proves the Catholic doctrine of purgatory is the truth. All of this actually should be considered brilliant... in some way!!!!!!",1412208000,,889,4.779220779220779
5932096,1,B00EP22Q4C,"No real action happens in this film.  It's a shameless promotion of the restoration project these guys did.  I live in Denver and let me tell ya -- this ""castle"" is not represented accurately.",1402185600,4,192,4.617647058823529
5932097,3,B00EP22Q4C,"The movie was interesting. A documentary of a big mansion being renovated and the odd things that happen according to the owner, an architect, and workers. Watched it twice.",1397088000,,173,5.0
5932098,4,B00EP22Q4C,This is really not so scary but the story is interesting.  More of a good documentary. It does hold your interest.,1394150400,2,114,4.428571428571429
5932099,4,B00EP22Q4C,"This is a neat little film about the Croke-Patterson Mansion in Denver, Colorado.  A young entrepreneur named Brian sets about the task of renovating Croke-Patterson Mansion, aka The Castle.  When things start happening - paranormal things - he has the foresight to start filming to document the experiences of the workers and the former owners of the building.  The events that transpire are truly creepy, supernatural, and sadly, some turn out to be tragic.  Are some events just coincidental, or are they truly the workings of the supernatural upon his team and upon Brian himself?  This is a very different first hand account of the paranormal and of the effect that a building that has the reputation of being haunted can have on quite normal, hard working people just trying to get a job done.  But are the unseen forces there to help or to hinder them?

I truly enjoyed this film but I do have two criticisms: The first one involves a short segment with the movie makers girlfriend.  First of all, if you know you are making a documentary and not a home movie, tell your girlfriend to put a shirt on in bed.  Unless your point was to let the world know you have a not unattractive girlfriend who sleeps in the nude with you, then the entire girlfriend segment could have been left out.  She contributed nothing to the documentary, either evidential or intellectual, by being there, except maybe to elevate the misguided film makers ego.  Okay?  Alrighty then.

Secondly, the subject of purgatory, mostly a Roman Catholic innovation, is not shared by everyone.  Most people who have come in contact with the paranormal attempt to explain the existence of ghosts and quite naturally, fall back on their religious beliefs for an answer.  In this film, what started out to be an explanation of why spirits still haunt the Castle turns into a lengthy history of purgatory and the film makers attempt to prove that the Garden of the Gods where the stone was quarried in order to build the Castle, is, in fact, depicted in ancient renderings and paintings of purgatory as an actual place, and he even superimposes paintings of the rock formations from medieval artwork to the rock formations of the Garden of the Gods, calling them exact representations.  While interesting, it is also a bit weird and inaccurate.  They were not exact.  One could probably find any number of rock formations from anywhere in the world and superimpose them over the paintings and still find an uncanny resemblance.  A more scientific and plausible explanation could be that sandstone, like limestone, shale and granite, has the ability to act as a memory conduit for spiritual  manifestation.  There are theories that water can also store spiritual energy, and all rocks contain water, sandstone being able to store even larger quantities of fluid.  Rock formations that are primarily composed of sandstone usually allow percolation of water and other fluids and are porous enough to store large quantities of water.  When the situation is right, the water that is evaporated and released from the sandstone could be the conduit used to emit spiritual manifestations or play back events that may be stored within the stone.  It is a much adhered to paranormal theory that could be considered for the haunting, in contrast to considering the Garden of the Gods as purgatory on earth.  But, to each his own.  All in all, this was an interesting and refreshing film, unhampered by the usual ghost investigation teams asking for signs of a presence and explaining what EVP means.  This had heart to it and authenticity and creepiness.  I liked it a lot and I recommend it.",1389312000,6,3650,4.8624595469255665
5932100,1,B00EP22Q4C,This pseudo documentary is boring!  Nothing really creepy or scary happens.  Much of what is said comes from a toothless contractor who is reporting mostly hearsay.  Not worth even $3.99.,1382227200,6,187,5.166666666666667
5932101,1,B00EP22Q4C,Waste of time.  Ridiculous attempt to draw parallels to Dante's Inferno.  A bat?  A dead cat?  A hole in the wall?  Is that all supposed to be frightening?,1505779200,,155,4.392857142857143
5932102,1,B00EP22Q4C,"This ""documentary"" was a complete waste of time. Nothing happens. Followed by a series of outlandish parallels drawn between this house, Dante's inferno and a beautiful geological area where the stone from the house was mined from being hell? It felt like a shameless promotion by the new owners of this house to try to generate buzz for their B&B. Sure, it is free for Prime members but don't waste your time!",1505433600,,410,4.708333333333333
5932103,4,B00EP22Q4C,"I walked past the mansion just last week and stopped to admire its wonderful brickwork. Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood to walk. I enjoyed this documentary, the historical insights, the candid interviews with the very likeable past and present owners and caretakers. The movie presented a very balanced and non-judgmental perspective,  an exploration of a historic landmark and its effect on people. And I loved how the film maker allowed his feelings to show, even when not particularly  proud of them.

My West Wash Park ""square-torian"" was built in 1900. I sometimes wonder about the lives of the people who have lived here, how many happy days, how many sad days these walls have witnessed. How many layers of wallpaper cover my plaster and lathe walls? And how much is it going to cost me to get my entry way floor stabilized and leveled. It was easy for me to identify with this movie subjects. Definitely worth a view, especially for Denverites.",1504483200,2,957,4.858895705521473

5932108,1,B00EP22Q4C,"This was a joke.  Starts out o.k. but makes statements that are half-assed.  Goes to France and Italy for really no reason.  All of a sudden his dog is gone but no reason, yet he tells us all about his beliefs.  Claims he caught a ghost on camera, but any AV nerd can see it is a light flare.  Keeps hearing noises in the empty mansion and seems to have no explanation, yet finds a bag with rat poop in it.  Starts the show with a phone interview with an older owner that tells of a dog that went nuts and jumped out a window and later dies.  This window was a lower level front window and the dog a shepherd.  If anyone who knows anything about guard dogs, someone was trying to get in and he went after him and a good guard dog will stop at nothing.  A lot of crap.  He stays for 30 nights in the place, but calls it quits after 16 due to no fire alarms????  I mean he knew that going in.  Then a bit later the place catches fire!!!  Insurance Claim!!!  They keep interviewing this worker and this guy is the DJ Qualls of carpentry and looks like he has been rode hard and put away wet.  Then he does the end of the movie on Dante's Divine Comedy????  I thought this was about the Croke Patterson house???  This was a money making scheme and smelled of it!!!  Not very bright for an educated architect.",1436313600,,1304,4.086956521739131

8607745,2,B00EP22Q4C,"The film-makers had tried to make a film about the Croke Patterson mansion and about the alleged hauntings inside it while restoring it to become an inn. The film is watchable and there are moments where they do tell the truth. They don't try to shock the audiences with actual frightening events. The stories of the Crokes and Pattersons are known to Denver, Colorado. The home itself could be a story without going far. The families of the Crokes and Pattersons seemed quite fascinating though. I wished the film-director focused on the mansion's history rather than the alleged disturbances.

The film tries to Blair Witch Projects about a mansion in Denver, Colorado. Then the film talks about purgatory; Dante's Inferno with clips of a silent film; and news coverage. Don't know what is true or fake about this movie. The DVD doesn't come with special features to explain what the film director had in mind originally. I wished the film director had showed the mansion for its beauty. There somebody travels to Florence, Italy for Dante and to the French chateau countryside in Loire Valley, France.",1530748800,,1104,4.935483870967742

8607747,5,B00EP22Q4C,"Very unusual and interesting approach to the whole ""ghosts matter"".
Good quality filming which is rare in the supernatural ""documentary"" flooding the Internet and pretending to be important discoveries.
Some of the night-vision camera footage is intriguing: they are dismissing those light artifacts flying across the screen as dust particles, unlike all other ""investigating teams"" I have seen who jump on them as EVIDENCE even when they do look just like a dust particle. These captured in Brian's room while he slept were NOT dust. What they were - who knows...
This film is a serious work.",1511740800,,593,5.123711340206185

8607753,1,B00EP22Q4C,"Don't waste your time. They went into this wanting to ""prove"" a conclusion reached with no evidence. Their research was a joke. Many of the ""Christian"" symbols they found around the house were taken from cultures that predate Christianity. They treated the Divine Comedy as a historical record rather than a work of fiction. They did not need an hour and fifteen minutes to spew this garbage. A 30 minute episode on some laughable ghost hunter TV show would have sufficed.",1507248000,4,472,4.839506172839506
8607754,2,B00EP22Q4C,"The only reason I don't give it 1 star is the lowest rating should probably be reserved for positively offensive material.  This isn't offensive, just boring and misleading.  Does anything scary happen?  Yes:  a guy finds a bat in his bedroom.  That is a very dangerous situation, since bats can carry rabies and people do not always realize they have been bitten.  Also a worker dies at home of a heart attack, which cuts a little too close to home for me.  But really, this was a movie that should not have been made.  It isn't really a documentary of the house's history, nor is it a collection of witness accounts of ghostly activity, nor is it even a ""paranormal investigation"", though it half-heartedly flirts with each of these genres.",1506124800,2,742,4.653846153846154
