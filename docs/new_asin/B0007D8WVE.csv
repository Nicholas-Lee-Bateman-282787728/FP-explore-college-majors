8047034,5,B0007D8WVE,have been working out with victoria for years - like her style and the music - she does get you pumping and makes working out fun (not usually my favorite activity!) - would not pay the amazon price of over 9 dollars though - probably available at the library - i have it on vhs which i am finally consigning to another life...,1444867200,,327,4.2063492063492065

8047036,3,B0007D8WVE,"I really like Victoria Johnson, she's upbeat, friendly and a good instructor.  That said, this DVD cover is very mis-leading.  First it's not low impact.  The warm-up is about the only thing that I'd consider low impact.  The rest of the segments get progressively higher impact and harder to follow.  I've been working out and teaching aerobics for over 30 years - all levels so trust me on this.  Secondly, it's not easy to learn or follow if you're a beginner.  I didn't have a problem with most of it but a beginner would be tripping all over herself (or himself).  Again, the warm-up could be followed by most folks but to put a blanket statement that it's easy to learn is just wrong.  I remember way back when I was first learning aerobics, even a transition between a grapevine, side step and knee lifts could throw me off.  It takes time to get used to aerobic progressions if you've never done it and this was a challenge even for me in places.  So if you're an experienced exerciser and have some funk, buy it, I really like her style, but if you're just learning aerobics, I'd try something a little easier to start out with.  Good luck and good health",1411344000,2,1164,4.464454976303317

8047039,5,B0007D8WVE,I love low impact aerobics so when I got this dvd I immediately began using it. This dvd and my diet help me to lose a lot of weight. I am about to use it again and I know the results will be phenomonal. You burn a lot of calories and get a good cardio vascular workout with it.,1323302400,,278,3.7288135593220337
8047040,3,B0007D8WVE,"She's encouraging and gives great suggestions about body-alignment.  The music is fine and the moves are GREAT fun.  BUT it is NOT low-impact!  I just want folks to know, so they can avoid injury.  I have done low-impact aerobics on a daily basis for almost two years but I am middle-aged and overweight and perhaps that contributes to jamming up my knee doing this routine.",1212710400,7,374,4.707692307692308
8047041,5,B0007D8WVE,"This is an old vhs copy to dvd from probably the early 1990s since all the women wore spandex thongs. I got the origonal vhs from my library.
Victoria is a great dance & great energy. At first I wasn't sure I was going to like it because it starts with a lot of step touches, but her love of dance, great body awareness, fluid funky take on the dancing made up for it & then some. Even her warm up was perfect, she stretched each area for perfect length of time & moved on the muscles I was just thinking should be next. I wasn't in the mood to exercise at first, but by the end, I was going all the way into it & loving it.
This is basic set with 3 white women & 1 african american guy. Yes, the girls aren't funky or fluid, but they keep up. Just keep your eyes on Victoria. The music is great, it changes with the program & it's real music with a great beat & real singing. Remember, this is set in 1990s so expect music from that time.
There are step touches, skating, hip hop running man & roger rabbit, some mambos & cha chas, some jazz hands & turns & box step.
She breaks down the moves, & teaches in 1/2 speed a few times & then full speed. She does a lot of step touches in between so help you transition between the different dance styles. She's a wonderful teacher. No one should have trouble keeping up in terms of learning.
I had a lot of fun & I am now definitely going to rent her other dance dvds.
You can see her website at victoriajohnson
On youtube just look up ""Victoria's Body Shoppe""
Don't be afraid of buying from the Amazon Marketplace, if you're not happy & have trouble with the seller, Amazon will refund your money.",1184544000,13,1644,4.108695652173913
