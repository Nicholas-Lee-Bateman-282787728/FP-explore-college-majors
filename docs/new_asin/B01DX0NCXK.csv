8757118,3,B01DX0NCXK,"Someone thought an artsy approach might help the bare-bones script and thus were given a lot of out-of-focus shots and stray images related to nothing in particular.  The camera wanders, gets lost, soon its night and then out comes the flashlight and a lot of shots of the light bouncing around like Tinker Bell.  Screams ensue and were left to wonder what all the fuss is about.  Cue title: THE PACK.

The cinematographer loved-loved-loved close-close-too-close-close-ups.  And legs, feet, wind through the trees........I began to wonder if I had stumbled onto a nature film.  Okay, it was funny to watch a crow kick a lamb.  But what did that have to do with anything?  Where was the proffered horror?  Wait for it..................  Eventually, we begin to suspect there are ferocious critters in the woods.  Out of a cast of eight, half of them become puppy chow.  As for the farm family, they wasted more time dealing with a joker who wants to foreclose on the farm then building any suspense or foreboding.  There are a few jump-scares, little to no tension, some growling dogs, a couple random attacks using a lot of blood and editing to almost give the impression of an attack, no dread, and no character development.  And then it just ends, as if nothing at all happened.

I won't say it was a complete waste of time, I didn't mind watching it.  But its not something Ill keep to watch again.",1470700800,,1401,4.703703703703703
