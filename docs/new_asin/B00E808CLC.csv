He'll understand more in time, but it's great that they are entertaining enough now and will still hold value as he matures.",1492646400,,262,4.26
8602269,5,B00E808CLC,"Great little videos about the Lord.  Obviously geared toward younger kids, but enjoyable for all.",1483833600,,97,5.466666666666667

8602271,5,B00E808CLC,"We need more of this types of video for our children, nice video, I love it.",1479772800,,76,3.8125
8602272,1,B00E808CLC,It wasn't as in depth of a story/content as I hoped.,1473033600,,52,3.8181818181818183
8602273,5,B00E808CLC,"I absolutely recommend THEO. My kids and I love it. It is not watered down and the message of the gospel is well presented. There are 5 DVDs total with 3 episodes in each dvd and the ""good news"" is at the end of every dvd. Each episode (what is the church?, road to Romans, the fruit of the spirit, abiding in Christ, adoption, etc) is explained very well and it's so adorable and so well made! I haven't seen many kids Christian cartoons/DVDs that actually teach doctrine but THEO definitely does. Just because kids are young it doesn't mean that they can't understand theology or we shouldn't teach them that because it's deep.  I find it disappointing that most materials for kids are shallow and fluffy these days. My only dissapointment is that I wish there were more THEO DVDs.",1466812800,,783,4.553191489361702
8602274,5,B00E808CLC,"What a cute series! I have 4 kiddos and they all loved it. As soon as one episode was over, they wanted to keep watching it and asked if there were more when it was over. The content, story and songs were wonderful. It was honestly a breath of fresh air and there's something very peaceful about listening to ""Theo"" tell the stories.",1414108800,,333,4.301587301587301
