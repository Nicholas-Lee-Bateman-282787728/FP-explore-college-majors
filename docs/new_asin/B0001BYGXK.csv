8009840,2,B0001BYGXK,"-- This DVD contains only 13 minutes of advanced ab exercises (about 10 exercises plus variations).  So there is some value here, but not nearly what you expect.

-- This DVD description is misleading and the DVD is over-priced for what you get. It is not what you are led to believe is a 48 minute DVD of advanced abs and other advanced tips.

-- Even worse, a lot of the content is for beginners such as a suggestion to use milk jugs to do weight training and even more of the content consists of commercials for unrelated DVD's such as wrestling and martial arts.

-- What did I expect for $29.99, but did not receive?

1- a much more thorough explanation of each movement during the movement.

2- closeups of the muscles contracting during each movement.

3- descriptions of what I should be feeling during each movement.

4- a multiple camera angle production to help me visualize the movement just as in most sports training videos.

5- all of the above with more ""science"" included. I mean geez, this guy advertises that he has a Master's Degree in Exercise Physiology and the DVD is supposed to be ADVANCED!

This video does not even come close to the caliber of presentation and training that one would expect.  :(
