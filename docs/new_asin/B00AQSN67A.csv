5472084,2,B00AQSN67A,The book is 5 stars but the movie doesn't come close.  Read the book before the movie.  So much potential from the book but the movie just doesn't compare.,1353974400,2,155,4.310344827586207
5472085,2,B00AQSN67A,"The girl playing the lead gets on your nerves, since she seems like she's on hyperspeed all of the time. Did Catherine Zeta Jones get a major face lift? And of course Vince Vaugn is in it, he's very funny. I liked seeing him and Bruce, they were great. But I expected more, in general. It was like watching squirrels run around in those little wheels things....I should have waited until it was ALOT cheaper, like in Prime....buyer beware--",1352505600,20,440,4.582278481012659
5472086,1,B00AQSN67A,"I was expecting more from this movie, but it never moved along into anything close to interesting.  Character development was weak, plot was contrived, and the main character, Beth, was not one bit believable.  The actress did a good job, but the writing was awful and sunk the ship.  Ugh.",1352332800,6,289,4.74

5472093,2,B00AQSN67A,"Pretty much a tortured, disjointed mess. Bruce Willis phones in a performance (I suppose we can call it a performance), Catherine Zeta-Zones is woefully under-utilized in a shrill and pointless role, and poor Rebecca Hall is asked to carry this heap forward as the lead. There is an absence of pace and the plot -- to the degree that one may be inferred -- seems to meander aimlessly. Unfortunate.",1457395200,,397,4.768115942028985

5472104,1,B00AQSN67A,"If it were not for the lack of acting ability of the main character 'Beth' played by Rebecca Hall... this could have been a great movie.  She was AWFUL!!!  The possibilities were there.  Bruce Willis, Catherine Zeta Jones, Vince Vaughn... and others.  But the inability of Rebecca to emote any character other than 'ditzy' for her character made this movie unbearable.  Granted... there were other failings in what I can only assume was the editing... because they never even gave us any reason that Beth was so in love with Dink.  Anyway... I hated it.  In my opinion... don't waste your time!!",1455753600,,595,4.7745098039215685

It was so long and all over the place, and the main character was so annoying, we actually couldn't even finish it. I love Bruce Willis, but this was simply awful.",1453766400,,270,3.8392857142857144

5472153,1,B00AQSN67A,"we should have listened to the other reviews.  Terrible cannot even begin to describe this.  We were thinking it can't be that bad with both bruce willis and kathrine zeta jones in it, but we were wrong.  The writing of the script is ridiculous and the lead actress (can't remember her name and don't want to remember it) couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.

5472155,4,B00AQSN67A,"Good movie.  A very attractive, smart young woman, tries a private in home stripping service which quickly fails after having a 45 revolver pointed at her from a crazy customer.  She leaves to find work in Las Vegas, and ends up becoming very good at a particular trade that has different legal boundaries according to which state of the U.S.A she is in.  Having some let downs and an opposition in polar force from her new bosses wife, she gets involved in a relationship with a young man, and moves around after getting into a few situations.  You never know if she is going to end up being totally dumb, or truly successful and genius.  The acting is really good...but what can you expect with Hollywood brand names: Willis, Zeta Jones, and Vince Vaughn.  These actors always deliver in their roles.  A very good movie, that basically never stops.  Enjoy!",1451692800,,858,4.673333333333333
5472156,3,B00AQSN67A,"Three GAMBLING Stars. The humorous film ""Lay The Favorite"" is allegedly based on a true story about a 'private dancer' who goes to Las Vegas with her sights set on nothing more than being a casino cocktail waitress. Through her new free-spirited contacts, she winds up meeting wacky Vegas characters & working for a Vegas 'sharp guy' betting operator, disrupting his life and that of those around her. Starring the likable Bruce Willis, the irrepressible Rebecca Hall who is the actual main character, the great Catherine Zeta-Jones who is almost camouflaged in plain sight until it dawns on you who she is, Vince Vaughn, Joshua Jackson, and Laura Prepon. Hall steals every scene with her 'heart of gold' gal characterization. Directed by Stephen Frears. Recommended mainly for Hall and Zeta-Jones, although the others are fine. Three APPEALING Stars.

5472242,5,B00AQSN67A,"Like in the tradition of Little Orphan Annie and Pippi Longstocking where the female protagonist is young, optimistic, innocently gullible and smiles with baring teeth, the heroine of this movie embarks on a great adventure where she grows up very fast (less than two hours like in most movies).

  First of all, this is a movie where there are shirtless women and our protagonist (played by the lively Rebecca Hall), though is not one of them, is the only one of our characters that in most scenes lives in the classic fashionist philosophy that ""skin is in."" The popular actors in this movie lack the polish from their other movies giving a Claroscuro Visual Effect to allow our protagonist to seem aesthetically fresh and spiritually refreshing for the two-dimensional video camera (known to lie).

  How does this movie open awareness? The girl has no adversity. She starts as a woman-child that makes money by strip-dancing, but when encountering a private client with a gun, he encourages her fear of the danger and she walks away unharmed and unnerved. She goes to her father and tells him that she wants to become a Las Vegas waitress, but he shows no pain and instead is joyfully ecstatic and glorifies her decision. What could make any young woman lose her will to live: a one-sided May-December romance with her married boss (played by the Prince of American Action Films, Bruce Willis) who was hostile to her all the time and, then, told her to get out of his car as he fired her because his wife (played by the elegant and sophisticated Catherine Zeta-Jones) did not want the intimacy in their dynamic relationship at work to replace her marriage with him, turned around -- miraculously her boss asked her to come back to work with him.

  Just before she returns, being fired from her job, our protagonist went to work in a mirror-image position with another individual (played by the talented Vince Vaughn) as her employer, but this time the work is illegal. Our heroine is the midst of drug-abuse and sexual perversions, yet she is unchanged, except for a greed for money which is not portrayed as crass, instead it is seen as a positive, a virtue, with respect to our heroine's growth: defending herself in a man's world.

  The pivoting role comes at the point where she is guided by her happy married friends (Willis and Zeta-Jones) and her nice new young boyfriend (played by the endearing Joshua Jackson) whom is within a decade older than her in a telephone negotiation with a former business associate (played by the powerful actor John Carroll Lynch) reveal his bluff which will grant her five-figure wages held as collateral by her rebound boss played by Vaughn.

  This comedy is a healing movie. Men whom have sisters, mothers and daughters can understand the need for such empowerment of younger women with the ambivalent desire to keep them innocent, optimistic and girly forever without harm to their hearts by other men. Assertiveness in this light is like saying: ""think like a man, act like a middle-aged woman."" There is either a mistake in this kind of male-perspective and/or in the theory that a girl can have her girlish zeal and, without the trauma of being burned, become an ambitious woman. The idea of an ambitious woman that can defend her money-making nitche of livelihood is not as much the main idea of the movie as it is that women have the right to life, liberty and to the pursuit of happiness as clearly as it is stated on The United States Declaration of Independence drafted by Thomas Jefferson.",1389484800,2,3547,4.772875816993464

5472245,2,B00AQSN67A,"Having finished watching Stephen Frears' ""Lay the Favorite,"" I am still unsure what to make of this ""true story"" based on Beth Raymer's memoir of her experiences in the sports-betting industry in Las Vegas. The film has one interesting subject matter, to be sure, and benefits from the fine performance from Rebecca Hall as the spirited heroine, but with its unfocused and disjointed narrative ""Lay the Favorite"" simply doesn't know what it is doing.

An in-home exotic dancer Beth travels from Florida to Las Vegas, dreaming of becoming a cocktail waitress at a casino. As luck would have it, she gets a job working for a bookie Dink Heimowitz (Bruce Willis). Beth, who is good with numbers, becomes a sort of good luck charm for Dink and even gets romantically involved with him before his wife Tulip (Catherine Zeta-Jones) comes back and interferes.

The story may sound interesting. Actually, it is not, jumping from one scene to the next without developing any of the characters. In ""Lay the Favorite"" you will never know anything about the betting industry. That itself is not a big problem if the film allows us to know the characters. Beth meets characters played by Corbin Bernsen, Frank Grillo, Joshua Jackson, John Carroll Lynch, Laura Prepon and Vince Vaughn. The impressive cast does their best, but frankly, we really don't care what happen to these uninteresting cyphers.

The only exception to the mediocre writing is the film's protagonist Beth, who, thanks to Rebecca Hall, remains attractive even when her character is not really credible. Despite her effective acting, ""Lay the Favorite"" seems trying not to entertain us, by omitting or blurring critical points of her story that should be more interesting.",1381449600,,1727,5.052631578947368

5472263,3,B00AQSN67A,"Having worked her way up from second billing roles in movies such as VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA and THE TOWN, Rebecca Hall proves worthy of a lead character in the 2012 feature LAY THE FAVORITE.  She delivers an affecting performance as Beth, a career-searching woman who stumbles into a job in the Las Vegas gambling business.  Not unlike the highs and lows of betting, LAY THE FAVORITE proves a zigzagging account of quick-changing circumstances that can have you living in Florida, Nevada, New York and elsewhere and fall for two different people all in a blink in time, anchored by the talented young actor Hall.

LAY THE FAVORITE is based on an autobiography of the same name.  Assuming this movie version takes no liberties, how funny that scenes depicting female stripping and topless sunbathing are part of Beth's true story as opposed to something made up by the men who write these films.  While Rebecca Hall stays covered up in the sunbathing scene, supporting actor Laura Prepon as fellow Vegas searcher Holly dons only lotion, typical of the risk-taking roles she's done - see the grisly film KARLA.  Along with Prepon, LAY THE FAVORITE benefits from memorable acting by Bruce Willis, Wayne Pre, and a Catherine Zeta-Jones I did not even recognize - she seems to have shrunk.

Oh, and Rebecca Hall risks a little, too, as it is Beth who does the stripping.  This is Rebecca Hall's film, with all due respect to the fine actors working with her.  See LAY THE FAVORITE.",1365379200,2,1478,4.810276679841897

5472267,4,B00AQSN67A,"Beth(Rebecca Hall) is a woman who aspires to be a cocktail waitress in Vegas. She has both brains and looks. She ends up working for Dink, a bookie (Bruce Willis) who she develops feelings. Dink has a jealous wife Tulip (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and a bad side when he loses, which causes Beth to get a job elsewhere. Beth eventually gets into trouble and needs help.

The film is based on a true story, so you didn't know where it is headed. The downfall of the film is that it has a narrow appeal. It is basically a modified chick flick. But it is for chicks who know something about book making. The phrase ""lay the favorite"" means betting against the favorite, i.e. you always take the points and the underdog, you never give points. Bookies make their money by having a balanced book. They need the same amount of money bet on a team as they do against it. They make their money from taking ""the juice"" which is a percentage of the winnings. If the juice is 10% and you bet $50 even money, you will net $40 in return. In order to balance their books, they will have to move money around and make bets with other books or alter the point spread. The point spread has more to do balancing the books then it does the ability of the teams involved which is why it sometimes changes from the beginning of the week to the end of the week. This allows a smart better to straddle his bet. The key to book making is to do the math and bet with your head, not your heart.

It is not an inside look at the gambling industry per se, but it gives you enough of a glimpse that you feel you need to know what is going on in order to enjoy the movie. The most unbelievable aspect of the film is that with all the money Dirk and his wife had, she drank Beefeaters Gin. I enjoyed Bruce Willis in this role. Rebecca Hall was refreshing. A light chick flick for people who know something about gambling.

5472268,2,B00AQSN67A,"Director Stephen Frears (""The Queen"", ""High Fidelity"", ""Dangerous Liaisons"") and screenwriter D.V. DeVincentis (""High Fidelity"", ""Grosse Point Blank"") are back together again for a new film based on the memoirs of American writer and journalist Beth Raymer, a memoir about her experiences in the sex industry, amateur boxing and sports betting.

The film would feature an all-star cast starring Bruce Willis (""Die Hard"" films, ""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Fifth Element""), Catherine Zeta-Jones (""Chicago"", ""The Terminal"", ""Entrapment""), Vince Vaughn (""Wedding Crashers"", ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", ""The Break-Up""), Rebecca Hall (""The Prestige"", ""Frost/Nixon"", ""The Town""), Joshua Jackson (""Fringe"", ""Dawson's Creek"", ""The Skulls""), Laura Prepon (""That 70s Show"", ""October Road"", ""Are You There, Chelsea?"") and Corbin Bernsen (""L.A. Law"", ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", ""Psych"").

VIDEO:

""Lay the Favorite"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  For the most part, picture quality for the film is very good.  Colors are vibrant and really look good outdoors.  Really good detail when it comes to closeups and colors black levels are nice and deep.  I didn't notice any problems with the overall picture quality, no aliasing or artifacts.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Lay the Favorite"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The film is primarily all dialogue driven and dialogue is crisp and clear.  Not a film where you would hear a lot of surround usage but you do hear a bit of the ambiance come into play during the film.  But for a film like this, the lossless soundtrack was appropriate.

Subtitles are in Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Lay the Favorite"" come with the following special features:

  Deleted Scenes - (7:41) A total of 11 deleted scenes.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Lay the Favorite"" may have been a fascinating memoir to read but as a film, I feel that the film tried to incorporate comedy but also be a bit deep at the same time but it just doesn't work.

The primary character of Beth Raymer comes off in the film as a girl who loves her job of pleasing men as an in-home stripper, showing her body and getting what she wants but trying to make money and survive.  When compared to the original memoir, there is a much better story as Beth is trying to balance life at Florida State University and to pay her way through college life, she becomes a stripper.  But because of her not being satisfied or she was fired from these jobs, that's the reason why she moved to Las Vegas.

I really don't know if the real Beth Raymer was anything like the film version of Beth Raymer but the film's first half hour tries to feature Beth as a naive sex kitten that who is a stripper, tries to have sexual relations with her boss and fidns a guy at a casino and has sex with him immediately after they met.

While the film tries to focus on high-stakes gambling, you're left thinking...""really?"".  Not to say that Rebecca Hall's portrayal of Beth Raymer makes her out like an ""airhead"" but perhaps instead of focusing on the sexy side of Beth Raymer, at the beginning of the film, there should have been some glimpse of her brilliance with numbers that is later mentioned in the film.  That Beth is actually a smart young woman, not just some kind of vamp.  Also, unless you have an interest in sports-gambling, the film is really lacking in structure and not that entertaining.

Of course, we eventually see Beth grow in the ranks of high-stake gambling when she moves to New York City and starts to make money for herself.  But by then, I'm wondering to myself, is this really a Stephen Frears film?  And what an unlikely film to find Bruce Willis and Catherine Zeta-Jones in.  But do give the film some credit in the fact that Bruce Willis, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Joshua Jackson and Vince Vaughn made ""Lay the Favorite"" much more of an enjoyable film because they appeared in it.

The Blu-ray release does feature very good PQ and for dialogue-driven film, lossless audio was also good.  And for special features, you get eleven deleted scenes.

Overall, ""Lay the Favorite"" was a film that may have featured a talented director and also featured a cast of big names but unfortunately, with an uninspired screenplay, the characters weren't fully utilized and the film just lacks anything of interest unlike the original memoir that the film was based on. Probably worth a rental but nothing more.",1364601600,,4385,4.863881401617251

This is not a film of depth, but of wit and whirlwind pace.  The story is not told deliberately, but at breakneck speed.  I was pleasantly surprised to see Mr. Frear's name as the director.  This is definitely a one-off film for him, but it is an enjoyable and light-hearted romp.

5472273,3,B00AQSN67A,"Beth (Rebecca Hall) is a dreamer. Moving from her Southern roots to Vegas with dreams of stepping up in life and becoming a cocktail waitress (yes that is her initial ambition) she moves into a low rent motel where she makes friends who give her another option. Rather than be manhandled all day they send her to Dink (Bruce Willis), a professional gambler who bets on any and everything.

Dink Inc. is a business where the odds are always manipulated by the placing of bets in legal form. Not only does this pay Dink well but it helps take care of those who are working for him as well. With a head for numbers, Beth is a natural and soon Dink Inc. is doing well and Beth with it. Now all she has to do is get past Tulip (Catherine Zeta-Jones).

Tulip is Dink's wife and to say she is jealous is an understatement. Then again there have been times when her jealousy was well founded. As Beth begins to fall for Dink and attempt to sway him, Tulip steps in and puts an end to it. Beth loses her job, meets a young man named Jeremy (Joshua Jackson) and its love at first sight. With no reason to stay she plans on going back to New York with Jeremy when he leaves. But Dink is in a slump of bad luck and he thinks Beth was his good luck charm so he convinces her to come back.

Beth's return doesn't increase Dink's luck any more than the rising sun. Within days he tosses her and his whole team out again. Unwilling to wait around another day, Beth heads to New York and Jeremy. Once there she contacts Rosie (Vince Vaughan), a low life illegal bookie she met through Dink, and helps him run his business. Plans are to set up in the Caribbean where gambling is legal with Beth running the show. As always, things don't go as planned.

Soon Beth finds herself and Jeremy with the possibility of going to jail on federal gambling charges. Rosie is no help, a self centered low life who could care less who gets hurt, something Dink warned Beth about when she first met Rosie. Back on top with Tulip convinced there was never anything going on with Beth or the chance that it will, Dink and Tulip head to New York in an attempt to save the day.

The movie is directed by Stephen Frears who made THE GRIFTERS, THE QUEEN and DANGEROUS LIASONS. With those titles to his credit, expectations for this film are high. Unfortunately they don't come close to those other films. That's not to say this film isn't interesting or even fun, but don't have high expectations and you might just enjoy it.

The film is well made and looks top of the line in the production values area. For not being hyped as the hottest thing out of Hollywood, Hall turns in a worthwhile performance and makes her naive character quite believable. Zeta-Jones does a great job as well in a role that doesn't require her to exude sex non-stop for once. Best of all is Willis who gets the chance to play a character that doesn't shoot anyone or blow things up. Sometimes people forget what a good actor he actually is.

While this film isn't Oscar material it does offer a nice evening's entertainment. Based on the memoirs of the real Beth, it might even stir up enough interest in her story to sell a few books. If not it will at least encourage a trip to the library.",1362614400,2,3233,4.333884297520661
5472274,2,B00AQSN67A,"Lay the Favorite takes you to Las Vegas into a small sports gambling enterprise run by Dink (Bruce Willis); however, things aren't always great in the city of Las Vegas when Dink starts losing.  I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of this to review.

Beth (Rebecca Hall) is a stripper who is looking for a different job as her job as a stripper is just too dangerous.  She talks with her dad about moving to Las Vegas to become a cocktail waitress, to which her dad agrees that she should go to Vegas to explore better opportunities.  After arriving to Vegas and looking for a job, the type of job she wants doesn't come around very often.  She talks to some girls at the hotel she is staying at and they suggest that she work for Dink at Dink, Inc.

Dink owns a sports gambling enterprise where he ""lays the favorite"", which means, he bets against the favorite to win in any given event.  Vegas has the odds posted and Dink explains to Beth that he makes his money by betting where Vegas has it wrong.  Beth, even though she was a stripper, seems to be good with numbers and letters, so Dink hires her to work for him.

As Beth starts working for Dink, he starts winning his bets.  Naturally, when winning, Dink is a very happy guy and Beth is captivated by this and she begins to fall in love with Dink; however, Dink is married to Tulip (Catherine Zeta-Jones).  Tulip tells Dink that Beth is getting between them and tells him to get rid of her.  Dink agrees and decides to fire Beth.

Upon her firing, Beth goes out, gets drunk and sleeps with a guy named, Jeremy (Joshua Jackson).  Beth starts spending time with Jeremy, who is an aspiring Journalist.  As Beth spends time away from Dink, he starts losing his bets and loses over $150,000 in just one week alone.  Dink is extremely upset and fires everyone as he does every time he starts to lose; however, when he fires everyone, he makes them all come back to work for him.  Dink comes to terms with his wife on re-hiring Beth.  Dink agrees to let Tulip get a facelift if he can hire Beth to work for him again.  Tulip agrees to this arrangement.  So, Dink goes to Beth's hotel where she is staying and catches her riding up in a car with Jeremy.  She wanted to move to New York with Jeremy, but Dink convinced Beth to stay in Vegas to work for him, which she agrees to do.

Despite hiring Beth again, Dink still keeps losing and he finally shows his true colors to Beth.  After losing for a bit, Dink again fires everyone and tells Beth that he accepts her resignation, even though she did not hand in a resignation letter.  After this stunt, Beth moves to New York to be with Jeremy.

While in New York, Beth looks up Troy Roseland (Vince Vaughn), or, Rosie as some people call him because she came across someone who wanted to do some betting named Dave Greenburg.  Rosie seems to be careless and he runs his operation differently from Dink's, also, running a gambling enterprise like Dink's is also illegal in the state of New York.  Rosie and Dink have a history and Dink has warned Beth about Rosie in the past, but Beth had not listened.

After working at Rosies gambling enterprise in New York, Beth and Rosie move the operation south to the Caribbean where it is legal and name the company A.S.A.P.  While down south, Beth is having a hard time keeping track of all the bets as no one seems to care what is going on and are more concerned with partying rather than making money.  You can clearly see that this is not the operation or place Beth wants to work at.

Dave Greenburg finally lost a bet to Rosie and he owes $75,000.  He calls Beth and tells her that his parole officer found out he was betting and he has all his cell phone numbers.  This was a way for Dave to get out of paying Beth for the debt owed to Rosie.  Beth calls Dink for advice because if Dave doesn't pay up, she doesn't get the $60,000 that she is owed by Rosie.  Dink and his wife both decide to help Beth.

Beth goes back to New York and meets up with Dink and Tulip.  They try to come up with a plan to get Dave to pay Rosie the $75,000.  Beth calls Dave on the phone and realizes that Dave's story about the parole office was made up and no one knows about her and her activities.  While Beth is aggressive on the phone toward Dave to try to get him to pay up, Dave makes a bet to try to win money to pay back.  Beth agrees as she really has nothing to lose is Dave loses the bet anyway.  Finally, everyone is watching the game Dave bet on in the bar and it's toward the end of the game.  Dink is in the other room not watching the game.  Beth finds out that Dink bet with Rosie $70,000 on the same game and Dink can't watch the game because of this.  Beth drags Dink out from the back room and they watch the final moments of the game and the team they bet on won, so everybody won in the end.

Overall, this movie was pretty weak in my opinion.  It really wasn't the movie I expected it to be.  It's not really memorable at any point despite a pretty solid cast.  There were some confusing parts in the film that are better explained in the deleted scenes, but, even then, the deleted scenes really don't help this movie out.  It doesn't really explain how the numbers in gambling work, which would have helped it out a bit.  This was supposed to be a comedy and I didn't really even find any of the movie the least bit funny.  The only good part in the whole movie, if it is worth watching, is Rebecca Hall wearing skimpy clothes.  Other than that, it's probably worth one watch and you'll forget about it.  My final rating for this is a 2/5 stars only because I still have respect for Bruce Willis.

The films distributor is attempting to promote it as a comedy, but it isn't one.  Nor is it a drama.

So, what is it?

For lack of a better term, Ill call it an interesting light drama about the world of gambling.

Adapted from the best-selling memoir by Beth Raymer, the story centers on Beth (Rebecca Hall), a former Florida stripper who travels with her dog to Las Vegas and winds up working for Dink (Bruce Willis), the owner of a small-time sports gambling enterprise.

Beth and Dink soon discover that she is good with numbers, and the business begins to thrive until Dinks jealous wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) arrives on the scene, forcing the younger woman to quit Vegas and travel to New York with her new boy friend (Joshua Jackson) and go to work for a shady gambler (Vince Vaughn).  Unfortunately, in New York, gambling is illegal, and before long, Beth must call on Dink to help her out of a sticky situation that can land her in prison for a long stretch.

Stephen Frears directed this entertaining film.

The Blu-Ray release from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes several deleted scenes.

5472278,3,B00AQSN67A,"Up front you need to know that Vince Vaughn and Bruce Willis are two of my favorite guys to see on the big screen.  After reading the horrible reviews of this movie I just had to see it, and I'm not disappointed that I did.

It is true that this is not exactly a polished movie.  It screams B-Movie production, even though it is estimated that they spent $26 MILLION on production.  According to IMDB it grossed just about $20,000 in the USA.  A bad bet, no doubt about it, but that doesn't mean it's not a fun movie to watch.

The story seems so far fetched, you'll wonder who came up with it.  Crazy enough, it is based upon a book by Beth Raymer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lay-the-Favorite-A-Story-About-Gamblers/dp/0385526466/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lay the Favorite: A Story About Gamblers</a>&nbsp;which is supposedly based on her own experiences.

The story revolves around Beth, who moves to Vegas to find herself.  She ends up working for a professional gambler, Dink, played by Bruce Willis.  They have a falling out, she hooks up with this pal Rosie, played by Vince Vaughn, who is a bookie in New York.  Somewhere in there she meets nice guy Jeremy, played by Joshua Jackson, whom she dates.  She's infatuated with Dink, but he is already married to Tulip, yes, Tulip, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones.

Now for me personally, I couldn't get past Rebecca Hall's extremely irritating performance and unbearably overplayed goofy and gangly presence.  The normally posh English Hall seems to be overcompensating in playing a ""fun"" oversexed American. And it is a travesty to see the normally regal and incredibly beautiful Catherinne Zeta-Jones reduced to playing a needlessly jealous, orange haired and orange tanned, face lift finagling character. While there is no reason for the C Z-J character to be jealous of a girl that has nothing going for her but the fact that she is temporarily in her 20s, although she acts like she is twelve, this main character IS so out of line with her husband that the wife is entitled to insist her husband remove the plotting newbie from the business.  But, judging from the swelling music, I get the feeling the audience is supposed to sympathize with, even root for, this dumb and manipulatively clueless character. Sorry but I don't.

I think with movies like this, most of the problems boil down to a weakly constructed plot and poor casting.  (I could see maybe Jessica Simpson as the bimbo, and Meg Ryan as the plastic surgery addicted insecure wife. )",1507075200,,1426,4.776422764227642
