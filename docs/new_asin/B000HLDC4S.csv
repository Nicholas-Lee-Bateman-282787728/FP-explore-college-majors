8140271,1,B000HLDC4S,"The title gave me low expectations. It didn't quite make the ""so bad it is good"" category, but managed to get into a ""so bad it is bad"" although some might place it in the former category. The plot consists of vampires with chainsaws (why chainsaws I don't know, they can kill a guy with their bare hands). They are in battle with the ""Outlanders"" who are aliens with fluorescent green blood, a one trick pony from film academy.

Quinn (Adam Abram) gets caught up in the middle of the fight while lamenting the lost of of his wife Rhonda (Deb Lee) to Jim-Bob (Jed Ivie). He bores us with his dry monotone dialogue used as a way to make this a film for the blind, perhaps the best way to ""watch"" this production as I could imagine something much better than what was on the screen.

The acting was horrible. There was no chainsaw safety. No gloves, eye googles, and chicks running with chainsaw. Now the only real time a chainsaw operated was on a cut away to cut a piece of wood, otherwise the chain never moved, we just heard varying degrees of noise. These chainsaws start without a pull cord, at a touch of a button...except they don't really operate, they just make noise. I also don't understand why you operate a chainsaw when attempting to sneak up on the non-deaf.

The poorly shot chainsaw scenes provided for some unintentional entertainment, but not a reason to watch a film, unless you a film on what not to do in a chainsaw film. Dry, boring, poorly acted.

8140273,2,B000HLDC4S,"I knew the movie was low budget and so did not expect much.  My daughters school teacher was in the movie and wanted to see her in it. Hey, every actor/actress starts somewhere.  My daughter just wanted to see her teacher in action and yes I only let her see the parts I felt appropriate.",1218326400,,288,4.218181818181818
8140274,3,B000HLDC4S,"When I first heard about ""Vampire Chicks with Chainsaws"" I definitely wanted to see this movie.  I like chainsaw slasher horror films, and the ""chicks"" part was an added bonus.  So I tried finding it in Blockbuster or Hollywood as a rental, but no luck.  Then I found out I can own it on Amazon for $10.

Well, I got about what I paid for...

Yes, the movie has chicks in revealing leather costumes and chainsaws.  But once you get past that there is little else to the movie.  The human characters are stereotypical rednecks.  Half of the main character Quinn's lines are him telling us what he thinks.  The acting is mediocre, and half the film is just fight scenes.

Also a bit of a letdown was all that was on the DVD was the film and the trailer.  No blooper reels, no commentary, no interviews the cast or crew.  The DVD doesn't even have a ""scene selector"" feature, which was a bit annoying.  A lot of potential on a DVD disk was wasted.

Also, guns were as often, if not more often, than chainsaws as a weapon.  It could have been equality titled ""Vampire Chicks with Guns,"" but that doesn't sound as attractive.

However, it is true that it puts a new wrinkle on whole Vampire mythos.  That I think is the films strong point.  It is also true that there is no nudity or sex.  It is bloody, but not as nauseatingly gory as a film like ""The Evil Dead.""  It also has some pretty funny one and two liners.

So if you want a well developed, twisted horror movie like ""Saw"" this isn't it.  If you want something out of the ordinary and don't mind a low budget, low quality film, you just might get your money's worth.",1168473600,,1620,4.2947019867549665
8140275,4,B000HLDC4S,"I really enjoyed this movie. The cinematography is classic B movie, but better. Over all it looks pretty good. Lots of fantastic one liners. Some of the action gets a little redundant, but you really can't go wrong with a bunch of hot vampire chicks with chainsaws.

Despite what you may infer from a B movie titled Vampire Chicks with Chainsaws, there is no nudity or sex which I consider a plus.

Look else where for the Oscar winning picture of the year, or buy this for the love of original and fun movies!",1167004800,,510,4.414893617021277
