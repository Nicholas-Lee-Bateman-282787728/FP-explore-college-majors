8479854,5,B005MVUID6,I was greatful and surprised to find Angels dvd popped up on my e/mail from amazon. Angel has been my guitar hero. Especially for his Giuliani rossiniane recording. This dvd is truly a must have for guitar students. He covers a lot of material on technique and gives some excellent warm up exercises for maintaining strength and fluency of ones hands. Angel expresses his love for the guitar and love of music and his journey in uniting the two to one. I was really impressed by his true humanity. One would like to meet such a person. I wish he had spent more time on the tremolo and how he conceives it. And  exercises to develop this technique especially from such a master. Thank tou Angel for producing such a thoughtful dvd.,1379894400,7,730,4.53030303030303
8479855,5,B005MVUID6,"I don't have any delusions as an adult student of classical guitar. My goal is to enjoy learning to play as a journey rather than and end goal because there is no end. So I don't usually buy instructional DVDs.

I have been fortunate enough to personally meet Celin & Pepe Romero. They are truly wonderful people. Therefore when I saw this Angel Romero DVD I bought it without hesitation, and I'm glad I did.

First, the production values are top notch. The video is very well photographed and the sound is loud and clear. The advice given by Angel Romero on this DVD is presented in a very one-on-one style. You get some personal stories, performances, and lots of technical and philosophical advice. The lessons are more general than specific which in my opinion is appropriate here. I have tried to but never succeeded at progressing on guitar until I got a private teacher. And for me at least, the general nature of the information provided here is worth more than specific technical information on how to play. I don't think you can really learn an instrument properly from a video.

That being said, I watch this DVD regularly for inspiration and perspective.",1352246400,13,1166,4.705882352941177
