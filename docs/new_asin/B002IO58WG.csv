8371066,5,B002IO58WG,"This is probably the best introduction to learning to surf there is on DVD.  I've been teaching kids to surf for a couple of decades and I loan them this video to watch both before and after the lessons.  I have bought many copies of Corky Carroll's  production as a result.  To be honest, no one can really teach anyone else to actually surf; they just get them started in the process of teaching themselves.  Corky's Carroll's ""Learn to Surf"" DVD is a good tool to use towards that end.  It deals with proper board selection, basic surfing techniques, and safety.  Emphasis is given to having fun and being safe.",1500595200,,614,4.527272727272727
