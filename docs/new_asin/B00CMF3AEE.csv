8583383,3,B00CMF3AEE,"This is an odd story involving reincarnation, pedophilia, and a serial killer. Oddly Eric Roberts does not play the creepy serial killer or a pedophile. Attorney Robert Sterns (Eric Roberts) is approached by ex-gf Carina (Sunny Mabrey) and her patient Simon (Christian Traeumer) concerning  information he has about a serial killer. After undergoing reincarnation therapy, 10 year old Simon, a terminal cancer patient, has detailed information about specific murders. Robert is a skeptic, but the accuracy of the information cannot be argued with.

The movie turns into a cat and mouse game with our trio aided by a former porn producer search for the killer in race against time.  Writer/ director Zsolt Bcs plays a minor role as a pedophile.

This movie was made in the part of Berlin everyone speaks English. The film had  an ""Ed Wood""  incident where a it is night in one scene and bright daylight in the next.  It also contains still photos of what appear to be underage naked children, slightly more graphic than a old ""Blind Faith"" album cover.

While the mystery of the film holds your interest (gives you minor clues)it is edited or filmed in such a way that makes you feel confused as it seeming heads off in different directions.
