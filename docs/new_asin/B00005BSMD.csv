7937950,1,B00005BSMD,"Don't waste your money or time on these!! NONE of them play properly (they freeze & skip!!) so it's not worth spit. Sadly, this is one of the best Daredevil stories but I'd settle on the tpb/hc version instead. Fortunately we now have the superb motion comics from Marvel Knights & they look & sound much more superior. And best of all, they play smoothly without any hitches!! But this? This is crap. You've been warned.",1377820800,,421,4.552631578947368
7937951,5,B00005BSMD,"My ONLY 'problem' with this movie is that some of the diologue is delivered slowly - other than that it's amazing!

It used to take me 3 days to read the graphic novel - now I can watch it it 3 HOURS! It's a shame there are none following this DVD as I would like to start collecting them!

Hopefully they'll do the same as this at DC with Kevin S,moiths GREEN ARROW too cos it rocks! Well worth the cash and more!",1160352000,,414,3.9759036144578315
7937952,5,B00005BSMD,"Forget the comparisons whether the movies are as good as the comics. Because these are the comics! Taking the actual art and story from the comic and adding character voices, music, and effects, what you get is a quality running superhero comic movie. Great introduction to the world of comics for those looking to introduce their kids to comics. A reading tool as well because the dialogue is shown on the screen as the movie plays. Amazon carrys all the Intec digital comic books.",1081382400,6,482,4.75
