7999165,3,B0000CEROU,"Roger Corman, called here the ""Master of Horror,"" worked in many genres. His earliest directorial efforts were westerns. Besides fright films, at one time or another Corman tried his hand at comedy, drama, war and adventure, sci-fi, swords and sandals and motorcycle films. He also turned out women in prison, anti-establishment and ""nurse"" movies. If there's one common thread in Roger Corman's body of work, it's SEXY WOMEN. Some biographers have speculated that Corman had an adolescent's fascination with the female form, thus his movies (no matter the variety) are almost always populated with buxom and beautiful babes.

CONTENTS of MASTER OF HORROR 4 Movie PACK:

Cult favorite A BUCKET OF BLOOD is an early attempt by Corman at combining horror and comedy. This is the story of an anonymous coffee house busboy who gains notoriety among the beatnik set with his lifelike sculpture of a cat. No one knows the artist simply covered a dead animal with plaster. When his new fans demand more statues, people begin to mysteriously disappear.

Corman scripted ""THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS"" and helped John Ireland with directing duties. This was Roger's first film work and is NOT a horror movie but a rather pedestrian race car/love triangle movie. Instantly forgettable.

LAST WOMAN ON EARTH, filmed in Puerto Rico, is the story of three skindivers who resurface only to discover everyone on the island (and perhaps the world) is dead.  Featured in the small cast is Corman screenwriter Robert Towne.

Four hard-edged women's prison escapees commandeer a small boat and its wealthy owner for a trip through treacherous swampland. Their goal: a hidden stash of diamonds. The weakest of this bunch.

BRENTWOOD's 4-fers are nicely priced movie bundles. Video and sound quality of these digitally unrestored public domain films is generally fine. Discs are dual-side recorded.
