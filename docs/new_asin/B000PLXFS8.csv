8192346,5,B000PLXFS8,I highly recommend Yogi Ramdev's pranayama dvd. He is very well known in India for curing millions of people and the pranayama is taught in such a way that can easily be followed,1490227200,,178,4.424242424242424
8192347,5,B000PLXFS8,good overview of basic pranayama practices. English translation is acceptable but not great. The teacher is enthusiastic on the subject. And he seems to be an expert.his teachings are all over YouTube. The DVD is inexpensive and so it may be in the budget for most people. An OK place to start your Pranayama practice.,1418083200,,318,4.8
8192348,1,B000PLXFS8,"The DVD is so bad that it hangs every few words. I can't rate the content because I have had so much difficulty playing the DVD. Based upon the other reviews, I must have gotten a bad DVD. I'll see about getting a replacement and then update this review.",1352851200,,254,4.204081632653061
8192349,5,B000PLXFS8,"good dvd, but not too in-depth. contains breathing exercises and some basic postures for spine, arms, etc. does not have more difficult yoga poses so this is good if you just want the basics. if you want something that is more fitness-oriented then this dvd won't fit that criteria.",1302480000,5,282,4.775510204081633
8192350,3,B000PLXFS8,"If you want to see the videos search on Swami Ramdev pranayam at YouTube to find his videos and see samples before purchasing. If still available, you can see them for free at his website so this DVD just provides a convenient collection you can view when ready. Not all the videos at YouTube may have an English translation. The part of the instruction of this video I wondered about is that he advocates using the lungs only when doing his version of pranayama while other pranayama/yoga materials I have encountered use belly and/or belly and lung breathing and not totally lung breathing. I'm not sure if belly and/or lung breathing makes a difference as long as you are breathing in deeply, exhaling completely, paying attention to the breath and doing it an even rhythm. I don't claim to be an expert in this area, but I am interested in learning more about breathing techniques and healing. Also, at his website Swami Ramdev claims that pranayama, sometimes in conjunction with herbs, which are sold via the website, can cure about anything, baldness, failing eyesight, AIDS, etc. I do believe that ""healing"" the spirit/mind can sometimes bring about healing or even a cure of physical ailments, but these are large claims to make. The video quality and voice over are okay so you should be able to follow along with the instruction. It's nice to see a live demonstration of the breathing techniques over static photographs or line illustration in a book; however, there are probably better DVDs out there on breathing.",1301443200,12,1526,4.850574712643678
8192351,5,B000PLXFS8,"Pranayama is very essential part of Yoga. As the experts say, after Asana practice is stabilized, Pranayama is the next step. I have seen in many western Yoga Schools the curriculum is limited to Asanas. Obviously, it depends on what benefits one needs from Yoga. Pranayama deals more with mind via breath. The idea is that certain patterns of thoughts lead to certain patterns of breaths e.g. anger leads to fast breathing, relaxing to slow, deep breathing etc. It is believed that the reverse is true also i.e. controlling breath controls thoughts and emotions in the mind. The Yogis studied these and came up with patterns of breaths that can affect the mind in positive ways. So the very first benefit of Pranayama is stress free living. It is also a very good technique for deepening your meditation practice. Swami talks about many health benefits in the video as well.
I found this DVD in an Indian Store and picked it up out of curiosity. Baba Ramdev is very popular in India for organizing Yoga camps and I heard some of his healing stories using Yoga techniques. I was only interested the Pranayama part. I have learned many years ago from an expert in India and reaped the benefits. It is best to learn from a teacher but the video can be the next best thing in today's age.
I won't give five stars to recording and editing quality. The techniques are well explained by Swami. These are done in traditional Indian way. Although I knew them, I was able to pick up a few good pointers from the video. Pranayama are taught in basic form here e.g. the Purak-Rechak-Kumbhak(breath in-out-hold) ratios are not discussed, Pranayama focusing on certain body parts, done with mantras etc are not part of this DVD. So I think this is a beginner's video. This is the daily routine given on Swami's website Patanjali Yogpeeth for beginners.
1. Bhastrika  5 mins  2 cycles
2. KapalBhati  5 mins  3 cycles

 I would recommend starting with short times and extending with more practice and time. Meet an expert to fine-tune. Overall, a good starting point for those who are interested.",1296777600,15,2237,4.66412213740458
8192352,5,B000PLXFS8,"This DVD is very good.  The practices demonstrated herein constitute the ""Pawanmuktasana Series"".  It appears to be a simple series to perform, however, its benefits are beyond belief.

I am surprised to note that this series is not mentioned in any of the ""standard"" yoga books, such as ""Light on Yoga"" and others.  The only classic text that describes this series in great detail is the book published by the Bihar School of Yoga, authored by the great sage Swami Satyananda Saraswati, titled ""Asana, Pranayama, Mudra, Bandha"".  Between this text and the DVD you have all the necessary material to start a great journey of yoga!

I found this DVD after I had been practicing for 5 years!  I only wish I had started with this DVD and the above text book.  I recommend this DVD very strongly.

This is a two part DVD, one deals with asanas and the other with pranayama!  Both are done very well, simple yet yielding powerful results within a short time.  Dedicated practice is the key!  You will definitely succeed!  If you practice the series for two weeks, you will be transformed into a new person, and if you practice it for a month -- you will be walking on air!

Unfortunately the production quality of the DVD is not at par with other DVDs on the market.  The Swami does not speak English and the translator is not always in sync with the model demonstrating the asanas.  However, these are minor inconveniences, since the content is very effective.  I used it to learn the various asanas in the series and then practice on my own by increasing (or decreasing) the repetition count.  It is a great start towards building up a pranayama practice too!",1223164800,37,1656,4.632302405498282
