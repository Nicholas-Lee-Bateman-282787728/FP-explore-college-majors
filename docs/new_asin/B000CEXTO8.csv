8098572,5,B000CEXTO8,"The Tai Chi Fighting Set is to me, a student of Yang and Chen Tai Chi, the most important intermediary step in Tai Chi training. This is where the student really begins to develope his/her understanding of why Tai Chi is the ""Grand Ultimate Fist"". Master Yang's DVD is by far, a superior piece of training material for getting the ""combat mind set"" of this set in Chinese internal martial arts. Or for just getting the form down well.",1285545600,8,434,4.506329113924051
8098573,4,B000CEXTO8,"This DVD is most useful when used in conjunction with in-person instruction from your taiji teacher.  Trying to learn strictly from this DVD seems as if it could introduce poor technique.  I would expect a taiji teacher would suggest learning solo ""empty hand"" forms, and partner practice via ""push hands"" rudiments before tackling the fighting set.

The content is quite thorough, showing the sections of the fighting set at different speeds, and analyzed by the teacher in tremendous detail.  Having the entire fighting set available is also useful for careful review.",1273536000,9,570,5.230769230769231
8098574,5,B000CEXTO8,I purchased many DVD's trying to seek a practical application of TaiJi.  Some are in English and some in French and some in Chinese.  This DVD shows a continuous application both in a teaching mode and actual fighting speed in English.  Moves and counter moves are in fluid succession.  I personally think the DVD is worth the money.  Dr. Yang does a thorough job of explaining the Taiji fighting concept and  application (defensively and offensively).,1253059200,5,452,4.96
8098575,5,B000CEXTO8,"This DVD is informative to all styles of Tai Chi.
My review won't be as long as the other reviews, but I wanted to say that this is very well produced DVD. This DVD is awesome.

I had always wondered how Tai Chi would be applied to fighters of other styles and this DVD clearly shows applications to common forms of attack.  In the Fighting Set form common attacks and Tai Chi attacks are demonstrated.  However, what is missing is showing Tai Chi defenses against weapons that one is likely to encounter, such as folding knives and guns.  Other than that this DVD is excellent.

In this DVD the fighting set is broken down into sections for you to learn one section at a time.  And the sections are broken down into patterns.  His two senior students, who have been practicing this form for 3 to 5 years demonstrate the patterns.  And then Dr Yang explains it and common mistakes that beginners make, and while he is explaining he will re-demonstrate the patterns.  And then has the students re-demonstrate the form.  It is all very well demonstrated and explained.

The photography and DVD menu selection are also very good.
You do not have to know the Tai Chi form to benefit from this DVD, although being familiar with the postures will be helpful.
Also viewing this will be helpful with your form practice as you will have a better understanding of how the form works; and how and why you should position your body.

Also, I thought this was much easier to understand than the book. But after watching this DVD I went back to the book and it made more sense to me. Seeing the applications in motion on a DVD is really helpful.

I recommend this for anybody that wants to do Tai Chi beyond just copying their teacher.",1251676800,5,1721,4.495176848874598
8098576,5,B000CEXTO8,"The form on this DVD is something I had neverheard of. In fact, I was not aware that such a thing existed. It is a 2-person matching set for Tai Chi combat. Dr. Yang teaches each move one by one, with detailed applications, as one person attacks, the other defends, and then counterattacks, continuously in a beautifully flowing 'battle'. It teaches advanced concepts of neutralizing, sticking, adhering, and how to avoid double-weighting. Dr. Yang says that even beginners should view and study this form to better understand the true meaning of Taijiquan, and that you may begin to train it after you've learned any Tai Chi form, or basic Push Hands.

Really nice stuff, and the DVD is very detailed, with lots of extras.",1146614400,22,723,4.830645161290323
