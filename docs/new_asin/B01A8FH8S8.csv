8746689,5,B01A8FH8S8,"I finally got a Blu-Ray player and was able to watch this fantastic concert.  Aside from BabyMetal, Wagakki Band is the most original and innovative music group to ever come out of Japan.  Their music is a fusion of traditional Japanese music, right down to the instruments and singing style, and modern rock.  All the musicians are masters of their instruments and the lead singer has a superb, powerful voice.  They also know how to put on a great live show which is why this concert is a pure joy to watch and listen to. The set also includes two music CDs of the entire concert and a nice little photo book.",1484352000,,611,4.428571428571429
