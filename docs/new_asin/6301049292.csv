They leave the big city to find a summer retreat where they might get a gig at a local bar. During the summer. Jennie falls in love with the owner of the bar, Martin (Liam Neeson), a man old enough to be her father. Their fling hits the rocks when Jennie walks in on a female lover of Martin's, (Deborah Harry), causing Jennie to question whether this is an adolescent infatuation or if Martin does in fact have feelings for her. This also propels the group into deciding whether to quit their summer gig and head home.
Originally this film was a vehicle for Justine Bateman just coming out of the spotlight of Family Ties. But when Julia Roberts achieved a small degree of fame, the studio repackaged it as Girls of Summer and put Julia Robert's name on the artwork. As Julia Roberts was merely a supporting actress, incidental to the film, they eventually repackaged it as the original Satisfaction starring Justine Bateman.

 I saw this movie 27 years after it was made.  When I saw that Johanna Ray
 was the casting director (now a defunct title), I knew there was a 99%
 chance I would like this film and I liked it very much.  It has a very good
 script by Charles Purpura and the direction by Joan Freeman was excellent.

 I don't know who the actual musicians were that played the wonderful
 arrangements (another plus in the film) of ""C'mon Everybody"", ""Knock on
 Wood"", ""Lies"" and ""Mystery Dance"", but I am sure of one thing.  The only way
 I'll be convinced that Trini Alvarado wasn't playing the drums in this movie
 is if she told me to my face.  Britta Phillips had all the funny lines and
 was convincing as the lead guitarist and she was also a foil for Julia
 Roberts' character, as well as someone who knew how to make friends with a
 hostile dog.

 Justine Bateman was convincing as the lead singer for Mystery, but her
 problem, and I make no judgment here, of entering a relationship with a man
 old enough to be her father is questionable, but the heart wants what the
 heart wants.  Without her, however, there would be no band.

 This was a solid movie and I could tell everyone worked very hard to make it
 convincing.

 A note about the songs: I never thought that anyone would or could top Nancy
 Sinatra's rendition of ""Lies"", but this group did.  Eddie Cochran's ""C'mon
 Everybody"" and Elvis Costello's ""Mystery Dance"" were overshadowed by what
 Jennie Lee's band did to them.  The Rolling Stones' ""Satisfaction"" is a
 standalone arrangement and while I like both, I have to give the edge to
 Jennie Lee and Mystery's version, as performed at the end of the movie.

 For a rating, depending on how one rates movies, mine are as follows:

 9 out of 10
 4 out of 5 stars
 Thumbs up

 The reason the first two aren't perfect scores is two fold.  One, there is a
 rat running across the bottom of the screen from right to left, as viewed,
 near the end of the band's performance of ""Lies"" and two, during the fight
 scene that followed shortly thereafter, where were the bouncers and why did
 the band have to take on Bunny Slotz's gang alone?

 Those two reasons weren't enough to cause me to dislike the film.  I was
 entertained by it and that is the reason I gave it high marks.",1430524800,,2585,4.444924406047516

319461,5,6301049292,"I've loved this movie since I was young enough to not care what was corney and wound up growing up to not care what people considered corney as long as i liked it.  Ive never though this movie was corney but people seem to think that it is.  I think it's fun, eventful and well casted.  Being an 80's kid (one of the best times to grow up.  oh man do i miss it)i was a big family ties fan so justine batemans awesome.  this movie was right above my maturity level so of course i had to see it.
  because of this movie i became a huge trini alvarado fan and went on to watch stella and a number of her other movies.  I love mooch, shes so different from anything else she ever played before.  Britta Phillips was great as Billy and believable.  Unfortionatly i never saw her in anything else other than Jem and the Rockers.  Julia Roberts is great but she really wasn't given a huge role to work with.
  One of the best things about this movie is the music.  Justine Bateman singing ""Talk to Me"" is still one of my favorite movie performances.  ""Iko Iko"", ""Mr Big Stuff"" and of course their cover of the rolling stones ""Satisfaction"".  This movies total kick back on the couch with a 6 pack and a pizza stay at home fun.
  Dont worry about it being outdated. Get it.  Its great and its cheap.  Ive never thought of this movie as corney.  Its 80s but it deals with alot of things from trying to find yourself, that friend that you cant get through to that just won't quit getting loaded, poverty, and trying to be an honest car theft and yet the other car thefts just won't get out of your way.

319543,4,6301049292,"Update December 3, 2016

My old review stunk.  I gave this movie 2 stars and hated it.  Now I really like it.  Here's a better review:

You know Satisfaction isn't what I expected.  Well I suppose that's not completely true.  I knew it would focus on a group of rock stars (in this case female) with aspirations trying to make it big, but I didn't realize the story would focus considerably less on the actual singing and performing and more on the romantic side of things.

It's about four female rock stars not only forming a group and trying to find success, but also discovering their own romance.  Even if they might not be searching for romance, it found them!  While exploring love they gradually begin to change.  It's a different and equally satisfying change of story from the same ol' cliched ""rock star makes a splash, rock star impresses manager, rock star parties hard, rock star eventually fails"" routine.

Justine Bateman is the star of the group.  She might portray herself as a rebel, but only to an extent.  She's also a determined and confident young woman.  When she falls in love with Liam Neeson, a nightclub manager who allows the band to get their much needed break, she gradually sets aside her singing career and focuses on a relationship with him.  And wow, I'm used to Liam rescuing his daughter from thugs, shooting bad guys and safely landing airplanes, so a more laidback role falling in love with a young rock star is certainly a change!

And Justine... is she really singing?  And did she come up with that song she performed for Liam on the back deck?  Because that was a fantastic song and she lets loose a *very* powerful voice, especially appealing and more powerful when performing this same song on stage in front of the crowd later on.  Love the song, and love her role overall.

She's hardly the only memorable character though.  You have Julia Roberts who is honestly one of the least impressive of the girls and feels out of place.  She really doesn't belong in a movie like this.  Her role felt wrong in my opinion.  She's not much of a rock star type but it was just an early role in her remarkable career, so I guess I don't mind.  She's mostly involved in the heavy romance and feels insignificant anyway.

Trini Alvarado is probably my second favorite of the girls.  She's the one who tries the hardest to be a rebel and portrays the best rock star of the girls.  She HATES wearing pretty dresses and being lady-like, though even she succumbs and falls in love with the only male member of the band (played by Scott Coffey, who was a classical keyboard player across the street from Justine's apartment and originally felt that joining a rock band was sort of beneath him).

As much as I like the Rolling Stones, this version of ""Satisfaction"" based on Justine's high range and fantastic vocals makes it a more memorable version if you ask me.  Less focus on the repetitive guitar riff looping over and over since it's pushed to the back to allow Justine's vocals to shine (sorry Stones fans!)  Perhaps the only complaint with this movie is that the song selection is pretty slim for the concert portions, but it's not like there's a lot of concerts taking place anyway.

Some of the humor's really good too.  When the girls break into Liam's house he's not exactly quick to call the cops.  He sort of plays with the girls and teases them (no not in that way) before calling the cops since he's so tired he doesn't really care, haha.  He makes them sleep in his garage after the girls reveal they're there for the band tryouts, but arrived 14 hours early.  Loved the one time appearance by Debbie Harry.  She interferes with the growing relationship between Liam and Justine.  Debbie's amazing!  Too bad she doesn't sing with the band.  She wasn't written into the story for singing though.

The volleyball scene is really strange.  Almost like a Benny Hill chase!  The band knows nothing about volleyball or swimming even though they spend most of their time at the beach, so when they fall over each other while competing in a game of beach volleyball... it's odd to say the least!  I enjoy the doberman pincher dog, even though the dog's first appearance reveals how vicious these type of dogs can be.  And I only guessed Justine was Jason Bateman's sister.  Awesome!

Overall, highly enjoyable.  Keep in mind Satisfaction is intended more for teenage viewers becoming adults than it is for those looking to see female rock stars letting loose and rocking out.",1285977600,,4512,4.629255989911727
319544,3,6301049292,"I have enjoyed this movie since it first came out.  I'm from SC, near the Charleston beaches, and the fact that this was filmed on Isle of Palms just makes the whole movie even cooler.  I went to the original Windjammer (where the band in the move played) before Hurricane Hugo took it out in 1989.  They built a bigger and better Jammer, but the old one has never been forgotten.  I got this movie for my dad's birthday.  He just loves Julia Roberts.",1245024000,6,451,4.321428571428571

 You get a movie about an all girl cover band that seems really popular for their area. Imagine Julia Roberts with big 80s hair pretending to play bass! You get Justine Bateman as the singer, and of course she pretends to be a serious artist with lots of problems. But in the movie she is your typical rich, white girl who has no right to complain about anything.

Do yourself a favor and watch it.",1240790400,,625,4.065040650406504
319546,5,6301049292,"Seeing a couple of terrific actors at a very early stage of their career was a real treat.  And I believe some reviewers do not take into account the outstanding singing performance of Justine Bateman--especially in the final, signature title song ""Satisfaction.""  People trying to take this movie a bit too seriously should simply kick back and enjoy it for what it is.",1239408000,2,370,4.857142857142857
319547,2,6301049292,"If you've always suspected that combining elements from ""Times Square"" (1980), ""Josie and the Pussycats"" (2001), and ""Summer of `42"" (1971) would be an extremely bad idea, look no further than ""Satisfaction"" for confirmation.  Although ""Times Square"" fans (the film from which ""Satisfaction"" steals the most) will frequently cringe during the viewing experience, the fusion of these three films is not a totally bad idea.

It did give Trini Alvarado, eight years later, a chance to play the tough girl Nicky Marotta part, the character she played against in ""Times Square"".  Although she plays her less like Robin Johnson did and more like Tara Reid's Cybil in ""Girl"" (1998).  An underrated actress, Alvarado carries too much baggage (nice girl type-casting and too sweet a face) into this role to even begin to sell it.  A much better idea that might have saved the film would have been for her and co-star Justin Bateman to switch parts.  Bateman is capable of looking mean and is really too limited as an actress for a part with the degree of dimensionality of Jennie Lee.

I've never quite grasped the popularity of Julia Roberts but for her mega-fans ""Satisfaction"" is a must see.  The script doesn't give her much to work with but it is an opportunity to see her when she was this young.  Of course there is some retrospective perverse amusement to be had at the idea of Roberts and Liam Neeson  playing second banana's to the talent challenged Bateman,

Britta Phillips' career rocketed forward from this film with 65 episodes as the voice of the title character in ""Jem and the Holograms"".  Nice voice, excellent casting choice, and a cute performance; she and Chris Nash at least manage to give a fair amount of authenticity to the production.

Director Joan Freeman of Streetwalkin'  (1985) fame has never done another feature; after these casting decisions it is not hard to figure out why.  Maybe she is just another innocent victim of an Aaron Spelling production, she clearly was not a budding Allan Moyle.  Likewise Screenwriter Charles Purpura; although his script is no worse than a lot of stuff currently getting feature treatment and the outdated slang no doubt sounded less lame in 1988.

Although full of terrible music (covers of classic rock tunes performed slightly worse than when arranged for your high school band's halftime show) the film did connect with its primary target audience, discontented teenage girls who were not so disillusioned that they could not still get off on an identification jag with a group of squeaky clean girl rockers.  Those looking for a more real ""growing up is painful "" experience should stick with ""Times Square"" and the more recent ""Pretty Persuasion"".

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1237334400,,2761,4.922246220302376
319548,5,6301049292,"I ordered the ""Satisfaction"" DVD for my granddaughters' Weekend with Grandma. It arrived very quickly...three days after I placed the order!

319549,4,6301049292,"Yes, it is a good movie but what is important is the performance by Scott Coffey that lifts it out of the doldrums and raises it to cinema lightning.  Whenever he appears, you can't watch anyone else, including such certified scene stealers as Julia Roberts and Trini Alvarado.  Trini, as the car thief Mooch, gets to have some nice romantic moments with Nicky, the young pianist who could have led the Van Cliburn lifestyle but instead has opted out to discover his heterosexuality on the beaches of Charleston, SC, playing volleyball and managing to work up the nerve to kiss the abrasive, sociopathic Mooch with his gorgeous, plumlike lips.  As Jennie Lee, the woman who sets the plot in motion with her scheme to leave the rough city and have a rocking beach party summer, Justine Bateman is worth every penny the producers paid her.

I can't personally imagine how she ever missed being not only the number one movie star in the world, but also a pop singer on the order of Joan Jett or Kelly Clarkson.

She sings everything with conviction, and when the plot requires her to stumble on a song, she does it equally well.  And she doesn't stop rocking as long as she's in front of a mike.

The plot is sort of about Liam Neeson who used to be somebody in the rock world; his beach home is decorated with gold records documenting his storied career, and he's burnt out since his wife died, but along comes one young girl who gets him to write that one song again.  JUST LIKE RENT.  This song, ""Talk to Me,"" isn't as egregious as ""One Star Glory,"" or whatever the Rent version is, but in both shows, they build up the song through the whole plot, so that whatever follows can't live up to the hype.  But who cares when Scott Coffey is 1) showing off the craziest flat top hairdo of the whole 1980s 2) then switching to a hat and suspenders 3) playing a really tall piano standing up, his little hands making flapping motions on the keyboard as though he were making pancakes or pizza.  His chest, and stomach, are absolutely flat--you could make a level out of him for your I-Phone app.  I fully expected him to run off with Deborah Harry at the end of the movie but, instead, he -- well, you have to see for yourself.  He is marvelous whether essaying Rachmaninoff or Steve Cropper, he's the Coffey Man.",1234656000,,2306,4.4749403341288785

319631,4,6301049292,"Satisfaction's ensemble of characters are always fun to watch again. Justine Bateman with that sexy deep voice, Brita Phillips as the junkie the band members must rescue, Trini Alvarado as the tough car thief Mooch, Julia Roberts as a sweet big sister type with a steady jealous boyfriend, and Liam Neeson as the older alcoholic songwriter in need of a comeback. But no one mentions where the story is set or why Mooch is never punished for stealing the band's van from a gangster. The musical score must be good because it was written by Michel Columber who also wrote Purple Rain for Prince, but enhanced sound on video also seems to be out of sync during a few songs.",1212969600,2,670,4.591666666666667
319632,3,6301049292,"SATISFACTION is not a great movie by any shakes, but taken for what it was meant to be - a slightly naive tale of a girls' band that has a summer of adventure, love and opportunity for the big time nut opts instead to become just a group of life-long friends - it is a well done bit of pastiche.  Thanks to the simple script by Charles Purpura and to the sensitive direction of Joan Freeman the little story works well.

The interesting aspect of the film is the cast. The band consists of leader Justine Bateman with Trini Alvarado, Britta Phillips, Scott Coffey as the token male, Deborah Harry and yes, the movie debut of  Julia Roberts!  Liam Neeson serves as the love interest for Justine Bateman's character and Michael DeLorenzo has a small part, too.  The music is fun and the cast commits to the idea of the film well.  Strange to see a film from 1988 with the established stars disappearing and the 'newcomers' taking flight.  Grady Harp, December 06",1165017600,,960,4.514450867052023
319633,4,6301049292,i am a big fan of the 80's movie even though most are a bit corny.  And the same goes for this one at times but i love it.  You get to see Julia Roberts and a younger Liam Neeson which is great.  Also has a pretty good sound track and Justine Bateman does a good job of lip-syncing.  Save when it looks as if she is gonna eat the mic. Over all is a good movie.  Hope this review helped. Enjoy the movie.,1154217600,4,403,3.75
319634,5,6301049292,"Holy smokes Justine Bateman, Julia Roberts and Liam Neeson all in one moview and not a Partridge to be found anywhere ..... I myself have been a fan of Betman for some time and could never really figure out why we haven't seen much much more of her over the years ... it's has to be that hot hot 'animal' sexuality that probably turns most women off ... HMMMM

Anyway this is a great light hearted movie .. do not expect any writing above grade 5 level .. Julia Roberts plays an oversexed band member and her best scene was the one she spends 24 hours humping in the bands van ... Liam Neeson was great (what else do you expect) as the 'older' man drinking himself into obscurity ... he's supposed to be somewhat dislikable with redeeming values nut because hes such a damned good actor .... he actually bordered on being a very obnoxious dirtbag with no redeeming values...

As for Bateman well what can i say that I haven't said here already .....",1146787200,,949,4.386363636363637
319635,3,6301049292,"I bought this for a friend, as a big surprise for her 26th birthday. This used to be her favourite movie, when she was a young'n.

I'd never seen it before and it's full of unknowns- apart from Julia Roberts in a bit part role and Liam Neason as a moody 'older man' type love interest.

I wasn't particularly looking forward to finding out what all the fun was about- but I gave it a shot.

It's pretty poor. But in a really good way! When you were a youth in the 80s all the chick flick teen drama movies were pretty shabby, but they had such charm... the girls were pretty, the music was catchy and the love stories were completely ridiculous- but that hardly matters when you're 9.

I thoroughly recommend it to anyone that has a vague memory of it- because it'll bring back those 'feelings'! But apart from that.... just watch Dirty Dancing again or something..!?",1137974400,2,867,4.4
319636,5,6301049292,"Satisfaction... is it goofy? Yes. Dated? Definitely 80's. Light/Fluffy? Yes. Bad acting? I bet Julia Roberts would pay to have her scenes erased forever. All of these questions miss the point however!! The appropriate question about this movie should be, ""Is it FUN?"", and the answer is ""Oh yeah!"".

Like day time talk shows, comic books, and that old Poison album hiding in the back of your closet, this movie is a guilty pleasure to be enjoyed, but never admitted to! If you are in, or just really like rock bands, this movie is even better (almost inspirational). It's a fun romp with a young (mosly girl) band who land the ultimate gig at a summer beach resort. Music, mayhem, and rock band movie cliches ensue. The humor is funny.... the ""drama"" is even funnier (the lead guitarist breaks her drug addiction in one day, because the band tells her to!)! Be sure to look for Debbie Harry (Blondie), who turns in the movie's best acting performance in a five minute cameo. The soundtrack is strangely good (retro 80's), and the ""band"" in the movie actually performs on it! See the movie, and you will have no doubt that Justine Bateman sang her own vocals... which may or may not be a good thing!

If you've ever strummed an electric guitar, or just dreamed of rocking out and hitting the road with your friends, you must see this movie!!",1136937600,23,1340,4.602510460251046
319745,1,6301049292,"I recently saw this movie and couldn't believe how bad an actress Julia was.  She was terrible at lip sincing.  I can see why Justine Bateman was the lead character.

Julia just looked like an Amazon with too hair and not enough talent!

The best acting came from Britta Philips who sorry to say doesn't act any more.

319746,4,6301049292,"...one review previously states, that they can't imagine julia roberts ever being a 'second-billed' actress, and that, shortly after this movie, that all changed...how soon we forget, that shortly after the awful 'pretty woman' came out, she was again being 'second-billed' to the likes of dennis quaid and susan sarandon, because her own career was tanked...and it wasn't until ""my best friend's wedding"",(which was originally offered to sandra bullock), that her career picked-up again...but her box-office appeal still does not match her salary, as most of her films consistantly visit that all-too-familiar tank...now, about this movie...it's not the greatest film in the world, not the worst, but it certainly rocks at some points, with justine bateman doing an admirable job at lead vocals, and the choice of music doesn't hurt either, with a soundtrack that i used to play over and over again(""mystery dance"" is still great!)...the acting by everyone, except julia, is also pretty up-to-snuff, considering the dialogue they had to work with...and liam neeson, well, he could read a phone book and make it sound interesting...",1134086400,2,1132,5.365168539325842
319747,5,6301049292,"This is a really underated movie.  I have always listed it among my favorites because it is simply fun and well done.  Great performances by stars Justine Bateman and Liam Niesen not to mention the supporting characters (including Julia Roberts and a cameo by Deborah Harry), but Britta Phillips steals the show as Billy.  This film was the first place I was made aware of her vocal talents, but as it turns out she was also the singing voice of 80's cartoon idol Jem!.  She later went on to play with a number of bands in the UK (Belltower) and NY (Luna).  This film is really worthwile for the music (which is fun and amatuerish, most sung by Justine Bateman), the story (which is dramatic and comedic as necessary) and the cast (who are all give top rank performances).",1130457600,6,772,4.525179856115108
319748,3,6301049292,"Satisfaction is more notable for being Julia Roberts' first credited movie appearance than the actually movie.  Although the DVD cover prominently features Ms. Roberts, she has a small supporting role as Justine Bateman is clearly the star of the film.  Ms. Bateman's character Jennie Lee leads a four girl, one guy rock band who head from the city to a shore town and set up a summer long residency at a club owned by Martin Falcon who is played by a young Liam Neeson.  Jennie and Martin have something of a romance, but it never gets off the ground. Ms. Roberts' character, Daryle, plays bass and wants to rise above her lower class roots and find someone sophisticated.  Britta Phillips plays the band's guitarist, Billie, who is stoned all the time, Trini Alvarado plays the drummer, Mooch, who dresses in black and is a street smart tough girl and Scott Coffey plays the token guy, Nickie, who plays keyboards and has a thing for Mooch.  The plot is paper thin and is big on clich&eacute;s like following your dreams, but the cast is incredibly likeable and it is fun little movie for anyone whose nostalgic for 80's teen flicks.",1130112000,6,1135,4.683417085427136
