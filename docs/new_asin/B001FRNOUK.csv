This performance appears to be identical to one released by TDK.  It received decidedly mixed reviews, and I refer you to that posting at Amazon for other opinions.  The production is from Stuttgart and is part of a Ring cycle conducted by Zagrosek with a different director for each opera.  Let me begin by saying that if you are interested in a well sung Walkure and don't care to watch, then go immediately to an audio recording.  None of the commercial dvd recordings are the vocal equivalent of classic recordings (both live and studio).  So let's begin with the visuals.  In a nutshell Act 1 left me astonished; when it worked, it was great; when it didn't, it was stupid.  Act 2 left me perplexed and bored.  Act 3 left me literally on the floor rolling in laughter.
Act 1:  Siegmund (Gambill) looks like a younger Melchior (barrel chested and chunky); rather than a fake animal skin, he bounces about in shorts and a hoodie for most of the act.  His singing, while not near a Melchior (since I brought up the comparison), is mostly up to the challnge and, despite his girth, he moves about fairly well.  Sieglende (Denoke) is even better as is Hunding. What really works is the chemistry between S & S; they act as if they feel animal passion; no stand and sing for those two  Unfortunately, as is often the case when directors take the Ring out of its mythological time, many details make little sense (e.g., sword pulled out of sheath held by Sieglinde, Hunding plays with a gun),
Act 2:  This act is the weakest and, at times, tedious. It opens with Wotan (Rootering) dressed in a windbreaker as if he were about to go out and buy a quart of milk.  He is surrounded by small figurines resembling Greek/Roman statues.  And poor Brunnhilde appears dressed as a .... hmm...amalgamation of a Goth, biker, and female prison warden.  Unlike some other reviewers, I found Rootering pretty much up to par for the role vocally; visually, however, he is almost as wide as he is tall, making him better suited for Falstaff than the chief god. Brunnhilde, on the other hand, is a bit overparted; she does ok until she has to ride either above the orchestra or above the stave.  What is really puzzling about this act is the concluding confrontation between Siegfried and Hunding.  The singers use megaphones and actions are carried out by huge puppets representing the four parties.  The point of the Act 2 staging entirely escapes me.
Act 3:  This is my favorite act in this production; if only Wagner were alive to see it.  The Valkyries enter with a long feathered wing on each arm, dressed as a cross between hookers and cheerleaders (again with the megaphones).  They are stretched out for much of the scene in a single line like some half-bird, half-vamp, half-""I got into mom's makeup box"" Radio City Rockettes. (I know that 3 halves are more than a whole, but this group is clearly more than the sum of its parts.)  When Wotan enters, he is on a different stage level and never physically interacts with Brunnhilde; he sings to her but observes her on a television monitor.  Finally, Brunnhilde falls asleep (passes out, hides her head in disbelief?) on a small table surrounded by a couple of votive candles while Wotan plays with the remote control for the TV that is displaying the image of Brunnhilde. As Anna Russell used to say in her Ring parody, ""I'm not making this up.""  Great fun; at times I laughed so hard I ached.
Bottom line:  far from rejecting this version, I was entertained (especially in Acts 1 and 3); if there were profound messages in the sets and costumes, I missed them and frankly am not particularly interested in discovering them.  I recommend this production to those familiar with the Ring and who are looking for something different as an addition to the more conventional productions such as Barenboim (first choice despite the overly gloomy lighting and unimaginative costumes), Boulez (second choice due to a weaker cast and conducting), and Levine (third choice because prolonged viewing can induce a coma).",1210377600,6,4157,4.713692946058091
8302493,4,B001FRNOUK,It's time for a Westbroek Ring - at least a full recording like Altmeyer with Dresden Orchestra!,1412294400,,96,4.705882352941177
8302494,5,B001FRNOUK,"First of all,I get angry at the judging of opera singers as if they are simple movie actors and actresses, which depend very much on their looks. But even if some physical and age warts show at all in the videorecording,are nil next to the splendid acting and singing seen and listened. It is a superb collection of actor- and actress-singers that surprised me totally. There is nothing done in a middling way. Even the alteration on two important scenes (that of the sword Nothung,where Sieglinde,not Siegmund, takes the sword out,and that of the dialogue between Brunhilde and Siegmund before of the fight with Hunding,where Sieglinde is awake and not asleep as in Wagner) added  more drama to the scenes,i believe. It is telling that the small parts(in Wagnerian terms) of Hunding,Fricka and the eight other walkyries are at the same level that the principal ones. I am traditionalist regarding opera,but when you have this mix of singing,acting,well done adaptation, a Maestro at the pit(I got in heaven hearing and seeing the beggining of the third act,e.g., the ride of the valkyries) you can do nothing, if not wish that ALL other adaptations were done like this. Wagner,I believe, would be proud of his danish cousins. The Royal Danish Opera House has given to us a Die Walkure for the ages. BRAVO.",1308441600,2,1306,4.882882882882883
8302495,4,B001FRNOUK,"The second installment in the Royal Danish Opera's fascinating take on Wagner's Ring places the struggles of the Gods squarely in a banal world of family drama, like a TV network movie-of-the-week shot on a low budget. It opens with a striking bourgeois image. Hunding's hut is an art deco apartment, with Sieglinde as a cowed, bullied hausfrau desperate to get out. When Siegmund (Stig Anderson) enters, and she immediately seizes upon him as the means of escape. Hunding (Stephen Milling) is a loutish, violent alcoholic. The escape from his apartment is quite literal: Siegmund throws a chair through a plate-glass window and they find the sword stuck in a tree in the front yard.

Mr. Anderson was a late replacement in this cycle, but he gives a committed performance. He sounds comfortable in this low-lying tenor part, and while he reaches for the high notes, the overall effect is pleasing. He is paired with Gitta-Maria Sjberg, an emotional Sieglinde who is more involved in events than this character usually is. She pulls the sword from the tree, and is awake (and horrified) for the Annunciation of Death. Mr. Milling is a memorable, nasty Hunding, whose voice does not match his hulking Ted Cassidy-like physique.

Wotan (James Johnson) starts on the flying ""bridge"" that ended Das Rheingold. He is playing a vast game of Stratego with plaster pieces representing the other characters. When he realizes he must slay his son, he smashes his son's piece at ""Das ende!"", eliminating Siegmund from the game of power. Here, the one-eyed God is also blurred by drink: whiskey swigged from a hip flask. Mr. Johnson remains a better actor than a singer, but he is both convincing and moving in his anguish.

Decked out in black with literal wings on her back, Irne Theorin is a dramatically interesting Brunnhilde. She has a heroic soprano voice that is slightly on the small side. But she endures through this difficult role, and her middleweight voice suits the director's intimate concept. It helps that Michael Schnwalt conducts with a light touch in the pit when it is needed. Her voice hardens under pressure, which makes her big moment with Sieglinde in Act III seem forced.

Kasper Bech Holten's production has its share of innovative ideas. Wotan is completely combat-unready. All he can do is scheme and bully his daughters. He is totally impotent, and doesn't even kill Hunding. The brute laughs, kicks Siegmund's corpse and strolls off the stage. The Valkyrie girls, in blood-stained dresses and black feathery angel wings, loot the mummified bodies of dead soldiers on an urban rooftop with a greenhouse-type structure that doubles as Brunnhilde's Valkyrie rock. At the height of Wotan's Farewell, the god literally rips the wing from his daughter's back before putting Brunnhilde to sleep, a moving moment that echoes the mutilation of Alberich in Das Rheingold.

Mr. Schnwandt falls into the Bhm-Boulez school of Wagner interpreters. His quick tempos and clear delineation of the instrumentation suit this production, with its contemporary sets and movie-of-the-week atmosphere. Part of that feel is due to the stage direction, but the fast-moving cameras and close focus make this feel more like a soap than an opera.",1303689600,,3238,5.056179775280899
8302496,5,B001FRNOUK,"My opera viewing experience has been limited to a live rendering of ""Amal and The Night Visitors"". This is my first viewing of a Wagnerian opera, and of course it was so I could see the Ride of the Valkeries. So this review will make a nice contrast with the other reviewer, who is much more familiar with renditions of this opera. Which means I highly recommend you read both reviews.

I stated this is my first Wagner opera viewing. Will it be my last? If it is (and it could be), this rendition has nothing to do with it. I found parts of it strange and not my cup of tea, but I'd say 95% (at least) has to do with the opera itself, not this particular rendition. And even if it is my last, it is for subjective reasons (such as a story of a woman leaving her husband for her twin brother whom she just met). Objectively this definitely is well done art, both on the part of Wagner's composing and writing the libretto and this rendition. And the objective side enabled me to enjoy the artistry, enough I would consider seeing another opera.

If I do see another Wagner opera, it might be a different rendition of this one, so I can see a more traditional setting. I applaud the creativity of the producer to set the series in the 20th century, but I am neutral on the effectiveness of the innovation. After all, it is a little out of place for people in 1940ish garments to be talking about their spears.

One other note -- I did not like the covers of the series. If I saw that as a movie picture, I would not have much interest in learning more.

Admittedly not being overly familiar with Wagner operas (or other composer operas) like my fellow review who reviewed this product, I still would give my recommendation for this product if you enjoy Wagner operas or want to know what one is like.",1299888000,,1799,4.313609467455621
8302497,5,B001FRNOUK,"I got this shortly after getting the Valencia Gotterdamerung. I enjoyed this much more. I meant just to watch a little bit and need up watching the whole production. The orchestral playing is magnificent and the singing very good. Except for the Ride the balance between orchestra and voice is very good
 the staging is simple. But very effective. As opposed to the Valencia where it is distracting.",1288483200,3,399,4.867647058823529
8302498,2,B001FRNOUK,"if the french could simply refrain from laying their hands on Teutonic arts, they would have made contributions to the civilization,  and everyone would have thanked them...but as in this case, they totally ruined wagner's die walkure by some of the stupidest stage arrangements.  the singing is so so,  but the stage setting is unpleasant visually,not to mention some of the singers sweated like pigs, ehh[...] that's french's sophisticated wagner interpretation... and my $50 down the toilet.",1272931200,8,494,5.3896103896103895
8302499,4,B001FRNOUK,"I recently saw both this Walkure and the new Mehta version.  I sold the Mehta, which has some delightful touches but over-all is not nearly as gripping.
But to focus on this Copenhagen version, starting with the negatives:  The house cast is fine for a live audience, but the close camera work ruthlessly exposes actors who don't ""look"" the part as well as the Barenboim and Boulez Rings.  This Siegmund in particular is short, stocky, pock-marked, and much too old.  That said, he sings well and acts very well.  No complaints about the Hunding, Wotan, or Fricka; they are all you need in their respective roles.  Sieglinde almost as good.

Brunnhilde a bit old and heavy (not as much as Siegmund) but she carries herself well and is a terrific singing actress.  Her face is basically pretty and intelligent (unlike her counterpart in the Mehta production whose round face somehow puffs out the expressiveness needed for drama.  I know that is an unexpectedly vivid description, but you may as well know what you will get).

The 20th century staging seems gimmicky, but one adjusts to it and there are many felicitous touches along the way that make it acceptable.  Sound and picture are very good.  Orchestra plays without great distinction or character, but they are certainly good enough.

Like with the newer Mehta production, the camera editor is on steroids, stimulants, or some such.  Musical and dramatic enjoyment is compromised by camera angles changing every few seconds.  These editors evidently do not like opera, and treat it like an 007 action film. (The Mehta is worse in this respect.)

Lastly, I have seen almost every Walkure DVD available.  The staging and acting of the closing scene on this version is by far the most moving of all.  Wotan and Brunnhilde, their fears hopes and determination come alive as never before.  This production in general is worth your time, but the final scene will (pardon the cliche) take your breath away.  It is exhausting in the best sense.  There is one sudden, unexpected gesture in Wotan's farewell that just makes you sit up in your chair.  I've seen it several times and it's a stab in the heart every time.

I enjoyed this Ring cycle, except for Das Rheingold which is too lurid for my tastes. This Walkure and the final scene of Gotterdammerung were my favorite parts of it.",1270339200,5,2336,4.799498746867168
8302500,4,B001FRNOUK,"I am no professional musician or critic, but I have hearing different versions of Die Walkre for at least 40 years, including Karajan's, Solti's, Furtwangler's, Levine's, Boulez's, and others. So my first comment is that I enjoyed this version very much and was emotionally moved by it, which in the end is most important.

I specially like Rattle's direction and the great performance of the Berlin Philharmonic, which seems at times to sound like a chamber orchestra.

The setting is a moder one, rather minimalistic, but for once I found it acceptable. Still, I found Wotan going under the table when Brnnhilde tells him Fricka is coming absurd and out of character.

As to the singers, I liked Eva-Maria Westbroek as Sieglinde, she manages to sing and act convincingly. Robert Gambill sings with no fault that I can discern, but acts more like he was drunk than tired. Sir Willard White as Wotan is a bit more solemn than tormented, and Eva Johansson as Brnnhilde is excellent, but a bit too defiant in the final scenes. I loved Mikhail Petrenko as Hunding, he managed to scare me off, so I can imagine his tyranny over Sieglinde. Good Fricka by Lilli Paasiviki.

I highly recommend this recording.",1250208000,7,1202,4.820388349514563
8302501,3,B001FRNOUK,"Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra steal the show. The playing of the Berlin Orchestra under Simon Rattle is sumptuous. It is enormously helped by the high definition sound recording in DTS-HD 5.1. In orchestral performance, this may not be the best version of this opera, but it will certainly find a place among the best.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the singers. Only Eva-Marie Westbroek, as Sieglinde, is thoroughly convincing vocally. The other three main singers (Siegmund, Wotan and Brunnhilde) are completely unsatisfactory. Robert Gambill, as Siegmund has serious problems with the most dramatic moments, though he can sing delicately in some moments such as in the Wintersturme; Sir Willard White is more impressive physically than vocally. But the most serious problem in the cast is the Brunnhilde of Eva Johansson. To much strain in her voice, far from being a good Brunnhilde. How come that another better singer was not available? Her perforfance as actress is not entirely convincing, since she tries to compensate for her weak vocal performance by exaggerating facial expressions. Mikhail Petrenko is impressive as Hunding, but only physically. His voice, however, is too light to convey menace. It is difficult to forget Matti Salminen in this role. Lilli Paasikivi is OK as Fricka.
Part of the difficulty faced by the singers is due to their own limitations but part is due to the balance between orchestra and voice. In Bayreuth the orchestra is hidden, so that its sound does not cover the voices even in the most powerful tutti. But here, in Aix-en-Provence, the orchestra is completely exposed; therefore, its sound is much stronger, forcing the singers to their limits. In the Ride of the Valkyries, there is a moment when it is not possible to hear the voices of the 8 Valkyries singing together, so powerful is the orchestral playing.
I confess I do not like these modern stagings of Wagner's opera. This one is not one of the worst I have seen, but minimalist stagings of Wagner's opera are beginning to become repetitive.
Sound recording is wonderful in DTS-HD. I have not listened to the  opera in LPCM Stereo, but I do not think it will be necessary. Image quality is also very good. This is one of the few classical music recordings in 1080p. Even in blu-ray, there has been a tendency for 1080i resolution in most classical music blu-rays. So we have to congratulate Bel-Air for their decision to release the opera with the best possible resolution. Another point in favor of this recording lies in the fact that it is in one blu-ray only, instead of the expected 2, and considering it is a 4 hour opera, we would expect to have 2 discs. Of course, there is the disadvantage of the inexistence of extras, such as interviews, making of, etc. But the main attraction - the opera itself - is there in one disc.",1231977600,20,2871,4.871165644171779
8302502,4,B001FRNOUK,"It's curious, although perhaps fitting that Die Walkre would emerge as Wagner's first work to be released on Blu-ray. After all, this opera is about transitions. Rather than advancing the Ring narrative linearly, Die Walkre tells its own story and still stands as the turning point in the Ring cycle. It sets into motion a sequence of events whose effects become known by the later consequences revealed in Siegfried and Gtterdmmerung. Consequently, Die Walkre can stand on its own requiring nothing logically prior to it. But enough of that. Let's get to the Blu-ray.

Wagner in high definition. Let me just say that this is a home video medium that can finally begin to do justice to his work. The video on this disc, filled with numerous close-ups that draw the viewer in, is superb even while falling short of reference quality for the Blu-ray format. The audio, presented here in DTS HD 5.1 is crystal clear and fully dynamic in its range. Experiencing the 1080p image on a 100"" home theater screen with high-end audio is like being in the opera house, but at the same time more intimate - sort of like being on stage with the performers and feeling their parts as they do. It is a very personal and profound experience. This is the way opera, and Wagner in particular, is meant to be experienced.

The performance is from the Aix-en-Provence Festival in 2007 and is part of a Ring cycle that will conclude in 2009. Reviews have been generally positive and there is optimism for continued success in the remaining operas. There has also been controversy, mostly over the production. So what else is new?

The minimalist staging of Stphane Braunschweig will not appeal to everyone. In fact it may appeal to very few. The stark well-lit sets offer a confusing mixture of style that is imaginative, but dull and occasionally absurd (Wotan actually puts his daughter to sleep across three red French Louis XV parlor chairs). At the curtain call the audience was generous to Braunschweig with polite applause. He was lucky.

The costumes designed by Thibault Vancraenenbroeck are equally bizarre. Siegmund and Sieglinde don matching floor length white Victorian capelets as they run off together into the night. With his battered army fatigues underneath, Siegmund looks downright clownish in the attire. Wotan wears the same coat in black. Hunding looks like James Bond. Only Brnnhilde with traditional helmet and shield looks appropriate for her part.

Fortunately, the singing fares much better. The highlight of the performance is Eva-Marie Westbroek as Sieglinde. From unhappy housewife, to excited lover reunited with her brother, to horrified witness of a brutal killing to exalted mother-to-be, Westbroek covers the full range and captures every nuance both vocally and dramatically with great aplomb. When she sings O hehrstes Wunder, one expects all the angels in heaven to rally to her cause.

The oft-maligned Robert Gambill plays a weary, battle-scared Siegmund. It seems operagoers either love this guy or, well, they don't. In any case he usually delivers what one expects so generally he neither surprises nor disappoints. Depending on your view, Gambill is either fortunate or unfortunate (by means of comparison) to be paired with Westbroek. Physically they are a believable couple with considerable onscreen chemistry. Vocally, however, Gambill is no match for Westbroek. Nonetheless, any fair and balanced criticism of his performance should not be overly harsh. He is able to sing with great tenderness in Winterstme wichen dem Wonnemond.

Mikhail Petrenko plays Hunding not as a burley woodsman, but as a coldhearted KGB assassin. Right from his opening line to Sieglinde, Du labtest ihn? (Did you help him?), we know he is lethal. When he took a brief bow with the others at the close of act one, he remained in character and gave the audience the same icy stare that made Sieglinde tremble at the very sight of him. His singing was adequate, perhaps even more than that, but all I remember about him was the menacing look of a born killer.

We first see Wotan as the silent observer of Siegmund and Sieglinde in Act 1. Dressed in a gray suit, he stands and sometimes sits off to the side in one of the aforementioned red chairs where he looks the part of a business manager watching rehearsal. When he appears at the beginning of Act 2, Wotan is seated at a table playing war games with toy figures. Really. Fortunately Sir Willard White - made all the more fearful and imposing by wearing a glass eye - has the stage presence to quickly overcome this childish and misguided start. He delivers a powerful portrayal of Wotan although his stage presence is at times more impressive than his singing.

Brnnhilde is played with a slight wobble by Eva Johansson. Still, she demonstrates fine vocal range. She was forceful without too much strain when required and still capable of poignancy and subtlety in her third act duet with Wotan. Dramatically, Johansson can be prone to some exaggerated movements and facial expressions that are not flattering in a Blu-ray close-up; this is a shame because she is otherwise attractive and a welcome addition to the Wagnerian sopranos corps.

The mountaintop gathering of the Valkyries is staged on a platform of steep steps where the girls are carrying fallen heroes (dummies dressed in battle gear) up to Valhalla. It's not as bad as it the image may convey and some clever lighting effects that create snow peaked mountains at least make the scene appear outdoors. Hojotoho is meaningfully delivered and Rattle has the Berlin Philharmonic in full splendor for this big orchestral moment.

It would be hard to imagine the BPO giving a more inspired performance under the baton of another conductor. I would not have thought that beforehand. Rattle is in full command and intuitively seems to know just where to add the right dramatic musical punch to bolster the narrative. The BPO really delivers the goods here. This is playing of a very high caliber that is ideally suited to the advanced audio capabilities of Blu-ray. It makes one even more eager to hear the next installment.

No one will declare this a definitive Walkre even for home video. The production value is far too weak and some of the vocal performances are uneven. On the other hand, Westbroek is magnificent and probably unequaled on any home video format. Rattle and the BPO are similarly hard to beat. Those two things alone would make this performance worth viewing. When you throw in the real star, Blu-ray, it becomes essential viewing. This presentation is far and away the best that a Wagner opera has ever looked and sounded outside of the opera hall itself.",1231372800,27,6697,4.932564330079858
