[...]

I enjoyed the show very much but it has greater meaning to me since a good friend of mine supplied the props and costumes for the hero himself!
Many people have asked me why I would like a show that did not do well in the ratings, has sublevel writing, and only lasted one season?  My answer is simple....he looks so damn cool!  That combined with the fact that the Mantis props were all aquired from a very good friend of mine makes them very special to me.
The MANTIS head gear on the site was the one used throughout the series.  The one on the that looks different is from the pilot.  It has special effects lights around the eyes and smaller colorful lights for use when the MANTIS was injured.  So why the different versions?  Part of the agreement to pick up the series was to change the look of the Mantis.  Make his headgear more streamlined.  And so they did.  Certainly, the one from the pilot is the rarer of the two.  The small car in the middle is a fan produced model of the Mantis's vehicle that flies in the show.  The framed drawing is an original drawing of the pilot costume.",1230940800,,1206,4.283185840707965
3627669,4,B001HB1K3C,"I distinctly remember taping the pilot for M.A.N.T.I.S. and watching
it over and over.  Unfortunately, the series was nowhere near as good.

Why?  The pilot was extremely topical.  Our hero was crippled by an rogue
police sniper using illegal ammunition during the post-Rodney King verdict L.A. riots.  He was shot by a racist white cop simply because he was a black man in the ""wrong"" part of town.  This was typical of the pilot, which never held back from confronting racism.

Also, our hero was much more limited in his abilities during the pilot,
but his origin and powers were retconned for the series.  Not cool!

I would purchase the pilot in a heartbeat and show it to my children,
but I can't recommend watching a single episode of the series.",1224028800,4,753,4.687022900763359
3627670,5,B001HB1K3C,"M.A.N.T.I.S. was a Classic TV Sc-Fi series on Fox from 1994 that featured a truly unique and unexpected super hero. I loved the show, but have a hard time arguing with folks who complain it was really cheesy. In my defense, it was huge FUN and that allowed me to ignore its obvious flaws and thoroughly enjoy the series.

Originally airing on Fox, it premiered on Aug. 26, 1994. It was cancelled the following year, but its final unaired episodes were shown for the first time in 1997 on the Sc-Fi Network, which was airing repeats of the entire series.

Quiet, brilliant Dr. Miles Hawkins, portrayed by Carl Lumbly (best known from roles in Alias and Cagney & Lacey), became an unexpected crime fighter. Hawkins was a scientist/inventor with a thirst for justice who could not walk after a robber's bullet left him paralyzed and also cost him his family.

Hawkins invented a shell in which he could overcome his disability and free him from his wheelchair. In effect, the suit, a metal exoskeleton, provides superhuman abilities that ultimate serves to bring out Hawkins' alter ego.

What Hawkins' invented was a ""harness"" from cutting-edge technology equipped with headgear allowing transmitters in his brain to bypass his damaged spine. Translation: he can walk again and more - he unexpectedly finds that in the suit he has increased strength, speed and agility.

With help from his invention, the Mechanically Augmented Neuro Transmitter System (M.A.N.T.I.S.) and a few supportive colleagues, he decides to fight the criminals that the police could not find. At first a reluctant hero, Hawkins is drawn into the world of fighting crime because the violence that turned his life upside-down is doing the same to the world around him. While in the harness and headset, he assumes the identity of the Mantis believing it is the only way that he is able to fight back.

""This is the scientific journal of Dr. Miles Hawkins, to be published in the event of my death. I know when the truth is known, people will wonder why I felt it necessary to create the `M.A.N.T.I.S.' The reality - I never did. The M.A.N.T.I.S. asked his own creation and I could not refuse him.""

Like any vigilante, the police want him brought to justice because he's taking the law into his own hands and making them look bad; the news media wants to expose his true identity; and criminals want him eliminated because he's bad for business. The series takes place in a huge, dark and brooding megalopolis on the West Coast in the present. Its locational ambiguity is meant to suggest that this unusual hero could be in YOUR neighborhood tonight.

M.A.N.T.I.S. was produced by the creators of The Evil Dead and Army of Darkness. Also starring Bobby Hosea (Independence Day) and Gina Torres (Angel, Firefly, Serenity), this action-packed series broke new ground with TV's first African-American superhero. The show became an instant cult favorite, and DVD boxed from Image Entertainment is the first release of this show in any format. It's impending DVD release has been more than eagerly anticipated by its legion of fans.

The boxed set includes the feature-length pilot telefilm from January 1994 and then the 20 aired episodes, and the two unaired episodes which finally made their broadcast debut in 1997 in reruns on the Sci Fi Channel.

Sam Raimi exec produced this show almost a decade before helming the first movie in the Spider-Man film trilogy. Among the guest stars here - both single-appearance and recurring - were Don S. Davis, David Kaye, Jerry Wasserman, Gary Graham, Teryl Rothery, Lorena Gale, John D'Aquino, and Vincent Schiavelli.

Additional cast members includes: Roger Rees, as Hawkins' friend and colleague John Stonebrake who knows his secret and assists the M.A.N.T.I.S.; Galyn Gorg, as Lt. Leora Maxwell; Christopher Gartin, as Taylor Savage; and Andrew Robinson (best known for his recurring role in Star Trek: Deep Space 9), as Solomon Box.

The following is the list of all episodes along with when they first aired, since the shows sometimes did not air regularly: Pilot (Part 1), 01/24/1994, Pilot (Part 2), 01/24/1994; First Steps, 08/26/1994; Tango Blue, 09/2/1994; Days of Rage, 09/9/1994; Cease Fire, 09/16/1994; Soldier of Misfortune, 09/23/1994; Gloves Off 09/30/1994; The Black Dragon 10/7/1994; To Prey in Darkness 10/14/1994; Fire in the Heart, 10/21/1994; Thou Shalt Not Kill (1), 11/4/1994; Revelation (2), 11/11/1994; Through the Dark Circle, 11/18/1994; The Eyes Beyond, 12/9/1994; Faces in the Mask, 12/16/1994; The Sea Wasp, 1/6/1995; Progenitor, 1/20/1995; Switches, 1/27/1995; The Delusionist, 2/10/1995; and Fast Forward, 2/17/1995, and Spider in the Tower, 3/3/1995. The last two episodes of the series, which never aired during the show's run, aired instead for the first time in 1997 on the SciFi Network: Ancestral Evil; and Ghost of the Ice.",1223164800,57,4871,5.067415730337078
3627696,4,B001HB1K3C,"Back in the 90s, whenever Fox premiered a show on Friday nights, it was destined for doom. Shows like John Doe, The Adventures of Brisco County Jr., VR-5, to name a few. M.A.N.T.I.S was one of the shows. It stars Carl Lumby as Dr. Miles Hawkins aka M.A.N.T.I.S.. I was pleased to find the first and only season on dvd; loyalists might know all the episodes in and out to see if there are any edits, but I am not aware of any. I am glad I added this brilliant show to my collection.",1369785600,,481,4.127659574468085
3627697,5,B001HB1K3C,"I remember the pilot, and felt the show had potential. There are so few black superheroes who have live action, well any kind of adaptation outside of comics. There was a move from Port City the Port Columbia. I had hoped they might cast a few more ethnic characters. There seemed a bit of a struggle balancing humor, plot, and super scientific jargon that might go over most peoples heads. Overall, I really enjoyed the series and wish it could of lasted long enough to iron out its glitches and evolve. Sadly TV is like music these days. The powers that be are way too quick to dismiss as the next one hit wonder.",1364342400,3,615,4.4035087719298245
3627698,5,B001HB1K3C,"Sam Raimi created a wonderful African-American superhero without the stereotypes!  Carl Lumbly was the perfect choice to play him. Fox network dealt this show an injustice when they canceled it. Well, on DVD, long live the M.A.N.T.I.S.!!!!!",1362873600,,240,5.486486486486487
3627699,5,B001HB1K3C,"This series lasted only one season, but what a season!  Carl Lumbly later got a lot more attention for his role on Cagney and Lacey, but this is the role I remember him for whenever I read his name.  Miles Hawkins/MANTIS was the smartest guy in the room and had no trouble letting you know it.  Carl Lumbly made every scene his in or out of the wheelchair Miles had to endure and it actually helped to make the MANTIS more imposing when he did put on the costume.

The technobabble rarely got out of hand and unlike most TV shows, the local cops were not all idiots.  The only thing I really had difficulty with was the cast change from the pilot to the series; gone were his able assistants and contemporaries to be replaced by a nerdy scientist and a street smart bike messenger who should have been hit by a cab in the first 10 minutes.  Fortunately, they never got too much screen time.  Besides Lumbly's great performance, I have another reason to remember this show fondly; it introduced me to the music of Thelonious Monk.",1360281600,,1029,4.412698412698413

3627702,4,B001HB1K3C,"I have to admitt.. I really liked this series back in the day and thought it would be cool to see it again.

It is amazing how things can seem to change so much after 20yrs.. LOL  Either it is not like it use to be or is it the fact that I pick up on so much more now.  I notice that it has a lot of great 80's special effects in it.. ha ha haa

Good series.. but not as good as Acting or story line as they have now.",1325030400,,417,3.5
3627703,5,B001HB1K3C,"I used to watch M.A.N.T.I.S. as a kid and had been looking for it on DVD for a while. I am glad Amazon is selling it.
The DVDs were sent quickly and in perfect condition. All episodes are included including the original pilot and the unaired episodes, but there are no bonus features. Overall it is a wonderful product.",1275523200,2,319,4.423728813559322
3627704,5,B001HB1K3C,"The first time I saw this series, I was 13 years old. Happened to come across it on the TV. I watched every episode I could and thought it was brilliant! After the last episode, the series was cancelled and I started to look around for tapes and later DVD's but could never find it. Much to my joy, I found out through IMDB that some project started a print of this series on DVD.

After 14 years, the series is just as I remembered.. A classical storyline: A science experiment gives a disabled man not only the power to walk again, but also experimental superpowers. He built an exoskeleton that allows him to walk again, despite his spinal cord damage but he comes to realise that the suit is much more powerfull than that. In the end of the first episode he decides to help the city he lives in that is ruled by crime. The fact he runs a research laboratory helps him to innovate on tools, gadgets and weaponry suitable for the task.

Throughout the series, not only the fights with crime, but also the ethics of what he's doing come to the foreground. ""Why should he be the one to fight crime?"", ""What makes me any better than the people terrorizing the city?"".
One particularly interesting moment in that regard is, that his impromptu 'team', decides that the suit needs 'weapons'. With which he responds to: ""NO! No guns! Those are what put me in this wheelchair in the first place!""

For its time, the series was very much ahead of its time I think. The technology used in the story line, both by The Mantis and the 'bad guys' is something you might expect somewhere in the future, even now.

The series and the concept even got me as far as thinking about exoskeletons myself. (Hey, I was 13 at the time..)

Bottom line: I'm Glad that they put this on DVD. The series may have been cancelled on the television, but I think it's one of the best SF series around. 5 stars, hands down!",1273708800,7,1891,4.3760683760683765
3627705,5,B001HB1K3C,Loved this show when it was on and love it now. It's always amazing to see how science catches up with TV after a few years! Man's mind is truly fantastic.,1264204800,,155,4.032258064516129
3627716,5,B001HB1K3C,"M.A.N.T.I.S was a show that appeared and disappeared on FOX in the Friday death slot in the early 90s.  This complete series collection is a welcomed addition to my DVD collection. The fact that the show was able to last a season is a testament to creative energy behind the scenes and the actors' commitment on the screen.  Of special note, the pilot episode is so different in tone and substance from the actually series, that you can see how much the prospect of a black superhero was problem for FOX TV executive.  The pilot feature numerous African-American and African characters is support of Carl Lumby's Miles Hawkins (including a younger Marcia Cross of Desperate Housewives fame).  The pilot infused elements of African language and culture into the characterization, but also introduced Hawkins as a black conservative.  Virtually the only character to survive the revamp for the regular series is Hawkins, who is joined by a white pseudo-collaborator and white ""street"" sidekick.  Although Hawkins was seen as self-made and independent inventor in the pilot, the regular series give his white friend John Stonebreak, a crucial role as technical maven and moral compass. Hawkin's conservativism remains a factor, but all element of African language and culture so visible in the pilot survive the regular series revamp.  Merging action television tropes with comics themes and characters including alternative dimension invasion, cyborgs, time travel, and mind control, the show was entertaining.  On air before the comic book explosion that brought us Blade, and the X-Men, this show highlight the difficulties of African-American as action heroes as much as the evolution of comic ethos in modern entertainment.  This collection is a disappointment for it lack of commentary tracks or documentaries about the series.  Carl Lumby has gone on to great things (voice work in Justice League cartoons and lead character in ALIAS) and a number of the producers and writers have done other great things.  Getting the producers and actors to talk about the show and its life would been great. Regardless, this is a DVD worth the time if you like comics and adventure television.",1252713600,4,2184,5.176136363636363

Good character choices and added more scifi to the show. That's what made me a Mantis fan. I'd never seen the final episode before now. Although the plot was lame(my opinion), it was great to see it all tied up and come to an end. So many shows just leave you hanging, unfinished. It was like Star Trek adventures on earth, especially the time warp episode. Enjoy!",1236902400,2,510,4.615384615384615

I enjoyed it because to me his powers is something original which I can related to. To me his character, Miles Hawkins is more believable based on his knowledge and skills. Although it was short lived, I wish one of the networks would pick it up. To me we need more realistic stuff that would seem more beliveable. Like the show called McGiver
were all his gidgets that he used to get himself out of a situation was beliveable. I am not much of a reviewer, other than I love the MANTIS and Carl Lumbly. I wish I could meet him in person.",1236384000,2,610,4.049586776859504

Someone believed that it would be feasible not to have any extras !!! For shame!!!

I'm going to wait until a few people purchase it, read their reviews and then maybe...

8308343,4,B001HB1K3C,"I loved this show because it was the first show to have an African American superhero. The show came out in 1994. This was years before Blade the series came out in 2006 and Luke Cage in 2016. MANTIS was not based on a comic book. I didn't like how they changed the story a little after the pilot. Dr. Hawkins two Black assistants were replaced with two white assistants. They seemed as though they were trying to make the show a little like Batman giving the MANTIS an older scientist friend and a younger quirky sidekick. The series suffers from boring villian's and a lack of fire between Hawkins and his love interest. Their relationship never seemed to get into gear. Several of the villains were interesting while others were bland. Nevertheless, Carl Lumbly played his role as the MANTIS very well. He portrayed a highly intelligent man who fought crime in his spare time. MANTIS had a fancy suit, a cool lab and a hovercraft. MANTIS differs from Blade and Luke Cage in that he was a very smart scientist/doctor. Blade was more violent and Cage was more romantically involved with his women. Of the three shows Blade was the most violent. Cage makes a strong effort to connect with it's audience with a cool soundtrack and social themes. MANTIS was the very first Black superhero with his own series. I highly recommend the show. It's a family show. It's not as violent as Blade or as mature as Cage with it's romance and violence. MANITS is a great show for children who want to see Black heroes who get the bad guy. Unfortunately this show has the very worst season finale that I have ever seen in my life and I am shocked and appalled. You have to see it for yourself. Perhaps the producers were angry for being cancelled when they wrote the episode. Nevertheless, watch this show if you'd like to see a great, hero who actually has morals.",1475971200,,1850,4.541916167664671
