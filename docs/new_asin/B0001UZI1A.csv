8016332,1,B0001UZI1A,"I was never a huge fan of Marvel's ""Ultimate"" imprint & it's not because they've re-imagined the characters to make them more appealing to a wider & generally younger audience, it's just that the material isn't very good or original. Ultimate Daredevil & Elektra is like something out of the WB with it's teen angst & whiny melodrama. The art might be somewhat pretty but the story just lacks any real depth. Save your cash & don't bother with this.",1336694400,2,449,4.625
8016333,5,B0001UZI1A,If you like comics and dramatic actors reading the scripts then this idea is for you.  Remember the book and records when you were a kid? Well with DVD it takes it a step further with these new editions of the graphic novels...with actors reading the parts.  Apperently it didn't do too well. I've seen these discs in the budget section in many video game stores of late.  Too bad because for comic fans this is an idea that should have had a second chance!,1101772800,4,457,4.352941176470588
8016334,5,B0001UZI1A,A great DVD. This begins the Elektra story and how she first crossed paths with Daredevil. Would recommend this product for any comic book fan. The quality of the product far surpasses the Saturday morning superhero cartoons. And the images and dialog are taken directly from the graphic novel so this is as true to the comic as you can get. Great voice-over and animation work.,1085529600,8,378,4.742424242424242
