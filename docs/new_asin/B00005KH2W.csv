7943154,5,B00005KH2W,"I don't know how this film has escaped an audience. This film tells the truly remarkable story of an Irish Traveller - a gypsy (think of a nonfiction version of the fellow Brad Pitt played in ""Snatch"") - and his trainer, the unforgettable Chick. If you follow amateur boxing at all, you will realize how truly remarkable this story is. I think the boxer's name was Francis. Francis, training on home made equipment, with only this extremely old and sweet man as his trainer, out in the middle of nowhere, makes it to the elite echelons of the amateur game, including an Olympic bid, with the entire town rallying behind him even though many were once prejudice against him because he is a Traveller. A truly excellent documentary.",998006400,12,730,4.7109375
