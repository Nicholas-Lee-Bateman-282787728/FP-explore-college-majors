Brian Dennehy is his usual self--assertive, persistant & when he's right he keeps on going no matter who tries to pull him off the case.  Treat Williams just can't get away with what he's done & turns into a weasel when the truth is coming out.  Great Great movie.  If you haven't seen it you need to.  You'll be surprised who turns on who in it.",1302480000,,403,4.181818181818182
7868495,1,6304360827,"I  caught  this  movie  DEADLY  MATRIMONY  on  the  worst  channel  on  cable  television,  you  guessed  it,  the  Lifetime  channel!  To  be  brief,  it  is  overly  melodramatic,  poorly  acted,  and  a  pain  in  the  gulliver  to  watch.(  A  CLOCKWORK  ORANGE  referance  )
  The  only  good  part  about  it(  spoilers,  wait,  it  can't  be  a  spoiler  anyway  because  no  one  in  the  future  will  ever  see  this  weak,  pathetic  excuse  for  a  movie,  and  if  they  do  I  pity  them  )was  the  part  where  Treat  Williams  kills  his  wife  with  a  poker.  Wait,  before  you  think,  ""what  a  sick  and  twisted  misfit  excuse  for  a  human  being"",  I  think  that  is  the  only  good  scene  not  for  its  violence,  but  because  it  suprised  me.  I  had  no  idea  she  would  die  right  then,  I  thought  she  would  learn  how  to  fight  and  then  kill  him  like  so  many  other  bad  drama  films  like  the  highly  atrocious,  ENOUGH  with  Jennifer  Lopez(  ouch!  ).  And  this  is  one  of  the  only  movies  I  saw  that  the  geek  gets  the  girl.
  Oh,  and  did  I  mention  that  Treat  Williams  ...  in  this  movie.",1041206400,,1172,4.23404255319149
