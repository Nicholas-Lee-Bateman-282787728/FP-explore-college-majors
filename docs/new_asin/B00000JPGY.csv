1236317,4,B00000JPGY,"What is interesting about ""Stalingrad: Dogs, do you want to live forever?"" (1958) is how much better it is than the color remake ""Stalingrad"" (1993) made by the producers of ""Das Boot.""

I saw the latter film first and was deeply disappointed by it. It is an excruciatingly long and depressing antiwar screed choked with post-war self hatred and guilt, and the last hour is almost unwatchable. The producers obviously had a political agenda and carried it out at the expense of such minor things as the historical truth or watchability. I'd rather watch ""Born on the Fourth of July"" a half-dozen times than sit through ""Stalingrad"" again.

""Dogs"" is a superior film in almost every way, and I would recommend it over the remake despite the outrageous price of $45 bucks (maybe you can get it used). It tells the story of an officer named Wisse who has just recovered from a slight wound and has been assigned as the liason to a Rumanian division north of Stalingrad. Wisse is tough, able, honest, humane and cool-headed under fire, and quickly earns the respect of both his Rumanian allies and his German subordinates. Unfortunately, his timing is bad: it's November, the the Red Army has just launched the offensive which will trap the German Sixth Army inside Stalingrad.

""Dogs"" alternates the story of Wisse's struggles with his men's morale, the Russian winter, the Red Army, and his cowardly and devious superior, Col. Linkmann, with scenes from Hitler's headquarters explaining the Fuhrer's ""rationale"" (if you can call a completely irrational decision by that name) for refusing permission for the Sixth Army to break out. It also details the attempt by von Manstein to relieve the city. The film relies a bit too much on newsreel footage to pad out its limited budget, and there is a rather obvious sub-plot involving a cute Russian female, but the battle scenes are very well executed and the acting is better (in my opinion) than some of the other reviewers here indicate.

Unlike the ""antiofficer"" films and books which became so popular after the war, ""Dogs"" puts Wisse in a heroic light as a man who leads by example and cannot be turned away from what he percieves as his duty, even when common sense tells him all is lost. It is this attitude that separates ""Dogs"" from ""Stalingrad,"" where the moral and ethical collapse of the soldiers is complete (for a firsthand account that vindicates ""Dogs'"" version of events, read the unpublished memiors of Col. Dingler as reproduced in F.W. von Mellenthin's seminal ""Panzer Battles"" available on this site, q.v. my review of that book if you care!). Interestingly, the film seems to take a certain amount of pride (in a subtle way) with German military accomplishments and dciscipline without endorsing the war or Nazi ideology: the basic message is that these men were just doing their jobs as they saw them, and Hitler committed the ultimate betrayal by exploiting their sense of duty and squandering their lives. One could argue that it glosses over the atrocious German treatment of Russian civilains, but ""Dogs"" is meant to be a war story and not a cinematic expiation of national guilt. On that level it succeeds. If you saw ""Stalingrad"" you should defintely give ""Dogs"" a try; if you didn't, you might want to watch this version first.",1114646400,94,3301,4.868327402135232
1236318,2,B00000JPGY,"A lot is happening in this film. Unfortunatelly, it is a bad thing. We see a glimpse at the life in the occupied Russian city and then events in and around Stalingrad. Many characters are introduced but many of them  disappear or get killed before we get to know them better. Some interesting  facts are presented about the events that happened during the Stalingrad  battle. However, they are again presented very clumsily, making the film  seem disjointed. The style of this presentation is: ""This is what  happened, now get out"", leaving no time for emotional reactions from  the participants in the event. Our hero, who's story is mostly followed  throughout the film, goes through phenomenal character changes despite  years of Nazi upbringing. If someone takes this as a half-documentary, it's  a pretty good one, as a film, it falls apart.",953769600,2,846,4.985714285714286
1236319,4,B00000JPGY,"Anyone with a serious interest in military history will enjoy this 1958 film. Though a low budget production compared to the more recent film version of the battle, actual war footage is used seemlessly throughout. In  fact, it is probably the best use of stock footage I have ever seen in a  fictionalized narrative historical film. The story follows a young veteran  artillery officer as he enters the front at Stalingrad. He is refered to as  a lieutenant colonel due to a translation error in the sub-titles for the  first half of the film, but he is in fact a lieutenant. He is initially  assigned as a liasion to a Rumanian infantry division which is savaged by a  massive attack by Soviet tanks and infantry. As the 6th Army is encircled  and the severe Russian winter sets in, the protagonist becomes trapped in  the savage house to house fighting in Stalingrad itself. Unlike the 1993  version, historical figures, including Von Paulus and Hitler, make  appearances. There is a bit of very unlikely business involving a German  speaking Russian woman, an anti-war German Chaplain, and a vindictive and  cowardly superior officer, but over all, I found the film convincing and  compelling. The street battle scenes are particularly realistic. The print  that is being sold is excellent, unlike many ""Belle and Blade""  offerings.",942710400,24,1336,4.97737556561086
7913090,5,B00000JPGY,"Excellent film.  Surprisingly fair in its treatment of the subject, especially the Rumanians.  Watching the film, you can see its influence on other, later movies.

My one quibble lies in the subtitles.  I was wondering why a ""lieutenant-colonel"" would be subordinated to a major...whomever was doing the subtitles mistook ""ober-leutnant"" for ""oberst-leutnant,"" elevating the main character from a lieutenant to a lieutenant-colonel.",1437523200,3,433,5.935483870967742
7913091,5,B00000JPGY,"As a military historian and U.S. Army veteran...former gunner on an M1A1 battle tank, I can be very critical when it comes to factual military movies. I have over 400 dvd's in my library and I am pleased to say that this movie is one of my favorite. I am usually not keen on using actual combat footage in a movie, but they truly got it right when it came to this movie. The acting, uniforms, and most of the equipment was top notch. It is also fascinating because this was 1958 and the war was still fresh in the minds of many. Many of the actors has the memory of Germany's defeat fresh in their minds. The most memorable scene was when they had a 30 minute truce to collect the dead and wounded and the German soldier began to play a piano that was in the street and both German and Russian soldiers alike was enjoying the sounds. The truce abruptly ends and soldiers from both side are seen running back to their positions before the carnage once again starts. When I was stationed in Germany back in the early 90's, I had the chance to speak with some soldiers who were at Stalingrad. Most of the men I spoke to were not part of the many who were captured but were evacuated before everything fell apart, but this movie reminded me of the stories they told me about the initial feeling of almost invincibility by being a part of the 6th Army and then the slow feeling of impending doom once winter began. If you are a serious military collector, this movie is a definite must have for your collection.",1416268800,,1506,4.3250883392226145
7913092,5,B00000JPGY,"Very interesting movie. I found it intertaining and in some parts quite good. If you are into WWII this would be one you might consider adding to your collection. Whether you like it, is up to you.",1363996800,,197,4.351351351351352
7913093,5,B00000JPGY,"Excellent film albeit that it is in black and white only. It rounds out, and complements the other Stalingrad war movie which is better known. Its really quite amazing the hardships that the basic grunts had to put up with on both sides of the conflict. To round out the Stalingrad perspective one should also purchase Attack and Retreat depicting the fascist Italian Army experience on the Eastern front. The other name for the Attack and Retreat dvd is Italiano Brava Gente (1965)- it starred the late Peter Falk.",1353715200,2,515,4.797752808988764
7913094,5,B00000JPGY,"I managed to watch this film only recently, as it is very hard to find, at least at an accessible price - and I was very impressed! Made in 1959 it is still in black and white. At 97 minutes it is not very long and it is also clearly made on a relatively modest budget. It is however much better than the boring, bleak, long, sluggishly slow and uninspired (although lavishly budgeted) 1993 remake.

The film follows mostly one young German officer, Oberleutenant Wisse, who in autumn 1942 is affected as liaison to a Romanian division fighting on German 6th Army flank, south to Stalingrad. Once Soviet counteroffensive breaks the front, Romanians have to retreat towards the city and find themselves surrounded together with 6th Army and some other allied troops, mostly Croatian volunteers and Russian auxilliaries fighting for Germans. At that moment Wisse is reaffected again to the 6th Army, with which he remains until the end of the campaign. Initially an artillery battery commander, he later leads an ad hoc rifle platoon made from the gunners, once the ammunition for howitzers is exhausted.

The fighting scenes are not exactly the best thing in the world cinema but they are still honest and credible. As this film is in black and white, some original World War II footage could be included and the effect is quite pleasant. There are some small errors, like including pictures of T-34/85 Soviet tanks in the battle - in fact they arrived on the front only in January 1944, one year after the battle of Stalingrad was over... But that is a minor thing.

The superiority of this film on its 1993 remake resides essentially in the scenario, the dialogs and the well developped secondary characters: the cowardly major Linkmann, the noble and fearless chaplain, Father Busch, aged Romanian general Codreanu, the no-nonsense Panzer commander Oberstleutenant Kesselbach, and the three veteran soldiers closest to Wisse - Feldwebel Bose, Gefreiter Kramer and Wachmeister Kunowski. There is a narrator who leads us through the story and at decisive moments we can also see some of the highest ranking commanders, beginning with Hitler himself and his principal military collaborator, Generalfeldmarshall Keitel (here for some reason disguised under the name of ""Zeitler"").

General (later Generalfeldmarshall) Paulus is particularly well described, as a commander who was clearly promoted above his abilities and predispositions - it can be safely assumed that if the 6th Army have been commanded by Rommel, Manstein, Model or von Kluge, most of its soldiers could have been saved and Germans defeat in this battle would have been much less catastrophic. Two other German generals are also showed - Walther von Seydlitz-Kurzbach, a very lucid Paulus subordonate and especially Hermann ""Papa"" Hoth, who led the effort to break the encirclement of 6th Army.

The ugly face of the war and the sufferings of soldiers are not hidden - men are crushed by tanks or mutilated by artillery shells, they loose limbs to frostbite, die from starvation caused diseases or even get shot by their own officers if they attempt to desert. Absurdities which happen occasionnally in every war take here a particularly dramatic dimension, when a slow and fragile Junkers 52 plane, which at great risk to its crew dodged Soviet flak and fighters, delivers to starving soldiers in Stalingrad... Hitler's portraits, which were loaded by error!

But still, this film is much less nihilistic than 1993 version - at the end, 91 thousand Germans (and a handful of Romanians and Croatians) are taken prisoners (Russian Wehrmacht auxilliaries still alive at that moment were immediately executed). The death march to Siberia begins and we can see that already some terminally exhausted men drop dead before even making five miles - but still, 6 thousand people will finally come back to Germany, in 1958. Including maybe some of those who made it until final credits...

This is a very very good war movie and which is even more interesting, this is a rare German war movie about World War II. It is hard to find, but it is worth to be bought and kept preciously.",1329436800,4,4140,5.0
7913095,5,B00000JPGY,"Considering the time period when this was made, 1950's and the subject was still a very raw nerve with the German population, this is an excellent recounting of the Battle that changed the course of history for at least 60 years. Let's face it, if it was not for Stalingrad there would not have been a Cold War sending shivers down the spines of those who grew up in the swinging sixties and the mediocre but still tense seventies.
The acting is 'hammy', it always is in 40's, 50's 60,s movies no matter where they are made !!!!!!!!!!!! The subject matter is well treated, few 'punches' are 'pulled' and it is a very worthwhile addition to anyone's collection of books and films about Stalingrad. One aspect of the events leading up to the Encirclement, the actions, fighting capabilities and equipment of the Romanians, usually blamed for the speed and ease with which the Red Army broke through the Axis lines, is given rather sympathetic treatment and one can more easily understand how and why they caved in under the Soviet onslaught.",1289779200,2,1039,4.745856353591161
7913096,5,B00000JPGY,"1950's German cinema, bereft of the cultural contributions which became the ""New German Cinema"" of the late 60's and 70's, is an interesting period in filmmaking.  This Stalingrad opus is a beautiful anti-war film, and historically accurate as you can get.  Original Uniforms, actors who were German soldiers themselves during the war, and T-34's rolling over trenchlines.  For those of whom love the series 08/15 this is a must.  The only historical error that I can pick up would be the MG-42's replacing the 34.  But outside of this supply issue (as most of the 34's had been in use in Israel for some time) the film is great.",1175644800,7,629,4.73394495412844
7913097,3,B00000JPGY,"I have always been a fan of this movie and would recommend it to any student of Stalingrad.  While the resolution of the DVD works well on a HDTV, I doubt if the DVD contains the original theatrical release version.  The DVD contains the 4:3 formated movie, so don't foget to set your DVD player to this unless you want to see it stretched out on your widescreen TV.",1149292800,4,366,4.2898550724637685
7913098,2,B00000JPGY,"This movie is a disappointment considering it was made at a time when so many of the survivors were still alive and recently freed from Russian captivity.  The film covers the experiences of a veteran German officer assigned as an advisor to a Rumanian Army Corps on the eve of the Stalingrad encirclement.  The film does not go into any kind of depth either in terms of character development or story line to explain the importance and tragedy of Stalingrad.  One must think that it even disappointed it's original German viewers of the 1950's who probably desired some kind of explanation for the disaster of Stalingrad and the Nazi era.

As an anti-war film this film is a failure; as a shoot 'em up action war film it is droll.  All in all this is less satisfying than a made for TV movie of the same period.",1147392000,8,812,4.496598639455782
7913099,4,B00000JPGY,"This gets a 4 star under doubt. [German version]

Frank Wisbar spent the 1930s in the States and most of WWII there too. When he caught up on the theme of WWII in Germany in the late 1950's he did so without the causcious guilt many of his politically tainted countrymen posessed.

Where ""Enemy at the Gates"" is an embarrassing performance tumpets and bravado, ""Stalingrad"" a show of German theatrical performance, ""H&uuml;nde, wollt ihr ewig leben"" almost comes down to the level of ""I say chaps, Stalingrad is awfully chilly, hm?""...

However, as for sticking to historical facts it scores. It touches in on the German arrogance and prejudice even against her own allies. Anecdotes of how things aren't right are sometimes played down to subtile hints which is almost unusual in German films. Modern German directors, please take notes here...

The relatively low budgets on battle scenes in spite, this is a good movie with a even pace towards the end. If you like the old school war movies and would like to see a German view, this is worth the time. But keep in mind that Wisbar didn't make full use of his material - Read Beevor to catch up on events, and ""As far as my feet will carry me""/""So weit die F&uuml;sse tragen"" (Clemens Forell) about life/dispair in the Soviet POW camps after the war. I recommend the 08/15 series for a movie look at the Germans in WWII. Why on Gods green planet isn't it released on DVD to an English language audience?

PS: the German villain is well played by Wolgang Preiss. Oddly enough, as the battle of Stalingrad begun he enjoyed his fame in the role as a dashing nazi pilot hero in ""Die Grosse Liebe"" (1942).",1121731200,20,1652,4.605442176870748
