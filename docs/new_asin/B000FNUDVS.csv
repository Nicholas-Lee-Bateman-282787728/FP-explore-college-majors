Besides Cinzia Forte looking ravishing in the total roll of Lisetta (and she sings too!!) you get a chorus of ladies direct from a shopping spree at Victoria's Secret.  I must admitt that musically, it took awhile for me to get into this opera.  I wasn't at all familar with the score.  In fact, after the first act, I put the disc back into the box and forgot about it for a week. I then came back to Act II and watched Act I immediately afterwards.  Once everything clicked and I got into the director's mood of things, I couldn't stop raving to myself about the score. It absolutely gets better as it goes along. The Gran Teatre del Liceu does it again with another innovative production.  Singers to watch for besides Forte are Bruno Pratico, Pietro Spagnoli and Charles Workman.  They do some outstanding vocalizing.  This DVD stays on my coffee table until I've watched it a few more times but would somone tell me why we couldn't have the entire opera on one disc at a lower price?  I have ALL five hours of TRISTAN UND ISOLDE on ONE DVD.  All of a sudden it's like the DVD companies realized they could charge twice the amount if the split the operas on two discs.

8124883,2,B000FNUDVS,"A typical Rossini's opera. Beautiful and powerful music. The orchestra and the singing at best. I am extremely annoyed by the dancing and extra activities. It distracts the viewers from the singing and music. I am trying to find another production, however no luck. I will not recommend this version. You can hear it but not watch it.",1441324800,3,334,4.775862068965517
8124884,4,B000FNUDVS,"I like Rossini's La Cenerentola a lot.  Although this one shares the same overture as far as I can tell, I've had a hard time finishing it.  It's taken me four viewing sessions already but I've only managed to watch 2/3 of it.  Perhaps it doesn't have the same catchy arias, i.e. too many ""commercial breaks"", or I just find the plot too confusing to follow.  So far I don't know why the opera is titled La Gazzetta, it doesn't have much to do with the Gazzetta, but then I never knew why the Magic Flute was called the magic flute when the flute only got a cameo role?  I just need some dedicated time to view it again and pay much more attention to the subtitles to see what is going on.  It is still enjoyable, nice singing, props(chicken puppets), jokes.  I'll update this review when I can appreciate it a bit more...",1368057600,,822,4.298701298701299
8124885,5,B000FNUDVS,"I have over 100 opera and ballet DVD/BR's that I watch on a projected screen about 7' 8"" wide and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the left and right speakers are about 9' 6"" apart. The room has sound treatments. The goal is to make the viewing experience as if I was there in a middle seat in one of the front rows.

I watched this opera buffa last night and in parts again today.
Picture is as usual very good, good lighting and brilliant colors. Plenty of stage shots, which work well with a projector.
Audio (PCM 5.1) is top notch. It startled me just after a few bars into the overture, when the first violins set in: directly out of the left surround! Whoa, I thought, is this overdoing it?
But as I listened more, it became clear what the stronger inclusion of the surrounds actually did: they created a layer of the orchestra in front and the singers on the stage behind it. In essence, it created the orchestra pit.
The recording of the voices is perfectly clear but soft enough to get the impression of this stage depth. The voices also move along as the singers move across (6 stage microphones) and it truly gives you the impression of being there. I don't think you can do it much better than this.
Andy Rose came to my mind about half a dozen times during the performance and, sure enough, he is responsible for the sound.
So from a recording standpoint, I can truly recommend this one.
As for the performance, singing, acting and dancing is quite good. I knew Spagnoli and Pratico from The Barber of Seville. I liked them there as well as here. The other principals were also fine (we can't have Netrebko in everything). All had to act quite a bit while singing and I thought they did well.
Part of the costumes could be right out of Victoria's Secrets catalog, garter belts and all. You will have to decide whether that's good or bad...",1319068800,2,1864,4.4186046511627906
8124886,4,B000FNUDVS,"The music is typical Rossini, meaning light and tuneful, guaranteed to have your feet tapping with many good duets, trios etc. The performers obviously enjoyed themselves acting and singing in this fluffy light opera. The story is not very intellectually taxing and this is an opera to relax with and enjoy its light heartedness and silliness. Rossini was suprisingly ahead of his time with his main plot of advertising and even more so with procuring a bride as the central focus. Last night was my second attempt at viewing and it was put aside for some time as the trite storyline was an initial turnoff. So you have to be in the right mood to be non critical and go with the flow. But that is not to say it is faultless - I could do without a couple of the rather boring recitatives. Top quality video with colourful costuming and good audio.

It is no masterpiece but worth adding to the collection.

8124887,3,B000FNUDVS,Rossini has composed finer operas but its one you cant dislike and will listen to again over the years.,1264809600,,103,4.473684210526316
8124888,2,B000FNUDVS,"In the fifteen years since Dario Fo had perpetrated his tasteless version of `The Barber of Seville' for the Netherlands Opera, I had hoped that he would have learnt the meaning of the word `restraint'. On the basis that this was the only DVD version available, was a production from the Gran Teatra del Liceu in Barcelona and had received four very good reviews here on Amazon, I decided to take a chance. I am writing this review to help other fans that enjoy the light, tuneful operas of Rossini, Offenbach and Donizetti from making the same mistake I made.

I think the most positive thing I can say about this production is that it is extremely colorful, almost, but not quite, to the point of being gaudy. Having said that, almost everything else needs to be qualified. Perhaps I am being a little unfair, the singing actually was quite good considering this is one of Rossini's less familiar works and the absence of world-class artists meant one's attention was not concentrated on anyone in particular. However, at so many times during this production, the choreography/shenanigans/'stage-business' that Dario Fo is known for, is happening on stage and is a dreadful distraction. All of the designer/director's clichs are presented here, people parading to and fro across the stage waving flags, people doing cartwheels, women shaking sheets, everyone finding the need to step up on a box or some other object to stand out from the crowd. There were also some new ones including dancing nuns in white habits, roller-skating men in their `tidy whities', a nude `dancing' life-sized marionette and someone in an ape-suit rolling around the stage. None, I repeat none, of these gimmicks should be necessary in a well-designed and directed performance of this work.

The stage-set for this production comprises a very decorative pedestrian bridge that spans from one side of the stage to the other and a `do-it-yourself' ramp and stairs that appears on the right of the stage in Act 1, and on the left in Act 2. Sometimes the bridge was lifted out of sight but there was very little else on stage during the entire performance. For variety, there were two scenes where the set was lit by single color stage lighting, firstly red and then later blue where everyone is cavorting around the stage wearing white clothes, but there did not seem any apparent reason for this.

This opera is quite similar to Rossini's 'Il Viaggio a Reims' presented in Paris by the Mariinsky Theatre in that a motley group of people arrive at a hotel and things start to go happen. Here the costumes are also colorfully extravagant but the characters are individually more interesting. There is also a similarity with the staging, minimal in the extreme; however, the end result is something completely different and hugely entertaining.

This was the first, of more than a hundred operas that I have on DVD, where I became bored and wondered how much longer until the final curtain came down. This same feeling must have been experienced by many in the audience during the recording of this work as applause throughout the opera was only polite rather than enthusiastic and many rushed out of the theater as soon as it was over without waiting to congratulate the artists.",1216944000,7,3255,4.870036101083032
8124889,5,B000FNUDVS,"All the previous reviewers have sung the praises of this production quite elequently. I wish only to disagree with the reviewer who expresses reservations about Bruno Pratico in the role of Pomponio. To my taste, Pratico occupied that role so fully that I could hardly imagine staging the opera if he weren't available. He was ""hecka funny"".

Dario Fo's staging of The Barber of Seville is likewise a marvel of wit and whimsy, the most enjoyable version of that opera available on DVD.",1174694400,4,485,4.843373493975903
8124890,5,B000FNUDVS,"""Pulchritude"": physical beauty, comeliness.

My, my. No more opera with the women done up like wedding cakes... these lovely gals are done up  something more like sundaes, with cherries on top. There is nothing serious about this opera, but neither will your sides particularly hurt from laughing...just a wry smile here, and amusement there, and perhaps a raised eyebrow, and a cleaning of eyeglasses, replaying the scene and peering more intently at the comeliness of the lasses, and the set, the lighting, the colors, the designs...all a parade of novelty and ""titillation""...ha! This one is for fun. And all participants have  a glorious time of it, cavorting, gesturing, posing, kicking bare legs up high, flaunting, flirting, sworling on stage in great hordes, sworling off stage in great striding leaps, dancing waltzes, getting happy, flustered, angry,gesticulating wildly...  and did I mention singing?

All Rossini fans will delight in this confection, this operatic bon bon.

I have admired and followed  Simon Orfila in ""Viaggio a Reims"" by Rossini and ""I Puritani"" by Bellini, and was hoping to hear some more great oratorios by this great baritone, but his part was small in this one.

Small matter, though - for the Cinzia Forte is most entertaining, and Charles Workman makes a very lovely sounding  tenor indeed.

This is worthy of your collection for its  aesthetic novelty and just pure fun. The Gran Teatra del Liceu really knows how to put on an opera. I am always impressed by the array of talent this opera company attracts, the great musicians, and set builders, seamstresses, dancers, chorus....it all works, every time. Congratulations and high praises to Barcelona for making opera beautiful, glorious, majestic and fun again.

You will not be disappointed in the music, unless you have a low end sound system which only places the orchestra a hundred meters away. Do invest in a good sound system, and bring the singers and orchestra INTO your room with you. Vacuum tubes happen to do this best of all, with their very pleasant, and musically sounding 2nd harmonics.",1162684800,15,2094,5.090643274853801
8124891,5,B000FNUDVS,"My first impression of this production of ""La Gazzetta"" was poor due to the timid, almost amateurish delivery of the Overture (from La Cenerentolla).  The dance/ballet/vaudeville inclusions inspired by this operas French setting was also jarring in the beginning.  My perception slowly gained confidence and by the end of the second act I ccouldn't stop loving this opera or production!  It takes the whole package to see past what appear to be imperfections that unfold into art by the close of the piece.

This productions greatest strength is its recycled heritage and anonymity.  La Gazzetta itself is a hodgepodge of new material, reworked material and direct transplantation of other material making it a seemingly incongruent piece.  It has most in common with Il Turco in Italia, borrowing a few numbers from that opera along with it's basic structure. The difference here is that the dramatic weaknesses from Il Turco where given attention by Rossini and Palomba back then with contemporary elaboration added now in the form of additional text (which seem  recitative and  operatic numbers) and staging  to further support the progress made by its creators.

This is where its strengths play in: its hodgepodge essence allows for further addition and subtraction of numbers or text and its anonymity allows for such revisions and alterations to be accepted by the public.  Most of the additions made serve to accentuate the ""play within a play"" concept cementing any lose ends the original production may have exhibited in the realm of believability.  It's high comedy at it's best.

The worst part of this opera in my opinion is the overture so don't be alarmed by its poor quality, the musical direction in the rest of the opera is top notch.  You can tell the maestro has a special place in his heart for Rossini because the score comes alive with bright, vivid orchestration, and most importantly for me: lively tempi (a must for this period of Italian opera).  The complaint over the audio options another reviewer mentioned is true to an extent, I found the stereo sound to be fine as an alternative to DTS (which I couldn't utilize either).

The performers were, all in all, fantastic and at least qualified to sing their parts.  The standout performers for me were Charles Workman (Alberto), Doralice (Marisa Martins), Pietro Spagnoli (Filippo) and the singing of (Cinzia Forte).  Forte's acting wasn't the greatest but her high notes and control were incredible.  Martins was the most charismatic and a great vocalist for her range while Workman managed to breath comedic life into your traditional Cavalier stock character (his vocals where top quality too).  Spagnoli excelled as the successful inkeeper and man-in-love with that made man quality all too evident in his stage presence.

Agata Bienkowska did well in her role as Madame La Rose, playing up the playful temptress aspect of her character even though she acts as a mere bystander throughout most of the production.  Orfila as Traversen and Canturri as Anselmo were part of the ensembles and recitative only so their roles are minor and forgettable.  Lastly, Pratico as Pomponio may be an acquired taste.  He managed well for the first act of the opera but seemed to slow down during the first act finale and into the second act.  At times, I wasn't sure if he was concentrating or about to keel over from exhaustion.  His range of facial expressions during complicated numbers was extremely limited and he only really shined dramatically during the recitatives.

Last but not least is the appearance and stage direction.  Before I had known of the existence of this DVD, I had always imagined this opera taking place in either the 30's, 40's, or early 20th century in general.  Needless to say, that period fits the context of this opera rather well as Dario Fo also discovered.  His costumes, set designs and direction are superb with an emphasis on both the elegance and fun of art deco and modernist movements.

I highly recommend this production for Rossini fans first and anyone else interested in a good time (musically of course).",1159833600,20,4119,4.986822840409956
