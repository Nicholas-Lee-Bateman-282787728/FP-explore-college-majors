8700750,5,B00D8UFTTG,"First, this is an unusual flight, since we're delivering a short range regional prop all the way from France to Brazil.  Second, it's four hours of video, all of excellent quality.  Third, there's almost no filler, which is a first for a Blu-Ray from Just Planes.  Fourth, it's got the most thorough cockpit presentation you will find anywhere.

Fifth, there are long stretches from each angle.  My biggest (maybe only) complaint about the Blu-Rays is that Just Planes keeps making them out like a movie.  They are chronological, switching angles frequently.  Here we get some of that, but we also get long periods where they stick with one point of view, replaying the sequence in time from another camera.  It is great.  With a couple caveats.  They sometimes jump a couple minutes, so it's discontinuous.  They sometimes play stupid music over the visual instead of giving us ATC.  They sometimes superimpose two cameras on top of each other, which I find basically unwatchable.

But all that aside, this is one of the three best Blu-Rays (Swiss to San Fran and Iberia to Mexico City I think are the other two, but I haven't seen them all).",1376870400,,1143,4.770408163265306
