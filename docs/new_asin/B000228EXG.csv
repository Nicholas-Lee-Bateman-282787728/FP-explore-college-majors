At first I was confused and irritated by the American character's accent not sure if it was put on and a little dodgy. But once I got past that and the British characters' constant swearing, rather than putting me off, the film pulled me in with it's clever -RESERVOIR DOGS with a side order of Chop Suey - narrative.
It's simple, two amateur hoods bungle a robbery, get caught and have to protect a gangsters belongings till midnight, having to battle various Triad gangs along the way......
Unlike many independent features, this one actually managed to pull off some ambitious fight sequences, had some interesting characters and kept the narrative together right till the end -even though it was set in one location.
It was genuinely entertaining. Not perfect, but very capable and well worth checking out if you want something different!.
Go on try it. You know you'll love it.",1084233600,,933,4.8375
