8603517,3,B00EBDXTZU,"I'll make this quick.  This is an indie film made on a modest budget with actors and actresses who were unfamiliar to me.
You know how, in so many movies, at some point the title of the movie appears in a line that a character speaks?  No-
that doesn't happen here!  Nowhere is there an explication of ""Molly's Theory of Relativity"", other than learning she's a
bright astrophysicist who unexpectedly got fired from a good job because she ran afoul of academic/corporate politics.
As she tries to put her life back together she's living in an apartment with her boyfriend and it happens to be Halloween.
A variety of people show up unexpectedly, from kids in the building trick-or-treating, to family and friends--often at
rather inconvenient times, as they are nude in bed together.  The best recommendation I can give is that yes, there is full
frontal nudity from time to time, both male and female.  There is occasional frank discussion about sex.  And plenty of
discussion about family, jobs, ambition, marriage and the like.  Essentially it's a film about a young lady's first major life
crisis as she confronts the first significant failure in her life and debates whether or not to stay with her somewhat under-
performing husband.  Some have said that ""some of the characters that show up are real and others are not; they appear to be her memories from the past"" etc.  I'll go one step further and throw out the hypothesis that: THERE NEVER IS ANYONE IN THE APARTMENT except for Molly and her husband.  See if it makes sense that way?  Or not.",1414540800,,1553,4.714814814814815
8603518,1,B00EBDXTZU,i purchased to watch on a 5 hour flight. the preview looked funny and like a typical arthouse/inde flick I'd enjoy but I couldn't watch more than 15 minutes of it. i have no idea what the plot was supposed to be and most of the dialogue was between one another with screaming and yelling. Waste of money on this one.,1406764800,,316,4.19672131147541
8603519,5,B00EBDXTZU,"A cast from age eight to eighty-five bewitches the viewer in this moving, funny, (very) sexy, drama about family, love, and how we value our careers.  And it all takes place on Halloween. I wish I'd seen it in a theatre. On the other hand it is such a lovely and intimate story I was just as happy to see it with my husband.  If you've ever lost anyone you're close to this movie will hit home in wondrous ways. And even if you haven't you will appreciate everyone around you that much more.  A trick-or-treating little girl dressed as Albert Einstein virtually steals the show.",1397520000,,578,4.433962264150943
