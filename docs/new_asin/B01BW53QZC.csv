My guess is several hundred people will be dumping their copies on whomever else is deceived. The Good: Great cover! Took me back to the first video stores that opened in the 80's (where a hundred dollar deposit had to be left for each tape you rented). Also, the trailers of the three other movie releases were fun...even the one without any English spoken (Titled ""I Spit on Your F---ing Grave B-----). The Bad: The alternatiove cut (Night of Terror) begins with an apology for the condition of the movie, which is shot on video so it is pretty bad anyway but the warning is appreciated. The Ugly...Everything else. Forget the horrible acting, stupid framing, insane plot points, dialogue, music, etc etc......if I am going to watch a bad movie this amaturishly done I expect a hint more nudity than what is on the cover and some gore (nearly non existent except for a sequence at the end involving a melting wax head representation of one of the actresses. I could go on and on but the real question if you made it this far is ""Is it bad enough to be good?"" (Where you have some like-minded friends and ""movie helper"" to go along with the feature). The answer is.....barely. There are so many more movies for that kind of evening (Bloodsucking Freaks, Pieces etc etc). I wish I had bought a poster of the cover instead of the film.",1460332800,6,1429,4.56420233463035
8751693,4,B01BW53QZC,"This is another insane SOV horror movie from the '80's.  Escape is all over the place.  We're in an insane asylum, then we're in a haunted house, then we're enjoying a terrible unknown '80's band play out for 3 songs.  This is vintage SOV at its strangest.  At times very boring, other times, funny, all the time weird, I would give a solid recommendation for this title for seasoned SOV/Massacre Video fans.  There's fun to be had here if your tolerance level is high enough.  Better than Frozen Scream.  For the rabid so-bad-it's good/so-bad-it's-insane crowd only.  And by the way, the stuff on the video cover doesn't actually happen in the movie.",1459641600,2,651,4.75
