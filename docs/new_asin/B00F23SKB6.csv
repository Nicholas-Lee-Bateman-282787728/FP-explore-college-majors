8611678,5,B00F23SKB6,By far the style of knife fighting I've studied most n I study Kali with someone who's a student of a Kali instructor n we play 1st blood using red lipstick n I've never lost. I have Celtic n Apache blood n I'd love more.,1435017600,,221,3.933333333333333
8611679,2,B00F23SKB6,"The DVDs are filmed in a gym where Mr. Blocker is giving a class to a small group of beginning students.  This is not a high-quality production, rather it appears that someone just brought a camera into the gym and filmed the class as it was being given.

The instruction is all very basic, and the students in the class all appear to be new to martial arts in general and to knife work specifically.  I have very basic training in Sayoc Kali (I am not an expert in any sense of the word), and with this basic understanding of knife work found little value in Mr. Blockers DVDs.

This being said, it should not be taken as a criticism of Mr. Blockers personal skill, rather just a comment on the quality of the DVD production itself.  A more professionally produced DVD intended for training would be of value.  Unfortunately, filming a class from the side of a gym with a camcorder just doesnt measure up in either quality or instructional value.",1384387200,8,947,4.476744186046512
8611680,5,B00F23SKB6,I was highly impressed with Blocker's apache knife strategies.  What he teaches is effective and based on sound knife tactics.  There is quite a lot of material covered over the 3 DVDs.  I like the fact that instructional topics are broken down by chapters which seemed effortless to navigate through on the DVDs.  The instruction was easy to understand and follow.  Highly recommend this set for those seeking to improve knife skills!,1380153600,3,435,4.986111111111111
8611681,5,B00F23SKB6,Fantastic training video!  It is broken down from basic to very advanced.  Apache knife battle tactics are world renowned!  I highly recommend obtaining knife skills. These days everyone carries a weapon.,1379635200,2,204,5.516129032258065
