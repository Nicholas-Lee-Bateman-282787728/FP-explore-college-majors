They have taken control of Japan, and are hunting down and killing any and all opposition. This is only the beginning of the chaos. The true enemy has yet to be revealed. Many twists and turns are around the corner, and all of them will shock you!

This anime really surprised me. There are tons of giant robot animes out there, and most of them are pretty average. This one rises above the average series in the Mech genre. The animation, soundtrack, and voice acting are all great. There are lots of really cool and memorable characters. This anime also has tons of action, drama, comedy, romance, and fanservice. It's not for kids. There is some strong language, nudity, and some suggestive stuff herein. Overall, this anime is great. It reminded me of Gundam Seed Destiny, RahXephon, and Full Metal Panic. I think that if you liked any of those titles, you'll probably like Linebarrels of Iron.",1355702400,,1057,4.713513513513513

8406946,5,B003VOVVWI,"Watching Season One left me wanting more &, after a very long wait, I was FINALLY able to get my hands on Season Two.  I must say, pretty much the only disappointment about this season was how long it took Funimation to release it (& the lack of ""extras"" compared to Season One).

This set is packaged pretty much the same as the first, which seems to be Funimations standard way of releasing sets nowadays. Episodes 13 through 24 are divided between two discs. Each DVD, in its own thin case, are housed together in a slipcase made of a good/heavy cardstock paper.  With a run time of approximately 300 minutes, Season Two carries the same MA (mature) rating as Season One due to some nudity (mostly female), a bit of rough language, & violence.  The extras are not anything special, just textless songs & trailers of other Funimation offerings (again, pretty much the Funi standard nowadays. Sigh...).

Season Two is where the action & the storyline really picks up the pace.  This season is a bit darker than the first, but still maintains a sense of humor that keeps it from getting too heavy & serious.  Episode 13 starts out light-hearted & funny, but quickly turns dark with betrayal.  The connection between Linebarrel & Emi Kizaki is beginnig to reveal itself. We also get to watch the main character, Kouichi Hayase, mature- although he still acts rash & reckless a bit more than he should. The following episodes let us in on how Linebarrel, the JUDA & Katou Organizations, & various members of each organization came to be. While flashbacks have a tendency to drag a storyline down, that is simply not the case for this series. The viewer gets brief, quick flashbacks that explain much about what has happened & how it connects to what is happening. The plot twists & surprises keep the viewer interested & on the edge of your seat until the end. Even the ending is surprising!

If you watched Season One, then Season Two is a must watch.  While I believe that Season Two is better than Season One, it could not be what it is without it. I also have to say that I think the dub was very well done & that the music fits the series perfectly. The entire series is incredible!

Linebarrels of Iron, while being a mecha anime, is one I highly recommend for fans of any genre of anime. It has a bit of everything- action, mecha, drama, comedy, mystery, harem- you name it. While I thoroughly enjoyed the series, I must warn against the OVA. Avoid it at all costs. It's REALLY bad.",1305072000,2,2487,4.541387024608501
8406947,2,B003VOVVWI,"This series is described by having an unlikable main character as an unusual hero. That could have been bad or different. The show comes to be mostly bad. You expect this is a mecha series, which would mean plenty of action. Honestly that is included, but it feels like everything else comes first. Going back to the show's first season it would have been better if the 2 or 3 main characters, Hayase, Emi, and maybe the Juda Corporation president were almost the only ones. Instead a team of more annoying Juda members make this a series of odd humor where robots should be. Although you could still say it has it's moments. As bad as it is, it's not bad enough to rank in the worst I've ever seen. The point is this is really bad, but short of the worst.

The animation is good, what you would expect from a recent show. This is almost certainly a show to avoid. I was so hopeful it could be the next great series, and it turned out to be everything else.",1300665600,2,957,4.287292817679558
