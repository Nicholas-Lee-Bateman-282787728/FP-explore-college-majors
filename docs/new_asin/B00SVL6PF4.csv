8699463,3,B00SVL6PF4,"I have followed the Genshiken series since I first discovered it in its Japanese manga form, many years ago.  I bought tankobon editions whenever they were available.  I then bought all the manga, when they were released over here in English.  I also bought the anime DVDs, both in Japanese and the hybrid versions, when they finally came over to the U.S.  I have enjoyed this insightful look into Otaku Culture over in Japan.
Unlike our version over here, which is considered only slightly nerdy, otaku in Japan are looked down on by almost everyone (as we discover, even by other otaku!).  Bringing any group of them together for anything is hard to imagine, but here it happens.
The latest set, mislabeled here as ""Season 2"", is actually the third season, or fourth, if you count the OVAs.  We get to see the recent heavy influence of women on the subculture, especially those heavily devoted to their own specialized materials.  Since this might be read by underage folks, I won't elaborate further.  The series also includes a subplot, where one of the club's alumni has a tangled relationship with several present and alumni members, with only one of them being romantic on his part.
The set, as issued by NIS America, is very well manufactured.  The picture book is nice, but doesn't present anything new or really interesting for a devoted fan like me.  The box is also nice, but why have two separate cases for the disks, one for the TV series, and another for the one related OVA?  Seems like a huge waste of BluRay capabilities, and another lame excuse to drive up the price.
The quality of each episode is as expected.  However, this is only available as subtitled, so the North American voice actors from the previous seasons are left out, kind of ruining some of the experience for me.  Personally, I would rather have seen the money that went into the picture book instead having gone to pay the voice actors to reprise their roles, and to hire new people for the new characters.  However, NIS America  does no dubbed shows.  Period.
As I have seen so many times on other NIS America releases, the quality of subtitling is lacking.  Often incorrect particles appear, or occasional misspellings of words that most everyone on the Internet gets wrong, as well as inappropriate use of punctuation.
If they're going to do this ""premium"" edition on the cheap, they should reduce the price accordingly, instead of selling an inferior product for too high of a price.  It's as if NIS America is in Japan, thinking they can charge whatever they like, and it won't hurt sales, because the stupid otaku will buy enough units to make it cost effective.  Wrong!  Quite a few NIS America-released titles end up being sold for far less, after piles of them never move from warehouses.
The quality is only on the surface, without a professional presentation throughout.  The only reason this company can get away with pushing out these loss leaders, is because they import and retool a lot of games from Japan for the North American market.  Otherwise, they would've long since gone out of business.
My recommendation is do pick this up, but only after it's been out for a while and has dropped down to more-or-less ordinary prices.  The show streams online, at least from one legitimate source, so you can watch it there for now.  Believe it or not, the subtitling is actually better.",1426982400,5,3385,4.737201365187714
8699464,5,B00SVL6PF4,Perfect! I love Genshiken and it is just as advertised happy to add it to my collection.,1425081600,,88,4.235294117647059
8699465,2,B00SVL6PF4,"Don't get me wrong- I love the original series that was released. I even have the complete manga set. But releasing this title without a English Dub is outright plain wrong. The original anime is loved by a lot of American Otaku here but it is because they watched the series on the late night adult swim block on the cartoon network years ago with it's English Dub. It was actually the very first anime I watched completely through with Cowboy Bebop coming in second. NIS America should have done their homework a little more and realized this wouldn't work with most fans of the original series without a English track. Hopefully in the near future NIS will re-release this set and do things the right way. I honestly don't think fans would mind paying a little more to get the Dub.
I do know there are some Otaku fans out there that will only watch anime shows in a subtitle only format- however most if not all Otaku I know want a Dub track",1423526400,10,944,4.4
