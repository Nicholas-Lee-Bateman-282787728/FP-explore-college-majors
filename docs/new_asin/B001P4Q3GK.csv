8332079,1,B001P4Q3GK,It is very old and out dated. This movie was based on couponing in 2007. Should be a free movie not 1.99.,1476403200,,105,3.8181818181818183
8332080,3,B001P4Q3GK,"Save your money and read a better couponing boom for free from your library. This was not a bust by any means, just disappointing and out-dated for the cosy.",1469750400,,157,4.448275862068965
8332081,4,B001P4Q3GK,This was a little more realistic than the show on TLC. It actually shows you what the recycling centers look like. They didn't try to entertain. They just try to tell you the truth about extreme couponing.,1404086400,,205,4.5675675675675675
8332082,4,B001P4Q3GK,"I heard about this documentary on AllThoseThingsILove dot com and just finished viewing it.
My guess is that Your Mileage May Vary is what inspired the creators of the TLCs ""Extreme Couponing"". I found it very entertaining and without all the fake drama of the TV program.

These people were the original Extreme Couponers! Originally filmed in 2007, the information is still relevant. And its interesting learning how these people came to coupon, their thoughts and methodology of the hobby, and the reactions they've received from others.",1306368000,4,540,5.206896551724138
8332083,5,B001P4Q3GK,"Having been a serious coupon user for several months I thought I wouldn't learn anything from this movie but would be entertained.  I ended up having several ""A-ha"" moments and was very glad to see in person and in action several seasoned shoppers.  There are many good money saving tips that many people have no clue about.  I also loved the fact that men were portrayed as smart consumers as well as women. This is a smart, funny, and enlightening film.",1239840000,4,455,4.592592592592593
8332084,5,B001P4Q3GK,"I was a bit sceptical as to how this movie would be (Come on, a movie about coupons?), but I was very impressed.  It covers everything from ""Dumpster Diving"" to where to find coupons and you feel like you know the characters at the end of the movie.  They are definitely Real People with funny stories and great ideas on how to save on your grocery bill!  Kraft Mac & Cheese anyone?",1233014400,5,382,4.277777777777778
8332085,5,B001P4Q3GK,"This is a great film about the invisible Americans who comprise the bulk of this nation. This movie is like watching an extended conversation with all of those people in your life who the media ignores... for example, you, your friends,family and neighbors. The picture that emerges is one of decent and earnest individuals who actually think for themselves and care about helping others. An alogether interesting and enjoyable documentary film about the real character of the American people.",1231891200,6,493,5.253164556962025
