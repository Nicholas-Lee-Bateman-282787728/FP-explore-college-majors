8304125,5,B001G6LJ3Y,"Great theme of having family meals together regularly/daily instead of with friends or the t.v. It rekindled in me a desire to just enjoy supper with my wife at the dinner table.  I appreciate her passion for Christian families to gather around the meal table as a family, and fellowship around food and God's word. Although some folks may be discouraged by its emphasis due to personal misfortunes or modern cultural trends, it is still worth paying urgent attention to for it's biblical alternative, principles & relevance.  Looking forward to watching it again and sharing it with others.",1293580800,6,591,5.020408163265306
