8322128,5,B001MVX7ZG,"I have trouble imagining anyone NOT loving these films. My ONLY complaint is picture quality, but it's hardly bad enough to make for difficult viewing. As much as I love Sherlock, there ARE other quality writers from the era who had the misfortune of being overshadowed by Sherlock (I might add that Doyle himself wrote some excellent non-Sherlock mysteries). I think the problem with some reviewers is that they rate quality by how near a mystery approximates Sherlock, so if that's the standard, they're naturally going to feel letdown. I loved this series so much that I wish there were a hundred more stories in it.",1446163200,,619,4.849056603773585

8322131,1,B001MVX7ZG,"Poor quality of script, acting and production. I did not even finish watching this. I was looking forward to a really good British mystery and this failed on all fronts.",1385942400,,169,4.666666666666667
8322132,3,B001MVX7ZG,The title of the movie was more interesting than the film.  It was very low key and almost put me to sleep.,1385164800,,107,3.8636363636363638
8322133,3,B001MVX7ZG,"It was okay, but no where near the quality of a good Sherlock story.  Kept waiting for the ""ah ha"" moment.....never arrived.",1378252800,,124,4.636363636363637
8322134,5,B001MVX7ZG,"These stories are taken from authors writing detective stories at the same time the original Sherlock Holmes stories were being published. They have a great cast, the pacing is good, and whole thing really comes together quite well. Remember, these shows were produced more than 40 years ago, and are stories written by authors around 100 years ago, give or take, depending on the author. To judge these by today's standards is just plain absurd. For those of us who like things like a plot, dialogue, and some action between the characters, these are excellent shows. Highly recommended!",1373241600,4,588,5.010204081632653
8322135,5,B001MVX7ZG,"All 13 are cleverly written plots in ""The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes-Set 1"".
Unique mystery stories and appealing sleuth characters. Delightfully detailed late-Victorian sets, both indoors and out. Makes one wish they'd lived in the late 1800s.
Scotland yard gets several famous helpers in catching the crooks. Costuming is richly authentic, for wealthy aristocrats, shopkeepers, and the common folk.
The series has continual top-notch performances of some of the best British actors and actresses of the day.

Bonus: SUBTITLES. Also detailed profiles of all the authors making history with these crime investigators of Victorian days. What a bonus for mystery story readers who would like to continue with these great crime solvers. The bonus material lists the writer's other books/stories.

Episode details with no spoilers:
1. A MESSAGE FROM THE DEEP SEA. Dr. Thorndyke (sleuth creator R. Austen Freeman) using fingerprints and other scientific forensic evidence looks for a replacement to the police quick-suspect decision. Thorough evidence examination at the crime scene is, once and for all-time, proved necessary for justice.

2. THE MISSING WITNESS SENSATION. Max Carados (blind amateur detective created by Ernest Bramah, 1914) gets kidnapped by the Irish Republican Brotherhood. He admits to being 'a terrible showoff' with his abilities; even though sightless. With Carrados missing, will his affidavit be enough to convict the Irish murderer? Can he escape?

3. THE AFFAIR OF THE AVALANCHE BICYCLE & TYRE CO. Horace Dorrington (criminal/detective created by Arthur Morrison) is not beyond doing a bit of theft himself and then charging fees to his socialite client. He gets involved in the operations of a new emerging bicycle company. An obviously intentional bicycle racing accident gets Dorrington seeking insider evidence, or better yet for him--a percentage?

4. THE DUCHESS OF WILTSHIRE'S DIAMONDS. Simon Carne (gentleman thief created by Guy Newell Boothby)is socially equal to all but also secretly evolves into ""Klimo"", a crime solving genius. Carne's secretly maintains 2 identities. His disguised appearance in both of his roles makes it possible for him to co-exist and actually live next door to each of himselves. ""Klimo's"" crime solving & method explanations never end in recovered goods or catching any thief. Why?

5. THE HORSE OF THE INVISIBLE. Ghost Detective Carnacki (creator: Wm. Hope Hodgson) is asked to exorcise a horse ghost from a country home to save he engaged daughter of the family. There is an 1800s history of premature deaths of engaged girls in this family, all relating to horse ghosts. But this ghostbuster is dealing with the 20th century....JUST!

6. THE CASE OF THE MIRROR OF PORTUGAL. (Same sleuth creator as #3) A family feud over a priceless diamond obtained generations ago in revolution days has many interested pursuers, including the criminal/detective Dorrington.
A young JEREMY IRONS (Brideshead Revisited) has a bit part as a nephew, his first film appearance.

7. MADAME SARA. Dixon Druce (L. T. Meade or Elizabeth Thomasina Meade Smith-Irish creator) is involved when a will's conditions give a fortune to the lone survivor among 2 sisters and their half-brother. His whereabouts is unknown. Madam Sara and her secrets are involved in some mysterious way. What secrets can Det. Druce uncover?

8. THE CASE OF THE DIXON TORPEDO. Jonathan Pride (P.I. creator Arthur Morrison, who also invented Dorrington, #6 & #3) solves 2 crimes without his partner Martin Hewitt, who is away in the country. Russian counterfeit bills are being printed locally. At the same time, Admiralty has Pride watching a torpedo inventor's back. Are the cases related?

9. THE WOMAN IN THE BIG HAT. Lady Molly uses her intuition to outwit her male counterparts of Scotland yard. (creator is Baroness Emma Orczy, better known for 'Scarlet Pimpernel') Investigating a murder by using less-than proper methods causes Lady Molly to be taken off the case. The lead suspect, a lady in a big hat, arrives at Scotland Yard asking for Molly. She is back on the case. Will the Yard's ""Ladies Department"" solve the case & save the day again?

10. THE AFFAIR OF THE TORTOISE. (same creator as #9) P.I. Martin Hewitt is called to privately investigate a murder with a note leading to the police's obvious suspect. But the body disappears. Hewitt looks for less obvious clues. A turtle dies. Not violently.

11. THE ASSYRIAN REJUVENATOR. P.I. Romney Pringle (creator: Clifford Ashdown) uses disguises to out-maneuver other criminals--thus taking his own gains. A patient medicine con is so elusive the CID Sgt Hawkins suggests Pringle investigate, even encouraging his sometimes less-than-legal methods. Pringle is star struck with by a stage singer, Miss Suzie.

12. THE RIPENING RUBIES. Jeweler, Bernard Sutton (created by Sir Max Pemberton) outwits criminals using his professional knowledge of gems. Reward money follows solving the case. A stolen ruby necklace (one of his own creation) is offered for sale at his own shop. Another gem of a case to solve?

13. THE CASE OF LAKER, ABSCONDED. Partners, Hewitt & Pride (see creator of #9 & #10) look for a bank clerk who ran off with a huge amount of cash. The trail seems much to easy to follow, which causes the P.I. team to consider another direction and case conclusion, while the Yard looks in France for the culprit. The missing suspect's fiancee may hold the clues needed.

Created in the 1970s, but filmed so well, and being a Victorian series, this is a timeless set of mystery productions. Packed with suspense, drama, thriller, mystery, and even some comedy and romance. What's not to like? As good as any of today's Mystery Theatre TV events.",1323993600,8,5730,5.19284940411701
