His lovely wife Elaine (LaLa) is another credit to his training.  Together they are the FITNESS couple of the Millennium!  I recommend this tape to ALL my patients.  As a doctor of internal medicine I truly endorse the notion of exercise to maintain good health.  Mr. LaLanne is a memory from MY childhood that HAS NOT DIED!  He will live forever with this tape and his writings.  Don't miss this!  Give it to your parents or grand-parents, and if they have already passed on, get it for YOURSELF!  Have a great life, get and STAY in shape!...He is for real and a National Treasure!",981676800,60,728,4.565891472868217

7863671,4,6304164831,I have always admired Jack and his dedication to helping people stay healthy. This tape is OK for any age but particularly good for older people. He shows how to do an exercise and then says that he knows you may not be able to do this but do the best you can and you will improve. Very relaxed and down-home type presentation.,1453248000,,327,4.2063492063492065

7863674,5,6304164831,"Couldn't find this on DVD (yet) but fortunately I still have a VHS player.  Both Mr. and Mrs. LaLanne set the bar for fitness at any age, but especially for someone like myself who is fast approaching  60.  I watched his television program when I was a child too small to get up in a chair by myself much less hold onto it to do leg kicks.  Nowadays if I'm feeling down or my ankle held together with screws and plates hurts too much to get out of bed, I watch this tape to remind me that it is possible to grow older with with a positive attitude and a spring in my step even if I do snap, crackle and pop occasionally.  The LaLannes always make me smile.",1388448000,,656,4.054263565891473
7863675,5,6304164831,"I hope to ""inherit"" this video from my mother-in-law when she no longer uses it. Those folks that are of the era who watched Jack growing up when I did will understand there hasn't been an exercise video made like this. God bless Jack LaLanne.",1385424000,,243,4.4222222222222225
7863676,5,6304164831,I have heard of Jack LaLanne and heard that he is a good source for general body health exercises.  This video is the best I've seen covering exercises from head to toe.  Jack and his wife Elaine make the exercises they show short enough for short attention span people and interject humour to keep it engaging.  I would give this an excellent rating and recommend it for people of any age.,1299628800,10,390,4.464788732394366
7863677,4,6304164831,"It is a pleasure to have someone so enthusiastic about health and well being in a time of fad, dazzling or artificial diets and fancy exercise equipment.  Jack uses household items and pertinent comments about muscle groups and good body posture.",1299196800,6,246,5.0
7863678,5,6304164831,"I absolutely love this DVD!  Jack and Elaine have many tips to follow, good advice and this is especially a great DVD if you have a partner to help you with some of the stretches.  He does it all without outside exercise equipment and it's enough to get a novice out of breath and an experienced person a good tune-up.",1276732800,31,318,4.283333333333333
