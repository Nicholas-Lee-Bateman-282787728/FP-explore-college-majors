5317398,4,B009D4H08Y,"I've always enjoyed movies starring Cornel Wilde and I find this color version no exception.  The background of this story is based on historical events that took place during the War for American Independence. He portrays an American spy involved in discovering the traitorous actions of General Benedict Arnold and his attempt to turnover West Point to the British.  The main British spy (Major Andre, Michael Wilder) was also a historical character. George Sanders is a solid actor and also contributes to an overall good movie.",1418083200,2,531,5.162790697674419
5317399,4,B009D4H08Y,"I will first admit that I am not sure if this is historically accurate but it does seem so. My one complaint about it is that it is advertised as the story of Benedict Arnold and also to be honest, except for him being a spy for the British I didn't know much about it or him. This wasn't so much about him but instead of the British Major Andre and American infiltrator Major Bolton played by Cornel Wilde. Anne Francis has a small let's get a woman in here part. George sanders if an evil British man. I did instead enjoy the new story of the Majors but still was left hanging (get it) by the lack of Benny Arnold story. A very good movie, well acted and good story telling. I do recommend it.",1411776000,2,695,4.117647058823529

5317402,4,B009D4H08Y,"This video is a plausible, fictionalized, account of Benedict Arnold and Major Andre.  It is spectacular because of the costuming.  The different types of uniforms, especially the dragoons, make this an interesting spectacle for historians, even though the American agent story is purely notional.  The secret message systems are accurate for the period.",1374019200,7,354,5.6415094339622645
5317403,3,B009D4H08Y,"""The Scarlett Coat"" is a 1955 color historical drama about events surrounding the treason of Benedict Arnold.

Cornel Wilde (1912-89) plays a double agent who is working to uncover the identity of the traitor within the American ranks. Wilde appeared in more than 50 films and was nominated for his work in ""A Song to Remember"" (1945). He's probably best known for his work as the Great Sebastian in ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (1952) but I think his best work was in ""The Naked Prey"" (1966), a film he also directed and produced. His acting in this film is pretty wooden.

Michael Wilding (1912-79) plays Major John Andre, and though Wilding is second billed, the story really focuses on him. Wilding is probably better known for having married Elizabeth Taylor, rather than the 50+ films he appeared in.

Suave George Sanders (1906-72) appeared in hundreds of films, often as a villain. He's best remembered as film critic Addison DeWitt in ""All About Eve"" (1950) for which he won the Oscar as Best Supporting Actor. Here he plays a Tory who suspects Wilde of being a double agent.

John McIntire (1907-91) plays General Howe. McIntire had the unique distinction of filling in for an actor who died in the middle of a series (Ward Bond in ""Wagon Train""). In a career from 1947 to 1989 he made nearly 100 films and appeared in many TV shows and movies. Although he usually appeared in westerns, I remember him best for his TV series ""Naked City"" (1958). He was usually a good guy, but could also play the bad guy (e.g., ""Winchester 73"", ""The Far Country"").

Beautiful Anne Francis (1930-2011) was the award winning star of ""Honey West"" on TV (1965-6). She graced us with her beauty in films like ""Blackboard Jungle"" (1955), ""Forbidden Planet"" (1956), and ""Funny Girl"" (1968). She plays Wilde's love interest.

John Sturges (1910-1992) was nominated for an Oscar and a Palme d'Or for ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" (1955) and for a DGA for ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"" (1957), but my favorite Sturges films are ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960) and ""The Great escape"" (1963). This film has none of the action we associate with Sturges.

In 1955  ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Mister  Roberts"", Guys and Dolls"", ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and ""Picnic"" were the top 5. The Oscars went to ""Marty"" (Picture, Director, Actor), ""Mister Roberts"" (Supporting Actor), ""East of Eden"" (Supporting Actress), and ""The Rose Tatoo"" (Actress). Other notable films released that year were ""The 7 Year Itch"", ""Blackboard Jungle"", ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Oklahoma"", ""To Catch a Thief"" and ""The Virgin Queen"".

My favorite American Revolution film is John Ford's ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" (1939). ""The Crossing"" (2000) is a distant second. Most of the rest, like ""The Devil's Disciple"" (1959), ""The Howards of Virginia"" (1940), and ""John Paul Jones"" (1959) are OK.""The Patriot"" (2000) and ""Revolution"" (1985) are just plain silly. The TV mini-series ""The Adams Chronicles"" (1976). ""The Revolution"" (2006), and ""John Adams"" (2008) are probably the best sources about the period.

Bottom line - this is a pretty ordinary film.",1372982400,3,3082,4.91907514450867
