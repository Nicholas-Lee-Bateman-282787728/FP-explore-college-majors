8325479,5,B000NJ9Z6S,"Tony Little's system of exercise is absolutely the best I have ever come across.  In 45 minutes I get the best workout.  I am not overly coordinated, and his method is very systematic and straight forward.  And the best part is that it definitely produces results!",1371859200,,264,4.695652173913044
8325480,5,B000NJ9Z6S,I use this video at least once a week for the past two years.  It has sound excercise and weightlifting principles that give good results with toning muscles fairly quickly.  It is also challenging for those who are moderately in shape and so it can be used for quite some time.  Plus he doesn't flash girl body parts during this one.  Tony tends to be annoying but it does provide a good laugh while you work out.,1229040000,2,414,4.337662337662338
