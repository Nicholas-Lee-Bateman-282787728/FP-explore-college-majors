826998,3,6304286481,"Michael J. Fox is a childhood favorite of mine, so it's a little surprising Bright Lights, Big City isn't that great of a movie.  Without Michael starring in this movie however, it would have been a lot worse.  I feel given how much I admired him in the 80's, I can't really criticize this movie as much as I would had someone else starred in it.  He was obviously gaining popularity back then due to the Back to the Future movies being so successful, as well as the final season of Family Ties airing soon after.  However I suppose every actor stars in a film that's less than satisfactory, and this unfortunately is the case for poor Michael.

It's about a man played by Michael J. Fox who struggles with his job as a magazine writer (though to be fair his boss is perhaps the crankiest old lady of all-time) and if he makes one single mistake, well, let's just say perfection is the most important aspect of his career.  It's a requirement to be perfect.  Yeah right, since we're all perfect, right?  He's not allowed to make many, if any, mistakes hence the reason his boss is the worst person ever.  Then again who knows if magazine writer bosses really are that strict?  Perhaps they are.

Anyway poor Michael struggles with the stress of perfection, and eventually finds himself spending time in nightclubs for most of the first half.  Now the movie is supposed to be about Michael developing a drug addiction to help him cope with the stress of his job, as well as coping with a girlfriend who unexpectedly left him high and dry due to her achieving bigger dreams of her own (played by the adorable Phoebe Cates) but it takes SUCH a long time to get to the meat and potatoes of the storyline that for the most part the film basically dissolves into your typical 80's nonsensical partying.

We're supposed to feel bad about Michael having all these problems, but until a certain scene at the end with Michael's dying mother (truly the most hard-hitting emotional moment in the entire film) it's hard to really emphasize with Michael.  Even worse is that Kiefer Sutherland plays a know-it-all arrogant jerk who believes he can score with any chick, which is unintentionally hilarious given the success he'd later have with the 24 series.  But even worse, his character being present makes it hard to feel sorry for Michael's problems.  Kiefer's character delivers a little bit of entertainment perhaps, but at the expense of making us feel less sorry for Michael's more realistic/serious problems.  Basically Kiefer's out of place and never should have been written into the script.

There is one really funny scene when Kiefer and Michael come up with this idea to release a wild animal in the bosses office late at night only for the plan to totally backfire in more ways than one, haha.  Worth it for this moment alone (along with the scene we see of Michael sitting by his dying mom's bedside, but for entirely different reasons).  I suppose the film does succeed to a lesser extent in blending happiness, sadness and frustration together, even though the overlong ""frustated Michael roams around his office floor"" segments aren't really presented in a way that's truly remarkable.  However, many 80's films are guilty of the same mumbo jumbo- too much pointless nonsense and never getting to the point.

The first half of Bright Lights, Big City is really uninteresting though.  Not much happens then- it's all about the second half or rather, as soon as the animal segment I mention above occurs.  Starting then the movie improves.  Thank goodness Michael J. Fox is the guy playing the role of a stressed out magazine writer.  His talented and believable facial expressions concerning all these emotions is enough to elevate this movie by 2 extra points (I would have given it a 1, *maybe* a 2 with some other guy starring in it).

Overall Bright Lights, Big City falls short of being able to stand out in any truly memorable way due to some flaws, but a couple segments make it worth your time.",1386547200,,4007,4.695278969957082

827001,4,6304286481,"I came into this film knowing very little. I had read something online about the cocaine use, someone comparing it with Scarface in some capacity. So I did the math: Michael J. Fox using cocaine in the 1980s=yeah, I'll give it a view.

The movie opens strong with some scenes of nightclub indulgence and a good shot of Michael staring at himself in the mirror, lights glaring; and we can tell there's some thought behind the camera.

Fox tries to work at a magazine but is conflicted between it and the lights of the city. It doesn't help that he has a very earthly Keifer Sutherland goading him on, seducing easily like Satan, seeming to epitomize the city life. It's easy to imagine how many people in the 1980s could easily be strung along by such dopes. Destruction can be a collective effort. The clubbing goes on.

More is revealed in time about the Fox character, and it emerges that this film is not only about partying. His co-workers at the magazine look at him funny. He stands out.
Megan, his friend at the magazine, is inexplicably motherly to him. She's a good friend, but one wonders why she would care about the coke addled Fox of the night. She must see something more in him.

Fox tries to write a novel, but it's tough. His wife has left him, an innocent who was swallowed by the city. There's an effective scene where he finds her, strutting on the catwalk, cameras going wild. She ignores him.
All in all, this is an enjoyable view of a human in an inhuman place. Certainly the best Fox performance I've yet seen.

Ronald Reagan, a liberal before selling out, most likely would not have understood the nuances of this movie's message about lifeless capitalism. He'd probably pay more attention to the dance scenes.",1297641600,2,1735,4.583870967741936
827002,5,6304286481,"I remember reading the novel this film was based on back in the Eighties and it left me a little cold.  I got more enjoyment at the Cliff Notes parody released by the late lamented ""Spy Magazine"" that not only took on Jay McInnerney's book but also Bret Eason Ellis' ""Less Than Zero"" and Tama Janowitz's ""Slaves of New York"".  The book didn't inspire me to go out to see the movie at the time and it only roused by curiousity after stumbling across it in the bargain bin at the supermarket.  I'm happy to say that the movie is better than the book, or quite possibly, the book was better than I remembered it.  Abetted by brilliant direction by James Bridges, McInnerney's script masterfully fleshes out the novel to the screen.  All would be for naught if we didn't empathize with the central character, Jamie Conway, frustrated magazine editor and fledgling writer portrayed here by Michael J. Fox.  Fox with few histrionics captures the melancholy and desperation of a young man whose life is falling apart and also has to cope with the recent death of his mother and the breakup of his brief marriage.  The supporting cast here is impeccable that it's difficult to single anybody out.  Probably the two performances that stand out most are Jason Robards as a besotted writer who attempts to befriend Jamie and Swoosie Kurtz as a sympathetic co-worker of Jamie's.  ""Bright Lights, Big City"" should be sought out not as an Eighties relic but as a lasting piece of art.",1279152000,3,1470,4.666666666666667
827003,3,6304286481,"All the negative reviews here lead me to believe that people just don't get this film.  It's not great by any stretch of the word, but it is good for what it is.
It paints a grim (but realistic) view of what life could be like in Manhattan if you were depressed, disillusioned, and had a cocaine habit.

The fact that this is probably the only film in existence with this much footage shot at the Palladium, NYC (which no longer exists), is worth the price of admission.

I also find it strange that nobody is commenting on the MUSIC!!  The soundtrack is excellent, and propels the film very effictively.
How can you go wrong with Prince, Donald Fagen, New Order, & Bryan Ferry?

Good movie.",1262822400,5,691,4.4523809523809526
827004,3,6304286481,"Despite being almost 30 years old, this 80s relic still looks relatively undated, a tribute to the designer of the film. Michael J. Fox, however, is a poor lead, looking impossibly fresh and cherubic no matter how many lines of coke he does or drinks he consumes. He is way too innocent-looking for the role, which would have been better with the lizardy Kiefer Sutherland in the lead and someone else as Ted Allagash, the debauched pal. Whatever happened to Phoebe Cates? She doesn't look good here, with a bad pixie haircut. The book, as usual, is way better.",1243555200,,561,4.6767676767676765
827005,3,6304286481,"This is an interesting movie in that it shows us how weak we can be about the plainest points when we are emotionally involved.

The story is basically this. Jamie Conway (Michael J. Fox) is struggling to keep an editing job he doesn't especially like. Though he does need it. His boss Claire is less than kind, though not quite a monster. She is often nasty, though she does seem to give him the benefit of the doubt sometimes, and she does tolerate his lateness to work that seems to have increased.

Later, we learn that Michael J. Fox is broken emotionally because his wife Amanda left him. Though we can readily see that she was just using him because she thought Fox would make it big as a writer, and as it turned out, she made it big as a model and decided she had no more use for Fox. This is where things get interesting. Because Fox is emotionally involved, he can't see that his wife was just an opportunist who was after anyone who could either support her, or move her into opportunities. So, he dwells and dwells on her to the point where he can not go on with his life.

This brings us to Ted Alagash. (Kiefer Sutherland) The movie seems to lead us into more sympathy with Fox. And at times, Sutherland does seem insensitive, and yes he does have a harsh sense of humor about Fox's sadness. But if we allow ourselves to be objective, we can see that Sutherland is tired of hearing about Fox's wife, and Sutherland is basically trying to tell Fox: ""Enough! Go on with your life already!""
An obvious example is when Sutherland asks Fox to go out with his attractive cousin. Sutherland outlines the situation nicely when he makes this comment about Amanda: ""God knows she wasn't hard to look at. I don't know why you felt you had to marry her though.""

Throughout the movie, Fox, Sutherland, and their friends are portrayed as drug users. But a fine point worth considering is that Sutherland controls his drug intake. With Fox, it is clear that the drugs are controlling him. (It is also worth noting that Fox was into drugs before his wife left him.)

Things go from bad to worse as Fox loses his job. But he is still obsessed with his wife. I don't want to ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it, but there is an interesting outcome.

I'll just say that sometimes triumph comes from stepping outside of ourselves and realizing that there is more to life than our own existence.

One complaint I have about the movie is that at one point near the end, Fox compares Sutherland to Amanda which makes no sense. Amanda left Fox because there were offers that she considered better for her. Throughout the movie, Sutherland has been trying to convince Fox to go on with his life. Yes, his humor is harsh at times. But often, that is a way people use to tell others how absurd they are being in their self pity.

While not perfect, it is certainly interesting.",1235606400,2,2882,4.434782608695652
827130,4,6304286481,This is a pretty good film depicting the darker side of the 1980s. The story behind the lead character in the film (portrayed by Michael J. Fox) is one that takes a turn for the worse but leaves the viewer with a glimmer of hope. This film encapsulates the indifference of the fast-paced professional world as it collides with the toxic indulgences of the 1980s.,1225152000,,362,4.584615384615384
827131,5,6304286481,"I just finished watching 'Bright Lights, Big City' probably for the 5th or 6th time over the weekend. I actually have this movie on VHS cassette that I taped on HBO YEARS ago. Anyway, this movie still holds up after many viewings. I was a big Manhattan clubgoer from the late-80s to the mid-90s and this movie really captures that world pretty well. LOVE the beginning scenes at the now-gone-forever Palladium on East 14th Street (it was torn down to build dormitories for NYU). The movie superbly tells the story of a naive small-town young man (Jamie Conway, played brilliantly by Michael J. Fox) with dreams of being a modern-day 'F. Scott Fitz-Hemingway' (a phrase actually used in the movie) whose life is turned upside-down by the unexpected departure of his newlywed wife. She pursues her dreams to be a model at the expense of Jamie's heart. He drowns his sorrows in cocaine within the very-alluring Manhattan club life of the day (trust me - the Manhattan nightlife ain't what it used to be - the Golden Age is over). He is also dealing with the recent death of his mother to cancer and a very unfulfilling job. I love this movie because Jamie Conway could have been anyone - someone with big dreams who moves away from home to seek a better life and unwittingly has his dreams destroyed by users and backstabbers. Oh yeah, and the music is great too (Prince, Donald Fagen, Bryan Ferry, Narada Michael Walden). I highly, HIGHLY recommend this great 80s movie. (Word of warning, especially for NYC lovers....the long, endearing shot of the Twin Towers at the movie's end may bring a tear or two to your eyes....it did to mine.)",1209945600,8,1635,4.680555555555555
827132,4,6304286481,"It has very little of the brilliance of the book, but Bright Lights, Big City provides a somewhat entertaining look at the decadent 80s. Most of the merit resides on Michael J. Fox, who manages, against great odds, to make Jamie a relatable character on the verge of self-destruction. Kiefer Sutherland is also great as his sleazy enabler and sidekick. Phoebe Cates, on the other hand, is the movie's worst mistake. She's pretty enough, but not for one second I bought that she was a runway model (how tall is she? Five five?) or, for that matter, that she'd inspire such passion from Fox.",1200614400,,589,4.673076923076923
827133,2,6304286481,"Michael J Fox stared in a few movies in the 80s about being a yuppie in New York.  While in The Secret of My Success he was a lovable yuppie scum from Kansas, here he is a not so lovable yuppie scum from Kansas who is absorbed in the heady nightlife of cocaine and all that was New York in the 80s.  He is in despair, as his job is going downhill, his wife has left him, there are no friends to be found, and it's all falling apart.

It's hard for me to feel sympathy for someone like this.  He made choices to live this way.  His use of drugs was not the result of abuse, desperation or being forced into doing something he didn't want to do, it was the result of his own choices.  His wife left him because she doesn't want to watch him go down.  His friends are not really his friends, and he is loosing footing with his job.  ""What? Me? Get up and go to work? I don't like the way you said that, I'm not going.""  And the coke straw says ""You know you're right.""  Michael J Fox seems to be someone who has had a lot of advantages in life and he is throwing them away for the next high.  I've watched many friends ruin their lives with this, and none of them are my friends anymore because of their choices.  I choose to live in happiness, to be in the light, and to be responsible enough to support myself.  Guess what?  That's cool and they're not.

Why not one star?  In terms of a cinematic achievement, they were able to capture the paranoia and upset that is cocain addiction so the audience is able to experience it for themselves.  A few movies have been able to achieve this, such as Good Fellas and Boogie Nights, and this movie for that alone has fallen into the slush pile.  Michael J Fox had his own addictions he was able to overcome, I wonder what happened to a lot of those people this movie was about from the 80s.",1139011200,,1833,4.101123595505618
827134,4,6304286481,"Some people may think it's difficult to watch a movie where the lead spends almost the entire film being a jerk and snorting his paycheck - but stick with this one and you witness Michael J. Fox reaching his (sort of) salvation. The score is outstanding 80's, especially the Donald Fagen version of the title song and the closing number.

Watch for a great cameo by Jason Robards and the painful reward given to Keefer Sutherland.",1126224000,3,430,4.657894736842105
827135,4,6304286481,"James Bridges (Urban Cowboy) directs Michael J. Fox (Back To The Future), Phoebe Cates (Fast Times At Ridgemont High), and Keifer Sutherland (The Lost Boys, Stand By Me) in this overlooked 80's movie about a man's struggle with a dark past and the overwhelmingly hysterical cocaine-driven nightlife of New York City.

Fox plays Jamie Conway, a struggling writer and editor in a small time magazine, who has just been dumped by his big shot model wife Amanda and is still mourning the death of his mother from cancer a year ago. He's also concerned with a newspaper article following the tragic events of a pregnant woman in coma simply because it reminds him of the last conversation between him and his dying mother about how painful it was for her to give birth to him because he ""didn't want to get out"".

The events of the movie pursue Jamie on his manic pursuit of Amanda and the fact that he feels used and terribly upset with the way she left him, and his dreadful shortcomings at work that cost him his job. The main focus of the movie however is how addicted Jamie gets to cocaine and the negative results it has on his health. Keifer Sutherland plays Aligash, a suave businessman who joins Jamie in the crazy nightlife scene and ends up hooking him up with a woman that seems to be what Jamie was looking for for a long time.

Although the movie might seem plotless, it captures a certain vibe that you can't seem to pull away from. It's also very interesting to see Fox play a character that totally defines the complete opposite of what Marty McFly is.

Bright Lights, Big City features cameo appearances by high profile actors like John Houseman, Sam Robards, and Dianne Wiest.

827137,5,6304286481,"Having lived through the cocaine 80's, I can assure you this flick hits the nail on the head. Forget about getting up and going to work tomorrow, where's the party? Humorous, compelling, and sad, with a marvelously redemptive ending. I'm not a big fan of Michael J. Fox, but I have to say this is the biggest role, in a small film, of his entire career. Forget TEENWOLF, this is great acting. Especially compelling is his soliloquy as he reassesses his marriage while he's swinging around a wine glass and bouncing off the walls of his living room. Great stuff. The funniest scene is when Sutherland is looking for coke in the dust of Fox's apartment and takes a freeze to the gums. Wow. Been there, done that.

If you think the book was better than the movie, think again. The screenplay was written by the author, Jay McInerney. So it actually resembles the novel. Nice job.

And those of you who think this is a stretch for Fox, think again. Michael had his own coke problem which is what drew him to this role in the first place. Great job, Michael. I think this the most mature performance of your career. Best of luck to you, brother. Sutherland is great too.

And yes, I'm in total agreement with previous reviewers, this begs to be rereleased in widescreen.

Don't be fooled by the lackluster reviews for this flick, it's one of the best films ever made about being lost in addiction. Hope this brings up the reviews a little. IT'S A WONDERFUL FILM.",1093996800,36,1457,4.52851711026616
827138,1,6304286481,"I am shocked that MGM released this DVD with NO WIDESCREEN OPTION.  I did not realize this was the case until the DVD arrived here at my apartment and I noticed on the back of the box it said, ""Modified to fit your screen.""  ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?!  I didn't just do a double take, i did like a 15 take; 'total disbelief' is the only way to describe my reaction.

Bright Lights Big City is a CLASSIC era film that helped define the '80s, one of the most culturally important decades in U.S. history.  This film deserves a special release DVD, not some two-bit 'modified to fit your television' joke of a release.

This 'modified to fit your television' release is a slap in the face to all fans of Bright Lights Big City, the '80s, Michael J. Fox, Kiefer Sutherland, and any of the cast and crew of this film.  Do not buy this dvd, for protest alone if for no other reason.  If you really need to see it then go rent it instead.

Now I can't decide whether or not to return this joke of a 'DVD' and order the UK release which actually has a Widescreen option.  I guess MGM just likes to spit in the face of North America.

I went to the store looking at the great DVD deals and MGM had this great deal going buy one of their flicks get another one free, so I picked this and The Fog Special Edition as my choices (I got two others, but that's not important). What first attracted me was the fact that Michael J. Fox, Kiefer Sutherland and Phoebe Cates were all in the same movie. That is quite a package in and of itself. I am a big big fan of Fox, and a new fan of Kiefer Sutherland after ""Phone Booth"" and ""24"". Phoebe Cates, well you can understand why if you saw Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
Anyway, the whole reason why I gave the movie only four stars is because I don't like seeing drug content in movies, and the drug content was a major role in the movie, and seeing Marty McFly doing cocaine is not something I'm used to seeing in a movie. But other than that small, yet big in my eyes, complaint here is my overall opinion of the movie:
All three actors do a great job (not as good a job for Phoebe because she wasn't in the movie as much as I hoped, and her character was heartless) This movie is worth the ten dollars that I paid and is worth however much [the website] or anyone else sells it.

827324,5,6304286481,"To me, ""Bright Lights, Big City"" is a brilliant, well-made film because it talks about Michael's character being dumped by his wife (Phoebe Cates) and how he falls in love with the seductive nightlife that the Big Apple has to offer and going on an alcohol/cocaine binge. It tells the story of one man's journey to discover himself and confront his inner demons before they literally destroy him forever. I don't know if anybody knows this, but ""Bright Lights, Big City"" is also where Michael J. Fox met his future wife, Tracy Pollan, who also stars in the film. I was at a store one day, and I saw ""Bright Lights..."" on sale, and it was just too sweet of an opportunity to pass up, so I bought it, and every time I look at the movie, it keeps getting better and better. The soundtrack was exceptional, and kudos to Donald Fagen for the song at the end of the film, ""Century's End"", also when he sang ""Bright Lights, Big City"" too. But anyway, all I have to say is that ""Bright Lights, Big City"" has an excellent supporting cast, including Kiefer Sutherland and Dianne Wiest. Michael J. Fox has never been better in ""Bright Lights, Big City""!!",982195200,17,1143,4.5
827325,3,6304286481,"Over the space of three years, the reviled triumvirate of hot young (no longer young, these days) '80s New York novelists - Tama Janowitz (""Slaves of New York""), Bret Easton Ellis (""Less Than  Zero""), and Jay McInerney (""Bright Lights, Big City"") -  watched Hollywood turn their books into tepid movies. This adaptation is  probably the best of the three, due to a strong lead performance by Michael  J. Fox as protagonist Jamie Conway and a lively supporting cast. The movie  has an exciting title sequence, featuring a great-looking female bartender  with a shaved head, but swiftly loses energy from there. The book was a  vague celebration of the nouveau sex-and-drugs scene, with an undercurrent  of yearning for simplicity and wholesomeness; the movie, made smack dab in  the middle of the Just Say No era, fails to establish what would lure  people like Jamie, who now seems to get high solely to blot out the pain of  his mother's death and being dumped by Phoebe Cates. (At times the movie is  like an '80s remix of ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar."")
The  coke-snorting, promiscuous Jamie was a stretch for the amiable Fox  (remember, at that point he was best known as Alex P. Keaton and Marty  McFly; the following year he would make ""Casualties of War"" and  discover that moviegoers preferred him in comedy). He gives the film  whatever core of feeling it has. But the coldness of the images (Gordon  Willis shot this as if he were still working on ""The Godfather"")  numbs us to his plight. We don't know whether to take Jamie's flailings as  desperate comedy or as drama, and McInerney's own script is no help. The  novel, written in ironic second-person present tense, like a ""Choose  Your Own Adventure"" book for jaded teens (it begins, ""You are not  the kind of person who would be at a place like this at this time of the  morning""), didn't exactly cry out for film adaptation in the first  place. The movie is inoffensive but pointless. Two stars, upgraded to three  for Fox and the cool '80s soundtrack featuring Donald Fagen, Bryan Ferry,  Prince, New Order, Depeche Mode, and others.
BOTTOM LINE: For $10, Fox  fans can't go too far wrong.",964656000,7,2153,4.745945945945946
827326,2,6304286481,"The first time I saw ""Bright Lights, Big City"" was when I was pretty young and knew nothing about drugs. I also only saw Michael J. Fox in comedies like ""Back to the Future"" and I was absolutely  shocked to see him in this type of role. My innocent childhood hero looked  like a horrible person in this movie--because he portrayed a horrible  person. After watching this film, I vowed to never touch a drug in my life  and I keep that vow. Jamie Conway (Fox's character) is a cocaine snorting,  selfish, scary individual with serious problems who finally hits rock  bottom. It took me years before I was able to accept Fox in other roles  after being literally taken in by his performance. As far as entertainment  value, this film keeps you interested but it isn't for casually viewing  because you'll be feeling the power of it long after you watch and that  state of mind stays with you. Did I love the movie? No. Did it do a good  job scaring me off the night scene and from experimenting with drugs. Yes.  Show it in any health class.",961459200,4,1039,4.410526315789474

7866703,4,6304286481,"When seeing it in the theater I imagined it would be another farce with a heart. Fox's previous fare was fun but nothing that I took very seriously. This was the game changer. Not only was Fox perfect for the role, in some ways because of my expectations being derailed, but also because he needed this film to show he wasn't just another precocious, forever young actor with broad appeal. The supporting cast were perfect. Diane Wiest's small screen time was, at first, disappointing. For the short time she's there, she delivers, and I ache for her character. Keifer Southerland as Fox's character's best pal is a schmuck, a real cad, but he has his role as the appealing, ever so cool friend, down pat. It's hard to hate him but it's equally difficult to embrace him. He's a user and as such Jaime (Fox) sums him up very well near the end as Jaime's leaving the party, both physically and philosophically. I watch this film every few years and it gets better with each viewing. Some films are better that way.",1435622400,,1012,4.565934065934066
