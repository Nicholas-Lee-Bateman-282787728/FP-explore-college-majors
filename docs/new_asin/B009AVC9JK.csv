5309655,5,B009AVC9JK,"I've been waiting for this DVD to come out in english.  The package came super quick, even before the first season which I also got :).  As soon as I got it I put it in to watch.  I was very pleased to find I could watch it in the japanese version with english subtitle also.  The english voices are kind of off to me, but I got used to it.",1366243200,,340,3.7464788732394365
5309656,1,B009AVC9JK,"Worst show ever!!!!!!!!!!:( When i bought the first season i thought it was gonna pick up,boy was i wrong. It felt like i was getting a history lesson,its like they had no character background whatsoever and all they did was fight nonstop. But the worst thing about it was the ending, I've seen a lot of bad endings,but this one takes the cake. I seriously DO NOT RECOMEND this anime to anyone unless you want to listen to a history lesson, and like bad endings.",1360713600,,462,4.447058823529412
5309657,5,B009AVC9JK,I watch this on Crunchyroll and just fell in love with the story line and the beautiful drawing . I love anything about Japan!1,1358208000,,127,4.333333333333333
5309658,5,B009AVC9JK,"The second season of Hakuoki is better than the first! In the begining I wasn't in favor of the english dubbed voices but after watching the first season in english I got used to the voices and really enjoyed the dub in the the second season.  I think it's done well.  The music is also great in this series.  The battles are epic! The story does get really tragic though, well it's a war story afterall.  I highly recommend this series to anyone! I can't wait for the third season to come out, so looking forward to it!",1357948800,,520,4.275510204081633
5309659,5,B009AVC9JK,"Hakuoki is a historically based series.  The Shinsengumi are the main characters, including Saito Hajime of Rurouni Kenshin fame.  I like this series a lot and wish that it had had much more support.  The graphics are typical of samurai anime, but the historical info and geography is accurate.  The stories are supported by historic fact and as an American who cannot read Japanese, this is as close to history and entertainment as we are going to get.  Try it, despite some fluff, you will like the story and the characters.",1356998400,6,526,4.736263736263736
5309679,4,B009AVC9JK,It's a very good price and it was nice quality. My sister loved it as her gift so I am very happy with the purchase.,1408233600,,116,3.68
5309680,5,B009AVC9JK,"Ok, Naruto was my first anime, thanks kids! No, I meant the first anime I found and watched for myself.

As mentioned before, this season is intense, so be forewarned. But I enjoyed learning about the historical aspects of this story, and it was a jump-off for me to do my own research.

I love this series, and have watched it several times and finally figured it was time to own it and stop relying on youtube, or other anime sites. For me, that's saying something because I am pretty picky with what I watch, and it's rare for a series to keep me engaged and coming back to complete/watch update.,  When I do complete a series, I usually can only watch it once, and I'm done.

I'm saying all this to say that this is an awesome anime. Just a recommendation if all of the drama and death gets you down, this is what I did, after watching all three seasons, I watched the OVA, and since it's got a lighter tone, it made me feel soo much better! If you like a good samurai story, I highly recommend this one.

I hate to be the one to mention the elephant in the room, but the male characters are interesting and really easy on the eyes!",1396396800,3,1136,4.216589861751152
5309681,4,B009AVC9JK,"I honestly loved Hakuoki. The characters are people you can easily grow attached to and there's a balance between peaceful scenes and fighting. The ending is pretty intense, so a warning is issued to that, but if you enjoy history, Hakuoki is an anime you'll be able to grow close to.",1384473600,,284,4.588235294117647
5309682,3,B009AVC9JK,"I think the creators of this anime really dropped the ball with this sequel. The whole Devil thing really fell away. The Devils completely changed their focus from Chizuru to fighting with various factions, and it wasn't really explained.  I wanted the Devils to be a richer part of the story, to be better explained, and they weren't. And I never understood why, if Chizuru was a Devil and largely impermeable to injury, she didn't jump in and defend herself and those she loved. She could have been so much more. That said, I still love the Shinsengumi, and this series has definitely sparked an interest in Japanese history for me.",1383436800,,634,4.711711711711712
5309683,4,B009AVC9JK,"The story is another romanced  loosely based story on the Shinsengumi in Japanese history but with a different twist from other stories I've seen.  I didn't like the twist. But the story line was good. (I'm not going to say what it was. So, interested persons would need to purchase the DVD.)",1381276800,,292,4.596153846153846

5309686,5,B009AVC9JK,"I am a huge fan of well written anime's with both story and some true based history. This series had great graphics, well thought out story lines, and even some historical plots.

I strongly recommend this to anime fans.",1373932800,2,220,4.641025641025641
5309687,5,B009AVC9JK,"Ok, first off, I love the Japanese voice acting better than the English voice acting. I don't feel all the English voices fit all the characters. This season is very dramatic and sad and there are a lot of battles. Honestly there is nothing wrong with it containing a lot of history in the anime. You can take advantage of actually learning something while you enjoy a good anime. Everyone has their preferences but I think a lot of people that watch these kinds of anime and don't like them, way over exaggerate to try to get people to not buy them. So if you read a review that just totally rips the anime apart and tells you not to buy, makes sure to read reviews from others too and you can also go on sites like youtube and view scenes and samples from the anime. Don't just base your decisions or opinions on what one or two people who are clearly over-dramatizing the few issues with the anime and really try to do more research and form an opinion of your own that way.
One thing to remember about Hakuoki is that it is an anime based on a Japanese romance game based towards a female audience. So naturally there is going to be drama because it's hard to have a decent romance story with out drama, plus the era in which the anime takes place and the events that were occurring in Japan during that time should be taken into consideration as a good reason for the drama. Basically my view is war isn't pretty and this anime doesn't really try to sugar coat that, some people can respect that and others can't. There was a lot of death in this season, but the series was made to mostly follow Chizuru's relationship with one specific character which it tried to concentrate on more towards the end so they really wouldn't concentrate much on the other characters. The deaths and separations were pretty sad to me but I like shows and anime that can evoke those emotions. In the end I love this anime but my suggestion is do your own research don't just take other peoples' word for it. You could decide based on opinion that you want to try it but end up not liking it, but you could also decide to take an opinion that you won't like it with out trying it and end up missing out on a potentially great anime.

Hopefully this review is somewhat helpful :)",1367539200,14,2263,4.337264150943396
5309688,3,B009AVC9JK,I enjoyed the 1st season a lot.  This season was a bit to drama oriented. There were some really great action fights but that's about it.,1367107200,,137,4.269230769230769
8538718,5,B009AVC9JK,"I love this anime. It is definitely one of my favorites. I purchased all three seasons. And I am glad I did, however I think season three should acutually be season one since it's more of a prequel to seasons one and two. The story tells you how the shensingumi came about and at the end of season three, introuduces chizuru and shows her leaving home. So, season three ties the stories together. Purchase all three. You can't go wrong.",1486339200,,436,4.4625
