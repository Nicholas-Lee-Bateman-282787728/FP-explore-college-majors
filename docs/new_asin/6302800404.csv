513999,5,6302800404,"I watched the DVD last night and found this to be a very compelling film, showing the difficulties of gay romance between an Israeli Jew and a Palestinian in Tel Aviv with dramatic flair.  The two actors in the leads are wonderful.  This is a low-budget, shot on location film that is loaded with atmosphere.  There are moments of comedy as well, but the tone is generally serious and, in the last 15-20 minutes becomes an intense thriller, with an ending set-up for a sequel, which I hope these filmmakers will make.",1383955200,65,517,4.5978260869565215

514001,4,6302800404,"OUT OF THE DARK is what I call a ""subcult"" film. It's never going to achieve true cult status, but it's so enjoyable it manages to exert a kind of gravity on those few of us who've actually seen it. Even as B-movies go it's startlingly bad and silly, yet it has so many memorable moments...I mean, nobody who hears the line, ""I'm Bobo the #$@! clown!"" is likely to forget it.

OUT OF THE DARK is about a group of telephone sex girls, bossed by Ruth Wilson (Karen Black!) who operate out of a low-rent building in downtown Los Angeles. They are supposed to be anonymous to their clients, yet one of them - a weirdo who speaks in a creepy monotone and calls himself Bobo the Clown - seems to know who they are. And in fact Bobo is stalking them with very malicious intent. When the first girl is murdered, the cops investigating the case zero in on Kevin Silvers (Cameron Dye) the boyfriend-photographer of Kristi Larson (Lynn Danielson), who has just joined the phone-sex gang, and most of the movie revolves around the attempts our heroes to prove the guilty party is really either Dennis (the ubiquitous Geoffrey Lewis), a bitter old rival of Kevin's, or Doug Stringer (Bud Cort) a creepy accountant who shares building space with the phone sex posse. Meanwhile, the killings continue, growing more daring and gruesome, and may be linked to another series of murders being investigated by Detective Langella (Divine). The question is, will any of the suspects, or the girls, be left alive by the time Bobo is unmasked?

OUT OF THE DARK is really awful in many ways, and it is always absurd, squalid and ridiculous. The writing, which is unbelievably dirty, ranges from clever and witty to appallingly bad, and the same can be said for some of the acting. The guy they got to play the lead detective, is miscast; Tracey Walter ain't a bad actor, but looks more like he manages a sleazy pay-by-the-hour motel than a police officer. Divine's appearance in the movie is completely pointless, and the movie generally achieves the exact opposite of what it is trying to do - it's funny when it means to be scary, lifeless when it's trying to be funny, and stupid when it's trying to be clever. Anyone catching you watching OUT OF THE DARK will probably subject you to hideous ridicule, and you probably deserve every word of it.

On the other hand, there is much to recommend here. The film is shot and edited to the standards of an A-movie, and the women are hot and their characters surprisingly well-developed and likeable.  Bobo is meant to be a ridiculous yet creepy assailant, and he is; the sequence in which he strangles a phone sex girl who is being videotaped by the police is truly disturbing. Some people complain about the gratuitous sex scene between Dye and Danielson, but that's absurd, because Danielson has a killer body. But really, this entire film can be enjoyed mainly for Bobo: his ridiculous victory dance after he kills someone, his flat-as-an-iron delivery, and his huge, grinning clown face steal every scene in which he appears. He's a kind of poor man's Freddy/Chucky - a quip-killer at least as interested in his double entendres as his murders. Almost by accident, the producers of this ridiculous, low-budget, never-shown-on-cable-except-at-3AM-movie have created something interesting, a gleefully cheesy B-minus flick which stands as a kind of testament to Los Angeles of the late 1980s and even the L.A. noire subgenre. It's genuinely a terrible film, but it's BOLDLY terrible; it kicks down your door and smashes you in the face with a cream pie, then hoses you down with seltzer and yells, ""I'm Bobo the f-ing clown!"" And you know what? You kind of enjoy the process. Evidently it's Bobo's world and we're all just livin' in it.

To sum up: if you've a taste for trash, give OUT OF THE DARK a try; you won't be disappointed. That is to say, you will be disappointed, but you'll enjoy the hell out of every minute of it.",1372723200,5,3951,4.687319884726225

514005,4,6302800404,"I ran across this on Fearnet on Demand ,I read the cast and synopsis and Had to watch it. The cast consisted of.
Karen Black,Cameron Dye""the hunk from so many 80's teen movies"" Divine ""Playing a male character not his usual over the top larger than life drag Persona"",Tab Hunter,Lanie Kazan and Geoffery Lewis ,Bud Cort and Paul Bartel. All the actors that would fit well into a Campy Slasher flick.

BoBo the clown is killing Phone Sex Girls .That's pretty much the synopsis. But in this long forgotten gem are some really hilarious dialogue,situations and a couple of good kills.
at the end of the day it's light on gore,that's ok it has all the other elements needed for this Genre recipe.

514007,3,6302800404,"This film starts off about a few girls who work in a phone sex job together, and they have recieved some phone calls from a weirdo who ends up stalking some if them.

It turns out that the man stalking them is a phycho in a clown mask who calls himself Bo-Bo. One of the girls end up dead and a few suspects are presented as a guess for the audience of who done it?

It started off well, it was intereting, nothing to keep you on the edge of your seat, but it was doing ok untill the end of it. It really needed to be re-written and thought out, because during the film it's all kind of serios and you keep guessing as to who the killer under the mask is, and it just ends up all wrong and acted badly and ended badly in the end of it. It kind of builds up to a climax that just does not deliver in the end.

The movie stars a couple of people I didn't recignise, the ones I did where Karen black who plays the head owner of the phone sex company. Tracey Walter (Bob from ""Batman"" 1989) who plays the rough cop whose phycho enough himself to be the killer. Geoffrey Lewis (Tango & Cash) plays a drunken bum photographer angry at the leading role kid of the film, but I'd say he's just there to make you wonder if his modives are enough to make him murder?

Rent it if it intrests you, but you won't be kicking yourself if you never see it.",1118188800,6,1339,3.985074626865672

So someone is upset about the results or jealously sets in who knows, I do but that's for me to know and you find out. This is not a crude sex show but a story well written and a cast that do the job by making this movie interesting and watchable. I rated this for marvellous performances and the full on suspense making you think who's guilty.

514197,5,6302800404,"A popular LA phone-sex hotline service, Suite Nothings, typically gets great business and has some of the best and attractive women in Los Angeles working the line. The business consists of Jo Ann, Barbara, Vanessa, Kristi, and the manager, Ruth. The young group of women get along well with each other, love their job, and even earn a new co-worker, Camille. The party and fun times for these ladies is soon shut down, however. Later that night while on the way home, Jo Ann is beaten to death in the park with a baseball bat by a man with a clown mask who calls himself Bobo.

Assigned to investigate the murder are police detectives McDonald and Lt. Meyers. However, in the middle of investigation, the psychotic and savage Bobo the Clown begins targeting more of the hotline females. usually starting with a creepy and threatening phone call, followed by him killing them. Multiple people--mainly clients, are considered to be suspects.

There's Kevin Silvers, Suite Nothings' top client who was chosen by a women's model magazine to do a layout on the phone girls. There's Dennis, a former client of Suite Nothings who is a bitter alcoholic, furious that Kevin took his spot and got chosen to do the layout photo-shoot over him. There's also Doug Stringer, the awkward accountant who lives on the same floor, just doors down from the phone sex office. So who is the killer clown terrorizing these women? You're kept on edge down to the final minutes of the film and just when you think you've got the answers to figure out who it is, the film brilliantly changes the questions

Overall: In my opinion Out of the Dark was a brilliantly put together 80s horror film. Back in the late 80s and early 90s, toll free numbers, especially the late night sex service phone chats were a major part of late night television. Even in today's times, there are still those late night phone sex commercials that play even in the wee hours of 2 in the morning. Surely when this movie first came out, any woman who worked for search a service likely had second thoughts about continuing through with those late night chats. As far as the movie is concerned, it does a great job at never dulling down. It keeps you watching beginning to end, wondering just who this killer clown is. I had seen this for the first time on FearNet a number of years ago and always wished to remember what the name of it was. Luckily I'm an avid fan of clown horror movies and found it. There is no official soundtrack for the film but there are some nice instrumental 80s beats played throughout. The acting is pretty good throughout as well",1433203200,,2609,4.618534482758621

Slowly, however, the film depicts a political situation that is heart-rendering in its injustice. A view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict emerges, by the hand of homosexuality, that is refreshing in its stark representation and by its varied elements. Throughout the film, one harbours the hope that the story will have a happy ending. But this is no Twilight fantasy. This is a real tale of senseless darkness, where the fragile power of romantic love is proven hollow against the background of a higher tragedy. The film picks up its pace, becoming a thriller near the end, with a finale that is, at best, one of ambiguity, according to the viewer's courage in assessing the facts.

I never doubted the authenticity of their emotions for a second.  I was completely unaware of  ""acting.""  It was hard to watch in parts because of the gut wrenching situation these men find themselves in.  Normally, watching scenes like the final 20 minutes of this film have a ""thriller"" feel, but  this film conveyed a sense  of personal desperation I do not remember seeing in any other film.  Such a complex mix  of love, longing, conflicting emotions and fear.

I've been impressed by several Israeli films and this has been the best.  I've been watching quite a few gay themed films lately and those that show gay men in a different reality are most interesting.  This was a very different reality, to say the least.  In our insular world, it's easy to forget how much persecution occurs around the world.  I will think about it for some time to come.

I highly recommend this film.  It shows  you don't need a big budget if you have a compelling story and strong performances.  With many indie films, I find myself cutting some slack in deference to the low budgets.  Not in this film.  I don't think they could have made this film any better.

New:  I'm editing this review to reflect a recent escalation of my outrage for homo-persecution.  I'm  saying  it about the religious right in the US and its certainly fitting for the middle east.  Where is the outrage? You barely see this discussed in the news considering the brutality occurring toward gays around the world.  Where are the religious leaders who should be condemning this brutality?  Shocking.",1423094400,2,1725,4.745762711864407

If you like the other 3 movies I referenced above, and enjoy good drama movies, then you will be glad that you purchased or rented this movie.

514336,5,6302800404,"Most gay themed films are low budget and rather stereotyped which reflects the number of potential viewers and the centre of film making i.e. New York , so it is no surprise that problems of middle class educated gay men feature prominently in such abundance. This film however follows close on the heels of such wonderful films like 'Yossi & Jager' and 'Yossi' to name just two recent gay films from Israel. There are a few other foreign language films which deserve a much wider audience but which barely make their money back.

The plot is outlined well in other reviews so I'm no going to repeat it. Some reviewers seem more concerned with maintaining a political stance than reviewing the film on its own merits. The plot is not in any way unbelievable as some maintain. They obviously know little of the Northern Ireland conflict where even greeting the wrong person could be construed as a betrayal of 'the cause'. The British army used every trick in the book as well to get information from those they could compromise which is all well documented. There is no reason the Israeli secret services wouldn't employ the same means. Armies are much the same all over the world. Gay men are particularly vulnerable to blackmail and police forces know this especially if they can use the threat of returning them to their particular 'cultural group' who will murder them for dishonouring them.

If the film highlights the plight of gay men and women in the Middle East it should be commended for that alone. The lighting is not deficient in any way and most of it is filmed in the daylight. I don't know where that idea came from. This is a worthy film for anyone's collection and certainly needs to be more widely distributed to highlight the plight of a much forgotten group of gays.",1413417600,,1787,4.66984126984127

514444,3,6302800404,"I enjoyed this movie more than I expected to but less than other reviewers. My biggest problem is the relationship between the two lead characters - I never believed in it. It was ACTED, not EXPERIENCED, by the two actors.

Their love scenes were so tightly choreographed to the cloyingly sweet soundtrack that they came off as cold and mechanical. It was like watching ballet dancers, not lovers. That may be either because the straight actors needed a rigid scenario to follow since there was no genuine sexual dynamic between them or because the director didn't know how else to stage those scenes. Either way, it's the director's fault.

They were more believable outside the bedroom. There the actors were somewhat freer to be themselves and allow the characters to interact as persons, not having to try to force themselves to act like lovers. The story is fairly interesting but also not quite believable.

My last comment regards other reviews, which make dumb comments like ""the Israel police are definitely as bad and vicious as the Terrorists they are trying to infiltrate"". That's simply not true.

The Palestinians (here as in real life) are thugs, not hesitating to torture and murder even their own people just to ""set an example"", with the same moral compass as an LA street gang. The Israeli police are FIGHTING TERRORISM - in the most effective way yet discovered.

Israel fights an unending battle for survival against a brutal enemy who surround them and outnumber them about 500 to 1. But despite their need for relentless vigilance, the Israeli police treat even their most dangerous suspects far more humanely than their Palestinian counterparts treat even their own people.

Anybody who believes that if the Palestinians were given their own sovereign country they then would leave Israel in peace is a fool. They (rather the far more powerful forces who use them as pawns) will not rest until Israel has been totally obliterated. It takes guts to resist such ruthlessness.",1393891200,2,1997,4.9640718562874255

514552,5,6302800404,"Social/political/romantic drama at its best.  ""Out in the Dark "" is laced with suspense, murder, and violence that will keep you on the edge of your seat holding your breath.  Immigration issues , cultural clashes, family dynamics, and homophobia make universal connections in this superb movie that could take place anywhere in the world .  International relations have never been worst.

The lead actors are beautiful and believable. This is a full service gay movie.",1385769600,25,469,5.213333333333333
514553,4,6302800404,"I really enjoy the true intensity of the film, I just wish their could be... a bit more skin and eroticism (for it is a gay film).  The film explores the harsh reality of what it means to be gay and the consequences many gay people face everyday of their lives.",1385510400,5,261,4.117647058823529
514554,5,6302800404,"This is a film about a relationship with its trust challenges but which endures them convincingly and sincerely.  This is a tale told with great emotive power whilst being understated in many ways. The two leads are simply gorgeous on screen and compellingly render their story from start to finish. This is not simply a good film about a gay relationship, this is just a good film about what any relationship is founded on, true love. Highly recommended.",1385078400,20,455,4.833333333333333
514555,5,6302800404,"I watched ""Out in the Dark"" ahead of realizing what it was dealing with to find myself drawn into a intense and disturbing viewing experience whose context reminded me of Eytan Fox's ""The Bubble"" and ""A Few Days of Respite,"" a Iranian film that left a stong impression at Boston's LGBT film festival. Out of this background came a foreboding that I could not expect the story's ill-fated couple to triumph over their separate and shared adversity. In spite of its being a real ""downer"", the movie was so well done-- truly compelling in its representation of a reality most of us can only imagine rather than deal actually have to deal with in our own lives--that I want to recommend it highly and hope it gets the attention and support it so richly deserves.

7831580,4,6302800404,"Ridiculously narrowed by recent peacemaking outsiders to territorial quarrels only, a Jewish-Muslim ongoing historic conflict is put in a spot from a perspective of same gender affairs between a West Bank student and his well-hilled Jewish-Israeli beau.

Both conflict sides are rich on prejudice, deceptive ""bad guys of  intelligence"", and cultural differences while lovers' chemistry climaxes in murky consequences.

To a very credit of producers, going further, than unfinished ""Prisoners of the War"", this
well-staged story is still in margins manifested with ""The Holy Land"", that's a decade-plus-old screen production.

Technically, subtitles shrift should be of a larger size.",1484611200,,683,5.8686868686868685
