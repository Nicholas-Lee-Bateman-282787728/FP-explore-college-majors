8592833,4,B00DFNETUG,"A smart talented young man from the Kenyan backcountry decides his future is in Nairobi.  He finds the best and worst of big city life there while getting involved in things he never imagined back home.  You get a real feel for the tough streets and average areas of Nairobi - no plush hotels or rich people are involved.  An excellent dramatic film as well as an introduction to some tough realities.  Be aware this is the European PAL format, and not playable on most US DVD players or computers.",1425168000,,498,4.5
