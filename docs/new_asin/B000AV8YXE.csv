2394696,4,B000AV8YXE,"I really like this DVD too, got a little frustrated the first time I tried it and the cueing is sorta lame.  But the moves during the cardio are easy once you do them a few times, especially if you are familiar with step techniques anyway.  The upper body portion is tough.  I use 10lb as my heaviest weights during the other dvds in this series but have to use 8lb in some instances due to the difficulty of the excercise.  Definitely like this as a good quickie workout if you dont' have much time!",1146700800,16,500,4.231578947368421
2394697,5,B000AV8YXE,"This workout is part of the Firm's 4th Body Sculpting System which introduces the Transfirmer, a 5 in 1 piece of equipment similar to the Fanny Lifter but longer in length.  It comes in 2 pieces, a 6 inch and 8 inch platform used individually for aerobics, stacked on top of one another for leg presses and tall box climbs, in an incline position for aerobics or strength work, and in a side by side position.  It is a very versatile piece of equipment and is very stable.

This workout is led by Stephanie Huckabee, who is joined by 4 fellow Firm Master Instructors including Alison who shows beginner modifications. The workout is just over 30 minutes and alternates upper body work with aerobic segments.

You begin with a simple warmup using the 6 inch portion of the Transfirmer, then you will move into upper body work working the chest and triceps.  Pushups are first, with varying counts and tempos, halftime and 2-2 count.  These are done on the Transfirmer but you have the option of just doing them on the floor if that is more comfortable.  Then you will lie on the Transfirmer set up in the incline position or on the floor and do bench presses, first with both arms, then alternating one at a time, I use lighter weights for this segment as the one arm at a time is more challenging.  Then you move in triceps bench presses followed by pec flies.  Lying tricep extensions complete this section, where the same weight is used throughout.

Next is a short hi-lo impact cardio section, Alison performs all low impact, jacks, shuffles, calf pumps and knee lifts are some of the moves you will see in this segment.

Tricep and shoulder work is next, you will start with tricep dips, then move into a tough shoulder segment starting with overhead presses with palms inward, then you will do overhead presses with rotation (twisting in at the top).  Then you will quickly grab lighter weights and do a segment of front and side deltoid raises with some variation.  My shoulders are always on fire after this segment, tough.

More cardio is next, this time a fun step segment using the Transfirmer in the incline position.  Hamstring curls, rock steps, sambas, knee lifts and repeaters are some of the moves that you will see.

Now it's time to work back and biceps.  You will start with double arm bent rows in a seated position, then you will move into hammer curls, some of them alternating arms.  Then you will stand up and do wide bent over rows with a slightly lighter weight, then move back to biceps with angled bicep curls.  All of these have varied counts and tempos.

More step aerobics are next, this is a fun segment that is peformed on the 8 inch section of the Transfirmer.  I myself use the 6 inch section as does Alison, it's just more comfortable for me.  Knee lifts, knee tapovers, turn steps, over the tops, and hamstring curls are included in this segment.  Lots of fun.

The final upper body segment follows, working the shoulders and biceps.  You will start with clean and presses, then move into bicep curls, then upright rows, all of these with some alternating of the arms.  You will finish out with a set of rear deltoid lifts with varied tempos.

More step aerobics on the 8 inch section of the Transfirmer follow.  You will see turn steps, over the tops, V steps, hamstring curls, A steps, jacks and other moves.  Cooldown and stretch immediately follows.

This is a great compact workout, hits all the upper body muscles plus includes a variety of cardio in just 30 minutes.  I often use this in combination with Jiggle Free Buns, which is a similar workout but for the lower body.  I find that I get a great workout with these 2 in an hour.  Stephanie is one of my favorite Firm instructors and she does not disappoint in this workout.  She has Jiggle Free Arms herself that I would like to have one day.  But you will also see Annie in the back who has great definition, definitely the buffest Firm instructor I have seen in a video.  I highly recommend this one.",1145318400,62,4001,4.546853146853147
2394698,2,B000AV8YXE,I was just using this tape and ended it half-way through to write a review.  The cueing stinks and is frustrating.  I am just getting back into exercising after a few months off and have been using Firm tapes on and off for about 15 years.  This one seems effective but annoying because there is no cueing.  Stephanie changes moves constantly and just says the name of the move while she is doing and it is SO FRUSTRATING.  You want a work out where you actually work - not waste your time trying to read the instructor's mind and falling all over the bench!,1142380800,30,558,4.326923076923077

If I am toning my ARMS, why would I need to purchase a special step system, unless I am perhaps walking on my hands? There should be no need for any special equipment beyond dumbells. The cardio is done at a pretty quick pace, and feels like I need to be an aerobics instructor to keep up. Very confusing for a novice to follow. Also, it's kind of distracting to see all the huge fake breasts on the instructors as they jump all around and their breasts never move. I found myself wondering if there were I-beams in their bras and thinking that just trying to pull a sweater on over those things would be a good arm workout.

2394712,4,B000AV8YXE,"Jiggle Free Arms is apart of the bonus/add on series for the Body Sculpting System 4 Series (BSS4); The Transfirmer. You will need to have the Transfirmer Box or a Step bench and slanted riser in order to do this workout. If you do not, some of the cardio will through you for a loop. This is a really good workout that gives you both cardio and weights, no abs, and stretch in approx 34 minutes. Unlike other Firm DVDs, in this workout you do not do the cardio and weights together, they each have their own segments. Biceps and Shoulders are worked hard and thoroughly in this DVD. The only chest work is a set of incline pushups done on the Transfirmer Box along with a short set of dumbbell presses. After doing the Firm for a while it is easy to see that certain DVDs work certain muscles groups more than others. I find this DVD very effective for the shoulders which many DVDs IMO don't do enough of. A DVD that would compliment this one would be The Firm's Total Body Toner as it hits the Back and Chest more so.

I am only giving this 4 stars bc like I mentioned above, the Chest is not worked hard enough. Even just an additional set of pushups would have been nice to really bring this muscle group to failure. Since this is an Upper Body & Cardio Only workout, I would have also liked to see more work for the Middle Back. However, this is solved by doing other Firm strength workouts during the week. Modifications are shown for step height as well as body positioning for various exercises. The only thing I would recommend is using a mat for the strength work and pushups done on the TransFirmer. I have Cathe's Step Bench Mat by Altus and it works perfectly for this. I wish there were more Upper-only DVDs on the market. But until more become available, this one will do nicely.",1271548800,5,1795,4.342261904761905

I am not the most coordinated, yet not a complete stiff, but I found this DVD hard to follow and it moved too quickly, w/out cueing or anyting, for me. I felt I got more cardio from trying to keep up with the moves, which is good, but not the area of my interest. Also, they use this 'transfermer' thing, that cost an extra 30-50 bucks, during the entire workout in various ways. It looks beneficial, but not willing to spend the extra money and I feel like I should have been told there was equipment required with it.

Hello.

I bought  this item because  I was looking for a workout that helps to stop jiggle arms.  the exercises  on the DVD those for arms are good, what I don't  like  is that in the DVD there are  serveral, a lot  of exercises using  an equipment called Transfirmer Board.

I prefer more  exercises target to the arms  and  not exercises  target ed  to the use of the board.

2394719,2,B000AV8YXE,"I absolutely love The Firm, own several of their dvds, workout with them pretty regularly, and have had a lot of success with them.  However, Jiggle Free Arms with Stephanie Huckabee is by far the most confusing Firm workout.  I'm not particularly uncoordinated, but I can not follow this workout.  While the other Firm instructors break down each set of moves, Stephanie just has you dive right into all sorts of different combinations with no explanations at all.  She'll be on to a different series of moves before you can even figure out the ones you're on.  I'm really surprised I haven't tripped over or twisted my ankle on the Transfirmer while trying to figure out her complex routine.

Furthermore, the amount of time she gives you to set up the Transfirmer into different configurations is not adequate, and this adds to the frustration.  I am always having to stop my workout to hit the pause button while I set it up.

I still recommend The Firm dvds and fitness gear (my personal favorites are Cardio Overdrive with Alison Davis and Hi Def Sculpt with Annie Lee), but I'd stay away from dvds by Stephanie Huckabee unless you super coordinated and an ultra fast learner!",1232150400,4,1182,4.7317073170731705
2394720,4,B000AV8YXE,"I like how the amount of weight training exercises are balanced with cardio.  This is not a weight training only DVD- its a circuit with short bursts of cardio.

I think the weight training hits every part of the upper body and when many of the exercises capitalize on the previous cardio session, one can keep their heart rate in the light to moderate area with little trouble.

I feel the cardio makes the weight training challenging so use of heavy weights is not necessary. In fact, many regular weight trainers will find it hard to use their 'normal' weight limits and might want to pyramid down to 3-5lbs less.

I like this instructor as I've seen her on the TransFIRMER series.  Good cueing overall.  TransFIRMER used in this DVD but any step (even w/o incline) can be used.",1223856000,2,781,4.58273381294964

I've used the Firm tapes and DVDs in the past and thought the new Jiggle Free series would be a good place to start.  I also loved that the tapes in this series are around 30 minutes each - perfect for me to do while my son has his afternoon nap.  The Jiggle Free Arms DVD is challenging, however there is absolutely no cueing during the aerobics sections.  I am familiar with what The Firm calls each move, but the instructor gives no cueing to let you know what to do next.  I've been using this DVD for a week now, and I still have difficulty with the aerobic sections because of the lack of cueing.

I work out almost every day and I alternate this video in with Zen Mama, Fit Mama, and various FitTV All Star Workouts.  I happen to be pregnant (7 months) right now and have to do the modification that Alison shows and I have to skip the chest workout that is done on your back.  But that does not take away from my ability to review and enjoy this video.

I do not have the Transfirmer.  Instead, I use the regular step with the riser that I already had and I use a regular bench for the parts that would require you to sit on the staked Transfirmer.  There is no need for the Transfirmer with these things.

As for the cueing that other reviewers have complained about, I do agree that you might be confused the first few times especially if you have never  taken STEP classes before.  But after several times, you will eventually get everything and you will really ENJOY how varied and and quick the cardio parts are.  It absolutely will prevent you from getting bored.  The 30 minutes goes by so quickly because of the fast and variable cardio parts.

About my arms, I think it will take a bit longer for me to get cut arms since I skip one 5 minute section of the video, but I definitely think it is working!  I HIGHLY recommend this video!",1185062400,6,1372,4.226923076923077

It is a great workout targeting shoulders, biceps, triceps and back muscles!  I really like the instructor's personality and the music isn't annoying.  There is some cardio incorporated so that you can burn some calories and let those new muscles show! :)

They use the TransFirmer in this workout, but I think you could do it without one.  You would just have to watch it to see how you would make up for not having one.  However, if you are looking for a workout tool I would highly recommend the TransFirmer.  Just the incline alone is worth the $$!

2394730,3,B000AV8YXE,"I agree with previous reviewers who said the cueing is inadequate.  Being almost entirely unfamiliar with step vocabulary, I found the patterns baffling.  I think the workout would have been better if the instructor allowed a few more repetitions of each move instead of changing every few seconds.  On the other hand, trying to learn the moves made the time go very fast, and I'm pretty sure that in a month or so, I'll have it down.  In the meantime, I just keep moving--albeit out of step with the rest of the ""class""--and I keep my heart rate high, which seems like the real goal.

With regard to the strength component of the workout, I think someone who lifts weights will find the dumbbell routines familiar and only moderately challenging (though, obviously, adjusting the size of the dumbbells allows some customization).

For others who might be wondering whether it's necessary to have a ""Transfirmer"" in order to make use of the video--it definitely helps.  I have tried the video with no step at all and with a regular step.  You'll get a workout with no special equipment, but the Transfirmer has variable step height and an incline position that are pretty useful.

8079952,5,B000AV8YXE,"This is an excellent half hour workout. Not a second is wasted, and it alternates weight sets w/ aerobics..(floor, and step).  You WILL need the Transfirmer to get the most out of it.  I love using the Transfirmer and have and enjoy all of the Firm workouts which use it.  It's versatile, sturdy, and can be used for many other Firm (and other) workouts.

Normally I don't go for half hour workouts because I find them lacking--too short, too easy, too unbalanced.  But this one is perfect. Stephanie is in top form, and the regular class of Allison, Allie, and Annie look great (no goofy faces etc which really bugs me when I do the workout over and over lol).  I'm not crazy about the music but I'm having so much fun and working out at such a good hard pace that I hardly notice.  I LOVE the step choreography!!  I love alternating the aerobics routines w/ the upper body weight routines. The time flies by and she packs a lot into half an hour.

It starts w/ a 4-min or so aerobic warmup then you do pushups (she does them on the incline, I do on the floor), then incline chest and triceps.  I have a chronic vestibular problem which means I get dizzy lying down and doing situps, etc.  so another thing I love about this one is I can do the chest work because it's right at the start (it seems I get dizzier if the floorwork is later in the workout, which is usually the case).  There's no abwork in this workout.

I got this along w/ Jiggle-Free Buns recently after gaining 15-20 pounds over the last year or so.  Previously I was in pretty good shape but I'm as out of shape now as I've ever been, at age 55 and ""enjoying"" menopause (ugh!).  I'm finding many of my beloved Firm workouts too much right now, and too long...so I bought these and they really are perfect.  I'm hoping by alternating these 2 workouts (along w/ bike riding and hiking), I'll get back in shape soon.  Will report back in a while!",1523664000,,1913,4.313725490196078

8079958,5,B000AV8YXE,"This is my favorite out of all the jiggle free series. I like to use a variety of weights with it. I laugh that every time I go to pick from my FIRM DVDs, this is really the only one I want to do as it tones my arms and it is the perfect length and not too long.",1460505600,,262,3.457627118644068
8079959,4,B000AV8YXE,"Good workout for your arms. Feel it lacks a little in my trouble spot, the triceps, but it gives one a general upper body workout in a minimum of time.",1433116800,,151,4.066666666666666
8079960,5,B000AV8YXE,This is a great upper body work out Stephanie was awesome.. There are 2 low impact step aerobics to get your blood pumping .. When your body isn't feeling challenged anymore you can add weights during low impact and  increase weight during the routine .. I do not have the transfirmer so I did have to pause a couple of times to switch from my traditional step to my inclined step. Search incline step here and you will see what I mean and it took be about 1/2 a minute .. I think it is a lot of fun .. I did get a good workout and this workout is quick and not boring . This work out is for advanced and beginners .. Beginners  for low impact use the lowest riser possible and no weights and focus on form.. For those advanced users increase the weight u might need 10 and 12  lbs and raise the height on your box.. Now for those that love aerobics and know all those fancy flying ballerina moves lmbo you will not find that here good work out but just the basic moves ..,1431648000,4,972,4.0785340314136125
8079961,5,B000AV8YXE,Havent tried it yet as Im doing the 21 day arm Challenge but anything that promises jiggle free arms Im down to try. Especially with a wedding coming up! ill rate more later when Ive tried it!,1428969600,,192,4.216216216216216
