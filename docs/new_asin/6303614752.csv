691835,5,6303614752,"This is the ultimate video for any Alice fan. When I first saw this video I was completely zoned out on the chemistry of the band. Layne was very messed up at the time but never missed a beat. Like others have mentioned it doesn't contain songs like Wake Up, I'm Above, & Artificial Red(which are 3 of my fav)but it is an AWESOME video. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!Looong Gooone Daaay",1039651200,12,375,4.449275362318841
691836,4,6303614752,This Pearl Jam/Alice In Chains sounding side group displays a creative and soulful attempt to capture the way Layne Staley sees the world around him. Excellent show!,947203200,2,165,5.148148148148148

7851773,5,6303614752,"Just because you don't buy VHS anymore and don't own a VCR doesn't mean no one else does either. Mad Season is an incredibly underrated band, true talent ignored by those with the power to promote the band and build its fanbase because in today's world true talent does not amount to much to most people if there is no money to be made off of it. If you want to know why this hasn't been released on DVD yet, you might want to ask the head of Sony/Columbia why money is king and why they so heavily promote other crap that no one with any taste is interested in for the purpose of making money and getting rich, rather than doing their jobs and focusing on the real talent of the music industry. You might want to ask them why they have become such a gigantic rubber stamp of approval for people such as any talentless jackass who decides to go sing on american idol and goes on to sell tens of millions of records for no good reason. Ask them they promote some of the worst music ever recorded and completely ignore the little bit of talent that still remains on their label. Then and only then will you know why talented bands such as Mad Season have been ignored and placed on the back burner for so long.",1143331200,7,1208,4.233766233766234
7851774,4,6303614752,"As others have said, this is well overdue on DVD. Staley is on excellent form, as are the other band members. For now though I'll have to make do with a clip I found of Mad Season performing the version of 'I Don't Know Anything' on this video.

This was in stereo and in excellent condition having been unplayed for nearly 10 years. So that's now on DVD at least until the proper release.",1122163200,,389,4.256756756756757
7851775,5,6303614752,I have seen this VHS and definitely loved it. But I think it is time to put it on DVD. It is 2005 and I do not even own a VCR anymore.,1118793600,5,134,3.21875
7851776,4,6303614752,"Ohhh man when I got this VHS in the mail I was pulsing with excitment...

Mad season, for a year have been without a doubt my favourite act over anything. Layne Staley's soul and emotion carry his voice like nothing I've ever heard before. Alice in Chains Unplugged is what got me into AIC initially, and Unplugged, the Live album, and Above have been my favourites for years..

What disappointed me about the VHS is there's no ""Wake Up"".. my favourite song.. I found a live version on Kazaa so I know they performed it but it's not on the VHS !

Someone mentioned in a review for this VHS that it's good to see Layne before he started disappearing behind gloves and sunglasses. It's hard to see but he's wearing gloves throughout the entire performance. 1995 was when things started getting worse, worse, and eventually finished.

My favourite tracks from this performance are ""river of deceit"", "" x- ray mind"", ""i don't know anything"", and the final ""all alone / november hotel""

I wish they could have showed a radio performance of Wake Up or River of Deceit

Reading this over i soud like a negative pessamist but this VHS is definatly worth getting. I love the chemistry of the band. Barret Martin is an awesome drummer, so good. Mike is great and Jon Baker Saunders is one of my favourite bassists.

Oh, and the River of Deceit video fits the song amazingly i was stoked on that.",1103328000,7,1385,4.538152610441767
7851777,5,6303614752,"I didn't expect much from this video, thinking that maybe some fan caught it on tape and it was good enough to put out (much like Morphine's ""Bootleg Detroit"" album).  Right from the start those thoughts were dispelled, with great video and even better sound. Though Layne was on the decline, his voice is very powerful.  As a big Alice In Chains fan, I definitely appreciated hearing his voice - sure I have the Mad Season album, but he doesn't sing exactly the same.  You can see him smile from time to time and he sure as doesn't look like the living dead yet.  If anything, I think this video is nice farewell to a great figure in rock history.  Other than that, Mike McCready plays some great stuff.
A great edition to any fan of Layne, the Seattle rock scene, or any Pearl Jam fan who can take their eyes off Eddie.",1073606400,20,821,4.339869281045751
7851778,5,6303614752,"Highly recommend this video.  Great performance by 5 guys, 2 of whom are no longer with us.  Staley sounds awesome and the band tears it up.  If you have the Mad Season CD, you might as well buy this video as it won't dissapoint.",1046131200,5,229,4.159090909090909
