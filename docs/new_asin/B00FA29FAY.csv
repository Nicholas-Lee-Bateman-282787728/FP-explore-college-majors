5972642,3,B00FA29FAY,This movie was ok but it took too long to get to the point. There was only one interesting part and it did not last long. I think that there could be a second movie to this but hopefully it will be much better and more interesting. Also not happy I rented the hd movie and could not play hd what a waste of money. Another thing is it takes way tooo long for the movie to load and I have high speed internet. I will probably not rent hd instant movies or any again until amazon fixes this problem. I would not recommend this movie to others because it was not very interesting. The trailer seemed like it would be a really good movie to watch but now that I seen it the movie is really not that good.,1397520000,,699,4.0

5972714,2,B00FA29FAY,"I have to say that this one really is bad. I am on a quest for some wholesome movies that have good messages and are entertaining. This film has one strong positive message that did cause me to think about my own stereotypes and actions. That's a good thing warranting the two stars. The rest I of the film was not good. Its filled with long scenes and music with oner of the main characters anguising over one thinmg or another. There is no real climax or resolution, and if you skip all these scenes you won't miss a thing.  The whole film would rerxcuce to 18 minutes.  Watch it for the conversation between George and his neighbor very near the end. Or, just watch that scene and really thik about how we think. Love one another.

8613566,2,B00FA29FAY,"Message films, i.e., films whose primary, perhaps sole purpose is to teach or otherwise demonstrate some moral, social or ethical lesson, are difficult to execute. They can be so direct, that they border on being documentary, or worse, a CNBC news story. Moreover, they can be preachy even soap boxy--no one appreciates 'being told.' And worse, they can be melodramatic, offering contrived scenes that when executed poorly, scripted poorly, present as cartoons or caricature. The actors in this film are okay and likable, but it's the story that lacks depth, texture, subtext, and subtlety. The characters are one dimensional and bland. The pacing is slow, the editing is virtually nonexistent. The message is universal: behind every face, there is a unique story. This film misses the opportunity to tell the unique story of the characters in this film. Particularly, the white couple that chooses to live in a predominantly black, ""urban"" neighborhood.

Only up side to this is I like the guy that played the lead part. He reminds me of Dax Shepard whom I loved in the TV series Parenthood.  Some people say they learned something from this movie.  Sorry, I got nothing.",1500854400,,373,4.138888888888889
8613571,5,B00FA29FAY,"meh, it's a whole lot better than B rated acting.... what's up with the reviews? I thought the cast did a great job. And the story itself was believable and good. It's sort of a story of living a day in someone else's shoes. And I wouldn't have wanted to be in his shoes on this particular day. It was all pretty much understandable, but he still got stuck in the middle of it. A good story of being a neighbor and working things out... and not to mention, pushy wives who make you better, ha ha....",1498953600,,499,4.154639175257732
