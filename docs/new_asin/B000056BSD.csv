1396789,3,B000056BSD,"These 2 movies(nicely packaged on 1 disc) were fun to see, after 17 years. In the first movie from 1984, The Lambda Lambda Lambda fraternity(Nerds) are ridiculed and pushed around by the Adams College campus jocks(Alpha-Betas, and ""Ogre""). The Tri-Lambs get to the boiling point and, finally, get some payback on the football thugs by pouring some muscle-rub gel in their jockstraps just before team practice, and later, outdueling them for the Greek Council position using mind-over-muscle at the Homecoming Carnival. The ending is very heartfelt....it makes people realize that everyone should be accepted, by others, for who they are. The 2nd film finds the Tri-Lambs in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida to attend a multi-fraternity convention. Their troubles with the Alpha-Betas continue on and, this time, the Tri-Lamb boys get thrown in the slammer because of a setup. Check out the Tri-Lambs' accomodations at the world famous ""Club Essex"" Hotel! ""Party party party""! Anthony Edwards reprises his role as Gilbert, but is seldomly seen throughout the 1987 film. ""Ogre"" has a change of heart for the Tri-Lambs, later in the film....you'll see why when you watch it! Buy this DVD here at Amazon.com. You'll enjoy these adventures of the Nerds!!!! Peace to all.",1005696000,,1256,5.2227722772277225

1396791,4,B000056BSD,"Nerd fans should rejoice at the recent CBS FOX DVD release of the first two films for the price of one.  Widescreen and the prints are sharp.  In the original film, it's brain vs. brawn at Adams College, and our heroes (especially Carradine and Edwards) are genuinely likable.  Their attractive but unlikable antagonists repeatedly goad the nerds into retaliation, with hilarious results.  One highlight is the party the nerds throw to try to get into a fraternity.  Genuine friendship is abound between hi jinks and peeking at girls.  Nerds II is a decent companion piece which sends the nerds to Fort Lauderdale for a fraternity conference.  The alpha betas are just as sadistic, and our heroes come out fighting.  Anthony Edwards only appears in a few scenes.  They have a lot of new misadventures instead of just repeating the first film.  Watch for their ""No on 15"" party.  Good fun for fans of the genre.",983750400,8,910,4.806451612903226

1396871,3,B000056BSD,"A pair of films that made being a nerd cool. When two young braniacs get treated harshly by every house on campus, they ban together with the other nerds and form their own fraternity. But a snobbish frat boy/quarterback and a bully/football coach have it in for them, and they have to prove their worth to the school by beating the jocks at their own game. The first film got a lot of attention for its stars, like Robert Carradine, Anthony Edwards, Curtis Armstrong and more. In the second film, the nerds head for Miami beach for spring break, but are again the target for attacks from their rivals, who try to set them up to get their house disbanded. But they've got more tricks up their sleeves. The sequel was entertaining, but gets cheesy. The first is a comedy classic.",1427414400,,778,4.524822695035461

1396904,3,B000056BSD,"In an ironic twist, Ted McGinley is actually involved in a better version of something. Usually the kiss of death for t TV show (look at how many TV series McGinley has come in at the tail end of in an attempt to revive the program's lagging ratings, only to fail miserably), Ted is actually a vital cog in the original ""Revenge of the Nerds."" which still holds a place in the hearts of many as a treasured piece of 80s cinema. That's not to say this movie is Oscar caliber (for what the Academy is worth anymore). Hardly. Years later it's not even gut splitting hilarity. But it's very appealing in that it's a comedy with a heart and a pretty clever vision for situational comedy. This movie may not evoke the same laughs it did way back when, though it may evoke some chuckles at the sight of modern day favorite actors in much earlier roles. However, the same cannot be said for the ""Nerds II"", of which is dreadfully painful to watch- poor pace, concept, execution, and even for a ""Nerds"" movie, too over the top. The Tri-Lambs are no longer nerds, they're just wearing nerd ""costumes"" to make them stand out as such. I love good low brown humor. I love good comedy, new or old. And I'll pit the original ""Nerds"" up against the heavily marketed comedies of late that milk their flavors of the day acting casts (see ""Wedding Crashers"" or ""Dodgeball""). Seperately, I'd give the original ""Nerds"" 3 stars, and the sequel less than 2. But for the combo, I'll lean towards the 3 as it is a good value for those looking for such. And the sequel, bad as it may be, can't drag down the appeal of the original, though is sure seems like they tried.",1170288000,,1643,4.390163934426229

1396909,2,B000056BSD,If you were one of the nerds in high school this movie will doubtless raise not so fond memories. Revenge of the Nerds has a few amusing moments (aka the talent show) but the genuine meanspiritness of the jocks in this movie inspired more than a full bullies. While the movie purports to be on the side of the nerds the characters are so stereotypical that you can't really identify with them. If you're looking for cheap laughs yeah I guess this movie is worth watching but if you are looking for a realistic portrayal of people labelled as nerds then look for the dvd of Freaks and Geeks.,1131926400,2,590,4.422018348623853

1396912,5,B000056BSD,"80s sex comedies are some of the most enjoyable guilty pleasures ever made.  I grew up with HBO, so I got to see many of them time and time again.  My parents had designated the television as my babysitter, so I was able to watch all of these raunchy movies undetected.  Porky's is probably the king of this genre, but my personal favorite without a doubt is Revenge Of The Nerds.  You watch this film and think, ""How in the hell could a person not like this movie?""  It's funny, sexy, pointless, and it gives the underdog the opportunity to sleep with the cheerleader.  Who can forget Booger at the belching contest, the panty raid on the sorority, Ogre, the Liquid Heat in the jocks, Poindexter smoking a joint or the catchy rap tune that wins them the talent contest?  If you grew up in the 80s these are classic moments you'll never forget.  Plot?  Well, Nerds Vs. Jocks on a college campus, that's about all.  Who needs plot in these kinds of films?  Highly, highly, highly recommended.  Part 2?  Well, one trend I remember in the 80s was PG-13 sequels to successful R-rated films.  If the sequel is PG-13, it's just common knowledge it isn't gonna be as good coz rather than living up to the first film or trying to go beyond, it's automatically watered down due to the rating.  The police acedemy movies suffered the same fate, yet they did have their moments.  Porky's always remained true though.  Nerds 2 isn't a terrible movie, and it sure has it's share of laughs, but it was a doomed project from the getgo.  Besides, it's a nice little bonus considering you're probably buying this dvd for the first film anyway.  Buy it, Relive it, Enjoy it!",1101513600,10,1656,4.515151515151516

Freshmen nerds are forced out of their dorm and into the gym when ""jocks"" burn down their own frat house and need a place to live.  Hilarity ensues when a group of nerds organize their own fraternity and compete for recognition on the Greek council. With the help from the hefty Omega Mu's sorority, the Tri-Lambs oust the jocks and win the coveted presidency of the Greek council, and even win the heart of a very special Pi gal.

1396918,4,B000056BSD,"Hard to believe what one feels compelled to buy, even after all these years.  The first Nerds movie came out almost 20 years ago; as a nine-year-old, I saw this movie as the ""Porky's"" of my generation.  Laughs, T&A, and more laughs.  In the age before downloading, a bunch of us used to audio tape this movie and quote from it endlessly.
20 years later, it still has me gut laughing; no mean feat.
The sequel, however, was as slight and inoffensive as it could be.  Worth the rental, but a definite step-down in all respects.  It was strictly a cash-in, and really should have been the last in the series (but then how else would Robert Carradine have found work?).

1396920,4,B000056BSD,"I remember sneakin' my first look at RotN Part I when it first came out on HBO. Or was Showtime where I first saw it? Well, in any case I was about eleven years old, and it was on during an evening when the `rents were out doin' something or another. It was my first exposure to the amazing and varied 80s-teen/college-flick-where-the-lovable-losers-pull-one-over-on-the-popular-guys-in-the-end genre, and I wasn't sure what to make of it at the outset. But as I got older and entered the realm of teenage geekiness myself, this flick kept getting' funnier every time I watched it. Maybe it was because I saw a little bit of myself in the gallant geeks (well, except for Lamar, perhaps) who band together to fight back against their more-popular and athletically-superior foes, or some such nonsense. Then again, it might've just been Lewis Skolnick's (Robert Carradine) annoying guffaw; it gets me giggling like a little girl every time I hear it. Then there's Booger's (Curtis Armstrong) gross-out tactics and crass horniness, which rarely fails to get a laugh from me. And for some reason, I love listening to the nerds' climactic musical number despite its dated new-wave cheesiness.
As for Part II, I'm one to admit that it's a fairly blatant retread of its classic predecessor. Like Part I, this one has our heroes going through their paces to overcome the odds against them. There's the new musical number that's reminiscent of the climactic performance that helped the guys win the fraternity competition. Poindexter's nearsightedness is taken advantage of for a few cheap laughs again. And Booger's almost as gross and nasty as ever before (Why `almost', you ask? Well, take a look at the MPAA rating for the first ""Nerds"", then look at the rating for this one. Yeah, see what I mean?). Oh yes, and Skolnick manages to bag the babe at the end here, just like he did last time.
But despite the sequel's glaringly obvious similarities to the first `RotN', I got quite a few laughs from it. My fave funny moment was Ogre's cannabis-induced conjecture during the desert island scene. That was a pretty precious moment in the annals of 80's screwball comedies, lemme tells ya. Also notable here is Booger being mentored by an elderly man skilled in the Far East style of slobbery. It's a pretty silly shot at the Karate Kid flicks that were really big at the time, and added a layer of gag-me-with-a-spoon-style grodiness to the flick.
One weird thing about this sequel-well, weird to me, anyway-- was Gilbert's (Anthony Edwards) minimal involvement in this follow-up. Personally, I think his small chunk of face time was due to his receding hairline, which is pretty apparent in the scenes he's in. It's kinda hard to play a college student convincingly when your pate's showin', ya know? Fortunately, he managed to land a prime role on ER as George Clooney's bestest best buddy in the whole wide world, and hasn't looked back since! Meanwhile, poor Robert ""Lewis Skolnick"" Carradine would go on to star in and executive produce the last two horrific installments in the Revenge of the Nerds saga without his good buddy. Them's the breaks in show biz...
I found the picture quality of both flicks to be pretty good, though not absolutely top-notch. And the sound mix is about as good as one can expect from a double-feature DVD. As for special features: aside from a few trailers, there ain't any.  So just sit back and enjoy the good, clean family fun you'll experience as soon as you hit the Play button...

1396921,4,B000056BSD,"While the first of the Revenge of the Nerds films helped to breathe new life in the struggling teen film market and moved the genre back to college all the while helping to create a newer ""hipper"" version of the ""nerd"" character in teen cinema - the same cannot be said for its sequel. Still, it's refreshing to see Jeff Kanew's first successful feature film, as long as it doesn't make you wonder how a director with a gift for great comedic direction managed to lose his way with such dismissable tripe as 1989's Troop Beverly Hills and the flabby Kathleen Turner pic V.I. Warshawski. Nevertheless, Revenge of the Nerds still works as a triumph in teen cinema with a talented cast (led by Robert Carradine, Anthony Edwards, and a delightfully evil Ted McGinley - before Happy Days, The Love Boat, and Married With Children turned him into a one-dimensional acting joke). Even the normally noxious Timothy Busfield has fun with his role as the violin playing Poindexter. With a story that celebrates (however problematically) diversity in class, race, and sexuality - the film succeeds on a level beyond merely making the audience laugh. Add to this a touchingly heartfelt final speech by Anthony Edwards, and there is only one way that the sequel could have gone - down.
Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise has neither the sensitivity nor the humor of the first film. Directed with heavy handed excess by Hollywood uber producer Joe Roth (you have probably stumbled into a few of his sequels - most notably Young Guns II and The Exorcist III - not to mention his directing work which includes 1990's passable Coupe DeVille and last years America's Sweethearts), Roth manages to strip mine the first film of its humor and originality and replaces its gentle approach to T&A with a hamfisted collection of fart jokes. It does have some grin worthy moments (such as the memorable zen loogie), but its otherwise a xerox of the first film, faded and uninspired. It may please die hard fans of the series, but I was disappointed at the young age of 14 - and 14 year olds aren't hard to impress.
Still, the DVD is worth picking up if only for the beautiful transfer of the first film, which is both impressive in its visual design - taking the production beyond the sitcom modeled standard for eighties comedies. I believe that the second film is packaged with the first because Fox knew that people were unlikely to buy it on its own. I know I would be.",1028764800,18,2456,4.674364896073903
1396922,4,B000056BSD,"1) Revenge of the Nerds is a classic in comedy.  One of the best Colledge Comedies around.  the story revolves around a group of rejects or Nerds who after getting kicked out of the Freshman dorm due to the Alpha Betas Irresponsibilty have to seek out a new palce to live.  The find this house, repair it, and establish it as their own.  However the Alpha betas don't like theat so they attack the place.  the only way that they can seek justice at first is to become a Fraternity. They go about doing so in a comical manner and in the end wage war agaisnt the Alpha Betas in a truely classic manner.
This heart felt tale represents the vast majority of people.  The little guys, the not so beutiful people, a very funny movie, 5 stars definite.
2)Revenge of the Nerds 2 continues the Tale of the misfits from Adams College.  They have been selected to represent Adams College at the National Fraternity convention in Fort Lauderdale.  Once again they face the odds as they face prejudice and violent backlash by the angery Alpha Betas. they fight back of course and in the end conquer Fort LAuderdale.
This one is a hit in some aspects and a miss in others.  There is some good meaning there but in the end falls flat on it's face at others.  A 3 star movie at best.
SO over all Revenge of the Nerds 5 stars, Revenge of the Nerds 2 3 stars, do the math and it comes out to 4 stars for this DVD.",1024012800,,1395,4.25
