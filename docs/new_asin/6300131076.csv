209681,5,6300131076,"This movie had alot of excellent fighting scenes!!! Bruce Li's character is noble but dark. He has a mean streak. He is very intense and serious about bringing the bandit criminals to justice dead or alive!!

In this movie, Li plays a police chief who must lead his inept department of not so good kung fu fighters against some highly skilled bad guys.
One unique scene features a man standing on another man's shoulders and fighting together as one person against Bruce Li!
That sounds different because it is the first time I have seen a fight scene choreographed this way.
Because of Ho Chung Tao (Bruce Li) and the unique fight scenes that you must see to believe, I give this movie a 5 star rating. Another amazing action movie from the legendary Ho Chung Tao!!",1193702400,6,766,4.591240875912408
209682,4,6300131076,"""Deadly Strike"" seems to be available finally in a Region-1 (or all-region?) DVD.  I have searched for this Kung-Fu movie for years, as it was one of the first action movies that my daughter would request to watch (she was 2 at the time).  However, the pricing for it (as of 05/13/2006) must be an import price ($35+).  I think I will wait a little while longer before shelling out the bucks.  Four stars for the movie - as ""goofy"" as it was - still an enjoyable ""team"" flick!",1147478400,,476,4.314606741573034
209683,3,6300131076,"This is really a pretty good movie. Bruce Li really was good in this one. He is a little sloppy but he gets better as the movie goes along. There are some really funny scenes in which Bruce fights some midgets. It's so funny  that a friend and I rewind it just to laugh. If you are a true martial  artist you will see that there are some really big differences between this  movie and ones that Li has done before this one. For one , he isn't really  acting like Bruce Lee. That is when he really does his best movies. I like  him as himself and I sure that you will too.",940464000,3,571,3.973684210526316

7803238,3,6300131076,"Ok so after ordering a dvd of the same movie and only to receive it and be of bad quality, I went on to read reviews and found that some said that this original vhs tape was uncut and good quality so I proceeded to purchase it. Well, one thing was true, it is uncut and features the nunchuku scene among other scenes as well but I have to say that the video quality is terrible. My buddy at Motophoto did his best at transferring the vhs to dvd using a high tech vhs player and other filters to bring out the best quality and still couldn't save it. In other words, this version is still of equal bad quality as those bootlegs that are being sold out there. Hope the true master tapes will be released by the parent company some day, then we can get a good copy of this classic.",1344124800,2,778,4.091503267973856
7803239,4,6300131076,"Bruce Li plays the part of a cop who employs prisoners in exchange for their freedom to jail or kill a ruthless organized crime syndicate in pure Kung Fu fashion. This is my favorite Bruce Li movie EVER because the action never stops! A Kung Fu movie lovers dream come true! If you like martial arts action and do not mind clearly outdated sound effects and the classic dubbing of Mandarin to English, this is a must-have! Bruce Li at his finest!",1283126400,,446,4.451219512195122

7803241,5,6300131076,This movie is beyond everything I expected and I think it is amazing how I can depend on Amazon to have the classics that I grew up with as a child.,1221868800,,148,3.806451612903226
7803242,4,6300131076,"Deadly Strike is a film reminiscent of the old matinee westerns that played in the theatres when I was a kid.  A new lawman (Bruce Li) comes to town, and with the aid of a group of misfit convicts he takes on the bandits and their boss (Chen Sing) who have been terrorizing the region.

The story is predictable, but enjoyable.  There's plenty of action mixed with humor and drama (or rather, melodrama, some of which is unintentionally quite funny itself).  The camera work isn't bad, but the way the film was formatted to DVD makes the cinematography look worse than it really is.  One funny gaffe: we can see the actors waiting to begin a fight sequence while adjustments to the lighting are being made.  These sort of things can be distracting, but as the story goes on you learn to look past them.

Bruce Li, while not much of an actor, has a few rather impressive fight sequences.  Chen Sing has incredible screen presence for a film of this sort, not to mention superior fighting skills. Unfortunately, you won't actually see that much of him in Deadly Strike.  It's the charming and likeable supporting cast that really makes this film, including Lung Fei and Tsai Hung as convicts working for Li, along with inept lawmen, a witty thief, and what posse would be complete without a pretty-yet-dangerous prostitute?  The bandits snarl and laugh maniacally, but never seem to pose much of a real threat.

All in all, Deadly Strike isn't a great film.  It might not even be a good film.  But it most definitely is a fun film to watch, and one that I can watch over and over without getting tired of it.  But then, I always loved those cheesy westerns when I was a kid too.",1197936000,3,1676,4.524916943521594
