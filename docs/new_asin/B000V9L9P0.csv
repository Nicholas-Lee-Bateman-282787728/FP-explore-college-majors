8217579,4,B000V9L9P0,"""Radiant City"" is an interesting faux documentary about the ills of suburban living, presumably suffering by comparison with urban existence.  It follows the daily life of one family in the Winnipeg area -long commutes, crushing daily routines, a suburban wasteland for kids bicycling around empty streets, pre-teen boys paintballing around half-built houses.  I say faux documentary because the family members are ""played"" by actors..or at least by people not really related to each other. Suburban existence is decried as soul-crushing.

Maybe but ... I don't hear a unanimous chorus of this from the characters portrayed. In free societies, people can choose to live in the city or in the `burbs.  Tradeoffs abound; life is like that.  No one forces people to move out to the suburbs but harsh economic facts often make urban living financially out of reach.  Not to mention (often) poor schools, crime, noise, congestion, etc.  The joys of urban living are not altogether idyllic, as often suggested by the young, hip, urban planners and architects who offer cameos in this film.

Some suburbs still cultivate a sense of community, despite their remoteness from downtown areas. It can be done.  In my closest ""radiant city"" (Washington DC), you stand a much better chance of getting mugged or murdered than if you live in the suburbs.  That's a tall price for being hip!!

The solution?  Forced resettlement of suburbanites to the overpriced environs of downtown?  The closest solution offered is the notion of building workplaces and apartments in peoples' front yards, in the 24-feet setbacks that you find in many suburbs.  I question how realistic that is.  ""Radiant City"" is an interesting film that provokes contemplation on lifestyle tradeoffs people make and how they can make conscious choices about ordering their lives.  It may mythologize excessively the presumed joys of urban dwelling over suburban existence.",1196121600,,1927,5.248366013071895
