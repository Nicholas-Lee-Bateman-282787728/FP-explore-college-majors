8510612,1,B0075NAKQE,"This dvd sucks.ken Gullette may have won gold in the USA, but he is a horrible instructor. + it's all 2 partner. Badly shot. He does all this loud exhaling with out any explanation of breathing. All with some dufus idiot white belt. Then tries to sell his website.",1409875200,,264,4.408163265306122
8510613,5,B0075NAKQE,"Practicing principles that I wish I knew about when I started Taichi more than 12 years ago.

Ken has explained the internal strength principles in plain English and illustrated them clearly in the video. There is no mysticism involved but clear body mechanics to train. Once the principles are understood, Taichi (or any internal arts) practice will become very meaningful and fulfilling.

Based on my experience and observations, even if you pay 100s or even 1000s of dollars taking hours of lessons with a qualified instructor, you may not be able get the same clarity on how to practice as compared to what you can get from this 1hr 40min video.",1384300800,3,649,4.837837837837838
8510614,5,B0075NAKQE,"5 stars for this video. Sifu Ken Gullette provides some very simple exercises to get people to develop ""peng"" energy, whole body movement, ground path energy, and silk reeling energy. These are practical exercises which allow you to begin to manifest these movements at your own pace and give you instant feed back. He stresses cooperation in doing the movements, which I believe is essential. These movements are subtle, contrary to normal ideas of no pain no gain, and require a different way of manifesting energy in your body. They will require time to develop, but Sifu Gullette also brings knowledge of the basic underlying principles of how and why they do work. The how and why part is often absent from Tai Chi instruction. As a compass prides a sense of forward direction these exercises  will help students have a firmer path to future progress.",1370131200,3,856,4.863013698630137
8510615,5,B0075NAKQE,"I ordered this DVD a few months ago, along with a couple of Sifu Gullette's Hsing-I DVD's. This one is a little different because it doesn't teach fighting techniques, instead focusing on the body mechanics necessary to generate proper power. The instruction is clear and direct, and the exercises are simple, but not easy. It takes practice and work to nail the proper mechanics, but doing so will transform your martial arts practice.",1336780800,,436,4.986301369863014
8510616,5,B0075NAKQE,"Sifu Gullette demonstrates all the basic elements necessary to practice good internal arts.  The body mechanics are explained in detail in an understandable format that is easy to follow.  The demonstration of the these elements (ground, peng, whole body movement, and silk reeling) also ads the ability to see these practices in motion.  I, personally, am a very visual learner and seeing someone perform the exercises is a huge benefit to my learning process.  Insights are given on how to work with a partner or in the privacy of your own home allowing flexibility in your training experience. There is nothing out there that is comparable to the information in this DVD as a high majority of martial artists do not know and/or understand these basic principles that are necessary for good kung fu.  I highly advise anyone practicing martial arts (chinese and otherwise) to pick up this DVD.  It will improve your mechanics allowing your forms to flow better and generate more power.",1331078400,,986,4.9817073170731705
8510617,5,B0075NAKQE,"Sifu Ken Gullette is a master instructor of the internal Chinese martial arts of taijiquan (Tai Chi), Baquazhang and Xingyiquan (Hsing Yi Chuan) who strips away the new-agey, metaphysical trappings attributed to those arts, making them available to anyone who seriously wants to learn.  In ""Internal Strength for Hsing-I, Tai Chi and Baqua"" he stresses that there's no magic or sorcery involved.  But as Arthur C. Clarke once said, ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""

Perhaps more than in his other DVD's, in this one, Gullette gets into the physics and body mechanics of the internal martial arts.  Gullette has broken internal training into four key components.

 1. Ground path: how to redirect your opponent's strength into the ground using your body's structure.

 2. Peng jin:  a type of springy strength sought by all practitioners of internal arts.  Gullette compares it to trying to push a beach ball under water, then releasing it and letting it shoot up into the air.

 3. Silk-reeling: Spiraling movements which generate kinetic energy through the body, which originates from the ground and moves through the practitioner's body and out through the hand or foot.

 4. Whole-body movement: This is where the student puts it all together, using the principles of ground path, peng jin and silk-reeling, moving his whole body as a unit to generate power in movements.

 This DVD includes more than 25 exercises to develop and test your own internal strength.  It's not as dramatic as other instructional martial arts DVD's - there's no spinning flying kicks or brick breaks here.  It's just good, solid internal training based on plain, scientific principles, not magic, that would help martial artists of any style.",1329177600,15,1762,5.1879432624113475
8510618,5,B0075NAKQE,"My take is that this DVD is one of the most informative and functional internal strength videos available on the market today. The DVD covers all the crucial elements on key internal skills. From my experience, these skills aren't taught my many instructors.

The practical application of the internal arts and exercises demonstrated in this video have assisted me greatly with developing a real understanding of core principles in the internal arts (whole body movement, ground path, silk reeling, peng jin, etc.). Let's be honest, learning the internal arts and having true martial ability is not easy to come by. However, applying the exercises demonstrated in this video to your training regimen will certainly get you a step closer to unlocking the body mechanics & foundation of the internal arts.",1328572800,8,803,5.176923076923077
8510619,5,B0075NAKQE,"While I had spent many years in the martial arts with an emphasis on tai chi and bagua, my instructors either were not aware of the principles in this DVD, or only taught these principles indirectly.

This DVD is a gold mine of information.  It explains the concepts of 'ground path', peng, spiralling/silk-reeling, and full body motion in clear and concise terms.  He gives solid non-mystical reasons behind the effectiveness of the body mechanics that he describes, and shows in great detail how to incorporate these concepts into your practice.

I have many martial arts instructional videos in my library, and I can't think of another DVD that has impacted my internal arts practice as much as the ""Internal Strength"" DVD.  This DVD changed the way I did all of my internal martial arts forms. I could have saved literally months to years of hard work if I had known about the concepts explained in this video when I started my training.

I highly recommend this DVD for all practitioners of tai chi, hsing-I, and bagua.  If you don't learn anything new from this DVD, you are very, very fortunate indeed to have had great teachers and you are far luckier than I.  For everyone else, this DVD needs to be on your shelf and in your DVD player.",1328313600,8,1246,4.657534246575342
8510620,5,B0075NAKQE,"I have used this video several times to help with my own training, and the information and insights that it provides have helped me in every aspect of the internal arts I study. I even find myself applying some of the topics in my everyday life (and no, I don't go about picking fights all the time :-p ). It's a very useful resource for anyone aspiring to better themselves at martial arts, a ""must have"" for the serious trainers out there.",1328313600,3,441,4.390243902439025
