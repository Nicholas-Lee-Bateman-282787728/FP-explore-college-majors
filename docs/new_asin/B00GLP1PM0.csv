8624286,5,B00GLP1PM0,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE! I am so glad I spent a little extra and purchased the extended Collector's Edition.  This is in my top 3 most interesting movies I have ever watched in the genre of Science Fiction and Fantasy. That said, there is a very tangible undercurrent throughout the entire movie of a present and prescient allegory that was so deeply moving, it touched the very center of my Heart.  A few years back someone very dear to me, who is no longer with us, told me that Avatar was the perfect movie for me. He was right.  In this ever-changing dynamic we call Life, I had forgotten what was said between us about movies.  When I went to my Amazon page recently to check on an order, their pattern recognition software put up the front cover of Avatar as a suggestion for me and his words came flooding back, ""You haven't seen Avatar yet?  Oh no, you really should have seen it on the huge screens in the theater.  Oh well, I know it will probably become one of your favorite movies.""  Indeed, It Is.",1463443200,3,1005,4.342245989304812
