728375,4,6303925782,Great family flick and I am a big Clint Walker fan shipping was good glad to have it as part of my collection.,1306713600,,110,3.8260869565217392
728376,5,6303925782,"This film is a heart warming, family friendly movie for children over 12.

There is one scene where the mother (Diane Baker) swears at her husband, and then tells her son to disobey his father. Parents of young children may wish to discuss this before the movie.

Later there is another scene concerning vigilante justice which starts out as if it will become violent, but it defuses and is not violent in the end.

The musical score is touching and appropriate; the outdoor filming is well done.

Clint Walker gives an outstanding and believable performance as the boy's
  father.  Burl Ives gives an excellent and interesting  portrayal of a recluse who has been misunderstood. Young Lee Montgomery is well cast as the son. Diane Baker gives a mediocre performance as the boy's mother.",1291161600,15,787,4.864661654135339
728377,3,6303925782,"Anything with Clint Walker will be entertaining, this is a good family movie with Walker playing the boy's father. The young actor lee montgomery is fine and pulls off his role well.  The actual lead belongs to Burl Ives who is excellent as an old man living alone who befriends Walker's boy.  The dvd is very good quality.  The director fails to take advantage of Walker's role, and the final showdown between the bad guys and Walker, playing the sheriff, is a bit disappointing but on the whole a good watch.",1262995200,5,510,4.582417582417582

728380,1,6303925782,"This poorly made production features Clint Walker as Dan Baker, a homesteader in 1876 Utah who refuses to join a local vigilante organization, led by the town dry goods grocer (Alan Young), and the resultant effects his independent actions have upon his son Billy (Lee H. Montgomery). Ancillary plots involve Billy's nurturing of a wounded fledgling hawk, abandoned from the nest, and the boy's friendship with Mr. McGraw (Burl Ives), a recluse whose vocation is the preparation of damaged wildlife for their return to freedom. It is not possible to include a kind word about the direction, screenplay and editing, as all are at levels which might, at best, approach that of student-made cinema. The acting is wooden, due largely to the rambling script and weak direction, with Montgomery embarrassingly inept, and only Ives rises above his shrunken material, giving some meaning to his scenes. Although there is precious little to like about this film, the scenery is remarkably beautiful, as the production was located within two of Utah's National Forest regions.",1127260800,9,1066,5.203488372093023

728501,5,6303925782,"Baker's Hawk, based on the book of the same name, is one of the greatest pieces of cinema of this genre ever created. Many other films have tried and failed miserably to capture the honest spirit and beauty of Baker's Hawk. Taking place in 1876, it concerns a boy, an injured hawk he befriends, and an old man the town thinks is crazy simply because he likes helping injured animals so they can have a second chance at life. The lessons for the boy are big, as is the bonding of the boy, old man and hawk.

I last saw this on VHS at least 15 years ago and the print on that tape was of so- so quality, and not much has changed with the DVD version, but I can honestly say that it really doesn't make a bit of difference. The scenery is superb, and the story is the same. So what if some film artifacts are present from time to time? With such a poignant story and stellar cast, any other shortcomings are just that, and can easily be ignored. Get this film if you want to have a great viewing experience with your kids again and again. You will definitely not regret it.",1405123200,3,1070,4.169082125603865
728570,3,6303925782,"I remembered watching this movie as a child and liking it.  Since I wanted to buy wholesome movies for my kids to watch, I decided to take my chances and even though my kids (elementary school ages) seemed to like the story, it was hard to watch because of the poor picture quality.  Some of the scenes seemed dark and hard to make out the details.  We do have a good flat-screen tv so I can't blame it on the tv.  So it was good enough to watch once, but I'd be surprised if we watch it again.  I do wish there were more movies like this though- too bad there's not more of a market for them so they can be remade for better picture quality.",1403740800,2,642,4.0236220472440944
728571,4,6303925782,"Young Billy Baker (Lee Montgomery)  finds an injured red-tailed hawk & reluctantly takes it to the supposed ""crazy man"" (Burl Ives) living at the top of the mountain. Of course, the ""crazy man"" turns out to be a wise, good-hearted recluse who finds better company among the animals he nurtures than among the townspeople below. And he has good reason -- due to worries about thefts & strangers in the area, the townspeople have formed a ""vigilance committee"" to maintain order, refusing to go to the local sheriff for help. While the founder of the group is merely scared & concerned, too many who join use it as a means for bullying & venting their own insecurities on anyone who's the least bit different.

Billy's father Dan Baker (Clint Walker) is the one farmer who won't bend & join the group. As he advises his son Billy, once you decide that you're above the law, you can denounce & attack anyone you don't like, while masking it as ""public concern"" -- a sadly relevant message to this day. But the pressure from his neighbors eats away at him, and he takes it out on his son for ""wasting his time"" training the injured hawk & learning about a deeper communion with Nature from the kindly recluse.

Matters come to a head when the vigilantes decide the ""crazy man"" has to be driven from his home. Why? They couldn't say themselves, except that he's different, and they accuse him of being ""so high & mighty"" -- the truth being that they can't bear their own feelings of helplessness, so they have to find a convenient scapegoat. Again, an all too timely message. Those who want to be left alone to just live their lives don't always get that chance, because their mere existence is seen as a threat by the frightened.

Yes, this has the quality of an average but hardly outstanding made-for-TV movie, and the storyline feels a bit truncated at times. Diane Baker especially isn't given enough of a role as the boy's mother, although she brings real warmth & strength to her couple of brief scenes. But the bittersweet ending is an honest one, showing that while good people must stand up for decency, it doesn't always make everything all right, tied up neatly in a pretty bow. There's often a price for being a decent human being, and the mob does sometimes get away with its crimes. An excellent film for smaller children, with a strong ethical message & some difficult food for thought -- rather than simply preach, the film asks the young viewer to think about things afterward.

Despite its weaknesses, which merit 3 stars at best for so-so filmmaking quality, I give it 4 stars because of its obvious but good lesson & for the sheer beauty of the hawk itself, magnificent in flight -- recommended!",1389484800,2,2711,4.6161825726141075

728577,5,6303925782,"This is a TV Movie so the quality is OK, but the story is as current then as what is happening right now in the USA coming up to the 10 anniversary of 9/11. Whenever one group of people decide that their way is the only way, and that they are willing to hurt and kill others over it, than you have nothing more than Al Qeada, the Taliban, the KKK, or the 2011 Tea Party.
Clint, Burl, Diane, and the Boy do a great job of promoting tolerance, in the face of intolerance, and religious bigotry.
Great family movie!

728578,4,6303925782,"If right should prevail as the ending to this movie, why did the old man from the mountains (Burl Ives) have to leave his place and the mob burned it down?  If the sheriff and Clint Walker had turned back the mob, where did the other mob come from that burned the cabin.  All told, the story is pretty good but the ending does not support what should have been right.  I was hoping to pass this along to children, but did not like the conclusion of the movie.  Also, maybe the only four letter word in the whole movie was said by the Mother using a ""damn"" in anger.  Beautiful scenery and the little boy did a good job in his part and Burl Ives was very good.",1309910400,2,659,4.077519379844961

7855390,4,6303925782,"The film, ""Baker's Hawk"", opened to mixed/negative reviews in 1976, with critics hounding the sentimental and ""sappy"" nature of the movie's plot. However, I think what they failed to grasp was the central meaning behind it all, the message that one CAN be different and still leave their mark on the world.  The notion that some people which society might define as ""odd"" or ""creepy"" is oftentimes nothing more than a ridiculous stereotype that is usually fueled by misinformation from the media, or just idle gossip that unfortunately many small  communities thrive on and are notorious for...

The premise of the film takes place in 1876, and features ""The Baker"" of Baker's Hawk, which refers to a young Lee Harcourt Montgomery, the son of Clint Walker and Diane Baker, who finds an injured and abandoned hawk in the woods. Montgomery takes what he thinks is a bold chance and goes to the cabin of Burl Ives, who has a reputation among the locals as being an eccentric, old ""crazy man."" In truth, he's simply a reclusive hermit who just happens to prefer the company of animals a lot more than humans, and the people around his neck of the woods certainly don't give him any reason to think or believe otherwise. But he does warm up to young Montgomery, and the two of them form a special bond collaborating on mending the injured hawk back to health...

Meanwhile, the grown-ups have some problems of their own. Clint Walker is up against a town who wants to form a ""vigilante committee"" because they don't like certain elements coming to their area. The head vigilante is, of all people, Alan Young who plays a shop keeper, but who really had no idea what he started. Eventually, Walker becomes deputy of the town to county sheriff, Taylor Lacher, and that sets everything up for a dramatic confrontation.

Baker's Hawk is a heartwarming family film, the kind that is sorely lacking in today's ""sex/violence"" for entertainment culture. It's also an educational tool that people, no matter what their life circumstances, background, upbringing, or how ""different"" society perceives them to be, can perhaps become one of your best friends and should be treated with respect and dignity regardless. It also teaches a fine lesson about taking the law into your own hands, and the consequences thereof. The movie was filmed primarily in Utah, therefore contains some truly gorgeous cinematography filmed on location in Utah's national parks.  The scenes with Ives (who made this movie IMO) and Montgomery, along with the animals, are the best part of the film. This is the kind of movie you curl up with on the couch during a rainy, dreary day.  A cup of cocoa, some cookies, a blanket, and maybe the company of a good friend or close family, makes for some good, old-fashioned entertainment.  They don't make movies like this anymore. Too few and far between.  Enjoy!",1471219200,,2868,4.848670756646217
