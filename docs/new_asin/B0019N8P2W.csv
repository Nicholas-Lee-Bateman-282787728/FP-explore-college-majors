3441830,5,B0019N8P2W,I really think some one at MTV should listen to their customers and bring out Daria on DVD. I mean they have Beavis and Butthead and that come out before Daria and is alot better. We can only hope that someone out there is listening to us,1216339200,,238,4.085106382978723
3441831,5,B0019N8P2W,"I can't believe they still haven't put this series out on dvd.  Daria was one of the last shows on MTV that was even worth watching..and they aren't going to try to get some more money out of that?  Something's wrong with This picture..Come on, MTV..get on the ball, get all those Daria episodes out on DVD so all of us can finally find the peace that is found in the logic that is Daria...
In other words - Love the show, want to buy it, can't, because stupid company apparently doesn't think there's enough of a market for it..Hmm..",1214956800,3,534,4.33
3441832,5,B0019N8P2W,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

If you are reading this review then you are probably searching for the greatest television series on DVD that never was.  Alas, it is true... those imbeciles over at MTV probably do not realize the millions of dollars they are losing by not making this show available to all the fans of our reluctant heroine.  If Daria were real she would scorn MTV (for having to listen to all this griping about a show from the nineties.)  So, just do it already so she doesn't have to suffer any longer.

This has been an act of desperation.  Thank you.",1214611200,23,579,4.466666666666667
3441833,5,B0019N8P2W,"It is such a shame that this show has not yet been released. After all of the petitions and support behind the release of Daria on DVD it is just awful that it has not yet become a reality. I'm 17 years old and I fell in love with the show in 2005 when it was airing on the N and I have many friends my age who love the show just as much as I do. With the attention Daria has recieved from my age group coupled with the older fans of the show it is guaranteed sell quickly. I really hope that executives at MTV really get themselves together and figure out a way to get Daria on DVD. Although there are a lot of issues regarding the rights to all of the music they use in the show, I still have faith that this show will one day get released with the help of its loyal fans. I LOOOOOOVE DARIA!!!!!",1214438400,15,797,3.895705521472393
3441834,5,B0019N8P2W,"Holy Smokes, I had no idea that other people felt the same. I loved this show when it was on and recorded all but one episode on VHS. Sadly I've watched them so much that they are no longer viewable. I want my DVD MTV.
Is anyone listening out there? Please put this show on DVD. PLEASE! Please note that I am willing to pay lots of money for this program. Long live Daria Morgendorffer.",1213920000,5,386,4.16
3441835,5,B0019N8P2W,"I remember some time ago checking for this and signing a petition for this show to be released on DVD and am STUNNED that it has not happened yet.
I see cartoon shows like Undergrad with a complete season DVD and I have never even heard of that show.

Daria is a great show that had (and still has) many loyal followers.
C'mon MTV!
Make up for your current lackluster programming (My Sweet Sixteen and Pimp my Ride,etc) and release this DVD set.

Listen to the fans.
They give you money.",1213747200,4,487,4.34065934065934
3441836,5,B0019N8P2W,"I have to agree with you D. Guery! Though I wasn't a teen when Daria came out, my daughter watched it, and I LOVED this cartoon! One of the best they've come out with, and I miss it too! Funny how I will compair the personalities of people I know with the characters on Daria!",1213142400,5,276,4.036363636363636
3441837,5,B0019N8P2W,"Daria is one of my favorite animated shows.  She's sarcastic, dry, thoughtful - and the show just reeks of wit and irony.  I can't believe this is not on DVD - my friends and I check all the time, hoping for the day.  I miss the high school adventures of Daria, Jane, Quinn and the Fashion Club.  Please please satisfy the loyal fans and put Daria on DVD!!!",1212883200,33,357,4.205882352941177

3441839,5,B0019N8P2W,"Other than the original music being removed (explained in the DVD insert), great quality and amazing price for this classic! I definitely forwarded the link to my sister and friends! We lived Daria growing up and get to relive the good old days of MTV at our leisure.",1523232000,,267,4.583333333333333

3441841,5,B0019N8P2W,A great show at a great price. My 15 year old is so full of deadpan sarcasm that it made me think of my favorite 90's teenager. This series really holds up well and now my kids are hooked. Even though the show being 20 years old makes me feel ancient I am still glad that I get to binge this nostalgia with my own angsty teens.,1522972800,,327,3.8955223880597014

3441843,5,B0019N8P2W,"I miss having the original music, but I'm in it for the story and the laughs, so I won't knock off any stars for that. Fantastic show, so pleased to have the whole series!",1522713600,,171,4.0588235294117645
3441844,5,B0019N8P2W,"While I am considerably older than the targeted audience, I appreciated the jaundiced eye cast on suburban life.  Daria focuses on a well-read, well-informed, highly opinionated high school student and her equally intelligent artistic best friend.  Some of the best moments occur when Daria has caused an adult, any adult, to question his or her  career choice, lifestyle, or intelligence.  The series just kept getting better and deeper and wilder.  Im so happy to have thisespecially at this price!   ",1522540800,,503,5.2784810126582276

3441846,4,B0019N8P2W,"Great show. As I was just complaining to myself about how subtitles weren't an option, one episode later Daria opted out of going to a movie theater because it didn't have subtitles. Ironic.",1521417600,,190,4.787878787878788
3441847,5,B0019N8P2W,"Great quality, just wish the ending songs were the ones from tv, they couldn't because they couldn't afford the licensing.",1520640000,,122,5.15

3441857,5,B0019N8P2W,"I love this show so much,  no complaints about that. The only thing i was displeased with was the handling of my dvd set. When i received it, the prongs that were meant to hold the seasons together had broken,  so that section was just flailing about",1516838400,,250,4.297872340425532
3441858,5,B0019N8P2W,If you love Daria or never even heard of her this set is woth every penny. Priceless entertainment for years to come. You won't ever get tired of Daria Morgandorfer and Jayne Lane!,1516406400,,180,4.484848484848484
3441859,5,B0019N8P2W,"So, yeah the music isn't the original for like, 97.7% of this dvd but TRUST ME. YOU DO NOT REALLY NOTICE. Its really not a big deal. If you really are just a fan of Daria, you will love this DVD, because it IS the complete series along (pilot included) with both movies. It has Daria day extras, Mystik Spirals video and some other sweet stuff. I would suggest you purchase this. Yeah you can watch the original Daria on random sites online but its a much bigger joy to own it. The discs themselves have character art on them. It would be a little better if it did include a small booklet with some extra stuff but thats just if Im picking something to be negative.",1516320000,4,665,4.244094488188976

It's funny cause when I was a teen watching it I related to Daria and now that I'm a parent/working stiff I relate to the parents... Made me laugh, definitely withstood the test of time.",1516147200,,269,4.4
3441862,3,B0019N8P2W,its not the actual music. but it's mostly intact from the original... might return it. might not. I was more excited about it before I got it and heard all the music was changed,1515542400,,177,4.235294117647059
3441863,5,B0019N8P2W,I freaking love this show - takes me back!! Seriously a great deal!! 1 season cost $14.99 to watch on Amazon Prime - no thanks! I'll get the entire series for the same price.,1515542400,,174,4.147058823529412

So at the moment I am letting them all warm up. All discs look to be in good condition. Only piece of the whole thing I am bummed about is the outer box for Reign is pretty scarred up. I don't normally use them as part of the DVD packaging, I tend to use them as decorations in my room... So we'll see. Glad everything made it here... (still waiting for my had that I ordered the same time though...",1515196800,,562,4.072072072072072
3441867,4,B0019N8P2W,"Ive never seen this show in its entirety, so it doesnt bother me, but it should be noted the music has been changed from the original aired version for legal/copyright reasons.
Also, the box is cheaply made. Before I even opened it several of the pieces for holding the discs in place had broken off, allowing the discs to fall loose.
Otherwise a great value.",1513987200,,359,4.538461538461538
3441868,3,B0019N8P2W,"I was so thrilled when I saw this box set available for such a great price. However, I was extremely disappointed when the set arrived and the plastic case was warped (looked like this item had been sitting in a warehouse for some time) and the case was broken, with a whole chunk of the bottom completely missing. The discs themselves play fine so it wasn't worth it to me to pursue a refund or exchange, but I was not pleased with the quality of the case.",1513900800,,457,4.264367816091954

3441872,1,B0019N8P2W,"Should be zero stars.  The entire soundtrack is a bogus replacement, making the collection worthless and every penny spent on it basically stolen by Viacom crooks.  Corporate entities ""releasing"" shows without their original music is false advertising and they should be prosecuted for fraud.  Meanwhile it wouldn't cost them more than the platinum toilet fitting on their executive yacht to pay for the music rights, but they. just. don't. care.

3441874,5,B0019N8P2W,The classic series of a high school misanthrope with a incredible yet sadistic sense of humor. This collection contains every episode. Only thing missing is the music from the original airing on MTV.,1510272000,,199,5.0606060606060606

3441895,5,B0019N8P2W,This collection rocks!  I thought I had seen all the episodes and I was pleasently surprised to watch a few episodes that were new to me.

I highly recommend this box set.,1499299200,,326,4.684210526315789

If you want the original music that really set the mood for each episode, search for the VHS releases. One of my discs was defective, so I couldn't see the second half of ""Malled"". Other than that, it is an excellent series with a lead character that I strongly relate to.

3 stars because the original music is not included, and a disc was defective.",1496102400,3,461,4.3604651162790695

3441905,5,B0019N8P2W,"I watched this show a lot as a kid. I don't think I knew it was for teenager's. I just saw it as a cartoon. The humor went over my head until I was in middle school. I just saw this animated series where the dad was always doing something crazy (like making a house with his mashed potatoes). I picked up some of the things going on and found them funny. So, when I saw this DVD at Walmart, all those happy memories came back to me. Unfortunately, Walmart only had one season, so I bought the complete series set on here. I was worried I might not like it as much but I loved it enough to watch the set three times. I get the humor now and laugh uncontrollably at some jokes. I have songs from the musical episode stuck in my head. I can see how the show influenced my writing. Daria is just as funny, just as biting All these years later. The show is still completely relatable. Highly recommended!",1495065600,2,899,4.142857142857143

3441907,5,B0019N8P2W,Arrived very quickly and as  advertised,1494633600,,39,5.5
3441908,5,B0019N8P2W,"As stated it included all the seasons plus bonuses, the music is different but the opener song and ""Frickin Friends"" by Mystic Spiral are still included, so I'm good...Even has the two movies at the end. I enjoyed it thoroughly.",1494374400,3,228,4.725
3441909,4,B0019N8P2W,"Daria was probably the only thing MTV put out in the 90s that I really cared for because it spoke to my teen angst on a level nothing else did at the time.  I was heartbroken when MTV finally pulled the plug, but elated to find Daria streaming in multiple places over the years.  Unfortunately MTV pulled Daria from streaming outlets so I've finally had to buck up and purchase the DVD set, which is probably why you're looking at it now too.

This set, while lacking the original music, is still Daria at the heart of it - all your favorite episodes are there, all your favorite characters - just some bits of weird stock music thrown in where your alt favorites once played.  The set is FULL of special features like the Daria Day intros, which I'd totally forgotten about, and the two specials, Is it Fall Yet and Is it College Yet - Fantastic, I don't have to spend an extra $10 each for those dvds.

The product itself is packaged in an acceptable way, however an episode listing or info booklet would have been a nice addition, maybe a little fold-out about the history of the show, some info on who worked on it - you know - extras.  In the front pocket of the case, there's a letter about the lack of original music - something a lot of people are really upset about apparently judging by previous reviews.  I've included it as an attachment so you can read for yourself.  My box seemed to be a bit damaged, but the DVDs were all in perfect condition, so I don't really care that the cover is wrinkled.

So to break it down for you

Pros:
Decent price for what you get
Quality transfer (image and sound both clear)
Nostalgia factor is high

3441918,5,B0019N8P2W,This is one of my favorite animated shows of all time. I watched when it started in 1997  and on the noggin network years later but finally it was released on DVD in 2010.it is missing the original music with just mostly stock music and splendora filling in the gaps but I don't think it takes away from the show and really didn't notice except in a few spots Daria is one of the most highly intelligent characters of any animated show so much so that I didn't really get alot of things she talked about until I was much older but loved the show as a teen because I related to Daria and her friends the characters are great even the goofy characters like Kevin Brittany and darias sister Quinn eventually grow and become more complex especially Quinn as the series goes along most people felt like Daria in high school in some way alienated but Daria was strong and intelligent and the show still never gets old to me after all this time,1489190400,2,937,4.354285714285714

3441920,3,B0019N8P2W,"Still a great series after all this time.  I may well have gone to Lawndale High and not known it.

This collection disappoints because the material, which was originally produced 4:3 has been stretched out to 16:9, which makes it look pretty awful.  I know the set was released in 2010, but I thought we'd stopped doing that by then.  Picture quality for the first season is fair but not bad for a cartoon produced on a Beavis-and-Butthead budget.  The loss of the original music is kind of sad, but not sad enough that the stories don't shine through it, and I'm glad to have a copy now that it's no longer on Prime Video.

Short answer:  Worth the $15 to have it, but die-hard fans and purists will find that it comes up a bit short.",1488585600,2,736,4.328467153284672

I just don't watch anymore. The creator states that the licensing to have so many of the popular songs that were on the show would have made it impossible to put the episodes on DVD. So the background and certain scene music has changed other than that - it is awesome. This is actually my 2nd set. I purchased one in 2011 and then this one.",1477958400,,497,4.03030303030303

My fiancee had never even heard of the show and was pleasantly surprised by the witty writing and off-handed comments.  When the last episode played, his response had been ""That's it?""

The extras on the DVD and the included movies allows for a full watching of the series.  The movies are put together on the same disc, making it confusing to know the exact order to watch everything in if you are not aware of the show.

Is it fall yet?  should be watched after season 4.

Mostly clear, sometimes there is a scene that isn't as crisp as the others, but it passes quickly. Audio is clear and clean. I can easily understand what they are talking about.

Get set for a great price. Why spend $20 for each season and movie when you can get it all for $20 instead. Definitely worth it.

The show ended too soon and had very interesting themes and insights of today's culture. When I saw this set I could not believe the price for ALL the seasons and Daria films. It's hard to find complete DVD sets nowadays and one that is affordable. Not even iTunes has the Daria complete animated series to buy, but only by episode.

I tested out the first disc to make sure it worked and it did perfectly. This really brings back nostalgia because Daria was the only show I ever watched on MTV as a kid growing up (I guess I wasn't mature enough to enjoy the content being that I wasn't even in my teens yet) but I was able to personally connect with this show.

Each disc is 3 hours worth of shows. The opening credits are only played once if you choose the ""Play All"" function, which is nice, because the only thing that DOESN'T hold up are the opening credits - they seem excessively long. The closing credits play after each show under the play all function. There's also a lot more material here than I thought there would be. The seasons are longer than I remembered, so I'm pleasantly surprised by the amount of content that I've received. Overall, I'm very happy with this and I'm not sure why I waited so long to get the complete animated series.",1454976000,,774,4.48936170212766

The dvd quality is high, however, and several extras are included (described elsewhere so I won't go into that here). For fans of the show, I highly recommend this. My own adolescent daughter has become a big fan, too, and has shared this with a lot of her friends. It's funny that Daria still appeals to my daughter's generation at the same time that it brings back nostalgia for the 90s to me.

Now if only I could get the complete series of Dr. Katz for the same price.",1451779200,,676,4.232558139534884

3442122,1,B0019N8P2W,"Well, let me start by saying no, I'm not upset about there not being any original music; the packaging is clean and fine, nothing was PHYSICALLY broken, and it arrived to me faster than anything else I ordered this past week. Whit that, I will say that I am very disappointed and a little heart broken.

When I went to watch the first disc, the first episode played fine but halfway through the next episode, the screen went gray and the audio kept playing. Now, I was watching this on my laptop so I figured it just wasn't compatible (?). Then I popped it into my PS3 and, again, it would play then display the ""Disc cannot be read"" error. I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt so I tried to play it in a normal DVD player and it still wouldn't work.

I VERY MUCH wanted them to work so I gave up on the first disc, tried the second, and struggled with the same problems.

I'm not sure where to go from here. all I know is that I have a very nice box set of one of my favorite shows that I can't watch.",1451606400,,1009,4.035

3442135,5,B0019N8P2W,"I went into shock when I saw this on the ""Deal of the Day"" from Amazon last week. I had to buy it and I'm SO glad I did. Initially, I bought it nostalgically. I loved this show when it first came out in 1997, although, I have to admit, my memory of shows I loved to watch back then don't seem as funny now. So, I watched the first episode last night (to see if my memory of this show was realistic) and yeah, just as good as I remembered. I binged watched 10 episodes after the first and look forward to watching more tonight.

There was some nostalgia... corded landlines and the bulky cordless phones (no, not cell phones). Doc Martens. Jane's hair (I think Katy Perry stole this look from one of her videos). Someone mentioned the music was different... it is. However, I was surprised that I like this music, just not as well.",1451260800,2,830,4.253164556962025

3442142,5,B0019N8P2W,"The DVD's came shrink wrapped and were pretty much brand new. I haven't had any problems playing the DVDs.

As for the show. Daria was a childhood show I watched in the late 1990's to early 2000's. The show starts with Daria starting at her new high school, Lawndale, where it is evident she's as much an outcast here as she was at her previous home, Highland. Her best friend Jane, mother Helen, father Jake, and younger sister Quinn are the main characters around Daria. Her classmates, teachers and various other characters round out the rest of the cast. While Daria is sarcastic and pokes fun at times in her subtle way, there are times where the show touches on more serious topics like large changes in the dynamic of a friendship and standing up (or not) for what you believe in.

Overall, I'm glad I got this DVD. I'll be enjoying this show for years.",1448841600,,860,4.506410256410256

I have spent years cursing netflix for not offering Daria; this show is the perfect mixture of nostalgia, sarcasm, and relatability. There are some complaints about the music being different from the original, but I personally can't tell the difference. You get the same dry, enjoyable sense of humor that the show always had and whatever musical changes that have been made still blend incredibly well.

I would recommend this box set to anyone who is looking for a piece of their adolescence, or looking to share it with a teenager today. I think that a lot of kids today could benefit from what Daria has to offer.",1446163200,,686,4.532258064516129

I began to start viewing Daria again recently and I am now hooked. The show is a view and a window into the late 1990's. There are not any cell phones, texting and laptops are shown on the last season. Cordless phones are big though. If you wish to feel like traveling back 19 years to before 911 this is a great vehicle. The dialog is witty, the characters are highly developed to the point of feeling like I know them personally. I really love this set and even though there are no guns, foul language, bloody injured humans and excessive violence this show is a gem.

3442157,2,B0019N8P2W,"This criticism is not so much aimed at the DVD but at the show itself. However, I am very disappointed that the original music is not used in the DVD release and it was replaced by generic garage band type music. Watching this show now has me realizing that the show was rather boring and monotonous. Daria still is a great character as well her sidekick, Jane. Daria's wit, sarcasm and braininess made her very endearing. Overall, there seemed to be something really lacking in the show that would make past viewers and new viewers lose interest fast. The DVD doesn't really offer much in the way of interviews or any behind the scenes, making of or anything like that.

Furthermore, the show really hasn't aged well. It's one of those shows that was great when it came out but seems rather stale and dated. On top of that, the square and minimal animation got very low scale as the series progressed. The one good thing about this show is that it was one of the last shows that did not cater to the lowest denominator as seen on MTV now.",1444953600,,1039,4.439790575916231

3442187,5,B0019N8P2W,"You know those people who criticize girls who like overly feminine stuff like make-up and clothes and treat them like they are less of a person because if it? Unfortunately this show does kind of falls into that several times over the course of the series. Which sucks because Daria and Jane are hilarious, but this show would definitely be less funny if it were real life.
Fortunately, it is just a show. So it is easy to fall right into place with Daria and Jane and laugh about all the clueless and brainless fellow classmates, parents and just about everyone else in town. Most of the time, what Daria has to say is funny, honest and totally spot-on. Her unenthused tone and lack of interest in the life around her are iconic for good reason.",1437004800,,746,4.492647058823529

If your looking at this review after Daria went off amazon instant prime, then you must get this DVD set! It is way cheaper then buying all the seasons on instant video if you already have prime. Plus you also get the two movies included and the ORIGINAL pilot episode which was never on instant prime to begin with. It takes no effort changing out disks! I know we have all become used to just switching shows with the controller, but this is still a must have for the price and switching out Disks doesn't take that much effort. Stop being lazy and get this set already :D You save tons of money and you have it without the worry of it going off amazon instant video :D",1435881600,,756,4.368794326241135

Enough background music remains so that it's not like animated Antonioni.  20 minute programs, each a gem.  Daria is a great character as is her cohort Jane.

3442201,5,B0019N8P2W,"Sharply sardonic and seriously sarcastic, this series's take on high school is satire at its best.  A spinoff -- or spinout -- from a Beavis and Butthead episode, Daria follows Daria Morgendorffer (I love the names, the American equivalent of Dickens that) as she navigates her way through high school with a sharply sardonic sense of wry humor and a cynical attitude, which does, on occasion, get broken by the promise of normalcy and romance (the series never lets you forget that she is a teenager, after all). And this set contains all the brilliance I came to spend hours laughing out loud at.

With its witty and pointedly observant dialogue, this is funny funny stuff, and well worth the purchase, should it still be available.",1431820800,,734,4.817460317460317

The only problem I have is that the original music isn't on this dvd. The show's creator has an reasonable explanation for this, copyright issues. The new music fits the show.

3442330,5,B0019N8P2W,"Daria, to those unfamiliar with this series, it's hilarious and, despite it being very old, still relevant. To those who are familiar, I'll just explain a bit about the boxed set. The main concern I had with it before I purchased it was the music being changed. I'm happy to say, I only noticed once that the music was changed, and that's because they were talking about the song on the radio which, instead of being an REM song, was just some random background music. Sure, none of your favorite 90's bands will be heard anymore, but that wasn't what made Daria the smartest and one of the funniest shows on tv. The most important music, the original stuff, is all still there. Including the musical episode, Daria!, the intro song, and anything Mystik Spiral did. So yeah, that's about it. The music is altered but fine. The laughs are constant. Daria's cutting wit and cynicism is as wonderful as ever. And I couldn't be happier with my purchase.",1414713600,,949,4.621301775147929

3442393,5,B0019N8P2W,"There are some shows that you enjoy watching when you're younger and when you see it again as an adult you are left disappointed, almost wishing you hadn't watched it at all so that you can preserve the memory. So, while I loved watching Pete and Pete back when I was between the ages of 12-16 or so, I was skeptical again watching it as an adult. However, nostalgia got the best of me and I ordered these.

This show has stood the test of time.

It is even more enjoyable to me now than when I was in high school. The social commentary and issues faced by Daria are every bit as relevant today as they were 17 years ago when the show first aired in 1997. The dialogue is sharp and witty, the characters genuinely funny, and the apathetic way Daria approaches life is more relevant to me as I approach 30 than it was when I was 15.

In terms of packaging, it's a basic hard black case that holds 8 discs, spanning 5 seasons. The discs all hold approximately the same number of episodes so multiple seasons may be present on a single disc. This was fine to me because I prefer to binge watch these anyway so the fewer discs I have to change the better. Having it all in one compact set works for me too, less space to take up on my shelf.

Additionally, as noted you won't be getting the original music from the show when you buy this. Apparently the only reason Daria took so long to be released on DVD is that the music in the show was too expensive to feasibly include on the set. Extras are sparse but the two Daria movies are included. And you really cannot beat the price, Amazon typically sells this forr under $20 - so 5 seasons of Daria for under $20? You really can't go wrong.",1400025600,2,1686,4.194444444444445

I can't help but wonder what teens today would think about this show, but for me I'm so glad I have it in my collection.

It's a shame, because some of the music was key to the action going on in the program (i.e. the parody of REM's ""Everybody Hurts"" video completely falls flat without the actual song in place).

You certainly won't hear me complaining. Sometimes things just have to be done.

3442471,5,B0019N8P2W,"Daria is an amazing show that is intriguing for several reasons. Her show is a spinoff from Beavis and Butthead which was more popular than this one. With that said, this show is orders of magnitude more deserving. It stars a seemingly emotionally detached teen in a world full of double standards and sick sad world episodes. The characters in the show are well scripted and well developed. I would have liked to see more episodes and its a shame that the music is cut out of this show. It does take away from the whole ""this show was on Mtv at a time when they played music"", but those are the wonders of contracts, lawyers and time.

I would like to see Daria back on the air. There is no reason she shouldn't be. I mean, king of the hill was on for longer. We all know there's no reason for that. There's potential for a college or even a working world Daria. Hopefully with the same people that wrote the first one. No sense in detracting from the great scripting material that they came up with. Furthermore, I'd be right there watching it...

When my daughter hit her teens, we rented the Daria series from Netflix and she fell in love. Two years later she was still begging us to buy her the collection, so we did. The disks worked fine and the set includes the movies as well.

While driving my two daughters to school the other day I looked in the rearview mirror and saw my blond step-daughter bobbing her head to her ipod and my brunette daughter in her grey jacket & glasses scowling. Then looked at myself on my way to an office job and thought of my husband being goofy.

3442482,5,B0019N8P2W,"Oh, Daria, how I love thee. You are as keen as cats and ribald as rats. With your soft blowing brown hair and glasses all 'aharried. Your green jacket so thin and your skirt all 'aruffle, you are indeed a little charmer.

I love this show. I can't even begin to say what it would have meant to me to have even known a character like this existed when I went to high school, starting in late 2002. Let's just say it might have meant the difference between outright depression and isolation and perhaps overall acceptance of my situation. But that's not the show's fault, that's TV's fault for all but disappearing the show after it ended. Apparently it was on logo or nogin from time to time throughout the years, but I never really watched those channels way up on the cable channel counter. I remember watching MTV throughout those years but it was always Celebrity Team Death Match or Jackass. A part of me is sad that I didn't at least catch a glimpse of this show when it might have still been on. I was just a dumb boy who liked violence like every other dumb boy.

I only finally even knew about the show when the DVD came out, and my, what an impact it did make. I know everyone says this, but I WAS Daria in high school. I realized I had a sight problem early in my Sophomore year, so I had to get glasses and wear them all the time for the first time in my life. I didn't know anything about athletics and was overweight (since fixed with constant exercise, which no one tells you about when you're in high school unless you're already naturally inclined or forced by your parents to be on a sports team) and really looked a drag, I'm sure. I wasn't bullied or anything, just sort of left in the ionosphere, ignored. My only truly difficult year was probably my Senior year, when the cliques were at their greatest maturation and ripeness, and I was doing all the core classes I never wanted to do because I had only taken art classes instead in my freshman year. I remember I was in a certain club that had changed since the last year into an extremely anal experience because the teacher wanted to win awards and accolades. Ok, it was yearbook, and it was awful. A lot of the departments received extra funding and this created new expectations.

I was also on drugs for ADHD, even though I now know I probably didn't really have a focus problem but rather I was just lazy. I just didn't care, never did care. I graduated college after high school, having gotten off those big pharma drugs that have the tendency to ruin your life, started exercising, cleaned myself up, and after a bout with depression caused by trying to fit in and smoke MJ with fake friends, I'm now in a much better place. I didn't want to be all personal in an Amazon review, but if there's some lonely high school student out there, I just want them to know it gets better. What Daria teaches us is screw all those people, I have my own life to live. The pressures of society don't matter, just as long as I'm doing ok.

I just can't help but remember the horrible time that high school was for me. Daria reveals all of this. The show teaches us that no one has it particularly EASY in high school, even if the popular kids go out of their way to wreck the lives of anyone who is different, which never really ends, by the way. People are dumb, stupid social animals that are, like, engineered to hate nonconformity. Those who continue their education past high school often grow to be enlightened later on though (one hopes).

We all go through some sick twisted stuff when we're going through puberty and having to deal with a million different kinds of people and social situations and grades and stress in high school, and no show ever captured this like Daria. Daria isn't exactly an amazing perfect super genius, she has faults and worries, she deals with isolation and gets help from friends and parents as she's growing up in superficial Lawndale. As I watch the show today I see how I was like Daria, and I'm very glad this show is on DVD, and within the reach of anyone who needs it. Even if we are going through it alone we can know that there's been millions of people who have been disenfranchised through an establishment of order like high school, and there's understanding. Certainly it seems the writers understood that high school wasn't all about being perky and buying the next clothing line or corporate product. High School can be REAL MISERY. I think it's important we give each other a break when we're in high school, or at least the benefit of the doubt.

If I had only had this show in 2002, I think it would have made a difference. When I watched the whole thing through two years ago it was an enormous epiphany. I realized I WASN'T alone. It was like a total moment of clarity, like a cleansing of the soul. I didn't have to carry those old memories on my back so much anymore. All I ever needed was for someone to understand. No tv show ever had that kind of impact on me. It was sort of like reading Harry Potter, the hero isn't some perfect superchampion with six pack abs, just a regular kid who got a bad deal. I guess I didn't have to hate myself anymore after Daria, I could sympathize with my old self and the difficulty of the whole High School situation. Not that running a lot didn't help that too.

Finally, the music makes no difference to me. I was born too late to have ever been a big fan of that millenium music anyways. I watched a few episodes on some Russian site with the music still in and found it distracting. I listen to more than enough music on my own, I don't need MTV music propaganda hovering through the best moments of the show. Without the music the show is more timeless, I think, even if it may add context for certain key situations. I'm sure if they ever did release the show with the music intact I'd watch it just to compare, but I'd rather have all the episodes in good picture quality than anything else.

Also, the first season or so is where it's really at. The show had already begun a slow fade after season three. The 2000s would not be kind to the ideals of Daria. I watch these episodes from '97 and 2000 and I think, wow, what a bunch of complainers! haha! Most of us young people don't even have the opportunity to work anymore, we can't even get full time jobs! There'll be a line of dialogue and I'll be like, oh, just wait until Bush gets into office! Then you'll REALLY be depressed! In fact the whole Lane family is living on the street in 2013. There's hardly any Time magazine or National Geographic paying huge sums for Celtic Rock formation photos anymore, or consumer money to pay for bad pottery or paintings. Daria is completely the product of an American economy that was actually working for all the people, the intellectuals, the scientists, the creative types, rather than just the business executives. Jodie and her family would be doing great. I don't even want to think about Kevin and Brittany, although I think they might have gotten tons of work in the superficial Bush Era 2000s.

America is such a screwed up nation now compared to 1997, there's no time to complain about existential conundrums that were summed up so well on the show Seinfeld and Daria as well. It's hard just to keep a job now! I watch this show and I think, lucky b@$#%&^!, I'd a' had my 401k set up by the crisis in 2008! Course then it would have just been wiped out. They had no idea all the crap that was coming down the pipe by the time the show had stopped being written--probably by the end of summer 2001. I wonder if they were still writing that last movie when the towers got hit?

Daria puts me in a mood of nostalgia, as you might or might not be able to tell, a very strong sense of the past. If they were to make new episodes of this show today I think it might just be the greatest thing ever, way better than Beavis and Butthead coming back (no music videos to fart on anymore). Daria would likely have plenty to say about our modern world.

And that stuff's being said every night on the Colbert Report, which I don't watch.

Irregardless of that small difference, the set is still amazing, and long overdue. It contains all episodes, including the pilots, and the movies.
The quality of the picture and sound is amazing compared to the various ""recorded off the air"" versions which float around.

This series really caught the edge of a generation that was fed up with the status quo.  There are a lot of great moments of teen angst, the animation is simple but still makes an impact.  It's a series about what is being said versus the animators skill, so if you are more interested in substance vs flash . . . this is definately worth adding to any collection.",1369008000,,481,4.085106382978723

3442533,5,B0019N8P2W,"Wow, what can be said that hasn't already been said? This show was wonderfully entertaining fifteen years ago, and it still holds up. Looking back on it, the removal of the original music gives it the benefit of not dating itself to the late '90s, as the general ideas of being an outsider that's okay with being an outside is timeless. They kept the original theme song (easily the most identifiable song of the entire show) and while I don't remember if this was the original song at the end of season four, it certainly fit with the events that transpired.

The creators of the show do not treat the audience as idiots, which is ironic given Daria's humble beginnings in ""Beavis and Butthead"" and the sharp nosedive of MTV programming shortly after ""Daria""'s cancellation. Everyone gets called out for pretentiousness and shallowness and self-deluded BS, including Daria herself. It's also never glossed over that she does things to isolate herself from others and that she's not an innocent victim of the cruel high school life--in fact, this is the only example of teen fare in the '90s that doesn't have an antagonist.

Overall, a worthwhile addition to any collection.",1367971200,,1175,4.87

3442538,5,B0019N8P2W,"Daria was a spin-off from Beavis and Butthead. She was a brainy alter-ego to B&B. She is a cerebral, introverted young adult trying to make sense of a world that doesnt. Her and her free spirit artist friend Jane are each others life-savers. Hilarity ensues.

MTV originally produced the series with unlimited access to millions of songs but only for on-air use. They used little snippets of songs throughout the series for mood music. They were unable to release a DvD series because it was prohibitive to acquire licenses to all these little song clips. They finally redid it with different music.

3442546,4,B0019N8P2W,"Suffering through puberty during the 90's and early 00's, Daria's caustic humour and honey badger-isk attitude towards the woes of adolescence struck a cord with me.

When I discovered that the social misadventures of my favorite monotone heroine were available for purchase, I was ecstatic!  At my finger tips was the possibility of obsessively memorizing the best zingers that MTV has ever produced.  I immediately purchased the DVD box set.  It has proven to be just as lovely, poignant, sharp, and exact as I remember, even sans the original music. :(

I know, I know.  It would have been impossible to release the entire series and retain all the original music but rewatching Daria without Pink's stupid girl in the background makes me feel a little lonely.  That said, the box set is definitely worth the buy!",1364601600,,816,4.912408759124087

For anyone who somehow missed out, however: Daria is in one sense an episodic teen fiction just barely too wacky to have worked as live action, told instead through relatively low-budget cell animation. (It was produced in those very last years when offshored drawing was still cheaper than CGI.) In another sense, however, it's a painfully honest documentary about adolescent life in comfortably-but-still-anxious suburban middle class America in the post Cold War, pre War on Terror 1990s. If you were born between, say, 1975 and 1985, in the United States or potentially just about any prosperous ""Western"" society, AND spent any significant portion of your youth feeling like the culture surrounding you was some sort of occasionally funny but fundamentally screwed-up joke... Daria is, basically, an only-too-little-exaggerated distillation of your life on the threshold of adulthood, come back now to make you alternately laugh and squirm uncomfortably.

If I could only keep 10 works out of all the movies, TV shows, etc., in the world, this would be one of those 10. Without a second thought.",1363305600,2,1331,5.214953271028038

Yeah, it's a bummer not to hear the music exactly as I remember it, but that doesn't make the purchase a waste of money. I read the reviews before purchase, and I'm satisfied with the money spent. Definitely worth it, as the content of the show is still the same. The only edits are to the soundtrack. Hey, if you want to enjoy the music of the 90's, download the mp3s or buy the songs on CD.

It is slightly cynical and jaded but without the mean spirited tone of so many of the reality tv shows airing now. Interestingly, the one ""flaw"" cited by other reviewers did not bother me.

I dearly miss this show because the quality of the stories were so believable and helped people realize certain things like dad can cook, mom can work crazy hours, and ultimately, women can be intelligent and strong. We need more programming like this--especially nowadays. You don't see many strong female roles on Mtv anymore in any of their shows. It is such a shame. It almost seems as though someone took over the television station and destroyed everything it had going for it in the early 1990s to later 1990s :(

It contains all the seasons and episodes of Daria that we've yearned for for years as well as the two movies. This Beavis & Butthead spin-off was one of the best shows on MTV back when it actually played music. Television networks like LOGO, Teen Nick, etc. would tease us by randomly airing one or two episodes of Daria, but this set allows me to enjoy every minute of Daria's wit and sarcasm. The only downside is that because of licensing purposes the collection does not contain any of the original music which was a big part of the show. The music in Daria was a time capsule into the late 90's and early 00's and without it this product is almost perfect. Nevertheless, I'm grateful that this product is finally available and the note explaining the absence of music in this series is quite humorous. i purchased this when it was first available and was given a price adjustment when the price was lowered shortly after I purchased it.

This show was refreshing to watch because it portrayed a young woman, who was intelligent and didn't follow the trends.  She was and is an individual, something that I am.  She and I are very similar in our personalities as well.  In part, I enjoyed the witty humor, not like a lot of the shows today.  I wish they would bring back Daria as an adult because I would have loved to seen how she would have turned out.

3442627,5,B0019N8P2W,"There's isn't much to say about this DVD collection when it comes to someone who already knows about it or even has the collection themselves, so I'll just explain it to someone who has never even heard about this show, which will be most of the people on here.

First off, this show was first aired back on TV in 1997 on MTV, ran for five seasons and two movies (one ending season four and the last ending season five) and went off-air in 2002, just about the same time MTV decided to close down their animation department. This show is basically a spin-off series of another MTV show called ""Beavis and Butt-Head"", where our star character, Daria was a supporting role in. After a few seasons of B&B aired, the creator Mike Judge asked one of the writers who basically invented Daria's character (who's name is Glenn Eichler), to created another show staring everyone's favorite cynic.

This collection has all of the episodes in fantastic DVD quality with letterbox screen ratio. Only thing it lacks is the nostalgia factor of this show, which is the music during some scene cuts and transitions. This show, back when it was still on TV, had its moments where it'll play songs that were popular back in the mid to late 90s, from 311 and The Offspring to Korn and Rammstein. There is a little note where the creator, Glenn talked about why the music is not in the DVD release of this show and I (and hopefully everyone else) understand why they had to cut out the music bits and why it's been replaced with generic music cues. Costs for licensing would of been a fortune, making this DVD release impossible to achieve. The only exception is the original theme song, played by the all-female rock group, Splendora, that plays during the beginning of each episode.

When this show was still on TV, I was only about 6 years old and only saw bits a pieces of it when my eldest brother watched it. It didn't really click with me since I was too young to understand its message, so I skipped out on it. Boy, did I really miss out. This is basically a show about a very intelligent and cynical girl that's just trying to make it through High School without any social interaction, but life's never fair for anyone, including Daria. It seems in almost every episode, she's usually forced to do something she's not proud to do, makes her seem hypocritical, or just stick out, which is something she doesn't like to do. For the message it displays, all this show is tell us is no matter what era you're from, High School will always be the same for everyone; nothing will be different. You have all of your typical groups: the jocks, the nerds, the geeks, then you have Daria (along with her only true friend Jane).

This is a great show and I would highly suggest it to anyone who would like to watch something mellow, but still have a laugh. One thing I should warn is that the humor placed in this facade of a cartoon is quite dry. It's that type of comedy that's only funny when you think about what the punchline was about.",1334966400,,3020,4.475499092558984
3442628,4,B0019N8P2W,"The Daria shows are timeless and fun. High School sucks at any age. Old hardcore fans like me will notice that the music has changed.

(Especially since the artists themselves wouldn't be making that much off of the royalties, but I digress.) Like another reviewer said, I wish they'd sprung for R.E.M.'s Everybody Hurts in the one scene- most function pretty well with the new music, but, well, everybody hurts without the proper music in that scene in particular.

That being said, while the music definitely shaped Daria as a show, the show does a great job of standing on its own. I'm really glad I bought the box set because I will watch this over and over again.

Not just the episodes but also parts of the episodes are out of order. I'd select one episode and it would start playing a complete different episode. Or when the right episode was finally selected it would sometimes start in the middle or after an episode actually played correctly after the credits it would restart back in the middle.

A spin off of the Beavis and Butthead series it takes the butt of much of their distain and turns her into an amazingly deep character that embodies the epitome of American youthful ambivalence. The supporting cast of characters is richly developed, and unusually for a series like this, the adults get equal time in the stories. Another wonderful feature of this series is the fact that it actually has an end to it that is both heartwarming and thoughtful. In the end, this is not a series just for teen age girls. It is a universal form of entertainment with enough verite and humor to be appreciated by all sexes and all ages. Ahh, the kids in America.",1327968000,,875,4.475
3442644,4,B0019N8P2W,"First off, i really like Daria and i didn't think there would be anything that could make me not love this. I just got it in the mail today, so i haven't gone through all the disks but as i was peeling off the cellophane the case cracked.

I was so devastated! i'd read other reviews in which people talk about their cases breaking but i sat back and thought "" they must not be careful with their stuff, there's no way i'll ever break mine!"" Wrong. it broke before i even got the damn plastic wrap off. the plastic is super thin and cheap which kind of hurts my feelings. there are better built cases at the dollar tree :[

next, the thing most people are talking about is of course the music changes. alot of people are saying that their letter telling them the music had been changed was located inside of the sealed jewel case, however mine was located on the back cover of the case, slipped in round of the case cover insert. It was clearly visible as soon as you look on the back of the case. it wasn't a rude letter either as other people made it out to be. It was just kinda funny and explained that there was no way i hell that they could get all of the licensing in order for ever music clip in all 5 seasons. -shrug-

now to the inside of the case!
The case is made of a thin, cheap, clear plastic that has 3 pages each that hold 2 disks. im not gonna lie the construction of the case was crappier than i ever imagined.
The disks themselves each have pics of daria characters on them.
there  is no insert inside of the case. no episode guide or anything, but i expected that.
The episodes themselves are still totally kick ass even without the original music and in most episodes you won't even really notice for a while, and once do start to notice, it's a little hard to care. the show is great no matter what theyve dubbed the scene transitions with.
none of the cons for buying this even come close to outweighing the pros.",1327622400,,1937,4.198924731182796

3442646,4,B0019N8P2W,"MTV obviously made compromises to release this DVD set. As everyone knows, the original music is replaced by generic songs, and the 2 movies are the abbreviated versions that were designed to air as reruns on MTV. With that being said, I'm not going to argue whether or not MTV should have tried harder with this release. The fact is, it's a show that's been off the air for a decade that was never as mainstream as say, South Park, The Simpsons, or Family Guy. As fans we are lucky to finally have something of high quality, instead of the poor quality VHS rips or Censored-for-content ""The N"" versions that have been floating around on the internet for years.

The lack of the original music is disappointing - as someone who watched the originals when it was on MTV, and then watched the modified versions on this DVD set, I do notice the difference. The music did help pull the viewer in to a Late 90's/Early 2000's timeline. But, they honestly didn't do a horrible job with the replacement generic music, and new fans to the show would probably not even be aware of the change unless they did some research on the fan sites. As a compromise, go to a website like ""Outpost Daria"" and pull up the song lists from each episode and make a custom ""Daria"" playlist to listen to before or after watching the show.

With regards to the actual DVD release: The disc case seems a bit poorly made. The front plastic cover came a bit warped, causing the cover artwork to look distorted. Not a huge deal, because most of the time this is going to sit on the shelf wedged in between a bunch of other DVDs. The extra content is nice, although a bit minimal. It would have been nice to see more from the behind-the-scenes production of the show. But back in 1997 I doubt the staff even considered that some day people would be interested in seeing them work their day to day job on a bonus section of a video disc.

The only major problem I have with this release, is that the 2 movies are located on the last disc under extras. If you watch the series straight through, you will miss out on watching the movies in the proper order. The first movie, ""Is it Fall Yet?"" should be watched after the episode ""Dye! Dye! My Darling.""  The last movie, ""Is It College Yet?"" should be watched after the last episode of the series, ""Boxing Daria."" Even if they couldn't find a way around needing to squeeze the two movies on the last disc under extras, they should have at least included some type of note or warning for viewers who want to watch the series in order.

All in all, Daria was a great show that truly was unique, if not misunderstood by many. Despite the flaws of this DVD release, I feel that any fan of the show, whether new or old, should pick up a copy. And who knows - maybe in another ten years the music industry will have changed enough where the episodes with the original music can be re-released. I doubt MTV would pass up an opportunity to sell it to us again!",1326844800,,2965,4.364130434782608

I watched it several times with the original music and once now with the new music and I barely noticed the difference.  It's just SUCH a minor thing that isn't worth complaining about at all.

Now, as for the series itself, well, it's brilliant.  If you're even looking at this page, you probably already know that.  I won't go into excessive detail about the characters and the settings and the dark humor and the real issues explored.  It's all there.  It's all amazing.  The DVD set is very simple, there are no extras really, except for the two movies Is It Fall Yet and Is It College Yet, which should really be considered part of the series proper rather than ""extras.""

To me, while the music was awesome and really just underlined what Daria was as a series, it's not a deal breaker. I love these DVDs almost as much as if the music had been there - the characters, humor, and funny plot lines are still there and definitely worth a second, third, and fourth watch. This is one of the all-time greatest things that ever came from MTV, and if there were more series like this one aired on TV today, I'd probably watch a lot more.

As it is, I'll deal with it by putting on some Daria when the world just becomes too annoying - this was the first show that taught me that it's okay being different; it's even preferable, even if it is hard sometimes.

3442656,5,B0019N8P2W,"What perfect timing for the Daria series to come out during the late-1990s.  The show begun during an important time when preteen & teen girls who were emboding their 'girl power' thanks to the Spice Girls and flocked to one of tv's greatest heroines in Buffy.  I will admit when this first came on MTV, I didn't have the same level of appreciation for it like I do now.  I love the Daria and Jane characters, because I see a lot of them within myself.  As for the best seasons, hands down the honor goes to Seasons 2 & 4.  Those seasons were clever, very well written and believeable.  As for my least favorite episode of the series that went to 'Depth Takes a Holiday' and best episode 'Write Where It Hurts.'

The combo movie editions were great adds to the disc set -- 'Is It Fall Yet' starts to show the growth and maturity of Quinn.  I loved how the writers never forgot episode 1's question from the History course on Daria's first day at Lawndale, ""Can anyone explain Manifest Destiny?"" and brought it back to use for Quinn.  Such a smart move by the writers if you ask me!

The disc set, does not contain the original music used for each episode.  Though that might be a slight bummer it still shouldn't reframe anyone from purchasing. I will always cherish this series and probably one of the last great things by MTV before they started going reality show crazy.",1321920000,,1373,4.430278884462151

Like Daria and Quinn this show was the polar opposite of B&B. While I would love to argue that bringing back that stupid show should be balanced by bringing Daria back, I can't see how MTV could reprise this kind of quality writing.  It would be relatively easy to do stupid, but Daria was smart, snarky and sooooo hot...",1321228800,,558,4.46078431372549
3442659,4,B0019N8P2W,I used to watch Daria growing up and I love the series. There's so many episodes on each disc and the movies are even included. I got this for a great price and wish the show would come back to MTV.,1320451200,,198,3.8536585365853657
3442660,5,B0019N8P2W,"I'd like to start off by saying that I never saw Daria when it aired on TV. When I found out that the girl from Beavis and Butthead got a spin off I decided to check out the show (illegally) online. I then decided to purchase (after realizing I couldn't watch the entire series on YouTube) this box set. After watching the whole series I'm very glad that I did. Daria is now one of my favorite shows of all time. It's smart, witty and, very funny. If you don't already know, the series is about a teenaged girl named Daria and her life throughout high School. Of course this has been done before, but what makes this show special are the characters. The title character is truly unique. I honestly believe that there will never be another main character like Daria; she's smart, very sarcastic, and funny. After watching the entire series I know that I will be quoting her for the rest of my life and you will too.  The rest of the cast is not as unique as Daria, but they still bring a lot humor to the series. There is Jane (Daria's artistic friend), Quinn (Daria's shallow sister), Kevin (dumb Jock), Upchuck (pervert), Mack (Black guy), Jake (Daria's manic father) and the list goes on. The comedy comes from putting the characters through everyday situations and just having them be themselves .Truly the work of very talented writers.  A huge benefit of owning the entire series is that you can watch the show in rapid succession and you will be able to see the great deal of character development that goes on over the course of the entire series very clearly. Almost all the charters in Daria mature and change throughout the series in very realistic ways, something that isn't done in many shows that I watch nowadays. The last reason that I'm recommending this DVD box set is that even though the show is no longer on the air its themes are still relevant to this day. Even though the show will have you laughing through every episode, it still deals with things that every teenager, including myself, deals with.  Sex, morality, and questioning one's own existence are the themes of certain episodes and these episodes happen to be my favorite ones because of how well the subject matter is handled. It is fair to say that any teenager will be able to relate with Daria in some way. I know I did. Until know I have only been talking about series itself, but now I will talk about the actual box set.  All 65 episodes are here with the 2 TV movies and some extras. The actual box is very simple with very simple artwork on the front and back and only a note from Glenn Eichler, the series creator, inside the box.  The extras are not much,but were fun to look at. You get original character sketches, the unaired pilot episode (my favorite extra), and a music video from one of the shows characters.  My biggest problems with the box set are actually about 2 of the extra features.  My first problem was that both of the TV movies are a part of the extra features and not a part of the main feature. Since there is not an episode list included with the box set, I had no idea were too chronologically place the movies in the Daria time line. Thankfully I was able to find episode guides online, but it still annoyed me. The other problem I had was with this one extra feature that has Daria and Jane counting down the top 10 animated music videos of all time. For some reason they skip the music videos after Daria and Jane introduce them. Why couldn't MTV include the videos? There were 11 music videos on the Beavis and Butthead Box set and there were 3 of those and in my opinion Daria in a better show.  Anyway, to fix this all you need to do is watch the extra feature on your computer, wait until they introduce the music video, pause it then look up the video on YouTube. I know that it's a hassle, but Daria and Jane's introductions are as smart and funny as anything that they say on the show plus the music is good (oasis!!!).  The final thing that I would like to bring up about the box set is about the music used in the show. I know that many long time Daria fans complain that the box set doesn't use the original music that the show used when it aired on MTV due to legal issues. For people that don't know when Daria aired on MTV it used licensed music from various popular artists for transition and background music, so that means that the box set had to use generic stock music instead because of the cost of home distribution licensing. From what I have read the show was better with the original music but I don't have opinion on the matter, I never got the chance to hear the difference (I didn't even know about the whole music issue until I read the note inside the box) so it doesn't bother me one bit.

Final thoughts

The show 5/5
It's smart, witty, and very funny. I don't think there ever was or will ever be a TV show like Daria, truly one of a kind. I understand that it might not be for everybody, so watch an episode online and if you like it you will LOVE the 24 hours of teenage angst that are in this box set

The Box set itself 4.5/5
Could have done better and it did annoy me a little with the extras, but it gets the job done very well.

Afterthoughts
Why doesn't MTV air any reruns. I would really enjoy watching the show with the original music. Do we really need all of those"" reality"" shows? I know I'm willing to replace any one of them with 9 year old episodes of Daria. Any daria fan would agree with me right?

This was a must have for me because living in Australia at the tie of purchase this was a Region 1 exclusive, funnily enough though not long after purchasing this Daria came out in Australia ""region 4"" and which I promptly purchased again due to DVD restrictions. This set is excellent value containing all of the episodes and two movies, though the first movie is it Fall Yet should have been place in chronological order rather then on the last disc due to a bit of a story lapse if it is watched at the end. A little lacking in special features but this hardly bothers me. The Case it comes in is also much better then the region 4 release, it is done as a booklet rather then over here where 3 discs are slotted into the same page. I preffered this so much that I swtiched the cases for my region 4 discs.

Daria is a terrific show and although Darias droning voice can get a little irritating at times the stories, the characters and the mature themes really do make it a special show.",1317254400,,1183,4.328828828828829
3442674,4,B0019N8P2W,"Daria originally debuted when I myself was a freshman or sophmore in high-school, and I was a bit anti-social like her and had a rather annoying, oscial butterfly of a younger sister, which is probably why I loved the show as much as I did. Which is why I was so excited when I saw the complete series was available on DVD.

If you aren't familiar with this show, it's a spin-off from Beavis and Butthead that aired on MTV in the late 90s/early 00s and features the high-school adventures of a cycnical, sarcastic, witty, monotone teenager named Daria. Other characters include her vapid younger sister, Quinn, her artistic best-friend, Jane, and all of the other stereotypical teenagers she attends school with.

While other reviews have complained about the fact that 99% of the music had been changed, it has been so long since I've watched any of the episodes, I wouldn't have noticed the difference anyway. What I DO wish was included was a booklet with the episode titles and a brief synopsis. I mean, if there is one episode in particular I want to watch, I have to do some online searching to figure out when in the series it happened, versus just opening up a little booklet included with the DVD.

My two major complaints of this set is that it the ""Is It College Yet?"" movie in this set is the oxymoron DVD release version that has been edited down by at least 10 minutes, instead of an original aired version that had its music altered (seems just plain lazy to me); and the set could have used more special features. The special features that are there are very enjoyable; all in all, this is a nice trip down memory lane for old Daria fan and an excellent way for any new fans to get into the series.",1316476800,,643,4.278688524590164

3442687,5,B0019N8P2W,"One of the MOST underrated animated television series of all time in the history of american animation(and probably international animation.) From what I read, even though it received generally positive reviews from so called professional media critics and generally positive reviews from general audiences, it received no awards  for its sharp witty  writing, its , animation quality, the voice acting and many other animation subcategories that animated shows are usually nominated for, Despite being on a mainstream channel and despite how hugely popular the show was , even during the last final seasons of the show. So many other animated shows have received emmy awards and other  animation awards despite the poor animation quality , and the poor writing in the animated show , and just overall lacking in orginality.(Family Guy instantly comes to mind) . Daria was truly one of a kind and it is a damn shame that this show is not getting the level of recognition that it truly deserves.

Echohing the air of cynicism that is often associated with generation-x culture and the grunge/riot girl culture of the early to mid 90's , the show Daria premiered in the late 90's during a time when boy bands and pop princess singers were reaching  toward the height of their popularity and when the grunge culture/riot girl culture often associated with the music subculture of generation-x, was declining in but ,apparently it still had a sizeable audience that the MTV execs thought it was worth the investment in the show. Because you know, they are all about quality programming as long as it they have a wide general audience.

The character Daria is an introverted , cynical intelligent teenager , who has cynicism that is so sharp, I suspect that it can cut through Wolverine adamantium anatomy :) who doesn't change anything about her personality and who is practically comfortable in her own skin, despite outside pressures placed on her directly(her mother persuading her to associate with more popular students) and the people in her environment that cover larger surroundings she does not indirectly interact with.  She is also an aspiring writer who is into writing short stories . She doesn't start to manifest her , ""inner demons"" for a lack of an appropriate word until season 5 in the episode Boxing Daria, that explains the root causes of why she is so anti-social  . She has a partner in crime name Jane lane who she meets at Lawndale high school in her self-esteem class,  who also shares her level of cynicism and who is an aspiring artist  but is a tadbit more social than Daria(initially firsts one of the two to have a boyfriends, joins the track team,  contemplates becoming a cheerleader) , but at the end of the day, she marches to her own drum, just like Daria.

A spin off of Beavis and Butthead, Daria and her family moved to Lawndale at a generic high school. Beavis and Butthead isn't referenced directly at all in this show and the indirect references that they receive are VERY subtle , that the audience will not understand the references unless they previously watched Beavis and Butthead. She has a mother who is a lawyer who is obsessed with work but who tries to keep tabs on both of her daughters lives despite doing a poor job of it, and a father name Jake who is kinda neurotic , and barely seemingly doesn't know whats going on in their family affairs half the time who recollects past events of his father perpetuating abuse on him as a child at military school.  Then when have her seemingly self-absorbed , fashion obsessed, boy crazy sister quinn who feels she is forced to had her real intelligence and portrays herself to be less intelligence than she actually is because of deep seated insecurity issues and her low self esteem. She secretly doesn't like the crowd she chose to associate with, and  has confessed that her ""friends"" vapid and shallow on a few occassions, for the sake of maintaining her popularity status and conformity for her own survival sake.

There are a menagerie of other wonderful characters that are both exaggerated high school stereotypes, and who don't really fit any high school stereotypes that I won't go into depth about, not because they are not important or interesting, but I want to cover more points about the series before I hit Amazon's word limit:)

When I first watch Daria at age 14, I really haven't seen any tv show like it before(nor have I really seen a show like it since)  and was instantly hooked. Its  refreshing to see a main  character in a teenage oriented television series who isn't obsessed with being popular or who are popular mary sue type characters who are perfect at everything with everyone in every situation they are in.  Its also very refreshing to see main characters not be in a  relationship with a different character every week or the plot center around JUST around sex and the dynamics of that relationship or in Daria's fortunate case, not centered around boyfriend/girlfriend relationships very little(meaning , not most of the time.) . Yes, Daria had a crush , and she didn't formally acquire a boyfriend until the last season ,  but that wasn't the main focus of the show. The main focus of the show was seeing how daria perceived the chaotic world around her, and the personality of an introvert like daria, and how the people in her surroundings perceived her and her continuing development as the seasons of the show progress.

Just as Daria was an oasis in her town and at her high school amidst a sea of what she perceived as cultural decadence and mindless conformity, the series daria is the oasis of teen oriented shows. It is now 2011 and I started watching this show in 2002 , and it has aged very well for me and I would consider buying the DVD , if they had the original music on the show and I wasn't such a slave to free stuff. MTV has seemingly completely eliminated all programming targeted towards the small  counter culture audience they had and replaced it with mind evaporating tv programming , that ironically would have been satirized on Daria. It would be like some of the characters foils on Daria getting their own spin off shows for MTV's current programming.

Would love to see the show be resurrected, and see how Daria would operate in a social setting in a corporate controlled environment.",1309564800,2,6345,4.767335766423358

3442690,5,B0019N8P2W,"Daria is a show which revolves around a sarcastic and somewhat cynical look at teenage life.  It also provides witty commentary about how the generalizations and stereotypes that surround teenage life also extend past it into adult life.  Daria uses a deadpan voice to deliver the punchlines that we were all thinking, resulting in smart comedy that requires... well ... thought.  Frankly the comedy of modern times relies on shock value and random cut away scenes unrealated to plot for a quick, non-sensical laugh, sort of like a court-jester.  Daria will challenge you to see the things in your own daily life in a different light as well, and perhaps will provide you with a coping mechanism for tough days at work or school.

Some will complain that the MTV music from the 90's is removed, but I don't think that was the point of the show's production in the first place, so I enjoyed the show anyway.  Five Stars!",1308528000,,919,4.7125

Every episode is great, I love Daria's and Jane's sense of humor.

I didn't mind the lack of licensed music in the series with the exception of two.  In the episode ""Road Worrier"" the replacement of REM's song ""Everybody Hurts"" just doesn't find the scene when they're in a traffic jam similar to the music video for ""Everybody Hurts"".

The same can be said for the episode ""Quinn the brain"" where the song that replaced ""What do you want from me"" didn't fit.  The original song was perfect to convey Daria's feeling of losing her identity for being a brain to Quinn who manages to be a popular brain.  This plays while Daria is about to give Quinn a taste of her own medicine as Daria has a montage of changing into an similar to Quinn's normal look.

Aside from these two scenes this was a perfect collection of a hilarious series.",1308441600,,935,4.432748538011696

I've missed this show soooo much. Granted I was the kid who got yelled at for hanging out with 'weird' kids. And for reading books outside of reading group.  Or correcting the teacher's poor grammer.
 It was nice to have someone to look up to who was remotely my age instead of like.... some.. QUINN type, or an older woman. I had a teenage girl who I identified with for once.. and that was important.",1307059200,,553,4.247619047619048

Maybe that's important to some people but definitely not me.  I graduated from high school in 1979 and I just can't empathize with being that invested in 1990s pop music context.

Most significantly, there was a ""bootleg"" Daria set several years ago that had all original music, but in that set the video and audio quality was uneven and at times really bad, there was no ""Play All"" option, and above all I'm sure there weren't any royalties that made it back to the series creators.

3442698,5,B0019N8P2W,"I'm so glad this came out on DVD. I was convinced that Daria was lost forever.

Okay, actually I didn't really think about Daria until I heard about this set. Then I remembered how much I loved the show and I decided to pick it up. Daria was the girl I always wanted to be when I was in high school - her own person, and willing to have no friends rather than bad friends. I was a bit less self-assured as a teenager, but Daria was my hero.

And now I get to relive it all! All five seasons are in this set, as well as the two movies - though watching them, they come off more like extra-long episodes, which I thought was great. The second movie, ""Is It College Yet?"" gives a very nice ending to the series with great opportunities for Daria and Jane.

As some people may have heard: no, the original music is not in this set. Now, I don't remember much of the original music, aside from the opening theme song - and thank god they kept that - so it doesn't bother me too much. Even if you didn't read the insert (the full explanation is there) you can kinda tell when you watch it. The music just has a more contemporary feel to it, while the show itself is very nineties. But I don't think it messes with the flavor of the show, and if that's what the producers had to do, well...it's unfortunate, but I'm just glad it's out on DVD.",1304640000,2,1335,4.10727969348659

3442700,5,B0019N8P2W,"As you can read in other reviews posted here, there are obvious negatives with the dvd set. Be it the music changes or the lack of organization/episode guides. However, speaking personally of course, I think this dvd set is more than worthy of five stars.

A child of the early 90's, I have fond but hazy memories of staying up at night to watch Daria and I was absolutely elated when I began seeing episodes re-aired on the LOGO network this past year. My obsession with Daria and her Lawndale peers was immediately rekindled. It had never occurred to me until I began looking just how hard it was to find high quality episodes anywhere, and it appeared as if LOGO was only allotted certain episodes that I began to see multiple times. That is why I invested in this set. While yes, it is unfortunate that Viacom did replace most of the music in the series, I do have to agree with the statement on the back of the set. I am grateful just to have this collection at all. It has been long awaited and I think the few minor flaws and kinks definitely do not outweigh the major pro, which is having high quality episodes of one of MTV's best television series. And speaking from experience, this is one of the most reasonably priced television series sets that I have ever purchased.

This was based on their recollections of high school life as well as what they observed in the lives of their children today.  But what I found interesting and a bit scary is that it was relevant for me as well since it accurately reflected my own experiences in high school complete with all the various stereotypes and situations showcased in this fantastic series. So what you say? Well my high school days were back in the 60's.

Anyway I was flipping through the best buy catalog when I saw ""Daria The complete animated series"" and I got so excited to see mtv FINALLY listening to the fans. I got it the day it came out  and I'm glad I did!
Its not hard to see why it has such a cult following. Most shows and movies considered funny these days are either bathroom humor (think scary movie series) or sexual humor which has been way overdone.
Well that's surely not that case with Daria! Its clever, intelligent humor that actually makes you think. The one liners from both daria and Jane are so clever and its funny to see when they totally go over the other characters heads. Thats also where I see a minor flaw in the show.
The popular kids and even some adults are a little too stupid, for instance kevin and britney. I know they were just trying to contrast them from Daria and Jane but even so some things that say and do just aren't realistic ( unless they are ""special"" if you know what I mean).
Another thing I kinda didn't like was and the end of season 4/ beginning of season five Daria gets a boyfriend. For me giving Daria a boyfriend (not to mention she stole him from Jane) just didn't fit her outsider persona. I'm glad they didn't focus on their relationship that much. I know many fans will probably get mad at me for saying anything bad about about Daria but even if you're a fan of something it doesn't mean you love everything about it. I still think the show is an all time classic and one of the best animated series EVER so don't get me wrong. Shes the hero for all the people who felt like outcasts in school or even in life in general.",1296777600,,1829,4.240687679083095
3442716,3,B0019N8P2W,"Daria is still one of the most excellent TV show and it's a pleasure to see her again, and be able to read an episode whenever you want.

But the DVD is really minimalistic: No subtitle, which is quite problematic for a stranger like me (I'm french). I'm able to understand most of the show but the English subtitle really help when it's got to quick. I do have a dvd ZONE 1 player so the dvd zone is not a problem. But no subtitle is really problematic. I tried to use SRT subtitle with my dvd player but it won't work.
I read that the closed captioned is still on the DVD but I didn't find any player which are able to read the CC.

So the DVD features is quite cheap, and others publishers are able to do a really good jobs on DVD (I bought Samurai Jack too, there is English subtitle AND french subtitle, this is luxury!), but Daria is still gorgeously good!

She is so smart that she doesn't make friends easily, and tends to be sarcastic a lot. While the pace is low-key, the show is very funny, not only because of Daria's subtle mockery, but because of the supporting cast as well, all of whom have strong and entertaining personalities. In addition to all of this, the show is surprisingly deep, questioning not only social norms, but delving into moral dilemmas as well. While the animation is understated, (this show would probably be done in Flash today,) I cannot recommend Daria highly enough.

It was about time! I give it a thumbs up. It was good to actually watch this show episode to episode instead of catching it randomly on tv. They have changed one thing, the music. As cool as it would be to hear the grunge sounds of yester year they have replaced it with song melodies that sound kinda similar. But hey, who remembers what songs where actually playing back then anyways so not to big of deal. So all in all I do say go buy it.

As an avid fan, I was massively excited when I got the email from MTV saying they were releasing the show.  I got it as a Christmas present, and I watched all five seasons in 2 days.  It was great, being taken back to my high school years, filled with apathy and questioning things adults were saying.

The downside of course, is that the music from the episodes had been changed because they couldn't get all the copyrights.  And it's a glaring issue in some of the episodes (especially 'Pierce Me', when Daria has her daydream about Trent in the phone cord), but it didn't ruin the integrity of the DVD to me.  I am just massively happy to have the series that my friends and I loved when we were teenagers.

Getting a t shirt with the dvd set was an added bonus and I loved that it had a saying from the first episode printed on it.  I was disappointed that the dvds do not display the titles of each episode.  You only know what episodes are on each dvd after you put the dvd in and go to main menu.  Most t.v. dvd sets like The Simpsons or Family Guy feature the title and brief summary of each episode in a booklet or on the back of the dvd container. The Daria set does not. Also there is a techincal error on my last dvd where the screen is black and it sounds like a scene from a movie was recorded on it but that lasts about 30 seconds.  I love Daria but I think more thought could've gone into a better quality dvd set for the show's longtime fans.,1293062400,,839,4.0
3442727,4,B0019N8P2W,"Daria speaks for itself. If you aren't a Daria fan then you probably aren't reading this. The only drawback to this series is the lack of the original music. It's not painfully obvious, but you'll miss it where you loved it best.

3442728,5,B0019N8P2W,"the packaging could be better.  I'm not talking about the flipping system, I mean the format.  There are 8 discs, but only 5 seasons and two movies.  The seasons should have been evenly divided amongst the discs, instead you end up without an insert telling you want episodes there are and what season they belong in.  This proves most annoying after Season 4.  The Season 4 finale Dye! Dye! My Darling is the final episode before the movie Is It Fall Yet? but on the disc following that episode there are 2 other episodes from the beginning of season 5.  The movie is found in the extras section on disc 8.  So you have to a. know when to put the movie in to continue the timeline correctly and b. put the disc back in to watch 2 measly episodes before you need to change it again.

Yes the music is different and at times doesn't fit with the mood of the show, but I'll gladly take new music just to have the whole series when for awhile it looked like that wasn't going to happen.

The show is just as wonderful as it was back when it was first airing.  I've owned the series for a few months now and have watched it several times without growing tired of it.

The extras are great, especially the character evolution...the early Brittany was in obvious need of a makeover.

3442731,4,B0019N8P2W,"Watching the ""Daria"" DVDs took me back to my college days.  (I'd graduated from high school a few years before the show's premiere in 1997, but I could relate to her on so many levels.)  I thought I'd wait until I watched all eight DVDs before commenting ... and now that I've done so -- over a period of a few weeks -- here's my review:

The best part of ""Daria"" is some episodes are STILL culturally relevant -- ""Gifted"" explored what it meant to feel alienated by her fellow intellectuals, and ""Fizz Ed"" was a scathing commentary on vending machines in schools.  However, it ""jumped the shark"" with the introduction of Tom at the end of season three.  (I understand the need for conflict to maintain a storyline ... but his presence seemed contrived at best, and forced at worst.)  Daria was a loner at heart (see ""Camp Fear""), and the show was at its best when she was forced to confront her occasional bouts of hypocrisy (see ""See Jane Run"") -- besides, everyone knows her soulmate wasn't Mr. Sloane, but Holden Caulfield (LOL).

Having ""Daria"" in its entirety -- along with the special features -- is a plus, but there are a few minuses.  Unlike most fans, my biggest gripe isn't about the music ... but the lack of a booklet with information on each episode.  [...]  Also, the introductions didn't add anything to the ""Daria"" experience.  Finally, the DVD case was poorly manufactured; it broke as soon as I opened it.  (Had I paid the original price instead of waiting a few months and paying $[...], I would've been pissed!)

In closing, I'm glad to have the DVDs, for ""Daria"" mastered the art of capturing teen angst.",1291593600,,1627,4.568965517241379

I thoroughly enjoyed the series - it brings back a lot of memories. I echo the sentiments from other reviewers on amazon saying that the lack of soundtrack is disappointing - it is - but there are only a few episodes where I actually do remember the music on them. The studio music they replaced with is pretty awful - but they tried. A couple of old soundtrack songs actually made it onto the closing credits - by error or permission?

The DVD really needs an episode guide, whether it is just a running list, or a description of the episode as well. The letter from the producers about why there was no music is irrelevant after you read it - a list would be so useful for continued viewing!

The scripting is still brilliant. The oddities of Jake and the torment his childhood presents him can be so much more appreciated when you're older watching it! Helen's inherent understanding of her daughter brings it back home that its often the people we push most away understand us the best, Quinn, her relationship with Daria and her brainless friends with oddly redeeming qualities throw interesting curve balls into the series. I especially appreciate Mr Di Martino in the series, his reference to calling the union about extracurricular class allocation and leading staff on strike as part of the ""Lawndale High Teachers Union"" made me laugh - I work as a union official!

I'd rather not anaylise everything - it makes watching the series like an assignment! But thoroughly recommend it, especially for those of us who are nerds at heart!",1289606400,,1770,4.645367412140575

If you have watched this on MTV in the past you know what you are getting.  If not, this is a show about a teenage girl with a popular younger sister.  She is smart and sees most of the world around her as inane.  This doesn't have the original music, but instead has filler music in it's place.

I loved it and watched the whole box set in like a week. And having the movies is a nice touch.
The one thing you should watch out for is skipping on your disc; on a couple of my discs an episode would stop randomly as if on pause and after a few seconds would resume play. Also the video countdown thing hosted by Daria and Jane is dumb because it doesn't include the music videos.

It makes me long for the 90's, and despise the annoying and trash filled shows that are on MTV now. I guess having Morals isn't popular anymore. At least I can say I experienced the greatest show. However, despite the music being taken off, I didn't notice it too much, just particularly one scene where the replaced song didn't fit well, but anyways...

Daria will always be amazing, I'm so happy it came out on DVD. It saddens me that they won't ever revive this show again, but it has to stop somewhere.

3442743,4,B0019N8P2W,"I hadn't seen this show in nearly a decade, but thanks to the magic of DVDs (and Amazon's Gold Box special) I got the chance to relive some memories of the late 90s when this show first aired.

What's especially interesting is that this began in 1997, so it's just before every high school kid had a cell phone, iPod, and so on. It of course also predates MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, and other ""social networks."" So by that token, it actually reflects a simpler time, when kids actually still walked down hallways and spoke to each other without using a phone.

The series revolves (as you'd probably guess) around a girl named Daria Morgandorffer, who was previous seen every so often on MTV's ""Beavis and Butthead."" Only now Daria has moved to suburban Lawndale with her workaholic mom Helen, nutty father Jake, and too-perfect sister Quinn. As in any show or movie about high school, Daria is an outcast not because of any physical deformity, but because she has dark hair, glasses, and a working brain. Throughout the show's five seasons, Daria and her new artist friend Jane poke fun at high school life with its quest for popularity. Though she thinks she knows it all, Daria does sometimes still get schooled, especially once Tom enters the picture in the 4th season.

Actually the relationship with Tom was something I didn't really buy into. He's the type of guy who seems just a little too perfect, especially for an outcast like her. Mostly I think the producers just wanted to try and breathe some new life into the show, but it didn't really work for me. It was also convenient that by that point her crush on Jane's brother Trent had been completely forgotten, like the lost brother on ""Happy Days."" By the end of the 5th season it did seem like the show was kind of jumping the shark, though maybe now it's time for a big screen reboot or something. Actually I'm sure if Daria were in high school today, she'd have a lot more fodder for wry observations.

Much has been made about having to get rid of the music used in the series when it first aired because of the licensing fees. I really don't remember the show that well that I could remember what songs were used in the first place, so it didn't bother me much. Although in the paintball one, didn't they use Barber's ""Adagio for Strings?"" That's one I do remember, or think I do. I would have thought by now that would have passed into public domain, but maybe not.

Anyway, my favorite episode has always been the one where Daria's English teacher the wimpy Mr. O'Neil challenges her to write a story that involves a deck of cards. As something of a writer myself, I really empathized with that episode.

As someone who not only writes but was a misfit in high school, I identified a lot with Daria, which is probably why I enjoyed this so much. It was good to remember this treasure from days gone by. That it includes both movies, and the original 5-minute pilot (featuring a far more vindictive version of the character) makes it a must own despite the lack of music.

This is one of those shows that definitely stands the test of time. Daria's sense of humor is still perfect. The show is still an accurate depiction of high school in the 90s. The DVDs are the show as we all remember it, except some of the music is different. Within the DVD box there is a note from the creator, Glenn Eichler, in which he says that ""99 percent of the music has been changed, because the cost of licensing the many music bites we used would have made it impossible to release the collection (and for many years did).""

Each DVD has a couple different characters printed on them. So it all looks really nice, like someone took the time to make this package presentable. My girlfriend has the Gilmore Girls Boxed set and the packaging is tacky/gross/sloppy. Daria's is well put together and looks clean. I also have The Maxx complete series, and its obvious that it was just slapped together to make a quick buck. No liner notes, no nothing. Just a disc in a case. So, that why I had to make a big deal about the Daria packaging. It looks really nice, and someone obviously put some thought into it. (Oh did I mention I''m a designer? I pay attention to these sorts of things.)

The Menus:
The menus are also well made. The ""La-la-la-la-la""s play in the background and everything in the menu is done in the Daria style, right down to the text. It all looks amazing.

The Episodes: Every single episode is still funny, clever, well drawn, awkward... Its like being in high school in the '90s all over again. The clothes, the technology, the social commentary. It's all there.
The only thing missing, which you probably already know, is the music. Like the State, the Daria people couldn't get the rights to the songs they used in the originally aired episodes. You won't hear Rage Against the Machine, Garbage and Reel Big Fish. However, the production people did a really good job of putting very similar , in instrumentation and tone, instrumental sound bites in their place. Every now and then you'll think, ""Is that Portishead/Cyprus Hill/Smashing Pumpkins?"" Will you miss the original songs of your misspent youth? Yes. Are the episodes just as awesome with the replacement music, absolutely.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who grew up in the 90s. In fact I've already been recommending it to some friends who apparently grew up under a rock, and have never heard of this show. Get it. You will enjoy it. Every episode.",1286755200,,2054,4.7

There are very few animated shows that attempt to capture real life in a remotely intelligent way, and I haven't yet seen anyone do it more intelligently than Daria.  Sure, lots of the individual characters are dim, shallow caricatures, but that's the point; aren't most of the people you know wasting their human potential, too?  It's how Daria sees the world.

The only thing that I *don't* love is that due to royalties, I think, some of the background music has changed. There's a note explaining this in the case. In most cases, I don't even miss the songs that had been used in the series, but when the joke is about the music playing, it's a little noticeable. The only example I can think of is that in one episode, they are waiting in traffic and they're spoofing the ""Everybody Hurts"" video, but some generic music is playing. Other than that instance, however, it's not really a big deal. If you love (and miss) Daria, you'll enjoy this.",1286496000,,758,4.382978723404255

Yet, people will not buy what they cannot hear. It could have been a revival for many 90s artists to a new generation.  I suppose in the name of copyright, the powers that be want to keep the songs to themselves.

I wouldn't really mind - I don't remember any specific songs to miss, however in several episodes the music was removed and no background was added, leaving parts of episodes with odd ""white noise"" in the background instead of music or sound effects.
Also, there really aren't any bonuses in this set.  You get the episodes, the movies, and some of the episodes have intros from the MTV ""Daria Day"" marathon they held.  That's it.  No behind the scenes, no interviews, no cheesy games. I guess you do get one Mystic Spiral music video.

3442773,4,B0019N8P2W,"Daria got me through high school. I am thrilled it's on DVD! There really was nothing else like it. For the uninitiated, I can only suggest this rough comparison: if Golden Girls took place during the grunge movement in the mid-90s and starred two RiotGrrls trying their damnedest to not be consumed by conformity and mediocrity in their suburban high school. So, nothing like the Golden Girls. But if it were, Aunt Amy would totally be Sofia.

Most of the original music was changed for generic but period-appropriate stuff to keep the price down. This is the main reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. This really hurt one scene in ""Road Worrier"", in which REM's Everybody Hurts  provided 90% of the emotion. I don't know how expensive the rights to that one song were, but I doubt they'd break the bank on the DVD. Other places it was much less obvious, but it would have been sweet.

The other reason for 4 stars is the lack of guide material for this 8-disc set. I appreciated the warning note that the music had changed and why, but was hoping for a little more in the case besides the discs. It would have been great if they included at least an insert pairing episode numbers with titles; I had to make my own (props to Outpost Daria for making that easy!) to easily locate  specific episodes I wanted to watch.

The writing is excellent: Daria and Jane are high school outcasts who start a little one-dimensional, but over the course of 5 seasons grow into complete characters who show a number of sizable flaws in addition to their awesome qualities. Really, all of the student characters grow, and through pieces of the stories we get a sense for who they really are. This happens a little with the teachers, but they're not the focus of the show either. The show is uniformly hilarious, and uses black humor to balance teenage awkwardness and a few very serious moments (deciding whether to have sex, alcohol abuse).

Overall, I was really pleased with this set. It was great to be able to watch it all again, and to finally see the movies and final season. The price point is excellent for the amount of content, despite my disappointment at some of the tradeoffs made in production. I expect I'll be rewatching these episodes many times. And maybe I'll dub that part of Road Worrier so I can watch it too.",1282262400,,2324,4.547846889952153

How many shows are as smart, sarcastic and funny as Daria? How many continue to hold up and be relevant more than a decade after cancellation?

The rumors, however, are true, the music is mostly changed.  I can get over that, but it does remove some of _Daria's_ cultural situatedness.  Without the 90s soundtrack, it feels as though Lawndale could be a cartoon ""anytime/anyplace"" instead of a very important generational moment.  Overall, I got over it.  Unfortunately, my main complaints with the dvds are about the sound quality.  It's inconsistent, and the dialogue varies in volume at times.  Also, there's no episode guide included with the dvds at all.  Some kind of booklet would have been nice.  I guess they produced this one on the cheap, which helps the affordability, but I'd easily have paid $25-30 more for MTV to have been a bit more fan-conscious.

3442786,3,B0019N8P2W,"I have to say I had looked forward to this release for such a long time. I was an avid fan of Daria when I was in high school, when it originally aired. I eventually found the ripped TV episodes and was satisfied. About 6 years later here we are:

I bought this collection not knowing that the music was changed, but that I completely understand. It would have been twice as much, which I would have easily paid, but that's a moot point. What does bother me is that the quality is no different than the ripped from TV episodes. MTV/Viacom did nothing to clean anything up, or offer higher resolution, and probably didn't even use the masters from the looks of it, at least with the early seasons. The only benefit from the TV rips is that they aren't the few censored Noggin ones.

The ""extras"" are by definition extra, but they aren't any sort of extra premium content one would expect.

(This section contains Fair Use Doctrine) My biggest qualm is how the DVD tracks are put together. Since I paid for this DVD and expected to move it to my hard drive (for my own personal use), I was sorely disappointed with how Viacom wants to treat me like a criminal. Instead of a single track containing a single episode, the track includes 3-5 minutes of a few episodes, making it impossible to extract a complete episode. I was left with 22 minutes of an amalgam of 4 episodes. This gives me little incentive to stop watching my TV rips, which may sound lazy, but convenience wins when they are both of the same quality, and the TV ones also the include original music. So as to not confuse anyone, the DVDs play an episode completely, it doesn't mix anything up.

The presentation is sub-par, but for people who don't have access to the episodes, this will satisfy your Daria craving.",1279152000,3,1779,4.464615384615384

Just as funny and thought provoking as I remember - AHHH!! the young and fastidious of the M-TV generation. The box set is simple and compact with great graphics on each disc. Only a few extras such as interviews with some of the talent, pilot ""Sealed with a kick"" used to pitch the show and the two 'movies' ('Is it fall yet?' 'Is It college yet?') and Daria and Jane 'Intros' used for 'Daria Day' a day long tribute. I'm NOT big on extras, but these were 'Just Right'. My only complaint is the lack of any episode list or list of extras, there was a single insert sheet with a thank you from the creator Glenn Eichler which was blank on the other side. The only way to find out what is on the discs is to put them in to see the menus. Also the 'Daria Day' intros can only be seen if you play individual episodes and select the episode with the intro.

All that's played is either Splendora's theme or Mystick Spiral's music.  NTTAWWT, but in over 10 years couldn't MTV/Viacom have been at work getting clearances?

Two weeks later, I've viewed every single episode from every season, and every second of every extra--and I loved every moment.  The show is even better than I remembered, definitely funnier than I remembered, and infinitely more touching.  I'm astonished at how something so determined to be dry could end up wringing tears out of me, but I swear a few of these episodes did it.

All right, enough sop.  The bottom line: if you have the least inclination to purchase this box set, I'd encourage you to go for it.  I think it's worth every penny.  The animation looks more crisp, clear and colorful than ever.  (Granted, I watched these discs on a blu-ray player, but even still...)  The extras are plentiful and terrific.  And of course, the episodes themselves--the characters, the writing, the animation and the delivery of every actor involved--are among the best and smartest to ever come across the small screen.  Special recommendation here if there's an adolescent in your life who's brainy and maybe a bit of an outcast.  She or He will find a kindred spirit in Daria Morgendorffer.

It was also disappointing that the theme song wasn't played before every episode.  I can kind of understand some theme songs becoming a drag in the complete series or seasons of a show but Daria's theme song is one of the very few I don't get tired of hearing.

The Last disappointment was the ending to ""Is it College Yet""  Where it told you what happened to each Character.  They showed the pictures and ran the credits underneath cutting off the rest of the pictures.

3442797,4,B0019N8P2W,"This is the best we're going to get for a while, Daria fans, and this collection is definitely worth it. Yes, it is missing the music and sometimes the replacement elevator music is very noticeable. However, it doesn't detract too much from the whole experience and sometimes it's fun to guess which song they originally used. We aren't going to get a collection with the 90s music because of the cost, but they do an admirable job with their tuneless but thematically appropriate musaq.

Every episode is included on this DVD set, though the seasons are broken up somewhat oddly. The episode numbers are printed on each disc, but no episode guide is included in the case. Also, the two movies (""Is It Fall Yet?"" and ""Is It College Yet?"") are on the last disc, under Extras, then Movies. ""Is It Fall Yet?"" should be played between seasons four and five, because the dynamic between Daria, Jane and Tom changes in this 1.25 hrs long movie. It is jarring to go from four to five without it, so I suggest popping in the last disc after the episode ""Dye! Dye! My Darling!"" and then again after season five. ""Is It College Yet?"" serves as the series finale.

The extras are plentiful, but not jaw-dropping. The Daria pilot is a short, story-board affair with no frills, but it's interesting and sets the tone for the series well. The Mystik Spiral music video ""Freakin' Friends"" could probably have been done by any Daria fan on YouTube, but not bad. The ""Daria Day"" introductions to the Top 10 Animated Music Videos would have been a lot better if they included the videos themselves. The introductions are really funny, but you can't even tell which videos they're introducing sometimes (like number one!). The Mystik Spiral spin-off pilot script was interesting for someone like me, but I'm not sure how many people will take the time to read it. You have to use your computer to access it. The interviews are a bit short on interesting stories. You can look at certain characters' original designs in the Character Profiles section, which is really interesting. Britney went through many versions, as did Trent and Mr. DeMartino, I believe.

If you're a hardcore Daria fan, you're probably going to buy this after a decade of waiting, no matter what reviewers say. If you vaguely remember liking it or have never seen it, I strongly urge you to buy this set. The jokes stand up, the characters are still memorable and hilarious, the heart of the show is still beating strong. It may not seem as edgy a decade out, but it celebrates not just teenage cynicism of the nineties, but also champions honesty, intelligence, wit, independence, originality and friendship. Dumb characters such as Britney & Kevin and Quinn & her Fashion Club give Daria, Jane and Tom targets for their sharp wits, but are also carry subplots superbly and deliver one-liners brilliantly. This series may be an icon of the late nineties, but it's still relevant and still hilarious!",1277942400,2,2953,4.763671875

I have had a home made DVD collection for a while now and was so excited when I heard that it was being released in DVD quality.  I was disappointed though when I read that the fantastic music of the 90's would not be included.  Why would the artists not want their songs to live on through one of the most beloved clever series of our generation?  Although I would love to own this box set I would rather it be in its entirety.  Eventually they will release a ""directors cut"" or what have you. If they are smart that is.

3442801,5,B0019N8P2W,"Loved it.
Full of wit, sarcasm, humour, and that something from the 90's that just doesn't happen with teen shows these days... quality.

I used to wait for Daria to come on each week after school, so happy that I'd finally found a show where the kids actually questioned why things are the way they are; why the popular kids get special treatment, why it's considered weird to have an opinion, and why growing up can be hard sometimes.
Now that I have it on DVD, I can relive all the moments over and over!

For old fans like me, you will not be disappointed. Even though the original sound track had to be changed for copyright reasons, it's still got the attitude it had back then. There's over one hundred episodes to go through over the 5 seasons, plus loads of extras to play with, like episode intro's, original character sketches, and two movies; ""Is it Fall Yet?"" and ""Is it College Yet?"".

As for newcomers to Daria, if you love alternative views on society combined with teen angst and animation, you also will not be let down. It's as relevant today as it was in the 90's.

A great series, definitely worth buying in my opinion!",1277683200,,1140,4.466346153846154

Favortie line: Daria, referring to teaching, ""...the stress level of neurosurgery and the payscale of a video-rental clerk..."" Missed that the first time - but I didn't the second time!! Wonderful! If anything, I appreicate this even more now that I teach high school! Technical note: the one difference from the original is tha tsome of hte music had to be changed due to copyright issues. This was stated in the opening of the DVD and I personally did not notice a significant change. (The voices in the opening credits did not sound quite right -  that could have been it.) If this aspect matters that much to you, you might be disappointed but if you are mainly about the satire and sarcasm, get ready for it! Fantastic to have ""Daria"" at last!",1277510400,,1028,4.468085106382978
3442803,4,B0019N8P2W,"Well, here it is.  After one of longer waits in the DVD era, we finally get Daria: The Complete Animated Series.  I'm not sure whether the years were spent trying to get permission for the music, but clearly they gave up at some point and just decided to not bother for all but the handful of songs for which it was absolutely necessary.  Instead we get background soundtrack music.  And what a lot of people want to know now is: Will this effect my viewing experience?

Aside from the obvious, ""It depends who you are,"" I'd say the answer is, in general, ""a little.""  I thought, for example, that I'd miss Alice in Chains' ""Rooster"" during ""The Daria Hunter,"" or Cake's ""Daria"" at the end of ""The New Kid,"" but I really didn't.  But there are precisely two points at which the missing music IS glaring.  The first is the homage to Platoon in ""The Daria Hunter,"" where ""Adagio for Strings"" is missing.  You'd think that an instrumental composed in the 1930s would be easy enough to get, but they didn't bother, so major points off for that.  The second is ""Daria Dance Party,"" in which Upchuck actually implies the titles of two or three of the songs, yet all we hear is ill-suited mood music!  This is especially insulting since the most obvious missing song is ""Love Rollercoaster""; not only are there two versions of the song to choose from - 1970s and 1990s - but the latter one was done for the MTV movie Beavis and Butt-head Do America.

Speaking of movies, they're both here, though (a) It's not clear why the last shouldn't have the intro that graced its world premiere (as an option) when episodes have an optional ""Daria Day"" intro and (b) It's not clear why the first should be out of chronological order, leaving the casual viewer wondering how Daria and her guy went from talking about whether or not they should date to being a serious months-long couple.  The extras are fun, but the Top Ten - though understandably missing the videos counted down - also cuts some of the dialogue, thus neglecting to name the #1 animated video according to MTV.  (Hint: It's Google-able, and if you know anything about music videos, you'll probably guess it correctly.)  The DVDs have other organizational issues and no commentary, but most people will get them for the show anyway.

As for the show, I must admit that before this release I'd only seen the first two seasons plus a handful of reruns on The N, reruns that featured syndication cuts that are thankfully restored here.  I'm very pleased that the show only improved since these first two seasons.  So it is a worthwhile purchase.  Just don't be surprised if a select few episodes start to circulate more on file swapping services after DVD purchasers try to find a way to hear what this DVD set doesn't have.",1277424000,,2770,4.59349593495935

3442807,3,B0019N8P2W,"Having watched the original series and then the reruns on Nick (who's idea was it to sell out doing that really?) I am an avid fan of the series.  It's a major let down that the original sound track is edited clean out seeing as how there are several scenes where the artist and/or song itself is referenced in the show and suddenly you're left feeling bewildered.  I got to see several scenes that were edited out in the Nickelodeon reruns which brought back plenty of fond memories but I noticed that in a few sections there were actually lines missing, a few cutting one liners that are skipped out and if I can catch them I'm sure that there are far more die hard fans than I who spotted them too.  Among, to me, the most important missing parts to the series was ""Look Back in Annoyance"" where Daria and Jane look back on the series with all the running gags, one liners, and best of moments.  They threw in some nice extras and the ""cast interviews section was only six minutes, a true homage to MTV's truncated style.

The fact that Garbage's ""Breaking Up the Girl"" was missing from the final movie was nearly heartbreaking since that movie premiered the same night as the music video and they were used to set each other up, as explained in ""Look Back in Annoyance.""  Though not world shattering it is still a let down to not have some of the most relevant pieces in the set.  I wouldn't listen to half of the bands that I do now if not for having watched Daria like Garbage, Foo Fighters, etc.  Aside from most of these bands having fallen by the wayside I would think that they would have honestly appreciated the revival of their art and general reminiscent of their reign as stars.  Daria loses a lot in the translation without the music to break up /back up her general disposition and her theme, though memorable, is overplayed when you hit more than five times in a single episode.  Hell give that girl band another chance at the big time and let them write something relevant or get some garage bands a chance to write mood appropriate music and get their names out there.  People will do a lot more for free or less these days just to get a 30 second demo clip of their music played.  Ah well, I still like it and I'll keep it and watch it on occasion, just not in mini marathons like I would have been prone to otherwise.",1277164800,6,2339,4.3517241379310345

3442811,5,B0019N8P2W,"The series came out more than 10 years ago.  I absolutely love it, but if you're browsing the amazon reviews at this point, you probably know all about it already.  This review is more focused on the DVD collection itself.  Which is pretty wonderful.  This is a DVD that falls more under ""thoughtful, considerately supplied demand"" rather than ""revolting cash-grab.""  You get all 5 seasons of Daria, both movies, the never-before-seen (unless you have youtube, of course) pilot, and a few interviews with cast, directors, producers, etc., plus the ""Daria Day"" intros to all of the episodes played on Daria Day.  All for an extremely reasonable price.

The flaws, if you'd like to call them that, are few.

1) The most notable one, in my opinion, is that only the first episode of each disc begins with the ""You're Standing On My Neck"" intro.  Just two ""la la LA la la's"" and it begins.  Ideally suited if you're planning to marathon the whole series; less so if you only want to watch them once a day during dinnertime.  If you can't do without the song, though, you'll be hearing plenty of it, because
2) The music was replaced.  If you want to know why, read any other review on here.  The replacement music fills in the gaps perfectly.  During the first season there are a few gaps where the silence is pretty noticeable.  Then again, it was kind of like that, anyway. It took the producers a little while to find the right mix.  Nearly all of the credit-rolls (I've noticed that ""Dye! My Darling"" and ""Daria!"" have not) have been replaced by ""You're Standing On My Neck"" by Splendora.  Which makes its absence in the beginning in better perspective.  Cool song; didn't really want to hear it twice, anyway.
3) The credits now drag horizontal lines upward through the surreal credit photos.  Not very noticeable, though.  If you even catch it, I doubt it will bug you very much.

Other than that, perfect Daria.  This two-dimensional girl has some real depth, and I'm glad to finally have one of my favorite series in my video collection.",1276992000,2,2041,4.658263305322129
3442812,5,B0019N8P2W,"When I first got it I was kind of worried that I wouldn't like it the same way I had enjoyed the show in my youth. I mean, it's a show about high school. I was in high school when I used to see it back in the day and so I wondered if my tastes and humor had changed enough to render the show unlikeable. But as soon as I started watching the first episode I realized that I had worried over nothing.

It's still a great show with a great sense of humor and the same crazy wacky goodness that kept bringing me back the first time.

Only now I get to watch it over and over again whenever I feel like it.
Also, now I can actually remember it and better appreciate the jokes and subtle (and not so subtle) interactions between the different characters.

In addition, unlike most animated shows at the time, Daria actually had a forward moving plot and real character development. (Most noticeable in the last two seasons.) And the show was allowed to have a real ending on the creator's terms. That was made it clear that the series was over and it had tied up the loose ends over the last movie and brought real closure to the audience which was unheard of in animation at the time.

I'm kind of saddened that they didn't try to show Daria and Lane in their college years, (Oh, what could have been.) but I'm happy with what we got which is a really great show with a crazy wonderful cast of characters.

All in all a Great Show.

I recommend this show to all my friends.

Some will remember Daria as the brainy girl from Beavis and Butthead.  And if Beavis and Butthead embodiment of all that adults fear from the youth of tomorrow, Daria is the flip side of that same coin.  Smart, funny, and often intellectually stimulating which is saying a lot for a cartoon.  I highly recommend the series.

3442823,5,B0019N8P2W,"For six years, ""Daria"" was a popular animated series for MTV.  The character which was featured on ""Beavis and Butt-head"" received her own animated show which was shown on MTV from 1997 through 2002 has received positive critical reviews and even did better than ""Beavis and Butt-head"" in ratings.

The series which was created by Glenn Eichler (a former story editor for ""Beavis and Butt-head"" and ""The Maxx"") and Susie Lewis Lynn, ""Daria"" is a series about a misanthropic teenager named Daria Morgendorffer who speaks in a monotone voice and despite her intelligence, is not too favorable on her family and the people around her.  Having to go to high school with her popular/vain young sister Quinn and bare with her life at home with her work-obsessed mother Helen and her always stressed out about finances father Jake, she does have one friend that she can confide to and that's her fellow artistic and fellow misanthropic friend Jane Lane.

Each episode focuses on Daria's life at home, at school and the people around her such as the not-so-smart but chirpy cheerleader Brittany Taylor, the dumb jock Kevin Thompson, the ambitious Jodie Landon, the goth girl Andrea and the the nerdy and freaky Charles ""Upchuck"" Ruttheimer III.

Fans everywhere have been eagerly awaiting the release of this beloved cult classic. Online petitions for the DVD release have garnered over 50,000 signatures and Home Media Magazine listed ""Daria"" as the #3 TV show not yet on DVD last September

VIDEO:

""Daria - The Complete Animated Series"" is presented in full screen and in color.  All 66 episodes and the two movies look very good.  Colors are vibrant and although not the most detailed animated series, ""Daria"" manages to capture this look that was quite unique for an animated series and worked perfectly.  I detected no blurring, no interlacing or major compression artifacting.

Only the pilot episode is presented in black and white (the pilot is not fully animated or colored).

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Daria - The Complete Animated Series"" is presented in Dolby Digital.  Dialogue and music is clear and understandable.  It is important to note that there is an insert featuring show creator Glenn Eichler explaining how 99% of the music (fortunately not the intro. song) were changed for this DVD release.  Reason is because of the cost of licensing and the many bites used would have made it impossible to release the Daria animated collection.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Daria - The Complete Animated Series"" comes with the following special features on disc 8:

  * Daria Movie - Is it Fall Yet? - (1:12:18) It's summer vacation, what will the students of Lawndale High do over the summer?
  * Daria Movie - Is it College Yet? - (1:05:58) Daria must choose which college to go and worries about her relationship with Tom.
  * Character Profiles - The following feature allows viewers to obtain a profile of each character of the ""Daria"" animated TV show universe and also see the original character sketches for that character.
  * Pilot - Sealed with a Kick - (5:24) The original first episode pilot (black and white, not fully animated or colored but features the vocals).
  * Music Video - Freakin' Friends - (2:38) An animated Mystik Spiral music video.
  * Daria and Jane Top Ten Countdown - (5:52) Daria and Jane host the MTV's animated videos top 10 countdown.
  * Pilot Script for Spinoff ""Mystik Spiral"" - Included is the script for the pilot ""Mystik Spiral"" (via PDF included as a DVD-Rom).
  * Cast Interviews - (6:21) Featuring interviews with the co-creators and the voice talent.  Creators talk about how the series came to fruition and the writers talk about developing the series while the voice talent talk about the popularity of the show.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Daria"" is definitely a big part of American pop culture from the '90s leading up to the early 2000's.  Where most teen drama, especially on cable are all live, at the time, it was great to have a series with a character who was a misanthrope and a protagonist that wasn't super rich, absorbed in material things and pretty much, the series spoke to a lot of people.

So, in many ways, ""Daria - The Complete Animated Series"" is a release that many people are going to buy and enjoy.  I know there are some people who have a problem with music being replaced but the fact is, ""Daria"" is not the first, it's happening to a lot of series and it has been so bad to the point that many series have not been released on DVD.  Licensing for music on DVD's have become too expensive and a lot of the shows that we enjoyed are having to dump the music out or the series is not being released at all.

The good news is that unlike its predecessor ""Beavis & Butthead"" and unlike other television shows that utilized popular mainstream music, ""Daria"" had music but it was not the focal point of the series.  Aside from the main opening theme which is included on the episodes in this collection, it was the characters and the storylines that stood out for ""Daria"" and so, I can easily say that ""Daria - The Complete Animated Series"" is just as enjoyable without the original music.

Overall, his is a wonderful set and I really believe that fans will enjoy this release.  All 66 episodes (inc. the pilot), two films and special features and the episodes look very good on DVD.  If you are a fan of ""Daria"", then I highly recommend ""Daria - The Complete Animated Series""!",1276646400,4,12614,4.3706747404844295
3442824,3,B0019N8P2W,"While it's a little off-putting at first, due to the lack of the show's original music in the background, this is still a great collection for any fan of the show.  So if you can get past the lack of well placed & timed 90's music, at least you get to see Daria's wit and sarcasm once again.",1276560000,,291,4.017241379310345
3442825,4,B0019N8P2W,"Few shows capture the awkwardness of high school, and not just high school in the nineties.  Anyone who liked the show even remotely should buy this and relive the snark that is Daria.  I think she invented snark.

The bad: Oh MTV, after so long, this packaging is the best you can do?  There's no episode guide.  Every other TV series out there has a freaking episode list in the DVD release.  ""Daria"" doesn't even have a list of episode titles.  For fifty bucks, the production company could have done better.  It's just a plain multi-disc case with 6 discs and a letter of ""get over it"" regarding the absence of the pop music that was in the original aired versions.

The incidental music is fine, if a little subtle in places. There were only two places I thought where the lack of the original pop soundtrack was a problem.  In one place the lack of it ruined a joke about REM's ""Everybody Hurts"" video, which didn't make sense without the song playing. In the other, the incidental music should have been louder and the quiet didn't work for the scene.  That's it.  Only those of us who remember the original music will miss it, and if we wait long enough, age will take its toll and we'll forget about it.",1276560000,,1212,4.4343891402714934

I didn't watch it past the first or second season, for some dumb reason.  It's a very wry, sardonic kind of humor so if you like silly, cutesy stuff, this isn't for you!",1276473600,,318,3.9375

The container is sturdy enough to survive the USPS, but I really was disappointed with the DVD's. Not the content, daria is pure gold, the DVD'S are obviously the cheapest quality that can be made. I have bought DVD+R in packs of one hundred at Pay Day for ten denars that were a better quality. For $49.00 semoliens, you'd think that MTV would have sprung for a higher quality disc for their programming.
By all means purchase daria, just be very careful when touching the DVD's.",1276473600,,602,4.583333333333333
3442829,5,B0019N8P2W,"I was a little wary wondering how much of an impact not having the music would have on Daria. It was the show I watched while in high school and found myself relating to back then. I have to say, even without the music (Which IMO is hardly noticeable unless your watching it FOR the music) it's still the same awesome Daria it always was. My husband and I are enjoying the collection a lot, if for nothing else than it's nostalgia.

The resolution is great. The extras are good. And it's wonderful having it all in one easy to store collection. It could have been handled a lot worse (Releasing one disc at a time, costing a fortune, no extras/bare bones) but it wasn't. As for the music, well...blame licensing and copyright laws that are out-dated and the people who sue and barter just to make a bigger buck.",1276473600,2,811,4.406666666666666
3442830,5,B0019N8P2W,"Finally, after so many years of waiting, Daria has been released on DVD. My greatest concern, however, was how the updated music would compare. In all honesty, to a die-hard fan, the difference is noticeable. One of the great things about the show was the soundtrack; however, the wit and intelligence of the script makes you forget. The music feels appropriate and does not detract from the story. The quality is great as well(compared to watching it on TV). All in all, I am thrilled with the release and would recommend it to everyone.",1276387200,,538,4.73404255319149

The generic music in place of the 90s music is actually pretty good and there are only a couple of instances where the original soundtrack would've added to the scene.

It's what made this take so long in the first place, and if they hadn't finally given in, it never would have happened a lot. On the bright side, you're getting all the movies, extras, and Daria Day intros. And really, they fake the music in the studio (which is hilarious) so well it really doesn't impact much. This is a ton of great material for way cheaper than any fans expected. Accept the musical loss and enjoy the show.",1276128000,,588,4.4036697247706424

I think Daria might be the greatest teenage female character to have graced our TV screens. Angela Chase had a shot, but got too pathetic over Jordan Catalano.

If you are looking at this listing because you watched the show, buy this DVD set. I so enjoyed watching all of the episodes and know that I'll watch them again.",1276128000,2,497,4.391304347826087

So when I saw that the entire series, plus the two movies, was available in one set, I snatched it up. Daria is full of witty, quick humor and off-the-wall random things (Sick, Sad World)! It's now one of my favorite shows!",1276041600,,323,4.4

3442847,4,B0019N8P2W,"I loved the Daria series when it was on MTV in the 90s and like many I have waited a long time for this release. And I'm happy that they decided to create one box set with everything rather than waste our time and money by slowly releasing season box sets, with the risk, as has been the case with other series (ahem, Fox where are the rest of the King of the Hills???), of the production stopping half way if sales aren't up to par.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is not because they couldn't include the original music...which all of us die hard fans who have been begging for years for this release already knew. I'm not even upset at the letter that was included, which I personally think was somewhat of a nice gester because it lets us know that they are well aware of our concerns and desires and the factor that they gave it a Dariaesq tone I found kind of cute. What upset me is some of the music they put in to replace the original ones. Most of them still go with the flow of the episodes so you don't entirely notice the change (I actually found myself struggling to remember what the original songs were in some cases). But there are some that are so disruptive that it's downright annoying. Like the dream sequence in ""Ill""...the beat of the original song was similar to the one they replaced it with except for one major difference...the original song was softer!! The song they used to replace it was so harsh and annoying that I found myself fast forwarding through the scene so i wouldn't have to hear it. And there is a scene in another episode where the music is so loud you can't hear the characters talking, clearly showing that the music was dubbed over. And, as another reviewer pointed out, I'm a little disappointed that they didn't include an episode list. Sure many people don't look at it but some of us do, especially in series where the titles are so unique as is the case in Daria. And finally, I'm disappointed that they still included the movies with the cut scenes (they're minor, but if you saw the original on TV you notice them, and it took away some funny jokes).

We can't expect perfection and all of us fans are very grateful for this release. All I'm saying is that this box set is good, but it still needs improvement.

And note to the reviewer who says the packaging comes apart every time they open it...send it back as defective and get a replacement because mine doesn't do that. I did it with a Gilmore Girls box set years ago about a year or two after I bought it.",1275955200,,2525,4.322784810126582
3442848,4,B0019N8P2W,"This television series is one of the all time best. The DVD includes episode introductions for at least some of the episodes by Daria herself. The only remotely negative comment I have is what prevented this series from coming out on DVD, all of the scene transition music. I haven't watched all of the episodes yet, but for at least the first season, all of the recognizable music has been taken out and some ""transition"" music has been inserted in its place. You hardly even notice. In fact, forget I said anything. If you loved Daria before, you'll love her again.

The episodes are all there in their glory.  The original music is gone, but the replacement music fits just fine 99% of the time.  I loved every second of watching this wonderful series again, and was sad when I finished the set.

There are special features but not enough, and not interesting enough.  There are character sketches with some captioning that seems to be aimed at teens (don't they realize the teens who watched this show ten years ago are nearing 30 now?).  There is a bit called ""Cast and Crew interviews"" which is merely a 7-minute featurette of which 2 minutes are clips from the show.  The interviews are new, but needless to say: SHORT.  There are no commentaries at all.

One final bit - the series is only ""almost"" in chronological order.  The movie ""Is It Fall Yet?"" falls between ""Dye! Dye! My Darling"" and ""Fizz Ed"", but the movie itself is located on the final disk.  There are no instructions for new viewers to go to the final disk for the movie.

However that's all a small price to pay to get the entire series on DVD, and the ONLY reason I bumped it down to 4 stars.  The series itself is TOTALLY 5-star, and every bit as wonderfully snarky as I remembered it.",1275782400,2,1294,4.341666666666667

Daria is sarcastic, anti-social and 100% real - there is nothing fake about this clever high school gal. Daria was the perfect role model, she was smart, strangely beautiful, and insecure but had enought sass to back up her imperfections. Some of my favorite episodes include: Too Cute, Road Worrier, Pierce Me, Jake of Hearts, Jane's Addition, I Loathe a Parade, Fire!, My Night at Daria's, and Boxing Daria. Also included in this 8-disc set are the 2 Daria movies, Is It Fall Yet? and Is It College Yet? I love Daria, she puts a smile on my face even though she rarely smiles herself. I also love when Daria blushes when she is around her unrequited crush, Trent and her first love, Tom - so sweet because Daria is not the kind of girl who likes to wear her heart on her sleeve.

However while I was watching the shows on Disc 4 Season 3 Ep. 302-310 (The one with Kevin and Brittany on the front) the episodes where all messed up. Only two would play (The Lost Girls and Daria!) and they skip around. None of them are in order. Where the beginning of the episode should start it would be half way through the episode.
HUGE disappointment. I want to take it back but I'm not sure they will do anything about it.

Other than that this set is awesome and I'm very glad they put it out.",1275523200,,773,4.01948051948052

It's eight disks inside one container, good for not taking up much space in your dvd collection. I heard that it took a while for them to make the series on DVD because of the many copy right laws regarding the music that originally was on the show. I've watched it and it's always a great comic relief! Of course I'm a big fan, so it's a 10 out of 10 for me.",1275350400,,525,4.106796116504855

Solely having this dvd boxset makes it 5 stars, there are flaws however, but I guess if you're a major Daria fan, it won't be the end of the world.
The packaging is... pants to say the least. The box, the cover art, the lack of episode guide.
I'm not sure if it's just my copy but i have quite an obvious audio/visual sync delay (the characters mouths move way before the start talking)
There's the obvious lack of music, but most people won't really care too much about that.

3442863,5,B0019N8P2W,"I've been spending the weekend with my old friend Daria and this show is just as good as I remember it. What other show would devote an entire episode to a teenage girl working on a short story? This set contains all five seasons of episodes and the two movies. One downside, no music of the 1990s. Which is a shame, but the set would probably cost $300 if they had to fork out for all those music rights. Some reviewers are very angry about this. It is not particularly upsetting to me, as I was already into my 30s when this show was on MTV, so I'm not being denied the music of my youth. The quality of the stories and the truth of the characters more than make up for the lack of music in my opinion. But if the music is important to you, you won't be happy. In many ways this show is like King of the Hill, it manages to give a truer picture of people, who they are & what they really care about than any live action show. I did see one review that complained about the quality of the transfer. This is not true at all in my case. The colors are vivid, the picture quality is fine (even on a 42 inch HD) and the sound (alas no music) is good. Love it.",1275177600,,1156,3.9870689655172415

What could be better than remember all her episodes, all her famous quotes and get back 10 years ago to enjoy of the classic stereotypes that you used to find when you were young. Definitely this is not for today's young guys. This is for people who enjoyed to belong to some group and immediately identify with any of the characters.

The only thing that I'm missing is the original music. This boxset does not have the original songs that we used to hear, which was an important part of the series. It is understandable because it would make it impossible to have all the permissions and definitely it would be very expensive. However the way the created the generic music for each scene is almost as good as in the original. If you were not like a fan you'd probably won't notice it.

I'm giving it 4 stars because i consider myself as a very good fan and I do miss the original music.",1275004800,2,927,4.32183908045977
3442866,5,B0019N8P2W,"The music is not important when talking about this show. This show is about more than simple background music that honestly u cant hear much of because of the characters talking or its at the credits. I have a offbrand copy of the entire show and it has the original music, trust me, you're much better off just listening to many of the one hit wonders of the 90's and the biggest hits, or for the really desperate ones, you can simply google ""Daria Show Music"" and then download. Daria being released on DVD during a time where quality is depleting from American animation is wonderful.
 Daria is definely in my top 5, if not # 1 for being more than a tv show, it has become in my life a stable friend for when the world gets too much, I can easily sit back and relax. Nowadays everything is so cheaply made and manufacured that as far as entertainment, I as a teen, no longer enjoy or feel a emotional connection to. I first saw Daria as a young child, and I instantly loved it, albeit I couldn't comprehend all the subtle nuances and sarcasm. Now as a young woman, I understand it and feel enlightened that there once was time where tv shows were cryptically honest about consumerism. vanity,and how this affects a variety of different teens and the main character and its about staying true to yourself, without being ""suzy homemaker"" Daria has flaws and they definately show.

However, I was disappointed beyond belief to find upon reading the blurb inside the DVD packet that due to copyright, alot of the cool 90's music bites within episodes had to be deleted and replaced with newly composed bits of music. I was completely unaware that this is what held back the release of the DVD for so long. This does change how I enjoy the series now - something is definately missing.

Amazon, although I am happy to have Daria on DVD finally, I would have appreciated knowing that the episodes are not as they were originally aired before purchasing.",1274832000,4,645,4.560344827586207
3442868,3,B0019N8P2W,"After watching this show for awhile, Daria becomes a little boring to watch.  Her voice sounds depressing at times along with the sarcasm, but I guess that's what some people like about her character. Some of the episodes I've watched have been funny, but after listening to her for awhile, I need a break.  Back then, this show was funnier to me than now.  Sometimes that happens when you watch a show a few years ago, and then re-watch them years later.  There's been alot of talk about the music changes, but for me, this is not an issue.  I think one will still enjoy this show.  So far, the dvds have worked and shown great as well.  For all that comes with this set, the price is reasonable.  It's also great that it came with eight separate discs instead of two-sided discs.",1274832000,,781,4.4125874125874125
3442869,4,B0019N8P2W,"Well, when I heard about this box set, I made it a point to order one with my next available paycheck. After waiting nearly a decade for these episodes, I wasted no time in beginning a marathon of viewing that allowed me to burn through the products content within a week. Now maybe I can catch up on my sleep just a bit -_-;;;

All in all, I was very happy with the DVDs. When I originally saw the majority of the Daria series, it was the watered down versions produced by the N network. Watching these new and (mostly) unedited episodes gave me a much more fulfilling experience than before. Old and familiar favorites were present alongside stories I had never even heard of. All in all, it was an awesome feeling of nostalgia.

The extra features were fairly good too. The Daria Day Intro's were collectively excellent. In all honesty, I was disappointed that more episodes did not include them. The movies were everything I hoped for, while the interviews were refreshing. The remaining extras, however, such as the character profiles ended a little weak.

Now there is one thing that anyone involved with this product has to already understand and that is the issue of music. I have to admit that, upon initially discovering this change, I was not very worried. I enjoyed the series for its timeless writing and awesome animation. In fact, by removing the music the episodes are not as defined by a particular time period and will probably relate better with new converts. However, as the series progresses, I have to admit that the change in music is more and more obvious. In fact, secondary noises were sometimes improperly re-dubbed bringing more attention to the change.

Still, despite some mild weaknesses, I highly recommend this box set for both old fans and those completely unaware of it before. Daria relates to all those who were just a little different, awkward, or out of place in their High School experience. Let's be honest; no matter who you are or were, that describes you just as much as me, ne?",1274745600,4,2022,4.687323943661972
3442870,5,B0019N8P2W,"The release of MTV's brilliant DARIA animated series was held up for a long time because of problems with music rights; finally the series has been released, minus some of the terrific pop soundtrack that sparked it so much. But it's more than worth seeing even without that. There just hadn't been another series about teenagers before quite like this series (originally a spin-off from BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD, though that's hard now to imagine). Many series in the 90s paid attention to the growing pains outcasts of high school (such as FREAKS AND GEEKS), or to the anxieties of the popular kids (such as BEVERLY HILLS 90210), but never to both; what's more, DARIA paid equal attention to the screwed-up lives of the kids' parents and their high school teachers, all of whom were shown to be just a little bit off-kilter.

Like most of the other kids in her placeless, affluent suburb of Lawndale, Daria lives with her family in an ugly McMansion. Smart but deeply alienated, she attracts attention from her parents and her teachers for her intelligence but also disapproval for her unwillingness to be a joiner; she spends most of her time zoned out with her best friend, the wry and artistic Jane Lane, either sharing pizza or watching the popular television freak show SICK, SAD WORLD (which cannot match the bizarreness of Lawndale itself). Daria's emotionally wounded and hyperambitious parents, Jake and Helen, are too engrossed with their careers to take much notice of their daughter, and her teachers (almost all of whom are, like Jake and Helen, also narcissistic Baby Boomers) are baffled by Daria's disaffection and mostly ignore her. Her selfish sister Quinn, in order to remain popular with the reigning girls' clique (which is brilliantly self-titled ""the Fashion Club"") pretends at school they are not even siblings. But despite so much alienation and disconnection, almost everybody in the large cast appears in nearly every episode and gets something to say, which is part of the joy of the show. Teenagers of Daria's age tend to stay focused on Daria's romantic problems, first with her deeply embarrassing crush on Jane's slacker brother Trent, and then with preppy Tom, her first real boyfriend. But adults will enjoy the show for the hilarious attention paid not just to the kids' social circle but also to Daria's messed-up parents and teachers, who are also delineated with loving attention. One of the greatest pleasures of the series is how despite the charmingly flat animation style the characters continue to round themselves out and develop as, for example, Quinn deals with the berserkly petty power dynamics within the Fashion Club, Helen comes to realize her eldest daughter's extreme disaffection is a genuine coping strategy, and Daria learns to understand that there might be something of value behind the eyes of the other denizens of her teenage suburban wasteland.

If anything, the series is hilarious just for the brilliant voice work of the regular performers, probably the best group to work for an animated series (with the possible exception of THE SIMPSONS) in fifty years. The real star, of course, is the gifted Wendy Hoopes, who voices three of the major characters: the vain Quinn, the arch Jane Lane, and the breathily intense Helen, whose loopy salutation on her ubiquitous cellphone--""Hel-LOOOoo?""--cracks me up every time. There are wonderful sociological details scattered throughout, from the snide social commentary from the parents of Jodi (the hyperachieving African-American class president, and Daria's only other friend besides Jane), to the reverence with which the security-obsessed principal Ms. Li always speaks whenever she invokes the name of Lawndale High. Some episodes are certainly better than others (a flight of fancy where the teenage embodiments of the holidays visit Lawndale, for example, seems a real misfire). But when the series episodes are at their best--perhaps most memorably in ""Daria!"" (a musical episode that preceded a similar stunt on BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER), ""Quinn the Brain,"" ""Monster,"" and, my own favorite, ""The Daria Hunter"" (the Lawndale kids and their chaperoning parents are taken to a paintball park, where, of course, the Fashion Club assassinate one another with startling dispatch, and Daria is shot by her own mother: ""Oh Daria, you're not even TRYING!"")--it is one of the funniest television shows of the 1990s. This boxed set also comes with the two TV-movies MTV made for the series, ""Is It Fall Yet?"" and ""Is It College Yet?,"" plus such delights as a rock-video for Trent Lane's terrible punk band Mystik Spiral (which is going to get a better name some day, if the members could just think of one).",1274659200,4,4709,5.098445595854923

(Amazing how greed almost stopped this show from coming to DVD, but with a little change in music the series is finnaly here.) As a daria fan i want to give it 5 stars but due to the music changes and the episodes not being fully intact i leave it with 4. If your new to Daria you won't notice. But if you watched the show when it aired then you'll know what i mean. Still it's better to have something rather then nothing. Long live Daria!",1274400000,2,801,4.141025641025641
3442873,5,B0019N8P2W,"First off, I just wanna say that I, for one, am glad the show was released on DVD at all, given that its been many years with nothing. It was one of my absolute favorites as a teenager and I was SO excited to hear it was FINALLY coming out. Daria does, in fact, rock.

That aside...I wanna address some of the ""issues"" in this release. The music, 99% of it, has been changed. Yes, if you've recorded it and watched it on video for years and you know EVERY song inside out, you may be disappointed. However, if you never did this and you waited for a proper DVD release, you may not notice too much. There are moments here and there that I notice a particular song has been changed but, for the most part, they did a REALLY great job in replacing it with stuff that sounds very similar to what was there. Fitting the mood of the scenes and all. You can tell that actual thought was put into it and they didn't just lump some generic elevator music in. I think, if they just HAD to replace the music, they did a pretty good job.

As far as sound and picture quality...I've noticed shakiness and some obvious cuts, probably from where they put scenes back into cut versions of the episodes. Yes, they are ALL uncut on this release, which is a great thing. Overall, the quality is pretty good. It's decent. Yes, it IS, of course, in full frame as opposed to widescreen...why I've seen people complaining about this is beyond me because I wouldn't have expected anything else. I think some people just like complaining.

The packaging, in my opinion, is where the release really falls short. It's a large, plastic, standard DVD case with a plastic insert containing 4 double sided hard plastic ""pages"", it's like a book...if you often buy DVDs, you know what I'm talking about. Each DVD has it's own place so they ARE secure and safe from scratches. As you can tell, so far, this is nothing special at all. No box with artwork, not even so much as a cardboard slip of any kind. No episode guide either, which would have been REALLY nice to have. The artwork is just so-so, nothing special and there isn't much of it. They really dropped the ball in this aspect.

Content...you basically get everything as far as I can see. Every uncut episode from all 5 seasons including the 2 TV movies ""Is it Fall Yet?"" and ""Is It College Yet?"". The features are the original pilot episode ""Sealed with a Kick"", Mystik Spiral music video ""Freakin' Friends"", Daria Day intros, Top Ten Video Countdown hosted by Daria and Jane, Never before seen Mystik Spiral spin-off script and cast & crew interviews. The original theme song IS there as well.

Overall, I'm happy with the set the way it is. Yes, all the little things that could have been done would have been pretty nice. The music could have been left in, the packaging could have been A LOT better...but ya know what? It isn't. We have what we have, it's good enough. The show is still intact. The writing is still as great as it was...it's STILL Daria.",1274313600,17,2988,4.435336976320583
3442874,5,B0019N8P2W,"There really isn't much to say since everyone else basically covered it. I am fully happy with it, as it still makes me laugh. I found it so hard to put away because it was so good.

As for the music, its not a big deal depending on how you see it. For me, I am glad they got the series out. I don't really blame MTV or the creators of the show since in 1997 the idea of putting tv shows on dvd was either unheard of or just some concept that people probably thought was silly. But I do blame the music industry and the individual singers that decided to be greedy. Oh well its their loss in the end as they missed out on a chance for people to find songs to like and even buy through iTunes or something.

As for the packaging, its love-hate for me. It isn't the worst but it isn't the best. The thing does fall apart based on the position of how you hold it or if its rough handled. But you can snap the dvd holder thingy back on unless you break that.

3442875,5,B0019N8P2W,"I was a moderate fan of Daria when the show aired in the late 90's/early 2000's.  It wasn't that I didn't like the show (I actually liked it quite a bit), just remember it being a show I'd see from time to time and remember it being decent.  Funny, good writing, just simply entertaining.  When I heard it was coming out on DVD I didn't have to think twice.  The memories of watching the show were good ones, so I ordered it the day it came out (and ended up only having to pay 28 bucks-NEW-and this included shipping).  Well I can say after having watched the first few episodes of the Daria Series Collection that the show seems to have held up well.

I guess if I could knock anything it might be the video quality.  Grainy lines and bland reproduction are apparent in the episodes I've viewed, but this in no way takes away from the enjoyment of watching the episodes.  Maybe I'm just spoiled in today's age of Blu-Ray.  I'm not going to downgrade the DVD for not having the original music.  Number one, everyone knows this that would be interested in this DVD.  I wouldn't be telling you anything you didn't know.  Additionally, inside the case there's a small note explaining why it isn't there (costly licensing).  So nobody is trying to hide anything here.  Number two-It's not that big of a deal.  I'm frankly shocked everyone is so concerned about the original music being present.  It's not like this is Beavis and Butthead where the music played a much more regularly present central role to the plot/action of the episodes.  Personally, not being a person that remembered many of the episodes, the lack of original music so far has not taken away anything from my viewing experience.  Guess I'm not sure what everyone's big problem with this is?  If you like the music that much, go hop on ITunes???  Maybe buy some used CDs on Amazon???

In the end, if you remember liking/watching Daria, there's no reason not to pick this up.  It's affordable.  All the episodes (including the movies) are there.  The show has held up well.

On a side note, I'm uncertain how people could have been reviewing this specific DVD collection in February of this year.  It was released on May 12th (I believe) 2010.  Maybe that's the most upsetting thing about this product-The Amazon Reviews.  The point of a review is to review the product once you've used it, not to hype it or knock it, when the damn thing hasn't even been released.  I don't care if you've seen all the episodes or not, until you use the actual product in question-DON'T REVIEW IT ON AMAZON!!!!!!!!!!

Second, I found it at the store.

Third, I was confused by the packaging (8 disks in a standard DVD box?! WHAT)

...and finally, fourth, I looked it up on Amazon to see if I could get a better deal (over $70 at the store.. o_O) and lo and behold - I find out that we have once again been bent over the table by the music industry.

My husband works from within the industry and he can tell you first hand how corrupt it is: from ignorant kids being taken advantage of by signing horrid contracts to performers killing people and having the label clean up the PR nightmare.  If you are thinking about getting into this industry, I highly recommend the adult entertainment industry - it's less corrupt.

This is the same issue (music) that killed the Beavis and Butthead boxed set(s) for me - it's like trying to watch Jaws to Tangerine Dream.  It just doesn't have nearly the same impact as the original. Now, one would think that because the music was paid for and royalties given (like in a movie or other television shows) at time of airing and re-airing, this would allow them to be included in DVD form (IE would allow for smoother contract negotiation)...yet they are missing.  I also find this extremely interesting that it seems MTV has the most problems with this issue.  This leads me to believe MTV (and its associates/VIACOM) simply does not want to pony up the funds required to grant the many artists used for their animated series the royalties they deserve OR they are planning to trickle the music back in (IE what they sort-of did with the newest Beavis and Butthead boxed sets) to attempt to milk the public.  The third possibility is the multiple record labels involved cannot reach an agreement with VIACOM, which is also money-related.

...and they wonder why the torrents do so well.

I may buy this product when the price drops somewhere in the $20s. Used.  I refuse to shell out retail monies for what I view as an inferior product.

Update: A friend of mine bought the series and it was even worse than the comparison videos expressed.  The change in music affected the atmosphere and nostalgia to the point of distraction, the extras were laughable, and - most of all - the transfer was TERRIBLE.  Dirty, jittering, color-fading mess... far from what a show of this popularity and standing in the realm of MTV shows deserves.  I still refuse to buy this product new until a version worthy of the show is released.  I do not wish for this awful handling to taint this show for me... I like it far too much.

3442880,5,B0019N8P2W,"Before I begin this review, yes, Glenn Eichler does put in a disclaimer about why the DVD Collection had changed all the music sound bites.  Mainly due to the fact although MTV never had a problem with using them on their network, whenever you attempt to put it on another medium, you end up dealing with outrageous licensing issues.

Bottom line, it makes it impossible to release the collection because one would have to sell it at about $500 or so, not to mention getting approval by the artists themselves.  By that time, you'd never get the aforementioned item in a collection such as this.  (Probably why we'll never see the Gamera episodes of MST3K on DVD.. ah, well).

But enough grousing about insignificant details, let's get onto the collection itself.

First off, it's amazing something spun-off from Mike Judge's ""Beavis & Butthead,"" genuinely became an animated cult-classic.  Essentially because at the time, Daria was simply a passing character, attempting to be the voice of reason for these guys.  Whereas here, she's pretty much a realistic teen dealing with the nonsense which makes up high-school life.

""Daria"" has a refreshing spin when you watch it because it doesn't follow the typical 'teen' mould of animation.  No angst, no emotional nonsense, no 'brainless' adults, just a person dealing with the realistic (?) view of teenage life.  Back in the late 90's, thanks to shows like ""Saved by the Bell,"" ""Galaxy High,"" and other teen-based shows out there, basically you had the youth coming up like intelligent know-it-alls, while the grown-ups were usually portrayed as clueless adults.  Whereas with Daria, usually the problem with adults, was they were too absorbed with their agendas, or being too condescending.

Unlike other shows, Daria's parents usually knew what was going on at times, even though sometimes her sister, Quinn could usually pull a fast one on their father now and again.  And unexpectedly would help their daughters out of jams.

""Arts & Crass"" happens to be an excellent example, Jane & Daria get roped into participating with a poster contest for Lawndale High.  In true Daria fashion, Jane paints a picture of a young girl looking into a mirror, while Daria provides a rather controversial poem to go with it.  Amazingly, it gets submitted but Principal Li has the poem altered against Daria & Jane's wishes.  Of course, after they 'deface' their entry, Principal Li attempts in informing Daria's mom about the incident (apparently Jane's mother's off in her own little world).  But before Li can suggest any punishment, Helen utilizes her legal knowledge for getting Daria & Jane off the hook.

Another reason Daria has endured so well is the characters develop than just keep on being 'recycled' in endless persona.  For instance in Season One, Quinn is essentially the superficial opposite of Daria. But at the end of Season Five - and the movie finale, she starts realizing there's more to life than just fashion and popularity, much to Sandy's chagrin.

Overall, The Complete Series is great for any Daria fan out there, or someone who might want something a bit different than the teen fanfare shoveled out there by Disney.",1273881600,,3182,4.986742424242424
3442881,3,B0019N8P2W,"The release of ""DARIA"" on DVD is a mixed blessing: on one hand, it's a long-overdue release of a genuinely excellent series (that I continued to watch weekly even AFTER graduating high school); on the other, its also a painfully truncated version of it that kinda ruins the nostalgia for those of us who remember it differently (with the VHS evidence to prove it).

THE GOOD NEWS: the boxed set allows for complete viewing.  It's very easy to catch up or completely introduce yourself to the series if you were too young the first time around.  And you get to see all five years at once rather than scrounging around for multiple seasons.  I suppose it is better for the show to be available and doctored than to be unavailable at all, since the characters and writing were the key to its power.

AND we get the Pilot episode, which is nice.

THE BAD NEWS: Well, let's start with the music: we all knew that the original music was never going to be included; no one at Viacom will spend the money for licensing on every episode, and until a wealthy fan does so on their own dime, it'll be a dream unrealized.  But the generic music is kinda hard to deal with because sometimes its louder than the dialogue in the scene, or doesn't fit at all.  Also, the Splendora theme song for the opening titles is a different recording than the original broadcast and can be a bit annoying, although some of the Splendora cues made specifically for the movies are still intact.  The music situation is probably only going to hurt purists like me who remember the show from the first time around.

Here are some others, some big, others just nitpicky:

- The second movie/last episode ""IS IT COLLEGE YET?"" is the censored Noggin-channel version.  While I've resigned myself to the music problems, this one is inexcusable; MTV owns the series, it should have the original print somewhere.

- The special features are a joke.  Again, due to music issues, the specials ""Look Back in Annoyance"" and ""Behind the Scenes at Daria"" are absent, and the retrospective is painfully short, with snippets of interviews rather than actual ones.  Also absent are any TV spots for music (like the Garbage promo from ""IS IT FALL YET?"").  However, the animated sections from an MTV video countdown are included, though not the videos themselves.

- The show is in order but with no season dividers; you have to research which episodes were in which season.

- The early episodes are a bit faded; they aren't damaged, but the color isn't as sharp as the later episodes.

- Closed Captioning but no subtitles.

- The movies are shoved on the extras disc, not given context as to which seasons they capped off (video quality is SLIGHTLY inferior as a result).

So overall, the collection isn't a waste for those who want to experience the show as a whole and not as a time capsule.  For those who want the show in its entirety uncut and unaltered...we still have our VHS collections.  But while some things were unavoidable due to rather large legal issues (the music), other things that were entirely solvable (uncut versions, picture quality, etc.), make this an underwhelming accomplishment.  Considering how well the ""AEON FLUX"" boxed set turned out, and how terrible the ""BEAVIS & BUTT-HEAD"" boxed sets turned out, this one falls in between: neither as good or as bad as it COULD have been.  Three stars is being generous.

Regardless, I would suggest waiting for sales or markdowns to buy it; at the current price it isn't worth it.",1273881600,28,3503,4.67373572593801
3442882,3,B0019N8P2W,"Did they really need to use packaging almost identical as the bootleg copies out there? Also, with no chapter page or booklet with this set, and just a little ""note"" about the music,  I am pretty disappointed. My Dr. Katz complete set came with a nice booklet about the characters and episodes. I guess I expected the Daria set to be just as carefully put together.

Im still glad to own a legit copy of the episodes, as they're smart and funny and just as entertaining now as before. I guess Ill just hope for a re-release set later or something :)",1273881600,4,549,4.372549019607843
3442883,3,B0019N8P2W,"Don't get me wrong; I love Daria both as a character and as a series, but this is a half-assed release on the part of MTV. They decided against playing the opening credits before each episode, only at the beginning of the first episode on each disc. This is something I've not seen in a DVD release since, well, since Daria was airing on TV. This is baffling since they included the mid-episode cut scenes before commercial breaks. The most damning thing, however, is that they didn't bother to clean up the transfer. Some of the episodes have a bit of jitter to them, and some episodes have a good deal of dust and scratches on it that make it look closer to VHS quality rather than DVD quality.

The scrubbing of late 90s and early 2000s music from the episodes was a regrettable, but understandable decision for a series that had come and gone before the rise of DVD releases of American TV shows (and before contracts were drawn up with record companies to include a tune's use in later release). The most noticeable scrub-job I've seen so far is Adagio for Strings from the end of the episode, ""The Daria Hunter."" The scene of Sandy running after the bus and falling down is referencing Platoon, but without the music from Platoon playing in the background, the scene just sort of falls flat. It's a minor annoyance for fans of the show, but it's significantly less annoying to me than the jitter, the dust, and the scratches.

The best thing about this release for fans is that many of the episodes haven't been seen in their entirety for years because certain things were just a bit too racy for The N and sadly, those were the episodes that were often included in torrents of the series. This fact alone is worth the price of admission despite all the flaws.",1273795200,12,1766,4.515625
3442884,4,B0019N8P2W,"Given the fact that most of the original music is redone or missing in this series, it was actually a good thing that it took so long to release it.  How many of us actually remember what song went where anyway?  There is only one song that I completely miss, and that was Cake's ""Daria"" in the closing credits.

When it comes down to it, what most people remember about ""Daria"" is the wit.  There aren't many cartoons out there where the lead character is immersed in realism and the message isn't idealistic. Daria and Jane do not have rose colored glasses, which is interesting in a setting which the supporting cast of characters are full of stereotypes. You have the dumb cheerleader dating the dumb jock.  You have the smart artsy chick, the only popular people are shallow, the acne filled perv.  However, the show breaks stereotypes when 2 of the smartest and well balanced people in the show are African American.

The humor is smart.  One example of the jokes in this series can be found when the dumb jock and cheerleader are making out on a school bus.  Disgusted, the African American girl says, ""Would Martin Luther King be offended if I moved back of the bus?""  You have to know who Martin Luther King was, and the significance of the back of the bus to the civil rights movement in the 1960's for this to be funny.

Although the original music is what put this series over the top, really the dialogue and attitude is what made this series great. I can't believe MTV forgot to get rights to new forms of media when creating this series instead opting for broadcast rights only.  This is the sole reason why I am not giving this 5 stars.  However, I must admit having the songs would have dated this material.  Now it is timeless and transcendent.  Not having the rights to reproduce the soundtrack may be a blessing in disguise.",1273795200,4,1844,4.5120481927710845
3442885,5,B0019N8P2W,"I was SO EXCITED when I got it in the mail yesterday! Daria was a smart, intelligent and unintentionally funny show that epitomized the 90's. MTV had a hit in this show and the current state of the channel couldn't be further than it was when this show came out.

While I am bummed that the music is taken out of the show, I understand that this is a reason why some of my favorite shows haven't been fully released or at all onto DVD, so I was more than happy to purchase it minus the iconic music that it contained. I was, however, pretty peeved when the only type of booklet or information was a tiny sheet saying ""tough crap,"" and we should be happy we got the set at all. The creator could have gone about this in a different way...

I was hoping a booklet about the episodes or some additional information on the show but just received the crappy ""no music sheet.""

Regardless, I am more than ecstatic to be able to watch these in full (okay, okay, sans good music, but honestly, the replacement music isn't bad) and even happier that the last few days have been rainy and terrible-- an even better excuse to relive parts of my preteen/teen years all over again.",1273708800,,1168,4.324200913242009
3442886,3,B0019N8P2W,"I received my Daria DVD today and I was excited to finally get it. I read the little paper inside the set which explained why the music is gone.  99% of the music is gone, what a big let down!  I really loved the music as it was a huge part of the show.  I'm happy that I can now watch Daria but it's so incomplete with out the music that fit the theme of each scene.  I'm hoping that eventually they will be able to release the DVD in its original format.  But for now this will do.

I had never seen the first episode of the series and today I was able to.  Which finally killed my curiosity.  I've been watching each episode all afternoon and most of the evening, but I can't get over that the music is gone.",1273708800,4,711,3.9577464788732395
3442887,3,B0019N8P2W,"I have been looking forward to the Daria on DVD for many years now. Like all the other posters I am bummed out about the music changes, but understand the reasoning.

I am a bit upset with encoding quality. You can clearly see distortions and MPEG artifacts during fast motion, as well as edge aliasing. To see a really pronounced instance of this, watch the mystic spiral music video, all the background effects are really distorted.

This is particularly upsetting since most of the video in daria is low speed with fairly static content, so a decent encoder operated by a competent compressionist should have easily been able to get excellent encodes, even with 3 hours of video per dual layer disc. What is particularly vexing about it is that, the discs have a lot of empty space. Disc 1 is 7.6GB, which means it is well past the size of a single layer disc, but they had about 10% more space available that they could have used to get better encoding quality with almost no effort.

Ultimately the set is a bargain, but I would have been happy to pay more for a better a product. Hopefully MTV kept the raw digital files around and will do new encodes in the future if the series is ever rereleased.",1273622400,19,1205,4.493150684931507

Still there seems to be a decent amount of extras and the price is very good for getting all five seasons and the two TV movies.

It's too bad that MTV is simmering pool of reality show slime nowadays and would never develop a show like this ever again.",1273622400,,496,4.333333333333333

Overall I like what I have and hope they release the complete series of Beavis and Butthead instead of just some lame collecters pack.",1273622400,3,617,4.517857142857143
3442890,5,B0019N8P2W,"I'll try and be as detailed as possible.

1. The Packaging.

The complete set comes in one DVD case. It's plastic, not cardboard. The DVDs themselves are attached to ""pages"" inside the DVD (similar to the Justice League and Superman complete series sets, if you're familiar with those. A lot of other DVD compilations have started using this format lately as well, so you might've seen it elsewhere). The DVDs are NOT dual-sided, thank goodness, so inadvertent scratching should be minimized. All in all, the packaging looks sturdy, and arrived in perfect condition from Amazon. Not a single disk was out of place.

2. The Episodes.

When you first load up a disk and get to the menu, you're presented with two options: Episodes and Play All. These are pretty self explanatory, however, it appears that if you want to see the Daria Day intros, you must go to the Episodes section and individually select the episode you want to watch, and you'll be presented with an option to watch the ep with the intro. Not every episode has an intro. Also: only the first episode on a disk has the complete credit sequence, all the rest just have the title card (as if they had been edited into a large TV marathon, which I think helps).

Also, as most of you are already aware (especially the ones who downloaded some eps off of Amazon recently), most-if-not-all of the incidental, licensed music has been replaced with, as the initial press release said, ""generic and scene-specific music."" The music is SIMILAR thematically to the original tracks but, yanno, a hell of a lot cheaper. Those of you who taped every episode of Daria off the TV and watched them until the tapes broke, you're probably gonna be disappointed. However, if you love the SHOW (or if you're like me, and have only seen a handful of original eps), the loss of the music is really inconsequential. Also, the music they used IS appropriate to the scenes, so someone actually paid attention while dubbing this stuff in, and didn't just throw generic tracks in at every point where a licensed song used to be.

One final musical note: every commercial bumper now has a sampling of the Splendora theme, and each credit sequence has a lyric-less version of the theme playing over it. This does KINDA get annoying after awhile, but really, you can ignore it. At least they actually kept the bumpers IN, y'know?

In terms of episode quality, they all look GREAT. Everything is crisp and as clean as it could possibly look. The sound quality is nice and clear.

Disk 1: Season 1 (Picture of Daria)
Episodes 101 through 109

Disk 1 also has three ads at the beginning for The Maxx, The State, and the three Mike Judge Beavis & Butt-head compilations. This seems to be the ONLY disk in the set with these ads, which is good. You can manually skip past these straight to the menu, but you cannot use the 'menu' function to jump past them.

3. Final Thoughts.

As mentioned elsewhere, the DVD comes with a special letter from Glenn Eichler, explaining the reasons why 99% of the music has been changed.

Aside from the music issue (which, again, to me is a non-issue), this is the set we've all been waiting for. The episodes are INTACT (not the Noggin edits), pretty, and as funny as they were the first dozen or so times you watched them.

Really, I implore you, if you've been waiting for Daria on DVD, don't let the music thing hold you back. You really DO want this set. It's not EXACTLY what you've been asking for, but it's within 99% of it, and in my opinion that is DEFINITELY worth it.",1273622400,152,5302,4.6191489361702125
3442891,5,B0019N8P2W,"I wasn't expecting the DVD to come so fast since it had just been released today. But I happen to go check the shipping status and they said it was sitting in the door. I'm so excited and couldn't wait to begin watching but then I saw the note from the creator himself saying that sadly, the music was changed entirely ""because the cost of licensing the many music bites we used would have made it impossible to release the collection (and for many years it did)"". It was probably a huge sacrifice that they had to make (and didn't want to make) to finally get this DVD out. It's not going to be the same watching this but at least the episodes themselves haven't changed. I'll still enjoy watching this nonetheless.",1273536000,3,716,4.431818181818182
3442892,3,B0019N8P2W,"After waiting forever I'm disapointed they said this was a complete collection, but it is missing episode one from season 3 which was titled ""Daria""  it was a musical episode of daria and they went strait from the last episode of season 2 two the second episode of season three titled ""through a lens darkly""  why is it advertised as a complete series when ""Daria"" isn't included?",1273536000,6,380,4.656716417910448
3442893,5,B0019N8P2W,"I just got my copy. As I opened it, I noticed that there is a note on the inside of the set from series creator Glenn Eichler describing the wonders of this box. However, he also details its horror, and that is that ""99% of the music has been changed, because the cost of licensing the many music bites we used would have made it impossible to release the collection (and for many years did).""

Now, if you're a die-hard Daria fan like myself, this will discourage and upset you, but will not keep you from owning and enjoying this wondrous box set. It looks great, it sounds great, and the extras are awesome. But it won't be exactly the way I remember it. It will be a new way to experience Daria. Maybe not the most authentic, but it's as close as we're going to get.",1273536000,12,770,4.238095238095238
3442894,5,B0019N8P2W,"Daria is a hilarious, satirical series about life in our self-obsessed, oblivious culture through the eyes of someone who rejects the bandwagon and any of the pressure to jump on it. Daria is a sardonic, brilliant teenage girl who is trapped inside of a meaningless school life and a disengaged home life alongside very superficial, preoccupied and/or clueless people-- She and her sidekick Jane have a scathingly sarcastic and deadpan way of making sense of the insanity around them, forced to go with the flow but never without a well placed witty zinger! The all time best quote from Daria was her comment regarding being forced by the school psychologist to endure a ""Self Esteem"" course: ""I don't have low self esteem- I have low esteem for everyone else."" The episodes leave me shaking my head, smacking my leg and wanting to hit a rewind button over and over.

3442896,5,B0019N8P2W,"Daria: The Complete Animated Series

The Complete Series in Full-Screen Format (Five Seasons and 2 Movies) on 8 Discs with a running time of 1606 minutes! Whoa! This will be released on DVD on May 11th.

Who can forget Daria Morgendorffer? Even I, who did not grow up with cable and wouldn't have been allowed to watch it if I did since teenagers were speaking rudely to their parents, knew the impact ""Daria"" had on the hearts and minds of the young. Watching it fresh for the first time as a 26 year old, it makes me flash back to those days in high school....*shudder* and I feel her pain that can only be combated by truly brilliant sarcasm.

The series ""Daria"" paints a picture many young people are familiar with of high school jocks, cheerleaders, nerds, antisocial elitists, and the most ditzy ""popular"" younger sister along with a phony suburban mother and a clueless father. Parents have a lot of trouble understanding their kids when they get in high school -- case closed, there is no argument here. High school is a brutal trial by fire that is supposed to be some of the happiest days of our lives. Then thank goodness we graduate and move on to bigger and better things. Even college is scorned in this show as a series of frat parties, keg stands, and paying people to write your papers for you without a hint of real nostalgia. (Tangent: Yes, college is supposed to be the next stage of the ""best days"" and it too can have wonderful, endearing moments way more than high school every could, but wouldn't it really be great if we lived every day in the present without looking back or forward? I could be on to something here. Just sayin'. ;-) )

The character Daria just doesn't fit in anywhere and doesn't WANT to. She scorns everyone and would much rather sit back with her friend, Jane and puzzle on the mystery of other people's idiosyncrasies. Her sarcasm is hilarious and unforgettable as she would tell a whole sub-population of people to go to hell if she actually cared about them. If you looked up ""indifference"" in the dictionary, you would probably see her picture.

This series ran for five seasons and even included two movies, all of which are included in this set. Unfortunately it is in full-screen, but what can you do? It ran from 1997-2002. A major difference that might be noticed by fans of the show that is addressed in an insert in the case is that 99% of the music changed because of the cost of licensing it and that's why it's taken so long to release this collection.

Bonus Features:

The Pilot episode ""Sealed with a Kick"" is included as a bonus....I thought it was part of the collection *shrug*. Also you get to see Mystik Spiral's music video ""Freakin' Friends"" featuring Trent Lane singing. There are written character profiles on EVERYONE so that should keep you occupied for a while if all the other content wasn't enough!

The two movies in the series are included as extras on the last disc: ""Is It Fall Yet?"" and ""Is It College Yet?"" They are both like extended episodes in the spirit of the series. The Fall one focuses on summer plans and College obviously on the future.

Top Ten Video Countdown hosted by Daria & Jane is great if you like the MTV's countdowns. You get to see Daria and Jane using as much sarcasm as possible in their introductions but it does not show any of the actual music videos since that would require too much licensing. Mystik Spiral spin-off script is a DVD-ROM extra available for download. It is a third draft that was never made into a series.

The cast and crew interviews give a lot of background to the series. MTV was looking for an animated series that would appeal more to women and Daria started as a character on ""Beavis and Butthead"" and decided to create a spin-off with her and they needed a strong female protagonist. The show developed naturally without a lot of direction and it was pretty much a free-for-all in the first season. The same voice-over actress, Wendy Hoopes voiced Quinn, her mother Helen, and Daria's best friend Jane by using different registers in her voice.",1273276800,7,4079,4.575342465753424

That said, I'm so glad to have a Daria DVD collection that it almost doesn't bother me. But what feels kind of insulting is the piece of paper inside the DVD case explaining that the show can't be released with its original soundtrack, and basically saying that we should just suck it up and be glad that we got a DVD collection at all. That's all that comes with the DVDs (which are packaged in a crappy case that keeps falling apart when I open it). No booklet, no episode guide, just a slip of paper telling us that the music is gone and we should just get over it. I feel like the fans who have waited so long deserve something more.

Yes, it would be great to have the original music ... but that just wasn't realistically possible. Fortunately, the show is easily strong enough to survive. The characters are still rich and vibrant, and the stories still witty, hilarious and emotionally complex. Bravo to everyone involved!

SECOND: A word for new fans about the chronology of this set. The movie ""Is It Fall Yet?"" has been placed on the last disc. This film should actually be watched BETWEEN SEASONS FOUR AND FIVE. That's where it fits, filling in the summer break between school years. The second movie, ""Is It College Yet?"" should be watched following the end of Season Five, as it dovetails with the final episode and wraps up everything.",1272499200,6,1039,4.937142857142857

3442903,5,B0019N8P2W,"In the era when MTV still gave a crap about not pandering to the lowest common denominator with its programming, there was ""Daria"".

The irony is, ""Daria"" was spun off from the ridiculous, but admittedly amusing, ""Beavis and Butthead"" series. Where that show gleefully wallowed in the stupid and moronic, ""Daria"" went in the opposite direction. Using her sarcasm, commentary, and general cynicism, the show showed that one could be intelligent and blunt but still be entertaining. In its way, the show dealt with the usual crap of being a teen without being preachy, moralistic, or boring. And it assumed that the audience was smart. Which MTV obviously no longer does.

Admittedly, I am not in the demographic for this show (30s), but a smart show is a smart show, and I have waited for this series for ages. It is long past time this series is finally being released. Maybe it will make some remember when MTV was relevant, socially aware, and treated young people like thinking beings and not Barbie and Ken dolls for reality TV crap. I think - if one like smart shows with an edge - one would love ""Daria"", regardless of age. (Ironically, I think the character of Daria, if she existed naturally, would have plenty to say about the state of the channel today that she originated from. And none of it good! LOL!)

On the downside, I am 99.999% sure there will be music deletions and substitutions, the dreaded ""rights issues"". While I do wish that would be left intact, I guess I could see where it would be cost prohibitive, and this series is too good to sit in a vault because of it. Which is why I still give this DVD set five stars regardless of that issue. So, I will live with the music changes. But complain. Daria would be pleased!

In short, if you like animation, wit, fun, intelligence, and snark (of which there is plenty!), let ""Daria"" entertain you! You'll feel smarter for it.

Edited to add, as I have answered another review via the comment link, and it may not be readily seen: Daria the Musical episode *is* included on this DVD set, making it, as advertised, the ""complete"" series! Its production number was 301; however, MTV used ""Through A Lens Darkly"" as the Season 3 premiere years ago, and the DVD order is the same way. Daria The Musical is episode #7 in Season 3, as it was when it originally aired. And it is the one episode retaining its original end music over the alter egos/credits.

Also, regrettably, ""Is It College Yet"" is again the edited version, but from another account here in the discussion thread regarding this set, MTV tried for the unedited version, but the master of the audio and video could not be located to synchronize, so the edited version it is. There is also the belief that copyright played a role in using the edited version, as well. However, one episode in the grand scheme of things is not bad!",1268697600,113,2857,4.592156862745098
3442904,4,B0019N8P2W,"this series is waaayyy overdue. and the only reason why i'm giving it the 4 instead of 5 stars is because the music/soundtrack is possibly edited. i bought a bootleg complete series awhile ago but it doens't have a proper menu and skips intros/outros. all politics aside, daria should be on adult swim.",1268697600,4,302,4.716981132075472

3442907,4,B0019N8P2W,"...and just like the man who created the ""15 minutes"" terminology, Andy Warhol, Daria was very weird, intelligent, with often no style at all, which basically made her stylish all in herself. It's good that MTV is bringing this back to show these spoiled know-it-all kids what MTV was about for a brief moment of time. That being said, if you are a fan of cookie cutter shows like ""The Hills, Jersey Shore,"" or even ""Twilight"" (that horribly awful movie that is ironically being advertised with this as a bundle), then you probably will not like Daria. And I normally don't support MTV, but for the re-release of this series to DVD I want to say thanks to the network. And as another reviewer pointed out, BY ALL MEANS keep the original music that was played in the series on this release. Now if only they would encourage the producers of Daria to do a new series on the channel....",1267833600,4,883,4.525

It is by far one of the few good shows that came from MTV. After years of waiting we can all sit back and enjoy Daria, Quinn  and Jane again. Yippy.",1266710400,3,294,4.345454545454546
3442911,5,B0019N8P2W,"I would watch this show when I was in High School, hopefully catching a new episode instead of the 4 or 5 that MTV showed over and over again.  I tried watching it on the N but I felt weird watching a pre-teen channel and it really annoyed me how it was edited, and not very well I might add, when characters lips are moving and no words come out you know it's edited.

So, years later I realize I really like this show that I think I've seen a total of 10 episodes.  Needless to say I was shocked to find out there are 65 plus two movies.  I have a lot of catching up to do on May 11, 2010.

I'm rating the show not the DVD set, so it might come out and be total garbage, worst case scenario edited for pre-teens.  I'm not 100% sure if you can change ratings or not but if they screw it up I'll try the day after it gets on my doorstep.  Maybe a few days depending on how long it takes me to watch 8 DVDs.

17-2-12 update.  Well, at first I didn't want to get this because of the music thing and downloaded a complete version.  That kept me happy for a while but the audio was horrible and this finally got cheap so I got it.  The quality is good and the missing music is sad but it is still Daria.  The price now is bearable, it having no included booklet and weak extras caused it to be over priced when it came out.  Eh, I like it, the quality is much much better than anything I have found on the web so I'm happy and recommend it.",1266451200,2,1436,3.893470790378007

A whole generation will be able to go back to a time when the world felt smarter in many ways and when teenagers were the hope of the future rather than oversexed, immature, corporate packaged fad followers (Or maybe we were but the corporations had to be less obvious about it?). Ironically, MTV, the channel that originally broadcast this brilliant show about Daria and her witty friend Jane to a mostly likeminded audience have now begun to cater to, or some would say go out of their way to create and perpetuate, an immature drama addicted generation of Britneys and Kevins who only want shows like The Hills or Jersey Shore.

All in all this set is great for us fans who have waited so long, even if it can't live up to being entirely worth the wait. Firstly, I am thankful that they released the entire series at once so we never had to worry about poor sales or stupid executives only allowing partial release of the series. Secondly, I did enjoy the special features but wish they'd had more, maybe some commentaries, to make up for the absence of proper music. There is also a paper inside the set telling us, in Daria fashion, to be happy we got the set at all and I found it funny and in tone with the show. That said it would have been nice to have a proper booklet with episode summaries and show facts to go along with it.

Watching the show with the music changes I will say it's still a funny and enjoyable show, but even to those who say they didn't pay much attention to the music, I think you'll still sense an absence. It's not enough to ruin my enjoyment of this great series but I can best describe it by saying when I watch the show without proper music it feels as though one of the main characters is missing. I still enjoy it but in the back of my mind I keep wondering when and if that main character will return. At any rate getting the complete series with a few special features for this price is more than worth it.

To sum up this show is great regardless but it does suck that songs inevitably had to be changed and left out since the late 90's and early millenium music is a character of the show. I personally say five stars for this series but I have to give this set 4 stars because I do miss the music and wish there had at least been some more in depth special features to make up for it or even a book with proper episode listings. Still, this is a great buy for any Daria fans - just remember to only get as excited about it as you imagine Daria would have been and you should be fine.

*Kind of upset that the Looking Back In Annoyance Special wasn't included on this set yet the Jane and Daria Top Ten Countdown was. Oh well, still 4 stars from me.",1265587200,510,4306,4.3254658385093165

3442918,5,B0019N8P2W,"The Show is a masterpiece. Simple as that. The more you watch it, the more you get out of it. Possibly the most intelligent show I have ever seen. This show isn't just funny and smart, but enlightening. I think most people will come out richer after watching Daria, and that applies to school kids and middle aged adults equally. Daria isn't just a TV show, it's art. It will stand the test of time and is already an important cultural work.",1264464000,,441,4.390243902439025

I am the middle of three children (32, 25, and 18) and I got into the show watching the first season with my brother when he was in high school. Thats THREE different age groups, and two generations! Come on Mtv! Figure out what to do with the soundtrack already! It's been 10 years! There has got to be something you can do about the music rights! You've waited long enough.

3442921,5,B0019N8P2W,"Back when MTV was cool and actually played music, one show stood out amongst the rest: Daria. This show started when i was about 7 years old and ended when i was 13.

3442922,5,B0019N8P2W,"Such a shame that this show is not given the proper  recognition that it so  deserves and it is such a shame that the public wants to watch pop cultural references intended to be written as jokes  and recycled toilet humor like Family Guy over decently  written shows like Daria where the jokes are subtle and sarcastic . Everyday,  I adored and still adore watching  a sane person  encountered insanity every step and direction she takes with her friend jane, and I admired her for being abled to shield off some of that insanity she comes into contact with her acerbic wit while masking her own insecurities that would later be unveiled in the ""Boxing daria"" episode..I of course related to Daria the most, but I enjoyed the idiosyncrasies and personalities of all the characters on the show, no matter how exaggerated their portrayals would look in real life. I like how  the characters evolved over time , particularly Quinn and I liked how the writers made her realized that she has something more to offer to this world rather than fashion vomit and her looks ;

Looking at the crap that MTV airs now, one would be surprised that a show like Daria used to air on MTV , just as one would be surprised that MTV used to air nothing but music videos on their channel.  They really need to make up there mind about which target audience they would like to attract to their viewership",1257811200,2,1384,4.544354838709677
3442923,5,B0019N8P2W,"And this still isn't on DVD?
I've been waiting patiently for this show to be on DVD. I loved watching it during my teen years and I still love it. Daria was just so great and the stories. Pure Genius.
I hear that it'll be on DVD soon, and once it becomes available, I will be buying it. Hopefully, there are no episode missing and there are some DVD extras.
If you've never seen Daria, just watch it. It has all the typical teen stereotypes and the normal, and not so normal, teenage experiences and it's all told through the eyes of a sarcastic outcast, who still manages to be completely lovable.

Thank goodness this is finally on DVD. I will definitely be ordering it.

I am pretty sure that many people felt just like me, or simply enjoyed the series because of its smart quotes and lovely characters.

It's been many years since Daria was last aired on TV-as a Brazilian girl, I had to resort to MTV Latino to watch it, since it left our MTV very early. In this era, when we can find TV series of the sixties and seventies in nice boxed sets full of extras, I can't help but wonder: when will Daria fans have the pleasure of revisiting their beloved series on DVD???

I think it's about time MTV released a boxed set of one of its best creations ever-if even Beavis and Butthead got one...

please put it on dvd. the show is great and deserves it. beavis and butthead even got a freaking dvd release! (not gonna lie, i own it) but daria is 10X better than beavis and butthead.",1223683200,2,355,4.071428571428571
3442941,5,B0019N8P2W,If Daria is put on DVD and is done right (has original music) I wouldn't hesitate to fork out money for it. This show is my absolute favorite. I really hope it gets put on DVD so that I can watch it whenever I like.,1222214400,2,215,3.8
3442942,5,B0019N8P2W,"...well, in my opinion. Other than when they used to show real videos and shows about real music, of course. Of all the non-music related shows MTV has created (and there are way too many), this was their best.
We need this on DVD. Please, it has been six years since the last Daria movie. It's time, Viacom/MTV!!!",1222214400,,314,4.431034482758621
3442943,5,B0019N8P2W,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this show.  It got me through high school and I am 26 now.  I STILL AND WILL ALWAYS LOVE DARIA!!!!!,1222128000,,116,3.7916666666666665
3442944,5,B0019N8P2W,"I was so happy a few years ago when the N started airing Daria...until I saw how they hacked up the episodes. Apparently it's okay for Degrassi to show teen sex and drug use, but it's not okay for a Daria character to say ""hell"" or ""thank God"".  (Yeah, that makes sense!)

Here's hoping that the guys at MTV finally get a clue and release Daria on DVD - uncut and with all (or most) of the music intact!",1220400000,3,403,4.0886075949367084
3442945,5,B0019N8P2W,Daria is one of the best animated series.  It's insane that they have not released the entire series on DVD yet.  Please allow me to add it to my collection!!!,1218758400,,159,4.266666666666667
3442946,5,B0019N8P2W,i really wish they would bring daria back and on to dvd really soon. I haven't seen it in forever and really miss it. I used to watch it all the time.,1218499200,,150,3.71875
3442947,5,B0019N8P2W,"Having been a fan of ""Daria"" since its second season in 1998, I've been hoping for years that a full DVD release would be forthcoming.  Sadly, I've seen such promises come and go, so I won't be holding my breath for this one (though I'd really like it to be true).

As many people probably already suspect, ""Daria's"" long absence from the DVD market can likely be blamed on one major stumbling block: music clearance issues.  Each episode used roughly a dozen or so portions of songs in its soundtrack; spread that over five years (thirteen episodes a year) and two TV movies, and it adds up.  Obviously, MTV only obtained broadcast clearances for these songs, without considering video distribution (which needs separate clearances), and I don't think there's any chance in hell that they're going to renegotiate--and, more tellingly, pay more money--for them.  (The other big reason, of course, is that MTV has always treated ""Daria"" like a three-headed bastard stepchild, one that it would prefer to forget as quickly as possible...)

If we ever see (non-bootleg) ""Daria"" episodes on DVD, you can be sure that they'll either have the music replaced with generic filler (which will definitely affect scenes which relied on specific music for impact), or there will be no music at all (like the bonus episodes on the ""Is It Fall Yet?"" and ""Is It College Yet?"" DVDs).  But, I guess that's better than not having them at all, or worse, having them butchered like the first season of ""WKRP in Cincinnati"".",1217894400,2,1503,4.84765625
3442948,5,B0019N8P2W,"Daria is by far one of my favorite tv shows of all time. It was probably one of the most loved and influential shows of my teenage/adulthood and I check all the time for word of MTV finally releasing it. Please, for the love of all that is holy, release this in a set on DVD. I would pay out the nose for the collection.",1216425600,4,320,3.9384615384615387

8274824,4,B0019N8P2W,Perfect! The only let down was that it replaces the original music played through out the show with stock music. But it's not a huge deal.,1525392000,,138,4.346153846153846
8274825,5,B0019N8P2W,Love Daria!!! This is the set you want. It has every episode made.,1525132800,,66,4.153846153846154

8274828,5,B0019N8P2W,"Aside from the barely-noticed replaced music, this DVD set was everything I expected it to be. Marathon the series while packing for a move and will probably watch it again later. Really happy I bought this!",1524614400,,207,4.777777777777778
