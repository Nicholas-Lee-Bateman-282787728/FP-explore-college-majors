My intro to the great man came through watching ""Grave of the Vampire"" on a beat-up, well-worn, kicked-across-the-road VHS tape that some creepy people gave me when I was a young and impressionable 20-anything-year-old. HOLY MINESTRONE, that movie lifted my wig, and I wasn't even bald (still not, but I cannot grow a beard of any volume or capacity to save my life, either, for what it's worth, so I have been known to sport a chin-wig at opportune moments and/or events of esteemed significance).

Michael Pataki played Caleb Croft in that one, and the venerable (in B-movie circles, anyway) William Smith playedbut wait, I don't want to take ANYTHING away from anyone's first-time-viewing-experience of that psychically exasperating event (insert knowing cackles of fiendish glee here), just see ""Grave of the Vampire"" (now readily available on disc) or don't because I rarely follow my own advice, but I LOVED it and have seen it over and over and over, so there's a chance I may be right in this particular instance.

Anyway, after ordering a copy of Stephen Thrower's ""Nightmare USA"" book a few years ago, I locked myself in the laboratory (or was it the lavatory?) and plunged in with my monstrous magnifying device and read and read and read and read and read and read and read and read and read and read and read and read until I FINALLY got to page 247 where I STRUCK SOLID INFORMATION PLATINUM because therein began the life, tales, and history of the irreplaceable and always-interesting director John Hayes.

When I say history, I mean including a complete detailed filmography inclusive of the 2 movies on this DVD, which at the time I never expected to ever have access to, proving beyond any doubt that Vinegar Syndrome is here for us! You! Me! Them! The People! All of us!

These cranium-bending epics enhanced my mood, tickled the funbone and gave me new hope for the thing that might be called tomorrow. Don't you believe that it ain't so, or you might miss out and then you'll be in sorrow and worse yet, ignorance. It happens every day, and sometimes per minute. Just look outside your window.

Heck, when I reflect back on all the films I snubbed in my mispent youth because they didn't star Candice Rialson that I now would give my nose-teeth forphew, sister/brother, you don't even want to get me started verbally scaling that mountain of misery and terrible torment.

So, like Lux Interior used to say, ""saddle-up-a-buzz-buzz"", whatever that means (or merely enjoy a soft drink if you must), and do what thou tilt.

Me? I'll be sitting here studying the merits of ""Sweet Trash"" and ""The Hangup"" until eternity (or fternity, or gternity, or hternity, or iternity, or jternity, or kternity, and so on and so forth). Look me up when I get back and travel unscathed until that time (I miss your extra eye already).",1527724800,,3057,4.776515151515151
8721248,2,B01019PN4M,"I bought this dvd cause the local movie geek theater chain was pumping it with a screening of Sweet Trash. They'd entered into some sort of agreement with Vinegar Syndrome. I get why they did and I get why the well ran dry quick.

Sweet Trash is soft core porn. Realistically, it's soft core made for guys in raincoats back in the day when movie theaters were much stickier and Rudy Gulliani hadn't torn them all down. Soft core (hard core too) is not my cup of tea. Thankfully, Sweet Trash has just a little more going for it than most in the sense that it's soft core that possibly has ambition buried under mounds of lazy nudity. The film is about a guy who is an alcoholic having a fever dream that the mob is run by a computer and he's the new target due to gambling debts. It gets slowly but surely more Philip K Dick/Alain Robbe-Grillet like as the film goes on. It even has some effective moments and a well done shoot out sequence. Unfortunately, it's all buried under a thick layer of that listless and frankly sad nudity. Nobody looks happy to be naked. Nobody looks all that great naked either. Their attempts at sexy actually give the film a sad reality. Women are trophies for substance addicted animals in the criminal world. You get that sense here to a T. The good bits also add up to around 20 minutes of the 70 or so minute run time. The 70 minutes or so being b-roll, sad dance sequences, sad sex sequences, and over long establishing shots. The 20 minutes aren't easily forgotten but are a trial to get to.

The Hang up is slightly less dirty and just as weird. It involves maybe vice cops (nothing in either movie is all that clear cause it's about getting to the nudity) making the nudity make a little bit more sense but not by much. It feels like a half baked early Abel Ferrera film but without the love/hate relationship with Catholicism. Again, it's undone by the sad, lifeless, and unclothed bodies on screen.

I get the interest in these films. Was the director a secret talent chugging out nudie flixs to make the rent or was he a sod all perv who found an easy way to get youngish looking women naked that lucked into some interesting moments? He definitely has his moments as a director and approaches an even more pretentious Andy Milligan at times. It's a cheap DVD and your mileage will vary but I don't think the answer would be satisfying either way.",1475798400,5,2388,4.4104308390022675
