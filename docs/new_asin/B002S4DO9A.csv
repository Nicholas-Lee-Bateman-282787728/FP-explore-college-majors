8379029,4,B002S4DO9A,"I purchased this item for my boyfriend who has nearly every motorcycle racing DVD out there. He really enjoyed the overview of the different teams and their evolution. The music was a little cheesey, but didn't really interfere with the movie overall.",1270771200,,251,5.0
8379030,1,B002S4DO9A,"All of my official MotoGP DVD releases have been high quality.  Faster was superb, doctor tornado and kentucky kid was pretty darn good too, the official yearly season reviews are all solid, so I had high hopes for this technical documentary.
It was a huge letdown.  It's firstly very formulaic and lacks any kind of emotion or interest in the subject.  Each 5 minute segment on the manufacturer starts with the same corny backdrop of the bike with some basic technical specs written on screen with 80's computer music playing.  Then a basic overview of the bikes layout is given , then a team boss gives vague technical goals and achievements of each years layout.  Absolutely nothing is learned from this dvd that the yearly press releases from MotoGP teams doesn't already give you.
It never gets in depth at all, basic terms are given, they talk about computer aided performance but never get into the details of what it all does or even show you a computer sensor.
To a MotoGP fan the technical specs and performance technology of the bikes are fascinating and the makers of this DVD didn't share that interest nor could they be bothered to do any kind of research or information gathering.  It seems as though the entire DVD is made up of interviews gathered in one evening after a qualifying session.
The special features are a joke, each piece is a static interview lasting about two minutes.
The entire production feels very cheaply made and thrown together.  There's a lot of talking about performance with edited together clips of the bike that has little to do with what's being talked about.
I would advise you not to buy this dvd as if you are even a casual MotoGP follower you will learn nothing new from it.
Thanks to the $25 (including shipping and taxes) I spent on this very cheaply made and low quality dvd, I'll question whether to buy an official MotoGP film again.
The only decent part of the whole dvd is the last few chapters where they give a little bit of info about proton, KR, ilmor and the other upstart teams that came in and died very quickly in the 4-stroke era.  Those too are still very short on details or interest in the subject though.",1265587200,9,2173,4.596899224806202
8379031,1,B002S4DO9A,"I bought this DVD expecting to learn about the challenges of bringing ever increasing power to the road, about electronics, engine layout and architecture, about the changing regulations,  etc, etc....
What a disappointment.
None of the above. Actually I have forgotten already what is was about : some tame and lame, generic PR blah blah like ""honda remains committed to racing"", ""changes for 2008 were: improved traction, better stability, increased turn in..."" (that's what I say about MY road bike after some suspension set-up or bling...)  It goes on like that, unbelievable absence of content or matter, brand after brand with remarkably little variation.
What a waste of money - and time.",1263859200,3,695,5.196428571428571
