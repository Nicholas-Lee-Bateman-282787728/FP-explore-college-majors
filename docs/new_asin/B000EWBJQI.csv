2541621,5,B000EWBJQI,"I put off purchasing this DVD because it wasn't the original Timmy or Jeff.  I'm sorry I waited so long.  This is a MARVELOUS series and I'm really impressed by it.  There are so many episodes - it will keep me watching for a long time.  The story lines are great, the characters are real, and I'm most impressed with the traditional moral messages in each episode.  If you're a Lassie lover, you'll definitely want to order this DVD.  You won't be disappointed.  Little Corey who portrays Timmy is a superb young actor.  And this Lassie descendent - well what can I say, she'll steal your heart as usual.",1405296000,4,605,4.486238532110092

2541623,5,B000EWBJQI,"I was going through my old video tape recordings when I came across this Lassie episode with Cory Sevier, which I apparently recorded when I had the Animal Planet Network.  I was so over whelmed with the episode, I went online to find ""The  Complete First Season of Lassie"" at Amazon.  .  A beautiful production of Lassie for this generation. Excellent acting and filming with amusing episodes. It seems so real to life and amazes me how well Lassie performs.  I rate this version of ""Lassie""  with a 5 Star Rating.",1391299200,4,515,4.604395604395604
2541624,5,B000EWBJQI,"I ordered  this by accident, meaning to order the original series.  It turns out that this is the 1997 series which used to run on Animal Planet.  I had actually searched for this series on DVD and had given up on finding it.  I love this version of Lassie, and I'm so pleased to finally have it. :)",1386547200,12,299,4.103448275862069
2541625,5,B000EWBJQI,"Everyone who's anyone remembers the close affinity between the first Timmy
and Lassie, even though it was a male dog/dogs. Many animals are used to
get that 'feel' and 'look' that production wants. But unless they are using
twins (e.g. Cole and Dylan Sprouse in early movies) there is only one
Cory Sevier.  And this set of episodes in the first season shows not only
how talented the direction/production team is, but more so, how talented
this young man is. Of course he is a man now, but the boy is the father
of the man: and Cory Sevier was a marvelous Timmy.  The series updated the
original show to the modern world, but the story between a boy and his dog
is eternal, and this is due largely to the 'largesse' of Cory Sevier. The
lad can act. Boy-and-his-dog aside, Cory Sevier shows emotions that only
a talented actor can show. One 'feels' his heartaches, his joy, his overwhelming
love for his dog and his family, friends, and people in general as he tries
to grow up in today's world of heartache, pain, love, and friendship.
The world need more of this today, and not just in acting.",1373846400,16,1095,4.49748743718593

8114826,5,B000EWBJQI,"I cannot believe what a gem of a series this is which could not have happened without a really good child actor like Corey Sevier, who plays the main character Timmy. By the time I watched the second episode, I was hooked. What great acting and originality in each of the 26 episodes! This series has a really great supporting cast, great directing, and really great original scripts full of humor and drama, and was, of course, produced in Canada, a bastion of really great quality entertainment. All episodes revolve around life in a small town in the modern world of 1997 where bullies, computers, and contraband are dealt with brilliantly by the script and screen writers.",1454025600,3,676,4.786324786324786
8114827,5,B000EWBJQI,I wish they would come out with the complete series of lassie instead of only certain ones maybe if enough people complain then they would I know I be one of them just a thought,1433980800,2,177,4.085714285714285
8114828,5,B000EWBJQI,"This is one fantastic season of LASSIE that I thoroughly enjoyed. So so very happy to have it on DVD!! This particular dog is so beautiful and so sweet, it really makes the show. Course I love this Timmy and his Mom. Great family fare especially for those with kids, but I will enjoy it long after all my kids are gone.",1433376000,3,319,4.161290322580645
