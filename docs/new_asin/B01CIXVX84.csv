7683893,5,B01CIXVX84,"First off, season 6 is a solid addition to the series.  Veras new DS, Aiden (from season 5) is settling into his role and establishing himself as a strong investigator in his own right.  SPOILER: Another principal character, however, is not going to make it to the end of the season.  This character will be missed, but not to worry; the character left to join the cast of an American show and, thus, will still be available to us.

Season 6 consists of four 90-minute episodes: Dark Road, Tuesdays Child, The Moth Catcher and The Sea Glass.  These stories take us into the dark Northumberland woods, a dark Northumberland cave, a stately 18thc home and into the lives of those who go down to the sea in ships.  The landscapes are stunning, as always, fitting backdrops to the stories and the characters words and actions.  While there are some slight variations in the cast, as noted above, the basic team stays in place.  Guest appearances, particularly by leading British character actors, are kept to a minimum.  Note: one of the attractive characteristics of the Vera series is that prominent guest actors are not necessarily villains and perpetrators, as is often the case on other shows.

Brenda Blethyns chops are all intact.  If anything she gets shrewder and shrewder with each performance.  Her signature line (Mm) is uttered with more and more meaning and intensity.  Season 6 is a must-have for all Vera fans.

Final point: I am able to review this now because I purchased it from Amazon in the U.K., where the price is approximately half of that which will be charged in America.  I advise all of my readers to purchase an all-regions player.  Amazon (in the U.S.) sells them and they are modestly priced.  I have two made by Pioneer, with an average price of approximately $100 and I have been very pleased with them.  They enable you to see early releases of your favorite international shows and they also enable you to comparison-shop, so that the player pays for itself very quickly.  They are now simple to use.  They do not need to be programmed for a specific region; you simply pop in the disc; the player reads the code and starts the show.",1458950400,51,2164,4.674603174603175

7683898,4,B01CIXVX84,"""Vera"" Series 6 continues in much the same vein as previous series. Brenda Blethyn carries the show as middle-aged, curmudgeonly DCI Vera Stanhope of the fictional Northumberland & City Police, investigating homicides on the North England coast. She has softened a bit, though. Vera attempts sympathy toward her officers and abstains from outright bullying these days. Most of the cast returns from Series 5, but there is one key cast change: DC Bethany Whelan (Cush Jumbo) is replaced by DC Hicham Cherradi (Noof McEwan). DC Kenny Lockhart (Jon Morrison) seems to be a permanent fixture. All of the murders and their solutions revolve around family this season to the point that one might be skeptical of the value of family after watching these mysteries. Episodes are 90 minutes. DVDs (Acorn 2016) include optional English subtitles and an episode summary on each disc.

The episodes are:

""Dark Road"": The body of 56-year-old Anne-Marie Richards is found on the Northumberland moor, having died of a heart attack triggered by strangulation. The dead woman's daughters are Nicole McKenzie (Kelly Gough), a local schoolteacher, and Christine (Faye Marsay), who is recovering from a drug addiction. When DCI Stanhope, DS Healy, and DC Whelan investigate, they find that Ms. Richards had a sporadic relationship with a traveling businessman who saw her the night that she died, and a reputation for flirting with younger men at a pub where she occasionally worked. A feud over some neglected horses made her very unpopular with neighbor Bob Tate (Robert Blythe) and called into question the role of her son-in-law, Nicole's husband, veterinarian Simon (Daniel Ings) in attesting that the horses needed to be put down.

""Tuesday's Child"": Two teenaged hikers find a body bound in garbage bags in a cave at a rural hangout called ""Lover's Corner."" It is the body of Jamie Thorne, a young man estranged from his family and working at a seasonal amusement park owned by the Pevensey family. He had been hit from behind with a blunt object, twice, and was in possession of a necklace with a large cross pendant. Vera is puzzled to find that Jamie's mother Grace Marsh (Jo Hartley) had objected to him returning home when he wanted to. Jamie shared a camper with another young man, Harris Kirk (Ben-Ryan Davies), while he worked at Pevensey's, and he spent the off-season with the family of a local vicar, Rev. George Haleford (Joe Dixon), whose son Brendan, about the same age, had some drug and petty crime problems that had estranged him from his father.

""The Moth Catcher"": A student in her early twenties, Alex Gartside (Rachel Slattery), is found by the side of the road in the valley, the victim of a hit and run. She was house-sitting at a nearby country estate, on whose property she set up a collection of moth traps that she was studying. When DCI Stanhope and DS Healy investigate the home, they find an unidentified man in the parlor, stabbed to death and identified only by a bus ticket from Bebington. Did Miss Gartside kill him, or was the man the intended target? Did her bipolar disorder play a role? She fled the house in the direction of the lane. As the detectives try to track down the dead man, hoping that he will lead to the identity of the killer, the new guy, DC Hicham Cherradi (Noof McEwan) proves himself an eager beaver. DS Healy anxiously awaits the arrival of his new baby.

""The Sea Glass"": A fishing vessel in the North Sea catches the body of Thomas Stonnall in its nets. The Stonnall family own a couple of trawlers. Thomas had been missing for six weeks but only dead for 24 hours when he was pulled from the water, killed by a blow to the head. DCI Stanhope and DS Healy set about finding out where Thomas has been for the past six weeks. He had been depressed and not himself since the death of his wife, and he was blamed by the rival Connock family for a fish market fire in which Joe Connock was killed. Thomas' eldest son Steve (Ciarin Griffiths) runs the business now, while emotionally troubled Lee (Philip Hill-Pearson) is quick to blame the Connocks for his father's death. When Vera finds Thomas' wallet and some blood in a van rented by trawler captain Michael Quinn (Alex Ferns) at Blythe Point, she begins to suspect greater criminal activities.",1516838400,,4292,4.7867746288798925
7683899,5,B01CIXVX84,Vera is always good. The crabby old gal keeps things going with insight and nerve while motivating her investigative team to perform beyond the call of duty. The only negative thing is that she keeps losing team members. Kenny is the only member who stays around. I introduced Vera to my daughter and son-in-law this past Christmas and they both stayed awake through the whole episode. That says something.,1514764800,,406,4.898550724637682

The detective's assistant in season 6 is different and we were disappointed by that, but he fits in very well.

7683987,5,B01CIXVX84,"It is always a treat to visit with Vera Stanhope, the DCI who brings a solid and exacting skill to solving crimes. Brenda Blethyn is simply brilliant, infusing her character with compassion and determination. When she calls you ""pet,"" she's not always aiming to be endearing. This season's four stories, each running 90 minutes, bring author Ann Cleeves' crime novels to vivid life, set on the moors of Northumberland, desolate but scenic. One case turns especially intense for Vera, whose rough and exacting standards sometimes exasperate her team. No spoilers, because each story deserves to be enjoyed in full--something the smart production team at Acorn knows and thus doesn't offer detailed descriptions that give away too much at the start of each episode. For Vera and her right hand man DS Aiden Healy (Kenny Doughty)There are twists and subtle clues in each of these plotlines--the baffling double murder, the missing worker at a traveling carnival, the woman lying out on the moors and the man who's pulled from the sea. In each case, Vera brings her talent and tenacity to finding justice for the victim. If only Vera caught more cases each season, we'd be thrilled to follow along in her footsteps.",1470009600,,1211,5.0

Moreover, we highly recommend BBC programming to family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues. We pre-ordered Season 6 of ""Vera"" months ago. It was well worth the wait as with previous ""Vera"" Series (*****). Our local PBS station won't show ""Vera,"" so we typically catch an episode on another PBS (and more financially stable and more viewer centered) station in another state while traveling. ""Vera"" is an extraordinary series, well written, directed, performed, edited, and the cinematography is superb (scenes are like fine art). We acknowledge the musicians for their scores as well. We are deeply appreciative of all those who seemingly are working in concert with another to bring such fine programming into our home. Thank you! We know many fans of ""Vera"" in our community and state (AZ). Keep on evolving!!! We look forward to Season 7, hoping there will be another; hoping as we always do at the end of a previous season of ""Vera.""",1467504000,9,1078,4.9944444444444445

7684007,5,B01CIXVX84,"I am always happy to see another series of VERA.  I have loved the series from the beginning and try to tell as many people as I can who like mysteries and police procedurals as well as British television to watch and collect this show.  Vera Stanhope (Brenda Blethyn)  is the Detective Chief Inspector of a northern England police department.  She is no Miss Marple, or  even Hetty Wainthrop, she is a dedicated policewoman who has seen it all and can be harsh with and critical of her staff.  She is sharp and intuitive and watching her solve a case is enthralling.  She cares about what she does, and about the people around her, she just doesn't like to show this to anyone.  In this series there are four mysteries or cases, the first is to do with the murder of a grandmother whose body is found in a remote part of the moors.  The second is the murder of a young man who has ties to both a religious group and a carnival, the third is the murder of a young man who has been house sitting, and the fourth a fisherman found tangled in nets.  Each mystery is different, and the viewer travels with Vera down the paths of clues to figure out who has done this and why.  Friends and family are alternately victims and suspects, and man's inhumanity to man is evident in abundance.  It is a chilling world, but the viewer is very glad that Vera is on the case, as truth will be told and justice will be done.  These are the type of mysteries that can be watched multiple times, the stories are well constructed and the characters convincing, on top of this, the scenery is as much of a presence as any of the actors.  Well crafted production and one of our favorites.",1467072000,,1668,4.321543408360129
7684008,5,B01CIXVX84,"Vera, Set 6.  In this megahit  television series, British mysteries  made by ITV, two-time Oscar nominee Brenda Blethyn (PRIDE & PREJUDICE, SECRETS & LIES) returns as DCI Vera Stanhope. Cantankerous, solitary, obsessed, caustic, brilliant investigator, a bit disheveled; think female Columbo.

Set amid the wild beauty of the Northumberland landscape,  Vera and her trusted team, led by Kenny Doughty (STELLA, SNOWPIERCER, BLACK WORK) as  Detective Sergeant Joe Ashworth, solve four all-new feature length mysteries in this police procedural. The episodes are:

1. Dark Road. A young girl finds the body of a 56-year-old woman on the bleak moors. The team scrutinizes the victim's family members to discover their secrets or lies.
2. Tuesday's Child. A young man's remains are found in a remote cave where local teens go to party. The detectives soon discover that he worked at the Pevensey's Travelling Fairground, had a chaotic family life.
3. The Moth Catcher.  A young woman named Alex is killed in a hit-and run accident. While they search for clues at the remote country manor that Alex was house-sitting, the detectives find another body.
4. The Sea Glass. The body of a missing fisherman is pulled from the sea, tangled in the nets of a sea trawler, Vera must dig into a tight-knit fishing community.

The entertainment is enhanced by  strong performances, beautifully shot landscapes, high production values. Demonstrates an awareness of the sadness, desolation of murder on the souls it leaves behind. Was inspired by the bestselling novels of renowned crime writer Ann Cleeves, creator of the Shetland, as well as the Vera series. The third episode, The Moth Catcher, is based on Cleeves September 2015 novel of the same name, seventh in her Vera Stanhope work.

Blethyn displays the ferocious range of her acting chops, carries the series manfully. The star delivers a powerhouse performance, has proven to be nothing less than a TV institution (Mail on Sunday, UK). She is here ably supported by, in addition to Doughty, Kingsley Ben-Adir, (MIDSOMER MURDERS) and  Cush Jumbo, (THE GOOD WIFE). The mysteries are many-layered, complex, knowledgeably set in the desolate places and nicer neighborhoods of North East England, forever known as Geordie Land. The seagoing puzzler is set in Grimsby, an ancient (Roman remains found, later settled by Danish Vikings) North Sea fishing port  that has somehow resisted quaintness. The boxed set, which I was given in expectation of an honest, unbiased review, consists of four episodes on four discs, totals approximately 370 minutes.  Thank goodness, it has subtitles, for those of us not up on Geordie-speak.  Beware, sensitive souls or family viewers, it contains strong language, mature themes, violence, disturbing images. If it seems like Ive been telling you forever that I love a female-headed mystery, I have.  And if it seems like Ive been telling you forever that I love Vera, I have and I do.  And this particular set is powerful, memorable, emotional, riveting watching.",1466899200,2,3036,5.201232032854209
7684009,5,B01CIXVX84,"DCI Vera Stanhope rules over the murder squad in the Northumberland and City Police, on the northeast coast of England. It has the ocean and the moors on one side, and gently rolling farmland with few trees inland. It always looks cold. Vera trumbles around in her favorite raincoat and hat, with at least one scarf wrapped around her neck.  There's over 90 minutes per episode, which gives a lot of time to tell complicated stories and characters. This is a show of excellent mystery viewing.

....Episode 1 ""Dark Road"" A girl finds a dead body near the road, out in the middle of nowhere. Actually, all the roads on ""Vera"" look out in the middle of nowhere. When they identify the victim, Vera goes to her house, where food is on the counter and the bed is half made. Vera muses: ""Looks like the Marie-Celeste.""
....Episode 2 ""Tuesday's Child"" Local teenagers use a rare copse as a drinking hide-away. Richard and Matthew had imbibed to the full and collapsed the night before. They wake at dawn with no transportation, so they decide to check out a near-by cave, which looks like a neolithic grave mound. Matt remembers stories his Gran told, of trolls that live in the caves. But instead of a troll, they find a body wrapped in garbage bags.
Monday's child is fair of face, Tuesday's child is full of grace, Wednesday's child is full of woe, Thursday's child has far to go.
....Episode 3 ""The Moth Catcher"" A Cambridge masters student is found dead of a hit & run on the side of a wood. Her Grandad tells Vera, ""She's a nebby one."" I had to look this up: British dialectic for ""sharp-natured"". What is a woman with a grudge doing housesitting in Gilswick Valley and setting up moth catchers, when her masters theses has nothing to do with moths?
....Episode 4 ""The Sea Glass"" The trawler Sanrene chugs into port on a calm night with a bright moon. Everyone on board looks tense and dour. That's because they had to leave off fishing when their nets pulled up a dead body. Turns out he was reported missing 6 weeks ago. But he's only been dead for 24 hours.
Marcus, the forensic pathologist tells Vera, ""I'd say it's a suspicious death.""
Vera smiles and he chuckles, ""Don't look so pleased.""

""Vera Series 6"" originally aired in January/February 2016. We get four episodes totaling 370 minutes. The DVD presents the show in 16:9 widescreen and stereo. English SDH subtitles are available. There are no bonus extras on the DVD.

The Vera TV series is based on the characters in the mystery novels by Ann Cleeves. (Who also gave us the ""Shetland"" TV series.)

Happy Reader",1465430400,2,2776,4.8604651162790695
7684010,5,B01CIXVX84,"Before I post my review Id like to comment briefly on spoilers that seem to be included in a lot of reviews here of British or Australian (and Canadian too) Mystery or crime series. People come to mystery shows because they want to be surprised. And yet some other reviewers not only post the plot line for each episode (now why would you care?) as well as telling you who will die or leave in that season. I don't know how others feel but you will NEVER read similar plot points from me.  Im guessing that the folks at Acorn feel that way too since  at least for Season 6 of Vera, the plot summary doesnt appear on the screen before you play the episode. You have to choose plot summary if you want.

Okay, now on to Vera. (The Season 6 is not available in US version until June 28th but I was provided with an advance copy for an objective review). If you are coming to this review I think I can assume that you have seen the other five previous volumes. If not, I encourage you to search for Volume 1 and move forward. (Acorn is even releasing a set with Seasons 1-5 at a good price. Assuming youve watched the others, you know Officer Very Stanhope and how she works to solve crimes. The crime happens at the beginning Vera uses intuition (and here small (5-6 person) staff to solve it by the end of each episode (there are four episodes- each lasting 92 minutes  on the four DVDs.). There is plenty of graphic violence but I don't remember hearing any graphic language. Vera reminds me of Peter Falks character Columbo. She is frumpy and clothes are often wrinkled and she has a way of asking and after question. We don't see her personal life and  in fact  we know little about the personal lives of her staff (yes a few things pop up but they really have no bearing on the case or the show.).

Some of the episodes are based on the Vera novels, but not all  and, honestly  I didn't care about the source. And the plots can sometimes be confusing. Even there, I cared less about the actors who were in just one episode and used Vera as my central interest. Brenda Blethyn (Vera) just inhabits the role. And the English countryside looks great on a 42in TV screen.

There are no bonuses on the DVD set  no behind the scenes or interviews. Just the four stories.

If youve loved the series so far, I know youll want this one when released (be patient).

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7684011,5,B01CIXVX84,"I fell in love with Vera at series ONE. DCI Vera Stanhope is rough, untidy, obsessed. She wears a Mackintosh & floppy hat. She's a female Contemporary Columbo. She's a determined murder sleuth, aging but tough enough, most days. Characters are adapted after Ann Cleeves mysteries. The Northumberland filming locale & settings are an enchanting backdrop, but crime riddled. Cases are as violent as the country is ruggedly beautiful. Stories are brilliantly writer.
There is a One through Five set now releasing, perfect for the person beginning with Vera. All are certainly worth owning on DVD for viewing multiple times.

Brenda Blethyn (Atonement, Pride & Prejudice) as Vera, convincingly leads the team. Forensics via Dr Marcus Summer (Kingsley Ben-Adir). DC Aiden Healy (Kenny Doughty). DC Mark Edwards (Riley Jones). DC Kenny Lockhart (Jon Morrison). Strong acting and vivid drama in every episode.

SUBTITLES available/optional, episodes are stand-alone stories and come with big guest stars.
1==Dark Road ==A 56-year-old grandmothers body is located on the wild, lonely Northumberland moors. Ronald Pickup (Best Exotic Marigold Hotel x2) as Kipland. Cush Jumbo ends her run on Vera as DC Whelan. Lisa Hammond (Bleak House) back for the first 3 eps as Helen Milton.

7684012,5,B01CIXVX84,"I have seen all 6 seasons of Vera and this one, in many respects, may be the best yet. Aside from the brain twisting murder mysteries (4 of them listed below), all of the production values have been upgraded and enhanced. Additionally, Vera herself looks as though she has shed some poundage, gotten a new do, appears a bit less rumpled, and is now prone to being more emotionally reactive to the crimes that she has to investigate as well as to her fellow colleagues in the Detective Bureau. But what still stands out is Vera's relentless bulldog pursuit of the guilty party; and, in the end, she always gets her man or woman. Her new sidekick Aiden (played by the always dependable Kenny Doughty in his second season, replacing David Leon also an excellent actor) is her number two man on the force and reliable leg man - though Vera is no slouch in the physical department when it comes to chasing after the ""bad guys"".

In this season, even though the setting and action still takes place in the Northumberland area, we no longer have to endure what always came across as a rural wintry scene with sparsely any habitation. The general landscape is now highly colorful and investigations take place in more urban districts showing multiple residences, avenues, and autos. Even a park scene is utilized. DCI Vera (who I like to think of as a kind of female Columbo) drives her subordinates onward seeking answers.  From her medical examiner on up, Vera is determined to catch whoever is guilty. She never gives up. The types of crimes and various characters are based upon the original creations of ""renowned crime writer Ann Cleeves"". The fun (if you can call it that) of watching these mystery episodes is the twists and turns that they take. ""Learn to expect the unexpected.""  It's like having the pieces of a large jigsaw puzzle dumped in front of you with no guiding picture and then forced to properly connect all the pieces in order to see that picture and solve the crime.  What is always a plus is the fact that Vera & Co. always get plenty of HARD EVIDENCE in the end to make their case and make it stick. This is not Perry Mason or Hercule Poirot (with all due respect to Raymond Burr and Agatha Christie) where a criminal breaks down in the face of what should be properly considered to be only circumstantial evidence and theory, and then confesses all. These are challenging episodes, fully explained throughout and in the conclusion with not a single loophole. The viewer is not cheated and the murderer is invariably quite a surprise. BE SURE AND USE THE SUB-TITLES!

Now to the episodes (NO SPOILERS HERE!): #1 - The Dark Road - a female body is discovered near a roadway by a young girl of around 10 who immediately races to a nearby pub and informs the authorities. Enter Vera & Co. Who was the murder victim, why was she murdered, why was the victim shoeless, why was her body found in a woody/grassy area, who could have done it? The title of this episode - The Dark Road - in my opinion, is both a metaphor for the pathway leading to the mystery's solution as well the place near which the murder occurred.

Episode #2 - Tuesday's Child -  Two young men, who awake in the midst of a wooded area after falling asleep following a hike, come upon the body of a dead teenage boy who was wrapped in plastic bags and partially hidden in a cave. Why was this young man murdered, why was he where he was, who did it, why was the body treated the way it was, why did a nearby patch of earth look as though someone was  trying to dig in it? This is only the beginning of a circuitous hunt for the killer.

Episode #3 - The Moth Catcher - Two murders, one of a young female college researcher found along a roadside and one of an elderly gentleman found in a remote country home, become the focus of Vera & Co. Are the two deaths related in any way? Why were moths being captured by a special lamp placed in various locales?

Episode #4 - The Sea Glass - This episode takes place along the North Sea coast. The body of a fisherman is found floating in the waters and hauled on to a boat. Who is he? Was it an accident or was he murdered? If so, who could have done it and why? Why was one of the nearby boats burned later on? There are many suspects but no motive. But leave it to Vera & Co. They won't stop fishing in these waters (pardon the pun) until the crime is solved.  Don't bet against Vera.

Final suggestion: A glass of wine or scotch along with popcorn is a most enjoyable companion while watching these episodes. Savor them. Don't rush to see them all in one or even two sittings. See if you can solve the crime before Vera, et al.",1464307200,12,4657,4.396051103368176
7684013,5,B01CIXVX84,"DCI Vera Stanhope of Northumberland is my kind of detective. In this series 6 she has a new haircut, which is more akin to wind blown and the absence of a hairbrush. She dresses for warmth, not style, although her raincoat is fashionable, and her sturdy shoes look as if they are handmade. All this discussion of her sense or lack of style is necessary to get the full picture of this detective. She is someone you feel you can trust, however, you cannot pull the wool over her. She knows when you are lying. Vera is down to earth, dresses for warmth, eats when she can, drinks more often, and her life as a DCI is her life.

Brenda Blethyn plays Vera, and she is absolutely brilliant. She has the ability to transform herself into Vera, her actions, her speech and her essence demand respect. In this series we are privy to more information about Vera's life, as she relays bits and pieces to her new DS Aiden.  There is a sad incident with one of the characters, and this is part of the series 6.

Series 6 as usual, provides the best in acting, writing and directing. The episodes are all new and reality driven. We can see this happening in any neighborhood. These episodes take place in Northumberland, the moors, the desolate places and the nicer neighborhoods. Vera has a cast of characters who are all put in their place, she wants them to work harder, do more, bring in the clues and help solve the crimes. In series 6 there are four 90 minute episodes, Dark Road, Tuesday's Child, The Moth Catcher, and The Sea Glass. I am such a fan of Brends Blythyn and Vera, and I look forward to each episode.
