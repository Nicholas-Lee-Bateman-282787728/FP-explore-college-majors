Now I opened it and can't return it. So beware if you want the dub amazon does not carry it, I also don't believe it has been dubbed yet.",1367971200,6,309,3.9047619047619047

5627769,5,B00BJ3AQJ2,"""I once was lost, but now am found, was blind, but now I see.""

As a young child, Kanata Sorami got lost and was rescued by a beautiful blonde military officer playing a haunting rendition of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazing-Grace/dp/B004KMDBGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazing Grace</a>&nbsp;on a trumpet, which changed her life.  Now at 15, she has joined the Helvetian Army as a bugler shortly after the beginning of a shaky ceasefire following several years of war with the neighboring Holy Roman Empire and has been assigned to the all female 1121st tank platoon, an all but forgotten military unit (they have to go into various businesses for themselves in order to earn money because the government frequently forgets to supply or pay them), equipped with a nonfunctioning ancient spider tank, stationed in the so-called Clock Tower Fortress across a bridge from the tiny old town of Seize, just inside the border of the Helvetian Republic and adjacent to the uninhabited (and apparently uninhabitable) No Man's Land.  With her boundless optimism and childlike enthusiasm, Kanata hits this sleepy little town and garrison something like a bomb, shocking, even repelling some comrades and townspeople initially, many of whom are stuck in pits of despair from deep emotional wounds got in battle or otherwise.

Gradually, almost inadvertently, she begins to win them over and helps said wounds to start healing or to heal faster, and there is a lot of healing needed here: several young orphans of war and other things, lots of people who've lost family and friends, a soldier somewhat willingly mistaken for a hero until forced to live up to it, a lone survivor of an annihilated military unit haunted by PTSD and survivor guilt, a younger sibling who has never gotten over the untimely death of a beloved older sibling and as a result is hiding out and avoiding responsibility, an unknowing war criminal unable to forgive herself, and a young soldier determined to always be the strong one until cracking under the strain.  Early episodes are mostly lighthearted except for a certain underlying melancholy that permeates the series, a lingering sadness over the technology, knowledge, people, and even land that the world has lost, but events are building to a climax.  When a plot to sabotage the sputtering peace talks is discovered, it falls to the modern day Fortress Maidens, a local legend that comes in more than one conflicting version, to risk everything to try to foil it.

This looks and feels like an early Miyazaki effort, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nausica-auml-of-the-Valley-of-the-Wind/dp/B004CRR9G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Wind</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Castle-in-the-Sky/dp/B007JNTOBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Castle in the Sky</a>&nbsp;(not to mention shout outs to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/K-On/dp/B00XZZMY2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">K-On</a>).  In all three cases you have an alternate, post apocalyptic Earth in which high technology has been lost, great swaths of the world poisoned, and remnant humans are left trying to determine the best path to the future... or whether there is any sort of future at all, and in all three we only scratch the surface of truly fascinating worlds.  Through it all weaves an excellent score and several instrumental renditions of Amazing Grace at critical moments.  Mercifully, the expected anti-war and pro-environment message is muted and rational, something that is not always the case these days.  Destroying all life in the seas and poisoning vast swaths of land is obviously bad so no need for extra preaching, and there is nothing in the subtle anti-war message that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Stuart-Mill/dp/1605203890/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Stuart Mill</a>&nbsp;would have a problem with *.

Defects?  Only some minor nits.  The pacing seems a little off with slow moving, languorous episodes in the beginning and frantic, rapid fire episodes at the end, and though this makes a certain amount of dramatic and narrative sense, it makes the ending feel rushed and the 13th episode OVA absolutely necessary.  This series could easily have been twice as long without feeling like it had been stretched too thin.  In addition the ""ghost"" that appears several times in episode 2 is not dealt with except in a separately issued Japanese only drama CD.

Note: This release has several nice-to-haves: character bios, line art galleries, full episode previews chock full of in jokes that must be viewed separately, an alternate version of episode 1 including the regular season opener with the credits showing during it rather than during the following opening scenes as in the broadcast version, and a couple of must have extra episodes: 7.5: ""Drinking Party  Fortress Battle"", which fills in a key gap in the storytelling while providing a hilariously over dramatized PSA about the dangers of drinking and water gun fighting, and 13: ""The Sound of the Sky  Dream's Horizon"", which provides a more rounded and satisfying conclusion.

Note: The Blu-ray version is as expected twice as beautiful, but it does contain an error worth noting: half the episode previews are missing.  On the original the episode previews are divvied up in Episode Previews sections to match the episodes on all 4 DVDs, but on the Blu-ray version there is an Episode Previews section only on the first disc, containing only the episode previews matching the first half of episodes.  Since there is no Episode Previews section on the second disc, those from episode 8 on are missing, only to be found on the third and fourth DVDs.  Oops.

Note: This show is only subtitled in English. There is no English voice dubbing.  However, the subtitling is offered in two versions, with and without honorifics for those who have a preference, and there are other big differences as well.

A man who has nothing which he is willing to fight for, nothing which he cares more about than he does about his personal safety, is a miserable creature who has no chance of being free, unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.""",1464307200,4,6565,5.533466533466534
5627770,3,B00BJ3AQJ2,"Sound of the sky was an unexpectedly great anime. In 2016 I've watched roughly a dozen anime, and sound of the sky was the best i've seen. The setting reminded me of castle in the sky which is my favorite movie of all time. The charecter designs reminded me K-on which i didn't know what to think of at first, but it grew on me. The dvd case was unique in that it was printed horizontally. My only real problem was that the series was only in sub. This wasn't a huge issue for me but i do like my dvds to be in english, i can watch subs online. If your new to the series or are looking for something good to watch, you shouldn't be disappointed in this. I still think you should try to stream it first if you can, but if you're going in blind and are able to watch subs, i think you'll be fine. Even if it's not your cup of tea, I don't think it'll be unwatchable.",1458604800,2,864,3.971264367816092

5627777,5,B00BJ3AQJ2,"A lot of anime gets localized (dubbed in english), and I'd guess  80% more do not.  Sadly, we only get the tip of the iceberg.  I've started to purchase more and more Japanese language / English sub-titled only anime, and I have to say, I'm beyond pleased.  Each series just becomes better than the last.

This series is in japanese with english sub-titles.  It had some beautiful animation, interesting story developments, and just a fun atmosphere.
The series is centered around a worn-torn Earth? and a small town with a small military outpost.  Two countries are still at war and a group of ladies / girls have been stations at this small town's outpost, to watch the countries' borders.  The story progresses fairly well and the characters' lives weave like any other anime.  If you're looking for high adventure or action, you won't find much here.  But, if you're like me and enjoy a story about characters living everyday life in a different circumstance, interacting with the people around them, and a mild story that's interesting, you'll enjoy this series.  It has its moments of action, of humor, and parts that leave you wanting more in-depth explanations.
Comparisons?  Kino's Journey meets Last Exile on ground.  hahaha, I hope someone makes that connection, too!  Doesn't really make sense when I reread, hah!

The thing that makes me mad is that they are, what I call, half orders.  You only receive 12-13 episodes instead of 24-25.  The stories are always amazing and it sucks that you only get 12!  :D",1381536000,5,1520,4.825581395348837

8569332,5,B00BJ3AQJ2,"This show is one of my favorites. With a soundtrack that will blow your mind and visuals that suck you in, the show captures your attention well. The story is slow and character driven, but for me this is a positive. Worth every penny (and more).
There is only one thing strange about this particular package. On the DVD version, the formatting is a little strange. It has two episodes per segment (track, runtime section, whatever it's called) instead of an episode per track. Also, if you skip to the next episode, you might actually skip past the next on to the one after that for some reason. It's the only complaint and a small one at that.",1505779200,,645,4.47457627118644

The entire soundtrack of the show is probably the best thing since you cried from ""my lie in april"" and the story is pretty well written. Its a 13 episode anime with 7.5 being an additional episode and there is a different version of episode 1 in there apparently, haven't seen it though.",1497052800,,348,4.369230769230769
