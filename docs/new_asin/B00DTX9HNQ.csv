5855644,5,B00DTX9HNQ,"This DVD will open your eyes about the American diet.  When you come to understand that a diet void of meat and dairy will give you a longer healther life with far less medical problems you will be amazed.  Our American Government does not want you to know about this life style change because it thinks it will hurt the economy.  If this DVD interest you and you would like to learn more please watch the DVD ""Forks over Knives"" also sold by Amazon.",1376611200,6,450,4.333333333333333
5855645,5,B00DTX9HNQ,"The gist: research says that eating plants makes you well and eating animals makes you sick.  Don't believe it?  Watch his DVDs.  He's not a diet guru selling a diet (his website, NutritionFacts.org is a dot-org not a dot-com and you can watch all his DVDs, including this one, there for free): he's simply a nerdy doctor who disseminates easy-to-digest summaries of the thousands of clinical & professional journals he reads.  Occasionally he even includes stuff from governmental food agencies acquired under the Freedom of Information Act and trade journals from groups like the American Beef Grower's Association (or whatever) which is eye opening.

I'm an unabashed fan.  I like the data, that the data comes from a source with no commercial interests, his superb use of graphics, his great use of transitions between topics, and his excellent use of humor.

See also last year's annual project: UPROOTING THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH.

Let's put it this way.  When I talk about the book EATS, SHOOTS & LEAVES I say, ""You have to be a really good writer to make the topic of punctuation interesting, 'cuz it's hard to think of a more boring topic.""  This DVD is like that: he makes QUICK, HOMOROUS and INTERESTING presentations from the driest material imaginable.

To learn from him in this way is motivating in that it helps me REALLY ""GET"" what those things I eat do to my body, in both the short & long term, both positive and negative ... and also how things have come to pass that cheeseburgers are cheap but vegetables are expensive.  These have been a real boon for me.",1374364800,14,1581,4.750915750915751

5855647,5,B00DTX9HNQ,I am a physician specializing in cancer diagnosis.  I have been eating a plant based whole food diet for 5+ years.  I highly recommend Dr. Greger's lecture to anyone willing to consider the research he presents and change their eating habits accordingly.  You will not regret following his advice.,1451692800,,297,5.020408163265306

5855651,5,B00DTX9HNQ,"This is the second best film I have ever watched. The best was FORKS OVER KNIVES, which I also purchased from Amazon.com. Dr. Michael Greger has quite a sense of humor, and as a consequence of seeing both of these films, I am proud to announce that I am now a 71 year old Vegan. I became Vegan at the age of 70. I wish I had seen these two films earlier in my life. I hope you'll watch them too.",1434844800,8,395,3.888888888888889

5855654,2,B00DTX9HNQ,"The info is great but the doctor is impossible to listen to. His inflection is so annoying that it distracts you from the seriousness of the topic.
Same goes for his YouTube videos - impossible to listen to.
The written word would be better for this guy.",1430092800,,254,4.425531914893617

5855660,5,B00DTX9HNQ,Imagine the time it would take you to read over all of the research and peer reviewed studies on nutrition every year.  Dr Greger does this and summarizes it in his DVDs. Thank you,1393718400,4,180,4.294117647058823
5855661,5,B00DTX9HNQ,"THIS definitely is life changing in so many ways that I don't have the time to list how it could be, for me. The bottomline is that YOU MUST decided, only you. YOUR success, just like everything in life, is dependant on whether you want to really make this transition versus just wanting to find something quick. We where looking for a video like Forks over Knifes and found this by Dr Greger M.D.  The facts are laid before you, not from his findings, but from various studies and test that makes you think. I loved his comedic and funny presentations, and I have started to look more into this change after viewing this video. If you didn't like Forks over Knives this video is NOT for you. But if you are looking for an answer for preventing the most common diseases and open and will commit to change, this is for you.",1391644800,4,822,4.372549019607843
5855662,5,B00DTX9HNQ,"This is one of the BEST nutritional videos to date, from any source. Dr. Greger's wit and humor takes this incredibly detailed and serious information, and turns it into an edge-of-your-seat presentation. You'll hear the roar of the crowd as he takes the stage, a virtual rockstar of the veggie nutritional world. This information should be shared with every medical practitioner, every parent, every teacher, everyone who EATS. Bravo, and thank you to Dr. Greger for his continued mission to bring us the facts.",1387324800,7,512,5.107142857142857

Both this volume, and ""The Leading Causes of Death"" are stellar performances in both delivery, breath and depth of knowledge.  I have been in the nutrition and exercise field for over 34 years, learning from the best.  Dr. Greger is one of the best presenters of information available to the world today.",1387324800,6,462,4.897435897435898
5855664,5,B00DTX9HNQ,"Most educational DVD on all things nutrition, health and wellness.  Fantastic information. No corporate sponsors. Just pure science. Dr Greger (Trained at Cornell and Tufts Medical School and the expertise witness for Oprah at the Texas Beef Trial) delivers this life saving information in a quick paced, fun way.

8597716,5,B00DTX9HNQ,"Great, informative DVD, by renowned Dr. Michael Greger M. D., providing a culmination of the most current research on the prevention and reversing of all known diseases and disorders.  The research proves, hands down, that plant-based diets prevent and reverse disease and disorder.  This DVD describes how, if a person has already gotten cancer,  adding a single portion of broccoli to their diet, once a day, reduces the chance of getting cancer again by 50%.  And that is just adding one vegetable.  What if you ate nothing but vegetables and whole grains, chances are, cancer will not return.  He also speaks of MS and how eating a plant-based whole grain diet will cause the symptoms of MS to vanish.  In addition, he speaks of hardening of the arteries as a disease that begins from birth.  Even 10 year old children have some damage to their arteries from the dairy and meat that they are eating.  Atherosclerosis, hardening of the arteries is a progressive disease and begins as soon as we eat saturated fats(hamburgers, chicken), trans fats(crackers), and cholesterol from food(eggs).  This damage can be reversed by switching to a plant-based whole grain diet.  Eat all the fruits and vegetables, 100% whole wheat bread, brown rice, lentils, quinoa and mushrooms that you want, and you will heal your arteries!  Here are the scientific studies that prove this works!",1484265600,,1376,5.013215859030837

8597722,5,B00DTX9HNQ,"This is an eye-opening review of recent medical research on nutrition and disease.  While it takes ""More Than an Apple a Day"" to keep oneself healthy, the evidence shows many simple changes in diet we can make to avoid the common chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.  Dr. Greger is a great speaker and you will not be bored hearing his presentation, done before a live group.",1461715200,3,400,4.7
