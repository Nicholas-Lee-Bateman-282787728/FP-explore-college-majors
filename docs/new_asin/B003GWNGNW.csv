8396588,5,B003GWNGNW,"""No More Ladies"" is pretty much forgotten by movie buffs and Joan Crawford's ardent fans, but it is still a fun movie to watch for the sheer fact that it is enjoyable and funny, something of a rarity for Crawford performances as Joan mainly played dramatic parts.

 The film was released in 1935 and co-stars Robert Montgomery who plays alongside Crawford. The two play characters that are polar opposites both in the way they live their lives and the way they view life, so surprisingly they end up married. What results is a funnt script, tons of plot turns and an enjoyable way to spend 90 minutes.

 Crawford herself detested the film saying in the early 1970's, This (""No More Ladies"") was another of my personal mistakes- I interpredted the part wrong and I didn't let (George)Cukor (the director) help me. I could be a headstrong b....!!"".",1347667200,6,846,4.73469387755102
8396589,3,B003GWNGNW,"Dated but fun film - this was the kind of Hollywood hokum produced to appeal to the Depression-weary audience. This is a lightweight version of Norma Shearer's ""The Divorcee"" (in addressing the infidelity of the male character), dressed up in MGM Art Deco deluxe, with the gorgeously attired Joan Crawford and suave Robert Montgomery. No depth here, but just sit back and enjoy the atmosphere.",1281916800,12,393,5.061538461538461
