7982377,5,B00008F392,Very good adaption of the Caridad Bravo Adams book trilogy 1880s period drama.  I saw this many years ago on television in the 1970s and I recently saw it again on a Hispanic movie channel.  Good performances by all actors.  It is a Mexican-Puerto Rican co-production and filmed on some locations in Puerto Rico.  I would love to see this released here in the US on DVD.,1375315200,,370,4.477611940298507
7982378,5,B00008F392,"I watched this story from beginning to end and I fell in love with all the characters.  But who can not fall for Juan Del Diablo??? This is a must for anyones collection who loves true Pirate love stories.  It's just a shame he passed away when the works for the sequel was going into production.  Could you of imagined how great it would of been to see him reprise his role of the handsome Pirate Juan??? wow.

May he Rest In Peace and he will never be forgotten for his beautiful work in the spanish industry.",1105401600,,511,4.237113402061856
