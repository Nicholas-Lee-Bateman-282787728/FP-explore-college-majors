8598694,3,B001E52U4Y,"I was particularly interested in this episode because of the role charges of intellectualism and ignorance played in the previous Presidential election (Obama/McCain), and was disappointed in that regard.  If there are parallels to be drawn from this discussion, they will be between Kennedy and Obama, and as of this writing there have been no acts of an Obama administration to criticize or defend.

The difficulty in this episode quickly shows itself: who exactly are ""the intellectuals""?

The most interesting parts of the interview focuses on how LBJ is regarded in contrast to JFK, the first 20-30 minutes.  There are real points to be made here, but even though ""the intellectuals"" is a durable category for much political discussion, and Buckley and Morgenthau agree most of the time on who they are, the conversation is of limited utility since a) it is never possible to precisely identify who they mean, and b) there isn't one of these ""intellectuals"" present to speak for himself (as Morgenthau remarks a couple of times, ""you are an intellectual, I am an intellectual,"" but neither are the kind of intellectual they are talking about).  This is illustrated in the question portion of the program, when the question comes up of who in contemporary American politics could rally the intellectuals.  Morgenthau says anyone who could come up with a cohesive and defensible vision, and Buckley says he's being too kind, that at this point any yahoo who promises to end the Vietnam War immediately by withdrawal would be embraced by the intellectuals.  Further probing reveals that Buckley meant ""Norman Mailer,"" while Morgenthau was referring to some undefined group with a bit more common sense in aggregate.  So at a certain point (a point which is reached, crossed, and left well behind in this discussion), probing the mind and motivations of this mysterious group becomes pointless.

So while there were some interesting points and arguments here, if you are looking for an introduction to this great political interview show, I would look elsewhere.",1227916800,2,2063,5.116071428571429
