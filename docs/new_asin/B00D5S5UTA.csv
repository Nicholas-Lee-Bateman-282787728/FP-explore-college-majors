that we can't come up with a positive feeling to create the solution. The Blue
Jewel does that and with such style and perfection, we can believe it.

8589763,5,B00D5S5UTA,"I saw the ""The Blue Jewel"" for the first time at the LA premier a few month ago and liked it very much. Oliver Hauck the director made a beautiful film about Earth/Gaia and planetary healers with breathtaking aerial photography. He interviewed several interesting healers & teachers from around the globe and shared some insight on interesting experiments!

One of the key teachers was Pepper Lewis who is a trance medium for Gaia. Her soothing voice throughout the film was so beautiful to listen too and the messages went straight to ones heart and soul. The music from Beyond with Tina Turner rounded up this multi sensory experience and left me wondering what my part is and will be in the future. It was a gentle reminder that we all matter and while living in a fast pace place like LA one should thrive to find the balance, walk the talk and be part of the global healing ~ Try to offer whatever your gift might be and take initiative with other like minded souls to make your cities a better place to live for all! Be the change you wish to see in this world ~ Gandhi

Many Blessings, Zana Fong

8589764,5,B00D5S5UTA,"""The Blue Jewel"" is a beautifully photographed film about Earth, ""the blue jewel,"" which carries a somewhat startling message: The Earth loves humanity.
German filmmaker Oliver Hauck asked the question, ""What would our Earth be like if humanity understood that we and the Earth are one? That we humans are made of the same material as a volcano or a rainbow and that the Earth's pulse beats to the rhythm of our own?""
In ""The Blue Jewel,"" Hauck travels to various planetary healers--Native American elders and other men and women who have taken it upon themselves to speak for the Earth and to call humans into alignment with her--to share their messages with us.
""A planetary healer,"" Hauck says, ""is aware that the Earth is a living being, and that we can change events happening on Earth through our thoughts."" The filmmaker successfully tests this hypothesis by calling upon a community of some two-thousand people to visualize rain falling in the desert of Tunisia on a certain day and time.
""Human beings still believe that it will take centuries to heal the damage mankind has brought upon Earth,"" Hauck says. ""It is not the case. All we need are new thoughts, new ideas, and new solutions.""
One of the film's featured healers, Pepper Lewis, is a trance medium for Gaia, who tells us that our careless actions do not so much harm the Earth as ourselves. Gaia can heal; can rebalance herself; can even create new oceans if we kill the existing ones. Humanity, however, is not so fortunate.
In an innovative twist, Hauck invites the audience to participate in a healing visualization of the planet right in the darkened theater. This single decision changes every screening of the film into an exercise in healing the blue jewel.
When we showed ""The Blue Jewel"" at our monthly Spiritual Cinema Night in Ojai, the audience immediately asked when we would show it again. This is the first and only time this has happened with a movie we've shown.
Highly recommended.",1371427200,4,1969,4.811209439528024
