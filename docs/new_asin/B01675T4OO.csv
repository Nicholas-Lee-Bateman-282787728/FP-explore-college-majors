I love the clear explanations of the dance posture and the basic movements, and the ever-present reminder that everyone is different, but no matter your level of physical activity and flexibility, everyone can learn and enjoy this art form. Madame Ona has an easy going teaching style and her personality really shines through. She's a character! She gives great metaphors to help you visualize the movement. That's really helpful for me!
The bonus performance at the end is a great way to see all of the things you have just learned put together to create a beautiful performance.
The music used during the instruction was a nice medium tempo piece by Carmine Guida. The music for the performance, by River Guerguerian, was nice because its not what youd expect for a belly dance performance.
The Bloopers are hilarious! There is one curse word, but it didn't bother me. Its also nice to see that Ona doesnt take herself too seriously.
This is a fun video that I really enjoyed.",1447372800,,1050,4.806629834254144
