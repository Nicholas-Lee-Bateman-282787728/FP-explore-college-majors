8737857,5,B0171RC296,"I have loved James Dean for years.  I've seen and re-seen his films and pored over the books.

I have also been accused of like him for his looks and not being able to really appreciate his acting because, ""He only made three movies!""

Well, he may have only made three movies - but he made a slew of TV appearances and they more than prove my opinion that he was a first-rate actor.

The movies are in order of television appearances so you can see the growth of his talent and career. And it is amazing to me that some of his work was done when he was ""just"" 19.

When you watch him aside Mary Astor, Dorothy Gish, Ed Begley - my gosh, they were in the field years and he gave them a run for their money. YOu can see it in the way he moves, the small gestures he makes which add realism and believability to the scene.

This set totally backs up my response to naysayers - I don't love James Dean because of his teen idol looks, I love him because he was one of our last truly great natural-born talents.",1536019200,,1006,4.081218274111675
8737858,5,B0171RC296,"If you're a fan of James Dean and/or early live television, you're going to enjoy this. The collection is presented very nicely and is as good as the rather primitive kinescope prints get. The minor cons are that many of the productions, especially the early one's, have little of Dean and the stories are rather dull. Dean definitely gets better as time went on his roles got bigger. I personally enjoyed the stories where he was in his classic ""Rebel Without A Cause"" persona, but there's not too many of them. I wouldn't make this a deterrent to adding this to your DVD collection.",1527984000,,584,4.625

8737860,5,B0171RC296,"Dean fans, RUN, do not walk to pick up this set.  If you are at all interested in Dean's development as an actor, this set is for you. In many Dean biographies you read mentions of these teleplays or behind the scene tales...but with this set you have the original, beautifully restored teleplays themselves, actually introduced by Dean's cousin (the closest thing he ever had to a little brother.) There are some jaw-dropping finds here for the true Dean fan. This set goes far in plugging a large hole in the Dean creative canon.",1473206400,2,531,4.648936170212766
8737861,5,B0171RC296,"I own over 3000 dvd and I think the james dean lost television legacy is by far the best purchase I ever made, first of all I bought this set directly from TCM store. I am a fan of james dean and love his three movies and new he did some tv shows, but I never expected to enjoy these dvd so much. The picture quality for old kinascope is amazing. They remastered the picture and it looks almost like videotape, great quality. You can see the progression in his acting, as his role in these teleplays increased from bit parts maybe 30 seconds of speaking lines , gradually to co-star and more lines and toward the end he was a star and had the most lines. He got better and better and each role was a little different. You can see what kind of actor he was in these tv shows. Unbelievable acting and each teleport was interesting. I watched each show at lease 5 times and can't wait to see it again. I was a casual fan of james dean and now he is one of my favorite actors of all time. You get 19 complete shows, two partial shows and 2 commercials. If I had to go to a desert island  and could only bring three dvd they would be this set. I can't stop talking about it. Do yourself a favor and buy this set, it might be the best thing you ever bought.",1459900800,5,1251,4.044354838709677
8737862,5,B0171RC296,"It's great to finally get a chance to see James Dean's many TV features before he made the 3 classic films that he's mainly known for, before his car crash death at age 24 on Sept. 30th, 1955.  I bought this for 3 main reasons:  1) I've really enjoyed his 3 big movies, especially ""East of Eden,"" so I was eager to see his earlier work.  2) TCM showed some of these TV appearances on the 60th anniversary of his death and promoted this 3 DVD set.  3) I recently bought a ""Studio One"" (an early TV dramatic anthology) DVD set, which I liked very much, and knew that James Dean did a number of Studio One plays that I hadn't seen before.  What a treasure to be able to see not only James Dean's earliest acting work (including a couple of soft drink commercials), but also to see such early TV shows that hadn't been seen probably since they aired in the 1950s.  I got a kick out of seeing other notable acting stars appear with him, such as a young Cloris Leachman, Mary Astor, Ed Begley Sr., Dorothy Gish, Gene Lockhart and Betsy Palmer.  The quality is not too bad at all, considering that it's all over 60 years old and was kinescoped (a filming of a TV broadcast).  Most of the plays in this set were well written and well performed, especially Dean's performances.  This set allows us to see his development as an actor, especially his growing ""rebel"" side that he's become legendary for.  A couple of his TV appearances on this set are only brief fragments, since the whole episodes from which they came have been lost to time.  I would have loved it if the original commercials were left in the old programs here (like in the ""Studio One"" DVD Set, which has most of those episodes shown with Betty Furness making her usual pitches for Westinghouse fridges, TVs, dishwashers & more.)  Alas, they are not a part of James Dean's set (except for the 2 separate Pepsi commercials he appeared in to start his TV career, although in the first one, you can barely see him.)  Also, I didn't find James Dean's cousin (Marcus) all that effective in presenting each of the TV programs.  I would have found it more interesting if, let's say, Robert Osborne from TCM did them, as he did when a few of these shows were presented on TCM on 9/30/2015.  Robert is much more informative, smooth and professional in presentation.  The accompanying booklet in the set captured some fascinating accounts of Dean's early years, too.  This was quite a treat to obtain!  For those who enjoy early TV or James Dean, this one's a gem to own!",1456790400,6,2520,4.453159041394335
8737863,5,B0171RC296,"If you know me personally there are four individuals, legends of film that I always speak about, or highly praise. One, Gary Cooper, two, Bette Davis, three, Jimmy Stewart and four, the one and only, James Dean. East of Eden is one of my favorite films of all time.

When I was sent this to review, and then realized that this was early James Dean, I was in heaven. Total bliss. Dean was, and is, one of the coolest, sexiest, believable, men of acting history. He was cinematic gold. What many people do not realize is that James Dean was not just about the movies. It was the movies that made his name known, and created a legend that still remains strong today, even after his death, over 60 years ago. Dean before the cinematic stardom with the powerful performance of East of Eden, and the all-around perfection of Rebel without a Cause, is he played in live television programs.

Such shows as Family Theater, Westinghouse Studio One, Kraft Television, General Electric Theater and many others were a huge success, and families all across the nation set in front of those wonderful. Black and white, Wooden Boxed TVs of the olden days.

This is absolutely an amazing product of high quality. Any lover of the cinema world must own this. Fans of James Dean. Fans of older cinema will be absolutely enthralled with this DVD. This is a 3 Disc set. It also comes with an insert commemorative booklet, coming in at 20 pages. This insert booklet is an amazing read. This booklet is written by James Ritz. It details some brief history, and also a synopsis of the 22 programs. Each of the programs are different in running time. There are 9 programs a little under an hour. 9 programs a little under 30 minutes. 1 program under 10 minutes. One set of commercials with a running time of 3 minutes. A program of 8 minutes, which is an excerpt of the Campbell Soundstage: Life Sentence. And one program at 13 minutes.

Something that really caught my attention, was yes all the amazing love that went into bringing this product out, but also that each episode is introduced by James Deans cousin, Marcus Winslow Jr. Winslow is the head of Deans estate.

I cant speak highly enough about this DVD product. To me anyone who is a movie buff, cinema lover, must own this product. This is a one of a kind mastery, put into this product. There was such care and love in creating this, and you can see that in the finished product.

Also what is amazing, is that this is like a time capsule of stardom. Not only do you have James Dean, but you have perfection in actresses and actors, such as Natalie Wood, John Forsythe, Dorothy Gish, Ed Begley, Ruth Hussey, John Carradine, Gene Lockhart, and many others. Seeing James Dean in these early roles is a trip into nostalgia. A golden era of acting perfection, which would lead to one of the most iconic actors in imagery, and performance. His life was short. His movies where of few, but his legacy is still strong, if not stronger than ever. Products like this give the fan a perfected experience that lingers, and creates a giddy feeling of watching such dynamic moments of star history.

Audio/Video:

Aspect Ratio is widescreen. It has a running time of 768 minutes. Audio is English: Mono. Black and white and color. For being as old as they are, and being during a time period where TV, and films where never really protected, this product shines. There is such a lovely restoration to all these programs. I had only seen a few of them before this product, and remember the ones I saw, comparing it to this product, is like night and day. The old ones I saw where damaged, and lacked any care. This product shines and looks better than any other example out there.

Special Features:

Photo Gallery from 3 photographers, Roy Schatt, Frank Worth, and Sanford Roth. Who each knew Dean. Roy Schatt was, The New York Years. Frank Worth was, The Hollywood Years. Sanford Roth was, The Final Years.

A wonderful 4 minute program on showcasing the restoration of the programs and what it took.

A 3 minute silent documentary titled, Fairmont Today. This is a great program in showcasing James Deans hometown in Indiana.

As I have stated, The Commemorative booklet.

Overall:

I proudly display this DVD on my shelf and any fan of cinema should do the same. I am amazed and floored at the love and care that went into this product. I, being a James Dean fan, smiled, laughed, was amazed, and even got a little emotional, because of how this brilliant man died way too soon. Every time I watch East of Eden, or Rebel, or Giant, I think of this 24 year old man, how he had so many more years to impress, and give satisfaction in cinema. Thankfully there are his films, and now most importantly a collection of all the remaining TV shows. Sadly over the years many of his appearances have been lost, but the few that remain are now given on a top quality product.

Product Rating: Scale of 1 to 10

10 out 10, Perfection. One of the best products I have seen. Lovingly cared for. These old, lost, forgotten about experiences are restored in the best way possible. James Dean was honored, respected, and most of all, shared with a modern generation, and the older generation that love him so.",1448409600,15,7944,4.580281690140845
