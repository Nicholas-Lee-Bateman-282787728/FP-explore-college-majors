3691560,4,B001LTWNQI,This is a very good way to familiarize oneself with a variety of time steps and also possibly increase agility and speed in dancing. Eli does a good job of demonstrating. But I wish he would come out with a video of interesting dance like Bonnie Franklin's.,1265155200,7,257,4.48936170212766
3691561,5,B001LTWNQI,"I had already purchased both Vol 1 & 2 and just received Vol 3.  Like the others this one is completely amazing!  It's like having personal classes with a teacher that can repeat each movement over and over, any time you need.  It's not necessary to have any experience before using this DVD series.  I think it is important for instructional videos to provide proper guidance and explanation of the techniques, and Eli Newson does it perfectly.  Easy to understand and with clear instructions, he explains everything carefulIy.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn how to tap dancing.  Practice with this dvd and you'll be really happy with your progress!",1242345600,10,677,4.834782608695652
3691562,5,B001LTWNQI,This is a great DVD for beginners and intermediate tappers.  Eli makes it fun and you get a workout!  The DVD is set up with split views to see the foot work from every angle.  He is a great teacher and explains everything in detail.  I look forward to practicing my time steps 2-3 times a week.,1233532800,4,295,4.12280701754386

8319818,5,B001LTWNQI,Best tap instructional DVD out there,1466035200,,36,5.166666666666667
8319819,2,B001LTWNQI,"first, the disc was defective and one of the tracks only played half way through
second, why would they choose to have someone dressed in black demonstrate dance steps against a black background?
third, I was hoping that the steps would be incorporated into some kind of a dance routine at the end--no such luck
fourth, well, my fault, I just couldn't follow along with the instructions for the last of the time steps; the instructor really rushed through that one, having spent plenty of time on the earlier steps
fifth, I have to admit I did have fun trying the steps, even though I was not always successful",1441584000,,610,4.605504587155964
8319820,5,B001LTWNQI,"Just what I wanted! Thank you,
Pat &:)",1427673600,,38,3.875
8319821,5,B001LTWNQI,This is a great video. I've worked my way through all of Eli's tap videos and this one is my favorite.  Love the time steps!,1423526400,,124,3.96
8319822,5,B001LTWNQI,Great video,1406160000,,11,5.0
8319823,5,B001LTWNQI,Best instruction DVD I've ever purchased! I'm now onto the intermediate dvd and loving it just as much.,1404432000,,103,4.777777777777778
8319824,4,B001LTWNQI,"A variety of time steps are covered... I like how the video shows the steps at various speeds and at different angles so that you can better understand the rhythms, etc.",1361145600,2,169,4.483870967741935
8319825,5,B001LTWNQI,This is excellent. Each time step is broken down in detail and then you get to practice with the instructor at a slow pace and then a faster pace. I highly recommend this. I personally was just trying to brush up on time steps (as I had stopped tap dancing for a while) and it was a great review. I had never done a traveling time step and found it very easy to learn how to do it...and I am slow at picking up things. So even if you are a beginner...if you know flaps and shuffles...this will work for you.,1324771200,10,507,4.02970297029703
8319826,5,B001LTWNQI,"I am an experienced tap dancer and an instructor. I purchased this CD for ideas on introducing some new combinations to my advanced beginner students. I found Eli Newsom's instruction VERY clear -- loved the different camera angles and tempi. Anyone approaching time steps with fear need not worry! This is an EXCELLENT resource for improving your basic technique in some tricky, but fun tap steps. I want more, Eli! :-)",1265414400,8,420,4.929577464788732
