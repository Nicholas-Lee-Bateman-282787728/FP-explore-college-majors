`Kis Kis Ki Kismet' is a recent Bollywood remake of `Easy Living' ('37), a minor classic from the Golden Age of Hollywood. This Indian version follows the storyline of the original with a few minor exceptions;

- The plot revolves around a diamond necklace instead of a mink coat,
- The events take place in India instead of the U.S.A., so some cultural adjustments were made,
- Being a Bollywood production intermittent musical numbers were inserted,
- Mallika Sherawat provides a much stronger sexual presence and tone to the film which differs quite a bit from Jean Arthur's portrayal of the lead character.

This sexier, wackier Hindi adaptation is lots of fun and can be enjoyed whether you're familiar with the original or not. As for me, just let me know Mallika Sherawat is in a film and I'm interested.",1218326400,5,848,4.834482758620689
