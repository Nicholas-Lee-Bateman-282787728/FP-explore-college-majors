7966737,4,B00006AV18,"These lessons are really very good and much more blues/rock focused than some of Gilbert's other videos, which are more for shred/metal players and so a little less applicable for the general blues/rock player. One thing to remember is that these videos are available on You Tube, but don't include the tab which is in the booklet. So the key thing you're getting here is the tab, but that's pretty important since much of what he plays is pretty quick.",1225324800,,453,4.675
