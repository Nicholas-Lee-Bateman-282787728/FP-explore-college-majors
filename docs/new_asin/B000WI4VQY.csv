But i enjoyed this volume 1 of Death note, great show and interesting premise carried out rather well.  Along with solid story, characters and the like.  Very fun, solid show to watch if the first volume is any indication.  This is going to be one excellent series for Anime fans everywhere.",1200528000,2,382,4.815384615384615
