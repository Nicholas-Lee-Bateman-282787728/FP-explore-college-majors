8196523,3,B00005O5D4,"[Warning small spoilers of scenes though not plot.] These (double feature, sharing plots and actresses) movies have neither the standard new-fish-in-big-house WIP movie elements of #701 (first Scorpion movie) nor the magical mythical female avenger of the later parts of #701 and all of Jail house 41 (second Scorpion movie). The actress is is of course beautiful but

much less memorable than Meiko Kaji (of #701 and jail-house 41).

Rather there are more non-prison scenes which seem influenced by HK girl w/gun movies and MTV. There are still some fun WIP movie bits and pieces, in particular a group Japanese hip bath in the prison, and some modest medical inspection strippings. There are also many sex scenes with varying degrees of nakedness.

These movies are definitely not classic WIPs, though certainly watchable. It also occurs to me that VJs might find the quick cuts of weird flashy naughtiness useful, though I of course do not encourage any copyright violations.",1123286400,7,978,5.138364779874214
8196524,4,B00005O5D4,"This series is pretty good. It's not spectacular, but it'll keep you entertained. I liked the DVD as a whole, but there's one scene where two people have sex, not rape (which happens often), in the movie. It was pointless sex. But the series starts and ends pretty good. I recommmend this to someone who needs something to keep them from being bored.",1066521600,6,350,4.571428571428571
8196525,4,B00005O5D4,"Okay, let me preface this review by saying this disc is by no means classic material...  ... DOUBLE FEATURE. That means two times the Chiharu Kimatsu than your ordinary CK DVD (not that there are any others at current, but I wish there were). Based solely on the fact that you get two pretty entertaining movies for the price of one, ought to sell those on the fence of a purchase. I will say this: The first part of the double feature is better than the second simply because it's a simple setup for a story that gets a little out of hand and overexplained in the second part. But what the hell. It's exploitation, it's supposed to go over the top. It makes it more fun that way. I'm pretty surprised more people haven't reviewed this disc. Call up the fellers, crack a few bronsons, and have some whoops and giggles. It's pretty candy, if you ask me.",1025308800,5,852,4.3584905660377355
