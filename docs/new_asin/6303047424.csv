540202,5,6303047424,"Josh and S.A.M. is one of my favorite movies.  Having worked with kids
much of my adult life, I am sensitive to the problems children have in
dysfunctional or rejecting families.  The film is about two brothers,
Josh and Sam (Jacob Tierney and Noah Fleiss) ages 12 and 8 respectively.
(Fleiss should have been cast as a 9 or 10 year old).  They are complete
opposites, the older a computer nerd and fabricator, the younger a jock
with ADD symptoms.  They do not get along, with Josh resenting Sam's
athleticism and Sam smarting from Josh's scorn.  Their mother is a
divorcee, more involved in her new love interest than her boys, while
their father has remarried and is living in Florida with his new wife
and her two cloddish jock sons, appearing to be about 11 and 14.  The
boys are flown from L.A. to Florida to visit their dad before summer
ends, and there, Josh's stepbrothers and Sam tease Josh, implying that
his dad thinks maybe he is gay.  Upset that Sam sides with his step-
brothers, he concocts a plan on a computer, combining a weekly news-
magazine article about child warriors in Latin America with pictures
of Sam.  He then manages to convince Sam the next day that he (Sam) is
really genetically engineered to be a child warrior, and that his dad
is planning to sell him to the Pentagon.  This seemingly hard to belive
story seems to explain all of Sam's problems with school, fighting, and
daydreaming.  Then the boys are sent back to L.A. prematurely when their
mother decides to go with her boyfriend to Europe for a year and wants
to say goodby before she leaves.  But a storm in Dallas grounds their
plane and Josh decides he doesn't want to be with either parent, and
tries to leave Sam at the hotel they are in, waiting out the storm.  He
wanders into a high-school reunion to get free food, and pretends he is
the son of a woman attending.  A man (Chris Penn) overhears him and
thinks Josh may be his son.  Sam comes down from the room, and the three
of them head to the parents of the woman Josh said was his mother.  When
Penn realizes the whole story was made up, now inside the unoccupied
residence around a pool table, he becomes violent, and Josh hits him
hard with a pool cue, knocking him out.  Josh thinks he has killed Penn,
and he and Sam take off in Penn's rented car for Canada.  The rest of
the film is their adventures on the road, which include Martha Plimpton
as a wandering runaway, who S.A.M. believes is the Liberty Maid, part of
the lie that Josh made up to escort altered mutants to freedom in Canada.
No matter how hard Josh tries to tell Sam the truth, each event seems to
only verify Josh's lies.  The performances of the two leads are amazing,
the movie is low key, quiet, and sad, making it too heady for younger
children, and a couple of scenes where Sam drives, thinking he is in-
destructible, seriously hurt the films already unlikely premise.  But
the last 15 minutes have some excellent dialogue, and the movie ends
in a somewhat promising way, as the brothers have grown close as a result
of their saga.  So if you like serious films about children, and can
accept the premise and excuse a couple of poorly thought out scenes,
you will see a terrific, sensitive, beautifully acted, underrated film.",1204848000,6,3257,4.488135593220339
540204,5,6303047424,I seen both actors in later films first and thought they were interesting and when I found out about Josh & Sam I felt it was a bonus the Tierney was in it because I found out about the film because of Noah Fleiss and these kids were very good long before i found them and I now need to see all the rest of the early films to see how whomevwer was in charge saw the diamonds in the rough that these two were. I think Noah will be a bigger heartbreaker with the angst films.,997056000,3,473,3.88659793814433
540205,4,6303047424,"Josh, a young boy (Jacob Tierney) is adopted and is picked on by his evil stepdad and stepbrothers. They treat him badly and call him a girl a lot. Josh has a real younger brother whom he wants to keep in his camp. His stepdad and stepbrothers treat Sam like family and are creating a split between Josh and Sam. Josh develops a great plan to get Sam back into his camp. He tells Sam he is a genetically enhanced youth (reason he can do everything better then Josh as well as beat him up) and his Stepdad is going to ship him off to war. The story Josh tells Sam gets out of control and he ends it with Sam having to go to Canada to be converted back to a normal boy and not having to go to war. The two boys end up running away in a stolen car and having lots of great adventures. Along the way the find help in a streetwise runaway. Family fun must see.",988588800,6,855,3.9767441860465116
540207,5,6303047424,"Josh (Tierney) is unhappy with the way that his family treats him, especially the fact that his father (Tobolowsky) seems to love little brother Sam (Fleiss) more. To get even, he tells Sam that Sam is a robot,  and the family is going to sell him to the Pentagon to fight in wars. The  boys end up on the run, Sam from the Pentagon and Josh from the police (he  thinks that he murdered someone). The Liberty Maid (Plimpton) arrives and  helps them for awhile, but then the boys are on their own. Well acted fun!",961372800,3,512,4.302083333333333
540209,5,6303047424,"Josh and Sam is just one of those kinda movies, who can forget Surf Ninja's and Airborne? It's one of those movies you start out watching on a friday night while your wondering ""what in the heck am i doing with my life?"" However you find yourself pulled  into this story of how 2 brothers cope with their mother flying off to  Europe with her Rico Suavea boyfriend and to make matters worse she hasn't  even invited you along!  You have to go live with your father in Florida  with his new wife and her 2 boys. To make a short but hard to describe  story shorter, Josh sees that his brother Sam is favoring his new  stepbrothers and giving him the cold shoulder. So he goes on his dad's  computer prints up some official looking documents and convinces his  brother that the real reason he can't get good grades at school, why he's  so good at football and why he gets in fights at recess is because he's  S.A.M. an acronym for Strategically Altered Mutant . He concvinces Sam that  everyone is in on it but him and his mother father and stepbrothers want to  send him off to a secret war in Africa and collect money from the Pentagon.  Nevertheless when they 2 amigos have to go back to California to pack up  their stuff they are delayed in Dallas. Josh uses this as a chance to  runaway but finds he can't get very far without Sam. They steal a drunk's  car and head for Canada where Sam believes he will be safe from the  Pentagon. Along the way they meet up with my girl Martha Plimpton who Sam  believes is the Liberty Maid come to lead him to Canada on the Underground  Roadway! What else can i say, a candle apple red 1993 pontiac Grand Prix,  the open backway western roads and your heading towards Canada and an  uncertain future. Josh and Sam is a great film which unfortunately has not  been discovered by many people.",947548800,7,1830,4.333333333333333

7835406,5,6303047424,I'm so glad that amazon made an online-viewing version of this movie because it's only sold on VHS. Will someone please change the movie description though (what the heck)? Not many people seem to know about this movie but it is very touching with a little bit of humor. <3,1280275200,3,273,4.48
7835407,3,6303047424,"I am interested in this movie because I was an extra in the film, they paid us a flat fee for the whole day, made the local extras eat after the dogs that stared in the film and made us stay all day.  It kind of sucked all in all, but I still made it to the silver screen so that is why I am interested in the film, I made $50 for the whole day.  The film was not an oscar contender.",1271030400,,383,3.602409638554217
