5074094,5,B007BNDFNS,This is a very cute coloring book! There are a few pages for each month which is great! My son is 2 and once a week we color a picture and I tell him about that month. He loves Thomas and it's a fun way to learn.,1390521600,,212,3.5319148936170213
5074095,4,B007BNDFNS,"My son loves Thomas the Train & while he most often watches new animated episodes, he seemed to enjoy the episodes in this classic version.",1390089600,2,139,4.6
5074096,4,B007BNDFNS,"My daughter can sit and watch this all the way through if we let her. I enjoy watching these episodes with her. The picture is clear and the sound is great.

Was going to give this a 5 star rating if not for my one complaint is that you have to sit through the opening credits for every single episode and you can't skip chapters as the opening is part of the same chapter as the show. THAT gets really annoying really fast.
Okay, my other complaint is that you can't just hit MENU to bypass the trailers at the beginning so you have to constantly skip chapters to get to the ""Auto Play"" or ""Menu"" selection screen",1385510400,,614,4.203389830508475
5074097,5,B007BNDFNS,"This is a collection of several (somewhat) related episodes of the ""Thomas & Friends"" TV show. Total running time is right at 2.5 hours, but that includes several intro and outro title sequences. My grandson has heard those songs so many times from watching these collections that he sings them as he's walking around pretending to be a steam engine.

If you have a child in your home who loves Thomas & Friends as much as my grandson, these videos are perfect. Being able to stream them free is more than worth the cost of the Prime membership...we watch at least one of these per day.",1383696000,2,586,4.528301886792453
5074098,5,B007BNDFNS,"Was so happy to find this on DVD as many of our classics were on VHS, and then on separate DVDs. Wonderful to be able to kick back and relax and soak up the lovely world of Thomas sans blood, gore, stress, violence, backstabbing, cursing, one-uppage, and generally spiritually lacking shows of today. Bonus: don't have to get up and down as much - you can just relax and enjoy!",1373673600,4,377,4.4
5074099,5,B007BNDFNS,"This is where your looking at classic Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends. This has 3 episodes never released on DVD and 2 Never on video! Trouble in the Shed was on ""Tenders & Turntables"". But ""Saved from Scrap"" and ""A New Friend for Thomas"" are from the original Shining Time Station airings. Yes, these are the USA Ringo Starr narrations. Season 1-4 are ALL restored. This is one Giagantic Plus for me!",1346025600,4,402,4.52054794520548
5074100,5,B007BNDFNS,"With twenty episodes plus bonus content, this is a great DVD for any Thomas fan.  My boys love watching it and playing with their train table, even though they have seen some of the episodes before.  I like hearing the voices of George Carlin and Alec Baldwin, which always make me laugh!",1338508800,2,288,4.519230769230769
5074101,5,B007BNDFNS,"Another great DVD from Thomas & Friends. In this DVD, 20 episodes on a 2 disc set. This DVD set doesn't have any CGI episodes on it, but the great stories from the classic series & television series. There are 4 episodes on this DVD set that are new and never released on DVD. Plus, the DVD has the storytellers of Ringo Starr, George Carlin, Alec Baldwin, and Michael Brandon narrating these stories. some of these stories were seen on HIT TV show ""Shining Time Station"". The best story in my opinion on the DVD was a 2-part episode about Duke, the lost engine. Also on the DVD, there are bouns features which are Games & a scrapbook. In my Opinion, I rate this DVD 6 out of 5 stars. This is a great DVD set and is a MUST HAVE dvd for Thomas fans & train lovers. Great to see few new stories on the DVD. Hope more DVDs come out soon with new-to-DVD episodes. Thomas & his friends are really useful in this new DVD collection of adventures & friendships :)",1336953600,7,956,4.229508196721311

5074111,5,B007BNDFNS,"I was born in late 1991, and as a kid Thomas The Tank Engine was one of my favorite shows. I have all the VHS's up to when Alec Baldwin started narrating, recently i purchased the original 6 UK VHS's to get all of Ringo Starrs Narrations, but as growing up in the US his US Narrations of the 42 episodes he did was nostalgic. But there was only 5 VHS's releases of his narration and only one shining time station VHS(the christmas special) that was released. There should have been another VHS with the last 7 stories that were on shining time station, with Percy takes The Plunge, Percy's Ghostly Trick, Woolly Bear, Saved from Scrap, A New Friend for Thomas, and Thomas's christmas party and the infamous edit of Thomas and the missing christmas tree. Instead we got Trust thomas, and these episodes were then released with George Carlins narration. In recent years all these episodes have been circulating on the internet, Percy takes the plunge RS US was released on the best of Percy years ago, and wooly bear and Percys Ghostly Trick had been going around youtube in good quality. But Saved from Scrap and A New Friend for Thomas was in Horrible quality! Untill now, but this DVD has episodes from Season 1 all the way till Season 11(the one before CGI) It had a great mix of episodes on it would recomend it!",1398470400,4,1315,4.506276150627615

8513991,4,B007BNDFNS,"My two-year old son seems to prefer these older, ""classic"" Thomas episodes to the newer, CGI episodes. He'll watch them both, but these episodes capture his attention a little better. I would think he'd be more interested in the more modern, cartoony Thomas episodes, but this collection holds his full attention. And he's seen it multiple times!

The collection is 149 minutes long, and features the following episodes, which are each only a few minutes long. (The more modern episodes are 12 or 13 minutes long.)

Disc 1
Thomas and Bertie's Great Race
Trouble in the Shed
Saved from Scrap
A New Friend for Thomas
Granpuff
Sleeping Beauty
Make Someone Happy
A Bad Day for Harold
Twin Trouble
Edward the Really Useful Engine
Rusty Saves the Day
Emily's New Coaches
Thomas and the Rainbow
Thomas and the New Engine
Thomas and the Statue

Disc 2
Follow that Flour
Toby's Afternoon Off
Edward Strikes Out
Hide and Peep
Emily and the Garbage",1413504000,2,937,4.807453416149069
