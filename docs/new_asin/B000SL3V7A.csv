8205783,5,B000SL3V7A,"I really enjoyed this DVD as it was done extremely well as are all of these ""Killer Tanks"" series DVD's (from the same people who did the Scorched Earth DVD Series). If you are into World War II or military history in general, or even scale model building (of military subjects) then I'm sure you will enjoy this DVD. Excellent quality, great footage, nice touches of CGI animation, just an overall excellent DVD on the British Churchill Tank design from World War II.",1193011200,3,468,4.650602409638554
