1716549,5,B000067J2W,"The third season of this classic Anime Is just that, classic! Ranma 1/2 just gets better with time!
I must say I really did enjoy this great season! It has some great esps and it makes me laugh what more could you want?
One of  the Best Anime shows out there!",1047686400,,259,4.078431372549019
1716550,5,B000067J2W,"If you're looking for fighting scenes skip this one.  Although there are frequent fight scenes, Ranma learns no techniques, and he almost never uses his old fighting styles.  The point of this one is to watch romance unfold between Ranma and Akane.  The best scene is when Akane has a cold, and Ranma has a curse where he must hug someone whenever he sneezes.  This episode shows quite a lot of film humor (for instance, they are playing this movie where some guy says that she doesn't love this man but embraces him, and later Ranma embraces Akane, and you hear a boat whistle).  The next best episode is when the local fortuneteller reads a Tower when Happosai passes (Happosai is the source of all ruin anyway), and Akane has to nurse the entire family back with some weird witch remedy.",1042588800,,790,4.574468085106383
1716551,3,B000067J2W,"This is the season where the episodes start to dip down in quality.
Video Quality:  3/5, not nearly as good as the first couple seasons.  I don't know what happened here, but it could just be the source material.
Sound Quality:  4/5, both the english and japanese tracks sounded fine on my system
Content Quality: 3/5, The start of this season began really well, with the introduction of Ukyo and the episodes that followed, but soon began to get worse in quality.  Most of these episodes were just boring and weren't very memorable.  The fact that Happosai was the main focus of most of the episodes didn't help either.  I mean, I like the little guy, but he just gets really old after a while.
If you enjoyed the wonderful first and second seasons, you might want to give this one a try.  Its almost a completely different series though, where the first seasons had a continuing story, these are all stand alone episodes.  Some of them are fun, but just don't carry the magic the first season had.",1041206400,,999,4.5418994413407825
1716552,5,B000067J2W,"The third season of Ranma not only rivals the entertainment value of the first and second seasons but surpasses it. I never fail to be amazed at how the series draw me in more and more as the episodes progress. The third season tends to have a little more complex plots than the first and second, although a little less romance between Ranma and Akane (which is always a little disappointing). The price may be a little steep but it's well worth it.",1036368000,,449,4.421686746987952

1716556,5,B000067J2W,"This season of Ranma starts off well with the introduction of yet another fiance for Ranma - Ukyo, who up until now Ranma believed to be a boy!  Things get crazier and there are some brilliant episodes with Kodachi & Kuno.  I don't think there's any bad episodes here- at least they wouldn't be if not for 2 episodes only having english audio on them which is just wrong.
Personally I'd like to have profiles of the japanese voice cast not the US cast but other than that this is an essential purchase.  The episodes with Happosai in are truely hilarious and worth getting for alone.",1029196800,,583,4.481132075471698
1716557,5,B000067J2W,"This is it! The Hard Battle Box Set, marking the 3rd season of the hit anime Ranma 1/2. If you aren't quite up to date on what this show is about then I say...""WHERE AND THE HECK HAVE YOU BEEN!?""....I also say, that I will not even attempt to say that which has already been said, far too many times. Ok, with that said, this box set includes some of the best episodes of the entire series. It even features a couple episodes VIZ released on a special tape featuring just that, the best episodes of the entire series(hows that for proof). It also finally finishes up the introduction of all the most major characters with Ranma's latest fiance, Ukyo.
Ranma has long been known for its quirky, unsophisticated, romantic, and entirely enjoyable brand of comedy. And this particular season truly shines with some classic moments.
So if you are a Ranma fan, then I definitely suggest you do yourself a favor and pick this up.  If you are new to Ranma, well then it would be best if you start with first season. Or rent some tapes before buying this. As you will find yourself more confused than a Japanese tourist at a Lynard Skynard concert.(totally lost, won't know who or what your dealing with, along with plenty of cultural misunderstandings to boot) So take my advice when going into these convoluted and yes, oh so entertaining waters, take it one step at a time.
Either way, most people will have a blast with this series. Its fun for the whole family, if you don't mind a little casual nudity.(this goes back to that whole cultural misunderstanding thing) Enjoy = )",1028937600,4,1570,4.567375886524823
1716558,4,B000067J2W,"If you liked the first and second seasons of Ranma, then you will love the third ^_^  Ranma is still trying to reverse his curse, but with lots of problems between.  Shampoo is back and has lots of tricks up her sleeve in order to get Ranma for herself.  And Ryoga is still trying to confess his feelings to Akane.  Happosai is up to his regular tricks, and... WHAT IS THIS?! ANOTHER FIANCEE?
Animation: 4 out of 5
Quality: 5 out of 5
Sound: 5 out of 5
I did experience a few problems though.  The first, which isn't really a problem, is that my box is the same as the picture shown, but it has Ryoga on instead of girl-type Ranma.  Another problem I experienced was that occasionally, there wouldn't be a subtitle; this only happened once or twice though, nothing too big.  The biggest problem though, was that in episodes 22 and 23, there was no Japanese audio, both tracks were in English.  Maybe this is just my DVD player, but I doubt it.  The dub isn't horrible to listen too, and the subs still work, so it's not too bad.
Other than that, it was wonderful; Ranma delivers the same hilarity as usual.  I was satisfied.",1028592000,4,1124,4.3349282296650715

7963173,4,B000067J2W,This was a cute season. It has some very funny moments. I enjoy the fact that the DVDs give you the option of watching them in the original Japanese with English subtitles. My only issue is that the series tend to drift away from the original manga a bit.,1360022400,,255,4.224489795918367
7963174,5,B000067J2W,"Fun set of disks.  Keeps the flavor of the manga while adding new material.  Especially fun if you are familiar with Japanese culture and customs.  The overall series is one of the best martial arts spoofs ever.

Warning - not for the younger set.",1167782400,,247,4.545454545454546
7963175,5,B000067J2W,"So many ladies, so little time. That's the top subject in the world of `Ranma '. The third season comes in full swing giving Ranma more to worry about than just trying to survive a day with out ticking off Akane. Just when he thought things were settling down an old friend makes her return. Her name is Ukyo, another tomboy but cuter and she makes a pretty tasty Japanese pizza. Oh and she also happens to be Ranma's fianc. Now Ranma has to ward off four girls and a guy (don't worry he only goes after him in girl form) just to get some time to him self.

But now something is wrong. Apparently Ryoga is in love with Akane and just can't seem to muster the courage to take her away from Ranma, why Ranma...are you jealous?
Mousse is still on Ranma's trail and will stop at nothing to win the heart of Shampoo even if it means teaming up with Ryoga, Tatewake Kuno and even Ranma...(yes you read it right) to do so. And watch out for Shampoo's little sisters Ranma, Amazonians are a force to be reckoned with no matter how young.  Suit up and come hungry for an exciting new season as the whole gang takes on the mysteries of the paranormal. Ghosts of the past and present haunt the ally-ways of Japan and inner demons lash out to take control of their own. Dive into history of Happosai and Shampoo's great grandmother Cologne and the strange love story that happened long ago. Hey they may even make a quick stop at Jusenkiyo while they're at it! Even the peon servant of the Kuno kids, Sezuke will have his moment in the sun in this season. Friendships will grow, hearts will be broken and food of all kinds will be eaten by the boatloads. As a whole, it's a season full of enjoyable memories.

7963176,5,B000067J2W,"This is by far the best show. If you want funny action this is what you need. These are some of the best episodes reoga & akane together for ever ,transform Akane the super duper girl,all it takes the kiss of love or the kiss of death,the last days of happosai,and ukyo's skirt !the girly girl gambit. BUT BE WARNED THERE IS NUDE.But it worth every last penney.",1075248000,,361,4.323529411764706
7963177,5,B000067J2W,"Well, a major change happens in this season.  We're introduced to Ukyo Kuonji, okonomiyaki master and yet another fiancee to Ranma.  Personally, I can't stand her, but oh well.  It does seem that Kelly Sheridan does a pretty good starting job for the anime, but then again, she did have some extra time to get Ukyo's voice right(she previously did her voice in a few Ranma OVAs and movies).  Still, I do like Hitomi Tsuru a bit better(who's also Meryl in Trigun and Bulma in the Dragonball series)  This also happens to be the only season that doesn't have any mutli-part episodes.  Not one.  The English cast finally seems to be mastering the voices, even Sarah Strange, which is a bit upsetting, since this was also the final season in which she did Ranma's English voice, as Richard Cox(Inu-Yasha, X-Men Evolution, Mobile Suit Gundam, Zoids) did the voice afterwards.  I think this is the best season of Ranma yet, although season 6 is my personal favorite.  It's definitely worth watching, but like other people said, watch out for the defective disk 5, which has English-dubbing only for the 22nd and 23rd episodes!",1068076800,2,1120,4.791666666666667
7963178,5,B000067J2W,"If you are a Ranma fan this is a must get set. For one thing it continues on from the 2nd season and introduces the very cute Ukyo, another Ranma fiance and an important character in future episodes.
There is much less continuity in this season compares to seasons 1 & 2. Some of the episodes are very weak and don't really build on the overall story.  However, there are a few very strong episodes must see episodes that reveal very interesting details about the background of key characters such as the relationship between Happosai and Shampoo's great great grandmother. Some episodes are a must see just because they are simply very very funny.",1063152000,2,648,4.684210526315789
7963179,5,B000067J2W,"Season Three of Ranma 1/2 introduces us to yet another of Ranma's many fiances. This one is Ukyou Kounji, an okonomiyaki chef from an all boys school, looking to sautee Ranma for a prior jilting. Just one catch; Ukyou...is a GIRL! (But, hey, Ranma's both.)
Once that is cleared up, face disaster as pint-sized perverted Happosai unleashes his deadliest (and corniest) attack of all, the dread Happo-Fire Burst.
Shampoo is up to no good, and she's got a mind-controlling mushroom at her disposal this time.
Ukyou and Ryoga team up to break up Ranma and Akane.
An old flame of Ukyou's shows up in town to stretch the gender bender hilarity to its gut bustingly funniest level.
All this, and more hijinks and humor with all the old favorites. This is one of the best seasons of Ranma 1/2, and you'd be crazy to miss it.",1053129600,2,816,4.595890410958904
7963180,4,B000067J2W,"You know the phrase?  That's where a series gets as good as it's going to get, then starts to decline.  There are a lot of really good takahashi-writen episodes here (and a few bad amateur-written ones) until they come to the anything goes obstacle race. Bad art, butchered story, poor quality control.  It's not the only bad story in this set, but for me it marks the beginning of a slow decline for the series. I still reccomend getting this.  In spite of a few duds, there's a lot to like here, and it's still a good bargain for your anime dollar.",1051574400,,550,4.362745098039215
