8565126,1,B00BB0FPRG,"Worst workout video I've ever purchased, 15 minutes of watching a guy on a tennis court do elementary ab workouts. Had I been able to preview this video I never would have purchased it. I feel duped by Amazon and am beyond frustrated that they have a no-tolerance return policy for digital content, while also not allowing content to be previewed.",1443225600,,347,4.704918032786885
8565127,5,B00BB0FPRG,By simply sticking to the program u definitely get results. Takes dedication but worth it! And the stretching exercises are unique to recover fast.,1362787200,,147,5.166666666666667
8565128,5,B00BB0FPRG,The author does a great job of explaining the exercises and adding pictures. There are lots of exercises to choose from for all levels. I am very glad I bought this!,1360713600,,165,4.354838709677419
8565129,5,B00BB0FPRG,Finally an ab workout that actually works! After trying so many other workouts I finally found one that worked. As a former athlete I felt the exercises could be targeted to athletes and people that are just beginning to train. Great!,1360713600,,234,4.7317073170731705
