5087741,5,B007I1Q4TU,This is an incredibly educational show.  My four year old loves it and has been watching it over and over.  I'm not sure he fully grasps the concepts - maybe a little advanced - but nevertheless he likes it and is picking up a little bit.  I think next year he'll be really ready for it if he's still interested.,1358467200,3,312,4.166666666666667

5087769,5,B007I1Q4TU,"When my administrator asked me, 10 minutes before the start of the winter holiday break, to come up with a 30 minute Health lesson on the first day back from said break for a grade I don't teach, I immediately thought of the Magic School bus.  I came to amazon to search and here it was.  The video I was looking for (the one where they take a ""field trip"" through the digestive system) was here, along w/three bonus, and related, videos.  The price was right, since it was out of my own pocket especially, and I look forward to utilizing all three videos w/my students.  They are entertaining AND educational.",1398643200,3,610,4.468468468468468
5087770,5,B007I1Q4TU,"I watched this with my 4 yr old granddaughter.  She was enthralled.  She couldn't stop watching it.  Very educational and I should know, I'm a retired science teacher.  Her parents limit her as to how much TV & Video she can watch so I stopped after about 1/2 hour.  She begged me to let her watch, ""just a little more.""  She was almost in tears.
