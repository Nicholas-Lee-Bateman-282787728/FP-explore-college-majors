1919115,5,B0000CEYQT,This set is very helpful for getting started.  It provides some basics in just about every category.  Techniques are clearly explained and demonstrated.  Highly recommended!,1142812800,2,173,5.84
1919116,5,B0000CEYQT,always learn from an instructor. but this is a good reference for people who are eager to learn more. renzo is great and so is the kukuk guy. the fights are really cool. Gracie Barra Academys are the best place to learn jiu jitsu. they have produced the most champions. look them up and come trian. but the video series is good!,1129939200,3,328,4.306451612903226
1919117,4,B0000CEYQT,"This was my first set of VHS instructional tapes in BJJ so many years ago.  It motivated me to study BJJ with Craig Kukuk in Red Bank, New Jersey.  Craig is an excellent teacher.  I also went to Renzo Gracie's first BJJ tournament, held in his school in lower Manhattan.  Craig and Renzo are both class acts, very friendly, informal, and terrific guys.  They are great teachers too.",1129248000,,382,4.5588235294117645
1919118,5,B0000CEYQT,"This 12 disc set helps show why Renzo Gracie is one of the world's top jiu jitsu teachers.  The basics are clearly presented here in a logical sequence, and they work!  You won't find the latest and greatest sweeps, but there is enough content here to last months and months of practice.  Renzo's style is to introduce simple moves, gradually building in complexity.  This makes the set appropriate for all levels - especially as such a cheap price.

Enjoy!",1114646400,17,457,4.734177215189874
1919119,3,B0000CEYQT,"This is one of the earlier tape sets. You won't find any flash techniques and you won't find the ""game development"" type format prevalent today. What you will find is good, solid techniques the beginner and early intermediate can incorporate immediately.

This set leverages Craig Kukuk's clear instruction style and Renzo Gracie's intricate knowledge. It shows great details to techniques you can use.

The more advanced BJJ practitioner might not learn a great deal of new stuff, but it's probably worth a look. I picked up a lot of good stuff, especially from the headlock tape.

The set has been eclipsed as an instructional, now, but is a great resource for the beginner.",1109808000,21,676,4.964601769911504
1919120,5,B0000CEYQT,"this is a very good dvd set for anyone looking to learn jiu jitsu, .. they teach you in a way that you'll learn it easily. for the price, i highly reccomend it",1070496000,5,159,3.8484848484848486
1919121,5,B0000CEYQT,"This is great deal! I purchased this set years ago for much more money. To have it on DVD is a nice touch because you can jump to any technique you want. Renzo Gracie is great. For the money, this is the best deal on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu instructional videos you will ever find.",1067817600,3,277,4.245283018867925
7999199,5,B0000CEYQT,Renzo Gracies instructional DVD explains in a progressive and logically coherent way effective and time-tested Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques. I highly recommend his instructional DVD.,1516838400,,184,6.708333333333333
7999200,4,B0000CEYQT,excellent learning tool video is easy to follow can see different angles and able to learn each move from watching,1455321600,,114,4.75
7999201,2,B0000CEYQT,This is for beginners. Not recommend.,1415232000,,37,5.333333333333333
7999202,5,B0000CEYQT,"The DVDs are brand new and are just an amazing source of instruction even for the beginner like myself!

Thank you brother!",1360195200,,123,4.590909090909091
7999203,2,B0000CEYQT,"This is a great DVD for people just starting Jiu Jitsu.  Very old school, good moves, but if you are an intermediate blue and up it will look very redundant.",1195516800,4,157,4.233333333333333
7999204,3,B0000CEYQT,"The overall present is very good. However, some of the manuvers are dated particularly techniques for breaking the guard. Applying the technique shown on this DVD can result in creating an opportunity for the person in the guard using the technique shown to be placed in an armbar or trinagle choke.  I expected more from this DVD.",1188172800,4,331,4.807017543859649
7999205,4,B0000CEYQT,"This DVD set is a great beginners gi instructional.  For the novice, this instructional will give you good demonstration of fundamentals.  Renzo & associate explain the techniques in great detail (maybe a little too much--I found the multiple replays of the move from different camera angles a little annoying).  This is not a DVD for a person with more than basic understanding of the art as you won't find any fancy techniques like x-guard, rubberguard, e.t.c",1186876800,2,461,5.0394736842105265
7999206,4,B0000CEYQT,"As a white belt new to the sport, I find these DVDs very helpful and easy to follow.  The best part is that the techniques work.",1168992000,,128,3.923076923076923
7999207,4,B0000CEYQT,"Renzo and Craig's video takes you through a comprehensive crash course in BJJ.  The techniques in the video are extremely detailed and each clip reviews the technique at least 5 times.  The DVD format is useful to review a particular area (i.e. choke, escapes, passing the guard, etc).  I highly recommend the video for any person just starting off in BJJ or even intermediate practitioners who are just looking to brush off on some technical aspects of the moves.",1167782400,,464,4.848101265822785
7999208,5,B0000CEYQT,"This instructional DVD set was pretty thorough. I was kind of under the impression it would be an Instructional Series on ""No-Gi"" Jiu-Jitsu and while they do show many techniques that are used without needing the Gi so much, half of it or more did utilize the Gi for one thing or another.

As far as quality goes, the information was fantastic and showed many variations of common techniques along with key points to allow you to perfect your techniques a little better which I found extremely valuable, DVD quality was pretty decent, and the Audio was great. Renzo Gracie speaks very good English which is easy to understand.",1162771200,4,626,4.743119266055046
