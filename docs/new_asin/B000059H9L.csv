1407539,5,B000059H9L,"By far the greatest compilation of Michael Jordan footage (not just quantity, but quality, too.) Very well put together - the sections are amazing (especially the top 10 lists,) it flows well, the footage quality is unbeleivable, there's simply no wasted space on this one. If you liked Michael or hated him, you can't deny he was great, and here you get to see all of his best moments. Plus, you can just buy this instead of trying to find all of his best VHS tapes - they're all here in their entirety! All NBA fans should have this, so that ten years down the line, we can remember how the greatest used to play the game. Simply amazing.",1004054400,,640,4.38655462184874

First of all, it includes all the videos from Come Fly with Me, Michael Jordan's Playground, Airtime, Above and Beyond and a new one His Airness.  Then to top it all of, it includes all of Michael's best plays ( dunks, assists, moves ), a documentary on his shoes, highlights from his eight greatest games, a musical tribute and whole bunch of DVD rom features that I haven't had the chance to go over because I lack a DVD-rom in my computer.",1003968000,,590,4.20353982300885

This will be it for all the Jordan collections if he didn't come back for the Wizards. However, it doesn't decrease just how valuable these DVDs is for fan like me.

1407543,5,B000059H9L,"If you like me missed Michael Jordan's rookie year in the NBA and think that Vince (half-man half amazing) Carter can Jam you gotta see this DVD! It contains all Jordan videos including Come fly with me, his first video which shows Michael dunking on pretty much every big man in the league! Have you seen pictures of his Slam Dunk championships and thought the dunks looked good wait till you see them in motion! The action is absolutely mind blowing, the earlier videos amaze you with pure athleticism and whilst they progress they document his struggle with retirement and then his comeback, and even though the latter years were far more ""grounded"" in comparison (even though he flushed down on Mutumbo something nasty!) it shows him developing to be one arguably the most well-rounded player to have graced the basketball court.",988070400,8,833,4.873239436619718

The only con I have with the collection is the video/audio could have been better but overall it still gets 5 Stars.

If you are a true Jordan fan you must have this item, it's something you can watch every now n then and it never ceases to amaze.

We watched the set and he commented the WHOLE time we watched it, big eyed like a kid in the candy store. He and my son watch the set before they go out to play basketball every weekend (they think they can play like Micheal Jordan).

This was definitely a great buy; very cheap and it has several hours of footage.  It has interviews and whatnot, but it's not all that; they have top ten shots and dunks among other things.  Would recommend to any basketball fan out there.",1323129600,,382,4.352112676056338
1407597,3,B000059H9L,"I remember reading in the profile of this that there would be 4 DVDs and a few full games. The CDs only have snippets of Jordan's ultumate moments. Disappointed, I was hoping to see some great games he played esp. with Pippen and Rodman in full. Also, the story telling looked a bit artificial, and unnecessary.",1271462400,2,311,4.571428571428571

1407601,5,B000059H9L,"I recorded two Michael Jordan videos, one of 'em was ""Come Fly with Me"", many years ago (on a betamax!) and watched it over and over. Several years and Bull's championships later, I got this DVD and it is one of my best buys of the summer! I liked the MJ moves and plays as well as the backstage drama a lot. Watching this DVD wants  you to beg for more, as I can still remember seeing some spectacular MJ moves, but did not appear on this DVD set (like when he hovers like a helicopter before laying the ball gently into the hole). I also wish they have the full versions of the Dunk contests.

His recent foray into the NBA (not a subject of the DVD), while he did contribute to the team significantly on the court, is somewhat a small tragedy for the MJ fan, as he has lost a step and the springs on his legs (and he might have been too harsh to some of his teammates). One reminisces how he used to blow by his defenders with such grace and ease.",1096761600,,950,4.074866310160428
1407602,5,B000059H9L,"First of all let me tell you that Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player and nobody will beat him, never. When you look at players like Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, Tracy Mcgrady you say hmm they are good but Jordan has the heart to play, none of them has it except maybe Iverson. Jordan always wanted to win and he did. In the dvd, you have 5 programs that explain what i just said and many other things, 5 great programs. Also, you have a lot of special features like his greatest plays. Buy this, even if you don't like basketball, even if you hate basketball because Michael Jordan is out of this world, he flys, he's just the greatest. I always wanted to follow basketball, at that time, the jordan time but I did not like that but with this dvd I see what I've been missing, it's borring to watch basketball when you saw jordan play.",1093737600,,848,4.339622641509434
1407603,5,B000059H9L,"I used to think that players of today, such as Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter, and Allen Iverson could have taken on Jordan one on one, but after watching the DVD it made it very clear why people always talk about him as the best player EVER.  It is a must watch if not a must own.  I hope that another DVD is made about the life after his second retirement to going to the Wizards front office into playing again",1090368000,,423,4.146341463414634
1407604,5,B000059H9L,"In the last weeks since the 2003-04 NBA season ended, the Pistons have been crowned champs, Phil has moved back to the mountains, Shaq is dipping into the Atlantic Ocean, and Kobe is still being heralded as the current Michael Jordan. All of this makes me feel only one thing. I miss watching Michael Jordan play basketball. I miss him on and off the court as an NBA fan. I wish they would stop crowning future Michael Jordans. There is only one. And this is his DVD collection. If you want to be reminded of what greatness in basketball is, get this DVD. Watch it, remember the good times, and once again love basketball.",1089849600,,622,4.464912280701754

1407607,5,B000059H9L,"Prior to buyng this dvd, I had only read books about Jordan and heard about him. After I was through watching the excellent collection of programs and the slew of special features, I had been captivated by the perfect blend of in-depth Jordan information and amazing highlights. This dvd is worth at least $30, but is selling for less than half. If you have only heard about his greatness, or even if you lived to see it,THIS DVD IS A MUST BUY. Much of the footage will have your mind blown from his unbeleivable exploits. Not only that, but the film quality and different perspectives from legendary players and coaches are great. Most of the narration is flawless and the music goes right along with the flow of the programs. It even comes with an exclusive booklet filled with Jordan pictures and quotes. The case which it comes in has an eye-catching and intresting interior and exterior. This dvd is one of my most valueble,and after watching it, I guarentee you will be jumping off your seat to the nearest court to shoot some hoops.",1085702400,3,1039,4.621621621621622
1407608,4,B000059H9L,"This collection is as inspiring as it was when I first watched 'Come Fly With Me' about ten years ago.
The soundtrack, the footage, the insight into Michael's thoughts, the breathtaking shots its all here.
What I hadn't seen was the two more recent documentaries, 'Above and Beyond' and 'His Airness'. All I can say is don't expect much from the latter. Its full of about 3/4s rehashed material, old interviews from 'Airtime' and before, and you won't see a many bits of footage that you haven't seen before. It needlessly covers everything that all the previous videos have covered, and provides little insight into the later comeback seasons that made MJ an even greater legend than he already was.
MJ's first 3 videos were the most exciting sports films I've ever seen, 'His Airness' and to a lesser extent 'Above and Beyond' in my mind are nothing more than rehashes of old material with a different voiceover.
Worth getting, but I just was very dissappointed with the last 2 videos.",1085616000,,987,4.777777777777778

The quality of the movies is excellent, the sound as well. The extra features are fantastic offering short video highlights of Jordan's top ten assists, dunks and passes, as well as dunk comp highlights and nice pieces of footage of Jordan's 10 most significant matches in the NBA. The ""It's Gotta Be The Shoes"" feature is somewhat of a let down as I was expecting the individual commerceials themselves rather than a backstage look at them. Otherwise, this DVD is perfect!

I saw it first at a friend- Nat's house, and I told myself that ""I'm gonna get meself one of this and along with Jordan to the Max"". The way how all the moves were compiled together are just awesome, and the graphics are just the BEST!!! This is just the best DVD I've ever saw.
Some of the footages were just wonderful, there were so many great memories of the games from the greatest basketball player, and he is one that exemplified it all and it were all kept in this 2 discs pack.

From a collection standpoint this DVD is fantastic. The reason I marked it down is due to the terrible Dolby Digital conversion. In Dolby the entire collection echos like in a tin can...it's bad trust me...to the point where you have to switch to pro logic sound to approach normality. This was very disappointing after seeing and hearing the MJ to the Max - IMAX conversion to DVD which sounds great in Dolby Digital.
If having digital sound is not important to you than get the collection.....
If you are a Home Theater Fan you'll be disappointed.",1013040000,3,1005,4.588888888888889

I am a really passionate fan of Michael Jordan and for anyone who enjoys Jordan not only on the Court but also as a human individual this impressive DVD package takes you on a journey to discover the distinctive and truely outstanding Michael Jordan. Starting from his days as a North Carolina schoolkid where he made the game winning shot to bring the NCAA championship to North Caronlina and ending in 1998 where Jordan captured his second NBA threepeat by hitting the last shot in the finals against the Utah Jazz, this DVD is a complete and breathtaking coverage of Michael Jordans unique career.
Displaying the many facets of his fantastic game and elegance on the court, its a must have not only for Jordan fans but also for people who are seeking for motivation in their lives. His compeling story is a  motivation to work even harder for our goals. I can highly recommend this  DVD to anyone who loves to get inspired by this truely indisputable Sports Legend of our time.
Enjoy!!!!!",1011744000,,1000,4.708571428571428

I initially thought there was no data and returned it but the same problem came up. I have seen disc two though and it was great. I just need to figure our if the other disc can play on other dvd players.,1010102400,,305,3.935483870967742
1407626,5,B000059H9L,"Its good, go get it now.  Well at least for those who don't already have Come Fly with Me, MJ's Playground, Air Time, Above & Beyond, and His Airness in their video collections.  Each of the films on the DVD outlines a certain period of his career.  CFWM and MJ's Playground detail the young Jordan, before he could beat the Pistons and the Bad Boys.  Don't mind the bad productions in both, and just skip the playground scenes with the kid.  Air Time and Above & Beyond, well sit back and enjoy.  The last one is just a summary of his career, so there are repeat clips and interviews.  The bonuses are great, all the great dunks and moves are included, and the Memories section has some humorous and touching recounts by other pros.  I especially liked the reaction of Darrell Armstrong during his first game when MJ went out for an open court dunk.  Everything for the MJ Junkie is here, so get it right now.",1008720000,,910,4.401197604790419

I'm not a technophile and don't really understand how these things work, but I guess I thought that in the process of putting it onto DVD the seller/manufacturer would ""clean up"" the videos.  I will definitely keep this in mind before purchasing any other kinds of sports videos.

That said, my son enjoyed seeing Michael Jordan play.  My son loves all things Jordan, which is so funny since Mike hung up his shoes well before my son was born.",1471219200,,502,4.606741573033708
