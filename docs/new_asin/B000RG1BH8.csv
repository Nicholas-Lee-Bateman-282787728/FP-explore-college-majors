8200491,5,B000RG1BH8,it was really great... i like Marc Ribot's guitar playing on Tom Waits' records... i had heard some of his avant garde albums on Rhapsody and didn't know what to think... this film's music wasn't any less strange but it was great to see the artist and hear what he said.,1401840000,,270,4.313725490196078
8200492,5,B000RG1BH8,"That I new I would never see without purchase, insight into the mind of one of the most interesting session players active today.",1377561600,,129,4.6521739130434785
8200493,3,B000RG1BH8,"Ribot is tight and right - a fine NYC player with gravitas, hooks, chops, and the chutzpah to pull off whatever he's got in his sights. The live bits on this DVD are great - lots of ebb and flow - he's confident and deserves to be.

When he speaks, it's a splash of cold water (in January, in NYC). A little too much bluster and light on substance. Not at first, but after awhile, his introspection is cloying. Still a fine release - the live stuff worth the $$$ alone.",1250294400,2,469,4.153846153846154
8200494,5,B000RG1BH8,"Marc Ribot is one of those chameleonic guitarists who can (and does) play with anyone, regardless of style... he always brings something unexpected to the table, and never disappoints.  This DVD features footage of some great performances-- solo, with the Lounge Lizards, with his own groups, and great interviews with not only Ribot but some of his closest friends and associates.  If you have any interest at all in his music you'll love this DVD, if not, you'll be introduced to one of the greats of modern guitar.",1246838400,2,517,4.863636363636363
8200495,4,B000RG1BH8,"a great vid about ribot,one of the more creative guitarist on the scene..even if you are a diehard bopper you have to at least love this guys energy and constant move to the creative side of things. He knows ""tunes"",but chooses to re-shape them into something fresh and new.",1246492800,,274,4.612244897959184
