1446956,1,B00005JLNB,"I went to see Pinocchio (don't ask why) but I was expecting something a little better than what I am glad I didn't pay to see. The look of the film was wonderful, a likely sort of farie tale look to it, but the dubbing reminded me of those old Kungfu movies I used to see as a kid. I mean it was pretty awful! The dubbing of Pinocchio is was the proverbial nail in the coffin for this movie, it was not just annoying as somebody scraping a chalkboard but it was down right painful to endure. I saw kids dozing off or running around the movie theater ignoring the movie entirely. THIS WAS THE WORSE MOVIE OF THE SUMMER! I would rather see Hudson Hawk nine hundred times in one sitting than see this movie a second time, this time all the way through! This movie is probably played in some low circle of Hades as a form of eternal punishment!",1049587200,12,840,4.159509202453988
1446957,2,B00005JLNB,"[The following review refers to the original version.]  Let's face it.  I don't want to say this, but Roberto Begnigni's new film, live-action version about the story of Pinoccio is a huge disappointment.
Not that everything in it is bad, I tell you.  On the contrary, you have Danilo Donati (famous for Felini's films) as production/costume designer.  You also have Academy-nominee Dante Spinotti as photographer, whose works in such as ""The Last of the Mohicans"" ""The Insider"" ""LA Confidential"" are all memorable.  Plus, Nocola Piovani gives good soundtrack as in ""Life Is Beautiful,"" and even people from America help immensely with Rob Hodgson (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"").  But the result is quite unsatisfactory, even though we hear that this film became a big hit in Italy.  But why?
It's Roberto Benigni as the star (not the director) of the film who should be blamed.  You just cannot accuse the people at The Golden Raspberry Awards of giving him an award.  If they find that Benigni's decision to cast himself as the titular wooden puppet unacceptable, that is only natural.  I share their thought, too, and while I was watching the film, I tried to find any reason that he should be in the title role.  I do not object his jumping around or talking fast itself.  It is just that he is NOT that puppet, Pinocchio, no matter how he does.
In his country where films are more influantial than in Japan or in USA, Benigni has been seen as a sort of cultural icon, not just a comedian.  That makes his decison understandable to take up a beloved story of Pinocchio as subject matter, but it is also an undeniable fact that he could have made the film better and more accesible internationally by staying back behind the camera, not in front of it.  If the film is meant only for domestic market, his appearance could be justified, but as he is now known world-wide after the success of ""Life Is Beautiful,"" he should have been more cautious.
A few words about the way of adapting the story.  The film, unlike classic Disney animation or the recent live-action made in 1996 (starring Martin Landou), follows pretty faithfully the original story by Carlo Collodi.  But as the original story was serialized in a periodical for children, and twice entended because of its huge popularity, the original book has some inconsistency in the plot.  (Believe or not, Pinocchio is once killed after 15 chapters of the book, but given another life later to continue the story!)
As a consequence, in this film, you may not be sure whether or not The Talking Cricket is really dead; moreover, the identity of The Blue Fairy is very ambiguous.  These apparently incoherent elements are brought into the film without being modified much from the original.  The film adaptations of ""Pinocchio"" in the past solved the problem by simply smoothing out the jarring factors, simplifying the story, but Benigni just didn't follow suit.  If you have read the original book recenty, you will see his point; otherwise, you may be irritated by the story's a bit redundant nature.
I don't think that the film is as bad as some people say.  Still, it is true that Benigni's portrayal as Pinocchio is ineffective and often annoying.  I like him and his partner Nicoletta Braschi (as The Blue Fairy); I really admire their sweet and creative relations represented in ""Life Is Beautiful.""  But ""Pinoccio"" just doesn't show that to me.",1048464000,11,3414,4.818181818181818
1446958,4,B00005JLNB,"This summer a great film was released in America. That film is called Pinocchio. I didn't expect this movie to be any good after the negative press and critcally shutdown. I saw it because I wanted to try out a foriegn movie, and I heard there were alot of celebrity dubbed voices. Eric Idle,Glenn Close,Breckin Myer,Kevin James,Regis Philbin,and Jim Bulisi. It was fun trying to figure out which characters has those voices.
This movie was made in Italy by Roberto Bennigni who was the star in Life is Beautiful. He also wrote,directed,and starred in this epic film event. The movie is nothing like the oringal Disney version which I thought is great. It gives the film it's own spotlight. The movie is a remake but if has it's own style of pacing and special effects.
Bennigni has so much energy and power in bringing a beloved character to the silver screen. His acting is wonderful as is the prose of the words. My only complaint is that they should have had a seprate version with English subtitles. They couldn't do that with one version because it's a kids movie. How many kids know Italian? Two would have been good. One for kids and one for the people who want subtitles.
Everyone probally knows what the plot of this movie is about but I'll explain. One night the Blue Fairy and a king are riding in a carriage. Without knowing it the Blue Fairy's power's turn a block of wood alive. The block travels all over the town and ends up in front of a house. The house belongs to Gepettio. He makes a wooden puppet but the puppet comes alive. In a white outfit and a hat made of bread Pinocchio goes to school but unfortuatly trouble ensures. After losing all of his money from a cat and a fox Pinchocio tries to make everything right. But Pinchocio has a nack for causing trouble...which is just what happens.
With beautiful senerny and Oscar winning acting this version of Pinocchio is great for people of all ages. It's a big shame that this movie didn't make alot of money in the box office. Hopefully it will do good on video.
ENJOY!",1042934400,11,2042,4.521621621621621
1446959,4,B00005JLNB,"I must admit I actually liked this version of Pinocchio.  :-)  The out-of-sync dubbing, I suppose, is to be expected.  You can't expect to make English-speaking voices and Italian-speaking mouths match up perfectly.
I personally would have much preferred to see it in the original Italian.  I think that would have made a huge difference -- just like it does with any movie in a language other than English.
Another thing -- FORGET Disney!  It is nothing at all like the Disney story.  And I think it is very nice to see an alternate version.  And this one is made in Italy, by Italians, so it has a very homegrown touch to it.  ;-)
The only problem I could see was that it is a bit more childish than Benigni's last film, ""Life Is Beautiful"".  He goes from a touching Holocaust tragedy to a fanciful straight-up comedy.  So I suppose that might pose a difficulty.
Other than that, I did like it!  My advice is, again, to try to see it in the original Italian, subtitled in English.  And try to steer clear of the Disney-propagated Pinocchio image.",1042329600,9,1048,4.51595744680851
1446960,4,B00005JLNB,"I found the movie to be a visual delight with Roberto as the mischievous boy puppet and his wife, Nicoletta as the Blue Fairy.  The scenery was soothing and the special effects highly entertaining.  I would have left the dubbing  out.  I was disappointed not to hear the movie in Italian, only to hear Roberto singing while the credits were rolling.  The dubbing took away from the fact that it is an Italian story.  I would like to see it in its native language with english sub titles.",1041120000,7,487,4.4772727272727275
1446961,1,B00005JLNB,"I haven't usually written reviews.  This movie just moved me to do so, however.  It nearly moved me out of the theater after 45 minutes, too.  If not for the fact that my two children were watching, I would have split.
OK, so the English over-dubbing was to be expected, but it was done poorly creating a soundtrack that seemed not to fit with the movie.  Either the volume or the synchronization or the character of the voice was off.  The characters had so little connection between them that you wondered why some of them cared about each other (e.g. the fairy caring for Pinocchio).  Benigni was, at times, so farcical as to be annoying.  Things happened in disjointed sequences.
All in all, I wouldn't even wait for the video.  Be a good boy and spend your gold on something else.",1040947200,11,785,4.5177304964539005
1446962,5,B00005JLNB,"Roberto Benigni has done it again: he pulled off a fantastic experience by bringing a fresh approach to an over-worked genre. And by doing so, he has delivered a humbling blow to the Disney Studios - the monopolist of the genre. This is a children's story worthy of adult viewership. It melds the best of both the cinematic and theatrical worlds to an astounding effect. It is a movies' movie: It would have been viewed enthusiastically at Cinema Paradiso, had it preceded that wonderful memoir. The soundtrack works its magic in this composition of color and light. This is a seminal work, free and clear of any obligation to formulaic convention, while speaking eloquently the lanuage of the medium.
This film, however, is dubbed into English. I would appreciate the option to view it with subtitles in the original Italian.",1040947200,9,826,4.9071428571428575
1447041,5,B00005JLNB,"I purchased this DVD to show it to my students for our Italian class. Well, not only the DVD was like new. It was a double DVD (2 DVDs in the same case), one in Italian with subtitles and one dubbed in English. I gave the English version to a friend of mine whose kid is 5 years old and loves Pinocchio! Thank you Amazon!",1305676800,,321,3.953846153846154
1447042,5,B00005JLNB,This film was absolutely wonderful. I have no idea why it would get bad reviews. I am in my 20's and enjoyed it thoroughly. Being a huge fan of Benigni and Braschi helps. But I am going to say DO NOT watch the english version it's not good. I have no idea why they dubbed such a beautiful film with someone's voice that does severe injustice to Roberto's exuberant voice. But the Italian version is beautiful. Roberto is NOT to old as Pinocchio he is Pinocchio. In all of his films you see a touch of Pinocchio in his performances. Nicoletta Braschi as the blue fairy was so beautiful. I think it's her best acting yet. She was just amazing. I would recommend the Italian version to everyone. Really visually beautiful and it's a beautiful story. Don't listen to the bad reviews this is a beautiful film.,1275609600,3,804,4.476190476190476
1447043,5,B00005JLNB,"This is a most excellent example of wondrous film making and excellent acting. Roberto Benigni's  Pinocchio accurately portrays the 19th century story by Carlo Collodi. The book is a literary masterpiece. Collodi chose a child of the poor as his protagonist. Through Pinocchio, who learns important lessons during his adventures, the writer reveals a political and social consciousness that is timeless.

The magnificence of this film is many faceted. There is color and magic of the presentation, extraordinary acting, and the true spirit of Carlo Collodi within. Please watch this in Italian. The subtitles are done well. You will miss much of the magic with the dubbed version.",1259712000,2,680,5.287037037037037

1447045,1,B00005JLNB,"WOW - positively the most painfully self-important nonsense EVER!

Ed Wood lives in this disgraceful, utterly shameful mess; what was he thinking, running around in PJ's-? This is the same as Ed Wood running around in drag in GLEN OR GLENDA.

Yes, it's that bad - Roberto is Ed Wood on a big budget, and immolates himself utterly; I say this because Ed had no problems destroying himself on film, making an utter fool of himself and thought it was ART; this film is the same, only on a much bigger scale of incompetence; it's beyond painful, it's nauseating; for pete's sake he's supposed to be a ""little boy"" and he's a grown man with beard stubble, prancing around like a damn fool; truly sickening; maybe it's a gay thing.

The problem is he cast HIMSELF as the star and had no idea how stupid and foolish he looks running amok in pajamas; it's sick and grotesque; how could he not see this??  It's even worse than Jar Jar Binks !

I suffered through both versions, the dub and sub - guess what? they BOTH suck! And I'm being kind; if you've suffered thru PHANTOM MENACE and other Lucas horrors, you know what I mean - nobody wanted to say NO  to Roberto, no matter how crushingly awful;

This is a DISASTER, so embarrassingly bad it just makes you wonder about money and corruption, and why anyone would commit suicide on film;

Ed, you've met your match!",1242259200,,1359,4.473684210526316
1447046,5,B00005JLNB,"This is an amazing, funny, warm, flim. I too had my doubts due to the reviews but if you like funny, classic, beautiful scenery and sets I highly reccomend you give this film a look. Watch it in Italian!",1240790400,,203,4.230769230769231
1447047,5,B00005JLNB,"I'm not the first one here and won't be the last to say, ""please watch it in Italian!"" To my big surprise, the setting, the music and even Benigni's acting were great. Like many of you, I had also thought at least several times how the heck a 50 years old man can portray Pinocchio before watching this film. When I was a child, the Disney's version was painful for me to watch as if I knew that something just didn't quite match. I'm surprised that I actually like the story for the first time!",1232236800,,495,4.221052631578948
1447048,4,B00005JLNB,"A few weeks after having read an English translation of Collodi's original tale to my four year old daughter, I rented this movie, largely out of morbid interest in its reputation as one of the worst films of the decade. What I found left me flabbergasted - at how far off the mark American reviewers had been with near unanimity. Perhaps one needs to be familiar with the original story, or perhaps the dubbing was indeed a remarkable disaster (I only saw the film in Italian with subtitles), but for my daughter, uncomprehending of Italian and too young to read subtitles yet never lost for a moment, as well as for me, the scenes we beheld respectively carried us through the film in rapt silence. There is no doubt that that the playfulness and allegorical richness of Collodi's work as well as Benigni's reverence for the tale radiate from this film. I fear that so many American reviewers simply lacked the patience to try to find or even guess at its proper context. I hope that some of them will someday venture a reassessment. Watch this film, but only after you've absorbed the original tale.",1194825600,3,1102,4.656410256410257
1447049,5,B00005JLNB,"I would like to join in here in saying that this is a great film and shamefully underrated.  Now, this is not the fault of the critics, but the fault of Miramax, who made one of the most bone headed decisions ever in their lifetime when they decided to dub this film into English.  The dubbing is absolute zero.  I didn't even bother with that version.  The Italian with English subtitle version is the one to see, and it's a magnficent film.  Benigni shows that he's a great comic actor as well as a great filmmaker.  The look of this film is sumptuous.  It almost can be seen as a blending of Fellini and Visconti, at least in its production design and cinematography.  In fact, Danilo Donati did the production design for this, and he worked exclusively with Fellini and Pasolini.  In fact, this was originally conceived as a colloboration between Fellini and Benigni, but Fellini passed away, and Roberto took it over.  Despite Miramax's boneheaded decision to dub the film, at least they released the uncut, undubbed version on DVD.  Check this one out.  It's one of the most maligned films ever, and it's a shame, because it's a masterpiece.",1189296000,,1147,4.651741293532338
1447050,5,B00005JLNB,"Odd, so many people writing that Begnini at 50 wasn't believable as a puppet who talks.  What is believable about a puppet who talks?  Boys who turn into donkeys?  People who are swallowed by sea monsters? Maybe the idea WAS to depict the idea that the self-centered, tantrum-prine child is still there at some level, even in adults - yes ... seeing people's behavior in traffic, I think it is.

I loved this movie, and more importantly, so did my 2 and 1/2 year-old son, who is able to suspend all logic.  When we watch the scene in the soon-to-be-donkey land, with Begnini swinging above the playing ""boys"", he says ""Again"".  We watch it again, and he giggles with delight, again.  He doesn't turn to me and say - you know - all those adults playing children are really miscast.",1180915200,3,780,4.5285714285714285
1447111,5,B00005JLNB,"I don't see what all of the criticism is about.  Just because a film doesn't fit into the Americanized-Hollywood mold is no reason to toss it out.  It's clear from reading these reviews that some of us have lost our ability to see life through the simplicity of a child's eyes.

I found this film delivers on it's goal: to be entertaining and enjoyable to watch.  The directing of this movie was above creative standards and it really showed in the photography and editing.  I would highly recommend the original Italian version to others without reservation.

As for the English-overdubbed version... well, it's overdubbed... what else can you say?  If you watch it, you'll receive a mixed performance because you're watching Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde play the same character.  I wouldn't even consider it.",1132185600,12,805,4.911111111111111
1447112,3,B00005JLNB,"Without regurgitating what seemingly every reviewer of this film felt HAD to be said, I will say that this is certainly the most interesting of ALL Pincchio movies/adaptations in history!

For one, and this MUST be said again, to watch a 50 year old man play the part of a little wooden puppet is a exercise in sheer open-mindedness and tolerance!

In fact, watching the entitre film (ORIGINAL VERSION ONLY PLEASE) one get's the impression that Benigni favors adults over children, even in a childrens' story, as ALL characters are played by grossly overaged/sized adult actors.

The movies is funny though...in a strange way.

The biggest drawback aside from his age, is Benigni's un-naturally high pitched voice and penchant for rambling dialogue.

As a student of the Italian language, it can be hard to follow his incessant jumble of non-sensical jibberish.

At the same token, it is Benigni's annoying acting style that makes this film fun to watch.

What makes this film even quirkier is the relationship between a very grown Pinocchio and a rather attractive Blue Haired Fairy. There were times when I thought Pinocchio would just grab his beloved fairy and use his long nose to work his own brand of magic on HER. Sounds bad I know, but if you've seen this film you'll have no choice but to agree that there is waaayyy more physical chemistry between Pinocchio and the Fairy than ANY childrens story ought to have.

I can see why the critics AND the vast majority of viewers hated this one. It really isn't a GOOD film in a traditional sense.

Where this film shines is with those of us who have an appreciation for the off-beat and downright different.

This movie is both, which is why I bought it in the first place.

Will I recommend this to all you dear morally upright, purist partents out there for your kids to watch? Certainly not!

This is a non-sexual, but yet very adult oriented movie. Especially for dumbed down Disney raised US viewers.

Is this really a 45 million dollar flop? Absolutely!

Do I enjoy this film whenever I watch it? I most certainly do.",1103587200,11,2077,4.717451523545706
1447113,5,B00005JLNB,"This is a very well crafted and entertaining movie, but of course must be watched in Italian, with the subtitles. If you like Benigni you will certainly enjoy this film--as usual he shines with comedic brilliance. The movie is absolutely hilarious in some parts, and very touching in others. Benigni's acting is great, but there are also great performances by the supporting cast members. This movie is beautifully photographed and cleverly written and it's a shame it was released in 'dubbed' form in the U.S. Dubbed movies are always bad, but the actor who did the voice for Benigni's Pinocchio was just not a good choice at all!",1081382400,28,631,4.851851851851852
1447114,2,B00005JLNB,"Roberto Benigni received extremely harsh critical attack for his recent rendition of Collidi's classic fairy tale of a puppet who wished to become a wooden boy.  Part of this is because Miramax decided to cut the film from 110 minutes to 99(!) -- often a bad mistake, as it can damage the effect of a film.  But they added another slapping blow by overdubbing the character voices.  In a foreign animated film, this works more successfully because an animation cel stands on its own.  Unfortunately, it's not so in the case of live action.  The line-readings of the voice actors clash horrendously with the moving mouth of the foreign language, and, here, in PINOCCHIO, it's just really awful.  Despite the presence of respectable big-names, their performances still misfire -- Breckin Meyer as Pinocchio himself especially coming across as shockingly lifeless.  Furthermore, their words are so poorly synchronized with the moving mouth that the results come across as disastrous.

Even in its native language, though, there are still a LOT of problems with this movie.  PINOCCHIO is definitely an ambitious picture; the costumes, set designs and cinematography are all strikingly beautiful.  There are also lots of staggering special effects shots, from a carriage drawn by mice to an enormous shark in the sea.  Such effects made the movie the most expensive in Italy --$45 million in total--; and Benigni should consider himself fortunate that it broke even in box office receipts.  In America, however, it didn't have the same reception.  Either because of the cutting and disastrous dubbing, or the fact that people could not accept this version, the movie was a dismal failure.

Part of the problem is the decision of having Benigni himself playing Pinocchio.  He never comes across as convincing as either a wooden puppet or a little boy -- it just feels like a middle-aged man mentally disabled.  Actually, in this film all the kid characters are played by adults, which furthermore exacerbates the problem.  There are plenty of interesting concepts and ideas for the film; the Blue Fairy's costumes are gorgeous, and the image of a butterfly present in the film is very nice, but that's not enough to save this poor, troubled picture.  There's hardly a sympathetic character in the movie; Pinocchio is supposed to be disobedient, yes, but here he's portrayed as a crazy maniac, refusing to behave or do anything good until he is goaded into it.  (This might have been true of Collodi's original, but if you make your main character this unsympathetic it's hard to root for him to redeem himself.)

The Talking Cricket is not much better.  If you were spoiled by Jiminy Cricket from the (far superior) Disney version, prepare to be shocked - he not only looks a man with artificial antennas placed on his head, he also acts condescendingly.  Instead of being encouraging, he comes across as a sarcastic, unhelping little jerk who just badmouths the ""boy"" instead of coaching him.  I'm aware that this is also true of the original Collodi tale (Disney ""softened up"" Pinocchio's personality for his film).  Again, it's executed so awkwardly that it becomes difficult to become involved in this film.  It also is not a very clear, focused picture:  it's too dark and menacing for youngsters and too insane to appeal to older audiences.

A modern misfire, this version of PINOCCHIO is more likely to be remembered for its cinematography rather than its misguided story and below-average dubbing.  (Even on the Italian original, there is some gratingly bad acting.)

Surprisingly, even though Miramax butchered this film in its theatrical release, they certainly produced a great package with this DVD.  It's a two-disc set, complete with a very gorgeous transfer, and two different versions of the movie.  One disc is the horribly recut U.S. release while the other is the uncut Italian version.  Strangely, even an English language track is offered on the second disc as well, and it includes all the stuff that was cut from the U.S. premiere!  Sadly, though, even the presence of the uncut version doesn't change the fact that this movie is a disappointing experience.  Both Walt Disney's timeless animated version and to a lesser extent, the Jonathan Taylor Thomas execution are far better alternatives than this one.",1067040000,14,4324,5.035161744022504
1447115,3,B00005JLNB,"This movie's notoriety as the ""worst film of 2002"" peaked my curiosity. I was actually disappointed to hear how bad it was because I grew up loving the original Italian Collodi story of the live wooden puppet. Having seen the SUBTITLED version of the DVD, I must say the film is not nearly as horrific as some critics would have people believe. While I agree that it is very hard to buy Roberto Benigni in the title role as a young boy/puppet, much of the film is presented as 'theater' and thus asks the audience to suspend belief. The characters of the Fox and Cat, and many others rely not on actual animal makeup but features which create an illusion of their characteristics. In this sense, the film is quite ingenius and imaginative. The sets and costumes are beautiful and the script and story line are very faithful to the original book. That said, this film is a hard one to market to any audience because it is an adult (or 'art')version of a children's story, produced in another language. Sadly, in spite of its strengths, the film was doomed to fail in America because most children know only the animated Disney version of the story, and most parents do not wish to see a 50-year old playing the lead in a children's fairy tale. A shame, because while far from perfect, the film is not the disaster that many have proclaimed it to be.",1066262400,8,1348,4.506122448979592
1447116,5,B00005JLNB,"My wife and I were travelling in Italy last year when this latest version of Pinocchio came into the theatres.
The country went insane over it! They had a poll of school children on who they liked more:
Pinocchio or Roberto Benigni?
 It was close, but Roberto came out on top.
 If you watch this movie, you'll understand why.
 Roberto Benigni is an adult who hasn't forgot what it is like to be a kid. He is constantly smiling, playing and has boundless amounts of infectous energy. The role of Pinocchio is perfect for him.
 We saw the movie, and even though we understood a little more than half of the dialogue, we were caught up in the story and completely understood what was going on on screen. We bought into it fully.
 When we came back to the states, we saw that the movie was coming out again in the theatres! And then we saw the trailers... This wasn't the movie that we saw.
What's with the crappy overdub!? The voices were completely wrong!
The characters went from being three-dimensional beings with substance and depth to nothing more than a parody of their original selves.
That's why it bombed over here. The whole meaning was lost in translation.
 The movie is absolutely gorgeous! The costumes and sets are elaborate and stunning. It's like they were pulled directly from a popup storybook land of princes,princesses, giants and fairies.
 Take some time to rent or buy this one on DVD.
 Watch it in Italian, and get pulled along into a faraway fantasy land.",1064793600,36,1477,4.6106870229007635
1447117,4,B00005JLNB,"Ok, I was expecting this film to be bad based on all the bad (press) reviews but it actually isn't bad at all. As a Benigni fan I had to buy it and it's very much worth seeing, and I'm sure many other adult Benigni fans will agree. Much beautiful scenery and I laughed aloud through many scenes, such as the lollipop scene and a scene with Pinocchio along with the puppets and Fireeater... Benigni's facial expressions make it all worthwhile. Ok, so Benigni seems a little ""out of place"" playing a young boy, but it's fun and different. One thing though, best seen in the Italian with English subtitle version... Haven't even bothered to watch the English dubbed version. In my opinion, dubbed movies lose much and aren't worth watching.
*Note* This movie is not based on the Disney version so things can be unexpected unless youve read other versions.

Despite celebrity voices (Glenn Close, John Cleese, Cheech Marin, others), Benigni's film was doomed from the start. Also, Benigni's 'Pinocchio' was nothing like the Disney animated classic. Benigni's version is closer to the actual book, which can get very dark. When Pinocchio was hanging by the neck from a tree branch in this film, this came as quite a shock to family audiences. While Disney's classic remains the best version, it is only loosely based on the book (as most of Disney's animated story-telling is). Benigni's imaginative tale cost $45 million (the most expensive Italian film ever made). The money went into the marvelous sets, the costume designs, and the creation of the giant whale. The supporting cast is good. The main theme is never lost. Benigni does a good job at handling the complicated series of Pinocchio's adventures. In Benigni's film, characters are key. The Blue Fairy, the Cricket. You like these characters. Benigni's script has something to say, no matter how subtle. It is clear a lot went into the planning of this film. But the major drawback in the film was the casting of Roberto Benigni as Pinocchio. He simply looks too old for the role. Another problem is Benigni's tendency to get rather long-winded. Without coming up for air, his dialogue can get tedious. I found myself exhausted watching him, and hoping the Blue Fairy would slap some sense into him. This 'style' of performance exhausts the audience, and steals away some of the magic. Furthermore, Pinocchio should have resembled a puppet more. Benigni wears a clown-like costume and a pointed hat. This is OK, but considering the money thrown into this fairy tale, maybe a little more should have been paid to make him look less human. Still, Benigni's 'Pinocchio' is not the failure that critics will have you believe. I give Benigni high marks for imagination. The film may drag at times, but Benigni doesn't try to be too showy, and the film is superior to today's mindless summer fare. But be warned: Stay away from the dubbed version. Stick to the original Italian. Be sure to keep an open mind and you won't be disappointed.",1058140800,12,2222,4.912234042553192
1447119,1,B00005JLNB,"Forget the technical problems, the bad dubbing, the muddy sound, the cheesy sets; these things are mere trifles in this monumentally bad movie. It takes a special kind of hubris to think that a fifty year-old man can successfully portray a pre-adolescent boy/puppet and Roberto Benigni (no surprise) fails. His acting isn't so much energetic as it is schizophrenic, water bug skitterings followed by shallow musings. Benigni's Pinocchio is a bounding, incongruous, humorless, vapid stick clad in a ridiculous costume.
In the middle of this G-rated movie Pinocchio is floridly hanged by two robbers. The Blue Fairy (Nicoletta Braschi, as teeth-achingly beautiful as ever) brings him back to life-this is, after all, a fairy tale-but this scene is waaaaaaay too graphic for young children, as is the scene where Pinocchio gets swallowed by the leviathan.
This movie ain't good, ain't funny, and ain't worth watching.",1058140800,6,914,5.310344827586207
1447120,4,B00005JLNB,"I had my worries before I saw this film, as I do before I see any adaptation of a favorite piece of literature, but I can happily say that I was not the least bit disappointed in this beautiful film. Visually stunning from get-go, the film never seems to let up on its attraction to the eye. But even more to its credit, the film is extraordinary in its fidelity to the spirit of the Collodi original, which made it such a treat. I was afraid that most American moviegoers and critics, used to the Disney version, might find the differances in the story-line and characters unsettling enough to leave a bad taste in their mouths, and, while this was not entirely the case, its poor critical reception seems to be partially due to this. Not that I'm not knocking the Disney film, it is a masterpiece in its own right with some of the most magnificent animation ever produced for the silver screen, but its highly Americanized and slightly emasculated interpretation of the original book has always left me preferring the original.
But some warning, this is not a movie for children. Most children who have seen the Disney film and then gone on to read the book have been disappointed, due to the episodic and didactic nature of Collodi's tale, and I think most (American) children will probably not enjoy this new version for those reasons. Also, the casting is less-than-ideal, and I think this is another reason for its strong critical failure in this country (and the reason I've given it four stars rather than five). Benigni is obviously too old for the part (although I'd rather see him than some annoying, precocious child actor)and his wife is unsuitable for the Fairy with the Blue Hair (far too glamerous, I think). Also the English sountrack is incredably annoying, I am greatly looking forward to viewing the film in its original Italian. But on the whole, to those who fancy fairy tales, and especially those who are familiar with the original story, it is highly recommended.",1057536000,10,1988,4.7155172413793105

The cinematography and special effects are nicely done.  Roberto Benigni and his Wife do a great job of acting.  The special features are interesting and provide insights into how the film was made.  It's nice to have both the Italian and English dubbed version in this purchase.  A great children's fable, but out of style today as ""telling the truth"" in our society seems to be unfortunately ""optional"" or in some cases ""discouraged.""",1391817600,,591,4.989795918367347

7939216,2,B00005JLNB,"I saw this movie originally in  the theater 12/27/2002.  The review I read for it said was absolutely horrible.  Needless to say I went to see it for myself.  OH MY GOD!!  This made ""Plan 9 from Outerspace"" look like ""Casablanca"" by comparisons.  I knew I was in trouble when the kids behind me saw the lynching scene of this movie and said ""I don't want to watch this anymore!""

Ok first of all the movie was originally made in Italy which is also the novel's country of origin too.  Roberto Benigin played Pinocchio. He was obviously too old for the part.  This character whined, griped, and shouted at top volume.  Ghepeto wore a bad toupee wich looked like a ""fried egg""(I did not see a resemblence of an egg of any sort but anyway).  These two were so poor they didn't have a pot to piss in, yet Ghepeto makes a ""hat out of bread"" for Pinoc to wear.  There was the blue fairy(played by Benigni's wife).  Her hair was  purple and teeth yellow(she looked more like Shampoo from ""Ranma 1/2"").  There was an annoying cricket(a bald guy with antenae), a fox and cat that duped pinoc out of his money(they look like casting rejects from ""The Island of Doctor Manroe"" 1990s edition), a dog man coach driver named Miderueax who is needs glasses and a best friend named ""Leonardo""  who looked more Irish than Italian.  Since this is a  foregin film, it was dubbed in English with talents of Cheech Marin, Regis Philman, Queen Latifah,  and John Cleese.  What a ragtag group of actors.

This movie was slow paced, had little coherent plot, a very repeatitive soundtrack and  at times just plain unrealistic.  If you want a cheesey foregin film this is perfect.  Just be sure you lock up the sharp objects before watching you may find yourself gouging out your own eyes.",1370476800,,1764,4.526984126984127

7939219,2,B00005JLNB,"I love bad movies, especially bad horror movies and sci fi movies, shlock movies too. They are all lowly rated unless you give them their own rating system. This one needs that for sure. But this has to be seen to be believed. It's a kids movie from a talented actor who made alot of good movies. Life is beautiful'  is a fantastic movie and won a oscar. This one almost destroyed the man's career. I truly believe that this could be used for torturing people. you'd make them watch the version with english overdubbing. It's so bizaare and yet the intentions were very good here. The man tried to make a movie for the family and it is that. But it's about a small wooden puppet after all and not a grown man playing a small wooden puppet.  I seriously could not function while I was watching this and that's coming from someone who can watch 'robot monster' and still some charm in it. That is a all time  low budget shlocker by the way. This was a big budget flick though, after his big hit flick the studios overthere did what they often do and didn't think out what this was going to be. And a legendary bomb was born. At least it didn't lose as much money as 'istar' or 'pluto nash"" (that one cost 100 million to make and made less than a million I believe at the box office. A bomb has to be a big budger affair though because a low budget movie is lucky if anyone goes to see it. I have to check to see if Roberto Benigni made any movies after this , I hope so because he is talented. but this movie is like a experiment in badness as the actor tries to play a kid wooden puppet. It's really hard to describe. And I doubt few who ever saw this weren't amazed at it's overall badness?
