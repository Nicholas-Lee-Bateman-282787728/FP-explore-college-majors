5140735,5,B0088FS1DW,"I'am a big fan of Anime and I like certain storylines, mystery,suspense,and supernatural elements. There is so much out there when it comes to Anime but I usually end up picking some good and interesting stories. I have just started watching this Anime collection and so far so good, so if your interest lies in the unknown, supernatural and suspense this might interest you. I would recommend this video.  J.

8526125,3,B0088FS1DW,"The animation is Ok, the story is good but not great, it's 2 brothers that were given up to a research lab because they have psychic powers. It does have some dark episodes. So far a pretty good for a hardcore otaku",1524873600,,215,4.142857142857143
8526126,5,B0088FS1DW,Product looks brand new as promised! I can't wait to watch this series over again. I loved the sibling relationship between Naoto & Naoya!,1523404800,,138,4.791666666666667
8526127,2,B0088FS1DW,"Two brothers with special powers break out of the special government institution they've been in for half of their childhood due to their parents giving them up due to their powers. Naoya and Naoto Kirihara work to try help people with their powers now, unfortunately mostly they run into a unpleasant jerks mostly constantly and evil psychic guys and organizations also. Get use to Naoya screaming his head off every time he reads someone's mind or sees the inside of their mind. He also says ""Brother"" every .5 seconds, and acts like he kind of is still a little kid despite having aged into his 20s. Naoto can move objects with his mind and other assorted Carrie powers, he is afraid though of how far he'll get out of hand in situations with the power.

Most of the show is really a lot of murky psychic battles and really the show goes out of it's way to make humanity look like garbage. Seriously, the first people they come across in the show is a bar full of unpleasant people including an abusive skeptic jerk who HATES psychics because his mother abused him as a kid. And also we cross paths with a serial killer woman who's boyfriend accompanies her as she murders random women on the roads of Japan.
Or the time they investigate suicides at a high school and reveals that it's really the fault of a psychic little kid who seeks revenge against a group of teenagers for hit and running his dog at one point earlier! Seriously the more we go through this dank show the more it seems people really suck on this show. They try to make humanity look worth saving but geez, how many jerks can you fit into a show! Psychics or otherwise. The only two characters I guess I feel for is the mains. There's also some weird psychic teenage girl that has transcended the bounds of reality somehow and really doesn't do much besides step in once in a situation. Enjoy the depression this show will give you in between the dank bad animation that isn't very good or the fact our characters keep bumping into nasty human beings. Most of the dark content is hinted at but still, geez, even be careful for the next door neighbor also, he's probably psycho and a child abuser, that's something I've learned from this dark show. I would rather watch Locke the Superman!
Apparently this was based on a live action show that was produced before in the early 90s and also a CD Rom game was made of it as well, this was only in Japan by the way. Media Blasters opted to not do an English dub for this, I wonder why? So you are stuck with an English subbed Japanese version.",1508976000,,2561,4.437367303609342

8526134,3,B0088FS1DW,"Not sure if it was just a problem with the one I received or with all of them, but the sound of noticeably out of sync which was more than a little bit annoying (checked on multiple devices, and does the same for all of them). Hearing things happen before the picture showed them happening for the first dvd, and then seeing things before hearing them for the second made for a slightly jarring viewing experience.

Good show though, and for the price it's not that big of a deal that it doesn't work perfectly.",1421107200,,511,4.378947368421053
