There are some moments that got me laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes, some scenes beggged for really rude commentary, and overall a fine example of a group of friends who actually made a movie!  A former co-worker is a star in this film, he indicated that they had an awful lot of fun making this and from time to time it shows.",1360886400,,437,4.178571428571429
8269025,1,B0018B0E1A,"If I could give it less than one star it would still not be few enough to rate this movie. I would rather watch Barney all day long then have an all day marathon of the wiggles than watch this $12 piece of crap again. I wouldn't even make somebody I absolutely hate watch this movie.

Enough ranting here is why I hate it so much.

The plot:
A cheating husband gets a bottle of experimental fluid flung into his face. Then body parts start to fall off and come to life. Then he uses his body parts to get back at his girlfriend who did this to him.
 Now as awesome as this sounds (The reason we bought it) it is the worst execution I have ever seen in all the hundreds of awful movies I have watched, and I am one of those people that goes out and buys those hundred movie collections.

 Everything about this movie reeked. I wish I could get a hold of all copies of this movie and use them as clay pidgeons.",1316563200,2,908,4.050279329608938

I really can't compare this story to any other flick out there, at least not right now.  This film does have its gross-out moments, the same kind seen in movies such as: 'Street Trash', Slime City, or 'The Boneyard'.  It's basically about a man who ticks off his wife by having an affair!  His wife gets revenge by injecting him with an experimental drug, and from there, nasty things start to happen to his body!!!  The story reminds me of something David Cronenberg would come up with haha.  Good cheesy-sleazy stuff here!  Check it out!",1259020800,2,694,4.496
