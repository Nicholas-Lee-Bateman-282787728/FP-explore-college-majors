It may not affect everyone the same way but for me, the story line kept me interested & pulled me along, making me want to keep seeing what was coming next. There was no boredom for me. I loved the characters, & i loved the setting. I would recommend it to anyone liking these types of format.  rlw",1440288000,,363,3.9726027397260273
