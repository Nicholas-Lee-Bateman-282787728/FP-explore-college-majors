7950446,1,B00005QFF0,"My DVD library consists of hundreds of items, many, many of which feature large and small orchestras, individual singers, and chorus groups.  I have never encountered, however, a orchestral/choral production as poorly recorded as this.  My audio playback system is relatively expensive, with very good speakers, but I could do nothing when attempting to obtain anywhere near a satisfactory playback sound.  Video qualities are satisfactory.

Being able to look at these performers is secondary; in this type release, sound must be paramount.  Potential buyers are hereby warned.",1167696000,,578,5.597701149425287
7950447,5,B00005QFF0,"This VHS video and stereo sound are high quality. Church and Domingo are just terrific. Bennett is off a little, but still gives an excellent performance. You will be able to watch and listen to the video again and again. There are over 20 great holiday songs performed live. So much great music is offered including a children's choir. Vanessa Williams does a solid job.",1129420800,5,371,4.723076923076923
7950448,3,B00005QFF0,"I agree with some of the earlier posters.  Domingo and Charlotte are excellent.  Bennett needs to retire and Williams is mediocre, at best.

I heard this special just last month and was very impressed when I heard Charlotte.  Bennett and Williams, however, did not impress me much.  When Bennett would sing, I would feel sorry for him.  The voice just wasn't making it.  Williams to me seemed to believe she was better than she is...and, perphaps my imagination, but seemed to not like it much when Charlotte was on stage with all of them...at least at the end of the special.

I will buy this DVD purely for Charlotte and Domingo's performances.  3 stars because Bennett and Williams decrease it by 2.",1106438400,4,702,4.688524590163935
7950449,5,B00005QFF0,I just watched this DVD and can't begin to understand why such poor reviews.  Let me preface this by saying that I know nothing about the nuances of music or sound quality.  I'm an average Joe would would normally choose watching football over a Christmas concert.  I found this presentation to be very enjoyable.  Having four talented people from very different backgrounds performing together was an absolute treat.  Don't buy into the 1 star reviews by snobby Opera geeks.  I believe that most people will find it to be very well done moving.,1072310400,11,545,4.806451612903226
7950450,1,B00005QFF0,"Each individual element of this event had potential of providing a warm and memorable Christmas evening, but together they are lost in a blinding snowstorm. As much as I love Christmas, its music and all things wonderful about it... this video does not deliver!",1028160000,8,261,4.954545454545454
7950451,1,B00005QFF0,"Any time you bring together artists for Christmas songs, the one ingredient you look for is warmth.  This is the commonality of all Christmas songs which we look for when listening to such fare.  Fortunately, 3 of the performers here, Tonny Bennett, Placido Domingo and Vanessa Williams provide us with this holiday necessity in a variety of favorites.  The 4th, Charlotte Church, however, simply belts out some traditional songs with about as much warmth as a snowball.  When I hear songs by an individual, I expect more than just a choir-girl rendition.  If Miss Church is unable to meet this expectation, she should stay home, enjoy her Christmas and listen to those that do.",1012694400,,678,4.912280701754386
7950452,1,B00005QFF0,"What a travesty, the great Domingo soldiers on with a group of motley artists (Charlotte excepted). I mean, Tony Bennett should retire and enjoy his millions, he is REALLY past it! It was painful to watch him and Placido mangle beautiful Christmas music and it would have offended the ears of The Creator.
Charlotte however, is showing more maturity in her singing.
The other female pop star lacked diction, and was clearly out of her depth.
These annual Christmas in Vienna shows have been really tacky over the last few years.......check out 'Christmas Glory at Westminster Abbey', the BBC will show how it is supposed to be done.",1011312000,9,632,4.861111111111111
