Of course... then you find out it's been cut ^_-
Still, it's not that big of a deal. If you're into hentai and your looking for another video to add to your collection, save yourself some money and buy all three videos together.
Chances are if you're a hentai fan you aren't missing out on something you've never seen before. It's pretty straight-forward, regular hentai.
The animation is of very nice quality, and the humurous spin that they put on it makes it enjoyable to watch. The girls are cute (as always) and the storyline is a little cut and dry, but you have to expect that from it's genre.
Overall, it doesn't add anything new to anime or the area of hentai in general, but it's interesting and fairly humorus, so you might as well give it a try!",986601600,,901,4.369047619047619

7879180,3,630479858X,"This is a fantasy tale of four adventurers, A Hero and Sword Dancer named Santa, a Barbarian named Bobo, a sorceress named Pierce, and a cat-slave named Pink. This is a weird combination, and it makes for a weird trilogy  of movies. Overall, the fights were decent, though at times not realistic,  and spells looked impressive in standard japanese tradition. It's not a  kid's movie, due to lots of nudity and sexual situations. At times, this  seems there to try making up for a loose plot. If these things don't matter  to you when you watch an anime tape, or you want to see a spoof on most  ""traditional"" adventure anime's, be sure to at least see this  once. Have fun, and say ""Hi!"" to Pink for me",928281600,7,702,4.4375
