8334658,5,B000GFOPAU,"Excellent program.

I personally witnessed the event from mainland Mexico and the imagery, audio, and narrative of this production help to recall the majesty of that experience.

As previous reviewer mentioned- absolutely worthy of a more archival, and higher resolution format.",1375488000,,278,5.7560975609756095
8334659,5,B000GFOPAU,"Perhaps the best total solar eclipse documentary, both from scientific and sociological perspectives. This is the ""Woodstock"" of eclipse films, brilliantly covering the phenomena of eclipse chasing and tourism that grew significantly since the widely observed 1991 event which became known as the ""Great Eclipse."" It really deserves a remastered DVD release.",1197590400,,358,5.903846153846154
