2054589,5,B0002234R2,"The tears! The drama! The excitement! How can you possibly resist all those emotions in motion during the third season of ""Dawson's Creek"".
Not to mention the beginning of the most beautiful relationship ever displayed on TV: Pacey, Joey and their TRUE LOVE!
The thrid season is my favorite of all the six DC seasons, for I got together with my girlfriend while we were watching #317 Cinderella Story (the one with the Pacey/Joey kiss happens to be my benchmark for my own relationship) and because I just think there are some episodes no man (or woman) can possibly resist.
Except for the whole Eve thing... but nobody's perfect, right?
All in all a great experience, and all ye singles out there, buy the third season, get your girl/boy of interest in front of your TV and go for it! :)",1082592000,3,788,4.595744680851064
2054590,5,B0002234R2,"No doubt, the begining of Joey and Pacey's love, so sweet and full of emotion till the end. It will make you thrill, cry, laugh... It's the season we all were waiting for since we've watched in tv. I can't wait to have it. If you're not in love with DC yet, watch this amazing season and you will.",1082592000,3,297,4.0508474576271185
2054591,5,B0002234R2,"Season Three of Dawson's Creek for some was the beginning of the end for some, but for me it was the start of what ended up being on of the most complex plot twists ever in a television show. It starts off with the heart broke Dawson on the bus coming back to the creek from spending the summer in Philadelphia with his mom, Gail. On the bus he meets the mysterious Eve, who ends up taking Dawson on a Roller Coaster ride through the first 10 episodes. Meanwhile Joey is ready to get back together with Dawson, after she was furious with him over convincing her to turn her father in. Dawson is not ready for it, and in response to Joey thrusting herself on him, turns her down. He sends Pacey to look after her because he is not ready to be close to her yet. Then throughout the rest of the season, we get an interesting plot twist, Pacey falls for Joey. We saw a brief hint of this possible twist in Season 1 in the episode ""Double Date"", but it wasn't until the episode ""Green with Love"" that we see the fact that Pacey is in love with Joey. It isn't until a few episodes later that we see that Joey is in love with Pacey as well. Meanwhile Jen and Jack both go from being outcasts to Jen being head Cheerleader, and falling in love with the quarterback, Henry, and Jack becoming the star wide reciever. This season has alot of ups and downs and twists and turns,  but in the end Exec. Prod Paul Stupin delivers a knock out punch making you want to come back for season 4.",1082505600,6,1475,4.175438596491228

It commences the relationship of Joey and Pacey, goes deeper into Jack's homosexuality, Jack and Jen's friendship, and Gale and Mitch's relationship. Trust me.

2054597,5,B0002234R2,"My favorite season.  After ""Double Date"" in season one I knew it was just a matter of time before Pacey and Joey were going to get together. I loved following them from friendship to the realization that they were in love.  Great chemistry between these two and it was only fitting that they end up together at the end of season six.  Never watched this show until it was in syndication but as unrealistic as it was at times it took me back to the anguish and innocence of those teenage years.  Love to play this season every once and a while if for no other reason than to watch the duo of Jackson and Holmes  Favorite episodes include Four to Tango, A Week-end in the Country, Anti Prom, The Longest Day, True Love and Valentines' Day Massacre.",1461024000,,746,4.3768115942028984

2054616,3,B0002234R2,"I am going to copy and paste this in every season of Dawson's Creek. Understand I am a fan of 90210 the originals series, Vampire Diaries, The Originals, NCIS, The 100, Utopia, Bones, Continuum just to name a few. I ordered all 6 seasons of Dawson's Creek and began watching them. I understand this is an old T.V. series and I am playing catch up, but there is a reason I have never heard of this show. Pros I enjoy watching shows with the ins and outs of growing up and all the pain it brings, this show does that to a certain extent. The show also brings into light some of the pains homosexual kids face when growing up. Now for the Cons. At best this show was nothing more than a copy cat of 90210 as a matter of fact 90210 was actually mentioned in the show. You will also notice that you can skip a season or two and never truly miss anything.  You know when you sit down and start watching a bad movie but you force yourself through it hoping that it gets good soon ""I found myself in this very situation on more then one occasion"". The love triangle between the three main characters killed the series for me, much like the first couple of seasons of the Vampire Diaries. However, the Vampire Diaries had a story behind each show outside of the love triangle that somewhat held it together. The story line always came second to the love triangle in Dawson's Creek and for the most part the story lines were garbage. Some more bad news for the show; you would be hard pressed to find one 15 year old in high school with a vocabulary of a 30 year old English professor, but not in this show they all do. If it weren't for the last season 2 stars at best.  I recommend this series only if you have time to waste.",1425081600,,1717,4.2

2054626,5,B0002234R2,Great Show! I grew up (through high school and beyond) watching Dawson's Creek and I have to say it is one of my favorite Teenage Dramas. I love the drama that goes with falling for your best friend and seeing that play out over years. Add in a spunky character like Pacey and you have a hit on your hands. Great Show!,1413244800,,318,4.145161290322581
2054627,4,B0002234R2,"Just finished watching the Capeside Supplement on Disk One of this set. The interface was so slow on my system I thought frequently it had frozen. It proves not so much to be a tour of Capeside as an extended backgrounder to the show and the events in the characters lives associated with these places. In 1999 a show had 23 episodes per season, imagine that. The producers placed  6 episodes on each disk save the first. Joey Potters Harvard love interest is played by Robin Dunne who also played Franz in the series Little Men. The resonance with Little Woman and Joeys Mothers decision to name her daughter after Josephine March in that book is uncanny especially since he went directly from one show to the next.

These teens played by twenty-somethings are preternaturally self-aware and scarily articulate rarely lacking for a comeback line in any circumstance. Their self-possession is belied by the throbbing teenage angst and raging hormones they act out. At 27 Kerr Smith was the oldest of the lot. Recent pictures show him to be prematurely gray. His football stunts were played by a double named Michael Dean. The opening episodes of this season with the amoral hedonistic Eve place Dawson in rather embarrassing situations but things settle down after she departs. The themes are rarely mean spirited and despite their differences this ensemble cast cares for each other.",1409702400,,1384,4.935622317596566

I'M 40+ AND THOUGHT THE SHOW WOULD BE WORTH WATCHING (LIKE GILMORE GIRLS AND FELICITY) IN MY ""OLD"" AGE, BUT THE CHARACTERS WERE NOT VERY LIKEABLE. ALSO, I COULDN'T GET PAST KATIE HOLMES' HORRIBLE (READ SQUINTY) ACTING. WHY SHE WAS THE STAR OF THAT SHOW IS BEYOND ME. AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON PACEY!!",1406160000,,554,4.12962962962963

Season three blew me away right from the get go, the sexuality of the show is ramping way, way up.. The teens of capeside are coming into there own and the maturity level is raising each episode. I will edit and and add to this review when season three is complete but thus far its deffinately not dissapointing. This show just isn't for the pre-teens, im in my 30's now and enjoying it 15-years after its debut.  I was somewhat skeptical of season one and season two got better. i can say im truly enjoying season 3

Now after finishing the entire series i reflect back i think season 3 was by far the best.. well, season two and season three were the best.. and the two hour finale at the end of season 6 was just awesome. Im 36 years old and this show was (IT) durring my college years.. everyone was watching it (yes even us guys were following along) well after i graduated the show continued and i was not able to follow along.. so all these years down the road i ordered up this series and rewatched it..  times sure have changed.. i wish they would have had the original music, and i wish sesons 5&6 were better.. after rewatching all the episodes im looking forward to saving these DVD'S and letting my kids watch them as teens and getting there opinions.  rewatching this took me back to before kids, marriage, house payments, etc.etc.etc.  back to when the whole world was infront of me.. i was glad to revisit this time..

I've always felt that, as far as witty banter and pop-culture references go, Dawson's Creek failed where Gilmore Girls succeeded.  However, one weekday afternoon I found myself watching the episode Cinderella Story out of sheer boredom, and was blind-sided by the ending.  From then on, I was hooked by Joshua Jackson and Katie Holmes' infectious chemistry.  I decided to buy the Season 3 set because I wanted to watch this relationship develop from the beginning.
My only complaint about this set is that the first two dvds skip maddeningly, and many episodes are completely unwatchable.  Because of this, I gave this set three stars instead of four, for disappointing product quality.  Hopefully, the set I received was just a lemon.",1232236800,,891,5.020408163265306

The first handful of episodes of this season are boring and completely strange with the introduction of the character Eve. After that the show starts to pick up speed with the whole Pacey/Joey/Dawson love triangle. I never liked Joey and Pacey as a couple but some of the romantic scenes that they have together are pretty explosive. Buy this if you were a fan of the series.

Throughout the first two seasons I was totally rooting for Joey and Dawson and was torn up with the way that they broke up in the end of season 2. But I was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved watching Pacey fall in love with Joey and then how much chemistry they had together. I think this season also made Joey a more likeable character, because I think she was very easy to hate in the second season. Once I started watching the second half of season 3, I couldn't stop.

2054674,3,B0002234R2,"This is by far the best season of Dawson's Creek, still the best, in my opinion, of all the 1990s teen shows.  This is the one that reveals the love triangle which would be central to the series from this point forward and the emergence of Joshua Jackson, who is by far the most engaging character in this series.

However, why, why, why did they change the music for this DVD?  Many of the episodes (including the fantastic LONGEST DAY) suffer greatly as a result.  It's so disappointing, as it takes away from the greatness of these episodes.

Still, if you haven't seen Dawson's Creek, you must watch through season 3.  It's the best.",1213920000,,637,4.543859649122807
2054675,5,B0002234R2,"Season 3 is the turning point for friends Dawson, Joey, and Pacey. Up until now, the show has been about Dawson and Joey's dysfunctional friendship/psuedo-romance.

However, 4 important events guide this season to probably the most emotionally exhilarating season finale of the series: 1) a mysterious, sexy stranger named Eve turns up in Capeside and takes an interest in Dawson and Andie, 2)After apologizing for breaking up with him and holding his part in her father's reincarcination against him, Joey asks Dawson to take her back and offers to sleep with him. He rejects her and says they should just be friends. She is angry and hurt, 3)Dawson then asks Pacey to look after Joey for awhile to make sure she's okay. Pacey is hesitant to get involved in the situation, but agrees. 4) Pacey's girlfriend returns from a summer spent in a mental health facility and reveals she cheated on him. He is heartbroken and ends the relationship.

After these events occur, we are treated to the wonderfully slow build up of the friendship, then romance between Pacey and Joey, which threatens their friendship with Dawson. One of the mosted heatedly debated triangles in television history thus begins and it drives the last three seasons of this teen soap. Many of the reviews on here are pretty much a testament to the division of most of Dawson's Creek fans into DJers (Dawson and Joey) and PJers (Pacey and Joey), so take what you will from the reviews. The same is true for S4-S6 reviews.

So, I'm a Pjer and this is my favorite season not only for that reason, but because I think it showcases the casts' talent and has the best build-up to season finale of all the seasons. It's just very compelling.

The Season 3 set has a fun Capeside Tour extra, it's 23 episodes on 4 discs, but unless you're a picture quality junkie, the picture quality is just fine and is the best on this season's DVDs compared to other seasons. Also, some of the bad reviews are also in relation to music that has been replaced due to cost. It's too bad, but I didn't follow the show closely when it aired, so it doesn't bother me at all.

It's probably not appropriate for younger kids and quite dramatically unrealistic, the dialog is unbelievable and the characters are somewhat annoying.

Here's the kicker.  Like so many TV-on-DVD experiences, this DVD series replaces most, if not all, of the music including the very recognizable opening theme song.  The claim is that the theme song is from the International version of Dawson's Creek.  I'm thinking it's from a waitress at an International House of Pancakes.  The song, though appropriate for the show, features a woman who's voice makes the hair stand up on your neck.  Luckily it is chaptered properly so the minute you hear her start up you can hit forward and skip it!

One of the reasons I wanted to watch the show was the feeling of being taken back to my younger years, and part of that experience involves the music of the day.  ...Experience Robbed!

But it gets worse: It is clear that they did not have complete copies of the show sans the music because a few scenes are obviously earlier takes.  In one situation, a character actually says ""Be that at is may"".  In another there appears to be a large hair on the screen for a few moments.  In several cases the sound of walking or of a busy school are eerily missing.",1167955200,2,1440,4.6

I grew up with this show and I was deeply affected by how they would pick out songs with lyrics that matched the scene that was happening.  The music was a strong focus of mine for this show and to change over most of the catalog was entirely disappointing.  I have also read that they do not intend on ever releasing a collection with all the original music due to legal reasons.  So I have no intention of owning this collection again, which is a shame, since I adored this show.  You can still catch re-runs on TV, though, and I would recommend, if sampling this show, to catch the high school episodes as opposed to the college episodes.  The writing is better in the high school episodes and the characters are more enjoyable, especially Pacey, (my favorite).

If you put as much stock in the music of this show as I have, I would not suggest purchasing these DVD sets.",1151539200,3,930,4.4035087719298245

My absolute all time favourite episode is ""Stolen Kisses"" (everytime I hear Daydream Believer I just get goosebumps!), and I just loved the karoke scene and the very end of the episode where she grabs Pacey's hand, you just cant get much better than that!  The ""Anti-Prom"" moment where Pacey and Joey are dancing gets me everytime, and so does the big smile Joey gives at the end of ""True Love"" when she is kissing Pacey...its almost as if a bit of Katie Holmes appears and is showing her happiness in the outcome.

Josh and Katie are my favourite actors and everytime they are in a scene together they take my breath away.  The chemistry they share is amazing, especially knowing the fact they used to be together in real life, it makes it even more exciting!

Pacey no longer after that loves her because he would have never slept with another girl because he loved her.

Dawsons falls for a girl named eve the energetic girl who lies about her identity to dawson.the reason how joey and pacey became close at 1st was because dawson rejected joeys kiss and hooking up.

It was great to watch the characters of Joey and Pacey fall in love with each other, after being friends for most of their young lives, and they had no idea what was forming between them.  This is when it became clear that Dawson was her past and her future is with someone else.  I was really disappointed in how the character of Andie was portrayed this season.

2054688,5,B0002234R2,"What an up and down season this third installment is.  Right from the start, it initiates one of the worst story threads in the entire series, that of the mysterious film noir fatale, Eve, and yet at the same time initiates one of the best, the tarnished romance between Joey and Pacey.  This dichotomy between great moment and bad moment (often simultaneously) is really the essence of Season Three.  For every great episode, there is one that is comparatively awful.  The Capeside tide doesn't get as bumpy in any other season as it does in the mangled third season.

The biggest problem of the season is that Dawson is just given nothing to do.  Given that he is the titular character, he should still remain a focus, even despite the major love blossoming of Pacey and Joey.  But yet he is thrown off on terrible side-quests, like hunting for Eve and engaging in a forced friendship with Principal Green's daughter (that goes absolutely nowhere).  Perhaps in dealing with all the tepid things Dawson must sludge through in Season Three, Van Der Beek's characterization is much more obnoxious and annoying than any other season.  Season Three is the only one where Dawson becomes almost completely unbearable.

By contrast, Pacey really becomes the star, and Joshua Jackson makes great strides with Pacey, who was typically underwritten in the first two seasons.  Although the series really plays up the underdog angle with Pacey a little too obviously throughout, it is still pleasant to watch Rocky get his Adrienne during the season finale.  So in the theme of intercutting the good and bad throughout Season Three, Pacey becomes a highlight, while Dawson becomes an annoying priss.

Joey is the character that would grow the most throughout the series, starting as a cynical little tomboy and blossoming into a soft and delicate young lady, and in Season Three she really turns on the love.  You have to wade through all the suffering she endures throughout the season, but in the end the payoff is more than worth the trip.  Jen and Jack are led through some pretty shallow plots, particularly Jen's romance with Henry, but they both have their moments.  Andie is such a cutie throughout, she picks the season up whenever it starts to descend into melodrama.  To think that she'd be taking ecstasy and acting the buffoon the next season is a shame.

The biggest problem with Season Three is likely due to the departure of series brainchild, Kevin Williamson.  Without him to puppet the story arcs, things went unraveled for most of the series, and it wasn't until the final few episodes where the series really started to piece things back together.  It almost becomes tedious mid-season, since Joey and Pacey getting together is made obvious at the finale of the first episode, yet the producers milk the tension throughout the series.  The wait seems especially long when trying to endure the plodding sub-plots peppered throughout.  But at the end Pacey and Joey strike emotional gold, and that is all that the fans really end up taking from Season Three anyway.  When the rollercoaster ends, you always come out remembering the soaring highs, and in Season Three there are plenty.  The track is just a little bumpier in Season Three than in most of the other seasons.  But when you are dealing with a series as good as ""Dawson's Creek"", those lows are still better than most series' highs.  Through and through, a fantastic series.",1112400000,5,3443,4.862778730703259

#1) Dawson is on a bus coming from somewhere we don't know in episode 1, it is explained , then this Eve girl comes out of nowhere and has a 6 episode fling with Dawson and never shows up after episode 10 and is VERY RARELY mentioned even though shes related to Jen and she flinged with Dawson

#2)Alot of the episodes revolve around Joey this season especially Pacey, he is probably in it more than Dawson

#3)Jen isn't in this season alot, she dosent even appear in a few episodes!

#4)The season starts with a completely different theme song! ""Run like mad"" It was cool at the start, then it just got odd and didn't put oomph into the opener,which made the show look boring, now i am very used to this, itll grow on you, seriously i cant even remember the other opener!

#5)The characters, like Henry ,Ethan and the principals daughter, you grow to like the character and youd think theyd be in the series for awhile, as for Henry, as soon as him and Jen made up, he leaves for footbal camp, Also A.J, these stupid little characters just never appear again.

#6) The features absolutley suck, the commentaries is anything from GREATLY entertaining, the map is cool at the start then it goes boring...quickly, also... well nothing CAUSE THEY ARE ALL THE FEATURES! unless you count previews of other DVDs a special feature,as for the menus they are cool.

This season is over all, a highly entertaining season but it is very different from the other seasons, too many changes not enough Dawson, and if it is, hes whining over Joey going with Pacey even though he turned down Joeys offer to get back together!! UGH! it still is good, but I think this couldve used more solid in more than a season characters.

It ends on a happy/sad/annoying note.

The love triangle is also very fascinating!

the most confusing episode is The longest Day, omg i thought the DVD was f%^$^&d up cuz it kept on repeating the start , but it all pans out in the end.

Not until Four to Tango did I start to see why I loved this season so much.  This was the beginning of the Joey, Dawson, Pacey Triangle.  Although, there are still some remnants of Jen and Pacey trying to hook up which was a horrible fiasco that was hard to watch.  But at least Eve was long gone and by Episode 10 things really started to get back on track.  The season finale episode was the perfect ending to the season with Pacey and Joey sailing away together on his boat True Love.

The bonus material is pretty weak.  Finally there is a cast member on the audio commentary but it's pretty boring.  It's Kerr Smith and the producer who talk on episode 10 and the season finale.  But for the most part they barely talk about the episodes they are watching.  They made one or two comments about a few of the actors but mostly they talked about what they did during the summers or how Kerr met his wife.  Do we care?  Although the producer does explain why they have a different song during the intro than Paula Coles'.  I understand that songs are expensive but it is a little unnerving to hear a different song.  But I just fast-forwarded through it anyways. The interactive map of Capeside lets you select certain spots in Capeside like Joey's Dock or The Beach and then it shows a clip from this season of the show with the characters at that spot.  I got bored with this very quickly.  Overall the bonus material is extremely lacking.  However if you are a Pacey and Joey fan then you will love this season.",1108339200,,1666,4.374592833876221

I have to say, though, season 2 was kind of a disappointment to me.  So I was pleasantly surprised to find that season 3 is absolutely phenomenal.  Anyone watching the show will fall in love with the Pacey-Joey love story.  It is enchanting, well-acted, well-scripted, and strangely believeable.  This season shows the process by which the two fall in love, which is incredible.  Michelle Williams and Kerr Smith put in wonderful performances as Jenn and Jack, as does Mary Beth Peil as Grams.  We also see Dawson's parents mend their broken bridges in a beautiful, touching way.  John Wesley Shipp and Mary Margaret Humes are wonderful in these roles.  Bessie is still the incredible ideal sister, and very well-acted as well.  Actually, the only poor acting in this season in my opinion is Michael Pitt as Henry, but that may just be because his character was basically a whiny immature overemotional freshman...anyways, season 3 is highly recommended.  to me, the highlight is the episode ""anti-prom,"" the part during which Joey and Pacey are dancing to the song ""my invitation"" (which is amazing, too), as Dawson and Andie look on.  the best season of the entire series.",1106784000,3,1294,4.858447488584475

You can't go without any sound. Otherwise your audiance would fall asleep. So changing the music in the show might make scenes better, but the theme song is what identifies the show. Look at CSI, you know when you hear the sound it's that show. So they wanted to get creative with the show.....you should have done it when it was on. leave it alone. At least if it was on the air you had the chance to see reactions from people. But because it's on DVD it's a little harder to return something if it's openned. For example, ace ventura pet detective. I liked the theatrical release, and have the VHS version, but when it came time to own the DVD. They changed it around and added new scenes,....and they suck. And you can't get the old version anywhere. It lost all the funny. Thats what happens when things get changed. Come out with directors cut and let the audiance decide. That way everyones happy.

Season 1 was great, obviously.  Season 1 uses all the most obvious story lines such as that main characters falling for each other (Dawsons and Jen, Dawson and Joey).  It's very basic, but this is good because we've never seen it before.

Season 2 did nothing new.  They re-hashed everything from Season 1 with no new storylines except for Joey's father which wasn't that great.  And some of the breakups between Dawson and Joey (there were like a rediculous number - 3 per episode!) were EXCRUCIATING.  The writing and logic was so bad, half the time (and even Paul Stupin admitted) that you have no idea what Joey and Dawson are actually arguing about.

Now we get Season 3, albeit the really bad new opening song (I think we all love the Paula Cole song and I personally watch the opening credits just for that song every episode), the story lines are so much better and they're actually new.  I thought Eve (character in the first six episodes) was great and it really kicked up the spark and sexiness of the show and I'm a hardcore DC fan too, and I still thought Eve was great.  Jen a cheerleader, Jack a football player... it's great.  And now every episode has Jack dealing somehow with his sexuality, it's really great.  I'm only about halfway through but I'm really excited about the show.

I recommend this season to anyone over Season 2.",1103068800,,1519,4.52014652014652
2054700,5,B0002234R2,"Since it first aired, Dawson's creek captured the minds and hearts of every single teen, pre-teen, and occasional parent, who viewed it.  Season 3 is by far the best season.  The budding romance of Joey and Pacey provides the most interesting story line in the history of the show.  The incident with principal Green is also moving.  Perhaps, however, the most entertaining and emotionally moving episode is ""The Longest Day.""  This set is defiantly worth buying, you will not be dissapointed.",1102982400,2,493,5.037037037037037
2054701,5,B0002234R2,"The third season of ""Dawson's Creek"" is very important to the whole series plot, since the love triangle Dawson--Joey--Pacey emerges and that will influence the show until its end. At the beginning of the season, we find Dawson making new discoveries with a misterious and sexy blonde, Eve, which upsets Joey. Jen finally finds true love with the naive and passionate freshman, Henry, who is not ashamed to show his feelings for Jen in public places. Jack tries to take control of his gay life and struggles to give his first steps towards a real relationship, meeting a college guy, Ethan, who helps Jack to find out who he is. Pacey takes care of Joey, as requested by Dawson, but is surprised when the protection he gives becomes love. Joey also loves Pacey, but is frightened by Dawson's reaction and the fact that her soulmate may hate her.

Many people are criticizing Columbia for the replacement of third season songs. Of course, music plays an important role in ""Dawson's Creek"", but the new songs chosen for the DVD release are not bad at all. The opening theme of third season is ""Run like mad"", by Jann Arden, which was also the opening theme outside US when the show was being broadcasted on TV. I kind of like this song, which is very related to the series spirit, and sometimes fits better than ""I don't wanna wait"", by Paula Cole.

The final episode of third season, ""True love"", is great! I love the dialogues between Pacey, Joey and Dawson and it's great to see that Joey had the courage to make the right choice being with Pacey, in spite of Dawson's reaction. After all, you never know if something is really yours, until you let it go...

If you are a fan of Dawson's Creek, this is a season you can't miss! I'll start watching fourth season right now....",1098835200,3,1776,4.578616352201258
2054702,5,B0002234R2,"I will agree that it did suck when they changed the music, but the show is still fantastic.  Its always a little awkward when something new comes along.....well enough of that let's get to the season.  I love the opening episode ""Like a Virgin"" it shows Dawson meeting the new girl Eve who starts to make everyones pulse beat just a little faster!!! This season also has the destuction of Pacey and Andie's relationship after she has an affair. This season does have a drawback though.  The story about Eve being Jen's sister should have been played out.  Just as it was getting good Eve leaves town and Dawson talks with Jen's mother at Thanksgiving and they just kida let it go.  That could have been wrapped up a little better.  This season contains two of my favorite episodes ever.  ""A weekend in the Country"" was a great episode where Pacey invites Fred Frickey to come to the Potter B&B and things don't go as planned.  This has one of my favorite scenes between Dawson and Jen when they are talking in the moonlight.  They made such a great couple when they actually got to have a relationship later on in the 5th season.  That was just a beautiful scene.  I think this is the episode where Pacey actually stops to think and realize that he is falling completely and hopelessly in love with Joey. My favorite episode ever is the ""Longest Day"",  This is the episode that Joey and Pacey try to tell Dawson about how they feel.  Dawson finds out from Jen earlier that day.  What is so awsome about this episode is that it keeps going back in time and showing the day from different view points.  All in all this episode was just well done.  Hats off to Paul Stupin!!!  The season finalle ""True Love"" ends with Dawson telling Joey to go with Pacey even though it kills him and she rides off into the sunset with Pacey on True Love.  I just love the end where Dawson is like ""Why does it hurt so much?  and Andie says ""Becasue our pain makes us real.""  So this season is a must have for all you Creek Fans order it today yo won't regret it .  Also I think you will love the virtual tour of capeside!!!!",1098489600,4,2105,4.346153846153846

 I just purchased season 4 today. And as I was browsing the net - I came across this review section. I almost read all 169 reviews - and most of them I concur with - the problem with the music. I am deeply disappointed with the replacement music and hope things have changed for the better for future DVD releases. But if they haven't - I would like to request from some of the die-hard fans to please research and post the Sony website - e-mail address or physical address so we can all voice our opinions on the reasons why we would like the original music put back into the episodes. I also agree with paying a little more money to have them do this! The music was so intertwined with the show, the characters and the emotions - that it feels like something is missing or just a little off with each episode!
 Hope to see any type of information in future reviews!

 Thanks everyone!!!

2054706,4,B0002234R2,"I nestled in with a cup of cocoa and my DVD remote all set and ready for DC Season Three. I do not have cable, so I have not been privileged to viewing the show on TBS. So, the long awaited Season 3--the road to Joey and Pacey together!!!--finally arrived. Intro...and ""I don't wanna wait..."" WAIT!!! What the heck happened to the theme song???? Something must be wrong, Paula Cole is not singing. Hmmm, must be an error with the first episode...

NO! The producers changed most, if not all, of the music that goes with these episodes. EVEN THE THEME SONG! What the heck is with that??? It really sucks because I love this show so much, and many of my memories of the scenes have connections to the songs that were originally playing. I believe it is in the season finale, it is really weird when Jen makes the comment about some overplayed pop song playing in the background of their melodrama...You are wrong, Jen. Well, that used to be the case, but now it is some song no one has ever heard!

While I love the show and everything about it, I am not giving this DVD collection (or any other ones that have the music changed) the full 5 stars because the new music disrupts my viewing pleasure as I am thrown off every time something happens and the original music is not playing. Most of the most memorable scenes in the show are linked in my mind to the music that was playing. So, I guess I will have to wait until I hear the music on the radio to remember those scenes so fondly. I won't be able to have that experience in watching the DVDs.

I wish there was some way to contact the producers and give them this piece of my mind, but I can't find anything like that on the DC website. Maybe they will read this review!",1097020800,6,1725,4.269113149847095

This starts a new relationship between Joey and Pacey and everything just gets ugly from there.  The only disapointing aspect of this DVD is the total change in Music through the season including the theam song, this might not have been the best Idea, all the original songs were matched perfictly with every emotion and seen, also in the Boat race episode they replace the very fitting Megadeth song ""Crush em'"" with a song that dosent even relate to the seen, and that is why I could only give 4 out of 5 stars.

2054719,5,B0002234R2,"The third season of Dawson's Creek is absolutely perfect. The first two seasons were okay, as well as the fourth, but afther the fourth season the show just went down hill. The reason the third season is perfect is partialy because of where the story went and partialy because of the actors. Many people think that the Joey-Pacey relationship was a mistake because Dawson and Joey are soul mates. What these less than observant people don't seem to understand is what the show tried to make clear in their best twist ever. If one pays attention one sees early on, before Dawson and Joey ever become more than just friends, that it can't work. They are not each others one and only, they loved each other for the people they knew each other to be as kids, as fifteen year olds, not for the people they were meant to become. Joey and Pacey, that is a reallistic relationship, surprising, complicated, undeniable. And it was the actors that helped it seem so right. Joshua Jackson was perfect for the role of the guy who loved the girl so much that he was willing to sacrafice his own happiness for hers. He got every longing look, every painfilled sigh perfect. Then there's Katie Holmes who played Joey flawlessly, she was enchanting as Joey. She could say so much with just a look, a glance at the camera and the attentive audience knew exactly what she was thinking and feeling. And suddenly one could see that in the world that the characters lived in this was real and in the end they confirmed that all of the suspicions that began in the third season about what true love is was confirmed, because the right people ended up together. The third season is the best season because it contained the pefect twist.",1095206400,5,1713,4.564935064935065
2054720,3,B0002234R2,"I know we're all pretty mad about the changed songs, especially about them changing the main title theme 'I Don't Want To Wait' by Paula Cole.  I see in a lot of the postings here that there is a lot of speculation about why they did that.  I was going over the DVD's special features and I noticed that on one of the commentary tracks they shed some light on issue.  There are excerpts of it in the main Amazon review, but below is the uedited statement:

Executive Producer Paul Stupin quoted here from the DVD commentary of episode 310 'First Encounters Of The Close Kind':

""You'll notice that there is a different song playing here over the main titles and this song by Jann Arden was used originally for the international release of the series; the first several seasons.  And I always loved it and I thought, well, let's mix up things a little bit.  Let's be a little creative.  And so we're putting the song on our third season DVD release and I think it's... it's just... again we've all heard the Paula Cole song 10,000 times and I thought it just might be a little bit different, a little more fun.  And also there was... I'll be honest, a little bit of an economic reality.  But, uh, anyway, I hope that you enjoy it.""

So there you have it folks.  That is pretty much as official an answer as we are ever going to get.  Looks like Paula Cole wanted a truckload of money for the song in DVD distribution and the execs decided not to pony up the cash.

I personally think the song was worth the extra money because the show seems different and almost... ruined because of it.  And that comment is not even considering the changed songs within the episodes themselves.  YES, the music is that important.

It doesn't seem like they will change this course with season 4 and I think they are losing DVD sales that would have more than made up for the sum Miss Cole wanted.  I, for one, will not be buying the fourth season.

Anyway, just wanted to throw in my 2 cents.  I hope the execs are reading this...",1094688000,2,2014,4.348525469168901

I'm sorry but I still am not too accepting of a Joey-Pacey belonging together mentality, but I love the show and I just keep hoping one day they have a reunion show to show that Joey and Dawson are always meant to be together (sigh, just wishful thinking). I know some people are sick of hearing all about the fans being up in arms over the music being changed but all I can say is ""Were you there from the beginning?? Did you spend every single Wednesday night watching this wondefully captivating, and for me nostalgic show about life, love, friendship, family?"" Until you were there for the whole ride, the music doesn't matter to those who never heard what it was before. For those who watched season 1, can you imagine the final scene of the season when Joey asks Dawson is he ready for all that comes with telling the truth and Dawson pauses and Joey turns to leave and ""say goodnight, not goodbye"" comes on? I would have been seriously upset if they had done one single thing to mess up the most perfect moment in that season. Well it's a similar instance in Seasons 2 and 3 and I think it really sucks that they changed the music. It's like them saying to those fans who love the show, ""we don't care if you love it like it is, and that you can associate music with certain scenes in the show, we just want to change it cause we can"". There hasn't been another tv show that's gone and changed the THEME MUSIC for DVD release. That part is just a pure outrage!!!! I can remember each episode watching them, and hearing the music begin before the opening scene ended and feeling so happy watching the intro. Now, I nearly puked when I first heard that AWFUL Jann Arden song. It's not only awful, it doesn't fit what I used to feel when that show first began. I just feel ripped off. I wasn't going to buy the dvd because I kept hoping all this uproar would make them re-release an unaltered version. I still pray they do, or atleast they don't EVER change the intro, and music again in the next 3 seasons and leave it the way it originally was. Why don't they offer a choice, like click here to here an alternate soundtrack and let people choose if they want to hear that hideous intro they've now added, or if people want to ""not mess with a good thing"" and hear Paula Cole. I pray if anyone reads this that is in any position to do something about this, PLEASE LET EM KNOW THE FANS WANT IT THEY WAY IT WAS! DO NOT MESS UP THIS GREAT SHOW BECAUSE THAT IS NOT FAIR TO THE FANS!!!! I stopped watching in season 3 and because of work and everything caught a few here and there of each season, and I am hoping they all hurry up and come out on DVD so I can sit back and enjoy it all in a continous marathon!!!!",1094342400,,2826,4.2255083179297594

Why do people always have to change the music it bites. When you here ""I'll be there for you"" you think ""Friends"" how would you feel if you went to buy season 8 and they change the theme.  Pretty ticked.  I feel so let down and that's just 1/2 of it.

""Like a Virgin"" opening they changed the music which was ""old time R-n-R"" cause he was watching ""Risky Business"" to crap music.

""Secrets and Lies"" they changed the music during the transvesites song and dance b/c it was ""It's raining men"".

""To Green w/love"" they murdered that. It was a very PC episode and was feeled with deep music instead they replaced it w/CRAP.

""True Love"" WHY..WHY..WHY..did they replace the song at the end when the gang is trying to console Dawson and Joey is running across the deck. It was an outrage for music everywhere.

I am now done spouting off. If you people who did this are reading I hope you're happy I wasted $40 and if season 4 has different music I WILL NOT be purchasing it. Also you need to right this wrong and remake season 3 b/c there are alot of outraged die hard fans.

 I got the first season used and cheap and was immediately hooked. I stayed up till 2 to 3 AM catching up on a series I forgot was so much fun. From then on, I bought season 2 and pushed through all the episodes within a week.

 I heard the reviews about season 3 from this site and others. I read how they changed the songs including the theme. At first, I was outraged thinking it wouldn't be DC without Paula Cole singing the theme. The other songs that changed during the episodes did not really affect me because couldn't remember when and where it was played.

 After a while going through the episodes, the new theme grew on me. I was so caught up in the story that the music was an after thought. I also fast forward alot of the times when the title theme came on so it didn't seem all that important.

 I guess for the die hard fan, I can sympathize for them changing things that should never be changed. It was great reliving the relationship between Pacey and Joey in season 3. It was both moving and real the relationship that evolved between them. In anti-prom, when he said ""He remembers everything"" showed his true love to her right there. I was like ""wow"".

 In season three we get to see Jen, the antithesis of the ""in crowd"" become not only a cheerleader but also the Homecoming Queen, as well as meeting her mom again after years. We see Jack the towns only well known homosexual become the star of the football team and then gain the courage to run after the boy he wants. We see Andie, the smartest of the bunch fall under pressure and cheat on her PSATs. We meet a new principal who tries to do great things for his students who in return stand up for him at a crucial time. We see Pacey take care of Joey by Dawson's request and see him fall for her over and over again as they take dancing lessons, help make the Potter B&B a success, and as he comes to her rescue when she needs him the most. We see the show's namesake, Dawson go through confusing times as he tries to figure out what he wants when it comes to his future as a film maker and his future with Joey. And finally we see Joey being pulled in many different directions as she learns that one's soul mate is not necessarily always one's ""True Love"".

 One of the interesting episodes includes a Blair Witch Project rip off.

 One of the heart warming episodes includes To Green with Love which portrays the dept of integrity these characters hold.

 The most heart wrenching episodes include, Stolen Kisses, The Longest Day, The Anti-Prom, and True Love which made me fall in love with Joey and Pacey and made me hold my breath, as I patiently waited for them to finally get together. True Love was not a disappointment and by far one of the best Season Finales for any show I have ever seen. It gave new meaning to the clich of sailing off into the sunset.

2054740,4,B0002234R2,"The first episode I ever saw of ""Dawson's Creek"" was when the gang graduated from Cape Side High School, at which point I learned that Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beek) was still a virgin, which certainly took a lot of the suspense out of ""The Complete Third Season."" This is the season that convinces us that Pacey (Joshua Jackson) is serious competition for Dawson in the Joey (Katie Holmes) sweepstakes, not only because Dawson and Joey run hot and cold for each other on alternate timetables but also because Pacey can be awfully darn cute when he wants to be. Consequently his earnest pursuit of the clueless Joey remains the bright spot in a series where most of the characters get seriously sidetracked.

 Season Three begins with a series of oblique turns in the first episode, ""Like a Virgin."" Joey is interested in Dawson, which should be a good thing, but he is fascinated by the mysterious Eve, a new bad girl in town and end up crashing his dad's boat and trying the whole ""Risky Business"" approach to making the money he needs to get the boat fixed. Jen (Michelle Williams) does a wonderful job of demolishing the school's head cheerleader, in a telling speech about what life will be like 25 years down the road, and in a twist of fate that defies logic in the high school I remember is made Head Cheerleader. Apparently now once Kevin Williamson was gone, the idea was to jerk the chains of the characters as often as possible.

 Eve continues to titillate and embarrass Dawson in turn, Jen gets to experience the joys of Homecoming Queen along with being Head Cheerleader (""Secrets and Lies""), Jack (Kerr Smith) joins the football team as the gay wide receiver (""Homecoming""), and Andie (Meredith Monroe) comes back from the sanitarium only to cheat on the PSAT (""None of the Above"") and then slowly but surely melt down again as the guilt eats away at her. When Jen decides to respond to the advances of the freshman quarterback that just has to be the most unbelievable thing she did in the entire run of the show, while Pacey having to deal with troubled little kid Buzz (Jonathan Lipnicki) just screams ""blatant attempt to increase the ratings."" Only when the cast gets out of Capeside and goes off to Boston in ""First Encounters of the Close Kind"" to see what college life could be like do we remember why we like these characters or were rooting for them.

 Okay, so there is large downside to the third season of ""Dawson's Creek,"" but it is not like you should skip over the season and move on to the fourth because some things do happen here that you are going to want to remember later on. When Pacey gets the lead in the school play "" Northern Lights,"" that at least makes sense and when Joey's mural is defaced (""Crime and Punishment"") and the principal's job ends up in jeopardy because of his response (""To Green, With Love"") there is at least some idea Capeside is in the real world. But when Pacey actually kisses Joey (""Cinderella Story""), we are back on track big time, because each is so busy being concerned with what Dawson will think (""Neverland"") that they sort of forget to deal with what they think about what just happened. Of course they are immediately thrown together in intimate circumstances (""Stolen Kisses""), so that they can suffer for their unexpressed feelings, and we get to the season's best episode, ""The Longest Day,"" in which the triangle explodes and we can safely say that nothing will ever be the same again.

 Of course even if Dawson has not been interested in Joey all year that is no reason for him not to be interested now that Pacey wants her and the next thing we know Dawson and Pacey are having a macho grudge match during the Capeside Regatta (""Show Me Love""), where you just know that who wins the race will lose the girl. When you get to the point where Dawson and Pacey might start beating up on each other over Joey then things are getting promising. Never mind that Jen is still dealing with the kid quarterback, that Dawson is supposedly giving up his film-making career, and that we are still worried about the Potter Bed & Breakfast.

 This show comes down to Dawson, Joey, and Pacey, where any combination of the two is usually a good thing and having all three involved turns this into a twisted teenage version of the most famous love triangle of Arthur, Guenivere, and Lancelot. Even though this is the third of the show's six seasons, what happens at this point not only sets up the final episode with Joey's final choice, but retroactively recasts everything that happened previously so that it bears on how this triangle plays out. So three stars on the first half, five on the second, and we will split the difference overall.",1090627200,33,4712,4.605482717520858

2054742,4,B0002234R2,"OK The new theme song is a little slow, and I am just as fond of the original theme song. But people this is not the place to bash the DVD. If you want them to know your displeasure email sony........They will direct your complaints to the proper sources. The Music changes for the rest of te shows were hardly noticable. The important songs like Finally found You, PRomise Me This, Hold On, and My Invitation were still in there and in there right spots. They did not butcher it as much as they did Season 2 when in the end not one song was there from the original.
As for the season, it is still a great season. I still think that Pacey and Joey are a far better couple than Dawson and Joey. The producers were able to run with it, where as the Dawson and Joey one was stagnent.
I also agree that the commentary sucked!!! Email Sony and complain.",1090108800,2,848,4.208588957055214
2054743,5,B0002234R2,"Reading all the reviews about the theme song and music changes, I waited a little while to buy it.  I don't know why because it is one of the best seasons of DC.  The Pacey/Joey storyline makes the whole set (and show).  Dawson is a little too boring and selfish this season.  As far as the theme song change, I think I was more upset at the thought of the change than I was when I first heard it.  But that alone was not enough to pass up on this season.  The interactive tour of Capside is pretty cool.  Going around to various places and showing a short clip of something that happened there during season 3.  It is too good of a show not to get and keep my collection going.",1090108800,,678,4.083333333333333

2054745,4,B0002234R2,"Season 3 was the first I had ever seen of Dawson's Creek on television. When the WB hosted a special on Pacey and Joey's relationship, I was hooked. The show manages to talk about teenage issues without sounding like a lecture and the acting done by the actors is first rate.
Sony/Columbia still has not gotten the point that squeezing 23 episodes onto 4 discs is not ideal. The image quality is somewhat grainy as a result. Typically other tv shows have 6 discs to hold a comparable number of episodes. Hopefully they will have changed that for season 4. Also, it would be good for the show to change back the theme song to the one by Paula Cole. Additionally, I find it annoying that the episodes should have Spanish and Portuguese subtitles and yet not have English subtitles. For those of us that are hard of hearing or for other reasons, English subtitles would make sense. The data footprint would not be significant either.
All in all, this season is one of my favorites. Even without Kevin Williamson's direction (??), the show continues to gain momentum with the development of its characters. I would recommend this season to anyone.",1089936000,4,1143,4.691542288557214
2054746,5,B0002234R2,"I am possibly the *most* closeted Dawson's Creek fan who ever watched the show...so I can't believe I'm actually writing a review, but there are a few things that I felt were necessary to say about this DVD.
#1.  I am a die-hard Pacey/Joey fan, so I obviously could not rate it any less than five stars...but in all seriousness, I felt this dvd was worth a five.  The complaints that I read from other reviewers were that there weren't really any special features, and that the music was changed....which brings me to my second point.
#2.  I must admit, after reading the angry reviews about the change of music, it was with some trepidation that I purchased the dvd....but you know what?  Maybe I am a disloyal fan for saying this, but I actually *like* ""Run Like Mad"" as the theme song.  Don't get me wrong, ""I Don't Want To Wait"" is still one of my favorite songs, but I thought that this one fit well with the mood of this season.  Admittedly, the reviewer who likened it to dying cats may have something, but I still liked it, and it did not ruin a thing for me.
And the lack of special features?  Maybe this is just because I am obsessed with the Pacey/Joey storyline, but as I was watching the dvd, I didn't want to be reminded that I wasn't actually in Capeside.  I didn't want to do anything that would bring me back to the real world....I haven't watched the commentaries, doubt I ever will, and probably wouldn't have used any other special features either.
So maybe my review only makes sense if you are as quirky as I am, and like the sound of cats being slaughtered....but the bottom line?  There isn't anything anyone can do to detract from my love of season three.  Can't wait for the next one!",1089849600,2,1710,4.4
2054747,5,B0002234R2,"The third season of dawson's creek on dvd is the best, the quality of the dvd is super,but there is a little problem with the audio quality. sometimes you can barely hear the sound, what the characters are saying. that's why i hope that in the fourth dvd there will be subtitles in English, i really do hope so...
Other than that, this is the best season of dawson's creek out of all the seasons. this dvd summarizes the beginning of Pacey/Joey relationship. you basically get a pure nostalgia and that's why everybody got to have this dvd at home.",1089676800,,548,4.49

I was quite disappointed to hear the theme song changed...and I really was waiting for this season because I think it was one of the best seasons.  I'm also perturbed that they changed the Jessica Andrews song ""I Will Be There For You"" where Joey is running to catch Pacey before he takes off in his boat.  I think that is a hugely monumental song and they switched it with who knows what and the mood for that scene is in my opinion totally lost.  I hope that in the next DVD releases that they are more loyal to the fans and keep as much of the original music as possible, but at least above all GIVE US BACK OUR THEME SONG!",1089590400,3,731,4.126760563380282
2054749,4,B0002234R2,"The first few episodes of the third season of Dawsons Creek is probably some of the worst episodes of the series. Mainly because of a new character called Eve (horrible actress Brittany Daniels), who bursts into Capeside and causes all kinds of havoc, and eventually she becomes a love interest for Dawson, and luckily she leaves after 6 episodes. Then the season gets on it's feet and quickly becomes the entertaining and dramatic show we all love. This is thanks to the wonderful storyline of Pacey and Joey falling in love with each other. Joshua Jackson and Katie Holmes are excellent and their on screen chemistry is perfect. This arc continues for the rest of the season, and it will you get you hooked wondering what will happen next. Other highlights include giving Kerr Smith a more to do this season, and having him explore the gay lifestyle. Jenn falls for a freshmen quarterback, played with a lot of charm and sincerity by Michael Pitt. Dawson on the other hand, does nothing but mope around this season, and this is when the shows title should have been changed to Joey and Paceys Creek. The dvd collection is a disappointment as there are no behind the scenes featurettes or gag reels or anything. Just an interactive tour of Capeside. The 3rd season is definetly worth buying though, just for the Joey/Pacey storyline.",1089417600,12,1334,4.779220779220779
2054750,3,B0002234R2,"Someone had wrote in a previous review, nobody should write reviews unless they've seen the DVD.  I had wrote a previous review based on my like for season 3, but know have a few new comments in regards to the DVD.
They changed the Dawson's Creek theme song???  Granted, every time I hear the song on the radio, I quickly change the station, it's still the theme.  I've heard everything from, it's a creative decision, to the rights for the song cost Sony an arm and leg to get.  I have a few memorable episodes of season 3 on VHS and had looked forward to finally getting rid of them when season 3 hit on DVD.  Nope!!!  Not now!!!
The producers did change a lot of the music that flowed through each episode too.  Again, cost was one of the main issues I've heard.  That doesn't bother me so much, but the mix is really bad.  I've only seen the first 3 episodes on DVD and in those 3, it was at times difficult to hear dialog because of the poor music mix.  I haven't checked for myself, but from what others have said, they did keep Daydream Believer in which is good considering the impact the song has on the episode ""Stolen Kiss"".
Granted, there are little things that have rubbed me the wrong way with this DVD, the other gripe is the loss of the recap from episode to episode.  I now it's not that big of a deal, but I liked the ""previously on Daswson's Creek"" recap.  I'm a major geek, so who knows.
If you are a Creek fan, it's still worth having.  Maybe wait a while longer for the price to drop and cross your fingers they put things back on track for Season 4...probably my personal favorite.
Happy shopping Creekers.

2054751,3,B0002234R2,"I am a HUUUGGGEEE fan of DC, and I am very upset, I just sat down and started watching the Third season DVD's.  Now, on the package it said new music selected by one of the ""Higher-ups"" in making DC.  At first I thought okay, It's not gonna be so bad I mean they changed some music from the Second season and it wasn't completely ruined. Even Roswell changed some music in the DVD set!
  Boy was I WRONG!!!!  At least the Producers of Roswelll had the commmon sense to at least keep the opening theme of the show on.  BUT THESE IDIOTS CHANGED THE OPENING THEME FOR DAWSON'S CREEK!!!!!!!!!  How can you change the opening theme when, running on TBS, it is the same for re-runs and the other DVD's have the original theme song ""I Don't Wanna Wait"".  The Producers are acting as idiots for changing this!!!!!!! I would not have minded if they would have to make us pay more money for this set; As long as it did not exceed $75.
  Now the reason it has only two stars taken away for the huge mistake they made in the music, I could never give DC a score of less than 3 out of 5 because the series was wonderful and it changed my life.  Everything was good until they left High School.  In case you don't know, this was the year that relationships really changed Joey became serious with someone else besides Dawson, and The group has a lot of changes in their lives this season! Before you buy this set, e-mail the company to see if they will be changing the theme song back to it's original song because they have received many angry e-mails about this saying people would rather pay more for the set just to keep the theme song!",1089331200,,1626,4.260586319218241
2054752,4,B0002234R2,"Like my subject line portends, I have read what others have said about the Season 3 DVD's musical flub and am equally befuddled as to why the producers opted to stray from the show's original score.  I would imagine the directors from these episodes are miffed as well given that a show / film's score constitutes a large portion of its impact.  And when you have a fanatical fanbase like D.C. (myself included) has, you are also bound to have individuals who remember moments based on said musical cues.  [e.g. the closing scene in ""To Green, With Love"" where Joey is standing, back to camera, facing The wall.  In the show's television debut, James Taylor's 'That Lonesome Road' sententiously played (and made me teary) but has since been replaced by some flat substitute.]  The point is, people remember these things, and are devastated when they find them altered / erased.  And about the theme song, there is no need to even go there.  Paula Cole has basically become synonymous (in a good way) with D.C. because of its theme.  Bring it back Sony!  Is there any way to write their execs about this I wonder in the hopes of a re-issue?  Anyway, this season is phenomenal; just needs the old music.

I have always planned on buying these DVD's, but now that I know the music has been tampered with, I don't really know. They removed ""I Don't Want to Wait"" & put in some Jann Arden song, which is really stupid in my opinion. Everyone loved the theme song, it made the series what it is. I know they planned on putting ""One Hand in My Pocket"" as the theme song in the first place, but Paula Cole's song is much, much better. Although Buffy the Vampire Slayer & Dawson's Creek were both great shows, Buffy DVD's are much, much better than these. Way more bonus materials than these DVD's. But Dawson's Creek was such a great show!!! It's such a disapointment to hear how these turned out. But, if you really love the show, buy the DVD's! It's still a great show (even with the music screwed up)! But, I would really like to see the DVD's rereleased with the real music & not that crap.

Andie (Meredith Monroe) returns to Capeside and her relationship grows distant from Pacey.  The season contains a shocking revelation about Jen (Michelle Williams) and a mysterious new girl Eve (Brittany Daniels) and dives deeper in Jack's homosexuality as he faces intense scrutiny by playing for Capeside High's football team.  The season contains a Blair Witch Project inspired episode and one that is shown through three different perspectives (inspired by a Katie Holmes' movie Go).

Particularly crass is the weblink to the site that sells the replacement songs as a new DC soundtrack.  And the commentary has nearly nothing to do with the episodes they cover.

The quality of the DVD is much better.  I hate that they changed the music, but they didn't change as many as in the season two DVD.
The change of theme song was a shocker, but I have to admit that it is nice to get a chance to hear the great Jann Arden song.
I wish the producers would add one more disc to the set just for extra space.  The interactive tour of Capeside was very cool & interesting, but I would like to see more information about the show-behind the scenes, deleted scenes, bloopers, the summer diaries. (I know on the DC website, they have some really good scenes that got cut from the fifth & sixth season, so I hope they will release those with the DVD.)  It is a good set to have as a keepsake, but it would've meant more if it was as it orginally aired-definately would shell out the extra $$$ for it.
So I hope the producers keep the other seasons coming, hopefully with more extras & less music changes.  I hear Season 4...my fave....is coming out in Dec '04 (Gretchen was Dawson's true & first love...like to think they ended up together)",1088640000,,1302,4.341563786008231

It just kind of takes away the impact of the show, the magic of it all. I really hope they don't change some of the very important songs.. like when Dawson's dad gets hit by the car -- he was singing that old song, that now, whenever I hear it, I think of the show. While the show is outstanding and engaging and emotional, this change proved to be too much. Honestly, if this keeps up, I don't see many people buying upcoming seasons. I can live with the music changes, though some of the songs don't fit. I love this show and I always will. But I can't help but be extremely disappointed with the producer. One thing that is good about the season is that the quality is much better. The picture isn't as grainy as it was on seasons 1 and 2. However, I would have taken grainy rather than a change in music. If you really love this show, of course go out and buy it. I'd recommend it to anyone. If you aren't very attached to it, still go out and buy it. You will love it and the theme song probably won't even matter to you. But that doesn't change the fact that a lot of people are going to be really upset about this, so I hope they keep that in mind.",1088553600,,1421,4.024734982332156
2054787,3,B0002234R2,"Dawson's Creek's Season Three is an unbelievable season. That said, the trend of changing memorable songs is getting out of hand. What were they thinking replacing ""I Don't Wanna Wait"" with another song! That song IS Dawson's Creek. It was such a weird feeling to hear another song (even though they once briefly used it internationally)  ? especially since it changes the whole mood of the show. The theme song often begins in the background, while the first scene is still in process so it does have an affect. I understand that there are licensing issues, but the producers need to pick their battles more wisely.

I'll admit that some songs I hardly notice, but some are really apparent. For instance, in that great scene at Jen's Homecoming Gala the drag queens on stage originally sang ""It's Raining Men"" and it was replaced with another song. It's really obvious (you can actually see the women singing the original song to different music) and it totally takes away from the energy of the moment.
Die-hard fans will certainly buy this season ? but these ""creative changes""may steer others away. The producers may have just done themselves a huge disservice.
I only hope that Season 4 can retain some of its great songs such as: ""What A Wonderful World""(Dawson & Mr. Brooks), ""I Will Remember You"" (Andie's farewell speech), and ""I Think God Can Explain"". I guess we'll have to wait and see.",1088553600,7,1398,4.796680497925311

they changed almost every song! what you remembered on tv, the emotions will all be gone. demand nothing short of the original, not the watered down half-assed version

I just bought the dvd's today. The song isn't that bad, the Paula Cole song SHOULD be there, I'm not condoning Paul Stupin's stupid ""creative"" attempt...but it's not a terrible song, though it doesn't really sink in with the opening credits. Otherwise, it a pretty good set of dvd's if you look beyond the change of music. I just hope to god that they do not change anything about season 4 when it comes out on dvd, because to me, besides the first season, the 4th is one of the best. I liked it ALOT.

These episodes are so great I would by them in any format because my tapes are going to wear out eventually. Despite a shakey beginning, this really is the best season of Dawson's Creek because Joey and Pacey come together and its the start of a grand romance. He was just supposed to be the sidekick and she was supposed to be Dawson's soulmate, but the chemistry of these two is really out of this world, takes over the show and drives it for the next season. The love triangle culminates in the last 5 or 6 episodes of the season and they are really heartbreaking, powerful and angst ridden- great TV viewing!
And trust me- this season has sold more than 5 copies. The reviewer below was confusing the sales rank (5 at that time for all Amazon DVD's and 4 now) with how many copies had been sold.",1088467200,2,907,4.372781065088757

Part of the reason I will not buy it is they changed the music. But what I can not forgive is the quality of the picture is not very sharp or good. It is not better than a good VHS copy. At times the picture looked grainy. Some have said they used compression because they did not want to include an extra DVD. This set should really have another DVD so the quality would be better, they would not have to cram so many episodes into one disc.
While I love Dawson's Creek and would tell everyone to watch it on TBS, I can not reccomend this DVD set. I believe the studio will eventually get it right and re-release all the seasons with enough DVD's to keep picture quality high and will the original music. That is the DVD set I will wait for, even if it takes a few years.

This is unacceptable. Don't buy this set! Teach the studio a lesson, and let them know that replacing the theme song just to save a few bucks will not be tolerated. And just how much is being spent on these sets, anyway? They're cramming 4 and 5 episodes on one disc (which degrades the picture quality), they're replacing nearly all of the original songs, and now they've changed the theme song. They're destroying the heart and soul of the series with each successive release. What's in store for season 4?

As many other reviewers have mentioned, the original music choices really added a lot to the show. A lot of these replacements are lame songs by nobody artists that really don't fit the moment in the show. One of the best examples is the episode: ""To Green, with Love"" where Principal Green is forced out of Capeside. This original episode had the PERFECT songs at the perfect times (see dawsonscreekmusic.com for a list)...but the replacement tunes just take so much away from the drama of the episode. The biggest injustice however is the replacement of the theme song, Paula Cole's ""I don't wanna wait."" I mean c'mon, they even used that in the first two seasons on DVD (Season 1 had ALL it's original music).

2054820,2,B0002234R2,"Let me begin by saying I am a huge fan of the Creek. Not only do I own all the Cds, books, t-shirts etc. I have been able to get my hands on I also made the trip to Wilmington twice to meet the cast which considering I live in Ireland is a bit of a journey. I wouldn't do it for any other show but DC always inspired a different level of passion in me. So when I heard the show was finally coming to DVD I was thrilled. Three box sets later however and my disappointment just grows and grows. I am asking Paul Stupin personally-how are you allowing CTHV to botch these sets so so badly.
Firstly the image quality is awful. You cannot compress 23 episodes onto 4 discs and expect a quality result. Interesting to note that the Region 2 releases are 6 discs. Secondly the lack of extras is appalling. There is a huge wealth of background material out there for possible inclusion-something I know for a fact. Finally on this season we get a contribution from a cast member but there should be much more than this. The supposed interactive tour of Capeside was originally advertised for Season 2 and dint appear so I will wait and see what happens this time. And then there are the music changes. Perhaps what you don't understand is that most fans already have all these episodes on tape at home. We have watched them countless times. They are very special to us. Changing the music is equivalent to changing the script. As bad as that is changing the theme music is just completely UNACCEPTABLE! If ever there were a theme song more closely identified with a series I haven't heard it. Living in Ireland I am used to Jann Ardens track for Season 1 as that was the way the show launched internationally. But Paula Cole is the ONE AND ONLY theme song that matters.
I have to echo the sentiments of other fans here and say that I am more than happy to pay MORE MONEY (hear that CTHV)for a better quality product. How can a series like Firefly which was cancelled after 12 episodes produce a stunning DVD boxset and yet a series like DC which ran successfully for SIX seasons and was a hit all over the world is producing such sub-standard and heartbreakingly disappointing DVD box sets. We waited so so long for these Paul. Why are you letting us down so badly?
Here is what I think the sets should be providing. All episodes presented in Widescreen (after all that was how they were shot and the R2 BEst of DVD is in widescreen). Multiple commentaries with both cast members and writers/directors from the series. Featurettes featuring behind the scenes material and exposes of beautiful Wilmington locations. Deleted/Extended scenes and bloopers. Paul you have all this material-WHY ARE YOU NOT USING IT???? For the first time I am now not going to buy the Season 3 set on Region 1- which is howI bought Season 1 and 2. At least the R2 Season 3 set has six discs for better image quality if nothing else.
And if by any chance Katie, James, Josh, Michelle or Meredith may ever read this pleasepleaseplease can you come back and offer to contribute something to these DVDs. We miss you all so much that it would make a huge difference. Because as things stand the memory of a great show is being sullied by either corporate negligence or worse indifference to the fans.",1088380800,5,3265,4.461538461538462
2054821,5,B0002234R2,"Yes, I will be purchasing DC Season 3 tomorrow morning. But what can I say about Season 3 that will persuade YOU to buy it?
Season 3 is one of my top favorite seasons! I kind of liked it for the sheer drama of it all -- I loved watching the relationship between Pacey and Joey evolve, although I did shed some tears during the Dawson-Joey breakup.
This season marked a major switch for me, for I had previously HATED the character of Joey, but she proved herself to be a dynamic character, and, therefore, I gave her a chance. Now I see her for whom she really is... an old soul with a heck of a lot of emotional baggage. (In my old age, as I am long past high school -- and even college -- I can even relate to her.)
Watching the reruns of Season 3 on TBS has been great... but I'm really REALLY looking foward to Seasons 4 and 5. Nothing like reliving senior year and the whole college experience!",1088380800,,899,4.142857142857143

I think that because I only began watching this show in it's second season I missed alot of the Dawson /Joey pull of the show in season one (I have since seen all the episodes- and also own both seasons on DVD).  I must say that the way the season makes you pull for Pacey and Joey to be together is such a credit to the writers.  I would have never put them together at first, but the way this season progresses you WANT them together so much.  My favorite episodes from this season (which of course put Pacey and Joey in the forefront) are Crime and Punishment, Stolen Kisses, The Anti-Prom, and the Season Finale.

Joey, I'm going to kiss you now.
Joey: You can't.
Pacey: Jo, you can't say something like that to me and expect me not to kiss you. So that's exactly what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna kiss you in about ten second and if you don't want me to kiss you. Well, if you don't want me to then I guess you're just gonna have to stop me... Ten.

Joey Potter is my role model, she brave and courageous and is not afraid to speak her mind. Joey has gone through so much, but manages to somehow overcome it, it's amazing.

What I do think is that if you just sat and read the 54 reviews prior to mine you must be just as much as a die hard fan as I am (I read the previous 54 too) whether you are a D/Jer or a P/Jer, it doesn't matter.  You will buy this set along with every other season they come out with.  Why?  Because the show is excellent & you must own every season on DVD because even though you have them taped on VHS that doesn't include any extra's, and is lesser in viewing quality, or well it doesn't have the pretty cover either damn it. Whatever your excuse... Common' a year later, (after the finale), you can sit in front of your PC and read into all the drama & debate people still feel the need to stir up over who did or did not couple off upon the end of the show, Andies issues, Jacks sex life or lack thereof, & Jen's freshman (this is the s. 3 DVD release right). So don't deny it. This show moves those who watch it, no matter what season it is. To be capable of evoking feelings that enthrawled you to read 55 reviews on a shopping website proves just that.  So why I am I wasting your time? Buy It...",1086048000,3,1287,3.9728682170542635
2054838,5,B0002234R2,"Season 3 was by far one of the best!  I absolutely adored Pacy and Joey together, and no one saw that one coming.  This season truly shows how people grow and change over time, and the season set the stage for everything that happens in the next 3 seasons, and definitely shows the evolution of the show.  I can't wait for season 4 to be released!",1086048000,,347,4.2272727272727275
2054841,2,B0002234R2,"I would have to say that the third season of Dawson's Creek was definatly next to the worst (next to the sixth).  This was the season that Kevin Williamson the show's creator stopped playing a major role in the writing of the episodes and when that happened everything became a giant mess.  Pacey ends up going after the love of his best friend's life, Dawson goes through a jerk phase, the character known as Eve comes in to the picture (the character was never visited again, I think because the writers realized how stupid of a character she was), Joey stays sweet but falls for a guy she basically couldn't stand in the other two seasons, and Jen dates a guy named Harry, Jack begins to explore his dating options (without actually dating anyone), and Andy is just there in the way for the most part. Andy really literally is just there in most of the episodes to cause drama with Pacey in most of these episodes. They really don't use that amazing character to her full potential and I guess never did with the exception of season 2. This is the point in the series where Dawson's Creek became little more than a run of the mill teen drama, where as season's one and two set the show apart from that title.
I think this season definatly did not live up to the quality of performance and writing as the two previous ones.  Yes it is necissary for the over all effect of the series, and it sets you up for the biggest slap in the face which was the series finale.  You should definatly buy this season however, so that you'll be ready for a fantastic season 4, and by the way let's hope they don't tamper with the music this time and pretend like it's a good thing!",1085875200,6,1668,4.353697749196141

Being a major fan of the show will make me biased but this season just emulates the real reason behind the show! PACEY! As in other seasons there are episodes you don't like or are less interested in this season has no such episode. Each episode such as Cinderella Story,Home Movies and True Love is excellent leading to the climax of the truest love ever. PACEY & JOEY. Aptly in my mind it is called Pacey's Creek, whether you follow the show or not, this is a season to be owned by everyone. It gives everyone hope that even the black sheep of the group can become the leading man and get the girl. Joshua Jackson and Katie Holmes light up the screen as the true lovers.

We see Joey denying her love for him but then returning it passionately, in the breathtaking episode ""Stolen Kisses"". Then a few more downs, coupled with some touching scenes like the one in ""The Anti-Prom"", and finally they get together.. in ""True Love"".

2054846,4,B0002234R2,"I started watching Dawson's Creek when it first aired, but during the second season I became disinterested with the constant ""are they/aren't they"" of Joey and Dawson.  To be honest, Joey annoyed me to no end with her insecurities.  Everybody has them, but she seemed a charicature of a teenage girl.  And I'm her age, so it's not a generation gap thing.

Anyway, I recently watched the entire series on TBS.  I had watched the series finale, so I knew how the show ended, but I wanted to see everything that happened leading up to it.

After watching the first two seasons, the third season was excellent.  The characters started to grow up and make more sense.  They were still teenagers with teenage worries, but there was a heart and soul to them that I'd missed during the first two seasons.

I believed Pacey's developing feelings for Joey in a way I never believed Dawson's.  I always kind of felt Dawson just fell into the idea of Joey when things didn't work out with Jen.

It wasn't just Pacey and Joey's friendship/relationship that made season three so much better than the first two.  Jack and Jen's friendship was one of my favorite parts of the show and it really began here.  We started to see him as a character, rather than just a player.  Jen and Gram's great relationship really kicked in.

Everything about this season depicted Dawson's Creek really coming into it's own and deciding what it wanted to be. I'll be skipping the first two seasons on DVD, but starting with the third I may have to have them all.",1085443200,10,1530,4.573529411764706

I love the show and was always a little young to watch it when it was on the WB. I have just seen episodes of DC when i was off from school or during the summer when i wasn't working and i was addicted. After buying the first 2 seasons, which i watched religously, i found myself wanting to be part of the crew and envying their lifes. DC is a great show and much more than just a teen soap and can relate to teenagers all the time with its storylines, i recommend it to anyone and should be a mandatory watch for all teenagers because it provides a look outside of the so called ""popular"" groups and looks a few good friends with a little girl/guy swapping involved, all in all great show, must buy and cant wait for all the seasons to be out and for me to own them",1085356800,,869,3.9431818181818183

Im just short of cash right now so i have to wait for like 2 or 3 months more before i get it.  The thing is, i live in th Philippines and i get all of my DC dvds via amazon. and it costs A LOT to ship it from the states.  Cant wait though.  I have a question though regarding the DVD, will they make the same mistake that they did with the Season 2 DVDs? Will they change the music again?? God i hope not.

But.....I think its kinda stupid that Pacey just hijacked the show and turned it into Pacey's Creek for like a season and a half. And the fact that Dawson became Mr Evil was just stupid and overblown. I really enjoyed the season 6 finale, when P/J got together forever, and I can't wait to get the dvd. But I do wish that people would stop writing TRUE LOVE and booing whenever Dawson comes on screen. C'mon, they're all cool. Except when Andie talks to fast.

2054866,5,B0002234R2,"Alright, as an adult with some sort of weird love for Dawson's Creek, I think that the third and fourth seasons are the best.
The third season tracks Pacey and Joey's relationship, which is more sophisticated and less cumbersome that Dawson and Joey's.
I have the first and second on DVD and have been waiting for this release.  The first season is almost painful to watch in comparison to the thrid.  Now, I just have to sit patiently until the 4th season is released.",1083628800,3,469,4.571428571428571

I also was not a frequent DC watcher until I happened to channel surf into their first road-side kiss. I knew enough of the show to know that that kiss was going to be a huge deal. I got so caught up in the story and was not able to miss a single episode since! Joshua Jackson is an incredible actor, and he was able to portray the pain, happiness, and insecurities that came from starting a relationship with a girl who not only seemed out of his league, but was also considered the ""soulmate"" of his best friend. I can't wait till season four where they become one of the most believable TV couples ever. My favorite line: ""Permission to come aboard?"" I certainly did!",1083456000,6,783,4.36986301369863

2054881,5,B0002234R2,"i've been waiting so long for this season to come out on dvd. it has got to be, by far, the best season out of the six. i think it was brilliantly crafted into a beautiful story of two people who went from not being able to stand next to each other, to ending up being in love with each other. you see how much the boy (pacey) falls for the girl (joey), and how oblivious she really is to it all. pacey becomes more mature as the season goes on, and joey still holds dawson up on a pedestal. overall, the season wasn't overdrawn or corny, it was just right. every time i watch this season, i sort of escape away and get lost within the story of pacey and joey. my favorite episodes are... crime and punishment, cinderella story, the longest day, the anti-prom, and true love. i highly recommend this season if you're a fan of the pacey/joey relationship.",1083110400,3,854,4.277777777777778

2054883,5,B0002234R2,Finally!  Been waiting for Season 3 to be on DVD.  This season is my favorite because this was when Joey and Pacey's friendship developed into a relationship that sets up the series finale and gives us the reason why their ending up together made sense.,1083024000,3,253,4.6
2054884,5,B0002234R2,"I know that it's called Dawson's Creek...really, I do. But Josh Jackson pulled off Pacey amazingly--somehow he's so real. In the first two seasons you see Pacey as more of a class clown, but this is the first glimpse we get of the real Pacey. The third and fourth seasons are my favorite, so I'm really excited they're on DVD! I think this was a great season for Jen, too, because it's when she first climbs out of her shell. Jack, too is becoming more comfortable with himself, and Dawson is beginning to go through some tough times--without the aid of his camera.",1082678400,9,565,4.495145631067961
2054885,5,B0002234R2,"Okay, here it is! The season that redefined Dawson's Creek and truly made it must-see-TV.
There has never been more heartbreaking angst and pure emotional drama packed into a single story on this show than the relationship of Pacey and Joey, and this is where it all begins. From the tentative first realization of feelings to one of the all-time greatest season finales ever, THIS is the season you MUST own.
The Pacey and Joey pairing had every element of a truly great love story, and I have to believe there is a reason those in charge of the show decided to wait a few seasons to let these two characters explore the sparks that were always under the surface between them. The chemistry between these two actors is amazing - truly electric - and undeniable as it carries over onto the screen. There's a little bit of influence from modern day romances like ""When Harry Met Sally..."" or ""Say Anything..."" thrown into this story, as well as that wonderful sort of humorous banter that you usually only got to see in the old Hepburn-Tracy classics. Sweetness and sarcasm abounds...and  Pacey and Joey are also sizzling HOT together.
It's certainly no wonder that the Dawson and Joey relationship on the show was never able to rebound after this season with the majority of the fans. Of course, painting Dawson as the guy coming between TRUE LOVE in this season didn't do his character any favors, but he certainly became the character we loved to disparage, and every TV show needs one of those. We all knew Dawson was going to throw a hissy fit when he found out his best friend and his best girl had fallen in love when he wasn't looking, and he did not disappoint us in all his drama queen glory.
Such great entertainment this season! You get absolute heart-melting moments from Josh Jackson as Pacey (the year he secured the title as everybody's favorite TV boyfriend), terrific acting from Katie Holmes as Joey and even James Van Der Beek steps up to the plate this season and comes through, whether you love or hate Dawson.
Jen and Jack even have good storylines this season, with Jen  (like Joey) finding love in an unexpected place and Jack coming to terms a little more with his homosexuality, and his family's acceptance of that.
THIS is the season of Dawson's Creek that addicted so many of us to the show, and really did change it forever.",1082678400,23,2353,4.626794258373206

From pom-poms, football, homecoming queens and drag queens to strippers, witches, magical lights and anti-proms... are we really still in Capeside.
