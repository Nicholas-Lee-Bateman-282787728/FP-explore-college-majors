Here's a short list of what they could've added (I know a few of these are on these new volumes and the older releases, but the musicians performed multiple songs and some were on multiple episodes, so there's a wealth of unreleased material out there)......

The Hollies
The Bobby Fuller Four
Smokey Robinson & The Miracles
The Vogues

...and on, and on. The only volume even slightly interesting is Volume 3, because of The Animals and Dusty Springfield. MPI Video has always been one of the worst......",1379203200,5,1051,4.801104972375691
5735041,4,B00CQRNM0A,"For fans of the 1965-1966 Hullabaloo show, MPI is bringing more great performances to dvd in a Best Of Hullabaloo series consisting of 4 separate dvd's available September 10th, 2013. In 2000 to 2002, MPI produced Hullabaloo Vols. 1-4, Hullabaloo Vols. 5-8 and Hullabaloo Vols. 9-12. In these older Volume sets, MPI included some of the Hullabaloo shows on dvd, all in their entirety. The film quality was not the greatest, but seeing the entire shows were fabulous! These Volume Sets from 2000-2002 are now priced out of most people's price range, so being able to purchase these new Best Of Hullabaloo 4 different sets may be a nice alternative.

I truly wish MPI would have made more of the Volume Sets, which include the Hullabaloo Shows in their entirety, instead of these 4 Best Of sets, but I'm happy with any of the old Hullabaloo performances, so I'll take what I can get. I heard the film quality is just like the older Volume Sets- not the greatest, but MPI is including 16-17 performances on each dvd and some fabulous bonus material. MPI always includes great bonus material when they can get it for their dvd's, and they did get some great interviews for these 4 Best Of dvd's. I did try and compare the performances on these Hullabaloo Best Of dvd's with my 2000-2002 Hullabaloo Volume dvd's, and I can only say I found maybe a couple duplicate performances. So, even if you own the Hullabaloo Vols. 1-4, Hullabaloo Vols. 5-8 and Hullabaloo Vols. 9-12, you will enjoy these Best Of performances, of which most are not included in the Volume Sets.

I will list the performances MPI is including in this Best Of Hullabaloo: 2, along with the Bonus Interview, so you can decide if you want it or if you want to compare it to the Volume Sets- if you own them. For the money, this is a great buy, but it is not what I wished for, which would have been a continuation of the Hullabaloo Volumes of the complete shows- only digitally remastered! I love seeing these old Hullabaloo performances again, but seeing the entire old shows with remastered film would have rated 5 Stars, instead of the 4 Stars I'm giving this dvd. The performances alone, the fabulous interview material and great price still rate 4 stars with me, as I know I'll still enjoy going back to 1965-1966 viewing these great stars again in their prime. Here is what you will find on this Best Of Hullabaloo: 2:

01.) George Hamilton- I Love Being Here With You
02.) Wayne Fontana & The Mindbenders- Game Of Love
03.) The Womenfolk- My Heart Tells Me To Believe
04.) Brenda Lee- Too Many Rivers
05.) Noel Harrison-Barbara Allen
06.) The Ronettes- Is This What I Get For Loving You?
07.) The Hollies- Yes I Will
08.) The Impressions- Woman Got Soul
09.) Top Pop Medley: The Ronettes-Silhouettes
10.) Wayne Fontana & The Mindbenders- Count Me In
11.) The Womenfolk- I'll Never Find Another You
12.) The Hollies, George Hamilton & Cast- I Know A Place
13.) The Everly Brothers & Steve Lawrence- All I Have To Do Is Dream
14.) Peter & Gordon- I Go To Pieces, My Babe, True Love Ways
15.) Peter & Gordon & Michael Landon- I'm Telling You Now
16.) Cannibal & The Headhunters- Land Of 1,000 Dances

8585078,4,B00CQRNM0A,"The BEST OF HULLABALOO COLLECTION 2 DVD is wonderful to watch and is hosted by a very young George Hamilton and features live performances by The Ronettes, The Hollies, The Impressions, Brenda Lee, Noel Harrison, The Womenfolk, and Wayne Fontana & The Mindbenders.

There's some other performance clips which I believe are from another show and they feature The Everly Brothers with Steve Lawrence, and Peter & Gordon with Michael Landon, and Cannibal & The Headhunters.

Picture quality is fair and it's shown in black and white and not in color as shown in the inset pictures on the DVD cover art. I think these are from the Kinescope copies of the HULLABULOO shows and are the only original masters that exist, so the picture quality can't be fixed beyond what is presented here. That's why I gave this DVD 4-stars. Even though the picture quality isn't the best it doesn't interfere with viewing pleasure.

The show starts with the opening jingle and the ""Hullabuloo dancers"" and is a hoot to watch. I wasn't alive back then, so I never saw the show as it was presented, so I can't comment on whether or not the format is the same. From what I've seen, the first 90% of this DVD is from one show.

Included is a special featurette that interviews one of the dancers!

  SPECIAL FEATURE
* Donna McKechnie Interview -- 19:43 min -- 2013
Present day interview with Hullabaloo dancer Donna McKechnie who talks about the show, filming live in front of an audience, the 60s, the hosts of ""Hullabaloo"" like Sammy Davis, Jr., and acts like Petula Clark, the Supremes and others. She also talks about famed and legendary Broadway choreographer Michael Bennett who was also a dancer on the show (who knew?) and what it was like working with him.

I hope that these interviews are featured on the other editions of the HULLABALOO DVDS because it brings insight into the show and the people on it. It would be interesting to know who the other dancers were and where did they end up, not to mention what was their experience like.

If you enjoy 60s music or are a history buff or just a fan of classic television shows, I would definitely recommend this DVD.",1402531200,,2150,4.636842105263158
8585079,5,B00CQRNM0A,"Remember when there was actually music that made some sense? Then this series is for you. A great addition to any
collection, and fan of music from the 60's....More shows in the future would be even nicer!",1387929600,,205,4.5675675675675675
8585080,5,B00CQRNM0A,I grew up with HULLABALOO and am THRILLED with all the sets that I purchased. They bring back so many great memories,1382400000,2,116,4.318181818181818
8585081,4,B00CQRNM0A,"Collection 2 of The Best of Hullabaloo is composed almost totally from the George Hamilton hosted April 27th '65 show, with 4 four clips from the April 13th and March 30th episodes added at the end. Included in this episode is the always fun, and sometimes bizarre Top Pop Medley, an enjoyable feature in many Hullabaloo episodes, where the guests would sing the popular hits of the day. Also included, which is a real bonus, is a nowadays interview with former Hullabaloo star dancer Donna McKechnie, with some fabulous memories and insights into the show. Well worth watching.

There might be some dissappointment from buyers who presume Hullabaloo was a rock Top 40 show. It never was. It was an attempt to showcase many artists of diverse styles, from rock and roll to pop, from marching bands to easy listening crooners. It was an interesting, original series, but perhaps this led to its cancellation. By trying to please everyone, perhaps it pleased few.

This DVD is composed totally of black & white kinescopes. Popular acts include Wayne Fontana & The Mindbenders, The Ronettes and The Hollies, as well as Brenda Lee, The Everlys and Peter & Gordon.  Hullabaloo Collection 2 is a fascinating disc, your passport back to a mid-60's primetime network musical variety show.",1379721600,2,1280,4.944186046511628
