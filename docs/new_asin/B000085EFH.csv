1827764,5,B000085EFH,"Ok lets take the movie at face value shall we. It's fictional and not a movie made for the theaters. With that in mind, it brings things into perspective a bit. I liked the first movie even though it was a little hokey. Over all the second intallment delivers all that the first one did and more. The effects are better, the story line is a little better and for the most part it's entertaining. Not an academy award winner for sure but I don't believe it was made to be. This is one of those movies that appeals to a smaller crowd. If your were/are a scout/sniper, then this move will seem stupid and a waste of your time. Possibly you can seperate reality from fantasy and enjoy it for it's simple story that makes the hero come out on top. Worth the time to watch.",1048896000,4,767,4.224489795918367
1827765,4,B000085EFH,"Sniper 2 is the sequel to Sniper made 10 years ago.  Tom Berenger returns as Master Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Beckett to take on a suicide mission.  Joining him is Bokeem Woodbine, a Death Row inmate, who serves as Beckett's spotter.  The two are sent to kill a general known to be taking part in ""ethnic cleansing.""
 This movie, while still good, does not reach the same level of the first one.  Something is missing in this.  The action is good as is Berenger as the quiet but deadly sniper lured out of retirement.  Woodbine is good as his partner, but Billy Zane was better.  Overall a good movie if you've seen the first one(several allusions to the first one are made).  Good performance by Berenger.

The first ""Sniper"" movie was a good film -- more of a character study than an action story. This sequel took on some of that same flavor as well, though there was sufficient action in the movie to keep it from being boring.
Tom Berenger reprises the original character (Becker) well. Somewhat anti-social grumpy but with deep feelings, Becker is an interesting and complex character. In this sequel, Becker is older, wider around the middle, but he still is a fabulous marksman (despite an injury that put him out of the sniper business after the first film). And so after years of retirement, he's called into service once again, on a foolhardy and convoluted mission.

Recommended for Tom Berenger fans.

1827799,1,B000085EFH,"This is not so much a review as a public health warning - this boring, unbelievable, poorly-written and -acted(??) rubbish should be avoided at, if you'll pardon the expression, gunpoint. On one of my favourite gripes; autos get hit by streetcars every day, but they don't explode in fireballs. I'd no idea that gasoline was so explosive. I think I'll give up driving.

I give this DVD only one star because I can't give it any lower. In fact, this movie truly merits the Teemacs Five Black Hole Award. I'll not be seeing ""3"".",1192838400,2,526,4.595744680851064

1827801,1,B000085EFH,"I was able to suspend my disbelief and enjoy Sniper [1] to some degree (the inflight ballistics were neat), but this sequel is beyond my capacity. The ""7.92mm German Mauser"" identified early in the film is clearly a Russian Mosin-Nagant. The stock, the single stack 5-round magazine extending below the stock, the bolt, the iron sights are ALL unmistakable.

Clearly this movie had no intention of appealing to anyone who knows anything about rifles or sniping. No military sniper would plan to engage a target at the rediculously close range of 200 meters. No sniper would trust a rifle handed to him without first verifying its zero. Even more laughable, Berenger is handed a scope for the Mosin-Nagant and presumably mounts it, but then proceeds to use it without zeroing it! And where would he shoot it to zero it while being hunted? He was better off just using the iron sights!

Sniper [1] was bad, but Sniper 2 is a complete waste of time.",1159315200,8,946,4.7272727272727275
1827802,1,B000085EFH,"I am a Bosnian,Croatian,and Serbian linguist, as is my wife.  We watched this movie and were trying to figure out which Eastern European country they were in.

If you are going to film a country in the Balkans, try using Bosnian, Serbian, or Croatian; especially if you are referring to Bosnia.

Total waste of time.....

1827805,2,B000085EFH,"Just when you forgot the first ""Sniper"" movie, you get a sequel starring the original star Tom Berenger.  I don't say the first one is a masterpiece, but still engaging because of the minute descriptions of the military snipers and their jobs, helped by flashy camera works  Instead of Billy Zane, you see Bookeem Woodbine, and beautiful Hungarian Erika Marozsan.
Tom Berenger's character Thomas Becket, now retired and 50 years-old, is lured back to the suicide mission to sneak into some unnamed Eastern Europe country, where a certain general is suspected leading a genocide plan.  To stop this, he and a guy from a Death Row is sent there.  With a help from ""Sofia"" they have to ""remove"" the target.
""Sniper 2"" is shot in Hungary, and shows some decent action scenes.  It tries to show some surprising twists in its rather simple plot; it also has the merit of Hungarian locales.
But the film is not good.  Tom Berenger and other cast give us convincing acting, but the story is often confusing.  The film goes back and forth between the two places -- American HQ and the European country -- and there is very little sense of suspence.  This is simply because we do not know what the heroes of the film want to do after the inital mission, which itself is not credible or exciting at all.  The ""surprise"" you see is just making the whole film worse, because we don't see the need of it.
I liked Erika Marozsan, who was stunning in little-seen film ""Gloomy Sunday"" and that's why I watched this film.  Here she is wasted, and when she exits from the story, she just goes, without any emotional impact.  She just leaves from the scene, as if going home for lunch.  It is incredible, but she really wanted to go home, being tire on the set.
And please.  What ever happened to Tom Berenger, Oscar nominee in ""The Platoon.""  I don't think it is a good move for him to do this kind of film, or a sequel no one remembers.  He is good even in this straight-to-video B-film, showing menace and charm at the same time.  He deserves a much better film.",1067558400,8,2045,4.5013550135501355
1827806,2,B000085EFH,"The original Sniper with Tom Berenger was a decent guy flick, and was a staple movie of my circle of friends during high school.  So, meeting up with a friend of mine from highschool, we decided to check out the sequel.  Sniper 2 finds Mr. Berenger reprising his role as Master Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Beckett.
Overall, the movie was pretty interesting, the plot far exceeding the latter Rambos.  Beckett is losing his skills as a sniper and gets put out to pasture, but then is recalled for a special assignment in the Balkans.
Flavors of the betrayal and the Dirty Dozen are thrown in with the underground resistence and the usual sniper fare.  The acting was varied, Berenger probably the most true to his hardass character.  Berenger meets his extreme match with a professorial character hell-bent on passive resistence whom he has to rescue.  The usual ""justified killer"" vs. ""justified pacifist"" banter ensues.
The ending duel was OK compared to the original, but the end acting was quite painful.
All in all, if you like Tom Berenger and/or the original Sniper, check this one out.  You may like it or hate, but it's still a decent military movie.",1057881600,2,1154,4.797979797979798
1827807,4,B000085EFH,"OK, maybe I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if I could. But ""Sniper II"" was really not bad at all. Yes, I had lowered expectations going in, (I'd read some lukewarm reviews), so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the film.
The first ""Sniper"" movie was also a good film -- more of a character study than an action story (in my opinion). This sequel took on some of that same flavor as well, though there was sufficient action in the movie to keep it from dragging.
Tom Berenger reprises the original character (Becker) well. Somewhat anti-social (shy, really), grumpy but with deep feelings, Becker is an interesting and complex character. In this sequel, Becker is older, wider around the middle, but he still is a fabulous marksman (despite an injury that put him out of the sniper business after the first film). And so after years of retirement, he's called into service once again, on a foolhardy and convoluted mission.
His interaction and relationship with the other man brought in on the mission is good -- like in the first movie, he often calls this younger man ""son"" as he argues and bickers (and looks out) for him. I thought Becker's character was consistent in both films, and I liked this. I liked Becker, and it was nice to see him yet again.
However, just like in the first film, there was a somewhat anti-climatic ending, (left me thinking, ""That's the end?"") but it was still adequate enough. I cared about all the characters, but a few left the story too soon, and I felt cheated because I didn't get to know more about them.
So, in my estimation, I saw this film as similar to the first: An older and wiser sniper is paired up with a younger (but this time, *very* able) partner, on a dangerous mission in a faraway land. They don't like each other at first, but end up forging a friendship by the end. It was a nice movie. Surely it could have been better, but I was not disappointed. It would be nice to see another installment to the ""Sniper"" movies, with a little meatier ending. I'd like that.",1049155200,16,2011,4.482288828337874
