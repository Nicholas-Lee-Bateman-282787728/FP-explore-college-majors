3716238,5,B001NFNFN0,"Okay, I honestly used to HATE working out. Really hate it. But I ordered The 30 day Shred from Jillian thinking that I could do something for twenty minutes for thirty days. Ten pounds later, I found that I looked forward to working out. I needed MORE. So Jillian delivered to me this and the ""no more trouble zone"" videos. They are like the 30 day Shred but longer and are either cardio or weight based. She keeps the energy high and gives, as always, excellent instructions on how to do the moves properly, so as to not become injured. I recommend this DVD for anyone who is fairly in shape and wants a difficult, addictive workout!

The only negative is the really cheesy music--Jillian, you seem so hip--what is up with that backbeat!?",1233964800,63,739,4.514925373134329
3716239,5,B001NFNFN0,"I did this workout for the first time this morning - OMG! - she kicked my butt big time. I was seriously gasping for air, but I loved it. It meant that I was burning calories. I highly suggest this workout.",1233878400,3,206,4.048780487804878
3716240,5,B001NFNFN0,"I just received this dvd today, and tried it. I did the entire dvd, with slight moderations because I am an intermediate/beginner. At the end I was a little sweaty, and felt like I had accomplished a decent workout. Jillian is very motivating through it. I was expecting a much harder workout, however without the moderations I made this would have been an even higher intensity workout. The nice thing is each move is not that tiring because it is only repeated a handful of times, then on to the next move. I recommend this video because you are working out without becoming so winded by excess repetitions.  I think you will like it if you want a calm high intensity workout. (Ironic I know)",1233792000,4,694,4.552
3716241,4,B001NFNFN0,"I really like this video, I purcased after using the 30day shred workout. I wish it was a combo of weights in this one.  I love the abs and legs circuit. I also like how she gives each exercise about 30 seconds, so you don't get bored or burnt out super quick.

3716242,5,B001NFNFN0,"Just received this DVD yesterday and couldn't wait to try it.  I've been using the 30 day shred for about 6 months and needed something new to make me break a sweat again.  This workout was hard, but moved quickly and the moves were not complicated.  Love Jillian's motivation as she progresses through the workout.  My legs are a little sore today, but can't wait to workout again with this DVD.  It is a little challenging, but once you're finished you feel great.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1233705600,13,496,4.579545454545454
3716243,5,B001NFNFN0,"I've been using the 30-Day Shred (as part of my larger overall workout routine) for a few months. I absolutely LOVE it and LOVE Jillian, so I was excited to hear about the new DVDs. I ordered this one, as well as 'No More Trouble Zones.' I should have them in a day or two. I found 'Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism' on Exercise TV last night and tried it. Wow! A GREAT workout! I love Jillian's 'Personal Trainer' style. I much prefer her style of workout over the more 'dancy' stuff that's out there.",1233705600,5,498,4.308510638297872

This dvd is as close as im gonna get. I got this dvd and right away put it in the dvd player. Jillian kicks your butt, but i know if i stick to it, i will see results. jillian has proven time and time again that she can help people get into shape. buy this dvd if you are serious about getting into shape. i bought all three of her dvds!",1233619200,5,504,3.855769230769231
3716245,5,B001NFNFN0,"I have all of the non-BL Jillian Michaels workout dvds and was thrilled that my UPS guys beat the snow to deliver this new addition today. It does not disappoint!

Here's the skinny: 7 six minute circuits, no weights, no equipment. Just you and some free space to jump around (you don't even need that much space; trust me, I live in a tiny NYC apartment and am completely able to do all the exercises). Each circuit is made up of a set of exercises performed twice before moving on to the next circuit: full body engagement, plyometrics and some serious core work mid-way through. But the focus is really on getting your heart rate up and Jillian delivers (my husband walked in after I was done and said he'd never seen my face so red before -- so beware! It's a tough enough workout that you might not look stunning immediately after; you can save the stunning for the beach this summer!)

Now, I should mention I have done JM's 30 Day Shred and love love love love it. There's no better way to get in a thorough workout in 22 minutes. This is not The Shred.  There are many familiar exercises, but it's a much longer workout and the intensity is modulated to make it possible to keep going for the full 45+ minutes of the workout. I was intent on getting through the whole workout, so I can't speak to what the experience would be like for a beginner. But, the dvd is broken into chapters that split at each circuit, so theoretically, you can progressively build up as your stamina increases. I imagine I will have days when I'm pressed for time and just want to hit 3-4 of the circuits, and the chapters are designed to allow me to pick the ones I most like (or hate! depending on how tough they are!)

Also, I find Jillian's style to be increasingly more mature with each new dvd. No joke, she's a tough cookie -- that hasn't changed. But her instruction is more precise and her explanations of why certain exercises are paired together is really helpful. I find that knowing why things are good for me (even when they're so hard) is powerful motivation. Oh, I should mention I have very bad asthma and doing these workouts has helped boost my heart strength and capacity to grab more air with each breath. It's silly, I know, but I finish feeling like Mighty Mouse!

I'll update in the comments section with any thoughts or problems I encounter as I incorporate this workout into my regular schedule. But in the meantime, I'm a very happy customer!",1233619200,"1,339",2454,4.456570155902004
3716246,4,B001NFNFN0,"I have tried Jillian's ""How to Win by Losing"" series, the ""30-day shred"", and now this workout video. It wasn't disappointing by any means, and the nice thing about this video is that you don't need weights to do it. You would think that after Jillian has made so many workout videos she would start repeating a lot of the exercises, but this workout still has a great variety of exercises (some new and old) and leaves you sweating and tired at the end of it. And, as always, Jillian encourages you through the end of it, leaving you feeling accomplished and empowered!",1233619200,31,570,4.543689320388349
3716247,4,B001NFNFN0,"I just tried Jillian's new workout Banish the Fat Boost Your Metabolism and I have to say I like it. I am a member on her blog and have been using the Shred 30 Program for a little over two months and I have lost a total of 29 pounds.  I was worried about hitting a plateau so I was excited to see the release of two new dvds. The DVD willnot be released until tomorrow, Feb. 3, but it is available today on exercise TV/Comcast Digitial Cable. It is an hour workout with a phenomenal warm up and cool down. She does about 6-7 circuits of cardio intense exercises (that can be modified) and you repeat the exercises twice in each circuit. I felt challlenged and really good after I got done with it. When I first started I said, ""I'm in over my head"", but soon discovered she gives you adequate rest between the sets by alternating a really tough set with a more moderate set to get a little bit of recovery. Jillian Michaels is at the top of her game and gives you the results you want to see. Not only did I lose 29 pounds but I also lost about 17 inches all over. I do follow a regimented diet (as she recommends on her website) but it is priceless to be able to workout for a week and see the kindof results she gives. I highly recommend this for anyone who is serious about getting in shape and needs pragmatic no nonsense, just do what needs to be done, outlook on fitness. Jillian Delivers that and more. I will post an amended post to update my progress. Best of Luck to everyone. Buy the DVD its worth it.",1233532800,184,1513,4.14625850340136

3716270,4,B001NFNFN0,"I like Jillian's circuit approach to her workouts.  She does each circuit 2 times, so you aren't stuck doing the same moves over and over.  The one circuit I didn't care for was the abs focused one.  She does the mountain climber, followed by superman poses, then ab crunches and some strange oblique move that was just plain awkward.  I didn't do the superman or the awkward oblique one and substituted with another exercise.  I felt these two exercises did not keep my heart rate up.  That being said, I did like the rest of the circuits and worked up a sweat.  I feel like Jillian's workouts fly by, and this one did as well. My favorite of her workouts in the new Killer Cardio, but I will keep this in the rotation. This one is about 50 minutes including the warm up and cool down.",1508976000,2,786,4.342465753424658

3716272,5,B001NFNFN0,Lost 10 lb in a month with using this about 2-3 times a week with minimal dieting. Last time I used JM I lost 15 lb in a month. Was frustrated I wasn't seeing more progress as the gym so switched back to this. Love it and the results! You can also customize your workout by playing specific circuits if you don't want or have time for the whole workout. I also modify the high impact parts with other low impact moves she uses so it really can work for anyone.,1507075200,,460,4.065934065934066

3716289,5,B001NFNFN0,"I shop on Amazon a TON, rarely write reviews.  I'm going to for this video because I'm so pleased!  I started my weight loss journey about 6 months ago after back to back babies (3 in all).  I've always been a runner so I was doing that intitially.  Running 2.5 miles easy.... no results.  Decided, ok, time to switch it up.  Gave this video a try and BOOM.  Weight started falling off.  Sometimes 3 pounds a week!  While eating really clean and healthy.  It's crazy to me that you can get this great of a workout with no equipment and very little space needed.  My friends and family are in awe at how my body has transformed so quickly.  This video was very well thought through. Cardio, strength building, and toning moves.  Some circuits are a bit harder and then the next may be a bit easier.  I like the natural pauses that occur in circuit training which allows me to stop if need be to tend to my kids.  This workout is very challenging.  I'd say you'd want to be intermediate level to do this video but she does offer modifications throughout.  I'm always DRIPPING sweat at the end!",1501459200,9,1091,4.375

3716318,5,B001NFNFN0,"This is exactly what I was looking for.  I have been burnt out on videos and due to a hip issue unable to run/jog for cardio.  I allowed myself to get very out of shape over the last two years. The majority of the new videos I was interested in at my level focus too much on strength training. They were cardio, but focused more on muscle strengthening, which cause me to bulk up, not slim down.  I need and swear by focusing on cardio while incorporating strength moves.  Not the other way around.  I'm going for trim and tone.  I needed something to speed up my metabolism and to do that you really need to focus on cardio.  This video does just that.  And just like all of Jillians videos, you get out of this video what you put into it.  If its too easy for you, you aren't jumping high enough, you aren't punching hard enough, you aren't pushing hard enough.  You can always give more, and if you are it will work and there is no way you won't feel tired..  On the flip side if its too tough or exhausting, you can take it down to the level you need.  Even a level lower than her modifications.  If you need to replace a jump with a step, do it.  Modify it how you need to get through it and work towards building up.  I cant do this all the way through, I have to take breaks or modify.  Like I said I'm out of shape but can easily go outside and take a 4-5 mile jog without needing to stop.  This video leaves me breathless, and sweaty, but afterwards I recover quickly and don't feel spent for the day or wiped out. Anyhow this video does lots of jumping, Lots. Of. Jumping. Its tiring but it works. Bonus it doesnt bother my knees ankles or hips.  She also incorporates modified kickboxing moves, punches for arms and abs, burpees modified lunges squats moguls (breathless) and in typical jillian michaels style, she does each of them in a circuit repeated twice.  So when you get to a circuit you hate, you know its almost over. She does this video using a sort of HIIT style, or what i call intervals. Bring the heart rate up, then bring it down, repeat. This is so important in raising the metabolism.  This is a  Metabolism boosting, whole body workout that is going to help you slim down and not build but still tone your whole body. I love it. I haven't found a video I absolutely love in a very very long time, and I've bought  A LOT of videos.  This is what I was looking for.  I'm so excited I can get the level of cardio I needed while i cant run. I've only been using it a week and I can already see the results.  Abs are tight, arms and legs are seriously toning, I'm sliding my pants on easier. and I swear my butt is perkier!! Im not sure if I've lost weight or inches, but I'm toning, I can see it, I feel good and i really just needed to get rid of the flab and that tired/sluggish feeling, AND ITS WORKING.  This is it.",1496707200,14,2845,4.145985401459854

3716320,5,B001NFNFN0,"This gets 5 stars because the endurance and stamina built by doing Jillian is unmatched by any other videos in this price range.

It's hard for me to regularly stick with this because I get too annoyed with the coaching and video cuts. Sometimes, she'll stop exercising to talk about the moves (not too uncommon, and can be helpful) but then she'll go off on a lecture about ""doing this for you"" and ""you are so much stronger than you know"", all while the camera zooms on her (who isn't exercising) and you're literally trying to complete some seriously intense high-impact move. It's a very distracting time for a long, heartfelt pep talk. I'd prefer a simple ""keep it up!"" ""push through"" or ""15 more!""

Sometimes she makes fun of her exercisers and at one point does a ""false start"" on one of the moves to mess with her girls. I'm sure this was hilarious on set that day, but it's super annoying when you're listening to the workout every day.

The obvious cuts after EACH 6 minute circuit is another distraction that interrupts my motivation and makes it easy to quit after a few circuits. I personally prefer workouts that flow more smoothly -- they're easier to stick with, IMO.

So yeah, not my favorite style, but she kicks your butt and really knows her stuff. Simple exercises, but effective and intense. Love it for what it does, and will always fall back on it. AND, you can easily memorize or write down the circuits and do it to your own music.

3716326,5,B001NFNFN0,"I have have been off my work-out game for several months; mainly due to winter making it difficult to head to and from my gym regularly. I was skeptical of taking up an at-home routine since I assumed I would need a lot of space in front of a TV or monitor to perform the moves correctly. I found with this work-out, I basically needed only the space as long and wide as an average yoga mat, which for my small apartment, is a great relief.
I've read some reviews that stated that most of the moves are too advanced, but as I worked my way through for the first time, and being quite out of shape doing it, I was happy for Michael's beginner's level suggestions with each move in the circuit. Though I was not able to perform all moves and stretches at the speed and intensity that she could, I was able to complete the entire work-out and felt like I got a decent amount of cardio and muscle conditioning. It was an invigorating exercise that didn't leave me feeling completely winded or overwhelmed, like many other work-out programs I've looked at.  Here, Michaels comes off as friendly and enthusiastic, but I like that her direct, no-nonsense attitude throughout the session doesn't inspire the kind of nausea that I normally feel with uber-fitness personalities. Basically, you want to advance to her level of fitness, but this video won't humiliate or annoy as you work up to that goal.
I think I will be able to stick with this one as a helpful beginner's guide. Glad I found it.",1488240000,6,1487,4.487084870848708

3716373,5,B001NFNFN0,"I've been using this video for years. It's perfect for the days when I don't want to go to the gym, or for when I'm traveling. I've done it in hotel rooms all around the world and it never lets me down, although I'd recommend getting a ground or first floor room so you don't disturb the people below you  when you do the jumping and jogging moves. As a long-time cardio addict, this is one of the only pure cardio videos that I've found that is hard enough to get my heart rate up into my target zone. Last year I developed a medical condition and had to significantly scale back my exercise intensity, so I was very pleased to find that by modifying the moves to low or no impact, I could adapt this workout to a much lower intensity level. It's pretty rare to find a video that is versatile enough to be used by both beginners and advanced exercisers, but that's exactly what you'll find with this workout. The only negative is the music, which is definitely not to my taste, but I just set the volume just loud enough that I can still hear the words, but then crank up my own music and work out to that.

3716374,5,B001NFNFN0,"I do a lot of exercise.  I run, I do p90x, pilates, I hit up the gym.....but somedays I like to do a nice circuit training that isn't part of a larger series.  Jillian Michals Banish Fat Boost Metabolism fits that bill.  It's a fun workout that really works different areas of your body.  The first circuit is a nice warmup....circuit two will make your legs feel like they are on fire - lots of plyo moves and squats and that is quickly followed by your typical calisthenics circuit (butt kicks, jumping jacks, high knees).  All in all there are seven circuits.  The video claims to be only 40 minutes long but I find that this workout and cool down is closer to an hour.  On days where I have time, I pair this with No More Trouble Zones with Jillian Michaels.  That one is more strength training/weights so it is a nice one to pair with a cardio workout like this.  I feel like this workout goes by fairly quickly.  Just when you think you can't do anymore, you get a little ""break"" in the next circuit which makes it manageable.  There are modified moves for some of the more intense exercises and if it gets to be too much there's always the pause button.  Being in good shape when I started this workout, I can't say how a beginner might handle this...it's pretty intense...my legs are screaming after circuit 2 and 6....but it IS doable.  Each circuit consists of about 5 exercises...each are about 30 seconds each and then it is repeated.  If you find yourself struggling just remember that the exercise is only 30 seconds.",1481760000,10,1531,4.460431654676259

I gave up on the gym a few years ago when I realized that it was causing me more aggravation and stress trying to fight 5 o'clock traffic to get there and then stand in line for a machine than it was helping. I had purchased this particular DVD years prior and had forgotten all about it until recently. I use a Wahoo chest strap heart rate monitor and this workout consistently gets my heart rate up higher and I burn more calories than with any other workout DVD I own (lookin' at you, Bob Harper). The workout is about 54 minutes from warm up to cool down but you can pick and choose which circuits you want to do if you're short on time or just starting out. It is a *tough* workout so if you're a beginner, I'd say don't expect to get through every minute of every circuit. All of the circuits are primarily cardio though there are some strength moves just using body weight (ie you don't need equipment, other than maybe a mat depending on your flooring). Jillian gives modifications and does a decent job at discussing form to avoid injury. If I could only have one workout DVD, this would be it.",1476403200,5,1147,4.314814814814815

3716487,5,B001NFNFN0,"I have actually been working out to this DVD pretty faithfully since September 2013, but sadly, I have always put off writing a much deserved review for it.  Since July 1 is my ""exercise anniversary"" though, I thought today would finally be a fitting day, as today marks 3 years of working out with Jillian! ;)

My first Jillian DVD was her famous ""30 Day Shred"" (BTW, check out my review of it, if interested!) and I was so impressed with the results I derived from it after that first month, I decided to check out her other DVDs.  This time, however, I wanted something that focused on cardio, as I wanted to further boost my results!

After doing some research online, I got this DVD, ""Banish Fat Boost Metabolism"" aka BFBM, because a lot of other reviewers praised it.  They talked about how it boosted their results, how this is a great option for a longer workout, etc.  The one review that got my attention, however, was one where someone stated that they knew someone who lost 100 lbs. with this DVD alone-wow!

I am not going to go into the details of the actual exercises, as I am sure previous reviews have already done so.  I will state that this DVD is conveniently broken up into seven circuits that can be done separately or as a full workout, which gives you the option to split it up if you're short on time or just want to add some extra cardio to another workout! It also states that this is a 40 minute workout but the whole routine is actually 55 minutes if you factor in the warm up and cool down, but believe me, this is time well spent!

You know that Jillian means business when she states, ""If you want to lose the weight, you've come to the right place!"" during the intro.  She does an awesome job here, as she skillfully creates a great sequence of the seven circuits.  For example, the first circuit seems easy at first, but it's only to prepare you for the second and subsequent circuits.  The final circuit seems like a ""break"" as it too seems easier than previous circuits; Jillian knows that you're likely beat by then but keeps you moving all the same with moves like standing crunches and jump rope! I also agree with previous reviewers that the second and sixth circuits are the hardest! As always, Jillian is funny and motivational here, as she jokingly tells Saleema to ""shake it with what her mama"" gave her and not to ""phone it in, and finish strong"" at the end.

In conclusion, I seriously feel that this DVD is a must for all fitness enthusiasts! Even though it's now been close to 3 years since I have been using it, I never get bored of it and tend to use it at least once per week in my rotation of Jillian DVDs (I strive to work out 4-6 days per week).  It really has boosted my results and because of Jillian, I have lost 40 lbs. over the past 3 years! Nowadays, I add weights to some of the exercises to up the ante because as Jillian has often stated, ""add more resistance if it's too easy for you!"".  Thus, this DVD still challenges me to this day, as I still have to take a mini-break after the fourth circuit for some water, tbh! BTW, ""No More Trouble Zones"" aka NMTZ, is the strength counterpart to this workout, and I love it too! People are often surprised that I don't need a gym membership for such incredible results!",1467331200,10,3276,4.35632183908046

Great workout I can do super early in the morning, rain or shine, in the comfort of my home, without dragging kids out of bed, etc. I actually watched it quite a few times on you tube and then bought through Amazon. I have to say I'm disappointed in Amazon video so far. The two Jillian Michaels workouts that I downloaded seem to cut in and out with the audio, and are just a little fuzzy in the picture. Still serves it's purpose, but disappointed that once I paid for it that it is now a lower quality picture. :( Love Jollian's workouts though!!",1466035200,2,597,4.292035398230088
3716494,4,B001NFNFN0,"My skill level: I am pretty good about doing a home workout DVD about 5-6 times a week. I have tried several of Jillian's programs, several in The Firm series, more Beachbody programs than I care to admit, and a few random ones for good measure (Billy Blanks, prenatal workouts, and a few Bellydance). That being said, I am not athletic. I hate working out but do so because it is the healthy thing to do. I would classify my level as ""lower level advanced"". I am certainly not a beginner but by no means am I a super toned athlete.

As a way to kind of organize my own DVD collection, I wanted to go through and rate them all so I can quickly grab exactly the kind of workout I am looking for that day, rather than try to think ""hmm, is this the good ab one or the good thigh one?"". Posting them here on Amazon for all to benefit from. Here goes:

Time: Warm-up and Cool down are 5 minutes each, Workout is 43 min for a total time of 53 minutes.

Skill Level: If you do each workout exactly as stated, it is a lower-intermediate workout. That being said, many of the workouts could be modified to be harder by adding weights or doubling up on reps.

Equipment: No equipment needed, unless you want to make the workout harder, in which case a pair of 3-5lb dumbbells would be great.

Breaks: Though the workout itself is 43 minutes, you are not going at max intensity the whole time. You have slight breaks as she demonstrates each workout. Which, given the huge number of different moves amounts to quite a lot of standing around/catching your breath.

Format: 7 circuits at about 6 minutes each. Each circuit has 4/5 moves and repeats twice. This is not the same circuit format Jillian sometimes uses with the 3-2-1 method (3 minutes of cadrio, 2 minutes of strength, 1 minute of abs). Here is a breakdown of the circuits (these were the notes I took during the workout):
1- Low impact, easy moves to ease you into the workout
2- #thighs get a workout here. A little bit of jumping to pick up the intensity a notch
3- Cardio! (with an ab move at the end)
4- All about abs
5- Kickboxing- kicks and punches. This is a great opportunity to add weights/double up on reps if you are thinking it is too easy
6- Plyo and jumping- the second time through this circuit was the first time I really started to huff and puff.
7- A little jumping with some full bodied ab work. Not the hardest circuit but nice to have just before heading into the cooldown.

Overall, I was a little surprised at how easy it was compared to some of her other workouts. I did feel like I got a good workout in by the end, but no moreso than when I do either a T25 of 22MHC workout (both Beachbody programs) and those are much shorter. The pace in this one just seemed to be really slow. Next time, I will add 3lb weights to see how that alters things. Not super high impact so its easy on the knees.",1465862400,,2870,4.255045871559633

As far as the workout, I like that this one doesn't require any weights or equipment, which makes it even easier to do anywhere, anytime.
Everyone is familiar with Jillian by now, and this video is no different from any of her others as far as her personality. She's a little gruff for me, but not unlikeable.

3716549,3,B001NFNFN0,"I should start off by saying I'm not a Jillian Michaels fan. I don't like her voice, attitude, style. But her workouts get decently high reviews, so I tried them.

This one is a good workout. It's longer, but it does have a variety of moves and I like the traditional cardio/calisthenics mixed with the kick boxing moves. She has a warm up, then goes into 6 circuits that she repeats once before moving on to the next circuit, then a cool down. I think the disc is about 55 min total. The circuits consist of a move (high knees, jab/cross combo, side kick, plank/spider plank, etc) that you do for about 25 seconds, then about 5-10 seconds of rest as you go ""right into"" the next move. There are probably 6 moves per circuit and then you repeat the circuit. After doing the circuit twice, you move on to the next circuit. It does get your heart rate up and the variety of moves is good.

What I don't like:
I always find her talking kind of annoying because she acts like the moves are impossible or like she's not taking a break, when she takes a short break after each move. This is probably because I just don't like her as an instructor. She comes across as arrogant and talks down to the viewer, yet doesn't give many (any?) helpful info or tips on form.
I think she often goes too slowly through the moves for my taste. Her jab-cross-hook-elbow combo is almost in slow-mo. Of course, each individual can always workout at their own pace and there is nothing preventing me from speeding up during the times she's dragging.
The warm up is pretty tame and doesn't warm you up much for the cardio.
The music is awful. Like maybe you're in a bar for seniors who ""still got it"" and tap their toes to the easy listening tunes while sipping cocktails. And none of the moves are performed on beat.
There is an option to view without Jillian's instruction, and I thought I'd try that since her instruction drives me mad. But it's just that horrible music with no cueing. And since there is no ticker across the bottom or anything like that, there isn't a way to anticipate or stop unless you're glued to the screen.

The bottom line:
I feel like I can get the same or better workout from other mixed cardio DVDs (pretty much any 30+ min HiiT workout would be about right), but I would enjoy it a heck of a lot more with instructors I like better (Cathe F, Shawn T, Autumn Calabrese, Les Mills...). So I got rid of this one. If you like Jillian, I bet this would be a great choice for you.",1461369600,2,2484,4.32618025751073

I love to run, but unfortunately I keep getting plantar fascia, which is very pain full. So I decided to give Jillian a shot. I personally love these workouts.

I consider myself at an intermediate level, because I thought that much of the Beginner Shred was fairly easy.  But, I think maybe I should have then moved on the regular 30 Day Shred program before moving on to this program.  The first time I tried to complete this DVD, I only made it to the fifth set before I had to surrender.  And, boy was I sore the next day!!!  Thankfully I didn't start with this program, or else I would have been way too out of shape and unprepared for it.  This workout is intense.  There's barely a chance in any of the sets to catch your breath for more than about 5 seconds.  Even the ladies helping Jillian make this video appear out of breath and sweaty after the first few sets.  And they are probably in the best shape of their lives.  My plan is to make my way through this program incrementally, by maybe starting with the first 4 sets for a few days, and then add another set every week until I can do the entire program without feeling like I might die!  I definitely think I will reach my goals for weight loss and body transformation with this program.  How could anyone not shred fat if they do this even a few times a week!  I recommend this DVD, but warn you that if you aren't at least at an intermediate level of fitness already, then you may want to start elsewhere before you attempt this one.",1449532800,38,1446,4.268382352941177

I still work up a big sweat, and I still feel satisfied when I'm done. It's one of the best cardio workouts you will get. The moves broken down individually are not so hard on their own, but combine them together in a workout, and you've got a cardio blast. I will always keep this workout with me. It's my go-to workout and the reason I got motivated to workout to start with. Thank you Jillian for all you've done.

First is that there is too much of a swing between the very intense cardio portions and the kickboxing portions - the cardio portions were SUPER intense, while I felt like I barely got any workout during the kickboxing ones. I think this made my heart rate go up way too high and crash too low over the course of 55 minutes. Second, there isn't enough instruction with the kickboxing portions. During a lot of the punches and kicks I felt like I was jerking my muscles in an unhealthy way - more pulling than strengthening. I gather this shouldn't be the case, but I'm not sure what I was doing wrong. All that said, this could be a good choice when you don't have any weights handy, or if you just want to do the cardio and ab portions with shorter recovery breaks in between.",1442793600,2,950,4.283333333333333

There is a core circuit in the middle so you get some ab toning as well.  I would rate this as intermediate level with the ability to make it advanced by using the harder modifications.  Before I did the 30-day Shred for several months I was unable to get past the first few circuits of this workout, but now I alternate this entire DVD (for cardio) with No More Trouble Zones (for strength) for a total of 4 workouts per week.

This is by far my favorite workout by her and my favorite ever, and I own most of her fitness library.",1438041600,3,479,4.173913043478261

3716725,4,B001NFNFN0,"I was looking for a new cardio DVD to replace some others in my collection that I have become bored of. This is my first Jillian workout and now I feel hooked on her methods and instruction. Jillian appears ""less tough as nails"" here and gently encourages you through the workout while still pushing you to your capacity. She appears ""real"" unlike how she comes across on TV (at least to me). There is a 5 minute warm up, 6 (?) circuit rounds of cardio and then a short cool down / stretch. No equipment is needed and you only need a small amount of space. I was definitely sweating and pushing through this workout; only modified 2 moves for lower impact / intensity. I only give it 4 stars because most of her other DVDs have multiple workouts for the same (or less) price. I can't wait to do more of her workouts!",1436572800,2,816,4.305194805194805
3716726,5,B001NFNFN0,"This is a very well paced and challenging cardio circuit workout. BFBM is doable for beginners and versatile enough to challenge anyone more advanced.  Modifying speed and range of motion, even adding weights to some parts, you could definitely use this going forward as you get stronger.  I think circuit 2 and 6 are the worst.  I enjoy the kickboxing circuits most, followed by old school calisthetics.  I love that the moves are simple in this.  Jillians newer releases seem to be full of weird moves that she invented because she doesnt want to repeat from previous workouts.  This is straight forward.  I like the ab circuit despite the fact it offers very little relief in the way of recovery :)
Little tip: this is a Great DVD for  adding extra cardio when doing 30 day shred or Ripped in 30. I currently do warmup & circuits 1-3 as my warm up/added cardio BEFORE I do Ripped in 30. This has helped me lose the extra pounds  ripped wasn't getting rid of on its own. NMTZ is also wonderful and I have done both on the same day but best to alternate.  this dvd does offer some toning becasue of planks, leg raises etc.  It's definitely top 5 of all time.",1436572800,2,1159,4.4454976303317535

I then moved on to the 30 day shred which really kicked my butt into gear .. Once i reached level 3 and was able to complete it with ease i moved on to this DVD as well as the no more trouble zones as these two dvds work hand in hand. When jillian says these are not your mothers workouts she means it!! This dvd is fast past very aerobic and your heart will be pumping and you will sweat ALOT but i have never felt better . My body has changed so much in the past 4 months I have lost a total of 40lbs which i contribute a lot to her and following a healthy eating plan (food is key). Ive flattened my tummy, my arms and legs are noticeably stronger and im starting to lose those embarrassing back rolls ive obtained from pregnancy weight and Ive went down 2 pant sizes!! I can not tell you enough how much i love these 45 min workouts . I highly recommend this dvd as well as the others i mentioned and if you are a beginner like I was you should start slower and work up to this workout, You will be amazed at what your body is capable of achieving!!

I own three of her DVDs and after my 3rd baby, I wanted something I could do at home while baby naps. I particularly love this DVD. You don't need weights but you use your own body weight, and you really sweat if you follow along. I love how she offers modifications for begginners too. I was 140 pounds 6 weeks post-partum and I lost about 5 pounds the first month of trying Jillian 2 to 3 times a week with very little diet changes. Now that I have seen the results also in pants size, I am more into working out 4-5 times a week and have noticed how my body keeps changing.

3716809,5,B001NFNFN0,"I've never really taken to Jillian.  I've been a Bob fan from the beginning when I started doing the Biggest Loser DVDs.  I'd skip over Jillian's section every time.  I was surprised by this one though, I found myself loving it.  You can find details about each circuit in the other reviews but I'll say I still consider myself a beginner.  I've never worked out much and just started July 2014. I started with the elliptical and bike and slowly started incorporating strength training and in home DVDs. I am a fan of the Fitness Blender workouts you can find for free on Youtube and purposely ignored this work out for months.  Glad I finally did it.  I work out with my husband who is a 6ft, high 200s guys and he's been working out his entire life it seems. This video worked him and I was glad to see it wasn't just me struggling.

I have knee pain and try hard to find workouts that go easier on the knees so this one, even with the plyometric moves, were not nearly as hard on the knees.  I also like that she's not in a constant state of active rest when she finishes an exercise and circuit...I mean, seriously, I know we have to keep that heart rate up but I'd much rather die in the middle of an activity like eating :)  50 minutes is a lot to be moving at such a high intensity consistently but this goes by rather quickly.  I did the entire thing the first time through and yes, the sweat is real.  I needed 4 bottles of water to feel like I was re-hydrated after that workout.

Okay Jillian, you have me back in your camp...but I'll run back into Bob's arms in a minute if this doesn't get easier.",1425254400,5,1610,4.222222222222222

Being a broke student at the time , I only owned three workout dvds this one included , and a laptop to play them .  I committed to this workout 3-4 days a week and her 30 day shred on the last. I am not kidding this is the best most extreme and effective  dvd that cuts the weight quick while giving you a great total body tone up.  I could not believe how quickly I was beginning to drop the lbs..I started this workout at the beggining of  june and by late august I lost 25 lbs and had defined muscle tone . if you want the results this dvd is a miracle worker and 3 years later after doing about every workout dvd program you can think of , nothing tops this masterpiece and . I still do it once a week to jumpstart the week right.

(With eating healthier) I got bored so I decided to try out some of Jillian Michaels DVD's. This one is one of my favorites. Since incorporating this DVD into my routine each week I have lost over 45 pounds since August 2014. It is a nice change and you really SWEAT! Some of the moves I couldn't do right away, like for instance the squat jumps, but after about a month I can! It hurts but no pain no gain I guess! It really does work the muscles by using your own body weight. Some people say that they don't like Jillian's workout videos because she doesn't do the workout with you. She does in the beginning but she has two other people doing the workouts and she stops to show/tell you how to do the workout right so you don't hurt yourself. She is a trainer, so that's why she doesn't do every move as long as you do. I like that she stops to talk about each move and exactly how to do it right so I don't sprain my ankle or something!

I wear my HRM and most of the time I stay in zone 4 or 5 during the workout and burn huge amount of calories. I have owned it for 6 years now but I still love it. Jillian appears very natural and all moves are in original form. In most of her new DVDs in order to bring new flavor to exercises she tries to jumble things up which in turn lose their real flavor. In short, if you want to own only a few of Jillian's workouts then this one is a must-have.",1419206400,4,585,3.9243697478991595

I have a stationary bike at home, which is OK, but again, boring.  This DVD kicks your butt!  I can only make it through the first 5 circuits safely at this point.  I love mixing this up with weight lifting a couple times a week.  I'm not a huge fan of every single plyometric move, especially the ones toward the last couple circuits but, you can always change them up to suit your needs.  I love that you can get a great workout by doing just a few circuits at a time, especially if your short on time.  Super challenging DVD and I am I would say I am at an intermediate level when it comes to fitness (working out for 13 years consistently) !  This is my favorite Jillian Michaels DVD.  I prefer other DVDs for weight lifting and body weight workouts, such as Cathe, Kelly Coffey-Meyer, Pauline  Nordin (for the best butt workout ever!) and Mark Lauren.",1417132800,4,982,4.34065934065934

It seems like her back up girls aren't even sweating or breathing heavy, but I don't pay too much attention to them anyway, because I'm concentrating on what I'm doing. By now, I know most of it by heart anyway. The only thing I hate is that at the end of the 2nd circuit, Jillian says, ""We're not even close to halfway through this."" It's just always bothered me that she says that. It's like, ""Is that supposed to motivate me to keep going?"" Also, circuit 6 is, in my opinion, the most difficult. And maybe others can attest to this, but I think Michael Meyers Halloween music is playing in the background. Overall, great workout. You can do the whole video or pick and choose certain circuits.

I usually prefer strength training over cardio, so I was surprised that I actually enjoy Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism.  There is plenty of variety within the seven circuits including kickboxing, plyometrics, ab work and calisthenics.  Although there are no weights involved, you are still strengthening your muscles.  Jillian pushes you hard, but then allows some recovery time with movements that don't tax your heart.

By the time I get to circuits six and seven, Im usually afraid I might not finish, but I push through somehow.  At 55 minutes, this workout is long.  Right now, I can only fit it in once a week.  As other reviewers have mentioned, you could choose which circuits you want to complete and make the workout shorter, which would be great for beginners.  Id recommend that beginners work up to the plyometric (jump training) moves.  However, if you are really out of shape, I recommend that you start with Jillians Body Revolution.

I have been doing Ripped and TB&T back to back for a few weeks now and already see results. I decided to add some Cardio to my regimen to get some good conditioning and burn more calories.

Boy does this deliver! It is awesomely brutal! 50+ minutes of heart pounding, sweat dripping work. No equipment needed! It doesn't require any space to run. I can do it in the living room of my 3rd floor apt. Twenty minutes in, I was begging her to stop. By minute 40, I was determined to finish. I find I can do almost all the exercises. I skip Burpees and Mountain climbers. I tried them in Ripped and they aggravated an existing condition. I find that I loved the 180's, skaters (modified here from the tougher version in Ripped)

I find myself laughing sometimes at certain moments but also rallying and pushing myself harder than I thought I could at others. I get the feeling like we're all in it together.

There are lots of moves, but they're fairly simple. Their difficulty comes especially with the repetition with only short breaks in between (which makes me feel like I'm getting the most for my time).

3716992,5,B001NFNFN0,"Not that this DVD needs more 5-star reviews, but after 3+ years of using this I figured I should add my vote.  I started with the 30-day Shred (which I completed in about 60 days), and then added this and No More Trouble Zones.  For the past year or so, I've just been using this video exclusively.  Since starting the exercise program, I've lost 35 pounds and I've had no trouble maintaining that weight for the past year.

One of the great things about this disc is that even though the full workout would be about 50 minutes, each circuit repeats so you can complete the workout in 25 minutes if you only do each circuit once.  I only have a limited amount of time in the morning, so that's all I can do.  And even with just half a workout, I can still maintain my weight (along with indulging in desserts).  This is a great cardio workout with lots of plyometrics.  My metabolism has definitely increased on this program.",1408924800,6,925,4.4

3716999,4,B001NFNFN0,"I love to exercise and love discovering new workouts, but this is one of the ones I always find myself coming back to. With this DVD, Jillian Michaels created a really effective and empowering cardio conditioning routine -- at a perfect (and relatively fast-paced) 45-ish minutes. I like every circuit in this workout, but the second one is my favorite: the burpee-to-pli hop combination is killer, and I've done ballet for years. :) I highly recommend this DVD to anyone.",1408492800,,472,4.9125

3717003,4,B001NFNFN0,I love it!  It s so easy to follow.  Jillians approach is fun to watch.  Everything (the sets of movements) are repeated twice.  It allows me to do better the second time around. Tips are offered for more challenging movements.  I didn't give it a five-star rating because there are not enough suggestions for lower impact movements.,1408406400,,333,4.771929824561403

3717029,5,B001NFNFN0,"I know there are many reviews out there about this DVD. But I wanted to share a short story about my experience with it.  I gained a lot of weight due to some medication I was taking for anxiety.  That plus being very lazy around the house all the time.  Before I knew it I reached 210lbs take or leave a few pounds. But definitely 200+ . I began to really feel down about it.  Fitting my clothes less and less every week.  So I became determined to loose fat, I pushed my self almost everyday using this program along with 30 day shred.  I'd take probably 1 day or 2 off to rest everyweek.  I was very determined. I had lots of fat to burn.  I kept at it.  And every week I was lighter and lighter.  within a few months I dropped so much fat.  And gained a good amount of muscle too.  I tried my best not to over eat or cheat too much with my meals.  For me it was more about moderation rather than a super super clean diet.  I still drank lots of water ate vegetables.  But I had my burgers. Cereal.  And chips from time to time.  It was all about moderation.  Deprivation is not good.  Anyway after mixed both these programs I finally hit 173lbs.  Original weight 210 . I'm 6 feet tall.  So I think that's a fairly good weight.  I'm much healthier now.  I don't feel out of breath when I get up off my chair.  I sleep better.  My skin is better.  I have more confidence.  And I actually fit clothes the way I want to.  We don't need any fancy pills or special diet bars.  Although some can help you.  In the end the things that really help us are the simplest.  Exercise and moderation in your diet,  plus water lots and lots of water cures many things ! No need to over think it. Try it and you will see how much better you can feel.  Using this program consistently mixed with some weight training will bring you lots of results!",1406937600,21,1834,4.090395480225989

It's pretty long for her videos but I'm sure no one will really complain too much after they start doing it more often.  I made it through after pausing two times and cursing her very existence (as I usually do with her Shred with Weights vid I TOTALLY suggest that one.  It's my fave). Anyhow, I will be fighting her three times a week with this and doing my weights (probably her Shred with Weights vid, why not?) the other two days.

3717075,5,B001NFNFN0,Will definitely have you breathing hard. I was able to finish it but definitely felt like quitting during that last circuit.  I exercise off and on but ive been exercising pretty regularly is past month. Some moves that I saw here are similar if not some of the same moves I used when I was doing Insanity so I would defnitely say tis is a challenging cardio workout .,1403136000,,368,4.333333333333333

Every one of them are tough but exhilarating and I have not felt this good about my body in years. Not only do I feel great on the outside but just as Jillian says, I feel wonderful on the inside!",1403136000,,353,4.130434782608695

When I first started it I had to hit pause and catch my breath after every other circuit just so I could get through to the finish. I feel great all day after completing this workout. I alternate this workout with JM's No More Trouble Zones and 6 Week 6 Pack. This is the most challenging of the three. No equipment or weights needed. It is fast paced with a great variety of moves, so the almost hour it takes to complete this video flies by. I am so glad I found it. LOVE IT!!",1403049600,3,586,4.149122807017544

Man did it ever work out my legs, they were sore but a good type of sore, like you did a good exercise routine.  Give it a shot, what can it hurt.  And I like that it is on instant prime and I can do anytime of day at home.",1403049600,,338,3.589041095890411

3717082,5,B001NFNFN0,"I am currently alternating this DVD with NMTZ and I am so amazed at how much stronger I'm getting. This DVD is such an awesome cardio burn.  I love the circuit style technique and I love how I feel after I'm done. I didn't think I would like this DVD too much because it's longer than her other ones (close to an hour), but the workout actually goes by fast and before you know it you're done! Excellent DVD!!!",1402790400,,410,4.189873417721519
3717083,4,B001NFNFN0,"I admit I do like the Jillian workouts.  I felt like He-man afterwards.  I could feel my muscles, even ones I didn't know I had.  Not all of her exercises are safe, but I substituted when she did something I didn't approve of.  Some of her exercises can be unkind to the joints, and if you plan to do them on a regular basis, I would recommend substituting low impact exercises that are kinder.  You can still get a good workout.

Now, I did have one little embarrassing complication as a result of doing this workout for two days. I'm sorry for mentioning this, because I know it is a little gross...but I think it should be mentioned. My abs became so tight--and so did my sphincter.  My sphincter became a little Gandalf--and even though I was eating my fiber and drinking eight glasses of water a day--it was sitting up there telling my bodily waste, ""YOU SHALL NOT PASS!""  It was very uncomfortable and traumatizing.

So...I would no recommend doing this workout everyday.  Give your muscles a rest.  Or if you are going to do it everyday, then maybe store up on stool softeners and laxatives.  I am not a person that usually suffers from these problems, and since I've not been so enthusiastic at doing this workout, everything has went back to normal.",1402617600,,1258,4.542222222222223

I have more muscle and more stamina. She is a great motivator. And I have used many exercise videos!! It's not about dancing or trying to memorize moves. It's simple yet very effective and enough different sets so you never get bored and it goes fast!",1402358400,,411,4.15

3717088,1,B001NFNFN0,"I don't generally write reviews for anything, especially a negative one.  However, my experience with this video has compelled me to warn others.  I have been an athlete and exercised pretty regularly since my teen years.  I started working out 2 weeks after my last child was born, mostly doing turbo jam/turbo fire workouts that are kickboxing based moves that include use of the knees in every single movement.  I know proper form and have never felt knee pain, even during the HIIT workouts that include more jumping, high knees, burpees, etc. Well, I decided (3 months later) to incorporate some Jillian Michaels videos into my schedule just to mix it up a little and the first day doing BFBM left me with a sore right knee.  ""No problem"", I thought, ""just using different muscles. It will be fine after some rest.""  Turns out I was wrong and I just got home from purchasing a knee brace and ice wrap because it'a flaring up really bad around the MCL area.  I'm pretty frustrated that not only will I be missing out on workouts for awhile but I very well could have some damage going on.  I wish I knew what part of the video caused it because I do like Jillian and actually enjoy her video, No More Trouble Zones.  Now, however, I will be trashing these because it seems to be a common sentiment among reviewers and other google searches that many of these videos may cause damage.  It's not worth it.  Hope this helps someone else avoid injury.",1402099200,11,1451,4.542307692307692

3717094,5,B001NFNFN0,"I have several Jillian Michaels videos and this one is my favorite! I consider myself to be pretty fit, as I have been running up to 6 miles a day, 4-5 days a week for the past 20 years. I haven't had as much time recently to get a good run in, so I figured I would change things up and work out at home after work. Even being pretty physically fit, this video was challenging at first! Since I no longer run competitively, I don't cross train. Instead, I had just been running and this video likely pushed my cardiovascular system and I used different muscles than I do with just running. Even though the video is about 55 minutes with the warm up and cool down, I find that it goes by quickly because I enjoy it. I like that Jillian is engaging in the workouts for most of the time rather than just telling the others what to do. There were definitely some times that I had to pause for a break! She is very motivating and infectious. I will definitely continue to use this video, even when I return to running. It will be a great way to work different muscles and get more endurance. Definitely recommend this!",1401580800,,1113,4.254716981132075

The mix of kick-boxing and core strengthening was so good that I was hurting the next day from just my light-hearted attempts.
Ada still joins in from time to time now, but this video is really a good butt-kicker. Also Jillian shows the easy, intermediate, and hard steps for some of the exercises so you can build up to a higher challenge level.",1400630400,,501,4.229166666666667

Yes, the workout is a little intense, but overall is great because it pushes you while keeping a good balance between low and high impact activity.  My heart rate was ""through the roof"" as Jillian says!

I suggest doing it twice a week to up your stamina for the intervals.  Hint: you can adjust exercises to your skill level, but don't stand around and rest, lol. For ex, I hate burpies as they hurt my wrists, so I just do jump squats.",1399075200,,552,4.130841121495327

Somewhere around the 3rd or 4th section of the video, I'm usually ready to call it quits, but she pushes you on.  There are some moves in here that are repeated in the other videos, but she uses them because they're affective.  It's a bit tough on the knees, especially the 2nd portion, so I try the more modified version.  It's a good workout, sweating, swearing (by me), and feel good endorphins.  For the people who think they can't do this, yes you can!  Just start slowly, do the modified version, or do a couple sections of videos and work your way up.

3717145,5,B001NFNFN0,"This workout is great to get your heart pumping and tone.  I do feel like I need to add some targeted effort to abs in addition to the ab work that is provided.  Overall, it makes me sweat and I can tell a difference after doing it 4 times in one week.",1398038400,,252,3.826923076923077
3717146,5,B001NFNFN0,"I really like this workout  because it has a lot of cardio and really keeps your heart rate up if you do it right. It works all kinds of muscles. When I wake up the next day I am hurting all over, so I know it's doing its job. Definitely worth the money, in my opinion.",1397952000,,269,3.8035714285714284
3717147,5,B001NFNFN0,"I do this about twice a week, because it covers a little of everything.  It includes enough cardio to help me work up a sweat and get the heart pumping.  Jillian's instructions and tips/modifications for each move is very helpful.",1397779200,,230,4.725
3717148,5,B001NFNFN0,Great work out. Gets the blood pumping from beginning to end. And with the modifications I am able to keep going through the hard stuff. Its a must do work out.,1397779200,,160,4.193548387096774
3717149,5,B001NFNFN0,Jillian Micheals is one of my favorite trainers to workout to. She knows her stuff and she doesn't do moves that will hurt the body. You will definitely feel it the next day though!,1397779200,,181,4.352941176470588
3717150,5,B001NFNFN0,I love all of her videos! I am used to going to the gym but had to cancel my membership and I am happy to find that all of her videos are like the classes I attended at the ymca ; ) Love her!,1397692800,,191,3.3636363636363638
3717151,5,B001NFNFN0,"This is a good workout when you can't or don't want to get to a gym. The directions are easy the follow, it is well paced and makes you sweat! It is about 50minutes long but well worth it! Have fun!",1397692800,,198,3.8536585365853657
3717152,5,B001NFNFN0,This video takes the place of my cadio kick class when I don't feel like going to the gym.  It's easy to follow and makes you sweat.,1397692800,,132,3.888888888888889
3717153,5,B001NFNFN0,If you are serious about getting in shape this is the lady that will help you get there.  I have lost 1 inch in the waist and 3 in the hips in a month other wise I would have been discouraged.,1397606400,,192,3.682926829268293
3717154,4,B001NFNFN0,I have never done any type of kickboxing and this video does have several kickboxing moves.  It was a nice change of pace.  I also liked some of the different things you could do with the plank.  Even though it makes you work harder... mind over matter I would rather do something then just hold the pose.  Overall I wiil come back to this workout when one of my regular cardio classes is canceled or I'm on the road.  Perfect for a hotel no equipment needed.,1397606400,,459,4.290697674418604
3717155,5,B001NFNFN0,I have tried several Jillian Michaels' workouts. This one is longer and harder if you try to do every movement in advance level. I also add weights to my feet to make it harder. Jillian provides physical training and positive thinking by challenging your thought psychologically in her videos!,1397520000,,293,5.0

3717159,5,B001NFNFN0,"I was so skeptical to do this video, I've always found I slack off or get distracted about 10 minutes in, usually because I'm lost and bored. This was completely different, the moves are easy to learn and you don't do them for so long that you're completely burnt out mentally (physically, maybe a little more so). I consider myself in shape and work out 5-6 times a week at a gym, I was staying in a hotel and was feeling antsy, looking for something to do and this is what I found. Definitely worth the time, by the end, my heart rate was up and I had worked up a good sweat, I even woke up a little sore the next day! I guess it showed me what I need to work on at the gym.

In sum, I think it's a great way to mix up your workout routine and great if you don't have any equipment. Jillian can be hard to listen to, but I find her motivating and enjoy having someone there to push me.",1397433600,,887,3.9553072625698324

I started working out with Jillian Michaels DVD via Amazon and I have drop 2 dress sizes, I went from a DD cup to a C cup in my bra and I feel GREAT and have a lot of energy, power and get the best sleep at night.  This is the best fat burner DVD I have workout to in a long time.",1396742400,3,417,3.404255319148936
3717170,5,B001NFNFN0,"Initially I did not care for the near arrogant and cocky approach of Jillian, but after giving a few of her workouts a try as I could not locate a workout that gave me a real cardio boosting routine, I really like her disciplines. This workout will have you soaked in sweat by the time you are done. I feel like I am actually working hard at burning off the fat I have been trying to lose. People notice the weight loss in me. She is fairly easy to follow, once you know the circuits it is almost fun with upbeat music and coaching from Jillian who has a funny sense of humor. I really like this workout, even though it can be difficult and I love the results it has given me.",1396656000,3,676,4.090225563909774

3717173,5,B001NFNFN0,"I love jillian micheals DVDs. I always buy them. This one worked great. I got muscles where I had never had them before! And the work out went by very fast. My only complaint is it is pretty high impact and it really effects my knees, and I'm only 22 and not overweight at all. But I am a hairstylist so I am on my feet alot..but this is a steal for the price and it is going to give you results!",1396396800,,396,3.841463414634146

I only wished she took her time to explain the exercise before each rep.
Otherwise, very good and comparable to others like P90X.",1396310400,,148,4.518518518518518
3717176,5,B001NFNFN0,"You use your own body weight in this workout.  Shake what your mama gave you Jillian says.  Well, you do more than shake: jog, crunch, swing kicks, punches, back kicks, jab-cross, mountain climbers, skaters and scissor kicks to name a few.  There are seven 6-minute workouts done in circuits with a warm-up and a cool-down.  You will want a yoga mat for some of the moves.

Jillian tells beginners how to modify the moves.  And she explains what muscles the different moves work out, so it's motivating.  Beginners, like me, may want to do 6-12 minutes of circuits at a time and work up to the complete work out.  This will be a great work-out to alternate with yoga, weights and walking.",1396224000,,688,4.581967213114754
3717177,5,B001NFNFN0,I sweat big time and this was very difficult. It was 6 sets of exercises  and you do them twice. This is only my first week exercising and I'm obese and what did I do? I go buy 4 Jillian Michaels dvd's to help me get fit again. Well  I couldn't do but three sets on this one but I am very happy with that because then I know this is a dvd I can grow with and not be done with in a few weeks. I think Jillian is an awesome choice for beginners because she is hard enough to where you have something to work up to. I have a walk it out video which walking is recommended for obese people like me to start out but it's not challenging. Jillian says you have to be uncomfortable to get results and she is absolutely right.,1396224000,3,718,3.877551020408163
3717178,5,B001NFNFN0,"I have tried Jillian's other workouts, including ""No more trouble zones,"" and ""30 day shred"", they both are great workouts.  This workout is straight cardio.  So instead of making it to the gym for a class, or to alternate your running this is a great workout.  Lots of kickboxing, which I love reminds me of the old Taebo moves :)  Would recommend this to anyone who wants a great cardio workout.",1396137600,,397,4.549295774647887

3717180,5,B001NFNFN0,Relentless. I actually felt the burn! Also I like that the kickboxing moves near the beginning and end are not done so fast that you have to sacrifice form. If you have bad knees though you might not enjoy all the plyo.,1396051200,,219,4.238095238095238
3717181,4,B001NFNFN0,Instructions were good and easy to follow. Would definitely recommend for anyone that needs a good exercise DVD to use at home. You will get a good workout.,1396051200,,156,4.607142857142857

3717192,5,B001NFNFN0,"I started doing this workout routine a few months ago, and am happy to say I acclimated to it within a week or so. I needed to up my cardio and  down the strength training and this was a great video to do that with, it's almost an hour of cardio, with some handy ab work in the middle. Like the 30-day Shred, she has assistants showing an easier way to do some moves while keeping moving, and with practice you can work your way up to the harder version of the move. My heart rate stays up with this one and has helped me keep up with being toned and to stay at a steady weight.",1395446400,,578,3.9401709401709404

Jillian's video really works out all your muscle groups all without the need for weights or any other equipment.

I'm trying to become more active and my main goal for using this workout is just that- to be active. If I lose weight that's fine, but I'm not really in it for that. I'm 19 and I have not moved my body like this in AT LEAST 5 years since freshman gym class. I haven't done anything even close to this since then so needless to say I was almost dead after the first circuit. I've been trying to push myself to do at least 2 circuits a day (I have to rest in between) so I can get better and better. Hopefully I can work my way up to doing all of them soon. I drink A LOT of water too haha! Which is great for anybody. I get so thirsty afterwards and I drink so much water so I know that is a great side effect as well.

By the way, Jillian is just too cool. I love her and she really makes anyone feel like they can do this even if it may be hard. She's a great trainer. :)",1394841600,,955,3.775

3717208,3,B001NFNFN0,"I was surprised at how much easier this video was compared to what I expected from it. I didn't even bother reading the 1 and 2 star reviews before purchasing it, which I always do when buying anything, but thought ""hey, it's Jillian Michaels, anything she does will make me sweat."" After reading several 5 star reviews, I was convinced and put it in my shopping cart. I will go on the record saying I love, love, LOVE No More Trouble Zones and after 53 minutes look like I ran a marathon. I don't know what happened with this video. There were a few peaks where my heart rate got above 150, but mostly valleys where I felt disappointed because I knew there was no way I was going to burn near the 450 calories another reviewer burned. Sure enough, I barely surpassed 320 calories after 52 minutes. Oh, and to make sure I proactively respond to any critics I did the whole thing, I was working as intensely as the three on the video and sometimes harder knowing my heart rate wasn't where I wanted it to be, I took NO breaks and I am not a personal trainer or instructor. I am very active and fit, but Jillian and her girls could blow me out of the water. I won't waste this DVD as I do really love Jillian Michaels, but I'll have to figure out how to step it up a notch to get near that 450 calories that I had so hoped to burn.",1394668800,,1329,4.155038759689923

3717210,5,B001NFNFN0,"Let me say I thought this wouldn't be too tough as I'm a fairly advanced exerciser at the age of 53, however, this video is tough! I love it though and I feel so accomplished after I have completed the workout even when I really do want ""to phone it in"" towards the end of the workout. Oh heck, I want to phone it in after every circuit! But then I hear Jillian say ""I don't want you coming all this way to phone it in at the end"" so I keep plugging away at it and am always glad I did. And although it is a tough workout, the moves are not difficult in themselves...it's just hard to do some of them when you are trying to catch your breath! I have several of Jari Love's Ripped series videos as well as Denise Austin's videos too and I like them as well. But it's nice to change up the instructor and the exercises too so I will be purchasing more of Jillian's videos. I like her style. It's a bit different than the others but that's ok...I need her to remind me that I took the time to workout and how I need to make the most of it! It truly is motivational. I would reccommend this video.",1394668800,,1093,3.9954337899543377

I have seen a difference in my body by incorporating this into my current routine.  It is great for the winter as I cannot get out and run or hike like I usually do.

I recommend this, not for the novice, however.  I recommend this to someone who is in somewhat decent shape as I think this could be a bit daunting for someone starting out.",1394150400,3,549,4.3431372549019605

Take your time and listen to your body and you will be fine. I loved the variety and lack of body related self image and shopping references such as: oh your booty will look so good in a new pair of jeans after this!

3717232,5,B001NFNFN0,5 Stars. Most workout DVDs are too easy and kind of boring. This is not. Lots of fun moves and I seriously get my heart rate up. Highly recommended for anyone looking to get more variety in their exercise routine.,1393891200,,213,4.35
3717233,3,B001NFNFN0,"This is classic Jillian Michaels. Lots of plyometrics, squats, and kickboxing moves are integrated in and one of the circuits is focused on abdominal work (floor-based mountain climbers, planks, pike-legged crunches, etc...). Each circuit is repeated twice and the workout it set up so that going through each circuit twice pretty much equals to 6 minutes apiece.

If knee problems are an issue for you, use caution because there is a lot of jumping in this workout.

Per the title of this review, the workout is set up to produce a good cardio session while integrating some body-weight muscle conditioning; and it does offer this feature. However, the workout is so boring that by the time I got to the 5th circuit, I was so disinterested that I started thinking about other places I'd rather be and setting up way more attractive scenarios in my head. The reason this is a problem is because I find that workouts are more effective when you are focusing on them (ie. mind-muscle connection).

The abdominal circuit (#4), for me, was totally anti-climactic and I feel that it lent to the feeling of ""over it"" I had soon after. Perhaps, Jillian should have put that one as the last circuit. If I had to guess, I'd say that the slight recuperative nature of the floor work just doesn't help maintain motivation for the rest of the more aerobic circuits that follow it.

What I really think this DVD should have done was left it to 5 circuits which would still have been a good 30 minute workout (not including warm-up) OR just performed each circuit once through to avoid the tedium and downright annoyance of having to perform the circuits twice (maybe that's why several of her subsequent DVD's have multiple shorter workouts instead).

The DVD has a ""Recommendations"" option that's basically a paragraph saying that for best results, you should workout with Jillian 5 days/wk (if you can do this 5 days/wk without feeling like you're watching paint dry, hats off to you). The ""Bonus"" option is a list of things like ""Jillian's Top Tips for a Healthy Lifestyle"", information on where to find workout music, a free offer and advertisements for other DVD's distributed by Lionsgate.

If you decide to try it, find it at the lowest price you can.",1393804800,,2245,4.77319587628866

3717239,5,B001NFNFN0,"This workout is perfect if you're already in good shape, but you just want to slim down. I had been working out for a few weeks with little results (as far as fat burning is concerned) and I needed something to boost my metabolism. Well, this workout does what it says, ""Banish fat, Boost metabolism."" I did this workout 4 days the first week, not doing any other workouts and I lost about 3lbs of just fat. I definitely look slimmer.

Pre-workout I weighed 137lbs and after the week was done, I weighed 134lbs. My goal weight is only around 125 - 128lbs. It doesn't sound like much, but losing those last few pounds can be hard when you're already in pretty good shape and already have the muscle underneath.

I've done many other ""Jillian"" workouts and I've done insanity. Her workouts are consistent with the results. If it says it on the cover, then that's what you're going to get. Simple as that. This particular workout is kind of like a less extreme version of insanity. It's intense, but not so intense you feel completely exhausted afterward. It will also help boost your workout endurance. After a week of that, I did Jillian's 30 Day Shred and it felt a lot easier to get through. Although the ""Shred"" is only 25 minutes, it's still tough, but there's not as much cardio because it's a full body/strength building workout. Hence, why I tried this video and it totally worked. If you want some quicker results, then give this one a try. If you just want to slim down a little before beach season, this is perfect! However, as Jillian always says, be prepared to work for it ;)",1393545600,8,1587,4.506944444444445

I liked it so much that after using it twice, I ordered Shred it in 30 and Kickboxing Fastfix too. And then got all of her others from the local library to see if they are worth buying to mix things up. (So far I think Metabolism is my favorite.) They're not expensive. When it's too cold to exercise outside- this is the way to go. You can do it with a tiny space and no equipment- though a mat and hand weights help.

It *is* a lot of fun to do, although I'll say that some of the exercises are prohibitively hard on my knees, so I can't imagine what they'd be like for someone who is more overweight. I wouldn't suggest it if you're just starting an exercise routine because, despite the up-beat and kick ass attitude of Jillian Michaels, it can be a bit discouraging.

I feel that the intensity gets to an almost-breaking point, then you get a slightly-less challenging circuit that's still effective but not so hard that you want to quit. Jillian is great at keeping your attention and focus while being entertaining., which is what makes a great workout DVD great.

Each circuit is a series of moves repeated twice. Lots of squatting and jumping/body weight movement/kickboxing. I use light weights to supplement some of the moves, although no weights are used in the workout. The workout is hard enough on its own.

We first started with the 30 Day Shred 20 minute routines and then tried this one.  The first time going through it, I wasn't able to finish it (primarily because I needed more exercise period), but after the second time I was able to complete every time.  I like the kickboxing aspect of it as well as the wide variance of moves between the circuits.  The hour seems to go by fairly quickly and the moves aren't as intense as the 30 Day Shred 20 minute routines, but my heart rate and breathing maintain at the level similar to a long-distance run.

3717339,5,B001NFNFN0,"First of all let me say I am not a big fan of exercise.  My alarm in the morning is titled, No Excuses, because as soon as it goes off, I begin to list all the reasons why I should sleep for an extra half hour rather than getting up to exercise.  I am very creative in my excuses!  Some of them later make no sense whatsoever.  So my review is coming from my perspective of Id rather sleep in, but I know I need to exercise.

There is no denying the extensive health benefits of exercise, so I try to find programs that offer the maximum amount of benefits in the minimal amount of time.  I stumbled on a gem with Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism.  Jillian Michaels, of Biggest Loser fame, has come up with an intense circuit workout.  Each circuit lasts about 5 minutes and has 4 different exercises repeated twice.  Then she moves on to the next circuit.  This is great for people like me who are bored by repetition.  Most of the exercise DVDs that are collecting dust on my shelf are there because the instructor tells me to do the same move over and over and over again.  With Jillians DVD, you do the move twice and then you don't have to do that move again.  This is a great thing because one circuit has burpees and I am really bad at those and despise them.  But, since I know I will only have to do them twice and then never again (until tomorrow), I can handle it.

I know this exercise program is working because of two very scientific reasons.  The first one is a few days ago I was at my sons basketball game and he made a three-pointer so I clapped really hard and my wedding ring almost fell off.  I had to stop clapping to slide my ring back in place.  The other very scientific reason is that I have these 5 inch heel boots that are my absolute favorite and instead of sitting down to put them on like a normal person would, I always stand up to put them on.  This generally results in me falling over, much to the amusement of my family.  Well, the other day I went to put them on and I steadied myself with my new core muscles (thanks to burpees, Im assuming) and when my hand rested on my thigh muscle of my supporting leg, I could actually feel a defined muscle!

This routine seems to go by very quickly.  I only have two criticisms of this DVD.  The first is that Jillian seems unable to tell how long five seconds is.  She will say, five more seconds of a particular exercise and sometimes the way she counts it turns out to be about 8 seconds and sometimes its about 3.  Every once in a while it is in fact five seconds.  The second criticism is that her cuing is odd.  After explaining the exercise, she will say, Ready, and and sometimes the exercise begins after she says and, while other times it begins when she says and.  Once you have done the routine a few times, though, you will get used to when to start each one.  Except for the burpees.  I am always a few behind because I didn't know when to start.  (Wink, wink.)

While I definitely recommend this exercise program, please be aware that there is a lot of jumping, so if you have bad knees, this might not be the program for you.

When you are done you know that you just did a serious work out. It's approximately 48 minutes of constant cardio that includes an active aerobic warm up and about 6 minutes of cool down & stretching.  I am in fairly good shape although I have some weight to lose and I find this workout an excellent challenge.  If you are just starting out exercising I would think that this would be a bit too much to take on although JM does show some easier versions of some of the exercises.
A note about JM - I have to admit that I have never been a fan of hers previously.  When I would see her on the Biggest Loser she would rub me the wrong way.  However, after trying this workout I am a big fan now!  She is one awesome trainer & is able to get that across even via video.  Some people have commented that she does a lot of talking during this video and that is true - but it doesn't really matter what she's doing....it's what you do that matters :)",1389398400,,1090,4.0418604651162795

3717358,2,B001NFNFN0,"Not a great exercise video -- Jillian wants you to do what she says, not what she does, so while she says ""keep moving"" to burn the most calories, she hesitates herself trying to get back on beat and messes up the flow. Very sloppy instruction, not mindful of knees and elbows and shoulders and other delicate joints, some exercises way too advanced for moderate exercisers. Mostly a disappointment.

The only reason I would recommend it is that it's the only fairly quick-paced fitness video offered for free from Amazon.",1389139200,,522,4.8

3717362,5,B001NFNFN0,"Tried this workout tonight. It is an excellent complimentary DVD to her No More Trouble Zones DVD, but is also perfect for a stand alone DVD as well. 45 minutes of pure cardio that includes upper and body circuits. It also has some of her classic kick boxing moves. There is a 5 minute warm up, 6 circuits of the workout that are 5 minutes each, and a 5 minute cool down. This is WELL worth your time. Even if you don't have time for the whole workout, the DVD is set up where you can choose whatever circuits you want.

As for the workout in itself, I really had a good time with it. I wear a heart rate monitor to track calories burned and at the end, I was over 400 calories burned... in just 45 minutes! I consider myself in somewhat good shape, as I've been doing a lot of her other DVD's and have been long distance running for almost a  year now. It is great for seasoned athletes and beginners alike. She provides modifications and ""easier"" ways to conquer moves for those who are working up their strength and stamina.

By the third or fourth time, I was able to get through it without the desire to crawl into bed afterward.  I could barely walk when I was done..

Now I think up to 6-8 times doing it.  It feels really good when I'm done now, and I see results.  My stomach is much flatter, and my butt is definitely lifting.  Feel a major difference in my hamstrings and triceps too.

In general, I have noticed a huge improvement is my posture and well-being.  Highly recommend.  Give yourself a chance to work through it.  So worth it!!",1388966400,4,671,4.330645161290323

The workouts are longer, but I feel like you get more from it. You can also pick which ones to do if you don't want to do them all (or can't, due to an injury). I also really like the option to play them with or without the directions so once you get the hang of it you can play it without which makes it a quicker workout.

3717380,5,B001NFNFN0,"Although I did not loose pounds and pounds as promised, in a few weeks - between the worst time of year Thxgving thru xmas - I was using this workout routine regularly (at least 6 days/wk), I DEFINITELY lost inches and gained muscle. Quite a feat, especially during this time of year. Also quite amazing considering all without weights and just using a small amount of space in a bedroom!

I love waking up in the morning and somewhat dreading the feeling of having to do a few painful circuits before my body is warmed up. Then things get easier, I start to feel great & strong, & suddenly the workout is over & I fee fabulous. Jillian is an amazing motivator and trainer. She gets fast results! I love working out to this video! Just when you think you can't take it any more, Jillian asks you for just 2 more reps. You don't feel bad about getting sweaty or winded, the girls in the workout are just as sweaty!

At first the jumps really bothered my joints, and some of the back arching hurt my lower back. However, now I use a double thick carpet, and sometimes a yoga mat for cushion & don't have the problems I used to in my joints. I believe I am also building strength in these areas, so it's making a big difference to push through and build the muscle to support the weak joints.

Jillian is brilliant. This video is amazing. I love her. I hate her. Any trainer that burpees are their favorite aerobic exercise is a sadist. & I love it.

3717387,3,B001NFNFN0,"This is one of Jillian's easiest workouts. There are no weights used, and she goes pretty easy on the up-down, up-down, interval training style that she uses in Blast-your face off workouts like Extreme Shred.

I say this as a survivor of almost all her DVD's. I really love the workout that uses Kettleballs. This woman is Insane-o-grams... for you to lose weight!

HAHAHAHA

Okay, seriously. This workout was very boring for me, because in her other workouts, you're holding 2lb weights or kettleballs, WHILE doing these type of moves, WHILE kickboxing, WHILE she's making you jump back down to the floor for pushups or crunches, THEN back up to standing for more moves while holding freeweights/kettleballs.

This is definitely an excellent introduction into Jillian's world. I also like to do it when I am not feeling well, or have been slacking off and need to get back into exercise. I find Jillian's normal videos exhausting about 5 minutes in! This is not that video. This is a good one for after work when I just don't want to get my butt kicked that hard, but I do want to workout. A ""keep the circuits moving"" video, a happy medium.

Helpful hint: The music is absolutely UNBEARABLE. It's an Ab debacle that goes on for the first 15 minutes. Mute her and put in something else. That's what I do for all her videos anyway, until the end. She has some nice motivational speeches.

Also: Her videos are worth the work. You will results like crazy-sauce! As though you went to a trainer!",1387756800,,1494,4.661596958174905

For this DVD, it definitely kicked my butt but it was still DOABLE, especially compared to Insanity, which even when you're in GREAT shape isn't always doable.

I particularly liked the ab stuff - full belly workout!  I gave it 4 stars because it has a lot of high impact jumping and my ol' dogs don't love that kind of thing these days.

Your body needs that food/fuel to manage the complete butt kicking that this DVD delivers. I dropped about 3.5 pounds in just two weeks!... But the pounds don't matter, as I can see my body changing.

I have to admit when I first started the DVD and it was easy I got concerned. My heart rate wasn't up. Uh-oh. But once it got going it got going! She eases you from warm up to workout, which is good because I have never gotten injured with her videos. The jumps, etc. really get your heart rate up, not like if you'd just sprinted for hours uphill, but I've tried her butt, abs, and this DVD, and they all got my heart rate up.
I workout four or five times a week, sometimes six. Weights, cardio, videos, crunches, etc. A little of this and a little of that. I consider myself intermediate when it comes to weights and advanced with cardio. The fact that a workout video manages to get my heart rate up is a good thing. I can't stand the videos where you march in place slowly with a big cheerleader smile on your face.
This DVD runs at about 55 minutes, counting warm up and cool down. You don't need any equipment, just make sure you have your body with you. I like that it doesn't require a shopping list of supplies to purchase before you're able to use the video. I don't mind videos adding things to their cardio, but it is nice to just have a cardio DVD that doesn't require a bunch of extra stuff.
I like Jillian's personality, but I know some don't. If it helps she is toned down in this DVD.",1383955200,,1416,4.134057971014493

Also, I'm energized for the day.  I've only been doing this routine for about four weeks so I can't tell in my clothes yet but I sure can feel it in my muscles.

So, when after gaining 15 lbs and finally figuring out that I'm now too old to engage in fad diets, I signed up for Weight Watchers and diligently started in on this JM video anywhere from 2-4 times a week.  After 3 months at it, I've developed a favorite routine.  I love circuits 1-4 - no matter what I get through those.  I don't love circuits 5 and 7 - they somewhat bore me.  Circuit 6 is a killer, even after months of going at it. It's not far off from he bootcamp sessions I had, but for far less money.

Also, I do have some knee pain and it never bothers me after working out to this video- there isn't ANY one exercise that puts stress on one joint at a time (e.g.lunges) which makes a huge difference for my ability to sustain using this video.

Overall, there's a ton of variety in this video and it's an ass kicker, even after months of workin' it. Theres enough variety to customize this video as one sees fit.  Go for it!

3717424,5,B001NFNFN0,"This video will always have a sweet spot on my shelf because it's the workout I did every day when I started working out. Jillian really pushes and motivates you, and that kept me going through my fitness journey at the beginning, which is when faltering often occurs. I know some people dislike her 'tough trainer' attitude, but it can be very motivating for others! The moves in this workout are very athletic and easy to follow; there's no tricky choreography, just a lot of very effective plyometric and calisthenic moves, all using your own body weight. Because of the very basic nature of the moves, it doesn't require a lot of space either, which is a huge pro for me working out in my small studio. (Though my neighbors probably don't appreciate the plyometric nature of Jillian's moves!)

After a few weeks of doing this video, some moves became too easy, so I added 5-lb handweights. I love that the intensity of this workout can be bumped up to an advanced level just by adding weights or jumping a little higher or further. Overall, a very versatile and effective workout.",1381708800,,1084,4.675392670157068

I'm 18, not far off 19, and i've been fitness training since the age of 15 so my fitness levels are pretty high and completed the dvd first time throughout no problem. However, for people who are just starting out, I'd recommend working your way up as it is tough! I first tried the 30 day shred with Jillian Michaels about a year ago and I loved that workout! However, I much prefer this one! The sections are so effective in raising your heart rate and lowering it to produce HIIT circuits, which as you may know are the best way to burn fat quickly. This workout is long for an at home cardio workout, however, as i'm a student I have a lot of time to do this as well as weight training also. The positive of this workout is that it made me feel almost as sweaty as my usual hour long cross trainer sessions at the gym without having to pay an expensive gym membership! The only downside I saw was the fact I live in an apartment and i'm on the 3rd floor so some of the moves aren't 'apartment friendly'.

My biggest problem is when you select the workouts your choice is:  workout w/ instruction and music or workout w/no instruction that this one there is no sound.  If you choose the w/ instruction it move soo.. slow!  It is not what I would call high intensity.  I don't even think each move is more that 30secs each.....I am use to 45- 1min/ movement.  I turned it off 30 min. into that swtich to Shaun T.
I don't like the backdrop where it was filmed either.  Shaun T is in a real gym w/ pple.  Jillian is in a yoga studio w/ 2 other pple..so I don't feel like I am a part of a group...I just didn't feel connected to the pple. Jillian seems to stop and start in between each circuit vs. moving straight through.....it is just so different from the Insanity that I found it boring. It was just too slow.

I finished doing 'No Trouble Zones' before trying this workout, which is also broken into 7 circuits. Therefore, I thought I could do this workout with ease despite the previous reviews I had read. WRONG! I had to stop to catch my breath several times to get through it, whereas I never had to stop once in 'No Trouble Zones'. I felt like I was going to throw up at times, it pushed me so hard. Which is good, because this gives me a challenge and takes it up a notch for me! I am in good shape, but I still have a little more fat to burn after my first pregnancy.

Some days I pause after each circuit, drink a bit of water and start back up. My goal isn't to do it all at once, but to do what I can.

3717437,5,B001NFNFN0,"A lot's already been said about this workout. The workout is amazing and HARD! If you've never done a Jillian Michaels workout, this may be a good place to start. You don't need to do all the circuits. Also, you can make some of the moves harder (jumping on each of the burpees, jumping on all the pli sqats, etc) or easier (decreasing range of motion, doing squats instead of jumps). I like that the action in this workout is continuous, but it's not at a breakneck pace (I would consider ""Ripped in 30"" to be a breakneck pace). She takes the time to do a bit more instruction which I find really helpful.

Her two backup girls are awesome. Kristin is a beast!

The music is better than in 30 Day Shred (though let's be honest, what workout doesn't have better music than 30 Day Shred?).

Once you're comfortable with the exercises, you have the option of playing the DVD with only the music in the background (you won't hear Jillian's instruction). Haven't tried it yet, but could be a good thing.

The ""bonus"" section on this DVD are all product promotions - and kind of lame ones. I love Oral-B toothbrushes, but really, Jillian? And, while I like Nordic Track, I could do without the blatant plug mid-workout.

Despite those things, I still love the results this workout gives me. The DVD gets 5 stars because the workout itself is just that good.",1379462400,,1352,4.502040816326531

3717441,3,B001NFNFN0,"After falling out of love with Tae Bo (well, more Billy Blanks than Tae Bo), I needed a good cardio video without weights. Everybody seems to love Jillian. So I went with this.

It's one hell of a workout. You will work every part of your body. Your heart rate will soar. You will burn calories. Jillian's cueing is pretty good and she's ok at keeping you motivated. Technically, all the factors are there that should allow me to give this workout a 4 or 5 star rating.

But dude...I HATE this workout.

It has absolutely zero fun factor about it. Even though it's tough, I don't especially feel great or like I've accomplished anything great when I'm done. I just feel drained and relieved that it's over. It's flat-out grueling. I dread doing it.

Regardless, this workout will remain in my rotation because I know it's good for me.

I'm also not crazy about the two gals with Jillian. I don't trust anyone who smiles that much or sweats that little while working out.",1378339200,6,970,4.52

To compare, I have the Shred (in 30 days), Trouble Zones, and Shed to Shred. All have *something* I don't like about them.

Fat Blast requires no equipment at all. It's a fast moving circuit workout with many different moves. I especially like the punches/kicks segment. Although it says it's a 40 min workout, they lie! ;) It's actually 49 minutes. I am in good shape (avid runner and do alot of other videos like Insanity/P90X), and this keeps my heart rate up.

3717445,3,B001NFNFN0,"I used Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism in conjunction with the other release (No More Trouble Zones) for the six months leading up to my wedding. I consider myself to be in excellent shape (avid runner), but I did want to get a more sculpted physique for the big day. I definitely saw results, but my knees felt very vulnerable to injury (though I should mention I have a bad knee (torn ACL) from a soccer injury from 10 years ago.)  I was able to do the workouts consistently but every few weeks my knee would swell up and sideline me for a couple of days.

Also, I kind of got tired of how intense it all was. I much prefer trainers who make exercise fun and engaging and don't make it seem like working out is a do or die situation you put yourself in. Honest, consistent exercising with a healthy diet should suffice, and I just feel like workouts like this can be very intimidating to someone who is trying to make a change in their lives.",1377734400,2,941,4.280898876404494
3717446,4,B001NFNFN0,"I don't know why, but that line cracks me up every time.  I really like that Jillian teases her fellow fitness instructors and pokes fun at her own lack of flexibility.  Once you get used to her affected machismo, she's one of the least annoying workout video instructors I've come across.

This is a great cardio workout, but I do agree with other reviewers that it can be a bit tough on your joints.  I would still recommend to people with bad knees, though.  On days that my knees are achey, I just adjust by doing steps/squats where appropriate (i.e., where there's an upward jump, I squat instead, where there's a side jump, I step instead) or just march in place for that part.  When she does the 180 degree jumps, I do 90 degree instead, etc.

I gave four stars instead of five because I think the floor exercise segment is awkwardly placed.  I think it's the fourth segment (after the warm-up and two cardio segments) and it kind of puts a hiccup in the momentum for me.  Once I'm down on the floor, I just don't want to get back up.  Plus, with my heart-rate way up by that point, and my stomach churning, the second exercise of the segment - which consists of putting all your weight on your stomach on the floor - makes me feel like I might barf out all my organs.  I always fast forward through that segment with the intention of going back and doing it right before the cool-down, but I never do.

As with any workout video, you'll burn out on it pretty quick if you try to do it every day, but I definitely recommend it as part of a varied workout routine.",1377561600,7,1570,4.302721088435374

It's a cardio blast, there is strength involved but you use your own body weight. This woman is nuts, but in a good way. If you're looking to get your butt kicked this is the DVD for you, although it is incredibly hard it works. Nothing has ever produced results so fast for me. Circuit 1 is hard then you get to circuit 2 and you are dying. What I have noticed with a lot of Jillian's dvd's is she likes to make the second circuit and the second to last circuit incredibly difficult. At least that is certainly the case in this one.

3717466,5,B001NFNFN0,"I am a Jillian Michaels junkie, and have used a lot of her videos. I started with 30 Day Shred, followed by Ripped in 30, and then tried different ones like Banish Fat, No More Trouble Zones, 6 Week 6 Pack, and Killer Buns and Thighs. Banish Fat Boost Metabolism is by far one of my favorite videos. It is intense and hard to get through, and by the end my face is beet red and I'm huffing and puffing. However, my body and mind have never felt better than when I am doing the cool down portion. She even makes a comment about feeling ""zen"" during the stretching, which is very true! Although it's a really hard cardio workout, it's worth it in the end. Also, you don't need any equipment- all you need is a small amount of space to do the moves. There isn't a cheaper way to burn a ton of calories and get a killer workout, and Jillian always manages to say something motivating right when I'm about to quit, which I hate and love about her!!",1373760000,2,943,4.186813186813187

The ladies in the background are supposed to be ""aspirational"" but seeing them do kicks up to their heads, my lumbering, shameful, barely-up-to-my-hip kicks just made me hate them. If you can ignore the barely breathing background ladies, you will love this workout. You will sweat. You will pant.

This is a fantastic workout that gets your heart rate blasting and your muscles burning. I love that this doesn't require any equipment, plus it doesn't require very much space. You may not see results as quickly as is claimed on the cover (losing 5 lbs a week is pretty crazy!) but I can definitely see more muscle definition after one week of doing this video.

My favorite is 30 DS and Biggest Loser Last Chance Workout along with No More Trouble Zones.
I'm 54, in pretty good shape, but have a knee that gives me pain with jumps, etc. If you have knee issues, she does jump a lot in this DVD...squat and jump, hop, jump in a circle, etc. I modify, learning from other DVD's, but it good to know going in before you buy it. She will tell you that you can do a modification, but unlike other DVD's doesn't have someone doing it all the time.

She doesn't compare to Shelly or Billy, but for what it is, it's great. Would recommend, even for a beginner--just make sure to kick and punch correctly (no shuffling in the shoulder, use your waist), and be very careful with some of the moves that require a stable knee...if you are just starting out it would be very easy to hurt your knees with many of these advanced jumping moves.",1369958400,,708,4.5390625

I consider myself in good shape, but cardio stamina has always been an issue for me (I prefer cardio/weight training circuits--like in her 30 day shred dvd). This is strictly cardio and plyometrics, so be prepared.

3717544,5,B001NFNFN0,"I've owned this Jillian Michael's DVD for a few years now, so I feel pretty confident giving a review. If you're looking for an amazing cardio workout (that you can do anywhere, without extra equipment) this is the only workout you'll need. I own multiple Jillian Michael's workout DVD's, and I really do love all of them, but this one consistently stands out as the best. It's efficient, effective, and gives me great results in a very short period of time.

I normally do a lot of weight lifting, but find that once the warmer months come around, I need a good cardio workout that will help me shed any extra weight and help me look leaner. This workout is perfect for doing just that. The workout is about 40 minutes long, you don't need any extra equipment (i.e. weights, stretchy bands, kettlebells), and you can do it in a small space (I workout in the living room of my apartment and I've even done it in small hotel rooms). By the end of the workout I'm dripping in sweat and feel amazing. And unlike a lot of cardio workouts, this will really tone your muscles and give you great definition.

I appreciate that the workout is broken down into 7 circuits (6 minutes each), so if you can't do the entire workout, you can pick and choose which circuits you want to do that day. It also helps keep the workout interesting and engaging because you're constantly moving on to the next set of moves. I also like how Jillian tells you what muscles you're working with each move...it makes me more motivated knowing that I'm working multiple muscle groups with a single movement.

If you've never tried a Jillian Michaels DVD (or you're new to exercising in general) I would recommend watching the video the whole way through before starting the workout. Jillian moves quickly (which I like), but if you're not familiar with the moves it might be hard to keep up at first.",1364515200,8,1872,4.548961424332345
3717545,5,B001NFNFN0,"People who say Jillian is annoying and grating are absolutely right. However, she is less annoying in this video than some of her newer ones. In this one, she encourages you, talks about form, etc. and doesn't try to do her cute/tough routine. Plus, the moves are straightforward enough that if you do the video a few times, you can turn the sound off and just listen to your own music. In many of her videos, this is not true.

I think this her most difficult workout. The moves themselves are simple and anyone can do them, unlike some of the newer videos where you are struggling with trying to do the move but not actually getting that much exercise out of it. It is harder and longer (45min workout segment) than 30 day shred - you would have to combine two workouts in 30DS to do a workout as long and as hard as this. If you do all six circuits (yes, I said six), you will be very tired at the end. For these reasons, it has taken the top spot as my favourite Jillian video. I've tried quite a few of them. My favourites are 30DS, this one, and no more trouble zones. These three actually come as a set on Amazon, which I think would be a great deal.

There is a lot of cardio here. Jillian unfortunately does not show many of the moves in a low impact version, but if you have been exercising for any length of time at all, you already know how to modify the jumping moves into something that is lower impact. What I like is that she doesn't spend a lot of time doing plank and yoga based circuits (only circuit #4) which are hard on the wrists and back. You do not need equipment to do this video, not even hand weights. For me this is irrelevant, but some people might apreciate it. Note, I'm not saying there is not strength based stuff here, it's just that you are using your bodyweight more and you do the moves quickly, so I'd say it is more cardio than strength. It reminds me of an intense boot camp class. She does not have a lot of ab stuff here, unlike 30 day shred where it's at the end of each circuit. Some people will like this, some will want more abs.

The length and intensity might be too much for people to want to do every day, but it is a great cardio video to mix in with your strength workouts. I often feel like 30DS and Ripped in 30 are a little too short, because the actual workout segments are only 20-25 minutes long. With this BFBM, I don't feel ripped off that way. It's like going to the gym and doing a bootcamp class, but you can do it in the privacy of your own home.

I ended the workout feeling like my muscles hadn't worked hard enough, but my knees would need a break for a few days. If you have rock-solid joints, good for you, you might like this one, but if you are like I am, try Extreme Shed and Shred, which is, in my opinion, a better workout that's also much kinder to the joints.",1364256000,,489,4.326086956521739

On top of that, it keeps my heart rate up and I really feel like I get a good workout.

BFBM, along with No More Trouble Zones, are the workouts I do when I have the luxury of more than 30 minutes. Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism is mostly cardio - no weights needed and just one circuit of ab work. Other reviews have said that Circuit 2 is the hardest, but I find Circuit 6 to be the killer, maybe because it's so far into the workout and I've been working so hard for so long by that point! Jillian is much easier to listen to in this one, not so brash (even though I don't mind that on her other videos). I like that the red-headed backup exerciser actually sweats! Like me!

This program is one of the best of the many I've tried and offers a warm-up, 7 circuits, and a cool-down.  It's a challenging workout (with some modifications offered for those at beginner and more advanced levels) packed into 40 minutes.  It combines a lot of cardio with strength mixed in ""so you can catch your breath"", all just using your own body--the only tools you'll need are a quality pair of sneakers for foot support and lots of water!  Jillian takes you through tons of different moves, changing from one to the next quickly--you'll be working too hard to get bored.  The only thing I didn't like about this workout was the music (one of the tunes is actually the ringtone my cellphone came with!) and that the ""Bonus"" section on the DVD is just an ad for an Oral B toothbrush and other DVDs.

Jillian has a reputation for being tough, but she just tells it like it is--you can't get results if you don't put in the work.  She is like a flirtatious, snarly dominatrix, egging you on to give it your all--in life as well as in your workout.

Every morning I do her 30 day Shred and this one I use 2 days a week after I've done the 30 Day Shred, I alternate with weight training and some of her other dvds on other days as well.  This workout has me sweating every time but boy I feel great when I'm finished.  This is broken into seven 6 minute circuits.  I definitely see definition in my arms, sides and calves.  There are several other dvds I'd like to get of Jillians, I just don't know when I'd work them in.  I like the way she does count downs - it's good to hear the end is near.  When I feel myself getting stronger and some workouts coming easier, I increase the intensity - I bend lower, I stretch further, I jump higher.

I'm 48, I'm thrilled to be able to do these workouts - I love the way I feel.

Then I tried it. The first three times I attempted this workout, I hated Jillian Michaels. Hated her for those disgustingly perfect abs and that fitness that I've been struggling to get back to. And hated her for being able to talk through this intense, killer workout when I could barely keep up without having a stroke. There I was, unable to get through those first three circuits without feeling half dead.

Then somewhere around the sixth time through, I realized ""Hey, I just made it through this thing without needing an oxygen mask!"" And I felt...not good (that's expecting way too much!), but like I'd accomplished something. Something good. Something for myself.

I'm now two weeks into this workout. It's getting easier, and the love is starting to go out to Ms. Michaels. She's tough, which I don't mind. Still, this is by far the toughest workout I've ever attempted. The workout is intentionally hard, and if you try as hard as you can, you're going to conquer it.

I am so sore after doing Banish Fat and then NMTZ the day after!  I like this workout, it is tough and none of the dancy stuff (like the Brazil Butt Cardio Axe). This workout is great and ideal to rotate with NMTZ. I like it that just when your body can't take it, you move on to the next move which allows you to recover. Also, it is twice as long as the Shred and Ripped. I have only done it once and needed to modify a few moves to make it easier but I look forward to doing the workout the right way eventually.

3717592,5,B001NFNFN0,"I've done just about every Jillian DVD over the last 3 years.  Started with the Shred and Ripped in 30.  That is what this DVD reminds me of, just without the 3-2-1 circuits that mix in strength and abs.  BFBM is pretty much purely cardio.  Which I appreciate having a Jillian DVD for this, because you know it's going to BURN LOTS of calories!

BFBM is approximately a 55 minute workout if you include warm up and cool down.  There are 7 six minute circuits full of heart pumping exercises, some of my favorites are the 180 jumps, the squats with a kick out, the skiers, pike crunches and some of the old school stuff like jumping jacks and butt kicks.  I like that there is a circuit that works the abs with plank work- twists, ab holds, pike crunches, supermans etc.  The kick boxing stuff is actually kind of fun too.  One word of advice if you are a more advanced athlete, you may want to add weights to some of these moves.  I consider myself in good shape and some of these were slightly too easy for me, so I just picked up a weight and held while I did the squats or leg kicks or some of the boxing moves.  Some of the moves were too difficult for me with weights, but there were many I needed the extra ""punch"".  Overall, I did 48 minutes (not including cool down) and burned 300 calories- I'm 5"" tall, 115lbs.  Definitely a great burn for my time!!

I'd definitely recommend this DVD to friends, as I do all her DVD's (well, most!).  If I didn't run and bike, I'd do this much more frequently, but it's nice to change things up.  This dvd mixed with No More Trouble Zones, will really get you great results!  That is my favorite of hers because it targets EVERYTHING, plus your HR is up and it's got lots of strength moves.  Classic Jillian DVD's are my favorite.",1360108800,8,1774,4.276276276276277
3717603,4,B001NFNFN0,"I'll immediately admit that I love both Bob Harper (Inside Out Method series, Total Body Transformation, Ultimate Cardio Body) and Jillian Michaels DVDs (30 Day Shred, No More Trouble Zones). I also have a few Jackie Warner DVDs, but I don't like those as much. I was excited to incorporate the BFBM DVD into the rotation and gave it a try last week. It's definitely a tough workout - my heart rate was up and I was definitely sweating! Other reviewers are correct in that there is a lot of jumping. While it's true that you don't HAVE to jump, I want the most out of my workouts and if I don't jump, I lose the difficulty. That said, I think the jumping/twisting combos aggravated a previous lower-back injury. Nothing horrific, but I was sore for a couple days. Just for clarification, the DVD didn't injure me, I injured myself because I have a weak back. I loved the exercises in this video and, once my back feels a bit better and I start incorporating more back-strengthening exercises into my routine, I will be using this DVD again. Just be careful if you have/had issues with your lower back.

By circuit 6 my legs are begging to stop and feeling shaky, I've found it to be the hardest circuit.  I really like that some of the moves really jack my heart rate up and then the next move will let me recover, it's kind of like fartleks in running or swimming and the random increased intensity is great for your metabolism!

What I did not expect was how awesome this workout dvd turned out to be.  I got this the first week of Jan2013 and my body has absolutely transformed since then.  My legs are much more strong and toned, my endurance has improved and I can feel my metabolism increased.

The most amazing thing is that when I first started, I did 3 circuits and I thought I would die so I had to stop.  Now I can finish the entire dvd (although the mat-work is still really tough for me) and I actually pumped my fist in the air when I finished that (incredibly horrific) walking planks segment.

I found the trainer to be encouraging and motivating as well.  It is absolutely true when she says you don't know how strong you are until you push yourself.

I would suggest a good mat for the mat-work and a good pair of supportive sneakers. There is quite a bit of jumping and you don't want to injure your knees by having poor feet support.  Also have a towel handy because you will sweat. A lot.

It is somewhere between intermediate and advanced, offering a serious aerobic challenge without the same level of intensity as the previously mentioned programs.  A lot of the plyo I recognize from Insanity is present in the Banish Fat program, but there are fewer upper back exercises, and the tempo is more moderate.

I combine calorie counting and this very workout DVD I bought my girlfriend a couple of years ago.  What's the worst thing that could happen?

Holy friggin mackerel, I lost weight!!  And I'm looking better as well.  As all of the other reviews have stated, this workout is no joke!  I usually pause between each circuit to take a sip of water and catch my breath but the more I do it, the better my endurance gets.  I've only been at it for about two weeks and I've lost about 7 lbs.  Combine this with a better diet and there is no way you won't lose weight!  If it works for me, it'll work for anyone.  Just don't do this and woof down 4 slices of ultra-mega supreme pizza w/ extra everything!  Better eating habits really need to be practiced to maximize your weight loss ability.

3717632,5,B001NFNFN0,"I have been alternating Insanity, The Firm Wave, and Jillian's Extreme Shed and Shred for the past several months but was starting to get a little bored, so I bought this video to add to the mix.  I just finished it for the first time, and according to my heart rate monitor, I burned about 500 calories AND it went by fast.

I really enjoyed how each circuit had a ""theme"" (ie., kickboxing, old school calisthenics, floor/core work, and plyo).  My only complaint is that it seemed she doesn't explain the moves quite as well as she usually does.  For example, I had a hard time ""feeling"" the side leg raise/oblique crunches, and she doesn't specify whether to keep your leg straight, whether you should be trying to crunch directly to the side or more at an angle, etc.  Like I said, this is the first time I have done the video, so I think this issue will resolve itself the more I do the workout.

I paused it after the warm up to do some additional stretching, but I may not pause it the next time I do this work out, because she does a very good job easing you in to intense cardio.  In fact, during the first circuit, I was thinking, ""I hope this gets harder,"" but don't worry--it does!

This workout is definitely worth the $7 I paid for it and more!  I bought the instant version, and since you don't need equipment for it, I think it will even be a good cardio hotel room workout for when I am traveling.

Just like the 30-Day Shred, this workout will kick you where it hurts.  BUT, it'll feel so good, you'll come back for more.  I will say that this workout could have been much, much more difficult if I hadn't been familiar with some of the moves from the Shred.

This is a cardio workout, designed, as the title implies, to burn fat and increase the metabolic rate. It incorporates kick-boxing, calisthenics and standing versions of traditional core moves. Unlike most of her other workouts, this one does not involve any mat work or weights. I definitely feel like I get a good cardio workout when I do these exercises. As she usually does, Jillian offers strategies to increase the challenge of several of the moves, so that people can advance with the workout.

Many of the moves are very similar if not the same as the ones in P90X and Insanity. This isn't necessarily a bad thing -- they're there because they work! -- but it still feels different enough that I can rotate different workouts without getting too bored. Also, the more you do this, the more your cardio improves, the more of the moves you can do, and then you can modify to make them more challenging, the more your cardio improves, and so on...

I have done it twice so far and it is tough, but I love how it really pushes me.  If I don't see results after doing this workout consistently than I will be INCREDIBLY shocked!

This is right up there with P90x's Plyo workout except she takes no breaks between rounds.  (P90x's Plyo has 30 second breaks between rounds) This is jump training and old school calisthenics at it's best.

I would not recommend this workout unless you've done one of her other workouts or are in fairly good shape as it requires strength & muscle control. I've done heavy workouts before and this is up there in toughness, especially since there are no weights involved. If you have higher muscle mass, I would do your own stretching & warmup as I found her warmup to be inadequate for legs. The hardest circuit is number 6, other than that, everything is very doable and you can make it easier or harder depending on your level. I alternate between this, shred, & ripped, and since starting this workout, I've noticed an increase in strength and durability when doing the shorter workouts.

I am currently sprinkling this workout into every 3 days of 30 Day Shred and it's a nice change of pace and a great challenge!

I was slightly concerned when I read some of the reviews of athletic people having trouble with this video but decided to go ahead and try it.  This video is extraordinary!  Even with my little knowledge and inflexibility I was able to do this video.  It is broken down into segments which make it easy as well as an option to do the video with commentary/music and without.  The first day I was only able to do the warm-up.  I'm easily 100 pounds over weight so this was an accomplishment for me.  For a week I then did just the workout and the first segment along with the cool down.  I'm working my way into doing more and more segments.  Even though my movement isn't perfect at least I'm moving.

I hate doing exercise videos and feeling that I didn't break enough of a sweat (which happens to me with 30DS, Ripped in 30, 6 week 6 pack, Turbo Jam workouts, and Biggest Loser Cardio Max) But that is not the case here..

I like the variation of different moves from kickboxing to calisthenics to plank work. The variety helps to keep me interested.  I also like that the moves are simple enough, no fancy footwork or arm moves as with some other videos.  I have been doing this video for some time now once a week (along with other workouts) and still am tired by the end.

3717709,5,B001NFNFN0,"First of all -  I believe this is the best priced cardio DVD out there. There are other good ones, Amy Dixon, Cathe, Insanity, etc, but they tend to be more expensive. Value for money, this is the best, in my opinion.

I have been doing this workout now once a week for several months. I did 30 day shred then was looking for something more intense and longer so I purchased this and NMTZ. I currently do NMTZ( or Cathe's muscle max)  3 times a week alternating with cardio 3+ times a week - BFBM, breathless body, and others or running. I am 5'3 and 146 pounds, I've lost about 7 lbs since I started this regime and am a lot more toned. Gone from size 8 to 6. I  try to eat healthy but have trouble staying on low calorie diets. I'm sure if I had more will power (and didn't manage a restaurant/bar!) I would have lost a lot more.

Things to mention :
1. Easy to follow, basic exercises that work
2. customizable -  You can amp up the workout over time - When I started, doing the workout as stated was hard enough but now I need to do a bit extra and it's easy to do that. For example, the kickboxing sets are quite easy- but you can double time those, add hand weights, do extra reps (she does quite a bit of pause and talking between exercises, I keep going until next exercise actually starts) For the jumping jacks, I do air jacks, and I always do the full burpees as fast as I can. Once you're conditioned to all the jumps with good form those can go higher and faster as well.
3. Doesn't take up much space, no equipment needed.
4. Good results
5. I think the sets are well laid out. For example set 1 is easy.. but it's kind of the warm up set. And set two is very hard if you do full intensity, set 3 and 4 takes it down a bit but maintain intensity, set 5 is your break again and set 6 is very hard and set 7 is  your easier cool down abs set
6. I like that it's pure cardio, no weights sets, which is actually hard to find these days.
7. The kickboxing segment is well... a little silly. She's telling you it's a fighting move while she's having you ""uppercut"" the ceiling in a move that bares only a very passing resemblance to an uppercut. My mma/muay thai trained fiance occasionally mocks me when he sees me doing this. But I just say ""hey - it's for fitness not fighting"".... and the moves are slow, but again, I just pick up the pace, use correct form and add intensity.
8. The background girls don't always look as though they are pushing themselves. I would have liked one of them to model a higher intensity option.

There are a lot of comments in the reviews on the jumping and knee ankle problems. And I agree if you want the full benefit of this workout, you need the jumping or it's just not going to be that hard. So if that's a problem area, this may not be the dvd for you. However, I have had knee and ankle issues in the past, still when I run farther than 3 miles my knees and ankles start to hurt. I have never had a problem with 6 months of doing this DVD. I make sure I focus on soft landings, have good shoes, when I lived in a house with hardwood floors, I always jumped on a folded in half yoga mat. (Keeps down the noise and easier on the body)

All in all - I love this DVD, it works, I can stick with it. I still sweat and still feel it every time .",1341187200,6,3289,4.032208588957055

It was really difficult when I first started, and I could barely manage to get through the first 20 minutes. However, now I'm able to get through the entire 45 minutes. It's still challenging, and I have yet to advance to some of the more complicated moves that she gives, so I think it was well worth the ~$8 that I spent on this.",1340236800,,567,4.201834862385321
3717711,4,B001NFNFN0,I have had this DVD for 3 or 4 years now and it never gets old or easy. Jillian is great and really pushes you to keep going. I Can't give it 5 stars only because I have back issues and she doesn't offer modifications for any of the moves really. For kicking moves I just substitute jum The results I have gotten from this DVD alone are great. Strong absdddtoned long and lean look with no bulk what so ever!!

Tonight was my 4th crack at this DVD, and it's still as difficult as the first time.  Jillian provides a non-stop, sweat-inducing, and heart-thumping program that has made me stop multiple times to catch my breath, but leaves me proud as hell when I finish.  I don't find Jillian annoying at all.  Rather, she is highly motivating.  Weigh in is in 2 days, and I'm anxious to see if incorporating this DVD into my week makes a difference.  I'm sure it will; I'm sore in places Ripped hasn't touched.",1340150400,2,715,4.330827067669173
3717723,1,B001NFNFN0,This would be a decent video if Ms. Michaels voice could be deleted!! It's incredibly grating and annoying. Plus she give horrible cues and is very condescending to her viewers! If you are going to spend the money go with The Firm's workouts or Kathy Smiths.,1339977600,8,258,4.630434782608695
3717724,4,B001NFNFN0,"Like a lot of people here, I find Jillian's circuit-training style tough on the knees when doing it at home as opposed to on a sprung gym floor, so I bought a good quality, wide rebounder (mini trampoline) and do a lot of the exercises on that. Seems to work really well, reducing impact on my joints and also noise.  Also adds to core strengthening when doing exercises like Standing Pike and Side Bends as the instability makes the excercises harder and is good for balance / core. For anyone considering one, get one with 8 legs, foldable and wide as possible to do jumping jacks, skiing etc. Jason Vale sells good ones and they're are different ones on Amazon too. Avoid really cheap ones as just not worth it.

Back to the DVD! It certainly is tough and you'll feel you've worked your butt off (literally!). Would highly recommend it and I have tried a lot of other people's but always kept up my gym membership too as felt I needed it. Since discovering Jillian, I've cancelled ithat and saved a small fortune. I just rotate round hers.

The only two minor negatives are that I'd prefer the music to have a beat and for her to do the exercises to that beat so I could keep in time without having to watch the screen (sometimes not always easy like when doing Mountain Climbs and Burpees).  Also, like others, I find it a bit tedious that Jillian doesn't do the same number of reps on each side but I get round that with counting. Hopefully she might address these points in future DVDs as the music and reps seem to be an ongoing theme.

Oh, also that blatant ad for Oral B on the 'bonus' material is pretty shameful for someone of Jillian's provenance when folk would have preferred to have a few more tips on healthy living.

One question I have is whether these kinds of exercises bulk up thighs (the last place I want to bulk up!). Jillian's Girls are incredibly toned but seem to have bulky thighs. Anyone have a view?",1339891200,2,1929,4.419718309859155

some of the exercise's i wasn't able to do because im so out of shape but i plan on being able to if it kills me, the only thing i didn't like was she didn't give you any breaks for us out of shape chicks to catch our breaths..",1338768000,2,616,3.8125
3717730,4,B001NFNFN0,"Banish fat is perhaps the most amazing work out DVD out there. It does exactly what it promises, to give you a good workout. Jillian guides us through the exercises really well and I don't understand what the fuss is all about her talking. I did not think it was irritating neither did I think she spoke too much.

If you wanna sweat it out and you wanna lose the pounds then get this one. I've been using it less than a week and already my clothes feel a little looser. btw, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because she worked me so hard that my back hurts a little. ya, its the lazy in me who stopped me from giving her 5 stars..",1337904000,,643,3.9844961240310077
3717731,4,B001NFNFN0,"I own most of Jillian's DVDs, and I really like her approach. I love the way she encourages me and tells everyone that even very heavy out of shape people can get healthy and fit. It's because of her encouragement that I have stuck with a consistent workout program for three months and have gotten the most fit and toned that I've ever been in my life, at 35 years old, and I'm proud of it. With that said, her workouts are no walk in the park, and I think this is the hardest one of all the ones I've tried. It is 40 minutes of nonstop, high impact cardio. The DVD doesn't warn you that it's all cardio either, and that's unusual for her, because normally she breaks her workouts down into short strength/cardio/ab circuits. I've done this video once, and I was only able to complete about half of it. I've already done her 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, No More Trouble Zones, and The Biggest Winner DVDs, and this one has them beat by a mile in terms of difficulty. However, cardio is my weakness, so other users may find this one easier than I did. So I'm going to come back to this video after I work on my cardio more with my spin bike and other less challenging DVDs.",1337817600,,1172,4.213333333333333

But in those 45 minutes, my ass was kicked with a 6 lots of circuits repeated twice.  I like the fact much of the core exercises were done standing up!  But I was not a fan of the flank core circuit!  Break into a sweat with you and you can modified it if you are not fully unto the speed and full motion.",1337385600,,455,3.9130434782608696
3717744,5,B001NFNFN0,"This workout video is great, and will really make you work hard. It's a nice curcuit combination of cardio, kickboxing, and strength training using your own body. I'd say I'm intermediate on working out, and it challenges me but isn't so impossible I feel like a total idiot. There are some advanced moves, so it's nice that as I progress, I can try new stuff. Jillian is motivational as always! One complaint is that if you turn off her instruction and just want music, the music completely sucks. But that's not a big deal...I can just turn on my iPod. This is my first JM video, and I will definitely check out some of her others.",1336521600,,633,4.4655172413793105
3717745,5,B001NFNFN0,"This is a tough workout and definitely not for people with knee problems.  I would recommend this workout to anyone looking for a challenge.

3717746,5,B001NFNFN0,This video is great. She makes you work hard and make you feel good about yourself during it. I have had it for about a month now and I already feel stronger.

When an exercise is too hard for me I pick one that I know but that is lower impact and keep my heart rate up, all the same. If you like The Shred, you'll love this.",1335225600,3,342,3.9
3717748,4,B001NFNFN0,"This is by far the best workout dvd I've tried. I've used this with my heart rate monitor on and when I do the entire work out I can burn up to 600 calories. It is tough to get through the first few times but the good this is they break it up into chapters so if you only want to do 20 or 30 minutes that day it's easy.

My only issue is there are a lot of jumping exercises and as a person with a knee problem I cannot use this everyday without injury. So my advice to anyone with knee of leg issues is to give yourself a day of rest in between or modify the exercises to do squats instead of jumps (which Jillian actually suggests). Other than they it's great. My endurance has improved 90% since starting this.",1335139200,7,713,3.986013986013986

3717751,5,B001NFNFN0,"I've been doing Ripped in 30 (which I hear is like 30 Day Shred) for the past 4 months. After doing Week 4 of Ripped in 30 the past 2 months, I needed a change and bought this one. I previewed it before actually doing it and thought there was no way I could get through the entire workout because Week 4 of Ripped in 30 cardio still kicks my butt. But I got through it because the entire workout had a nice pace where it made it possible for me to get through it. Don't get me wrong; this workout was challenging and I was sweating like crazy, but I didn't feel like I was doing to die.  It is mostly cardio but she does add in some ab and shoulder work midway through, which is a nice little break. Don't give up; just when you think you can't do anther circuit, do the next one because Jillian gives you a lower impact cardio and then she picks it up again in the next circuit.

I've noticed that in this DVD, Jillian is not so much in-your-face as she is in Ripped in 30, but I think this DVD came out first and she hadn't show her full-blown tough self yet. So if you're want a JM's workout where's she's yelling at you, this isn't it. She's excellent with instructions and giving encouragement, but she isn't the tough, mean trainer you see on the BL.

Also, I've done P90X workouts (I didn't follow the program but I've done most of their workouts), and I feel like I get more out of JM's workouts than any of the P90X's. I sure sweat a heck of a lot more with JM's!",1334620800,,1472,4.068965517241379

It's challenging, there's no equipment required, and if you don't have time to finish the whole workout, you can choose to do certain sets and still get a tough workout.  I always feel like Jillian Michales talks way too much.  The first time you do the video its helpful and motivating, but in the workouts to follow you find yourself being able to quote each and every annoying comment she makes. (i.e. ""Don't phone this in"")  As a workout video I give it five stars, the only reason I would rate it lower for any reason is Jillian talking.

This kept me out of doing any exercising for about 6 weeks. I have never torn a muscle or tendon before, and I am an avid runner and weightlifter. Normally I wouldn't list this as a critique about the movie itself, but I did because I noticed another viewer had the same problem.",1334188800,2,533,4.448979591836735

I started out with 30 Day Shred in February, and since then I've been working on my own at the gym.  I picked up this DVD to add some variety to my workouts, and I LOVE it...but only after I'm done.  For me, this is the perfect challenge--I can keep up with her, but just barely.  She combines plyometrics (jumping), kick-boxing, and core-training (among other things), and the only thing you need is your own body and a mat or towel.  She does get a little rambly, the background music is awful, and the blonde girl in the back has a scary smile, but these pale in comparison to the value of the exercise.  Also, there is little to no coordination needed for these moves.  I usually hate workout DVDs b/c half of the work is just learning the steps.  These moves are very basic and very challenging.  I'm definitely not an expert on anything related to fitness, but after working through it 5 times so far, I'm already seeing it get easier as my muscles get stronger.

I AM SO GLAD JILLIAN'S CAME FIRST!  i didn't want to, but i tried it as soon as i received it in the mail.  (i still haven't even opened bob's, nor do i want to)

First it should be noted, that i am trying to lose weight.  prior to buying this, i was working on my treadmill for nearly 2 months, and i was getting bored, and starting to plateau.  i wasn't enjoying working out anymore.  enter Jillian!!

this workout had me sweating like i hadn't sweat since i first started working out!  I should note also, that had i not been working on my treadmill, i would have never been able to get through many of the circuits, and i did have to stop repeatedly the first time around.

i am now around 3 weeks in, the first week i lost 7 pounds (the video boasts a 5 pound loss in one week) the second week i lost a little less, and now i am back on to the 5 pounds this week.  i am now doing this video every day, and running on my treadmill every other day.  and i have to say, that if i had not gotten this video, i don't know that i would be running.  before the video, i couldn't run for long at all, and i was at the treadmill for 2 months. i stuck to a 10 incline at 3-4 mph because of this.  now i am able to run for 10-12 minutes at a time with a 5 minute up hill 3.5 cool down, and back to running.  i can not emphasize how much this video, and Jillian have changed my life.  i am about to order 30 day shred or whatever it is, and i really look forward to mixing up my Jillian videos!

for beginners, it will take some time, and it is very hard, but the results are immediate, and they are amazing!!  within a week of using this video, i started getting cuts, and curves i haven't seen since before i had my daughter!  my husband is sooo happy!!  as am i, quite clearly. good luck, and have fun!!

I must admit, I've been known to stick to a program for a month or so then fall off the wagon.  Nevertheless, I am back in the swing of things and was really excited to have Jillian kick my butt back into shape.

I started doing her No More Trouble Zones DVD, which is AMAZING for toning and targeting problem areas via strength training with light hand weights.  I just didn't feel as though I was getting the cardio work in that I needed to, in order to really burn fat.  After reading all of the great reviews on Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, I decided to go ahead and give it a try.  I am so happy I did!

It was truly the most difficult cardio work I have done in a very long time, if not ever!  There were multiple exercises in which I had to stop to take a breath before Jillian and her work out instructors were done with the set.

My heart rate was through the roof the entire 40 minutes and I felt so great after it was finished.  My husband commented on the fact that I was ""drenched"", which only made it more clear to me, that this is a great workout.

Anyway, I had Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred for a while and only used it off and on to cross-train when I'm consistently running (I haven't been very consistent lately). The 30 Day Shred is pretty awesome and I was excited to get my hands on something else so after looking through the reviews (boy does she have a lot of reviews!) I selected this. Today, after a grueling and stressful day of school, I decided to skip a class just to do a short workout, eager to try out my new dvd. Well it wasn't long before I was feeling it and even shorter before I was muttering obscenities under my breath lol but in all seriousness, this is a hell of workout! I consider myself in average shape (though I have been in better), at my best I run 30 miles a week, workout consistently, and eat well and at my worst I still workout once a week or so and maintain a committed vegetarian (mostly vegan) lifestyle. Still, within 25 minutes, I was done. I could have definitely kept going but there is something about her workouts in this DVD that make you feel like you're about to die. This isn't really like her 30 Day Shred, the intensity level varies so that it is somewhat possible for you to finish the entire 40 minute trek but it still packs a punch. When she started jumping and prancing around with the plyometric exercises I was less than amused but when I finished the circuit, I felt INCREDIBLY accomplished and that kind of ego-boost is so crucial for maintaining consistency in workouts and healthy lifestyles in general. Long story short, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this video and I'm not one to review many things lol. I will definitely buy another DVD (soon hopefully) as a reward for finishing all circuits. The only thing I will say I didn't like were her two back-up people, they were sooo lethargic and boring. They hardly seemed engaged and at times, they looked downright pitiful. I liked the backups for her 30 Day Shred much much more, they were way more relatable and you could tell they were getting the same workout; these girls look like they're just having a ball -___-. So ya Jillian Michaels bring back the other girls, or anyone else for that matter.",1331510400,,2369,4.460829493087558
3717776,5,B001NFNFN0,"I love this dvd! Not only is Jillian very good at pushing you without annoying you like some other instructors; she shows you how to workout within your boundaries. I hate when instructors say stuff like ""You can do it! Come on! Good job!"" like you are a child who just needs encouragement. Jillian says instead things like ""If you do this, it'll be harder but you'll get a better workout"" or ""If you can't do the jump, give me a squat instead.""
I prefer to be given the option between beginner and advanced - Jillian has 2 girls behind her demonstrating the differences. I find it helpful since I have a fairly strong body but I'm not as flexible as I used to be. It's nice to be able to pick your level of difficulty without having to purchase and watch 3 separate dvds.
There is jumping and jogging in place involved so some of the exercises might not be the best option if you have difficult neighbours living below you or weak knees. I have both and I just keep it in mind, modifying the routines according to my needs.
I get up every day looking forward to it!
Great buy!",1331251200,2,1077,4.310344827586207
3717777,5,B001NFNFN0,"This is my third Jillian Michaels video (started with 30DS).  It's a great workout for when you have a full hour to exercise.  While it's mostly cardio, there are enough strength exercises that you definitely build muscle also.  There are quite a few kick-boxing moves, which I loved but didn't necessarily expect from the description.  Definitely a good addition to a workout video library if you like to exercise at home.",1330819200,,423,4.915492957746479
3717778,5,B001NFNFN0,"Well I'll admit it, I'm a redneck guy who bought a Jillian Michaels workout video.  I had a 3 level fusion in my lower back in Dec 2010 and have been fairly inactive since that time, so I wanted something to help get my metabolism back up and weight down.  P90x seemed too aggressive for what I was looking to do, so I began looking at Jillians tapes and was happy I did.

This video is really good at getting your blood pumping.  It's not geared specifically towards 23 year olds with iron hearts, but an entire age range of people with varying degrees of fitness.  Some of the exercises are tough if you are older and/or have bad joints (or back) but you can very easily modify any set to your comfort level.  I'm 6'4"" and pushing 300 pounds and almost made it through the entire series the first time I tried, I was tired and completely spent but that's good, that's what I'm looking for in a workout.  Once my body gets used to working out again, I look forward to getting 100% out of this video.

Now I've read reviews on other videos by Jillian where people talk about her being arrogant and somewhat self-promoting, but I have found very little of that in this video.  Jillian comes across as very motivated and driven, she's good at keeping you motivated when it starts getting tough, especially towards the end.  That's what you need in an aerobics instructor, not someone who is going to hold your hand.",1330646400,5,1413,4.420849420849421
3717779,5,B001NFNFN0,"I just bought the digital format of Jillian's workout and gave it a try.  Wow!  I got through 3 of the circuits and I had to skip to the cooldown.  I have a moderate level of fitness, so this is a great workout for me to build strength and endurance while getting rid of some pesky pounds.  Jillian shows modifications of the moves to help beginners and people who are at an intermediate level like me.  She gave good instructions and explained form throughout the workout.  I feel very challenged by this workout, and am going to work towards completing the whole thing.  Set your goals high and give this a try.",1330560000,,613,4.419642857142857
3717780,5,B001NFNFN0,"Let me just start this review by saying that, in order to do this workout, you already have to be somewhat in shape. I'm a male in his early 20's and I do this workout as often as I can with my girlfriend who's the same age. We were previously doing the Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred Level 1 workout for 2 months or so before switching to this workout. This workout is WAY more challenging than either of us imagined, especially since my girlfriend was using 10 lb. weights and I was using 20 lb. weights vs. the recommended 5 lb. weights in the 30 day shred level 1 workout. This workout is for those who are already in decent shape so beware if you are just getting into working out as this video will not be appropriate for you. I can say, however, that this is a fantastic workout video that delivers amazing results. Like one user previously stated it is true that you wake up more toned the next morning, but it requires that you push yourself. I want to close by saying that, girls,encourage your significant other to do this workout with you. If he thinks it's for women only he is sorely mistaken as you are both in for the workout of your lives.",1330300800,,1156,4.28310502283105
3717781,3,B001NFNFN0,"I was dissapointed when I tried this workout and was bored of it in the first 30 minutes. I had to take out the DVD because my motivation was almost at zero. I think maybe it was just too slow and easy to keep me going and some of the moves were hurting my ankle, which I had surgery on about 7 months ago. I'm not a huge fan of Jillian, but for fitness' sake, I get over it. I'll try it again, but for now I am not pleased.",1329868800,,424,3.7222222222222223

The workouts in this DVD are very effective and, as Jillian says, blast my heart rate through the roof! (I was at 196 bpm after finishing this DVD, which is about the same as it is when I'm done sprinting.) I also love this DVD because I can do it in my tiny, cramped bedroom. I live on the upper floor, so when we get to a circuit with a lot of jumping, I just use a thick mat or take off my shoes.

I'm very excited to continue this (I plan on doing this 4-6 times a week) and see the results and how it changes my body!",1329264000,,686,3.8652482269503547

If I only want to do about 1/2 hour workout I can pick and choose what I want, but doing the whole thing is too much jumping for me. At 53 years old, my knees just don't do that so well anymore.  Someone younger would love this though. Jillian is great at circuit training and this is no different. I would have given 5 stars but it's not suited for all ages so I gave it the 4.",1329091200,3,447,3.901098901098901
3717785,5,B001NFNFN0,"I have tried a few of Jillian Michaels DVDs in the past but this one is by far my favourite. I have a young baby at home and love the options to either do the full work out or choose circuits. I have weak ankles and fairly bad knees and yet this DVD doesn't affect them at all, some of her others have left me unable to walk. I am not overweight but I am unfit, so I find this is just the right amount of push to get me sweaty and burn some extra calories. I also see a difference in my tummy just after a week of use. I feel pumped and motivated. I do find her back-up girls a bit irritating, but I generally try to ignore them and stick with Jillian. I also find Jillian is less grating in this DVD than she is in others. She feels more supportive and less nagging, ha ha. I would recommend this DVD to anyone just starting out who doesn't have time or money to hit the gym, or for those who fear the gym. No extra equipment needed and you don't need a lot of space to move. Perfect.",1328918400,,985,3.9054726368159205
3717786,5,B001NFNFN0,I honestly never thought I would like this so much. I wasn't a Jillian fan. But I really have come to enjoy her workouts and have actually bought quite a few of her DVDs lately. I preordered the kick boxing video. I could never get into following videos b/c I had 2 left feet. But with her its so simple and  straight forward. I think these will be my life long companion. :),1328832000,4,375,4.136986301369863

3717789,5,B001NFNFN0,I am about 25 pounds over the weight that I would like to be so I decided to buy this DVD so I could work out and sweat obnoxiously in the privacy of my own home. This DVD is such a great price you can't say no to it. I love how Jillian gets you to use your body in ways you didn't even know you could to get your heart pumping. I love how much room I have to grow with this DVD. I am still working my way up to being able to do all of the circuits at once. It is definitely a challenging workout but this is very worth the results. I am on my way to becoming healthier and lighter already!,1327795200,,590,3.6904761904761907
3717790,3,B001NFNFN0,I bought this after successfully completing the Six Week Six Pack video (which i had bought to burn pregnany weight off and it worked great! I feel like I look almost better than before I was pregnant). Well after about 14 weeks of that I plateued- i needed another challenge.. I read a review of this video - and despite my reservations (as it is almost an hr long workout with warm up and cool down..compared to the 35 minutes of six week six pack)- I bought it because everyone says it was so difficult. Well I have done it two days now and I am not sure how I feel. I think it definetely works your legs out hard core- mine are so sore (there's a lot of jumping)-and you sweat.. which i like.. but the focus on the arms i am not so interested in (lots of kick bozing punches) -and then there is only one section on abs (which is my biggest area of concern)- and it is moves mostly that I have seen in Six week six pack (as it relates to abs)- which is fine -they are great moves but i feel like i am beyond the point where those moves could help my ab situation more- i need something harder. I almost feel like you could get just as good of a workout doing the six week six pack in less time because she does a mix of cardio and abs.. but if you are really focused on your legs/thighs- and arms -then this might be the video for you- So it's not a bad video maybe just not what i needed at this point in my workout journey.. I may consider looking for another ab video -maybe pilates or something and alternating days with this to do the fat burn and focus on abs i am looking for.. Jillian is still great and hard core and I think she really understands how to get you in shape!,1327622400,4,1684,4.044910179640719

I think sometimes she talks too much in her work outs, but I have figured out where to fast forward her or where to sneak ahead while she's chatting. This said, other than that annoyance, as long as it burns the calories I can put up w/ anything! Even on days I am sick, I can tone it down a bit and still get a good workout. I LOVE kickboxing and she incorporates this in this video!",1327190400,,440,4.011363636363637
3717793,5,B001NFNFN0,"This is fantastic workout for anyone looking to burn maximum calories in a short amount of time.  This workout is only about 45 minutes from beginning to end which makes it a great morning workout when you are pressed for time.  The calorie burn is great.  Wearing my heart rate monitor and doing the entire workout I burned 355 calories.  This is not an easy workout, but if you put in the work, you get the results.  There is a great blend of cardio and toning throughout the workout.  You also don't get alot of the annoying chatter from Jillian like you do from other workout DVDs.  It's all about the workout and form.  The other thing I love about this DVD is that it requires zero extra equipment and not alot of room to move.  When you are working out at home, that makes a big difference. I would recommend this DVD to anyone looking to get an intense cardio workout with a minimum amount of time.",1327104000,,906,4.345238095238095

I needed something to do at home on days when I couldn't make it to the gym. That said this dvd challenges your cardiovascular system in other ways. Its total body so your always working your legs, arms, or abs while doing the cardio to shed the fat. I can see definition in my abs now and I know its directly related to this dvd. The entire 4th circuit is abs. I have learned to love that circuit! You put in what you give. I wear a heart rate monitor and found that once I learned the moves I was able to really go hard, jump higher, squat lower, do the burpees faster, punch harder, kick higher and really push myself!! - burning even more calories. The 6th circuit is a killer cardio circuit and I dread it but know that its torching the fat. Im All in all Id say go for it. you have nothing to lose but fat!",1327017600,5,966,4.03125

3717796,5,B001NFNFN0,"So, I have never written a review before but this exercise video deserves a review.  You will work hard.  You will sweat.  You may ever offer up a curse or two at Jillian!  I have been doing this for 15 days and can seen definition in my abs and legs.  After the first two days, I whimpered like a baby whenever I had to bend my legs but that feeling went away.  There are 7 circuits in this video and for me, the 6th circuit is the most demanding.  No ""easy"" exercise in that circuit to provide a break.  I have other videos by Jillian and this is my favourite.  I enjoy how she represents herself and the backup ladies are great.  Well, Saleema looks like she thinks it is a walk in the park but the other gal sweats!  I have arthritis in my back and hips and still find this routine VERY manageable.  I feel like I am going to die everytime I do it but when I finish - WOW - such pride in myself!  I really, really, really do not enjoy exercising but I feel that if I am committed to doing it, I want more bang for my buck.  While this video IS twice as long as 30 Day Shred and Ripped in 30, I feel I have invested more because I have committed more time.  Enjoy!  If you are proned to name calling, I suggest not doing this video in front of kids lol",1326672000,,1255,3.96
3717797,5,B001NFNFN0,"As always, Jillian is kicking my ass.  On lazier days, I put on the DVD and say I'll just do 2 or 3 circuits and stop.  I always end up powering through to the end, and that's because Jillian has such a good grip on when fatigue comes into play that right when you need a break (for me, circuit 5) it's a little less intense and gives you the energy to get through to the end.  I like the moves she incorporates and the fact that you can always make an exercise easier or harder.  I've done her other DVDs for a while now and some moves I am still not doing at the 'expert' level.  This makes these workouts have more longevity than the rest; you always have something else to strive for or can switch up.  My abs are the strongest they've ever been, thanks to Jillian's many workout DVDs",1326672000,,788,4.117647058823529

3717799,5,B001NFNFN0,"WOW!  Another good one.  I'm a huge JM fan after her DVDs (and better eating habits, of course) helped me drop the 15 extra pounds of post-pregnancy weight I was carrying around after my second child was born.  And then another 18 more.  I feel GREAT and this video is the perfect example of why.  She keeps you MOVING and it's fun.  I actually LIKE doing the exercises.  I really like her circuit style, as you only do each type of exercise for 30 seconds or so before moving on.  I feel like I can make it through 30 seconds of the ones I hate if I know I get to move on quickly.  LOVE the kickboxing moves in this one.  (If you like those, you'll also like Extreme Shed and Shred.  Looking forward to her kickboxing DVD coming in March.)  I found with this title, the first 3 circuits or so are the most cardio-intensive.  Don't turn it off 20 minutes into it, because she becomes more about toning with little cardio spurts in between for the remaining circuits.  But they still keep my heart rate up and I DEFINITELY don't feel like I've wasted my time at the end.  Give the rest of the DVD a chance - you won't be sorry.

Jillian does talk a lot in this dvd but I knew that going into it...I am not looking to be entertained, just wanting to get in better shape.

Kristin annoys me...she looks like she is trying to out do Saleema. This is not a competition...no need to out do the other. Saleema is amazing but when doing butt kicks, she barely gets her heels passed her knees. Natalie on 30 Day Shred literally kicked her own booty during the butt kicks.

Regardless...my body looks better at 48, than it did at 28 and I am in the best shape of my life.

Jillian Michaels...I am thankful for you!",1326067200,,752,4.2377622377622375
3717802,5,B001NFNFN0,"I bought the Banish Fat/Boost Metabolism, Trouble Zones and this DVD to avoid a repetitive workout regimen.  I do a different workout each day and I believe the results are there.  I feel more toned and therefore, stronger and also my stamina is improving.  She alternates cardio (jumping, burpees, kickboxing, etc.) strength training (with weights for your butt, thighs and arms), and ab work.  My core strength is improving as well.  I generally didn't like plank moves before (because they're hard for me), but they're very effective and worth the effort.  These videos are all about circuits and therefore, nothing is long and drawn out and the workout goes by quickly.  You feel alive!
I think the 3 workouts she offers in the 30 day shred are great because they're 20 minutes long each and kick your butt (the 2nd and 3rd especially).  Anything becomes easier the more you do it, so to avoid a repetitive workout regimen, I alternate this video with the other 2 dvds (Banish and Trouble Zones).  Those have 40 minute workouts, so depending on how much time you have or your ambition level for the day, you can choose what works for you.  I sometimes do workout 2 and 3 from the 30 day shred if I want a longer workout, but each of them will get your blood pumping and you will break a sweat.
I think the key is, with any workout regimen, to mix things up.  I would get bored doing the same dvd everyday and so would my body- it's true that your body develops memory and you will stop seeing results if you settle into the same routine everyday.  The 30 day shred is good to this effect though because you can alternate between the 3 workouts.  So, it's a good way to go if you're only going to pick one dvd.",1325721600,2,1713,4.451923076923077

If you've never done any of her videos previously, then might I suggest you start off with her ""30 Day Shred"" of just jump in like I did almost 3 years ago and really get your body moving!

It took me a few times to be able to do the whole video through without pausing it and I think of myself as fairly in shape. Now I do it the whole way through without taking breaks, but it's still a great workout. It's also a really good length. The whole video is exactly 56 minutes long, but the first 5 are warm up and the last 5 or 6 are cool down, so its 45 minutes of straight circuit training. There are 7 circuits (and a warm up stretching circuit) and it's my favorite workout video so far. I'm looking forward to trying her other videos as well.",1325635200,,735,4.041095890410959

I feel in love with it and it took me months to get all the way through. However, since all these more higher impact cardio videos have came out like insanity and turbo fire this video is too slow for me now. However, as a begginer doing the video it helped me to progress to to tougher workouts like insanity. It was a great start for my journey.

3717807,4,B001NFNFN0,"Jillian's Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism is a very good workout for all levels.  She provides modifications for newbies and states if something is difficult try the best you can and work up to it.  The Burpies were probably the hardest for me at this time but it was still worth trying.  There are no lunges in this video that puts extra stress on the knees for those who have weak quadriceps muscles--you will makes these stronger later on so don't worry.  I liked this video because it implemented more of Jillian's kickboxing background with jabs, crosses, hooks, and kicks.  It was also very fun to do.  This will get your heart rate up but there are moments where she does give you a small break when transitioning to different positions.  There is alot of core work in this video and you might feel a little sick at first (that's lactic acid building up in your body and that's normal--if you puke that's okay too :) once's it's gone is gone and you can get back to work) :)",1324857600,3,978,4.46067415730337

30-second circuit intervals.  The moves are TOUGH, but as soon as you think you have to give up, Jillian says, ""Okay, just 5 more seconds,"" and you can push through it.  So there are 5 or 6 moves that range from super hard to slightly recovery mode, and then the circuit is repeated.  It truly makes it feel easier to finish each set.

Recovery moves.  Jillian inserts moves that allow you to recover slightly at just the right moments.  Just don't think that they floor circuit is all recovery; it's NOT!

Move modification for knees.  It is important to note that you don't have to jump all the time.  Jillian tells you to just squat or step until you can move to jumping.

The bad stuff:

Missed instructions.  There are some moves that Jillian completely skips introducing to you, so you are caught off-guard and have to watch a few times before figuring out what to do.  An example would be the reverse crunch move where you step back with your arms raised and then pull your knee up while pulling your arms down, alternating legs.  She jumps right into that without explaining what you are going to do.  There are others.

The quad stretch at the end.  WTH??  This is hard on my good knees!  Why would she prefer that stretch to the standing quad stretch?  She does it on other DVDs, too.  I just skip that, and do the standing quad stretch on my own.

All in all, this is an excellent workout!  My face has never been more red and I've never had so much sweat drip into my eyes until this DVD.  I'm in good shape now, but have dropped a pant size (so far!)... I wonder how much more as I continue this??",1324425600,3,1627,4.325581395348837
3717810,5,B001NFNFN0,"I love this dvd! I have some of Jillian Michaels videos and I have loved them all!!! I was covered in sweat!  I don't think I have ever sweated that much. If you like Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30 you would probably like this one.  This dvd is all cardio.  You need to cardio in order to lose weight.  Yes, building muscle helps but you need to lose the fat on top of it. I thought that this would help and it did.  My younger sister(14 years old) also did this with me. She does sports during the school year and she thought she was in pretty good shape.  She thought wrong. She was on the floor panting like a dog. Yes, it may be hard but then she was doing the advanced version as hard as she could. I suggest to try the beginner version first and then if you need a harder challenge, do the advanced.  If you stick with this, it will help you lose weight.  I believe that my sister lost 5 pounds in ther first week.... just like the dvd promised(I think!) I definitely enjoy doing this dvd and I know that my sister does too. I would recommend this to people of all ages but I will warn you. It can be hard on the knees and the wrist as you are jumping around a bit and there are tons of plank positions that you do. Make sure you don't push yourself too hard otherwise you could injure yourself.",1324252800,,1300,4.070588235294117
3717811,5,B001NFNFN0,"Most of Jillian's fans came to this dvd circa its 2009 release date, but I just became a Jillian convert 5 months ago, using BFBM, NMTZ, 30DS and SIWW.  I had never before seen an episode of The Biggest Loser, so I had no idea what to expect. I just knew her reputation as a tough trainer.

Since it matters, I will say that I have been losing weight for over a decade. That's right - 11 years, to be exact. No gastric bypass or any other magical surgery.  I got my butt to the gym and JUST DID IT!  (Previously I was swimming laps for weight loss, but because it is not a weight bearing exercise, once you plateau, swimming's effectiveness is over. I would do laps for over an hour and it was getting me nothing but bad headaches. But swimming is still a good kickstart for someone who is overweight.)  I started out on the elliptical and went low carb. I began walking 2 miles, then 3, then 5, now it's up to 10 if I want.  I'm a Zumba instructor and a hiker.  While I am no longer 300 lbs, 88% body fat (some crazy high number when they tested me at a gym long ago) and a size 28/30, I'm still not a skinny girl.  It has taken me a LONG TIME to lose the weight, but that's a good thing - this was more of a commitment than I ever knew, and once you get to the 5th year and it's not all done with, you realize you've committed to a lifestyle change, and not just to losing the weight.  After the Zumba convention this year I hit yet another plateau.  Someone mentioned 30 Day Shred in a Facebook group and I went with it!

All of that to let you know that I am not a size 10, yet I am very physically capable, my only real limits being lower back and knee issues if I am not careful.  So...BFBM is challenging for me, every time.  I don't get through it as fast as they do (45+ mins) because I need longer breaks to allow my lower back to rest, otherwise my muscles tense up and my back will go out.  I'm still challenging myself, still working at an increased pace, still sweating, but always remaining tuned into my body or else face consequences.  If you have lower back issues, I suggest you do the same.  However, out of all of JM's workouts that I have done so far, this one is the most lower-back and knee-friendly.  There's impact but no lunging, which typically bothers my knees.  Many of the ab moves are standing rather than mat work - still challenging, but not stressing.  There are some great kickbox moves, which I love.

Overall, I skip only a couple of exercises in BFBM.  Anything ski-like is bound to stress my lower back, so I skip those.  But you'd be surprised how much you can do, even if you're overweight to begin with.  Do not let plank moves such as mountain climbers and oblique twists intimidate you - they are challenging at first, but if you keep pushing yourself, you will increase your abilities.  Do what you can at first, and do not give up!  If you keep at it, your body will become accustomed to it and eventually you will actually find some of these moves pleasurable.

I like Jillian's interactions with the other girls, and ""instructor speak"" in most of her videos.  She's a fun personality overall, and she's encouraging.  ""Push yourself. Don't phone it in.""  The other girls provide modified moves for beginners as well as the advanced ""kickass"" version of the moves.  No one is left out here.  I'm not saying it's going to be easy at first - it wasn't easy for me, and I can do hours of Zumba with no problem, and hike and walk several miles.  It's just a different kind of workout, very intense, little rest, always moving.

Try it and keep at it.  Do not give up - you will see changes in your body right away, and you will keep losing weight/getting fit as you progress because you will be able to do more, faster, better, quicker within months.  With Jillian's dvds I beat yet another plateau, and people comment that they notice my weight loss, even if it has only been a month since they last saw me.  But you cannot just do BFBM for the rest of your life - mix it up with other workouts to keep seeing changes.",1324166400,9,4062,4.23667100130039
3717812,5,B001NFNFN0,"This is a pretty tough workout, I am fairly fit and I find it a challenge. There is a warm up, cool down, and 7 circuits.  This makes for a pretty long workout so sometimes I just pick and choose 4 of the circuits depending on my mood :) I like that no equipment is necessary so nice when you are away from home. My only complaint like others have said is how long the lead in to the work out itself is, but I just fast forward through it. Sometimes I hit play while I am still tying my shoes, that way it's ready when I am. She is really good about explaining why good form is important to avoid injuries, and there are no exercises on here I haven't seen before, so I am not sure what others are concerned about as being injury causing?  You know your own body, if you have problems with knees, hips or ankles, keep the impact down. Just because she doesn't show a modification doesn't mean you cannot use your best judgement. If it causes you discomfort don't do it. Maybe you won't burn quite as many calories doing a heel dig vrs a jumping jack, but if you have bad knees, who cares??

3717832,4,B001NFNFN0,"This is one of my favorite workout videos because it's very easy to do and incorporates a lot of plyometric moves into the workout.  I mean it's very easy to do as in you don't need extra gym equipment, your own body weight is used throughout the workout, and you don't need a whole bunch of space (maybe 8 ft by 3 ft).  I have a small aparmtent, so I don't have a ton  of space.

With that being said, the actual run time on this DVD is 45 minutes rather than 40.  Jillian and her workout partners are very motivating.  Just pop on itunes in the background and the workout goes by pretty quickly.  The workout also can be challenging.  There are 7 circuits, and each circuit is repeated before moving onto the next one.  The circuits incorporate ab moves, jumps, squats, kickboxing moves, and miscellaneous moves such as burpees and skaters.  One area they could've improved on with this DVD is incorporating more upper body.  Jillian does have push-ups in some of her other videos.  The arm moves she does (punches), really don't do anything for my arms and I even use 2 lb weights per arm,  Maybe I should buy a pair of 5 lb boxing gloves haha, maybe the fighting moves will work then. :)

I have also owned this DVD for at least 2 years, so I've grown accusomed to how many reps are done for each exercise.  That does help motivate me to finish strong.  I enjoy doing this video when I'm too tired to workout right after work (12 hour shifts can kill you), or when there is bad weather outside.  The cardio will make you sweat and by the time the 6th circuit rolls around, I have to really motivate myself to get through that one.  But it's all worth it.

3717833,5,B001NFNFN0,I am a fan of Jillian's workouts. I find they are easy to follow along to and easily modified for a beginner. I would consider myself at an intermediate level and I was definitely feeling this workout in a major way. I find that Jillian uses the simplest and most basic moves/exercises and no fancy equiptment - just your body and your own resistance. I find that it is doable because you do each exercise for about a minute or so and then move on to a new one. She has you do three exercises two times and then moves to a new circuit. I am a strong believer that this high interval intensity training is the key to weight loss and boosting your metabolism. (Hence the name!) I do not think you should shy away from this workout. Don't expect to do it all if you are just starting out - you will definitely get there after a few wks of practice.

3717842,5,B001NFNFN0,"I love Jillian's workout videos.  I  have the 30 day shred, no more trouble zones, and banish fat, boost metabolism
I love all three of them for different reasons.

30 day shred is great for days when you don't feel like working out.  You can tell yourself you'll just do a short workout and use this video.  I couldn't do the video in 30 days though.  More like several months.

No more trouble zones is great because it does circuits and the menu tells you what parts each circuit works.  It is more of a toning video than a cardio video.

Banish fat boost metabolism is cardio and toning without weights.  The circuit menu, though, I don't like.  It just tells you what circuit you're on, not what body parts you're working.

Another thing that I don't like is that the workout times on the cover are not accurate.  30 day shred is 22 minute workout, no more trouble zones and the banish fat one are 50 minutes.  This is including the warmup and cool-down.  I think that's very important because for me, how much time I have dictates which one I use sometimes.  The workouts are very hard, but they definitely give results.

3717844,5,B001NFNFN0,"Contrary to what other reviewers have said, this workout is NOT for beginners!!!  On week 2, I ended up spraining my ankle pretty badly while doing those evil 180 jumps!!!!  I learned my lesson pretty quickly; after I recovered, I went back to 30 day shred until my core was strong enough to complete the workout safely.  Please know your endurance/exercise level before you begin this workout!

Even if are at an intermediate exercise level, I recommend that you get the 30 day Shred or Ripped in 30 first and feel like you can do (at least) Levels 1 and 2 before progressing to this workout. Why?  Because: 1.  You'll have some endurance to do a 45 minute INTENSE aerobic workout; 2.  You'll have already done some of these moves already and be familiar with them; and  3.) You can modify some of the more intense moves with exercises from her other videos.  Take it easy at first... if you can't do one exercise, jumping jacks or running in place is better than quitting.  And give yourself permission to pause the DVD if you are feeling like your heart is about to explode/you're feeling lightheaded.

Keep in mind that this video is not 40 minutes as advertised... the clock time runs just under 55 minutes.  You are pouring sweat after circuit 2, and feel like you have climbed a mountain after completing the DVD.

After 3 months, I alternate this video and No More Trouble Zones daily, 5 times a week.  I have lost close to 10 lbs without really dieting.  And my muscles (particularly my quads) are well defined and toned.

You can do it!  I finally did!",1312675200,3,1562,4.541218637992832

So I tried this DVD and fell in love with it. Now I do prefer Zumba as my staple, the music helps you go for the whole hour and it's so fun. But I could tell that I was feeling just a little stronger at Zumba after I started doing this DVD. So now I do Zumba three times a week and Jillian's two to three times a week.

I did the entire workout, but modified some of my moves, I cannot do the burpees for the love of god! they kill your knees, I ended up doing pushups during that time. I also had to stop 3-4 times and take a breather. This is intensive!! I am somewhere between a beginner and an intermediate exerciser. I started working out full time 3 months ago. I would recommend trying 30 day shred for a month and then trying this one out. If you are beginner, then watch out, this is not for you. I hated Jillian's constant jibber jabber, next time, I will make sure to turn it off.

30 Day Shred
6 Week 6 Pack
No More Trouble Zones
Ripped in 30

This is a great cardio workout. I purchased it on iTunes so that I could use it when I travel, which is great because you don't need weights. There are 6 circuits and you do everything in each circuit twice. By Circuit 3, I wondered if I would make it, but Jillian does a good job of pacing the difficulty so that you can finish.

If you're looking for sculpting, look elsewhere, especially for upper body. With that said there is a great Core circuit on this video, as well as great exercises for your quads (think sumo squats, squat jumps, etc.).

She incorporates a lot of kickboxing, so if you like that, you will definitely like this video.

Others have said that this is too difficult for beginners. I agree - beginners should start with 2-3 circuits in a session and work their way up. But if you're comfortable with even just low level Jillian Michaels workouts, I would expect you to be able to at least finish it.

Most of the moves look easy but doing them for a long time, especially if you are over weight and out of shape, become hard to do very quickly.
I was afraid to do any of her videos because I was worried that she would scream at me while working out like she does on her shows but she is actually very encouraging. I love it when after the cool down she sits there and tells you how much that work out (if you are diligent) is going to change your life and how worth while it is.

She keeps you moving the whole time with the exception of one or two exercises that help you to lower your heart rate while still burning fat, or ""active recovery"" as she calls it.

I also like the way the circuits are laid out because it makes the workout go by fast. The first circuit is pretty easy and is a nice easy transition from the warm-up to the actual workout. The second circuit is like a punch in the face compared to the first! This is where you really get sweating and breathing heavy. The 180 jumps are killers! The third is pure cardio and provides an active recovery from the second circuit. The fourth circuit is all on the floor and works your core. It's no joke and gets you sweating even more. The fifth circuit is the easiest in the entire workout. It's a breather from working your butt off in the last 3 circuits. The sixth circuit gets you back into the high intensity moves Jillian is known for. You'll be dying by the end of it, and your quads will be burning because there are a ton of jumping/squatting moves. The seventh and final circuit is intermediate - not easy and not hard, but does leave you finishing the workout breathing hard. When I'm done with this workout, I feel amazing, and you will too! And as far as results go, I do this workout 7 days a week, and have lost about 10 pounds in 1.5 months.

Although I've gotten too familiar and bored with some of the moves (that happens with all video exercise workouts I do frequently), Jillian's Banish Fat: Boost Metabolism really gets the job done, no matter how many I times I work out to it. There's a lot of jump work and what I believe they call plyometrics, which is effective in getting your heart rate up. I always sweat up a storm after doing this work out (and that doesn't happen with my other workouts with other instructors). Jillian cues very well and gives helpful instructions. I like the fact that you have the option of playing the workout in its entirety or playing it by circuit, which I always do. Even though the circuits break up the workout, it lets you pace yourself better and vary the workout. For example, I always vary the order in which I do the circuits (there are 7 total) to prevent boredom. Circuit 6 is the hardest. Circuit 2 is pretty challenging also. As with any workout, you can make it as hard or as easy as you want.  And as Jillian reminds us during circuit 5, ""Don't just phone it in"". In other word, put forth maximum effort and really concentrate on getting the full benefit out of every moves. You can make circuit 6 and the other circuits more intense by squating down lower on the jumps, this raises your heart rate even further, and you will feel the burn in your legs and quadricep muscles. Jillian also offers a few modifications on some of the moves to increase or decrease the intensity.
My favorite moves in this video are the burpees?? in circuit 2 (its the first move), the mogals in Circuit 7, which really work your oblique stomach muscles, and a lower abdominal move in circuit 4 which involves you lying down while you raise both arms and legs to above your belly button.
Finally, I would like to say that the circuits are well-organized. There are about 4-5 moves in each circuit, and each move is performed twice. This allows you to prepare yourself better for the execution of each move.

3717867,4,B001NFNFN0,"I've been doing JM's DVDs for about three years now: 30 Day Shred How To Win By Losing (HTWBL) box set combined with yoga running and cycling. I work out about an hour a day. I needed a bit of variety so I chose this one. It's a good step up from the aforementioned DVDs and almost couldn't get through it the first time I did it. I was out of breath most of the way through. Make sure you drink enough water beforehand, because you will sweat a bucket load. Also, like the other reviewer, I also injured my hamstring during the toe touching in the warm-up the second time I did it, which I found really annoying. Also, it stiffened my lower back a little. So now I stretch a little or do some yoga moves before the workout to make sure I'm warmed up enough because it's one hell of a crunch.
Arm circles are introduced in this workout and are a much more soothing warm up for the shoulders which seem to take most of the strain in HTWBL. There's a lot of jumping, which will be a problem for people with bad knees or those living in apartments. You have to have very understanding neighbors.
I love JM's DVDs. A few months after I started them I got comments from everyone about how great I looked. I really toned up. The only area not really covered by Jillian is the ""bat wing"" problem. There aren't enough press ups in any of her workouts but you can tack 10 on the end of this DVD. The DVD is about 50 minutes long, but prepared to push yourself. There's no counting in this DVD as the circuits are timed; it's unnerving not to know how many moves you've got left to do in a circuit! I liked being able to know that I had 30 or 20 of each move to do with a difficult workout like this (it's twice the length of 30 day shred) so, after a few tries, I started counting in order to be able to cope.",1302998400,,1800,4.0875706214689265

It is great on rainy or cold days or when I just don't feel up to running. This dvd is not for beginners but I encourage anyone to try it. If you keep doing it along with other exercises and healthy eating, you will get stronger. I make it all the way through the video but I'm dripping with sweat and completely out of breath.

3717870,4,B001NFNFN0,"I had never previously done a Jillian Michael's workout DVD before, but I have been using the Biggest Loser Cardio Max and Power Sculpt DVDs for the past three months and they have helped me lose 12 pounds.  I heard that Jillian was tough tough tough so I was excited to move up to the next level and try one of her workouts.

This workout is a series of repeated drills that are all about cardio and really work every bit of your body from your quads to your abs to your arms.  I really enjoyed some of the kickboxing moves because they worked every muscle group.

Honestly, I couldn't believe that I made it through the entire 50 minute warm up, workout, and cool down without stopping!  (For me, slightly overweight at 5'3 and 156 pounds who can only run for 20 minutes a time but does workout DVDs 2-3 times a week, that was exciting).  I will say that this DVD is definitely do-able if you like workout DVDs like Biggest Loser and have some muscle strength.  Even beginners can use this DVD because you can start small and work up to doing more and more of the moves.

I thought Jillian was very professional in this one but the girls behind her are very robotic-like and intimidating.  I really enjoy the Biggest Loser DVDs because they feature real contestants from the show instead of bikini models.  Jillian really kept me going; just when I thought I couldn't go any more she would start counting down and that got me through it.

Overall, I'm excited to try this one for a second time and push myself even further now that I know I can do it.  Biggest Loser Cardio Max works me a lot harder than this which is surprising but this got my heart rate up for an extended period of time, it was fun, and it got me sweating!",1302739200,2,1729,4.318885448916409

3717872,5,B001NFNFN0,"I have been using this DVD in combination with many of Jillian's other fitness DVDs (30 Day Shred, No More Trouble Zones, 6 Week 6 Pack) as well as some from Jackie Warner.  Out of the 8 fitness DVD's I own, I use this one the most (probably about 40% of my workouts have been to this DVD).  In a little over 10 weeks I've lost 19 inches and 13 pounds purely working out at home to my fitness DVD's, so as a system, they are working, but since I use this one the most I attribute much of my weight loss to this particular DVD.

Let me start off by saying that I have had chronic knee problems for years, and when I first bought this DVD I didn't think that my knees were going to be able to handle it.  It includes a lot of jumps, squats, and lunges which usually kill my knees.  However, using 30 Day Shred and No More Trouble Zones as well, I slowly worked up my strength in my knee joints, and now over 2 months later I haven't had any significant knee pain, which for me is a miracle.  However, there are some moves in this video (i.e. the 180's in circuit 2, and the scissor jumps in circuit 6) that I flat out refuse to do (I substitute other moves instead) just because they cause too much slamming of your joints for my personal comfort.  I don't want to risk hurting my knees.  However, there are plenty of other jumping moves in the video that allow me to land softly on my feet that have not caused me any pain.  If you have knee problems, I wouldn't rule this DVD out, but be sure to work on the strength in your leg muscles and work to increase the flexibility in your knee joints before you start this video.

This is probably not an option for people who live in upper level apartments, unless you have understanding downstairs neighbors and/or you are able to coordinate working out during times when your neighbors aren't home.  It involves a LOT of jumping around and I imagine would probably create a lot of noise for those living below you.

This workout is broken up into 7 5-minute circuits, each with 5 moves that you do for 30 seconds each, 2 times through. In my opinion, if I had to order the circuits according to level of difficulty, starting with easiest it would be: Level 5, Level 1, Level 4 (all around the same level of difficulty cardo-wise), Level 7, Level 2, Level 6, Level 3.  Jillian did a great job in organizing not only the individual circuits but the entire workout-she included active recovery in the places where you feel like you're going to die, to keep it from being impossible to get through, but so it is still a tough workout which has you working every second.  In addition, since you are only doing each move for 30 seconds at a time, for the harder moves that are a little more painful to do like the jump squats, its over quickly enough so you're not dying.  I have two Jackie Warner DVD's and she has you doing each move for 1 minute, and I swear a few of those minutes have felt like the longest minutes of my life.  One complaint I have is that each move and circuit moves from one to the next very quickly, so in the beginning it was hard for me to find time to take a drink of water, I'd end up missing some of the moves, but you can of course always pause the video if need be.

As far as Jillian's personality, she is definitely more serious and no-nonsense, but she doesn't come off like a drill sergeant (in fact of all the videos I have of hers, she only gets that way in level two of 6 week 6 pack).  She also doesn't tell you to love the burn and chase the burn, which Jackie Warner does and I find totally annoying.  I don't love the burn, I endure it to get results, and Jillian admits that its hard but encourages you to work through it instead of telling you to love it.  In all of her videos she tries to joke around with the background girls a few times, and they are usually epic fails...but its kind of funny to watch.  One minor complaint I do have is about Saleema, one of the background models.  She has a pretty blank look on her face throughout much of the video and doesn't appear to be working very hard at all, which bugged me at first.  I think at one point in particular Jillian says ""you should be breathing really hard right now!"" or something to that effect, and then it flashes to Saleema and she has this blank smile on her face and is definitely not breathing hard.  Now I just ignore her and if I happen to focus on her face it just makes me laugh.  Ultimately, for me, her personality doesn't matter that much because I eventually just mute the DVD and play my own music.  What matters most is that the workout is effective and gets me sweating and gives me results, which all of her DVD's have to some extent, but this one is definitely the best in my opinion.

I expected to get sick of this workout quickly, but after doing it about 25 times I'm still not sick of it (although the minute I had memorized the moves well enough to get through it without listening to Jillian's voice, I muted it and put on my own music, which makes it more enjoyable for me, not because she's bad, it just gets old hearing the same script over and over again).  Whats better, although I'm now at the point where I don't have to do any modifications, so the moves are easier in some respects, it still gets me breathing hard, covered in sweat, and exhausted every time I do the workout. I especially like the first 3 circuits as they get my heart rate up pretty high by the end of them.  One trick I've learned is that I often will do the first 3 circuits before I do one of my strength training DVD's like No More Trouble Zones just to get my heart up and work a little cardio in to every workout.",1302480000,38,5673,4.1931922723091075
3717878,4,B001NFNFN0,"I recently bought P90X thinking that it would be the hardest thing I've ever tried... Nope.  This workout is still harder than any of the workouts in P90X.  I actually hated the Kenpo video in the P90X series, so I substituted this one and have gotten good results.  It's a good hard, but it relies a lot on plyometric training, which is hard to  adapt to if you haven't ever done it before.  I'm not new to working out - I would call myself a runner who does weight training too.  This 40 min. workout is still harder than any run.  It's just a different way to work your muscles and heart and lungs, which will make you a better athlete all around.  You do have to learn how to drown out Michaels' voice though... she is pretty annoying and it only gets worse the more you watch it.",1302393600,3,784,4.214765100671141
3717879,5,B001NFNFN0,"By far, this is my favorite workout dvd. I just love it and am definitely seeing results. I love the use of plyometrics, and I've found that's exactly what my body needs. I've been maintaining a 50 pound weight loss for a year, but have built my thighs up a little too much. I needed to back off with the weights a little bit on lower body. But I didn't want my legs to go soft again. Enter Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism. I think it's just what some of us women need to work our legs without getting them too bulky.

There's something about this workout that leaves me feeling almost euphoric afterward. I don't know what it is, but I love it. I've not noticed the music, because I play my own. I can still hear Jillian's cues, but the music is so soft, that I've never heard it over my own. I kind of hope she keeps her dvds that way. If she brought in decent music, the cost of the dvds would probably go up. I'd rather just play my own.

Jillian is a great trainer, but I'm afraid she's misunderstanding her audience a bit. We're not taken in by these catchy titles with bs promises. We're taken in by great workouts. I hope she continues building on what she's great at and not try to reach into other areas where she doesn't excel. I think she got the idea with Ripped in 30 to expand on her success (as well as ours) with 30 Day Shred. Now if she would seriously consider Part 2 for Banish Fat Boost Metabolism and No More Trouble Zones, she would have hard core followers for years to come. You do this well, Jillian.

I did 30 Day Shred for 30 days before starting this workout, and know that there is NO way in the world that I could have gone from sitting on the couch to completing this workout in one day.  However, now that I am moderately fit I find the workout challenging and doable.

3717883,5,B001NFNFN0,"I absolutely love this workout.  I own pretty much every possible workout DVD known to mankind.  While some of them are effective they become so boring and repetitive, I never follow through with them.  I love Jillian's up beat and positive outlook.  Plus, these results are crazy.  I'm what you would call skinny-fat. I've recently lost 10 lbs just from changing my diet...I'm 5'2.5 and 116 lbs now, but have quite a bit of fat and my main goal is to slim and tone.  I did the Exercise on Demand, it was only a 20 minute workout, but doing that for a week before my DVD came I think helped immensely condition for the 45 minute cardio workout on the DVD.  I've made it through the entire workout so far, however, today was the hardest by far and I have no idea why!  I have done the full workout 3 days thus far (plus the exercise on demand 20 minute workouts 4 times last week) and already see a huge change in my shape...my arms are smaller, my legs are showing tone and my abs are actually becoming abs!!!  I am obsessed with the workout and I honestly cannot wait to do it again tomorrow!  It kicks my butt and the fast results is what makes me continue with it!  I cannot wait to measure in after a month to show the difference!

This is where I think people should pay attention...if you are not someone familiar with working out or know proper form I would NOT suggest this DVD.  Due to the intensity and the fact Jillian doesn't really talk about proper form even on the modified moves (such as the plank, it's important so you don't hurt your back).  I have read posts that people have hurt themselves.  I know if I would have done this workout a few years ago I would have been a person to hurt myself.  So, just ease into and take your time with it if you are determined to do this workout!

Last thing...I actually have a bad low back and this is the first workout I have done in the last 3 years that has not bothered it!",1301443200,8,1935,4.228882833787466

After reading the reviews about how what a great workout she does, I waited for my copy, and was ready to go to work when I popped it in.
Let me tell you, it is an understatement when this workout is tough! I enjoy running and strength training, but this wore me out! You WILL work up a sweat doing these exercise: burpees (get down, jump to a push-up position, jump back up, repeat), mountain climbs (great on the thighs, get into push-up and just move your legs in and out for a minute) and even the jumping jacks are intense. Your heart rate will be up the entire time, but she eases you into it with her warm up and the cool down is great.
It was so intense for me that I can only do it once a week right now! I hope to move up to a few times a week, but if you're just starting out, don't try to do it all at once. Take your time anad catch your breath. Otherwise fantastic DVD!",1301356800,2,1027,3.9423076923076925
3717885,5,B001NFNFN0,I just did this video last night for the first time.  I had read a good chunk of the reviews before buying it.  The reviews made me think that I may not make it through it the first time through.  I survived with no problem.  Granted I do alot of workout videos including many of Jillian's.  If you can make it through her other videos even the shorter ones then you can make it through this one.  None of the moves are too challenging for an intermediate-advanced person.  I felt thinner already the next day and was not very sore which was a pleasant surprise.  All that I mean is don't be too scared to try/buy it.  I will be doing it at least 2-3 times a week.  And if it were that hard I would dread doing it.  And honestly there is nothing dreadful about it.  It is a great workout that goes by quite fast and there was no one move that I couldn't do.  And don't get me wrong some of her moves in her other videos kill me.  One being the squat with the V-raise.  For some reason that move is just killer to me.  This is a great video to mix in with other videos that have weights.  Sometimes to lost weight your body just needs straight cardio.  It will definitely get me where I want to be for this summer's bikini season!,1301270400,6,1229,4.092436974789916

But like anything else, once you do it enough the workout will become easier and you'll be able to get through it with little to no breaks. I would still recommend this workout. Though I have to warn you that if you have bad knees this is definitely not the workout for you.

I used to work out 5 days a week but now I'm back to work so i will be working out just 3. Still even with a day of rest between workouts my knees hurt. It's really upsetting because i love this DVD and i can literally see my body changing. Any advice? I'm trying not to put pressure on my knees but i don't think it's working.

This dvd is longer (about 55 minutes) but it flies by! It is definitely a great workout and will have you sweating in no time! I was a little worried when some of the reviews said you might not be able to finish the whole workout your first few times, but I was able to. Today is my 4th day with this dvd and, with a little modification of a few moves, I have no trouble getting through the whole thing. And, no, I am not a fitness fanatic, in fact...I have about 15 pounds to lose before I am at a ""healthy"" bmi. Don't get me wrong, this dvd is not easy! But it is paced in a way where you are able to catch your breath and keep going. It's a great workout that really gets you pumped and you will be feeling stronger in no time! As I said, today is my 4th day with the dvd, and I am already down about 2 pounds, and I believe my waist and hips are smaller.

3717905,3,B001NFNFN0,"When this workout started out, I thought it was way too easy. The first circuit, which is kickboxing, was very slow moving and didn't get me moving the way I'm used to. The next couple of circuits upped the intensity some, with the circuit on the floor actually getting me sweating and breathing heavily. But of the several circuits, I really only felt as though I was working hard on two of them. And then there were some moves that I had to modify because they are really bad on your knees. I don't do jump squats, and turning 180 degress to land in a squat is very hard to do correctly, and if you don't do it exactly right, you can really hurt your knees. I'm in an intermediate to advanced level, so that's where I'm coming from. I've worked out much, much harder in other dvds. This one was better than her awful kickboxing dvd but not as challenging as the Biggest Loser DVDs. Typically when doing a new workout, I find that I'm sore in areas I haven't worked before, but I had no trouble getting through this (except in one of the plank circuits), and I don't feel any muscles the next day.

Bottom line: Good for beginners, but watch your knees.",1299110400,4,1154,4.342592592592593

3717907,5,B001NFNFN0,"I bought this dvd based on all of the glowing reviews. However, I hesitated using it due to fear. That's right, fear. Review after review stated how hard it was, how they couldn't finish the whole video despite being fit and athletic. I didn't think I could compete; I believed I was middle of the road athletic wise and was afraid of getting my bottom completely spanked by an exercise video.

I finally sucked it up, drank water and did the video and not only did I finish it (without phoning it in), I loved it. No more complex moves or hours of staring into space on the eliptical nor waiting for the snow to melt so I can run... I can pop this dvd in and get an amazing workout.

The video (thankfully) starts out deceptively slow and builds. If I hadn't been lured in by the calm before the storm, I'm not sure if I would have stuck around long enough to finish the video. I sweat so much and my breathing is enough to blow the house down, but I feel so empowered when I am finished. I feel as though I did an exercise that made a difference rather than doing something physical so I don't feel guilty about not doing something physical. I have done this video twice and it will stay in the front of my video line up along with Ellen Barrett and Jackie Warner. I can't wait to try No More Trouble Zones.

By the way, yes the music is the techno world's version of elevator music but that's not what my mind is on while I'm doing this video... I am focused on breathing and keeping up. Oh and the workout is so intense yet Jillian jumps right into stretching afterward with no real cool down... I always pause the dvd and take a few minutes to walk the dog before coming back to stretch.",1298937600,10,1692,4.216049382716049
3717908,5,B001NFNFN0,"I used to do the ""30 Day Shred"" with Jillian Michaels and loved her style. I decided after a year or so of plateauing that it was time to shed a few pounds. I ended up buying ""Banish Fat Boost Metabolism"" as well as ""No More Trouble Zones"" and both workouts are amazing. I actually look forward to doing them. I know that sounds incredibly strange but the way Jillian has designed the circuits and the sequence of them, it never becomes too unbearable. Even when I seriously feel I am going to die, I am suddenly on a less intense circuit yet still feeling a burn. ""Banish Fat Boost Metabolism"" I particularly enjoy because it focuses on cardio and strength but only makes you use your own body weight. It is divided into 7 circuits which feature a variety of kickboxing type exercises to variations of plank to even classic jumping jacks. All the while it keeps you heart rate up, gives you that satisfying burn, but never lets you feel for too long that you can't make it through. I love how it is paced and I find the two girls in the background easy to follow along with if I want to do a more advanced workout or a modified one.

I advise alternating this workout with ""No More Trouble Zones"". I noticed a few other reviewers also suggested that as well and it definitley makes sense to. After three weeks, I have noticed slight indents in my arms and my legs are much more cut. I think one of the most important things about buying a workout DVD is buying one that doesn't get dull. I know some people may turn and burn exercise DVDs because they become less challenging, dull and/or need a change of pace, but with this this DVD this is not one I can see NOT being in my routine. I think one of the important things to point out is that it grows with you in a sense. I know 3 weeks ago, I could not do mountain climbers or be able to do the scissor kicks and as time has progressed I feel a sense of accomplishment in suddenly realizing I have just been able to do all the scissor kicks without pausing for a breath.

I've always liked DVD workouts where body resistance is used (instead of hand weights -- just a personal preference, even though I probably should work on that more...), and this DVD has a great range of different ""circuits"" which got my muscles working in no time.

I have DVDs by Denise Austin and Jennifer Galardi, and a few others -- I like all of them, but this DVD is really the toughest of all of the ones that I have. Great indoor workout, especially for winter time for those living in places/countries with 4 seasons!

This DVD could be a bit difficult for beginners, though Jillian Michaels gives tips along the way on how to modify the steps (such as the jump during the squats, etc). I really liked the combination of variety and toughness in this DVD -- might go check out the other DVDs by Jillian Michaels soon (all of which include hand weights, from what I saw at Walmart).",1298851200,,935,4.5266272189349115
3717911,5,B001NFNFN0,"I really wish there were more workouts like this one. I love Jillian's workouts, but most of them involve weights and incorporate upper and lower body - so you should not do them more than one day in a row. This is a great workout for the in-between days, when it's rainy, snowy, too hot, or too cold to work out outside or go to the gym. I'm usually sweating by the third circuit and my heart rate pretty much stays high until the end of the workout.

This workout is divided up into multiple short circuits, I think seven or eight total. Each circuit has a different theme, and with just a couple exceptions, no moves are repeated in more than one circuit. Each circuit is made up of 5-6 moves that are repeated twice before you move on to the next circuit. The changes from one move to another or from one circuit to another are rapid enough that you are always doing something different. On the plus side, if you hate a certain move (I want to kill her every time she makes me do those 180 jumps), you only have to do it twice for a minute each and then you're done. On the negative side, if you like certain moves or a certain section, the workout moves on from it very quickly. I love kickboxing in general and like the kickboxing circuits in this workout. I'd love to see Jillian do a straight-out kickboxing DVD.

Unfortunately, this is the only cardio-only workout that Jillian has done, and it's only 50 minutes, so if you do it often, you'll get bored. Still, I find myself coming back to it even though I could do the DVD in my sleep because it's just a good, solid workout that gets the job done. There aren't a lot of straight-out cardio DVDs out there that I like, and this is one of my go-to DVDs for rainy days when my muscles are pooped from weight training the day before.",1298592000,5,1791,4.264705882352941

You can play it on your laptop, put a towel on your hotel room floor, and off you go.  And then you realize this is a serious workout.

-I had sweat dripping off my face the whole time (I'm REALLY out of shape, major couch potato, weigh about 175ish, but I anticipate most people who are doing this are those who aren't in great shape and are looking to get in shape.
-heart rate was up the majority of the time (Jillian doesn't allow any breaks, so it's very efficient, so you may have to pause for a water break)
-Lots of jumping moves, which keeps HR up
-Jillian is great at motivating you during the tough times in this video!
-If you are looking for a strength training or AB's video, this is not it.... it's CARDIO that involves all parts of the body, so if you want to tone up, you'll probably have to do some weight lifting or other strength training.

HOWEVER, I had to modify a lot of the steps. Not because I was getting too tired, but because her choreography put a lot of strain on my knees. I'm 24 years old, 5'7"", 135 lbs and fairly fit. However, I occasionally experience knee and ankle pain with strenuous activity. This is not a good workout if you have bad knees. There is A LOT of jumping (and it's fast). I was able to modify most of the steps (only one move I could not do at all because it hurt my knees too much) but with the modifications I felt as though I wasn't getting as much of a cardio or muscular workout as I could have been getting.

3717920,4,B001NFNFN0,"I read just about every review on here before buying this video. Ones stating it was a killer workout to the one's where people didn't feel like they got a workout at all. Let me say that I've done just about all of Jillians videos, plus many others. I'm in pretty good shape and try to exercise 5 times a week at least. I've really gotten into doing videos because I live in Boston and we've had a brutal winter so I can't run outside. I loved this video, but I think you have to do the full 40 minutes to really get a great workout, and push yourself. I agree a couple of the circuits are fairly easy, but if they were all as hard as circuit 6 (so hard!) then you'd never make it through the whole video. Plus one of the circuits is a strength one, so you're not supposed to get super winded, but your abs and arms should be working. I also found that with a couple of the lighter circuits I could just work extra hard or double time the moves if I wanted to really work hard that day. And some days I add weights to some of the arm moves. Your workout is what you make of it; anyone who did the full 40 minutes and thought it was easy probably wasn't giving it their all. I'd say if your looking for some good cardio, with a little strength this is a great video. I also bought the Billy's Bootcamp Cardio Inferno the other day; now that was a snooze of a workout. Barely even got breathless! And if you want a good mix of strength and cardio, do the 30 day shred (level 2 or 3) then circuits 4-7 of this video and you'll feel it!",1297728000,2,1533,4.029508196721311

Jillian really pushes you to your limits in this DVD, but she also makes modifications so even a beginner can get through it and be successful.  I only started really exercising and eating right in early 2010, so I'm fairly new to working out.  However, this DVD pushed me to a new level and every time I use this DVD I still feel an amazing sense of accomplishment!  I've had this DVD for almost a full year and I still use it at least once per week!  My favorite thing about this DVD is that Jillian changes exercises often, so just when you think you can't do another repetition, you're on a new exercise anyway using different muscles so you can keep pushing through.  It keeps your heart rate up and never gets boring.  If you want a challenge, this DVD is for you!  If you want to lose weight, mix this DVD in with your other workouts and I bet you'll see results in a only a few short weeks! Of course, you have to be smart about what you eat, and Jillian will remind you of that!

I highly recommend using this DVD in combination with the 30 Day Shred as well as others from Jillian.  When your time is limited, the 30-Day Shred is perfect!  Its only 20 minutes!  When you have a good day with more time, use ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"".  It takes approximately 45 minutes and is an excellent workout!",1297209600,2,1450,4.286764705882353

The circuits definitely intensified as the workout went along, and many times I was tempted to ""phone in"" some of the moves, but the good news is that the circuits are quick and if you just push through it, you'll work a different muscle group and let your aching body parts rest.  My only caveat is that I popped the workout in after work but before I had a midafternoon snack and literally felt like I wanted to throw up afterward. I also woke up in the middle of the night completely ravenous after eating hearty and healthy at dinner. My advice: keep a bottle of water handy (she doesn't stop for water breaks but you can take a few sips before starting the next circuit) and eat a protein bar or something 30 minutes before the work out.",1297209600,,1006,4.322751322751323

For starters, I don't think it's as challenging as she makes it out to be.  If you're looking for something to give you a real workout I'd recommend Michelle Dozois' Peak 10.  However I love it as a cardio workout when I don't have a lot of time or energy and need a boost (usually my Monday workout).  I like the variety; you do the move for 30 seconds then switch to something else.  There are 7 sequences that have 5 moves, and you run through each series twice.  Because I get bored very easily this works out perfectly for me.  There are no moves with weights; it's purely cardio (and a little abs).  Also, the moves are very simple and non-dancy:  something that's hard to find in a cardio workout.

Sequence 1:  side kicks, jab/cross punches, side kicks (other side), jab/cross/hook/elbow punches, front kicks
2:  burpees, plie hops (jump then squat in plie), jab/cross hop (3 punches then hop), 180 jump (legs apart, squat, jump 180 degrees to face other side), single leg hops (hop side to side and land on one leg)
3:  butt kicks, high knees, jumping jacks, side crunches (I hold a weight through these), side crunches other side
4 (abs sequence):  mountain climbers, superman (lay on your stomach, lift arms and legs), pike crunches (lay on your back lift arms and legs), oblique crunches (all fours, bring knee to opposite armpit), walking plank (plank on forearms, lift up to plank on hands)
5:  swing kicks, uppercuts, back kicks, jab/cross, knees
6:  squat jumps, cross-country skier, scissor kicks (start legs apart, jump up and bring them together, land apart), skaters, standing mountain climbers
7:  twist hops (twist side to side with by hopping to each side, legs together), standing pikes (stand up straight, kick leg straight up to extended hands), knees on right, knees on left, jump rope

Sequence 1 and 5 are really easy, 2 and 6 are the most challenging.
As with any workout it's not a good idea to do it every single day with no rests in between.  That won't make your joints happy.  I like to alternate pure cardio days with cardio/weights mixed days and this has fit in very well with that rotation.",1296259200,70,2364,4.632211538461538

I would give this video about a 'medium' intensity level compared to the classes that I have taken at the Y.  I love the middle part where she is doing burpees and mountain climbers (they are killer and I can't do the whole thing), but I think that it starts out a little slow.  The end is good too where you do the floor exercises  - my arms are pretty sore the next day.  I would say that if you are used to hour long cardio/strength classes at your local gym, then you may find this video a little short on the length of intensity.

Anyyways, I tried it for the first time today, and wowww I was sweating non-stop. I do sweat easily when I do cardio workouts, but I was huffing and puffing the whole way through. I could hear my heart pounding during the quiet moments where you're resting for a maximum of like.. 5 seconds. Jillian only lets you rest maybe 3 times during the whole workout! I'm quite fit already, and I workout usually, but I'm very bad with being consistent. But this workout dvd kicked my ass, and I will admit I had to pause it for about 10 seconds to get some water about half way through the dvd, but its a 40 minute non-stop cardio circuit training workout that I definitely think if I keep it up consistently, I will definitely see results!

I was dripping in sweat by the time I finished this workout. It is fast paced and Jillian doesn't talk to you like you are a child (which in my mind is a huge problem with most workout DVDs). I was still able to keep up and get a good workout in but I had to take a few breaks after two of the harder workouts.

She makes you want to keep going, even when you feel like you can drop on the spot. You somehow find the energy and keep going. And when the exercise is done you feel wonderful.
She trains you to keep your stomach muscles tense. I find that even when I am jogging on my treadmill I keep my muscles tense. Between this video and the 30 day shred I have noticed a changed in my body. I am more tone. I have more energy and I feel great about myself.

3717942,5,B001NFNFN0,"So I haven't actually purchased this, I rented it from netflix, but I know how helpful the reviews were when I was deciding, so I thought I'd add my two cents.

I just got done with the first workout, and as embarrassed as I am to admit it- I wasn't able to finish the whole thing. After awhile, I wasn't even out of breath, but just too exhausted to finish! On that note- I think this is probably an excellent video to work out with. I can't give long term results, but it definitely got my heart rate up, and I'd be shocked if my muscles aren't sore tomorrow. When I would stop, I was worried my heart rate would drop, but once I started up again, it was quickly brought back up.

Now, why it's not for me, and I want to share with anyone else that lives in an apartment. I'm on the 2nd floor, so the jumping exercises make it sound like an elephant stampede (Obviously I'm not skinny and I probably live in a crappy apartment too; when my neighbor walks around upstairs, my chandelier shakes).

I would try a couple reps of the exercise, and then feel really guilty and end up doing some squats or trying to quietly jog in place.  I'm a college student, so I might keep the DVD around for awhile and do it in the afternoon or something and hope that my downstairs neighbor works 9-5.

The other thing I wanted to clear up was that I was under the impression that there were three different workouts (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) on the DVD (or maybe I'm mixing it up with another one). It's really just one, and you can go pick a circuit (from the original workout), but it doesn't tell you which one is what, and I think if you did that it would be pretty disjointed.

Other couple notes- she doesn't really explain the exercises before you begin, but I got over this because I realize it was just to keep things going. But the first time through, be prepared to miss a couple of the first reps just watching to figure out what's going on. Also, she doesn't tell you the adaptations for beginners/people with injuries until you're well into the workout. But those are both small things that won't affect you after the first time.

Sorry this is so long! Hopefully helpful! I would ideally give it a 4.5.",1295136000,4,2212,4.341404358353511

I do have to pause sometimes. You will be red faced and sore beyond belief, but it will be worth it. If you don't stick with it consistently, you may get discouraged as results will take longer. My best recommendation if you are a beginner like myself, try this a circuit or two at a time. If you do the whole thing the first time, trust me, you will dread doing the work out instead of learning how to achieve good form, tempo, and circuit completion. Pace yourself. Lastly, I just started praying before workouts. I think the key to the workouts is endurance and will power. When I want to give up, I just reflect upon my prayer and it encourages me to keep going. When you need prayer for a workout, you KNOW it's gotta be tough. Good luck!",1294963200,42,1028,4.223350253807107
3717944,5,B001NFNFN0,"I recently purchased this video to act as a supplement to 30 Day-Shred. I love the Shred but wanted a longer work-out that involved more cardio, and was hoping Banish Fat Boost Metabolism would work well for me. When I tried it out the other day, I was not prepared for how hard it would be! I've been working out pretty consistently over the past few weeks - which I realize isn't all that long, but I thought I could handle BFBM. After only 10 minutes I was sweating so much and had to stop and take breaks! The moves are basic enough, but when you are used to a 20 or 30-minute work-out and jump to this, your endurance better be able to handle it! I personally couldn't make it all the way to the end, but I'm going to work on my endurance and try again. I think if you aren't used to a long work-out, it may be a good idea to start with just 1 or 2 circuits and then gradually add in additional circuits, rather than do the entire work-out all at once. One of the great advantages to this DVD is that you can choose which circuits you want to do before your work-out starts. I absolutely loved that she included kickboxing moves in this work-out, too!

BFBM doesn't require any materials (not even weights), so it would be a great work-out if you have limited space or funds, or are traveling. While I thought this was a little too difficult for me, it's because I am truly a beginner when it comes to exercising and I have quite a bit of weight to lose. I think if you are in decent shape you can handle this, and it's a great work-out to add to your exercise regimen. Highly recommend!",1294876800,2,1592,4.2026143790849675

3717948,5,B001NFNFN0,"I've been using this dvd for awhile now, not everyday, i don't think that's smart only because i keep hearing that you have to keep your muscles guessing and why would you want to do the SAME MONOTONOUS exercises for your body everyday anyway...the same guess for food, right?

I think ""banish fat boost metabolism"" is a good adjunct to other types of exercises that you might do throughout the week like running and the nordic track especially if you are overweight. I picked up my fat loss when i combined this dvd & cardio, not always on the same day either.

After completing the workout, made up of the different circuits that Jillian Michaels guides you through, you'll notice that many of your muscles, you probably don't really think about, like the upper back & shoulders, if a beginner like i was, were used in the circuits.  You will feel the pain, so you know it's working! For example, I feel like I really have to push myself to do the 2nd round of mountain climbers.  So I think overall, the dvd is a good workout for your entire body. I especially like how my legs and butt look much better.

As for some negative comments out there, it is a hard workout,but step by step, it's worth it. Your heart rate will get that spike from these moves, nutritionist/trainers talk about to the question, how do i burn off the fat???  Don't get discouraged the first time you do it, because you will improve as you keep trying it.  Even now i cheat a little when i can't bring myself to do all the reps especially the ones that strengthen the lower body and inner thighs...it's challenging for me personally, so I feel like i do have to push through the pain, or try to.  Have some water by you and a towel, because you will sweat whether you are giving it 80% or better.

Another great thing is that you don't need a lot of room.  Using a yoga mat or one of those cushion type mats you often see at the gym are good investments for comfort during the moves that are done on the floor.

At that time I was on my school swim team, volleyball team and I also took up dance. I do want to get back to my high school weight which was 135 pounds but it is not that big of a deal for me. I only gained ten pounds in 4 years I think that is good since students gain that freshmen 14. So what I am trying to say is that I don't need to lose much weight because I am very happy with where I am at. I brought this dvd to bring back working out in my life so I can eventually get back into the swing of going to the gym 5 days a week. I love this dvd because it reminds me of what my personal trainer used to have me do. This workout is hard but I liked that because it makes me want to finish it so I can say "" I did it"". i only had the dvd for a few weeks and I lost 8 pounds. I will be buying other dvds by Jillian Michaels!!",1294099200,,1277,3.5642857142857145
3717950,4,B001NFNFN0,"I ordered this video to do as a follow up to the 30 Day Shred.  After doing the Shred for over 2 months, I needed something different to cut the boredom, but I wanted something with similar intensity since I was having good results from the Shred.

This video includes a warm up, 7 circuits, and a cool down.  The circuits are all about 5 minutes each.  I work out while my 1.5 year old is awake and playing, so at most I can usually only get in the warm up and 4 circuits.  But even in just doing about half the workout, I'm still seeing results and it feels just as intense as doing the Shred.  So it works for me to just pick 4 circuits per day.  I don't know if I'd even be able to get through the whole workout at once.

I'll probably end up alternating doing this video and the Shred, but it's a great alternate for me.  A lot of the moves are the same or similar, and Jillian's style is the same.  I wish she would explain the move at least briefly before doing it, but that is no longer an issue after the first few times doing the video.  I also like that you can turn off the instructions and just have music on.",1294099200,,1122,4.009009009009009
3717951,5,B001NFNFN0,"This is hands down my favorite video. It's no joke, this is the hardest...but that is why I love it. It took me 5 months of working out to finally get through this video without stopping. But that is what is so cool, I did it! It's endurance training, it doesn't come easy. I workout at the gym in hour long classes and still don't get the workout I get in this 40 min video. You can start off with modification, they show you an easier way to do it. You can start at your pace and push it the better in shape you get, it will grow along with your endurance. I cannot say enough good things about it, it's just plain awesome! I have 5 of her other videos, love them all...but this is the best workout hands down.",1293926400,,712,4.056737588652482

3717953,5,B001NFNFN0,"If you are a beginner, like me, this video will be really hard, but it's awesome!  One nice thing about it is that the different circuits can be done separately--so you can shorten it if you need to.  I do the warm-up, circuits 1, 3, 5, 7, and the cool-down.  Another plus is that you don't need any equipment--which is great when you're traveling or if you need a home workout when you can't get to the gym.  The best part is that in doing the video for a week I already notice my stamina improving and my body changing--highly recommended!",1293408000,,541,4.326732673267327

She has my heart pumping by the end of the first circuit and by the 4th I am sweating like crazy!! For those of you looking for a cardio routine to do at home (or to take with you when traveling), with no weights, that still pushes you to build muscle strength, I highly recommend this dvd. Even my husband loves her dvds (he takes this one with him when he is on the road for work)!  I do wish she would spend more time on cool down and stretching at the end, I find that if I don't do a more extended stretch at the end on my own, I pay for it the next day. Because so much of this workout is plyometric based, it is always challenging. If you don't have time for the entire (nearly one hour) workout, it is easy to simply do as many circuits as you have time for, then skip to the cool down. However, if you can do the whole workout, go for it! You will definitely see results from working out with this dvd consistently!",1292630400,,1006,4.0049751243781095

3717956,5,B001NFNFN0,"Wow, this workout kicks butt.  It's the perfect cardio workout to do on your days off from strength workouts.  I used to think that I was in intermediate shape, but this workout sent me back to beginner status.

The squats with heel click jumps...the scissor squats, have mercy! By circuit 5 I was huffing and puffing and taking tons of breaks.  Anyone who can do this whole workout without stopping to rest, I salute you.  You are a beast!

This workout also offers some great moves for your abs that don't involve lying down doing crunches.

The only negatives to this workout are:

Finding motivation to do it since it's so intense, but I know that if I stick to it I will definitely see results, AND
You also need a space where you can jump around a lot, which can be hard to find if you live in an apartment with downstairs neighbors.",1290816000,5,839,4.402597402597403

I did the warm up 2 circuts and the cool down at night after a day of work. I loved the work outs and my daughter had fun jummping around with me. I did get tired after just that. I will be doing it again tomorrow and try and do more really push my self. I felt great after the little I did.

I consider myself in pretty good shape and excercise about 5 days a week.  For years I have been working out to Billy Blanks series ( all the bootcamp dvds most recently )and I thought those were great!  However, I decided to give Jillian a try cuz they say that switching up your workout is good and I am glad I did!  She blows Billy away!  I was soaked from sweat in the first 15 minutes of her trouble zones and banish fat workouts!! The weird thing of it was that Billy has you jumping and moving alot more.  I think it is the combination moves that she has that burns the most calories and really makes you feel it!  I felt so great afterwards!! She is awesome!

I just always found her to be annoying, but I have to give her credit where it's due and believe me she deserves credit for this work out dvd. It kicks butt! The exercises move fast but their are different modifications that you can do to make it easier until your able to do it like them. What I suggest is try doing one set of each circuit if you're beginning and then when you become accustomed to it do the whole thing. It may have to be circuit by circuit but as long as you keep with it you will see results. I started it and did it for a month and was able to tone and lose some fat that I have always hated. Yay!! Sometimes the talking can get annoying, I prefer awesome music, but since it doesn't have neither you can opt to have no sound and put your own music or suck it up and hear her talking. This dvd really does work and I am actually wanting to buy her other dvds so that I can change it up every so often, because it gets kind of boring doing it everyday.",1289347200,,1035,4.004830917874396

It makes me feel like I did back when I ran and all the different strengthening moves are helping my knee toughen up. My favorite workout dvd!

Random side note... did anyone else notice that part of the music in circuit 6 sounds eerily similar to the ""Halloween"" theme music (you know the scary suspense music that plays just before someone gets offed by Jason)? Maybe it's just me but it sort of creeps me out every time!
EDIT: After doing this workout for awhile now I finally figured out that the creepy, ""horror movie"" music in circuit 6 was on purpose! Because that circuit is the hardest one... it's a killer! :)",1288569600,,841,4.425806451612903

I can get through the entire 30 day shred (all 3 levels) not easily, but I can do it. But this DVD is so much harder (and better)! For example, in the 30 day shred, in one cardio circuit you do a minute of jumping jacks and butt kicks, in the next level (2) you do high-knees. In this one, it's all three back to back!! I have yet to get through it without stopping.
It's 40 minutes so it really tires you and it is a LOT of Cardio. The best thing is you don't need any mats or weights it's all using your own body and I love the kickboxing moves.

I have tried sooooo many different workouts! Which is how I have lost the weight. I have to tell you, out of all the workouts that I have done Jillian by far has been the best.

3717969,4,B001NFNFN0,"Jillian Michaels loves her circuit training. So this workout contains several circuits, some harder than others (like the one with the high knees *and* the standing mountain climbers). Modifications? Not here, which is why I said ""not for beginners"". You have to be able to either -> do the moves or -> know enough about working out/your abilities to modify appropriately.
I have some issues with bursitis that tends to flare up, but I can do this workout once/twice a week without my body complaining....thanks to exercises in the circuits that give you a break from the plyometrics (but don't take this wrong- this does not mean those are easy!); examples include a plank circuit and some ab work that makes your midsection burn. You will get to know every single muscle in there if you do it right.

Yep, a good, solid workout, no frills. 40 minutes of sweat and you're done and properly worked out.

While plyometric exercises have a bunch of benefits, you should not do this too often. Instead, use it wisely and go *hard*. Use it along with some weight training and you'll find your stamina and endurance increase much faster than with traditional, steady state cardiovascular exercise.

What I like the most of this dvd that Jillian talks and distracts me. I do not have time to think how hard is the exercise but focus on what she says. Another thing I like about Jillian CD is that she tells that you have 5 more movements in that specic exercise and she counts 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1. I feel good when I hear that I have only 5 more and I believe that was the reason I did not give up and I see results. I highly recommend this DVD for every day workout without weights and a healthy diet. Just a healthy diet would not work believe me I try it.

I suggest this workout for someone who has had at least a few months of consistent moderate physical activity with proper stretching and warmup under their belt. Although I have been working out consistently for the past 4 months with trainer supervision while eating a sensisble diet I still had to modify some exercises/circuits. I stretched out really well, even more than what the DVD includes at the end and I was NOT sore at all the next day. YOU WILL FEEL THE BURN and YOU WILL SWEAT!! I really thought I wouldn't be able to last the whole 45 minutes but I DID IT with Jillian's powerful words of encouragement and the other girls in the back as they have killer bodies with a great level of flexibility. I really like how she kept pointing out the fact that if you don't have weights/equipment then just USE YOUR OWN BODY WEIGHT...I've been preaching that for years as I am a BIG fan of cardio kickboxing where Jillian's fitness roots originated and she includes a small segment of in this DVD. Kickboxing sculpts your body like no other method of working out. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!! I borrowed  this DVD from my local library first to preview it and I am surely going to purchase it soon. I learned quite a few new exercises from this DVD and I am excited to incorporate them in my own weekly gym routine.

3717974,3,B001NFNFN0,"While this routine will definitely get you sweating, there are so many things about this workout that drive me crazy. First of all, someone needs to send this woman a metronome or something.  She cannot keep a steady pace or rhythm to save her life.  She'll be doing a step at one speed and then five seconds later she'll be doing the same step at a slower or faster pace.  I don't believe this is an intentional part of the workout.  I think she just doesn't know how to follow a steady beat or pace.  At times it makes this very difficult to follow her.  Secondly, the music is godawful.  It makes me want to gouge my eyes out. Also, if you're looking for some fun choreography, you'll be disappointed.  It's basically just her barking at you: ""Now do some jumping jacks""...""Now do some roundhouse kicks""...""Now do some crunches""...etc.  Lastly, the two girls behind her are irritatingly smiley and perky.

The first time I did this routine I was cursing at Jillian for making this so hard!  But after about 3 times I got used to it.  The intervals vary in intensity and she does give you ample time to recover.  But be warned: You'll really need that recovery.  She kicks your butt.

After about 10 times of using the DVD, I still find myself sweating so much!  I reccomend keeping something to wipe yourself up with.

There is one thing though: she seems to not like the blond girl in the film.  You'll know what I mean when you see it.  They may be just joking around, but it is a little uncomfortable.  That's why I choose to do the workout with just music (yes! there is an option for that!).

It is a very satisfying workout; I never feel like I wish I could do more.

3717986,4,B001NFNFN0,"This workout will kick your butt, no question.  If you are new to exercising, I would recommend Jillian's 30 Day Shred first.  I'm a pretty experienced exerciser and considered myself in decent shape, and this video had me sweating like crazy and dropping to my knees out of breath.  I like Jillian's no-nonsense style and how she pushes you.  Think of it as a love-hate relationship because there were a few times I wanted to cuss her out, but at the end I felt great.  If you have done the 30 DS, some of the moves will be familiar.  Lots of jumping, so if you have bad knees or need a low impact workout, this is not for you. My reasons for giving it 4 instead of 5 stars:  1) Unlike the 30 DS Jillian's girls are both pretty advanced and while she mentions how to modify some of the moves, she doesn't show you. That would be helpful because some of the moves are TOUGH. 2) She often doesn't mention how to use correct form on a move until you've already done it several times. There are some advanced moves (like the kick boxing) that if done incorrectly, you could easily hurt yourself if you're not already pretty strong and have decent flexibility. 3) While much of the cool down will be familiar to 30 DS users, there are a couple moves that in my opinion you could easily hurt yourself. I've been exercising for years and know how (and how not) to stretch.  My hamstring totally cramped up on the quad stretch and I was being very careful.  I did the standing quad stretches instead.

Overall this is an awesome workout and I was quite sore the next day, all over! Definitely recommend!",1282521600,,1596,4.379661016949153

I miss the weights and although the moves are familiar, she has confuses me by changing the names of some of the exercises. Not a big deal though.

After a month I have everyone telling me how much thinner I look and asking how I've done it. Level 1 is very easy, but Level 2 (which I have only tried once) is a huge leap.

I enjoy this video. It helps you tone up, maybe not lose as much weight as she says, but muscle weighs more than fat and you gain some muscle from it. I agree she gets quite annoying, so I just mute or put the volume on really low and listen to music instead.",1280966400,,570,4.089285714285714

I just did it and was able to keep up and complete the whole DVD.  I am sure that I looked very silly doing it and my body will regret it tomorrow but my point is some people have made this sound impossible and it is far from it.

I have been doing this DVD 5 times per week (straight through) for 2 months, and still find it tough, but I will say--it really works. I have had numerous comments about how good I look. It has helped with my weight loss goals (you really do burn the fat), and my muscle tone has really improved. Circuit 4 is a core workout and that is the one that in my opinion is the toughest (especially going into the ab hold and then going back and forth up onto your hands--WHEW!!!) I recently purchased the 30-day Shred because I thought it would be more of a challenge--but it is not.

Plus she is very un consistent. She'll do 10 reps on one leg and 16 on the other....but that's my opnion.

I would consider myself fairly athletic and I found this challenging the first time I did it (to the point where I skipped over many of the exercises).  However, with each time I do this, I am more able to do the exercises.

I really like that it's a cardio, aerobic, and kick boxing exercise all in one.  This exercise video is more difficult than her Yoga Meltdown.

I really like watching Jillian's shows, so I took a chance and bought this.  I am really happy that I did; it was exactly what I was hoping it would be--Jillian Michaels kicking my a** into shape via an intense work out.  After less than a week I am seeing a change in my body, which makes me really happy.

The only things that you may want to consider is that this is a fairly time consuming work out and you may not want to do it any place where there could possibly be people who would be annoyed with the noise you would make (especially if they live underneath you).  I recommend taking the warm up easy, because by the second circuit I was already beginning to feel tired.",1279584000,,1155,4.162162162162162

I gave it four stars, and not five, because I noticed yesterday when I pulled it out to workout again that the music is pretty lame.  I usually don't care about the music in workout dvd's but for some reason I really noticed it yesterday.  I think after you do the workout so many times, you want to focus on something else other than Jillian's dialog that can become a little redundant.  The other girls in the video are alright however for some reason they don't seem to get out of breath or even look like they are working that hard!  This is a little irritating and unmotivating!  lol  I think after doing so many of the Biggest Loser dvd's, you want to workout to one where you can relate to the people in the video.  These girls are very fit and that's great, however, a little unrealistic to watch.
Again, as far as the overall workout, Jillian definitely will get your heart rate up and work every area of your body!

Like I said before today was Banish Fat Boost Metabolism day.  Overall I loved the workout! It seems that it will be very effective and that it will continue to challenge me throughout the process of losing a significant amount of weight.

My only complaint is that she has two back up girls and neither one do any modified exercise.  In fact several times you're halfway through a set when she shows you how to modify something! Personally when she introduced something I knew I wasn't going to be able to do I used mods from other DVDs with similar moves and I think I can guess why her backup girls AREN'T doing modifiers but it's very discouraging to those of us who may need them.

Other than that I love this DVD and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a very challenging workout.  I usually follow it up with 20-30 minutes of pilates.",1279065600,,1090,4.313725490196078

It is like having a personal trainer, working with you.  Believe me I have had a personal trainer, so this is me much better.

For the first time since my mid 20's, I can eat dessert now and then and have a glass of wine (or 2) in the evening and not worry that I will gain a pound.  It took about a month or two of a regular Jillian work-out routine before the metabolism boost really started to take affect.  I workout 5 days each week, 4 of those days with a Jillian DVD and one with a yoga DVD.  Then two days of much needed rest.  Jillian's DVDs are really tough, especially this one, but once I started to see the effects it has been a great motivator to know that if I just do my workout today I can go out for a big lunch or dinner and I will still weigh less tomorrow.

My sister was in the dressing room with me when we went shopping recently, and I was changing my shirt. When I took off my shirt she said, ""OMG! you are ripped"". I was so excited! It feels so good to look good! I feel good inside and out. I recently purchased Jillians Banish fat and boost metabolism. I have to say... If you are new to working out get the 30 day shred first. Get through that and then move on to the banish fat and boost metabolism, unless you are in shape or have good endurance. Its a little more intense, but Im no expert. Although it is about and hour and the 30 day shred is half and hour. You do the math. Some people say Jillian Michaels is too tough or too hard. That is ridiculous. Do people really expect to get things for free? If you want to waste your time lolly gagging in the gym go ahead. Chances are if you think Jillians too hard, you're probably not going to push yourself or get any kind of results. Just go get lipo or something.

I started doing only 30 min. of this dvd and then when I was ready would add doing it for 40 min. since I was used to the 25min. from 30 day shred. I'm pretty sure this workout goes longer than what it says I've timed it and Jillian just keeps going with her exercises.

I was looking for something a little longer that would push me harder and I got much more than I asked for.

I enjoy Jillian's style of training and how she thoroughly explains why you're doing each move and what benefits it will have if you can stick it out. After successfully losing 60 pounds I thought I was in fairly good shape but this DVD quickly showed me that I still have more work to do. I like that it is broken into circuits because when you're at the point where you think you can't do any more you're already moving onto the next one.

I found that I get the most from this workout if I play through the circuits backwards working from the most difficult circuits to the easier ones. I found I was just too tired and half assed my way through the last 2 circuits when I played in from start to finish.

If you are SERIOUS about changing your body this is the DVD for you.  Yes it's hard, but keep it up, do what you can and push yourself a little more each week and trust me - it gets easier and you will see results FAST.

Consequently, I have to modify some of her moves (squats, for example).  But it's pretty simple, just don't go so deep...Bend more in the hips and so on.  Interestingly, I find myself able to get more and more into the move than I could when I started.  The muscles must be building and stabilizing my joints better...
I'm knocking it down to a 4, though, because she isn't always good about pointing out modifications.  And I'm sorry, but if you're heavy with bad knees, full squats are going to KILL you.  She *should* know to always point this out...

I also have, and like, 30 Day Shred.  For me, the big difference is, Shred is a somewhat slower-paced workout, with weights.  Banish Fat is faster and only uses body weight.  Ultimately, it depends on what I'm after for the day-- If I don't have time, it's Shred.

I'm not over weight...my Dr would like me to loose 10 lbs to get my BMI into normal range...so it's not that I'm to heavy to keep up.  I also wish she counted her reps because I noticed that she is not consistent.  You will do 20 lunges on one leg but then only 16 on the other.

This DVD entirely saved my fitness level while on a recent two-week trip overseas. No mats, no weights, no goofy makeshift hotel-room equipment or water-bottles-for-weights: you'll need space enough to jump around just a little, and a DVD player.

3718044,5,B001NFNFN0,"I've been working out for about a month now to blast off belly fat, from 10 minute solutions. Now I wanted to do a workout with more of a challenge. I just want to be fit or a little more in shape, but I would like to lose 5 to 10 pounds also. I love this DVD, I feel so sore after I finish, but I keep going. After I finish I get on my stepper. I've read people say Jillian is hard or whatever, but I think she is great. I love her and she motivates you. The only thing she doesn't do as much as Suzanne Bowen in blast off belly fat is make sure you are breathing, and she don't remind you as much to pull in your belly, but when you are at this level I guess you should know that already, maybe?
I look forward everyday to my session with Jillian. I got 30 day shred also, but I read it has strength training and someone said it made them gain weight, from muscle building up under their fat. I don't want that so I'll just do that DVD when I don't have a lot of time. I hope that's a good idea.
Nobody ever write how much weight they have lost so if I happen to lose some I update my review. I'm going to give Jillian a month I hope I see results, because I don't want to be doing such hard work with no reward.",1269302400,,1214,3.802371541501976
3718045,5,B001NFNFN0,"Yeah, I can see why this workout gets such good reviews. I have been working out pretty seriously for 18+ years, and I have seen some of the best results ever from Jillian's training. She is tough!!! But she delivers. I have been alternating between this video and her No More Trouble Zones, 5-6 days a week, for 7 weeks. I still cannot do the second circuit of mountain climbers (on the floor) all the way through. Whew. And look out for circuit number 7...OMG...

I am 39 and now look better than I did at 29, or even 19. And my abs have NEVER looked as good as they do now. The definition is amazing--and I should hope so. What she offers for core training goes way beyond crunches. The definition in my arms and back has also improved with this workout, and my backside is up where it belongs. Thanks, Jillian! You are the bomb.

Bottom line: this workout, unmodified, is not for beginners and can be discouraging to someone just starting out. (I strongly advise seeing your doctor before you begin this workout if this is your first stab at getting in shape.) However, if you are willing to accept that you may have to stop frequently to catch your breath, and push yourself just a little further each time, you will see results that you will never get from just running on a treadmill. ;)",1269129600,3,1294,4.410041841004184

3718047,5,B001NFNFN0,"I have done 30 Day Shred a little more consistently than this DVD, but I throw this one into the mix every now and then.  This is a kick-butt workout!  The thing that I love about it is that it is mostly great cardio, with a little strength built in.  In this workout, you are huffing and puffing while using so many different muscles!  Much more effective than just running on a treadmill, biking, or doing an elliptical, where you are using the same muscles in the same motion for your entire workout.  This is a dynamic workout that is sure to challenge your whole body.

True, this workout incorporates some of the same elements from 30 Day Shred, but I don't see that as a negative thing.  Some of the overlap from the two DVDs are:  jumping jacks, plank twists, jump rope, jump squats, butt kicks, knee raises, skaters, and possibly a few more.  But there is SO MUCH in this workout, it's completely different than 30 Day Shred.  I like that Jillian uses some of the same moves, because this workout is so difficult that it is nice to do a move that you are familiar with from 30 Day Shred.

There is a lot of jumping in this DVD, but you can modify ALL of the jump moves if for some reason that explosive action is too much for you or the people underneath you.  :-)",1268784000,3,1273,4.2803347280334725

I consider myself to be in okay shape and this thing kicked my butt. I had to pause so many times to catch my breath. My shirt was soaked and sweat was also dripping off my face. I felt deliciously sore the next day having worked out every inch of my body with this video.

It is not for beginners. If you're just starting, I highly recommend her 30-day shred to get you into the groove of things. Also, if you're like me, this video is just too much to do in the morning. I didn't have the energy and my body gave out halfway through the video. Eat something small before you start this workout. You will need the energy to finish it. When I first started, I was so exhausted I could barely lift my leg for the knee crunches near the end of the video. My feet only got up a few inches from the floor because I was so drained.

This one in particular I would highly recommend if you consider yourself already somewhat fit and looking for a new challenge. I like the format--six circuits that work you out hard, but keep you moving forward mentally. There were several exercises that I've never done before, and could really feel them making a difference. Unfortunately I picked up pneumonia right after I got this dvd, so I can't report on any progress--but I definitely plan to go back to it as soon as my lungs are clear.

I would not recommend it yet it you are new to exercise. Check out her 30-day Shred video instead, because it has three levels, allowing you to ramp up.

I also got her new Yoga video. Can't wait to try it.",1268352000,2,920,4.368421052631579
3718054,5,B001NFNFN0,"Immediately after finishing 30 days of Shred, I jumped into Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism. I didn't buy it because a friend had just purchased it and offered to let me try it out but I will be ordering my own copy. Here's why:

It's a darn good, fast-moving workout that leaves me feeling completely satisfied that I worked out.

Interestingly, on day one of doing Banish Fat, after just finishing 30 days of Shred, I was disappointed. Why? I almost felt like I didn't get as good as a workout as I did with Shred, it seemed easier for some reason. However, while I was thinking this over, I was still panting, guzzling water and sweating like a pig. So. Were my initial thoughts right? I don't think  so. Not at all. Now after having done it several times, I think the issue is that Jillian breaks the intensity a bit so that you end up doing some of the awful moves slightly less time at a pop. Each of the 7 circuits has about 5-6 moves (I haven't really counted yet, or timed any of them) and each of those moves is done with no (or very little) rest in between and then you start over and redo them all over again before moving right into the next circuit.

Shred is three 20ish minute workouts with three different levels of intensity. Banish Fat has the same workout everyday. There is the option to do individual circuits and therefore make your own workout. Shred is 3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio, 1 minute ab done in 3 different circuits. Banish Fat is 7 circuits without a specific, timed focus. One circuit is an ab workout on the floor. Two circuits are kick-boxing based. Another one is ""old-school"" calisthenics.

Banish Fat moves aren't easy. And each move is tweakable into easier or more advanced. Plyometrics are abundant, several of the moves require jumping or hopping. And squats and lunges are frequent throughout most circuits. Jillian explains the whys of doing moves the way she sets up the circuit. Many of the exercises in Banish Fat are included in Shred. Jumping Jacks, Jump Squats, Speed Skaters, Supermans, Plank Oblique Twists, Jump Ropes, High Knees, Butt Kicks, Mountain Climbers, Walking Planks and a few more. An estimated guess is that Banish Fat has 38-42 moves to Shred's 18-24. The biggest difference between Shred and Banish Fat, besides the time difference, is that Banish Fat uses no weights and 1/3 to 1/2 of Shred's moves do.

The reason I'm going to buy a copy of Banish Fat is because there are days I'm going to want to use weights and challenge myself in 20 minutes of work. And there are going to be days that I want to push myself to 40 minutes and get a nice sweat on. Besides that, these workouts are so good that I don't want to get sick of repetition by doing the same thing every day.",1267920000,8,2747,4.506024096385542

THIS workout, on the other hand, is really tough (in a good way)!  Be prepared, there's a lot of high impact moves, squatting and jumping, so beginners may find this a little too challenging.  But if you're looking for a workout that will really kick your butt in the cardio department, this is it!  I also like that there's the option of doing the workout without her instruction, just music, so once you've learned the routine you can do it without the chatter.  One weird thing, in the ""bonus"" section of the DVD, Jillian is hawking Oral B toothbrushes.  It's definitely strange, and the video would be better without it.

My 18 year old athlete little sister does this, too, and says it's the best workout she has gotten since she was in the middle of volleyball season. She says her school's field hockey team does it at practices sometimes.

One thing I really like about this DVD is that Jillian breaks everything down into circuits for you. Sure, it feels like there are a million circuits when you are doing it, but at the end of each circuit you feel like you are getting somewhere. You can also skip circuits and only do certain ones if you are short on time or just starting out. In fact, I still haven't done the whole thing all the way straight through. I've been doing this workout for about a month and a half, maybe once or twice a week, but it's just a killer! During the video, Jillian keeps saying things like ""if you're not uncomfortable, you won't see any results!"" and this is certainly true of this DVD.

I would recommend this video to anyone looking to get a great cardio work out in the comfort of your own home; just pop in the DVD and get ready to feel the burn",1266624000,2,638,4.031496062992126
3718065,5,B001NFNFN0,"Burned over 600 calories doing this workout. Doing the 30 Day Shred helped me transition into Banish Fat Boost Metabolism easily. Your heart rate will go up faster, and you'll burn more calories than the 30 Day Shred. Some of the moves are hard on the knees especially the jumping exercises. I would switch to beginner options on the mountain climbing and substitute other exercises like jumping jacks with weights (to protect my knees from too much impact).

Jillian Michaels moves at a faster pace on this dvd workout than the 30 Day shred. She provides beginner options and instructions, but she is very brief. Some of the moves are from the 30 Day Shred. Some are new like the kickboxing moves she incorporates in the workout. If you can do Level 1 and 2 of the 30 Day shred back to back, you can do this dvd without too many problems. I would only be careful about the impact it would do to your knees especially on the jumping parts.

It was definitely challenging, and some of the circuits had me panting, but I never really wanted to die the way I do with, say, Billy Blanks' Ultimate Tae Bo (oh man... I'm always dying by the end of that one!!).  It also feels pretty short -- 40 minutes isn't short but for some reason, I just didn't feel that tired afterwards.  And I'm not a pro athlete or anything, I just work out 4 times/week, and one of those times is yoga...

I will say that the high/low cardio aspect of it (an easier circuit followed by a harder one) is probably good for your heart.  But there are three other problems I have with this DVD: 1) there is way too much jumping to be good for your knees, and I have an injured knee, AND Jillian doesn't offer any modifications for people with bad knees; 2) Jilllian's technique in kickboxing is pretty bad; and 3) the music is super boring.

None are the same at all, and each will kick your butt! However...YOU need to make that happen. It's your intensity that will make it work. So if you are a ""fluffy trainer type"" person, then you probably won't like Jillian. Although she does talk about beginner moves and promotes doing the easier moves if that is what your body is telling you what to do. She also helps encourage you to give it your all. She just a ""tells it like it is kind of gal"" and helps push you to be your best. No half assing it. It's YOUR workout she says...you buy the DVD, you do the work. Each of her DVD's have different routines, but the message is the same if you want your outer shell to be hot, then you also need to work on your inner shell, your mind & nutrition have to be in the game with you as well.

Things like burpies, supermans, and all the frigging jumps are tough but effective.  She's put together a tough workout.  It got me working hard, all nice and sweaty!  I gave it 4 stars for two reasons - the music sucks and the background girls are really uninspiring.  Especially Sylema, she looks as if she's ""phoning it in"" as Jillian likes to say.  Kristen, the other backgroung girl, appeared to be working a bit harder and I could see her sweating.  Jillian's attitude was great - motivating but not harsh.

3718080,5,B001NFNFN0,"I was introduced to Jillian Michaels via her 30 Day Shred DVD.  That workout is tough...and awesome.  This one is just as awesome.  Notice how many reviews it has and how many stars it has - there is a reason for this.

Previous reviewers have commented that you should get through 30 Day Shred before attempting this one...I agree, yet I disagree at the same time.  What I like about this DVD as opposed to the 30 Day Shred is that the time spent doing each exercise is shorter, so I find I can get through them more easily without wanting to stop.  For example, in 30 Day Shred I will start to lose my steam and motivation because I'll feel like we've been doing squats or lunges FOREVER, and Jillian will say, ""halfway there, don't quit on me now!"" and I'm like, aaagh how many are left?!  But with this DVD, because the circuits are set up differently, you'll do a set of four to five exercises twice.  So, you'll do each exercise for a little bit of time, twice instead of doing a whole bunch at once.  Make sense?  This helps me psychologically because just when I'm starting to lose my steam on the lunges, Jillian switches to another move.

The moves are hard, and I get winded very easily.  And, I have yet to make it through the entire DVD.  But that's okay, and Jillian says in the introduction that beginners will have to work up to the full workout.  Another previous review mentioned they like to use a circuit or two from this to supplement another workout...that's a good idea, and the DVD setup allows you to pick one area you'd like to work if this is how you want to use the DVD.

I like to rotate between 30 Day Shred, this DVD, and No More Trouble Zones.  They are all great, intense workouts, and you will see results (albeit tiny in the beginning), fairly quickly.",1264464000,15,1787,4.353474320241692

I have also eaten a well balanced low calorie diet with it, but it really speeds up the weight loss.  I am not really that big of a person, 5ft 6in at 160 pounds, now at 150 pounds.  I really just want to tone myself and get rid of my post baby weight and puffin top.  I am not a person to work out, so I am really out of shape.  I was winded during the workouts, but in a good way.  It is a very good workout and your muscles will scream and so will you by the end of the workout.  You have to make the time and do it at least 5-6 days a week though. Trust me, I have never hated someone as much as her at the end when I am cussing her out ;) It is a love/hate relationship I guess.

My HRM showed a total calorie burn of 620 in the 1 hr 10 mins it took me to complete the workout. I need to press the pause button several times as my heart rate is close to 170 most of the time. The workout details show that most of the time spent in the workout is in the fitness building phase and therefore you are working at a very high % of your heart rate max all the time. The only reservation I have is that because it is such a tough workout, and involves so much high impact (39 yr female), I won't really do this more than once a week.

3718084,5,B001NFNFN0,"This is one great workout.  I have a lot of other carefully selected workout DVDs and have always been a fan of The Firm and Kathy Smith.  I figured that Jillian would not want to risk her reputation on ""The Biggest Loser"" with a lame workout, and thought I'd give it a try.  I thought she was nuts the first time I went through it....It's only 45 minutes, but it was really tough.  After another couple of times through, I got used to the circuits and could feel exactly what she was working and it was much easier to get through the workout. I always feel it in my abs the next day - she does a great core workout.  Jillian explains the rationale for why she does things (like alternating working out arms and legs)and is an incredible motivator througout the entire thing.  While I still supplement them with running and alternate them with other workouts to get a variety, her workouts remain at the top of my list.

One word of caution (I saw another reviewer mention this as well) - make sure you are careful with the jump work.  When you're feeling good, it's so easy to get into it and push yourself further than you should.  There were a couple of times I was out of commission for a week or two with tendon and knee issues (which I don't typically get), so just be careful how high and vigorous you go until you know your body is ready for it.

Great stuff - thanks Jillian!!",1264204800,2,1385,4.292307692307692
3718085,5,B001NFNFN0,"This video is tough but doable. Jillian advises that ""you want results but they don't come for free.""  Right she is. I find Jillian very motivational. Her ""finish with intensity"" and ""don't phone it in coaching"" inspires me. I imagine myself at the Biggest Loser Ranch and this is my last chance work out. There is a warm up, 7 circuits with 4/5 exercises done once then repeated, and a cool down.  The music basically just keeps you on beat.  Circuit 1 starts your heart pumping with kick boxing, circuit 2 is jump work - tough, circuit 3 is calasthenics with an ending, much appreciated breather, circuit 4 works the plank, circuit 5 is a break to get you ready for circuit 6 - cardio blast, circuit 7 has standing abs with less intense cardio.  Some tips: The jump work is tough on my quads so I try to remember when squatting to sit back like in a chair.  That helps.  I also try to remember the number of repetitions so I know when I'm close to finishing.  Cirucit 7's moguls look straight ahead, don't turn your head with your body or you'll get dizzy, especially coming off circuit 6.  Lastly, in circuit 4, the core work, I have to keep my hands directly below my shoulders and keep my body tight as directed when doing the side abdominal twists or I don't really feel it.",1263513600,,1280,4.3940677966101696
3718086,5,B001NFNFN0,"""If you're not winded, you're not working hard enough.""  That basically sums up what you're in for with Jillian.  She does not mess around and is not interested in placating the whiners (which is great for those of us prone to whining.)

The first time I tried it (as a completely sedentary person) I could barely finish the full 50 minutes and was sore for days.  However, I began to see results in muscle tone almost immediately.  The genius thing about this workout is she really does manage to combine intense cardio with moderate strength exercises.  It's circuit training, but not in the traditional sense... you don't focus on one and then the other.  You are actually doing both simultaneously in the same set, with each exercise containing elements of both.

This has had a tremendous impact on my metabolism.  After a few months of doing nothing, I have resumed doing this video for a mere 15 minutes a day and am seeing improved muscle tone after only two weeks.  The weight is flying off, too.  It has also been an extremely effective tool for managing chronic depression -- I find that I really have to go high intensity to get the full mood benefit of a cardio workout.  It is almost impossible for me to feel bad about myself after I finish this thing.

This is definitely something you have to stick with.  Do not expect to finish the first day without opting out of several of the exercises.  If you're not cursing Jillian out at some point during the routine, you really aren't getting the full benefit of what the tape has to offer.  The better your form, the more control you have over your muscle groups and the harder it gets.  Quads, abs, shoulders, chest--nothing is left unclenched.  It was meant to hurt, but it hurts in a good way.

This routine contains a significant number of knee bends and jumping exercises, so I don't recommend it for those with serious knee issues.  I actually have moderate knee issues and find the exercises keep the muscles around my knee from getting too weak, but it's extremely easy to injure yourself doing these exercises.  I have injured my knees twice.  The fact that I keep coming back to it should tell you something.  There are ways to modify the exercises to go easier on the knees, but they are of course less effective at keeping your heart rate up.

I also recommend rotating this workout with the No More Trouble Zones video, which is lower intensity cardio and intense strength.  It is equal parts painful and wonderful.  That is Jillian's way.",1263513600,4,2514,4.618510158013544
3718087,4,B001NFNFN0,"This is one tough workout, probably suited to moderate level exercisers. I did it on comcast for about a month and you burn calories and sweat like crazy. Jillian incorporates a lot of jump work (plyometrics), kickboxing movies, and moving core work. The only problem is I pulled a muscle doing one of the jump moves. I was out of commission for 3 weeks recovering. Luckily it wasn't major as in requiring no surgery. However, I would recommend doing more warm-up and cool-down stretches then offered on the DVD, preferably the old-school stretches. I hold each stretch for 30 seconds each. My knees are not really bad, but when I do this workout they hurt afterward. Remember, joint pain is never good! Do not ""work"" through it. I have found that wearing knee braces just to help stabilize my knees really works. I never have pain during or after workouts thanks to the braces.

I now own this DVD, along with 30-day shred. My major complaint is that Jillian does not switch which side she starts on. She always starts on the right, so I have to remember to switch on my own. I try to start with my left first because it is weaker and it is thought to be good for the brain to shake things up a bit.",1263340800,3,1200,4.429864253393665

I wasn't able to weigh myself through out that time, but I didn't really see a huge difference. I did notice my endurance was getting better and I had more energy. So I went and bought No More Trouble Zones. I think 30Day Shred really got me ready for the longer 40min workouts. It kicked my butt let me tell you! Ive been doing this DVD for 2.5wks and have lost a total of 12lbs, thats including watching what I eat as well. I like the strength moves and toning but I wanted more cardio.

over all though, it's a good dvd. good instructions and great exercises.really good for toning.  now, if you want all this plus great cardio, i would check out the beach body insanity series. i am telling you, you will sweat like crazy and will feel delirious at times b/c it's sooo fast and sooo challenging. if anyone out there has tried BFBM and beach body insanity, i'd like to hear your opinion.

I love it because she does exercises that I've never done before and I thought I had done them all. I thought I was in shape already but this DVD clearly showed me that I'm not. I know it will definitely tone me because my body is not used to doing these kind of exercises. I was sweating like a pig on this one and No more trouble zones.

I was able to get through all the circuits in the workout on my first try but after 40 minutes, I started having to take a lot of breaks.  I am writing this review after doing this workout once.  It may not seem right to give a review after doing a workout once but in the days following this workout, I have tried, Leslie Sansome 4 mile Express workout, Kathy Smith Kickboxing Workout, Jillian Michael's 30 day shred, P90x Plyometrics, and P90x Kempo X.  Compared to those workout routines, I still prefer this workout the most.

Why?  Because
1) It doesn't involve weights or any extra equipment
2) It starts off slow but then picks up so you can ease into the exercise
3) It's easy to follow, uses uncomplicated but effective moves, and Jillian doesn't do the moves so fast that you are scrambling to follow.
4) Banish Fat Boost Metabolism is a full body workout that involves body sculpting, abs/core, and cardio all in one.

I will say that if you are out of shape or over weight, it is a better idea to start off with the Jillian Michael's 30 day shred and once you are able to do levels 2-3 back to back, you can do the Banish Fat Boost Metabolism workout easier.  This workout is 1 hr.",1262563200,,1366,4.25968992248062

Also, as a Bio and nutrition major, I can agree that JIlian did her homework and she really knows what she's talking about. It's a fun workout, absolutely buy it.",1262563200,,626,4.5
3718098,3,B001NFNFN0,"I started doing this DVD and I stopped after the second set workouts...it looks great, but its a bit unrealistic for someone who just started to catch on. I wheezing and coughing 10 mins in. You have to work up to this level.",1262476800,5,225,4.255813953488372
3718099,5,B001NFNFN0,"As with all the best workouts, I have a total love/hate relationship with ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"". Of course I ""hate"" it because it's so challenging--this is a workout that will leave you sweating and feeling the burn without fail, and even after months of doing it I still find some moves very challenging. But then, I ""love"" it for the results, and for how great I feel after I've completed the workout.

Jillian will take you through a full warm-up before the workout begins, and then a good cool-down at the end. The moves are not at all difficult to learn, which I appreciate, and with the various circuits it does not get boring, not even after months of doing the program. Jillian is great at keeping you motivated as well, even when you feel ready to give up and turn off the TV. If you are just starting a workout program and not in the best shape, or have problems with some jogging/bouncing moves, you may have to modify your steps at least at first. But she also shows you how to do that for some of the trickier ones, so that you can feel very accomplished when in time you can work up to doing the full moves.

Overall this is a great program, especially when used in conjunction with her ""No More Troublezones"" program for strength training and muscle toning. I try to do each one at least once a week to break things up with the other walking and cardio exercise programs I use. It's definitely worth the money and you WILL feel challenged--but not impossibly so.",1262390400,,1486,4.459558823529412

WRONG. I hate it! And the reason I hate it is because, no matter how many times I try it, I can never get through it. By the third circuit, I feel like I'm dying and I physically cannot do anymore. I have tried it many, many times, and it never gets easier. While I like working hard, I don't like trying to do a DVD that I find physically impossible.",1262131200,10,528,3.8981481481481484

I was huffing and puffing by the first 20 minutes - and soaked!  I was very impressed and I know I'll be super-sore tomorrow. My sister and I are planning on starting the 30 Day Shred on Sunday, but I might alternate every other day with this DVD.  I'll continue doing this throughout the rest of the week.  I highly recommend it.",1262044800,,609,4.441441441441442
3718103,5,B001NFNFN0,"Guys. Seriously. This is a killer. I love Jillian, and know that she will always deliver. This is her circuit workout on steroids. Not each circuit makes you want to vomit, so that's good, but two of them will (the second and the second to the last circuits you will HAVE to stop--and if you don't, bravo). I am in excellent shape, work out at least five days a week, and this kicked my arse. You don't need any equipment for this dvd. LOTS of plyometric ""jump work"" as Jillian calls it. There are, I think, six circuits and they go fast but it's tough. TRUST.

Here are some more dvds I do (since I get asked a lot!). Not that you know me, but whatever. These aren't in any particular order, just ones I like.

1. Biggest Loser: Cardio Max

2. Biggest Loser: Last chance workout

**You need a set of 3 or 5 lb weights w/ Biggest Loser workouts. Always good to have anyway!

3. The Firm: 500 cal workout (w/ Kelsie--she's a great instructor)

4. The Firm: Bootcamp maximum calorie burn (with Alison)

**The Firm workouts tend to be dancey, which is not good for Clydes like me, and you'll have to watch/do them a few times before you get the hang of it, but it's worth it. And then once you know the workout you'll feel like you actually have rhythm, which is nice. I generally just use the 5 lb weights w/ the Firm, but I also have a pair of 3 lb. weights.

5. Jillian Michaels: No more trouble zones

6. Turbo Jam: Cardio Party (1) **this is a fun one for when you are a little short on time. Make sure you get some 1 lb weighted hand weights (you can get them for $12 at Academy--don't pay $60 for the Beachbody ones, insane.)

7. Billy Blanks anything (but can be dancey). I like the Tae-Bo Amped Live in Hollywood--it's a bit shorter, and you can modify it to make it harder (just add your own stuff in when he's running his mouth). You will need the Tae-Bo Amped bar for this one if you want to actually get a work out.

8. Yoga Zone : Power Yoga for Strength and Endurance (with Lisa Bennett)**I love her, and this is my favorite yoga dvd

9. MTV Power Yoga with Kristin McGee (also very good)

Have fun, get out there, and DO IT!",1261958400,11,2137,4.19559902200489
3718104,4,B001NFNFN0,"This is a good video to have in a library.  The workout is intense, but can get stagnant as they are pretty basic exercises that I have done before.

3718105,5,B001NFNFN0,"This is the cardio sister of no more trouble zones.  This workout runs a little over 50 minutes.  This video requires no weights and is largely targeted at cardio conditioning and body toning.  I have used this video for months and it continues to be one of my favorites because it is a fabulous workout for those of us in pretty decent physical shape.  The workout is based on 6 minute circuits that each center on different sections of the body.  This one will make you sweat and feel fantastic at the end. There are modifications for beginners through advanced.
Its hard to find workouts that are not too easy and boring.  If you are looking for a more challenging video, this is a great choice.",1261699200,2,698,4.5
3718106,5,B001NFNFN0,"This is an excellent workout for anyone intimidated by the more dance-oriented videos.  There are no complex dance moves.

I also recommend this workout as a cardio adjunct to weight lifting.  Some of the other popular workout DVDs use hand weights with high repetitions, and could interfere with a program of heavy weight lifting for hypertrophy and strength.  This routine is less likely to do that.

This is also a great workout to take on the road, because it doesn't require any equipment.

It is not perfect, however.  My criticisms are small, but they are:

(1)  The exercises could be better timed to the music.  That would make it easier to keep the right timing.

(2)  Occasionally, the cuing could be better.  I find the transition into burpees a bit awkward, for example, and I think Jillian miscues on the second set of uppercuts.

(3)  Jillian refers to this workout being ""aerobic"" or even ""extremely aerobic"".  I am pretty sure most people, even the very fit, will be into anaerobic work at points.  It's still a great routine--just a confusing use of that term, in my opinion.

Despite these slight issues, I do recommend this DVD enthusiastically.  It's my cardio fitness benchmark.",1261267200,4,1200,4.851485148514851

I did this for the first-time today and got through the entire workout, but was more at the beginner level with some of the moves (like scissor kicks).  I also had to stop a couple of times, thought I'd pass out.  I've also tried Jillian's 30-day Shred, awesome workout and next workout to do is No More Trouble Zones.  I really like Jillian. She's a little gruff, but you'll get results if you stick with her!  I've got about 10 lbs to lose and will update with my results.  Good luck!",1260316800,,565,4.283018867924528

3718112,5,B001NFNFN0,"I am a big fan of Jillian's, I've had this dvd for 6 months. I only did it a handful of times in the past, because it is really hard. After months of counting calories and not getting serious about exercise, I wasn't really losing weight very fast. So I decided to get serious, and pulled out this dvd and did it for 7 days straight (while still counting calories of course), and I lost 4 pounds. I did nothing different than I had been the months before except this dvd.  I read some of the other reviews where people are saying it's too hard.  It's supposed to be hard! You aren't going to lose weight unless you actually sweat and struggle. You aren't going to lose weight if you are comfortable while working out.  I know, because I have tried doing it that way and it doesn't work for me.

It's true that some of the exercises in this video are hard, or you may not be able to do them properly as shown. For example, I can't do the scissor jumping lunge, so I just do a regular jumping lunge. My version of the mountain climber exercise is pretty lame looking I'm sure, but I still do it. My 180's are probably more like 140's. It doesn't matter. If you really want to do the workout, you can modify it so you can do it, as long as you're giving yourself a hard workout and are actually trying.

If you have serious knee problems, cut back on the jumping.",1259971200,42,1360,4.195402298850575
3718113,3,B001NFNFN0,"First of all, windmills (or as Jillian calls them ""alternating toe touches"" have been known to be bad for your back for about 20 years now. Repetitive bending at the lumbar spine with your knees straight---isn't that what they tell you NOT to do at all of your ergonomic meetings at work? So her warm-up is a little sketchy.

The workout itself is okay. This is not a low impact aerobic video, and is more suited for someone who is in decent shape.  There are lower impact variations of most of the moves she does.  But, you'd be better off buying a video more suited for low impact aerobics that trying to adjust this one to fit your needs.

I can't imagine doing this video over and over again, as it is one 40 minute workout.  I would think most people would get bored with it after seven or so times in a row.  Jillian says if we keep doing this workout with her, we'll look like her models. I'm sure we would die of boredom before then.

I expected a lot more out of a Jillian Michaels video, but I don't do many of these.  I wanted something I could do at home while my babies were sleeping or otherwise occupied.  I also bought P90X which I love (and hate at the same time because it's so hard) and I thought I could use Jillian's video during the aerobic day.  Maybe.

Jillian keeps your heart pumping for the entire 50 minutes through a series of kickboxing, old-school calesthenics and some core work.  I travel frequently for my job, and was also able to complete this DVD in my hotel room and without any equipment other than my own body weight.

3718118,3,B001NFNFN0,"First, the good points. This DVD is reasonably priced, so it doesn't make fitness unaffordable. The exercises really are challenging, so there is a lot of room to grow into the disc once you buy it. I am in pretty good shape, and was sore for the next two days after doing it. The circuits were really challenging.

Downsides:
I would have liked more cardio, or maybe just more interesting cardio. She was talking about how you should be feeling your chest pounding at this point...doing just some jumping jacks or running in place. I felt like, ""eh, whatever."" But then again, I'm not a couch potato. But I feel like I get a better CARDIO workout in Zumba, running, or dancing at a club. (However, the circuits really did push my upper body and abs and I like that).

I think Michael's style is kind of blah, but that's a personal thing. A lot of people really seem to love her no-nonsense approach.

This workout would not be very good for beginners just starting out. It would take some work to be able to do some of the circuits.

I would not say I had ""fun"" doing this workout. It's not really something I would do by choice. If it's raining or too windy outside to run and I don't have time to drive to the gym, then it's okay to get in my 60 minutes of exercise for the day--but given the choice between this and a 3-mile run or an hour of zumba, this tape would be last on my list.

I will just say this I sweated my behind off, and huffed and puffed. The moves are difficult especially the planks from elbow to str8 arm . My God this woman knows torture moves. LOL. I did finish all 7 circuits but skipped the cool down. I went for a brezzy walk I needed air quickly. lol Variety is the key to staying with any exercise plan/routine.

This kicked my butt.  I'm not in very good shape, coming off several months of being pretty lazy as life got the better of my workout plans.  So I'm feeling it, that's for sure!  I really like Jillian Michael's style.  Some of the very cutesy fitness gurus annoy me.  I just want to yell at the tv ""You can't see me!  You have no idea whether I'm feeling the burn or not!""  Jillian's style is different- she says that you SHOULD be feeling the burn or you aren't working hard enough.  Same basic idea, but I find it much less annoying and more motivating.

Some of the exercises were just plain challenging.  The mountain climbers and 180's were incredibly difficult.  I could only do about 1 in every 3 or 4 that Jillian and the other two girls could do.  But at the end of the time, I was still huffing, puffing and cursing Jillian under my labored breath.  I can already feel muscles hurting that I didn't even know existed!

There's a lot- A LOT- of jumping.  Jumping squats, jumping scissor kicks, jump rope, etc.  So if you have severe knee or ankle problems, this might not be the video for you.  I couldn't do all the high jumps, could only manage little baby jumps.  But I'll try to work my way up to doing the bigger kicks.

3718134,5,B001NFNFN0,"After reading the reviews on Amazon, I took the plunge and bought this DVD.

I am in my early 40s,50 pounds overweight, sedentary, and haven't worked out in 20 months. I am allergic to cardio and all forms of exercise.

Also, I hate gyms and whenever I have to whip myself into shape, prefer to make a fool of myself in the privacy of my own home.

2 years ago, I lost over 22 pounds in 4 months, following a very low cal diet( 1000 daily calories sometimes starving myself down to 700) and exercising 5 times a week, at least.

At first, the weight didn't come off because I was counting walking to town for 30 minutes as cardio and exercising 3-4 times a week doing toning through Callanetics ( Best toning results in the world!).

I had been told that the best way to lose weight was through walking for one hour on the treadmill 5 times a week but not do high impact aerobics.

I successfully reshaped my body with the help of Callanetics, 20 minutes to 30 minutes of cardio with the 10 Minutes Solution Dance it Off DVD, plus 30 minutes walking from my home to Downtown.

As soon as I introduced cardio dance, I got faster results. I started to realise that my body needed higher impact cardio to slim down and heavy sweating.

Introducing Jillian Michaels Banish Fat Boost Your Metabolism!
I was really scared reading here that some intermediate to advanced exercisers could not go through it, I expected to not be able to go through the whole workout at first. Also, I have sprained both my ankles in the past 2 years and have knee problems,and lower back weakness through a fall, 10 years ago. I tried jumping rope for cardio but  it killed my back, so I was very very cautious starting Jillian's workout.

I almost died and threw up but managed to go through the whole DVD doing modifications as follows:

Squats with scissor legs:

I squat then straighten my left leg without jumping and scissor the right leg, pointing the tip of my right foot at the knee level of my left leg,it's like making a triangle shape with the legs, then I alternate legs.

Butt kicks:

I walk instead of running.

Cross Country skying:

I do not jump. I lunge on alternate  foot ,in a walking motion, so that I always have one foot on the floor, instead of both in the air, with the scissor motion of jumping.

Jogging high knees:

I walk instead of running.

I have done the DVD 5 times in the past 2 weeks and have lost 0.7 % body fat and about 1 pound.

My belly that looked like I had given birth to triplets the day before, is now noticeably reduced and my obliques are showing. I can tell that fat has been lost but also I have more vitality and cardio endurance. I now walk with a dynamic stride and do not feel as winded as before when I walk up 2 flights of stairs.

More importantly, I am motivated because I am seeing results and I am proud of myself that I can stick through such a grueling workout.

The only thing I don't like in the DVD is the music and the goddawful infomercial in the Bonuses. Because of those, I would give this DVD 4 and a half stars.",1254700800,10,3058,4.298429319371728
3718135,5,B001NFNFN0,I'm not going to give you the details like other reviews. All I can say is that I've been working out using JM videos and occasionally going to the gym for 6 months now and though I thought I was in pretty darn good shape considering I do Level 3 of the Shred...this video KICKS MY BUTT every single time. I couldn't even get through the 4th circut the first time through. It's tough! I would suggest that if you are not yet in decent shape or not used to working out yet that you first do the 30 Day Shred. Once you build up your fitness level....then move on to Banish Fat. It is no joke! I'm sweating my tail off by the 2nd circut and I'm sore the next day. Awesome add to your JM collection! Don't bother with the 5 DVD set. Go for the Shred and Banish Fat...you won't be sorry.,1254614400,3,782,4.051612903225807

If you want a great cardio work out, this video should do it for you. Lots of kickboxing moves which made this fun for me. I also own No more trouble zones which is great for strength training and just as tough. What I like about these DVDs is the feeling you get afterwards. You feel so accomplished.

3718142,5,B001NFNFN0,"I've done plenty of exercise videos but I like Jillians the most. She's tough but with reason. Her tough approach works on me because I really feel like im going to get scolded or let her down if I don't finish the workouts. I'm 22 and find it hard to get through some of the circuits. Some are really hard and some are do-able. Sometimes I feel like giving up because my hearts just pounding like crazy but I continue because something about Jillian's firmness makes me want to prove it to ""her"" that I can do it.

I am currently reading her Master Your Metabolism book and am learning a lot.

I hope I never get tired of her workouts because I really enjoy working out with her.",1252540800,2,680,4.263565891472868
3718143,5,B001NFNFN0,"I've been working out to this video for a couple of months now. I also have 30 Day Shred and No More Trouble Zones. I think this workout is amazing. It has totally blasted my metabolism through the roof! I find I get better results from this vid doing it 3-5 times a week than when I was spending two hours in a gym almost daily. She teaches compound and jumping moves, and this is extremely effective. You get strong AND lean before you know it. I used the 30 Day Shred more as a 4 month re-acquaintance into fitness after a long hiatus from not doing a thing. When I was able to get through that relatively easily, I got this video. It is TOUGH! And believe me, it doesn't really get easier. Oh sure, you can get through it without dying eventually, but you now have all these brilliant new muscles that are bucking like broncos, and you are focusing on training them because now you can actually feel them working, and not just struggling to keep you upright. Your cardiovascular condition will greatly benefit, and so will your overall lean muscle mass.

Be forewarned - this is NOT for beginners to fitness. If you know how to modify fitness moves, then maybe you are better off than the stark beginner. Jillian's workouts are easily modified. But it is my feeling that total beginners could get themselves injured easily if they don't build up some basic strength and flexibility for at least 3 months or more. The 30 Day Shred has 3 workouts that can either shred the already fit, or build a solid foundation for the not fit if they just take their time with it.

By the way, I have gone from 155 to 139 and I'm still losing. It's taken me over 6 months, but right now the metabolism is amazing, and the results are really getting noticeable. I am convinced that all you need is time, patience and a metabolism that increases through steady workouts, and you will get lean and strong. Jillian's workouts are inspiring and efficient.",1252540800,33,1939,4.47457627118644

Had it been any other instructor I would have quit -- but Jillian just pushes me like no other video (DVD) instructor does (hate her)...... my endorance, focus, whatever is ten fold ------ yes this is like her others but if Jillian can motovate you it does not matter what DVD you pick she will push your buttons (if she is the one you need now) -- If I do several weeks of her DVD's ( and I have several) I blow through some of my tried an trues ----- without working out a sweat. Don't get me wrong my tried and trues still can get the heart rate up! LOL but not for nothing I can tell the difference.

BFBM is an amazing cardio and it targets more muscle groups than your average jog. In fact, this video, according to my heart rate monitor/calorie counter thing, burns more calories during the time than running. It really is worth it.",1252540800,,400,4.569444444444445
3718146,5,B001NFNFN0,"Another slam dunk by Jillian Michaels! I purchased all three of Jillian's workout DVDs (No More Trouble Zones, 30 day shred and Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism) and this workout delivered just like the rest. I enjoy the fast pace of her workouts, her explanations and motivation and the use of circuit training to prevent feeling overworked or bored.

It's easy to see why Jillian (and her contestants) have such success on the Biggest Loser. Jillian is encouraging but tough and really pushes you to the breaking point. I enjoyed her constant reminders of why I was working out in the first place which helps when you're working through some serious pain.

Of the three DVDs, this is the only one that requires no equipment--no weights, just your body weight. It's just you and some intense cardio! Jillian mixes in many different styles of exercise, including kickboxing/karate and plyometrics (aka jump training). She also focuses on the midsection quite a bit and really hits the oblique muscles in particular, which is my personal problem area, so I loved that. There are a few exercises in this workout that are included on her other DVDs, but most are ""new"" to this workout. It is very intense and I found myself struggling to keep up and hitting my own ""personal pause button"" as Tony Horton likes to say on P90X. It left me feeling like I had a great workout and the time passed quickly while going through each of the (7) six-minute circuits.

While I do feel Jillian does a great job explaining why and exercise is being done or how it works, I find disappointment in that she doesn't fully show how an exercise is properly done before jumping into it feet first. She'll say, ""Let's move on to super skaters!"" and then begin the exercise, expecting you to figure it out yourself. Perhaps it's just because it is the first time through, but I felt myself trying to analyze what was going on to ensure I had the exercise down correctly.

Overall, this is a great workout and I felt it was worth every penny. I'm glad that I purchased all three of Jillian's DVD workouts because I can easily mix them up throughout the week for a great overall workout. As someone who is very active as a runner and cyclist, I think these workouts are a great alternative and a way to improve my overall strength. While keeping up with Jillian can be difficult for even the most seasoned exerciser, she provides plenty of opportunity to change the moves based on your ability. I found each exercise to be challenging and it's actually nice to have something to work towards. I would recommend every one of her DVDs to a friend!",1252540800,,2615,4.6414686825053995

3718150,5,B001NFNFN0,"I already had the 30 Day Shred DVD, but I really wanted a workout that was entirely cardio.  Thankfully, Jillian delivers a heart-pounding aerobic workout in only 40 minutes.  Before this DVD, I considered myself an intermediate/advanced exerciser; I workout 5-6 days a week, including weightlifting, cardio, and rock climbing.  But I have always hated cardio and find it too boring to really challenge myself.

Compared to the 30 Day Shred, Jillian has a much more developed style.  She gives better cues and more fully explains why the exercises are paired.  Jillian is also really engaging, but after the first 2 circuits I had to stop and catch my breath.  I think there are few people out there who will not be challenged by this workout!",1251849600,,743,4.849206349206349

3718152,5,B001NFNFN0,"Jillian is tough and mean and an excellent trainer. I was really happy with the progress I'd made with my weight loss goals from doing the 30 Day Shred DVD and I wanted to amp things up. I work out ~5x a week combining Jillian's DVDs with some other home workouts and the elliptical machine - so I'm pretty active and my cardio's in tip top shape. Nevertheless, all that means nothing when I do Jillians' Banish Fat workout. Man oh man does the sweat pour! And plyometrics are evil (my neighbors below me probably agree) - but this workout is excellent.

I wanted to wait until after a month of doing this exercise to review it because my first concern with any workout is results -- and Jillian definitely delivers. I've already lost about 7 lbs and quite a few ""will-never-ever-miss-them-ever!"" inches from my stomach and thighs.

I've got those sexy racer lines on my abs now and my legs are shaping up into something awesome. And my shoulders... jeez, I'm getting compliments!

As for the DVD format, I like the way it's broken up into circuits and it appears that each circuit is designed to slowly bring your heart up until it's revving in your chest, then there's ""active recovery"" [read Core circuit], and then some more serious revving which in sum = really effective. I also like that it's just you and your mat - no weights or bands, etc. And I like that, unlike the 30 Day Shred, you're pretty much standing up the whole time instead of get up, get back down on the floor, get back up, down on the floor again, get up... and so on.

I've read some criticisms about the music, which is sort of cheesy, but after listening to it over and over again for the past month I've decided it works with each circuit. I especially like the Jason-esque music on circuit 6 - it's totally appropriate b/c that circuit is a killer.

I also bought her No More Trouble Zones and combine it with Banish Fat for a 2 hour torture session. After all the jumping and explosive movement in Banish, doing the No More Trouble Zones DVD feels like a gift [albeit a rough one].

However, you don't have to combine them both to get a good workout -- they both are excellent on their own and will definitely yield results.",1251244800,15,2205,4.445544554455446
3718153,5,B001NFNFN0,I love this dvd. It's a great work out and fun to do. I have a few of her others and this one is absolutely great! Its easy and gets you going.,1250553600,,143,3.5

After doing this workout for 10 minutes I was dripping sweat! This is by far the best exercise dvd I have ever bought. The moves aren't difficult to get down, but they sure as heck push your body to new limits. I feel GREAT after doing this workout, it felt amazing to sweat out all of those toxins and give my body a great boost. You will not regret buying this dvd, and the only reason you would ever stop using it is because it really kicks your butt! Buy this!",1250467200,3,596,4.2368421052631575
3718155,5,B001NFNFN0,"I purchased this DVD along with the 30 day Shred and Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism. I must say that I was blown away with the intensity of the workout. Jullian's advice and encouragement throughout was also very helpful.

I am a mom of a 5 month old and had a c-section. Also, I had stayed away from exercises (other than a little walking) ever since I became pregnant. Hence, I was apprehensive about doing this. The first day I did this workout, I was so tired that I almost wanted to puke. However, at the same time, I immensely enjoyed the workouts. All the exercises are to the point and you can feel your muscles getting toned. I have been alternating between the three DVDs for around a month now. It is already showing results.

To put things in perspective, even before I started the DVDs, I was back to my pre-pregnancy weight. Though I have a tendency to put on weight really quick and lose it really slow, through proper and balanced diet, I have managed to be on the slim side. So, my problem was not of excess weight but having the fat in the wrong places. My problem areas were my tummy, which with the pregnancy had gotten flabby and kind of loose; and my butt which was again not toned. With the exercises, I have started getting into shape. My pregnancy belly has completely disappeared and my tummy muscles and butt have gotten toned. In fact, I AM IN BETTER SHAPE THAN I WAS PRE-PREGNANCY.

I strongly urge ppl out there to do yourself the biggest favor you ever can and buy this DVD (along with the other 2 DVDs that I have mentioned above; Besides it just cost me around $30, which is less than one meal for 2 and this is the best investment that I have ever ever made). Keep in mind that this DVD works not just for women but also men. The days I exercise as per the DVD, I can actually feel happier and more in peace and far more energetic, than if I dont.

As I mentioned earlier, I have a 5 month old and I am a working mom. So, that is enough to occupy me the entire day and tire me out so that I am ever so ready to sleep around 9-9.30 pm) Just so that I can exercise, I get up at around 4 am (as that is the only time I get to exercise in one stretch without having to stop to attend to my child). This is how much I love this DVD and would not want to miss it.

Try it and you won't regret it ever.

I can work out on equipment in my basement for a long time daily. I thought I was fit and in shape. This workout Proves I have room for improvement. It is a killer, though might be easy for the 20 year olds.
This DVD proves that one always has room for improvement in life! and I am very pleased I found this DVD.
What I really want to know ( and I hope someone can answer this), how many calories does a 5'4"" 112 lb female burn when she completes this workout? Granted the calories burned will vary from person to person, but, I wish Jillian addressed this on the DVD case or on her website.

It is a 40-mins workout consisting of 7 6-minute circuits.  Don't let the easy to follow routines fool you, this workout burns!!  And it works.  Stay consistent (at least 4-5 days a week) and you'll see an improvement as I have, with the proper diet (see Jillian's website).  For beginners I recommend pacing yourself & doing a few circuits at a time until you are able to do all the routines.",1249603200,,521,4.7444444444444445
3718158,5,B001NFNFN0,"Ok.  This video is no joke.  I had done the 30 day shred a bit before buying this DVD and I found that moderately hard.  I liked Jillian's style and I could tell she knows her stuff, so I decided to try this.

This video is made up of 7 six minute circuits, including about another 6 minutes of warm-up and 6 minutes of cool down.  All tolled, when you shut off the DVD in your pile of sweat, it will be at about 55 minutes.  I wasn't really sure what to expect at first, but I was determined to get through the whole thing without stopping.  I did, but it nearly killed me.  The first circuit was not that hard, so I got lulled into a false sense of security.  The next ones take it up a notch.  By the end of the second circuit, I was hurting, and panting.  She gives you what she calls a ""break"" at the end of the 3rd cicuit with side oblique crunches.  Basically, it's not really cardio,  you just put your hand behind your head and raise your leg out to the side, crunching your side.  You pay for it in the next circuit... circuit 4... it's a core circuit, but it moves superfast and it's intense.  It still feels like cardio.  She throws those damn walking planks into this circuit.  I hate these.  I do the advanced version, no knees for me.  The next circuit is another kickboxing one.  It takes it back down a notch, but it's still hard.  The 6th one is the hardest one, I think because it's all jump work... plyometrics.  You will do jump squats, cross country skiing, scissor kicks (AHHH!) skaters, and standing mountain climbers (go to hell standing mountain climbers!).  The last circuit is not a whole hell of a lot easier, and trust me by the time you get here, you have just about had it.  You're going to be dripping sweat, but you will have given up trying to wipe it off yourself because it is so profuse and everything in your body is screaming at you and you have simply given up on catching your breathe, but Jillian makes you feel like stopping is not an option.

Someone else mentioned that you will not look hot immediately after doing this... very true.  But after showering and resting, you will feel great about what you did.

I still do this non-stop sometimes, but other days I will do the first 4 cicuits in the morning and then do the rest in the evening.  Although Jillian might consider this cheating, I feel like it's a good way to still do the whole video and kill myself a little less.

I am an avid exerciser.  I hit it for 1 to 2 hours everyday and have done so for years.  I weigh between 110-115 at 5' 4""  I wouldn't mind losing a few pounds, but mainly exercise just to stay in good health and stay toned.  My point is, I am no wimp to find this exercise routine so difficult.  You had better be up for a challenge if when you start this and/or be prepared to pace yourself or maybe not get through the whole thing the first few times.

Good luck!",1249516800,38,2890,4.202185792349726
3718159,4,B001NFNFN0,"This is an excellent workout video in my opinion. A solid 40 minutes of blood pumping and sweating. Lots of great explosive action. You can choose different circuits if you don't have time for the full workout, or go straight through the video and enjoy one of Jillian's best, most inspirational cool downs to date.
The only thing that bugs about this video is her backup help this time. They are extremely fit, and much more flexible than Jill, but you can see most of the time that they aren't giving the workout all they've got, especially when Jillian goes to them and gets them as high/fast/hard as they can and then Jill comes back to center and they are back to doing it the same way I HAVE to do it. Dissappointing.
But it will still bust your ass and make you feel like a rockstar! Go get it, if you need a change up in your routine, or to kick start some energy.",1249516800,,872,4.290909090909091
3718160,5,B001NFNFN0,"This video is really great. It's tough, but oh-so worth it.
The first time I did it, I was more beat than after a gym session, or my usual 5 mile run, mainly because I was using muscles I usually don't work out.
It was great. I had to stop it a few times, but I love that, because that means that I have something to work toward-- it will be a while before I need a harder DVD.
After 2 or 3 uses, my body was tighter, my stomach was flat (!!!), which is a huge thing for me, because I ALWAYS have a little belly, even though I'm far from fat.
It's a fabulous option for when you can't get to the gym or you don't want to go for a run, or bike ride, or whatever.
My arms and legs are much stronger, my a** is awesome, haha, and even the sides of my thighs where it's usually ""soft"" are muscle-y.

One more thing-- for me, when I work out at the gym or run, now, I have more motivation to go harder, because it really amps up the level of your workout, and reminds you that to get better, you need to get uncomfortable. For me, it reminded me of when I used to do martial arts, and the amount of ""push"" I needed to get through a class.

For this particular Jillian video, no weights are needed and Jillian constantly reminds you that when you don't have money for a gym membership, you can always use your own body weight, which is a really nice concept to think about when working out.

I mainly run for my exercise but I bought Jillian's 30 day shred to rotate during the week in place of my runs to switch up how my muscles were working out. I loved the Shred so much I bought this dvd and recently ordered No Trouble Zones also. With the dvds being so inexpensive, it allows me to get a large variety of OUTSTANDING workouts without breaking my budget.

Yes, they are challenging...but it is really great knowing that you are getting cardio and muscle toning for your entire body throughout the workout. Like Jillian says...""dont phone in your workouts!"" :)",1248307200,,900,4.515337423312883
3718164,4,B001NFNFN0,"Alright, here's the scoop-this is not a beginner workout, and intermediates may be lost by the wayside as well on some of the drills.  Jillian takes you through a course of seven 6 minute circuits.  Now remember who we are dealing with here....Jillian will be pushing you HARD and 6 minutes will seem like a really long time on some of the more challenging circuits, so don't think this will be easy.  There are classic exercises, such as jumping jacks & jogging in place, some kickboxing moves, plyometric jumping, mat exercises, etc.

I found that some areas I was really good at-kickboxing (I do it a couple times a week), and the standing cardio stuff, but where I saw the real slow down of that 6 minutes for me was the exercises that put me in a pushup and had me do mountain climbing, which switches the legs up toward the chest in an alternating pattern and the one where you start in a pushup drop one elbow, drop the other and then go back up to a full push up stance again.  Ok, so, this will really highlight those areas that need work...

On cuing the moves-excellent!  Good form & good modifications

On dialog-excellent-enough to keep me motivated-my favorite being the (just a couple more-Oh thank GOD!) I definitely like the non-chatty, no bs, get to the point instruction.  The last thing I want at o'dark thirty in the morning is chirpy instruction from the skinny chick.

On moves-excellent moves that get your heart rate up and make you feel like you are really accomplishing something here.

On music selection: I didn't notice it until the last segments, and it may just be me, but it sounded like Friday the 13th, music-well, I suppose that WOULD motivate me to move faster, but not really what I like in music.....

On fun factor-this is my own thing.  I have to have a bit of a fun factor in my workouts-do I feel like I will go back to it because I enjoy doing it?  Kickboxing? fun, dancin?, fun, old school butt kicking work-out-effective, but not high on the fun factor, so a little bit of a deduction here. I will do it because it is good for me, but it probably will be edged out by kickboxing/pilates or yoga on some days due to low ""fun"" factor....

Overall feeling when through-like I had really worked out hard-sweaty for sure and felt like I had really worked.  I work out 7 days a week, so you know this is a good indication that the level of intensity and challenge is good.

Overall, a really good work out.  On my ""I feel fat"" days this will definitely move to the top of the workout pile.  Even without feeling ""fluffy"" I would probably do it once a week or so, to mix it into my other workouts.

If you like Jillian's no BS style and kick butt workouts, this is one to add to your collection.

I do not think that this is a Beginner's Workout. I work out 6 days a week a minimum of one hour at a time doing Yoga moves, Dance, Tae Bo and Gilad Body Toning and this beats them all! This is tough! There are several circuits where you do a mix of exercises that will have you burning half way through. Each circiut makes you repeat the same exercise twice, so if you aren't on fire the first time, you can bet you will be the second.

(out of a 45 min. workout) not because I was tired, but because I just couldn't keep up with some of the moves - the DVD allows you to pick and choose which circuits you want to do, or you can just do the entire workout without any breaks, which is what I tried to do - but I'm up for the challenge and expect that soon (like tomorrow) I'll be completing the whole workout - the overall pace of the workout is a bit less hectic than 30-day Shred so 45 min. is definitely doable - by the way, I'm 56 years old - I think that this workout will become a staple for me and I can recommend it highly.",1247875200,,870,4.034682080924855

OH MAN i did that earlier today for the first time and it put me in my place REAL FAST. i thought i was doing pretty great because Level 2 of the 30 Day Shred wasn't having the same sweating effects on me anymore and when i tried Level 3 for the first time- it wasn't as bad as i thought... so i pop in Banish Fat and oooooh by the end of the 40 min  video my legs were shaking and my world was spinning. I was literally laying on the hard tile floor wondering if i would even bother doing this again. i did the whole video but i did not like it one bit. BUT I know what i want.

The best part about this dvd is that I find it is slightly low impact, while still managing to keep my heart rate up. There isn't as much bouncing, jumping, etc but I am still working out strong, which I cannot claim for a lot of low impact dvd's.

The only concern I have is about the overuse of certain muscles. Both this dvd and the 30 day shred have a lot of exercises that involve bearing your weight on your arms (like mountain climbers.) For me, I develop forearm pain from the strain of doing too many of these exercises, no matter how much I try to strengthen this area. So, if this is a weakness for you too, try substituting some of these exercises with ones you can do standing, like jumping jacks for example. This seems to help me with the risk of overusing my forearms.

But all in all, great workout, this one is definitely a keeper.",1247616000,,961,4.3277777777777775

At the beginning, I thought 'the reviews were wrong, it's not that hard!' but as I got into it I realized that the reviews are spot on. It is a KILLER cardio workout. I'm on day 8 of 30 Day Shred and I don't know if I'll even bother to keep doing it now that I've found this and No More Trouble Zones because they are longer, harder and burn more calories so I think they will produce better results in a shorter amount of time.

I was breathing like I had run a 25 mile marathon and felt like passing out.  The next morning I could barely get out of bed I was so sore.  But I pushed myself to do it every day.  And within 1 single day, I had dropped a pound and a half and the weight kept peeling off of me after that.  This dvd literally allowed my body to push through that annoying weight loss plateau.  Inches have come off of my body measurements over a couple of weeks too and I'm already fitting into an old pair of jeans from over a year ago - yay!  I pretty much can eat whatever I want (within reason) and the weight still is peeling off.  It's awesome.  The only thing that has kept me from giving this video 5 stars is how annoying some of Jillian's comments are.  It's all I can do not to gag during some of them.  Now I put the TV on in the background to give me something to focus on and it's not a problem, LOL.  If you want fast results, this is definately the workout for you!

Also - I am not a novice exerciser.  I work out every morning before work for about 1 hour - jogging, yoga or exercise videos. I do the 30-day shred videos when I am short on time and I like those- but one hour of that die-hard intensity is too much for a regular workout several days a week.  It is great if you want a video to really kick up the notch of your exercise occasionally - but on a regular basis I think it is just too much.",1245196800,65,726,3.9183673469387754

3718193,5,B001NFNFN0,"I used to be very athletic but since I started graduate school it has been more and more difficult to keep up. About three months ago I decided that I had had enough and I needed to get moving again. Barely any time for workouts and certainly no time for the gym - I began to do some research on a great workout dvd. I found Jillian Michaels through Amazon customer reviews. (although I had heard of the biggest loser I never actually saw the show) I decided to get the 30 day shred. It was amazing. Really, I don't say that lightly. I felt that I was working my butt off in each 20 min workout. After two months of the shred I wanted something else - so I bought this JM dvd. Although I was at level 3 at the shred for some time, the first time I tried to get through this dvd I almost passed out. The work out is really hard with lots of jumping around. And I think because I was used to the 20 minutes it was more difficult to push through the 45 min in this workout. There are seven circuits instead of the 3 in the shred. Each circuit has 4-5 moves and then she repeats the circuit. I kept at the dvd, decided to go back to beginner level with it and kept trying to get through it. Today, I finished her workout from start to finish without taking that extra five second breather. It felt great. What I love about Jillian is that she pushes you to keep trying and to get stronger. If her workouts didn't start out difficult you wouldn't have anything to achieve or look forward to.
For those interested - I saw some other reviewers talk about men doing the workout - and yes I did get my husband to use her dvd's! He says he loves her cardio but the strength moves are focused more on lower body (which he finds difficult) and the upper body moves are a little too easy. He is still using her workouts though and he dropped 15 pounds so far in three weeks!
Bottom line - This is a difficult workout - but don't let that discourage you if you are a beginner! Take it slow - and you will see your body change and your endurance levels increase every time you do her workouts!",1245024000,11,2078,4.108108108108108
3718194,5,B001NFNFN0,"I consider myself a fit individual, but am not so sure now after having popped in this DVD!  It is a rough one and will work you HARD!

I bought this DVD after having purchased a couple of the Biggest Loser workouts.  I was very impressed with Jillian Michaels on those and wanted to try her solo stuff.

The instruction is very good on this DVD.  Jillian does a good job explaining the moves and giving good information on the muscles worked and why the exercises are done the way they are, etc.

I think the only thing I found as a negative is, while she gives an explanation as to how to do certain moves more low-impact, no one really models the low-impact.  Trust me, there were plenty I had to modify!

It is an intense workout.  I like that it is very different from other aerobic dvd's that I am used to.  All that jumping around and constant marching or grapevines, get very old after a while!  This one, however, is not repetitive or boring in any way!

Overall this is a great workout and I'm very excited to continue doing it!",1245024000,4,1038,4.293814432989691

Jillian Michael's generally annoys me on the Biggest Loser but she's great on here. She puts the more complicated combos to a beat and it's easy to remember.

I will definitely take this DVD along when I travel or when I can't get to the gym, as it only uses body weight for resistance.",1244937600,,457,4.376470588235295
3718196,5,B001NFNFN0,"I bought this DVD to reward myself for slowly working my way up to Level 2 of the 30-Day Shred, which took several months because I am not always consistent about working out. I felt pretty confident about my fitness level, because at one point, Level 1 had made me feel like I was going to die, and then Level 2 had the same effect, and now I felt like I was ready for anything.

Well, I had to stop after the first 26 minutes of this video. Partly because I pulled a muscle in my hamstring. And partly because I'm not used to working out this hard for 40 minutes. I am used to having a 26-minute workout with the 30-day shred.

This, by the way, is not easier just because it's cardio with no weights. Not easier at all. I was not expecting this. There are yet more exercises that challenge me! Yet MORE exercises that make me feel like I'm going to die! Lots of explosive pylometrics, lots of compound bodyweight exercises, lots of REAL athlete exercises! YEAH! The only thing harder than this would be CrossFit.

Four caveats:
1. If you've spent some time on the 30-day shred (and even if you haven't), take it easy and be careful with the toe touches during the warm-up. You don't want to pull your hamstring in the warmup like I did because you're going to need your legs to do all that kickboxing later.

2. Don't click on her ""health tips"" video in the bonus section--unless you want to see an cringe-worthy plug from someone you thought was above all that. She says stuff like, ""Eat fresh fruits and vegetables!"" ""Drink plenty of water."" And then, out of nowhere: ""And use an electric toothbrush from Oral B!"" What now? Then her health tips turn into this full-blown infomercial for Oral B electric toothbrushes, starting at $22 each. WTF? Jillian, really, I have developed so much respect for you doing this 30-day shred with you every day for the last year. Don't throw it all away on an electric toothbrush! So, yeah, avoid the bonus section.

3. The redhead in the back is a bit too smiley for me. Neither of those ladies looks like they're trying very hard sometimes. There's one part where Jillian says, ""You should really be breathing hard!"" And it flashes back to the one on the right, and she looks like she's just going through the motions, like this is just a walk in the park. I liked the backup workout ladies on 30-day shred MUCH better. Those ladies were awesome. They looked like they were really struggling, which is just what you want to see when you're struggling, too. I'm having backup workout lady withdrawals.

4. The 5-pounds-a-week claim on the cover is ridiculous unless you're already obese or come down with the flu the same week you work out.

Despite these quibbles, she can keep her five stars because this is one crazy-hard workout and I feel like I'm in pretty good shape. I can run for 60 minutes. I can do Level 2 of 30-Day Shred. But apparently I want to die after 26 minutes of this video. Love that. Makes me feel like if I can get through this, I will be a real athlete. Also, I love Jillian's style. I love that she will tell the truth about how hard we have to work to get results, and I love that she doesn't try to make everything warm and fuzzy. This will definitely get the fat off when combined with a good diet and, of course, an electric Oral B toothbrush starting at $22.",1244592000,"1,152",3329,4.403252032520325

It's great for early morning workouts to wake you up and get the heart rate pumping.

I just want to tell you that, yes, you WILL see results from this, and yes, it IS worth the purchase.  There's no equipment needed, and the greatest thing I've noticed about it is that while I notice myself getting BETTER at the moves, they don't get any EASIER.  Since this relies entirely on your own body, the stronger you get, the harder you can push yourself, and I think this could give anyone a killer workout, no matter their fitness level.
I've had a handful of workout DVDs before, and do some of the shows on FitTV, but I was excited to try something new.  Let me tell you, this KILLS me.  I'm relatively fit, and if I were ANY less strong, I don't think I could do this all the way through.  It takes every ounce from me, and my face is purple at the end.  After my fourth time doing it, my boyfriend noticed that I was ALREADY showing results.  And after 2 or 3 weeks of doing it, I've gone from 125 to 118.
I talked my boyfriend into doing it with me one morning (he's an avid exerciser, but thinks DVDs are ""the easy way out""), and he only made it through 3 of the 7 circuits.  He's been complaining for days now, too-- ""I didn't know I HAD legs until I met Jillian!""

As with all of her videos, there are squats and lunges which are not so great for someone with bad knees (like me)so I simply modify them and go as far as I can.  It's still a great workout even with the modifications! I have never sweat so much with a workout video, as I do with this one. She rocks!",1244160000,,528,4.188118811881188
3718205,5,B001NFNFN0,"This was my first experience with a Jillian Michaels workout DVD and I was very impressed!  I work out regularly and consider myself in pretty good shape, but this DVD left me dripping with sweat (it was actually the first time I've gotten sweat dripping into my eyes...).  I was especially excited about how much energy I had after doing the workout.  Unlike the other 99% of the universe, a lot of workouts leave me tired and wanting to sit on my butt.  However, this workout left me feeling on top of the world!

The workout starts off with a quick warm-up and then heads into seven 6 minute circuits which use kickboxing moves, plyometrics, and a fair amount of core work.  In each circuit, you repeat the set of exercises twice.  You don't need any equipment (well, maybe a sports bra...) which is great for those who haven't built up much of a home gym.  However, there is quite a lot of jumping, so this workout is maybe not for everyone (bad joints beware).  You don't get any real breaks in this workout beyond a quick 5 seconds to catch your breath occasionally.  The first time I did this DVD I had to pause a few times to get water.  However, having done it a few more times, it's gotten easier to push through the whole thing.  She does a nice cool-down with some stretching at the end, where you really start to feel great after a very tough 45 minutes.

I know some people have mentioned that they found Jillian to be too abrasive.  Personally, I found her quite motivating - sure, she tells you to push yourself, but it's usually at those points where you're considering giving up.  I also really like how she counts down the last few of every move so you know how much longer you have to hang in there for.  She also provides beginner and advanced modifications for a good number of the moves, so you can really work at your own level of ability.  Each time I do the workout, I push myself a little bit harder than the last time - there's always room to improve.

My only issue with the DVD was the bonus section.  There's a segment where Jillian gives lifestyle tips - I decided to watch and see if she had any interesting tips that might help me out.  Well, it turned out to be a push to buy an Oral B Vitality toothbrush.  As a dental professional, I don't really like seeing oral health reduced to a black and white picture (they're basically saying that if you use a power toothbrush, you don't get cavities, which is not necessarily true...I could go on all day...).  Anyway, it just kind of rubbed me to the wrong way to get company sponsored dental advice after a good workout experience.

Advertisements aside, I felt this was a really fantastic workout.  I've noticed the flabby areas on my thighs and butt have gotten a lot tighter and all my clothes are fitting a little looser.  I can't wait to try more of her workouts.",1244073600,21,2850,4.393129770992366
3718206,5,B001NFNFN0,Am so pleased that Jillian has committed to book form her expertise and wisdom...I feel rich...,1243900800,,95,5.0
3718207,5,B001NFNFN0,"This is truly an INCREDIBLE workout!  I had already purchased Jillian's 30 Day Shred (which I LOVE!), but I wanted to get another DVD that was more concentrated on cardio.  And wow, this one sure is!
Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism consists of 7 6-minute circuits.  Each circuit has 4-5 different exercises in it, and you end up doing each exercise twice during the circuit.  I love this type of circuit training...I'm a terrible runner, and I get bored very quickly if I have to do the same exercise for more than a couple of minutes.  This DVD is PERFECT, because you're only doing each move for 30-45 seconds before you're on to something else.  And again (just like in the Shred), the moves are not complicated at all, and Jillian shows you different variations of most of them.  Another great thing is that each circuit is a different chapter...I started out doing just the first 3 circuits, and then added one each week.  So after 5 weeks I was doing the whole video!

As for my results...I first started out doing ONLY the 30 Day Shred (everyday for 30 days), and lost 4.6 pounds and 5.5 inches total.  Once I got Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism, I started doing it 3 times a week, while still doing the Shred twice a week (so I allowed myself 2 days of rest per week).  At the end of 5 more weeks, I've lost an additional 5.4 pounds and 2 inches.  I'm thrilled!  But even more than that, I can SEE and FEEL a huge difference!
I HIGHLY recommend this DVD!  :)  I think next I'm going to try No More Trouble Zones!",1243900800,4,1514,4.376344086021505
3718208,5,B001NFNFN0,"It took about 2 weeks for me to stop feeling sore from this workout- but then again, I only did it a couple of times a week. It's definitely intense, I can only do 3 of the 7 circuits (along with the warm up and cool down) before feeling completely exhausted. The great thing about this is the pacing- just when you think you're about to die, she takes it down a notch to strength or ab moves so you can catch your breath, and then kicks it right back up. That being said, every move is a cardio move if you do it correctly. It's a great way to jump start your fitness routine without feeling overwhelmed. The commentary gets a little annoying, but you can choose the ""workout with music only"" option and that solves the problem.

I haven't seen any dramatic results, but I am feeling better and gradually mastering the moves. I definitely recommend this, but only to younger people and adults who are in good shape. She does a lot of jumping and running moves, so if you have bad knees or ankles you should find something lower impact. And full figured ladies will definitely need a good sports bra!",1243814400,,1100,4.365853658536586

Jillian is motivating and her circuit workouts are genius.  I only did this video once, but I have no doubt in my mind that I will lose weight and get in shape in NO time.

I thought perhaps I would not be able to move the day after, but I was fine. I have not sweated this hard in a long time. I would have given this 5 stars but Jillian says on the video, ""this is not your mother's workout..."" HA! Little does she know, this grandma was doing it! I had to march in place in some spots but for the most part I managed. I am looking forward to doing it until I CAN DO the whole thing! Thanks Jillian, you are one tough mutha!",1243382400,5,588,3.908333333333333
3718211,5,B001NFNFN0,"I say this every time I do this workout. I hate her. Not personally, of course, but omg she kills me. Kills me. I've done this dvd three days straight after my first attempt when I could only do half. I've willed myself to do the whole thing now. I keep waiting for it to get easier. So far, I still hate Jillian, but I sweat more than my 5 mile runs, and am completely spent when finished.

One suggestion, for the love of God, Jillian, please STOP SAYING ""DON'T PHONE IT IN""...I am so tired of hearing that expression. It always makes me think about phoning in a pizza order...and I don't need pizza. Find a new catchphrase, please!

I get all of your dvds and if you counted how many times you say that, maybe you'd rethink it. :)

3718212,4,B001NFNFN0,"This dvd is EXCELLENT. If you have done Jillian dvds before, you know how tough she is. She doesn't disappoint with this one either. This is a 40 minute (longer with warm up and cool down) PAINFUL dvd, but in a good way! Choose your own circuits or do them all for the ultimate workout. This is all aerobic and does not require weights. All you need is a mat and some water b/c you will definitely need it. The constant moving and aerobics will have you trying to catch your breath and leave you feeling strong with a sense of great accomplishment if you can get all the way through! However,if you have bad knees, this probably isn't the best dvd to get since there is A LOT of jumping, twisting, and some plank moves. You get a brief break on the floor doing ab and leg work, but its still constant moving and pain. Its certainly a challenge but easy to follow since you repeat each circuit.

After a few weeks, I can do all 7 of the workouts, but am beat red and full of sweat by the end of the workout.  The results have been good and it makes you feel like you've really gotten a solid workout.

3718221,5,B001NFNFN0,"I purchased this DVD along with No More Trouble Zones after having done the 30 Day Shred for several months.  The Shred was a great introduction to working out, which is something I rarely did before.  By doing it 5 days a week, I lost the 15 pounds needed to get to my goal weight.  Banish Fat and No More Trouble Zones are intense, one hour workouts that definitely get you sweating like crazy.  I rotate between these two videos every other day, 5 days a week.  Many of the moves are repeated from the Shred, but since these videos are longer they work you out so much harder.  I am in good shape but still have to push myself to get through Banish Fat.  Circuit 2 is especially difficult, so once you get through that the rest is more manageable.  These DVDs have helped me get into the best shape of my life and I never imagined I would get so toned (in just over a month!).  Jillian is great, I highly recommend this workout!

At any rate, almost 4 years into my ""new life"" I'm trying everything to drop the last bit. My normal routine is 30-45 min of highest level elliptical on personal trainer mode 5+ times a week, plus incline walking, circuit training, cycling outside for fun, and weight training. Just recently took up pilates too. So I'm normally doing 1.5+ hrs a day of moderate to intense exercise, plus fun stuff.

I purchased this DVD thinking it would be a nice ""add on"" when it's rainy outside or I can't get to the gym. HAHAHAHAHAHAAHA!! The first time I did it (and keep in mind I've been VERY active and strong for 3 years) I could hardly catch my breath and stopped it at the 30 min mark. It is DIFFICULT, but in a good way. This is not hand-holding, this is butt-kicking. After 2 tries, I finally did the whole tape today. It looked like I walked through a pool I was so covered in sweat. But I feel great now. Those walking planks kill me, and the scissor squats/squat jumps... Aaaaggggghhh! Oh the pain. LOL Buy it, you'll learn to love it. It does get easier (not easy, let's say do-able) as you do it more. But I feel as if this will always be a butt-kicker, no matter how many times you do it. Loads of jumping, some pilates core work, some kick-boxing and no rest in between, just a lesser-evil movement so you don't pass out. ;) It's 56 minutes long including the warm up and cool down.

Most of the exercises have at one, two or  even three variations so you can make it harder for those good days, easier for the not so good days!  The ab circuit is one of the most aerobic, believe it or not!  Rather than have you lay down and do crunches, Jillian keeps that heart rate soaring.

I love that you still get a circuit training workout in a slower, more concentrated form.  The moves are pretty easy to follow and what i liked about this over the 30 day shred is that while 20 minutes of circuit training is still effective, you really feel like you have time to perform the moves correctly and in good form.  It lets you go at a slow enough pace and is not rushed at all.  I found myself pausing the dvd just to catch my breath!!!  I thought I was a pretty in-shape person too, but I guess I still have a lot of work to do.  Overall I give it 5 stars because it's a strong workout that combines both cardio and strength and is perfect for beginners/intermediates.

3718234,4,B001NFNFN0,"After completing Jillian's 30 Day Shred (the program outlined in her book), I thought I would be ready for anything she could dish out at me. 40 minutes of tough cardio? No problem.

I'm happy to report that this WAS, indeed, quite a challenge, even for myself, a seasoned workoutaholic. In fact, I can't imagine this NOT being a challenge. Every plyometric move can be done deeper, or higher, or more intensely. There's endless room for growth here; these 40 minutes are packed with moves that combine strength and cardio without rest. If you're bored of treadmills and bikes, these moves offer variety and challenge more than one group of muscles. Furthermore, I learned new moves that I can use at the gym, while traveling, and for outdoor workouts. These moves require no equipment.

Why, you must be asking, did I dock 1 star? It has nothing to do with Jillian's excellent cuing or the workout; it's the DVD. For one, I wonder what they're thinking when they have the option to do the workout with just the music. As if the music on these DVDs was ever even slightly good. A lot of the moves are done looking at the floor or ceiling rather than at the TV, so the cuing is helpful. I'd rather just hear Jillian's voice and play my own music, frankly. When is this going to be an option?

With that tiny pet peeve in mind, I'd reccomend this highly to anyone curious about the brutal world of interval training. Jillian really delivers results!",1240963200,20,1447,4.579150579150579

She also means it when she says she doesn't let up. This workout is intensive, and leaves you breathing hard and sweating buckets. (Attractive, right?)I fully believe, however, it is capable of helping you lose the 5 pounds a week it promises.

Like all the Biggest Loser/Jillian Michaels videos that I've done (the ones on OnDemand), it's very lower body heavy because the legs will burn the most amount of calories. If that's all you need because you don't do any other cardio, great, but I couldn't care less how many calories I burn since I already run 5 miles every morning... it's just more calories I have to worry about consuming so I don't pass out and die throughout the day.

Don't get me wrong, I think all the squat jumps she makes you do in this workout are PERFECT for increasing agility and running speed, but that's the problem--it's not something I would consider a total body workout, which is what I believe it's marketed as. I would have loved to see some push-ups along with the planks and perhaps a dumbbell circuit.

As for Jillian, sorry guys, but I'm just not a fan. Her self-deprecating ""humor"" gets old after she says the same thing like 10 times. I get it, you're not flexible...sucks for you.

NO body part goes unused. And she doesn't let you slow down once you get started.

sure, it's not the same as a jog on the treadmill or wherever, but if you're can't/don't wanna go to the gym, etc.. THIS IS THE KICK butt cardio for you that WILL blast calories, cuz it makes you need to turn the living room fan on, get out your water bottle and punch it out.
Remember ladies, exercise AND ""diet"" to see results! This doesn't come for free. lol.
That woman only gave this video two stars? Well, lady, go buy Jillian's other ""strength train dvd"" if this wasn't enough ""muscle building"" for you, this is a CARDIO/heart/blood circulation, blast toxins out of the body dvd, not muscle toning--although, you do get that from this too, in my opinion..

I am stronger and this video is helping me to improve my running.

She uses circuits with about 4-5 different exercises that she has you do twice. The more that you do it the better you will be and the harder you can push yourself to do it all the way or a little advanced (depending on the exercise). It is NOT easy but it is doable. And you will be see the weight come off because of the way that she had your heart rate go up and down.

you will sweat a lot but feel so good when you're done. i love her style.... she is really good at motivating me to keep going, and i love her short inspirational speech at the end. even the way she ends it-'we're gonna see you tomorrow'-is motivational to me. buy this and the no more trouble zones dvd, and alternate days with them. i don't think there's any way you'll not get a great workout with these two.",1238544000,3,915,4.169491525423729

Whoever said it was too slow to really do anything obviously wasn't doing it right. By slowing down the movements and going deeper into each squat in the plyometric sections, you burn way more fat and give your muscles a better workout than just jumping around really quickly. My muscles were burning much more than they usually would with a typical cardio workout AND my heart rate was up. Jillian delivers yet again! P.S.

I thought that I was going to have a heart attack =).... I did turn it back on after having a 5 minute break and completed the entire video, but it was EXTREME!!! This will get you in shape and I really don't think anyone really could complain about getting enough cardio from this DVD~***

This was much harder than the 30 day Shred because it integrates much more cardio.  I bought this along with 'No more Trouble Zones' and I really like the combination.  I did the 'No more Trouble Zones' DVD first, and it really was not that hard for me (it is much more strength focused rather than cardio), but the next day I was sore everywhere!!!! I exercise all the time, so this was a good change and challenge to my routine!!! 'No more trouble Zones' will hit all the muscle groups, (especially your arms and you will feel such a 'good sore feeling' the next day), and 'Boost Your Metabolism' will give you a crazy killer cardio workout.

I have to admit, I love to rotate these 2 videos everyother day, but I take one day just to rest, and one day to run on a treadmill to recover.  I would say that these videos are really good if you want a step up from the Shred.  There are new excercises that hit muscle groups that I never thought existed.  (I use 5lb weights)

The only thing that I noticed which hindered me from initially purchasing the new DVD where the 'titles' of the DVD's.  They did not seem very catchy...the '30 day Shred' title was a very catchy title..... I thought that they actaully were older videos from the 90's.... I hope her marketers read this, beacause I think one or 2 word titles are more catchy...these did not catch my attention, but none-the-less buy these-----> they are GREAT videos....like Jillian says ....""They won't dissapoint""!!!

I hope this review helps all of you looking for
a new and challenging workout~

3718273,4,B001NFNFN0,"Oct 2011 (2.5 years later):  I got back to using this DVD again regularly, after switching/mixing it up with some others this past year (Jillian, and Jackie Warner). I am in better shape now than when I originally wrote this - I do more weights and also weigh 10 lbs less, but you know what? This DVD is still an AWESOME cardio workout for me!  I still breathe hard, sweat a lot, need water, and (unfortunately) have to skip some exercises that are tough on the knees (ie jump squats).

One of the DVD's I've tried in the last couple years (to combine strength and cardio) is Jillian's ""Ripped in 30"" and for me (with the knee trouble), I have a tough time with her ""plyometrics"" and compound moves. So ""Banish Fat/Boost Metabolism"" remains the best cardio-only workout for me.

March 2009 (original review): I've never used an exercise DVD before, but I got hooked on this one in the free/on demand exercise section of Comcast and thought I better have my own. Some reviewers have said it's not as tough as other Jillian workouts, but I'm in pretty decent shape and have done a lot of cardio (eliptical mostly), and this workout had me sweating/breathing hard like I never have before during cardio. Gotta have water nearby!! For about the past 6 weeks I've only gone to the gym for weights, and this DVD is my new cardio workout 2 or 3x a week (it's all my knees can take!)
As for bad knees, some of the exercises are definitely brutal (especially squat/jump combos). Her thing is that you keep moving through the workout, so I just substitute in some of the ones I can do and try not to stress my knees too badly. A warm pack on my knees on Banish Fat workouts evenings helps too.",1237852800,7,1683,4.436893203883495

She moves things at a perfect pace I think and the 40-minute length is perfect as well - not too long, not too short.

I probably prefer this DVD, because I like longer workouts, and she does a lot of the moves from levels #2 and #3 of the shred in this workout. The moves are varied, Jillian does a great job of talking you up (making you not want to quit in the middle). She also offers lots of ways to make the workout more 'beginner friendly'. If you're looking for a great workout at any level of fitness I would definitely recommend this movie! If you buy this DVD along with the 30 day shred, then you have the option of a longer workout when you have the time, or a shorter workout when you don't.

If you're not familiar with Jillian she is a tough, almost mean trainer and I love her for it. Her style is such that you will not be misled into thinking you can lose weight without considerable effort, and this and 'No more trouble zones' require much effort.

The workout is  50 minutes: 5 min warm-up, 6 circuits totalling 40 mins and then a 5 min cooldown- no equipment needed. There's lots of jumping which might aggravate knee problems but otherwise excellent. There is more rest than during the 30 day shred dvd. It is definitely more than worth the price",1236643200,,679,4.424

I was concerned that it might be too advanced for me at this point as I've recently lost 50 lbs. have about 40 more to go and I've just recently started really working out other than treadmill which I'd been doing.  But I was surprised that I honestly could do most of this DVD.  There are some areas where I try to use good judgment and find another move that works for me if one is too advanced at this point (a fair amount of jumping at times if you have knee problems or anything).  But she's a good trainer and I highly recommend the DVD if you're serious about losing weight, getting in shape or staying in shape.  Another trainer / DVD series I applaud is Violet Zaki.

I feel like the segments were too slow to really make a difference. After I did this video, I went for a run just to finish my workout, however, after the 30 Day Shred Video, I am dead!

It's good for legs and butt, and also surprisingly good for abs. Plus, the cardio circuit format really gets the heart rate up there. It is indeed super hard, and I have to pause for ""water breaks"" (aka catching my breath and letting my legs recover!) but isn't that what we all want in a home workout video?

If you allow her to push you and you push yourself which you have to learn how to do anyway to get results.

I am probably now at an intermidiate level so I STILL have to stop often during the DVD. But it gets my heart rate up and keeps it there. This dvd is great because it shows you how to use your own body to lose weight. No gym, no equipment just you! And it really does work. After one week of alternating between this and the no more trouble zones I can already see and feel results. It is a great additon for your cardio routine. It is not boring at all and you still get some strength moves in. Its not about just jumping up and down, you are working all parts of your body all through the workout. GREAT DVD.

I did the 30 Day shred for 2 months and have switched to this DVD and No More trouble Zones. I thought this would be easy.. Now I thought No More Trouble Zones would be harder than this because you don't lift weights in this one-- WRONG! For me I found this work out so tough, a real challenge, a dripping sweat work out.

Some of the moves I found easy to do like the kickboxing because I was an avid Tae Boe addict for years. I checked my heart rate half way in and it was 187-- the rate it should be for athletic training. The circuit where jumping jacks were invloved, i had to grab some water because i was really getting weak.

I was able to complete the whole workout at a begginer level and Im not a begginer. Some moves I was unable to do were the scissor jumps-- I was afraid my knees would damage on that so i just did regular lunges, after 2 weeks of doing his dvd, iwas able to do the scissor jumps, u have to be careful with thise,,also the knee lifts she does I found hard to follow and just did regular knee lifts instead of lunging knee lifts.

I must admit towards the end of the tape I was feeling exhausted.

I am doing this dvd and switching to the No More target Zones on alternate days... Jillian is a great motivator as well.... This workout is tough and trust me this will get you in shape. She blows me away.

If your out of shape or just beigginning to work out I really don't reccomend this dvd as you can injure yourself, I would start with the 30 Day Shred and then work your way to this.. Be careful with the jumps on this one.

JIllian is the best home trainer I have ever used and I have used alot of exercise DVDS since I was 16.. I actually see results-my arms are toned and the cellulite on my thighs are gone and 50% less on my butt.

This DVD is tough (I would say I'm an intermediate exerciser, and I found myself stopping and panting a few times here). It works ALL muscles to the point of soreness while giving you a great, sweaty, cardio workout. No dancing, no fancy footwork: some kickboxing moves, combined with classic calisthenics, combined with core work, always mixing toning/strength with the cardio. I feel great after I do this workout (and I feel like I may die during it, so it all works out)!

3718305,5,B001NFNFN0,"UPDATE 2 Mar 2009:
I would say that Jillian and Tony Horton graduated from the same school because this cd seems to be like a soft-core P90x.
Seriously...
I received my P90x cd's today.  I'm watching the Cardio X cd right now and Jillian Michael's cd is actually pretty similar to this particular dvd (I haven't looked at others) in that there's a lots of Plyometric, Karate punches/kicks, single legs moves, swing kicks, a sorty of 'reverse' burpie, jumping jacks and hoping moves.
P90X is wayyy more demanding. More reps. Faster pace. I don't notice any circuit or repetition. Just one exercise after another.
But--the similarities are definitely there.
I am doing well with Jillian but I think I'll switch to P90X for now or I may attempt to do both--if the p90x gets a little too difficult.
Just thought I'd log-in and share my observations.
  ************************************
I'm very new to this Jillian Michaels but I already have 2 of her new dvds.  I like her...she reminds me of a basic training instructor (minus the cursing and screaming.)
LOL.

Now--this is GREAT workout.

...but Jillian loves her jumping jacks and jump-rope. LOL

I have bad knees and shin issues (from running).
I don't really want to not do this work out so I just modify the movement.

Jumpin Jacks?
I do the full exercise motion. Arms, legs and everything--I just don't 'jump' or bounce.
Instead I just shift from one leg to the other.

--Start off standing straight and tall. Arms to your side; palms down. Legs centered. Toes facing fwd.
--When you bring your arms up to meet each other over your head just kick your left leg (for instance) out to the side.
Your right leg is in place but bending at the knee to facilitate the movement.
(It's like you're pivoting on the left foot).

When your arms are at your side again...you just bring that left foot back to the center.

Then alternate legs...  You can STILL work up a sweat doing this low impact version.

Jump rope? For some reason I can do these (most of the time).
But it's the same thing.
I do the full motion...but I shift from one foot to the other. I bounce on the balls of my foot but my feet don't leave the ground.
 ********************************************
Not exactly sure if this would be good for beginners.
Heck--I'm just 'intermediate' and I still bought P90x (I'm a little scared LOL-- but we'll see how that works out!)
It's a question of fitness and you do have to listen to your body. I don't want anyone to hurt themselves--but I'd also say that much of it depends on your level of motivation to get through the circuits.

I hate to get all, 'Motivational Speaker' here (LOL) but:
You have females coming into the military unable to do even 5 sit-ups. After 2 weeks in basic they're cranking out 45 to 60+.  How do you think we did it?
We:
--Ran a mile or 2 (using HIIT) and did calisthenics (situps,pushups,mountain-climbers,jumping jacks,plyometric moves, etc..).  Every single day.
--Stayed active throughout the day. No sitting around twiddling your thumbs watching tv.
--Ate 3 square meals/day.
--Drank water like it was literally going out of style. We had to drink at least 2 glasses of water before every meal. And we carried water with us everywhere... If you're very active you must stay hydrated.
--There was no snacking. No chips. No candy. No soda. No juice. Only during certain times at the discretion of the instructors, if ever.  When you have proved yourself. 'Sweets' were a privilege.

I'm not saying that you should kill yourself working out or risk injury. It's one thing if you are too 'broken' to complete a workout.
I'm just saying that I don't think about any exercise in terms of it being 'too hard'. Because eventually you will get to that level, if you want to.
 I'm saying that the body can be whipped into shape in a fairly short amt of time and weight-loss and fitness goals can be achieved in short periods of time with hard work, resolve and dedication.",1235692800,9,3957,4.682539682539683

Fat Boost in total, is about 55min (warm-up & cool-down included) longer yes, but it's kind of a breeze to get through.  There is alot of jumping, which is why I would not recommend this workout for people with bad knees or leg problems.  I would recommend this for intermediates and advanced only!!!

I'm glad she didn't put circuits 2 & 6 side by side... those were the most challenging for me.  I keep 2 full glasses of water near by during her workouts.

I did the boost metabolism dvd for 6 days in the mornings & then I did the trouble zone 2 days during the week in the afternoons & the other afternoons I did an hour cardio at the gym with one day off for rest.  The second week using her video workout I lost an additional 2 pounds which is what I would expect with the healthy rule of losing no more than 2 pounds a week.  I had gained some weight during the holiday season so I'm just trying to lose the extra pounds by Summer & using her DVDs will definitely help me with that goal.

My favorite workout DVDs of hers was always the Shape-Up DVD sets but now I think I like this new set just as much.  I also noticed that my endurance has improved & I get through the other workout DVDs in my collection much better.

I must say I like all of the Jillian Michael DVDs that I have so far & I will keep buying hers for a good workout.

What I liked about this was that the workout flowed nicely. Even though I loved Shred (and lost 16 pounds in 35 days doing it) I got so tired of the up and down... jumping, then down for abs, up again jumping then down in the plank position. I would get dizzy from all the up and down! Not this workout - when you are down, you stay down and finish the circuit.

Also, while there still are a lot of jumping moves, they are nicely spread out. The intervals themselves feel shorter in this DVD than Shred, too (it might be because I am in much better shape when I first did the Shred, too!).

The moves are easy to follow and do, and I kept up with her the entire time; however, I was sweating bullets and huffing and puffing during those more intense circuits, and grateful for the circuits that were less intense! (I barely made it through the 6th circuit!)  I also like how she had a circuit in the middle entirely on the floor.  There are a great variety of exercises in this workout (some she uses in her 30 day shred and her How to Win By Losing series) to keep it fresh the entire time.  She is much more professional in this video than in past series (I was happy to see no giggling and repeating of sets simply because she said so), and suggests modifications for beginners.  The only thing I was disappointed about was her ""Tips for Healthy Living"" segment under the ""Bonus"" menu on the DVD.  It turned into an infomercial for Oral B power toothbrushes. . . ugh.

BFBM is the 1st Jillian workout that I did many moons ago and it kicked my A$$.  I was very overweight and out of shape so I had to keep stopping.  It was very Challenging for me as a beginner but still doable with focused effort....my fist was in the air and I was cursing her out BUT she is legit and knows her stuff.  There are 7 circuits and it is ALL Cardio...no weights.  Circuit #4 is the only one that is a floor workout but I try to avoid doing this bc my heart rate falls too much and I want to stay at an active/ intense pace.  Now if you are a Beginner then Circuit #4 offers you a chance to catch your breath.  This is a solid workout that will help you slim and strengthen your body.  Do not be intimidated if you are overweight/ out of shape.  The workout is on a dvd so you can re-wind/pause and go at your own pace.  Another benefit is that you can select to do certain Circuits if you are crunched on time or just don't feel up to doing the entire workout.  Still one of my favorite Jillian workouts because it gives you a TOTAL body workout and its FUN!

Even if there's no WiFi (if you download it on Prime Video app) You don't have to go to the gym! It seriously has been a dream for me. My former way of working out was running  but it started to hurt my knees and running doesn't get you overall toned like this does. I'll give you a disclaimer that it's very hard at first if you're out of shape, but with a little time your muscles WILL respond and you WILL get toned! Just stick with it!",1524096000,3,943,3.963157894736842
8326765,4,B001NFNFN0,"First of all, let me start by saying that I LOATHE this workout LOL!  But...it still gets 4 stars, because it is so challenging for me that when I complete it, I feel extremely accomplished.  Another reason it gets docked a star is because of the 4th circuit.  The first 3 circuits are pretty intense, but when she goes from the mountain climbers to the supermans, I honestly feel as if I could fall asleep on the floor.  I feel as if it slows me down a little TOO much for the last 2 circuits...and holy Hannah, I need everything I've got for that 6th circuit.  Another thing to note, I was doing this workout mixed in with a couple of other Jillian videos, including Killer Buns.  I found that I over-trained my legs doing both at the same time.  Another positive of this workout is that it really helped improve my endurance.  By the 5th or 6th time I did it, I realized that I wasn't near tears by the 3rd circuit.  Someday, I will get the nerve to do this in conjunction with No More Trouble Zones every day for a few weeks.  Not there quite yet!",1520467200,,1051,4.236180904522613

If I haven't been doing full body workouts on a regular basis Im usually left sore after this dvd for a few days if not a week. It is effective!",1517184000,,260,3.9245283018867925
