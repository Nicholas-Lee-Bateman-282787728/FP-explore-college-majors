8755120,4,B01D7A9I7A,"This review is on the movie not the DVD, playback or transfer quality.

Very interesting conceptual artwork. That's what I'll remember most about the movie. That and those who created the aerial warfare scenes actually had an idea of aeronautics. While we know it's movie, it's made in a believable fashion.

I do understand those who found it confusing. Even following along with what was presented at the beginning out was difficult to understand who was who based on their appearances.
Lastly, I am not normally one remembers much less comments on the incidental music, but this was very well done.
If towards the end of the movie you begin thinking of Godzilla, you weren't alone.",1474588800,,684,4.887931034482759
