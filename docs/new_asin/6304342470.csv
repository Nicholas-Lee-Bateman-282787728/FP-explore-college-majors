849419,5,6304342470,"This is an good film. It features an all star cast and the storyline and script are tight and professionally played. The story is about an Army Colonel played by Denzel Washington that is fighting his conscience over a friendly fire incident in Iraq.

He is asked to investigate the case of trying to award the Medal of Honor to a woman that had died in combat. She was played by Meg Ryan. The investigation is intense and story has twists and turns.

I liked the film and we just watched it for the third time since it was release. I rate the film at 5 stars.",1503705600,,560,4.224299065420561

849422,3,6304342470,"This film is a fine showcase for a courageous officer (Denzel Washington) to live by his values: he, even though under query by his senior officer
refuses to just pass on a recommendation for a medal of courage for another officer ( Meg Ryan) who  was fatally injured by enemy attack (Gulf War) after her rescue helicopter was shot down.

SPOILER:  The clues Denzel uncovers are from her crew who survived: one went AWOL, another was secretive, very angry, and soon committed
suicide in an eye popping run in with a train, actually witnessed by Washington. and another whose memory was unclear due to the trauma.  The only discrepancy I could discern was that Lou Diamond Phillips (the angry suicide) said he was the one who thought of overboarding the drum of
napalm over the enemy camp and firing it with a pistol,destroying the tank and many lives, while Matt Damon (the seeming poor memory) reported
that Meg Ryan was the one who knew to do it,even while under great duress when her pilot was shot in the head, and she had to take over under fire.

The premise of the story was good, the acting excellent by everyone, the direction very good as to keep interest, and keep us awake, he flash backed the story those who were being interviewed by Washington told, so it stayed very fresh.

So, does it really matter whose idea it was to ""bomb"" the enemies on the ridge?  A crew consists of real people with various experiences; the captain's job is to use good ideas and keep everyone focussed and alive, right?  In the end, she did a lot to keep them alive, and refused to leave,
I'm guessing, because she was painfully and fatally wounded, and knew she would slow anyone down who had to carry her.

I just missed the point.  Hopefully, one of you who understands this better than I will put me out of this misery.

Note:  Removed one star just because it wasn't clear, and I wanted to be heard for my own experience.",1500422400,,1919,4.514450867052023

849532,5,6304342470,"Courage Under Fire stars Denzel Washington as Lieutenant Colonel Nathaniel Serling, Regina Taylor as Meredith Serling,Meg Ryan as Captain Karen Emma Walden, Lou Diamond Phillips as Staff Sergeant John Monfriez, Matt Damon as Specialist Andrew Ilario, Scott Glenn as Washington Post Reporter Tony Garten (as well as more actors/actresses featured in the film). I admit that it was an easy decision for me to check out the Courage under fire film because of the Magnificent Film that I saw last year that featured Denzel Washington (I went by the recommendation of a female coworker who admires Washington as an actor), and other actors/actresses in the Magnificent film. Nathaniel Serling has a challenging job of making sure to uncover the truth around what happened to Captain Walden while also balancing his family life with his wife Regina Serling who is naturally concerned about him. Andrew Ilario is one of the first men that Serling questions due to the fact that he was there and up close to Walden when certain events happened. Serling has an uncomfortable encounter with Monfriez that has him wondering why he is so defensive about what happened to Walden. Serling is also trying to sort out his own personal feelings around a recent event that happened when he gave out an order to Sergeant Patella (Sean Astin) that went much differently than planned. Nathaniel has to deal with all of this while also making sure to professionally and maturely handle himself around Washington Post Reporter Tony Gartner.",1489968000,,1517,5.072

849535,3,6304342470,This is a pretty good movie.  Denzel Washington plays an officer who investigates the circumstances that lead to whether or not a fellow soldier played by Meg Ryan should get the Medal Of Honor.  She would be the first ever female to win it.  The story is set during The Gulf War and is realistic enough to make you think it could be true.

849855,5,6304342470,"Courage Under Fire is the story of several people who are not dealing with their feelings of guilt.  Denzel Washington lives with the fact that he fired upon the tank of his best friend killing all those in the tank.  A medivac helicopter is shot down and the Captain (Meg Ryan) does all that she can to keep her crew alive and alert. As they come under fire the crew want to make a run for it but the Captain lets them know that she is still in charge and no one is going anywhere.

It is Denzel Washington who is given the task of investagating the Captain to see if she should be awarded the Medal of Honor.  As he questions the crew it becomes clear that they are being evasive and he searches for the truth.

Edward Zwick is really good directing this kind of movie.  Meg and Denzel are the perfect pair for this story.  The rest of the helicopter crew including Matt Damon, play their parts with incredible realism.",1414454400,,921,4.289017341040463

**Spoilers**

The moment when we realize Washington's character knows something is not right, that there was indeed an M-16 firing throughout the rescue, and that in fact, someone was alive and engaging the enemy while the rest of the rescue was leaving, is so startling, and maddening.. War truly is hell..",1412985600,,560,5.5

This all star cast of Meg Ryan, Matt Damon, and Denzel Washington really deliver an awesome performance in this film that is both action and drama in the same film.

There's really not much I can put here that hasn't already been said by other reviewers.  But I will conclude by saying that this film is awesome and you won't be sorry you watched it!",1412467200,,492,4.09375

This movie captures the essence of the age old battle of man v. the elements,man battling his fellow man,and of course,man against himself....the internal battles fought on no battle fields,but instead,those that rage within every one of us. Ultimately,it is a classic study of us all and the struggle between the ""Better and lesser angels of our nature"". The morals and the values examined here are timeless..And just as notable as well: how the line between courage and cowardice,can sometimes become quite narrow. The movie takes a realistic look at many of the things which we so often do not want to see. In spite of this,it is well worth a look.",1410307200,,758,4.9763779527559056

Densel has to overcome some struggles he's dealing with while the story of Meg Ryan's character is uncovered bit by bit through the interviews he conducts with other soldiers involved in the incident.

A military woman has always been required to 'prove' herself worthy in her chosen area of profession.  Throughout my career, I noted that it was the administrative field where the majority of women were fortunate enough to receive the promotions and breeze through their time in service without the severity of abuse and warfare from their fellow male comrades.  The actors in this movie portray real life experiences for real veterans.  Meg Ryan is superb as a professional officer who is highly qualified as a leader and helicopter pilot.

She of course acting like a man with no emotions, instead of those emotions women typically have in stressful situations, the same reason, women don't belong in combat or combat support. This movie was solely made for support of women in combat, just like ""GI Jane."" was. Both box office flops. Save your money, unless you enjoy a good fantasy.

850147,2,6304342470,"I know that this isn't the most popular of opinions, but I found this film far too clich&eacute;d and predictable to be anything remotely memorable.  I know I'm coming into this a few years late, but my adoration for Meg Ryan and my sidelined respect for Denzel Washington made my anticipation for this film high.  Sadly, it just didn't really work for me in any way, except for that surprisingly brilliant turn by Matt Damon.  The plot is a little too contrived to be anything memorable.  The idea is nice, but it is poorly realized, with far too many predictable twists that take away from the films apparent poignancy (or need to be so).

The film centers on a haunted solider (are there any other kinds?), Serling, who is currently overseeing a Medal of Honor candidate who died in the line of duty.  Battling his own memories of causing the death of a fellow solider and friend, Serling finds some inconsistencies in interviewing those related to the loss of Captain Walden.  When he finds out that Walden was a woman it makes it all the more pertinent to `do this right', a way that Serling can make personal amends for his own errors.

But what he finds out is more than he bargained for.

Honestly, this film thinks that it is deeper and more shocking than it really is.  You can smell the dishonesty in certain aspects of the plot that foretell events too clearly for the audience, and the ending revelations are just not that impending (unless you count the brilliant facial expression carried by Matt Damon when the revelation is revealed).

Outside of Damon though, this film is burdened by unfulfilled performances that take this film down a bad road.  That may be the biggest drawback, because some stellar performances could have elevated the material and sold the film for something more than it was.  Instead, the lack of drive in these performances only highlighted the films `other' flaws.  Much has been said about Meg Ryan's performance in the `praise' category, but I must say that I thought she was nearly awful, and I LOVE her.  She has handled drama before and delivered rather wonderfully (her Oscar snub for `When a Man Loves a Woman' still pisses me off) but this was just a mess.  Her accent was terrible and her character arc was unbelievable.  She tried so hard to play tough and it just didn't work.  Lou Diamond Philips was so stereotypical it was pathetic and Denzel Washington still doesn't really know how to balance out his emotions.  So much is made of him as an actor, but his ability to really nail a performance is sketchy.  Yes, I love him in certain films (Malcolm X, He Got Game) but unless he has a character with some edge or bite he tends to play his characters on the dull side.  He makes Serling a total bore.

Maybe that's how I feel about the film as a whole; a total bore.",1296604800,,2824,4.572564612326044

7/08: After working together on Glory, Edward Zwick reteams with Denzel Washington seven years later for another military picture. This time, it's called Courage Under Fire.

Once again, the film is a pretty good one. Although I think that Denzel Washington did a nice job, I would say that his performance helped him to get ready for Antwone Fisher. There are a lot of similarities between the two.

Excellent performances are turned in by Matt Damon and Lou Phillips. The former has, which is noticeable by the thinness of his face, clearly lost a good deal of weight for his role, and what the hell happened to the latter?

I question the casting of Meg Ryan; there is a lack of credibility whenever I see her sporting a military uniform. And I've always hated her for a long time because she can't act.

What I like about Courage Under Fire is the story. It's gripping and arresting. The editing, including some action scenes in Iraq, is done very well.

There is a surprising twist which occurs near the end of the movie that would start to make the story more sensible. However, I felt a little bit lost when one character committed suicide, leaving an unresolvable small plot hole.

850213,5,6304342470,"Courage Under Fire is a riveting look at the aftermath of combat on a group of soldiers with a dark secret. Much more than simply a military drama, it becomes a more personal tale as more light is shed on what really happened. Director Edward Zwick made something special here, as what could easily have been a routine story, takes on depth and a sense of honor and history as the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the first female officer killed in combat turns into a marshy quicksand of lies and deception regarding the events leading to her death.

Lieutenant Colonel Nathaniel Serling (Denzel Washington) is assigned the task of signing off on the details so Captain Karen Walden (Meg Ryan) can be given the Medal of Honor for her sacrifice. But as Serling begins to talk to the crew of soldiers who went down with Walden in the Medivac helicopter over Kuwait, he becomes unsure whether or not she deserves it. It is not any kind of preconceptions about women in combat that prompts Serling's misgivings, but his seasoned senses as a soldier which tell him he is not being told the truth.

Michael Moriarty gives a fine performance as Serling's superior and old friend, Brigadier General Hershberg. The President very much wants to give Walden her medal posthumously and pressure is exerted on Serling to speed up his investigation. Ilario (Matt Damon) was the closest to Walden and appears frightened of Serling's probing. Lou Diamond Phillips gives perhaps his best performance as the tough Sgt. Monfriez, a military lifer with a huge chip on his shoulder. He believes Serling is there to whitewash what happened, so refuses to tell him anything.

Denzel Washington gives another great performance as the flawed Lieutenant Colonel Serling, whose attempt to get at the truth may cost him what is left of his tarnished career. Scott Glenn has a nice turn in support as a reporter who can smell a big story in this quietly powerful drama. This film is about honor and integrity, and human weakness. The flashback scenes are riveting as each soldier tells his version of events. When Serling finally uncovers a truth quite different from the offical version, it still remains a story of courage under fire.

Though Denzel gets most of the screen time, Meg Ryan not only holds her own but equals him. Her moments onscreen paint a portrait of a very real person who served her country bravely and with honor. This film slowly draws you in until you are glued to the screen, waiting for the truth to come out. It is a testament to honor and sacrifice by soldiers serving their country bravely under difficult circumstances. This is a region two UK version.

Denzel has just returned from Desert Storm where he has tragically killed some Americans in error by friendly fire.  He is also suffering from a drinking problem.  The powers that be want him to rubber stamp the medal for Meg Ryan but Denzel is intent in examining everything down to the last bit.  This is where the story gets very interesting.  As he examines the other soldiers who were in the helicopter with Meg Ryan, each has a different story of what happened.  Denzel realizes that something is amiss.  Either memories are way lapsed or there are secrets and lies withheld.

How Denzel gets to the bottom of things and figures out the truth of what happened on that fateful day that took Meg Ryan's life is the gist of this story.  I also liked the fact that this is a role out of character for Meg Ryan and she did very well with it.",1243641600,2,1124,4.46078431372549

But the main story was that one of her subordinates rather than the enemy shot her in a firefight in Iraq , in a mini-mutiny. There was no cover up by the Army, although Lt. Col. Serling (Denzel Washington) made it seem so to his commanding general who wanted the case wrapped up quickly only because of high level pressure to make the first Medal of Honor award to a female soldier. It made no sense to me. Sure, if the Army had tried to prevent the right outcome, there would have been a plot but the only thing Col. Serling was chasing and uncovered was cowardly performance by one of the troopers in Captain Walden's crew. The only cover up was by two of the troopers, the one who shot Walden and the medic (Matt Damon).

The parallel plot of the Lt. Colonel Sterling's own friendly fire accident as a tank commander seemed almost extraneous and connected only faintly in my mind to the main theme.

The movie could have been more provocative but far less politically correct if Captain Walden had been found ultimately unworthy of the Medal and that the Army had been trying to make the award to please a P.C. administration.  It's as if something of this nature was in the writer's mind but he knew it wouldn't fly so he twisted the plot around to make it more acceptable and unhappily, nonsensical.",1235692800,,1476,4.5

Washington in a very difficult (he should have been nominated at least!!) is outstanding as a stoic officer who makes a bitter mistake under fire and accidentally kills one of his men.  Ryan is just as fine as the late officer who is under investigation for her part in a fire fight with the enemy.  I disagree with a lot of the reviewers who felt she was miscast since before this film she did a number of comedies and was severely type cast.

Powerful, compelling, weighty in tone and subject matter, this film deals with real-life, complex issues and does so with wonderful direction, a great script, and outstanding performances.

Washington plays a high ranking officer during Operation Desert Storm who loses his command in a friendly fire incident, and find himself reassigned to the branch that investigates medal nominations. He is given the particularly controversial assignment of recommmending or not recommending a female officer killed in action for the Medal of Honor. As she would be the first woman to receive this honor, Washington's every move is scrutinized, and his investigation provides a lack of easy answers or direction.

Meg Ryan plays the medal candidate in flashblacks, and Matt Damon and Lou Diamond Phillips play soldier under Ryan's command during the incident for which she has been nominated for the Medal of Honor. All of these performances are excellent, and issues such as what constitutes heroism and bravery in wartime, the difference between duty and sacrifice, and how does one accept making an unacceptable mistake are all explored without offering pat, resolved in two hours answers.

850279,5,6304342470,"This was one of my favorite movies from the 1990's.

A great many things have happened since then to make anyone want to forget this movie, but one day I saw the DVD on Amazon listed for this ridiculously low price, so I got it.

Ah, how things have changed! In 1996 when this movie was made, Meg Ryan was at the peak of her career - she'd been named Woman of the Year by the Harvard Hasty Pudding Society in 1994, and could have just as well been named ""America's Sweetheart"".  She had built up such a reservoir of goodwill for the sweet and lovable characters that she played. Then, in 2001, she turned 40, and had an affair with Russell Crowe while making ""Proof of Life"" (another movie that I loved at the time, but have since forgotten).  She then fell into a full-blown mid-life crisis and basically went nuts, wrecking her face, her public image, and her career. At age 45, she's too old now for the innocent sweetheart roles that made her career, and she hasn't been able to move on to the few wife/mother/divorcee/career woman roles that Hollywood offers to middle-aged actresses. And so she has almost disappeared from the big screen.

At the time, playing the hard-nosed Captain Emma Walden in this movie, Meg Ryan was making a major departure from her usual roles, which only made the story of her character even more poignant.  Yes, Captain Walden screamed and cussed at her men and behaved like a ""dyke"" (that's a quote from a character in the movie, not my opinion, by the way), but we, the moviegoers, all knew that was still good old sweet Meg Ryan underneath that crusty exterior.

Denzel Washington played the deeply conflicted Col. Serling, and this movie would be one of several in the 1990's that would establish him as an A-list superstar.

Lou Diamond Phillips played the angry, callous, and tortured Sgt. Monfriez.  Wow! Was it in 1987 that he made ""La Bamba""? He was great in that movie and in this movie!  And unfortunately those are the only two movies that he's made that I even recognize, as his career fell off into mostly B-movies and TV guest roles.

Matt Damion!  I didn't even recognize him in this movie, playing the medic Ilario - he was so young and thin back then.  This was one of his first big roles, before he became a star with ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"".

Ah, and of course, there was the background setting of what was known at the time as the Persian Gulf War, but now is usually referred to as the First Iraq War or Iraq War I, to distinguish it from the current quagmire, Iraq War Part Deux.

So no wonder the price of this DVD has dropped like a rock!  Subject matter - Iraq War I - who wants to remember that one anymore?  Key star of the movie - Meg Ryan - wrecked her image and alienated her fanbase.  Time for a clearance sale!

But, this is still a great movie, and it will bring a tear to your eyes.

The story of ""Courage Under Fire"" is a fiction, but many elements came straight out of the news stories at the time about the real Iraq War I.

I have always thought, for instance, that the idea for the character of Captain Emma Walden was based on the real-life Major Marie Rossi, a Chinook helicopter pilot who was killed in the war.  Right before the invasion began, the extremely photogenic Rossi had appeared on national TV in an interview with CNN, talking about flying into combat and facing the possibility of dying in the war. A few days after the interview was broadcast, she and her crew were killed when her helicopter hit the support wires of an unlit microwave tower and crashed.  I remember seeing her in the interview and then hearing of her death, and it was quite sad.

Friendly fire was a major element of the news stories from Iraq War I, with the photos of  grieving soldiers who had discovered that their friends had died from friendly fire.

""Courage Under Fire"" unfolds its tangled storyline in classic ""Rashomon"" fashion.  An ex-tank commander, anguished by his role in an episode of friendly fire that is being covered up by the Army brass, is re-assigned to a desk job to investigate pending medals, one of them being a Medal of Honor to be awarded to the first female soldier to be given such a medal for heroism in combat. His investigation turns up several versions of what happened before he discovers the truth, which turns out to be yet another variety of ""friendly fire"". And thus fortified, he is also able to address the truth of his own involvement in the friendly fire incident as well.

The final scene of the movie is poignant, mysterious, and lingers in the mind. I still think about it today.  It is a replay of an earlier scene in the movie, with one new bit of detail.

It is the morning after the tank battle, and Col. Serling is standing next to the burnt-out tank of his friend, who lies dead on top of the turret.  An Army Medevac helicopter that had landed to pick up the wounded takes off in front of him, and Col. Serling looks up, and we see, for the first time, that the pilot of this helicopter is none other than Capt. Walden. She seems to be smiling at him. Is this really how that moment in time transpired?  Was she on her way to the battle that would play out in the rest of this movie and go on to earn her the Medal of Honor? Or is this just a trick of Col. Serling's memory, and he is seeing Capt. Walden in his dreams, placing her at this awful moment in time, and she is smiling at him in approval because he has finally gained absolution for both of them by uncovering the truth?",1172361600,5,5519,4.3962635201573255

The measure of the war we are told in subtle terms is not the casualties inflicted or the territory taken; it is in the impact on those who waon the war, and are now dealing with its aftermath.

The stroy examines the impact of the actions takien during an incident during the 1991 Gulf War near the village of Al Bathra. While investigating a possible Medal of Honor for the first woman in combat, Colonel Nat Serling uncovers a very disturbing scenario that has the surviviors of the incident battling substance abuse and in one case, lying in a hospital with stomach cancer begging to die.

Excellent performances from all the principals.

850354,5,6304342470,"Courage Under Fire is a riveting look at the aftermath of combat on a group of soldiers with a dark secret. Much more than simply a military drama, it becomes a more personal tale as more light is shed on what really happened. Director Edward Zwick made something special here, as what could easily have been a routine story, takes on depth and a sense of honor and history as the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the first female officer killed in combat turns into a marshy quicksand of lies and deception regarding the events leading to her death.

Lieutenant Colonel Nathaniel Serling (Denzel Washington) is assigned the task of signing off on the details so Captain Karen Walden (Meg Ryan) can be given the Medal of Honor for her sacrifice. But as Serling begins to talk to the crew of soldiers who went down with Walden in the Medivac helicopter over Kuwait, he becomes unsure whether or not she deserves it. It is not any kind of preconceptions about women in combat that prompts Serling's misgivings, but his seasoned senses as a soldier which tell him he is not being told the truth.

Michael Moriarty gives a fine performance as Serling's superior and old friend, Brigadier General Hershberg. The President very much wants to give Walden her medal posthumously and pressure is exerted on Serling to speed up his investigation. Ilario (Matt Damon) was the closest to Walden and appears frightened of Serling's probing. Lou Diamond Phillips gives perhaps his best performance as the tough Sgt. Monfriez, a military lifer with a huge chip on his shoulder. He believes Serling is there to whitewash what happened, so refuses to tell him anything.

Denzel Washington gives another great performance as the flawed Lieutenant Colonel Serling, whose attempt to get at the truth may cost him what is left of his tarnished career. Scott Glenn has a nice turn in support as a reporter who can smell a big story in this quietly powerful drama. This film is about honor and integrity, and human weakness. The flashback scenes are riveting as each soldier tells his version of events. When Serling finally uncovers a truth quite different from the offical version, it still remains a story of courage under fire.

Though Denzel gets most of the screen time, Meg Ryan not only holds her own but equals him. Her moments onscreen paint a portrait of a very real person who served her country bravely and with honor. This film slowly draws you in until you are glued to the screen, waiting for the truth to come out. It is a testament to honor and sacrifice by soldiers serving their country bravely under difficult circumstances. A great film to own.",1117497600,6,2659,4.811816192560175
850355,5,6304342470,"Definitely a great movie, Courage Under Fire, brings to the screen two stories as they unfold at the same time; a military investigation into whether a female officer should receive the Medal of Honor posthumously, and the inner struggle of the investigator as he tries to come to terms with his having been responsible for his friend's death in Iraq during Desert Storm.

The film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind.

Needless to say, Denzel Washington, Meg Ryan, Lou Diamond Phillips, Matt Damon, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

The setting, the special effects, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!

850356,4,6304342470,"A moving but fictional story of two US soldiers who both fought during Iraq War I. We find Denzel's character, Lt Col Serling, as a tank officer in a desk job after the war, having been deeply affected by a friendly fire incident that occurred on his watch. As a favor to keep this good soldier who's since become a sot, his commander assigns him the task of investigating whether a KIA deserves a post-humous Medal of Honor. LTC Serling is rather stunned to open the file and see it is a female helicopter pilot, Meg Ryan's character: Captain Walden. As Serling goes about interviewing witnesses, he discovers that the pieces of their stories conflict. The manner in which the stories conflict is played out in a series of flashbacks with varied interpretations. Serling becomes determined to find the truth and through finding the truth, being somehow able to atone for his own mistakes. The truth surrounding CPT Walden's fate becomes imperative to Serling's own fate and in dealing with his past demons. This is a well-acted movie, and you will want to know the truth too as the plot builds and the flashbacks show each conflicting version of an unfortunate, complicated situation.

Meg Ryan is miscast despite the film's efforts to change her appearance by dying and cutting her hair to have her appear as more of a ""toughie"" than a ""cutie"". She also speaks with a Southern accent which she can't get quite gritty enough with such a naturally high, sweet voice. And it's hard to get around those big, light blue, sensitive eyes of hers. There are several military-incorrect instances -- those of you are are also one of ""them"" with prior service know what I'm talking about. Most glaring is that while CPT Walden IS post-humously deserving of a medal, it is a stretch that it should be the Medal of Honor -- I won't go further into this here because the movie's is a good one and worth seeing for other reasons.

Scott Glen, Lou Diamond Philips, and a then unknown Matt Damon are part of the supporting cast. Check out an anorexic (in the ""future"" part of the movie) Matt in one of his first roles -- he forced himself to lose so much weight in order to fit the part that he has since said in interviews that he made himself very, very sick. And I'd have to say that a plumper Matt IS a better looking Matt. Also, you can catch a pre-Sam the Hobbit AKA Sean Astin in a small role.",1093824000,7,2385,4.544186046511628
850357,4,6304342470,"The basic plot line of ""Courage Under Fire"" is that Lt. Col Nathaniel Serling (Denzel Washington) is investigating an incident during the Gulf War to determine whether or not the Medal of Honor should be awarded posthumously to Captain Karen Walden (Meg Ryan). It does not take us long to find out that the title of this film refers to both Serling and Walden. The initial story on Walden, the pilot of a rescue helicopter, is that she made a spectacular rescue of a downed helicopter crew, then fought off attacking Iraquis after her own copter crashed, dying right before the besieged group was rescued. But as Serling questions the surviving members of Walden's crew, he discovers their various versions do not jive, and he begins to question what is the truth of what really happened.  The more questions he asks, the more questions he has although one of the soldiers he interviews warns him to ""leave the bullet in the chamber.""

Moreover, Serling is haunted by his own actions during the Gulf War, where he was responsible for a ""friendly fire"" incident that resulted in the death of American soldiers. To complicate matters even more, Serling is drinking way too much, has grown distant from his family, and is being hounded by both a commanding officer (Michael Moriarity) who wants the P.R. value of Walden being the first woman to receive the Medal of Honor and a reporter (Scott Glenn) who knows something of what really happened to the Serling in Iraq and wants to know the rest.

""Courage Under Fire"" makes excellent use of the ""Rashomon"" technique, wherein we get to see each person's version of what really happened in Iraq, with basically the same elements playing out in each version of the story.  Serling's own feelings of guilt and responsibility for what happened in Iraq provide an additional level of depth to the narrative (more so than in Kurosawa's original classic film in fact). Some may find the parallel attempts to find redemption to be somewhat heavy handed, but ultimately the film succeeds because of the solid acting performances and the fact that the script works out the details so putting the pieces together one at a time makes sense.

In addition to Washington and Ryan, who never have a scene together, there are solid performances from Lou Diamond Phillips and a very underweight Matt Damon as surviving members of Walden's crew, Michael Moriarity as the General, Scott Glenn as the reporter, and Regina Taylor as Serling's worried but supportive wife. Certainly this film is closer to the reality of Desert Storm than ""Three Kings,"" but the most impressive part of the film is how Ryan and her crew do the exact same lines with totally different meanings because of radical changes in context while Washington tries to find meaning in his own life.",1093824000,,2792,4.844863731656185
850358,4,6304342470,"War movies rarely acknowledge fatal blunders alongside the typical nimble strategies all in the same vein, much less in the same individual. Courage Under Fire manages that with an effortless tapestry of morality, valour and honour.

Apart from such sheer emotional freight, it even manages to counch a discreet message about the quirks of real wars and their very human aftermath. There are points in the film where both the Iraqi and the American soldiers look almost indistinguishable. Fighting nations with crunch budgets is a complex enterprise with a variety of perspectives.

There is much to say about the plot's setup, it's spectacular. Denzel is heads and shoulders above everyone else but the performances are excellent all-round. Matt Damon seemed to have lost half his weight to fit into the role. Meg Ryan is very convincing for her irregular turn as a leathery war woman. But above all, I was particularly astonished by the confident pizzazz of Lou Diamond Phillips, his explosive cameo is one of the most unforgettable sequences.

With its highly realistic battle scenes, fast-paced screenplay and a solid heart , Courage Under Fire is a top class production, regardless of the qualms regarding nationalistic or gender messages that other critics bloviate about. My theory that you cannot go terribly wrong with anything that involves Denzel still remains intact.",1091836800,12,1379,5.230769230769231

Meg Ryan appears in the movie only in several of the numerous flashbacks.  The movie revolves around two storylines:  the facts behind the death of Meg Ryan's character, CPT Walden, and the life of LTC Sterling who has the unfortunate assignment to uncover what really happened when CPT Walden was killed.

Let me hasten to add, I enjoyed Courage Under Fire, but I had two gripes:

(1) In the scene where the Meg Ryan character dies while charging the Iraquis and firing an M16, we can see down the muzzle of the rifle, and the ""muzzle"" is a mere pinprick. Obviously, this is a blank gun. A small thing, but jarring to those who know guns, at a key moment in the film.

(2) The entire premise of the movie is bogus. An Army helicopter pilot played by Meg Ryan has been killed in combat, and has been nominated for a posthumous Medal of Honor. Denzel Washington's character is tapped to investigate the circumstances surrounding her death. This is a political hot potato because, if he recommends her award, she will become (drum roll) THE FIRST WOMAN EVER AWARDED THE MEDAL OF HONOR.

False. Historically, factually false. Dr. Mary Edwards Walker of the Civil War Union Army was awarded the Medal of Honor on November 11, 1865. This is, um, kind of an important point. Either the folks making this movie didn't know that, in which case they're sloppy, or they chose to ignore it, in which case they're willfully dishonest.

Did I mention I enjoyed this movie?",1068681600,5,1361,4.497975708502024
850361,5,6304342470,"First off, the time for this review is a little off. (09/2003) Right now the ""anti-war"" crowd seems to hold sway ... at least in the media. But take it from a former soldier, this is a great and very realistic story about what happens under fire.
(War ... IS ugly. But perhaps September 11th, 2001 taught us there are some battles you should not run away from.)
You should also read a few of the other reviews about this movie, they are very well-done.
This story is about Denzel Washington's character (Sterling) who is assigned to investigate a dead helicopter's actions after their aircraft went down in the first Gulf War. (1990) The deceased helicopter pilot is Meg Ryan's character (Walden); she gets precious little screen-time in this movie ... it is perhaps the only criticism I can think of that is valid.
I don't need to tell you the rest of the details, story and technique of this film, other reviews do this as well as anyone possibly could. What I do have to offer is a word about the acting of this movie.
Normally Denzel Washington plays action characters, and Meg Ryan almost always seem to do a comedy/drama about a woman in love. Here both actors are engaged in a radical departure from their normal fare.
I don't know how many Oscar's this film was nominated for, (and I don't really care, Oscar's seem to be as much about politics as anything else); but Washington, Ryan, and Damon all give performances that are quite worthy of this award. And the rest of the cast is very good as well. I would personally like to say that this film could have easily been the best picture of the year, and the actor's could have easily walked away with several statues. The director could have won an Oscar as well.
In the end, you are irrevocably drawn into the story and live it, just as you should be with a really good film. My only word of warning is that this is a real tear-jerker, the end of this one could have you crying like a baby.
There are few films that I would recommend to anyone, this movie is definitely one of those. (Of course you have to put the kids to bed, some of the words, action, and violence are not really suitable for children.) A+",1064448000,5,2169,4.425

This may not be a politically correct movie with the war today, but it is one of the best I have ever seen. Meg Ryan, although with limited time in the movie, showed more than just being a cute actress, which she has been stereo typed as. I think the unpredictability of how the ending turns out, shows she is one of the top actors today, and should play more serious roles. This was an Academy Award performance.
Denzel, as usual was perfect and so believable in the role. He is without a doubt one of the finest actors of our times. The movie, with the flashbacks, emotions was directed and produced that kept the audience glued to the movie, and brought tears at the end.
How I missed this movie when it came out, I don't know, but the casting and acting should have won this movie and Oscar or Golden Globe Award. War is ugly, and ugly things happen we prefer not to know. This movie portrays what families should be told, and although necessay, war is never glorious.

850384,5,6304342470,"Apart from the credits going to director Ed Zwick and to screenplay writer Patrick Duncan who successfully managed to apply the ""Rashomon"" technique into a dramatic (and controversial) depiction of war, the fine performance of a strong cast really added up to make ""Courage Under Fire"" a worthwhile place in every movie buff's library. Many reviewers have recognized Denzel Washington's great job as a tortured soldier struggling to find the truth that might help him put down an unbearable burden, but it was Meg Ryan who actually amazed me. After watching this movie for the fourth time or so I finally figured out why I adored her so much in a role that she didn't originally seem to show her best at. Putting aside her culminating, undeniable success in a streak of romantic comedies, I remember having seen her in just a few dramas like ""Top Gun"", ""The Presidio"", ""The Doors"", ""When a man loves a woman"", ""Proof of life""..., and (no offense to Ryan fans) she never gave a creditable performance in any of them. But somehow, she truly shone in this unexpected role of a female commanding officer under fire. I've been wondering... what if the role were given to Sigourney Weaver... or to Linda Hamilton...? Well, the portrayal might have been ""tougher"" and the war scenes much more exciting, but I'm sure the movie wouldn't have given me this strange kind of emotion... Then I realized something. Meg Ryan looked so fragile, so vulnerable as Captain Karen Walden when she faced a critical situation that required all deadliest decisions in a matter of seconds. And as fragile as she looked, she ended up handling it in the most valorous way a person could do. Only Ryan's natural ""cuteness"" and vulnerability could render the image of Karen Walden such candor, credibility and merit. That image has impressed me quite a lot and strengthened my admiration towards all servicewomen who go out there serving the country, women who are ready to sacrifice their lives, not for a Medal of Honor or anything, but for a good cause they chose. Remember how Denzel Washington as Lt. Col. Serling corrected a White House P.R. agent when that guy mentioned the Medal of Honor?. ""They don't WIN it. They receive it. It's not a contest"".

Denzel's character receives conflicting information and is determined to get to the bottom of what is going on.

Under the surface this becomes a better movie.  Denzel's character is struggling with a friendly fire incident he was just involved in and is willing to take responsibility that the Pentagon will not allow him.  His inner struggle is a fine secondary story line and as any good soldier would do he is doing without the help of his family (his wife is trying to help) or his friend and commanding officer (whom he will not turn to).

But as Serling questions the surviving members of Walden's crew, he discovers their various versions do not jive, and he begins to question what is the truth of what really happened. Moreover, Serling is haunted by his own actions during the Gulf War, where he was responsible for a ""friendly fire"" incident that resulted in the death of American soldiers. To complicate matters even more, Serling is drinking way too much, has grown distant from his family, and is being hounded by both a commanding officer (Michael Moriarity) who wants the P.R. value of Walden being the first woman to receive the Medal of Honor and a reporter (Scott Glenn) who knows something of what happened to the Colonel in Iraq and wants to know the rest.
""Courage Under Fire"" makes excellent use of the ""Rashomon"" technique, wherein we get to see each person's version of what really happened in Iraq. Serling's own feelings of guilt and responsibility for what happened in Iraq provide an additional level of depth to the narrative (more so than in Kurosawa's original classic film in fact). Some may find the parallel attempts to find redemption to be somewhat heavy handed, but ultimately the film succeeds because of the solid acting performances. In addition to Washington and Ryan, who never have a scene together, there are solid performances from Lou Diamond Phillips and a very underweight Matt Damon as surviving members of Walden's crew, Michael Moriarity as the General, Scott Glenn as the reporter, and Regina Taylor as Serling's wife. Certainly this film is closer to the reality of Desert Storm than ""Three Kings,"" but the main enjoyment here is watching Ryan and her crew do the same lines with totally different meanings because of radical changes in context while Washington tries to find meaning in his own life.",1012348800,12,2415,4.907090464547677
850388,5,6304342470,"One of my favorites. A movie that will keep you guessing till the very end. Nat Serling is sent home from the Persian Gulf with traumas and few prospects after being in a friendly fire incident. He is given what should have been an open-and-shut case: investigate a female chopper pilot for the Medal of Honor. Things become tricky quickly as Serling's support is withdrawn when he discovers discrepancies in the witness' stories and he will have to risk everything to find out the truth about what happened on a dark night in Iraq. Magnetizing throughout, this picture is well-conceived and very compelling, and it has messages about society. Excellent directing and writing, as well as amazing acting, this movie shines.",997574400,19,722,4.975206611570248

With Agatha Christie style, get the truth from the eye witness through interview. And different witness give some kind of variations of the truth. It is really exciting to watch. Too bad this movie was not a box office hits but lucky for us Fox has given us an excellent quality DVD. Sharp picture and great sound. Highly recommended.",996969600,6,512,4.764044943820225

The film talks about honor and duty without a sneer.  Also while the Gulf War is the setting of the film it is not commented on in negative or positive ways.  It is simply a historical event, against which a fantastic drama is set and in which compelling characters interact.",994032000,,442,4.688311688311688

Which story is the truth? Both are unveiled at the end. A twist as great as The Negotiator.

850423,3,6304342470,"Matt Damon can be seen here in one of his first roles, and this role was largely overlooked, overshadowed perhaps by the star power of Meg Ryan (in the least annoying role I have ever seen her play) playing a tough commanding officer during Desert Storm, or overshadowed by Denzel Washington, investigating the circumstances surrounding her death. Damon may even have been overshadowed by the presence of an insane, glory seeking Lou Diamond Phillips. Damon's heroin-addicted character, though, is one of the reasons this film stands out in my mind. Also the story-telling technique of flashing back through different character's eyes is borrowed from such classic films as Kurosawa's Rashomon. It expertly illustrates the importance and use of point-of-view, which is totally different and distorted depending upon whom you consult.",982368000,11,833,5.415384615384616
850424,5,6304342470,"Courage Under Fire moved me when I saw it originally on cable when it first came out. The somewhat cheesy tank battle scenes where the friendly fire incident takes place almost made me lose interest, but I'm glad that I stayed and watched the entire thing. The film is very well acted, and was the first time I saw Matt Damon. Matt has the ability to play his characters with a vulnerability that is mesmerizing and I remember hoping we would be seeing more from hi (who knew?).
The film is formatted as current-day investigation with flashbacks that take different perspectives on the events as the investigator (Denzel) gets different versions of the story. If that format bothers you, stay away from this one, but otherwise, I recommend it highly.
I have been waiting a long time for the DVD of this move and finally gave up LAST MONTH and bought the VHS edition.",977616000,2,866,4.62987012987013

The triumph of  Courage Under Fire is in its old-fashioned storytelling and the eyes of its  star soldier. If Washington's legend isn't secure by now, then there is no  justice. The man's got the goods, and when he lets them fly all we can do  is offer him our best salute.",945734400,2,476,4.7682926829268295

Thinking the search is an easy, open-and-shut case, he is  ordered to detirmine whether Captain Walden is worthy of the Medal of  Honor.

I have a large blu ray collection and tons of other movies play on this unit, but have had a few movies that will not play and therefore have had to return them.

All of the extras would play fine. But the movie would not, jumping to a specific scene would not. Same at the other movies that would not play, once an attempt is made to play the movie (or any part of it), the unit locks up. I have to unplug power from the DVD player, power it back up and open the door to get it out. Have not figured out the pattern but some blu ray discs have some feature/format that makes them unplayable on some players. (The player is up to date with latest firmware, so it's not that.)

I don't know who did the screen play but I think the story line is terrific, you can't guess how it is going to end or what is going to happen next.  Denzel Washington is terrific in it, he is one of those actors I always enjoy and his films are excellent.  He's not afraid of gritty, unfunny stories that make us think about the important, valuable things in our lives.  I always enjoy Meg Ryan but what a different, spine chilling tale to see her in.  If anyone is inspired by stories of truth, forgiveness, and working through the amazing challenges our lives sometimes offer us this is a must see movie in my opinion.
